Terris she was able to look upon directly, but here, in the presence of her god, the God of Honor, she trembled in awe and steadied to keep from falling face first supplicant before him.<br>
<br>
“Camille Wyldechylde.”, he said, voice coming down from high above her, rich and full of vibrancy, steady and clear.<br>
<br>
“My Lord.”, she said, looking upon his massive boots.  “It is my honor that You know who I am.”<br>
<br>
“No, my child,” he said after a pause, “It is mine, and my shame.”<br>
<br>
“Shame, My Lord?” Camille dared ask.<br>
<br>
“You know I have stood near you similar to this before?” he asked.<br>
<br>
“Aye, I do, my Lord.”, she replied.  “During End Game.  My husband told me.”<br>
<br>
“And yet you still worship me?” Mithaniel asked, slightly surprised.  “Knowing the last time we were this close I had come to snuff out your life?”<br>
<br>
“You were doing as You saw right for the greater good.”, was her reply.<br>
<br>
“The greater good,” Mithaniel said ironically.  “The greater good would have been the end of us all, if your husband had not interceded on your behalf.”<br>
<br>
“While others stood paralyzed with fear for their own existences, You acted on the behalf of others.” Camille rejoined.  “Your only error, if I may be so bold to suggest there had been any at all, would have been a misinterpretation of the intelligence afforded You.”<br>
<br>
“How delicately put.” Mithaniel said, laughing suddenly.   “I know why you have come.  I heard your prayer.  My eyes have always turned to you when my name is uttered by your lips, since End Game.”<br>
<br>
“Will You help, my Lord?” Camille asked.<br>
<br>
“I will provide you with the quest for the sword, yes.” Mithaniel said.<br>
<br>
“It is all I could ask of You.”, she said, although a part of her wanted to scream JUST GIVE ME THE SWORD! <br>
<br>
“You wonder why I do not give you the weapon whole.”, he stated, seeming to read her mind, which most likely, he had done.<br>
<br>
“Yes, my Lord.”, she answered honestly.<br>
<br>
“I am the God of Honor.”, he replied.  “And even as the end of two worlds draw near, what will the bards say of the woman who was handed her foe in chains, head stretched across the block, as she brought her sword upon his neck to save them?  She would be no hero in my eyes; she would be an executioner.  No, I will give you the quest, and if you are indeed worthy, you will complete it, and with its reward attempt to save your worlds.  You will go forth with Honor, and succeed or fail, know when it is all done you were true to your calling, and true to your God.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, my Lord.” Camille said, knowing deep inside herself he was right, but full of self doubt at her ability to do something this important, with the lives of two worlds hanging in the balance.  Or maybe it was the fact that she was gambling with the only thing left of her husband.  Her mind was so awash with questions and fears that little made sense.<br>
<br>
“Earthcarver.” Mithaniel mused.  “Only one other paladin had ever inquired after that sword.  Ex-paladin I should say.  His desire for it was a petty foul reason, but I did not think to question his motives, since he had served me so diligently in the past.  I did not think to examine his soul, as I have done yours, and see what hides beyond the knelt knee and promise to serve.  You may cross paths with this anti-paladin while performing your quest, for he still seeks Earthcarver.  When he finishes his quest, he intends to use it to behead a statue of me that stands in the temple in North Freeport, when he and that foul Freeport Militia he runs overthrow the paladins there.  Lucan D’lere always was a child, even when he grew out of his knickers and into the armor of a man.”<br>
<br>
Camille started involuntarily, eyes still fixed to the floor.  Lucan D’lere!  After all those years.  She hoped feverently that her path may not cross that of her old suitor.  If she never laid eyes upon him again except as the guest of honor in a funeral march, she would be content.<br>
<br>
“The Quest:” Mithaniel intoned.  “The hilt and pommel are already crafted, and are the handle for a great many ancient quested sword, serving both good and evil alike.  The blade is what determines the alignment for the sword.  The hilt and pommel lay deep in the Castle Mistmoore, clasped in the hands of Mistmoore himself.  They must be acquired.  He sleeps with it, knowing that it serves as the base of yet another blade, that may one day be used to remove him from your world.  This is the first stage of your quest, recover the hilt and pommel from him.<br>
<br>
The blade itself must be crafted from ore that has undergone a transformation; platinum and gold tempered in dragon-breath.  There are extremely limited sources for these metals.  You need to find ten coins weight each, to be mixed with common steel.  The gold can be found in the lair of Lord Nagafen, from his bed.  As he sleeps upon a pile of gold, his foul exhale over countless years has created the metal that you need; recognize it as the gold coins with their insignias melted from their faces.  Years of hoarding should have a goodly pile for you to sift through.  The platinum is in the lair of Lady Vox, likewise, simple platinum coins bearing no mark but a smooth finish.  Take this ore to a master blacksmith, and have the blacksmith forge the blade and create your sword.”<br>
<br>
“My Lord.”  Camille pointed out hesitantly.  “It is said of dragons lairs that when they are occupied by the dragon, people trained to the degree that I have been are unable to enter without being banished instantly…”<br>
<br>
“And is still the case.” Mithaniel replied.  “Find a way, Camille Wyldechylde.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, my Lord.” Camille answered, sighing inwardly at the apparent impossibility of her task.  “There is one other thing…”<br>
<br>
“Passage to Luclin.”, he said, again, anticipating her question.  “Your friend the gnome was on the right track, you will go upon a steed similar to River’s mount.  Seek the Mother of All, and tell Her I have sent you.  Tunare will know what to do.”<br>
<br>
“I shall, my Lord.” Camille said, still staring at his boots.  “And my humble thanks.”<br>
<br>
“Succeed or fail, Camille Wyldechylde, but go with honor.” Mithaniel commanded.  “I shall send you to the gates of Freeport to put your house in order and begin.  And the next time I see you, may it be standing victorious before me, not as a suit of empty armor in my halls.”<br>
<br>
Camille knelt silently.  There was nothing more to be said.<br>
<br>
And, upon blinking, she opened her eyes and saw not his brilliant boots, but the dirt of West Freeport.  Climbing to her feet and lifting her eyes to the dawn that had found the city, she entered the town. <br>

Her blonde hair had liberal dash of gray throughout.  But what the years had done to her hair, it could not do to her face.  It was still beautiful.  The woman carried a cup of coffee in her hand and blinked in surprise in the morning light.<br>
<br>
“Camille?” she asked.<br>
<br>
“Good morning, mom.”  Camille said.<br>
<br>
Emaus Spelldancer swung the door wide, ushering in the daughter she had not seen in eight months with a wide smile.  “Come in, come in!” she exclaimed.  “Your father is still asleep, but I’ll wake him.  He’ll be so happy to see you!”<br>
<br>
“Let daddy sleep for now…” Camille tried, but her mother would not hear it.<br>
<br>
“Nonsense!” she hushed her.  “If he finds out I let him sleep through a visit from you, he’ll sic his pet on me.  There’s some coffee on the stove.  Pour your father’s and grab yourself a cup.”<br>
<br>
“Thanks, mom.” Camille said.  Sleeping till sunset the day before or not, the night had worn her down.  Camille went into the kitchen and prepared two cups of coffee.<br>
<br>
“Sylver, get up.” she heard her mother say.  Then something muttered in return.  “Get up, or I’ll tell Camille you were too tired to see her!”<br>
<br>
“Camille?” she heard her father say, awake in an instant.  “She’s here??”<br>
<br>
“She’s in the kitchen.” she heard Emaus say happily, then,  “Don’t go out like that!  Put on some clothes before you scare her off!”<br>
<br>
“Heh, aye.” he said, “Hand me that robe, would you please?”<br>
<br>
Camille stirred her coffee and waited.<br>
<br>
Sylver Spelldancer came into the room with arms open, a ridiculous grin on his aging face.  Time had not been as kind to the old mage as it had to his wife.  “As it should be!” he had been known to say, “My hair finally matches my name, I only feel sorry for ‘Maus that I didn’t turn out as pretty as she did!”.  <br>
<br>
Camille stood up and let her father hug her, kissing his bearded cheek lightly and returning the embrace.<br>
<br>
“Easy, oh knight!” he exclaimed.  “With all that armor you’re not as soft as you used to be!”<br>
<br>
Camille handed him his coffee.  “Two sugars still, daddy?”<br>
<br>
“Aye,” he said, “Sweet like your mother.”<br>
<br>
Emaus blushed prettily.  Camille, even bearing the weight of the last few days, could not help but smile.  After all these years they were still doing the same old corny routines.  As a teen it had embarrassed her, but now, after all this, well…they still had what she wished she did.  They were together.  And she would have made herself a fool for love in front of all of Antonica if it would bring her man back from his cold sleep.  But he was gone, soul locked away by a madman, with the intention of draining every last bit of ….<br>
<br>
“Honey?” Emaus said, looking at her with concern.  “Is something wrong?”<br>
<br>
Camille realized suddenly that she was on the verge of crying, eyes brimming with tears.  She stood hastily. <br>
<br>
“No, it’s just…” she tried, and lost the words, arms dangling uselessly at her sides, as she fought the tears.<br>
<br>
“Camille, what’s wrong?” her father asked in alarm.  But she couldn’t bring herself to speak.<br>
<br>
And then her mother was on her feet and opening her arms to her, and she fell into them, burying her head into Emaus’ shoulder.<br>
<br>
What now, she could hear River say, Knights don’t cry.<br>
<br>
Yes they do River, she thought incoherently to herself.  Sometimes they do.<br>
<br>
And hugging her mother close to her, she openly wept.<br>

Afterwards, Camille sat back down, wiping her eyes.  Sylver shifted uncomfortably in his seat, not quite knowing what to say.<br>
<br>
“It’s alright to cry.” Emaus said, seating herself.  “If I ever lost your father, I would be crying forever.”<br>
<br>
“It’s not just that,” Camille said, picking up her coffee again with shaking hands.  “Losing River was bad enough, but…”  She paused, unsure of how much to tell them.  Sylver gave her a look to go on, sensing she had more to say.  <br>
<br>
So she told them everything.<br>
<br>
When she had finished, she sat back in the chair, exhausted.  Emaus’ face had drained of all color.  And Sylver’s hands were clenched on the table’s edge.  He was furious.<br>
<br>
“THIS is why I never chose a god!” he exploded.  “Sending you off on a quest to Mistmoore!  And against dragons!  With what, a guarantee you’ll come back safely?  No, just a good luck!”<br>
<br>
“Daddy,” Camille began, “It’s about honor…”<br>
<br>
“I don’t give a rat’s ass about honor!”  Sylver thundered, beside himself.  “He is marching you into possible death while he sits fat in his plane watching like a crowd at the arena!  And Whizbang, if I could get my hands on him, I’d wring his scrawny neck, sending MY little girl out to get herself killed…”<br>
<br>
“Daddy, it is my responsibility…” Camille tried.<br>
<br>
“WHAT responsibility?” Sylver cried.  “It was bad enough that husband of yours had you crawling around every stinking pit in Norrath treasure seeking!  Now even in death he has to drag you down with him?!”<br>
<br>
“Sylver!” Emaus reprimanded him, shock in her voice.  Camille’s mouth dropped open as she stared at her father.<br>
<br>
“Don’t contradict me again, ‘Maus!”  Sylver warned.  “Not this time!  When she wanted to play tin soldier and I didn’t approve, you talked me into it.  Then when River started showing up at the door and I didn’t like it, you interfered there.  I warned you both about him, and now look!  Widowed before she is thirty five, no children, and running head first after River again into danger.  His lifestyle KILLED him, Camille, and it will kill you too!”<br>
<br>
“I don’t believe you are saying this to me…” Camille said numbly, cheeks growing hot.<br>
<br>
“Nor do I.” Emaus said angrily.  “When Dane died River looked to you as a father, and was a good son-in-law, to both of us.  I thought you cared for the man.  You wept after River’s funeral.  Where is all this coming from, Sylver??”<br>
<br>
“River is DEAD.” Sylver retorted, standing.  “Must he take my little girl away again?” He was shaking in rage.<br>
<br>
“I am not your little girl anymore!” Camille nearly screamed.  And then, pushing past him, tears once again in her eyes, she ran blindly through the house, automatically running for her old familiar bedroom.  Slamming the door behind her, she fell onto the bed, still decorated the same way she had left it twelve years before, and cried hot angry tears.  Exhaustion, adrenaline, and the unexpected harsh words from her father made all of the strength go out of her.  She stopped crying and just lay with her head in the pillow, unable to lift it.  She dimly heard her parents arguing in hushed tones from the kitchen.<br>
<br>
“You old fool, what’s gotten into you?” Emaus furiously said to her husband.<br>
<br>
“How can they do that to her?”  Sylver shot back.  “How can they put the pressure of saving two worlds on her shoulders?”<br>
<br>
“How can they do this to her?” Emaus replied with a snort of disdain.  “How can YOU do this to her?  And to speak of River that way!  You didn’t mean half of what you said, yet all you managed to do is hurt the very daughter you think you are protecting!”<br>
<br>
“I had to make her see, ‘Maus…” Sylver said desperately.<br>
<br>
“All you have done is alienate her.” Emaus went on unsympathetically.  “After a year of mourning she finally comes home to us…”<br>
<br>
“To say goodbye!” Sylver cried.<br>
<br>
“To say goodbye, so what?” Emaus yelled back.  “Would you have preferred she didn’t come at all?”<br>
<br>
“No, of course not!” he retorted, shocked by the accusation.  And then, all of the anger was out of his voice, and he just sounded…old.  “What if she gets hurt, ‘Maus?   What if she dies?”<br>
<br>
“If she dies, we all die.” Emaus said gently, so quietly that Camille in her exhaustion could barely make it out.  “If it were you, you in that gem, do you think you could have prevented me from going after you?”<br>
<br>
“I wouldn’t be able to stop you.” Sylver said softly.  “You would have ice-cometed anyone who got in your way.”<br>
<br>
“Then let her do what she has to do.” Emaus suggested calmly.<br>
<br>
“She is a girl…” Sylver argued weakly.<br>
<br>
“She is a woman.” Emaus corrected him.  “And that is her man.”<br>
<br>
And then Camille heard nothing more, as she fell finally into a deep sleep.<br>

The first question from his not quite twenty year old daughter came out of the blue: Are shadowknights bad?  Yes, he said, now, have you decided on a last name or are you hopefully staying with Spelldancer?  Can humans be shadowknights? she asked instead.  Rare, but yes, he said, did you decide who you are taking to the Graduation Ball?  Can a shadowknight be good? came her third question, to which he finally grew concerned with her line of questioning.<br>
<br>
“Why?” she said.  “Well, I met one the other day…”<br>
<br>
“You what?” he said, face clouding.  “Is this what this Knights of Truth is going to be about?  I was as proud as your mother when your information from that North Ro thing uncovered that ambush on the Oasis caravan,  but if your line of work is going to involve you with shadowknights…”<br>
<br>
“Daddy,” Camille sigh with exasperation, “Do you recall the man whom I said helped me when I was captured?”<br>
<br>
“Dane’s son, aye.” Sylver said, “Don’t change the subject miss.  I haven’t forgotten, I will be heading to Dane’s house to thank his boy personally later today.  Now, where did you meet this shadowknight?  Did he attack you?”<br>
<br>
“He saved me.” she retorted.  “Riverdane is a shadowknight.”<br>
<br>
The look of surprise on Sylver’s face was a guilty reward for Camille.  “A what?”<br>
<br>
“A shadowknight.” Camille said.  “He tried to train as a paladin, but the teaching wouldn’t take.”<br>
<br>
“A shadowknight.” Sylver repeated quietly.  “Of course the son of crazy Eleese would be something odd like that.”<br>
<br>
“You know who his mother is?” Camille said.<br>
<br>
“Every adult in the town knew when Dane brought her into Freeport.  The ignorant of the city had a story she was touched by Innoruuk.  A crazy notion, but it spread.  I didn’t put much stock into the story, despite how wild-eyed and jumpy as she was when he brought her back to the city when he first found her.  She cleaned up well enough after leaving the woods.  But when she grew pregnant and went into labor, the midwives would not attend to her.  She died in Kithicor.  Dane was trying to bring her to Rivervale for help delivering the child.”<br>
<br>
“That is horrible.” Camille said, her young senses affronted.<br>
<br>
“That is human nature.” Sylver said.  “It is ignorance.  What we don’t understand, we fear.  What we fear, we kill or let die.  Then there is nothing to fear.”<br>
<br>
“Daddy,” Camille said playfully, her eyes softening the irony of her next statement.  “Do you understand Riverdane?”<br>
<br>
“Bah!” he cried, seeing how neat a trap she had led him into.  “I appreciate that he saved your life, but I understand shadowknights.  Maybe his human nature is different, but why would he choose to go down the road of evil?  For that’s what they are, Camille, evil.  How could Dane stand to have him practice that dark art in his home? I’m amazed, but then again look at his wife.  Dane never walked the easy road.”<br>
<br>
“River is not evil.” Camille said, folding her arms across her chest.  <br>
<br>
“How are you so sure about this boy?” Sylver retorted, folding his as well.  Camille looked like her mother, with none of Sylver’s homely looks and graying brown hair, but at the moment, striking the same pose, no one would have ever guessed incorrectly whether they were father and daughter.  Emaus walked into the scene at that moment, and uttered a short laugh.<br>
<br>
“Fine fine, if neither of you will take out the garbage, I’LL do it.” she said.<br>
<br>
“Let the pet.”  Sylver said, whistling.  An air elemental entered the room, turning invisible as it did.  The garbage lifted as if by magic and floated out of the room.<br>
<br>
“So much better than the earth elemental.” Emaus nodded approvingly.  “That thing left more tracks on the floor than it was worth.  So, what are you two disagreeing about now?”<br>
<br>
“Your daughter is bringing home a troll!” Sylver exclaimed, mock-serious.<br>
<br>
“Daddy!” Camille shrieked, lightly bonking him on the head.  “I’m not bringing home a troll!  I’m not bringing home Riverdane either!  I’m just asking!”<br>
<br>
“Why is Riverdane a troll?” Emaus asked, confused.<br>
<br>
“He is a shadowknight.” Sylver said.<br>
<br>
“Really?” Eamus said, eyes dancing.  “How exciting!”<br>
<br>
“Don’t you encourage this!” Sylver pleaded, realizing he was outnumbered as his wife beamed at him.<br>
<br>
“Encourage what?” Emaus asked innocently.  “I just think that’s rather exciting, don’t you, Camille?”<br>
<br>
“It is rather odd.” Camille agreed.<br>
<br>
“Why oh why did I marry a wizard?” Sylver sighed, throwing up his hands.  “Anyone who spends their free time blowing things up cannot be sensible at all.”<br>
<br>
“You married me, Sylver,” Emaus began, pulling Sylver close in a loose embrace, beginning one of their timeless routines, “because you didn’t have…”<br>
<br>
“…a horse, I know.” Sylver finished for her, as usual.<br>
<br>
Emaus sighed and rolled her eyes at her daughter.  “I’m nothing to your father except a port bish.”<br>
<br>
“Mother!” Camille laughed in shock.<br>
<br>
“But you’re MY port bish.” Sylver replied, kissing her quickly on the lips.<br>
<br>
“Daddy!” Camille exclaimed.  She could not believe this conversation.<br>
<br>
Camille stood looking at them holding each other, and suddenly sighed.<br>
<br>
“What’s wrong, Cami?” her mother asked, releasing Sylver.<br>
<br>
“Nothing.”  she said.  “I’m just looking at you two so happy and wondering who I am going to bring to the Graduation Ball.”<br>
<br>
“Lucan won’t bring you?” Sylver asked, surprised.<br>
<br>
“Oh, Lucan would bring me alright.” Camille said bitterly.  “It’s more a question of do I want to be his trophy date or not.  And the answer is more no than yes, Daddy.”<br>
<br>
“Ah, I see.” Sylver said, frowning.<br>
<br>
“I want a man like you found.” Camille said earnestly to her mother, making Sylver blush uncomfortably.  “I want him to get on one knee and tell me he loved me and offer me his ring in front of all of Freeport like daddy did with you.”<br>
<br>
“And Lucan would not do this with you?” Sylver asked.  “All the people in town are predicting he will be my son-in-law with the way he follows you around.”<br>
<br>
“More like stalks me.” Camille said, producing yet another frown from Sylver.  “I doubt Lucan understands what the word love means, would definitely NOT get on his knees in front of anyone for anything and the only ring he would give me is a collar around my neck.”<br>
<br>
“Then to hells with him.” Sylver nodded, and brought up his hand, murmuring something Camille could not understand.  A small red ring appeared from nowhere in his cupped palm.  He then took his daughter’s hand lightly, and fell with a groan to his knees.  “I love you Camille!” he announced to his bemused daughter and smiling wife, and placed the ring on Camille’s finger.  “There.” he said, standing as his knees popped.  “Happy now?”<br>
<br>
“Daddy,” Camille said, shaking her head at her father with a smile.  “I didn’t mean a levitation ring!”<br>
<br>
“Don’t knock it honey,” Emaus said.  “That was my engagement ring until your father found a camp he could farm for a real one.”<br>
<br>
“Speaking of camping,” Sylver said, kissing his daughter’s cheek and then another peck on his wife’s lips.  “I need to get to work or it will be summoned food and water tonight for dinner.”<br>
<br>
“Are you still going to thank Riverdane?” Camille asked.<br>
<br>
“He had better.” Emaus said warningly.<br>
<br>
“Yes, dear.” Sylver sighed, addressing both of them.  “I will go there now.  Pet, follow me.”  And opening the door to let out something Camille couldn’t see, her father left the house.<br>
<br>
“He certainly is handsome.” Emaus remarked.<br>
<br>
“Daddy?” Camille said, wrinkling her nose.  “He’s charming, but…”<br>
<br>
“Not your father, silly girl.” Emaus chuckled.  “Although I like the way Sylver’s eyebrows join like that over his nose.  Very….sexy when he scowls.”<br>
<br>
“Ewww, mother.” Camille laughed.  “Then who is handsome?  Lucan?”<br>
<br>
“Riverdane.” Emaus said.<br>
<br>
“Yes.” Camille sighed.  “His hair is prettier than mine, and his eyes…”<br>
<br>
“Although, he really should decide if he is going to grow that moustache or shave it off.” her mother said, nodding.<br>
<br>
“Yes!” Camille laughed, and then looked at her mother oddly.  “You’ve seen him then, recently?”<br>
<br>
“Yes.” her mother said.  “Coffee?”  And walked into the kitchen, leaving Camille standing with her mouth open.<br>
<br>
“Mother!” she cried, running into the kitchen after her.  “Where did you see him?  I have looked for him on the streets every day since that night in Ro…”<br>
<br>
“Oh, outside the house this morning, while you were sleeping.” Emaus said non-chalantly.  “Milk, sugar?”<br>
<br>
“He was HERE?” Camille exclaimed.<br>
<br>
“Yes,” Emaus said, feigning indifference.  “I went out to water the plants and he was aimlessly wandering around outside the house on the street.  He looked guilty I had  spotted him.  He explained he didn’t want to wake everyone up so could I please give a letter to Miss Stun, and then he hurried off.”  She raised her eyebrow archly at Camille.  “Not knowing who Miss Stun was, I simply said yes and put it in my apron.”<br>
<br>
“Me, mother!” Camille said, not sure why her heart was beating so quickly, and not caring.  “I’m Miss Stun!”<br>
<br>
“Oh, Camille,” her mother sighed.  “I hope THAT’S not the surname you chose…”<br>
<br>
“Mother!” Camille cried.  “Where is the letter??”<br>
<br>
“Oh, the letter.” Emaus remarked casually.  “I think your father’s pet just took it out with the trash…”<br>
<br>
“What??” Camille cried, starting to the door. Emaus’ laugh stopped her, and she turned to her mother.  There she was, standing in the doorway to the kitchen, fanning herself with an envelope.<br>
<br>
“Awfully warm in here suddenly, don’t you think?” Emaus chuckled, and then extended the envelope to Camille.<br>
<br>
The outside said simply, in blocky print, “Miss Stun”.  And inside, after she tore it open, was the phrases: Please meet me at the lake in West Commons late afternoon at five.  Bring your shield and sword.  We’ll spar.  River.<br>
<br>
“I won’t be in for dinner, tonight, mother.” Camille said, reading and re-reading the note.<br>
<br>
“I’ll tell your father you are with your girlfriends.” Emaus nodded sagely.<br>
<br>
“I don’t have any girlfriends, mother.”<br>
<br>
“I’ll make some up.  Your father will be ecstatic.  ” Emaus announced, eyes sparkling.<br>
<br>
“Thank you!” Camille exclaimed, hugging her mother tightly, letter still in her hand.<br>
<br>
“Ah youth.” Emaus commented with a smile, turning back to her coffee, as her daughter ran into her room, closing the door behind her.<br>

Her eyes flew open.<br>
<br>
Sylver removed his hand from her face.  His eyes were striken.<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry.” he said miserably.  “I didn’t mean what I said.  River was a good man.  I’m just so frightened for you…” And then he stopped, words failing him, and just sat at the edge of her bed, hands twisted in his lap, shaking.<br>
<br>
“I’m frightened too, Daddy.” she said softly, saddened to see her father reduced to this trembling old man.<br>
<br>
“I guess I should be thrilled.” he said, “My little girl, savior of the world.”<br>
<br>
“I’m not a little girl anymore, Daddy.” she said, holding his hands in hers, trying to steady them.<br>
<br>
“Aye, you’re a woman.” he agreed sadly, then attempted a weak smile.  “But not too old  to still call me Daddy.”<br>
<br>
“No,” she agreed, smiling back at him.  “Never that old.”<br>
<br>
“When do you leave?” he asked, smile fading as quickly as it had come.<br>
<br>
“Immediately.” she said, sitting up and swinging her legs off of the bed.  “What time is it?”<br>
<br>
“Noon.” he told her.  “We let you sleep while your mother proceeded to point out the many ways I am an ass.”<br>
<br>
“You’re just worried, Daddy.” she comforted him.  “And I love you for that.”<br>
<br>
“I love you too, precious.” he said, hugging her tight as they sat on the bed.  “I love you too.”<br>
<br>
They stayed embraced for a long time, neither saying a word, and then Sylver broke first, standing up.<br>
<br>
“You need to go, or I won’t let you leave.” he said.  “Say goodbye to your mother, save the world, and then make sure this time it doesn’t take you another year to come home for supper.”<br>
<br>
“I promise.” she said, kissing him on the cheek.  She left him sitting on the bed and went into the kitchen.  Her mother was sitting in front of yet another cup of coffee.  Her eyes lit up when she saw Camille.<br>
<br>
“Did your father…?” Emaus began.<br>
<br>
“Yes.” Camille answered before she could finish.  “It’s ok now.”<br>
<br>
“He loves you very much, Camille.” Emaus said with a sigh.  “We both do.  He never forgot how you used to sit on his knee laughing while his pets ran around the house.  You will always be that happy little girl to him.”<br>
<br>
“Sometimes I wish we had never grown old, mother.” Camille said.<br>
<br>
Emaus absently ran her hand through her own graying hair.  “So do I, Miss Stun.  So do I.”  Then she pointed to the pot on the stove.  “Coffee before you go?”<br>
<br>
“No, mother, I need to go.” Camille apologized.  “Every moment lost is a moment Grieg gets closer to finishing his machine.  I am afraid to close my eyes for fear I will sleep while River is destroyed, and then….all of us.”<br>
<br>
“I understand.” Emaus nodded.  “Do what you have to do.”<br>
<br>
They hugged, and Emaus planted a kiss on her daughter’s forehead.  “Come back to us soon.” she whispered.<br>
<br>
“I will.” Camille promised again, hoping she was speaking the truth.<br>
<br>
“Did she leave yet??” Sylver said suddenly, bursting into the room in a panic.  The women broke their embrace, as relief flooded the old man’s face.  In his hand was a small golden rod with a round ball at the end.  Set into the face of the sphere was a red button.<br>
<br>
“Ah, good, I thought I may have missed you.”  Sylver said, handing Camille the rod.  “Just in case, take this.”<br>
<br>
“What is it?” Camille asked curiously.   She had often seen clerics and casters with them strapped to their sides, but had always written them off as “non-melee” and never bothered to inquire.<br>
<br>
“What is it?” Sylver cried in surprise, wounded.  “It’s one of the only things that used to make me raid worthy, in the old days!”<br>
<br>
“It’s a modulation rod.  It’s why I married him.” Emaus said, nodding with a wicked grin.  “I love his rod.”<br>
<br>
“Mother!” Camille exclaimed.<br>
<br>
“Not in front of the child!” Sylver reprimanded her, eyes smiling above his exaggerated scowl.  His eyebrows met and became one.  In that moment, for a brief second, she understood what her mother found attractive in the old man, and it had nothing to do with his rod.<br>
<br>
“What does it do?” Camille asked.<br>
<br>
“See this button?” Sylver said, indicating it.  Camille nodded.  “When very low on mana, press it.  And steel yourself.  It does a dangerous amount of damage to your body, but converts the damage done into pure mana.  Only useable once, and only in emergencies.  Without care you could kill yourself with this,  but handled responsibly, well, let’s just say it has gotten your mother and I out of more than one bad situation.”<br>
<br>
“Thank you, Daddy.” she said, putting it carefully into her pack.<br>
<br>
“This way, I’m with you when you’re out there, in some way.” he said.<br>
<br>
“You’re both with me, always.” Camille said.<br>
<br>
“Go go.” Sylver said, opening the door.  “Before I have your mother root you.”<br>
<br>
“I’m going.” she said, laughing, “Sheesh, you’d think you were trying to get rid of me!”<br>
<br>
“Go.” he said quietly.<br>
<br>
She ran to him one final time, quickly hugging him, and left the house.  She glanced back only once, to see her parents standing in the doorway, arms around each others’ waists.<br>
Her father waved once, and even from the street, she could see the tears in his eyes.  She waved back, heart heavy, and started off for the guildhouse.<br>
<br>
She never saw her father alive again.<br>

Talvarien was in front of a pot of boiling water at the stove, dangling a skinned and boned rabbit over the pot.<br>
<br>
“Your time has come, Sir Rabbit!” Talv addressed his lunch meat gravely.  “I’ve given you every chance to disclose the location of your allies, the Gophers of Gloom, but still you insist on silence.  Very well!  Perhaps a swim in the Pot of Boiling Doom will loosen your tongue!”  Then his pitch went up three notches.  “I will never tell, ranger!” he squeaked, twitching the carcass of the rabbit like a puppet.   “Have at you! Long live the Rodents of Rage!”  And with a spastic movement, started battering at his face with the dead rabbit.  “Eww.” he muttered, half to himself, pausing his frantic and mainly ignored battle with the rabbit.  “Dead rabbit smells revolting.”  Then he turned to the two men, who were still bent over their game.  “To arms, Razor, to arms!  The rabbits are revolting!”  And then he resumed his struggle with the rabbit.<br>
<br>
“You’re going to hurt yourself, Talv.” Rocsalt murmured, moving a knight across the chessboard.<br>
<br>
“A little help here!” Talv cried, and dropped out of sight behind the table, legs kicking.  “Rocsalt, to the gates!  The Squirrels of Scum are massing at the moat!  Grelin, you’re a carrot, get over here and lure away this rabbit!”<br>
<br>
“Crazy.”  Grelin said, capturing Roc’s knight with an unsuspected move with his cleric.    Rocsalt nodded, smiling with approval.  Grelin was learning.<br>
<br>
“We are overrun!  To the tunnels!” Talvarien tried, legs slowing their frantic kicks.  Then his head poked above the edge of the table.  “Anyone?”  <br>
<br>
“The tunnels are blocked by the Chipmunks of Carnage.” Camille called from the doorway.  All three heads turned her way, as Talvarien leapt to his feet and tossed the rabbit into the pot.<br>
<br>
“Cami!” he exclaimed.<br>
<br>
“Did you get the quest?” Rocsalt asked, pushing away from the chessboard and approaching her.<br>
<br>
“Yes.” she said.  “And a way to Luclin. “<br>
<br>
“How?” Grelin asked.<br>
<br>
“I’ll tell you when I tell Whiz.” she said, “Grelin, we need to get to Steamfront again.”  Grelin nodded.  “I’m going to get another pack.  We need to prepare for a long time on the road.”  She left the room.<br>
<br>
“I’ll collect my stuff.” Rocsalt said,  following her out.<br>
<br>
Talvarien turned off the stove and looked forlornly into the pot.  “You win this time, Sir Rabbit, but…I’ll be back!” And he turned and started after the others.<br>
<br>
“Bah, you suck.” piped a high pitched voice behind him.  Talvarien swung around, mouth open.  Grelin smirked at him, shrugging, and pointed to the pot.<br>
<br>
“Very funny, carrot-boy.” Talvarien said.<br>
<br>
“Let’s go.” Grelin said, starting out of the room to gather his own things.  Talvarien nodded and they left the officer hall in possession of the Rodents of Rage.<br>

<br>
Beepbeepbeepbeep. <br>
<br>
Whizbang’s voice carried loudly in indignation through the open window as Camille and company reached his front door.<br>
<br>
“Oh, most noble and mighty Whizbang, I ask this of you only once more, but am afraid I must insist in the name of your good health and continued prosperity.” a high-elven voice said from within.  “Although I am but a frail and humble cleric, not nearly as strong and knowledgeable as you, and my ways may seem old-fashioned and antiquated, they have for me produced superior results in the past, so with many apologies and regrets, I need you to…”<br>
<br>
“Robaz, can’t you do this orally??” Whizbang begged.<br>
<br>
“DROP ‘EM!” Pedi ordered.<br>
<br>
“I’m afraid I must suggest you do as my mighty and superior sister in healing has requested,” Robaz continued.  “And remove your pants and turn over.”<br>
<br>
Camille and Rocsalt exchanged looks.  Robaz was one of the most famous clerics in all of Norrath, his vast knowledge of healing and other medical talents sought after by both the military guilds and the smaller guilds alike.  And he was so…humble and polite.  To a fault.  Even when asking to take your temperature rectally.<br>
<br>
Camille raised her fist to knock on the door.  But Talvarien caught her by the wrist before she could.<br>
<br>
“Nonono.” Talv whispered.  “I want to hear how this pans out.”<br>
<br>
“Talv!” Camille exclaimed, shaking her wrist free.  She knocked loudly on the door.<br>
<br>
“The door!” Whizbang exclaimed inside loudly.  “I think we all could use some air!  Help me into that chair, woman, and wheel me out!”<br>
<br>
“You’re lucky I’m out of shrink potions, Whiz.” Pedi commented.  “Ok, Whiz, I’m taking you off the machine, but if your head starts turning red…”  Then some noise, and a groan from Whizbang, “There, Robaz, get the door for me, please?  And get that growth potion from the mantelpiece and drink it when you’re outside.  Ok, Whiz, don’t stick your legs straight out like that.  Ok, here we go.  No, Whiz, put them under the chair…No.  DON’T PISS ME OFF! Better.”<br>
<br>
And the door opened and out rolled Whizbang in a wheelchair, a tired looking Pedi at the wheel, and a white-haired, aging, miniature high-elf.  Robaz drank the contents of a glass vial he carried, and grew to his normal size.<br>
<br>
“Robaz, I believe you know Camille Wyldechylde.” Pedi said.  “These other three are old officers of Riverdane’s, Grelin and Talvarien, and that bald gentleman over there WHO WILL PUT ON HIS GAUZE MASK is Rocsalt, the patient I was talking to you about before.”  Roc hastily reached into his pocket and drew out the face mask, tying it on under Pedi’s glare.<br>
<br>
“Oh, most mighty and beautiful Camille Wyldechylde!” Robaz said, sinking to one knee and looking at her feet.  “Long may your sword swing in the name of truth, keeping the world a safer place for frail and humble clerics like me!  My sincere apologies at the loss of your husband, I was honored that one as uber and mighty as he would deem me worthy to call friend.  Tunare herself must have wept at his passing.”<br>
<br>
“Hello, Robaz.” Camille smiled at him.  “And somehow I doubt that.”<br>
<br>
“And mighty Grelin, a druid,” Robaz continued on, “I presume by your attire.  You who can stop the rains, control the animals, and call lightning at your fingertips!  How jealous this poor and frail cleric is, to know you have the skills of the healer and yet so much more!  I bow in supplication to your skills!” and bowed low.<br>
<br>
“Hi.” Grelin said.<br>
<br>
Then Robaz turned to Talvarien.  “And you must be a…”<br>
<br>
“Ranger,” Talvarien supplied helpfully.  “Uber ranger.  Powerful ranger.”<br>
<br>
“An uber mighty power ranger!” Robaz said, bowing again, “If only the hands of this frail and humble cleric could play a bow the way…”<br>
<br>
“Better skip the introductions, Padre.” Whizbang cut Robaz off.  “These people are on a timer.”<br>
<br>
“Of course.” Robaz bowed again one final time, and then turned to Rocsalt.  “Since we are both too tall for inside, shall I suggest we conduct the examination on the back porch?”<br>
<br>
“That’s fine, sir.” Rocsalt said, and followed the old elf to the back.<br>
<br>
“Camille,” Whiz said.  “Did Marr see you?”  <br>
<br>
“Yes.” she replied.  And filled him and the others in on the interview.<br>
<br>
“So your next step is off to the Plane of Growth to acquire a steed.”  Whizbang said.  “And then Castle Mistmoore, and then…”<br>
<br>
“The dragons.” Camille said with a sigh.  “How in the world am I going to…”<br>
<br>
Rocsalt came back alone, dangling the mask in one hand.  “Not contagious, he said.” Roc informed them.  “Pedi, he wants to talk with you behind the house.”  Pedi nodded and hurried off.  Camille gave Roc an abbreviated version of Mithaniel’s speech.<br>
<br>
“So, as I was saying,” Camille continued.  “We are all too experienced in our classes to enter the lairs of Lord Nagafen and Lady Vox.  I understand if they notice our presense, we are instantly banished to where we first enter their dungeons.  How are we going to get close enough to collect the coins we need?”<br>
<br>
“Simple.” Rocsalt replied.<br>
<br>
“Aye.” Whizbang agreed.  “Roc’s your man.”<br>
<br>
“Roc?” Camille said.  “How?”<br>
<br>
“Sneak…” Whizbang began.<br>
<br>
“Hey!” Talvarien cried indignantly.  “How come Talv isn’t your man?  Talv can sneak!”<br>
<br>
“…and feign.” Rocsalt finished for the wizard.<br>
<br>
“Oh.” Talvarien said.  “I can’t fake death, but I can do the real thing, no problem, if you need that sorta thing....”<br>
<br>
Pedi and Robaz came out from behind the house.  Robaz looked grave.  Pedi’s face was ashen.  The company stopped talking instantly after seeing the looks on their faces.<br>
<br>
“Mighty Rocsalt.” Robaz asked, “Would you please join me again behind the house?”<br>
<br>
“It’s ok doc.” Roc said, “These are all my friends.  What you need to tell me you can say in front of them.”<br>
<br>
“As you wish.” Robaz said, all business now.<br>
<br>
“So, what?” Roc asked with a nervous smile.  “I’ll never play the piano again?”<br>
<br>
“You have Fungicillia.”<br>
<br>
“I’m lost.” Rocsalt said, bewildered.<br>
<br>
“Yes.” Robaz answered, misunderstanding his statement.  “I suggest you head home straight away, and refurnish your home.  Remove all sharp edges, corners from tables and countertops, replace your cutlery, hire a cook to prepare your meals, and…”<br>
<br>
“Whoa, I meant I didn’t understand what Fungiwhatever meant.” Roc said, hands up in the air.  “What the hells are you talking about, Robaz?”<br>
<br>
“You have a terrible disease.”  Pedi said, looking at Roc, tears creeping in her eyes.  Roc stared hard at her.<br>
<br>
“What are you looking at me like I’m dead for?” Rocsalt said, panic creeping into his voice.  He backed away from them involuntarily.<br>
<br>
“It is amazing you are still alive.” Robaz remarked.  “You have had this for…four months now?  While on Luclin, in Echo Caverns, you told me a black mushroom with a purple cap exploded in your face, giving you a lungful of  yellowish spores.  Since then you have had certain symptoms, the cough, the swelling, the yellowing at the root of your tongue…all symptoms of a disease we have identified as Fungicillia.  When we first got to the moon, Fungicillia ran rampant through some of the first explorers, according to the reports from the Combine’s medical records.  After it wiped part of the colonies, they thought they had destroyed the purple caps completely in a sweep of all known places it flourished.  But you, my friend, seemed to have found one that laid dormant for a very long time.  Dormant or not, however, you most certainly have contracted the disease.”<br>
<br>
“Wiped part of the colonies?” Rocsalt asked, alarmed.  “What does it do?”<br>
<br>
“It bonds with your system, like a parasite.” Robaz said.  “Other than the cough and the swelling and discoloring, that is the only outward sign, and indeed. the only activity it does until certain conditions are met.  But if you bleed, get any type of cut that gets even the slightest bit of an infection, it goes active.  Normally your immune system would kick in upon suffering an infected wound, but the fungicillia first attacks the immune system, killing off your defenses, seeing them as ‘unable’ to properly keep its host alive.  Then after suppressing your immune system, it rapidly begins to create its own defenses.  Unfortunately, it needs millions more of its own immune system to protect the host, so it begins to mass produce it.  This production doesn’t come from thin air.  It cannibalizes the host itself, eating the cells until there is nothing left of the host itself, except the fungicillia.  The conversion is…rapid.”<br>
<br>
“How rapid?” Rocsalt asked in a hoarse whisper, while the others listened in horror.<br>
<br>
“The first sign of breakdown is a bruising under the eyes.  This happens after five minutes.  Then nothing for about ten minutes, and then a furious attack on the body, where the patient seems to whither and age before your eyes.  They stop resembling anything living at 20 minutes or so, but the brain is still alive, and from what we could tell, aware.  After a half hour it eats the brain and it is over.  No body to resurrect, nothing.”<br>
<br>
“Can this be treated?” Rocsalt asked, knowing the answer.<br>
<br>
“It is incurable.”<br>
<br>
“I see.” Rocsalt said stiffly.<br>
<br>
“You should follow Robaz’s advice and go home immediately.” Pedi said gently.  “It is a miracle that you have not been wounded or bled in four months, but in your condition you should not…”<br>
<br>
“No.” Rocsalt said flatly.<br>
<br>
“Roc…”Camille began helplessly.<br>
<br>
“Who is going to sneak into the dragons’ lairs?” Rocsalt said, not caring if Robaz understood or not.  “Talvarien will not be able to pull it off.”<br>
<br>
“No doubt,  you’re the Roc, man.” Talvarien reassured him.  “But this is going to get messy and…”<br>
<br>
“No.” Rocsalt said emotionlessly again.<br>
<br>
“Dragons?” Robaz asked in alarm.  “My good man, fighting with dragons is definitely not recommended.  As your doctor…”<br>
<br>
“You are not my doctor.” Rocsalt shot back angrily.  Robaz’ mouth snapped closed.<br>
<br>
“Roc…” Pedi said, trying to calm him.<br>
<br>
“Nor you.” Rocsalt cut her off, his tone intense.  He gave her a warning glance.  “My doctor was a shaman named Logiktue, and we would have laughed this off with a beer and a long camp of white suits.  You know what he would have advised me?  ‘Never stop pushing.’  That was our way, and I’m not changing just because some mushroom decides it wants to live in my body.  I’m stronger than that.”<br>
<br>
“Roc…” Camille tried.  <br>
<br>
“NO!” he yelled.  The effect was as if he had slapped her across the face.  He strode over to Talvarien.  The ranger flinched, but Roc didn’t notice.  Reaching behind him, he took three arrows out of Talv’s quiver and placed them in Talvarien’s hand.<br>
<br>
“I want you to shoot at me in rapid succession.” Rocsalt said, staring at Talvarien, and tapped the bridge of his nose between his eyes.  “Aim right here.  Between my eyes.”  He strode off fifty paces and stood looking at them, arms hanging loosely at his sides.<br>
<br>
“Shoot, Talv.”  Roc commanded.<br>
<br>
“No…” Talvarien said weakly.  “This isn’t a good…”<br>
<br>
“Shoot damned you!” Roc yelled.<br>
<br>
“I don’t advise this, young man!” Robaz said to Talvarien earnestly.  “One tiny cut and he could…”<br>
<br>
“Talv, for the love of the Tranquil, SHOOT!” Roc begged.<br>
<br>
“Give him the juice.” Whizbang said to Talvarien quietly.  <br>
<br>
Talvarien’s face was striken.  He didn’t know what to do.  He looked at Camille, pleading for an answer with his eyes.  Camille just nodded in agreement with Whizbang.<br>
<br>
“Shoot, Talv.” she said softly.<br>
<br>
Without a second thought, the ranger’s hands whipped out his bow, and with speed barely followable, nocked and let loose the three arrows, one after another with a flurry of motion, dead on for the spot Rocsalt had indicated between his eyes.<br>
<br>
As fast as Talvarien moved, Rocsalt was faster.  With speed so quick Camille could not follow it, his hands swept out from his body and around in front of his face.  Two of the arrows lay split in half to either side of him in the grass.  The last he had caught midshaft with his left hand, the point two inches from his forehead.  Talvarien put his bow onto his back, nearly dropping it as his hands shook uncontrollably.  Rocsalt bent over and picked up the broken arrows and strode back to them.  He placed the pieces and the one he had caught carefully in Talvarien’s trembling hands.<br>
<br>
“I am the Roc.” he said evenly.  “I will not bleed.  I will not allow it.   But if you send me home to hide from the dangers of the world, we can do that little experiment again, and this time I will not catch them, for you may as well kill me yourselves.”  He turned to Camille, and stared at her.  “Will you still have me for this quest?”<br>
<br>
“Yes.” she whispered.<br>
<br>
“Thank you.” he said, clasping her hands briefly.  And then without another word, walked off alone down the path to be alone.  Their eyes followed him as one.<br>
<br>
“We’re looking at a dead man.” Whizbang said quietly. <br>
<br>
Robaz just nodded sadly.  The others had nothing at all to say.<br>

Robaz reported that the Wakening Lands Portal, where their journey would begin, was free of its guardian,  the dragon Wuoshi.  He had been an invited guest on a raid on Kael Drakkel, the fortress of the storm giants, when he had received Pedi’s urgent plea to head to Ak’Anon, and his ride out from the raid had picked him up at the Wakening Lands circle.  Robaz said the raid leader assured him it was safe for his ride, to arrive there, as Wuoshi was currently at the Claws of Veeshan’s citadel, Skyshrine, talking with the lord of the CoV dragons, Yelinak.<br>
<br>
While waiting for Rocsalt to return, Camille sat off to the side, lost in thought, with Grelin and Talvarien close by.   Robaz sat sipping tea next to Whizbang, asking him questions about his aches and pains.  Pedi stood watching Whizbang like a hawk, waiting for his famous temper to boil over so she could swat him back to an acceptable level.<br>
<br>
Camille motioned to her two companions to join her.  “This is going to be a difficult journey.” she said, voice low.  “It will be twice as difficult with us watching after Roc like three nurses, making sure each step is free of anything that can hurt him.  He hasn’t been wounded in four months.  We just have to hope Logi is watching him, or by the time this is done, he will hate us.  We must treat him normally.”<br>
<br>
Grelin nodded, having decided the same thing for himself already.  Talvarien just frowned.<br>
<br>
“If he gets hurt, Camille…” Talvarien said.  “I couldn’t live with the fact that I could have prevented it.”<br>
<br>
“You can’t, Talv.” Camille said.  “So get it out of your head.  I keep looking at Roc and and I see River when he was alive.  River caged up from the world would have preserved his body, but killed his spirit.  And neither you nor I could have stopped him.   And his spirit was what we loved.  He lived to see the world, explore…”<br>
<br>
“River died exploring the world.” Talvarien remarked, then regretted it instantly, seeing the pain leap to her eyes.  “Ok, Camille, I’ll try to forget what I heard Robaz say.  I won’t like it, but I’ll try.”<br>
<br>
Rocsalt came back, the angry look in his eyes gone.  Indeed, he looked refreshed, excited with the prospect of leaving.  When he reappeared, Whizbang and Pedi grew quiet.  Robaz tried one final time.<br>
<br>
“Mighty and strong Rocsalt, is there any way this humble and poor cleric can convince you to take care of yourself and turn away from this venture?”<br>
<br>
“He is taking care of himself by going on this venture.” Camille interjected.  “And taking care of a good many more people.”<br>
<br>
Robaz turned to Whizbang, arching his eyebrow.  Whizbang nodded.  “There is more to this than meets the eye, Padre.”<br>
<br>
“Or I would have chained Roc to Ramluk.”  Pedi agreed.  “Let them go, Robaz.  If they do not succeed, let’s say Roc’s time with us won’t really matter.”<br>
<br>
Robaz frowned, but nodded.  “Then go with Tunare’s blessing, oh most noble and mighty Rocsalt.” he said, pressing his two forefingers to Rocsalt’s forehead.  “May she guide your hands and feet, and keep you safe.”<br>
<br>
“Thank you, Robaz.” Rocsalt said.  “I’ll take any luck I can get.”<br>
<br>
“The blessing of the Mother is not luck.” Robaz said.<br>
<br>
Roc smiled ruefully.  “It’s all luck.” he said, and turned from the cleric and joined Camille and the others.<br>
<br>
“Get going, kids.” Whizbang said, seeing Robaz about to launch into a speech defending theology.<br>
<br>
And with a word from Grelin, the four disappeared.<br>

They had climbed the tower unmolested, the dryads and half-goat/half man creatures that served to protect the portal recognizing them as no threat to Tunare.  They just watched silently, as Grelin, leading the way, brought them through into the plane in which Nature dwelled.<br>
<br>
“Wowowow!” Talvarien exclaimed, looking around him in awe as they stepped into the plane.  Wakening Lands at that time of year was breathtaking to behold, but its beauty paled in comparison to the rich, vibrant life of the Plane of Growth.  Everything seemed so…alive.  The grass greener, flowers on the plants brighter, the birds more colorful, the water in a trickling brook clear and sparkling.  Trees began a majestic forest off in the distance across the fertile plains.  Some of them rose so high the tops were obscured by the clouds in the brilliant blue sky itself.  Even the soil itself seemed to teem with life, as earthworms and other insect life thrived on the rich dirt that served as the base of Tunare’s world.<br>
<br>
“The Mother has a nice lawn!” Talvarien exclaimed, sitting down under a nearby apple tree.  “Look at those apples!”  Camille looked where he pointed, and looked carefully at the fruit hanging in the tree.  Not one bug, not one patch of unhealthy skin, every apple hung, fully ripe, like red jewels dangling from a canopy of green.<br>
<br>
“This place is beautiful.” Camille said, eyes moving everywhere to take in as much as she could of such a spectacular landscape.  Far in the distance she saw a waterfall cascading down a rockface that glittered like gold.<br>
<br>
“Do you think Tunare would be angry if I ate one of these apples?” Talvarien mused, looking up into the tree from where he sat underneath.  “I never got to sample Sir Rabbit…”<br>
<br>
“Talv…” Rocsalt said warningly.  “Remember what happened in Hate when you started poking around…”<br>
<br>
Suddenly, an apple dropped from high in the tree, bonking Talvarien on the head, and bouncing down to land between his legs.  Talvarien stared at it in surprise, rubbing his head.<br>
<br>
“Guess not.” Grelin commented.  Talvarien shrugged and lifted the apple to his mouth, biting into it.<br>
<br>
“Do any other of you wish to taste the fruit of the Mother?” came a female voice from high in the tree.  Talvarien choked on his apple and spit out the mouthful that threatened to suffocate him.<br>
<br>
“The tree talked!” he sputtered, getting to his feet and joining his companions hastily.<br>
<br>
“The trees do indeed talk, but not in a language you understand, silly man.” came the voice again.  And then, lithely, a woodelven woman in a simple green tunic dropped from the tree and landed lightly on the ground.  Her red hair hung straight down her back, and her green eyes appraised them, as men stood gaping at her.<br>
<br>
“You would think Mithaniel’s Handmaiden did not ride with you, and you have never seen a woman before.” the woodelf chided.  As one the three men looked anywhere but at the redheaded beauty who stood before them.<br>
<br>
“The druid Duir.” Camille said, recalling her name from River’s tales of when he had last visited the Plane of Growth, recognizing her red tresses.<br>
<br>
“Yes milady.” Duir said, nodding to Camille.  “Then we both know each other.”<br>
<br>
“River described you and the Plane of Nature in great detail, but his tales do not compare to the reality of the beauty of this place.” Camille remarked.<br>
<br>
“There is nothing Mortal Hate could say of the lands of the Mother that would do justice to Her handiwork.” Duir agreed.  Camille nodded.<br>
<br>
“Damned,” Talvarien said, staring at the druid appreciatively.  “I love red hair.  I’m an idiot for it.  Red hair is sexy, S-E-X-Y sexy.”  Duir blushed, as Camille gaped at him.  Then Talvarien’s brow creased.  “Unless you’re a mangina.” he added quickly.  “Your name in a past life wasn’t Donald or something, was it?”<br>
<br>
“Talv!” Camille exclaimed, mortified. <br>
<br>
“Gotta ask!” Talvarien retorted.<br>
<br>
“It is alright.” Duir said to Camille reassuredly.  “Just as the crops must suffer the locusts and the flowers suffer the weeds, women must suffer male rangers.”<br>
<br>
“Hey!” Talvarien exclaimed.<br>
<br>
“Denied.” Grelin chuckled.<br>
<br>
“You have come for a mount.” Duir said, addressing Camille.<br>
<br>
“Yes.” Camille answerd.  “Mithaniel sent me here.”<br>
<br>
“The Mother has been informed.” Duir told her.  “I have been instructed to tell you to choose one of the ’corns.”<br>
<br>
“…’Corns?” Rocsalt asked.<br>
<br>
“Unicorns.” Camille said, heart racing suddenly.  “River told me of them.  I had no idea that would be what Mithaniel sent me for.”  She had thought a stallion, similar to Brimstone, but a unicorn!  She found she could hardly breathe, as her heart swelled.  Every little girl dreams of one day riding a unicorn, but then they grow up and realize that some dreams are just that…dreams.  But now…<br>
<br>
“Choose with care.”  Duir cautioned.  “For after you choose, the ’corn must make its own choice.  Remember, they are wild.  Some are quite willful.”<br>
<br>
Camille was half-listening.  A unicorn!  “Where are they?” she asked.<br>
<br>
Duir pointed in the direction of the waterfall.  “At this time of day they are drinking at the waterfall after grazing.  I will wait here with your friends.  If your chosen ’corn chooses you, you will be able to ride it here.  If not, then….we will look for your body.”<br>
<br>
That brought Camille crashing back to reality.<br>
<br>
“What!” Talvarien asked.  “Do these horses eat meat??”<br>
<br>
“They are willful.” Duir repeated again.  “Choose with care, Camille.”<br>
<br>
“I have some experience with willful horses.”  Camille assured her.<br>
<br>
“These are armed.” Duir said gravely.<br>
<br>
Camille nodded, understanding.  And then she started off towards the waterfall.<br>

<br>
“Karana.” Grelin said simply.<br>
<br>
“Ah.” she said, then whistled.  From behind another apple tree poked the head of a small bear cub.  Hearing Duir’s call, it ran to her, lumbering on all fours and rolled over on its back at her feet.  She crouched down to tickle its belly.  “Does Karana bless his followers with pets as well?” she asked.<br>
<br>
“Aye.” Grelin said, then murmured a few words.  Out of thin air a similar bear cub appeared.  Duir’s rolled hastily to its feet, and the two tentatively crept towards each other, sniffing the air.<br>
<br>
“I find Tunare’s servant is very bright.” she said, picking an apple from the tree.  She threw it a distance away.  Her cub followed it with its eyes.  “Fetch.” she said.  The cub bound away after the apple, and returned with it in its mouth.  It dropped the fruit at her feet, looking back and forth between the apple and Duir.<br>
<br>
“Mine’s smarter.” Grelin said.  Picking up the apple, he tossed it.  Immediately his cub took off after it.  When the apple landed, he pounced on it and gobbled it up.<br>
<br>
“Smarter!” Duir exclaimed.  “It did not bring it back!”<br>
<br>
Grelin just pointed at her cub, who was looking sadly at Grelin’s cub munching away at the apple, and shrugged.  “Aye.  Mine ate.”<br>
<br>
“So it did,” Duir laughed, and then Grelin’s pet lumbered back and tackled Duir’s and the two druids watched the baby bears play on the grass.<br>
<br>
“So, Roc,” Talvarien asked, tossing Rocsalt an apple.  The monk caught it without turning his eyes from the way Camille had left.  “You’ve been around since we broke up.  You see any of the old crew?”<br>
<br>
“Aye,” Rocsalt said, turning to him as he sat down and leaned back against the tree trunk.  Talvarien  bit into his apple, stretching out on the grass, staring up at that perfect sky.<br>
<br>
“Who’d you see?”  Talvarien asked.  “I saw Malkar a few weeks ago in Plane of Storms, kiting the big frogs.  He was arguing with some druid about sharing.  I didn’t know Malk could get angry, but I thought he was going to ice-comet the guy.  And I hear the halflings went into business with Pavel the smith.  He makes the metal armor, Annir makes the leather and robes, and Barnabe handles the money and bitches a lot.  They moved to Kaladim.  Zullie told me.  She’s making potions for Lord Tuvan of the Order of Antondwer, helping his monk Sauria represent ‘the one true noble race of Norrath’.  For an iksar she was pretty cool.”<br>
<br>
“Annir and Barnabe are in Kaladim?” Rocsalt asked.  “Good, I need Annir to make me another of those weightless shorty bags.”<br>
<br>
“So who’d you see?” Talvarien asked, curious.<br>
<br>
“Kaguera.  Still the old battle tank.” Rocsalt replied, smiling at the memory.  “I was apping Appotus Dominus, and caught up with her and Coldhand there.  Cold finally agreed to marry her.  We had a raid scheduled to leave in a half hour.  And there she was, standing in the middle of the prep room, in full battle armor, while two women are pulling a wedding dress over her head, trying to do alterations.  AROUND the armor.  I swear to gods, she’ll be wearing that dress over full plate at the ceremony.  And she’s barking out orders, Kag style, at Coldhand, who’s standing there with a list as she’s rattling off guests to invite, food to order, decorations to be bought, going ‘Yes dear’, ‘Yes dear’.   Then she says, ‘Did I forget anything?’ and he says ‘Yeah, you forgot my…’…”<br>
<br>
“Brandy!” Talvarien exclaimed, clapping his hands together.<br>
<br>
“Yup,” Roc mused.  “He sure did love his brandy.”<br>
<br>
“If Kaguera was my wife, I’d drink heavily too.” Talvarien chuckled.<br>
<br>
“Damned good raid leader she was tho.” Roc commented, eyes far away.<br>
<br>
“Yeah.” Talv agreed.  “When’s the ceremony?”<br>
<br>
“Next week.” Rocsalt said.  “Hopefully they’ll be a next week.”<br>
<br>
“You ever see Nizz and Bwael?” Talvarien asked, glancing at Rocsalt.<br>
<br>
“No.” Rocsalt said.  “Like poof, gone with those two.”<br>
<br>
“Nizzre got married, I heard.  Then he, his wife and brother Bwael headed out to Western Waste with what few provisions they had and disappeared.  No one’s heard anything since.  I’m surprised they didn’t tell Camille where they were going.  Nizzre was almost as wrecked as Cami when River died.”<br>
<br>
“I know, I was in the guildhouse when he came back with River over his shoulder, after Bwael tracked him to Velks.” Roc recalled.  “That night was a mess.”<br>
<br>
“It’s been a mess since.”  Talv commented.  “Hells, I just….wandered the last year.  River was a hard act to follow.”<br>
<br>
“You thinking about any other guilds?”  Rocsalt asked.<br>
<br>
“Walkers, maybe, when this is all over…” Talvarien said, and then stopped, losing his train of thought as he heard Duir giggle.  Talv looked over at her and Grelin sitting almost shoulder to shoulder watching the bears play.<br>
<br>
“What the hells?” Talvarien sighed.  “Carrot-boy gets the girl.”<br>
<br>
“Those silent types ALWAYS get the girl.” Rocsalt nodded.<br>
<br>
“It isn’t right…” Talvarien said, shaking his head sadly.<br>
<br>
“Oh, come on, Talv!” Roc laughed, “You practically called her a mangina…”<br>
<br>
“You never know!” Talv cried indignantly.  Then paused.  “Hey, you think Kag was a mangina?”<br>
<br>
“Hmm…” Rocsalt mused.<br>
<br>
“Well, milords.”  Duir said, standing suddenly.  “The Mother calls me.  I will leave the bear here, and return when I am done serving Her need.”  She gave Grelin a final smile, and then, with a word, disappeared with a flash of green light.<br>
<br>
“Grelin’s got a girlfriendddddd.” Talvarien singsonged.  Grelin just looked at him.<br>
<br>
“Huh?” he said, face turning bright red.<br>
<br>
“How does that song go, Roc?”  Talvarien asked.  “ … ‘Grelin and Duir sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-…’…”<br>
<br>
“Don’t make me kill you.” Grelin said quietly.<br>
<br>
Talvarien’s mouth dropped open.  “Roc, you hear that?  FIVE WORDS!”<br>
<br>
“I’m serious.” Grelin frowned, though his eyes smiled.<br>
<br>
“Kill me with what?  Your killer bear?” Talvarien laughed, pointing at the bear cub.  The two cubs turned towards Talvarien.  Grelin’s snarled deep in its throat.  Duir’s picked up on it and joined in, growling.  Both began slowly advancing towards Talvarien.<br>
<br>
“Um, funny, carrot-boy.” Talvarien laughed uneasily.  “Call ’em off.”<br>
<br>
Grelin just smiled and shrugged, and lay down in the grass, closing his eyes.  The bears crept closer.  Foam dripped unchecked from one cub’s mouth.<br>
<br>
“Hey…bears are supposed to LIKE rangers!” Talvarien exclaimed, backing up.  The cubs drew closer.<br>
<br>
“Hey, HEY!” he cried, as they started to pick up their pace.  “Don’t you see the sign?  DO NOT FEED THE BEARS!”<br>
<br>
“Sic ’im.” Grelin said, not opening his eyes.<br>
<br>
“HEY!” Talvarien exclaimed, turning tail at the now foaming cubs and fleeing.<br>
<br>
And round and round the apple tree they ran, two small bear cubs chasing a swearing ranger,  to Roc and Grelin’s amusement and Talvarien’s dismay.<br>

<br>
There, some drinking, some just standing, watching the others, stood a herd of the most magnificent horses she had ever laid eyes on.<br>
<br>
The unicorns, more than two dozen, dotted the area around the falls, taking in their drink.<br>
<br>
Every horse was pure white...no discoloration, no mix of dappled brown or black, no stain on their perfectly white hides. The only color breaking up the white was gold...hooves like solid metal, mane and tail that brilliant dark yellow, and the horn, twisting like a golden spike, wicked sharp, two feet of colorful bone extending from the forehead of the beasts. Camille felt her lungs constrict as she looked upon the beasts of Tunare's stables.<br>
<br>
Now, she thought. Which one?<br>
<br>
One thing she noticed, as far as she could tell, they were almost primarily male. The stallions were everywhere, but of the mares, only two, one, young, small...no more than a colt. The other, adult. You could sense an air of a matron about her, the way she lowered her mouth to the water and drank, without glancing about, as if she knew, if anything startled the herd, she would be protected by the males. The stallions danced in the grass before her, locking horns in a play for attention, but she ignored them all, and lowered her head again to drink.<br>
<br>
Now or never.<br>
<br>
Camille stepped from the brush.<br>
<br>
Instantly the unicorns reacted, half of the herd circling the young female and standing very still, heads lowered to leave Camille facing a sharp row of golden spikes. The other half formed a line with almost military precision in front of the older mare, scuffing their front hooves in the soil and snorting in warning. A sea of golden lances moved to and fro and the stallions made a protective fence around the two females. Tension filled the air.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will not hurt you.&quot; Camille said, feeling like a fool speaking to the animals, but hoping her steady, even voice would calm the growing agitation of the herd. &quot;I just need to ride one of you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her eyes inspected the herd. The matron snorted once, and they parted, leaving a clear path between herself and Camille.<br>
With a deep breath, Camille began walking forward.<br>
<br>
Closer and closer she grew, the males growing more restless. Still the matron just watched her quietly, the only unicorn in the herd that did not have its weapon trained on her.<br>
<br>
When they were less than six feet apart, Camille stopped, noticing with unease that the unicorns that had been protecting the younger female had broken off, one by one and now were behind her, effectively sealing off any thought of retreat. All around her, golden horns lowered, fencing her in.<br>
<br>
&quot;I need your help.&quot; Camille addressed the matron.<br>
<br>
The matron regarded her quietly, and then neighed once. One of the males next to her pushed ahead, and touched its horn to the ground. Camille realized he wanted her to ride.<br>
<br>
Camille sighed in relief. That was easier than she had imagined. Although she would have never chosen a stallion if she had the choice; her experiences with Brimstone had left her scarred.<br>
<br>
No sooner had she thought that, than she realized she could never ride the unicorn who offered himself to her. &quot;Choose&quot; Duir had said, and this would not have been the beast Camille would choose.<br>
<br>
&quot;I choose you.&quot; Camille said, raising her finger to the matron, hand shaking.<br>
<br>
The matron snorted once. The males backed up, horns still lowered.<br>
<br>
Slowly the matron took a step forward. Her head lowered, levelling her horn at Camille. Camille held her breath.<br>
<br>
With a quick movement, lightly, the matron tapped her horn on the hilt of Reaver, poking out from its scabbard on Camille's back. The movement nearly threw her off balance. The matron whinnied, and danced back. Camille glanced over her shoulder at the handle of the sword. What did this horse want? The sword?<br>
<br>
Camille drew the weapon out, and extended it, hilt first, toward the matron. The unicorn tossed her head and snorted again, pawing the ground. Camille stood there, weapon reversed, confused.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you want?&quot; Camille asked again, offering the sword.<br>
<br>
The matron lowered her horn again, neighing. The horn weaved back and forth. Comprehension dawned uneasily on the knight.<br>
<br>
&quot;What, is it a spar you wan...?&quot; Camille began, and then the matron lunged at her, horn aimed at her throat.<br>
<br>
Instinctively, Camille flipped the weapon around and parried weakly, barely deflecting the horn to her left, passing it over her shoulder as the horse's head came in close. She could smell the warm exhale from the matron as their faces grew close enough for a kiss. And then the matron danced back.<br>
<br>
The males began to make a high pitched sound. Camille's ears rang as she stood facing the matron, as the noise rose in pitch. It almost sounded like human cries. Her eyes darted from the males to the matron in a panic.<br>
<br>
The unicorns were screaming.<br>
<br>
And then the matron charged.<br>
<br>
Camille dove to the side as the matron's bulk bore down upon her. Tucking and rolling as she did, sword out to the side as to not tangle itself up as she curled into a ball. She came out of the dive rolling over once, safely out of way of the thundering hooves. Had she not moved, she would have been trampled under the horse's rush. She unclasped her shield, and brought it up protectively in front of her, watching the matron as she cantered around. All around her the unicorns screamed.<br>
<br>
Another charge.<br>
<br>
Camille brought up the shield, knocking the matron's horn up high. Then the matron's chest hit her full across her body, and she was tossed to the side like a rag doll.<br>
<br>
Camille leapt to her feet as the unicorn trotted over to her. The head whipped, and the horn swung at her like a sword. Camille brought Reaver up and parried.<br>
<br>
Again and again the horse swung her head, blindingly. Camille found herself locked into a deadly battle with the horse. She refused to use her blade offensively, but the matron was giving her no room to even think about attacking. It was all defense, sheild up, blade parrying blow after blow, feinting right, riposting left, a dodge, block, as the unicorn stabbed at her relentlessly. Another block, parry, and the horse whinnied and reared back, for a moment exposing her underbelly to Camille as her hooves raised high to dash out her brains. Camille's first instinct was to thrust forward deep with Reaver, disembowling the horse. With every bit of control she could muster, instead she brought her sheild up in front of her face.<br>
<br>
With a jarring crash the horse bore down upon her, hooves hitting the sheild and knocking her flat to the ground. She was prone on her back, sheild still over her, covering her face protectively, as the matron's hooves landed to either side of her head, fancing her in. The breath knocked out of her, Camille lay immobilize under her shield, unable to see anything except the dull steel of her safeguard, inches from her eyes.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the horn drove itself through the sheild an inch away from her ear on her left, rending through the steel like a knife through paper. It plunged into the dirt next to her. Had the matron not miscalculated, Camille would have been pinned through the eyes like a butterfly to a board. <br>
<br>
The matron whinnied angrily and tossed up her head. Camille felt her grip on the sheild go, as the horse's strength ripped it from her grasp. The minute the horse's hooves lifted, she rolled to the side and came up, Reaver ready.<br>
<br>
The horse was shaking her head wildly, the shield still on her horn, stuck, as she tried frantically to shake off the sheet of metal that now blocked her vision. Camille watched, unsure of how to proceed, as the matron joined in with the warscream of the other unicorns, whipping her head from side to side, trying to free herself of the shield.<br>
<br>
<br>
The other unicorns were circling them, stomping their feet angrily. Camille turned warily watching them. They kept their circle going, growing tighter and tighter. Then, almost as one, they rushed her.<br>
<br>
Camille found herself screaming with them as they charged her. With a feral cry, she leaped for the back of the matron, grabbing the horn under the shiled, and swinging heavily onto the unicorn's back.<br>
<br>
The matron went wild, bucking madly. Camille held on like a vice, body aching as the unicorn tried to buck her off.<br>
<br>
And then the matron bolted.<br>
<br>
Wind rushed in Camille's face as the unicorn flew off up a path leading up the waterfall. The sheild still blinded her unwilling mount, and Camille had to bite back a cry as the unicorn almost ran them into one of the maple trees that dotted the path up the mountain side that the waterfall cascaded down. The other unicorns were flanking her, and started to crowd in around the matron, partially to guide her from running into obsticles in her blindness, and partly to attempt to gore Camille from her back. Holding onto the horn with one hand, Camille was forced to draw Reaver once more, swinging left and right, turning horns away from her as they attempted to skewer her sides. Now she was as blind as the horse, eyes left and right only, as she deflected blow after blow, arms tiring, but adrenaline pumping hot and fast through her veins, pushing her on.<br>
<br>
Upward they ascended, the unicorns keeping their queen's path straight, attempting to skewer the parasite from her back. Camille fighting them off like a rat backed into a corner, holding on for her life. The roar of water grew loud in her ears, but she hardly heard it above her own pants of air as she defended her sides. And suddenly the horses flanking her stopped, screaming louder, paniced.<br>
<br>
Camille's eyes forcused forward for a moment, just in time to see her blinded mount leap out into midair. The matron had just unknowingly reached the end of the path, and plunged with Camille over the edge of the waterfall.<br>
<br>
Camille bunched her leg muscles and pushed off from the back of the plummeting unicorn, as they both tumbled head over foot to the water below.<br>
<br>
ICE.<br>
<br>
Camille's body went through a violent reaction to the freezing water, as she hit the pool miraculaously feet first. Her leap had brought her ahead of the horse, and she plunged 10 feet straight down, into a deep part of the waterfall's basin. Reaver was almost ripped from her grasp, as training behind her, as she entered the water, it hit the edge of a shallow spot just a foot behind her. Had she not leapt, she would have been dashed on that rocky shelf, which was only 2 feet of water over hard shale, until it dropped deeper in the area where she had landed. She held her breath and fought exhaling as her body reacted to the cold, and kicked off the bottom towards the bright light that glittered on the surface above her. Her head broke the water and she gulped air in noisily.<br>
<br>
On the shallow shelf of rock lay the matron, on her side, chest heaving. From the unnatural cant of her legs, she had shattered nearly every bone in the fall when she hit the rocky shelf. Her eyes were wide and wild, blood mixed with the heavy foam surrounding her mouth and nostrils, as she lay on her side. The shield that had blinded her lay on the rock to the side, the fall having dislodged it on impact. High above them, the unicorns screamed, looking down at Camille as she pulled herself up, exhausted, onto the shelf. Then their heads disappeared, as they began charging down the mountain side.<br>
<br>
Camille crawled to the horse. The matron could do nothing except look at her with one eye rolled back. More blood and foam. The horse was dying.<br>
<br>
Camille drew herself up to her knees, hands trembling, looking at the horse that had come so close to killing her. The blood on that perfect white hide was a desecration.<br>
<br>
&quot;Live.&quot; Camille said softly, hands lighting with blue light.<br>
<br>
The mare screamed as Camille brought those two burning hands flat onto her shattered chest.<br>
<br>
--PULSE--<br>
<br>
Camille lit white like a star, as magic poured from her soul into her hands, pushing out in palpable waves into the dying unicorn. Bones healed, bleeding stopped, as Camille laid hands on the matron and gave her the touch of life that was the gift of the paladin. The matron drew herself hasily to all fours as Camille stumbled to her feet, drained to the point of near collapse. She stumbled against the horse's side, but the mare did not recoil, just let Camille hang on weakly, attempting to stand.<br>
<br>
The other unicorns had reached the edge of the pool, screaming intense and deafening. The mare swung her head aound and whinnied loudly. And as if a switch was thrown, the screaming...stopped.<br>
<br>
As one, the unicorns pointed their horns at the woman who hung on limply to the side of their queen. And slowly, lowered their heads, touching their horns to the floor.<br>
<br>
Camille watched numbly. Then the matron began to move away from her, and she fought to stand. Sloshing through the water to her sheild, she recovered it and strapped it to her side, watching the mare as she trotted a bit, and lowered her muzzle to wash the blood from her face in the cool waters. She drew up her head, snorting, as the water washed away the scarlet foam from her lips. Then she trotted slowly towards Camille, horn levelled at her heart.<br>
<br>
Camille watched her, panting.<br>
<br>
The mare stopped. A movement of her head, fast, catching Camille unaware. She would not have been able to anticipate it had she even had the strength to react.<br>
<br>
The mare whipped her head around and placed her head low, horn touching the ground at Camille's feet.<br>
<br>
Camille reached out and lifted the horse's head from the ground. With a weak hug, she put her arms around the mare's neck and buried her face into the horse's massive shoulder.<br>
<br>
&quot;I choose you.&quot; she whispered.<br>
<br>
And then, achingly, she climbed onto the mare's back, and cantered back the way she had come.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 420<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/21/03 2:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=55.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wake (Mithaniel's Handmaiden, Breathe III)</span><hr size=1> Talvarien groaned to himself, tossing the fifth apple core to the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;I told you, keep eating those apples and you're going to get sick.&quot; Roc commented, shaking his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;But they are so goooood.&quot; Talvarien moaned, holding his belly.<br>
<br>
Grelin was listening intently to Duir as she asked him question after question about the differences of serving nature as a druid of Karana as opposed to serving the Mother. The bears had given up their chase of Talvarien when Duir returned, and the two druids sent them back to wherever their magic had summoned them from.<br>
<br>
&quot;When is she coming back?&quot; Talvarien asked from the ground. &quot;She's been gone a while.&quot;<br>
<br>
Roc's eyes gazed out across the plains, searching, as they had for the last hour. This time, he saw something.<br>
<br>
&quot;She's coming.&quot; Roc said, pointing off in the distance. Duir stopped her questions, and turned to look. Talvarien climbed to his feet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Does she have a...&quot; Talvarien asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;She rides.&quot; Rocsalt answered, as the distant figure came closer. Duir's mouth dropped open in surprise.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wowow.&quot; Talvarien said. &quot;Look at that horse!&quot; The mare's horn glistened in the sunlight.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Lady.&quot; Duir said softly. &quot;She was chosen by the Lady.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Lady?&quot; Talvarien asked, puzzled.<br>
<br>
&quot;The 'corn. The Lady.&quot; Duir repeated, amazement on her face. Camille drew closer. Rocsalt noticed her hair was dripping wet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, a chick horse.&quot; Talvarien said, nodding as if that explained everything.<br>
<br>
&quot;Only two mares are ever in existance in the herd. The Lady, and the Princess...The Lady's first offspring is the Princess, and then she gives birth to only males. When the Lady passes from the world of the living, the Princess becomes the new Lady, and mothers a new Princess.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh.&quot; Talvarien remarked. &quot;Lot of inbreeding going on there. Reminds me of group of barbarians that live in these huts in West Karana. One of the kids was born with three eyes and...&quot; Duir turned her head to glare at Talvarien. &quot;Um, nevermind.&quot;, Talvarien gulped.<br>
<br>
Camille waved wearily on approached. The unicorn slowed to a trot. Duir fell to one knee, head bowed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lady CloudDancer.&quot; she said. The horse touched her horn gently to Duir's head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Her name is CloudDancer?&quot; Camille asked, stroking the unicorn's mane.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye,&quot; Duir answered, rising to her feet. &quot;And not even I have ever had the honor to have ridden her. You chose well. I...would have thought it impossible.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;CloudDancer and I understand each other now, I think.&quot; Camille said, patting the horse's neck. The unicorn snorted.<br>
<br>
&quot;She says the choice was hers, not yours.&quot; Duir said with an odd smile. Camille just nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Apple?&quot; Talvarien said, extending one to the unicorn. CloudDancer bit the apple in half, narrowly missing his hand. He pulled back.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damned, I know they're good, but ranger fingers are too gamey!&quot; he cried. He looked up at the apple tree forlornly. &quot;I'd love to make a pie of these apples. I have never tasted anything this good.&quot;<br>
<br>
As he spoke, a twig snapped on the tree, of its own accord, and dropped onto his shoulder. He stared down at it, and gently picked it up.<br>
<br>
&quot;It seems the Mother has looked down on her ranger servant with favor.&quot; Duir commented. &quot;She tells me you are to return that twig to your own soil, and within a day it will grow into a similiar tree for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you Mother!&quot; Talvarien exclaimed, looking up into the clouds. &quot;The Mother's Apple Pies! I'll open up a shop!&quot;<br>
<br>
The clouds darkened suddenly, flashing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, ok!&quot; he said hastily. &quot;I won't fool with Mother Nature! No selling the apples!&quot; And as quickly as the clouds had darkened, they dispersed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ask Lady CloudDancer to take you to a destination, and she will.&quot; Duir said to Camille. &quot;Have your companions touch her flanks to journey with you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you, Duir.&quot; Camille said. The men crowded around the unicorn, tentatively touching her flanks. Grelin gave Duir a small wave.<br>
<br>
&quot;To the Lesser Faydark, please, CloudDancer.&quot; Camille requested.<br>
<br>
&quot;May the Mother's eyes always look upon you kindly.&quot; Duir said. &quot;And, Son of Karana, come back to finish our conversation when this is over!&quot;<br>
<br>
The unicorn's horn glowed brightly with a golden light, and the horse, rider and companions disappeared from view.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 421<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/21/03 10:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=55.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wake (Mithaniel's Handmaiden, Breathe III)</span><hr size=1> They stood in the gloom of the Lesser Fay, smaller of the two fays of Faydwer, looking dubiously at the opening in the rockface that led to Castle Mistmoore. Behind them, fae drakes, a mix of dragonkind and butterfly, fluttered around an abandoned druid ring like moths drawn to a flame. The sun, if it was out, or even day, did not pierce the thick canopy of leaves overhead. The thick foilage kept Lesser Faydark in constant twilight. And there, through a short rock pass, was Castle Mistmoore.<br>
<br>
Mistmoore was named for its lord, a teir'dal by the name of Mayong Mistmoore. Born centuries ago, Mayong was blessed, or cursed depending on who was telling the tale, with vampiracy. His home became his tomb. Dark elves still served him, servants to leave the castle for provisions, but in the end, they were all damned. Eventually, each one of his servants would find themselves alone with him, and after sacrificing their blood for their lord, join him in a state of un-life. The living serving the dead, preparing for their own eternal unrest.<br>
<br>
Camille dismounted, and drew her sword, stepping into the canyon that led to Mistmoore proper. Talvarien caught her by the shoulder in a panic and pointed up.<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot; Camille asked, looking up but seeing nothing but leaves.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's night!&quot; Talvarien whispered hastily.<br>
<br>
Camille just saw leaves. &quot;How do you know?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Insect song.&quot; Talvarien said quietly. &quot;We can't tell day from night in here, but they can. So forget about going in now. Wait until the morning.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Talv.&quot; Camille said, starting again towards the entrance. &quot;We are losing valuable time...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, please Cami! Let's wait, ok?&quot; Talvarien pleaded. Camille turned to look at him. What she saw started to worry her. He was plainly terrified.<br>
<br>
&quot;Talv, what's wrong?&quot; she asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vampires!&quot; he hissed. &quot;They come out at night!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know,&quot; Camille said patiently. &quot;We have to head to the boss vampire and take a hilt and pommel from him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know!&quot; Talvarien cried. &quot;But not at night! Then they are awake!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sooo?&quot; Camille asked, losing her patience.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, what do you know about vampires?&quot; Talvarien asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;They drink blood, and if they drink enough of yours, you become one.&quot; Camille said.<br>
<br>
&quot;And what else?&quot; Talvarien said.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's it Talv, we need to go now....&quot; Camille said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Roc, Grelin, you know anything other than that?&quot; Talv insisted. The men shook their heads.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well.&quot; Talvarien said. &quot;Shows how much you know! I happen to be an expert on vampires, and we CANNOT go in there at night!&quot;<br>
<br>
Camille gave him a warning look with her eyes, but Talvarien merely sat on the ground and would not budge. After a moment of pleading with him and getting a stubborn stare in return, Camille gave up and plopped down next to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Camp down here guys, if he's going to be like this.&quot; she sighed. &quot;We'll go in the morning.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you!&quot; Talvarien exclaimed, looking genuinely relieved. Camille's annoyance turned to curiosity.<br>
<br>
&quot;And you, a 'vampire expert'?&quot; she asked skeptically. &quot;Why don't you educate us, Master Talvarien?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok.&quot; Talvarien said readily enough. &quot;Everything I learned I learned from my Uncle Lenny, the one who used to take me on camping trips when I was just a boy. He told me all about vampires. He died because of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The vampires killed your uncle?&quot; Rocsalt asked, leaning forward.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, he choked on a chicken bone while telling us the stories.&quot; Talv replied. &quot;No clerics for miles around. We had to drag his body 18 miles along with all our camp gear.&quot;<br>
<br>
Camille just sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;BUT!&quot; Talvarien said. &quot;He told us all about vampires!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;More.&quot; Grelin urged him on with a grin, starting a small camp fire with his druidfire. The flames played eerie shadows on the walls. Talvarien's voice dropped to a hushed whisper.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mayong is supposed to be so powerful, very few things can kill him!&quot; Talvarien disclosed. One is to be awake by day, which is why we go in the morning, so he can't leave his coffin. Secondly, a wooden stake through the heart, which is why I brought this...&quot; He reached into his quiver, drawing out a short tapered piece of wood.<br>
<br>
&quot;A table leg?&quot; Rocsalt asked, eyebrow raised.<br>
<br>
&quot;I took it from Whizbang's house when no one was looking!&quot; Talvarien nodded proudly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Talv!&quot; Camille exclaimed. &quot;You stole a table leg from Pedi's kitchen??&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, reached right through the window and snap...&quot; Talv said.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're dead.&quot; Grelin announced.<br>
<br>
&quot;If it saves us, it's worth it!&quot; Talvarien said defensively.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, Talv,&quot; Camille said in disbelief. &quot;We go in armed with the Dustyboots' furniture. Anything else?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes!&quot; Talvarien exclaimed, &quot;Then there's this!&quot; He withdrew a small package from his pocket and unwrapped it. Camille leaned in to see what it contained, and then drew back fast, eyes watering.<br>
<br>
&quot;Garlic?&quot; she asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye!&quot; Talvarien said, quickly wrapping it back up. &quot;It was on the kitchen table!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He's definitely dead.&quot; Rocsalt commented, shaking his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vampires hate this! It's more potent than whatever that troll Scurg was eating!&quot; Talvarien insisted. &quot;The vapors render vampires harmless!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright Talv.&quot; Camille said, preparing her bedding. &quot;We'll hit him over the head with the table leg and force feed him garlic. Are you finished?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No!&quot; Talvarien said, reaching into his quiver. &quot;Also, if for some reason we lose the club, I had this made the moment I learned to shoot a bow, after the things Uncle Lenny told me.&quot; He withdrew an arrow, different than the ones he normally used. The tip gleamed brightly in the torchlight.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is that...&quot; Roc began, pointed at the arrowhead.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pure silver.&quot; Talvarien said. &quot;Well, silver-plated. Rangers don't exactly rake in the dough.. BUT! It should still do the trick. Silver is poison to a vampire's blood stream.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, vampire hunter.&quot; Camille said, turning onto her side, ready to sleep. &quot;Tomorrow we'll....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait!&quot; Talvarien said, taking out a glass water flask and handing it to Camille.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not thirsty Talv.&quot; Camille said impatiently. &quot;I just want to sleep.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Before you do!&quot; Talv begged, &quot;Say Marr is the greatest or something into the flask.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What??&quot; Camille asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just do it. We don't have a cleric here, so I need you to make the Holy Water.&quot; He pushed the flask into her hand. Camille just stared at it.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't believe this.&quot; she said. Grelin snickered and climbed into his sleeping bag. Roc was already fast asleep.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please?&quot; Talvarien plead with his eyes.<br>
<br>
Camille just looked at him. Then she shrugged and lifted the bottle to her lips. &quot;Marr is the greatest.&quot; she said flatly. She handed it back to him and pulled the edge of her sleeping bag over her head. &quot;Happy now?&quot; she asked from underneath.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks Cami!&quot; Talvarien said, slipping a cork into the top. Camille just grunted something in acknowledgement, and after a short time, fell fast asleep.<br>

<br>
Camille smilled at the top of his head.  He had fixed the gash in his vambracers with an off-color leather patch.  There he stood, bowed before her in all his rag tag armor.  His sense of fashion was so atrocious….<br>
“I see your moustache is growing in nicely.” she commented.<br>
<br>
River stood erect, finger stroking the hair under his nose absently.  “Ah yes.  My father is quite pleased.  Though he would be more pleased if I cut my hair.  I imagine it pains him to have a son that looks like a girl…”<br>
<br>
“You don’t look like a girl.”  Camille laughed, taking in his broad shoulders and how the muscles corded in his neck.<br>
<br>
“I don’t?” River asked in disappointment, stepping towards her.  “I was hoping the look would distract my opponent in a fight.”<br>
<br>
“One would hope your opponent would be looking at your sword instead of your hair.” Camille replied.  But those eyes, she thought, so dark, wild, long lashed.  They would drive anyone to distraction.  If he were to turn them onto his opponent he could…<br>
<br>
Suddenly out of the corner of her eye, Camille saw a flash of steel.  While she had been watching his face, River had deftly slipped the tip of his sword into the hilt of her sheathed weapon and, with a flip of his wrist, sent it tumbling out of its scabbard to land on the grass.<br>
<br>
“Lesson of the day.” River said with a grin.  “Never let distraction interfere with your focus.”<br>
<br>
“Very nice.” Camille said coolly, embarrassed with how easily he had disarmed her.<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry.” River said, genuinely upset, sensing her cold tone.  “I just thought I would share a lesson I learned the hard way, and one I knew the Knights don’t focus on.”<br>
<br>
“It’s ok.”  Camille replied, letting go of her annoyance,  picking her sword up from the ground.  After all she did let him slip through.  Any lesson that could possibly save her in a fight she would file away for future use.  She would not make the same mistake again.<br>
<br>
“I’m glad your parents allowed you to come.” River said.  “You mother is a nice woman.”<br>
<br>
“My mother allowed me to come.” Camille replied.  “My father thinks I am out with my girlfriends.”<br>
<br>
River’s brow creased.  “Your father would not allow you out with a man?”<br>
<br>
“My father would not let me out with a shadowknight.” she corrected.<br>
<br>
“Ahh.” he said, frowning.  “Well, it’s not like we’re here for a ‘date’ or anything…”<br>
<br>
She felt her heart constrict in her chest.  “No, nothing like that…” she agreed.<br>
<br>
“At least…” River continued, raising his sword.  “Not until after we spar…”<br>
<br>
“Aye!” she laughed, eyes bright.  “No dating while fighting!”  And lunged.<br>
<br>
Swords met.<br>
<br>
For close to a half hour they danced, riposte, parry, block stun…the work was strenuous, but rewarding, as each tried time after time to find a way through the other’s defenses.  It ended abruptly as River stepped in to tag Camille’s side, when she suddenly spun completely in a circle, bringing her shield up horizontally unexpectedly and rapped River hard under the chin, tossing him flat onto his back as his senses fogged from the blow.  Camille stepped in over him sword high.<br>
<br>
“Ok, you win!” he cried, laughing from the ground.  He shook his head to clear his double vision.  “Ow.  I’m glad to see you are using your shield as something more than a fashion accessory.”<br>
<br>
“Lesson learned.”  Camille smiled proudly, reaching down to offer him a hand up.  Then, just before their hands met, she pulled back hastily, as he violently grasped air where he hand had been.  He fell backwards again.<br>
<br>
“Ha!” she exclaimed.  “You were trying to toss me the way I did to you in North Ro!” <br>
<br>
River grinned up at her and climbed to his feet on his own.  “Lesson learned.” he said with a smile.<br>
<br>
“I noticed,” Camille said, “That you don’t cast spells while you fight.  Do shadowknights not have spells they cast when fighting?”<br>
<br>
“Oh, no.” River said, sitting down, looking out onto the lake of West Commons.  “They have spells.  When I need to take out an enemy, I cast almost every other swing.”<br>
<br>
“I see.” Camille said, disappointment creeping across her face.  “So you did not really fight.  Like Lucan.”<br>
<br>
River scowled.  “Don’t compare me to that weasel.”  he said with surprising vehemance, indicating to her to sit next to him.  She joined him on the grass.  “It’s just that I don’t consider you an ‘enemy’.  Shadowknight spells are extremely destructive in nature.  They involve damage that would hurt you internally.  I wouldn’t do that in a spar.  The two spells I could have cast, well, wouldn’t be effective.  You already had seen me use drain strength.  Had I drained you again, you would have been prepared for it, weakened, but able to compensate, knowing it was coming.  I would not be able to take you unawares again.  And Fear?  Would have been pointless in a spar.  It is no fight if I send you running from me screaming.”  He suddenly grinned like a boy.  “Plus, it would severly interfere with the ‘date’ part of the evening.”<br>
<br>
Camille blushed, as his eyes smiled at her.<br>
<br>
“What are the spells paladins get at your level?” he asked.<br>
<br>
“Well,” she said.  “There is the stun line, and some minor healing.  Also buffs that will improve the strength of your armor, and another to increase the amount of damage your body can take…”<br>
<br>
“Aye.” River said.  “Mostly defensive.  And perfect for a spar.  Both combatants walk out of it alive.  But shadowknights, we’re different.  Our spells are offensive in nature.  With a touch, I could have drained your life away, breaking down your organs while healing myself with your life force…”<br>
<br>
Camille’s mind suddenly pictured River with his hand around the orc’s throat in North Ro, leaving nothing more than an empty shell.<br>
<br>
“Or,” River continued.  “I could have cast darkness on you, slowing down your movements as if you were walking through mud while attacking your bone structure, turning it to dust.  Or, disease cloud, eating away at your skin, preventing natural healing.<br>
<br>
Camille shivered, listening to him describe the spells he had in his array.  Then she looked him straight in the eyes.  “Are shadowknights evil?” she asked bluntly.<br>
<br>
“Yes.” River said flatly, staring out across the water.  “They worship evil gods and derive their power through that worship.”<br>
<br>
“You worship an evil god?” Camille whispered, not believing it.<br>
<br>
“I don’t worship anyone.” River said, not looking at her.<br>
<br>
“Then where do you get your spells?” Camille asked.<br>
<br>
“You know, I was born near here.” River said suddenly, pointing off in the distance to where the Kithicor Forest began.  “In the woods out there…”<br>
<br>
“Where do you get your spells?” she asked again, ignoring his attempt to change the topic.<br>
<br>
“I just…know them.” River said with a shrug.<br>
<br>
“You don’t need to purchase them, or train with a master of your guild?” she asked dubiously.<br>
<br>
“My father trains all my weapon skills.” River said, glancing at her.  “And as for the spells, well, after I master certain techniques Dane teaches me, I go to bed, and when I wake up, they’re here.”  He tapped his forehead with his finger.  “I wake up and I just…know.”<br>
<br>
“How odd.” she commented.<br>
<br>
“I’m an odd man,” he said, unsmiling.  “My mother was raped by Innoruuk.  His blood is in my blood.   My natural ability to just learn the ways of the shadowknight I have written off to a side effect of  ‘the Taint’.  My father found my mother here, half crazed.  Right in this spot where we’re sitting.”<br>
<br>
Camille started in surprise “You brought me to where your father met your mother?”<br>
<br>
River looked ashamed.  “Aye, I’m sorry.” he apologized.  “Inappropriate, but I somehow felt…”<br>
<br>
“No no.” she assured him, as she caught her breath.  “I think that’s…” Romantic, she wanted to say.  “…fine.” she said instead.<br>
<br>
They sat a little in silence, looking out across the lake where Dane had found Crazy Eleese of West Commons.<br>
<br>
“It isn’t easy, sometimes, knowing what I am.” he said, breaking the silence, eyes out on the lake.<br>
<br>
“Did you always know you were a shadowknight?” Camille asked, looking at his dark, handsome profile, seeing the pain under those long lashes, heart swelling in some undescribable way.<br>
<br>
“No.” River said, not turning to her.  “Dane discovered it when I was nine years old.  But it isn’t a story you tell on a first date.  It tends to guaruntee there won’t be a second date.”<br>
<br>
“Tell me.” Camille said.<br>
<br>
River’s hand reached into his armor, and drew out a pack of cigarettes.  He brought one to his lips and lit it, inhaling deeply.  He exhaled, smoke floating out across the water, and turned to her.<br>
<br>
“I know, I know.” he said, “Smoking isn’t good for me…”<br>
<br>
“Tell me.” she insisted again softly.<br>
<br>
“Alright.” River said abruptly.  His eyes went to the lake again.<br>
<br>
“When I was a boy, I had very few friends.  None, in fact.  None of the Knights would let their children play with the son of Crazy Eleese.  So I spent a lot of time alone.  It broke my father’s heart to see that, so he got me a dog.  A beautiful, loyal, half halas huskie, half pure breed wolf.  Smart, affectionate, Furball became my best friend…”   She could see his eyes light up as he spoke of his pet.<br>
<br>
“You named a wolf breed Furball?” she smiled, unable to not share his happiness.<br>
<br>
“I was nine years old.” he said self-consciously.  “It was the first thing I thought of when I saw it.  Furball and I would do everything together.  I mean, everything.  We were always at each others side.  Well one day, we were heading out to the tunnel in East Commons.  Dane would let me go out there with the dog, since wildlife generally stayed clear of the man made structure.  We often went there to wrestle or play, and it was generally vacant.<br>
<br>
But that day, was different.  A boy was there.  Lucan D’lere.  You know him I would imagine, he’s a Knight now.”  Camille just nodded.<br>
<br>
“Corrigon D’lere’s son was there in the tunnel, burning bugs with a magnifying glass.  I was small for my age at the time, and he was twice my size.  I dodn’t shoot up till I was fourteen or so.  And Furball at once did not take a liking to Lucan.  He started barking.<br>
<br>
Lucan hears the barking and stands up, looking down at me and my dog.  ‘Who are you?’ he demanded.<br>
<br>
‘Riverdane’ I said.<br>
<br>
‘Dane?’ Lucan asked, ‘you’re Dane’s son?’<br>
<br>
I nodded.<br>
<br>
‘My father said your mother was crazy.’ Lucan sneered nastily.  ‘And that she sleeps with devils.  That would make you a devilboy.’<br>
<br>
Well, that had gotten off to a good start.  I no longer wanted to hear anymore, and Furball’s growling was getting louder, so I turned to leave.<br>
<br>
Lucan’s hand shot out and grabbed me like a vice by my shoulder.<br>
<br>
‘I say you’re too small to be a devilboy.’ he told me.  ‘You’re more like a worm.  So I bet some worm climbed under your mother’s dress and…’<br>
<br>
I had heard enough.  With one swing, I turned around and slugged him in the face.  Hard.  He went down onto his rump with a bloody nose.<br>
<br>
‘You’re dead, worm!’ he cried, jumping to his feet and lunging for me.  But at that point, Furball was practically going nuts, and  leapt at the boy, snarling.  He knocked him back down onto the ground, both front paws on Lucan’s chest, growling inches away from his bloody nose.  Lucan looked terrified.<br>
<br>
I was frightened out of my wits.  I called sharply for Furball, and even then, the dog obeyed me.  He trotted after me as I ran away back to West Freeport.  Lucan had jumped to his feet but did not follow.  Just screamed after me.<br>
<br>
‘You and your dog are in trouble now!’ he threatened.  But then I could hear no more.<br>
<br>
The whole run home, all I’m thinkig about is how I am going to explain to my father that I hit Corrigon’s son and set my dog on him.  I locked myself in my room and hid there, until Dane got home.  And the whole night, I’m waiting for that knock on the door.  Even when I let Furball out after dinner, I stood there at the door, half expecting Corrigon to come marching down the road with his bloody son in tow and tell my father what I had done.  But Corrigon never came.  Nor did Furball.<br>
<br>
Well, Furball had stayed out overnight before, so I didn’t think much about it.  But the next day, when I didn’t find him scratching on the door like he would after a night out, I grew worried.  So I ran out to the streets of Freeport to find him.<br>
<br>
West Freeport, East, and North.  No sign of my dog.  Off to North Ro, where my father would have whipped me soundly had he caught me there.  Nothing.  I made it to the tunnel, intending to cross through and check East Commons.  And there, at the end of the tunnel looking out onto East Commons, where we had first found Lucan the night before, I found my dog.<br>
<br>
Furball was covered in blood, laying in a pool of it on his side.  He had been stabbed repeatedly with a knife or something, fur soaked in it.  A long streak of blood from West Freeport to the tunnels ended at the dog’s body.  Had it been spots or drips, I would have thought the dog had staggered there and fell down to die.  But that streak.  He had been dragged there.<br>
<br>
I knew, KNEW then that Lucan had done this.  Somehow got my dog alone and killed it and dragged it here as a message to me.  I couldn’t prove it, but I just…knew.  Lucan had left my dog for dead.<br>
<br>
But, he didn’t quite finish the job.<br>
<br>
As I ran to the bloody body of Furball, he turned up his head to me, sniffing.  He was still alive, somehow, even with all those horrible wounds.  The worst thing, as I dropped to my knees, was seeing his tail wagging.  Wagging.  Thump thump, weakly, into his own blood, the tail wagged.  He was still alive.<br>
<br>
I knelt there next to my dog, watching him try to move his head to lick my hand, but too weak to do it.  I brought my hand close to his muzzle, so he could.  And his tail kept wagging, as his chest heaved.  All that blood.  I didn’t know what to do.<br>
<br>
Then I remembered something I had seen when I was seven, a few years before.  A horse had spooked and a cart had overturned outside of my house, pinning a woman down.  Her screams brought my father and several neighbors running, and I watched in fascination from a window.<br>
<br>
The neighbors lifted the cart from the bloody woman, as my father dropped down to his knees next to her.  She looked hurt really really bad, was just twitching there.  And my father’s hands were….glowing, blue and white light….”<br>
<br>
“Lay on Hands.” Camille nodded, whispering, naming the ability that would decide if further training in the ways of the paladins would continue.  If a person could be taught to Lay on Hands, to bring someone back from the brink of death with a touch, then they would continue their schooling.<br>
<br>
“Aye.” River said, exhaling.  “He put both his hands on the woman’s face.  And before I knew what had happened, she was on her feet, hugging and kissing my father, fine as she was before getting crushed by that cart.<br>
<br>
So there I am with my dying dog, the mind of a child processing what it had remembered.  And I felt my hands start to tingle, as I grew angrier and angrier at what Lucan had done to Furball.  So I put both hands across the dog’s body, feeling the power build, and looked my dog in the eye.  He licked my hand one more time, and then I….pulsed.  But the blue and white light never happened.  My dog didn’t leap to its feet, completely healed.<br>
<br>
Instead, with a flash of black light, I blew my best friend into a million bloody pieces strewn across the East Commons tunnel.”<br>
<br>
“Oh my gods…” Camille whispered, horrified.<br>
<br>
“I had just Harmtouched my dog.”  River said, eyes rigid on the water.  “The most destructive latent power a shadowknight has, concentrating all of their hate into a explosive force that literally decimates a living creature with a touch.”<br>
<br>
“You couldn’t know…” Camille said, putting her hand on his shoulder.  He didn’t even notice it was there.<br>
<br>
“I ran all the way home, sobbing uncontrollably.” River continued flatly.  “When I got there, I continued to cry, a deep well opened in me from which the tears would never stop.  When my father came home, found me covered in blood and gore, and panicked.  He shook my shoulders, begging me to tell him what had happened, but I couldn’t speak, just kept sobbing.  Finally he patted my back, tilting my head up to him, saying ‘Shhh, now, knights don’t cry.’  For some reason that made sense to me and I so wanted to be a knight at that young age.  I slowly got control of myself, and told him how I had found Furball hurt, and what I had done to him.  I didn’t tell him about Lucan.  The boy in me would not let me.  We didn’t snitch.  Foolish, childish, but…I never told anyone.<br>
<br>
When I had finished my story, my father looked at me oddly for a long moment, and then marched me into the bathroom and washed me thoroughly.  Then we both went without a word to the East Common tunnel, where m father stared long and hard at the remains of our pet.  We collected what we could and buried Furball in a shallow grave near the tunnel.  And then we went home, and my father did not speak of what had happened again for some time.<br>
<br>
A week later, he finally sat me down, and explained in detail what a shadowknight was.”<br>
<br>
River finished the story and the cigarette at the same time, flicking the butt intot he water in the lake and turning to Camille.  Her eyes were brimming with tears.  She looked at him, his eyes full of so much pain and hurt, but he was not crying.<br>
<br>
“It’s ok to cry, River.” she whispered a tear trickling down her face.  He reached up and wiped it away with a finger.<br>
<br>
“Knights don’t cry.” he said quietly, and turned his eyes out onto the lake again.  The sun reflecting off the water as it sunk below the horizon colored his face bloodred, as he….<br>

The vampires! I'm bit!&quot;<br>
<br>
Talvarien's screech brought Camille bolting straight up from her sleep, reaching for her sword. Rocsalt was already out of his sleeping bag and on his feet, eyes darting around in the wood. Grelin was groggily attempting to shake off his slumber, peering around in a daze.<br>
<br>
Talvarien threw the table leg down into the dirt at Camille's feet. &quot;Stake me now!&quot; Talvarien cried. &quot;Before I try and suck out your blood! Tell my mother I love her!&quot; He squeezed his eyes tight and waited for the blow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Talv!&quot; Camille exclaimed, &quot;What the hells happened?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They got me!&quot; Talvarien moaned, pointing to his neck. &quot;Bit me while we slept!&quot;<br>
<br>
Camille leaned in closer to see the mark he was indicating on his neck. Then she pulled back.<br>
<br>
&quot;Talv.&quot; she said. &quot;How many fangs do vampires have?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Two!&quot; Talvarien exclaimed, eyes wild. &quot;Two long viscious bloody dripping...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then your vampire didn't brush his teeth.&quot; Camille said, climbing back into her sleeping bag.<br>
<br>
&quot;Huh?&quot; Talv asked, confused.<br>
<br>
&quot;There's only one mark, Talv. It's a bug bite. We're in the middle of the woods. Now go to sleep.&quot; Camille informed him. Grelin growled and threw an empty backpack at Talvarien. Roc climbed back into his bedding, shooting Talvarien a dirty look.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whew!&quot; Talvarien exclaimed to Camille in relief. &quot;I thought I was a bloodsucker for sur...&quot;<br>
<br>
But Camille had already fallen back asleep. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 424<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/22/03 10:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=55.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wake (Mithaniel's Handmaiden, Breathe III)</span><hr size=1> “Knights don’t cry.” River said quietly, and turned his eyes out onto the lake again. The sun reflecting off the water as it sunk below the horizon colored his face bloodred, as he rose to his feet.  He extended his hand down to help her up.  She took it, letting him pull her to her feet smoothly.<br>
<br>
“See?” he said.  “First date and I have you crying already.”<br>
<br>
“No.” she said, wiping her eyes.  “You didn’t make me cry.  Lucan did.”<br>
<br>
“Are you friends?” River asked, watching her eyes while she answered.<br>
<br>
“He would like me to be his wife.” Camille answered truthfully.  She saw River’s eyes flash dangerously, and something else …jealousy?<br>
<br>
“Keep him away from your children.” River said emotionlessly.<br>
<br>
“HE would like me to be his wife.” Camille repeated, emphasizing correctly.  “Unfortunately, Mr. D’lere will be enjoying bachelorhood for a long time if he’s waiting on me.”  Especially after that story, she added to herself.<br>
<br>
River nodded, and smiled at her.  “Well.” he said, noticing the sun had dropped fully now and twilight was upon them.  “We should spar again.  I owe you a take down.  Maybe…tomorrow?”<br>
<br>
“Oh?” she said, hiding her disappointment.  “Is our date over?”<br>
<br>
“I had hoped to show you where I was born,” River apologized, “But unfortunately, Kithicor by night is deadly.  Undead walks the forest, and they’re hungry for new recruits.  And the nightfall giants sometimes wander into West Commons, it’s not even safe here.  Not to mention that the dark elves are much bolder by night…”<br>
<br>
“You seem to know a lot about the dark elves.” she commented, remembering how Dorn had called him by name.<br>
<br>
“Aye, they are always up to some mischief.” River smiled.  “And one of their high priestesses has described me as ‘He of The Taint’.  I can tell that half don’t believe it, but for fear of her wrath they tend to leave me unmolested when I enter the Nektulos.  I have interfered with many of their plots over the last few years.  Nothing major, but enough for me to have a certain bit of notoriety among them.  I am Hero of the Assling Missionaries.”<br>
<br>
“Assling?” Camille asked blankly.<br>
<br>
“Halfling.” River said with a short laugh.  “Sorry.  Forgot you wouldn’t understand dark elven slang.”  He took her hand and led her back towards East Commons.  “Let’s get you back home before your father runs me through with his sword.”<br>
<br>
“Daddy is a mage.” she giggled.  “He couldn’t lift my sword if he tried.”<br>
<br>
“Great!” River exclaimed, “He has four different ways to kill me without even touching me.”<br>
<br>
“No use running boy!” a voice called gutterally, from over a hill nearby.  Camille and River exchanged looks in the dark.<br>
<br>
“That accent is teir’dal.” River said softly.<br>
<br>
Camille turned quickly and ran to peer over the hill.  River joined her.<br>
<br>
River was correct.  The speaker was a dark elf, and the ‘boy’ he had spoken of was just that, a half-elf boy of around ten, with blonde hair and big eyes..  The boy was fleeing as if in slow motion, face grimacing in pain, feet lifting slowly as the teir’dal walked at a languid pace behind him.<br>
<br>
“That’s Kizdean Gix, courier of Neriak.” River whispered, identifying the dark elf.  “He’s a necromancer as well.  Looks like he’s having sport with the boy.”<br>
<br>
“What did he cast on him?” Camille asked nervously, watching the young boy trudge, sweat running down his small face.  He looked in pain, but he did not cry out.<br>
<br>
“Darkness, it looks like.” River replied, “Like I cast, only more powerful.”<br>
<br>
“The ‘walking through mud while disintegrating your bonestructure’ darkness?” Camille asked, looking at the poor child caught by it.<br>
<br>
“Aye.” River said, drawing his sword.  “We really should help the b…” and blinked.<br>
<br>
Camille had already run out to do just that.<br>
<br>
Gix sensed her before actually seeing her.  He turned his eyes to the woman.<br>
<br>
“Stay out of this, human.” Gix hissed.  “I am dealing with one who spies on me.”<br>
<br>
“He is a boy!” Camille exclaimed, sword drawn in the moonlight.  “Let him be!”<br>
<br>
“That ‘boy’ has been more trouble to Neriak than all of your Knights combined!” Gix spat, noticing the insignia on the sword, picking it out in the darkness as only the teir’dal and their violet eyes could.<br>
<br>
Camille followed his eyes to her sword, and realized her mistake as soon as she did it.  Never let distraction interfere with your focus.<br>
<br>
Gix had cast something while her eyes were away from him, and she suddenly felt immobilized, as terror washed through her.  It literally froze her where she stood, her heart beating wildly, as she fought from blacking out with the sheer force of fear upon her.<br>
<br>
“Screaming Terror, Gix?” River said, stepping forward boldly.  “You couldn’t take on a mere woman and a boy without having to mezz one?”<br>
<br>
Gix focused on River, who was closing in on him quickly.  His eyes narrowed.<br>
<br>
“Since when do you take company with the Knights of Truth, Wyldechylde?” Gix asked nastily, eyes on River nervously.<br>
<br>
“About the time you started playing with little boys, I imagine.” River remarked.  “And, by the way, your darkness is past.  Your bird has flown.”  River pointed over Gix’s shoulder.  Gix turned his head to the side, after the young blonde boy, but the child was gone, disappeared.  He turned back to Riverdane, to find the man’s sword dangerously close to his throat.<br>
<br>
Camille stood, frozen in terror, watching, unable to move.  She saw River in the darkness pointing the sword at Gix’s throat.  And behind River, creeping up stealthily, she saw another dark elf, in full plate, carrying a long bladed halberd, raised up to strike.  WATCH OUT she wanted to scream, but she could only watch in silent immobile fear.<br>
<br>
“Um.” Gix said, pointing over River’s shoulder.  “I would watch your back…”<br>
<br>
River snorted in disdain.  “Do you think I am such a fool I would fall for the same misdirection I used on you?” he asked.<br>
<br>
“Guess not.” Gix shrugged, as the flat of the halberd came down crushingly on River’s skull.  River dropped like a sack of potatoes.<br>
<br>
The dark elf with the halberd lay the blade across his throat.  “I’m going to saw off his head!” the dark elf said with malicious glee.  Gix knocked up the weapon nervously, glancing around to see if they were observed.<br>
<br>
“Don’t be an idiot, Zytl!” Gix whispered.  “Do you know who you just knocked out?”<br>
<br>
“I believe,” Zytl sniffed, insulted.  “That I just saved your inky ass, Gix.”<br>
<br>
“And if anyone has seen you do it, you have just condemned your ass AND mine to death by slow torture!”<br>
<br>
“What?” Zytl asked in scorn.  “How important can one human be?”<br>
<br>
“The Taint, you imbecile!  Verina Tomb will have us flayed alive!” Gix exclaimed.<br>
<br>
Zytl paled.  “Wyldechylde?” he gulped.  “I just knocked out Wyldechylde?”<br>
<br>
“Yes.  And whether he is the son of Innoruuk or not, VERINA thinks he is.  And will have us ripped apart by rabid rats if this gets back to her!”<br>
<br>
“What are we going to do, Gix?” Zytl asked in a panic.<br>
<br>
“Grab the woman while my terror has its hold on her.” Gix ordered, grabbing River under the armpits and dragging him quickly from the grass to the sand.  <br>
<br>
“What’s your plan?” Zytl asked, picking up Camille like a dressmaker’s mannequin and following Gix.<br>
<br>
“Befallen.” Gix said, naming the abandoned temple set off in a hillside close by.  It now housed teems of the undead, with more joining their ranks as adventurers stumbled in and never stumbled out.<br>
<br>
“Befallen?” Zytl asked, not understanding.  Then comprehension dawned on his face.  “The well?”<br>
<br>
Gix nodded, dragging River through the pentagon shaped entrance in the hillside. “Aye the well.” he confirmed.  And through the halls they went.<br>
<br>
“Drop their weapons down first, I don’t want them catching on the sides as they go down.” Gix commanded.<br>
<br>
Zytl dropped Camille heavily to the side of a stone well, sweating, and drew Camille’s sword out of her scabbard.  Camille felt her limbs coming back to her, slowly, but did not move.  Not with her weapon gone.<br>
<br>
With a clang, the two swords of the melees fell down the well, to land with a metallic ring at the bottom.<br>
<br>
“If the fall doesn’t kill them, the undead down there will.” Gix laughed, and then grunted.  “Up we go Wyldechylde.  Bye bye!” and then the sound of a loud thump, and a loud scream.  River’s voice, that scream.  Camille almost flinched at the sound.<br>
<br>
“Nice shot!” Zytl said, glancing down the well.  “What’s that sticking through his chest?”<br>
<br>
“The woman’s sword landed with its hilt wedged between two bricks down there.” Gix chuckled.  “The point was sticking straight up.  Ok, now the girl.”  Zytl picked her up and with no ceremony at all, dumped her into the well.  “And now let’s get the boy.  He’s a witness.”<br>
<br>
Camille fell down the well as the sound of their voices grew dim.  The second she was over the edge, she reached blindly for her left hand.<br>
<br>
Her fingers found the ring her father had given her that afternoon.<br>
<br>
Pushing the face of the stone on the ring Sylver had conjured up, she felt her fall slow, as the levitation spell associated with the ring activated.  As light as a feather she drifted down into the darkness, towards River.<br>
<br>
When she finally reached bottom, she moved instinctively.  He groaned, eyes wide, breath coming in short, spastic gulps, his broken arms useless to push the blade back through his chest and out his back where it had entered.  She gently lifted him with one arm, trying to ignore the sound of his breath hitching as the sword slid inch by inch out of his body.  Finally, soaked in his blood, she pulled him free off the metal spike that had impaled him.<br>
<br>
River’s eyes glazed in shock, thumbs twitching.  His mouth moved wordlessly, as his blood pumped out of him freely.  Camille propped him up in her lap, turning his face up to hers.  Both hands cradled his cheeks.  Both hands began to glow with a white blue light.<br>
<br>
“Live.” she whispered.<br>
<br>
PULSE.<br>
<br>
With a choking cry, River’s eyes refocused, and his hands flew up to her face, arms healed from her Lay on Hands.  The look of shock was still on his face as he held hers close to his.<br>
<br>
“You saved me!” he exclaimed, staring into her blood splattered face.<br>
<br>
“Yes.” she said, glancing briefly at the ring her father had given her with a smile.  She and River were practically nose to nose.<br>
<br>
“Don’t mind me.” River said, and pulled her lips to his in a passionate kiss.<br>
<br>
She didn’t mind.<br>
<br>
For one bright shocking moment, as their lips touched, she felt a jolt as if electrical.  Imagination, she knew, but more real than anything she had ever felt in her life.  She had been healed before, magically, but the feeling that flowed through her body as their lips touched was as if he were cleansing every part of her.  Her heart felt clean, bathed in a warm light.  She felt herself melt into him, through him.  I am in love, she thought dimmly.  This is love.  All the books were wrong.  It’s not a thing you could describe.  It just…was.<br>
<br>
The kiss would have gone on forever, if a long hemp rope had not dropped down the well, the end landing squarely across the area where their lips met.  Without parting, they both rolled their eyes upward.<br>
<br>
There,  dimly at the top they saw a strange greenish light.  And in the light, smiling down at them, was the blonde boy.  He waved shyly, and then, disappeared from the edge of the well, light fading away with his hasty retreat.<br>
<br>
“Can you climb?” Camille asked, lips tingling with the memory of that kiss.<br>
<br>
“I feel as if I could jump to the top!” River exclaimed boyishly.  “What did you DO to me?”<br>
<br>
“I laid hands on you.” Camille smiled.<br>
<br>
“Laid on the first date.” River chuckled.  “And here I thought I was making a bad impression.”<br>
<br>
She punched him lightly in the arm, and they began their ascent.<br>
<br>
Stepping out into the moonlight outside, River took her hand in his.  But she was pulling him towards the druid ring.<br>
<br>
“Where are we going?” he laughed.<br>
<br>
“The druid ring.” Camille told him.  “That green light was druidfire.  I want to thank the boy.  He must be one of them.”<br>
<br>
River released her hand.  “I’ll wait here then.” he said.  “The druids of West Commons have no love for the son of Eleese, who kept them awake with her screams for months.”<br>
<br>
Camille nodded, glancing back once at him, and ran like a school girl to the druid ring.  Two women sat around a green campfire, slowly roasting a piece of meat.  They looked up startled the blood soaked ran into their camp.<br>
<br>
“Excuse me!” Camille exclaimed, out of breath from the run.  “A young blonde boy, is he one of your people?” she asked.<br>
<br>
“The boy?” one said, looking up at Camille.  “Aye, if you could say he belongs to anyone.  He appears from time to time.  He started off watching us, so we started teaching him our ways.  He’s extremely bright.  He is already casting spells that are difficult to master for druids twice his age.”<br>
<br>
“Do you know his name?” Camille asked eagerly.<br>
<br>
“Don’t think he has one, love.” the other druid said.  “At least, not one he’s ever given us.  Don’t think he has no parents either, with the odd times he comes in and out.”<br>
<br>
“The boy’s mute, methinks.” the first druid said.  “Has never said a word in our presense.”  The other druid nodded in agreement.<br>
<br>
“If you see him, tell him thank you from the bottom of my heart!” Camille said, and turned to rush off to River.<br>
<br>
“Who should we say is thanking him, love?” the second druid asked.<br>
<br>
“Camille!” Camille called back.  “Camille Wyldechylde!”  And with that she ran back, blonde hair flying behind her.  The two druids watched her go.<br>
<br>
“There’s a kiss involved in this somehow.” the first druid commented to the second.<br>
<br>
The second only nodded wisely, and went back to her meat.<br>

Through tired lids, she saw the young blonde boy’s face in front of her own, looking down at her.  She blinked in confusion.<br>
<br>
“Morning.” Grelin smiled down at her.<br>
<br>
“It’s time?” Camille asked, fog clearing, as she sat up in her sleeping bag.<br>
<br>
“Talv says we can move in now.” Rocsalt said, rolling his bag up into a tight bundle.  “Why don’t I feel safe?”<br>
<br>
“Hey!” Talvarien exclaimed from where he was nervously fingering the point on his silver plated arrow.  “You should be happy I’m here!  No one has ever gone to Mayong Mistmoore’s chambers and lived!  Did you even think once how we were going to find it?”<br>
<br>
“Good point.” Camille said.  “Talv, can you track vampires?”<br>
<br>
“No need.” Talvarien said proudly, reaching into his pack.  He brought out a carefully folded piece of paper.  “I told you.  I am always prepared for dealing with vampires.  I bought a map.”<br>
<br>
“Talv.” Rocsalt commented dryly.  “If no one ever survived going to Mistmoore’s coffin room, who made the map?”<br>
<br>
Talvarien blinked at him, mouth open.<br>
<br>
“I have a map.” Talvarien nodded after a long pause, looking like he wanted to cry.<br>
<br>
“Good thinking Talv.” Camille said, patting him on the back.<br>
<br>
They left CloudDancer at the entrance, as they made entered the area that held Castle Mistmoore.<br>
<br>
Down a long ramp they descended, to a lake outside of a tower.  But there was no movement.  Two stone gargoyles leered down at them as they crossed around the far side of the lake, giving the gargoyles a large berth.  Talvarien’s eyes were darting everywhere.<br>
<br>
“Something’s wrong.” he murmured nervously.<br>
<br>
“What?” Camille whispered.<br>
<br>
“The dark elves that guard Mistmoore by day.” Talvarien replied quietly, looking at the empty area.  “I don’t see any.”<br>
<br>
“Maybe….” Roc mentioned.  “Just maybe, all of the information you have about this place is as accurate as tales that the spectre tower in Oasis is really a portal to the Plane of Hate.”<br>
<br>
“Nono.” Talvarien insisted.  “I’ve BEEN here, to this area, before.  And there were guards here, I swear!”<br>
<br>
“Well, they’re not here now.” Camille said.  “Which actually works in our favor.  Does your map match what we’re seeing?”<br>
<br>
“So far.” Talvarien said nervously.  <br>
<br>
“Alright.” Camille replied.  “Then after you, vampire expert.”<br>
<br>
Talvarien led them deeper.<br>
<br>
“This is all wrong, so wrong.” Talv whispered, as they drew deeper into the heart of Mistmoore, and nothing challenged them.<br>
<br>
“Stop complaining.” Rocsalt said, eyes searching the graveyard as they passed it, looking for movement.  But everything was still.<br>
<br>
Down a tunnel, into an open area, and then up a twisting ledge leading up the side of a small bluff, to the porticullis leading into Mistmoore castle itself.<br>
<br>
“In there?” Camille asked, as Talvarien paused to study his map.<br>
<br>
“Yes.” Talv nodded.  “We should be safe, in there.  It’s all vampires in the castle.  They’ll be unable to leave their coffins by day.”<br>
<br>
“Ah, that’s a relief.” Rocsalt said sarcastically.  “After the insane battles we fought to get this far…”<br>
<br>
“So wrong!” Talvarien whispered, and then motioned for them to follow him.<br>
<br>
Into Castle Mistmoore they went.<br>
<br>
The palace was decorated lavishly.  Ornate rugs covered the floors.  Gorgeous tapestries hung on the walls.  Candelabras, gold torch brackets, inlaid wood furniture, chandeliers, all the signs that Mistmoore when alive lived very very well. And the entire place abandoned.<br>
<br>
“Talv,” Rocsalt said.  “This place is empty.  No one has been here for years.”<br>
<br>
“Yes they have.” Camille murmured, looking around the richly decorated rooms.<br>
<br>
Rocsalt raised his eyebrow dubiously.  “These fashions are antique.”<br>
<br>
“There’s no dust.” Camille commented.  <br>
<br>
“See? See??” Talvarien whispered, vindicated.  “Dead maids!”<br>
<br>
“Well,” Rocsalt said, unconvinced.  “Where are they?  Or was this their day off?”<br>
<br>
“Ssh!” Talvarien hushed him frantically, as they made their way down a long hall to a large metal door, wrought beautifully in gold and platinum.  “This is Mistmoore’s coffin room.”<br>
<br>
That quieted them all down.<br>
<br>
“Open it, Talv.”  Camille said nervously to the ranger.<br>
<br>
“Ladies first.” Talvarien gulped, stepping to the side.<br>
<br>
Camille shot him a look, and then, tentatively, placed her hand on the handle of the large door.  Pushing it forward, she felt it swing on well oiled hinges, noiselessly opening the room before them.<br>
<br>
The coffin room of Mistmoore was as richly decorated as the rest of his castle.  Except, in the middle of the room, was a large stone sarcophagus, with a heavy looking marble lid.  And on top of the coffin, curled in a ball, sleeping, was a filthy, long haired woodelf.  His nails were long and sharp, his hair greasy and knotted, his skin dark with splattered mud and red with sores.  He twitched as he slept, scratching suddenly behind his ear at some irritation, and then rolling onto his back, snoring, tongue slipping out of his mouth, to loll to the side.  A tattered loin cloth was his only attire.<br>
<br>
“That’s Mistmoore?” Roc asked incredulously, staring at scrawny, diseased looking elf sleeping on the lid.<br>
<br>
The noise woke the creature instantly.  His head snapped up, nostrils flaring, sniffing the air.  He turned his eyes to them, as he leapt down from the lid of the coffin.  The pupils were a sick looking yellow.  The woodelf crouched down on his haunches, a low feral growl rising from his throat.  Foam began to drip unchecked from his mouth to puddle at his feet.  His head spastically twitched to the side, and one long nailed hand reached up and scratched at something.<br>
<br>
Talvarien was terrified.  “Mistmoore is a dark elf!” he stammered, as the four looked in disgust at the snarling woodelf.  “I don’t know WHAT in hells that is!”<br>
<br>
And then, slowly, with a grating of stone against stone,  the marble slab on top of the sarcophagus started to slide to the side, completely of its own accord.<br>
<br>
“Oh boy oh boy oh boy…” Talvarien repeated in a panic over and over.  The others just watched the stone slide completely off to tilt with a crash to the floor.  The woodelf gnashed sharp, red stained teeth.<br>
<br>
The coffin was full of soil, to the very brim.  From the distance Camille could see movement along its surface.  With disgust, she realized that maggots writhed in and out of the dirt, handfuls of them.  <br>
<br>
With a sudden explosion of earth, a figure rose from under the dirt, shooting straight up like an arrow as it burst from below the dark soil, dirt running down its body like water.  It was dressed in a simple black robe, dark elven features, but skin a pale grey, as opposed to the dark blue of the teir’dal race.  His eyes were bloodred, his lower lip obscured in two places by two long, sharp fangs that resembled pieces of razor sharp ivory.  His jet black hair was combed back, full and tight, hugging his head, not a strand out of place considering the entrance he made head first through the surface of the coffin’s contents.  The dirt reformed under his feet as he stood upon the soil, and then without a sound he floated down off the coffin, landing steadily next to the woodelf.  He absently flicked a worm off his shoulder and regarded them with bloody eyes.<br>
<br>
“His hair is perfect!” Talvarien whispered in awe, mouth open, blinking.  “Do you think he uses gel?”<br>
<br>
“Shut up, Talv.” Rocsalt said nervously, hands curling into offensive weapons.<br>
<br>
“Looking for this?” Mayong Mistmoore said, voice like warm honey, speaking perfect common,  reaching into his robe as his eyes slid over each of them.  He withdrew a golden hilt for a sword and dangled it from one perfectly manicured finger.  Camille’s eyes riveted on the hilt.  Mistmoore slipped it back into his robes.<br>
<br>
“Hey!” Talvarien cried out, agitated.  “How are you outside during the day?  You should be a pile of dust right now.”<br>
<br>
Mistmoore turned to look at him in amusement.  Talvarien flinched and stepped back as the red eyes turned to him.  The woodelf snarled.  Mistmoore’s hand dropped to his side  and he ran his fingers lazily through the elf’s matted hair.<br>
<br>
“Do you really believe everything you read?” Mistmoore asked with a slight chuckle.<br>
<br>
“But!” Talvarien spluttered, unwilling to accept what he was seeing, faith attempting to justify what was obvious misinformation.  “Vampires are destroyed when the sun is up!”<br>
<br>
“SunLIGHT.” Mistmoore corrected with a sigh, waving his free hand around the chamber.  “Did you expect my chambers to have bay windows?”<br>
<br>
Talvarien’s eyes darted around the room, noticing for the first time the complete lack of windows.<br>
<br>
“I could walk from here to Crushbone at high noon if I wanted to, the way the trees block out the light.” Mistmoore informed them smoothly.  “When buying a new house, location is EVERYTHING.”<br>
<br>
Camille’s eyes were focused on where he replaced the hilt in his robe.  Mistmoore noticed.<br>
<br>
“You, woman.” Mistmoore commanded.  “You can return to your master and tell him Mistmoore and his legion decends on Freeport tonight, and regardless of any pact with Innoruuk he has formed, I will show no mercy on he who robbed me.  He was welcomed into this castle as an emissary from the Father, but his rights to live ended when he stole that pommel from me.  All of my living servants were drained and made vampire, and my undead army has doubled in size.  They have already flown by night to camp away the day in Befallen, and will strike at sunset.  And not a living soul shall be spared, until that pommel returns to its rightful owner.  Go back to your master.  I will drain the others and bring them with me for the assault.”  Talvarien’s hand darted instinctively to his throat with a gasp.<br>
<br>
Camille mustered her courage, meeting his gaze steadily.  “I have no master.” she informed him.<br>
<br>
“You do not follow Lucan?” Mistmoore asked in surprise.  “Yet you want the hilt.  Why?”<br>
<br>
“Lucan?” Camille asked, thrown off.  “Lucan D’lere has the pommel?”<br>
<br>
“That snake came here as my guest, claiming news from Innoruuk.” Mistmoore scowled.  “While I slept he had the gaul to reach down through the earth and steal the pommel from me for his ridiculous needs.  Since I have moved Black here to guard my tomb.”  He patted the foaming woodelf on the head affectionately.  “And a wise move it was.  So,  human, why have you come?”  His eyes narrowed.  “You don’t…have the blade of wood, do you?”  His nostrils sniffed the air.  Suddenly his eyes opened wide.  He stepped back slightly behind the woodelf.  Something new was in his eyes….fear?<br>
<br>
“I smell the earth of Tunare on your boots!” Mistmoore exclaimed, voice strained.  “But I do not see the blade!  Did you steal the pommel from Lucan, then?  Come here for the hilt to finish the sword?  Thought to assemble it and drive it through my heart?”<br>
<br>
The other sword Mithaniel spoke of, Camille thought, understanding.  He thinks we are here to create that sword and destroy him.<br>
<br>
Mistmoore noticed the thoughtful look on her face.  His eyes flashed angrily.  “Speak woman!” he commanded.  Camille was silent.  “Then I will pick out the information myself!”<br>
<br>
Mistmoore’s red eyes bore into her.  She found herself unable to turn away, staring back, lost in those violent red eyes.  Somehow, she felt something alien slip into her mind, picking through her memories, dissecting her thoughts.  Then, as she felt him lock onto the thoughts of the sword, she saw him relax, and his mind withdrew.<br>
<br>
“No.” he said, smiling, completely in control of his fear once more.  “You are not here with the Blade of Wood.  You want the same sword Lucan wants, but for a different purpose.”  He moved smoothly to the side of the woodelf again.  “Then I have no further use for any of you.”  He tapped the woodelf’s shoulder.  “Black Dire.” he addressed him.  “Go fetch.”<br>
<br>
The woodelf turned his yellow eyes on them, and, hunching his shoulders with a loud CRACK, howled mournfully.<br>
<br>
Hair, dark, thick, black pushed its way out of his sallow skin.  His nose, with a horrifying sound of rending flesh, pushed out from his face, enlongating, as chin withdrew with a snap of bone and his mouth stretched, teeth growing longer.  The loin cloth tore as his upper legs grew thick and hairy, the knees popping with a terrifying sound and bending backward.  The lower part of his legs and his arms withered to thin animal legs.  Under their shocked gaze, the woodelf transformed into a giant worg, a black wolf the size of a small pony.  The hackles on its neck stood, as it howled again at them.  The sound of its cry made Camille’s skin crawl.<br>
<br>
A growl from behind them drew their eyes from the beast.  Grelin was gone.  In his place was a grey wolf, snarling back at the worg.  The wolf form Grelin had assumed  looked absurdly small compared to the giant figure of the worg, but Grelin bared his teeth without fear and took a step toward the larger wolf.  Saliva dripped from the worg’s mouth as Grelin approached.<br>
<br>
“Oh you’ve GOT to be kidding.” Mistmoore commented disdainfully, looking at the small wolf advancing on Black Dire.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Grelin lunged at the worg.  Black Dire snapped at his neck, but before he could get a grasp on the grey wolf, Grelin skittered to the side, and Black Dire chomped on air.  Grelin backed away suddenly, and with a snarl, Black Dire leapt after him.  Grelin bolted through the door back the way they had approached, Black Dire in hot pursuit.<br>
<br>
“Grelin!” Talvarien cried, “This is no time to KITE!”<br>
<br>
“Black Dire!” Mistmoore called sharply.  “Heel!  Come back!”  But the two wolves were gone.  “BAD DOG!” he yelled.  “Damned pets…”  Then he turned his eyes back to the three before him.  “Well, I don’t need the worg to deal with the likes of you.” he said menacingly, stepping toward them.  He suddenly sniffed again, eyes darting to Rocsalt.<br>
<br>
“There is something wrong with your blood…” he hissed.<br>
<br>
With hands shaking, Talvarien, in possibly the bravest moment in his life, stepped between Mistmoore and his friends.  In his hands was the flask of water he had Camille bless the night before.<br>
<br>
“Stay away from my friends!” Talvarien stammered, pulling the cork from the flask.<br>
<br>
“What is that?” Mistmoore asked, eyebrow raised.<br>
<br>
“Take a bath in some Holy Water!” Talvarien cried, pouring half of the flask onto Mistmoore’s head.<br>
<br>
Like a flash, Mistmoore snatched the flask from Talvarien’s hand.  Water matted his hair, dripping in rivulets from his soaked ears.<br>
<br>
“My hair!” Mistmoore growled.<br>
<br>
“Um.” Talvarien gulped, skittering back, as the water failed to eat away Mistmoore like acid.<br>
<br>
Mistmoore favored him with a look of displeasure, then tilted the flask up to his lips.  With one chug he drained the rest of the flask.<br>
<br>
“Good bouquet.” he said, licking his lips, “Fruity, with a slight heady air.”<br>
<br>
“Uh, he’ll start gagging any minute now…” Talvarien said lamely.<br>
<br>
“You have to be the WORST vampire hunter I have ever met.” Mistmoore said flatly.  He threw the flask violently to the floor in front of them.  It shattered in front of Rocsalt’s feet into a hundred jagged pieces.  Roc flinched back a step as the sharp glittering glass littered the floor before him.<br>
<br>
“I smell fear, now, from you.” Mistmoore said, eyes narrowing as he watched Rocsalt step carefully to the side, avoiding the broken glass.  “Why?”<br>
<br>
And then his red eyes blazed again, like when he was reading Camille’s mind.  This time, his target was Rocsalt.<br>
<br>
“Ahhhh.” Mistmoore crooned, smiling wickedly.  “You are afraid to bleed.”  Roc could not avert his eyes from the vampire.<br>
<br>
“This will be entertaining….” Mistmoore murmured, and the fire in his eyes flared brighter, and Rocsalt’s stare glazed over.  His arms went limp, his whole body relaxing.  Mistmoore twitched his fingers, and as he did, Rocsalt lifted one foot mechanically, like a marionette on a string.<br>
<br>
“Take off your boots.” Mistmoore commanded, twitching his fingers again.  Rocsalt jerkily reached down and unlaced one of his boots, letting it drop to the floor, leaving him standing on one leg, barefoot.<br>
<br>
“Now the other.” Mistmoore directing, fingers moving.  Roc’s bare foot came down, an inch away from a sharp slice of glass, and Camille felt the air escape her as if punched.  Up went Roc’s other foot, and the boot followed the first.<br>
<br>
“Dance.” Mistmoore hissed.<br>
<br>
Camille’s hands clenched spastically as Roc began to do a jerking jig around the glass shards.  Her eyes were riveted on his feet marching up, down, circling the glistening fragments, as he stomped barefoot amongst the pieces.  Sweat beaded on her forehead as he danced around the slivers.  Talvarien hyperventilated, unable to draw his eyes away from Rocsalt’s deadly waltz through the broken flask.  His hands reached up for his quiver and slowly withdrew the silver tipped arrow.  Mistmoore’s eyes were bright with delight, as his fingers directed Rocsalt in and out among the shards.<br>
<br>
A howl brought their attention back to the door.  Grelin darted back through, and slowly following him, Black Dire ran as if in slow motion.  Somewhere along the way the druid/wolf had snared the worg, and slowed Black Dire’s run to an arduous crawl.   Talvarien used the distraction to nock his arrow and swing up the bow.<br>
<br>
“Say hello to my little friend!” Talvarien screamed, bringing Mistmoore’s attention to him.  Rocsalt stopped dancing, and Camille murmured a spell, eyes flashing white.  “Stay.” she commanded the monk, and rooted him fast to the floor.<br>
<br>
Mistmoore inspected the bow and arrow leveled at him.  “Is that a silver tipped arrow?” he drawled, unimpressed.<br>
<br>
“You bet your undead ass it is!” Talvarien cried.<br>
<br>
“Who taught you your vampire lore, moron?” Mistmoore sneered, “Silver is for werewolves, not vampires.”<br>
<br>
“Really?” Talvarien said, crestfallen.<br>
<br>
“Yes, really.” Mistmoore replied.<br>
<br>
“Damned.” Talvarien sighed.  Turning quickly, he fired the arrow directly between Black Dire’s eyes.  With a bloodcurdling scream, the wolf flipped over onto its back, legs kicking, transforming.  Elven hands appeared at the ends of hairy legs, trying to pull the arrow out from its bleeding forehead.  Before it could, it trembled once and was still, half in wolf form, half woodelf, blood pooling around it.<br>
<br>
“You shot my dog!” Mistmoore said incredulously to Talvarien.<br>
<br>
“It had fleas.” Talvarien muttered, confidence boosted.  He withdrew the package of garlic from his pocket, and popped a piece in his mouth, chewing with a look of pain on his face.  Then he strode to Mistmoore, who was looking at the ranger in amazed fascination.<br>
<br>
Talvarien, feeling more powerful than he had ever in his life, stepped face to face with the vampire.  Mistmoore looked him directly in the eyes.<br>
<br>
“Take a whiff of THIS!” Talvarien exclaimed exuberantly, and exhaled directly in Mistmoore’s face.  He watched happily as Mistmoore’s eyes began to drip, glazing over, and the vampire staggered back, legs hitting the coffin with a loud crack.  The stone split from the force of it, and worm filled earth spilled out the sides to pile around the base, stone chunks protruding from the earthen mound like tiny tombstones.  Mistmoore’s hands flew up to his eyes.<br>
<br>
“He’s MELTING!” Talvarien exclaimed, drawing out the wooden table leg.<br>
<br>
Mistmoore wiped the tears from his eyes and glared at the ranger, unhurt.  “You have HORRIBLE HORRIBLE BREATH!”  he roared.  “You kiss your mother with that mouth?”  But Talv was too caught up to realize the only thing he had done was affront the vampire’s keen sense of smell.  Mistmoore looked at his shattered coffin sadly.  “My favorite bed…” he moaned.<br>
<br>
“DIE FREAK!” Talvarien screamed, table leg high, rushing at Mistmoore.  Before the vampire had lifted a finger, Talvarien brought the table leg into the vampire’s body over his heart.<br>
<br>
The table leg stopped dead as if it had hit stone.<br>
<br>
“Is that a table leg?” Mistmoore asked Talvarien, glancing down at the blunt piece of wood pressing into his robe over his heart.  Talvarien just blinked.<br>
<br>
“Oh, mighty Vampire Hunter!” Mistmoore mocked, plucking the table leg from Talvarien’s grasp and pushing the stupefied ranger away from him.  “You would have more success attacking me with a spoon!”  With a loud snap, Mistmoore flexed and broke the table leg in two, tossing the pieces to the floor.  “Plus, this so called ‘stake’ isn’t even made of blessed wood!  And no, ‘Tunare bless this stick’ will not do.”<br>
<br>
“Blessed wood?” Talvarien asked blankly.<br>
<br>
Mistmoore started pacing in front of Talvarien, face full of contempt, grinning at the stricken ranger.    “So tell me, where did you get all your information, a monster book?”<br>
<br>
Talvarien gaped at the vampire laughing at him, arms dangling uselessly at his sides.  “My Uncle Lenny told me…”<br>
<br>
“Uncle LENNY!” Mistmoore laughed heartily, holding his sides, as peals and peals of mirth escaped him.  “Oh, that’s rich!  We all have an Uncle Lenny, don’t we?   Let me guess, Uncle Lenny is the one that told you about the giant snow bunny that comes before the May Festival, leaving candy for all the little children?”<br>
<br>
“It’s true…” Talvarien whispered.<br>
<br>
“LIES!” Mistmoore laughed at him.<br>
<br>
“Noooo…” Talvarien said, dropping to his knees in front of his pack.<br>
<br>
“And the jolly ogre that comes once a year, bringing presents to all the good little boys and girls?” Mistmoore continued, a wicked light in his eyes.  “Year after year, you thought the reason you didn’t get any presents was because you just weren’t good enough!  But NO.  The reason you got nothing was because your Uncle Lenny took the holiday money and spent it all on cheap Neriak whores!”<br>
<br>
“But….” Talvarien cried, refusing to look up at the vampire, hands busy in his pack.  “The cookies we left were gone in the morning…”<br>
<br>
“Your Uncle Lenny ate them too!” Mistmoore announced cruelly, watching Talv flinch.  <br>
<br>
“LIES!” Talvarien wept, drawing some string out of his pack and busying himself with an arrow.<br>
<br>
“TRUTH!” Mistmoore continued, on a roll.  “The tooth fairy?  Ever wonder why you never found a copper under your pillow, but the teeth were always gone in the morning?”<br>
<br>
“No!”<br>
<br>
“YES!  Your Uncle Lenny sold them to a toothless barbarian for a new set of dentures!”<br>
<br>
“My molars!” Talvarien cried, hands shaking.<br>
<br>
“The leprechauns, follow the rainbow, the pot of gold?” Mistmoore cried out.<br>
<br>
“No more!” Talvarien sobbed.<br>
<br>
“Drunk brownies, refracted light, and a six pack of Dwarven Ale!” Mistmoore laughed cruelly.<br>
<br>
“You’re killing my childhood!” Talvarien howled, standing up, trembling, arrow in hand.<br>
<br>
“You grew up to be a ranger.”  Mistmoore said with disdain.  “How good could it have been?”<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Talvarien had the arrow nocked and leveled at the vampire’s heart.  Mistmoore paused and then laughed. <br>
<br>
“Don’t forget to bless the wood, fool.” he chuckled.<br>
<br>
“Oh yeah.” Talvarien said, eye peering down the length of the arrow, “… ‘Tunare is the greatest’…”<br>
<br>
“Imbecile.” Mistmoore sighed, shaking his head with a grin, “You will never learn…you need wood from the gods themselves…”<br>
<br>
“Oh?” Talvarien said casually, fingers taunt on the bow.  “Then I guess this designer tip courtesy of Tunare’s orchards should do the trick.”<br>
<br>
“What?” Mistmoore said, smile fading, eyes focusing on the arrow.  A moment too late he saw the small twig tied to the tip.<br>
<br>
“Eat some Apple Pie ala Talv, bloodsucka.” Talvarien whispered.<br>
<br>
TWANG.<br>
<br>
The arrow sped through the air as Mistmoore’s mouth dropped open, plunging through his skin and in and through his heart.  Blood sprayed, as his eyes opened wide.  He staggered back, legs twitching, arrow and twig having passed halfway out his back.  Point first he fell backward onto the mound of earth behind him, arms flailing, a thin wail coming from his throat.  Camille stared at Talvarien in amazement.  The ranger’s hands were steady as a rock.<br>
<br>
Mistmoore continued to writhe on the bed of earth, and then, with a horrendous rending sound, stopped moving.  Out of his chest, where the arrow had entered, a small leafy growth sprung.  Taller and taller it grew, branches starting to form, out from the heart of the now still vampire.  The wound gaped wider as the trunk of the young tree grew in width.  Apple blossoms started to appear at the tips of the branches.  Camille ran to the vampire serving as a pot for the tree, and reached into his robes, withdrawing the golden hilt and carefully placing it in her pack.  Grelin trotted over to the vampire, sniffing the base of the young tree, and without further exploration, lifted his leg and urinated on it.<br>
<br>
“Where are my boots?” Rocsalt said in a daze.<br>
<br>
“Talv!” Camille exclaimed, throwing her arms around the ranger and hugging him tight.  “You did it!”<br>
<br>
“Aye, bastard deserved it.” Talvarien said, spitting at the body of the vampire.  “But now I’m depressed.”<br>
<br>
“Why?” Camille exclaimed.  “You killed Mayong Mistmoore!”<br>
<br>
“Because,” Talvarien said sadly, looking at the vampire with the tree growing out of his chest.  “Every time I want some pie I have to come back to this hellhole.”<br>
<br>
Camille could only smile. <br>

Appearing at the border near East Commons, Camille swung down from the horse’s back and stared at the city gates.<br>
<br>
“This is not going to be easy.” she murmured.<br>
<br>
“No.” Rocsalt agreed, counting the guards patrolling the front gate.  “Lucan controls that militia he created when the Knights tossed him, doesn’t he?”<br>
<br>
“Aye.” Camille confirmed, brow furrowed.  “The Freeport Militia outnumbers the Knights of Truth at least three to one.  It’s one of the reasons the Knights cannot take back control of the city.  But the Militia is mainly hired thugs, not like the trained Knights of Truth.  The fact that they don’t oust Lucan and his mercenaries amazes me.  It’s one of the reasons I’m glad River took me away from all of that with Razor’s Edge.  If I had stayed on with the Knights, I don’t think I could have dealt with becoming the weak force they have become.  All because of politics.  Back in the day, Freeport was a poor city.  The Knights imposed extremely low taxes, and protected it as best they could from outside enemies who would take it over.  But then Neriak grew bolder, and Dervs fell in with them, and we found ourselves needing more money, more troops.  So Lucan proposed higher taxes, a toll on the road leading to Rivervale, bringing in non-Knights to pick up the slack on defenses.  He had a solid supporter in Sir Bamible, one of the Knights’ High Council.  And for a while, it seemed to work.  The teir’dal invasions slowed, the city coffers grew fat, the Derv ambushes halted.  What did it matter that shopkeepers were paying three times the taxes, that you couldn’t walk to go fish in the Lake in West Commons without paying a toll, that criminals that you saw locked up the week before were walking the streets drunk swinging swords in the name of being the ‘new police’ of Freeport?  Dane, River’s father, was probably the most vocal in opposition to Lucan’s increasing power.  ‘He’s turning us into a human version of Neriak.’ was his argument, after Lucan’s thugs beat a man to death after showing mild opposition to the latest tax hike.  Beat to death, not for not paying the taxes, but for questioning them.  Lucan claimed the man pulled a knife on two of his tax collectors and had to be restrained, fought back violently, and was killed in the ensuing battle.  But River and I both knew Frebalin.  He wouldn’t have raised a knife to his own steak.  So, Dane was respected enough to be listened to, and an investigation began.  Before it could come up with any hard evidence tho, Lucan renounced the Knights as a ‘weak puppet force following an archaic code that would die with the old men (Dane and supporters) who believed in it.  Dane called mutiny, Lucan shouted impotence, and it was a race to see who could act first, the Knights kicking Lucan out, or Lucan quitting.  Lucan left, with his childhood friend, the cleric Brother Jentry from the Temple of Marr.  Lucan still had his men, and upon closer look, one could tell that there were far more of them than the Knights; inclusion into the Knights of Truth required you were a paladin, and that required the ability to learn to Lay on Hands, but to be part of Lucan’s mob all you needed to do was to be willing to kill when Lucan commanded it.  In a move anticipated by Dane, Lucan kept his men in place, renaming them the Freeport Militia and declaring them the new government of Freeport.  The people were confused with who to follow, but fear often is a more powerful inducement than honor, and they bowed under Lucan’s will.  My father-in-law had intended to bring in the Qeynos Guard to help remove Lucan’s foothold in Freeport, but Qeynos had its own problems at the time with corruption spreading through their own ranks.  And before Dane could arrange to ally with Qeynos, well, you know,  that sand giant in Oasis…”<br>
<br>
Talvarien looked down in the sand.  “That almost destroyed River.”<br>
<br>
“Aye.” Camille said.  “I don’t think Dane knew what he was up against when he tried to route Cazel out of power in North Oasis.  Dane had handled sand giants single handledly before, but their new leader was a lot stronger than any of us realized.”<br>
<br>
“Not too strong for a pissed off Razor’s Edge.” Rocsalt reminded her, the memory fresh in his eyes.<br>
<br>
“Aye.” Camille remembered.  “And thank gods you guys tailed River.  He would have followed his father into the grave, the way he flew out of the house.”<br>
<br>
“Should have taken out Lucan after, but I don’t think any of us realized…” Rocsalt said.<br>
<br>
“No.” Camille agreed.  “River wouldn’t involve himself in his father’s mission, knowing full well the Knights wouldn’t have followed him, or me.  River was, to quote Sir Bamible, ‘the son of a mad woman and a demon-god.’ and I was the woman who disgraced the Knights and married him.  Had River pushed Dane’s fight, he would have ended up tearing out his hair in frustration.  So, Freeport fell under the power of Lucan and his Militia, and the Knights were allowed, ALLOWED, to continue their training as long as they did not interfere in North Freeport.  Sir Bamible readily agreed, and…well, you see what a joke the Knights have become.”<br>
<br>
“Wow.” Talvarien remarked.  “I knew the town had gone to pot, but I didn’t know the details.”<br>
<br>
“That’s the problem.” Camille said, eyes hard as she stared at the Freeport Militia flanking the walls.  “People just accept, instead of doing things to change things.”<br>
<br>
“So, next?” Grelin said.<br>
<br>
“Next?” Camille asked.  “We have an army of vampires in Befallen ready to attack the town tonight, and I have no idea if they will strike without Mistmoore, but my family is in there, and I don’t intend to find out.  And I have to figure out how to get that stolen pommel from Lucan.  You guys head back to the guildhouse.  Invis CloudDancer if you would; I’d prefer the fewer eyes to see her in this city, the better.”  The unicorn tossed her head, agitated.  She stroked CloudDancer’s flank and whispered in her ear to follow the men.  Then she looked back out toward the city.<br>
<br>
“And me?” she finished.  “I’m going to run a fool’s errand and see if the Knights of Truth are interested in hearing how their city is run by a man who is in league with Innoruuk.”<br>

<br>
“Were.” Camille corrected.  “I don’t know if they are there now, with Mistmoore’s demise, but I don’t think we should chance that.”<br>
<br>
“Mistmoore’s demise.” Sir Bamible repeated, stroking his grey beard.  The oldest of the five members of the High Council, he had been the only one of the Council not to greet her warmly when she requested audience.  And his cool tone suggested that he did not believe a word of what she had told them.  <br>
<br>
“Let me see if I have this correct.” Bamible said, getting up and pacing behind the long table the Council was seated at.  “You go to Castle Mistmoore, on some quest, to recover a hilt and pommel from the vampire lord himself…”<br>
<br>
“Not some quest.” Camille said carefully.  “A quest from Marr.”<br>
<br>
“Ah yes!” Bamible laughed shortly.  “From our god Himself.  A quest you have requested not to be questioned about.  Anyway, you go to Castle Mistmoore, and with four people destroy a being that is more myth than reality.  While there, he discloses to you that part of your quest now lies in the hand of the evil Lucan D’lere, who has turned away from the good of humankind and now serves Innoruuk.  Not only do you want us to march our men into Befallen to slay these vampire, but you want us to put Lucan, the leader of the Freeport Milita, into custody for demon-worship, and turn over this pommel to you.”<br>
<br>
“Yes.” Camille said tightly, meeting his mocking gaze steadily.<br>
<br>
“Camille,” Theron hedged, not looking at her, “This all sounds so…”<br>
<br>
“Preposterous!” Bamible finished loudly.  Theron scowled; he did not like having words, especially ones he would not have used, placed in his mouth by the older knight, but even within the Council, Bamible was his superior, by sheer years served.<br>
<br>
“Lucan D’Lere’s ways may not be to our liking,” Bamible continued, glancing at his fellow Council members quickly, “But it does keep the peace in Freeport, and the city has never been richer than it is now.  We are no Qeynos; we have the Dervs to the south of us, the dark elves to the northeast and our closest ‘allies’, if you can say that of those foolish halflings, are separated by a forest they are afraid to enter by night.  We used to sit here behind our paper walls with our throats exposed, begging to be cut.  Through Lucan’s work we have become a stronghold, and have not suffered a skirmish with our unfriendly neighbors since!”<br>
<br>
“Enough, please, of making a hero of that egomaniac…” Theron cut in, anger in his voice.<br>
<br>
“Regardless,” Bamible continued, “Egomaniac or not, Lucan D’lere has kept Freeport just that…free.  Now in comes one of our prodigal daughters, with fantastic stories of vampires, secret quests, and demonic alliances, and asks us to attempt to overthrow the very guards that are keeping us safe…”<br>
<br>
“WE used to keep us safe.” Camille said through clenched teeth.<br>
<br>
“There is no ‘we’, Ms. Wyldechylde.” Bamible said, looking down his nose at her.  “There was no ‘we’ the moment you fell in with the son of the very demon you claim Lucan is involved with.”  He turned away from her at that point, as if she didn’t exist.  “It is my suggestion, gentleman, that we ask the Militia to investigate Befallen, if anything to quell the growing concern I see in your eyes over this woman’s monster stories.  As to Lucan and this pommel, if it exists at all, then I imagine her desire for it and him having it is the basis for this little attempt at character assassination, and to put no more stock in it than that.”<br>
<br>
Camille looked at the faces of the other four men.  Theron was watching them as well, his eyes darting from one to the other.  But the other three, unwilling to provoke Bamible, the oldest of them, just nodded.<br>
<br>
“Then we are agreed?” Bamible said, as Camille stared with no surprise at the three men, no, SHEEP, she corrected, as they verbally said they did.<br>
<br>
“Opposed.” Theron said, knowing it was pointless, but saying it anyway.<br>
<br>
“Noted.” Bamible replied.  “Then the plan is to have the Militia dispatched to Befallen and the rest of the charges dismissed.”  He began striding to the exit.  “If you gentlemen will excuse me, I will ask Lucan to head to West Commons with his men.  Good day.”  And with that he exited.  The other three Council members mumbled goodbye, unable to look at her as they passed, leaving her alone with Theron.<br>
<br>
“Camille…” Theron began apologetically.<br>
<br>
“What happened to us, Theron?” Camille asked, face hot.  “When did we stop seeking the truth and allowed ourselves to be led by lies?”  Behind the table, the statue of Mithaniel looked down upon them with sightless eyes, his Sword of Truth lifted high.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know.” Theron half whispered, gaze dropping from under her firey glare.  It was a long pause before he could look up again.<br>
<br>
When he did, she was gone.<br>

Tears of frustration fought their way up to her eyes, but she blinked them back.  Knights don’t cry, godsdamit!<br>
<br>
“Cami, wait!” she heard Theron call from behind her, but she ignored him, marching toward the guildhouse.<br>
<br>
“Cami!” he called again.  And then, as if gripped by invisible bonds, she felt her progress halt dead in its tracks.  She struggled to take a step forward, but his root held fast, and she turned agrily to face him.<br>
<br>
The look on her face stopped him as if she had rooted him herself.<br>
<br>
“Release me.” she said dangerously.  “I never want to step foot on this soil again.”<br>
<br>
“Camille…” Theron began, trying to calm the look of rage.<br>
<br>
“RELEASE ME.” she ordered.<br>
<br>
“It’s root…” he apologized.  “I…can’t.”<br>
<br>
She suddenly felt foolish.  She knew that.  Bamible’s mock-hearing had thrown her off so badly she was forgetting the basics.  She stopped struggling with Theron’s spell and took a deep breath.<br>
<br>
“What do you want?” she asked evenly.<br>
<br>
“I thought…” Theron began, and then stopped, as Camille’s body stumbled forward, the root spell dissipating.  He did not recast.  Just waited for her to storm away.<br>
<br>
She didn’t.<br>
<br>
“What do you want?” she repeated.<br>
<br>
“I want to know the truth.” he said simply.  “Come with me to Befallen.  I don’t trust Lucan or his men.  Someone should be there to ascertain what is really in there.”<br>
<br>
Camille stared at him for a moment, and then nodded shortly.  She turned away from him and started walking, waiting for him to fall in place beside her.  Instead, he stepped directly in front of her, stopping her in her stride.  She looked up into his eyes, an impatient query in them.<br>
<br>
“I just want you to understand.” Theron said quietly, meeting her eyes directly.  “Not all of the Knights are cowards.  Some of us didn’t move on to the military guilds or the family guilds because we believed in the Knights, and wanted to continue on with what we began as children.  And some of us, after all the garbage that has been thrown at us, the shame, the lies, STILL believe.  So, for the love of Marr, remember what we learned together, and that we once stood for something higher than all of us.  If River had not taken you with him, you would still be one of us, growing sick as one by one the codes by which we were knighted became compromised by the very men who taught them to us.  We are not all Sir Bamibles, or Lucans.  Some of us are still Knights.  We have just lost sight of the truth.”<br>
<br>
Camille’s face softened, and she nodded again, this time in forgiveness.<br>
