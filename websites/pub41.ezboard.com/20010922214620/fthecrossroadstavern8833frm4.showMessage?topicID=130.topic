I guess there was some kind of an open Hate raid going on, would explain why there was only one cleric there heh.  To make the most of everyones time for those that showed up I went over:<br>
<br>
-how to pull the lair and some simple fight strategies on handling 5+ giants.<br>
-showed those present how to do simple CR from out of her lair if you fail on Vox.  <br>
-buffing strategy.  Buffing strategy is absolutely critical vs Vox and Nagafen, if not done properly it can mean the difference between success or failure.  And no its not as simple as casting your standard buffs with magic resist and cold resist.  You must cast them in a certain order for maximum effect.<br>
-how to check if Vox is agro without running into her lair and finding out the hard way.  <br>
<br>
Well maybe some other time we can make another go at this when there's enough interest and there's not another conflicting open raid going on.  Seems like most people can't remember the last time Vox was killed on zeb server.  You know how many RBBs, Eye patches, and White Scales are going to waste?  I heard that a lot of people are gun shy of Vox now after so many failures on her partly because of the difficult CR if the raid fails.  Well CR is a SNAP if you know how to do it right, it just takes some knowledge of the game and you don't need monks, rogues, or necros to bail you out.  <br>
<br>
I know that Vox raids is kinda like College football.  You get 4-5 levels of eligibility then you don't qualify and have to move on.  Those with the most in game experience can't raid anymore and have to move on to the bigger uber mobs.  Meanwhile you have newer blood that don't know what they're doing and must be shown the ropes.  However if a raid isn't done for a prolonged period of time then you don't have any raid veterans to show the newer guys because there's a lot of lvl 52 characters that have never been on any vox or nag raids.  <br>
<br>
I could be wrong but I think the nature of the 52+ level limit on Vox and Nag means that they will most likely be multi guild/public raids for the most part.  Most guilds probably don't have the core of their people between 46-52.  <br>
<br>
So anyways next time you guys want to make a serious attempt at her let me know and I'll be glad to help out. <p>----------------------- <BR>

It probably didn't help that not enough people have started gathering cold resist gear yet, and your stated preference was 80 to cold &amp; magic unbuffed.  Oh, you were right on target I think (best I could do was 80/35 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) but that may have kept some people away that could have been of benefit.  That's NOT in ANY WAY a criticism, just an observation based on some comments I received.  I told 'em to come anyway but I wonder about those who DIDN'T comment to me.<br>
<br>
But I think you're right, the Hate thing killed us.  Those guilds WITH core 46-52 seemed to have their key people there yesterday.  I'd love to try Vox again with you leading. <p>Binnen Minder<br>

I found the resist gear suprisingly easy to get. Heck most of it was stuff I'd gotten rid of before, at lower levels.<br>
<br>
I agree with the assessment that most guilds' core membership doesn't allow for consistent Vox/Naggy Raids. Maybe I'll hang out @ 52 for a bit longer <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Sorry to hear that not a lot of people showed up.  I know that many in my guild are Gunshy for Vox .. we went on 2 raids with others and one was a 3+ hr CR... one guy had 8 corpses and never came back to the game :(<br>
<br>
BTW .. it wasnt an open hate raid ... we just called on a few people ... and I got my purple legs and boots, so I'm glad it happened!<br>
<br>
As for the CR being 80+ .. that's a given ... i spoke with some Vox "experts" who all agree, tho they never mentioned MR.  I'm sure that's right tho.  And what I can understand, you should be sacrificing stats for CR/MR.  ALso, I heard the average level should be 50 for it to go well, do you agree?<br>
<br>
Anyway, I do hope I can come next time.  Even if I dont participate (1/2 way to 53), i'd like to listen and learn. <p><body bgcolor="#000000">

I can't wait til I can go on these type of raids. Of course, I'd have to quit playing alts and start leveling up.

I can see how people can be nervous about doing Vox if the chances of succeeding are historically low and there's a gruelling CR after every raid.  However just take out the CR factor and what do you have?  You have a CR that is even simpler then doing CR from the Efreeti in Sol B.  That means all you have to lose is time and a little experience after a 49+ res or a 56+ one if there is one available.  <br>
<br>
I estimate that doing CR after a failed Vox run can take less then half an hour.  If you have just two people that know what they're doing you can have everyones body out of her lair WHEN SHE IS STILL UP in under 10 mins.  So you just have healer/caster types bind near the goblin king room and they CR the melee types, then you buff up and try again.<br>
<br>
With practice you will learn what works and what doesn't work.  With each failed vox run you become that much closer to doing it right and since I can guarantee you failure won't be that big of a deal you really have nothing to be afraid of in trying this raid until you succeed.  <br>
<br>
My personal most hated raid in its time was the dragon Hoshkar in Veeshan's Peak.  I think I was in over a dozen attempts on him before he finally died for my first time.  Each failure meant about 2.5 to 3 hours of CR and rebuff time before we could try again.  The fight typically took between 40 seconds to a minute and a half depending how fast we all died.  We just kept beating our heads against the wall no matter how much it hurt until we finally won.  That's what you have to do to get over Vox.  Once you know how to do Vox AND you have the proper resist gear she is EASY and you can reap the fruits of your work time and time again because right now nobody is doing it.<br>
<br>
Experienced lvl 50 Vox veterans can kill her with a mere 30 people easily.  It's all in the technique, strategy, and equipment.  Once you have that you're set.  With newer people I would personally want around 48 there. <p>----------------------- <BR>

A wize Paladin once said:<br>
Find a toon and stick with it to 50. Then, switch if you want.<br>
<br>
SO I did just that.  I got my druid to 50, realized he wasnt what I really wanted, and started a cleric.  Got him to 52, and am starting to think maybe he isnt what I want. SO now I toy with a 41 bard and 30 chanter ... trying to figure if I want true CC or a swiss army knife that is good CC after 53.<br>

Anyway .. find a toon and stick with it.<br>

<br>
With the right group mix, I'm positive 18 could do it.  My own goal at one time was to do it with 12 and a few high level buffers (which I'm sure is doable for Naggy, but probably not for Vox, though I think we could get pretty close).<br>
<br>
The experience and gear factors are huge.  <br>
<br>
My advice for tanks (and everyone else, really) that want to fight Vox... get an insta-cast junk buff item.  One of the high level coldain rings (8, 9, or 10).  A gobby earring.  Or if you can't get either of those, hook up with a tinkerer and get an aqualung (50 charges of breath of the dead, works from inventory, sells back to vendor for about 200 plat, probably cost 3-400 plat to buy from a tinkerer).  For tanks, it just means after every time that Vox breathes and dispels a buff, you click and put a buff back up.  You keep your hp, resist, haste,  stat, and ac buffs.  End result: you need less healing, are healed more effeciently, and do more damage.  You also don't need the normal 4 junk buffs, 2 will do, allowing for more useful buffs.<br>
<br>
For casters, an item like bracer of the hidden works well too, as casters don't have to worry about having to shift off target as much... and you can take a second to slap the clerics with it (just be sure to coordinate with the cleric before-hand, make sure it is his #1 junk-buff, etc).<br>
<br>
The basic redo junk buff idea is something as an enchanter I've been doing on Vox raids for ages... I used the recycle time on mana seive to cast haze on myself, the level 4 enchanter ac buff... cheap mana cost, low casting time, fit in just about perfectly.  End result, when combined with berserker spirit, I'd lose a bubble or less of health.  I'm sure other casters have cheap spells, fast casting, that they could use.  Of course, it works best for enchanters, as their role in the actual Vox fight is to seive, which they can do at max range, and it has a recycle time to use as they see fit. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uaxterixenobelix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Axterix EnObelix</A> at: 9/14/01 2:09:06 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm4.showMessage?topicID=132.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm4.showMessage?topicID=128.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm4.emailToFriend?topicID=130.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm4.threadControl?topicID=130.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=130.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=130.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm31">ANNOUNCEMENTS<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm8">The Tavern<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm4">Raid Planning and Discussion<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm6">Non-EQ Discussions<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm32">Thanks and Praise<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm11">The Inferno<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm7">Polls<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm5">Trader's Table<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm9">Legends and Lore<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm14">The Epic Quester<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm15">Bard's Studio<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm26">Cleric's Temple<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm16">Druid's Glade<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm23">Enchanter's Circle<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm22">Magician's Element<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm28">Monk's Dojo<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm21">Necromancer's Crypt<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm27">Paladin's Hall<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm30">Ranger's Lodge<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm17">Rogue's Hideout<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm20">Shadow Knight's Barrow<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm25">Shaman's Shrine<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm19">Warrior's Arena<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm18">Wizard's Tower<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm12">Need access to GM Den?<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm10">GM's Den<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm2">Moderators Discussion<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm13">Testing for Art</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bthecrossroadstavern8833>The Crossroads of Zebuxoruk</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm4>Raid Planning and Discussion</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://2amstudios.com/eq/">Zebu's Zanadu!</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
