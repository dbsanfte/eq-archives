But a situation had come up that I felt needed a posting.  Take it for what its worth:<br>
<br>
Many of you probably do not know of the character Fermaga, but a few of you do.  I have tried, to the best of my abilities, to show compasion and support to all who ask.  This includes my current guild and former guild.  What i dont understand, and please, i know its rants and flames, but truthful honest answers would help, is why would someone no longer want to talk to you because of someone or thing that another has done?  I wont go into details because i think they are just not worth causing more grief.  It seems i have lost a few friends by what is being quoted as &quot;Guilt by Association&quot;. One individual in particular i had shared such information that i thought we could be great friends in RL.  It was by her pain that I was prompted to post this since it was said that what someone else is doing whom I am friends with has decided to cut off all ties.<br>
<br>
<br>
This is a game I thought.  People take it to such a degree that what happens in game is RL.  Perhaps this is a sign, with me posting such a message, that I am taking this too seriously.  Just ranting a little cause quite frankly, Im at a loss.<br>

You and I have been friends in game.  You left our guild shortly after I joined so there wasnt much time to get to know you. But from what time we spent I considered you a friend.  And still do.  However, when you left you disappeared off the face of Norrath.  Everyone thought you left the game or switched servers.  Hell, someone even said you sold your account and the Fermaga in game was a different person.<br>
<br>
I have seen you a couple of times recently.  And I felt bad when I couldnt help you on your shawl quest cause I was in the middle of POJ Trials.  If I had a little more notice I would have made a point to be there.<br>
<br>
I know a little, I think (tough without details) of what you are talking about.  I know some were very disappointed when you left (including me).  I know others were confused about why you left.  But myself and most others would still consider you a friend.  The guilt by association thing is crap and is there mostly in some because they are worried that the open style of the alliance is in jeopardy because of a few that would like to take it down and have tried to paralyze our channels and communication by passing out the passwords to those who like to screw with others.  I believe you guys refer to them as fucktards on this board and I think the name fits.  So those that leave without explanation are naturally held at a distance. Especially after Joannea/Karmianna/Fanfaire/Bitch and the continuing shit she pulls.<br>
<br>
Vazelle is a constantly changing place, both in the make up of guilds and the the things we do.  People screw over others on a daily basis.  It ALWAYS comes back to haunt them.  Guilds change. Just this weekend 3 guild leaders stepped down.  People change.  The only advice I can give is stick with your friends. and those that shit on you.  Ignore them.  <br>
<br>

One thing that must be realized is that the guild you're in now was formed by people leaving alliance guilds on negative notes.  Personally, I felt betrayed, used and lied to by some people I bent over backwards for for months.  I took a little while to get over it, and though I don't agree with how they did what they did, I know why they did it and still hope that they as individuals are having fun in the game.  Now I try very hard to remain neutral and I keep in contact with some who left.  But, I have many current guildies and know others who despise your tag given the circumstances under which it came to be.  <br>
<br>
Some relationships can last beyond guild tags.  I think a person's true character is shown through their attitude and their actions, not which guild they decide to be with.  But, for the most part, members leaving guilds creates negative feelings and that's just how the game is, and for a lot of people a guild tag is all there is. <p><table width="320" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<br>
I respect you sticking up for your friend.  I also respected the people who stuck up for Joan/Karm when she was doing her Docevil thing.  Those people, RE members and officers among them, were her friends also, and in the end they were wrong about her.  Hopefully that will not happen to you, and I seriously mean that.<br>
<br>
Athaen, please keep in mind that when you say you were 'encouraged to hate' we are talking about a time when Joan was seriously screwing with Riverdane, and with RE, and with the Alliance.  When Joan did come up in /gu we didn't talk about her like a saint because she was basically putting on the gloves and taking swings at us.<br>
<br>
I don't know if any of this recent drama is linked to Fermaga or Joan/Karm.  I really don't care, and it isn't out of hatred or spite.  Everyone involved needs to get the hell over it, move on, and play the game.  All this drama is just petty schoolyard crap.<br>
<br>
With that, let me get my ass off this soapbox and go get some sleep.<br>

The joy she/he/it must recieve from all this crap.<br>
<br>
Athaen, i dont hate you, I respect you and think you are a kind caring player.  Unfortunately that is what stalkers/predators count on.  And please listen to me and weigh it with how fair, open and honest you believe me to be.  She is someone who takes great pleasure in politics and screwing over as many people as possible.<br>
<br>
She is very good at it and plays both side well.  Also, all the pub she has gotten off this board is something that seems to keep her going.  So I wont be posting or continuing this conversation after this.  I just hate to see the hate she has caused and how she has put many people who used to be family against each other.<br>
