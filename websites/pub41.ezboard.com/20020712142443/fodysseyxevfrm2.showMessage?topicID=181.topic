I have recently been removed from ody because people have been having problems with me.  I am posting this as a peace offering, so here it goes... I know that when I joined ody I sounded and acted quite bossy, but I myself noticed it too late, i mean literally an hour before i was removed.  I am not going to make any excuses for it cause I know it isnt the ay an app should act.  I am here because I want to say sorry for any problems that i may have caused anyone.  I dont ever try to do anything that will deliberatly make somone upset but sometimes it happens and i am sorry.  In the future i would really appreciate it if anyone who has a problem with me tells me so i can try to work on it myself.    Finally i would like to say that I am once again sorry for anything i may have done  and all i can do is try to change and fix it.  But since one of the problems i know of is that i dont always follow directions it isnt easy to fix when i am not in the guild, since actions speak louder than words, one of those nasty catch 22's.  Well i hope that you all can find away to give a lvl 60 pal a new home and a second chance.  Thanks for your time, Maneranae.<br>

He seems like a good kid. Yes he can be a little thick headed at times, but he has good intenstions. He was removed from game last night because of two problems, from what I heard. Well if all is true, I can see how people would'nt want to tolerate it. IMO I feel he was'nt treated in a guild manner. I have seen and heard far more worse than what has happened to Maneranae. I feel it was taken in a personal matter. He is just like any other kid that plays this game. We all want to take control sometimes, and this is nothing more than just wanting to be a leader of some sort. I feel he should have just got a warning and if the problem progressed or happened again, then I can see him being removed. Just removing him with no warning or such isn’t right. No one in the guild has been ever removed like this. I know we have to sex examples, but we also have to treat people fairly. He knows his mistakes and faults and that’s something a lot of people don’t notice because of their ignorance. I feel he should be let back in with a WARNING. Imp a very good judge of character and I fell Maneranae will learn in time our ways and values in guild.<br>
<br>
<br>
Notice how I didn’t say what happened or what the problem was. Only because I know how people can take an issue like this and flame it. So give me and him the respect not to do so here. Thanks and have a great day.<br>

<br>
As an app , if they do not adhere to the guid guidelines or if we find them not suitable, we do not have to give them any sort of spare time. If we are getting enough negative feedback from a good number of people, (not one or two) then we make a decision. <br>
<br>
I have spoken to Maner. He knows what we discussed. Up to him to correct the wrongs and if it is seen he has, then he and I will discuss things further. <p>Terenya Trueheart - Lvl 60 Hierophant

<br>
I have had no issue with Maner to either end of the spectrum, but as Terenya pointed out, he is an App, so consequently the officers are well within their right to take such actions. It is their job to watch the apps and their interractions with the members. I severly doubt that this type of action would have happened with a full member of the guild.<br>
<br>
But on a positive note, it seems that he is aware of the situation and seems willing to work on it, and as Terenya also pointed out, if he can get those issues under control we may again see him among our ranks.<br>
<br>

I dont know what you have against me.  To the issue of being removed as kolo said abouve, kolo was the guild leader, there were just problems and that it wasnt anything personal.  You can ask people in SM how they felt about me and except from a few most would give good words.  I dont remember you ever rezzin me or anything else, and if you really do have proof of me saying something like that i would really like to see it.  I sent you a tell in game to try to talk to you about what ever problems you had with me but you would not respond.  If i did say something to you i am sorry for it but i personally do not remember.  Again i would like to say that i am trying to work on the problems that people have had with me and all i ask is that they give me a chance.  I would still like to rejoin ody, sorry if this posted sounded bad, but i really dont remember any of it thuinn.<br>
