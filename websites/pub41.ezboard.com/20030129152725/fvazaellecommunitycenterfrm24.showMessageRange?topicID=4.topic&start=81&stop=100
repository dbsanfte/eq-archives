hrmmm about play time... every person who plays the game has a unique situation in their real life that dictates how much play time they get. When I was still going out with my last ex-gf I had a full time job, spent 99% of my free time with her and played EQ very casually. We broke up about 3 weeks before Vazaelle was a server. I used EQ to get away from IRL because, personally, I was very hurt by the break-up. As for my friends, they thought I was dead after 6 months after me and this ex started going out. I pretty much devoted my life to her and there was no time for friends. In the last 9 months since Vaz has been open, most of my friends, who I had actually seen and partied again on many occasions, have since moved away. Only 1 of my 5 good friends from high school still live close to me. I'm 21 for anyone who was wondering. The 1 friend that still lives here is my best friend, but he works 2nd shift, 4pm-1am M-F so there is no real way for him and I to hang out and do shit except Saturday nights. And almost every single saturday night we are doing something. This last saturday we didn't do anything, so I played EQ, the sat. before that we had our monthly D&amp;D session with some other people we know, the sat. before that we went to a local band concert and gawd i was blitzed off my ass, the sat. before that we made some home movies with these guys who are in a band that we know, the sat. before that we went to missouri to buy some good pron and some gothic clothes at discount prices ! the sat. before that we had our monthly D&amp;D session... anyway ... so saturday i usually don't play EQ at all untill i get home between 1am and 4am... i think i have a rather healthy IRL, i live with my grandparents because neither of my parents are very good 'parents' even tho i love them both... my grandmother runs her  own business out of the home so i'm her personal computer tech and she is always needing me to fix something she screwed up... i'm not working currently, and there is really no reason for me to... my grandfather's pension and my grandmother's business make way more money than the 3  of us could spend yearly... i haven't had a job since dec. 30th of last year, where i had a part time fun job at a FuncoLand. I'm doing ok imo, my grandparents do feel i should get out more and do stuff, but it's really just not fun when all your friends have moved away and the only one left you can't really just go up to his job and hang out with him there. I have no bills, we own our home, we own the land it sits on, we own our, 5, vehicles... monthly bills including food/gas etc. is something like 500 a month... personally i spend next to nothing, only on gas for my truck, which is a huge difference from 10 months ago when i would spend an entire paycheck of 300 dollars or so in 1 weekend with my gf... since her and i have been broken up i have actually saved some cash and have a pretty nice bank acct. atm and saving up till i can buy a car straight out... if i get a job that's the only thing i would do with it... i own my truck already, and it is good to pull a jet ski, or the bass boat... but i want a car for when more than 1 person needs to go somewhere with me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  perhaps i'm just rambling on now.... but i play 6-18 hours daily... yesterday i put in ... about 14 hours or so... i do it because if i decided to have a real life i know i would end up falling for some other girl, get a job to support her, be broke all the time, and in the end, be left with nothing but a broken heart... in EQ that doesn't happen to me....<br>
this is just my unique story and why i have so much free time on my hands to play EQ... others have their own stories so don't go all out saying people who can and do play 6hours+ a day have no life and l0zers, because you have no idea why they can and do play 6hours+ daily ... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The original post *did* belong in this forum, and really I was hoping not to have to move it to another forum. It was not started as a rant and I still don't think it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  is</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> one. It wsn't Krimzin's intention.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Blah.. read through it all again. As much as I hate to now, it really belongs in Rants. Krimzin, if you'll repost your notice in General or under Guild Links I will keep an eye on it. <p><table>

<br>
I am just pointing out that although there are people here that are moderators in name, no one seems to want to bother.<br>
VCC seems to have a set of rules for no apparent purpose.<br>
<br>
If we were actually going to actually apply the rules:<br>
<br>
I agree this didn't start as a rant, so a moderator *could* go back through and edit all rant content out per rule #3.<br>
Cut cut cut...  oh well, no more flamey bits.<br>
<br>
Or<br>
<br>
The first person to actually &quot;flame&quot; anyone directly on this thread was KrimzinIV (the originator of the thread).  Posts previous to that were simply goofing.  So...  the justification for moving a thread that the originator turned into a flame war seems valid to me also. <br>
<br>
Maybe I am completely wrong, as usual, but it just seems like it's stupid to have a set of rules and expect anyone to follow em when the person/people in charge of enforcing them don't give a shit either.<br>

We ARE actually looking for members, we are always looking for hardcore people. Lately it's come to our attention that some people who joined other guilds did so because they thought they had no chance at joining IV. No hidden ajenda here man, it's been talked about in guild for well over a month that Krim should make that post.<br>
<br>
As for us wanting people to apply so we can wipe them into the floor and laugh at them when we reject them... &quot;...&quot;<br>
<br>
So in closing, If you are hardcore and want a shot at IV then we want you to apply. Everybody at this point of the game is a newb so don't think that lack of experience would be marked against you. First and foremost is your attitude; How badly do you want it? Second is skill and how well you handle stress.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukaziqueal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaziqueal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 532<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/22/01 8:40:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=95>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: For those interested we are still looking for...</span><hr size=1> P.S.

<br>
But for once, I agree with them.  WTF is up with this shit?  Krim didn't post that to try to scoop up as many as possible from the Endless exodus... frankly IV grabbed a substantial number of Endless members before the guild dissolved anyway.  And I hardly think he did it to crush anyone's feelings; if anything, the opposite is true.<br>
<br>
If you still feel like flaming IV for the post, pick up a copy of the want ads and start flaming every company that says their looking for employees that meet certain qualifications.<br>
<br>
No, I don't think it's any different.  If you want to be part of IV, Krim has laid out exactly what it takes, in advance.  If you meet the criteria and want to join them, apply.  If you don't, save yourself the grief and don't apply.  <br>
<br>
Hell, you should see the recruitment rules for Afterlife.  IV is easy to get into comparitively. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a
