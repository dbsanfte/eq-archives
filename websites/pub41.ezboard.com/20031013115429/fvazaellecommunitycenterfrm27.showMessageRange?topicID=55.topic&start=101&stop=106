Watching that growing crimson stain blossom around his broken body filled her with a panic that grew in proportion to his bleeding.  Nizzre’s eyes were not focused where hers were.  Instead, he was locked on Bwael, who had been summoned for a third time.  After having his ribs crushed on the first summon, Bwael had managed to duck away from the black reaver on the second call, but the third left him with a head wound as the reaver clubbed him across the side of his skull as the ranger skittered away.  How Bwael was managing to stay running, magically hastened or not, was beyond him.<br>
<br>
“I’ve got to do something!” Camille exclaimed, more to herself than to Nizzre.  She stood up abruptly, but then was pulled down to her knees by Nizzre.<br>
<br>
“You’ll kill them!” he warned her, but she struggled in his grasp.<br>
<br>
“They’re already dead if we don’t do something!” she retorted, trying to pull herself free.<br>
<br>
“We have to med.” Nizzre said, trying to control his own hyperventilation, staring her in the eyes.  “We have to clear our heads and med.”<br>
<br>
“We don’t have time!” Camille argued, finally pulling her arm free of him.  She turned back to River.<br>
<br>
He was gone.<br>
<br>
“River…?” she whispered.  The pool of blood was still there.  But River was simply….gone.  No blood led away from the body.  She blinked.  Was he invisible somehow?<br>
<br>
“Bwael is gone.” Nizzre commented, looking everywhere.  The reaver was standing there blankly, not moving, but no longer pursuing the fleeing ranger.  Bwael simply was no where in sight.  Summoning creatures once harmed would summon until you or it was dead.  But Bwael’s body was nowhere to be seen.<br>
<br>
“What the hells?” Nizzre whispered.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the black reaver turned on its heels and marched back into the building, without a backwards glance.  The body of the first reaver lay ignored, jade reavers laying on the floor around it.  The second reaver took its post in place of the first, and stopped moving, going as deathly still as the first had stood when they first spied it through the now destroyed door’s keyhole.<br>
<br>
“Where did they go?” Camille asked quietly, afraid, even now that they were alone, to speak aloud.<br>
<br>
“Come.” a young voice said from behind them.  Nizzre and Camille spun as one, Nizzre’s sword extended.<br>
<br>
In front of them was a young half-elven boy, blonde hair unkempt, hands red with blood.<br>
<br>
The boy from West Commonlands weeks ago.  The boy Camille had saved from Kizdean Gix.  The boy who had lowered the rope down to them in Befallen.<br>
<br>
“Come.” he said again, extending those bloody hands towards the two paladins.<br>
<br>
“River…” Camille began.<br>
<br>
“Safe.” the boy said.  And again with his hands.  “Come.”<br>
<br>
“Who are you?” Nizzre asked, not lowering the sword.<br>
<br>
“He’s a…druid…I think.” Camille began.<br>
<br>
“He’s a boy.” Nizzre said. “Too young to be of much help.”<br>
<br>
The boy just gave him an odd half-smile.<br>
<br>
“No.” Camille said slowly.  “We saved his life weeks ago, and he saved ours.  The druids of the Commons ring have been training him, and they say he’s…good.”<br>
<br>
“Come.” the boy said again.  Nizzre finally sheathed his sword.<br>
<br>
“If he’s a friend…” Nizzre said.  The boy just shook his head up and down.<br>
<br>
“What is your name?” Camille said, asking the question that had been in the back of her head from the moment she met him in West Commons.  The boy took her and Nizzre’s hands and his eyes began to light green.<br>
<br>
“Grelin.” he said, and they suddenly disappeared, poof.<br>
<br>
They reappeared at the entrance to the City of Mist, where River and Camille had first met Bwael and Nizzre.  River and Nizzre were both collapsed against the wall, covered in blood, but whole.  Both were breathing heavily, but they were breathing.  The wounds were gone.  The blood would take a little more work.<br>
<br>
“You’re alive!” Nizzre exclaimed, looking at his brother with wide eyes.<br>
<br>
Camille knelt tentatively at River’s side, wanting to embrace him but afraid of hurting him after the beating he had took.  River just grinned at her, and crushed her to his body, pulling her off her feet.  She felt ready to weep and decided instead to smother him with kisses.  The young boy watched them uncomfortably.<br>
<br>
“He healed us, the boy.”  Bwael said.  “Ported us both out of there and healed us.  He’s amazingly trained for a druid this young.”<br>
<br>
“Thank you Grelin.” Nizzre said, bowing low.  “You have saved my brother Bwael and my friend Riverdane.  I will not forget your kindness.”  The boy just grinned.<br>
<br>
“How did you know we were here?” Camille asked, looking at him, breaking away from River.<br>
<br>
“I watch.” Grelin said softly, as if that explained everything.  Well, Camille thought, the druids were wrong.  He’s not a mute, but he certainly didn’t like to talk.<br>
<br>
“Well, kid.” Riverdane said, shaking his hand firmly.  “You did good.”<br>
<br>
“I’ll be back.” Grelin said, murmuring something in elvish.  He quickly shimmered and was gone.  River raised an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“Invisibility.” Bwael said, recognizing the spell.<br>
<br>
After a short moment, Grelin reappeared in front of them, lugging the two jade reavers.<br>
<br>
River looked at the young boy, who placed the reavers on the ground in front of them and stepped back away from the weapons.  Then he looked over at Nizzre, and something passed between them.<br>
<br>
“Grelin.” River said.  “You may be young, but you are skilled beyond your years…I could tell that from the first heal when you brought us to the front here.  You must be close to the level of skill where you could complete your epic.”<br>
<br>
“Aye.” the boy said, a puzzled look on his face.<br>
<br>
“Bwael, take one of the reavers for your epic.  We will roll on the sword, and we’d like you to take the other reaver, Grelin, as a repayment for saving our lives.”<br>
<br>
The boy’s eyes widened.  <br>
<br>
“No.” he said.<br>
<br>
“No?” River asked, blankly.<br>
<br>
“No epic.” Grelin said.<br>
<br>
“You don’t want it?” Camille asked.<br>
<br>
The boy just shook his head.<br>
<br>
“What do you want, boy?” River asked, searching the boys face.  He couldn’t be more than eleven years old, at the most.<br>
<br>
“Adventure.”<br>
<br>
River blinked.  “You want adventure….with us?”  Nizzre was already shaking his head.<br>
<br>
“Aye.”<br>
<br>
Camille knelt in front of the boy and took his hands in hers.  “Where are your parents?” she asked gently.<br>
<br>
Grelin just looked at her.<br>
<br>
“Do you know who your mother is?” she asked.<br>
<br>
He shook his head.<br>
<br>
“Your father?”<br>
<br>
“The rain.” Grelin said.<br>
<br>
“The rain?” Camille asked, confused.<br>
<br>
“…is his father.” Bwael answered for the boy.  “He means Karana, God of Rain.”<br>
<br>
“Ah.” Camille said.<br>
<br>
“You mean to tell us that your father is the God of Rain?” Nizzre asked skeptically.  “That you are the son of a god?”<br>
<br>
Grelin just shrugged.  Not yes, or no.  Just a guileless shrug.<br>
<br>
“I’ll assume you mean figuratively.” Nizzre said.  “The gods do not come to Norrath to leave children.”<br>
<br>
River glanced over quickly at Camille and shook his head subtlely.  Camille understood the look.  Keep his secret.  River wasn’t about to spoil his first friendships with the news that he was the bastard son of Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
“He has no family.” Camille said instead.<br>
<br>
“What we do is dangerous, Cami.” Nizzre began.<br>
<br>
“But…” River said.  “What better protectors?”  He looked at Grelin thoughtfully, as if choosing a horse.  “He is already at our level of training, from what I’ve seen.  And he’s a healer.  With no where to go.  What do you think, kid?  Could you keep three tanks and a ranger alive?”<br>
<br>
“I did today.” he said with that odd smile.<br>
<br>
Nizzre burst out laughing.  “Aye, you did.  You got us out of a mess.”<br>
<br>
“Aye.” the boy smiled.<br>
<br>
River looked at Nizzre, who in turn looked at Bwael.  Bwael just shrugged.  But it was Camille who decided it.<br>
<br>
“He comes with us.” she said, the look in her eyes daring anyone to challenge.  None of the men did.<br>
<br>
“So, Grelin.” River said, shaking the young man’s hand again.  “Welcome aboard.”<br>
<br>
The boy grinned widely.  Nizzre thumped him on the back.<br>
<br>
“Welcome aboard, Grelin.” he said.  “And now as for the loot…”<br>
<br>
“One jade reaver for Bwael’s epic, one jade reaver for Annir.” River said, “…and the sword…”<br>
<br>
“…stays with you.” Nizzre said.  Bwael nodded.  Camille smiled.<br>
<br>
“With me?” River said, “No no.  We had a deal.”<br>
<br>
“You’re our tank River.” Nizzre replied.  “You’ll need it more than we do.  You’re the only one of us that can’t heal.  So that’s going to put you on the front line.”<br>
<br>
River’s eyes ran along the edge of the serrated blade.  It was a beautiful weapon.<br>
<br>
“Just give me your old sword, River.” Camille said.  “Mine broke on the back of the reaver.”  River handed her his sheathed sword immediately.<br>
<br>
“Thank you.” River said earnestly, looking at all of them.  “I’ve never had… anything like this.”<br>
<br>
“Just be careful where you swing that thing.” Nizzre laughed.  “I think it would cut through my armor as though it were tin.”<br>
<br>
“Aye.” River said, sheathing the sword.  It hummed against his leg quietly.  “Let’s get out of here.”<br>
<br>
“Where to?” Grelin asked.  River looked to Nizzre.  He shrugged.<br>
<br>
“West Commons,  to begin.” River said.  Grelin nodded, and with a word and a flash of green light, they disappeared.<br>
<br>
Arriving in West Commons, Grelin ran ahead, over the hilltops.  He looked so young.  Nizzre leaned in to the others.<br>
<br>
“Did we do the right thing, dragging a kid into our lifestyles?” he whispered.<br>
<br>
“It’s better than him running around alone.” Camille said adamantly.  <br>
<br>
Suddenly they heard a voice over the side of the hill.  Camille recognized it immediately.  Gix.<br>
<br>
“Ah, the spy returns.” Gix’s voice carried.<br>
<br>
“Let me pass.” Grelin said loudly. <br>
<br>
“Ah, and the spy SPEAKS!” Gix laughed in amazement.  “Go run, boy.  I promise not to take you down until you had a two pace lead.”<br>
<br>
“No.” Grelin said evenly.<br>
<br>
“NO??” Gix asked, still chuckling in amazement.<br>
<br>
River nodded quietly at his companions and they stepped over the hill.<br>
<br>
“No.” River said loudly.  Bwael notched an arrow and leveled it at Gix.  Gix’s mouth dropped open, eyes darting from Grelin to River to Camille and back again.  And then, finally to Bwael and the bow.  And again to River.<br>
<br>
“Wyldechylde!” Gix gasped.  “You’re…”<br>
<br>
“Dead?” River suggested.  Gix’s mouth snapped close.<br>
<br>
“Go run, Gix.” Nizzre suggested, looking at Bwael.  “We promise not to take you down until you had a two pace lead.”<br>
<br>
Gix blinked impotently at the high elf, all the color draining from his blue features.  <br>
<br>
“He eats inky babies.” Riverdane commented, pointing to Bwael.  Bwael just grinned evilly.<br>
<br>
Gix turned tail and ran.<br>
<br>
He didn’t get three paces<br>

The hilt of the sword was still as untarnished as it was the day they had found it on the skeleton in the City of Mist.  But the blade had tasted more blood, human and otherwise, than she would ever had thought when River first held it aloft.  Adventure, Grelin had wanted.  They found it.  But adventure wasn’t just the light, frilly stuff of childrens’ stories and  nursery rhymes.  Adventures were the stuff of severed tendons and chopped veins.  Adventures were the stuff of gore.  Romanticize it however you wanted.  Adventure was the good guys doing what the bad guys usually do.  Killing.  Pillaging.  Plundering.  Killing something because it had what you wanted.  Stealing it from the corpse.  Adventure was the by-product of death and thievery.<br>
<br>
And now….now she had more ‘adventure’ for the barbarian tribe of Halas.  Time to kill the dragon.  Time to save the world.  How many barbarians would find their deaths at the end of this training, entrails strewn out on the ice, steamings reminders of lives cut short.  Even knowing you would be resurrected in the end, death was still painful.  Death still hurt.  Sometimes, coming back from the dead with the memories of how you died, cut down, burned, bled, poisoned….those memories were worse than the death itself.  And left deeper scars.<br>
<br>
Grelin and Talvarien waited for her outside her door with Brieah and Jack.  Talvarien looked slightly green, hungover from his battle with the bottle the night before.  He was uncharacteristically quiet that cold morning.  Grelin looked refreshed, twenty two years old now and looking no older than seventeen.  Had he seen enough adventure?  Had he seen enough death?  He seemed unmarked by all the pain and suffering he had both received and dealt out during the twelve years they had been together.  But that morning, with the slight headache she had from the wine and feeling the cold cut through to her very bones, Camille felt it.  And another thing.  She felt old.<br>
<br>
“So, missy.” Jack said, slapping his hand down hard on her shoulder.  “Ya ready ta teach the barbies how ta kill a dragon?”<br>
<br>
Camille shook her head.  “Honestly, no.” she said.  “River and Kaguera were the teachers in Razor.  I was just a good soldier.”<br>
<br>
Jack regarded her quietly for a moment.  “Well, whether ya kin teach or not, ya gotta try.  Or we’re gunna end up dragon chow.”<br>
<br>
“I’ll try.”  Camille sighed.  Jack’s brow furled with worry, but he kept quiet.  She wished she felt more confident than she did.  “I’ll try.”<br>
<br>
“That’s a start.” Jack said.  “I’ve been busy all night while ya slept.”<br>
<br>
“Oh?” Camille asked, wondering with what.<br>
<br>
“Oh, you’ll see.” Brieah said with a wide grin.  “You’ll get a kick out of this.”<br>
<br>
“What did you do?” Camille asked.<br>
<br>
“Better I show ya.” Jack replied, breaking out into his own grin.  “Follow me.”<br>
<br>
The four of them followed Jack down the icy streets of Halas.<br>

Vekk and the other twenty-nine barbarians who would serve as Camille ‘trainees’ stood grinning in front of a hill of snow.  Whatever it was Vekk was pointing at, the huge mound of snow obscured it.  Camille smile uncertainly, and walked around the hill to see what was on the other side, Brieah following behind curiously.  Nothing.  Just ice and snow for as far as the eye could see.  Talvarien’s teeth were chattering, and Grelin had once more assumed dog form, lying in the snow at Talv’s feet looking content.  Camille walked around the hill and the smiling barbarians, trying to see what they were all beaming at.  Still nothing.  She looked quizzically at Jack.<br>
<br>
“Um.” she started.  “What exactly am I looking for her?”<br>
<br>
Jack’s smile faded slightly, but his eyes still grinned.  “Why, we made ya a dragon!  Ta practice on!”<br>
<br>
Camille looked once more on the other side of the hill.  Still nothing.<br>
<br>
“Where, Jack?” she asked, still not seeing it.<br>
<br>
“Here!” Jack said, more of his smile slipping.  “Yer practically standing on its head!”<br>
<br>
Camille looked under her feet, but nothing but fresh packed snow.  She looked up, eyes asking the question, and then caught Brieah’s gaze.  Brieah stared for a minute past her and then buried her face in her hands.  Camille followed her look, and then figured it out.<br>
<br>
“The hill?” Camille asked, looking at the featureless mound of snow.  “THIS is the practice dragon?”<br>
<br>
“Ya!” Jack said, trying to find his smile again, but losing under Camille’s incredulous look and Brieah’s embarrassment.  “This be our test run fer Lady Vox.”<br>
<br>
“Look, Jack.” Camille began, as gently as she could, aware that the other barbarians were starting to shift uneasily.  “This…pile of snow…isn’t a very good representation of a dragon.  There’s no head, no tail.  No claws.  The mound itself is about the size of her body, but…and what about her giant guards?  Divad mentioned she has two giants with her in there and…”<br>
<br>
“Guard one!” he cut her off, patting the side of a young evergreen.  Then he pointed to a similar tree on the other side of the hill of snow.  “Guard two!”<br>
<br>
“A little off scale on the giants, Jack…” Camille tried.  But Jack pulled in close to her and lowered his voice to a suddenly harsh whisper.<br>
<br>
“Listen missy, I know this ain’t what yer used ta in the ‘civilized lands’, but it’s all we got here out in the Northlands!”  He sounded annoyed, almost angry.  “While ya and yer friends slept last night, the barbies froze their arses off all night tryin’ ta build ya a dragon ta show ‘em what ta do with it.  So fergive us the lack of some details, but this is the best yer gunna get, so at least say thank ya so they don’t think they wasted their damned time!”<br>
<br>
Camille just stared at him.  Then she looked over at the waiting group of barbarians, eyes bright with the hope of a good word.  She looked back once more at Jack scowling at her, and then cleared her throat and turned to face the crowd.<br>
<br>
“My ladies and gentlemen.  You have been….busy.” Camille said emotionlessly.  “What a fine…dragon…you’ve made.  Now let’s see if we can work out a way for you to kill it with…as little harm to yourselves as possible.”  Jack still looked at her.  “Thank you.” she added hastily.<br>
<br>
“Yer welcome.” Jack replied dryly.  <br>
<br>
The crowd murmured happily. <br>
<br>
“Ya, she’s a real killer, aye?” Brody said, stepping forward and giving the pile of snow a pat.  His hand pushed through th eloose snow as if it were a cloud.  He pulled his hand back out of the pile, redfaced.<br>
<br>
“Killer.” Camille echoed numbly.<br>
<br>
Talvarien leaned into her.  “Well, Boss, what do you want to try first?” <br>
<br>
“First?” Camille asked blankly, looking at him.  Talvarien just nodded, teeth clattering together.<br>
<br>
“First.” she repeated coming out of her slowly growing panic that they would fail at teaching the barbarians anything except how to attack the terrain.  “First, I guess, we find out whether they can shoot a bow.  That’s your department.”  She gestured weakly at the crowd of Northmen.  “Go to it.”  Talv looked over at them, set his mouth in a grim line, and nodded.<br>
<br>
“Let’s see if they can’t manage to turn me into a pincushion before this is over.” he muttered, and then plastered a smile on his face and trudged off their way with a wave.<br>
<br>
Camille looked down at Grelin on the floor, and his now wolfish eyes regarded her emotionlessly.  With a shake of snow from his fur, Grelin the wolf stood up, eyes never leaving hers.  Then with a very human-like shake of his head, the wolf slowly turned and marched off into the snow, not looking back.  Camille watched her old friend pad off down the path and disappear around a distant bank of snow.<br>
<br>
That night, Grelin did not return.<br>

The barbarians he had taken with him, half of the tribe’s warriors that would be storming Vox, were clumped in a tight group, the five watching Talvarien positioning another of them in front of the tree they were using for target practice.  Arrows lay scattered on the snow.  Camille waited until Talvarien stepped back from the man to watch him draw, and then tapped him on the shoulder.  Talvarien nearly jumped out of his skin.<br>
<br>
“Oh, Cami, it’s you.”  Talvarien sighed, exhaling visibly in the cold air.  His breath came out like white mist.  He turned his attention to the barbarian, drawing on his bow.  “Ok, Gillan, pull the string back behind your ear, but easy, and not too far, like I showed you.”  He turned his attention back to Camille, and Gillan pulled back the bowstring.  “How’s McCullen?” he asked.<br>
<br>
“He’ll live.”  Camille replied.  “Once we got him back to Brieah, she slapped a regeneration onto his foot.  The hole disappeared after a few minutes, but he bled all over Divad’s bearskin rug.”<br>
<br>
“How…” Talvarien asked, eyes weary.  “…how in hells does one shoot their own foot….with a bow!”<br>
<br>
Camille just shrugged, as weary as he was.  “Luck?” she offered.<br>
<br>
“Take McCullen off the list.” Talvarien suggested.  “Put him in the tank line up.”  Camille nodded.<br>
<br>
CRACK!<br>
<br>
Talvarien didn’t even turn to look.  He just closed his eyes.<br>
<br>
“Throw it in the pile.”  he said resignedly.  Camille watched Gillan sheepishly drop the bow he had snapped in half on top of a pile of split bows.  There were at least four already in the pile.  “Brody, you’re up.  And remember, you’re archers, not warriors, for this hit.  You have to control your strength before we’re out of bows.”<br>
<br>
Brody stepped forward, holding his own bow as if it were a live snake.  “I keep tryin’ ta tell ya!” he whined, “We learnt all we hadda when we were trained as warriors!  Pull back and let the arrow bounce off the monster, get its attention and when it gets close, chop it up!”<br>
<br>
Talvarien sighed.  “I know I know what they taught you.  But this fight is different.  We need to do some damage from a distance, and you guys are…the best from what I’ve seen to do that.  You have to shoot for the eyes, the nostrils, the mouth of Vox.  You have to find holes in her defenses and send the arrow there.  You don’t NEED to just get her attention by bouncing an arrow off her head.  You have to send the arrow THROUGH her head.  We send all of you rushing her and her tail is going to take out half of you and her breath the other half.  So work with me here.  Try to hit the tree.  Just one of you.  Please.  Try.  Or Talv is going to cry.”<br>
<br>
“Sissy.” Brody muttered, and stood up to the mark.  Talvarien turned back to Camille and lowered his voice.<br>
<br>
“ALL these guys were taught as warriors is to point the bow somewhere in the target’s vicinity, and hope it notices you when you miss.  They use bows only ‘cause they shoot further than throwing rocks, or they’d be throwing them instead to get attention.  They have no, repeat, NO skill at archery.  How the hells are we going to mount a ranged offensive when they couldn’t hit Grummus after he swallows a pickup raid?”<br>
<br>
Camille just shrugged again.  Talvarien sighed.  <br>
<br>
“Ok ok ok.” he muttered.  “But I hope you have training equally as unpleasant in store for Grelin to teach.  If I have to be cold, frustrated and miserable, so does carrot boy.  And where IS he?  Skiing?”<br>
<br>
“I haven’t seen him since this morning.” Camille replied, rubbing her hands together as the wind picked up.<br>
<br>
Talvarien turned to watch Brody draw back.  “Right, Brody, behind the ear, but not so far that you break the bow….Now, steady….ok.  Let it fly.”<br>
<br>
Brody let go of the bowstring with a twang.  And screamed.  Blood spurted out of the side of his head in a crimson spray, as something small flipped through the air like a tossed ball.  It landed between Camille and Talvarien’s feet.  They both looked down, as Brody dropped the bow, screaming as if stabbed, hands clamped over the left side of his head as blood fountained through his fingers.  His ear lay neatly on the snow between them, perfectly severed.<br>
<br>
“I said behind the ear, not BEHIND your ear!” Talvarien moaned.<br>
<br>
“BRIEAH!” Camille called.<br>

<br>
The day before, Talvarien had run out of bows and had given up for the day. fingers blue and mind fried.  He spend most of today making new ones, and would try again with his team of ‘archers’ tomorrow.  Camille had spent the remainder of the day inspecting the remaining warriors and looking over their armor, and having them spar against one another.  She had finally chosen Gregor to be the main tank, given his brawn and rather singlemindedness in combat.  She told the warriors to meet at the snow dragon the next day, which had aquired four lumpish claws, a long neck, and a tail, thanks to the beastlords and rogues who were pretty much set in what they had to do during the dragon fight.  Brieah was working with the shaman on how to effectively time small heals to possibly keep a warrior alive long enough to tank Vox.  It was Camille’s job today to give the other warriors a specific job for dealing with a potentially dangerous ability Vox may use.<br>
<br>
“We’re low on tanks.” Camille said, pacing in the snow in front of the mock dragon while the seven men looked on at her.  “And I need Henrid and Donnigar off-tanking Vox’s two giant clerics, who will be trying to heal her.  That leaves us with five on Lady Vox herself.  Gregor is going to main tank her, and Sellock will be on call as the second assist, in case Gregor falls or gets feared off or can’t hold agro, for whatever reason.  Patror, you’re Sellock’s backup, in case the same thing happens again.  If we lose all three of  we’re in trouble.”  She looked at the remaining two men, McMillan and a warrior that went by the nickname Spike for the spiked collar he always wore.  “McMillan and Spike will be the shield men for keeping Vox from casting a Complete Heal on herself.  If she gets off that spell, and she’ll try, you’ll have to fight her all over again, and believe me, you won’t want to do it.  So, McMillan, Spike, you have your shields?”<br>
<br>
Spike just nodded, picking up his shield from the snow.  He carried it awkwardly and upside down.  McMillan just stood there, shield at his feet, glaring hostilely at Camille.  She sighed and turned her attention full to him.<br>
<br>
“McMillan, is there a problem?” she asked.  She was in no mood.  Grelin had not returned the night before and she was sick with worry, plus the cold and the barbarians reluctance to adapt to a difficult task was not helping things.<br>
<br>
“No problem.” McMillan said.  “Jest not gunna use that there shield.  I need both my weapons to chop the dragon up.”<br>
<br>
“I already told you…” Camille said, tired of repeating herself.  “The rogues are going to be providing much of the damage on Vox from behind.  Your job is stop Vox from casting any spells, especially healing herself.  That requires stuns, so you’ll have to use a shield to bash her from the side and stop her from getting off a Comp Heal.”<br>
<br>
“Warriors don’t use shields!” he challenged, face set stubbornly.  “I’d be providin’ half the damage I can put out!  I’m not a damned sissy that hides behind a piece ‘o metal!”<br>
<br>
“You’re not hiding behind the shield!” Camille retorted.  “You’re using it like a weapon!”<br>
<br>
“It’s not no weapon, it’s jest another piece ‘o armor, and I’m not givin’ up me offhand weapon to be running up against the side of no dragon like a ram buttin’ his head against a wall!  The beastlords have a spell that makes their warders magic and give ‘em the ability ta stun, let them do it!”<br>
<br>
Camille fought a losing battle with her patience.  “I already told you, McMillan.  We only have four beastlords.  Two each will be on her two giant cleric guards, using the warde’rs stun ability to keep the giants from healing her as well.  But the warder’s stun is a random thing, they don’t control it, it just happens when it happens.  On Lady Vox I need men who can watch and see when she’s going to heal, and stop her, on cue…”<br>
<br>
“I ain’t no beastlord’s pet!” McMillan exclaimed.  “I’ll keep the damned thing so hurt she won’t be able to think of no healin’!”<br>
<br>
“Fine, you think you can do that?” Camille asked, done with arguing with him.  She stood squarely in front of him, about 6 feet away.  Her eyes began glowing white, building up in power.<br>
<br>
“What are ya doin’?” McMillan asked, glancing at her nervously.  Her eyes had gone bright, and vacant, as she held her spell, her magic, in check.<br>
<br>
“I’m going to cast on you, McMillan.”  she said.  “And you’re going to stop me, the way you claim you can, with your two weapons there.”<br>
<br>
McMillan exchanged glances with his six companion warriors, then turned back to Camille.  “I uh…I can’t hit ya.  Yer a womman.”<br>
<br>
“So is Vox.”  Camille said flatly, eyes glowing brighter.  “Stop me from casting.”<br>
<br>
McMillan just shifted uneasily.  “That’s different.”<br>
<br>
“Aye.” Camille said.  “She’s going to try to kill you.  Me?  I’m just going to hurt you.”<br>
<br>
McMillan laughed a short little ugly laugh.  “Ya gunna hurt me huh?” he snorted.  He looked to Spike standing next to him.  “Ya hear that, Spike?  She’s gunna h…”<br>
<br>
STUN.<br>
<br>
The blast of power shot forth out of her eyes, knocking McMillon flat onto his back.  He blinked numbly up at the sky.<br>
<br>
“You were saying?”  Camille asked.  Spike uttered a laugh that McMillan silenced by staggering up to his feet and glaring at him.  Both weapons were in his hands.<br>
<br>
“Ok, womman, that’s how ya wanna play it.” he growled.  He took two steps towards Camille, arms swinging up, both swords flying in the air in a blur.<br>
<br>
STUN.<br>
<br>
This time McMillan didn’t land flat on his back, but he did end up plopped into the snow dragon, pushed back far enough to have his backside disappear into the snow.  Now the other warriors were chuckling openly at him.  His face had gone an ugly dark red.  Gregor teasingly picked up the shield sitting on the floor and handed it to McMillan.  McMillan just spat on the ground.<br>
<br>
“I can take a womman jest fine with no shield!” he snarled stubbornly.  Gregor just shrugged with a smile and let the shield drop to the floor.<br>
<br>
“Then take her, before she gives ya so many bruises ya can’t sit fer a week.” he suggested.<br>
<br>
That was enough for McMillan.  With a howl, he launched himself at Camille, coming in so close she could smell his warm breath.  Swords flashed in the sunlight.<br>
<br>
STUN.<br>
<br>
This one pushed McMillan straight into the snow dragon.  He disappeared in a puff of white powder.  The men laughed loud and jeered.  <br>
<br>
“Will you use the shield?” Camille called into the hole in the side of the dragon.<br>
<br>
“Never!” McMillan shouted back, sound muffled from the snow.<br>
<br>
Camille had had enough of arguing with him.  “Then you’re out, McMillan.” she said, as he stumbled out of the snow mound.<br>
<br>
“I’m what?” he asked.<br>
<br>
“You’re out.  You won’t follow orders, and your damage output is negligible if you don’t keep her stunned.”<br>
<br>
“You can’t jest take me out!” McMillan protested.  “I’m a good warrior!  The hells I’m out!”<br>
<br>
“Good warrior?” Gregor snorted, raising an eyebrow.  “Ya just got yer arse kicked by a womman.  I’d agree her eyes are somethin’ else, but she laid ya out like a newbie.”<br>
<br>
“Shaddup!” McMillan cried, ramming his shoulder into Gregor.  It caught the big barbarian by surprise, knocking him to the ground.  McMillan angrily sheathed his weapons and went to storm off.<br>
<br>
“Wait!” Camille cried, staring at Gregor blinking in a daze on the ground.  <br>
<br>
“What?” McMillan asked, spinning around angrily.<br>
<br>
“What did you just do to Gregor?” she asked.<br>
<br>
“I slammed him for being a wise arse.” McMillan retorted, and turned to leave.<br>
<br>
“Can you do that too?” Camille quickly asked Spike, a plan forming in her mind.<br>
<br>
“Sure.” Spike said, and then with a move she couldn’t quite follow, Spike slammed his shoulder into McMillan, knocking the big barbarian down into the snow next to Gregor.  McMillan cursed.<br>
<br>
“That would stop a spell from being cast…” Camille murmured, half to herself.  “…while leaving your hands free to dual weild your weapons.”<br>
<br>
“Aye.” Spike said, nodding.  “I imagine ya couldn’t get one of yer stuns out if I slammed ya.”<br>
<br>
Camille reached down and offered McMillan a hand up.  He stared at it.<br>
<br>
“I think you won’t have to use that shield after all, McMillan.” she said.<br>
<br>
He took her hand, and resisted the urge to squeeze it till she cried out.  Instead, he allowed her to help him to her feet.  “Good, cause I ain’t usin’ it.”<br>
<br>
“Let’s get working, gentlemen.” Camille said, helping up Gregor.  “We have to learn to time those slams, from all five of you.”<br>
<br>
And other than the nagging worry of Grelin not returning, the latter part of the day went much smoother than the former.<br>

A light sprinkling of snow had begun to fall.  <br>
<br>
“Well what?” Talvarien asked, rubbing his hands together.  “Well, how did the day go with the Merry Bowmen?  Or Well, did you find any sign of Grelin?”<br>
<br>
“Both.” Camille replied.<br>
<br>
“Well, today I only had five broken bows and two casualties, so that’s a marked improvement.” he said, frowning.  “Once he had no more ear to chop off with the bowstring, Brody actually turned out to be a halfway decent shot.  But the rest of them?  They don’t listen to me.  I catch them making comments behind my back, calling me half-fairy, not listening when I talk, making fun of me.  I don’t think I have the respect of these guys to teach them anything.”<br>
<br>
“I know the feeling.” Camille said.  “I had the same problem with McMillan today.  Actually had to show him who was boss before I could get the warriors to start listening.  They’re a thickheaded bunch, that’s for sure.”<br>
<br>
“But you won them over?” Talvarien asked, eyebrow raised.<br>
<br>
“I wouldn’t say won them over…” she admitted, “But I would say I made enough of an impression on them that they’ll stop fighting any suggestion I make.  And in the process learned they could shift quite a bit of weight just by slamming it with their shoulder.  It isn’t exactly a proper stun chain, but the way they slam may even give Vox a pause during her complete heals.”<br>
<br>
“With the way things feel in here, they should just headbutt her!” Talvarien exclaimed.  “They could take out a brick wall with their heads!”<br>
<br>
‘Regardless,” Camille continued.  “We’re doing everything we can with what we have.”<br>
<br>
“Aye.” Talvarien agreed.  “But…do we have enough?”<br>
<br>
“I don’t know, Talv.”  she replied with a sigh.  “I simply don’t know.”<br>
<br>
“Well, it’s a good thing it wasn’t Grelin teaching the shamans to do a fast heal spam.  Half-fairy, they call me.  They’d eat Grelin up alive.  At least with Brieah, they’re afraid of Divad so they do what she says.”<br>
<br>
“Speaking of Grelin…”<br>
<br>
“I don’t know Cami.” Talvarien said, with a worried look on his face.  “You know Grelin.  He used to disappear for days on end back in the day.  And with the way snow has been falling on and off, I couldn’t track him even if the tracks were two hours fresh, much less two days at this point.  He probably just got frustrated and went to blow off steam somewhere.  Wh knows, with Grelin?”<br>
<br>
“I know Grelin.” Camille argued.  “Better than anyone.  And this isn’t like him, frustrated or not.  He’d be here, time is too short.  He may be lost out there somewhere, or hurt.”<br>
<br>
“He’s not a kid anymore, Cami.” Talvarien said gently.  “He’s a big boy now, and he’s probably off somewhere, fine.  Grelin is more capable of taking himself than WE were, even when he was fifteen…”<br>
<br>
“I don’t believe that, Talv.” she countered adamantly.  “He wouldn’t simply leave when there’s work to be done.”<br>
<br>
“And yet…he has.”<br>
<br>
Camille would not look at him after that, just stared off watching the hills.<br>
<br>
“Ok, Cami, you know, you’re as stubborn as River, sometimes.” Talv laughed.  “If  our wayward half-fairy doesn’t come back by tomorrow, I will go out in this freezing cold and search for him yet AGAIN.  But for tonight, I…must….sleep.”  He said each word slowly for emphasis, and Camille turned to him finally with a resigned look.<br>
<br>
“Aye, Talv.”  she said.  “Go sleep.  We’ll look tomorrow if he isn’t around.”<br>
<br>
“Ok, it’s a deal.” Talvarien said, turning to leave.  He looked back at her.  “You coming with?”<br>
<br>
“No.” she said.  “I’m going to hang out here a while.  Enjoy the scenery and the quiet.”<br>
<br>
“Ok.” he replied.  “Just don’t wander too far.  I hear the orcs out here can get pretty nasty, and they hunt by night.”<br>
<br>
“I’m a big girl, Talv.” Camille told him with a look.<br>
<br>
“Ok, ok.” Talvarien said, hands up in the air in supplication.  “But if you got hurt by being alone, River would come back to life just to kick my ass!”<br>
<br>
“I’m ok, Talv.” she said, gentler.  “Go.”<br>
<br>
“Night Cami.” Talvarien said, trudging off through the snow.<br>
<br>
“Night Talv.” Camille said absently, looking off into the snowy hills.  <br>
<br>
When Talvarien was out of sight, she rubbed her mittened hands together and trudged off, without a backward glance, into the hills.<br>
