In nearly every single 3rd world country it is possible to purchase vast quantities of weapons at extremely cheap rates.   Yemeni men routinely carry machine guns.  In Pakistan it is common to see ordinary people wandering about with guns.  In Pakistani markets especially the closer towards India you go you can buy all manner of weapons - land mines (3$ and up), AK-47's starting at ~25$, RPGs ~100$+, Grenades as low as 50cents!  Vietnam, Angola, Somalia, Ethiopia, The Sudan, etc, etc.  In most of these countries easy access to weapons means spit-all towards love of their leaders.<br>

Iraq had WMD's, look at the mobile labs and the documentation on chemical agents production.  There is proof of meetings between Saddam and Al Qaeda members, although far enough back, and his hatred for the US makes his support for terror against us likely, which in itself is a reason.  It's not about whether he will invade Kuwait again, the fact that he did it willingly violated the sovereignty of another nation removes my respect for his own sovereignty.  As far as I am concerned, he lost his right to sovereignty the day he invaded Kuwait and any nation that wished to had any right to remove him from power.<br>

<br>
If you are considering going to war with a country, there are 2 things you must consider.  First, you must consider whether you have the right to do so.  Second, if you decide you have the right to do so, you must decide whether you wish to do so and whether it is in your best interests.<br>
<br>
Ok, now for the first, whether you are justified.  There are numerous reasons why I believe we are justified in invading Iraq.  The invasion of Kuwait is sufficient justification for me to consider the war legal.  He does not respect the sovereign rights of another nation, I see no reason why we are required to respect his.  In the case of Iraq, we also have a UN resolution which authorizes whatever means are necessary (see Ayiar's post for the exact wording, I don't remember) to effect its enforcement.  Finally, his failure to destroy the WMD's in the presence of UN inspectors is sufficient in and of itself to bring the war withing our rights.<br>
<br>
Now, if you follow that logic, there are quite a few other nations that we are justified in invading.  I do believe this to be the case.  I believe we'd be perfectly justified in invading the Congo, North Korea, or Syria right about now (each for different reasons).<br>
<br>
The next question is whether we should invade a country.  This is where all of the reasons I listed come into play.  Essentially, at this phase of the decision making process, I believe that we are automatically legally justified in the invasion.  It is only a question of whether it's in our best interests.  The various reasons come into play here.  WMD's is one.  There does not have to be proof, we have already established guilt, now we are simply deciding on the best course of action.  Evidence of WMD's or terrorist links, a desire to free the Iraqi people, and a fear of future actions by Saddam are all factors at this point.  Again I stress that Saddam has no rights at this point for me in the decision making process.  Our decision to invade is entirely based on our own interests or if we choose, the interests of other concerned parties (the Iraqi people, surrounding nations, etc).  His actions have already made the war just.<br>
<br>
Now in the case of Iraq, I believe the combination of reasons made invasion in our best interests.  In the case of some of the other nations (Syria and North Korea), for various reasons, I do not believe invasion is in our best interests.  (I actually would support sending troops in to establish order in the Congo, but that's another story.)<br>
<br>
I hope this clarifies my viewpoint.<br>

It was stated, in very clear and precise terms, that Saddam did in fact have weapons of mass destruction.  It was stated that he had 500 tons of biological and chemical agents.  It was stated that the locations of these weapons was known.  Repeatedly.  In direct broadcast to the entire world.<br>
<br>
Unless WMD are located, then Bush Jr. is forced to admit he LIED to the American public -- and the world.  That lie is of such massive magnitude to be an impeachable offense.  It's a good thing the Republicans control both the House of Representatives and the Senate.<br>
<br>
Modified milk trucks are not weapons of mass destruction.  Exactly zero traces of chemical or biological agents have been detected on those trucks.  Without the presence of those agents, those trucks can in no manner be considered as weapons of mass destruction.  They are just trucks.<br>
<br>
Let's suppose some country is accused of creating a nuclear bomb, and the preferred delivery method is to drop it from a bomber.  The presense of a bomber in that country's air force does is not proof that they have a nuclear bomb.<br>
<br>
As for Al Qaeda, there have been exactly ZERO people associated with Al Qaeda or Saddam's administration who have corraborated the link.  The only evidence presented as proof of a link is &quot;they both hate the US&quot; and &quot;they are both from the middle east&quot;.  Those statements are true of just about every middle-eastern country.<br>
<br>
The United States has been waging a continual, illegal air war against Iraq for more than a decade.  If Iraq were to strike back against the US territory, then it would be just a continuation of the war that already existed.  It would not be an act of terrorism for Iraq to retaliate against an aggressor. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1068<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/10/03 9:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=79.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Must suck to be wrong....LIED TO</span><hr size=1> There is nothing illegal about the war.  It is entirely supported by UN resolutions.<br>
<br>
I don't believe that Bush lied in any way.  There exists the possibility that he was mistaken (although the trucks are sufficient evidence for me to entirely discount that possibility).  However, even if he were wrong, it doesn't matter as far as legality.  I don't base justification for the legality of the war on WMD's.  WMD's are only part of the equation in deciding whether we should have invaded.  The fact that he kicked the inspectors out and failed to live up to UN resolutions or the fact that he invaded Kuwait is enough for me to conclude that the war was legal.  If, by some bizarre chance, it turned out we were wrong on every single item I list as a reason why the war was a good idea (he had no WMD's, he had no terrorist links, the Iraqi people all loved him more than their mother, etc), then that would simply mean that the war was a bad decision on our part, albeit one which we were entirely justified in making.  i.e. The decision was ours to make either way, we had the authority to do it, but it was a waste of resources.<br>
<br>
To give an analogy, say you own your own company.  You have 2 great employees and 2 horrible employees.  You have the right to fire any of them.  If you fire the 2 good employees, and keep the 2 horrible employees, you are within your rights.  Your company goes out of business because it was a bad choice, but it was your choice to make.  His refusal to live up to the terms of surrender made the war legal and within our rights, all the rest simply involved us deciding whether it was worth it or not.<br>

<br>
The problem here isn't what you believe should be true; the problem we are debating is what the Bush Jr. administration has stated as THEIR reasons for the invasion.  WMD tops the list.  It was the single compelling reason for PRE-EMPTIVE invasion.  The invasion was billed as a &quot;we need to take out Saddam before he uses his WMD on US citizens&quot;.<br>
<br>
Without WMD there is zero justification for the PRE-EMPTIVE war.<br>

The US attacked Iraq for whatever reasons but is now intent on making Iraq into a democratic state.<br>
<br>
Currently, there is a desire by the majority of Iraqis to have the US out of their country.  Another desire is to bring the clerics into power.  The Iraqis are deeply conservative for the most part, they have pent-up religious fervour, and there lies a political vacuum due in part to Saddam Husseins’ oppression and the occupation of US/British forces.  For the majority of Iraqi society the only way to express their feelings is through religion.  The end-all results are thus devastating to the US.  If elections were held tomorrow, Islamists would rule the nation.<br>
<br>
The Bush administration is well aware of the Islamist threat.  If it came to fruition, all the careful planning that America has conducted will come to naught.  Instead of sowing the seeds of democracy a la American style, or enjoying the economic benefits of their oil, Washington will have to deal with a hostile regime in Baghdad that could very well lead or inspire other nations up the same path of governance.<br>
<br>
So the United States has begun countering this threat by making their own threats.  First, there were warnings to Iran not to interfere with Iraq’s internal affairs.  These threats and gestures were an attempt to limit Islamist sentiment.  But in reality the Islamic fervour gripping Iraq is indigenous in roots.  The majority of the country is Shi’ite ~70% (though Arabic Shi'ite as opposed to Persian).  To compound the situation further, Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfield directed a warning to Iraqis saying “if you’re suggesting, how would we feel about an Iranian-type government with a few clerics running everything in the country, the answer is: That isn’t going to happen.”<br>
<br>
The meaning of Rumsfield’s statement is profound.  It, in effect denies the very democratic and freedom ideals espoused by George Bush all along.  The message seems to be simple enough – you can choose who rules your country, but only if your choice is pro-American and secular.<br>
<br>
Rumsfield is denying the possibility that democracy and Islam can coexist.  This is not the first time Western leaders have made this sort of democratic value judgment.  During the Cold War our enemy was the almighty communists.  Undemocratic leaders were openly tolerated as long as communism was off their shores.  After the Cold War and more importantly after September 11th the enemy d’jour is Islam.  All manner of tyrannical leaders and governments can be supported as long as Islamists are kept out of power.<br>
<br>
Algeria for example, after decades of brutal military rule held its first democratic elections in 1991.  When it became clear that the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) would take the parliament, the military decided to cancel the elections, ban the FIS, and started a horrendous campaign of suppression.  At the time George Bush Sr. applauded the acts of the Algerian government.  In Egypt, Hosni Mubarak has been leading the country for over twenty years, “winning” every election.  Quite an amazing record for a “democratic” country.  When one looks deeper into Egyptian politics it is quite manifest that the ruling part of Egypt crushes any political opposition.  Mubaraks’ government receives the second most aid after Israel (which also openly abuses state suppression).  In Saudia Arabia there have NEVER been any democratic elections.  Fifteen of nineteen September 11th hijackers were Saudis, yet the US loves Saudia Arabia.  There are no calls for democracy from the US or 10 Downing Street.<br>
<br>
The problem is a double standard – democracy but only pro-US democracy.  The United States will not have free elections in Iraq until it can properly implement their agenda.  America will delay elections as long as possible, citing security concerns and stability of the nation.  This will only further cause greater degradations within Iraq.  Subverting or denying a proper democracy in Iraq will not stop the popular Islamic ideals from eventually taking over, whether via peaceful means or hostile intents.  I personally, do not believe in a theocratic state, and believe strongly that religion has no part in governance.  It is not my will though to decide for the Iraqis what is right or wrong, but up to them.  Like every other political ideology – socialism, communism, free-market capitalistic libertarianism, the Islam code as a political entity has to be given a chance to prove itself or not as per the will of the people.  That is democracy.<br>

  It's clear to me that you don't really give a damn what anyone else thinks Herder.  You continually put forth your premise of what the world is and anyone that dares disagree with you is but a peon who is following the whims of the &quot;masters&quot;.<br>
<br>
  You continually rail for people to think for themselves yet when people do reach their own conclusions based on the information available, you instantly strike them down as being misled by the state.<br>
<br>
  The only thing you seem interested in doing is putting forth your own agenda.  You aren't concerned with people thinking for themselves, you aren't concerned with anything remotely regarding factual information, and you certainly don't give a damn about the people of the United States because you're too all fired busy telling everyone that they are wrong should they disagree with you.  Here's a news flash for you, no matter how right you think you are, there's a chance you are wrong.  Personally, I think you're a fucking loon, but I could be wrong.<br>

You state that we shouldn't trust our government and as evidence point out that there are no WMD's found so they must have lied to us.  Then you state that if WMD's were found, we should not trust the government because they are not trustworthy.  The point is you create a situation where nothing the government can do will convince you that your conspiracy theories are wrong.  You shut out any evidence to the contrary and dismiss it as part of the conspiracy.<br>
<br>
Neibruoma, you list communism, theocracy, and several other possible government types as branches of democracy.  They are not.  Democracy implies an ongoing ability of the people to change their leadership through peaceful means.  If a muslim theocracy were created as in Iran, people would have no such power.  Thus that would not be a democracy.<br>
<br>
Anywon, members of the UN were authorized to enforce the resolutions by all necessary means.  Just because they don't specifically establish no-fly zones does not mean that they do not authorize them.  The Constitution does not authorize speeding tickets, but most of us would accept them as valid.  Second, the Bush used WMD's to make the case for the war to the American people and to explain to them why he thought the war should be fought.  However, the Bush administration always used UN resolutions as the grounds for the war being legal.  They repeatedly said they did not need a 2nd UN resolution and that existing resolutions were sufficiently inclusive.  They did want one for some of their allies as it would help politically, but it was in no way necessary.  Even if the Bush administration did support something that was the right decision for the wrong reasons, I would still support the action.  As long as the action is right, I don't care what reasoning people use to get to it.  I will go through some resolutions and dig stuff up for you.<br>

<br>
But at the same time, I'm being objective, and I would also state that claiming the weapons have been moved out of the country is absurd, too.<br>
<br>
If you're going to look at it one way, and turn away from the other, you lose credibility in your argument.  Both cases could possibly be true, one just as likely as the other, but they're both copouts.  Either the weapons will be found, or they won't be.<br>
<br>
My problem is folks stating he's had 11 months to hide these weapons, and that's why they haven't been found.  Umm, hello?  Why wouldn't he have hidden them just as well prior to those 11 months, when we were claiming we knew he had them?  Before he knew we were setting deadlines to invade did he have a bomb sitting beside his pool in one if his palaces?  Give me a break.  There's absolutely 0 logic in believing he'd hide them even better AFTER a deadline than he would before, as he knew he wasn't &quot;supposed&quot; (in quotations because someone whose life is in danger every day of his life is going to keep weapons around him, banned or not) to have them either way.<br>
<br>
It's pathetically hypocritical for someone to say planting weapons is absurd but that weapons were moved and that's okay.  If you look throughout the history of our country, there's been a lot of things covered up.  If you've ever met a direhard military personell, you'll know that they'll do anything they're asked to do.  So the likeliness of planting weapons is just as likely as weapons being moved to another country.  Both seem ridiculous, so I hope you aren't pushing one aside and supporting the possibility of the other. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1073<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/10/03 7:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=79.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Struggling now</span><hr size=1> I disagree entirely.

<br>
On the other hand, I have the utmost faith in the moral character of President Bush.  I don't believe for a second he would do such a thing.<br>
<br>
Are both possible?  Sure, in the sense that we cannot at this time prove or disprove either.  That doesn't mean they are equally likely.<br>

You're speaking of course about the individual who moved a major portion of his air force during the prior war to a country which he had most recently been at war with and said country had confiscated said air force.<br>
<br>
And to Coldhand, JDAM weapons had only been finalized in the early 90's, and if you know anything about our military, 10 years is jack shit in the grand scheme. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=204898">Ayiar Frullaniaceae</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

This is where you and I will just have to agree to disagree.  I have absolutely zero faith in the &quot;moral character&quot; of President Bush.<br>
<br>
It is my belief that his administration came to power by less-than-honest methods.  His agenda has been to push for the special interests who paid for his campaign, while ignoring his oath of office and the needs vast majority of the American populace -- unless those needs also happen to coincide with those corporations who funded his campaign.<br>
<br>
He has lied in the past.  I do not have any reason to believe he will not lie again.<br>

<br>
I just like the guy.  I see him as a genuinely good person trying to change the world and make it a better place and trying his utmost to uphold his Constitutional oath to serve the American people.  This is why I will vote for him again.<br>
<br>
We will just have to agree to disagree.  Certainly though this difference of opinion between us colors the way we see all of Bush's actions.<br>
