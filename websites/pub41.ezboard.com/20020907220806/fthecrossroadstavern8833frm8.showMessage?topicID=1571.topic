When I was starting out in EQ, I knew absolutely nothing. I had never played an online game, or even a computer game, other than some lame oregon trail game when I was in grade school. (/giggle) Hopefullly the sharing of my N00biness will bring others a few giggles too.<br>
<br>
I began playing EQ when my husband did. My cousin, his wife, my brother, and a real life friend all played EQ and said good things about it. When my husband began playing they told me if I didnt play also, I would never see him again. My first night in EQ was fun. <br>
   <br>
   He made an Iksar Necro, I made a DE SK. I had no idea why I couldnt go to hunt where he was.. I asked player after player if they could help me get to where he was.<br>
Being the true newb I was, I didnt realize just how far away Nektulos Forest and Field of Bone really were. I then made an Iksar Shaman. I played her for a few levels and altho I enjoyed playing beside him, being a leezard just wasn't my style. <br>
<br>
   I then went back to my DE sk. I got to level 4 and I was so proud of myself! I wandered into the east commanlands, and I was very afraid as most of the bears, and cats and those blasted orcs were red to me and scowling.<br>
Now I will be the first to admit I really was a true  n00b. I went into one of the huts to look around, and a very mean cleric sent me to my bind point. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     I had no idea how to get back to my body, and I was very scared. Unfortunately because I was so low level, it ended up rotting. I was devestated that I lost my gear! All of that uber leather and my FS sword rotted! After that I learned that DE's arent welcome everywhere. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
I then made a High Elven Enhantress, and gave her my name. After spending well over an hour trying to get out of felwithe I saw 2 other high elves down by the lake. I asked them repeatedly for directions.. but they wouldnt answer me! I thought to myself sheesh some people are just rude! I was about to give up on EQ altogether. I told my husband that these games just weren't for me. Then, along came another High Elf. He asked me why I was talking to the NPC's. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
That kind gentleman showed me out of felwithe, and buffed me. I don't know if he realized it, but he came along at just he right time. To him it might have seemed like no big deal. To me, he was a hero.<br>
<br>
In the past year, I have made many friends, killed many mobs and seen the best and the worst of humanity in this game. I am now 8 blues from level 60, and Kabrielle, my DE SK is 51. I was back in felwithe the other day, and I saw a young level 2 High Elven Enchantress. She asked me how she could put the game on pause. This made me smile. I explained to her that there is no way to pause it, and gave her some of my things I've outgrown. I showed her the way out of Felwithe and buffed her up. It felt good to know that I could give something back. <br>
<br>
  I got my first experience in killing a real dragon last night as we teamed up to send Lord Yelinak back to his bind point. It's amazing how things change, and how you find yourself doing things you never dreamed to be possible. As tonight marks my 1 year anniversary in EQ I would just like to thank everyone  who has helped me learn, grow and get the full experience that is the EverQuest. <br>

I had a friend who was playing EQ for couple of months while I still playing UO. He showed me some of the basics, and hooked me up with about 30 plat and some stuff to sell/trade which i sold to a vendor since i had no idea what i was doing. Made a high elf cleric with his advice and like any true noob, I put all my points into STR cause i was gonna be a Lewt Battle cleric. After learning to move around and stuff and having that money on me I spend a good hour trying to figure out if I wanted to buy cloth or that leather stuff in the shops in Felwithe and feeling real poor because I couldnt afford the fine steel that was there. Then i created my druid at about lvl 14 and later on my rogue.<br>
<br>
Ps. I off course didnt add the part of when i first bought the game I made a human Sk in one of the zek servers cause it was on top of the list, wandering around blind as a bat in Freeport and walking into the bar near the bb boat dock and getting killed by the ogre time and time again trying to get my newbie note back and trying to figure out how i was gonna get it back without that bad ogre killing me yet again. And off course im not gonna add the part of making a erud wizard blind as a bat winding up taking a boat to queynos and fighting a rat dying and popping outside toxx wondering that if i have to keep taking that long boat ride everytime I die its gonna suck. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usnootay.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Snootay</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I worship Noodleneck</span><br>  Posts: 480<br> <font color=#333333>(7/30/02 5:32:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1571.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A true newby</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> other than some lame organ trail game when I was in grade school<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
I was in Befallen right after Vellious came out powerleveling my friend's lvl 5 wizard and noticed I had some crappy two-hander from Kael in my inventory.  I had been saving it to give to my pet because the graphics were new and different.  There was a lvl 8 de warrior fighting near the entrance so I handed him the axe.  He was so excited it made my day.<br>
<br>
About a month later, I was in WC attending a doomed public Hate raid.  The warrior hunted me down in the crowd and tried to give me 70p and several lightstones.  He said he'd been saving up because he'd found out that the axe was selling for 100p in EC.  I couldn't take what was so much to him and so little to me - so I told him to pass on the favor to another young person when he got big and bad <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

<br>
 I remember starting an erudite becus I thought they looked cool and I had no clue what all the classes were I thought the one u picked was something u did not want to be and not what u were ONLY going to be that one lol  then my cusin informed me that it was most likely what u were gonna be <br>
<br>
              so I made that erudite I dont even member what class he was but I remember  starting up soemwhere in that weird confusing city (reminds me of neriak) and seeing a big illusion of a shark going by in the sky (maybe I was day dreaming I havent been back to check that out: ) )  <br>
<br>
                 but then I saw a guy in this tunnel  ooked like it had water on the ground and right clicked on the dude (guard NPC) it said soemthing considers u kindly......... and what would u like your tombstone to say so I was quick to press melee atk rapidly striking the button (continue story in next paragraph) but then it finnaly did something to piss em off and he sent me to bind<br>
<br>
                   then I found myself in toxxulia (I didnt know where I was at the time) and I was just running around in the wilderness looking for something to kill or someone to talk to then I found several sort of shrines or something and there wwere quite a few ppl in them  so i started to talk to them <br>
<br>
                   then I went out to fight as they told me to and I started to learn the basics : ) I continued to repeatedly press the atk button to try and hit the mob as thats what I thought u had to do : ) didnt know to just keep it pressed in once so freakin snakes and bats killed me over and over : ) (no knowledge   of guards either)  so I quickly got  tired of that.<br>
<br>
                     So, I started a high elf  and yet I still didnt know  about classes and such so I just pressed a button put in the stats and started her  then as I was cruising around felwithe this nice guy named sammis  gave me a backpack and some starting spells but if it werent for him giving me the spell strike and describing how to get it up and using it I probbably would not have been playing EQ  so I was using strike to kill snakes bats and wasps and things in the newbie grounds when he showed me the way there. <br>
<br>
                         then came the situation of dying and losing corpse I was always wandering away from town a little to far soemtimes and ending up somewhere and didnt know where I was and had to always have someone get me ........ I stood in the middle of Gfay with anything to aggro and keel me and finnaly found out about &quot;loc&quot; and that helped me a bit then came  me finding the spell true north and I casted it and saw which way the city was and used that to find my way home if I got lost then I reached level 5 and got gate and was no longer a problem : )  but there was always this friendly druid I dont remember her name but she would always come find me if I sent her a tell  even when she said she was busy she also helped me with money and back packs<br>
<br>
                 I was obsessed with backpacks so I could stack batwings and wasp wings to seel for silvers and when I found  some jelly I held it dear and was amased when i sold for 3gp : ) <br>
<br>
                    then came the day I somehow stumbled upon the tree city and tried to go up the lift lagged and fell to my death for the first time after all that UBER! cloth and leather I had earned some and begged for most I had lost my corpse and was not about ready to go searching  for my corpse I thought I would be lost forever so I just started ninlilai over and I had found out that u need put a little bit of points into wisdom as a cleric so I was grateful for that too : ) <br>
<br>
                      then I was obssesed with finding str items so I could wear heavy equipment and carry lotsa loot : ) and when I finnaly begged and got a fine plate  cap  I read it as it weighed 25 lbs or soemthing and was pissed thats what started it <br>
<br>
                        then some fine day after constantly sending /tells to sammis he was finnaly on  one day and I had been playing for a few months and new quite a bit about EQ so I talked to him and I was pretty much experienced in the game as he was at this point : ) and I had been experiecing with guilds I had no idea what they were when someone first brought up the subject while I was in an orc hill grp in felwithe I got invited into one and it was jsut a new chat channel for me and no help so sammis lead me to a guild called Descending Darkness and thats how I ended up in DD and from then I loved it because sammis was in it and as u join a new guild unless the ppl are REALLY friendly to newbs u are just that a noob in the guild and a noob in the game so It took some time and I finnaly started to get just a lil bit known in the guild and went on raids and such (lol only 1 though to runnyeye) when the base of the guild now were all ll 35's or around there  and then when I took a break from EQ for a month or 2 for RL situations I came back to them all being around lvl 45 and I was like sheesh guys! and  tried and started to catch up : ) and thats pretty much all of my n00b tale and  when my feeling of the game acutally being my life 9that merchant and town theme music really does soemthing to you!) ended  <br>
                             hehe well thats my story,<br>

I figured that was only for melee types.  Why, afterall, would a magic user need armor?<br>
<br>
My entire base of experience with fantasy was from the Dragonlance novels.  That was it.  Never played any other RPGs (still dont like em) or read any other fantasy stuff.  I figured since Raistlin Majere wore a robe, that was all a caster needed!<br>
<br>
My entire base of experience in video games was my old 8-bit Nintendo and Starcraft.  Starcraft was the shit, btw.<br>
<br>
I remember how awestruck I was when I got to stand next to a 50+ character.  I remember how grateful I was that a lvl 48 Gnomish mage took the time to help me get all the items I needed from Najena for my pet focus items, and how astounded I was when a lvl 55 (55!!!) Warrior guided me through Permafrost to help me get some ice goblin skin for my Robe of the Elements.<br>
<br>
I remember how scared I was the first time I went into Qeynos hills to hunt rabid wolves and bears.  (I still feel that way in some zones <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )  The great times grouping in Rathe Mtns, absolutely in disbelief that a group could kill a GIANT, and being astounded that anything in all of Norrath could drop 40pp at a whack!  Good times.<br>
<br>
The other day I gave a young mage my old stein of mogguk and my Robe of the Elements (which took DAYS and many deaths to quest for), and like 50pp.  I just happened to be in Erudin and he sent me an extremely polite tell asking how he was supposed to make money to buy spells.  He only had a few of his spells up to that point, and couldn't afford his first pet series.  He didn't want to take any of the things I offered him, saying that it would be &quot;quite some time&quot; before he could pay me back.  I assured him that I wanted him to have these things, and the best way he could repay me was to pass them along to some other young mage when he was big and bad and uber.  I really got a kick out of that.<br>
<br>
Sometimes I get really burned out on this game.  Especially on all the retards that used to beg in EC, the n00bs demanding Aegolism or KEI that dont even know what the f**k KEI stands for, muchless what is involved in getting a spell like that.  Or the 20somethings in LOIO that will turn down any rez below 96%.  I didn't even know what a rez was until I was well into my 40's!  But then you find someone like this guy, who was obviously just starting the game, and was so grateful that I would give him something that, to me, wasnt really that big of a deal.  <br>
<br>
I dunno, I think I've just been getting sentimental about this game lately, for alot of different reasons.  Lots of good, lots of bad...but it's great to read stuff like this and see that I wasn't the only clueless n00ber wandering Norrath.<br>

I remember watching my room mate play EQ.  He was a barbarian warrior running around in the madness that was BB back then.  I couldn't believe he even knew how to find it.  I decided to try it out.  I made a druid named Siffu and wandered over to Qeynos at level one to see the sights.  Saw some human sitting in front of the gates and he was injured, so I spent all my mana healing him up.  He thanked me and gave me a RUSTY MACE!  I thought, OMG, druids rock cause they can heal.  I wielded that rusty mace with pride.  Around level 3 I made the mistake of swimming in the pond outside the monk's guild and zoned into the sewers and drowned.  Not knowing how to get back to Qeynos, I went right from Surefall instead of left at night and discovered Varsoon the Undying.  Seven corpses later, I gave up on finding all my gear in Qeynos, and concentrated harder on getting powerful enough to kill Varsoon.  <br>
<br>
I remember doing the Clothspinner quest at 5th level to watch Milea get killed by a guard, much to my horror.  I thought he was gonna get me next.  I was petrified and with shaky hands managed to gate back to the safety of Qeynos Hills.  <br>
<br>
Around 8th level I decided to hunt with my room mate who said he was raking in the cash killing Orc Centurions in Faydark.  The run from Qeynos to Freeport was probably the most horrifying and wonderful experience of all time.  WC with no one in the zone, hill giants running rampant, EC with no auction spam, Ek and all those evil eyes...the newness was amazing.  Didn't even know anything about zone walls, I thought I was supposed to take the roads hehe.  Met my buddy in Freeport and we proceeded to take the boat.  Stopped off on the island with Zachariah and buy supplies not realizing that the boat would leave us.  For about an hour we sat at the docks waiting for it to come back around, and by then we were both giddy.  We roleplayed two people stuck on an island for years and bickered in shouts, much to the laughter of the people coming on the boat.  Ended up walking on the boat very polite and cheerful, which sent them into more laughter.  A high level druid, 14th, gave us sow at the docks...we were ubah.  We stopped in front of Kaladim to take a screenshot and recruited a d0rf to pose with us. =)  I remember the awe I felt as I looked at the tree city of Kelethin for the first time, and we offered about 5gp for me to get bound there.  Elfane, an ubah level 12 enchanter was happy to help us out.  Thanks again Elfane hehehe.  I will never forget that trip.<br>
<br>
When I am feeling a bit melancholy, I will go to the newbie zones and help them out.  I used to twink baby druids with leather armor and tell them it was a druid tradition.  I wonder how many continued it. =)  Helping anyone high level or low level is still gives so much gratification.  I just had a friend move over to our server, and he was shocked at how much we as a server help each other.  I think most of us still remember what it was like to be a newbie.  Regardless of the disagreements, this is still a great server with some really great people.  <br>
<br>

I've done much research on the game beforehand, classes/races/zones &amp; such, and ran the tutorial that came with it so I knew how to move around, melee and mem/cast spells. I suppose my first experience with EQ was much more favorable than most then, since I was still a true newbie but I wasn't handicapped by the fact that I was too lazy to learn how to play the game.<br>
Anyway, I started an erudite wizard, Makala. The first hing I did was destroy my newbie note... the tutorial didn't mention a thing about them (DOH!).  I tried hunting in tox forest, but being blind as a bat in a virtually empty zone didn't help a bit. So I got myself on a boat to Qeynos, and sent a friend who played on the same server (he was uber - lvl 34 iksar shaman!) a tell saying the boat wasn't here, what was going on? He told me to wait, and once I got bored of waiting and asked how long does the boat take, he said &quot;welcome to EQ!&quot;<br>
I remember arriving in Qeynos and asking some person for a bind... I must've said or did some really dumb things, since they immediately realized I was a newb and were kind enough to take some 15 minutes to help me get acclimated and answer some questions about the game.<br>
I used to play games like Quake2 etc. until then, and people playing them as well as hanging out on IRC tend to be quite rude - nmy experience with EQ ran contrary to all that, and I loved it. I mean, if I joined a Quake2 server and admitted it was my first time playing the game, I'd likely have gotten booted off the server. Nobody wants a newbie stinking up their team there, whereas in EQ people would go out of their way to help...<br>
There were a few milestones I'll always treasure - buying my first robe (the training one in the guild, it looked COOL!), running down the road out of Qeynos and finding out that there was another zone past it (wow!), trying to find Blackburrow with a friend - at night, with no night vision whatsoever. Being scared out of my with when I first zoned into Blackburrow, and when I got lost there at night (I hugged the wall about 10 feet from the entrance and waited for morning, hoping &amp; praying that nothing would eat me in the meantime).<br>
