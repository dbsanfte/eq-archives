We orchestrated an almost perfect break-in to the NE corner camp location. There were only 3 deaths upon break in (Woot!). However, shortly after Fantasy set up camp, the Synchronicity guild also ported up to POH and true to previous threats from Ryonea (the Synchronicity Guild Leader) a player from Synchronicity trained the Fantasy camp and caused a wipeout.<br>
<br>
On Friday, Benoir, our raid leader, had discussed the POH raid with Ryonea and we were going to share spawns in POH: one guild in sw corner and one guild in ne corner. Seemed to be a reasonable compromise and I considered the controversy closed. However, prior to the POH raid on Saturday, for reasons unknown to me, Ryonea started badgering me with rude, insulting and threatening tells. Ryonea at one point told me (quote) “we will port up over your corpses if you go to POH.” I ignored the tells as I was extremely busy helping organize our raid. I guess I should have paid more attention to the jerk guild leader from Synchronicity.<br>
<br>
The train from Synchronicity that wiped out Fantasy was clearly intentional and was a crippling blow to our raid. Synchronicity was camping the SW corner spot. Everyone knows to die in place when aggroed in the planes. Yet this Synchronicity member ran in the opposite direction from the Synchronicity camp all the way from the portal area to our camp in the NE corner, aggroing mobs along the way and died only a few feet from our camp causing the mobs to aggro and kill all Fantasy raid members. <br>
<br>
I will not forgive Ryonea for the pre-raid threats, his/her unsportsmanlike conduct, and for the initial train that helped ruined our fun planned raid. Ryonea and the shitty player that trained us have been formally reported to Verant. Synchronicity, and especially Ryonea, are personae non-gratis and are hereby officially declared unwelcomed foes in Fantasy Circles. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umijac.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mijac</A> at: 9/9/01 6:08:48 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uparaus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Paraus</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://members.dencity.com/pactum\images\pactum.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/9/01 4:04:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=128.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pactum.homestead.com/files/parsmall.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Synchronicity Personae non-gratis</span><hr size=1> hail,<br>
<br>
first off i would like to apologize for your wipe outs, i was not there in hate but this is what i know of it. some members got lost heading to ne corner, although they been told where to go since for few it was their first hate, these things seems to happen, and i am sure it was not intentional.  I know in my heart that they would not dare to train other folks, as it goes against what we stand for. well bout ryonea i have no idea what happend between u 2 so i will not be part of it, but as far as ive heard was that we posted the raid ahead of the time in this board and u told her its ffa so vcc posting doesnt count. last thing ive heard was that she had no choice but to compromise. but that is all i know of it.. i do know that some guilds in Vazaelle go by ffa rule, but does not mean we all have to jump over the bridge. i would like to apologize again and hope taht we can use this brd to give heads up where other ppl are raiding so that mistakes like this wont happen. <br>
<br>
thank you<br>
<br>
fyi-think this should go to rants section:) <p><font color=red>Paraus Pactum</font><BR></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uparaus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Paraus</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://members.dencity.com/pactum\images\pactum.gif" BORDER=0> at: 9/9/01 2:08:40 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umijac.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mijac</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/10/01 8:55:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=128.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Synchronicity Personae non-gratis</span><hr size=1> Thanks for taking time to post and for the apology. However, you are badly mistaken if you think the Synchronicity train that wiped out fantasy was an accident.<br>
<br>
Kuros is a member of Synchronicity and was a good friend of mine until this incident in POH. Kuros and I grew up together and hunted as youngsters in tox forest.  He is the 52 Necro that came to the NE corner to drag back the body of the shitty Synchronicity player that trained us.  <br>
<br>
I asked Kuros about the incident and he lied to me coyly saying it might have been a mistake. Kuros and I both know what happened and why. Ryonea also played dumb and lied when I ask why one of their members brought a train of mobs all the way to the NE corner (after all it's not like they didn't know what they were doing). Just before I put Ryonea on permanent ignore he/she said in a tell to me, &quot; I don't know what you are talking about (referring to the train). We are camping the SW corner.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't know if you are a member of Snychronicity or not. However, players who choose to retain membership in a guild with a jerk leader that intentionally and egregiously violates Everquest Rules of Conduct will not be welcomed in Fantasy circles. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umijac.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mijac</A> at: 9/10/01 6:58:23 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usiggymk5.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SiggyMk5</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 311<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/10/01 8:58:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=128.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www-scf.usc.edu/~rabiega/sigs/icon.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Synchronicity Personae non-gratis</span><hr size=1> WTB mod abilities to move this to rants. <p><p><center><img src="http://www-scf.usc.edu/~rabiega/sigs/april.jpg"><br><i>Sslanis Soulforge<br>It's not whose habitat it is, it's how hard you hit it</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uryoneagravespawn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RyoneaGravespawn</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://members.dencity.com/pactum/synch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/10/01 9:55:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=128.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.synchronicity-vazaelle.com/vege1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Synchronicity Personae non-gratis</span><hr size=1> First off, Mijac, I apologize for our little preraid discussion. It, however, was not one sided, we were both at it so do NOT solely blame it on me. Things got heated, we both said some stuff back and forth, it happens, people DO argue.<br>
OK what is annoying me the most here, is the two people you are accusing of training you are two of the nicest people I know in EQ. Kolianu, got lost during the breakin, she is a planar n00b, it happens... she got lost, didnt stand and die when she got aggroed, and ran to your camp. Intentional? NO it was not intentional, Koli is a sweet person and would not do such a thing. I will NOT try and smooth things over with Fantasy if you call her a shitty person once again. Also, Kuros is a great guy, he was on CR, did not train you... where you got that idea from I do not know.<br>
But I do know this. WE were going to take the harder breakin, the NE corner. Somehow, you guys decided you will take this corner at last minute, after Benoir informed me of the SW corner breakin you guys were doing. You chose something your guild could not handle. NE corner breakin requires you to break a rev house (with a spite golem add), you only had one warrior there, how do you expect to survive with one warrior in PoH? You did not have the numbers nor the tactics ready for the NE breakin, why you did this, I do not have a clue. So, we came in took SW corner, and did fine. You had a hard breakin, it went bad so now you blame me. Well sir, things go shitty sometimes, but try putting the blame on yourself being just plain stubborn.<br>
Also, later on, we CRed some of your members that had lost corpses in PoH, and even I myself participated in bringing back corpses of Fantasy members, but you obviously ignore this and concentrate on ignoring me and being stubborn. I even died at your corpse trying to get some of your members to try and get you to consent me (damn second floor mobs HTed me from the port in!!) but you didnt want the help I guess. Only wished to take out your frustration on me.<br>
As far as Im concerned, this issue is closed... I talked with Benoir, and I want to smooth things over, then I come here and see this. PoH is a bitch, last patch they buffed the MR on mobs even more, and it seems the drops have become more rare. I wanted to patch things up with you guys, your guildmates and Benoir seem to agree, maybe doing a joint PoH raid and helping eachother instead of fighting against eachother. However, you, Fantasy's guild leader, wish not to. Why? I dont know. Stop being so freakin stubborn, lets work something out.<br>

Before you post flames about others try talking to them directly.<br>
<br>
Kolianu. On many of occasions has logged her alt to port guild and non guild members for various reasons. Has also been the first to volunteer to help on many occasions for others at no expense for herself. Has shown great loyalty and freindship to all she encounters until proven otherwise.<br>
<br>
Kuros. The king of all CRs. Countless times has recruited others from the guild to help out on CRs. Has logged many ours farming peices of equipment for guild and non guild groups. Passed on many rolls so that others can receive loots. Donated many skill trades at cost or at a loss to himself so that others may benefit.<br>
<br>
As far as Ryonea and the conversation you two had gos *shrug*  we cant say anything about that as we were not privy to that information. I would ask that we resolve this in a differant forum. Synchronicity has a website that you could have vented on first B4 coming to an open forum like this. We appreciate a little tact and a chance to answer any of your concerns first B4 it snowballs into something other than what it really is....a misunderstanding.<br>
<br>
I assure you Mijac, that thrre was no deliberate trains on your guild. If there were and we knew about it i can tell you that i and many others would have no part in that kind of game play and would not be in this guild. We pride ourselves on strict rules and regulations. Though some of us have worse tempers than others and we do allow for some venting but not on a server board. We are mostly long time gamers with multiple high level characters. Please give us the benefit of the doubt when it comes to training a high level zone on someones multiple party.<br>
<br>
We are sorry for your misfortunes and would like to patch any and all problems you have with our guild. Please contact our website or the officers of synch in game for any info you feel is revelant to the issues at hand. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uparaus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Paraus</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://members.dencity.com/pactum\images\pactum.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/10/01 4:08:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=128.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pactum.homestead.com/files/parsmall.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Synchronicity Personae non-gratis</span><hr size=1> ok i wasnt gonna post but u are putting 2 of  my best buds down. first off koli, would NEVER EVER train, she rather give her life to save other, i know cause she did for me, and i know her from eq for long time, she is most innocent person with no evil side and no greed. so i can sorely guarantee that the train was not intentional.(that was her first time in hate, and ive heard she did get yelled at by ppl, and i know that hurt her alot, how i know cause she gave me tell when she got yelled for going the wrong way. but i did not know it was her train) again she is so sweet, she would never do that.<br>

2ndly, kuros. omg kuros is one of the friendliest and selfless person i know in game, he would give up his last piece of items to help ppl out, he bends over backwards to help others. <br>

After you threaten and make good on your threats you play dumb as if you know nothing of what’s going on. Then, you self-righteously try to patch things up by trying to be nice to a few Fantasy members. Get lost jerk!<br>
<br>
Maybe next time one of our members will get lost and end up at your camp with mobs in toe. I had at least 3 members who volunteered to run to your camp and say hi with mobs in toe. They were newbies to the planes and excited as well. But we didn't. So, why don't you be a man about it and admit the truth. Maybe then we can start to heal the wounds. But as long as you continue to lie and play innocent and naïve, it only makes matters worse.<br>
<br>
Until you come clean about your conduct, your pre-raid threats, the train you intentionally caused, and why you denied knowing anything about any train while in POH (you have since changed your story and now admit it but claim is was merely accidental) we have absolutely nothing to talk about.  You made your grave, now lie in.  <br>
<br>
Two more points. Kuros is a nice guy and will continue to be a good friend of mine as soon as he leaves Synchronicity. And btw, the druid that trained us is a shitty player<br>

PoH day was my first time there. When I arrived, my group took off without me when I zoned in. I told them I lost them and one said follow me. So I tried, but they went off much faster than I.  So I clicked on tracking and began to track the person that told me to follow them.  I ran into about 3-4 creatures that saw right through my camo, one was a chest, the others I cant remember what their names were.  In 2-3 whacks I was dead.  I never got a chance to run or move.  Had I known there was someone close by I would have yelled for help.  I did not see anyone near me at the time, nor was I given the chance to look for anyone either.  If you people were there and saw me die, and saw the mobs on me...Then I am sorry if you felt I trained you!  But I did not.  This was not done on purpose.  I thought we were the only group up there in PoH at the time.  Had I known tracking did not work right in the Planes, I would not have moved or tried it.  <br>
For you to sit there and think people do such horrible things like training you in the Planes, is ungodly horrible to do to someone. Knowing how difficult it was for us to get up there in the first place--you would give it your all so you dont die to have to go through it again and again. <br>
Whoever spoke up about be giving my life for another. Yes, I would and have many times.  I would rather die, then to let someone else get hurt.  Heck...That is most of the reason why I am almost 47 and not higher like the rest of my friends. Because I am always helping out someone with something, or dying a bunch to try to get them out safetly.<br>
I think you, Mijac, need to get your attitude adjusted and realize not everyone is out to get you or your guild members.  This was not my intention when I ran into a scuff.<br>
As for your nasty comments about me, without having the insight enough to ask me what had happened and hear my story...I will remember this of what you said about me and your nature in the matter. The next time you, or any of your Fantasy guild members need a port for a way to get to a place or on a corpse run, they can forget it.  You made your own bed with your negative comments and you are hurting all your guild members reputation for it!  I hope they truly enjoy you now after what you have done. You are not very admirable and I would hate to have you as a leader when you pick on people like that for accidents!  Best of luck to you all. And leave me out of your petty ramblings. This is just a game! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=creepicrawli>CreepiCrawli</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/12/01 11:53:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=128.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Synchronicity Personae non-gratis</span><hr size=1> So, let me get this straight? We have Mijac saying Kol ran towards them with mobs on her and died at their camp, thus aggroing them and wiping them out. Then we have Kol saying she was trying to follow some guildmates, ran into some mobs and died where she ran into them, yet she says no one was around her at the time? Either she plays with her clipping plane all the way down, using overhead view so she cant see anything around her, and has the monitor turned off, I highly doubt she wouldnt have seen an entire guild raid at her feet.<br>
<br>
&quot;In 2-3 whacks I was dead. I never got a chance to run or move. Had I known there was someone close by I would have yelled for help. I did not see anyone near me at the time, nor was I given the chance to look for anyone either.&quot;<br>
<br>
So which is it? Did she run into 4 mobs and die in 2-3 whacks, with no guild raid of 30+(or whatever they had) anywhere nearby that she could see, or did she indeed aggro some mobs, get scared and start running around, contrary to what I'm sure her guild told her to do should she get aggroed? Either she died in 2-3 whacks with no guild in sight, even tho she supposedly died at Mijac's guild's &quot;feet&quot;, or she is not telling the truth and indeed trained another guild's camp with mobs in tow, even tho she said no guild was in sight, and she never had time to run?

I was on a hate-raid and we only had a 53 warrior and did great. that was our only warrior on the raid just FYI, also I think that a fault happened that you need to explain to everyone that during the breakin, aggro = stand and die, i think there may have been a mis-communication, but its Vital that you tell this to everyone especially if youre gonna have 2 guilds up there.  <br>
    Also, the problem wiith Private tells between Mijac and Ryonea do not concern me because there is no proof of what happened, although ive read two stories on this case.  I understand you can be scared, but youve GOT to understand how to work this thing or else a few ignorant people can wipe everyone out (not referring you Kol, im still not clear on the truth). Ive always heard of one guild up on Hate, but possibly Fantasy and Synchronicity could have planned better, THis is just a damn game, its not to see who can beat each other to a zone to get stuff, if you dont get there one time, possibly you can reschedule without having a big fight, then both guilds have a miserable time on hours on end of CR hell.<br>
    Just my two cents since if read this post and taken an interest on trying to say something that might make any  kind of difference (not that my hacking and slashing do) <p><BR>(51 Cavalier) Bauldor (Human) {Vengeful Dragons}<BR></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=128.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm3.showNextMessage?topicID=128.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=128.topic&index=13><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm3.threadControl?topicID=128.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=128.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=128.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm19">VCC Administration<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm18">Title Requests<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm24">VCC Archives<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm1">General Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm23">SoL Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm4">The Bazaar<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm25">Tradeskills<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm12">Voting Booth<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm13">Retirement Hall<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm3">Event Announcements<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm8">The Gallery<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm5">Rants and Flames<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm6">Guild Lists and Links<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm16">Guild Discussions<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm7">Vazaelle Guild Leader Lounge<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm26">Removed posts</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle.com Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm3>Event Announcements</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.vazaelle.com">Vazaelle.com</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
