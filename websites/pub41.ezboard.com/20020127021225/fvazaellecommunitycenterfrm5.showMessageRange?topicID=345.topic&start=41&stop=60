The issues that I posted are merely my reasons for not joining a guild but that doesn't mean they are limited to me alone.<br>
<br>
The big difference here is that I don't mind speaking my mind.  If that sounds bitter to you then thats your slant.  Sure, I could candy-coat my words so that all the guildies could swallow this reality a little better and guild leaders wouldn't have to justify their actions a little better but I won't. <p>Herder

Secondly, please look at the number of posts I have made. 2.  My first reply, and now this one.  I've tried to stay off VCC for my own personal reasons, however Herder's post came to my attention and I felt compelled to post a response.  Hence, my first post, &quot;Argh.. I've tried to restrain myself from responding to this post, but I'm sorry I just can't..&quot; Anyways, this is my last post on VCC, Herder, if you wish to continue this conversation, send me an email at complaintoeeepers@sowned.com (I'm not kidding, that's the address.)<br>
<br>
So why did I feel compelled to post?  Mainly for the same reason as Psyknight has stated.  Herder, your view on &quot;guilds as a whole&quot; is so incredibly jaded and taken out of proportion that you discourage those unguilded people reading this board from ever wanting to join one.  Did you *once* say *anything* positive about a guild?<br>
<br>
You said you're not flaming, just look at the first words of every paragraph in your post.<br>
&quot;Tough question&quot;<br>
&quot;To me a guild is&quot; &lt;-- Good start<br>
&quot;What a guild isn't&quot; &lt;-- Deteriorating..<br>
&quot;I don't like&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't like&quot;<br>
&quot;If someone needs help with an epic raid, I don't like&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't like&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't like&quot;<br>
&quot;I guess&quot;<br>
<br>
Please tell me that isn't a rant.<br>
<br>
I'm not responding to your response about my post simply because there's no reason to.  Everything I've said is covered in my response, you've simply brought up old points that have already been addressed.  In fact, things have degraded to the point where you're calling me names.  Sorry, not participating in this anymore.<br>
&quot;make you sound like you have ADD&quot;<br>
&quot;Eepers, if anyone is the kid here, it has to be you&quot;<br>
&quot;Why the fuck do you care&quot;<br>

<br>
Isn't what my response exactly what jules was asking for?  Does it matter what format I use or what words are laid out first?<br>
<br>
I am not bitter, however you want to see it.  I find it highly amusing that so many people are rushing out to defend guilds in general, perhaps because the knife is hitting close to the bone.<br>
<br>
I never denounced a guild, whether on Vaz or otherwise.  I have never pointed out a single person, whether on Vaz or otherwise.<br>
<br>
Any inflammatory response I made was in direct retaliation to a replay made to me, therefore warranted in my eyes.<br>

As Eeepers stated, you started with 'I believe a guild is this' for one sentence, then proceeded with six statements about how a guild is messed up LOL. The original poster didn't want to know what makes a good or bad guild. All he wanted to know is why you've been unguilded to date, and if you plan on joining a guild, which one?<br>

That they are all Communist. There is no possible way I can see another meaning in what u have written despite your claims to the contrary.<br>
<br>
I am a Member of Regression and while I am an Officer, it is merely cause I'm an extra person to invite peeps into the guild if they happen to be closer to me than one of the other officers and that I was here from the beginning.<br>
<br>
On loot, I have obtained 2 pieces of raid loot simply cause no one else wanted them or needed them. They ain't great but they're fun to show off since no one else has them =P Most of my equip is hand-me-downs that the guild doesn't need...which reminds me, I got some gatorscale leggings, guild need the rygorr leggings back? The money I have I've gotten from xping, and a little I asked the guild for so I can buy jaspers for symbol (not every1 needs the lvl 44 peridot one but for the cost of a jasper, +200hp isnt bad)<br>
<br>
Anywaz, I have another char on Innoruuk that will prob never be guilded if I ever played em again, Necromancer, my life was solo, I loved soloing, I disliked grouping with em, it was just my person preference. Tho if I had reached the higher end game my thoughts might have changed. On this server, I am part of a guild and I love it. Eeeps is a great leader, I'd jump into the lava if he asked...he's asked pretty close (go solo that to see how hard it hits...that was on some mob on like 5-6th lvl of skyshrine and I was 35 or something...he only hit for 210 tho, weak =P ) and he gives loot out as needed and yes, tho u may not agree, no one complains...seriously<br>

Nothing to see here, move along =) Nothing I say from here on out will address you at all. <br>
<br>
To those who may be looking to join a guild:<br>
<br>
I've played enough to see good guilds, and bad guilds. I've played enough to see guilds lose good players, and guilds drop bad players. The reasons why there are unguilded players post 46 is just as varied as the people themselves. Herder said himself that he expects people to step up and say that not all guilds are like that, and he is completely right. I am one of those people who will say that not all guilds are bad. Unfortunately for those reading this thread thinking about possibly joining a guild, Herder's statements alone may deter many from even trying a guild. As he might state, his opinions are his opinions, and should be considered just that. <br>
<br>
All I can say is, a guild is what you make of it. If you choose to see the guild leader as a socialist authoritarian with no regard for his members, and is using all of his members for his/her own gain, then so be it. Comrade. Although, I kinda think that statement is contradictory, hehe. If you choose to see that same guild leader as somebody who is selfless and gives their 110% and asks the same of their members, you can see it that way too. Regardless of how bad I think a guild is, I will always respect a guild leader for having the selflessness to step forward and give their time and effort to organize a group of people to achieve a common goal. It most definately is not easy trying to organize any amount of people to move in the same direction. People who are in a guild, stay in a guild because they believe in the cause and goals of the guild. They are willing to give what it takes to see those goals met. If they don't, then they don't belong there. Regardless, there should be no ill feelings on either side, it just didn't work out. Whatever the reasons for one not being a part of the guild, is nobody's fault, and that person's prerogative. <br>
<br>
A guild is a group of people striving for a specific goal, either you choose to be a part of it, or you don't. For those of you looking towards joining a guild, just make sure a guild embodies everything you are looking for, or at the very least, you will be able to live with the sacrifices that you will have to make in order to get what you want out of the guild.<br>
<br>
Will being unguilded post46 ruin your enjoyment of the game? Depends on what you're expecting out of the game! <p><b>Skeenk Da'Steenka<BR>

<br>
Herder is entitled to his views as we all are, however it is often a hasty pov when one has not been in the position of leading a guild. Alot of ppl do not realize the bs and total commitment guild leaders must have to run a guild. A GL must do what rite for the guild, he/she is there to hold a community together and see that the guild follows its predefined goals. <br>
<br>
People can and do have good experiences and people also have bad experiences in guilds, but as my friend Psy points out a guild is only what you make of it. As is the gam e unguilded. You need not guild and still have enjoyment plenty of guilds who raid allow non-members to join their ranks and so.  <br>
<br>
*Everyones verson of shangri-la is different*<br>
<br>
raiding guilds, chat guilds, small guilds, large guilds, family guilds, ethnic guilds, gender guilds, rp guilds, and so on,... so please do not lump guilds all together and label them to taint people into orginizing for enjoyment.<br>

<br>
Regardless of what you think, I outlined why I am not in a guild per the original posters request.  I was then attacked, subtly and not so subtly for my point of view.  That's ok, I don't mind arguments, especially written.  <br>
<br>
If a post is more than 25 words, then dont' read it, thats your perogative.<br>
<br>
Kerai, nice job coming to the defense of your guildleader, I'm sure thats going to be remembered when loot #3 is debated between the apparatchik of your guild.<br>
<br>
As far as my views on guilds, thats my view, not necessarily a state of guilds on Vaz or any other server.  Like I said in my original post, as if any of my original detractors had bothered to read it, was that there are some good guilds on Vazaelle, but none that I would join. <p>Herder

<br>
In one case the guild was a pretty uncordinated, loose bunch, which in it self didn't bother me, but when we did do get together for guild events, the loot wasn't managed well IMO, and it just left me with the feeling that the guild leaders were users.  The officers pushed for what they wanted, and the rest of us could just do whatever.  I was with these guys for about a month.  I'm still friends with some of them, but it wasn't a hard dicision to leave.  <br>
<br>
The other guild was much more organized with lots of guild exp groups and raiding.  We had a lot of fun, but after some bad political disagreement I left.  At the risk of starting a crazy rant I won't get into the particulars, but let me just say I enjoy my EQ as drama free as possible.   <br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong though, there are lots of good folks around and some good guilds, but not everything works for everyone.  Every guild will have it's ego's and priorities.  Some work together well and generate a vibe that floats boats and some don't.  On Vazelle so far I've  had an equal amount of crap as good times.  It hasn't been worth it.  <br>
<br>
I'm enjoying the freedom of being unguilded.  I do a little raid stuff, but not much.  Some day I might want to join another guild, but I'd hate to sign up just to find more ego trips, politics and greed.  Guess I have to be more careful... or maybe I'm just not cut out for EQ guilds.<br>

I would like to point out that the system described by Herder is far closer to fascism than it is to socialism or communism.<br>
<br>
However his ideas expressed here <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Or maybe Verant hoped that, you know, a community would evolve with player developed philosophy's on what is right and acceptable. A virtual conscience, as it were.<br>
<br>

<br>
Semantics, perhaps... but I think most of the uber guilds on most servers are primarily communistic, not fascist. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ugaladriiel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Galadriiel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/9/01 9:15:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=345.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why I am unguilded atm...</span><hr size=1> Communism in theory is a great idea, until you factor in the Human equation. <p>Galadriiel<br>

Some of them may be exaggerated for one reason or another but basically all those things happen.  Several of the posters attacking him after clearly did not fully understand or added connotations to words that may not have been implied (eeeeeeepers in particular).  Once a single leader is in control of loot distribution sucking up starts, its inevitable.  Its not just in guilds, its part of human nature.  I doubt you will find many people are openly disagreeing with things said by the person in control of loot, even in non-loot situations, because potentially offending this person may result in you not getting some item in the future (even if the person in charge of loot is only affected subconsciously, its still an effect).  Herder said he did not like to be FORCED to help people on epic quests etc, never that he would not help under any circumstances.  I ask you to look around and see how many people openly criticize decisions made by their guild leaders.  They have the right to criticize.. but there is certainly no positive effect to doing so.  You can hope for a completely neutral guild leader who will not let anything other than guild needs affect item distribution.  Try to not be too idealistic here.. nobody NOBODY is completly neutral.   There can easily be many guilds on this server with loot distributed in a reasonably neutral manner.  Reasonably... meaning that some imperfections are expected.<br>
<br>
  So, since this will affect every guild, will you let it stop you from joining a guild?  Hardly.  Its something to take into consideration, part of tribal interrelations in the human animal.   <br>
<br>
  You hope loot is distributed fairly and impartially, you hope friends of the guild leader are not rewarded items behind the scenes, you hope nobody sells off the items they just replaced with raid loot. If you find yourself in a guild where you think things are unfair, leave and try for another.. but don't get your hopes up too high because this game is played by human beings, and many humans are willing to lie cheat and steal to get what they want. <p>Bammbi, the Ranger with the nice ass.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubiship.showPublicProfile?language=EN>biship</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/9/01 10:24:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=345.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: to all unguilded level 46plus here...</span><hr size=1> Are all you people that fucking blind?

Herder merely stated why he was not in a guild, hence the original question. All of a sudden we have a war goin here due to the fucking lack of insight on the so called sheep uprising on the herder( no pun) (well ok dumb try at one)<br>
<br>
Either way he stated why he wasn't ina  guild.&quot;Oh I was told to read this due to the blah blah things I am hearing of herder's comments. WTF you people that fucking stupid or lifeless you take a goddam game this serious? IT WAS AN OPINION, and ya know alot, not half, prob 30-40% of vazzelle are prob in agreement with his views on the upper game. Hey quarken you always keep askin me why I won't level, here's the reason dopey =) WHy the fuck put up with this? I had some of the best people in the game leave the guild I founded and was leader of (storm legion) due to lack of raids and progressing. God forbid we all were great ingame friends and were just having fun and wern't hell bent on becomming uber and joining some big guild to give the guild leaders and his/her cronies a blowjob everytime we log on. Some people actually like to be casual and just enjoy play with friends. Why the fuck is it so wrong not to be a loot whore or some virtual cock sucker to some egotistical kid that leads a big guild?<br>
<br>
You all totally missed the point of his post. I'm not sittin here brown nosin Herder, i just agree with what he stated. I have since givin up leadership of storm when I quit 4 months ago. I do play again but not at the level I used to or with the determination for levels, cause you higherups, well most of ya......... your fucking jaded fools. SO why would I want to deal with that all the time if I want to play my shadowknight sbiship.? I know I will get ripped for this post, or your a f0ool or who are you, or I don't know what I am tlaking bout. Sorry not educated enough to use philosophical quotes and such, but I know I am pretty level headed enough to know the high up game is not for everyone, and raiding is not what the fucking game is about. <br>
<br>
Hey might be just me. I still think EQ was at its best when it was prekunark, but thats just me. When I was on Bert, you never saw this type of behavior or so many people being total assholes like Vaz has. Seems like all the uber guilds and the fucking lackey's in them( not all now, come on gimmie some credit) all wannabe the man or be the man's weekly fling. It's like everyone is so infatuated with their level or stature. But hey thats my givin observation. I have been on Vaz since the day it popped and never left. I have seen some great great people on this server. Karp,Draike,quarken, nocturno, zozz, lester, ctair, bains/azomnd, tropics, borst, and a few others, but ya know, most of the great ones that this server once had, they no longer play. Why? Most left a long time ago when the server got settled and they saw the type of people this server had.<br>
<br>
<br>
So whole fucking point of my little rant is, who the fuck cares, he  stated his opinion and all of a sudden every little pecker jerking fool came out of the woodwork to bahs em. Eh so fuck you, sowhat someof us actually believe in friendship first or loyalty to friends and not some fucking institution of a guild. Like I sid , godforbid if I ever level again, i couldn't handle bein listed as uber and have to be accounted with the rest of the pieces of shitthathave that title. I'll stick with mylittle friendship guild that doesnt killthemselves ot be uber or raid 24/7 evetr fucking day or weekend.<br>
