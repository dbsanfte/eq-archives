You are trying to add irrelevant details to cloud the basics of the analogy.  The argument simply asks whether the government should be able to force you to give away something that is yours that you do not need.  You state that you are born with kidneys but not wealth.   There are people born with wealth too, so that argument doesn't work.  Even those not born with wealth are born with their own talents that lead them to it.  The amount extra is really quite irrelevant too.  The point is, if something is yours, and another person needs it, should the government be able to force the transfer?  I don't think it should.<br>
<br>
Banderas is right about student aid.  I went to school with a kid whose parents made $320 our freshman year.  Yes, $320.  He was from Bangladesh.  Dartmouth is need blind, it doesn't matter what you make, if you are smart enough to get in, the school will make it possible for you to attend.<br>
<br>
If you are such a sharing, caring person, then give your money away.  I have absolutely no problem with this, in fact, I probably give more to charity than you do.  I certainly give more than most people do.  I believe *I* should be the one to control how much I give, and to whom I give it.  I don't think the government should be able to force me to give it if I choose not to.  That is the point.  Most of the people that want to raise taxes are people that either 1) want benefits from the government or 2) (like you) people that won't feel a change in their lifestyle when taxes increase.  There are people that suffer when taxes increase and that find it harder to make ends meet.  Apparently Anywon, you don't understand what this is like.<br>
<br>
BTW Banderas, I didn't attend wealthy schools my whole life.    I met a lot of wealthy people at college.  My high school was a good school, but nothing amazing, upper middle class and about 98% white.  My middle school was basically the same as my high school (both public and in the same town).  I went to grammar school at a catholic school in an inner city because the inner city schools were so bad that my parents didn't want me to go there. <br>

Take a look through the Forbes list.  You will find there are basically 2 groups of people on it.  1) People who inherited money 2) People who made it themselves.  Even those who inherited money trace their fortunes to someone who made the fortune initially.<br>
<br>
What's special about them?  Why did Andrew Carnegie rise from the ghettos to the 2nd wealthiest man alive?  How about the internet fortunes, like Jerry Yang and Jeff Bezos?  Ross Perot?  All these people were just like you and me.  They set a goal for themselves, worked their asses off, and made their fortunes.  The difference between them and most people is that rather than sitting around and whining about being poor, they did something about it.  They took huge risks, they worked hard, and it paid off.  Sure some of it is luck, but any of us could roll the same dice they rolled and have the same chance at success.<br>
<br>
I don't have a huge fortune like the people on the Forbes list.  If it were important enough to me to have it, I'd be trying to acquire it.  The truth is that I'm more interested in academic than monetary success at this point in my life so have chosen to pursue research interests.  That's fine, that's my choice as it is my life.  However, the fact that I'm pursuing my scientific interests over financial goals does not entitle me to take the wealth of those that have made financial goals their primary purpose in life.<br>

taxes are used much more than just social programs, its our states and cities. wake up, soon the maintenance plans that have been cut on our municipalities and public projects are going to foster problems, disasters. they have been cut continually, and now non existent. what happens when dams go, or mains burst, worse a meltdown. whatever in your town this WILL happen. since everyones budgets have shrunk time and time again they'll have to borrow, bonds, whatever.<br>

The tax cut was out of fairness.  Money shouldn't be taxed twice.  Money being earned by the company was being taxed at the corporate level and then taxed again at the dividend level.  It was removed because it just wasn't fair.<br>

Oh, btw, bonds don't pay dividends.  They pay interest.  Stocks pay dividends.<br>

Second, municipal bonds were already tax free at the federal level.  (I don't think municipal bond interest has ever been taxable at the federal level in the United States.)<br>

Because you were told that's how the US works - on equal opportunity for all?  Think about it.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Where did you get the beliefs you have</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
-Rich kid grows up in a upper class suburb &amp; his parents hound him about his grades all the time.  Problem-free life and he doesn't have to work at all till he's out of college.  Completely free time after school to study, do homework, hang out with friends.  Passes high school with decent grades, and his parents can easilly afford a top university.  He doesn't have to work through college and his parents give him spending money.  He gets a job right out of college with his dad who owns a small company &amp; he is next in line to become president of the co.<br>
<br>
-Poor kid's dad bails before he is born and his mom can't pay the bills, so at age 13 he starts working to help pay the bills.  He works almost full time and goes to school, but since he has no time to study or do any work he barely passes high school.  He can't get into any college with a D average so he gets a construction job and makes $15k a year.<br>
<br>
-Kid grows up in inner city slum where nearly everyone is involved in a gang or hardcore drugs or a thief to get by.  He's a good kid and stays away from all those problems.  None of the teachers at his high school give a damn because the kids are hopeless except for a select few.  He works his hardest and passes high school but bombs his SAT/ACT because he was never really taught anything.  He can't get into a good college with shitty test scores, so goes to a 2 year community college only through student aid and tons of student loans.  His next 10 years of his life is working to pay off those loans.<br>
<br>
-Inner city - mother pulls kid out of high school @ 16 because she needs him to work full time to help her support her other 3 kids.  Janitor most of his life.  Once his siblings are older he gets his GED and attends college.  At age 40 he gets a degree and is in decent shape, only 18 years behind everyone else.<br>
<br>
There are infinate scenarios.  Yes it is POSSIBLE for ALMOST everyone to make something of themselves, but to say everyone has equal opportunity is ludicrous.  It's ludicrous to even say everyone has a NEAR equal opportunity.<br>
<br>
Ammelen, how can you judge someone you don't even know at all?  Homeless people don't deserve any help?  Who the fuck are you to say who deserves what?  Sure, some homeless are that way because they drank themselves out of a job and spend all their money on booze, and some are homeless because they don't feel like working, but some are homeless because they were born into it, or a million other scenarios.  Do you know how hard it is to get on your feet from being homeless?  I don't, but neither do you unless you were homeless at some point.  So until then, you have no right to say shit about what they do and don't deserve.<br>
<br>
P.S.  My point about giving money away really has nothing to do with who deserves what.  But what if you helped someone out financially and it was just enough to help them turn their life around?  Since you're just sitting on it, why the fuck not?<br>
 It's like not stopping someone from walking out in front of a car because they didn't do anything to deserve your help, even though it requires <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>no sacrifice on your part whatsoever</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
  And elohim is right, who says greed is natural in humans?  It could very well be conditioned into our minds...you know...since we were born and have grown up in a society that REVOLVES around it.<br>

If you have $163 million, and you give away 100 million, and you invested in enron and you get fucked out of your money, you still have 200 kidneys for backup.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=herdervazaelle>HerderVazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 2267<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/17/03 7:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=92.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hi people</span><hr size=1> Hi there all from RealityTV(r) land.<br>

Well if you bothered to read anything posted you'd see that I grew up with the same kids you're referring to, in a heavy-minority middle and high school.  My parents are successful now because they put in their share of work throughout the years.  They started in an apartment in the northside of Chicago infested with rats and roaches, and now one is the assistant manager of a finance company and the other is the general manager for a dealership in South Florida.  They only reached this plateau in the last few years so my childhood was in average income, and the community I grew up in and the schools I attended were full of people that were usually less fortunate than I was, and my family was far from being rich. <br>

I know people who work 50+ hours per week and attend college full-time that still manage to get good grades.  College is much more difficult than high school, so I don't buy that at all.  Most kids go to high school from 8am to 3pm, they could work from 4 to 10 for 5 days of the week, for 30 hours and still have time to study on those days, and still be able to have a pair of 8 hour shifts on the weekend and have enough time to have a somewhat limited social life as well as have a much larger amount of study time.  Unless these kids are working under the table, they won't be able to work that much by the way.<br>

That's such a copout.  If a child isn't getting a good education they can take it upon themselves to learn on their own.  There's plenty of very helpful resources (especially in those education systems in which students generally have very bad test scores due to inadequate education) to help students do well on their SAT/ACTs.  Again it's all a matter of a student's dedication.  If they want to give up and claim it's too much to try, that's their decision and I don't have any sympathy for them.  Not everyone is entitled to be born into a life that's as easy as another, it's just the way life goes.<br>

<br>
Never in my life have I ever heard of a mother pulling a kid out of high school against that kid's will.  I doubt it's even legal in any of the states.  So I won't waste my time debating such a ridiculous idea.<br>
<br>
As I stated, success for each individual might be harder to achieve than another, but it's still within reach and is usually not taken hold of.<br>
<br>
Community colleges are set up to help boost students into a higher level of education at a university.  If a student that attends one flies through with an A average, there's hundreds of scholarships out there that would love to help pay for their education costs at a real University.  Do you have any idea how many scholarships each year are not even used?  It's hard to tell if you've finished high school or not, but talk with a high school guidance counsellor that knows their shit and it's incredible how many scholarships are out there that can help a kid out that's in dire financial straits.  A black friend of mine back in high school who lived with his single mother got over 25 scholarships of $100-$1000 each, and didn't have to apply for financial aid at all.  <br>
<br>
We went to an &quot;F&quot; school (stands for failing) which means it was one of the worst educations available in the state.  Did my education suffer?  Not at all, I got a 1420 on my SATs  (may have gotten higher but I didn't really study too well).  My cousin got a 1460.  I got accepted into Uni of Florida, my cousin went to Florida State.  I had some things going on so I stayed at a local university for my first 2 years with a full tuition scholarship.  I didn't apply for anything else because my parents were starting to make a high amount of income so I didn't qualify for much anymore.  <br>
<br>
I know from personal experiences.  You're making up theoretical stories while you probably don't know a single person who's been in anything similar.  I'm not like you.  I don't sit around and preach that America is the land of the free and that kids have no reason to fail.  I instead SEE that they're handed chances and they don't take them.  <br>
<br>
I can't even count how many kids I saw that would skip classes for no reason than because someone else was.  I can't begin to fathom how many people would copy someone else's homework before class just because they didn't want to do it themselves.  Latins are a very social group (I'm latin myself), so the latins had their own clique, dragging down those that might be successful into skipping school, smoking bud, not giving a fuck about school.  The blacks would get involved in the drama.  Every once in a while you'd see two of them fucking in the back of a school bus on the way home.  You think they couldn't stop themselves from doing that?  Then they cry their eyes out when they get pregnant.  You have any idea or any experience with seeing anything like that?  Based on your post and previous postings, I can bet you don't.  <br>
<br>
The world is a fucked up place sometimes but there's always options.  If someone is content in following the status quo, too fucking bad for them.  I'm not reaching out to help someone that doesn't want to make the effort to help themselves.  I work in special finance, I've done collections extensively on sub-prime principal and I hear the bullshit from customers all the time.  I can see why they don't succeed and why they struggle.  I don't need some punk kid like you trying to assume to know why I look at the world  in the way I do.  <br>

Ok let's change the analogy then.  Does the government have a right to make you give your blood to someone else?  There is no risk associated with giving blood, you won't run out, you'll make more in a few days.  If someone needs your blood, should the government be able to force you to give it?  Currently, the law says no.  Why does the law say no to that, but allows the government to take your money?  On a side note, if someone was dying next to me, and I could save them by donating blood, I'd do it without hesitation for anyone I didn't really loathe.<br>

Take some anthropology classes at your local university and it'll open your eyes to a lot more in the world.  Ammelen is correct in his statement, but there's more to it than that.  Socialism does work in the world today, but generally only at the most primitive level, in tribes in South America along the Amazon, and tribes in Africa.<br>
<br>
I've been fortunate enough in my college studies to have a number of professors who were unafraid to give the politically incorrect viewpoints of the world in addition to the agreed notions, to allow the students to choose themselves which they believe to be right and wrong.  Too much of the extreme conspirators or too much of the extreme media-bred sheep tends to cloud your vision and prevents you from thinking on your own. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1136<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/17/03 9:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=92.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hi people</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Now how am I wrong again?

Simply not true.  Go through the Forbes list.  The VAST majority of them are self made, probably over 80 percent.  I thought about counting up all 400, but I'm just too lazy to do so.  If you take a look though it becomes obvious that that vast majority of the very rich made their fortunes.  Almost without fail, these people started and grew a business.<br>
<br>
II gather you don't know anything about starting businesses Herder, but anyone can do it with a good enough idea.  Only astronomical wealth would make much of a difference in being able to start one's own.  You get an idea, you put together a proposal, and you go raise money.  There are firms called &quot;Venture Capital&quot; or &quot;VC&quot; firms out there that do just that, they invest in businesses.  Their goal is to hit the next Microsoft.  They take people like Jeff Bezos (Amazon founder) who have no capital to start with and put up a whole bunch of cash for him to start his new business.  (I actually worked with Jeff Bezos, he worked at my company, D. E. Shaw &amp; Co., and actually presented an online bookstore to David Shaw as a possibility for investing.  David Shaw turned down the idea thinking it wouldn't make any money, so Jeff Bezos went out and raised the money himself and started Amazon on his own.)  You don't need capital to become rich.  You need a vision, and you need determination.<br>

You have a point here.

I'm just judging by my idea of a ridiculous amount of money.  $163 mil is a ridiculous amount of money, and someone with that much money is a greedy mother fucker.  For you, they may need $200 billion to be a greedy mother fucker, but $163 mil is in that category for ME.

There are wealthy people and poor people that earn money on the backs of others.  It is a fallacy that wealthy people do it more.  The shitty insurance salesman pushing policies people don't need, the guy on the street selling stolen goods, and many other low income individuals make shit money on the backs of others.  Someone like Jeff Bezos made money by providing a valuable service that enriches the lives of many.  The people who work for him wouldn't be better off without him there, they wouldn't have the job.  Entrepreneurs like him create jobs which does more to help the common man than most of us do.  He provides a better alternative than what would be there if he had never been born, for if his alternative were not better, no one would choose it (I am referring to the jobs he provides).  This idea that rich people make money on the backs of poor people is absurd.  The people working for the wealthy have a better life because of the wealthy.  No one forces them into the job, if they had better options they'd take them (as well they should).  Finally, nothing is stopping any of us from doing what these entrepreneurs have done.  If it's so easy and the reward is so disproportional to the effort, then go do it yourself.<br>
