This is partial conjecture on my part, but a reason that IV was broken up was because Krim wanted to make a guild that would do things first in EQ, and while IV was an excellent guild, we didn't have the sheer number of players that _the_ guilds in EQ had -- which was something we were proud of, always doing mobs with as few people and as little equipment as possible.<br>

IV moved across with very few people to Vazaelle. Krimzen was a magnet to Hardcore people. It was very hard to not recognise IV as a future power-Base when /w all 55 60 was Dominated by IV.<br>
<br>
This in itself was a calling card for other Hardcore people who werent in a &quot;soon-to-be&quot; UBER Guild. Many Hardcore people from other guilds (normally with better gear than their own guildi members) to follow Krimzin's Flock.<br>
<br>
Now go to an established Server. Velious gets released, the majority of the guilds are stable with their Roster, not as much moving between guilds as on a Blue server.<br>

Unsure if you were referring to IV not being formed at the creation of Vazaelle?<br>

I congratuate IV on their current wfforts, but to try and compare to where on old server was at the same point of time is frivilous at best. The only time you can compare newer servers is at the release of an expansion. Where the playing ground is equal.<br>

The example, and reply were totally relevant to Herder's post.  IV does things with fewer people and less equipment than any guild I'm aware of.  <br>
<br>
That makes them my best example of a skilled guild, and what uber guilds were like before the new netcode allowed Zerg guilds to rise from mediocrity.  <br>
<br>
To those unaware, back around 02/01, VI implemented new netcode which significantly reduced lag.  This impacted raids, as raid size used to be limited to six groups, otherwise the raid would be too laggy for players to be effective.<br>
<br>
The old 36 player soft cap favored skilled players, because they could do more with smaller numbers.  Gimp guilds could not use raw numbers to compensate for their lack of ability as many do now.<br>
<br>
Add Velks to the equation, and the high end game is suddenly very ugly and zergish.<br>
<br>
So, my IV reference was totally valid and in context, but Mojo posted a reply which included a knock on IV which I felt was inaccurate, so I replied specifically to that, and that got this derailment going.<br>
<br>
Baps,<br>
<br>
You're incorrect about IV moving with very few people.  We had a strong core from MT, and they were the first ones to get burnt out.  They got the ball moving though. <br>
<br>
I am not a current member of IV on KB as I do not play EQ anymore, yet I'm blown away with what they've done there.  When I talk about IV now, it's as a fanboy.  But, again, if someone wants to flame Vaz's IV or posts something inaccurate about them, damn right I'm going to reply.<br>

<br>
Mojo,<br>
<br>
Slivers?  Uhh.. Slivers was long gone by the time IV had died.  Let me refresh your memory a bit.<br>
<br>
When IV died, the top guilds were, roughly in order of accomplishment, IV, SF, PO, CC, Agony god knows who..  Agony may have been ahead of CC at that point, I don't recall precisely.  I do remember rumors of CC breaking up as they were on a downturn, but I have no idea of those were true.<br>
<br>
Vaz was nine months old, and the above mentioned guilds were full of level 60 players and raiding pretty much full time.  There was a big rush of server transfers which was a big boost to SF who gained some ground on IV.  PO and CC weren't close at all.  While IV was clearing NTOV/farming warders, Cazic, CC and PO were doing WW stuff, Zland, etc, and SF was -- smartly -- doing HOT.<br>
<br>
IV was then unexpectedly disbanded overnight, with a small message board post from Krim indicating that there would be a new guild, and that not everyone would be part of it.  After a few days in the dark -- although there was much speculation -- Krim and SF's leadership announced that SF would also be disbanded and a new guild would be formed from the hardcore/skilled players from each guild, Primal Aura.<br>
<br>
IV was disbanded in a very disrespectful way, and most members were pretty pissed off at Krim, and discouraged about the mess as we really liked IV.  PA ended up raiding with 25 SF people and 15 IV people on average -- I counted <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  -- and folded within three weeks or so as they were far less effective than IV was.<br>
<br>
I believe that ex-IV people who later would join CC had something to say about its turn around, but it was initially PO who was the top guild on Vaz after IV and SF blew up together.  I was happy to see CC do well, actually, because of all guilds on Vaz, CC was the guild that never bitched about being beaten to spawns and acknowledged that raid content was FCFS.<br>
<br>
Some IV members did well in DOAC as two guilds, Tempest and Inner Virtue.  They stopped playing when everyone realized that DOAC sucked ass.<br>
<br>
Krim admitted that he was a dumbass, apologized, and almost everyone got over it in time.<br>
<br>
IV didn't get bored of EQ or Vaz, and we weren't pushed away by other guilds.  In most of what we did, we had no competition.  Our leadership got ambitious/insane, and we died a fluke death.  Yeah, dead is dead, and it may not matter why, but let's remember the truth at least. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umojokynn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mojokynn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1086<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/2/02 12:57:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1494.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hor.troligt.com/davve/snoopy.gif width=32 height=32></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: +++</span><hr size=1> My bad,<br>

Things got too hot, kb came up and off they went (This was roughly what I heard about MT but then again its 2nd hand info) <p>~ Mojo ~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/useraa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>seraa</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 181<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/2/02 1:11:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1494.topic&index=70>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: +++</span><hr size=1> I posted once or twice on IV's new boards too and now I'm banned.<br>

I am unsure of your Defination of a Strong Core.. Are you referring to members or their playing habbits/style?<br>

Heres a rough list of people who were in the first wave from Morell-Thule to Vazaelle (using MT names)<br>

Try and match these up with their Vaz names, its fun.<br>

More came a little later, and more again through-out IVs history. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucerosofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceros of Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 869<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/2/02 2:29:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1494.topic&index=73>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: +++</span><hr size=1> You're missing a few of people, bfb, Minikin and Endren off the top of my head.<br>
<br>
The MT core, the players you list, formed the base of the guild.  Not just from a raid perspective, but guild culture.  I joined IV a couple of weeks into Vaz's life, and the guildchat culture started by the MT people persisted til the end. <br>
<br>
From an early raid perspective, most of these guys showed up every night and put their time in.  If we got wiped out, we acted like veterans and didn't bitch, whine or self destruct over it, we tried again and again and again until we got it.<br>
<br>
What made IV good, our hilarious guildchat, our tenacity, our attitude, our loyalty to each other, that came from MT, even as the MT people stopped playing and eventually most of the guild and its officers were people who joined on Vaz.<br>
<br>
There was a time when it wasn't certain that IV would be the top guild, many people joined and stayed because of the qualities I've mentioned above. Hell, when I joined Krim actually told me that wasn't important to be the top guild, that the important thing was the tightness of the guild.<br>
<br>
That shows too.  Say what you will about IV, they've stuck together through the worst of times.<br>
<br>
Heh, this isn't to say people didn't have their moments, I definitely had my dramatic moments, but that's all part of it.  And let's not forget the whole overnight disbanding of the guild thing. <br>

<br>
I prefer not to post on IV, but all the other threads atm are sorta gay, and I have little opinion on. So I post here to have my fun.<br>
<br>
Krimzin was truly the tactician, without a doubt. A force to be reckoned with. He has the ability to pick up the pieces and continue on, much like a hydra, or maybe the Phoenix. Unsure which is most applicable.<br>
<br>
IV had its day on Vazaelle, but the day has passed. CC and PO have done wonderful amazing things now. Probably the only 2 guilds to achieve more than what IV had done so long ago, but that was a long time ago (4 days is a year in EQ....Serafina once told me) adn these 2 guilds have gone well past where IV left off.<br>
<br>
I dont know how I forgot Bigfatbelly and Endren. I cant remember Minikin sorry. Morell-Thule is like a dream so many eaons past.<br>
<br>
Instead of talking about yesteryear, I would prefer to look at the now.... PO killing Creator/HP/AoW, CC much the same but with Emperor/Cursed on top.<br>
<br>
Come on, Emperor dead (on 4th attempt?) with 57 people, 24 minute fight and 1 casualty, surely this is greater than the first Vulak? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucerosofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceros of Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 870<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/2/02 3:21:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1494.topic&index=76>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yeah, I just like to post</span><hr size=1> Baps,<br>

I'm not trying to debate that IV is the greatest guild in EQ, or the best that Vaz has ever had.  I don't care about any of that.  IV is long removed from Vaz, and both IV and the server have moved on.  IV was part of a significant piece of Vazaelle history though, and I doubt they'll be forgotten, just as Lanys will never forget Soul Assassins and Conquest.<br>
<br>
I merely used IV as an example in a point I was trying to make about how EQ has become easier, and have corrected some inaccuracies posted by others regarding IV.  I did say that IV is the most skilled guild I know of, and I stand by that, but I've never raided with AL or FoH either.<br>
<br>
CC is a fine guild and I'm happy for you guys.  I know of the rush you're feeling and there's not a lot else in gaming that compares -- though, personally, league titles in tf made me a lot less sleepy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uslassh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Slassh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 209<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/2/02 3:56:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1494.topic&index=77>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yeah, I just like to post</span><hr size=1> Nah, I am just trying to get a legitimate post count.<br>
