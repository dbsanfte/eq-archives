<br>
Thats a quote taken DIRECTLY from Danto's first post.<br>
<br>
Here we have an <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> explicit</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> example of miscomunication. Further, this miscomunication occurred <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> during</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a negotiation.<br>
<br>
The negotioan aggreement included this miscomunication as a stipulation of the terms of agreement.<br>
<br>
Therefor, the agreement <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> was</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> broken on DH's part. Whether or not this agreement was what DH <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> intended</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is not the issue. The fact is that it was agreed to by DH with this stipulation (however a miscomunication on DH's part) and the agreement <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> was</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> broken by DH.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, Finnien relayed our guilds plans to Dantos, and reaffirmed the agreement on wednesday, under the assumption that the agreement, as per what Dantos and Him had arranged, still held.<br>
<br>
Why would we tell our competitor that we did not kill a mob and then let them know we plan to do it the following day at a certain time, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> inviting them to beat us to it</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
It just doesn't make sense that way.<br>
<br>
Who gives a fuck who lied to who. The fact of the matter is there WAS a miscomunication during the negotiations. But an agreement <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> was</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> made with the Wed/Thurs stipulation. Deal with breaking the agreement.<br>
<br>
p.s. I could say that Finnien is one of the nicest people I know in EQ. &quot;Everyone&quot; knows that Finnien follows through on the deals he makes. And as to where we should bring this stuff, to the DH board? were it could get censored and nuked? To our board? were the same could happen? Hah, this board is neutral, and represents the player base comunity. <p><link rel="stylesheet" href="http://home.mindspring.com/~matthewshears/linked/fontbehavior.css"

Having agreements on patch days among the three of you would have benefited everyone in that<br>
1.) no more races, which gives you a more relaxed raid<br>
2.) YOU KNOW that you are getting a said mob, rather than if we beat soandso then we may get set mob<br>
3.) DH is the established guild on the server as they have a generally larger raiding force, and play more as a whole.  They are attempting to hatch out agreements and stop the fcfs of high end gaming.<br>
<br>
As they said DH wanted a certain zone and rather than have to race for it they wanted to just make an agreement so they would be assured the zone area,  In terms of agreements broken it was stated that there was miscommunication twice, maybe dantos missed it both times but hey he said he was in a raid in his earlier post, leading a raid and making treaties with other guilds cant be easy.  Everyone is human, I'm sure you've made mistakes before yes?  It was a mistake that the typo was overlooked and not corrected.<br>
<br>
However from what I gather from your posts is that DH wanted Ntov left alone for the 2 days after patch yes?  This would include what tues and wed as the patch was monday night am I wrong?  Thinking that a mob like burrower would be left for 3 days isnt all in all perfect sense ie your mistake in this as dantos' mistake in saying wed/thurs in his typing to shyenkur, hell what if hes across the international date line? for him it WAS wed/thurs and tues/wed for us, yet another factor you could throw in there.<br>
<br>
Rather than coming to bitch about it why not just work it out, I've noticed you all have kept it fairly civil and I'll commend you on that, but then again this is from a 3rd person point of view with only information I've read from ALL of  your posts.  Just my 2 cps wether its worth anything or not <p>Lelyia<br>

You really should have tried talking to him in game, before running to the boards like a little kid to tattle on us.<br>

But whatever..like someone else said this is a FCFS server..so I say a fuck making deals, especially with people who can't understand the deals being made. <p><center>

First off let me state that both Dantos and Finnien are my friends and have always done my best to try and be objective about any disagreements between DH and CoP. That being said......<br>
<br>
I know for fact that CoP hated racing DH to NToV was told this by both Kamille and Finnien among others in CoP that they knew because were pst based for most part and DH is est with a solid Euro player base so deck was stacked against them and wanted to reach an agreement on sharing the zone. We raced a few times proved point if we wanted to race we could and would win most of them.<br>
<br>
Tuesday Finnien sent me a /tell shortly after logged in telling me that Shyenkur had brokered a deal with DH/LD/CoP.....we got ToV North, Lumiere Divine got CT/Yeli, CoP gotTHO/Burrower(btw Finnien also at this time told me quite frankly had no expectation that they would be able to beat Burrower) and the agreement was for Tues/Wed and Finnien also told me he hated this deal BECAUSE thought Burrower was out of reach for CoP to beat. Told him at that time wished them luck. Everything else was considered FCFS (Greig, IV,Rhags,Creator,Glyphed) <br>
<br>
Wed we clearing ToV when am talking to Fiall and Laurana and both tell me that you guys had done THO but lacked numbers to attempt Burrower so were going to do ring war for Buter (btw Tuesdays posted schedule for us was Tues-Ssra, Wed-ToV, Thur-Ring War) and was only changed AFTER was made known to officers that you guys couldn't get numbers for Burrower and did war instead that our plans changed. Until then Ring war was our goal. <br>
<br>
Imho this was all predicated on a misunderstanding if was anything and not a blatant attempt by DH to either decieve CoP or try and screw them over. This was the arrangement I was led to believe was made between Shyenkur and Dantos WITHOUT knowledge of Finnien and think rather than getting on a public forum to air dirty laundry and question a persons integrity and honesty when most likely was a misunderstanding is bad form especially if you have NO personal knowledge of the facts of the argument and are simply taking a side of guildmate. <br>
<br>
Anyway hope an intelligent dialogue can take place over this rather than fodder for trolls on flame forums to post their 2 cents worth on an issue that they have no idea what actually transpired and having nothing better to do that fan the flames even higher.<br>

If this is a FCFS server and understanding the rules about camps, I really don't understand what is meant by racing to NToV. There is absolutely nothing afaik that prevents CoP and LD from flooding NToV with 150 players even if DH is there &quot;first&quot;.<br>
<br>
Frankly this is not done because guilds have chosen not to do it. I would imagine 250 people in the zone might make things fairly difficult and make even those most reluctant to &quot;rotate mobs&quot; realize that both making deals and keeping them isn't silly.<br>
<br>
My guess is that this was an misunderstanding. IMO it didn't need to be posted here and the DH FCFS muscle flexing in responce doesn't make much sense.

So long as DH can overrun everyone, it is FCFS.  If it suits DH to set up some sort of agreement, they will.  And the moment that agreement is no longer convenient for them, they will disregard it or determine a way around it.<br>

<br>
 and oh yea thanks for the insults of saying why race DH you will lose, yea its possible we will lose,  but we lose to the race of 2!!!  guilds not one. That is the advantage you have over CoP. remember CoP doesnt need 2 60 plus member guilds to kill shit!  think about that for a while <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center>

YH is alot of RL friends and yes one of the perks of being in YH is if are of sufficient level can raid along with DH. Also another thing is at most we usually have 10-12 YH members at a raid and are pretty much the same folks all the time raiding. Our raid numbers for non-ToV raids = 45-55 people (ToV is always a huge draw because of the sheer number of items that drop there that everyone wants and jumps by maybe+10 more people plus.) 45-55 people is not an overwhelming number of superior force.<br>
<br>
Majority of YH have never really met outside of the few who actively raid with us and consider them to be my guildies as much as any DHer because fight alongside, laugh alongside and truly enjoy in the helping of each other accomplish and get things. Guess my definition of guildie is to loose according to your definition.<br>

Wasn't this last year's news? Or the year before maybe.<br>

I don't know why Guilds bother trying to come to agreements with each other as 99% of the time it's always tears before bedtime. When will you people learn? Any agreement in Everquest is only worth the paper it's written on.<br>

See this is called a gay ass elitist attitude, drop it, you're no better then anyone else.<br>
<br>
And Xoragofukyourself, it is a fcfs server.  Deals can still be made.  Why would they you ask since your ass will never ever see the ass end of a dead anything?  Because, now upon patching, shit don't spawn for up to like 24 hours later or something.  What's that mean?  It means if DH would have went to NToV on tuesday they would have been sitting on their ass in roy's pit for the better part of the evening.<br>
<br>
That's right, Dantos, obviously there are members of DH that want/need NToV gear.  Obviously DH didn't want to sit on their ass in roy's pit waiting on shit to pop.  Obviously CoP has proven that they will go sit in NToV on patch day regardless of shit being up.  Hmmm, what's all that mean?  It probably means that you guys were smart enough to realize you can't monopolize the whole god damned server anymore.  You wanted something you knew someone else would have taken, so you made a promise and you failed to keep it.<br>
<br>
Let me color it to you this way, what if your boss asked you to have a report on his desk and you told him you'd have it to him on tuesday.  You of course prance in his office on wednesday with said report, he says he's going to have to fire you, and you said oh you misspoke.  Do you think he gives a shit?  Where did you tell finnien it was a typo Dantos?  Normally typos are something like instead of spelling Dantos I spell Dsntos...notice how Wednesday and Thursday look nothing alike?<br>
<br>
Oh well, I'll let this go as a mistake.  Besides, I had fun as shit on thursday and would like to thank DH.  See, I was off killing one of those other targets and let me tell ya....2 clerics for IV is sorta a rush, especially with with people announcing how we were gonna lose.   Ah well, GG team two box.  GG twink clerics.  GG DH for making it happen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showMessageRange?topicID=510.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showMessageRange?topicID=510.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showMessageRange?topicID=510.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showMessageRange?topicID=510.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showMessageRange?topicID=510.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showMessageRange?topicID=510.topic&start=121&stop=125>7</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showPrevMessage?topicID=510.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showNextMessage?topicID=510.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=510.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.emailToFriend?topicID=510.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.threadControl?topicID=510.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=510.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=510.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm31">ANNOUNCEMENTS<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm39">GUILDS<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm8">The Tavern<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm32">Thanks and Praise<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm11">Flame Forum<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm34">Bottom Feeders<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm40">Crafter's Corner<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm5">Trader's Table<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm4">Raid Planning and Discussion<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm6">Non-EQ Discussions<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm7">Polls<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm14">The Epic Quester<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm9">Legends and Lore<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm35">Camelot Connections<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm15">Bard's Studio<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm37">Beastlord's Scratching Post<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm26">Cleric's Temple<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm16">Druid's Glade<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm23">Enchanter's Circle<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm22">Magician's Element<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm28">Monk's Dojo<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm21">Necromancer's Crypt<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm27">Paladin's Hall<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm30">Ranger's Lodge<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm17">Rogue's Hideout<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm20">Shadow Knight's Barrow<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm25">Shaman's Shrine<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm19">Warrior's Arena<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm18">Wizard's Tower<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm12">Need access to GM Den?<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm10">GM's Den<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm36">Moderators/Admins<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm2">Admins Discussion<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm13">Testing for Art<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm41">Testing....1, 2, 3...Testing</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bthecrossroadstavern8833>The Crossroads of Zebuxoruk</a><font color=#333333> -
