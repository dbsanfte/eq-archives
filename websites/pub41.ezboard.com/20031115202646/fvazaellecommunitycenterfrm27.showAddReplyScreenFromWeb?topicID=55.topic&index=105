<br>
The day before, Talvarien had run out of bows and had given up for the day. fingers blue and mind fried.  He spend most of today making new ones, and would try again with his team of ‘archers’ tomorrow.  Camille had spent the remainder of the day inspecting the remaining warriors and looking over their armor, and having them spar against one another.  She had finally chosen Gregor to be the main tank, given his brawn and rather singlemindedness in combat.  She told the warriors to meet at the snow dragon the next day, which had aquired four lumpish claws, a long neck, and a tail, thanks to the beastlords and rogues who were pretty much set in what they had to do during the dragon fight.  Brieah was working with the shaman on how to effectively time small heals to possibly keep a warrior alive long enough to tank Vox.  It was Camille’s job today to give the other warriors a specific job for dealing with a potentially dangerous ability Vox may use.<br>
<br>
“We’re low on tanks.” Camille said, pacing in the snow in front of the mock dragon while the seven men looked on at her.  “And I need Henrid and Donnigar off-tanking Vox’s two giant clerics, who will be trying to heal her.  That leaves us with five on Lady Vox herself.  Gregor is going to main tank her, and Sellock will be on call as the second assist, in case Gregor falls or gets feared off or can’t hold agro, for whatever reason.  Patror, you’re Sellock’s backup, in case the same thing happens again.  If we lose all three of  we’re in trouble.”  She looked at the remaining two men, McMillan and a warrior that went by the nickname Spike for the spiked collar he always wore.  “McMillan and Spike will be the shield men for keeping Vox from casting a Complete Heal on herself.  If she gets off that spell, and she’ll try, you’ll have to fight her all over again, and believe me, you won’t want to do it.  So, McMillan, Spike, you have your shields?”<br>
<br>
Spike just nodded, picking up his shield from the snow.  He carried it awkwardly and upside down.  McMillan just stood there, shield at his feet, glaring hostilely at Camille.  She sighed and turned her attention full to him.<br>
<br>
“McMillan, is there a problem?” she asked.  She was in no mood.  Grelin had not returned the night before and she was sick with worry, plus the cold and the barbarians reluctance to adapt to a difficult task was not helping things.<br>
<br>
“No problem.” McMillan said.  “Jest not gunna use that there shield.  I need both my weapons to chop the dragon up.”<br>
<br>
“I already told you…” Camille said, tired of repeating herself.  “The rogues are going to be providing much of the damage on Vox from behind.  Your job is stop Vox from casting any spells, especially healing herself.  That requires stuns, so you’ll have to use a shield to bash her from the side and stop her from getting off a Comp Heal.”<br>
<br>
“Warriors don’t use shields!” he challenged, face set stubbornly.  “I’d be providin’ half the damage I can put out!  I’m not a damned sissy that hides behind a piece ‘o metal!”<br>
<br>
“You’re not hiding behind the shield!” Camille retorted.  “You’re using it like a weapon!”<br>
<br>
“It’s not no weapon, it’s jest another piece ‘o armor, and I’m not givin’ up me offhand weapon to be running up against the side of no dragon like a ram buttin’ his head against a wall!  The beastlords have a spell that makes their warders magic and give ‘em the ability ta stun, let them do it!”<br>
<br>
Camille fought a losing battle with her patience.  “I already told you, McMillan.  We only have four beastlords.  Two each will be on her two giant cleric guards, using the warde’rs stun ability to keep the giants from healing her as well.  But the warder’s stun is a random thing, they don’t control it, it just happens when it happens.  On Lady Vox I need men who can watch and see when she’s going to heal, and stop her, on cue…”<br>
<br>
“I ain’t no beastlord’s pet!” McMillan exclaimed.  “I’ll keep the damned thing so hurt she won’t be able to think of no healin’!”<br>
<br>
“Fine, you think you can do that?” Camille asked, done with arguing with him.  She stood squarely in front of him, about 6 feet away.  Her eyes began glowing white, building up in power.<br>
<br>
“What are ya doin’?” McMillan asked, glancing at her nervously.  Her eyes had gone bright, and vacant, as she held her spell, her magic, in check.<br>
<br>
“I’m going to cast on you, McMillan.”  she said.  “And you’re going to stop me, the way you claim you can, with your two weapons there.”<br>
<br>
McMillan exchanged glances with his six companion warriors, then turned back to Camille.  “I uh…I can’t hit ya.  Yer a womman.”<br>
<br>
“So is Vox.”  Camille said flatly, eyes glowing brighter.  “Stop me from casting.”<br>
<br>
McMillan just shifted uneasily.  “That’s different.”<br>
<br>
“Aye.” Camille said.  “She’s going to try to kill you.  Me?  I’m just going to hurt you.”<br>
<br>
McMillan laughed a short little ugly laugh.  “Ya gunna hurt me huh?” he snorted.  He looked to Spike standing next to him.  “Ya hear that, Spike?  She’s gunna h…”<br>
<br>
STUN.<br>
<br>
The blast of power shot forth out of her eyes, knocking McMillon flat onto his back.  He blinked numbly up at the sky.<br>
<br>
“You were saying?”  Camille asked.  Spike uttered a laugh that McMillan silenced by staggering up to his feet and glaring at him.  Both weapons were in his hands.<br>
<br>
“Ok, womman, that’s how ya wanna play it.” he growled.  He took two steps towards Camille, arms swinging up, both swords flying in the air in a blur.<br>
<br>
STUN.<br>
<br>
This time McMillan didn’t land flat on his back, but he did end up plopped into the snow dragon, pushed back far enough to have his backside disappear into the snow.  Now the other warriors were chuckling openly at him.  His face had gone an ugly dark red.  Gregor teasingly picked up the shield sitting on the floor and handed it to McMillan.  McMillan just spat on the ground.<br>
<br>
“I can take a womman jest fine with no shield!” he snarled stubbornly.  Gregor just shrugged with a smile and let the shield drop to the floor.<br>
<br>
“Then take her, before she gives ya so many bruises ya can’t sit fer a week.” he suggested.<br>
<br>
That was enough for McMillan.  With a howl, he launched himself at Camille, coming in so close she could smell his warm breath.  Swords flashed in the sunlight.<br>
<br>
STUN.<br>
<br>
This one pushed McMillan straight into the snow dragon.  He disappeared in a puff of white powder.  The men laughed loud and jeered.  <br>
<br>
“Will you use the shield?” Camille called into the hole in the side of the dragon.<br>
<br>
“Never!” McMillan shouted back, sound muffled from the snow.<br>
<br>
Camille had had enough of arguing with him.  “Then you’re out, McMillan.” she said, as he stumbled out of the snow mound.<br>
<br>
“I’m what?” he asked.<br>
<br>
“You’re out.  You won’t follow orders, and your damage output is negligible if you don’t keep her stunned.”<br>
<br>
“You can’t jest take me out!” McMillan protested.  “I’m a good warrior!  The hells I’m out!”<br>
<br>
“Good warrior?” Gregor snorted, raising an eyebrow.  “Ya just got yer arse kicked by a womman.  I’d agree her eyes are somethin’ else, but she laid ya out like a newbie.”<br>
<br>
“Shaddup!” McMillan cried, ramming his shoulder into Gregor.  It caught the big barbarian by surprise, knocking him to the ground.  McMillan angrily sheathed his weapons and went to storm off.<br>
<br>
“Wait!” Camille cried, staring at Gregor blinking in a daze on the ground.  <br>
<br>
“What?” McMillan asked, spinning around angrily.<br>
<br>
“What did you just do to Gregor?” she asked.<br>
<br>
“I slammed him for being a wise arse.” McMillan retorted, and turned to leave.<br>
<br>
“Can you do that too?” Camille quickly asked Spike, a plan forming in her mind.<br>
<br>
“Sure.” Spike said, and then with a move she couldn’t quite follow, Spike slammed his shoulder into McMillan, knocking the big barbarian down into the snow next to Gregor.  McMillan cursed.<br>
<br>
“That would stop a spell from being cast…” Camille murmured, half to herself.  “…while leaving your hands free to dual weild your weapons.”<br>
<br>
“Aye.” Spike said, nodding.  “I imagine ya couldn’t get one of yer stuns out if I slammed ya.”<br>
<br>
Camille reached down and offered McMillan a hand up.  He stared at it.<br>
<br>
“I think you won’t have to use that shield after all, McMillan.” she said.<br>
<br>
He took her hand, and resisted the urge to squeeze it till she cried out.  Instead, he allowed her to help him to her feet.  “Good, cause I ain’t usin’ it.”<br>
<br>
“Let’s get working, gentlemen.” Camille said, helping up Gregor.  “We have to learn to time those slams, from all five of you.”<br>
<br>
And other than the nagging worry of Grelin not returning, the latter part of the day went much smoother than the former.<br>
