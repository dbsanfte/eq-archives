I had played a necromancer before this and he was too situational and almost too easy really. The pet was a blender and the dots and hp/mana spells made playing him a breeze. I needed more of a challenge and SK is right up near the top of tough to play classes (not that Verant made any class really tough, bard is the worst and still a moron can manage to get by).<br><br>I am a little disheartened about how the SK class ends up. Without a huge damage 2 hander they do next to no damage at all in a battle and are one of the most useless classes in a raid unless they get to pull. For all the fear a Shadowknight should invoke in his enemies a mob in EQ must be alot more terrified by Rangers and their 1500  attack, duel wielding, attack. Shadowknights are about as scary as a miniature bunny in comparison to the other classes of EQ. <p>Tropics Delight Shadowknight of the Greenmist</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukerai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1221<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/23/02 4:35:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2202.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So why did you pick your class?</span><hr size=1> I always like being a Necromancer and so I play one in damn near every game I play.

I knew that they owned the raiding game so I started another one when vaz went live. This is also a big reason I detest the whining noobs on graffe. Wizard = raid, and I don't want VI to start making them easier to play because people didn't research their class before playing it. If they make us easier to level, they will not continue to make us as strong as we are in the raiding game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubauldorsoulblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BauldorSoulblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 262<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/24/02 1:10:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2202.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So why did you pick your class?</span><hr size=1> I picked Paladin because I was playing Final Fantasy IV once and I restarted and got Cecil to become a Paladin, and he was so powerful from then with White Magic and Uber warrior skillz, and then I decided to play a Paladin in EQ. <p><img src="http://strike9.com/eq/file.aspx/path=/bauldor/fullsize/siggy.jpg"><BR><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=11985">Bauldor Soulblade</a</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uvaclavromanov.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vaclav Romanov</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 788<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/24/02 1:28:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2202.topic&index=15>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So why did you pick your class?</span><hr size=1> Erudite Cleric... because there was this Erud Cleric I met on Tholuxe who came to Kedge to rezz some of us and stuck around for a while in full EM... and I was stunned by how gorgeous it looked.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucomplained.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Complained</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/24/02 1:37:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2202.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So why did you pick your class?</span><hr size=1> I made a human rogue...why?...because i thought rogues were the ones with the bow...which later i found out it was ranger....i made human? because Dark Elves look freaky at first when i started game...halflings feet was gross...gnomes looks too weak...barbarian dont look rogish(back then i thoguht rogue was a ranger)....so wat we have left a Human With an eye patch...... <p>Pozer  ~ ......One Hug One Kiss And Gone Like Dis..... ~(60)Rogue Of Vazealle</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uaurianne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aurianne</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 686<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/24/02 3:42:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2202.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So why did you pick your class?</span><hr size=1> My first character was actually a high elf magician. Played him to level 12 or so, and then got it in my head that I needed money.<br><br>Natch, I'd seen wizards getting lots of money for ports, so I figured I'd create a wizard with which to twink my magician. Plan: get to 29, bind in EC, and keep Aurianne as a port-bish and EC dummy.<br><br>I still have the magician, but he's level 13, and I'm level 55, now.... Aurianne just sort of grew on me. By 12, I'd decided that the wizard class was better than the magician, because nukes are resisted a hell of a lot less, and they tend to hit harder. By 29, I'd joined a guild that I absolutely loved (hell, still love. I haven't changed guilds since level 22), and just kept playing. I love playing the wizard <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Oh, and yeah. I love playing high elves. My wizard, my cleric, and my magician are all pasties. Necro was a gnome, and enchanter is a gnome.  Human monk is the only melee I've ever levelled past 4 on vaz. Have an Ogre SK on test....<br><br><br>I've always played casters. Dunno why, but I just love magic. It fascinates me, and even when playing cyberpunk and high-tech GURPS campaigns, I usually play some sort of techno-mage, if the GM's rules allow. My secondary character type when that's not allowed is a netrunner. Oddly, I've never played a fantasy-set campaign that didn't allow magic, but would probably play a monk-type martial artist. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uladyfelidae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lady Felidae</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 234<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/24/02 4:28:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2202.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So why did you pick your class?</span><hr size=1> ShadowKnight Because they are Honorable and noble imo yet strong and dominanting.
