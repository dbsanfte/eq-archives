If someone threatens Goanad, and he winds up being dead afterwards, then it was true.<br>
<br>
Sure, there's risk involved but with your current board popularity, I don't think working on it any more than that is something anyone here cares to bother with.<br>
<br>
Now, could you please just tell Anika that you trumped up the idea of the threat against you, to get someone banned, so that for your own protection, Anika can ban you? You wanted the issue to be escalated, now follow through with it so we can find a new person to pick on.<br>
<br>
Saal<br>
<br>
PS Anika, you should add another rules: if anyone posts intent or threatens to bring legal action against vcc or it's admin, they will more than likely be banned. I don't think that you want to go gunslinging and remove people you don't like.. but you honestly shouldn't have to deal with people who are going to attack you in this manner. It's one thing to have someone not team you in game, it's another to threaten to waste hours of your time in real life. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uanikacrystalwind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anika Crystalwind</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Admin Gnome</span><br>  Posts: 1182<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/26/02 4:56:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=123>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Open letter to Anika</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I would like to think that sane, reasonable people can see through their hatred of me to realize that you CANNOT really judge something like that? <br>

Actually it's several questions coated with caracatures of me which I will not give the light of recognition due to their inaccuracy. <br>
<br>
I think I have stated my opinion in answer to Bakxs summary which I believe you agreed to as well. <br>
<br>
And the point remains sir, why does your intent seem bent on forcing victims of potential Rule #6 violators to assume the cloak of a judge upon being threatened? This is especially curious since you yourself have correctly resisted being thrust into the role of &quot;referee&quot; in these kinds of disputes. The issue of death threats and threats of physical violence should be on of those &quot;you don't go there&quot; areas. You just DO NOT cross that line, even if you are playing. <br>
<br>
Your initial impulse against having to be the judge in these matters is the right one AND it's my best argument for a hardline interpretation of Rule #6. Is there something about a hardline interpretation of Rule#6 that I am missing out on? Is the debate freedom of the community going to be diminished radically if death threats and threats of physical violence are ruled &quot;out of bounds?&quot; <br>
<br>
If you don't\can't\or just plain won't listen to anything I've said and really HEAR it.....at least TRY and understand that the foregoing two paragraphs are the gist of my point here. I believe that what they call for is a POSITIVE influence on VCC. <br>

<br>
So we are at an agree to disagree point? I strongly disagree. Until you've been in the heat of the moment, as an object of the threat, I would ask that you kindly reserve judgement. <br>
<br>
I'm still WTB an explanation for why VCC members should have to choose between admin ban, self-imposed ban, or having to judge the veracity and &quot;gravity&quot; of death threats made to them in ANY written forum when the rules for said forum could easily establish the act of a death threat, even in jest, as &quot;off limits&quot; territory? <br>
<br>
What is your motivation for handing me or anyone such a ridiculous choice when an easy alternative is present? <br>

Anyway, you are skirting the issue at hand.  Do you see that the threat was a valid one or not?  If you see the threat as real, you surely need to be banned before things get out of hand.  If not, please re-read my previous paragraph.  <br>

To answer that...  it is because many things are said in jest or a joking matter on these forums...  if everything were to be taken at face value, this place would be vastly different.  If what you are saying is true--Gae should have been banned a long time ago.  <br>

Make your daddy proud, be a fuckin man and quit crying like a fuckin woman (i love you laddies, no slam toward you, well, cept the fat ones).<br>
<br>
If you dont know by now that the rants and flames section is a crock(sp?) of shit your just that mush more fucked. Noone can be judged by any jerry springer shit said here. Its a place for us to all get together and talk trash, hence the insightful title of the forum.<br>
<br>
Your an elitist. Your political views as well as social are inept. The more you try to impress us with your &quot;Intellect(tm)&quot; the more we laugh at you.<br>
<br>
Your crusade to rid the VCC of the slanderings and trash talks has failed, and not needed. If someone says to you, they will kick your ass, simply ask them where to meet you, either you win or you lose, or it never fucking happens. Im sure glad my father taught me the meaning of pride instead of teaching me the meaning of prick, like your father taught you.<br>
<br>
Now, i have alleviated from my natural flaming styles in order to reach your superior self, but in the words of the Ganndon known to all the VCC....Your the biggest fucking pussy i have ever dealt with.<br>

So Bakxs why not admit up front that it's a personal vendetta against me and we can dispose all this sophistry and debate about rule x or y???? <br>

Actually it's several questions coated with caracatures of me which I will not give the light of recognition due to their inaccuracy. [/quote]Inaccuracy?  Allow me to quote you:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> How do you think my family feels? They perceive this community as &quot;anything goes&quot; where if you are in the group whose ideas have the most support you can do ANYTHING against those that you don't agree with. <br>
<br>
My family and I have just been specifically and clearly threatened by a post left on VCC. <br>
<br>
Do you have a wife sir? Do you have a family? Look at it as if I had made that threat to your loved ones. How would you feel?  How would you react? And then to have the board Admin come and post and basically blame you, the victim. I believe that you owe me and my family an apology. <br>
<br>
You can contact me personally at 281-xxx-xxxx or via email. I am very serious about this. If the person in question is not permanently banned, I will contact Ezboard and discuss why a threat of physical violence was made in my direction and despite the existence of a rule clearly specifying a banning of the offender, no permanent action was taken. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Yes, snippits of this were taken from e-mails sent to me as well.  They indicate that the so-called 'caracatures' of you are neither caracatures or inaccurate.<br>
<br>
Your supposed response to my question was contained in your response to Bakxs post, which was as far as I can tell, you agreeing with his assessment of what the key question in all of this is, which was basically a restatement of my repeted question, which are the questions you refuse to answer.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> So we are at an agree to disagree point? I strongly disagree. Until you've been in the heat of the moment, as an object of the threat, I would ask that you kindly reserve judgement. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I have been.  I've had death threats made against me by people that not only lived in the same city that I do, but knew where I worked, and would be easily able to find out where I live.  I've had a variety of threats to my personal safety made towards me while I ran Annihilated.com, both serious and not.  Fortunately, they've all panned out to be hollow threats, but I have been in the heat of the moment, therefore according to you I'm allowed to issue judgements in this issue.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I'm still WTB an explanation for why VCC members should have to choose between admin ban, self-imposed ban, or having to judge the veracity and &quot;gravity&quot; of death threats made to them in ANY written forum when the rules for said forum could easily establish the act of a death threat, even in jest, as &quot;off limits&quot; territory? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->This has moved beyond that.  My concern is that you don't whip your family into a frenzy over things you read on the VCC, and threaten to whip out the lawyers over every single word and letter of the VCC rules.  If you do take it that seriously, you need to stop reading the VCC for your own good, and if not, than you may indeed be sane, but your mock seriousness was a ruse simply to get someone you don't like banned.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Now that would clarifiy the situation if those holding the vendetta simply would come forth and admit it. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I don't have a vendetta against anyone - heck, before you made this post, I wouldn't have known you from Anywon to Baxks to Whomever.  I didn't know you in game, I don't know you personally, and I haven't bothered to go back to read your older posts to care one way or another.  If Bakxs had reacted the same way, I would be asking the same questions of him.  Along those lines, no one else admins the VCC, and I've never let myself succumb to mob rule as of yet, so other people disliking you isn't a factor in this either.<br>
<br>
I don't support anyone making threats of Real Life violence, that's why I edited away Prybutok's post, as clever as it was, but I didn't ban him, becuase it was obvious he intended no harm.  Same with Saalron's threat, again, empty words.  Even though you lack the contextual information you can get face-to-face talking with someone compared to the dry text of the Internet, you can still readily discern intent, and that is the spirit of why Rule #6 was created, why it exists, and why it will be enforced.<br>

Now, view the above statement. There are 3 thoughts you could have.<br>
a) The statement is truthful<br>
b) it is false<br>
c) fuck answering cause I'm a pussy and I dont answer direct questions<br>
<br>
What would you pick?<br>
you pick A, you are a moron and don't deserve anyone to listen to your shit. B, your statement is invalid because 'hardlining rule #6' would remove some of the humour here and no one cares about your pussy ass.<br>
I vote you will pick C tho since you seem to be a question dodger.

<br>
Vendetta against you?  For what?  Being an irritating fool?  In-game you and I have been cordial, if I recall correctly.  I don't think we've had any major debates or conversations on the VCC.  Although I may have called you a twit or an idiot, I don't think it's anything that I would call a vendetta.  <br>
<br>
As much as I post, joke &amp; attack--I don't think I have or had a vendetta against anyone on the VCC.  Granted, I do verbally spar with many people--some quite often.  I can't help it that some people are idiots and continually inspire to be post.  But to say I have something against any of them is pretty silly.  They may be stupid, idiotic, ignorant or all three--but hate any of them, no.  <br>
<br>
You seem to be confusing responses to your stupidity rather than a personal vendetta.  Just because I mock your stupidity doesn't meant I am out to get you for some past conflict.  Your inability to recognize real threats from jokes and your flawed view asking for me to admit I have some kind of personal vendetta against you is exemplifying how irrational and paranoid one can be.  <br>
<br>
I really think for your own sanity that you remove yourself, or if you can't control yourself, have yourself removed from these forums.  <br>

You have mischaracterized me again. My arguments here have carefully been focused on the subject matter of rule #6, NOT &quot;every single word and letter of the VCC rules.&quot; Why this need to mischaracterize? I am talking about a death threats- nothing more.<br>
<br>
What value do death threats add to this community? I feel like it's surreal &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; type thing even having to ask. <br>
<br>
Speaking of death threats you write:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I edited away Prybutok's post, as clever as it was <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
&quot;As clever as it was&quot; .... /boggle What I'm wondering if why you didn't ask &quot;what value does this threat add to this community&quot;......or, &quot;what is the positive contribution&quot; of this threat. I find it hard to believe that someone who was actually, according to their statements, the object of several death threats, would find ANY death threat or description thereof, &quot;clever.&quot; <br>
<br>
If you want entertainment and &quot;clever&quot; insert a DVD named &quot;Hannibal.&quot; I'll vouch for it's ability to entertain and cater to the dark side of human nature which deals with such banalities. I liked the movie too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Maybe I will never understand why there is so much love in VCC for death threats. But I can at least hope that you can see there are better ways and you can expect better from people. <br>
