Um, if he's not required to do it, why bring it up in the article? Alot of terrorists use the canadian border to gain access to the US, makes sense we would have an agreement with Canada to register islamic immigrants.<br>
<br>
Actually I can only think of 2 terrorists who tried sneaking from Canada to the US. All of the hijackers(14?) of 9/11 got into the US easier from elsewhere (and then lived there for how long?) than the guys trying from Canada.<br>
<br>
Atro:<br>
Instead of focusing their anger on the people who actually oppress them, they turn it on us.<br>
<br>
I don't actually object much to US foreign policy, but descriptions like that above are wrong. The US has supported tons of governments in ways to oppress their people. The Shah of Iran is a perfect example, they gave him military aid, etc. which he used to kill and 'disappear' his citizen's. No wonder the people were annoyed at the US and carried it over after they got rid of him.<br>
<br>
The one thing though a lot of people bitching about US policy don't seem to understand is its mainly to stabilize areas (even with dictators or governments like Indonesia's was) and help its citizens. And you know what? That's the point of a government, people elect those who help them, not some nameless people in some foreign country.<br>
<br>
The US is like all democratic countries, Canada (my country) included. If Canadian's really really cared about others more than themselves then we would elect the NDP, tell them to raise taxes 30% and donate 40 billion to be given to every poor person in the world. We don't though, we do donate and help people across the world, but we choose governments who help us, not others, first.<br>
<br>
If the people of the democratic countries ever decide they don't like bad foreign governments, world poverty, pollution, etc. and vote that way over domestic concerns like how much gas costs, feeding their own children, then all those things will disappear. Until then, blaming high profile governments like the US's for doing what every government  does is silly. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71225 >Vanidor Silverbranch</a>, 28th Wizard,

<br>
Before you jump on your anti-american soapbox next time please do us all a favor and give us something worthwhile to think on.<br>
<br>
I have done extensive searching and am convinced that there are no treaties, accords, protocols or agreements in place between the United States and any other country or political body that have established airport lounges as &quot;international territory&quot;.<br>
<br>
From the beginning this did not sound right.  If you get in a fight in an airport bar you go to a local jail, not to a federal holding facility.  Even Maritime law tells you that, at a minimum, once you are within 12 miles of a country's coastline you are subjuct to their laws for the duration of your time within that 12-mile boundary.<br>
<br>
Why on earth would Maritime law establish a 12-mile law-inclusive boundary yet inland airports have a mysterious pocket somewhere in a terminal that fell under &quot;international law&quot;?<br>
<br>
Of interest: Even the embassies we host in our country are not ever considered to be sovereign soil of the hosted country.  Some staff individuals (i.e. Ambassador, Consular, etc.) are sometimes granted Diplomatic Immunity but that is for their person and possessions only - not the facilities they occupy.  It is well known that while we customarily make no overt attempts to interfere with any embassy's operations we have no qualms about tapping their phone lines, net connections, etc.  C'est la vie.  So, an Ambassador to the United States from a friendly, allied, NATO-member country doesn't even have a &quot;get out of jail free card&quot; inside his/her embassy but anyone drinking Zima in an airport bar does? ROFL<br>
<br>
By the way, there is no specific &quot;international law&quot; body... no court, no legislature, no enforcers.  There is a &quot;World Court&quot; but it is not recognized by the United States, and as far as I can tell Canada never signed on either.  Even that court is more of a self-described &quot;mediation&quot; service that cannot and will not hand out actual judgements.<br>
<br>
&quot;International Law&quot; refers to treaties, pacts, accords, etc. that have been signed by two or more sovereign parties, and only those parties involved as signers of those deals are subject to them.<br>
<br>
I wholeheartedly doubt that the U.S. ever signed any such agreement that would toss away our control over our own airport facilities, and if we had (which I can find no evidence of) then even under the accepted tenets of establishing/de-establishing international law our &quot;Patriot Act&quot; (signed early this year) or our upcoming &quot;Homeland Security Act&quot; would supercede it and render moot any previous agreements.<br>
<br>

Do you honestly believe that the only one concerned about the world's stability is the US? Do you believe that US is the saviour of us all?!<br>
<br>
Last I was away there were only 2 countries in open support of any action the US will take, that was the UK, and Australia.<br>
<br>
Unsure about the UK, but our population is against it all, but we don't have to think about political implications like the Prime Minister does (he was even in the US last week)<br>
<br>
As for open military support, my brothers ship leaves for the Middle East in under 2 weeks. With ships already over there (we have had a precence over there for quite some time). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/upigboyph.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PigboyPH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Uber Gimp~</span><br>  Posts: 1460<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/20/02 1:50:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1722.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: er...</span><hr size=1> Did we all forget this man is a criminal?

It's one thing if someone is immigrating to the States, it's entirely another thing if they're in transit.  I've flown in the US from Middle-Eastern countries several times recently and don't recall any announcment letting Middle-Eastern nationals know they need to register.  I can't see a specific reason why this particular enforcement was bad, though... as we were helping Syria apprehend one of their wanted nationals, I'm just not fond of the justification for the apprehension when there were plently of other sufficient ones much more closely related to the presumable reason for the apprehension.  It's one of those precedent things.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I'm very concerned about the viewpoint and in some cases ignorance being put forth by a number of people here.  Though I think the US was a bit mean-spirited in this case, they did nothing outside of what was legal.  However, the idea that we shouldn't care for or respect international law is careless.  The idea that we're more important than the rest of the world is tragic.  Of course, given that's been the viewpoint, to greater or lesser degrees of pretty much every administration since Wilson, I'm hardly surprised.  Further the idea that the US goes into other nations 'for their own good' is ludicrous.  Yeah,  Columbia sure needed us to stabalize their government and form a splinter republic so we could build a canal on the cheap.  Hawai'i certainly needed us to stabalize by supporting the ousting of the stable, legitimate government by sugar plantation owners concerned about their bottom line.  Our stabalizations in Vietnam and Iran certainly went wonderfully.  Cuba was certainly in a downright state of revolt when the Bay of Pigs happened.  Good thing for the Cubans we intervened.  Our current support of Columbia's regime is doing wonders for the stability in that region... doing little more than allowing the government to maintain a stalemate against a succesful revolutionary campaign.  The people always benefit from a perpetual state of war, right?  And who could forget Granada?  Heaven forbid we had not invaded Granada and stopped that powderkeg from plunging the entire East Carribean into war.  And though Afghanis are likely benefitting from our intervention and removal of the Taliban, we didn't go there for the sake of stabalization.<br>
<br>
My point here is that everything the US does isn't for the good of the people of the region we're leading an intervention into and stabalizing is often contrary to our goals in the region.  Our actions aren't always bad, nor are our goals always wrong, but keep in mind we aren't often doing things for any goals but our own.  That's okay, just don't take it as something else.<br>

I suggest you read the article again, please.<br>
<br>
Labeled a Criminal only because he didn't serve his mandatory military service in Syria(immigrating to Canada for a better life had something to do with that).  Syria's human rights records is horrible, can you blame him.<br>
<br>
Maher Arar is a Telecommunications Engineer that has been a Canadian citizen for 15 years.  Two children born in Canada, was traveling under his own Canadian passport.<br>
<br>
What scares me the most about this whole thing is the fact that no one seems to care that every person with light brown skin is guilty until proven innocent in the US at the moment.<br>
<br>
As a forth generation Canadian of German decent, I can't help but wonder what you would like to prosecute me for.  Then again, I'm very fortunate to be white and can blend into the accepted people very well.<br>
<br>
I wonder who's next?  Black's beware!! your mandatory service to the cotton fields are coming soon......<br>
<br>
I understand why US citizen's are a little on edge lately about their security on their own soil, and I understand mistakes will happen, but I don't understand at the total lack of caring for another human being on this thread.<br>
<br>
News flash people!!!! We all live on the same planet making the walls higher around your home doesn't change that, never will..... <br>

Basically, I don't care about the civil rights of someone who has a history of terrorist/Al Qaeda connections.<br>
<br>
I'm willing to give the homeland security office a bit of leeway here to prevent terrorism.  If someone has had ties to terrorism in the past, I'm really not too concerned about his civil rights.  It's not about skin color.  Do you know how many muslims/arabs pass through that airport daily without incident?  In the thousands for sure, and many don't even have a canadian passport.  Obviously SOMETHING about this guy caught their eye.  If you think it was just skin color, explain all the other people with similar skin color that have no problems.<br>
<br>
Maybe his ties to terrorism were only in the past, but anyone that has had those ties has brought increased scrutiny upon himself.  That's the price you pay for associating with terrorists.<br>

I suggest you go to your local Muslim Mosk and ask them if they are feeling prosecuted unfairly.  <br>
<br>
Thousands of people that look Muslim everyday are harassed at airports, supermarkets, malls and neighborhoods.<br>

I applaud the job President Bush is doing in combatting terrorism, look at the weight he has on his shoulders.  It's a lot easier to criticize when you don't carry the same burden.<br>
