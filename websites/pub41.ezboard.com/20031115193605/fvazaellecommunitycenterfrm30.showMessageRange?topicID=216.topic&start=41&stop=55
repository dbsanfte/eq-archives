Second, your Robin Hood analogy is a load of bullshit.  It might just be a bit more applicable if you are robbing drug lords that torture, rape, and murder massive numbers of people to accumulate their wealth to give to the poor.  Then is it right to steal their wealth to redistribute?  Maybe, maybe not, thats a matte of morals.<br>

Neither of these is true.  He came to power on his own.  After he got into power, he was supported by many of the western powers, including the US, because he offered a secular alternative to the islamic fundamentalist states so common in the region.<br>
<br>
We really stopped supporting him when he gave us reason to do so.<br>
<br>
We had nothing to do with his developing WMD's.  We did help arm him with conventional weapons during the Iran/Iraq war because we believed he was the lesser of two evils.  The vast majority of his military machine was, however, Soviet in origin.  Just look at the names of his vehicles.  His planes were Migs for example, and his tanks were also soviet (T72 or something like that).<br>

<br>
We need to get over our kneejerk hostility towards fundamentalist islam (note fundamentalist and extremist are 2 different things, the muslims themselves make this distinction, we usually dont). Its what made an enemy of Iran. Syria and Libya are secular. Iraq was secular. Are they our friends? We need to stop meddling in the internal affairs of islamic countries and support self determination in the region, its our only way of geting out of this mess. Putting in a truly liberal democratic government in Iraq is the only option that will let us hold the moral high ground. The Extremists will agitate but for the average muslim it will be acceptable. I will be suprised if we let it happen though.<br>
<br>
We traded away our ideals for the love of oil and the hypocrisy isnt lost on the people of the region. <br>

What I was saying has nothing to do with the tactical decision of dropping a nuclear weapon.

His argument wasn't about the tactical advantages.  It was about the ethics.  He is arguing from a utilitarian ethical point of view that dropping the bomb was a moral thing to do.  I'm not sure what I think, just pointing out what I think you missed in his argument.<br>

Actually, we know now that there was no need to drop the bomb or to invade Japan. Long before the Enola Gay dropped its cargo, Emporer Hirohito was trying to talk about possible terms of surrender using Russia (who was not at war with Japan) as an intermidiary. <br>
<br>
Germany was already defeated and the cold war was warming up. Truman went against the urging of all his advisors and decided to drop the bomb. That way we could win the war without giving Russia the important position of having brokered peace for the world. <br>

  The peace agreement that Hirohito attempted to broker via the Soviet Union was a conditional surrender, with one of the primary aspects being that Japan would not be occupied.

I see your point though.  Was it worth all those lives (either through invasion or through the dropping of the bomb) just to get them to surrender?  Could we have lived with a truce in which we didn't actually win?<br>
