Now remember, the entire Whitewater investigation originated out of a land sale long before Clinton took office.  Looks like Mr. Cheney has decided to use his elective position to start the first scandal of the new administration.  As I recall, Republicans took the morale high road, clammoring that Clinton should just be forthcoming and disclose what he knows.  Hmmm, wonder why Mr. Cheney has refused to cooperate with his own government and now has the Dubyious (pun intended) distinction of being the first Vice President ever (gee, even Nixon didn't get this bad) to be cited by the GAO.  One can only wonder what he is hiding?  Maybe it was Dick Cheney who killed Vince Foster--better get good ole Bob Barr on the case:<br>
<br>
                                       The investigative arm of Congress demanded Wednesday<br>
                                       that Vice President Dick Cheney identify all the industry<br>
                                       leaders who helped formulate the Bush administration's<br>
                                       energy policy. Refusal could lead to a court fight. <br>
<br>
                                       The White House, which is reviewing the request, said it<br>
                                       would work with the General Accounting Office to<br>
                                       resolve the issue. <br>
<br>
                                       <b>The GAO letter follows repeated refusals<br>
                                       by the vice president's office to provide<br>
                                       names and titles of participants who<br>
                                       met with the energy task force chaired<br>
                                       by Cheney. </b><br>
<br>
                                       Under the law, the GAO could sue if the<br>
                                       Bush administration fails to supply the<br>
                                       data within 20 days. <br>
<br>
                                       <b>This is the first demand letter ever issued by the GAO to<br>

                                       Reps. John Dingell and Henry Waxman, who directed the<br>
                                       agency to review the task force's work nearly three<br>
                                       months ago.  </b><br>
<br>
                                       The vice president's lawyer has told the GAO there were<br>
                                       nine meetings of the task force and that staffers also<br>
                                       met with many people to gather information. <br>
<br>
                                       The result was an energy policy, announced May 17,<br>
                                       that is aimed at increasing the nation's supply of energy.<br>
                                       It includes expanded oil and gas drilling on public land<br>
                                       and a rejuvenated nuclear power system. <br>
<br>
                                       White House spokeswoman Anne Womack said the letter<br>
                                       is under review and "we will continue to work with the<br>
                                       GAO to resolve this issue." <br>
<br>
                                       The vice president's office "has continued on its course<br>
                                       of secrecy and obstinance," Dingell said in a statement. <br>
<br>
                                       "The White House should simply try telling the truth ...<br>
                                       and stop hiding information that Congress and the public<br>
                                       have a right to see," said Waxman. <br>
<br>
                                       The White House's position is that the GAO is entitled to<br>
                                       information on the task force's costs, but that the<br>
                                       congressional watchdog agency doesn't have authority<br>
                                       to ask for lists of those with whom the task force met. <br>
<br>
                                       Waxman is also pressing for a Justice Department<br>
                                       investigation of Karl Rove over the Bush political<br>
                                       strategist's energy-related meetings. <br>
<br>
                                       The White House has acknowledged that Rove<br>
                                       participated in meetings on the administration's energy<br>
                                       policy while he owned stock in energy companies such<br>
                                       as Texas-based Enron Corp. The White House has<br>
                                       supplied no details on Rove's meetings. <br>

Spio, <br>
You cant seriuosly call this a scandal can you? The Democrats are just blowing smoke to pull the heat away from there own problems.<br>
<br>
So Cheney met with some industry big wigs to talk about the problems that faced the industry. Why shouldnt he?<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
                                         (Washington, DC) Judicial Watch, the public interest law firm<br>
                                         that investigates and prosecutes public corruption, sued Vice<br>
                                         President Dick Cheney over his Energy Task Force. The Energy<br>
                                         Task Force is not in compliance with the Federal Advisory<br>
                                         Commission Act (FACA) and the Freedom of Information Act<br>
                                         (“FOIA”), which mandates that documents, Task Force members,<br>
                                         meetings, and decision-making activities be open to the public.<br>
                                         Judicial Watch filed its complaint in D.C. federal court on July 16,<br>
                                         20001. The case is before The Honorable Emmet G. Sullivan and is<br>
                                         captioned Judicial Watch v. National Energy Policy Development<br>
                                         Group. The White House has refused to make information available<br>
                                         not only to Judicial Watch, but also the General Accounting Office.<br>
<br>
<br>
                                         The lawsuit alleges that the Energy Task Force “must file a<br>
                                         charter, must allow input from interested persons, must comply<br>
                                         with the FOIA and the Government in the Sunshine Act, must<br>
                                         publish notice of its meetings in the Federal Register, and must<br>
                                         have a board that is fairly balanced in terms of the points of view<br>
                                         represented...” Judicial Watch is also demanding its right to attend<br>
                                         future Task Force meetings.<br>
<br>
                                         “Judicial Watch is concerned that energy policy is being made in<br>
                                         secret by individuals and interests with a financial and political<br>
                                         stake in particular policies. If the Vice President wants to involve<br>
                                         the oil industry or environmentalists in his Energy Task Force’s<br>
                                         deliberations, so be it, but the law requires that the American<br>
                                         people be kept informed about these deliberations,” stated Judicial<br>
                                         Watch Chairman and General Counsel Larry Klayman.<br>
<br>
                                         “This is the Hillary Health Care Task Force, Part II – which was<br>
                                         also in violation of FACA. Being conservative, Judicial Watch<br>
                                         generally believes in a less regulatory environmental policy. Yet<br>
                                         this doesn’t mean that such policies be developed in a way which<br>
                                         violates the law. We hope Vice President Cheney will come to<br>
                                         understand this,” added Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.<br>

<br>
John Stossel did a program on ABC titled &quot;Tampering with the environment&quot;. In the special he debunked every enviromentalist myth in this country. Out of the scientists who studied the problem I think 15 created the kyoto accords and like 1000 abstained for signing it because they say there is insufficent evidence that it will ever occur. Global warming is not a problem, even if the temperarture goes up one degree every 100 years it will increase on average higher in the coldest areas like Siberia for example. Go ask the people in Siberia if they mind if the temperature goes up a degree..<br>
<br>
Its all just fear mongering, crusaders need a cause and if they dont have a real one they will invent one just to feel good about themselves.<br>

Global Warming has more implications than just the average yearly temperature raising.  Global warming is supposedly caused by too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, no?  That chemical gets there from emmisions from factories and refineries and such.  Along with that chemical other gases are released which deplete our Ozone too I believe.<br>
    Global Warming is also increasing the temperature of the oceans.  With that increased temperature, it makes hurricanes and the like more potent and last longer.  I believe I just heard that recently in the news that East Coast cities are going to be at a huge risk because of this.  <br>
    Our ice caps in the polar regions are melting as well.  Glaciers are disappearring.  All these problems are not caused by global warming?  Global warming is not a problem?  I think differently <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The hardest part about &quot;global warming&quot; is the fact that it is known that the planet regularly changes temperatures. hence the reason the US is not still covered in glacial ice.  the funniest part is I wonder how many of these &quot;OMG the earth is gonna overheat!&quot; scientists are the smae ones pushing the 'global cooling' effect that was thought in the 60's (70's?)?<br>
  First it is global warming that causes all the bad storms, then it is El Nino, next year it will be peruvian anteater farts that cause the weather pattersn to shift, the year after that cosmic radiation fromn the galactic core...<br>
  I would propose that any scientist that has reasonable proof of what is going on makes a model for the next 5 years (and farther) publicly post it for all to see and lets see how close s/he is.  most of the current science on global warming is this: gee, the average temperature has gone up lately.  First they say GW causes the warmer winters we had, then the colder winters.  GW is to some scientists, what foreigners were to Archie Bunker, blame 'em, everything is their fault.<br>
