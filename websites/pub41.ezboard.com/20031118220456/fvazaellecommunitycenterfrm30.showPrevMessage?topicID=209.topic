<br>
Personally, I think the imperialist stuff is bullshit.  The US is unique in that every time we win a war, we walk away and gain no territory in the process.  The last war we actually gained territory in was the Spanish American War in 1898 (I think Guam is all we have left), despite fighting and winning numerous wars since.  If we were imperialist, we'd now control Kuwait, Panama, Yugoslavia, the Philippines, parts of Europe (including Germany), a large chunk of Korea, etc.  We routinely give up territory we have conquered, which is overwhelming evidence that we are not imperialists.<br>
<br>
I think that Gulf War sickness is very real.  I'm not completely convinced that it's from depleted uranium, and the science is really inconclusive.  There is a cause to it, and it's not psychological, but we honestly don't know what it is.  We need more research money and it needs to be taken seriously.  It is interesting that 9600 young men and women have died.  That's not from Gulf War sickness, but it's quite possible that there are increased levels of cancer resulting from exposure to radiation.  It's very suspicious.<br>

I'm still undecided on the issue.  I've heard it said (a news story I believe) that if you took a sampling of the same number of people from all over the US, and compared it to those who were in Iraq at the time of the 1st war, the number of people getting sick and/or dying were fairly proportionate.  <br>
<br>
In other words, take 100,000 people who weren't there, and 100,000 who were, there wouldn't be a huge difference.  I won't back this up with data.  Not interested enough to look for it, and my memory may be wrong. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=janusshadowsong>JanusShadowsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/26/03 7:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=207.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So that I'm understanding this.. </span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I wouldn't say anything has been censored.

<br>
I consider myself quite a newshog, but I never heard about the US removing pages from the Iraqi weapons declaration because they painted American corporations in a bad light.  What's up with that?<br>
<br>
As far as plans to &quot;provoke&quot; terrorist groups, that may not necessarily be a bad thing.  And I don't buy the connection between the depleted uranium and Gulf War illness.<br>
<br>
One story that didn't make the top ten but I considered HUGELY underreported was the US backing of a   <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,688071,00.html" target="top">failed coup</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> against a democratically elected government in Venezuela.

During the Iraq war the American media agreed to censor themselves. They obliged themselves to be patriotric and therefore give their support for the war and as far as possible avoid reporting news that would discredit or disrespect their forces in any way. While their motivations were admirable, it meant the American news was not objective and seemed very biased. <p>---------------<br>

<br>
Actually, imperialism is the desire to gain territory, so we aren't imperialist.<br>
<br>
Do we seek to spread our values and influence throughout the world?  Sure, of course we do.  I'm glad we do, since freedom is always a noble goal.<br>
<br>
As for underreported or not, it's primarily because of what the American population wants to hear.  The problem is that so many Americans are morons.  Most Americans are more interested in hearing about Joe Millionaire on the news than about the war in Iraq.  If you don't like what news is being reported, find a way to disseminate the news you want reported.  No one is stopping you.  The first amendment guarantees us freedom of the press.  It doesn't guarantee you that other people will report what you want to see reported.<br>

Either way though, the media can report whatever it wants to, as long as it's true.  They don't have to report everything.  If you don't like it, go make another media outlet and report what you want.  We have freedom of speech in this country for exactly that reason.<br>

You can poll individual reporters about their personal political leanings if you want, and even I will agree with you that the majority would be liberal.  But the content, tone, and emphasis of what is covered, and how much it is covered, is decided by suits, and those suits ultimately answer to boardrooms who are conservative to the last man.<br>
<br>
The statement &quot;the media is liberal&quot; is so counter-intuitive that it boggles the mind.  Saying &quot;Dan Rather is a liberal reporter,&quot; is no big deal.  Saying &quot;Viacom is a liberal institution that deliberately slants the news,&quot; is just absurd.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 2127<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/29/03 10:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=207.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /</span><hr size=1> The bias of the reporters is very clear.

As for the suits, they don't usually care much either way, as long as they are making money.  They just put shows on the air that people want to watch.  Take Rupert Murdoch for example.  He's a pretty conservative guy.  However, he routinely allows TV shows that conservatives rant about for sexual content, poor morality, etc.  Why?  Simple.  He makes money with it.<br>
