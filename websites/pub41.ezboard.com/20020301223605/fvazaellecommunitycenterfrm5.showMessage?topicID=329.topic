<br>
I have noticed a terrible thing since I have returned to Vazaelle and EQ. Guilds on Vazaelle are no longer having fun. Guilds that used to chat with each other, guilds that used to have joint raids, or a war in the arena. Now all people seem to be doing is bitching about loots and spawns, or threatening other guilds that get in their way.<br>
<br>
I wish I had enough time to start a guild that aimed at purely having fun, much like Promethian Order in the good ole days. We got alot done and were one of the more powerful guilds of that day but we also had fun doing it. We would post screenies of raids and add interesting bubble speech, we would take light jabs at other guildmates in good fun, and most important we all had a blast hanging out with each other exploring the world. The best time I ever had in the game of everquest was the day PO raided The dwarfs in Velious. It was new for me and many others, and the guild was working like a solid group of good friends.<br>
<br>
I am not sure what is going on of late, I was away for quite a while and ever since I got back the people are different and the mood on the server is nowhere near as light as it once was. People like Sslanis, Zozz, Karp, and others that brought pure fun to this server are gone for the most part and the good people that remain are in a great minority. Even people that were once in it for the fun are now darker of spirit and not nearly as outgoing as they once were, perhaps even I am begining to get worn down by the darkness around me.<br>
<br>
I will try and keep my spirits up though despite the environment around me. Yesterday in LOIO (the lower level zones still have some fun) the whole zone got into a good monty python spin, with people spitting out their favorite lines from the show and movies. There for a time was no talk of killstealing and the like. Sure the occasional person told us to take it to tells but we kindly asked them to take their non monty python talk off of our OOC channel =)<br>
<br>
Fun can still be had in this game and on Vazaelle. There are still good people around on our server both at the high levels and people still working their way up. What we people who still want to have fun with this game have to do is make sure to keep our spirits up. We have to look at the people who infringe on other peoples fun with malice in their hearts and a grin on their face, and instead of argue and fight with them we should pity them as lepers who have had the first thing to drop from their person be their personality. In time I feel even the most selfish of the guilds will grow weary of their lives outside of normal society. They will realise playing the game only for themselves leaves them with lots of loot, and few freinds to show it off to. The loot is twice as sweet if you earn it with honor and dont step on people's toes to get it.<br>
<br>
I hope some day a guild starts with people who just want to have fun and dont worry about loot (perhaps one exists, I am out of touch with many people since my return). A guild who could enjoy killing a creature such as the monster in The Swamp of No Hope who has no loot, just because &quot;they had not done it and it was fun&quot;. I will personally raid anywhere I have not been for the experience alone and the fun to be had. Loot is only as important as to keep me from dying. I may not be twinked in great gear, but I get by and that suits me fine. Perhaps one day I will get some nocivitant armor or a neat sword to replace my stallagterror spine spear, perhaps not, either way I am doing alright and the spear has meaning as it was a gift from a friend (Sslanis) anyhow.<br>
<br>
Well this has turned into way more of a rant then I was planning. I hope people think about the way they play the game when they read it and think about whether their way is the way they have the most fun possible. Being uber does not require being greedy or dominant over other people. The people at the top of a server have a great opportunity to lead the servers path and create a environment of mutual cooperation and respect. And in the end, everone has more fun<br>

Your idea of fun may be talking about movies in /ooc, another's may be attaining the ultimate set of gear, another's may be questing. And everyone will conflict eachother.

<br>
Everything is so subjective that you can't possibly &quot;plea&quot; for one single prevailing attitude on a server. Why should everyone conform to the way one person thinks a server should run idealy?...Maybe some people LIKE arguing with other guilds, not saying that I do, but I can see rivalry possibly being very fun.<br>
<br>
People play all games for one reason, fun. But in a game like EQ there can be many different views on what fun may be. It is nobody's right to tell someone how they &quot;should&quot; act on a server, especially if it will decrease the amount of fun they have....well, only if it's not interfering with someone else's enjoyment.<br>

I play this game for fun and fun alone, if I wasn't having fun, I'd quit. There are different people in the world, with different views; the same goes for Norrath. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/utropicsdelight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TropicsDelight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/5/01 3:45:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=329.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: paradox</span><hr size=1> People's differing playing styles may affect each other to a small degree but I would tend to say that movie chatter in /ooc is easy to deal with (by turning off /ooc). A powerleveler also can level to his hearts content and not step on anyones toes or get on anyones nerves to a great degree. These small differences are understandable and are cool. As you said people play the game different ways for different goals and should be allowed to do so.<br>
<br>
But, if your powerleveling requires that you log on and begin to killsteal from a group because they are camping the spawn you want is that cool? I would tend to think not but maybe you believe this is fine, perhaps you also feel this is wrong. <br>
<br>
Now lets look at a guild of people in around the level 50 range that are buffing to fight Lozidal for the very first time in what will be a very tough fight for them. Suddenly 2 groups of level 60's run up to turtle and proceed to demolish it as they have no need to spend preparations on what is now an easy spawn for them. Is this right and cool?<br>
<br>
Imagine a guild is buffing to kill a mob such as Trakanon and suddenly a monk from a rival guild comes running in with a huge train and feigns death right at their feet causing the complete wipeout of the buffing guild. At their death the monks guild moves in buffs quickly and kills the dragon. Is this cool? Perhaps I think this is a fine and dandy strategy to deal with other guilds in my way. Who is to tell me that I should not play the game this way?<br>
<br>
These are three examples of things that people have to make a choice about. All of them could be done in the game and if we use the excuse that &quot;people should be allowed to play the way they want&quot; then these are totally fine tactics. I played on Tallon Zek for most of my EQ career and I will tell ya I have been to hell when dealing with people. I have seen the worst people can do in this game that would make people on this server run screaming from their computer or petition the offending party immediatly. You cannot have it both ways. you either want a general moral code which the majority of the server can agree on or you can have anarchy. Either way is cool, I am a SK and can feign death in the most interesting places. Would you tell me I was wrong to train 100 people and cause them to lose exp and do a 2 hour CR?<br>
<br>
The way this game is made levels and gear are critical to doing the bigger stuff. A guild starts at collecting basic gear and then goes up through the mobs, begining with the easier ones and working their way up as they equip themselves better and better. You really must kill the Trakanon level stuff before you kill the Dains and Yeleniaks of the world because you need that gear to take that tougher stuff. The guild that gets out of the gates first has the advantage of getting the gear one step ahead of everyone else. Furthermore the most powerful guild has the ability to hoard all of the easier mobs such as Trakanon, Venril, Lozidal, ect... keeping all other guilds from taking the steps they themselves took. Take the example of the level 60's comming in and taking the kill. How is the lower level guild to one day raise to the next level of stuff if they are not able to take the steps that the people ahead of them already took? One thing you must relise is the higher level guild never had to deal with killstealing or higher level people beating them to the punch, they were afforded the ability to buff up and fight the turtle in due time when they were ready, which they did not allow the lower guild to do. Once a guild gets above everyone else it is very easy for them to stay ahead and keep the rest down. They will have free reign of the tougher mobs in the game because they are the only people equiped to deal with them, and at the same time they can make sure through killing the lower level stuff quickly, which is then routine to them, that noone else will catch them any time soon. Is this right? I am not going to say yes or no. I have seen the worst this game has to offer and I want all to know that you make the bed you lie in. If you want anarchy then let it reign surpreme. When you are buffing to fight the AoW in one of the toughest fights in the game and a person pulls it onto the buffing party prematurly causing the mass death of all involved dont you dare bloody petition! You eat that exp loss and you like it cause now you are playing with no preformed thoughts of right or wrong, people play the way they want and if you dont like it tough. You just lost your level because of the train? boo fucking hoo, at least it made a 1337 screenshot for me seeing all you guys getting stepped on. Most fun I ever had in EQ, just the way I like to play. You want no rules there ya go then, lets play. <p>Tropics Delight Shadowknight of the Greenmist</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usiggymk5.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SiggyMk5</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 245<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/5/01 5:51:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=329.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www-scf.usc.edu/~rabiega/sigs/icon.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: paradox</span><hr size=1> The leezard will return....<br>

Wow, Biship and Tropics hopping around the same thread.  My good ol' 1st gen SK buds =)<br>
<br>
I dunno, I've never been on a server that didn't go sour when multiple guilds finally became truly powerful and level 55-60s were no longer a rarity or curiosity.  The thing that seperates some servers I've been on from others is how they handle it in the long run.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm out of touch with Vaz since I haven't really been able to play for a few months now, but, hey, I still have hope.  Anyway, a couple people still owe me favors and I'd hate to leave those unredeemed =p<br>
