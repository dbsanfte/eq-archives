Why is it that Breill and Menexia feel the need to come into what was a moderately rational discussion and start swearing and mouthing off about things they don't have a full understanding of?<br>
<br>
Let me elaborate:<br>
<br>
VS: We were in the prep room with sufficient force to take out VS long before you guys even zoned in.  We didn't take VS because PO was there as well and they were making an attempt.  If you are trying to say we stole your VS, then you only have a couple of possible arguments that I can think of.  <br>
<br>
1) That we didn't have sufficient force.  We didn't GAIN any manpower between the time you entered prep room until the time we killed VS.  Logically it follows that since we killed VS on that attempt we had sufficient manpower BEFORE you entered prep room.<br>
<br>
2) That pulling his surrounding guard mobs allows you to lay claim to VS while sitting in the prep room does not.  This of course goes contrary to what so many of your members are saying about &quot;claiming&quot; mobs, namely that to claim a mob you have to be actually pulling it.  Had we known you would have respected our &quot;claim&quot; to VS if we had pulled guards we would have.  Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any consistency with respect to your policy on this.<br>
<br>
Saying we stole your VS implies that you had a claim to him before us.  What exactly allowed you to lay claim to VS?  If you guys had been in the prep room with sufficient force before us, WE would have respected your claim.  I'm not trying to say that you need to afford us the same respect, I'm ASKING what exactly you consider a claim.  Our position is clear, what is yours?<br>
<br>
One more thing about that VS topic...It would seem to me that this one incident goes against the stated policy of IV to allow other guilds their one shot.  Obviously we weren't allowed our shot so again, what about the situation made you feel we didn't deserve that one shot?<br>
<br>
Now as far as Menexia's bash on Kaminya.  Yes she plays both Kaminya and Gurgu.  Yes to an outsider that might look suspicious.  The fact, however, is that if you knew anything about what you are talking about you would know that our guild had a specific loot policy at the time the items for that epic was awarded.  You know who decided that she get that epic?  The WHOLE GUILD.  Through a voting process she won the items for the epics and if anyone has a problem with that then they either a) don't agree with the loot policy of the time, or b) don't agree with the decision of the majority of Endless members.  Kami had basically 1 vote out of the entire guild...her vote counted no more or less than anyone else and if I remember correctly, she didn't even vote for herself.<br>
<br>
Again, why is it that outsiders (apparently all from IV) feel the need to get involved in situations that they don't know the full story behind and have no stake in?  Reread this whole thread.  Various people have repeatedly bashed our guild, were presented with rational and logical refutations, then abruptly dropped the subject or instead focused on minutae.  Regarding Krimzin and Trak, yes I was wrong about OOC, it was in shout apparently.  And while YOU may not think it a flame, as far as I know the majority of our guild took it as one.  <br>
<br>
One last thing.  Regarding your calls for guildwar, what is it that you want?  You want us to admit you are far stronger than we are?  Check one of my earlier posts, I admitted it.  I'll say it again so you can rest easy.  IV is a LOT stronger than The Endless.  If we guildwarred you, it is likely that many of The Endless would die, perhaps repeatedly.  Would that somehow magically give your rants on this board merit?  Would that instantly transform the mess that some of you are posting into coherent rational thought?  <br>
