Funny.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry you weren't told the loot rules ahead of time, I really am.  Glacius, nisma, uneek and myself all knew them.  It was my assumption everyone knew it was /random.  I'm sorry if you think I owe you a bracer when we're level 60, because I don't.  I've already got a fungi tunic, and I didn't dump it off on some twink before going.  That leaves me in that fun and exciting camp for absolutely no reason.  I respect that you feel differently, but in a mixed group with 3 guilds represented and most of us not knowing each other, I personally would have assumed /random right from the start.<br>
<br>
What Rakot does with his bracer is up to him, its probably different that what I would have done, but I don't hold him at fault at all.  I went to get a *chance* at a CB for a guild tank, others went for fungi's or CB's to sell or use.  That's what the camp is for.<br>
<br>
Just my .02, I'm not here to bash anybody, I think it was an unfortunate misunderstanding that loot rules weren't 100% certain from the beginning.  <br>
<br>
This taught me that any group I'm in that isn't 100% guild I'll make sure everyone knows the deal right from the start so this doesn't happen again.<br>

Only thing I can say is, if there is a specific item you want, take 5 random fellow guild members and camp the thing yourself.  That way the 5 other &quot;suckers&quot; can, in some way, benefit from wasting their time there.<br>

You got the first everything when ever I have done king. Fungis have been on a NB4G scale of 1.) Monk 2.) Shaman 3.) Warrior then everyone else gets to roll. The monk already had one. We had no shammy. That leaves you. Would that have been fair? <br>
<br>
To everyone else who wasn't there. You don't know the whole story. Half of the stuff you are spewing are half-truths from so-and-so. I heard &quot;They all emote raped Pron and then evacced on him.&quot; Less crack. I don't understand why someone who wasn't even there felt this need to start a topic on this.

Its as much a responsibility of a person who joins the group as it is of a group leader to make sure loot rules are clear before the group kills anything. If you did not ask whether loots will be handled on NBG basis or /random basis, then the fault is entirely yours. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubignsexy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BigNSexy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 78<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/20/01 5:23:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=359.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guild groups....</span><hr size=1> deagol,gilder<br>

read my post again, i blame myself you pricks.<br>
ps deagol, this issue doesn't concern you in the least, so go find another shmuck to flame.(try using your in game name also, see if your views change)<br>
i have grouped with rakot before, never had problem about anything really. I'm stupid that i trusted these lamers in the first place. It's just after 60 levels this was the first time loot rules came into play for me (after the fact). I play fair, not with dollar signs. I know whats fair to me, isn't always fair for other people and vice versa.<br>
So yes ,I am the idiot, I should have not joined the group.<br>
Oh and Rakot, if yer still selling that bracer, shoot me a tell. i got some enchanter only gear to unload.<br>
Oh and Uneek, a funghi tunic i already own. I rolled higher then the monk AND shammy WOOT! <br>
feels good doesn't it?<br>
<br>
and for those that havent heard it right, no Rakot didnt gate out, he died and lost con, thats all.<br>
i did however think they would disband(which they did) and leave me there to run to zone all by my lil ole self (which they didnt) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Was it a good roll? What happened to need before greed? Did the monk and the shammy come to VCC trying to smear your name over it? I guess not. I guess the &quot;lamers&quot; (6 of them) who all knew that it was a /rand group and the one that claimed that he didn't know. How was it that there were 7 of us and you were the only one confused over loot? <br>
<br>
Pron, I didn't think bad of you for leaving after you demanded a roll on the loot and lost. Noone did. You left. I figured ok that is the end of it.

<br>
In general, anything gotten in all guild groups is NBG in that group, and most of the time NBG to the entire guild if no one in the group needs it.<br>
<br>
We've had a couple of loot whores in the guild at times, everyone does.  Most of them are gone/moved on/removed at this point.<br>
<br>
And actually, Rakot was forced to roll for a Crimson robe off of Draco recently.  He lost the roll, congratulated the winner, then went and bought one off of someone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Speculation and rumor mongering don't do anyone any good.  This was an issue of miscommunication and assumption, not &quot;we're gonna screw XX, lets invite him along&quot;.<br>

I have heard numerous things and it's actually funny now.  Ive heard people dont like me cause I PLed my chanter with my druid, I have heard one of their members doesn't like me because of something that happened at lvl 30.  Most recently I have heard that people don't like me cause I had a bad rep on my old server.  Yet when I asked nobody could give me names or anything.  No loss I am having fun playing.  Do I wish I could be doing N tov and the uber raids? Yea.  Do I think I should have been given a shot at IV when I asked? Yea considering I play more than almost all of you and love to raid.  But that was Krimzins decision and Im cool with it<br>
<br>
and Menexia, about giving guildmates things, instead of bitching at me for doing it because he wasn't there, why dont you try it.  You are right Gergoff wasnt there to &quot;earn&quot; it, I earned it for him by being down there and getting lucky on winning the roll.  So call me a greedy selfish bastard but I am down there for a reason and every single person down there had the same chances at winning.  I get lucky and win so I get to hear the rants, which is cool.  Menexia what would you do if you were down there and you won a cobalt bracer.  Would you sell it or give to your guildmate? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=359.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=359.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=359.topic&start=61&stop=73>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessage?topicID=368.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessage?topicID=362.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=359.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.threadControl?topicID=359.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=359.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=359.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm2">Vazaelle Server Board Rules<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm19">VCC Administrative Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm18">Title Requests<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm1">General Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm23">SoL Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm4">The Bazaar<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm12">Voting Booth<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm13">Retirement Hall<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm3">Event Announcements<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm8">The Gallery<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm5">Rants and Flames<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm6">Guild Links Submission<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm16">Guild Discussions<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm20">Guild Recruitment<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm22">Upcoming Games<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm17">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm7">Vazaelle Guild Leader Lounge<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm24">VCC Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5>Rants and Flames</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
