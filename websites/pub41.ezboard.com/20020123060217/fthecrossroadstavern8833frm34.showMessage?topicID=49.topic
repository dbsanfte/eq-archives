That was a very poor and greedy descision(sp?) to make. You had about a good majority of the raid pissed off at you guys.

If Kirle wanted to be polite and have the two Pallies that helped get them there roll ahead of time THEN when and if it droped have the rest roll and award it to the highest  roller then that may have solved alot of troubles and confusion. <p>Golath Heartyhacker<br>52 Pally<br>Tranquil Domain<br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6058B0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uhealsa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Healsa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#A098F2>(1/1/02 11:05:11 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vox Ninja Looted</span><hr size=1> <br>Bottom line is - Kirle is new at planning public raids - he acknowledges he made a mistake - and has apologized for it.<br><br>Stop being sarcastic - the paladins are also at fault for just jumping in and not getting explicit loot rules explained to them, I don't care what you consider to be &quot;standard rules&quot; - it was a public raid - you should find out the rules before joining in - you don't like the rules - don't join in.<br><br>So lay off of Kirle.

Before the first attempt it was explained in OOC that the loot would be randomed to classes that needed the items.  I was there for this and saw it as well as everyone else.  They said the scale was spoken for and that all paladins should now roll on the book.  Like 4 paladins rolled on it including a 59 paladin from my guild.  We continued with raid.  We made our first attempt and all died.  <br><br>We begin CR and over the next hour we are preparing to make a second attempt. While we are preparing for the second attempt a few more paladins showed up but no one cared to tell them that the pally book had already been rolled on before the first attempt.  After we kill vox the paladins are outraged and it now is in /shout and /ooc that the loot is now random for every class whether or not they can use the item or not.  When I asked what was going on I was told that the second attempt was a entirely different raid and thus under different rules.... /shrug Not sure how the second attempt can be completely different rules since 90 percent of the people doing the raid were the same ones from the first attempt about an hour earlier and we never left the zone and continued from our CR right back into the lair but hey....Maybe I am just confused here.<br><br>This is where the problem came in because the new 10 percent showed up were under the assumption that everything would be randomed while the first 90 percent of the people were still there from the first attempt.  Kirle is not at fault here regardless of his raid experience.  The new people that joined into the raid should have taken the time to ask about looting rights.  I was there the entire time from start to finish for like 8 hours and never left...I saw all the randoms for the pally boook and I saw the looting rules shouted in the zone for everyone that was there.  If there were new looting rules for the second attempt they sure as hell were not shouted or OOCed in the zone... That is all I know about this and I dont think anyone here is at a fault other than the people that did not ask about looting rights on a public raid they just jumped into.  <br><br>There is a simple solution to this everyone...use a standard set of raiding rules that everyone understands.  Need before greed is the best method.

UNLESS a) they have lent a significant amount of guildies or an alt that are/is 52 or lower AND b) they have worked it out with whoever is leading the public raid.<br><br>For example, on a bad Vox raid I lead (yes it went terrible) a long time ago, Azaule (now 60 bard) wanted to roll on the white dragon scale, so he played his 49 ( I think at the time) monk for the fight. In this case, I agreed that would be fine since he had an alt who was killing Vox with us. If he had shown up as Azaule alone it wouldn't have been okay, because what is a 53+ bard going to contribute to fighting Vox?  One note strung and he'd be banished.<br><br>Thats just my 2 cents on the issue. I don't like a level 53+ paladin showing up to a public Vox raid to help clear giants and then expecting to roll on the book just because he's a paladin.  A 50 warrior would have been a better help killing Giants and Vox.  The level 24 cleric buffs and heals the pally may be providing aren't worth didly to my raid.<br><br>As in all cases of public raids, when in doubt, ASK.

Apparently you can kill Gore (harder than killing vox, naggy or woushi for that matter) .. or you can pay .. or you can do what was done here, offer help on the raid for a chance to roll. <p><center><a href="http://www.orderofhasson.com">www.orderofhasson.com<BR><img src="http://www.orderofhasson.com/members/khambat_sig1.jpg"><BR></a>Khambat Mhedic       56  Cleric <BR>Rexronn Toebiter      52  Druid<BR>Sourr Notee          41  Bard,  <BR>Laflor Fizzlefinger  40  Mage  <BR>Twynkleeye Mesmereye  32  Enchanter<BR>Pumba                 24  Monk <BR>245 levels of my life .. wasted :p<BR></center></font></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1C1658><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bthecrossroadstavern8833.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=jarobe>Jarobe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 144<br> <font color=#A098F2>(1/2/02 12:34:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vox Ninja Looted</span><hr size=1> hmmm <br><br>I was in the wrong for calling Kirle a Ninja Looter, After re-reading his posts when I had more sleep I belive that he made an honest mistake by not telling me or staybuff, I had been put to bed, (my mother shut off comp in the middle of the game.)

UNLESS a) they have lent a significant amount of guildies or an alt that are/is 52 or lower AND b) they have worked it out with whoever is leading the public raid.&lt;&lt;<br><br>What Khambatt wrote:<br><br>&gt;&gt;Adon .. totally disagree here.<br><br>If i took Kham to a Public Vox raid to buff and help res afterwards, I would do it because there was a post 52 pally or bard in my guild that needed the scale or book. I'd offer my services for them to get a chance to roll on said item.&lt;&lt;<br><br>It looks like you agreed with me, or didn't understand what I was saying. If you brought a CLERIC (or shammy or enchanter or druid) and buffed the bejabbers out of the 52 and unders, you would be helping the raid out vs Vox and deserving of a roll on the epic peice.<br><br>I was saying that I don't understand a 55 pally or bard showing up for a raid without anyone else, and expecting to roll on said epic peice because he helped clear giants.  <br><br>I also said that if you showed up with significant help to kill Vox (ie a cleric like Khambatt) then you would deserve to roll on the peice in my eyes.  Really, a  non-buffing class over level 52 is not helping with the Vox fight at all.<br><br>So I now ammend what I wrote to say<br><br>UNLESS a) they have lent a significant amount of guildies (53+ buffers or under 52s) or an alt that are/is 52 or lower AND b) they have worked it out with whoever is leading the public raid.<br> <p></p><table cellSpacing="0" cellPadding="5" border="0" style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt; color: #FFFFFF; word-spacing: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" bgcolor="#000000"><tr><td width="111"><a href="http://spiritsoffyre.cjb.net"><img src="http://www.smogfarm.com/sof/sofburn.gif" border="0" width="110" height="96"></a></td><td vAlign="center" style="word-spacing: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><p style="word-spacing: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=38518"><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="3">Adon Borealis</font></i></b></a><p style="word-spacing: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"> <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3"> High Templar of Rodcet Nife</font></p><p style="word-spacing: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Bearer of the Prime Healer's Bulwark</font></p></td></tr></table> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1C1658><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bthecrossroadstavern8833.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=jarobe>Jarobe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 146<br> <font color=#A098F2>(1/2/02 1:54:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vox Ninja Looted</span><hr size=1> O just let this thread die! <p><div align="left"><img src="http://www.robyn.freewebspace.com/images/logo_41.jpg"></div></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6058B0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usindawe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sindawe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A098F2>(1/2/02 2:36:33 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vox Ninja Looted</span><hr size=1> i was on both attempts myself as Taglios. i stayed to the bitter end on both to help out with reses and such. my biggest gripe about the whole thing was after stickin around through both attempts and the many arguements about loot (mostly just to make sure there was a reser on hand in case of IG troubles) i was left without a ride out...after shoutin and oocin for almost 15 mins that i needed a ride out.. i gave up and walked. dont get me wrong i love goin on raids, but when ya figure in the peridots and pearls used for spells not to mention the sow potion i had to pop for the run out, i was left with a somewhat bad taste in my mouth. there was ppl portin out earlier but that was before everything was done and i feel that a cleric should be on hand till the very end just in case. once everything was settled i watch 3 groups of ppl port out while i was shoutin for a ride....ok clerical bitchin done <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1C1658><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucalavante.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Calavante</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#A098F2>(1/2/02 3:17:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vox Ninja Looted</span><hr size=1> Um.....EQs a game right?
