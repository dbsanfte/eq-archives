The ongoing war in Iraq is, perhaps, the most unusual armed conflict in history of modern warfare: disappearing armies and governments, illogical offensive and defensive operations on both sides of the front, information warfare on an unprecedented scale - this is not a war but a tale from Scheherazade´s Thousand and One Nights. All is missing is a magic genie lamp. Well, the lamp may be there but the genie is gone. The following is not an attempt to analyze the current events in Iraq, but rather a quick look at some general impressions most of us share about this war.<br>
<br>
Early stages of the war in Iraq boosted the positions of antiwar activists who predicted another Vietnam. The proponents of the war begun searching for the guilty party, pointing fingers toward Rumsfeld, Mayers and Franks. The latest US advances in Iraq reinforced the supporters of this war and the aggressive US foreign policy in general, while sending the antiwar activists into a downward spiral of pessimism and depression. Now the &quot;hawks&quot; are claiming victory without knowing or understanding anything that happened in Iraq. At the same time the antiwar masses focus on the humanitarian crisis in Iraq, accusing the US military of failing to protect the civilians.<br>
<br>
Independent of whether you support or oppose this war, you have to admit that the developments in Iraq during the past week took you by surprise. Granted, the US military capability is difficult to compare to that of Iraq - a country that was in a state of perpetual war for the past twenty-three years and under international embargo for well over a decade. Nevertheless, for about two weeks the Iraqi army was putting up stiff resistance - a fact acknowledged by the coalition military command. This was the first surprise. For nearly two weeks the superior coalition forces struggled to capture Umm Quasar - a tiny town with the population of 1,200 located on the border with Kuwait just a few miles from coalition positions.<br>
<br>
During these two weeks the Iraqi troops held on to the Fao peninsula and in the face of overwhelming odds were deflecting all attacks by the British forces supported by massive numbers of coalition aircraft. The Iraqi defenses held around Basra, An Nassiriyah, An Najaf and a number of other cities. During a single day of fighting near An Nassiriyah the coalition forces lost 33 troops - a fact officially confirmed by the coalition command. The coalition was clearly running out of steam required for the push toward Baghdad, its overstretched supply lines were under constant attacks and reinforcements were weeks away from entering combat. The northern front never materialized due to Turkey´s unexpectedly strong opposition.<br>
<br>
Saddam Hussein was killed at least five times during this conflict. Donald Rumsfeld´s definitive position on the subject was that &quot;Saddam is either dead or alive.&quot; The very first bomb dropped on Baghdad in this war killed Hussein. And then he was killed every other day until he appeared in the middle of Baghdad surrounded by bodyguards and cheering public - a gutsy move for a man being hunted by the world´s most sophisticated war machine. With this single move Saddam destroyed two weeks of coalition propaganda efforts. But this public appearance turned out to be a farewell gesture.<br>
<br>
Hussein always avoided making public appearances. He even avoided live TV broadcasts. His appearance in downtown Baghdad - and, yes, there is a consensus that it was actually him and not his double - under bombs, surrounded only by a small group of bodyguards was a remarkable event. Many anticipated more fierce Iraqi resistance as the result of this public appearance by Hussein. What happened was exactly the opposite.<br>
<br>
One after another Iraqi defensive positions have folded. Clearly they were not defeated and the coalition never actually claimed to have defeated them. Iraqi defenses simply disappeared leaving behind unexploded bridges, few minefields, and mostly undamaged oil wells. Most bridges and oil wells were wired with explosives but never detonated. A few oil wells were set ablaze but only to provide a smoke screen against the coalition aviation. Some bridges sustained minimal damage from the Iraqi artillery but this was the extent of it.<br>
<br>
The withdrawal of the Iraqi forces was very organized: Fao peninsula, Basra, An Najaf, An Nassiriyah and so on from south to north. The Iraqi army was gradually disappearing leaving little damaged or abandoned equipment behind. Out of thousands of armored vehicles we have seen just a handful old BMP-1s and T-54/55s. There have been photos of about 3-4 T-72s - none of them the easily identifiable upgraded type with the reactive armor used by the Republican Guard divisions.<br>
<br>
&quot;Embedded&quot; journalists and freelancers in Iraq produced no footage of any large-scale engagements in Iraq. We could see British artillery firing into the night, soldiers crashing into private residences, US Marines turning empty Toyota pickup trucks into Swiss cheese and on a few rare occasions a missile destroying a standalone tank or a building. Immediately before the war most intelligence services and analytical think tanks estimated Iraq´s army at between 350,000 and 402,000 regular troops in addition to about 150,000 irregular armed formations.<br>
<br>
The coalition claimed destroyed Iraqi divisions, captured hundreds of tanks and thousands of Iraqi troops. At the very beginning of the war the coalition command claimed that the entire Iraqi 51st Infantry Division has surrendered. Clearly staged videos showing only about a hundred Iraqi POWs - many not in uniform - accompanied this claim. Later the coalition admitted to being ´overly optimistic´ in claiming the surrender of the 51st division. Recently the coalition claimed that the entire Iraqi army corps has surrendered. But there were no photos and no videos to celebrate such a monumental event.<br>
<br>
In 2001 and 2002 Iraq conducted military parades in Baghdad using over a thousand armored combat vehicles, including BMP-type armored fighting vehicles and upgraded T-72s. This at least confirms that a large number of these vehicles were in serviceable condition. The total number of operational armored combat vehicles, including main battle tanks of several types, APCs, IFVs, reconnaissance vehicles was over 5,000. Operational. This means that we have to find all this armor somewhere in Iraq. Or maybe not in Iraq? In any case, we are yet to see any appreciable number of tanks and APCs destroyed or captured by the coalition.<br>
<br>
There were no reports of Iraq using one of its most potent weapons - the mobile multiple-launch rocket systems of which Iraq had about 200. According to Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, during just the first quarter of 2002 the Iraqi air defenses launched several hundred surface-to-air missiles at the coalition aircraft patrolling the ´no-fly´ zones. In this war, however, after two weeks of minimal activity the Iraqi air defenses have disappeared. The few examples of SAMs and AAAs found by the coalition forces in Baghdad, Basra and other cities are just a drop in a bucket of Iraq´s pre-war arsenal.<br>
<br>
Some news reports suggest that a massive surrender deal was worked out between the coalition and the Iraqi Republican Guard. So far, however, we have not seen any evidence of such a deal. An agreement on this scale requires mutual trust on the same scale. This is likely to remain an unfulfilled requirement. Many Iraqi army officers remain convinced that the 1991 ‘Road to Baghdad massacre’ was the result of the US violating a ceasefire agreement reached between Iraq and the US as the result of Soviet mediation. In 1991 the Soviet Union attempted to negotiate a peace deal between the US and Iraq and in doing so the Soviets poorly coordinated their actions with the US.<br>
<br>
The Soviet position was vague and some can argue that it was misleading as well. There is no question that Saddam Hussein had a clear picture of these negotiations, but many of his troops did not. It is a popular belief in Iraq that the US launched a cowardly attack on the withdrawing Iraqi army after a ceasefire agreement has been reached. This belief would make any large-scale agreements between the coalition and the Iraqi army very difficult. In any case, the recent reports by Al Jazeera and the Jordanian media regarding a possible deal between the US and the commander of the Iraqi Republican Guard Gen. Maher Sufyan are complete nonsense.<br>
<br>
Rumors of Hussein’s death persist in the Arabic media. Al Jazeera reported that Saddam Hussein, his two sons - Uday and Qusay - and most of Hussein’s government were killed during the US bombing of a restaurant in Baghdad on April 7. If anything, this is a clear confirmation that Saddam Hussein is alive. Just a reminder: on April 7 the US dropped a guided bomb onto a residential building in Baghdad. The US military and government officials claimed that there was a bunker under the building and that Saddam Hussein was believed to be in there. A day later British intelligence sources told the press that Saddam is likely to be alive. About the same time it was uncovered that the destroyed building had no bunker (this was immediately obvious from the photos of the building’s remains). The “bunker” turned out to a small restaurant on the basement floor. Saddam has enough secret underground facilities in Iraq to avoid making a choice between secrecy of the location and its protection against US penetrating bombs. Most of these underground facilities were made to withstand a hit of tactical nuclear weapon. For example, during the 1999 aggression against Yugoslavia the US was not able to penetrate a single underground hangar used by the Yugoslav Air Force. A variety of weapons were used against these facilities, including penetration weapons and super-heavy volume-detonation bombs.<br>
<br>
The likelihood of Saddam, his sons and his entire government meeting at a public place in downtown Baghdad under US bombs for bite of baklava with some tea is not very high. Saddam is many things but careless is not one of them.<br>

<br>
I'd personally find it highly unlikely to succeed to be honest since for this to work you'd have to have at least a couple brigades in on it, or at least most of the commanders, and then have a reliable way to get all the troops coordinated.  That mammoth task alone makes it highly unlikely.  The chances that nobody would talk are about slim-none.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure who the author is but I rather doubt he has up to date intelligence on the number and amount of enemy formations/units/equipment destroyed, but is rather gauging his opinions based on the small parts of Iraq he has seen. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=204898">Ayiar Frullaniaceae</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
 Did you happen to see the interview of the Iraqi Soldiers last night. I can't recall the channel (doesn't matter for you. You think the ones I watch are bias)<br>
<br>
The Soldier reported that the Fedyeens came to his and his neighbors homes. Killed one of his children, one of his sisters, and tortured him into joining the Republican guard. Only after he submitted to join the forces did the torture stop.<br>
<br>
He further went on to tell that he was in a brigade in N. Iraqi. They were not fed, only survived on Tea and Water. Upon hearing that Basra and Najaf had fallen into coalition forces, he and his fellow Iraqi soldiers dropped their arms. They replaced their uniforms (those having other clothes to wear) and began walking home to S. Iraqi. When asked why? They stated we didn't want to fight. Now that our commanders have left us we decided to go home.<br>
<br>
I know you will most likely say that the TV reporter hand-picked these men for it's biased PR effect. I certainly hope no ever comes to my door and starts murdering my family to persuade me to enlist. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=herdervazaelle>HerderVazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 2104<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/16/03 2:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=38.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Dmchas</span><hr size=1> Nope, didn't see the interview.  <br>

<br>
You might actually be trying to find something that never exsisted. I haven't seen any reports of missing military equipment. If I have It must have been very little mentioned.<br>
<br>
I would have placed the best I have on the front lines. Knowing if they were ever penetrated the war would be over. Saddam has already been called the stupidest General in military history. Why would he place his worsed equipment on the frontlines? And I'm calling the frontlines everything from Baghdad south. Knowing they would be sacrificed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=anywon>Anywon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I can't decide on a title</span><br>  Posts: 701<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/16/03 2:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=38.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re....</span><hr size=1> Well, tactically speaking, it would make sense to allow the invading army position itself with an over-extended and exposed logistics.  The supply line could be harassed by irregular forces while the bulk of the army could dig in for a lengthy seige of the capitol.<br>
<br>
This is exactly what happened.  There was no secret that Baghdad was intended to be a long seige.<br>
<br>
The Iraqi's managed to hold other cities much longer than anticipated by use of the irregular forces.  This may have been a surprise to both sides.<br>
<br>
The Battle for Baghdad only included a few division of equipment on each side.  Herder raises an interesting point -- where is the rest of this equipment?  Was there a mass exodus to Syria?  Since the US command was still trying to seal the border between Iraq and Syria, that might be a possibility.  Given the hostilities between Iraq and Iran it doesn't make much sense for the remnants to flee to Iran.<br>
<br>
Instead of trashing somone for raising an intersting possibility, why not look a bit deeper to find out if it is even plausible?  Think outside the box, people. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=herdervazaelle>HerderVazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 2107<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/16/03 3:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=38.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I'm just saying</span><hr size=1> Look, I'm just saying that the whole thing stinks.

I know where the Iraqi army was placed...../smacks self in forehead<br>
<br>
The military hardware was dropped from the Alien Mothership that controls Dubya. It was placed on the back 40 on bush's crawford texas ranch. <br>
<br>
God, am I embarrassed....I'm a texan and I immediately didn't understand where aliens controlling the president would have placed a couple divisions of armor for future use ....my bad. <br>

All along I had this sinking feeling in the back of my head. Saddam would allow the US forces to reach Baghdad and detonate an atomic device. My goodness was I tickled it hasn't happened so far. <br>
<br>
If I understand the Pentagon right. there is one more city in far W. Iraq........something like Na Qiam? Possiby this city could have been a portal for all equipment/Sr. leaders to reach Syria. <br>
<br>
Now that Herder mentions this I do recall as Journaliest made their way to Tikrit. Many of their home agencies kept asking them if the equipment they were seeing was in great shape. CNN kept asking it's reporter (Brent Sadler) to try and find some T-72's. All he could find was the 55's and APC's.<br>
<br>
But again, I'm still under the belief that we destroyed them as they made their way to Baghdad. I can't recall if I have made mention of my beliefs on Saddam. I'm a firm believer that the man lives. Knowing how he faired in 91, I believe the man skipped out of the counrty and let his Commanders do as they pleased. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showMessageRange?topicID=38.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showMessageRange?topicID=38.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showMessageRange?topicID=38.topic&start=61&stop=70>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showPrevMessage?topicID=38.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showNextMessage?topicID=38.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=38.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.threadControl?topicID=38.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=38.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=38.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm19">VCC Administration<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm18">Title Requests<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm24">VCC Archives<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm1">General Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm4">The Bazaar<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm28">Technical Support<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm27">Artistic Endeavors<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm25">Tradeskills<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm12">Voting Booth<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm13">Retirement Hall<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm3">Event Announcements<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm8">The Gallery<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm30">The Real World<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm5">Rants and Flames<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm6">Guild Lists and Links<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm16">Guild Discussions</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle.com Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30>The Real World</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.vazaelle.com">Vazaelle.com</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246j<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
