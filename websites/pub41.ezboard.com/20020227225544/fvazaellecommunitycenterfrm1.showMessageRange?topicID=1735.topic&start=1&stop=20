The char he played on Tunare he also bought, he was the 5th owner or so... he has a rep for ebaying, the name was Gingdied and everybody called him Gingbay, that's how bad the rep was.<br><br>Anyhow, he logged into a guildie's account.. pretending to be them (was well trusted) and asked someone for their account info in the guild, so they could log in later and give enc buffs for ST if the original wasn't online. Those people trusting the  the person he posed as (he was pretending to be them) gave him their info. Slambam (aka Gingdied from Tunare) then changed the passwords to the 2 accounts, 1 had an epic 60 monk, epic 60 enc.. and 1 an epic 60 wiz.. He proceeded to strip/transfer/sell/ebay (or try to) all the loot.<br><br>The GMs were contacted, and these people will be getting their accounts fully restored, the poor shmuck who Ging traded HIS account to (assuming he did) will be banned. This fellow is banned from Tunare because of what he did.<br><br>So just to let you guys know, there is a new scamming POS on Vaz and he just bought an Ogre named Slambam.<br><br>We found out because his Ezboard name (Gingdied Swiftblades) use to post on our guild board. We checked his recent posts and noticed him applying to a guild on Vaz (Promethian Order?) as a 60 war, even admitting he's not the original owner.<br><br>So this is just a heads up, he royally screwed 3 people over out of greed like a dirtbag, and now he messed up. So he bought a char on this server and disappeared from Tunare.<br><br>Peace,<br>Consequences<br>&lt;Pia Fidelis&gt;<br>Tunare <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uxxragincajunxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xX Ragin Cajun Xx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 298<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/28/02 1:58:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1735.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *HUGE WARNING to Vazaelle*</span><hr size=1> *ouch* Thats gotta hurt the guy who just dropped the $$ for it, oh well I bet that toon see's the auctioning block again soon, since ppl will be advised of such quickly in game.<br><br>This has flamable written all over it, eh? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uxxragincajunxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xX Ragin Cajun Xx</A> at: 1/28/02 2:04:34 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukyrana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kyrana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 258<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/28/02 2:15:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1735.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *HUGE WARNING to Vazaelle*</span><hr size=1> Hrm, this wouldn't be Slambam the Orge Warrior originally from Veeshan would it?

For starters, you never give it to a casual game friend, it's usually to a guildie.  Depending on what type of character you play and what's going on, it can be a one-time to &quot;my trusted best friend in the guild&quot; thing, or an on-going &quot;use me for a portwhore and get me to the raid since I don't get home til 2 hrs after the raid starts&quot; type thing.<br><br>Personally, not too many people in IV had my password, and most of them I know in real life.  Four of us all live in the same city and had a round robin thing going - someone would use me for hunting rares, Vehnn would use me for twinking his rogue, Vehnn would swap with a mage friend for raids just to have something a little different to do, etc.  However, back in the day, I'd say about 25% of my guild had access to my cleric.  Which was a good thing - I logged sick one night during a Hate raid and a friend played me on her second comp.  I would have cried if the first EM BP we'd seen in the 2 months I'd been up for it had gone to someone else.  Of course, that was a different time in the game, a different set of people, and a different guild. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ualyenstormrunner.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alyen Stormrunner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 144<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/28/02 2:56:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1735.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *HUGE WARNING to Vazaelle*</span><hr size=1> LOL... this post lead me to discover this!<br><br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=1325503267">cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayI...1325503267</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>~15 minutes left on the bidding, this must be an eq first <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ualyenstormrunner.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alyen Stormrunner</A> at: 1/28/02 2:56:46 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ueqjetx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQ JetX</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://eqscreenshot.homestead.com/files/icon57.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 805<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/28/02 2:59:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1735.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.kenshinvu.com/buddyicon/ff/n10.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *HUGE WARNING to Vazaelle*</span><hr size=1> Its all about trust Jaghatai, there are many cases where someone gives info to someone else and nothing happens, but people dont post that on the boards so it wouldnt matter.
