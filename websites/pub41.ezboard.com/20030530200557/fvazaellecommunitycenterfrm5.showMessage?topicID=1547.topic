<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://boards.gamers.com/messages/message_view-topic.asp?name=VazAlliance&id=zzoxx">boards.gamers.com/message...e&id=zzoxx</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Okay, one of the items you need for this &quot;quest&quot; is a planar rift from Emperor Ssraeshza. Notice, the HARDEST mob in the enitre game. Nothing even comes close, one little tiny mistake and shit hits the fan, there's a lot of shit in the emperors room and many fans. This fight is extremelly unforgiving.<br>
Let me tell you, not even now when you are closing on 600 people in the alliance (yes, I counted), you don't stand a piss against the Emperor, not even with damage shields.<br>
For others, here's a link to the Alliance hompage: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.flashgordonrules.com/Alliance.htm">www.flashgordonrules.com/Alliance.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Let me show you why:<br>
First, to stand a reasonable chance against Emperor you should preferrably have killed Arch Lich Rhag'Zadun and High Priest of Ssraeshza multiple times.<br>
Second, if you ain't level 60 forget about it, most of you are low 50ies, no disrespect cause I was there too but get 60 first please. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
Third, if you can't show 7k hp warriors and 6k hp hybrids forget about it. Yes, these guys hit HARD AS HELL.<br>
Fourth, you need a key to enter the emperors room, if you were to farm ssraeshza day and night and kill everything as it popped it would take you over half a year to get 600 emperor keys, probably even close to 9 months.<br>
Fifth, the planar rifts are now NO DROP, you can't buy them from high level guilds anymore. After the next patch it should be impossible to even get rifts from other servers (legends et al). No non-no drop rift has dropped on Vazaelle, sorry CC/PO slacked too much.<br>
<br>
Getting lucid shards are by no means hard. It's only time consuming, I wish to save you the effort and bankspace needed for this quest. It is not worth spending your time on it yet! And you are also griefing others who DO have a chance on emperor.<br>
<br>
So when should you start looking for Lucid Shards?<br>
I'd say, when you've killed Xerkizh the Creator you should sporadically kill mobs to get shards. He's not very easy and killing him shows you have he capacity for more.<br>
Once you kill Arch Lich / High Priest you should start to activelly camp shards.<br>
<br>
So, whenever you, level 46 druid in the up and coming alliance of vazaelle (who sent me a tell that if any lucid shards dropped they were yours cause you were camping them) think about farming lucid shards please, just don't do it, it's neither worth your time nor your bank space. Honest. <br>
And yes, there are many incidents where very low level characters camp shards and grief others on them. Make some platinum instead by auctioning the loot rights if you get one, most people will pay at least 100pp for it. Thinking specifically of the dsp shard here. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
On another note, PO I suffer along with you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
And to the Alliance, I wish you the best of luck, basically everything between the Kael Arena and low end Ssraeshza is up for the taking. Wish to see you going to ToV soon. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><center>

<br>
A)  Do not come to my board to rant, call us ridiculous, or spit out insults.  You will be banned from the board.  Of course this is an invitation for any idiot that likes to go because someone asks you not to to rant there.  It is a public board, but it has its own rules which I enforce.<br>
<br>
B)  We know, folks.  VT is an EXTREMELY long range goal.  We collect, those that wish, the shards for the future.  The Alliance is made up of 8 guilds and many raid leaders.  Each with their own hopes for the future whether realistic, future based, or plain impossible.  There on that board is where they plan those, get advice, are told forget it, or are prompted on.  <br>
<br>
C)  The best way to learn is to wipe, for those that do not see/cannot see the basic difficulty of a situation.  It is how I personally have learned most of the more difficult things I have tried.  There was a time when no one had done anything on this or any server.  No one had guides or hard numbers.  They just learned by the spirit of adventure.  Some of you may argue that why bother killing yourself when there is a safety label out there?  Well, for some, they will never learn without learning themselves.  And for other, me included here, you may just come up with a better way.  Live and learn, die and learn more.<br>
<br>
D)  For myself, personally, I have a linear approach I am taking, working mobs in a particular order of difficulty, to learn technique, pulls, pushing, dumping, tank rotation, cleric rotation, things you all do, some things you don't try because it's not your gig.  And please remember, this is also not your gig.  To rant because we screwed up your hit is one thing, to rant because some of us want to try something is the equivilent of schoolyard bullshit.  We appreciate any advice, but no one appreciates mockery.  Rants and flames is great for taking care of someone wh pissed you off, but its the let's make fun of someone who didn't do a thing to you aspect that makes this forum one of the more distasteful I've read.<br>
<br>
If you want to rant about the Alliance, please contain it to here.  It is not welcome on my boards, so since the Alliance threads have been linked here, remember when you are in my house, you will abide by my rules.  I already have had one incident with a member of a higher teir guild that ended up embarrassingly for all involved, and really don't want to spend another day dealing with political horseshit.<br>
<br>

Getting the shards/luclinite/frame is about 5% of the quest.  The other 95% is actually killing emperor ssra cause hes fuggin tough!!!!  Not to mention everyone needs a key to even get to his room which is a whole quest in itself.<br>
With all that said, Commodos knew jackshit about VT.<br>
<br>
&quot;About the level, the reason for the cap on the level is due to the zone in general. The zone that the key will open up is said to be on the TOP 3 most dangerous zones in the game. Hmmm. Cazic Thule being on there too. The loot rocks though.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is just pathetic.  There are tons of reliable sources about VT on the internet, Commodos just got all his info from looking at afterlife's loot pics.   Ugh I can't even describe how stupid this is.  Oh yeah, Commodos quit eq too, what great dedication. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uzluronharbinger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ZluronHarbinger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 245<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/24/02 10:25:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1547.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Camping Lucid Shards</span><hr size=1> kiwi fruit r good <p>-ziluron</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usonicbeat00the00bard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sonicbeat00the00Bard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 135<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/24/02 10:40:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1547.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Camping Lucid Shards</span><hr size=1> Gotta hate playing the game with other people... <p> <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=209283 >Sonicbeat the Virtuoso</a>

The first thing to come to mind is "Hello, Captain Obvious".<br>
<br>
Don't worry.  We know how far away from defeating the Emp.  The Shard locations are being considered by some of us as "Where do we Exp today?" locations.  Some of them are actually decent mobs for exp.<br>
<br>
There is a natural progression to this game which, if you payed attention, you would see that we are following.  We are fully aware of our strengths and weaknesses, and get better with every raid.<br>
<br>
So please, keep your preaching on what we should or should not do to yourself.  We don't remember asking for anyone's permission to do what we want, nor are we likely to accept anyone telling us that we cannot do something.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uzinj.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zinj</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 177<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/24/02 12:46:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1547.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Camping Lucid Shards</span><hr size=1> Seriously.<br>
<br>
When should you begin camping the shards?<br>
<br>
When you are able to kill the mobs that drop them.<br>
<br>
If you can get XP off the droppers, then by all means beat them down.  If a drop happens and you're johnny-on-the-spot, loot the thing and bank it for later. <br>
<br>
Yes, I'd make way for a level 60 who needed one since he/she/it can probably make use of it immediately while I still have months to go.<br>
<br>
But I take a long term view; always have.  Probably why I play a monk since the class begins work on their epic at level 1 with the white sashes and headbands.<br>
<br>
And one little hint:  The word &quot;can't&quot; doesn't exist in the game.  The difficult we do immediately, the impossible may take a little longer.<br>

Go ahead and get it done if that what you like to. Dont let people get you just because you swap xp place from the usual boring xp players.<br>

A level 46 druid claiming loot rights to another person's kill is quite hilarious, regardless of if he was capable of camping one of the spawns that drop the shard.  Part of the reason so many CC/PO people are in an uproar about lower levels camping shards a year before they could possibly need them is due to their rarity.  Luclin = the expansion of timesinks, and by the time any one person has progressed to the point that they are camping shards they have most likely:  farmed ssra bane weapons, farmed emp key components, killed ever named but Emperor in ssra 6+ times (several are 20 minute fights or longer), and made several attempts on the Emperor.  They are all pulling their hair out in frustration over the lame camps for getting the VT key.  This would be a very different situation if VI had the forethought to realise only large guilds of level 60's could kill emperor, and thus make each key component encounter geared to their capabilities.<br>
<br>
Now, take that frustration over lame time sinks, anger that it takes so long just to get to ssra and to the top for an Emp attempt, and add in some level 46 telling you they want their shard from your kills and you get just this, people jumping your shit and pissing on your parade.  The Alliance has many good friends of mine, and I see them doing good things IF they can form one set of goals and work cooperatively to achieve them, but as a friend and as one trying to drag my lazy ass through all the timesinks, please would you be so kind as to allow us our chances at the drops?  Vazaelle is FFA, always has and always will be but if a level 60 that could use the shard comes along, consider either sharing the camp or selling the shard to them.  Most shards you are camping at this point will drop MANY times before you get past your experience goals from those camps. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uriverdane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 96<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/24/02 1:57:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1547.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_portrait.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Camping Lucid Shards</span><hr size=1> No i see the point, Fadori, that's why I'm not jumping all over the original poster of this.  What I am doing is preventing, I hope, the instances of when this has happened before, which resulted in a member of a higher teir guild coming onto a non rants and flames board and spewing curses and insults at us.  I wouldn't even be addressing this post if it didn't link the Alliance's message board, and normally, a link would be fine.  But just two days ago I had to deal with rabid animal coming to our boards to flame, and wanted it this time nipped in the bud, now that the gateway has been opened from this particular forum.<br>
