You got 4 -frogs- added while camping the king?<br>
<br>
Were you so amazingly on top of the king and shroom roamers that you decided to go pull the teleport out room for kicks and got 2 roamer adds? If so, blame your monk for not sending the static frogs back home (and pulling that room in the first place)<br>
<br>
If you were on your way to the king spot and not there yet, I still don't see any spot you can get more than 3 frogs if you were just randomly throwing shurikens around unless you, as a team, went and stood someplace that wasn't a good spot. If so, blame everyone for not speaking up and saying something.<br>
<br>
Be thankful you wiped early to frogs while camping a spot that has no frogs, at all, ever. It probably saved you a lot of headache later on. I'm just curious where you physically were when your team expired.<br>
<br>
Btw, if your team is decent your tank doesn't have to be a 55+ warrior to hold the spawn and keep killing. Done with a 54 sk, done as a monk many times. I think the most detrimental level problem you could have would involve a chanter not being able to control chealing adds while removing the king (not that a monk can't infinite kite an add in the pathing of that maze).<br>
<br>
Not being one to post without a suggestion for future success: print off a map and note the teleport spot about 6-8seconds away from the king spawn point passing mobs only in the last couple seconds. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/upalantinuseq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PalantinusEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/19/01 10:29:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=572.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: bah</span><hr size=1> Ceros &gt;<br>

Aye, Im gonna start using all 4 heal spells. Rather than removing one of the great three (DA/DB/Gate), ill occupy one of my 2 utility spots instead. Hmm.. didnt someone write a wish-list of SoL items featuring a ring with an extra spell-gem? I want one.<br>

We died in the tunnels right after you come up from the water after the 2nd underwater bit (if im making any sense here) before even reaching the king room, and the number of frogs was for a while 4 totally (not 4 adds). In the end some shrooms joined the party too.<br>

The puller overpulls, or roamers show up, or respawns pop on top of your party. Then on top of that mezzes get resisted, the Chanter  takes multiple hits very quickly, maybe the clerics heal spell on the chanter fizzles, costing valuable seconds,  and good night all - TPW. Recovering from a TPW is time consumming and boring but its part of the game. You just have to say &quot;Well, Bu Bu Bu Buuba now that's OK,&quot; and drive on.   Take a chill pill, or quit EQ for a week or two (I have personally found this works wonders) if you find you are taking this &quot;game&quot; too serious. &quot;A Group&quot; went down into Sebillis and got wiped.  Palantinus post was about one TPW and he - as an individual - was singled out and forced out of his group. Most of the blame for the groups failure was stuck on him,  and this is wrong. I do appreciate  those who have given advice on where things went wrong in this situation, and how to improve. As for those who say Palantinus has poor &quot;Skillz&quot; or is not &quot;elite&quot; enough, maybe its time for &quot;Youz&quot; to take a week or two off from EQ. <br>
<br>
Maybe the Cleric that replaced Palantinus was a friend of the other group members and they just wanted to get their bud in on the action, lots of phat lewt down there hehe.  Nah that couldn't happen could it?<br>

I am consistantly amazed at the lack of skills people who streaked past me in levels while I was playing alts most of the time over the last 6 months yet when I go to OS or Chardok or even to the kobold camps in Velks they fall apart at the seams LOL.

Huh?  And btw its &quot;Alydyn&quot;.<br>
<br>
Palantinus, I have no idea how good of a cleric you are or arent.  I really dont care.  I called you a gimp cause you are lvl 56 and you stated that from now on you would be memming gate for groups.  That, to me, is a gimp action.  If my cleric has gate memmed, what does that tell me?  It tells me that if things start to look bad I can kiss my ass goodbye cause he is going to gate.  Sorry but thats how I took it.<br>

I hate to say it, Pal, but some of the owness here is YOURS. No two ways about it. When I'm playing one of my healers (druid or cleric), I don't let them pull if they're not full health. Maybe it changes in the &quot;high end&quot; game, but at level 49, the best healers don't let them pull until they're healed.<br>
<br>
Look at it this way: You pull 4 mobs. If the warrior's at 1 bub of health when they're pulled, then you're gonna have to CH him before all the adds are mezzed. You know what happens after that.<br>
<br>
Cleric: It's what's for dinner.<br>
<br>
<br>
Personally, I agree with what's been said here, Palantinus. As a wizard, I take it as an insult when somebody has gate memmed: It means they don't trust me to do my job. I can count on 1 hand the number of times people have died in a group with me since level 40, and most of those times, it's been me that died. Somehow, I have difficulty managing aggro with two rogues...<br>
<br>
<br>
Seems you're beating yourself up here, Pal. I think you realized exactly what others have said. But I think, also, that part of the owness was in the cockiness of the group. I'm going to bow to the experience of those who've done it, and accept that the king is 55+, and in that light, your group was probably a bit (or a lot) arrogant in thinking they can take it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You need to blow off some steam, Palantinus. I'm still giggling about what I did before logging last night.... Mebbe you should try something similar?<br>

For disagreeing with you, Palantinus, I'm ignorant? For stating my opinion, I'm ignorant? For ADMITTING that I have to rely on what other people have said I'm ignorant?<br>
<br>
<br>
You, child, have much to learn before you will know the power of the Jedi. There is much anger in you; and you must realize that at the moment you think you know the most, you know the least.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Look at the odds here, Palantinus. EVERYBODY that has posted here has disagreed with you, Pal. The closest to agreement that I've seen is my statement that you aren't the only one at fault for this. And yet, here you are, flaming me directly, and calling ME the ignorant one? You are the one who refuses to accept any owness for what happened. Oh no, it couldn't be your fault. Not possible, because the high and mighty cleric is infallible. No. You're perfect, and it was the other 5 people who also got screwed that must have been at fault. And yes, they're people. You seem to have forgotten that while you only see their avatar, there are people behind the characters. It may only be a game, but we're all people. Living, breathing, and feeling beings with emotions. And y'know what? Sometimes, just sometimes, we humans make mistakes. We can't all be as perfect as the high elf clerics.<br>
<br>
You are nothing like the Palantinus I used to know and consider a friend.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S. Just so you know, I would have let this thread go. I would not have replied, and I would have left it be, had you not been so utterly on the defensive here. Your arguments have left the intellectual level, Palantinus. You debase yourself, and your reputation by continuing this brand of reply. You are lashing out because of hurt feelings, most likely anger with yourself because deep down you know that you are in the wrong with this rant. People who truly believe they are right are content to state their opinion, and let the shit fly where it will. <p>--<br>

If the warrior comes back with 1 bubble of health, and 4 mobs beating on him, there's no way CH is gonna get off in time.  But, of course, you know this already. Right Aurianne?  <br>
It amazes me how in all of the posts I've read, you try to sound like you know what you're talking about.  Please, give me all of your alts names so I never make the mistake of grouping with you.  At least when people start talking about how much they know about EQ, when they clearly have no clue what they're talking about, I can just turn off ooc/shout.  Not as easy to do if the person is in your group.<br>

Any of those classes worth a damn ever, never have it memmed.  Except Vehnn, because the only group he could get was kc moat, but that's a different story.<br>

<br>
But, to adress what you wrote:<br>
<br>
First, you dont tell a guy like Mistre, since this seems to be the example at hand, what to do. He has at least 8 warlords on the Nameless, all members of FoH and high ranked in the BoTB. He knows best. If he wants to run away from healing before a pull, those ogre legs can do it.<br>
<br>
Second.. this stuff:<br>
<br>
--<br>
Look at it this way: You pull 4 mobs. If the warrior's at 1 bub of health when they're pulled, then you're gonna have to CH him before all the adds are mezzed. You know what happens after that.<br>
<br>
Cleric: It's what's for dinner.<br>
--<br>
<br>
Is so thick with error, that its multi-layered and would take the insulted intelligence of Vehn years to bone out.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, yeah, Ive taken a bit of flak for this.. but most of it doesnt come from the rant itself really, but rather because I have had gate memmed. Some dont like this because it takes up a spell slot, some because they fear the betrayal of a gating cleric.<br>
<br>
Personally, ive seen the use of the memmed gate spell in, for example a situation when an overwhelming train comes in and no evacer is around and its basically every man for himself.. staying and dying with those who cant escape helps no-one really. But, since those more experienced than me tells me its wrong, im gonna look around a bit and setup a new 8'o'spells.<br>
<br>
Nuff said for me on this.. it got way out of its original subject, and im propably only hurting myself more with every post. Lots of folks have prolly labeled me a gimp cleric by now, but looking back on the levels, I think Ive done fairly well. Of course theres been deaths and TPWs, but fairly few and far between. And no, Ive not spent a lot of time in Velks. Some, sure, but Id wager far less than many others. After about 0.5-1 yellow of exp in there I get violently bored and have to do something else.<br>

Okay. So throw Divine Light. For all I care, throw Minor Healing, because it doesn't make a difference to the point. Forgive me for not researching the cleric class when my cleric hasn't been played for about 3 months. As I said, people make mistakes.<br>
<br>
But when you heal too early, you have the same effect. Regardless of which healing spell you're using, you'll taunt off the mobs. Cleric: It's what's for dinner. I trust I've been blunt enough to get through the fog in your mind this time?<br>
<br>
Or have you never been in a party that gets more than 1 mob at a time? If so, I pity you. The game is much more interesting when you've got 3 or 4 going at the same time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Save yourself the trouble, Lyllandra. If you're so obtuse that you can't see the point through a minor nitpick, then you aren't the sort of person I try to group with. I don't want you in my group any more than you want me in yours.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now where's Vehn when you need him. At least his rants show some modicum of intelligence.
