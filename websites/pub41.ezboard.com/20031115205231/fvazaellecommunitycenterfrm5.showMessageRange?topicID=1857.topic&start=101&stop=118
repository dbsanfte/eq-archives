<br>
So what am I supposed to judge them by in an online enviroment? How and what a person says are the ONLY things I have to judge people by.<br>
<br>
I do have some friends that have potty mouths, but I don't hang out with them nearly as much as I do with friends that know my feelings about such words.  My friends respect my feelings on those words and don't use them around me, nor little children, etc.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Words are just ciphers we string together and assign meaning to.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And in my mind I've come to the conlcusion that vulgar words should just not be used so freely in an online game that will attract children (minors if you wish to use a more correct term) that do not need to be subjected to the kind of enviroment that you find in uber guilds.<br>
<br>
I don't like the meanings of the words and the way they're used... the f-word for example. Whether it's used as a vulgar term for sex, an insult (f- you), or whatever.  The word itself comes across to me as vulgar and instantly degrades my opinion of the person using it.<br>
<br>
Take Brack for example and his big red letters and font.  It's kind of hard not to see that, and you know what, he used those words in an attempt to hurt me emotionally, to attack me personally.<br>
<br>
A failed attempt, as the only thing he hurt is my already low opinion of him.  Brack is a prime example of why people like him should not be allowed to subject others to their mindless drivel.  They use those words so freely, they don't understand the kind of effect it has on kids and people who don't like those words.<br>
<br>
Or they use those words to try and hurt people, because they think those words will magically get their point across more coherently and pointedly.  Guess what, they don't.  They only prove to me the simple mindedness of the person using them.  I do pity them, since they can't climb out of the pit of filth they dug for themselves.<br>
<br>
It's not my job to pull them out, but I would rather not have more people fall into those pits.  Anyway, I found a new MMOG to play that will blow EQ away.  Unfortunately I will have to put up with some vulgar content, but I can take matters into my own hands and punish the offenders.<br>
<br>
I have yet to see anything in it though about chat filters.  I'll have to ask about it.  The game is called Eve if anyone is interested learning about it.<br>

I curse quite often, and I'll place my life's savings against yours that I'll destroy you in a contest of intelligence.  A person using vulgarity and expletives is only simple in your own twisted sense of reality.  Quit trying to make it sound as if people who curse are simple-minded.  <br>
<br>
I've never seen a person so bothered by mere words before, it's pathetic.  Why don't you spend a week in a hostile environment overseas and see where chastising people for cursing stands on your list of priorities.

<br>
Now we're getting somewhere.  If its just the meaning behind the word and the context in which it's placed why would you have a problem with.. &quot;That fight was fuckin bad ass heh&quot;  Is it because the word &quot;fuck&quot; is also used in a common deragotory phrase?  Are you so steadfast in your crusade againist cussing that you can't deduce when a word is used in a deragotory fashion and when one is used in an extremely harmless way?<br>
<br>
When you sat there and insulted me in your previous post you were essentially saying &quot;fuck you&quot; to me.. you just used other words to convey that same message.  Which is okay because you wanted to be clear in your points, but the message is the same you see?  An insult is an insult is an insult, regardless of what words you use.  So it's not ok to cuss, but its okay to insult someone according to your standards?  I mean, being self proclaimed morally superior doesn't hold a stick to stringing four letters together, wtf was I thinking?

So when Brack made that insult in big red letters, he was reacting to that, not just to get a rise out of you. You insulted him and he insulted you back.<br>
<br>
Thinking in terms like that of people (lesser person) is really narrowminded and shows that you aren't able to judge individuals but rely on generalisations. You feel you used to use cuss words to try to fit in and feel that everybody must use them for that reason. You felt EQ is a waste of time to you, so it is a waste of time to everyone. You heard that all uberguilds are pottymouths and you claim to know the atmosphere of the guild. <br>
<br>
To be honest, although I doubt there are many guilds absolutely free from profinanity, I also doubt guildchat is dominated with it in guilds like CC and AD (but I confess, I do not know). I do not care much for the way Venthos and many other DV people are using profinity - it becomes irritating to me the way they use it. On the other hand, they make it pretty clear they are like that, they seem to enjoy themselves, so more power to them. I just know that DV is probably not a guild for me.<br>
<br>
And about Everquest. I know what you mean about the mindless grinding, then again, Everquest is not like that if you don't want it to be. I have a 39 chanter on Venril Sathir, I leveled him exclusively in dungeons. Everquest is fun that way (I leveled Merrahar mostly in LOIO/OT and stuff - that was boring, still I don't think it is wasted). Granted, you have to know people to group with, but it isn't Everquest's design that is to fault here. People seem to want to group in easy places like LOIO/OT/DL/Velks where groups are easy to find and xp is constant. And if they don't know enough people to go to other places, who can blame them ?<br>
<br>
Raids are fun to me, even without getting stuff (hell, once I got into complete sky-gear, I only got 1 other piece of equip from raids in Fantasy - that is about 6 months of raiding 2 - 4 times / week). So yeah, I can imagine that you consider EQ a waste of time, but don't assume that must be true for everybody.<br>
<br>
This was not to flame you, but I do think you should open yourself more for other people's opinions. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=26345">Merrahar</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
And Merharra, you're already at the top of the game, got pretty much everything you can 'til Fantasy gets into the next level of raiding.  You're already level 65...<br>
<br>
Try being a sub-60 rogue when there are so many rogue twinks out there it's ridiculous.  And the only place people want to go is DL-KC-PoD/N/I.<br>
<br>
I tried and tried to get people to go dungeon crawling while I was leveling up, but to keep pace with my friends in game (who had more time then me) I had to go to the standard places to level.<br>
<br>
Out of all the raiding I did spread out over a years time, I never got one piece of gear that I could use, except my epic.  And raiding is boring. I don't know about Luclin boss mobs, but Kael/Vindi/HoT were quite boring.  You sit in one spot and wait for monks to come to you.  Then you wait for tank to call assist.  Then you run in and stab it 'til it's dead.<br>
<br>
And back to waiting again... over and over and over.  No guild will ever do what the game was designed for.  No guild will ever just plow through a place like HoT.  Nope, they'll do the tried and true boring camps.  Exploiting pathing bugs to pull single mobs at a time.  Doing whatever they can to trivialize encounters so they don't die and lose their precious xp.<br>

You're right, it doesn't mean YOU have to like the use of the word.  You're right, YOU think those words are vulgar.  You're right, YOU can use any words you want to.  Maybe YOU should be a little more tolerant of other people's behavior.  No one's asking you to open up and start cussing like a sailor, at least I'm not, you're free to hate any words you wish I guess. I just simply can't stand your intolerance towards people for using WORDS and at the same time dish out insults, belittle people, and take the moral high ground in everything you say.  So I'll ask again, why is it ok for you to insult, belittle, and claim superiority over people but not ok for me to throw out some four letter words here and there in a jest manner? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=audacitybarebottom>Audacity Barebottom</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 738<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/5/03 11:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1857.topic&index=107>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ok</span><hr size=1> rofl Sole <p><br>

I use the popular English cuss words quite frequently in my own language (Dutch). I don't use them much in English, probably because the way I learned it (in school) and had to use English (in professional reports). It's not a concious choice to use them, it's just something I got used to. Yes, sometimes I use them to insult people, when I think they deserve it (or when I am being unreasonable, whatever).

Nope, except my Earring of Endless Speed all that I was wearing was essentially gear Fantasy could get pre-Vindicator. We killed Vindicator in March/April and I left Fantasy in October/November. Just accept it, some people LIKE raiding. What my level has got to do with anything, I do not know.<br>

<br>
Yes, leveling is a pain like that. But some people are willing to do that in order to get higher and thus being able to do more things. That seems silly, considering it is just a game, but maybe that proofs that Everquest is more than a game. For people blessed with friends they group with regularly, leveling is actually quite fun. Everquest wasn't fun to you, but that doesn't mean others can't have fun - Everquest obviously isn't for everyone.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And raiding is boring. I don't know about Luclin boss mobs, but Kael/Vindi/HoT were quite boring. You sit in one spot and wait for monks to come to you. Then you wait for tank to call assist. Then you run in and stab it 'til it's dead.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Correction : Raiding is boring to YOU. HoT was quite boring, I agree. I loved Vindi hits or any of the big bosses. I never grew tired of that. But, to be honest, if I were a rogue, I would think it would be pretty boring too. I think that goes for every class whose job it is to just melee a mob and not to get agro. Then again, you also have hits to mobs like Itraer Vius, it is actually challenging to make it to the mob (lots of non-stunnable gaters) and the fight itself is interesting to. I also know people used to like the Rhag 1 / 2 fights, since you have to fight to the mobs. Fights like that will be less fun if the mobs you have to fight through become to easy. <br>
<br>
We actually did plow through HoT once, it was just as boring =P I do agree, guilds prefer to keep it safe, but be honest, an hour CR isn't fun either.<br>

I pity your kids because they will grow up with a mom ( if you arnt a Magina) or dad that is a little pussy that cant listen to bad words and will cry a lot. Imo someone that gets as stressed out at such fucking little tiny things is gunna stress your kids out then they gunna run around like fucking animals and be just like every other fucking kid on the earth. Trust me you cant protect kids from shit. When i was like 6 my mom did that same thing because everyone other than me cussed at the time and before you know it BOOM i dont care what came out. it never worked as you can see because i cuss like a mother fucker and cussing really isnt bad. Just a strong term of what you think of something. Love is strong for I like you A LOT. Fuck you is for someone you just dislike completly. I really think you are bitching way to much on this topic and if something offends you just leave it alone. I cant believe you come to this place out of everyplace you could have and complained about this. If you are a young child you shouldnt play EQ anyways because in EULA it talks about kids should only play with there parent supervising or if there parent agrees to let there kid be able to see that stuff. If you dont like it how about you just leave. You are retired so just go home and continue being an overprotective parent.<br>
