Np, 5 months later I'm busting up warders and killing Vulak. You were a good guild leader and you are charismatic to say the least. I don't think you were the sole reason IV went as far as it did, however I do credit you for putting the right people together and giving them solid goals.<br>
<br>
You know that I was pretty pissed off at the whole PA thing. The way IV was ended wasn't good, I think we all realize that now. The way PA was handled wasn't good, we all know that. IV won't ever get back together, there are too many ill feelings and people unable or unwilling to forgive for that. It was fun guys, but it won't happen again.<br>
<br>
As for me... I'm done with being uber and powergaming. At least untill swg =p. My time in EQ will be about what it has been for the last month... And that's not much at all. My time in Daoc will be even less if I ever get around to buying it. I'm jus chillin with friends and taking a very low key approach to the game now.<br>

<br>
Well I do not know Krimzin at all, hes just a person in the game and I have asked him a few things before but thats about it. After reading about this and then reading what ghol said I just wanted to say that I think this post shows more good than the bad it ever would. Comparing it to the parents not feeding him dinner, food is something that you need and so is forgiveness. I mean some people make a lot of small mistakes like me, some people make very few but sometimes big mistakes, and there are of course those that vary but why hold a grudge against someone?<br>
<br>
Its just something that I do not understand, obviously someone here has done something about that and tried to fix the error. I guess we all just value life differently, I sure would feel bad if someone had died consumed with hate in their heart, but like I said before I do not know krimzin nor hold anything against him or anyone else on this server.<br>
<br>
On another note though friends are the only reason why I play on this server. Friend and I started here on the first day but another friend of mine screwed me and I had to start over. Even though he did something that I really didnt like I didnt try to leave a grudge with that person. After all in the end it is just a game, try to have fun, if not then why the @#%$ are you playing it? <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6148" target="_blank">Jet Black</a><BR>

<br>
Krim you didn't let me down. And yes, go chill out from gaming and get back to RL, 'cause all gamers will need to in some point of time. I know I did and I'm enjoying it. <br>
<br>
Most people's goals is to achieve true happiness from a life of virtue. You can continue to achieve this happiness with games as long as reality and our games are balanced. The way *some* of us hardcored it, unbalanced this for us. It got in the way of our work, school, and responsibilities -- it got so much in the way that it affected some peoples virtues(thats what I believe, agree with it or not it's my opinion). Causing un-ethical decisions that resulted in people being stressed out, unhappy, and sometimes even offended. Thus, the breaking of some friendships.  Some examples was the sudden disband of IV, the creation of PA with the disproval of others, and many others you know of that I will not list.  I don't know if I'm right, but it's a thought.<br>
<br>
What you need to do, now I hope you can do this -- is to get rid of gaming all together. Yes you heard me, throw it out the window, go on and ebay ur chars and loot I don't care. It was quite clear that gaming got in the way of your morality and decision making. Get on with your life, get a full time job(if u don't have one), get back together with ur friends, etc. Don't touch another game cause I know it is going to affect you. When you feel you can play again, (much later on), play casually, and don't let it affect your life. Krim I believed you before and you've never let me down, and I know you won't this time. <br>
<br>
Anyways I hope that helps you in deciding what to do.<br>
<br>
For all the people bad mouthing Krim and thinking hes looking for sympathy, I think you are wrong. Hes simply saying his goodbyes, and apologizing for all the things hes done, don't tell me you have never done a thing wrong in your life cause I know I've done some.<br>
<br>
Anyways I hope that helps you in deciding what to do.<br>
<br>
Well we had many EQ memories, most of them good. It's been an honour working with you and the IV crew. <br>
<br>
Anyways Xziled, good luck to balancing out reality and gaming, 'cause you've taken a step in the right direction today.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ujkarisloco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jkarisloco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/16/01 2:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: In My Darkest Hours..

(really long)</span><hr size=1>    Krimz.. i duno if you will read this but hey I thought i should post something. Im not quite sure what happened with you or with my relationship to you. When i first was introduced to IV it was through you and being casual friends with you. We talked a bit and joked a lot and it was fun. I got to be friends with people in IV and eventually ended up joining it. Through this all we got along. Somewhere towards the end that changed and you changed. I am not sure why this happened and you never felt inclined to tell me when im sure it could have been worked out whatever was wrong between us.<br>
<br>
   I gave up a lot to play with IV; friends, another good guild, put off some RL stuff etc. Many times you made me feel not appriciated and like i was a cruddy player, which i honestly dont think i was. I gave as much and more time and energy to the guild than i should have but cest la vie. I made some very good friends in IV and i do not regret joining the guild. We accomplished a lot in a short time and for the most part had fun doing so. <br>
<br>
   I am sorry for you that you changed the way you did. When i met you i thought a lot of you as a person as well as a player and guild leader. Towards the end I think at least two of those went to hell and only you knows why. I hope for your sake and your future that you really learned something from this, about the importance of friends and fun in accomplishing goals. Also, and more importantly, I hope you truely realize that in the end all you have is friends and that if you put too much in front of that you will lose everything and its really lonely going through life that way.<br>
<br>
    I appriciate you posting here and hope that you are sincere in what you are saying. You truely did hurt a lot of people. While i dont think that you did this on purpose, you still did and maybe you will learn that thinking of others feelings is a good quality to have. I hope that the Krimzin i originally met will find his way back to you and that where ever you end up, you end up happy. Im sorry things worked out the way they did but life goes on and I have a lot of good memories from IV and the friends i met there, even you :P<br>
<br>
   This post has ended up ten times longer than i planned it to and maybe its cuz i never said goodbye when i left really. I have no hard feelings towards you or anyone on Vazaelle and i truely had a good time there. The time to move on and grow has come and I am enjoying it. I hope that you find this as well. Good Luck to you and take care im sure that with your charisma and leadership skills you could go far in life if you take some of the valuable lessons that are here with you.<br>

<br>
God, I do.  I have to say i'm quite happy now that most of the asses from IV are gone in retirement because what remains are the people from IV that truely enjoy the game and aren't so worried about being uber or nothing at all.  Those are the people that ruin the game.  Yea the game is fun with some competition added, but not at the expense of being a complete ass to other people simply because they didn't level to 50 in less than 2 days or aren't in the guild.  I mean, there still are the Zerric type people still in the game, but hopefully that will get filtered out soon also.  <br>
<br>
As far as Krimzin is concerned, how can you argue that he didn't put one of the best guilds accomplishment wise, in the game.  You can't.  For that, I salute you.  I hope that what other people are saying about getting your rl @#%$ straight is true.  EQ is a drug and like BEFB said, getting away from it cold turkey is the best thing if you want to quit.  I hope Krimzin takes the zeal he spent with the game, and applies it to real life.  I think he would go far.  <br>

Well I know I gave you a ton of @#%$ on the boards, but I must admit your a good gamer! You knew the game, you played it top notch and for that respect was earned by many. You led IV to do alot of top stuff for such a young server.<br>

We didn't get along and despite what you may think of me, I always respected your ability, both to play the game and to motivate people.  You certainly pushed the server to the limit and while it sometimes brought out the worst in people, it also brought out the best.<br>
<br>
PO, CC and Arise are all taking big steps forward these days, but I think it's safe to say that the denizens of deep NTOV and the warders in ST will be sleeping easy for a while.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usolidsnakeiv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SolidSnakeIV </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/16/01 1:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A surprising comment from me</span><hr size=1> Supa get a clue please.  You have never wanted to be anything but on top.  In the beginning Krim actually wanted a rotation set up with Slivers.  Your leader, Chug, said no.  IV beat Slivers to the punch a large portion of the time.  Slivers disbands, you join CC.  Baldrik has stated several times he was the reason this server was FFA.  He never wanted to do a rotation system.  You guys got a few, and you were the one that said it is hard to race us while you sleep.  IV continued to get the most.  It was your guildleaders that made things FFA.  So please, stick to the facts, or find a real reason why you are a gimp.<br>
<br>
And to CC, I always respected you guys.  Have a few friends in there, so this isn't directed at you.  Just the fool that likes to talk.<br>

<br>
Krimzin, you were my bane for a long time, initially because of those stupid early day skirmishes between ToS and IV over Lodizal(dumb turtle) and it all got rolled up into a bunch of bad feelings directed at you. Never really felt bad about most of the rest of IV, just you. I did some nasty @#%$ to IV for no real reason other than vindication for something ridiculously minor, it made me take a break to think about what the hell I was doing and re-evaluate fortunately.<br>
<br>
When I came back, regardless of my opinion's I stated in the PA rant thread, I honestly had good feelings towards you as a person, just from speaking to a number of old-IV, I had a very nagging suspicion that history was going to repeat itself. Like it did, unfortunately. I would like to think you thought of me as at least neutral in your book towards the end, but everytime we talked I felt like I was grudgingly earning any respect from you, a big portion why I never apologized to you directly before, I was afraid bringing up old @#%$ would piss you off all over again, and we all play EQ for one core reason(or should at least): to have fun, didn't want to upset that.<br>
<br>
So Krimzin, I salute you and wish the best where ever you turn up. And if you're looking for new friends on DAoC, since it sounds like Cass x2 and the others have left you behind in some way, just spend some time chatting and hanging out with people and I'm sure you'll find another group to spend time with. The lack of competition a la EQ for most things makes it TOO easy to make friends IMO... (And if you're planning on heading to Shadowbane when it releases, I'd be pleased to see you there as well - at least if you're not killing me)<br>
<br>
And now, I will fade back into the shadows.... <p><H2><B>--Vaclav Romanov--</H2></B><BR>

Do we really want to make a Rants and Flames thread out of Krimzin's farewell?  (However par-for the course it may be?)<br>
<br>
Say your peace here.  Let's just not start flaming each other.  Krimzin is gone, Two large and influentional guilds are gone, and a chapter of Vazaelle's history is closed.<br>
<br>
How the next chapter begins depends on us.<br>
