The first in 1998, was by a small group of gamers claiming that UO did not meet the expectations of stability that the box indicated.<br>
<br>
This was settled out of court, no details of the settlement are known -- that I'm aware of anyway, and I never paid much attention.<br>
<br>
The second was in 2000 by UO's volunteer guides (whatever they're called).  They believe that they were treated as employees and thus felt that they were deserved to be paid as employees, including backwages.  This is laughable for so many reasons.  I don't know how this was resolved, but I don't believe that it got very far.  I only really remember what I read on Lums.<br>
<br>
Verant may not be a smart company, but Sony is a very smart corporation and has likely been very aware of what's happened with other games and I'm sure that EQ's EULA reflects that.  Don't doubt that changing the system requirements for the game wasn't passed before a team of lawyers before they announced Luclin.<br>
<br>
I'm not anywhere close to a lawyer, but I do believe that Sony is covered.  I believe in the strength of EULA's.  I don't believe that a country that is *famous* worldwide for insane and successful law suits that they would not have been rendered useless otherwise.<br>
<br>
I'm against law suits of this nature.  Progress comes at a cost, and I think that problems that VI has experienced were almost unavoidable.  I think they've learned why so many FPS games have limited content test versions available to everyone to download months before the release so that they can nail down bugs that come with modern 3D engines.  At the same time, it's understandable why a company wouldn't want to do this.<br>
<br>
Despite the problems that they've had, I do applaud VI for pushing the envelope the way they did with this engine.  A lot of people love to compare FPS game engines to EQ, but those games are marginal in terms of the sheer number of textures and displayed polys.  I think that the expansion is technically and graphically impressive..  but that's totally subjective.<br>
<br>
I would prefer this over an outdated looking game that no longer attracts new gamers to its community and dies a slow death.<br>
<br>
Wow, I sound pretty conformist. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucerosofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceros of Vazaelle</A> at: 12/13/01 12:29:47 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umomur.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Momur</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 112<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/13/01 1:32:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Neverquest - a Class Action? - Discuss</span><hr size=1> Q, Hehehe that was funny. I saw that one before. Isn't this about the time of year when the annual &quot;Darwin Awards&quot; come out?<br>
<br>
I do not agree with your quote. I do believe that it's popular to have that attitude.  And those &quot;Darwin Award Winners&quot; are entertaining. But the sooner you realize that alot of people are out to F* you, the better off you'll be.  (Not really that extreme, but ya gotta take a defensive attitude.)<br>
<br>
Car dealers are the worst. Just try getting them to fix your car correctly under warranty.  They will do every mickey-mouse, half assed thing they can to fix a problem until you threaten them. (I got a couple of long stories I won't bore you with.)<br>
<br>
Car dealers are followed closely by landlords/apartment managers.  Just try getting your deposit back.  Once they gave it back to me! - they called me two weeks later and said it was a clerical error and I should send the $700 back - yeah right!<br>
<br>
Next comes Insurance Agents - oooooo they are bad. They are not your friends.<br>
<br>
And the Swiss, I hate the Swiss. Then there's the guy at the pizza shop that always gives me the small slice. And that time, at band camp, when . . . <br>

Now, if those of you who can't play were even close to a majority, you might be able to do something, but Verant is busting their ass to make the game completely playable, and the last few who can't get in may be the extreme cases. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ueldoran59.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eldoran59</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/13/01 1:51:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Neverquest - a Class Action? - Discuss</span><hr size=1> Ceros finally hit it on the head. VI has taken a huge step ahead with Luclin and it is by and large an awesome product in my opinion. Sure there are problems and they are doing their best to work through them. Some of you are unhappy because you have lost some play time. Although it is unfortunate (I enjoy playing as much as anyone), it's not the end of the world. You want reimbursement for your $9.95 per month? Let's see, 6 hours/day x 30 hours = 180 hours/month (more or less) $9.95/180 = $.055/hour - now, how many hours did you miss out on? 20? Here's a Buck!!! What a bunch of wasted energy.<br>
The best way to get even if you don't like the product is to cancel your account and go elsewhere with your $9.95 of leisure/disposable income. You can go see one more movie a month, rent a batting cage for 30 minutes, Have a steak dinner at Denny's, A Margarita at El Torito, Take a 2 hour Drive, lots of stuff. The point here is, instead of rallying to lynch the people at Verant for introducing a new product that was not perhaps ready for release(I am glad they released it anyway), you have two choices; Play or don't.<br>
I feel your pain on the frustrations associated with this new release, but in time I think they will work it all out. Until then, I am still going to play and deal with the minor hassles and frequent patches. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umomur.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Momur</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 114<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/13/01 2:11:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Neverquest - a Class Action? - Discuss</span><hr size=1> The logic behind your math is F'ed. You pay per month not per hour.  It's more like $10 for the month lost + $30 for Luclin which doesn't work + $?20-40? for the other disks which are now cup coasters. ~$70 stolen.<br>
<br>
Have you ever returned a game to the store and when asked by the manager,&quot;Why are you returning it?&quot;, looked them straight in the eye and said,&quot;Because it sucks.&quot; I have. I got my money back. I'm not quite ready to do that with EQ, yet. I have faith that they'll fix it.<br>
<br>
Yes they did make a business decision to move quickly with a new engine.<br>
<br>
If those who can't play are the vast minority, then why do I keep getting a daily form letter from EQTech telling me to reinstall DX8.1 and reference their &quot;knowledge base&quot;. Instead of a real answer.<br>

Are you running yet Mr. Orcbane? I have implemented a ton of fixes and I am finally running, I think. I played for a half-hour and logged out normally last night.  Hopefully I can test it out for a longer time tonite.<br>
<br>
 These are the things I did.<br>
<br>
- Are your Sound, Video and Modem on different IRQ's?  If not you may have to physically move the boards.<br>
- Disable any firewall you have up. They are sometimes stealth installed with your anti-virus crap. No Firewalls with EQ.<br>
- Anti-virus has to be turned off before you do anything with drivers.<br>
- Turn Anti-virus off and reinstall DX8.1. Reboot. Reinstall Video Driver. Reboot. Reinstall Sound Driver. Reboot.<br>
- Reduced my hardware video acceleration by one notch from max - find this in Settings - Advanced in your display control panel.<br>
- Turn off texture compression from your Options in EQ<br>
- Of course, turn all of the Luclin options down and play on low rez. Then gradually add stuff til you crash.<br>
- Once you're in, your clip plane all the way down in EQ.<br>

<br>
A law suit could be established on two fronts (and a remote possibility in a third) in the case of the Luclin release:<br>
<br>
1. Contract law - terms of your EULA basically limit your rights in the extreme and you don't have a hope in hell.<br>
<br>
2. Consumer Protection Law - damages are likely (certainly in most jurisdictions) limited to the price of the goods purchased.  So after your $20,000 in court fees I do hope you enjoy your cheque for the price of the game, plus two weeks refund equalling about $5.<br>

3. Negligence/torts - not sure where the U.S. courts are headed on tortious liability where a contract exists between the seller and the buyer, but courts have in other jurisdictions (Canada and the U.K. that I'm familiar with) taken a very hard line in saying that if the liability is contemplated and addressed in the contract, they won't step outside it and impose further duties of care.<br>

Sorry for the legalese - I tried to turn it into lay person speech, but perhaps if you didn't follow it, you shouldn't be pretending you know enough to start a class action.  If you did follow and just disagree, I'd certainly be interested in hearing comments. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/upigboyph.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PigboyPH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 599<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/14/01 8:49:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Neverquest - a Class Action? - Discuss</span><hr size=1> No halbar ingles!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=41221" target="new">Haels</link><BR>

Understand. I hear that whole Tortoise thing. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Are Eula's really that strong? There are sooo many ways to get around those things. Just like non-disclosure agreements and even security checks, it can be claimed that they were improperly presented.<br>
<br>
I better read the Eula and see if the liability is contemplated.<br>
<br>
eh, whatever, I am just curious.

Back to lurking.

The game works for the vast majority of people.  If it didn't work for anyone you could easily have a lawsuit.  Since it does for most though, a judge would laugh in your face and so would most normal people for you wasting so much time and making such a mockery of the civil court system.  <br>
<br>
You're going to lose a lot more money than $40.00 over the course of your life to products you aren't happy with.  Some people take their family out for dinner and spend $100 bucks and the food sucks.  Yet, the restaurants have ads in the paper stating how great their food is, do you file a class action law suit?  <br>
<br>
*whine *whine *whine* <br>
<br>
Everytime someone doesn't get their way they cry lawsuit.  It's what sucks about this country.  I get people at work who don't make their car payments and don't call our office.  Then we redeposit a check of theirs that bounced 3 or 4 months ago because it has funds on it.  The customer calls in and tells us what assholes we are because they didn't want to pay their bills or return phone calls.  LAWSUIT LAWSUIT!  We laugh in their faces.  It's a fucking knee-jerk reaction to say lawsuit for everything.  Guess what?  We didn't even do anything illegal.  But it's the American crybaby mentality that years of cash-hungry mongels have instilled into the country who make a profit off any exploit of the system that they can.<br>
<br>
The expansion sucks.  The loading time sucks.  The lag sucks.  The freezes every 30-60 seconds sucks.  I wasted my hard-earned money on it.  However, I don't cry about $40.00.  I bet most of the people who would seriously consider a lawsuit, for the most part, are the ones who play EQ 16 hours a day and don't know what a job is.<br>
