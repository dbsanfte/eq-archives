Common sense will tell you what you have to do to play the character to your best of ability. Learn how to make hot keys, and how to use them. Communication in a group is key, hotkeys will help you to keep everyone informed on what you are doing.<br>
<br>
Might want to check out Eq.castersrealm.com for more advice on a cleric. Good luck to you and may your adventures be great! <p><center><b>Darkeish Nitebringer 53rd Wanderer</b></center>

You forgot keep gate memmed at all times.<br>
<br>
Ok ... Casters are wussy ... always throw them smaller and faster heals than you throw your melee's.  A warrior will have 2x the ac and 2-3x the hp than any caster.  So while you can CH your tank, you sure as hell cant CH a chanter or mage.<br>
<br>
Prior to getting remedy, i would keep greater heal memmed.  The cast time was short enough to throw a heal on a chanter getting beat on.  <br>
<br>
Know your spells.  Know how many hp they heal, how fast they cast, and what their refresh time is.  Understand what the difference is in the char's you're healing.  Know when your monk has mend, cause you will put a fist through your monitor when you see a monk getting to 2 red of health because he cant manage his aggro and right when you cast that heal that brings your mana down too low to heal again, the dip mends and screws up your mana.  Know your buffs, know how to time them.  The only thing more frustrating than someone telling me a buff is going is someone having to ask for a buff.  <br>
<br>
I would say probably level 30 and below go for a good mix of wis and +mana items.  After 30, go for more wis.<br>
<br>
Also, dont be afraid to let someone die.  I have this whole thing about freaking when someone in my group dies.  But i have come to terms with it.  I often let people die to save the raid or group.  I have no problem ressing a rogue but keeping the chanter and tank alive.  And on raids, i've often let people die to save another group's chanter, cleric or tank.<br>
<br>
learn how to target.  Dont depend on the mouse.  learn how to type:<br>
/TAR PLAYERNAME<br>
and understand that you only need 3-4 letters of their name.<br>
<br>
i have saved raids because i can type<br>
/targ dalch<br>
and hit remedy faster than other people can click him and heal.<br>
<br>
Dalcharis is usually one of our main chanters on raids :)  He thinks i have a hotkey with his name on it already.<br>
<br>
Learn to read the text.  Watch for who's getting summoned on raids.  There's usually a group that is a good damge group, but doesnt have the main thanks.  That cleric has a lot of mana left over. So know how to save the OTHER clerics mana by tossing heals to those who are getting summoned or beat on.  but for GODS sake tell them.  Nothing will piss someone off more than timing a CH only to cast it and see another cleric heal the target<br>
<br>
Other than that .. be prepared to sit on your ass 60% of the time, be f**ked out of loot for symbols until you get 50+ and hit sebilis, and get tons of begs for resses :) <p><center>

Another one to remember for your group when it gets wild and wooley out there.. the function keys are short cut keys for the group.  <br>
<br>
The video is for fighters and nukers.  Clerics live on the text, and the red bars of health and their own mana bar.<br>
<br>
Good advice so I will repost it in caps:<br>
ENCHANTERS ARE YOUR LIFE... KEEP THEM ALIVE, SYMBOLED AND BUFFED.  Do this for your meat shield.  Learn to say no to buffing people who dont need it... wasted mana really.  I like to use my Donal's arms to buff those who think they need it but never get hit.<br>
<br>
Macros can help out too under 35 especially <br>
/sit off<br>
%t is being healed<br>
/cast 1 - 4 (as in which jewel you are casting)<br>
/pause 100 (or length of spell cast)<br>
/book 1<br>
<br>
Don't ever think you are nuker, or a tank.  In reality the clerics life is:<br>
Stand - Heal - Sit<br>
<br>
On the other hand we are usually the most social people because of this. <p><HTML>

Heroic Bond is Heroic Bond is Heroic bond .. so everyone gets buffed at the same time.  And it's more of a waste of mana healing that dumb ass mage that overnukes or ressing him, than just tossing him a hp buff and forgetting about it.<br>
<br>
I never get stingy when it comes to buffs anymore.  Used to.  But now i rather symbol/hero/ac everyone and just be sure they all have that padding should things go bad.<br>
<br>
I finally got my Donals gloves ... and the ac from those is only 6 less than Shield of Words, so everyone but the main tank gets glove love.<br>
<br>
Clerics can definately tank .. and i sugguest you keep your defensive maxed or close and also keep your AC up.  I **LOVE** pulling mobs off chanters or casters in general.  1-2 stuns and sitting normally does it.  I can take the pounding and they cant.  with my ac and hp, i can live a hell of a lot longer than they can.  <br>
<br>
Nuking ... not necessarily a strong point, but still a viable option of necessary.<br>
<br>
I normally have 3 stuns, 3 heals, 1 divine barrier and 1 root spell memmed at all times.  I sometimes take away the root and add divine aura.  I used to have gate, but i have become secure in my group's abilities to know i am either gonna be fine, or we're all gonne die and do a CR anyway.  My gating doesnt help.<br>
<br>
Oh, and divine light sucks ass :)  Sorry, but Remedy, Celestial healing and complete healing post 52 is all ya need.  Divine light is 4 seconds cast time, way too slow to be truely effective.  Remedy is perfect for casters, or when your tank gets ganked and a CH has no shot of landing,  3 second cast, a life saver, i assure you.  Celestial is great once you figure out it's use.  I use it to top people off after a fight (700pt heal, 125 mana, very efficient).  I also use it when i think I'll need more time to land a CH, or if i think we're gonna kill the mob fast enough were i WOULD need a CH if i didnt cast a celestial, but with a celestial, i wont need it.<br>
<br>
In other words .. the mob is gonna do about 900 or 1,000 pts of damage to my tank, i toss a celestial which keeps him at 80 or 70% health thru the whole fight, i can med thru most of the fight, i save the other 225 mana from the celestial, and at best, i have to top the tank off again with another 125pt remedy which is still a savings of 100 mana.<br>
<br>
Best thing to get, if you can, is the Thurg/Sky/Kael or POG pants.  They have a built-in area heal that is just awesome.  Mana free, keeps everyone topped off, not too slow either.  I have a guildie that never tosses a heal because he just spams his pants :) <p><center>

usually, target nearest NPC, then /ass over and over to switch targets.<br>
<br>
all the while the spell book is up, this would give ya a picture of the battle, and add 2 or more chat sessions with friends not in group.<br>
<br>
use the Heal+Sit agro to move mobs in back and forth and watch tanks chase--this will give you an idea who goes auto attack and afk.<br>
<br>
play /gems while waiting for the rest of the slow pokes loading from res--you can pause your gems game.<br>
<br>
basically, if you find youself bored from sitting/medding melee.  BUT if you have a twink melee, you know how sucky clerics are at melee even with the best str+haste buffs. so, stay sitting for full mana at all times. <p><center>

I played with an enchanter 100% of the time (my wifey Aurah) and seroiusly, she didn't attempt to do much crowd control at those levels because 1) we really didn't need it 2) no one would assist anyway unless they were a twink<br>
<br>
Generally, AT YOUR LEVEL, keep the courage line buffs on everyone (the AC buff you can leave off except for the tanks), tell people when you get low mana, and max your defense, offense, and 1hb (if you use it) every level. You'll thank me in the long run. Its only 5 points to get per level, which is NOT a lot <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Try being level 55+ and realizing your defense needs to go up about 100 points (skills only increase when fighting dark blue cons and higher mobs), keeping in mind defense only goes up when something is pounding on you, and you get the idea.<br>
<br>
Dueling a mage friend's pet that cons dark blue to you is a good way to get your defense maxed at early levels, just make sure the mage knows what they are doing with the /pet back off command.<br>
<br>
Damage shields also increase your offense as well as defense when something hits you.<br>
<br>
Summary:<br>
<br>
Other than that, its pretty straight forward at low levels. Use your biggest heal on tanks, your 2nd biggest heal on casters. Keep courage line on everyone, AC and Symbol on the ones getting hit a lot.  Keep up skils <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Grr, just noticed the date of original post.  You've probably found out most of this now on your own, but will leave for the next new cleric.  I hope your doing well and having fun with your cleric!<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
<br>
Just a few observations to add.  First off, Adon, I agree with you totally for lower level clerics.  Will add though that I've seen many starting clerics lose it because they couldn't manage their mana, group members die and the cleric gets blamed. First off, you don't need to try and keep everyone full health all the time. For one it is highly likely that the MOB will aggro  on you if you try, and a dead cleric does no one any good. You job is to keep them alive, period. Good melee will respect that and want to practice their bind wound during downtime anyway.  Strategy does change a bit after 50, and in midlevel raids, but you will likely have figured that out by then anyway.<br>
<br>
Level up to 11 as fast as you can, any way possible.  Practice spell casting, 1H blunt and melee on blues as much as you can.  Solo is cool at this stage as you don't lose XP when you die, and you should be close to your bind point. between levels six and ten, you may want to partner up to make it go faster and learn how to start grouping. Personally I wouldn't waste time grouping before level six if you are mainly concerned with leveling.<br>
<br>
As you go on, you are going to need to learn to group.  Here are some things you'll find out along the way ( I hope! ).<br>
<br>
Monks are mana sponges at low through mid levels unless twinked a lot. They get aggro and get hit a lot, especially if they don't have FD skill worked up, and their dodge/defense.  Be vocal but polite if you are in a group that overpulls, loses health quickly and you can't keep up with healing (i.e. - Orcs in Oasis, Giant Fort in Frontier Mountains, Sarnak Fort in LOIO, etc.) If they won't listen, don't be afraid to find another group.<br>
<br>
Practice your smallest alteration and abduration spells on noobs at newbie area to get the skills up.  This can pay off big time down the road in many ways.  One, you will see your casting skills improve remarkably.  And you will make friends that will help along the way.  Channeling should go up as well. Channeling is to spells what AC is to meleeing.  Both of these can help you get casts off at the critical time even while being pounded on. Always try to max channeling in a new level as early as you can.<br>
<br>
Always keep DA in a gem slot.  This will save you often, and with the new rez spells, saving yourself to come back and rez the rest of the group will be greatly appreciated.  When a young cleric (pre-30s) don't wait til the last group member is dead to cast it and take off if the situation is obviously going bad.  This may sound bad, but 9 times out of 10 you are going to be more important to the group alive at that point.<br>
<br>
Get Jboots as soon as possible.  Another thing most people fail to realize is that most clerics do travel a lot.  Requests for buffs from friends, rezzes, outrunning MOBs, etc. You will be soooo glad you got them.  Until then, I recommend you make a friend of a Shaman who can make SoW potions for you.<br>
<br>
Stuns, learn them well. They are effective tools for helping your tanks, keeping you alive and for mana management.  Cast a heal, stun the MOB.  That way the tank and other melee have time to get the MOBs attention back.  It also helps on casting MOBs.  And if you tank was stunned, it gives them time to get back into the fray and get control.  For very little mana, they also give you a few extra ticks of med time and delay the need for the next heal.<br>
<br>
And finally, unless you plan to have your ranger finance buying your spells and spell components, don't be a wallflower and not loot.  You are helping do as much if not more damage to the MOB with your heals than most melee dish out at low and mid levels. You deserve your fair share and a good group will let you have time to both med and loot. And in my opinion, by doing this you are helping other clerics by teaching your group to share fairly.  Just please don't grumble and whine; if need be, just state your point deliberately and politely.<br>
<br>
<br>
Gah! didn't mean to go on so much...but there you have it, my 2cp.  Good luck, I hope you have as much fun as a cleric as I have!  <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Most important advise at *ALL* levels for clerics:<br>
<br>
ASSIST HEALING<br>
<br>
Make 2 Hotkeys, one:<br>
<br>
/assist &lt;Main Tank Player Name&gt; <br>
<br>
and:<br>
/asisst<br>
<br>
Start a fight by assisting your main tank or puller, then continuously use the other (/assist) key.   You will first assist your tank to have the mob targetted, then assist the mob to see who he is hitting.  Now you know definately who has aggro (no need to wait for the red bars to start dropping).  If you see that the mob is hitting the enchanter, fire off heals right away.<br>
<br>
I basically am clicking that assist button every 2 seconds for an entire fight to see who is getting beat on. <p><table border="1" width="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0"

I always heal with my hotkeys because it's so much easier to hit a 1, 2, 3, or 4 after targetting someone.  And a lot of times, you don't get to sit after a heal, you have more than one to heal and who wants to waste the time of sitting and standing up between heals if you're in an emergent situation?  Sometimes you'll get a tank in your group who likes too pull till he's almost dead, and there is no time for CH to go off, so you give him quick heal then CH.  Or worse case, quick heal him, heal chanter, then CH puller.  All kinds of situations where I just can't sit immediately after I cast.  I just can't let go of that control.<br>
<br>
Also, you it is always polite to have your heals on hotkey.  Saves you from the whiners too.  If you're mid CH and your tank starts going YH34L!!!kdjH34L!!!  It gets really annoying.  So if he see's in group that his heal is on the way, he can rest easy and do his job a little better.  My hotkeys look something like this:<br>
<br>
/cast 6<br>
/g CH on %T<br>
/e completely heals %T<br>
/cast 6<br>
<br>
and if on a raid the last line is in our raid channel.  The reason for /cast 6 is twice is for those occassional annoying fizzles.  You don't want to spam the group, so if it fizzles, it will instantly cast again, if it doesn't fizzle, it just ignors that last command.  It's kinda nice, someone taught me that a while back.<br>
<br>
And once again to say again what others say, chanter must be kept alive.  I personally don't like to let anyway die, but that chanter can save everyones life if he is kept alive.  <br>
<br>
I also feel that the DA/DB line of spells are extremly important.  There are a lot of cases where if cleric doesn't die, necro isn't needed.  It's also great for aggro control.  Damn mob bites your ass for CHing that warrior, sometimes Taunt just doesn't work.  You hit that DA and you lose aggro immediately, and it's up long enough for your warrior to regain aggro.<br>
<br>
And ALWAYS keep in mind, there are a lot of assholes that play this game.  Keep thick skin and don't let them get to you.  <br>
<br>

<br>
I aggree it's not a good idea to including sitting down at the end of your macro.  Sitting adds a temporary amount to the mobs hate list, but...<br>
<br>
What's the harm in adding &quot;/sit off&quot; to the beginning of all your heal macros?<br>
<br>
I sit down manually, but always rely on my hotkeys to stand up, just make the first line of all your heal macros &quot;/sit off&quot;.<br>
<br>
My Divine Light macro is like this:<br>
<br>
/sit off<br>
/g Divine Light on - %T<br>
/pause 2, /cast 2<br>
/cast 2<br>
<br>
/sit off = Stand Up<br>
<br>
/g Divne Light on - %T = Tell the group who I'm healing<br>
<br>
/pause 2, /cast 2 = Begin casting Divine Light then pause for 2/10th a second<br>
<br>
/cast 2 = Try casting Divine Light again<br>
<br>
<br>
The reason I try to cast it twice is to catch a fizzle. <p><table border="1" width="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0"
