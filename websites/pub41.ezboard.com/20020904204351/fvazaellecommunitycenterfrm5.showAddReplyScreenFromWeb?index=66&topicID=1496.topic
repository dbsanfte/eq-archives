When I saw the post myself, I felt considerable disappointment mainly because I do not enjoy friction between EA and other guilds. I am glad to see many still do not hold animosity toward us, but it still sickens me to see a long-time guildmate and friend slammed and put down personally.<br>
<br>
I understand Galli ignited things himself when he posted, however, I know him and have known him for a long time, as he has been with EA I think well over a year now. I can understand how it seemed at the time events were unfolding last night. <br>
<br>
The night before, we had killed roy. Before that, we had not seen any guilds in NTOV for some time. When we then were headed to NTOV last night to work on mobs beyond roy, it was noticed PO was headed there as well. At that point, it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> appeared</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> as though PO's sudden interest in ntov could be an attempt cockblock or screw over EA. I wasn't online at the time, but I may have very well wondered the same thing. <br>
<br>
Galli has been a tireless and loyal member of EA since he became a part of us. I am grateful to him for all the times he has made me laugh even on some of the most dismal days. He's stuck with us during times when I was sure we were about to fall apart. I couldn't even begin to go into all he has put into EA, and I can't imagine him not being a part of us.<br>
<br>
I stand by him now, the way he stood by us during rough times. Please just stop the flaming, let this die here, out of respect for EA, because although all of us may not agree with his post here, I believe I can safely say we all do greatly value him as a member of EA. Chalk it up to a bad day and a bad initial impression of what was going on at the time, if you can. I'd rather be flamed myself here than see another post bashing Galli.    <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18980"><img src="http://miragia.homestead.com/files/Tempsig.jpg" width= 623 height= 239></A><BR>

He messed up posting this and you admit to that. Hopefully he has learned better and wont do it again (or there will be alot more harsh words then you saw on this thread).<br>

As far as PO comming to NToV after a long while. Well as has been said there was the Emp and NToV up. And the Emp &gt;PO atm so off to NToV it was. NToV is not exactly gimp on the drops, po can still use afew of them so now EA is in direct competition in that zone. All I can say is welcome to rat race. PO and CC have been in competition for end game content for quite some time now and EA is starting to get into the same realm of mobs, that means you are going to be competing with us, this is not a bad thing and we welcome the competition. The more you guys now excell on tougher mobs the more you are going to be comming into competition with us. Before NToV there was very few similar mobs PO and EA went after, now there are starting to be more. Once you break into a zone or kill a certain mob that does not give you rights to that content. PO kills the AoW now quite well, it does not mean CC should back off, quite the contrary now I suspect they have extra ambitions to kill him before we do. They attack the Cursed ASAP when he pops after patch in order to avoid PO getting it, that is annoying to us but that is the game and we have to accept that, same thing with the AL. Both of those mobs would die to us if they were up in our primetime, CC know it, so they make sure they are dead before that, all I can say to CC about that is touche. And that is all EA should say when PO kills something they want, touche. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle.com Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.vazaelle.com">Vazaelle.com</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
