That is besides the point.  I deleted the posts because I violated some rules that i will not apologize for.  I am not the only fuckin one who has posted pics.  If my sister would stand up for herself instead of sitting back and letting a whore like Samadhi talk shit about her I wouldn't have to say shit like I do.  And I HATE ignoring people that deserve to have some attention put their way because I feel sorry that they road the short bus to school every day.<br>
<br>
 I can feel safer knowing that your mother and sister are safe from his sexual advances if you would just admit that you have souoght counseling.  I know all about it Samadhi.  If you would take a few seconds to take the cock out of your mother's mouth maybe your head would clear up long enough to think straight.  You jealousy of me is obvious.  Bringing up the past like you do means you are still infatuated with me.  Hey buddy - IM  A GUY.   I never ever said I was female and yet you are still infatuated with me because I know my sisters would never give you the time of day.  You are a ponk ass, wanna be, never get anywhere, bitch who can only defend himself by acting all brave and tough.  The moment someone gets a little serious he gets all scared and runs with his tail between his legs.<br>
<br>
And to defend what I said about 9/11... I said that since 9/11 I have more important things that bother me.  There is nothing wrong with that since, yes, I was directly affected.  I don't need permission to post pics or talk about whatever I want.  And if my sister gets mad and I cant play Esmer - Booo fuckin hoo.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ugrundalldameatshield.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grundall DaMeatshield</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 130<br> <font color=#333333>(12/14/01 9:00:32 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Movement for....</span><hr size=1> Originally he had posted two pics of women that he claimed were his sisters Mareth,  which he has now edited out because his 'sister' came here and belittled him for posting their pics.

/shrug.   Doesn't make much sense now maybe I should edit in some random happy comments.<br>

You ask what good this will do? Well, everyone knows what Fitz says is fact.  I will be the impartial justice fighting for your flaming defense.  Otherwise, regardless of what has been said in the past, I think there has been enough mother/sister slandering going on around here to satisfy even Gankak's desires at his own family reunion.  <br>
<br>
Sure, I have been known to flame a time or two, but the senseless battering of people that want nothing to do with this stuff (should Esmer end up having sisters as he claims) is just stupid.  It takes two to tango...no use flaming if someone else doesn't return the favor.  <br>
<br>
As far as the greatest rogue ever debate...Tigole is certainly a brother in arms, but at night, when he is balled up in the fetal position whispering prayers to the gods of Guiness and Goats....he wishes he was Fitz.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uoriathin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oriathin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 103<br> <font color=#333333>(12/14/01 10:14:18 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Movement for....</span><hr size=1> Grundall - are you THAT naive that you think all people related need to look alike?  Does every woman in this world have the ability to have children?  If they don't have the ability, how do they get kids?  Think about it.  It's amazing that people think in only one direction instead of thinking outside of the square.  I could care less whether you believe it or not.  That was the last thing on my mind.  I wasn't flashing pictures on the screen to make people say &quot;ooo ahhh&quot;  they are Hot.  I don't give a shit.  I could have posted fat ass ugly bitches.  The point was that Sam was making comments about someone and I thought he should see who he was making comments about.  And besides, why isn't anyone saying &quot;I don't believe that guy is you...&quot;  What the hell am I?  Chopped Liver?  You believe the guy is me but the girls aren't my sisters?<br>
What if the guy was a fake and the girls were real?<br>
<br>
Anyways... my point was lost due to my inept ability at sinking to the level of Samadhi.<br>
<br>
Oh and Fitz...  I'll get ya some pics bro.<br>
