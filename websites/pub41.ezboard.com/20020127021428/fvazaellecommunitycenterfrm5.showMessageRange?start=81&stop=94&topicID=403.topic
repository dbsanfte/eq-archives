<br>
You say you feel for those affected by the attack, and that you are sad.  Yet, you obviously cannot forgive people who are literally at the point of snapping because of this.  I went 6 hours trying to figure out if my sister was near the WTC when this happened, because she lives in NYC.  I think I used up my cell phone minutes this month hearing &quot;All circuits are currently busy&quot;.  Whoever did this, I am more angry at than I can express.  Now, whether I deal with this quietly, and do what I can to help those affected, or if I break down and call for the total extermination of the Middle East is my perogative.  Honestly, I understand the attitude of the people who are like that.  They know that the attackers came from the Middle East, and they just want whoever and whatever responsible or involved in *any* terrorist acts dead and destroyed.  The easiest way to do this ofcourse is to remove the Middle East from the map.  But, once the blind anger is gone and over with, I believe they will calm down and realize that ofcourse, is irrational.  However, try and think what they have been through, chances are, it is horribly worse than what you went through.  Maybe you can understand their viewpoint.  <br>
<br>
As for the attitude of people who think that the USA is bigger, stronger or whatever than anyone else, is kind of interesting.  I definitely want retaliation, but I don't know where.  It is infinitely infuriating to have the power to wipe out literally the entire world, yet you cannot even keep 20 some people from killing thousands.  What do you do?  How do you protect yourself, when you already have such vast amounts of power, yet you cannot prevent such a horrible act from so few?  I think this is the basis of the attitude of &quot;fuck it, kill them all&quot; because of the sheer inability to pinpoint the people responsible.  You want this type of act to stop, and since you can't pinpoint their exact location, you just destroy anywhere they could be.  Obviously, this road will horrify many people, including many Americans, and will not be taken.  But, I do understand the attitude.<br>
<br>
&quot;What pisses me off, is that many of you, got the notion that somehow, USA has been wronged, that you are the saints, and everyone else is the devil, or just a mortal, who wants a bite out of your power.  Newsflash: USA HAS commited many atrocities and did many things wrong, so please, dont play it like you've never did a thing wrong, and these bombings just happened out of the blue, w/o any provocation. &quot;<br>
<br>
This is wrong.  Totally, wrong.  The people who died, have been wronged.  Their families have been wronged.  The friends of those families and those who died have been wronged.  The people who watched people burn alive, jump off 110 story buildings, have been wronged.  The people of the United States have been wronged, the people of the world have been wronged.  Deagol, people across the world have been placing hand written notes expressing their sorrows at Embassies and churches across the world.  Obviously, they understand that the people who have been most wronged by this, were wholly innocent.  You apparently, want to change this attack on utterly innocent people, on the actions and politics of a nation that they happened to belong to.  This isn't about nations, or politics.  This is about the deaths of thousands of innocent people from MANY different countries.  A few hundred British people were in the WTC when it was attacked.  Most probably, some of them died.  A few hundred people of Asian decent were in the WTC when it was attacked.  Most probably, some of them died.  The fact that you want to associate those deaths with the acts of a government is wrong.  Most probably, 99% of thepeople who died did not wrong other nations, or in any way wrong the terrorists who did this.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, bombing WTC was an extremly vile act, and those who were behind it, SHOULD BE brought to justice and prosecuted. They should suffer for the crimes they commited against american people, yes. All i ask is to keep in mind, that a military act against USA was not uncalled for. I wish however that instead of blowing up WTC, whoever did this, had picked another way of assaulting USA. They should have attacked military installations, not civilian buildings.<br>
Bombing of Pentagon was more justified (seeing as it is the military HQ and all).&quot; <br>
<br>
 When people blew up the boat in Yemen, you did not see such an outcry.  However, when such an act is committed on innocents, I am sorry.  I will not forgive them.  I want them to pay.  I am not willing to let this go.  I don't care how long this takes, I want them brought to justice.  And not in a fucking islamic court in Afghanistan like the Talibans want if it is Osama bin Laden.  Trying to say that we should let this slide, because our military may have acted irresponsibly or against our morals is wrong.  This has nothing to do with what our military did.  If it did, they would have attacked our military, not innocent civilians.<br>
<br>
&quot;AMERICAN GOVERNMENT IS AS MUCH GUILTY OF CERTAIN POLITICS THAT HAVE CAUSED SUCH A RETALIATORY REACTION AS THE TERRORISTS THAT HAVE EXPLODED PLANES&quot;<br>
<br>
How can you say this?  Again, if military bases were blown up, I could see the Government and Military's actions being held responsible.  But there was absolutely no reason for the attack on the WTC.  If you are angry at the government, take it out on the government.  Not on innocent civilians.<br>
<br>
There, clear enough?<br>
<br>
My personal views are that we need to coolly, search out for those responsible, and bring them to justice.  If Osama is responsible, ask the Taliban to extricate him, and show the evidence.  If they refuse, remove him forcibly, and remove those who protect him.  If that means the government, so be it.  Same goes for all involved.  Ask for them to be turned over, if they refuse, go get them. <br>
<br>
Afganistan and the Taliban have already started looking pretty guilty.  They are already calling for a &quot;Jihad&quot; and are threatening any neighboring country that helps the USA at all.  This certainly does not sound like the &quot;peace loving&quot; government that they advertised in earlier press releases. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usoulreeverx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SoulreeverX</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/15/01 8:02:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=403.topic&index=82>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://faceweb-004.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/34/2051734.gif?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ryonea is a piece of shit</span><hr size=1> /cheer Silver <br>

<br>
This persecution of Arab-Americans is utter bullshit.  This really disgusts me.  Whoever I find doing this, I will seriously kick the shit out of.  You are pissed because someone attacked thousands of innocents.  Yet you yourself are attacking an innocent.  I don't care how angry you are, this shit has to stop.  <br>
<br>
I felt real pride when I saw how our fellow Americans were handling this situation initially.  I can even somewhat understand the blind anger directed at the middle east, even though I don't agree with it.  But this is making me embarrassed to call myself an American.  Please don't get my comments wrong above that I condone or understand people persecuting Arab-Americans.  It is one thing to voice your anger on a chat board, it is quite another to take action on not only another innocent person, but a fellow American who is going through whatever you are, and worse because of people like you.<br>
<br>
Everytime I hear reports of people doing this crap I get really pissed off... God save a person who I find doing this, because I certainly won't. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usilvirthewizard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Silvir the Wizard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 106<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/16/01 2:39:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=403.topic&index=84>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ryonea is a piece of shit</span><hr size=1> .. freakin no editing rant boards.. =/  You = general person, not anyone in this rant =)  (sorry for the late posts, been doin a little booze booze =p) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=saalron>Saalron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/19/01 1:06:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=403.topic&index=85>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> entertainment</span><hr size=1> EC has maybe 20 Ryonea cadavers sprinkled around if any of the lynch mob wanted to come dance on them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubinklesmcstinkles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Binkles McStinkles</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/19/01 6:43:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=403.topic&index=86>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mnpwh01.mw.mediaone.net/mdwilliamson/images/sig.jpg height=153 width=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ryonea is a piece of shit</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mnpwh01.mw.mediaone.net/mdwilliamson/images/Ryonea.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
