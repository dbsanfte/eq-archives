A few quotes...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
The offices of Santa Rosa Junior College's student newspaper were locked temporarily following death threats against the editor for a piece she published criticizing Israel. The piece in the biweekly Oak Leaf appeared six weeks ago. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Remember, this is a 19 year old student, writing in a student newspaper.  Nothing he writes is theory, its fact.<br>
<br>
Also try to recall the Jewish guy that got caught for trying to blow up a mosque in florida?  He wasn't tried as a terrorist under the patriot act, but was given all the constitutional rights...clear racism IMO.<br>
<br>
It's very difficult nowadays to criticize the Israeli government without dozens of organizations/people coming out to call you an anti-semite/jew hater because of the Holocaust sympathy and media coverage.<br>
<br>
The best quote IMO?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
 American funding of Jewish genocide is not only felt by Arabs in the Middle East. On September 11, 2001 our nation was targeted by Arab terrorists not because they 'hate our freedoms', but because we are supplying the bullets that kill their children. Not only are we forced to pay a serious amount of money to fund the Jewish holy war which benefits America in no way, but American lives are also being sacrificed in service to Israel. Our national 'leaders' say nothing, do nothing, and deny the facts. Israel is the most powerful and dangerous terrorist organization in the world and they have hi-jacked America. Our spineless national 'leaders' refuse to even discuss the Israel issue because the Israeli-American lobby in Washington DC, funded by Zionist Jews, is the most powerful lobby in existence, wielding even more power than the NRA. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

That one statement there makes it too biased to be taken as complete fact.  What you consider to be the truth (or fact) is simply that way because that's the way you see it based on what you've heard (or decided to hear).  The earth is round, fire is hot... These are facts that can't be disputed.  Are the Israelis right?  Or the Palestinians?  All depends on which side of the fence your standing. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=168276">Linale Kinderhearte</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
1. They currently occupy Israel but are constantly trying to expand their borders with their superior military power over their Arab neighbors. <br>
<br>
Pure Conjecture.  Assuming Israeli's really wanted to take a ton more territory, they would easily roll over Jordan and Syria most likely in a 24 hour period.<br>
<br>
2.  No fewer than 2,265 Palestinians have been murdered by the Israelis in the last three years since September 28, 2000. <br>
<br>
Sources?  Or are we to assume that the Israeli's just lined up a good 2,265 people who were doing nothing and shot them because it was Good Friday.<br>
<br>
3. but they also have over 300 known nuclear bombs.<br>
<br>
Sources?  I must have missed the report in which Israel even admitted to having nuclear weapons much less allowing someone to come in and count them.<br>
<br>
4. Without the heavy US aid to Israel that they are currently receiving Israel would no longer be able to continue its program of genocide. <br>
<br>
Pure Conjecture.  I don't feel the author is even remotely qualified to say what Israel may or may not do without US support and certainly don't think he's showed any source who would be able to determine Israeli response.<br>
<br>
5. American funding of Jewish genocide<br>
<br>
There are numerous statements in the article, much to this effect.  To be quite honest, if they Israeli's were intent on committing genocide, they surely suck at it.  You'd think of all people they'd have experience on how to accurately commit genocide if they decided it was in their best interests.  These statements are merely inflammatory and designed to bias the reader towards the author's viewpoint.<br>
<br>
Basically this article is crap, cobbled together with some facts and then various vague assumptions and conclusions are drawn from them.  As with many one-sided articles, the author makes the Palestinians out to be angelic, whereas the evil Jews are taking over etc..  The truth in my eyes is that the situation is quite ugly on both sides and there is no side in the &quot;right&quot; in my opinion.<br>

We live in a free country, we have freedom of the press, if he wants to publish such an editorial he should be free to express his views.<br>
<br>
Second, I think they are racist, inflammatory, and without basis in fact (see Ayiar's post).  Sure there are some facts listed, but conclusions drawn from them take huge leaps and are not really supported, and there is quite a bit of conjecture, supposition, and inflammatory rhetoric thrown in.<br>
<br>
I also find your &quot;face it we have a lot of zionists in our government or in other positions of power&quot; theory to be extremely racist and crazy even for you.<br>
<br>
How exactly do you define zionist btw Herder?  If you mean someone who supports the existence of a Jewish state, I think probably 90 percent of the American population, or more, is Zionist.  People however use Zionism to mean that Jews are somehow trying to take over the world or other crackpot theories, it's just part of the anti-semitism the Jews have endured for milennia.<br>
<br>
From Dictionary.com:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>A Jewish movement that arose in the late 19th century in response to growing anti-Semitism and sought to reestablish a Jewish homeland in Palestine.

There are two existing factors that offer success to United States persuasion. One is the legal requirement that American weapons are to be used by Israel only for defensive purposes, a premise certainly being violated in the recent destruction of Jenin and other villages. Richard Nixon imposed this requirement to stop Ariel Sharon and Israel's military advance into Egypt in the 1973 war, and I used the same demand to deter Israeli attacks on Lebanon in 1979. (A full invasion was launched by Ariel Sharon after I left office). The other persuasive factor is approximately $10 million daily in American aid to Israel. President George Bush Sr. threatened this assistance in 1992 to prevent the building of Israeli settlements between Jerusalem and Bethlehem.<br>

Israelis were at one time, terrorists, just like their Palestinian brothers.  <br>
<br>
I rebutted your earlier points but somehow lost the post...I will summarize.<br>
<br>
1. Two Words----Illegal Settlements.  Its not conjecture, its fact.  Why the hell do you think they are having such a hard time with the peace process?  Israel is refusing to remove settlements on palestinian land.<br>
2.  Try google, its easy even for you Ayiar!  <br>

<br>
3. Please, who denies that Israel has the bomb?  Hell, Israel spied more on us during the cold war than Russia.<br>
<br>
4. Right, 10 million dollars a day and &quot;gifts&quot; of military equipment isn't helping them fund their apartheid state?  Far from pure conjecture.<br>
<br>
5. If you pay taxes, you help fund Israel.  Killing due to race is called genocide.  <br>
<br>
def.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Article II of the 1948 U.N. Convention on Genocide states the following<br>
:<br>
&quot;In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts<br>
committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national,<br>
ethnical, racial or religious group as such:<br>
(a) killing members of the group;<br>
(b) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;<br>
(c) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated<br>
to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;<br>
(d) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;<br>
(e) forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.<br>
