If it was Clinton in the office I'm 100% sure the tables would be turned.<br>
<br>
The most ironic part of this is that people who follow the Republican party obviously don't know their history very well.  Nobody remembers the Sedition Acts of the late 18th century that threw huge amounts of Republicans in jail and cost them horrible fines until they finally managed to get it thrown away.  <br>
<br>
Here's a good link I found so you can learn some history:<br>

  Where is your quote from, this is from the AP Wire.  I don't see anything in here where he's charge with, &quot;threatening the President's safety&quot;<br>
<br>
  He wasn't there because he had access to the proceedings, he was there because he was protesting.  There was an area setup and authorized like for a specific area, but he didn't wanna go there.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=204898">Ayiar Frullaniaceae</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Here's a quote from Assistant U.S. Attorney John Barton, linked by JohnAshcroft.newstrove.com  <br>
<br>
&quot;Particularly since 9/11, we think the Secret Service's ability to enforce the security around the president is of extreme importance, and we intend to support that effort,&quot; Barton said in a brief telephone interview with The Observer.<br>

If you don't think amending a law regarding assassination, kidnapping, and assault to include peaceful demonstration in a cordoned off area (which they didn't arrest anyone else that was in this area of), is extreme, then I don't know what to say to you.  If others would have been arrested I'd have no problem with this at all.<br>

Sometimes it takes 4 months for the government to do my tax return.  I try not to assume they have some massive ulterior motive regarding it.  If I had to guess they were deciding if they wanted to make an example of the guy.<br>
<br>
  Your &quot;quote&quot; is just the writers opinion or as far as I can guess possibly a statement by this fellow that was paraphrased, but even that's not real clear from the article.  I'm just gonna take a wild guess that neither knows the indictment or more likely have put their own spin on it, since usually the Attorney General who's charging you with the crime is probably gonna know said crime.<br>

I don't want for the government to wait for the president to take a bullet before taking any action, I'd rather have them take reasonable preventative measures to maintain the president's safety, and I don't see how setting up a small zone around the president in which the general public is not allowed is such a big deal.<br>

And I completely agree with Mr. Banderas on the point that had this been Clinton, there would be a huge uproar over it by the Republicans.  Alas, we are in a new era of gestapo like tactics and an erosion of personal rights.

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Mr. Bursey reports he was told that if he wanted to protest the President, he would have to go to the designated protest site half a mile away near a highway and outside the sight and hearing of the President. “It’s the content of your sign,” officials said.<br>
<br>
In the letter to Ashcroft released today, the Members of Congress called the prosecution of Mr. Bursey for carrying his sign outside the designated free speech zone “a threat to the freedom of expression we should all be defending”: <br>
<br>
“As we read the First Amendment to the Constitution, the United States is a ‘free speech zone’. In the United States, free speech is the rule, not the exception, and citizens’ rights to express it do not depend on their doing it in a way the President finds politically amenable . . . . We ask that you make it clear that we have no interest as a government in “zoning” Constitutional freedoms, and that being politically annoying to the President of the United States is not a criminal offense. This prosecution smacks of the use of the Sedition Acts two hundred years ago to protect the President from political discomfort. It was wrong then and it is wrong now. We urge you to drop this prosecution based so clearly on the political views being expressed by the individual who is being prosecuted.”<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I am of the firm belief that no one felt the President's life was endangered.  The only thing they were protecting the President from was dissent and messages that were in opposition to him.  I believe that there shouldn't be a &quot;free speech zone&quot;, which is really just a bullshit tactic to keep protestors from being seen nor heard.  If they allow pro-Bush people to be near the President, they should allow anti-Bush as well.  Freedom of Speech wasn't drawn up with biases, separating which types of speech should be zoned or not. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1269<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/28/03 11:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=115.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Freedom of Speech Ammendment soon to Expire</span><hr size=1> If it turns out that he was in a crowd of people, all in the same area, but was the only one with an anti-Bush message, and he was arrested, then I don't think that's right.<br>

I'm still undecided on this until I can get more detailed information and hear the government's side of the story as well.<br>

<br>
&quot;In the letter to Ashcroft released today, the Members of Congress called the prosecution of Mr. Bursey for carrying his sign outside the designated free speech zone “a threat to the freedom of expression we should all be defending”:&quot;<br>
<br>
...the members of Congress mentioned in that article were 10 or 11 Democrats versus 1 Republican.  Of course, had this been a situation that occured 5 years ago, it probably would have been all Republicans except for 1 Democrat.  <br>
<br>
As Ammelen seems to be eluding to, I also could care less what party this is.  If you're going to claim you're protecting the President's safety, and that a zone is not supposed to be occupied by anyone, you shouldn't be singling out one person who you just happens to be a longtime anti-war protester to be accused of violating the law while the others can get away just fine.<br>
<br>
This law has been used 12 times since 1992 according to an article I read, and 9 or 10 of those were later thrown out.  So on average, it's been used 1 time per year in that time period, which is almost not at all, and this time it's used only on an anti-war protester and everyone else is just fine.<br>

second and most important, the man was singled out becuase of a sign of dissent, protester? where did we get that from? supporters? wtf all these folks are the same, they are voicing thier opinion, wether it be yeay or nay, to remove civilians who disagree and let those stay who agree with your politics is wrong. In a public place you should have the right to do what eveyone else is doing, voicing or showing a opinion. We should remove the word supporters and protesters from this and just call them people with opinions. as long as your voicing your opinion in a legal manner what the fuck is the difference what your message is?<br>
