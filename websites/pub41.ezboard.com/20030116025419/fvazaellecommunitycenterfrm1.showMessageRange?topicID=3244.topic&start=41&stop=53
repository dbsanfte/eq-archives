<br>
It seems that you fail to comprehend the magnitude of what actually happened.  Those three thousand people did not die over a period of months.  This was not a series of suicide bombings over a period of weeks or even days.  Those people died as a result of an attack on *one* day.  <br>
<br>
Comparing what happened on September 11, 2001 in the United States to what happens on a daily basis in the Middle East and elsewhere is incredibly insensitive.  It's like saying the holocaust was no big deal in the grand scheme of things because so very many people have died in various wars throughout history.<br>
<br>
This is about one event, on one day, to a people who believed something like this would never ever happen.  Try to respect that notion, and not belittle what happened.  This thread is not the place for these types of opinions.  Please take them to another thread, preferably in rants and flames.<br>

Somewhere over Ohio the plane started turning around.  I noticed but really thought nothing of it as I played virtual pool on my laptop.  The captain came on and said that there were some problems in Newark and that we would be relanding in the Twin Cities.  There was a tropical storm off the coast so I figured it was weather related, &quot;oh well will catch a later flight&quot; I thought to myself.  The plane turned again, the captain came on, &quot;we are going to be stopping in Milawaukee for some fuel and then we'll be on our way&quot;.  This seemed strange.  Still didn't think too much of it however.<br>
<br>
A chatter had arose on the plane.  Apparently a guy in the back had used the airphone to call ahead and say that he was going to miss his meeting at the WTC. The flight attendant told us that one of the towers had been struck by a plane.  I was like &quot;no way, that can't be right&quot;.  We were then in the pattern in Milwaukee for 30 minutes as all the planes were landing.  As we landed the captain came on and said the airport is being evacuated, please move quickly through.  Sure enough when we walked up the ramp the airport was like a ghost town.<br>
<br>
Stranded in Milwaukee.  Called my loved ones to let them know I was ok.  Went to the Amtrak station and got a ticket for the next train back to the twin cities.  It wasn't scheduled to leave for 3 hours.  Walked with my bags about a mile and a half in downtown Milwaukee to the Hooters.  I sat there, with everyone else there, in silience, watching the images on the big screen.<br>
<br>
I spent 7 hours on the train back to the twin cities trying to let it all sink in.  It didn't for several days.<br>
<br>
Shock, Denail, Sorrow, Anger.<br>
<br>
That day is permanently etched in my brain in vivid detail.  Those that were lost will never be forgotten by me.<br>
<br>
I am thankful to be among the living. <p><hr>

  Telling him to burn in hell doesn't help, he's been raised to believe we are the big, bad Infidel and we must all be destroyed.  He's never lived here and seen how incredibly charitable Americans actually are(statistically we are the most giving country in the world), he's never experienced the comradery we share with each other based strictly on our shared land.  The out pouring of love that we felt after the towers fell, instead of the terror that was meant to be instilled into our hearts, angers him and his countrymen to no end.  <br>
  Pity him, do not wish upon him what they wish upon us, that would lower us to their standards.<br>

Those words you posted there if from the heart and not in error probably have damned you for all eternity.<br>

I myself will add you to my prayer list and hope that someday you do not have to answer to whatever god you believe in for it. (If any and I cannot see how you can believe in any devine being and make that statement)<br>
