<br>
its true that after server down (our prime time) CC have a good chance to take them down, but after that its kinda free for all..<br>
<br>
The day before we was meeting in ST, was named golems and warders up as far I know (even the night before in PO prime time) so really no idea to enter a zone just before a CC raid, beside starting a race imo...<br>
<br>
btw. Maybe I got wrong info then I am sorry.. I just hope that this 2 guilds each in dif. timezones somehow can work this out.<br>

<br>
Yes, we planned that raid early in the morning because we knew it was the only way would get a shot at the warders and yes (for those keeping score) we lost the fight anyway.  To the best of MY knowledge the warders are on a 7 day spawn.  Since CC had killed them the previous friday, we made plans to be in ST before CC the following friday.<br>
<br>
Once again... I have proposed a rotation system to Baldrik, he has rejected it.  I prefer that to a pure free for all but I can live with it either way.  I don't want to adjust my real life just to race to a spawn and I'm sure you feel the same way.  That said, I do want to kill some Warders and if CC won't agree to a rotation, we'll keep getting up early and taking our shot.  If you, like me, would rather work out a rotation so we don't inconvenience each other, talk to Baldrik about it.  Flaming us for following the rules set by your guild isn't going to help.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uhasuuuu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hasuuuu</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.vazaelle.dk/menybild.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/20/01 10:33:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=577.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ST warders</span><hr size=1> Unlike many others I've had the same point of view on spawns and such since I made my char on Vaz, I even had this view on my old server.<br>
<br>
I dont like to rotate or scheduale spawns. It takes the last few pieces of 'roleplay' and competition out of the game. It becomes farming. I support FFA now, I supported it when Keadaian told me I was a moron cause CC was in Plane of Hate and PO had it on the calender. I wanted FFA, I never posted anything on the calender, I never used the calender. (or hacked it for that matter *cough* Vaclav)<br>
<br>
When dealing with me you should understand that Everquest is a game to me. Nothing more, nothing less. I have a full time job, I have friends, I play basketball and more. When I dont do anything else, I play Everquest. I get home at 5pm GMT and play untill 1am or so. That should leave plenty of time for the rest of the server to kill what they want.<br>
<br>
CC under my leadership is very different from PO at the moment. We log on, we play, we log off. Thats it. Its not that complicated. We dont get up at 5am to try some mob, we dont have a phone chain should something important spawn and we generally keep to ourself. We enjoy eachothers company and we have fun. We fool around and we take the challenges we come across.<br>
<br>
When EQ becomes a fustration and a job its time to quit. The best you can take with you from this game comes from friendship. Everything else might give you some $$ on ebay but its nothing compared to a job. When you post on safehouse to get some moral values, oppinions or statements you can take back to your own server....Stop playing. At this point Verant won long ago.<br>
<br>
Dont know why I wrote so much. Bored at work I guess. What I want to say is, if people have bring politics into everything when they talk to me, dont even bother. I have limited time online and prefer to use it on cheerful matters and people I like. <br>
<br>
So now you know where I stand at least~<br>

<br>
The few races we had to spawns with IV were stressful, but also a huge amount of fun, especially when we won. I'm glad we now have 'rivals' again, to keep us on our toes. <br>
<br>
My memory of the Kland fight and race leading up to it with PO, was one of admiration in /gui for having the balls to pull from under our noses, and then the race to rebuff after our first failure, and the uncertainty of whether you would succeed on your 2nd attempt.<br>
<br>
Knowing exactly what you're going to kill days, sometimes weeks beforehand, seems to me, boring beyond words. It may not be RP, but it's as close as you'll get on this or almost any other server.<br>

It was fun and a big let down for us at the end, as I'm sure it was fun and a big thrill for you guys.  Most races are like that, exciting as hell while you're in it, and either a thrill to win or a let down to lose.   Racing to Klandicar isn't gonna make people overly upset with each other unless someone does something incredibly gimp... racing to the Warders tends to raise the stakes significantly.  It's like the difference between playing poker for chump change and playing for real money... both can be fun, one just hurts more to lose.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is that PO isn't gonna go out of our way to interfere w/ CC's plans for the sole purpose of interfering with them.  We'd prefer to rotate the warders so neither guild feels pressured to alter RL schedules but that's not going to happen.  Given our druthers, we'd hit the warders in our prime time and if we get a shot to do that we will... in the mean time, we want 'em as badly as you do and so we'll get up early in the morning from time to time if we have to.  Of course, all this is academic since we haven't shown the ability to kill one yet.  As it applies to north wing... we coexisted there quite comfortably this last weekend and I see no reason that can't continue.  We seem to be able to take down roughly the same mob, though we haven't had a shot yet at a few since you were ahead of us.  We both seem to be stuck on Zlex (or did you guys get him yesterday?)  At some point, when both guilds are able to clear the zone, we may want to revisit this issue, but that'll be up to Baldrik and the other officers to decide.  For now, FFA is working fine.<br>
<br>
Just to clarify so that we're all on the same page.. is CC's position one shot then fair game?  Ie... if PO wipes, CC will  move in, and CC won't mind if we do the same?  Not trying to provoke a flame, just trying to lay down the groundwork to prevent misunderstandings and increased tension. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ujoesfamoushotdogs.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Joesfamoushotdogs</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/21/01 7:06:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=577.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ST warders</span><hr size=1> Kead as an officer of CC, I'd say yes. If we die, it's there for the taking imho. Obvisouly practical things like CR have to be taken into account, but this is generally a simple matter. <br>
<br>
Depending on what mob it is, we'll give another guild more than one chance, if it doesnt interfere with our agenda (FA for example), but RL time aspects, rarity of the spawn will also affect our decisions. I have no problem with literally walking over corpses to get to a mob. <br>
<br>
We would never attack a mob with less than full HP, but this is hardly a problem with SoV mobs.<br>
