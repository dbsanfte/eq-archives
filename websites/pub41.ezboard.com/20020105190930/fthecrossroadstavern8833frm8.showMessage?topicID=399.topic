Past the part about the hackers, they say he learned about EQ2, which is to be released in 2002.<br>
<br>
So, we buy SoL in Christmas, then get to buy a new game in the next year?<br>

<br>
If so I wouldn't bet on it being out until at least the end of 2002. That's assuming SoL does rather well, which it will. There's no reason to hurt the sales of an already popular game.<br>
<br>
In fact, seeing as there's been little to no information about EQ2, I would be surprised if it was in the first three quarters of 2002. <br>
<br>
Let's see, SoL will have at least 6 months of steam behind it by the time it comes out. I would expect even more for EQ2. Look at how much press Star Wars: Galaxies already has.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if EQ2 waited until early 2003. <br>
<br>
I think other MMORPG's will be a big factor. If DAoC, AO, AC2, Shadowsbane, Horizon's etc., erode EQ's customer base enough, you can bet a media blitz will come early next quarter when SoL sales have begun to plateau.<br>
<br>
However, if these falter like AO has, there will be no reason to push EQ2 just yet.<br>
<br>

Game has great promise but they hardly anything to show for it. They keep pushing off their beta have hardly no screen shots posted of the game. They also have been losing people to either being fired or just quiting.<br>
<br>
AC2? heh If thats like AC1 its not going to do much to hurt anyones numbers. I bought AC1 played it for 20 minutes than said screw this and took it back. Theres really not much to say other than AC sucks and i hope AC2 isnt anything like the first.<br>
<br>
Shadowbane isnt gonna hurt anyone much either at this point their as much vaporwear as Horizons is after scraping their engine after E3 and starting over. Its also majorly based around PvP as you can take citys from other guilds. It will probably take alot of the players off the Zeks if the game is actualy any good.<br>
<br>
I think Camelot is going to hurt EQ a little bit only because I've played it. Its a good game its very simular to EQ in a lot of different things. Its also got some better points but falls short in alot of things as well. Its also PvP and some of their ideas on it are fairly interesting. I will say I'll buy this game forsure its fun and a good escape from EQ when you cant find a group.<br>
<br>
You also cant really say EQ is going to lose players to these games as no one has really played them or even seen what some of them look like yet. A good number of these new games have PvP tied into them. Theres a market for it but all and all not many people are really big into PvP. You can see this just by looking at the Zeks Numbers in Prime time compaired to the blue servers.<br>
<br>
Now EQ2 if its anything like EQ it should be a great game and just as addictive. Im sure people gonna say I wont play another game by Verant. My question is why not? They made a great games sure they do stuff that not all of us like but its for better the game as a whole. Its also got some problems as well (camping, quests rewards arent as good as drops, and others) but the game still rocks. Sure they screw up at times on different things but everyones human look at what other game companys do. Diablo 2 for example was pushed back almost 2 years.During that time it killed so many games because no one wanted to buy anything due to it being said to come out in one month then only to have the date moved back. AC says their not going to do anything about a exploit someone uses a exploit to make tons of cash they roll back the servers. Those are just two expamles.<br>
<br>
EQ CS? I've both good and bad experinces with their CS but i've rarely needed them in 2 years of playing. If your having more than just a few run ins with CS you probably should start looking at yourself and asking why. Also in all honesty their CS shouldnt be a factor if you play a game or not AC and UO dont offer anything remotely close to that of Sony. Heck ww2 online and diablo only give you tech support after that your on your own. <br>
<br>
EQ2 if and when it ever comes out should do fairly well. Alot of people say Sony should be afraid of the other games. Those people are right... But on the other hand those other games should be very afraid of sony when they make a sequal to EQ as they have already proved they can make a game work.<br>
<br>
&lt;steps off his soap box&gt; And thats all i have to say about that.<br>

Eq can only be expanded so much, and even though expansions add to the game, there are a lot of problems that can only be corrected by a completely new engine etc.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'm really enjoying EQ, but with Morrowind and Might and Magic 9 coming out (Not to mention PoR2 and Neverwinter Nights) EQ will take  a backseat for a while.<br>
<br>
So the question is why won't Verant stick with EQ since it's making a ton. Well, the ngine is pretty dated, and even with the graphics overhaul on the way, a lot of other games are offering great qualities like seemless worlds and even more interactivity.<br>
<br>
EQ2 will have the advantage of grabbing most of the current EQ market as well as bringing in a lot of the older players who left out of boredom and frustration. Better graphics and revamped gameplay will also grab players from the MMORPGs coming out soon. <br>
<br>
That makes for a ton of bucks.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3F3F25><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bthecrossroadstavern8833.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dloc>dloc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#F4CC10>(9/13/01 5:12:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: EQ 2 due for 2002?</span><hr size=1> Sad rumor i heard was that all EQ really is, is a beta for EQ2. VI wanted to test shit out with EQ and that all the bugs and problems they have with EQ they will fix and due right with EQ2.Dunno if rumor is true but it sounds real with the fact that CS sux and bugs are plenty and not being fixed as fast as they shuld.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bthecrossroadstavern8833.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dloc>dloc</A> at: 9/13/01 6:13:07 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#564E39><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ujakula.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jakula</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#F4CC10>(9/13/01 6:39:22 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: EQ 2 due for 2002?</span><hr size=1> Look at how UO2 ended up ..

The current EQ team is busy working on SoL and maintaining the current systems and networks involved.<br>
<br>
Even if they have been toying around with building a new EQ for the past year, the amount of manpower that they would have had aviailable to do so would be negligable, resulting in very little actual progress on the game.  2003 and possibly 2004 would be the release date on a full blown sequel to EQ.  That is unless they decide to simply recycle the engine/graphics, in which case it wont really be EQ2 and they might as well spend more resources on making another expansion.<br>
<br>
Information obtained from Brad's laptop is hardly anything to base such a rumor around.  I am certain that there is talk about an Everquest sequel in the works.  Every successful game is typically followed by discussions about a sequel.<br>

You are making the mistake of assuming the other guy thinks like you do and has logical (to you) motives.  VI has proven they can royally screw the pooch many times already.<br>

AC was cool, just after a year I needed a change, so I came to EQ :P<br>
<br>
From talking with some of the devs, the hints they drop anyways(damn NDAs), they're definitely learning from their mistakes with AC, which is a good thing.  There is no world that is more immersive than Dereth.  Being able to stand on top of a mountain, and look across the valleys below is something no other game has done really yet.  Not to mention the fact that Zoning just completely breaks any immersiveness you might get :P<br>
<br>
Plus the shots of AC2 that have been released and the video from E3 is just amazing.<br>
<br>
DAoC I've been trying off and on in beta, but hasn't pulled me from EQ yet, still plenty left for me to do here :P<br>
<br>
So I'll probably get SoL instead of DAoC, even though DAoC is probably the better game.  I just want to do everything I can in EQ first :P <p><table border="1" width="100%">
