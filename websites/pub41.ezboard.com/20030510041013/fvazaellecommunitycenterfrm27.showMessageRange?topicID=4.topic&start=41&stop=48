<br>
&quot;Begin.&quot;<br>
<br>
The door has disappeared behind them as they had entered the room, gone, as if it had never existed, leaving them sealed in a large empty stone courtroom devoid of exits. At one side of the room stood the Prime Executioner, another black robed phantom similiar to the Tribunal, but rather than a giant hammer in his hand, he carried a wicked looking axe. At the other end of the room knelt a rather desperate looking young man with his hands bound behind his back, in front of a stump apparently used, by the dried blood caked on its top, as a chopping block. The Prime Executionar stood silent.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kill him!&quot; Vven shrieked, pointing at the executioner.<br>
<br>
&quot;No no.&quot; Verdad said, eyes darting around the room for other movement. &quot;I'm personally responsible for half the murderers in Norrath being free. We save big, tall, and gruesome for the end. We don't touch him till we piss him off.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You better go over procedure for the virgins.&quot; Whizbang suggested, turning in a small circle in the middle of the room....watching...waiting.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright boys and girls, this is how we do it.&quot; Verdad said, rolling up the sleeves on his robe. &quot;River, Ramluk, the first part of this you're just going to watch magic at its most destructive. Get to the sides and let us work. Vven you're going to chain area stun...anything that's moving around us I want locked down. Whiz and I are going to lay out area blasts on two levels, Whiz cutting them off at the knees and me at the throat. Pedi, your job is to keep us all alive through the procedure, anything resists the stun and we're going to resemble bloody dishrags. Ram, Riv, if you need to do anything during that time, if you see a mob outside of Vven's stun area, knock it back in. Ram will have his moment when all the Prime's henchmen are dead. And remember to conserve mana. It's...rather intense.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Anything else?&quot; River asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye.&quot; Verdad added. &quot;Look good, and remember to smile. You never know who's watching.&quot;<br>
<br>
And then, with a sudden burst of movement, four creatures appeared in the room.<br>
<br>
The henchmen of the Prime Executioner weren't men at all. Rather, there were two types, two of each. One type looked like a humanoid form made entirely of large rocks somehow held together. The other was roughly humanoid in shape, but all resemblence ended there, with sharp spines lining its back and razor sharp edges sprouting from every angle of its body. The Prime Executioner started walking slowly toward the prisoner. And the four henchmen jumped towards Pedi.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here we go!&quot; Verdad cried, hands lighting with red fire. Whizbang's hands similarily started to glow.<br>
<br>
Vven began chanting, blue pulsing light pushing out from his body in a visible wave. Three of the creatures were struck by it, repeatedly. They froze in place, vibrating slowly as they were assaulted by wave after wave of force.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ogga!&quot; Ramluk said, kicking the fourth in the rear so it entered the radius of Vven's stuns. Now all four were locked.<br>
<br>
Still the Prime Executioner marched toward the prisoner, to the side, axe gleaming in the torchlight.<br>
<br>
Whizbang and Verdad were turning in tight fast circles, hands building light. Suddenly with almost synchronized movement, their hands flew out, fire leaping forth with a loud boom. The creatures were engulfed in it, and the smell of burning flesh filled the room.<br>
<br>
They tried, between waves of stuns, to swipe at the two wizards, or the dark elf that was keeping them at bay. One connected solidly with Vven, pausing the stuns for a moment and tearing a nasty gash across the enchanter's arm. Vven almost lost momentum, looking shocked rather than hurt that he could bleed again after the time spent as a ghost. Pedi's eyes lit blue, and light darted from them to the wound. It began to mend, and Vven redoubled his efforts.<br>
<br>
The Prime Executioner had reaches the prisoner. <br>
<br>
&quot;Do you have anything further to say in your own defense?&quot; he asked the young man.<br>
<br>
BOOM. A final blast, and the four henchmen were dead.<br>
<br>
&quot;Excuse me.&quot; the Prime Executioner said to the prisoner. He crossed to the other side of the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;We kill him now??&quot; Vven asked, clearly drained from all the output of force. Pedi looked alright, and Verdad was grinning, looking fine. Whizbang seemed a bit tired. Magic had its price in power.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nope.&quot; Verdad said. &quot;He's still saying excuse me. He's not quite angry with us yet.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Prime Executioner waved his hand, and four more henchmen appeared.<br>
<br>
&quot;Second wave!&quot; Verdad said gleefully, beginning to spin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Second wave.&quot; Vven muttered, pulsing out his blue light as the Executioner began his walk towards the prisoner.<br>
<br>
Explosions and shockwaves permeated the room as the Executioner continued his walk. River and Ramluk sheilded their eyes from the light show that threatened to blind them as Whizbang and Verdad lit the room up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you have anything further to say in your own defense?&quot; the Prime Executioner asked the prisoner again.<br>
<br>
The prisoner bowed his head and said nothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;All gone!&quot; Verdad called out happily. &quot;Next!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;One moment.&quot; the Prime Executioner sighed to prisoner. The prisoner just looked annoyed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now! Now! Kill him now!&quot; Vven cried, poiting to the Prime Executioner.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nope!&quot; Verdad answered, hands glowing red. <br>
<br>
Wave three.<br>
<br>
Four more henchmen, another set of explosions. Whizbang looking much more weary, and Pedi with a thin sheen of sweat on her brow, as the henchmen, finding less stuns from Vven as he tired, found openings in their defense and landed more blows. Only Verdad seemed untaxed. And the Prime Executioner marched on.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you have anything further to say in your own defense?&quot; the Prime Executioner asked the prisoner a third time.<br>
<br>
The prisoner bowed his head and said nothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well, then.&quot; The Prime Executioner said, lifting his axe.<br>
<br>
BOOM.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not so fast, Chop Chop!&quot; Verdad said, as Whizbang slumped down in exhaustion and Vven stood there looking rather dazed.<br>
&quot;You see any bad guys? *I* don't see any bad guys.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sec sec.&quot; the Prime Executioner growled, with a look of apology to the prisoner.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh for the love of Karana, get on with it!&quot; the prisoner said with disgust.<br>
<br>
&quot;Final wave!&quot; Verdad cackled gleefully.<br>
<br>
And once more, the wizards began to spin.<br>
<br>
Light, fire, waves of cold. Four more henchmen, now landing shots every other attempt, Pedi healing each in the circle of force as fast as she could pray. And the Prime Executioner marched on.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you have anything further to say in your own defense?&quot; the Prime Executioner asked the prisoner pointlessly.<br>
<br>
The prisoner bowed his head and said nothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well, then.&quot; The Prime Executioner said, lifting his axe. The prisoner eagerly placed his head on the chopping block.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hurry!&quot; he urged the Executioner.<br>
<br>
&quot;Too late!&quot; Verdad cried, motioning to the four bodies of the latest batch of henchmen.<br>
<br>
&quot;ENOUGH!&quot; The Prime Executioner roared, and leapt at them, axe high.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ogga?&quot; Ramluk asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, now!&quot; Verdad replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;OGGA!&quot; Ramluk yelled, leaping in front of the Executioner, swords flashing.<br>
<br>
Axe met swords, and the final battle began.<br>

<br>
River drew Reaver and began an assault on the massive back of the executioner, while Ramluk parried, riposted, hacked, dodged each swing of the formidable axe with a grace that almost looked delicate. Ramluk was in his element, the art of war. It was an art that came as instinctively to him as breathing.<br>
<br>
River's swings, enough to cleave a normal man in half, vibrated off the back of the executioner as if his skin were stone. His arms ached as he chopped, wondering how Ramluk could keep up with this axe wielding machine.<br>
<br>
Throughout the fight, as axe would slip through the warrior's defenses and land, Pedi was healing, blue light pulsing from her as she spot healed each wound. Meanwhile, the two wizards were alternating casting a spell that landed like a concussion of force against the Prime Executioner, and then followed with blazing fire. The concussions were enough to keep him dazed enough not to notice they were slowly frying him to death. Wild magic filled the air.<br>
<br>
A slice, a jab, a parry with axe, and the Prime Executioners eyes burned red deep in his hood. Axe flew up and came down hard on Ramluk's shoulder, and Ramluk's armor reacted violently, shattering as if glass.<br>
<br>
&quot;Big Momma made me armors.&quot; Ramluk said sadly, cutting into the Prime Executioner.<br>
<br>
The executioner was weakening, but not quickly enough. Now with Ramluk's armor gone, the blows landed more cripplingly, and Pedi found herself healing larger and more deadly wounds.<br>
<br>
&quot;How much you got left?&quot; Verdad called to Whizbang, seeing the old gnome sweating with exertion next to him. Whizbang let out a final blast, and then slumped to the ground onto his knees. His face was white.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing.&quot; Whizbang panted. &quot;I don't have nothing.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't keep this up!&quot; Pedi cried, healing a gash in Ramluk's leg. Ramluk was being assaulted like a rabid dog with a child's doll. But still he fought back, keeping the executioner focused on him while River whittled away.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's it!&quot; Pedi cried, fixing Ramluk's broken ribs and dropping to the ground. &quot;I'm out. I can't keep up.&quot;<br>
<br>
Verdad just laughed and landed a huge bolt of light that knocked the Prime Executioner motionless. &quot;Alright, Ram, Riv! Back off! Now for the big finale!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ramluk and River backed off the stunned executioner, exhausted. Verdad's hands began to light like a star.<br>
<br>
&quot;And now, for my next trick...&quot; Verdad said, levelling his hands toward the executioner.<br>
<br>
Like a released spring, the executioner came out of his stun. With speed hard to follow, he brought up the butt of his axe, knocking Verdad's hands up. Verdad's magic unleashed into the ceiling.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not in the face!&quot; Verdad cried to the executioner. And then a chunk of stone, loosened from the ceiling being blasted, fell and struck him on the back of the head. Verdad swayed, fighting consciousness.<br>
<br>
The Prime Executioner turned to loom over Whizbang. The gnome didn't even have the strength to stand, just knelt there. At that moment, Whizbang looked very very old. The executioner swung up his axe. Whizbang watched without flinching.<br>
<br>
&quot;Take care of my girl, River.&quot; he said simply. The axe began to fall.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah hells!&quot; Vven muttered, waving a hand over his chest. A thin shimmer of runes etched onto the dark elf's skin. &quot;Life is over-rated anyway!&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven stepped between Whizbang and the executioner.<br>
<br>
The axe landed squarely between his eyes.<br>
<br>
The runes shimmered bright red and then disappeared, and Vven staggered under the blow. But for all its deadly intent the swing was stopped dead, and Vven otherwise unharmed. The executioner roared in Vven's face and swung up the axe again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here's a tip.&quot; Vven offered, closing his eyes. &quot;Buy some mints.&quot;<br>
<br>
--PULSE--<br>
<br>
Vven opened his eyes to find a robe with its hood blown off slumping to the ground, the axe hitting the floor with a loud clang. Riverdane's hands glowed black with the residue of the harmtouch that beheaded the executioner.<br>
<br>
Whizbang staggered to his feet, looking at Vven oddly. <br>
<br>
&quot;You...saved me.&quot; he said at last.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well...&quot; Vven said, looking a bit embarrassed. &quot;Yeah, I did.&quot; Their eyes met, and something, however temporary, passed between them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whiz, would you kiss him already so we can get out of here?&quot; Pedi snapped.<br>
<br>
Riverdane pulled Verdad to his feet. &quot;You alright Verd?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye.&quot; Verdad replied, nursing his wounded head. &quot;Wasn't in the face.&quot;<br>
<br>
A voice echoed in the trial room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vven Psyphon, you are free to go. Case dismissed.&quot; <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 266<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/1/03 10:02:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> Outside of the Plane of Justice, the six gathered in Tranquility at the base of a tree. Tranquility's mix of eternal sunrise/sunset lit the lightly clouded sky beautifully, and it was hard to imagine that they had just all fought for their lives just an hour before. Except for the exhaustion etched on their faces. Verdad had spent the last half hour listening to a recap of their adventures from Whizbang, interjecting what little he could confirm, about the ceasing of resurrections and the inability of porting. Brimstone grazed off to the side, oblivious to the tale of impending doom.<br>
<br>
&quot;So you are off to...?&quot; Verdad inquired.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vven?&quot; Whizbang prompted. Vven, now discorperal once more, regarded him blankly.<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;The prophecy, dammit.&quot; Whizbang replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do I look like, your personal secretary?&quot; Vven shot back.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, that was a short marriage.&quot; Pedi commented. Riverdane chuckled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright alright.&quot; Vven recalled after a pause:<br>
<br>
&quot;Only when Fear can overcome fear, <br>
And a Nightmare shed a single tear<br>
And that tear does burn in Natural flame<br>
Can one stop the beginning of End Game.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Natural flame.&quot; Whizbang said. &quot;Nature. Tunare.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Lovely.&quot; Vven said, miserable.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wakening Lands.&quot; Verdad commented. &quot;So how are we getting there with Whiz and my ports out of commision?&quot;<br>
<br>
Riverdane pointed to Brimstone. &quot;Have horse, will travel.&quot; he said. &quot;But 'we', Verd? You signing onto this?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;May as well, it's my world too.&quot; Verdad said with a smile. &quot;Besides, with ports down, that little vacation to Cobalt Scar with Jazzy is so off....unless...&quot; Verdad looked over at Brimstone. &quot;Hey Dad, can I borrow the horse?&quot; Brimstone tossed back his head and snorted fire in indignation. &quot;Didn't think so.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's go.&quot; River said, walking to the horse and swinging onto his back.<br>
<br>
&quot;River...&quot; Whizbang said, sitting down. &quot;I am old, I almost died defending an inky, and I am out of mana. In short, we mortals must SLEEP.&quot;<br>
<br>
River opened his mouth to speak, but then looked closely at them. Verdad looked tired, Pedi exhausted. Even Ramluk's massive shoulders were stooped. And Whizbang looked beyond his many years.<br>
<br>
&quot;River, I know we only have a month on this, and you miss your wife, but we need to rest.&quot; Pedi said gently. &quot;Please.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not tired.&quot; Vven said brightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vven?&quot; Pedi said, turning tired eyes toward him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Shut up.&quot; Pedi said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bah.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sleep, guys.&quot; River said. &quot;We'll go when able.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good.&quot; Verdad said, setting up near the base of the tree. &quot;I need my beauty rest.&quot; <br>
<br>
Whizbang smiled in appreciation and lay down next to his wife, one arm protectively over her. Within seconds, both were out. Magic of the caliber they used in the trial paid its toll, and dearly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ogga guard!&quot; Ramluk said, sitting protectively next to the two gnomes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ram, we're in Tranquility. Not even I am dangerous here.&quot; Vven said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh.&quot; Ramluk said. Two seconds later his chin was hitting his chest and he was snoring to wake the dead. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, Wyldechylde,&quot; Vven said. &quot;Just us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Just us.&quot; River said from atop Brimstone, looking out at that sky that he and his wife in earlier times had spent so much time staring at. His eyes grew distant, and Vven ceased to exist for him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just us my ass.&quot; Vven murmured, seeing River staring out over the water. &quot;He's with Cami, and inky? Is alone.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven went into a medative state, half aware, a mental shut down as he floated like a phantom guard.<br>
<br>
And River's eyes, unblinking, drank deep the sky. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 271<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/4/03 8:36:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> &quot;Ready?&quot; River asked.<br>

Ramluk was still yawning off the night's sleep. River lifted Pedi up onto Brimstone's back, and then Whizbang. Verdad gathered on one side, Ramluk on the other and Vven hovered behind the horse. River climbed up behind Whiz and gathered in Brimstone's reins. River's mind was still elsewhere as he leaned toward the horse's ears.<br>
<br>
&quot;River,&quot; Whiz asked. &quot;A question. Are you still the infamous dragon hunter you've always been?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye.&quot; River said distractedly, and then into Brimstone's ear: &quot;To Wakening Land.&quot; The horse and companions started to shimmer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why?&quot; River asked as they disappeared.<br>
<br>
FLASH--A horse and six people arrive in the lush foliage known as Wakening Land.<br>
<br>
&quot;Because...&quot; Whizbang began, panic creeping into his voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;YOU WILL NOT EVADE ME, RIVERDANE!&quot; came a loud brazen female voice from behind them.<br>
<br>
&quot;...Wuoshi may be up!&quot; Whizbang finished, bouncing off the horse and tugging at Pedi's ankle. She slid off hastily as River spun Brimstone around.<br>
<br>
Wuoshi beat her wings angrily in all her terrifying glory. One of the two dragons of Wakening Land, she was a sleek reptile of emormous size, brown and green scaled with large patches of tan crossing her mammoth bulk. A long thin neck, with a head atop with a mouth lined with sharp teeth. That mouth opened wide.<br>
<br>
A deafening frightening sound issued forth from Wuoshi's maw. It washed over them like a palpable force. River felt himself gripped in terror.<br>
<br>
With reflexes battle honed, River brought his hitched breathing under control. He recalled his training as knight, and the rarely used discipline of fearlessness he had learned.<br>
<br>
However, Brimstone had had no such training.<br>
<br>
The wave of fear had affected his companions as well. Ramluk had instinctively taken on a defensive posture, a warrior discipline used to cut his damage in half while maintained, but leaving no room for fearlessness. And the others were totally unprepared for the dragon's roar. They scattered like fish released into a pond deep into the wilderness.<br>
<br>
As Brimstone spooked, River grabbed tight onto his reins, but the panicked horse would not be controlled. River caught sight of Vven chuckling off to the side, unaffected. And then, the horse bolted. <br>
<br>
River could hear the dragon smashing through the trees behind him at an ungodly rate. It was all he could do to hold onto Brimstone's reins while attempting to duck low lying branches from the surrounding tree.<br>
<br>
Wuoshi closed in on him fast, matching the horse's speed. River could almost feel her hot breath on his neck. And then, he heard something that sounded like steam escaping a kettle.<br>
<br>
A green waft of vapors surrounded Riverdane, and he breathed them deep unwittingly.<br>
<br>
Dragon breath, he though a moment too late, I'm toast.<br>
<br>
Every muscle in River's body contracted violently, locking up. Brimstone took two more jarring gallops and River, completely immobilized, bounced off the horses back to land violently on the ground. River's eyes stared up in open shock, unable to move, as he lay there paralyzed like a fly in a spider's web. He heard the sound of Brimstone's hooves hitting the ground and retreating further and further into the distance.<br>
<br>
In his limited range of vision, Wuoshi's huge head loomed into view, taking up all visible space. And damned if it didn't seem like she was smiling, in some vague, reptilian way.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dragonkiller, dragonkiller, dragonkiller.&quot; she purred. &quot;My aren't we the mighty dragonkiller now?&quot;<br>
<br>
River stared up at her blankly, while his mind screamed.<br>
<br>
&quot;I've heard about you, Wyldechylde.&quot; she murmured. &quot;I helped set afire the bodies of the drakes you slaughtered your last 'visit' to Skyshrine. I took in the broodlings of Mazi after you decapitated her in the Western Wastes. The scent of your fetid blood has been in my system for years now, and now we finally meet. And aren't you.....small.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wake up, River, NOW! he begged himself. But wake up to what? To be able to struggle in this dragon's maw while she swallowed the last, however misrepresented, chance the world had? She was in total control.<br>
<br>
&quot;So now, where to start?&quot; Wuoshi pondered, a bead of saliva dripping unchecked from her mouth to land on River's cheek like a slimy tear. &quot;Shall I bite off your head, similiar to the way you treated Mazi? Or should I let you live while I eat your feet first? The poison should keep your body alive as I devour you. Keep the meat....warm.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her mouth opened wide.<br>
<br>
&quot;WHAT are you DOING?&quot; came a loud voice off to the left. River could not turn to see who it may be, but the shock of that loud a voice coming so close to him frightened him all the more. He has not even heard an approach.<br>
<br>
Wuoshi's head snaked to the side, and River could see only trees and sky, and just listen.<br>
<br>
&quot;Milord Yelinak!&quot; Wuoshi exclaimed.<br>
<br>
River blanched. Lord Yelinak, master of the Claws of Veeshan. Could his day get any worse. The Dragon Lord himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's happening, girl?&quot; Yelinak said heartily. <br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing, milord!&quot; Wuoshi said, clearly awed by her visitor. &quot;Just I have pinned down the criminal Riverdane Wyldechylde, and was about to slay him in your name!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmmm, more like in the name of your belly.&quot; Yelinak said dryly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Milord?&quot; Wuoshi blinked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me, Wuoshi, have you been eating a lot of red meat, lately?&quot; Yelinak asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;I....I.....I've had a giant or two recently, milord, yes.&quot; She seemed unsure of how to proceed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ewww.....frozen food. That would explain it.&quot; Yelinak said disapprovingly.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm afraid I don't underst....&quot; Wuoshi began.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think you've had one too many Giantsicles, Wuoshi honey.&quot; Yelinak commented.<br>
<br>
There was a shocked pause. &quot;Do you think I look...fat?&quot; Wuoshi stammered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Welllll, you're no Lady Gore, but I wouldn't say FAT.&quot; Yelinak drawled. &quot;And to think, I was coming here to ask you to the Dragon Ball, and find you snacking on a greasy human! I have to say, Shishi. that I'm a little turned off.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Dragon Ball!&quot; Wuoshi exclaimed, almost crying. &quot;Milord, it would be my honor to accompany you to...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's not get all hasty.&quot; Yelinak said. &quot;In the condition you're in, I may just ask Talendor to come with me...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sire, but Talendor is a male, and not even of Claws of Veeshan...&quot; Wuoshi said in shock.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, she's a he? I didn't realize.&quot; Yelinak said lightly. &quot;No matter. I'm still thinking I'll take her...him..it. Whatever.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Milord!&quot; Wuoshi wailed. &quot;Please, look my way again with favor! What can I do to win your pleasure again?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, &quot; Yelinak said. &quot;You can begin by laying off the humans. You're a druid, girl, go forage some vegetables or something! You have a week to lose a ton, or I'm going to be dancing with Trak...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Talendor.&quot; she corrected.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whatever.&quot; Yelinak finished.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Milord!&quot; Wuoshi said, her voice growing fainter as River heard her thundering miraculously away. &quot;You won't be disappointed!&quot; River could feel some small movement returning to his limbs, but could not yet turn his head to follow her retreat.<br>
<br>
&quot;And you,&quot; Yelinak said menacingly close to River, &quot;Look at how helpless you are, dragonkiller.&quot; He laughed a mightly laugh, which as it went on, it diminished in tone and volume, changing in timbre. Into River's view appeared a familiar dark elven face. <br>
<br>
River found he could move his lips.<br>
<br>
&quot;Find them, Vven.&quot; he croaked horsely. &quot;And thank you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;On it.&quot; Vven said. &quot;Don't...go anywhere.&quot;<br>
<br>
And then Vven's face disappeared from view.<br>

River was sitting with his back to a tree, still sore from his fall from Brimstone's back. But his limbs were coming back to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, I'm just riding this out.&quot; River said, looking over Vven's shoulder for the rest of the group. Vven was alone. <br>
<br>
&quot;Vven....&quot; River began.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, did you like my performance, the Yelinak thing?&quot; Vven cut in, chuckling. &quot;Old old spell from my arsenal, Alliance. Cast it and the target sees you as one of its own race. I had no idea who she would see, that Yelinak crap I made up on the fly after she named me. Pretty decent performance tho, aye?&quot; He beamed with self pride.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vven...&quot; River repeated, slowly climbing to his feet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, it walks! Congrats.&quot; Vven said, still absorbed in his role as Yelinak. &quot;You know, I always had a talent for acting. Was going to be a bard before deciding on enchanter. Broke my mother's heart, which was a bonus. The first dark elf bard! I could act with the best of them, but I couldn't sing worth crap. Eventually got angry and killed my vocal coach. Pity. I wouldn't have to camp that damned Froglok ghoul assassin for the inky mask.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;VVEN.&quot; River interjected loudly. &quot;Where are the others?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, them?&quot; Vven said. River just looked at him. &quot;Well, I found them.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And...?&quot; River prompted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, my plan was to sneak up on them and scare the hell out of Whizbang. They were all together, they ran off pretty much in a straight line. I am just about to break my invisibility spell and give the old man a heart attack when they are suddenly surrounded by about 10 of those giants.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Giants?&quot; River said in alarm. &quot;Walkers is on dragon faction...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know, I know.&quot; Vven said. &quot;Well, the giants' leader says 'Where are your papers?', and Pedi, anticipating the problem I guess, says papers were absconded by Wuoshi, whom they narrowly escaped after she realized they were Giant allies.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Smart.&quot; River said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye.&quot; Vven said. &quot;The giant actually bought it. So he asks their names, and I'm waiting for Hi, I'm Joe, and this is Mary, but Whizbang says, and I quote: 'I am Whizbang Dustyboots, gnomish sorcerer of the third rank, Baron of the Dragonscale Hills and wielder of the Staff of the Four! I am the scourge of the Teir'Dal, death incarnate to the Kromzek and ' ....well, you can imagine the rest.&quot; Vven paused, and then added, &quot;Maybe he should just shorten it to Whizbang the Idiot.&quot;<br>
<br>
River took a deep breath and said evenly, &quot;Vven, where are they now?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Now?&quot; Vven replied, &quot;Now, in jail.&quot; River let out his breath as if punched. &quot;You know, River...&quot; Vven mused. &quot;Everyone who hangs out with you ends up in jail. I'm sensing a pattern here...&quot;<br>
<br>
River ignored him, starting to march off the way Vven had come.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hold on hold on.&quot; Vven called after him. &quot;Where are you going?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm giant allied, and I'm going to get them out.&quot; Riverdane called back over his shoulder.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, wait up.&quot; Vven said. &quot;I'm coming with.&quot;<br>
<br>
Riverdane stopped dead and turned to Vven. &quot;No.&quot; he said simply.<br>
<br>
&quot;What no?&quot; Vven cried, insulted.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, Vven.&quot; River repeated. &quot;Dealing with giants is like juggling knives; you never know when you are going to slip and kill yourself. This will be a delicate enough situation without your mouth getting me killed.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I've never been so insulted!&quot; Vven exclaimed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes you have.&quot; River said curtly, turning back to the forest and marching off again. &quot;Find Brimstone or something.&quot; And then he was done.<br>
<br>
&quot;Me, Vven Psyphon, reduced to a STABLEHAND.&quot; Vven spat to no one in particular. &quot;Sure, Wyldechylde gets all the glory and Inky?....is alone.&quot;<br>
<br>
The forest regarded him silently and did not answer. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 282<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/13/03 10:58:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> Kael Drakkel...stronghold of the Kromriff and Kromzek Giants, palace of King Tormax, bane of the Claws of Veeshan and Coldain dwarves, pass between the lush Wakening Land and the frozen Eastern Wastes. Inhabited by a military force of storm and frost giants, winning the support of these untrusting behemoths was a long difficult task, but after presenting enough dragon heads as a gift, River, Nizzre, and the rest of Razor's Edge won papers for the majority of the guild, making what was a bloody battle ground for some a bank and haven for them. Ramluk was also free to pass, but on numerous occasions in the past, Ramluk carrying his papers was expecting just a little too much from a creature that emphatically will show you three fingers and proudly say &quot;Two!&quot;. But Ramluk would be River's leverage to at least see the King.<br>
<br>
Everything loomed large than life for River, walking through the frozen halls of Kael Drakkel. Amazing how outside the huge doors, where River had shown his papers to two guards playing dice in the warm afternoon sun, that the interior just past the doors could be so cold. But they liked it cold, the storm giants did. And they kept their home accordingly.<br>
<br>
Allied or not, this place always made River feel uncomfortable. Huge drakkel wolves, chained with large linked restrainers to keep them tied to a post, lunged at him and bared their fangs. River knew that even if loose they would never attack without order, but the wolves' eyes seemed to say to him 'We don't care about any papers'. River gave them a wide berth.<br>
<br>
As River passed one building, her heard an odd and familiar sound from it. The eerie sound of a flute carried across the frozen air. Deftly plucked mandolin strings balanced the sound beautifully, and a ironically familiar song sprang from equally familiar female lips. It was in its final verses, and the singer was performing it with a haunting sorrow. River felt his face flush red with emotion, warming him and at the same time making him feel as empty as a void.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nor questions later, months beyond<br>
Where in the woods near Kithicor's ponds<br>
To her screams and labored breath<br>
She gives troubled birth and bleeds to death<br>
<br>
And through her passing comes a chylde<br>
with hair as black and eyes as wylde<br>
And paladin raised, grew fine in form<br>
Of blood and pain Riverdane is born.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then....silence.<br>
<br>
&quot;SING THE ONE ABOUT THE NAKED COLDAIN WHORE!&quot; one voice yelled, breaking the silence. The laughter of drunken giants followed.<br>
<br>
&quot;We'll be performing that in a few moments when we return,&quot; a weary human male voice said. &quot;The band is going to take a five. When we get back, we'll do another round of 'Cold Ass Sally'....again.&quot;<br>
<br>
As with the song and the female singer, River recognized the voice of the male. He turned toward the bar and entered.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 283<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/14/03 11:00:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> River's eyes scanned the bar, but all he saw was a half dozen drunk giants, who ignored him as they tossed back huge mugs of beer. A hand lettered sign was on the wall, &quot;Trinity--Appearing today and tomorrow ONLY&quot;. River approached the bartender, a burly giant with red hair twisted into two war braids, and tossed a platinum piece onto the bar.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where's the band?&quot; he asked, looking up at the scowling giant.<br>
<br>
&quot;Papers, puny one.&quot; the giant growled. River fished into his armor, and took out a folded piece of parchment. He unfolded it and lay it on a dry section of the bar. The bartender glanced at it, scooped up the platinum piece, and motioned with his head to a door to the side of the bar.<br>
<br>
&quot;Back there,&quot; he said. &quot;Make it quick, we don't pay them to stink up the place.&quot;<br>
<br>
River nodded and refolded his papers and tucked them back into his armor. Then he made his way to the side door.<br>
<br>
He could hear the voices as he approached.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have to get a new gig.&quot; the male voice said. &quot;This place is dead. And the faction work to get in here is bumming me out, man.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There are no new gigs.&quot; the female said. &quot;I told you that a hundred times. No one is interested in music anymore. They're afraid to leave the house.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Can you forage up some chips? I'm going nuts.&quot; said a third voice, also male.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah we need some chips or something.&quot; said the first man.<br>
<br>
&quot;I told you, I'm a half-elf, we can't forage.&quot; the woman said wearily.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, you should have been the half that can forage!&quot; the second man said.<br>
<br>
There was a pause, and then all three started giggling. And then the sound of a cough. River swung open the door.<br>
<br>
Smoke filled the room. Draped over the large couch like small dolls were two human males and a half-elven female. One of the males was in the process of passing a small, handrolled cigarette to the woman. The smell in the air was a sweet scent, unlike the acrid smoke from River's cigarettes. They didn't seem to notice his entrance.<br>
<br>
&quot;I thought I recognized these voices.&quot; River said loudly enough to be heard.<br>
<br>
The effect was as if he had screamed in their ear. One of the men leapt up and fell off the couch. The woman started coughing and waving her hands in the air, trying to disperse the smoke. And the second man flipped the lit cigarette into his mouth, and with a grimace, swallowed. He skin took on a pale green hue.<br>
<br>
As the smoke cleared, the man on the floor peered at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wow, it's like...River.&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello, Thallas.&quot; River said, reaching down to pull the man to his feet. &quot;Sorry I barged in like that.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wow, River.&quot; the woman said. &quot;This is trippy.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm feeling a little 'trippy' myself, Katarin.&quot; River said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Man,&quot; the last man said. &quot;I thought you were a guard or something. I ate the smoke man.&quot; He looked decidely ill.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry Kaosmos.&quot; River said. &quot;I thought you gave this crap up tho, when you joined Razor.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, yeah, um.....I figured, one more time, you know. Since I was with Kat and Thallas and all.&quot; Kaosmos attempted lamely, looking at the others for support.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah right.&quot; Katarin giggled. &quot;You brought it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, thanks Kaos.&quot; Thallas said. &quot;I needed it, this place bums me out.&quot;<br>
<br>
River regarded all three bards fondly. The lingering smoke in the air was making him a little dizzy, so he sat down and looked at them.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have a little problem.&quot; River said. &quot;Whizbang is captured here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bummer,&quot; Thallas said sadly. &quot;The Boss.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Boss.&quot; Katarin agreed sadly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not cool the Boss is locked up.&quot; Kaosmos added morosely.<br>
<br>
The Boss. Odd thing about these three bards. Kaosmos was currently a member of Razor's Edge, Thallas from Walkers, and Katarin from Promethian Order. Yet all were Walkers at one point, before their separate lives and careers brought them to different venues. All worked for Whizbang. And even to this day, the wizened gnome was still &quot;The Boss&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;I need to see King Tormax and get him out.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No dice, man.&quot; Thallas said, shaking his head. &quot;Tormax isn't in.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, dude.&quot; Kaos said, &quot;You gotta deal with Mr. Cranky.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bad news.&quot; Katarin said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Real bad.&quot; Thallas added.<br>
<br>
&quot;Got any chips?&quot; Kaosmos asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;No chips.&quot; River said. &quot;Mr. Cranky would be....who?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I could use some chips.&quot; Katarin said. &quot;Thallas, you sure you didn't bring any?&quot;<br>
<br>
Thallas was rummaging through his pack. &quot;Chips, chips. Nope, no chips.&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Guys, guys.&quot; River said impatiently. &quot;Who's Mr. Cranky?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait!&quot; Thallas exclaimed, peering into the bag.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vindi, man.&quot; Katarin said to River.<br>
<br>
&quot;Chips??&quot; Kaosmos cried hopefully.<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot; Thallas said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bummer.&quot; Katarin said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vindi.&quot; River repeated unhappily. &quot;Lovely.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Roach!&quot; Thallas said, holding up a small half-smoked cigarette.<br>
<br>
&quot;Woot!&quot; Kaosmos exclaimed. He and Katarin gathered around Thallas, all three giggling at nothing in particular. River didn't even look at them as he began to leave. Vindi. How difficult was this going to be.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bye guys, thanks for the info.&quot; River called over his shoulder.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bye Riv.&quot; Katarin said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Later Riv.&quot; Thallas added.<br>
<br>
&quot;Got any chips?&quot; Kaosmos said suddenly, looking for River.<br>
<br>
But River was gone. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 287<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/23/03 10:31:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> &quot;GET OUT!&quot; the voice boomed. River stopped dead in his tracks.<br>
<br>
The rest of the bar was empty, chairs tilted back at angles that suggested they had been vacated rather abruptly. At the bar, he could see the huge back of Derakor, the Vindicator. Vindi to his associates and enemies. To his friends...well, Vindi had no friends. But he did have a temper. And that temper and alcohol tended to mix....explosively. Vindi hated everybody.<br>
<br>
The bartender quaked in fear, the bottle he was attempting to pour for Vindi sloshing liquid all over the bar as he attempted to steady his trembling hands. With onesweep of his massive arm, Vindi sent glasses, bottles, cutlery crashing to the floor and snatched the bottle from the bartender's faulty grip.<br>
<br>
&quot;I...said....GET OUT!&quot; Vindi bellowed. The bartender needed no further prompting. He left the building not looking once over his shoulder. Vindi growled to himself and tipped the bottle to his lips.<br>
<br>
Now or never, River. He began to tiptoe quietly towards the exit.<br>
<br>
Vindi paused, sniffing.<br>
<br>
Crap. River halted his breath, and slipped to the floor, eyes rolled back. He appeared very much dead.<br>
<br>
Vindi drew himself erect and turned fully, lumbering ominously towards River's prone position on the floor. His voice was the snarl of a predatory bear coming upon fresh meat. <br>
<br>
&quot;Fee...fie....fo...whatever.&quot; Vindi said menacingly. He leaned over River, so close that he could smell Vindi's last dinner. It smelled of charred flesh. It made River want to gag. Or scream. Or both.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know,&quot; Vindi purred like a tiger. &quot;A monk from Eternal Advocates once tried to feign death luring me out. Do you know what I found out about iksar?&quot; Vindi paused. River's heart skipped a beat.<br>
<br>
&quot;TASTES JUST LIKE CHICKEN!&quot; Vindi bellowed directly into his ear. River felt as if his eardrums had exploded. He winced despite himself, and at the first sign of movement, Vindi picked him up and dangled him in front of him like a doll.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, little idiot, I wonder what human tastes like?&quot; Vindi said.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have papers!&quot; River tried lamely.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't need no stinking papers!&quot; Vindi laughed harshly. &quot;You picked the wrong bar, human.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Listen, Mr. Crank...Vind...Derakor...&quot; River stammered. &quot;I'm just in Kael to have audience with King Tormax and I'm out of here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The only way you're out of anywhere is leaving my body with the rest of my offal.&quot; Vindi commented, sitting River on the bar roughly. &quot;But first, a pre-dinner drink. Move and I'll break your legs so you can't.&quot; River did not doubt it for an instant. He was paralyzed with fear. Vindi started tipping the bottle to his lips.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir?&quot; a voice from outside said suddenly. &quot;Are you in there?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What is it?&quot; Vindi snapped, putting down the bottle irritably.<br>
<br>
&quot;We...um had a prison break, Sir, but the prisoners were caught.&quot; the voice called hesitantly. &quot;We wanted to know what you wanted us to do with them since the jail is apparently not secure.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Send them in here!&quot; Vindi commanded, &quot;Then leave me alone! I'm trying to drink!&quot;<br>
<br>
The door swung open, and through it were pushed the gnomes, Ramluk, Verdad, and a stranger, a dark elven woman with a purple scarf tied into her hair. Her exotic purple eyes darted all around the room, checking for all means of escape.<br>
<br>
&quot;River!&quot; Whizbang exclaimed, spotting River sitting miserably on the bar. &quot;With the help of this woman we were able to get out of the cell, but then Ramluk...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Me gassy.&quot; Ramluk said sadly.<br>
<br>
&quot;...and the noise brough half the Kromriff in the place down on us.&quot; Pedi finished.<br>
<br>
&quot;SHADDUP!&quot; Vindi yelled, turning to face them. &quot;Can't a giant drink in PEACE?&quot; The sight of the Vindicator froze them all like possum before a racing carriage.<br>
<br>
&quot;On the bar, all of you.&quot; Vindi commanded. They hesitated. &quot;NOW!&quot;<br>
<br>
One by one, they scrambled up barstools and took their places on the bar next to River. The two women flanked him.<br>
<br>
&quot;And you would be....?&quot; River softly asked the dark elf. <br>
<br>
&quot;Runiko.&quot; she said. &quot;Tho had I known getting your friends out would put me in front of Vindi...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She used my hairpins to pick the lock.&quot; Pedi informed River.<br>
<br>
A rogue, River thought, filing away the information for future reference. If there WAS a future.<br>
<br>
Vindi was looking at them each in turn.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gnome, gnome, human, darkelf, ogre, high elf.&quot;, he contemplated. &quot;One two three four five six.&quot; He frowned. &quot;Just shy of a seven course meal.&quot; His face grew thoughtful. &quot;Although, I could eat the band for dessert.&quot; The bottle tipped up to his lips again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vindi,&quot; Verdad said suddenly. &quot;May I call you Vindi?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot; Vindi said flatly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vindi,&quot; Verdad continued on obliviously. Whizbang winced. &quot;Are you a gambling man?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Verdad...&quot; River began. Verdad didn't seem to hear him. He was just watching Derakor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, so what?&quot; Vindi said, bringing the still unquaffed bottle to his lips. &quot;Shut up, elf, before I use your spine to pick my teeth.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And by the way you're hugging that bottle,&quot; Verdad continued quickly, &quot;I bet you fancy yourself quite the drinker.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vindi raised an eyebrow. &quot;No one can consume more spirits than me. No one.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sure that's true of the rather weak-livered storm giants.&quot; Verdad agreed readily. &quot;But I bet you never had a drinking contest against a high elf.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They don't call them high for nothing,&quot; Whizbang whispered between clenched teeth. &quot;Verdad, are you HIGH?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sssh.&quot; Verdad hissed back. &quot;I once dated this wood elf bartender from Kelethin. I know what I'm doing.&quot; Then he turned full volume to the incredulous Vindi. &quot;Well, have you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Vindi let out a long nasty guffaw. &quot;You mean you think you can outdrink ME?&quot; he laughed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, yes, I do.&quot; Verdad went on like a carnival barker. Ramluk just sat staring at him blankly. &quot;I think that I could beat you in a drinking contest. In fact, I am SO confident I can that I am willing to risk the lives of me and my five companions here on that wager.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Their lives were forfeit the moment they entered this bar.&quot; Vindi reminded him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sooooooooo, you're afraid you'll lose, huh?&quot; Verdad said, shaking his head sadly. &quot;Wait till the people in bars across Norrath hear Vindi was afraid to have a drinking contest against a high elf. The shame, the shame....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Me? Afraid of losing to YOU?&quot; Another long laugh. &quot;Alright, little white elf. You are either an idiot or insane. But I will take your bet.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And if I win we can go free? All of us?&quot; Verdad said quickly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah yeah yeah.&quot; Vindi said. &quot;Whatever elf. You will not win.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We shall see.&quot; Verdad said lightly. &quot;We shall see. Alright, I'm going to request standard ale. But since you're such a big man, I'm going to suggest Dragon Fire for you.&quot; <br>
<br>
Dragon Fire. Some of the most vile, potent stuff served.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dragon Fire gives me the runs.&quot; Vindi said.<br>
<br>
Verdad sighed. &quot;Ok, Mr. I-can-drink-a-high-elf-under-the table, if you're afraid to try DragonFire...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Vindi is not afraid to drink ANYTHING!&quot; Vindi barked, anger creasing his brow. &quot;Dragon Fire it is.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good!&quot; Verdad exclaimed. He pulled three mugs off their hooks, each the size of his head, pitchers to a normal man, and began filling them with ale from the tap. He lined them up on the table, and then took a large black bottle from the bar and and started filling three shotglasses the size of water glasses full of a darkish liquid with steam rising from it. River's eyes watered even at a distance.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok.&quot; Verdad finished, putting down the bottle. &quot;You have but to drink those three shots before I finish these three mugs.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Easy enough, dinner.&quot; Vindi said, reaching towards the shotglasses. &quot;Say go, human.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;One minute....&quot; Verdad interjected. &quot;Not that I don't trust you, Vindi, but just for the sake of coutesy, let's make one thing clear. You are not to touch my glass and I won't touch yours. Deal?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah yeah, whatever.&quot; Vindi said. &quot;Say go, human.&quot;<br>
<br>
River stared at Verdad sadly, who just winked at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go.&quot; River said.<br>
<br>
Verdad lifted the huge mug to his lips and started chugging back the ale. Huge gulps he took, consuming it at a rather quick rate. Vindi, on the other hand, tossed back his first shot in two seconds. Smoke wafted from his mouth, and Vindi paused a moment, his grip on the bar tightening. But that was the only sign of hesitation. Verdad was only two-thirds done with the first mug when Vindi lifted the second shot to his lips and drank it down. Tears ran from the giants eyes, and a gurgle rose in the back of his throat, and he swayed. Verdad meanwhile, not looking too well himself, was just finishing his first ale. Vindi looked at the high elf, who was turning decided green, and smiled meanly. Verdad looked like he was ready to fall over.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not looking to good, elf.&quot; Vindi said, putting down his second glass. He reached for his third.<br>
<br>
With as coordinated a motion as he could muster, Verdad took his empty mug in both hands, and slammed it down upside down over Vindi's last shotglass, completely covering it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bah.&quot; Vindi said, going to lift the mog from over his shot. &quot;Looks like you lose, elf.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh uh uh.&quot; Verdad said warningly, shaking his head in drunken negation. Vindi paused. Verdad reached for the second mug.<br>
<br>
&quot;What 'uh uh uh'?&quot; Vindi said, reaching again to remove the mug.<br>
<br>
&quot;No touching my glass.&quot; Verdad said, and belched. He began drinking from the second mug.<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot; Vindi said, hand about to lift the mug from its spot over his shotglass. &quot;How am I supposed to get my...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No no no.&quot; Verdad said singsong. He tapped Vindi's hand. Vindi recoiled as if slapped. &quot;We made a deal. No touching the other guys glasses. Now if you'll excuse me...&quot; Verdad began draining the second ale with a grimace.<br>
<br>
&quot;YOU CHEATED!&quot; Vindi roared, standing up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Great Verdad.&quot; Whizbang hissed, &quot;Now we get to see him go from mildly annoyed to INSANELY PISSED!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;CHEATER!&quot; Vindi cried again, still swaying from the alcohol. &quot;I eat YOU first!&quot; He reached for the drunken Verdad.<br>
<br>
&quot;WHAT are you doing!&quot; called a voice from the other end of the bar.<br>
<br>
Vindi turned. Verdad turned. They all turned.<br>
<br>
There was Vven, with his hands on his hips.<br>
<br>
&quot;Momma?&quot; Vindi blinked in surprise.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vve...?&quot; Ramluk started, until a jab in the ribs from River shut him up.<br>
<br>
&quot;SONNY!&quot; Vven said, rolling his eyes, voice going up two octaves. <br>
<br>
&quot;What in Hells....&quot; Whizbang began.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alliance.&quot; River said, naming the spell. &quot;Long story.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Momma!&quot; Vindi repeated, looking at a spot fifteen feet above Vven's head. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I came to check on you,&quot; Vven said in that high voice, &quot;And what do I find? You playing with your food again!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Awww Momma...&quot; Vindi said, obviously awed by whatever he was seeing. &quot;I wasn't playing with ...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Did I hear you make a deal with that appetizer over there?&quot; Vven said suddenly, pointing to Verdad.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, yes, Momma, but he chea...&quot; Vindi began defensively.<br>
<br>
&quot;Didn't your father and I always teach you to uphold your deals?&quot; Vven said sternly.<br>
<br>
&quot;But Momma, Daddy's been dead since I was born. You told me you clubbed him to deathw hen you found him with that Kromriff stripper and....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Whatever.&quot; Vven said. &quot;Didn't I always tell you to uphold your deals?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well yes...&quot; Vindi said miserably.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then do the right thing!&quot; Vven said shrilly. &quot;Let them go, and I'll cook you your favorite....something.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, if you say so, Momma.&quot; Vindi said dejectedly.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the back door swung open.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, does anyone have any chips?&quot; Kaosmos said in a daze, stumbling out. &quot;Or peanuts, or someth...&quot; He stopped suddenly, as his eyes took in the scene. &quot;Far out.&quot; he murmured.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, be a good boy and let these things go.&quot; Vven recovered, after a startled pause at Kaos' entrance.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, Momma.&quot; Vindi said sadly. &quot;You can go now.&quot; With a sigh of relief, they began climbing down off the bar.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thallas, Katarin!&quot; Kaosmos called, freezing them in their positions of climbing down. &quot;You gotta see this! Vindi is acting all spaced out, and there's this dark el...&quot;<br>
<br>
A long chord was struck on a mandolin as Thallas came out of the room, and a blue light pulsed from the instrument. Kaosmos' eyes flashed the same blue light and then went vacant, as he stood there, drooling. Katarin's beautiful voice began to hum a familiar tune, as Thallas looked at Whizbang squarely.<br>
<br>
&quot;And now ladies and gentlemen,&quot; Thallas said, motioning to the door to Whizbang with his eyes. &quot;As promised, live in Kael Drakkel, Trinity's rendition of 'Cold Ass Sally'!&quot; Kaosmos stood quietly mesmerized as Katarin began to sing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, ok, get them going!&quot; Vven said quickly. &quot;Go now, shoo, little things!&quot;<br>
<br>
Whizbang thanked Thallas with a nod and a smile to Katarin and drew Pedi by the arm toward the door.<br>
<br>
&quot;Guards!&quot; Vindi called to the door.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Derakor sir?&quot; came a timid voice from the other side.<br>
<br>
&quot;Escort the prisoners to the borders and see them off.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Safely.&quot; Vven added.<br>
<br>
&quot;Safely.&quot; Vindi repeated.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whatever you want, sir!&quot; came the quick reply.<br>
<br>
Riverdane held open the door, and pushed them all out, Runiko in tow, and gave Vven a look of amazement.<br>
<br>
&quot;And as for me,&quot; Vven said, twirling a finger in his hair. &quot;I'm going to start cooking up that meal I promised you. You just wait right here and...finish your drink.&quot;<br>
<br>
And with that Vven walked out the door, River closing it behind him.<br>
<br>
Vindi, scowling now that he was out of his Vven's gaze, lifted the mug off the last glass of Dragon Fire. With an angry toss, he shattered the mug against the wall and kicked back the last shot of the steaming liquor.<br>
<br>
And the band played on.<br>
