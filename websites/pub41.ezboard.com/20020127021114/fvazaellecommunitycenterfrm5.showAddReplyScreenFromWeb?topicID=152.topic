and the calender.</span><hr size=1> I almost never use this board but check it now and then. Most people also know that I dont support booking of zones and planes and have never done it.<br>
<br>
Due to this The Caer had some misunderstandings with a few guilds in the past. Namely a hate raid where PO entered hate while we were there springs to mind. They had booked the plane but as stated before I dont support this. Both guilds were there and we took some heat cause we had killed 3 minibosses. As we are in the central euro time zone the normal mobs wasnt a problem so they farmed hate from the other corner.<br>
<br>
Today we had planed hate again but Agony was there the day before and it had not repopped yet. One of our druids went to PoG and reported it had popped. I changed our plans to PoG cause it was empty. Someone asked in guildchat if anyone had reserved it and I logged on to the board from an other computer at the netcafe. Nobody had booked it so I could we went ahead. Whenever I would have respected the reservation is another issue and I wont get into that here.<br>
<br>
So we break in and begin to kill. A few hours later I get a tell from Vaclav stating that they had reserved it and the reservation have been removed. I replied that he should take it to the board moderator but he went on and talked about how I prolly hacked the board to remove it from the board. A few minutes later I get jumped by Ekko who got a slightly different version of how things happened.<br>
<br>
Its the worst thing I've met on this server yet. If you are so focused on a lousy PoG raid that you have to accuse others of hacking you need to do something else. You dont even belive it yourself. One of the moderators is from SF and the 'IP's dont lie' is the lamest thing. Cause they do lie if you want them to. Its just another lame excuse to make us look bad.<br>
<br>
Make your own conclusions if you want but if you cant talk to me without being so lame, dont messege me again please. I have plenty to do running The Caer. If I find you in a plane....Fine you were faster and smater than me and I'll back of. But I wont jump on you with talk about reputation and honor on the server.<br>
<br>
This is a game. Treat it as such.<br>

So how do you &quot;hack&quot; the calendar when all you have to do is go in and delete other people's posts?<br>
<br>
This is fixed now anyways. The calendar is password protected and it nakes logging IP addresses that much easier.  <p><table>

<br>
The post was first deleted last night after I logged in. I don't need to &quot;get my story straight in guildchat&quot; because I admin that calendar and I saw the post up at 10pm EST. Agony was in PoH around 12am EST, and when I logged late last night the post was gone. It was then reposted, and then this morning it was gone again. Reposted it again and logged in and CC was in PoG. And you wonder why we would suspect someone associated with Caer Cadarn?<br>
<br>
Yes, you got screwed by Agony. Why turn around and do it to someone else? Certainly not going to make you any friends. <p><table>

I said I wouldn't be suprised if someone in your guild deleted the reservation because when I logged off last night at 6am EST it was there, I woke up at 10am EST got ready and checked the boards while waiting on Iviy to get herself together about 11am EST, when I checked the calendar it was gone..<br>
<br>
And Caer Cadarn by your own admission went into POG at around 8pm EST. Tell me, it gets deleted and within 2 hrs of the deletion, someone else moves into the plane, anyone with a brain will immediately suspect you or someone in your guild.<br>
<br>
The especially unusual thing was how you changed your story midstream when I said that we could likely track down the IP that deleted the calendar entry, and if that was the case it would certainly look bad... a bluff, but one that made you say... and I quote &quot;All Planes are FFA in my opinion anyhow, I support that&quot;... at that point you tried to disuade me from the previous topic of the calendar entry being removed and instead moved it to an argument about FFA being right...<br>
<br>
(Which basically your opinion is, 'Plans for other guilds mean shit to me, because I'm on a Euro time schedule so I can screw other people's raids at will')<br>
<br>
People like you devolve servers into rushfests and nasty tricks in order to get spawns versus taking your time, setting up patiently and enjoying the game, if it makes you feel somehow 'more uber' to act like a child thrashing around making excuses why the rules of sharing the majority of the guilds on Vazaelle comply to, I pity you.<br>
<br>
All guilds have silly squables over spawns, you had one of two ways to handle it: a. Be an ass and state that the rules most of the server abides by were below you OR b. Apologize, explain the misunderstanding and try to comply to the rules in the future.<br>
<br>
Any reasonable human being takes B. Even a 'I'm sorry, we didn't mean to ruin your guys plans, it's too late for us to call off our raid, we'll try to avoid this sort of thing in the future' would have done alot more to retain your reputation... Much like some willingness to investigate if any guild members had been responsible for deleting the calendar entry, prolly wouldn't have come up with anythng, but would've been a damn nice gesture to take 5 min to talk to everyone that was online at the time.<br>
<br>
And for this being a 'lousy POG raid', we had it on the schedule for FOUR days, admittedly the circumstances are different, but for the early days before alot of the FFA rules were set read 'I don't usually rant but...' thread for the first 4 or 5 pages. You'll find a similar attitude got given, in the case of SF, it was accidental from being accustomed to how their previous server did things, but they've since fallen in step with the rest of the servers opinions.<br>
<br>
And if you think this has little impact on the server, guess again.... one guild declaring FFA on planes means the next one that you step on will likely be forced into FFA'ing them, etc.. Then you get people all ready to go to a plane raid the next day at login who get let down badly.<br>
<br>
Oh and as I said before, your comment about most of the ubers only spawning during US Primetime is laughable... most of those spawns have a modifier of some sort on them(i.e. last VS kill we got was at like 4pm EST or so, he repopped the next time at 7am EST or so, right in Euro prime) <p>-Vaclav Romanov, 54 Erudite Vicar<BR>Sacred Fires<BR>Vazaelle<BR>Two months later I update my sig, and I'm in body armor and a kilt(It's not a skirt!)...</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uvaclavromanov.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vaclav Romanov</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 146<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/26/01 4:02:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=152.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sacret Fires, CC and the calender.</span><hr size=1> And to add another stupid move on your part...<br>
<br>
We didn't know your IP to cross-reference it with whomever altered the calendar, and guess what... checking into the IP's that accessed the calendar one of the few IP's that appears on there multiple times within the last 24 hrs matches your IP on this post(We can safely filter out any single accesses, since all use of the Javascript to add or delete a calendar entry shows a second IP occurence)<br>
<br>
Narya knows the legalese between posting IP's better than I do I'm sure, I know we can't post the information publicly, but I believe anyone who asks for the info can be sent it privately. But I'll look into it in case anyone wants to see the information that hung you. It's not 100 percent accurate, but how Narya makes the incoming IP log sound, it's as reliable as a DNA test, 95-99 percent. <p>-Vaclav Romanov, 54 Erudite Vicar<BR>Sacred Fires<BR>Vazaelle<BR>Two months later I update my sig, and I'm in body armor and a kilt(It's not a skirt!)...</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uslyvarius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Slyvarius</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 193<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/26/01 4:52:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=152.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.facelink.com/slyvarius?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sacret Fires, CC and the calender.</span><hr size=1> can I have a mochachino with my EQ?<br>

Baldrik's rant came from the SAME IP as the IP that was used to EDIT THE CALENDAR.<br>
<br>
That's good enough evidence that if he had done something criminal via the internet that the police would be tracking his IP to the RL person and investigating RL for further info. IP in Internet Crime is almost equivalent to a fingerprint or DNA testing in RL crime.<br>
<br>
And if you don't know what an IP is(which I figure you don't, or otherwise you didn't read my full posts), it's what identifies your machine on the internet. First three numbers always the same, and the fourth variable sometimes depending on the ISP.<br>
<br>
And FYI, I could give a shit about a POG BP, we're starting in Halls of Testing within the month if all goes well, and Skyshrine BP is much more to my liking, not that even then I'd make a big shit about it though, click 'Mark of Karn', /orgasm.<br>
<br>
And as for 'MY' guild being put under a bad light by it...<br>
1. I quoted only FACTS, not one thing I said was opinion without me stating it as such.<br>
2. It's not my guild, I am not an officer, but I am a great at being the solo voice that puts up with people's bitching to improve the quality of play for myself, my guild and the other guild's on the server.<br>
<br>
And the minute you question my reputation check this shit:<br>
1. I escorted Hope's Beginning through the Hole last night for 3 hrs including my guild helping on the CR when we got a deathtrain(we think a bugged spot in the zone), Iviy and I were planning on heading down there anyways to work on redoing an epic step, but still I took my time to help them.<br>
<br>
2. I do an average of 5 to 10 OUT OF GUILD and NOT IN MY XP GROUP rezzes per day, and never ask for a cent and refuse payment unless people keep trying to hand it to me and it interferes with me playing<br>
<br>
3. I talk to a large number of people on the server for no reason other than to help them with quest questions, etc. since I have a 3rd comp available at all times for browsing the internet, since it makes their life easier.<br>
<br>
4. I often powerlevel random newbies when I can't think of something to do, once again, no particular reason I enjoy it<br>
<br>
5. For your comments hinting at me being a loot whore, by my own choice I gave my Othmir Prexus Totem(super rare range slot item, 2 on server last time I checked worth 30-50k on most servers) away to someone who could make better use of it, also assuming Elestria(a level 52 cleric in SF atm) gets her Gimblox ring in time I am planning to let her finish her epic before me, even though I have seniority since the effect benefits her more than myself, since I should be 56 by the time it's my turn.<br>
<br>
6. Ask 90-95 percent of the server their opinions of me... I carry a pretty hefty amount of respect from a large number of people... only negatives you'll hear about me? -- I go on forever about stuff(I think you'll agree about this) and I can be a real ass about getting my point across, but I ALWAYS mean to make everything the best for EVERYONE.<br>
<br>
Am I perfect? Far from it... do I know about reputation? Hell yes, and I'd like to think the general community holds me in high regard, even though like all humans I do piss a few people off unintentionally from time to time.(well, not completely true, not unintentionally when I'm dealing with assholes ^_^) <p>-Vaclav Romanov, 54 Erudite Vicar<BR>Sacred Fires<BR>Vazaelle<BR>Two months later I update my sig, and I'm in body armor and a kilt(It's not a skirt!)...</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uvaclavromanov.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vaclav Romanov</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 150<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/26/01 6:25:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=152.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sacret Fires, CC and the calender.</span><hr size=1> It's not a goddam skirt... /cry....<br>

I'm afraid that IP-addresses are no proof at all, certainly not for criminal activities on the internet. IP-addresses can be spoofed, people can use anonymizer-services for web-browsing, public places internet-cafes and libraries will probably connect to the internet using NAT, which means any computer on their local network will have the same IP to the outside world.<br>
<br>
An IP-adres will only feed suspicions, but will not hold any proof. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uamstelcc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AmstelCC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/26/01 8:23:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=152.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sacret Fires, CC and the calender.</span><hr size=1> First of all, I'd like to express my disgust at what's happening here. Such a shame the rants and flames forum contains double the posts than all of the other forums on most server boards. I hate posting on these kind of forums, especially these kind of threads, but I just couldn't let this happen. <br>
<br>
I know for a fact that Baldrik did not even touch the raid board. But I know you won't take my word for that, I don't expect you to. The thing is, you can dream up whatever allegations you like, back them up with some pseudo evidence (I've yet to see any *concrete* evidence, beyond &quot;We have some vague IPs that almost match, but I'm affraid we're not allowed to show them to anyone.&quot;), and blacklist us with certain groups of people. Not that I really mind, since most people with half an intellect will judge us by our behaviour in-game and wait for you to produce something <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> concrete</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> in stead of that abstract unsubstantiated IP mumbo-jubmbo.<br>
<br>
Anyway, let's clear a few things up shall we?<br>
<br>
1. It's no secret that we don't support calendars/booking (check with Baldrik or one of the officers in game if you want to know why). We use FFA. We plan a raid. If there's nobody there at the time we planned the raid, we move in. If there's somebody there, fine. You beat us to it. WE won't bitch and moan. FFA, plain and simple.<br>
<br>
It's very ignorant and naive to assume each and every guild will adhere to your ideas and systems. We don't play EQ so we can check some message board to know when we're <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> allowed</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to play this *Game* and have fun. We all pay our 10$, that's enough. You can not in a million years criticize someone for not following your guidelines. This might come as a shock to you, but the only group that has any real authority are the guys who cash our monthly 10$ checks, Verant.<br>
<br>
2. Knowing the above, why on earth would we even bother wasting our time checking the calendar? It goes against our beliefs. <br>
<br>
Is it suspicious that the post was gone when we did PoG? Sure it is. Does it matter? No it doesn't, because we would've done PoG whether that post was there or not.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for &quot;IP's don't lie&quot;. That's the most naive thing I've heard. Want me to tell you how IP's can lie? CTRL-C CTRL-V from one log to another.<br>
<br>
Do you really expect everyone to take your *word* on it? Dispite the fact that every crackhead can doctor a log, I could use a laugh, so please send that irrefutible, incriminating evidence to <!--EZCODE MAIL START--><a href="mailto: SidneyR@bigfoot.com"> SidneyR@bigfoot.com</a><!--EZCODE MAIL END-->.<br>
<br>
And another thing, the issue in question aside, next time you try to accuse somebody of something similiar, make sure you have the evidence beforehand. Still, you deserve some credit for originality. thx la~<br>
<br>
In the end, it's going to be your word against ours. Even if those logs point towards Baldrik, they could just as easily been Doctored. I've known Baldrik for donkey's years, I know who's telling the truth. Everyone will have to make up their own mind about that.<br>

<br>
Since 12/22/00 (the day the server opened, as I recall), Vaclav has probably done at least 200 totally selfless, reward-less resses for me, my friends, and guildies that I personally witnessed.<br>
<br>
I haven't run into Narya nearly as much, but she WAS the first character I ever cast Swift Like the Wind on, so I must think she's pretty cool, too   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

As for the reservation system, my guild - Celestae - will be heading to the Planes VERY soon (tomorrow, for our first time, in fact, if our dear leader remembered to reserve it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), and I can tell you that an attitude of ignoring the reservation system is going to get you and your entire guild on everybody else's 'Total Sleazebag' list, if it hasn't already happened.<br>
<br>
You might want to consult your guild and make sure that your personal lack of character and concern for others won't have a terrible impact on each of them as well, as people point at them in the EC tunnel and exclaim, &quot;Ugh, another one of those Caer Cadarn scumbags&quot;.<br>
<br>
Get your shit together, grow up, respect the reservation system, and don't piss the rest of us off so much that we have a '911' team standing by to go grab any Plane or mob that you guys are gathering to go kill.  This 'total asshole' business can work two ways, dude, and I can GUARANTEE you that I have VASTLY more RL experience in being a complete asshole (self-employed professional) than an insignificant amateur like you  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Who are you to dictate what methods other guilds use to raid? If we're a bunch of pricks because we will not be told how to enjoy this game by other people, then so be it. You simply cannot force people to take part in a reservation system if they don't want to. If you think otherwise, or if you believe that somebody is a prick because they think differently from you, with all due respect, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you're</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the one who needs to grow up. <br>
<br>
Second. I'm sure my post has angered you somewhat seen the fact you obviously think very highly of Vaclav. I felt exactly the same tanger when Baldrik, a very good friend, my guildleader, and a person who I think of very highly was accused of such a bogus act. Try to look at it from the other perspective. Get the full story and then flame if you must.<br>
<br>
I haven't played with Vaclav and Narya in game. These posts are my first real impression of them. So naturally I base my opinion of them on these posts. Maybe they had just reason to suspect Baldrik (though I find that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> very</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> unlikely). As I said, I haven't seen these so called logs. I can vouch for the fact Baldrik had nothing to do with it. <br>
