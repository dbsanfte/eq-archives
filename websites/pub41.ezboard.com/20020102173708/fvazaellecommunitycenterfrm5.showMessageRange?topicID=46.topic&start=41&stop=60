We feel dragons are a mob that can be scheduled and should be.  I speak for all of us when I say this.<br>
<br>
We also wish to work extensively with other guilds to make sure we do not step on others toes and make a system to make it fair for all.<br>
<br>
The first come first serve approach is a poor one in relation to dragons.  There is great precendent on other servers for using the schedule for dragons.  I can guarantee you that if you keep this position on the dragons that it will cause much more trouble than just working with others to schedule them.  This is no threat - there is no reason for one.  I am just merely pointing out that I think it will hurt your guild in the long run if you keep that position. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
It doesn't matter which guild is the most powerful guild on the server.  The real challenge is: how long will your guild last?  If run correctly it can last an awful long time.  If run poorly, the guild can collapse and members will flock to greener pastures.<br>
<br>
Again, we stress peace and friendship with all the guilds on the server.  There is plenty to compete for in this game, but lets not let our competitive nature overcome our humanity.<br>

most of what keadaian said is true except one thing...<br>
he didn't send me a tell saying they were doing nag tomorrow before i did... i thought it was funny at the time, because we both sent the same tell that 'we were doing nag tomorrow' at the same time, but mine came out just a little bit faster... immediately after i said 'bah i said it first :P' then he said, i think, 'you got 2 dragons in 1 week, let us have 2 in a week', then he said 'we already have it on the calender' and so yeah it was me who told them about the emergency patch in the first place, the reason i did was because we were killing(trying) vox and i wanted their scheduled raid on vox that friday to still be up, so i said, hey there's a patch tonight she'll be up for you all... it wasn't long after that when i said we're doing nag again tomorrow, and again both mine and keadaians tells about that were being typed at the exact same time, there was no 2 minutes difference, more like 1/2 second... well the next day we were going to kill nag again, and kea was sending me tells, so i asked Carrais who is an officer in SF to talk to him instead of it being me... it's kinda hard to talk to people officially when you can't really speak for the guild cuz your just a normal member... after the whole<br>
<br>
well anyhow, i ended up de-guilding myself yesterday morning over this whole thing.... but after some serious talking with certain people i am staying in SF<br>
<br>
IMO on dragons... right now there is only 2 guilds on vaz that can kill them, and they should be killed the day they spawn (especially nagafen since i know some IV members need zordak ragefire) so, 2 guilds, 2 dragons.... on a patch day each guild could take one... but if you don't have the forces the other guild can take both, so that the dragons die as quickly as possible to yield more spawns so that the most number of people can get their epics<br>
<br>
anyhow i'm done talking <p><BR>

Let me clarify for the masses.<br>
<br>
Fuck Sacred Fires.  Fuck Promethian Order.  Fuck In Virtue.  Fuck Caer Cadarn.  Fuck En Media Res.  Fuck Sliver.  Fuck Agony.  Fuck every guild with more than 10 people over level 40.  Fuck this bullshit about might equals right.  It doesn't.  Some of you may play Everquest to prove how much better you are than other people.  Maybe you were picked on as a child.  Maybe your mother loved your sister best.  Too bad.  Get some fucking therapy so you can leave that shit behind when you log-in.<br>
<br>
Me?  Yeah, I'm a member of PO.  Big fucking deal.  I love my guild.  We do great things.  But frankly, this issue doesn't have shit to do with us.  In a sense, it doesn't have shit to do with SF either.  In good time both guilds can kill uber_fucking_fuckmob_fuckteen 27 fucking times.  let me clue you in on something, though.<br>
<br>
Everyone isn't in one of the large guilds.  I know this may come as a surprise to some of you, but there are actually other people who play this game.  That's right, all those avatars you see walking around are controlled by another actual human behind a screen somewhere.  And here's the kicker--you're not more special than they are.  Their mothers may even have loved them a little bit more.<br>
<br>
Before I came to this server, I was always part of smaller, usually mid-level guilds and I guess I still see things from that perspective, and here's how this looks to me:<br>
<br>
-***-<br>
<br>
Small_Guild_03: &quot;Hey, why are you uberguilds always fighting?&quot;<br>
Uber_Guild_02: &quot;Because we have to prove we're better and more special and more important and have bigger cocks than all the other guilds on this server.&quot;<br>
SG3: &quot;But why?&quot;<br>
UG2: &quot;You wouldn't understand you fucking pissant, get out of my face.&quot;<br>
SG3: &quot;But we want to get together with Small_Guild_05 and Small_Guild_12 to arrange a Naggy raid and we need to be able to schedule a time to hit Naggy when everyone can be there...&quot;<br>
UG2: &quot;You want to hit Naggy?  Ha!  If you don't have the manpower to take Naggy down the second he pops then you're just out of fucking luck.&quot;<br>
SG3: &quot;But some of our guild has wanted to kill Naggy for years now and never gotten the chance...&quot;<br>
UG2: &quot;Cry me a big fat fucking river.  Ever read Dr. Suess when you were a child?  Remember the story about the Starbellies?  Well we have stars and you fucking don't and there's no machine to get a star here.  We're more important and special than you.  Obviously if you're not in our guild you're not only a complete fuckface but you're also a bad player.  And you're n00bish attitude of actually wanting to kill ubermobs that only we have sovereign right to is annoying me.  Fuck off.&quot;<br>
SG3: &quot;Well could you at least post on the calendar when you're killing stuff so we can try and get together a group to kill Naggy on repop?&quot;<br>
UG2: &quot;NO!  God damnit, I thought I explained to you that only we're allowed to kill ubermobs.  If we posted on the calendar people like you might do like you said and steal our kill.  FFA is a misnomer.  It's supposed to be FFU--Fucking For Us.&quot;<br>
SG3: &quot;... Well, can we at least send a couple people along on your raids for a shot at quest drops?&quot;<br>
UG2: &quot;Fuck no!  You're all n00bz and l0s3rz if you're not in our guild.  You just create lag.  And they're OUR items anyway.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go farm some stuff which is incredibly green to me so that I can turn around and sell its items to the same people I just KS'd it from.&quot;<br>
<br>
-***-<br>
<br>
The calendar isn't for those of us lucky enough to be in powerful guilds.  Sure, it helps prevent us from butting heads which is a noble cause in and of itself, but we don't _need_ it to accomplish things.  However, there are 2000 people on Vazaelle at peak hours.  Maybe 200 of those belong to powerful guilds.  That's 1/10 of the server population.  That means 90% of the people who potentially want to kill an ubermob do not have those resources at their disposal.  They have to coordinate to kill an ubermob and that's why we must maintain a calendar.  The big guilds can and should discuss a rotation for ubermobs, and they should post the results on the calendar.  Whether or not you believe ubermobs can be scheduled, at least post your intentions on the calendar for the sake of those who don't have infolines set up with the big guilds.  I mean, does it really _hurt_ you if you post your plans on the calendar?  After all, you should have already talked with the other big guilds such that they won't gank it from you.<br>
<br>
Have a little respect for _everyone_ on the server.  We're all people and we deserve at least that.<br>
<br>
....and if you think just you're more important than someone else just because you have  a guildtag over your head or you come from uber_server_05 where you had 87 level 63 necros, fuck you. <p><p><center><img src="http://www-scf.usc.edu/~rabiega/sigs/slansig2.jpg"><br><i>Sslanis Soulforge<br>Just Another Dead Lizard</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucarrais.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carrais</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/9/01 12:36:53 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I don't usually rant but...</span><hr size=1> Kaedaian,<br>
<br>
I was quite honest in what I said, no sarcasm intended. On a personal level, I have to agree with Sotae. The level window on Naggy/Vox is too small to let them sit till someone is ready to kill them, especially when theres only 2 guilds capable of doing so. Faster killings = more spawns. I know you guys are in the same boat as us, and as of Wednesday night, we are done with those two dragons.<br>
<br>
As for scheduling, I would certianly like to see guild leaders work out an agreement. We can make a passworded calendar here, or at least try to. Right now I think the problem is, if we make it passworded, then only guild leaders can post OR view it. Nobody else would be able to read the calendar. If anyone knows a calendar that we can use that can only be posted on with a password, and can be viewed without, please let us know.<br>
<br>
But what do we want here? Are we only talking about Naggy and Vox? Or do we want to reserve every single large scale encounter we ever do in the game, just cause we're afraid someone else might beat us to it? Honestly I don't think its possible. I can see it happening for Nag/Vox possibly but things like Trakanon, VS, velious dragons, lodizal, KD, etc I don't really think so..<br>
<br>
Clearly there is logic behind our view, but you are right in that we cannot dictate how things will be done on Vazaelle. IF we come to an agreement, great. We can honor that. What I'm afraid of is the lack of honesty displayed quite often on this server so far. We as a server can make a system, but how many will adhere to it? And I mean soundly adhere, not with half-truths and political nonsense. That is for Congress, not for EQ. We're here to have fun, so lets make the game better.<br>

As this is a young server the large guilds right now are in a tenuous position.  How scheduling, etc. is acted upon now will effect the tone of this server for a long time.  Right now we have the privelage AND the responsibility to set-up a communal and positive high-level community that is to our liking.  In the end, that will be our legacy. <p><p><center><img src="http://www-scf.usc.edu/~rabiega/sigs/slansig2.jpg"><br><i>Sslanis Soulforge<br>Just Another Dead Lizard</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukeltekakatheolis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Keltek aka Theolis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/9/01 1:04:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I don't rant either, but...</span><hr size=1> ***Warning, this post expresses my own view, not that of my guild***<br>

Now, SF scheduled Dragons whether they were scheduled by their members, martians, some ninja poster from the Nameless, Big Bird, whatever....but they did schedule them, and as far as I understand they followed through with that schedule until it suited them to do otherwise.<br>

Wtf do you think the Vazaelle population is, stupid??<br>

Theres no reason, Carrias, for calling my guild leader names then trying to justify reasons for that, period.  Theres never a reason to do that.  No respect to you dumb mfers who let yourselves be lead by an ass like that.  Please continue, and enjoy the shittiest rep on the server.<br>

Bottom line is, whether someone agrees or disagrees, someone is going to be pissed off no matter what, someone is going to lie, someone is going to call the truth a lie, could be on either side of the argument. Bottom line is, if you want to kill Ghey_monster_of_asscream_00 in the zone Hills_of_00b3rland<br>
at 6pm, dont fucking try to post it and reserve it. Other people have other RL schedules, other objectives as well, and if theirs make it so they are there before you, than too bad you can kill it at a later time. Nagafen is a poosae dragon who will be up 500000 more times in the future, and from what i know , SF only plans on killing him one more time before we level the hell up and leave his noob ass alone. If PO wanted him, PO shoulda been there, but they weren't, and SF was. So, cry if you want till next time he is up, or move on and dont dwell on it. Everyone will get the chanve to kill the ghey dragon, its not a big fucking deal. Deep breath pls.<br>

And Befb....i am truely glad your the only asshole i have seen posting bullshit from IV...i like everyone else i have met from your guild besides you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  &quot;we are doing things only other guilds could dream about&quot;. Yea you might be killing stuff we cannot yet. Congrats on being here on day #1 and having no life whatsoever or having all your chars played by 20 people nonstop so you can call yourself king shit of new_server_110. *cheers* Our guild got here late, and was in no hurry to be so god damn superior. It makes people less than you because you can kill VS? hahaha. Enjoy him while you can, cause you wont be able to rape him nonstop all to yourself soon. I love lots of ppl in IV, but Befb or whoever the fuck you are, makes me sick.<br>

And I'll flame you Anja (and not your guild, though why they would let you stay is a mystery). <br>
<br>
I am glad that we have different opinions.  Why?  Because yours are self centered and insular.  <br>
<br>
I am also glad that you don't care what I think.  Small minded people rarely go far in this world and picturing you with your fingers in your ears and eyes shut, saying &quot;I'm right.  I'm right,&quot; in any kind of professional environment... makes me smile.<br>

<br>
From Anja's post:<br>
<br>
&quot;Other people have other RL schedules, other objectives as well, and if theirs make it so they are there before you, than too bad you can kill it at a later time&quot;<br>
<br>
This gets to the point I've been trying to make.  People do have actual lives, and that is exactly why a calendar is necessary.  Are you saying that because someone's schedule forces them to log in 1/2 hour after you they have no right to an ubermob kill?  This is especially important with spawns like Naggy because, assumining they are killed roughly when they spawn, they will always pop at the same time so people with schedules that didn't allow them to kill it the first will prevent them from ever having a shot.  Maybe one time in a year the spawn time will get pushed back late enough that, say, Europeans have a shot at Naggy in their regular play hours, but if there isn't a calendar being maintained they'll probably never find out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nagafen is a poosae dragon who will be up 500000 more times in the future&quot;<br>
<br>
That's irrelevant.  Because of the relative rarity of the spawn there will always be people who want to kill him when he spawns, and there will be more arguments in the future if we don't enact some capacity for scheduling.<br>
<br>
&quot;Everyone will get the chanve to kill the ghey dragon, its not a big fucking deal. Deep breath pls.&quot;<br>
<br>
In this particular case, no, it isn't a big deal.  PO can kill Naggy at a later time.  However, what concerns me is the precedent this is establishing, and that is a big deal.  As I've said in my other posts, big guilds aren't the only people who should have a shot at dragons and other ubermobs.  Yet if they are FFA only with rare exception will anyone else have a real oppurtunity at it.  It is a big fucking deal how we move forward from here.  I hope once SF and PO level past Old World dragons that the younger guilds cooperate better.  I would rather we step back and take the time to set a good example and precedent for them.  It seems, however, that you are not interested in that.<br>
<br>
&quot;Our guild got here late, and was in no hurry to be so god damn superior. It makes people less than you because you can kill VS? hahaha. Enjoy him while you can, cause you wont be able to rape him nonstop all to yourself soon. &quot;<br>
<br>
C'mon, what is this competitive bullshit?  The IV I know prides itself as being a well-organized and effective guild.  I think it's impressive what they've done so far and they should be respected for that.  Are you trying to pick fights?  Would you rather fight over spawns in the future or have a mutually beneficial system worked out?<br>
<br>
&quot;take comfort in the fact that i could give a shit less about what you think&quot;<br>
<br>
It's hearing things like this that really hurt me.  Maybe it's because I actually do care about other people.  Then again, maybe it's because I realize that a time will come on this server that there will be a large number of high-level competing over a small number of high-level spawns and I want to get along with them.  Does it hurt me that someone else has a great piece of equipment?  Hell no, especially if they're in my group.  I want everyone to prosper and I want to help people do so.  I hope among other people that feeling is mutual.<br>
<br>
There is an old adage, something along the lines of &quot;Actions speak louder than words.&quot;  Most people interpret it as meaning that if you want to prove a point you should act instead of speaking.  I, rather, think it's more of a testament to the power of words that they should even be compared to actions so.  I fear some people are discrediting the effect the words written here will have on people's actions in the future of our server.<br>
