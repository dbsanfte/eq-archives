I can understand why you wanted to keep the camp. I'm sure a lot of people would have tried to hold on to it after a LD. And this is why Zozz has my utmost respect: after Mijac relinquished his right to the camp, Zozz gave the camp back to Mijac. Bravo!<br>
<br>
--Tenken<br>
p.s. It was a long time ago, back in my 40's, the AC popped in sro by the ruins, I saw it and started hacking on it. Dunno if I would have been able to solo it then, but I noticed that all of a sudden other people were attacking it! I didn't get the kill but they let me loot the ring! They could have let me beat on it until it killed me (which was the most likely outcome to this encounter, seeing as I'm a poor solo class = warrior) and then killed it, legitimately taking the spawn. So who killed the AC for me and let me loot the ring? Members of Caer Cadarn. The only name I can remember is Mocow because I had grouped with him before, but this is very late and although I think I thanked everyone there at the time I may have missed someone, so....

Some say the world will end in fire;
Some say in ice.
From what I've tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To know that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice.

So, to make up for it I just want to say FUCK THE NEW METALLICA!!! Holy shit, you listen to the pre-black album, that was some FUCKIN' METAL! But come on, this new &quot;I disappear&quot; jack from Mission Impossible 2 is ASS. I fucking turn that shit off if I hear it on the radio. Yes, I bought the album with the symphony, I thought it was cool that they mixed metal and classical elements together. But 'Load' was mostly crap. 'Re-Load' was only a smidge better. The 'black album' was pretty decent, but it goes to show that Cliff Burton was the fucking soul of Metallica. The songs on 'And Justice For All' were a little long sometimes, but that was the last album that I could listen to without feeling the need to skip any songs on it. Even though Cliff didn't perform on that record, you could still hear his influence in the songs, even the ones he didn't have writing credit for.<br>
<br>
But what really gets me is the whole anti-Napster shit. Fuck Lars. I'll bet if he was 18 years old again and trying to get a fucking record deal, he'd be using Napster to get his music out to the public. Maybe what he's worried is that if people were to hear the new shit that Metallica is putting out on Napster for free, they would go &quot;WTF? This isn't fucking Metallica! I ain't going out to the store and buying this crap!&quot; and Lars wouldn't be able to buy the new house in Beverly Hills that he's been eyeing.<br>
<br>
Sad thing is, that this has kinda tainted my enjoyment of the old songs that they recorded. It's sad that they want to fuck over some of their fans who want to share some rare recordings and spread the Metallica music to others. It's not like these people are charging others to download the music. It's free! The people who put 'Master of Puppets' at 128kbps on their harddrive isn't getting a cent from the people who decide, &quot;this is cool shit.&quot; Of course, you may lose a few sales to those people who don't go out and buy the album at a store. But there is the possibility that these people may actually go out and BUY ALL THE OLD ALBUMS. Plus, you dont get all the liner notes (with lyrics!) and fucking UNCOMPRESSED music! Trust me, I CAN hear a difference between mp3's and CD's.<br>
<br>
I hope this is adequate atonement for my previous post.<br>
