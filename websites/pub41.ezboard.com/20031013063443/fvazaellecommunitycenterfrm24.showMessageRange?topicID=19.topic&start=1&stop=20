<br>
I dont fucking care what Herder or anyone has to say about me through your words. <br>
<br>
I dont care that you think that I havent responded to Banther's email just because he emailed me at the WRONG address. Just ask Zozz how long it takes me to reply to that address when he thought I hated him for not posting his picture or replying to his emails for so long. Again sorry bout that zozz =).<br>

Actually, he's not a resident anymore, since he stupid-ass got banned...  but I'm pissed at Birch, nonetheless.  I guess I'm pretty stupid to get baited into a language petition, but I didn't think someone would be so low and gutless to do such.  <br>
<br>
I guess after getting completly O W N E D on the forums, he had to take out his pain &amp; misery someway...  <br>
<br>
I present to you (with commentary) my conversation with Birch:<br>
<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:47:26 2002] Birch tells you, 'so have you figure out Menexia is in your guild yet? lol'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Wow...  nice opening line.  Not even a hello or 'sup~  </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:47:44 2002] You told Birch, 'I see Menexia has been guilded.  '<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:47:54 2002] You told Birch, 'He doesn't play though...  he's more of a port mule, FYI.'<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:48:03 2002] You told Birch, 'So how can I help you?'<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:48:23 2002] Birch tells you, 'man that was funny when you said she wasn't on that thread and then had to reverse yourself, made you look stupid'<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:48:45 2002] You told Birch, 'For someone that says how much the VCC doesn't relate to in-game... and goes on to say how one shouldn't comment on other people's game...  sure goes quite a bit to worry what the membership of Blight does.  '<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I guess since he can't comment 'bout me on the VCC anymore, he has decided to take it in-game.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:49:52 2002] Birch tells you, 'never said vcc was off liomits for commenting on others, what it is about, said improper ingame behavior is not justified by disagreeing with someones opinion on vcc, big difference'<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:49:55 2002] You told Birch, 'As I said...  I don't play as much as I did in the past and I didn't see him get guilded...  regardless--Menexia doesn't play and he n'ot some tool of the Blight, contrary to what your twisted mind believes.  '<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:50:55 2002] Birch tells you, 'lol anyone with a Blight tag is Krimzin'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Hmmmm...  last time I checked, we have a lot more people than Krimzin (and wow...  he spells his name right now.)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

[Sat Apr 20 10:51:16 2002] You told Birch, 'You have no clue.  '<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:51:38 2002] Birch tells you, 'read the pnp rules, they state improper behavior'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> This is one of many examples where Birch throws out blind accusations...  all with ZERO merit.  </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:53:35 2002] Birch tells you, 'so have you gained phat lootz since guildhopping to Blight and leaving your &quot;good&quot; friends behind'<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:53:58 2002] You told Birch, 'If you had any idea...  you would see how foolish your statements are.'<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:54:07 2002] You told Birch, 'As a matter of fact, I got a hell of a lot more loot in PO than Blight.  '<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:54:13 2002] You told Birch, 'Hello, full suit of KD armor.'<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:54:21 2002] You told Birch, 'I would get a hell of a lot more of loot if I stayed in PO.'<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:54:23 2002] You told Birch, 'But I wasn't happy there.'<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:54:31 2002] You told Birch, 'I didn't enjoy playing EQ under that leadership.'<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:54:46 2002] Birch tells you, 'so brown nosing Krimzin is more fun?'<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:54:52 2002] You told Birch, 'While I regret leaving many of my friends from PO, why should I not be happy and see all my real life friends leave to form a new guild and not play with them?'<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:55:02 2002] You told Birch, 'As a matter of fact, Krimzin is NOT the leader of Blight.  '<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:55:10 2002] Birch tells you, 'technically'<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:55:19 2002] You told Birch, 'No.  It's reality.  '<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:55:33 2002] You told Birch, 'Regardless...  what is it to you?'<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:55:46 2002] Birch tells you, 'it's entertainment'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I don't understand how nitpicking at Blight/Respect would be considered enjoyment.

[Sat Apr 20 10:57:18 2002] You told Birch, 'Nope.'<br>

[Sat Apr 20 10:57:52 2002] Birch tells you, 'well that's part of Krimzin's philosophy, you have to study harder'<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:58:32 2002] You told Birch, 'If you understood what you are talking about...  or did even a bit of research, you would know that brownnosing krimzin wouldn't get you a single piece of loot.'<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:59:14 2002] Birch tells you, 'lol that's right, because he keeps the best for himself '<br>

[Sat Apr 20 10:59:47 2002] Birch tells you, 'lol DKP, who assigns the poinst and keeps track'<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:59:47 2002] You told Birch, 'It's a merit based system...  NOT subjective.  '<br>
[Sat Apr 20 10:59:59 2002] Birch tells you, 'merit is subjective'<br>

<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I have spoken to Birch, ONCE in-game prior to this log.  I don't even remember if it was him, but he says I purchased my Lodi shield from him.  I probably did, because I did trade some junk to some random EC tard for my lodi shield.  It was a plesant transaction though.  I made my trade and that was it...  never heard from him in-game again.  <br>
<br>
And then this event takes place...  <br>
<br>
Seriously.  What the heck is this guy's problem?  He comes spouting that line out of nowhere and gets in a verbal duel with me regarding Blight, Krimzin, and my leaving of PO.  <br>
<br>
What the heck is it to you?  Some anti-guild piece of shit sure makes a big deal about the inner goings of guilds and their members.  What is it to you that I left PO.  I didn't want to be in that guild and I wanted to be in another guild, so we parted ways.  Granted, there were some hard feelings... but I did what I felt would make this GAME (yes, it is a game...  this is not real life, nor it is a job...  as long as I don't do anything malicious, I'm pretty sure it's cool.) more enjoyable for myself.  <br>
<br>
Why am I explaining myself?  Who knows...  perhaps to blow off some steam for a totally unnecessary warning against my account.  <br>
<br>
If anyone really cares (which I doubt) I left PO because my REAL LIFE FRIENDS were starting a new guild and I was unhappy with the leadership of my old guild.  It was a difficult decision for me--due to the friends I made in PO.  BUT, at the end, the decision was simple: The game wouldn't be fun for me, if I wasn't battling side-by-side with my buds who I see almost everyday.  <br>
<br>
BTW, I'm tired of seeing all this shit 'bout people using guilds/guild hopping/etc...  Yes, it sucks.  But what can you do?  It's done, move on...  why keep harboring and spreading the hate?  The whining of &quot;we did so-and-so for Ex-Guildmate_01 and he just leaves us.&quot;  Have you thought for a moment that your former guildmate did stuff for you as well?  Do you think that so-and-so should NOT enjoy the game just because you got him some piece of loot?  BTW...  I don't see THIS UBER PIECE OF ARMOR WAS BESTOWED UPON YOU BY YOU GUILD AND YOU OWE IT TO THEM TO LIVE UP TO IT etched anywhere on my BP.  <br>
<br>
If I am not having fun in the game...  I'm either going to 1) Stop playing or 2) Find a way to make it fun.  I'm pretty sure that applies to everyone else...  if they are jus' crawling through the game and doing things just out of obligation, that's a pathetic way to play A FRIGGEN GAME.  <br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong...  I'm all about helping my friends and others do things and get things they want.  I do feel  obligation to my guild to help out and do whatever I can.  I feel that obligation to my friends in the guild cuz I know they will go to bat for me--so I naturally will go to bat for them.  BUT (big but)  I shouldn't feel that they are a ball and chain locked to my ankles.  It's not right to keep doing unenjoyable things just because someone was awarded a nice weapon or armor.  <br>
<br>
That's what some people are making of it...  or at least that's what it sounds to me.  <br>
<br>
I have seen some no-lifer losers in the game--but we have ourselves the grand poo-bah of rejects.  <br>
<br>
I guess he misses the verbal abuse he took on the VCC and decided to bring it in game.  <br>
<br>
I hope you got your little chuckles w/ that petition, you fucking tool.  Enjoy your soap opera entertainment--since that and jizzing about making 250-something (or whaver the tailoring cap may be) tailoring is what makes EQ enjoyable for you.  I'll go play my game, and you play yours...  okay? <br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>

<br>
Lets have the whole server send a tell to Birch saying hello. <br>
<br>
Say every 15 mins starting at :00, :15 :30 :45 <br>
<br>
Just say &quot;Hello Birch, how are you today.&quot;  <br>
<br>
And hot key it to let him know we truly care.   <p>Pyne Forrester
