Americans do not want to live in a theocracy.  By and large, Americans believe that if it doesn't hurt other people you should be allowed to do it.<br>
<br>
While there very well may be things that are immoral that do not hurt other people, that is in my opinion a matter of personal morality and not the business of the government.  Government just needs to prevent us from infringing on the rights of others.  Achieving personal salvation for us is not the job of the government.<br>

Theft or murder deprives another human being of his/her basic rights.  It fundamentally affects another person besides the parties that choose to engage in the practice.  Sodomy does not.  Alcohol is somewhat more debatable as you can argue that it causes harm through drunk driving etc.<br>
<br>
Why should I care if two consenting adults want to sodomize each other in the privacy of their own bedroom?  It has no effect on me at all whatsoever.  Let them do what they want.<br>
<br>
There is a utilitarian ethical argument against murder and theft that is not valid against sodomy.<br>

I'm not going to argue whether one violates some mystical human right that you feel you have, but rather I just point out that our laws as they stand are a consensus majority feeling of what is &quot;wrong&quot; to do within society.<br>
<br>
Drugs are another point where society has deemed them to be more troublesome than they are worth to have legal.  While you can argue that alcohol is a &quot;danger&quot; due to drunk driving, I can point out that unprotected anal sex is 100x more likely to transmit a Venereal disease.<br>
<br>
It's silly to use either of those as justifications to WHY we have the laws in the first place thou because they come into play but only as a justification to the people who are making the laws rather than the defining factors, that being how society feels.<br>
<br>
Suicide is illegal, yet it can quite easily be argued in the case of people who are terminally ill, that death is most definitely the pursuit of happiness.  Who's to say Sally's pursuit of happiness isn't swallowing a 12 gauge barrel and blowing her brains against the wall, yet we do it as a society and deem it to be &quot;wrong&quot; so we make it against the law. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=204898"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.flash.net/~bigdon0/lfg.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1843<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/18/03 10:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ten Commandments Judge</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I can point out that unprotected anal sex is 100x more likely to transmit a Venereal disease<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, but the risk is to the parties that make the choice to engage in the questionable behavior.  In drunk driving, the risk is to a 3rd party that did not consent to incur that risk.<br>
<br>
I do see your point though that many of our laws come indirectly out of religion as they represent consensus morals of a society, which if you trace back far enough, probably derive from religion.<br>
<br>
However, I believe that society is embracing a new paradigm.  I think it is decidedly secular and based on more philosophical ideas of morality such as utilitarianism.  We are increasingly tolerant as a society of most things that do not harm 3rd parties.<br>

  Basically stated, if the law is morality based, it's going to get overturned based on this case.  While I will agree that Sodomy between homosexuals is ok in my opinion, I have to respect the wishes of the majority.

Personally, I don't think these things should be illegal.  For the most part, I think they are morally wrong and contradictory to my religion (Christian).  However, I don't think it's the government's business to legislate it.  I waver a bit on outlawing adult incest or bestiality, because of the potential for an injured 3rd party (either the child born with 3 heads and 18 toes or the animal).  I'd have to think more on those 2.<br>
<br>
I think the Supreme Court got it right.<br>

<br>
  There is no innate law that says you can not harm other people or do things that might remove personal possessions from the control of others, but rather our morals dictate to us that these things are indeed wrong.  It doesn't take a bible for someone to have moral character, but it does take strength of will to enforce those morals on yourself and to a greater extent to have the courage to enforce the majority belief on the populace as a whole.<br>
<br>
  I find it incredibly appalling that the judicial system of this country has taken it upon itself to override the actions of a state legislature.  Personally, if you don't like the law in the state of Texas, there are approximately 40 odd other states that will allow such behavior, and vice versa on various other laws.  It's not the Supreme Courts job to dictate what morals are ok to uphold and which are not in my opinion.  They are there to uphold the constitution of the United States and the Amendments.  <br>
<br>
  Yes, I will admit, the rights of homosexuals were withheld in Texas.  But ask yourself this, where is the constitutional breach?  There was most certainly due process of law, as it was a law passed by the state legislature. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1856<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/19/03 2:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ten Commandments Judge</span><hr size=1> Essentially, a secular state should try to create some sort of a moral code that does not rely on religion.

What you can do though is argue that a state should set up rules that are mutually beneficial for all members.  It's in all of our interests to protect our property, our persons, and our freedom.  Thus the state should protect those.<br>

However, the ten commandments residing in a court of law is exponentially more symoblic than a general reference to christianity in a painting.  The ten commandments are basically the rules which govern Christianity and result in the criteria for which man is judged by his maker, and them residing in a place that ultimately judges man gives the impression that the establishment is biased towards the rules displayed in their foyer.<br>
<br>
That courthouse may be 100% unbiased regarding Christianity, but it doesn't matter.  The image they portray gives alot of potential towards the thought of bias, and that's the last thing you want in a court of law.  Unfortunately, image counts here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1899<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/23/03 8:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I just don't buy it.  I think people are being very oversensitive.  I've never accepted that freedom of religion is the same as freedom from religion.  Rather, I think society should allow many religions to exist and flourish and not try to remove every semblance of them from our society.<br>
<br>
That being said, the state shouldn't practice any particular religion or try to enforce religious law.<br>
<br>
To ignore the influence of religions on our culture is to deny the obvious.  To place the ten commandments there does recognize their historical and cultural importance in our country.  It does not however make them the law of the land.<br>
<br>
I do think the reasoning of this judge is wrong.  He is essentially trying to put Christianity in the courtroom, and he has a long history of doing that.  Thus, I don't agree with his motivations or his arguments.  However, I do think that the anti-religion people are overzealous and need to chill out and not be so damned sensitive.  Our culture is full of references to ideas and beliefs that we may not agree with, but our culture is a melange of those philosophies, and it's ok to recognize that.<br>

Maybe if it were more equally represented with other religious icons it wouldn't stand out so much, but you have to at least understand why people can construe the potential for bias from that courthouse.  That's reason enough to order the removal in my opinion.<br>
<br>
I do however agree that alot of people are overly sensitive about religious issues in our country and moreover the world abroad.  When it comes to the establishment that judges your citizens holding a bias or just dangling the word around, I think it's an issue worthy of the extra drama. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1901<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/23/03 1:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Well, that judge really helped to make it into an issue by defending it on religious grounds.  He really was most of the problem imo.<br>
<br>
For example, I think an exhibit in a courthouse with monuments representing various historical contributions to the rule of law would be appropriate.  They could include anything from the ten commandments to hammurabi's code to the napoleonic code etc.  I also think any one of them alone is appropriate.<br>
<br>
I don't like the judge's beliefs though that this should be about putting God in our courtrooms.<br>

You sir should be shot thx.<br>
<br>
Canada right now is having major problems with Same-Sex Marriage. The Pope even released a statement saying all catholic lawmakers have a moral duty to reject this.<br>
<br>
Canada and the US is having similar issues in that the Court is now making the Laws instead of the elected officials. At the moment there is nothing the elected officials can do to stop the same sex marriage except use a special clause termed the Not-Withstanding Clause which basically allows them to say no without really any reason and that will only hold for 5 years before they have to revisit the issue. The courts have decided saying it is illegal is against our Bill of Rights and a breach of our Constitution.<br>
<br>
In some ways the courts deciding the Law is good and some ways its bad. Either way we are going to have to live with it. The only time its bad is when you have a judge such as this when he wants to bring in his religious doctrine into his court. He sounds like he is unable to make a clear decision as he is biased and outspoken about his bias. He should be removed from his duty. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=477296">Kerai</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
In the US, lawmakers can override the judiciary if they want to.  Basically, we would have to pass a constitutional amendment.  At that point, it would be pretty much impossible for the courts to reject any law.<br>
<br>
However, that's really not a very easy thing to do in the United States and it has to be something that is widely agreed upon.  I think 3/4 of the states have to ratify it after it passes both houses of congress.<br>

<br>
your not getting the point the supreme court made in its desicion. In georgia ALL anal sex is outlawed.Had the case originated there the ruling would have been quite different. In Texas anal sex is completely legal to a hetro couple, and yet illegal for two men. That was the basis of the desicion, and thats called discrimination. Now could the supreme court open up a discrimination suite from the state level to the federal level? Could the justices have supported a law that obviously discriminated only against &quot;gay&quot; couples?<br>
<br>
So whatever happened with that protester dude? its much the same case, as he was singled out for his views on politics and not his choice of romantic liasons.<br>
