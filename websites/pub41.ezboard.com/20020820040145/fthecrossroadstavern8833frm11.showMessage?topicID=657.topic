I guess the longer a zone is around that is fun, the more it will degradate tho. Here's how I spent my night:<br><br>On our way to disco, its late, camp is completely open, we are fighting in hall when here comes an iksar monk, Morin, tearing past us with a frog in tow. It, of course, adds to our fight..well, no big deal..but I have this strange feeling in my stomach. Where was that monk goin in such a hurry when there are no people in disco? I quickly find out, he is pulling! Yay, right thru a group he brings ALL the rest of the hall, plus the interior mobs from disco! Woot, can you say death to the wizzy who was tryin to evac? I know you can boys and girls. Chanter manages to mez the 12 mobs, the rest of us evac, I pull wizzy's corpse to entrance and then I zone with 10 life...<br><br>I zone back in, ask Morin &quot;WTF?&quot; He can't be a man and admit his mistake..NOOO, wouldn't be prudent, he's a MONK! Of course we have to go through the whole rigamorale..&quot;No, I didn't train anyone, I'm near chef, heh&quot;..&quot;Well, I might have pulled thru a group earlier, I don't know, do you need help with CR?&quot; &quot;Chill out dude&quot; etc etc...I'm starting to get that eyelash twitch as visions of KC run thru my head and dealing with people pulling LCY to the entrance begin flashing. Ok, I'm gonna forget it, wth, let's get on with it.<br><br>So, anyway, we are fighting back to disco when guard breaks! Ok, we'll take guard. We move into guard, go thru a cycle...then we run into trouble with a gater from exit, and when we go to pull from beyond bridge, all of exit agros..so we have to succor, no biggie. Nobody in exit, no harm done, we begin workin back to camp, we get an LD, so we wait a sec. I go around the corner from rock, and there is Alwayyz, kinda hangin out, waitin for a shammy friend, at guard. My cleric tells him that we are coming back to guard, just waiting on a LD. Well, his buddy gets over to him, and the named beetle is right there...our group watches as they pull the Named! Attaboy! WTG!! I run over and say &quot; Thanks for pulling for us, but we can handle it&quot; and of course they have to play like &quot;What? this mob? oh, yea, well, um..&quot; I ask Alwayyz if he cares that he is campstealing..&quot;Nope&quot;. Then afterwards, when my group is all at guard, even the LD..Alwayyz 'graciously' offers to give us the &quot;shitty vambraces that dropped&quot;..More cursing from  my direction..another &quot;Chill out dude&quot;....I'm sorry, is this game now composed of classless pinheads? Should I even bother investing more time here, or is this game a lost cause? 3 years, maybe all the good people have left, leaving us with this &quot;second generation&quot; of cretins who've just been released from Juvy? I don't know...I just wanted to share this, and for those of you who have moved to Charassis to avoid it...THEY'RE COMING! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubburlydorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BBurlydorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#333333>(7/9/02 6:35:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=657.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Sebilis-The death of a fine zone (</span><hr size=1> Seb has always been a mixed bag.<br><br>On the one hand it's one of the zones people go to when they move beyond KC. A low 50's group can hunt there, but not in complete safety. Even getting to a camp can become an ordeal. As a result, the zoneline and Exit can turn into a death trap with inexperianced players trying to run for safety.<br><br>At higher levels it's possible to do camps that are out of the way of trains and long-distance pullers. But King, Juggs/Reets, and Crypt can go badly and CR can suck big time.<br><br>Mid-50 players are tempted to bite off more they can chew.<br><br>High level players tend to do high-exp camps and pull everything they can reach. (Camping Guard it's not uncommon to pull Exit, Necro Jail, etc.). Alternately they either solo or partner an easy camp.<br><br>IMO if there are 36 or more players in Seb and you can't handle King, Juggs/Reets, or Crypt (or they're camped) it's time to find another zone.<br><br>Seb is a great indoor zone with camps suitable for various levels. Inexperianced players, high level players doing mid-level camps, and overcrowding are to my mind the only problems.<br><br>Try Maiden's Eye if you want to see the circus.

Did you ask if anyone was camping/pulling disco?  60s tend to like ae grouping, and although a 12 mob pull sounds like a train to you, it barely qualifies as a mana efficient pull for me and some wizzy friends.  Lastly, and this sort of goes along with my first statement, if you can't handle guard because one person goes LD, it is not the camp for you.  I don't care if it was your chanter or your cleric.  You're going to flame Alwayzz for killing something in guard with him and his shaman friend when you couldn't kill stuff there with 5 people?  <br><br>No offense to you, but it sounds like you just need some experience, it sounds alot like you're the one coming into seb from karnors, not knowing the ropes, and blaming stuff on everyone else. <p><center><table border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"><tr><td align="center" valign="center"><font face="Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Camoman</strong></br>Warder of Tunare</br><a href="http://www.raarcentral.com"><strong>Crusaders of Plilo</strong></a></br>Snare Bitz<br /></font><font ace="Verdana, sans-serif" size="0"> <a href =" http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=79622 ">Profile</a> | <a href="mailto:jeremyjw1@hotmail.com">E-Mail</a> | <a href = "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=106246 "> Pet</a></font></td></tr></table><br /><image src="http://home.rochester.rr.com/eqstff/BestCrit.jpg"></image></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ulaeninraidge.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Laenin Raidge</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://147.4.150.5/~jercole1/laenin.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 325<br> <font color=#333333>(7/9/02 9:42:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=657.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://cs.hofstra.edu/~jercole1/pics/laenin.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sebilis-The death of a fine zone (</span><hr size=1> To answer your question Savej, I think you should stop playing and give up on this game like I just recently decided to do.

Yep, I'm just a crazy flamer, inexperienced in the zone who is crying because I had a rough night. End of story, move on..<br><br>Easy!<br><br>Now, for a second, let's suppose I have been in sebilis for 4 months. Let's also suppose that: A) In the first instance, when you are working your way to disco, and you are halfway down the hall, the last thing you expect to see is a monk with 10 mobs behind him running at you FROM disco when the campcheck revealed that NOBODY was in disco/lib when you started working yer way there. And since he trained you on his way INTO disco, you can rightfully assume he saw you working your way down to camp and DID NOT care, he was gonna make a massive pull, dammit, and impress his friends and you and your full group are just an obstacle to his glory. B) When you finish pulling from guard camp to pyramid, there are NO more mobs left for you to pull, so rather than sit around talking about the recent phenomenon of pinheads and get all depressed, you decide to risk it and make a pull from the opposite side of bridge...and with a wizzy in group, succor is always a legit option. After succoring you announce you're moving back to camp run down and see 2 pinheads furiously scrambling to get to guard, yu tell them DIRECTLY that you are moving back to guard, explain in some detail what yer group status is, and then watch as they furtively pull the named...<br><br>And you would defend this action? I mean, I understand Herbi would, hell, he turned training people in KC into his trademark ( I see yer corpses in the ODDEST places, Herb, lol ) but anyone who seriously believes this is good gaming needs to pull their head out. And yes, I don't believe in anonymous posting, or changing names to protect the guilty..I stand by my words AND actions, have nothing to fear from reprisal, whereas people who DENY at first their actions, then attempt to JUSTIFY their actions, then say &quot;Hey chill out dude!&quot; are simply irresponsible and immoral bastards.<br><br>/rant off <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usnackoriffic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Snacko Riffic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fatty</span><br>  Posts: 197<br> <font color=#333333>(7/9/02 1:39:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=657.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> You got an LD at the guard camp so you had to wait?<br><br>Next time bring a shaman, he will solo the camp for ya <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ugadine.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gadine</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://[image]www.primecolorphoto.com/images/realm%20powers/rplights/.gif[/image]" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#333333>(7/9/02 1:47:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=657.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sebilis-The death of a fine zone (</span><hr size=1> I generally avoid posting on this forum, but know some of the folks in this post so will add this...<br><br>Since the hoards discovered Seb a couple of months ago, it hasn't been as nice of a place to be as in the past.

There were maybe 60 people on the entire server (then The Rathe) that had keys to the place.  Groups of people that normally wouldn't give each other the time of day were exploring the place together and trying to figure out what went where.<br><br>The zone ceased to be the same zone it once was when camps took over.  Camps suck.  They take the skill out of the game.  Unfortunately it's just the nature of the beast I suppose.  Lower Guk was one hell of a fun zone until such a time as you could zone into the dead side of the zone and run all the way to the live side castle without seeing a single living frog.  The zone changed due to the same reasons Sebilis is changing:  People gained levels and started staking out little bits and pieces of the dungeon.<br><br>I always thought the game was much more fun when 6 skilled players had the outside chance of getting their collective butts beat into the ground on a bad pull.  Seems to me they need to add the crawl back to the game.  The crawl is what makes the game fun.  That's what made the trip down to visit the queen in Chardok fun.  That's what made the trip to kill Trakanon fun.  It's also what made the trip to kill Lord Yelinak fun.  When we killed stuff with KEG, we always did the crawl with at least the first few groups for a raid.  We didn't screw around with the whole &quot;camp a CoH mage at the cubby hole&quot; thing.  We fought our way there.  That was fun.<br><br>Wish they'd add more zones for people to do these types of crawls.  If you've never been part of a group doing a dungeon crawl to defeat a boss mob somewhere, I think you've missed out on one of the most fun things you can do in the game.<br><br>Velks leveling be damned, even the run to Velkator and Lord Dojomustard was fun.  It was very cool seeing what a zone had to throw at you and seeing if you could defeat it.<br> <p><center><table border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"><tr><td align="center" valign="center"><font face="Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><strong> Lewick Goodheart</strong></br></font>Warder<BR>Final Uprising<BR>Zebuxoruk Server</td></tr></table></center> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/udeian222.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Deian222</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Crazy Smith</span><br>  Posts: 189<br> <font color=#333333>(7/9/02 6:24:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=657.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sebilis-The death of a fine zone (</span><hr size=1> Savej had that first monk offer to help with cr.
