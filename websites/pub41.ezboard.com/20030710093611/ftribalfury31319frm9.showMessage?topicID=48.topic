Ask any questions if you don't understand something, or point out anything I probably have missed.<br>
<br>
Make or break?  Let's face it, not too many raids have been called off because &quot;we just don't have the druids here&quot;.  But we can play a MAJOR role whether a raid is successful or not.  It will mean dying alot though, so just get used to it.  <br>
<br>
Rule #1  Listen<br>
Rule #2  LISTEN<br>
Rule #3  Raid say is for the RL (Raid Leader) explaining what mob it is we are going after, what he/she buffs need before or dispells during the fight.  Raid say is for the MT (Main Tank, also goes by MA for main assist) to announce what mob we are to target and when to assist in ending it's loathesome existence.  Please wait til the MT has announced that it's time to &quot;ASSIST&quot; to do so, and not before.  Raid say is also for important announcements calls such as &quot;slow has landed&quot; or &quot;malo in&quot; or &quot;Magic Resistance has been lowered&quot; etc.  Raid say can also be where the cheal calls are being made, tho not likely with us.<br>
<br>
Raid say is not for you to be spamming what ur having for dinner, or LoL's, or your Kei is fading, or I think that Dark Elf is hot.  First and foremost we want you to have fun at raids, and we ALL know that Dark Elf is hot, but if people missed an assist call because your yelling out that you forgot to put mustard on your pastrami, you could potentially wipe the whole raid and get alot of people pissed at you because of it.  And that's just no fun.  There's a time a channel for all of that, and it's not in rsay.  Just try to be courteous.<br>
<br>
Spells-<br>
<br>
Buffs are easy -  We Don't have the most demanded buffs in the game, but we do have some important ones.<br>
Soe or sow the raid if the need calls for it.  Your Circle of Seasons or Protection of Seasons is the highest FR+CR &quot;spell&quot; in the game.  We have the highest regen spells int he game too, so regen your group (Regeneration, Regrowth, Replenish) especially the MT of your group to help save clerics mana.  Damage Shield your group when it calls for it, but &quot;always&quot; keep one on the Main melee of your group (especially now that it stacks with most mage ds's)  HitPoint buffs Potg line, Natureskin, etc.) when it applies (most do not stack with aego/virtue line so don't waste mana there) but your skin buffs have high hp, AC and hp+mana regens on them (and stacked with a symbol makes their total hp's higher than then virtue, but that is &quot;our&quot; secret, so shh cause if you let it out you'll be forced into buffing a whole raid)  which is why they are requested.  Then we have other spells that will be given as they are requested or as needed such as strength, invigor for stamina, PR, DR, MR, and cures etc., etc., you know them all.<br>
<br>
Fighting -<br>
First, our most important job will be to spam heal, and this will generate alot of hate for you and is why we will take alot of deaths.  Get used to it, you'll get rezzed after the fight so you can die again quickly the very next encounter.  Your nickname and mine from here on out is &quot;Patch&quot;, so just get used to that too.  You should be using your best and quickest heals.  I use natures infusion (near 2k 3.5 second cast heal) but we have natures touch, chloroblast, etc. whatever your pleasure)<br>
During the fights your role will be to keep others in the group alive, especially the clerics and enchanters.  The clerics will pretty much be targeted only on the MT and AT's, and the enchanters will pretty much be trying to mezz off any added mobs.  Keeping the clerics and enchanters alive means keeping the MT alive which means keeping the raid alive, even at the expense of your death, thanks for coming and get used to it.<br>
<br>
Debuffing-<br>
We have some very powerful debuffs and should be using them, even though most will never know that you play that role and thus never get any of the glory.  It is up to the druids in the raid to get together and figure out which ones they are going to cast and synchronize, so we aren't casting the same one.  Cancel Magic is one of the underutilized ones we should be casting early as it dispells some of the mobs buffs<br>
Eci', Hand of Ro(now named Immolation of Ro), and any or the Ro's Illumination spells all stack together.  This will lower the AC of the mob by at least 54 and the ATTK by 180 which means the mobs are dealing alot less damage.  These also stack with other char.s debuffs like shaman and enchanters.  Not to mention the massive FR and CR lowered.  You should cast this as early as you think you can without stealing aggro from the MT.  This successful debuff should be mentioned in Rsay on &quot;major&quot; mobs so the casters know which nukes they can cast more effectively.  Yes, they will most likely get the glory, and yes, this causes alot of aggro for yourself and you will absolutely die from time to time because of it.  Get used to it.<br>
<br>
Nukes and Dots - <br>
Mana permitting of course...always make sure you have enough for heals and evacs before using these.  But you are a major damage dealer.  You must be very certain which mobs you put dots on, and if it is mana efficient to do.  You don't want to put a 1 minute dot on a mob that is gonna be taken out in less than 20 secs...especially when you have a nuke that does near the same amount of damage for near same amount of mana used.  And definitely make sure you target the right one if you use it, as targetting a mezzed mob by mistake will be the death of you and others.  And long gone are the days of using your ESV's.  A Drones of Dune Dot for 350 damage over a whole minute on a 200k+hp mob is an absolute waste of time.  Magic based dots are usually the ones of choice if you decide to use them, especially knowing the fight will last awhile.  They seem to be resisted rarely (Drifting Death, Winged Death, or Swarming Death [240 a tick, yummy]) whichever ya got.  Your nukes tho are very powerful and you have some very significant ones to choose from depending on the mob, mana permitting.  These should be used alot more then dots while raiding,  and with crits can even be more mana efficient.  Be sure which debuffs are in so you know whether to cast Magic, Fire, or Cold nukes.  When nukeing you should never be casting early enough to ever steal aggro.  If you happen to ever gain aggro tho, do not run around all over screaming and waiting for a heal, just walk in a straight line back towards the MT while the mob is beating on you, and take the death that you know you deserve.  Perhaps the MT can gain aggro back before you die, but more then likely, not.  But you should be used to that by now anyway.<br>
<br>
That is pretty much it all we do, and evac peeps if the three week old bad lazagna runs right through ya and hits the fan.  AA's we should be focusing on we can save for another post..  Also, our BooBoos are not welcome at raids.  Yeah, the dark elf hottie thinks they are cute, but they can cause insta aggro on  mobs first AoE spell and wipe all the casters out.  Have you ever seen nothing but melee left standing to fight Tormax at full health, it ain't pretty.  Dire charm pets are the only pets we have welcome on raids.  So if you don't have that, you don't have a pet.  And then all your dark elf hotties belong to me.

one note about cancel, negate, annul magic.<br>
<br>
If others such as magi and chanters are debuffing, this might not be the best idea.  I can't count the amount of times I caught ppl annuling Malo...and that is no fun for anyone, cept the mob maybe.  If you see a debuff call, for the love of god don't start annuling, thx <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=523387"> Baron Drannor Soulslinger, 59 Conjurer</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

VERY true, and I think not many druids do this. I live by these calls and will nuke accordingly. When there is no call, what's the point of you even debuffing?<br>

However, for &quot;raid&quot; purposes, I'd like to hear your input on some of the ones your looking to train in, and why.  Here are some of the ones I think would be most beneficial for raids, and in order of importance.<br>
<br>
Radiant Heals-<br>
Spirit of the Wood.<br>
Mass Group Buff<br>
Healing Adept<br>
Healing Gift<br>
Spell Casting Reinforcement.<br>
Spell Casting Fury3<br>
<br>
Radiant Cures are great, cure all kinds of poisons, diseases, and curses.  And can be reused every 3 minutes.  Also, there are some mob aoe's that render casters unable to cast anything for a period.  With this aa we can still hit it and be able to cure the melee in our groups of slows, etc. while we are still unable to cast.<br>
<br>
Mass Group Buff will be important in upper raiding not for pre buffs, but for Raid buffing Spirit of the Wood for the insane regen that generates.  Having 5 Druids with this, plus a Beastlord or two with a similar aa, will allow us to some higher encounters we are not capable of atm, but we are close.  You having these aa's will decide when we are ready.
