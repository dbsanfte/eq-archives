<br>
Ok I am starting the diologue on our Raiding rules and guidelines.  This is a living document - I will change and add to it extensivly.  I know that Arielyn, Horro and Pensfan all have some great stuff to input as well as many others.<br>
<br>
RL = Raid Leader<br>
GL = Group Leader<br>
MA = Main assist <br>
MT = Main Tank<br>
AT = Alternate Tank<br>
SA = Secondary Assist<br>
ML = Master Looter<br>
MP = Main Peeler (non standard term - most just call it peeler)<br>
<br>
- RL is IN CHARGE<br>
<br>
- RL gives directions - don't take it personal but follow it!<br>
<br>
- ASSIST MA - ASSIST MA - ASSIST MA! sometimes the MA and MT are ussualy the same person but it might be differant and often is the puller. So sometimes even the MT has to have an assist hotkey <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  But when a Main Assist has been determined - stick with it. If you don't stay on the same target as the MA you will break mez/ gain aggro and this is bad.  Makes it hard on the healers and will lose your enchanter/necro/bard (they either quit thru frustration or get killed) if you keep breaking mez.<br>
<br>
- Tank Mez = there are un mezable/un slowable / un rootable (depends) targets; so often there needs to be a designated person to get aggro and hold aggro for the target that must be meleed away from main group.  Often a pet can be used as a tank mezzer of varying success.<br>
<br>
- MA is the only person Melee and nukers will assist and choose targets with unless directed otherwise by the RL. Also depends on when Nukes/ and Debuffs are allowed to be cast.  Sure there are PLENTY of times that the RL might not be able to keep up with all action so feel free to do on the spot crowd control if needed<br>
<br>
- Crowd control:  Most well done pulls should only give us 1 to 2 adds if any.  Crowd control is a tricky game.  Make sure that if you are in an area that has high probability of adds that you understand the crowd control plan.  One enchanter might not be enough to do all on their own - Pet classes will use pets to tank mez when needed.  Roots and slows can be cast while the chanters (if any)  can get around to landing mezzes.  There are some amazing things that can be done with good crowd control.<br>
<br>
-AT - Alternate tank - this is the designated tank to tank mez an add.  Heck any melee MIGHT turn into the designated AT after a death.  There may be more available but unless the AT has aggro issues or there are more than 1 non mez / root adds prolly won't designate.  The AT is the designated hitter to take aggro if necessary.  If there is no Adds then the AT just fights with the group and takes aggro if needed (MT down / healers LOM)<br>
<br>
- SA is Ussually the AT BUT there are times when he may not be.  The SA is a common person that the RL will call on to tank mez a target.  The Reason for an SA is that Nukers and defuffers will need to have a quick target ready to target the 2nd mob in line.  Depending on whether the Add summons will determine how much the support classes can take care of the add before the main battle moves to the add.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Regardless if a SA is put to work you can be sure that he will be targeted on the next mob to fight.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
- Main Peeler needs to be designated. The MP is commonly a Ranger, Pally, or Shadow Knight due to their taunting hit rate combined with their Spell line - Beast Lord could do this very well too depending on pet control.  The MP is the one the RL will call to Peel the an enraged target off of a caster.  If the Wiz, druid, sham or cleric gets aggro they are probably going to need a peeler to save them.  Necro, mage and enchanters can ussually either Mez or pet tank their aggroed Mob- maybe a shaman could do this too.  If you can't get a root off on the aggroed mob -casters - please go near the fighting so the MP can find you.  Regardless - THE MP will either go when called or will do it on his own if the Aggroed caster is in his group.  ANY GL can call for the Peeler as the RL will not have a good view of all action all the times and may not pick up on a fast aggroed MOb.  Heck any caster that gains aggro can announce it to the raid channel as soon as they get aggroed. If you wait to announce it - you may be dead.  WHEN ANNOUNCED - ONLY THE MP goes to gain aggro.  Unless RL calls otherwise MP goes all else stay on may target - if even more than 1 person leaves the main target - you might get a wipepout.  Depending on zone you might need more than one of these.<br>
<br>
- Grouping arrangement will be decided by the RL you might not think it is the way you would do it - but be sure, the RL has a reason for setting it up that way.<br>
<br>
- You might not get exp ONCE during raid. You might lose exp overall during the raid.  Raids are for items that are not likely to be obtained thru single group arrangements.<br>
<br>
- sign into raid channel even if your current graphic settings can't allow you to read the messages (BTW if this is a problem - it can be fixed by changing your color settings and you can also change your font size to make it easier to read - all this is explained in your eq manuel supplimant on your hardrive) This allows the RL to track players on the raid.<br>
<br>
- Kiting - we in TF use kiting against adds more than other guilds and players.  This a great tactic for a player to hold aggro and kite the mob in circles around the group until it can be handled.  There will be times where this will work.  Then in some dungeons we will just not have the manueverability to pull this off.  Watch for instructions on this - depending on zone.<br>
<br>
- Even tho raids are demanding and sometimes emotional for folks - they are Hella fun - I enjoy going on raids even when I know that I will get poor exp and the drops will not be for me. Sooner or later the raid that we go on will benefit your class. For example I went on a raid into TOFS and while lots of blades drop there - it is mostly stuff good for youngling players/alts vs the folks that can raid there.  There are some great caster items that drop there; But that place is a blast and it turns out that there was a good helmet I ended up getting from there after all.<br>
<br>
I have more to follow... will add later<br>

The only things I would have to add would be the following:<br>
<br>
- Participation. If we don't get people that want to actively take part in guild events we will basically stop having them. Last night people had the opportunity to go to COM with RDoF or Mistmoore with Wardens. Only 2 of us went to COM and 1 of us made it to MM. Why is this? This is going to be the single most important aspect as far as I'm concerned especially with people starting to do epics and needing people for epic encounters.<br>
<br>
- Listening. You must listen to the assist calls and when to jump into a fray. If you don't listen chances are you will get a reputaion and will not be welcome to an event.<br>
<br>
- Raid planning. I have some thoughts on how to go about suggesting and planing raid locations in the future which I will bring up at the officers meeting this month.<br>
<br>
I will probly have more to add after further raids.<br>

<br>
- if you come to a raid expect to die at least once[Maybe 3 times]. That way if you dont die its a bonus but if you do you dont get pissed and leave the raid especially when you could be a major part in making or breaking the raid.<br>

- A good Idea for raid rule is to bring some money for yourself! So that the necros and stuff can get coffins{if needed}, <br>
<br>
- and dont expect to get everything u want either.<br>
<br>
- Its very very confusing out there espescially for the person whos in charge! So calm down if you dont get everything u want right then and there. <br>

- all no drop are rolled on by interested players on drop<br>
- All droppable are collected by ML per group and worthwhile drops are given to RL to hold.  This goes for a jewels and stuff too.<br>
<br>
- at end of the raid all (good) items held by RL are rolled on in one of a couple formats <br>
<br>
* one roll by all players and they take their pick from the top<br>
* NBG rolls on each item (various rules - Sometimes every item will be available for roll by all players sometimes once you get one item you are out - depends on amount of players and loot ussually first loot on droppable takes you out of the rest of the droppables)<br>
* peeps sign up for the item they want to roll for and then they are assigned numbers [1 thru 8 and then the RL can random 1 8 and then whom ever had that number gets the loot (Faddo / Neul's way)]<br>
<br>
Our raids have not been about money gain for players thus Droppable are generally about NBG - A perfect example would be When the Helm dropped in UP - we could have done an all roll on it and a non melee coulda sold that helm for between 10 and 15k (or more). But we offered it to just the warriors to roll on even tho (I think) it was actually cleric usable as well. That was a call I made as RL. I offered to let the clerics roll on the no drop bracer but they declined<br>
<br>
When I ML pick up raids or groupings - I hand out all sub 10 plat items as they drop in a circuit thru all players present - In Acrylia Caverns I hand out all droped weaps in a cycle and when I get the same amount of acrylia bricks as there are players I hand 1 out per. I split all stacked runes at Raids end or when peeps leave I give them a share.  There are LOTS of ways to ML - there is also the opportunity to have the ML sell all the stuff to merchant and split cash... depends on the loot table.<br>
<br>
our track record on plat split has been pretty poor - but I try to do this right if we are in a zone where plat drops (rare)<br>
<br>
When we raid CoM I will have to draw out the loot rights thing I suppose so no one gets let down - only the druids and rangers will get to roll on the jade reavers if they drop. After any ( PLEASE) reavers are rolled on by the rangers and druids presant - all other loot (if any) can be rolled on by all players (that did not get a reaver) interested in those drops - unless there is a very obvoius NBG player. Hmm I will have to tweak my thoughts on this and post a similar post on my CoM raid thread. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/useranotf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SeranoTF</A> at: 9/17/02 2:24:59 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubigemnoseandhow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>bigemnose andhow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/13/02 5:30:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftribalfury31319frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=7>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: raids</span><hr size=1> What you have described sounds very fare, so you have Jemand Verbieten's support on these raid rules.<br>

Now that you've described the role, it makes sense.<br>
<br>
Loot rules are a little more complicated than I'm used to in our Raids/Practice Raids, but seem as fair as they can possibly be with so many persons involved.<br>
<br>
What gave me a chuckle is that your Raid Rules are remarkably similar to the rules Prallic and I &quot;invented&quot; for the original Regular Sunday Blitz!  If you have access to Torture's Member section you can see where I copied them over from the old Board.<br>
<br>
I'd add one thing:  ONE ROTTEN APPLE SPOILS THE BARREL.  Don't be the one to ruin our attitudes by bitching, griping, or complaining about (pick one): that person's rules, choice of loot, death, camp, route to camp, choice of mob, downtime, or boredom.  Raids have a GOAL.  Nerve's Epic Raid was a beautiful example:  2 hours set up, 15 minutes implimentation, sucessful drops, NO DEATHS.  *tah-dah*<br>
<br>
Don't be the one to suggest every 10 minutes to move the camp or relocate to another zone.  Don't cry and whine for 20 minutes on a public channel because we got SWAMPED by 15 mobs and couldn't bail your hindquarters out while we were busy dying.  Stick with the Raid Groups, and remember that there is a GOAL.<br>
<br>
And my biggest gripe:  if you can't be on time, DON'T GO.  I've seen several raids get held up so someone could run back and guide someone in.  It's never good: some folks get bored and silly (attention span drops to nil) and many times someone DIES for lack of a full group escort.  Prallic and I have a hard time making it to Thursday Raids because of time zones, but we've never asked for an escort to the camp because of this very fact.<br>
<br>
[Serano : I encourage all raid leaders to publish whether their raid will be open to late commers or not.  Ussualy depends on See invis mobs.  FYI any raid I Lead in ME / UP is late commers welcome - where as Raids in CoM/SEB/ Hole will be show up late at own risk - no elements from the main raid force will assist you in getting to the raid.]<br>
<br>
Argh, didn't mean to rant, sorry.  I really meant to support everything said thus far *blush* (daggone bards, can't shaddup)<br>
<br>
I do look forward to raiding with more experienced groups who can educate me as to my best role there.  Eventually, I want my epic too!  <br>

While I don't totally agree with a point system, I think it is less flawed than the everyone that can use, roll system.  There are certain ppl that make or break a raid. Those ppl are typically the main tank, main cleric, main chanter, main puller, secondary assist, and main buff/debuff. Having said that, if an items drops that one of those ppl can use and is better than what they currently wield or wear the item should be awarded to them. If they have better, then the item in question should be awarded to the next person in line based on a combination of lvl and attendance to guild raids (items need to be earned, not just handed out because you show up at 1 out of 10 raids and can use it). This system in the long haul will make the guild much stronger for raiding purposes, which will enable all to ultimately raid better places and gain better items.<br>
<br>
There is a lvl limit on raids for a reason ppl. If you are below the lvl limit and decide that you still want to join a raid, great, consider your reward raiding experience, you should not expect loot until all others of the appropriate lvl for the raid have a better item than what may drop, period.<br>
<br>
The above applies only to guild specific raids of course, as we cannot determine for other guilds what the loot rules should be for joint raids, for fairness a different system needs to be devised.<br>
<br>
To qualify my first statement in the post (since I did mention main puller as a make or break person, and that person usually being a monk), for our guild I consider Kunglao a much better dungeon puller than myself, therefore I do not fit into the make or break catagory, and expect nothing, but will be at every raid possible.<br>
<br>
I here NBG thrown around a lot, but don't think that roll if you can use truly accomplishes this.<br>
<br>
Some may agree, some may strongly disagree. All opinions are welcome, I have thick skin =).<br>

I'm just stating that I don't think that roll if you can use accomplishes NBG. I guess it all depends on how you define NBG though. If it is defined as needed to help out in everyday grouping and xping, then I'd say it does. If it is defined as needed to help the guild raid better it fails this task miserably. Depends on what the priorities of the guild are. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><br><br><a self href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftribalfury31319frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=16><img src=http://www.tribalfury.com/images/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftribalfury31319frm13.emailToFriend?topicID=28.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftribalfury31319frm13.threadControl?topicID=28.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftribalfury31319frm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=28.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftribalfury31319frm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=28.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="tribalfury31319frm8">Open Discussion<option value="tribalfury31319frm9">Class Specific Discussion<option value="tribalfury31319frm16">Alliance Discussions<option value="tribalfury31319frm10">Polling Station<option value="tribalfury31319frm13">Raid Discussion<option value="tribalfury31319frm14">Quest Discussion<option value="tribalfury31319frm15">Tribal Honorees<option value="tribalfury31319frm11">/Auction<option value="tribalfury31319frm12">Trade Skill Discussion<option value="tribalfury31319frm17">General Members<option value="tribalfury31319frm18">Officers Lounge<option value="tribalfury31319frm19">Epic Progress<option value="tribalfury31319frm20">Humor</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/btribalfury31319>Tribal Fury</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftribalfury31319frm13>Raid Discussion</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.tribalfury.com">Tribal Fury Home</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
