<br>
I loved Velious and the way its encounters were implimented, but everything I've read about high level SOL makes me never want to play again.<br>
<br>
I can understand SOE's point of view.. kinda..  /played is probably the biggest difference between the average player and the 'uber' player.  <br>
<br>
Velious was fun as hell, but look how accessable it became.  As time consuming as it was, guilds of average players were able to eventually do things the things that uber guilds were capable of, creating the conflict that eventually followed every EQ release -- fights over planes, trak/vs, and velious boss mobs including tov and ntov.<br>
<br>
I think that SOE really wanted to create content that top guilds would have to themselves, that would be a massive challenge to acheive, that would truly separate the average player from the uber player and perhaps keep them from conflicts.<br>
<br>
Obviously high level EQ doesn't have a high barrier of entry in terms of skill.  It's about being competent, equipped, having time and knowing the strategy.  The strats don't stay secret for very long, and once leaked, spread like mad. <br>
<br>
What was said for skill can also be applied to intelligence.  Using quests with tough puzzles doesn't work as they tend to be spoiled so quickly.<br>
<br>
SOE couldn't make encounters require more skill or brains so they made them more time consuming, pushing the true barrier of entry of the elite up another notch. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucerosofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceros of Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 618<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/29/02 10:32:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2472.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Interesting Point of View on SoL and timesinks.</span><hr size=1> I don't mean to say that there is no such thing as skill in EQ.

<br>
That was reflected in IV as well -- we did most encounters with fewer people, lower levels, and less equipment than most guilds.<br>
<br>
However, skill in EQ is easily substituted with competence and numbers.<br>
<br>
EQ actually required much more skill just over a year ago before they implemented the connection changes that allowed for more people to participate in raids, facilitating zerg tactics for those without skill.  There was a finite number of people you could have on raids, allowing encounters to be tuned for a certain number of players. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/utotteswede.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TotteSwede</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 378<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/30/02 6:33:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2472.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Interesting Point of View on SoL and timesinks.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

Couldn´t agree less with you. SoL has some very tricky battles that you definately can't solve with zerg and really don´t become a lot easier even with a spoiler (Hi Shei Vinitras <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). Velious was an easy expansion when it comes to strategy, SoL isn't...<br>

It was one of the reasons I came back to EQ after my hiatus.  SoV, while decent, totally made me sick of EQ.  SoL is very nice for single groups and I like it a lot.  My only beef with SoL is the new spells like KEI dropping off uberguild encounters.<br>
<br>
The 5-6 Ubermobs that FoH is whining about (and they whine about everything) won't ever be seen by 95% of the playerbase.  What's the point of trying to please this whiny bunch of babies?  95% of us just want a game where we can log on for 4 hours, have fun with people and log off.<br>
<br>
95% of the population isn't sweating the fact that you need 90 people and 1000s of hours to get a key that in the long run means nothing but virtual dick status in a virtual game.  If the ubers are sweating over it, tough, find another game.  I'm sure VI and EQ will still be chugging along np.<br>
<br>
So don't worry about uber mob encounters or saving these chair jockeys from 100's of hours to make a quest key more common so that less than 1% of the playerbase will even attempt VI UNTIL YOU FIX THE CRAP LIKE THE BAZAAR AND FEATURES THAT YOU PROMISED!  QUIT PATRONIZING THE NO LIFERS BECAUSE THEIR MONEY WILL RUN OUT SOON ANYWAY.  <br>

Support the people who use less resources and pay the same amount, the people who log on for fun, not a job. <p>Herder

That's way more people than 5%. Also if Verant would do something about the 4-5 month camping green shit stuff, then maybe the remaining percentage of the EQ population would care to check out other zones. Fine, you say you don't want it, because you like to live in Seb. There is nothing wrong with that, but you can't say that everybody else wants to do the same thing. I'm pretty sure there are level 40 people who would love to see Emperor, but because other guilds trying to get keys for 6 months they don't see a way to get there. If uberguilds would get their shit and move on, they would get bored of the high level content and the level 40 dude could get his key, level up and check it out for himself. Content should be made availabe to everybody, this is entertainment, you pay for the whole thing. You should get the whole thing. You would be upset if you would go to the movies and they would blow up the projector at halfway and they would say sorry it has problems, we cannot show you the rest of the movie for 6 months, but we also don't give you your money back, however when you wanna see the other half you will still have to pay for it to see it.<br>
<br>
On another note you can't say that VI said SoL was geared towards single groups when they put in mobs with 2mill HP and 2 AEs, they might have said that a big part of the expansion is geared towards group stuff, but not exclusively. Some people like grouping and XPing, some people despise that shit. <br>
<br>
Anyway you can raid a lot while working 9-5, I know tons of people who do it, so having no life and playing EQ has a very little to do with each other. If there are people who are on all day because they can afford it they can't do jack shit by themselves cause the other half of the guild is in the active workforce, so they will have to wait till everybody logs on. <p><font size=-3>[Worthless Class] Rezilaturb (Tubby Bitch)<br>

<br>
Uberguilds help give each server its own mythology, both good and bad, its own Legends, famous and infamous.<br>
<br>
The top guilds do things that many other players dream of, that other players aspire to acheive.  How many players in the top guilds of Vaz were lowbies on another server watching the top guilds kill naggy/trak/etc?<br>
<br>
More importantly to SOE, other players read and listen to what the top guilds say, and that helps to shape their opinion of the game.<br>
<br>
If the most dedicated players are saying that the end-game sucks, that diminishes the game for much of the rest of the population and they become less motivated to acheive the same things.  Once EverQuest loses its acheivement driven mystique, people stop playing.<br>
<br>
It's the same reason that Nvidia and ATI care so much about the high end video card market.  Most people do not buy $500 Geforce 4 Ti4600's, they buy MX based cards.  Still, the opinions of those who do buy the top cards, those who write about the top cards matters immensely.<br>

SoV was enjoyed by most top guilds, they were excited about the encounters and item drops, and I think that really motivated other players to play more.  It generated excitement about the game.  For SoL, it's been the opposite.<br>

It's also in SOE's best interests to keep dedicated players away from the average EQ players.  EQ sucks for the player who plays 20 hours a week when he has to compete with the players who play 50 hours a week for the same mobs.

At least by the top guilds..  that's how I remember it at least, and I was paying a lot of attention to such things at the time, especially regarding Soul Assassins on Lanys which took Trak down pretty quickly relative to some older servers.<br>

Anyways everything I said there, plus while I agree that they would be replaced, thats not the point.  The fact that they quit would still be horrible PR for verant.  mmogs are goal oriented, and while maybe only 5% of people will see the end game stuff realisticly, you cant assume everyone has realistic expectations.  Im willing to bet many more than 5% consider the high end game among thier goals, and are concerned with its development.  Just look at how many random level 50s post on all the high end content threads, heh.  If the 5% say it sucks, not worth the time, as soon as x comes out we are gone, it will effect more than just themselves.  <br>
<br>
And honestly the no lives ect ect rhetoric gets pretty tiresome, enspecially considering that the time sinks are not really dependent on spending alot of time in a row, they are almost all the xp camps that you love so much.  If it was clearing pog to get a key you might have a case, but theres really nothing logically requiring that you have no life to camp a key. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uciliemvaz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ciliem Vaz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/30/02 5:10:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2472.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/cil2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Interesting Point of View on SoL and timesinks.</span><hr size=1> The point of the timesinks is to keep the guilds busy.  It's the same reason they make you clear PoF or PoG before you attempt Tunare or CT, because it keeps you busy for longer.  If you consider it, it's actually intelligent and makes the game more fun for everyone.<br>
<br>
Obviously, there are a few select guilds with the most &quot;raw power&quot; and these are the guilds now that just go rape whatever nameds are rumored to be up and take the most content away from others who might need to gather in advance.  <br>
<br>
What they are trying to avoid, in my view, is Lodizal.  These are the mobs that take seconds to kill, occupy nobody for very long , yet drop awesome loot.  These mobs have never kept anyone busy for any real period of time and just get assraped as soon as they pop.  If you put in a timesink then you occupy a group of people (like Triton for example) that would be blowing up every named the second after it pops.  If you are not in the top guild on your server, then the timesinks are giving you opportunities you may have never had access to before.  <br>
<br>
Before you complain, remember, nobody has to do this stuff -- its like the VP key.  Go, or don't go, but if you're -really- uber... It's an appeal to the macho side of these 'we've done it all' guilds.  Of course they will do it, but they realize its costing them and they think about how many nameds they could have broken off...<br>
