<br>
If the man who wrote this ran for PRESIDENT I would VOTE for him.<br>
<br>
I like big cars, big boats, big motorcycles, big houses, and big campfires. I believe the money I make belongs to me and my family, not some governmental stooge with a bad comb-over who wants to give it away to crack addicts for squirting out babies.<br>
<br>
Guns do not make you a killer. I think killing makes you a killer. You can kill someone with a baseball bat or a car, but no one is trying to ban you from driving to the ball game.<br>
<br>
I believe they are called the Boy Scouts for a reason, that is why there are no girls allowed. Girls belong in the Girl Scouts.<br>
<br>
I think that if you feel homosexuality is wrong, it is not a phobia, it is an opinion. I don't think being a minority makes you a victim of anything except numbers. The only things I can think of that are truly discriminatory are things like the United Negro College Fund, Jet Magazine, Black Entertainment Television, and Miss Black America. Try to have things like the United Caucasian College Fund, Cloud Magazine, White Entertainment Television, or Miss White America and see what happens. Jesse Jackson will be knocking down your door.<br>
<br>
I have the right &quot;NOT&quot; to be tolerant of others because they are different, weird, or tick me off. When 70% of the people who get arrested are black, in cities where 70% of the population is black, that is not racial profiling, it is the law of statistics.<br>
<br>
I know what sex is, and there are not varying degrees of it. If I received sex from one of my subordinates in my office, it wouldn't be a private matter or my personal business. I would be &quot;FIRED&quot; immediately!<br>
<br>
I believe that if you are selling me a milk shake, a pack of cigarettes, a newspaper or a hotel room, you must do it in English. As a matter of fact, if you want to be an American citizen you should speak English. My father and grandfather shouldn't have to die in vain so you can leave the countries you were born in to come over and disrespect ours.<br>
<br>
I think the police should have every right to shoot your sorry ass if you threaten them after they tell you to stop. If you can't understand the word &quot;freeze&quot; or &quot;stop&quot; in English, see the above lines.<br>
<br>
I feel much safer letting a machine with no political affiliation recount votes when needed.<br>
<br>
I know what the definition of lying is.<br>
<br>
I don't think just because you were not born in this country, you are qualified for any special loan programs, government sponsored bank loans or tax breaks etc., so you can open a hotel, coffee shop, trinket store, or any other business.<br>
<br>
We did not go to the aid of certain foreign countries and risk our lives in wars to defend their freedoms so that decades later they could come over here and tell us our constitution is a living document and open to their interpretations.<br>
<br>
I don't hate the rich. I don't pity the poor. I know wrestling is fake, but so are movies and television, and that doesn't stop you from watching them. I believe a self-righteous liberal or conservative with a cause is more dangerous than a Hell's Angel with an attitude.<br>
<br>
I think Bill Gates has every right to keep every penny he made and continue to make more. If it ticks you off, go and invent the next operating system that's better and put your name on the building. Ask your buddy that invented the Internet to help you.<br>
<br>
It doesn't take a whole village to raise a child right, but it does take a parent to stand up to the kid and smack his little ass when necessary and say &quot;NO.<br>
<br>
&quot; I think tattoos and piercing are fine if you want them, but please don't pretend they are a political statement. And stay home until that new lip ring heals, I don't want to look at your ugly infected mouth as you serve me fries.<br>
<br>
I am sick of &quot;Political Correctness&quot; and of all the suck ups that go along with it. I know a lot of black people, and not a single one of them was born in Africa, so how can they be &quot;African-Americans&quot;? Besides, Africa is a continent. I don't go around saying I am a European-American because my great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather was from Europe. I am proud to be from America and nowhere else.<br>
<br>
And if you don't like my point of view, tough!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>

You ask that all people in this country must speak english, well who are you to fucking say what language another person should speak. You think that everyone should keep every penny you make, well we just wont pay you as much and give the government their fare share. I don't know what your economic background is, but if you knew a clitoris from a horses ass you would know that a government without money is no government at all. Lack of government leads to anarchy, which leads to your unalienable rights being stripped from you by joeshmoe who thinks he deserves your shit. You speak of a police force, but without someone paying taxes there is no police force, unless you want towns to be owned by entrepenuers (or is that to big a word for you?). I don't know how you see this country, but you can come out of the woods and come to the real world anytime. I don't know how you feel about actions such as September 11, but i can tell you with your &quot;vision&quot; there would be a lot more acts such as this. <br>
<br>
But back to your no taxes idea. You speak of electing a president to a government that you wish to give no money to....kinda ironic dont you think? Id hate to be in your country, and i dont honestly think you are a patriot at all for your anti constitution ideals.<br>
<br>
To your police force being able to shoot anyone for any gesture of violence. We call this Marshall Law, and i don't know if you like being shot for walking in a &quot;threatening&quot; manor towards a ficticious police force...cuz thats right YOU DONT WANT TO PAY TAXES!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
I hope evolution finally hits you with a thinking block my friend, cuz i pray for the state, city and family you call yourself a part of.<br>

Can't be anymore accurate.  But they fail to point out that &quot;minorities&quot; don't think that because they are a &quot;minority&quot; they are held down,  they believe and have evidence that it has to do w/ their race, sex, religion and/or culture.<br>

Already out there.  They're called CBS, NBC, ABC etc.  Don't see a whole lot of &quot;minorities&quot; on these stations.  Can anyone guess why?  Servey says!  Because their culture represents a &quot;minority&quot; of viewers so they don't pull in the big bucks!  Hence &quot;minorities&quot; ARE a victim of numbers!<br>

Wow, I was unaware that we had a city w/ a 70% African-American representation....I know Detroit is pretty close, but I doubt they're at 70%.  If you want to include the law of statistics, might as well count how many white cops there are out there while your at it.<br>
<br>
I am in no way saying most cops are racist, but racial profiling is a major part of law enforcement whether anyone wants to admit it or not.<br>
<br>
Example :<br>
<br>
You see a group of Hispanics on the corner dressed in baggy clothes passing something around, your damn right a cop is going to be looking into whats going on there.<br>
<br>
Then you see a group of white guys on a corner in baggy clothes doing the same thing....think about it.<br>

This is what really got me reading this post.  The person implies that if a person lived in poverty and had no chance for an education to speak multiple languages including English (which happens to be one of the most difficult languages to grasp), then they shouldn't become part of the &quot;Melting pot&quot;?!?  They don't have the right to come here and try to make a better life for their children?!  They are somehow &quot;disrespecting&quot; our country by not learning English?!?<br>
<br>
Maybe it's just me, but I thought our country was founded on freedom of religion and freedom of speech, as well as letting in a wide variety of cultures/races/religions, hence the nickname &quot;melting pot&quot;.<br>

Yep, lets just go shooting people up, sounds like a good idea to me *spits into a spitune*, what do you say Billy Bob?<br>

Yeah, this is the exact reason police have non-lethal weapons to subdue people, ie. pepperspray, tazers, tear gass.  Just because you don't understand English doesn't mean you should be shot.<br>

Is it that bad that someone doesn't want to be referred to by the fucking color of their skin?!  <br>

A little cultural lesson for the dense.  &quot;African-Americans&quot; ancestors came from Africa.  They came from a different &quot;culture&quot; than other people.  Therefore they celebrate their culture and are proud to be called &quot;African-Americans&quot; because that IS their heritage.<br>
<br>
Don't like it?!  Go around calling &quot;African-Americans&quot; N* and see how long you live.<br>
<br>
Don't you think that a sentance like, &quot;Hey honey, look at the dress that African-American is wearing, isn't it beautiful?&quot; sound better and less &quot;hokie&quot; than, &quot;Hey honey, look at that Black Person's dress, i'n it purty?&quot;<br>

Mr Presient - Well it simple , we have nuke before them so just nuke them to the ground.<br>

Mr general - But sir , wont we kill innocent people over there in Iraq.<br>

Mr Presient - They are not innocent , if they were they would not support a ruler like Saddam Hussein.  We told them to stop and they didnt , time to shoot them down for not listenning.  <br>

YOU WOMEN OUT THERE! LEAVE AUGUSTA AND OTHER PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS THE FUCK ALONE!<br>
LOOK, if you really believe in political correctness, your full of SHIT.  Thier is NO such thing.   It doesnt exist in real life, it shouldnt exist in movies or books.  Im not offended when their isnt any guys in a movie, Im not offended when their are no white people in movies.  I DONT CARE!  LEAVE PEOPLE ALONE!<br>
You too Pita.  With your goddam veggie burgers.  get the hell out of minnesota, who gives a shit if thier is a pita sausage running next to other sausages, it means nothing.  <br>
I dont see guys getting into WNBA, I dont see guys getting into LPGA.  So, Why? why do women feel the need to get into NBA or PGA or join private male clubs.  The dumb dike on CNN says, &quot;augusta national is spending millions of dollars to discriminate against women.&quot;  You know what? SHUT UP!  Its not your club, they are not discriminating anything, its not your club, they allow the to play on the course, but if they dont want your sorry double bogie ass their, then shut it and leave.  Bill Gates didnt get into Augusta, why? cuz he sucked, NOT because he was male, not because he was a billionaire.  And, Im not saying women suck at golf, but I am saying, if the people in Augusta dont want women in their PRIVATE club, why do they cry and whine about &quot;unfair.&quot;  And if you wanted in the goddam club so bad, why didnt you do anyting about it when the Masters and golf in general was not on its peak.  Your only doing this to make some dumbass statement.  Go back to the dishes you dumb dike, and be happy with how far women have come, stop pushing the envelope and enjoy yourselfs.  The world isnt created equal.  I cant do things women can, woman cant do everything men can, it just wasnt meant to be.  Now leave it alone, god I hate people.<br>
