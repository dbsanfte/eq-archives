I am lothe to post here, nor did I intend to post here on this individual, but after a certain threat he made on our boards, I have decided I am left with little choice. This is my post, not endorsed or supported (well, it might be supported, but I haven't told anyone I am doing this) by our GL or BDL.<br><br>The Dethen story is very long and drawn out. Dethen originally seemed to be a very nice young man. He came to my aid and Bryre's rescue in the bowels of Sol A long ago. Eventually our paths crossed again and this time he was guidless and expressed interest in joining our guild. He was allowed in and eventually managed to convince Corwyne to make him a Recruitment Officer. He seemed to handle himself well and be very nice, but did have some outlandish tales.<br><br>His best known recruit was one that ended up cussing Raene of Crossroads out in game. Our GL came here, posted a public apology (and first post he ever made here) to her and booted the recruit out of the Guild. Dethen was reprimanded for not screening recruits better and we thought the issue was resolved.<br><br>Shortly there after, while 4 of us were hunting in GD, he trains a wolf and a giant on us while we are already fighting two mobs. He dies, right before he gets close to us, but close enough so that we are aggroed by the mobs and practically wiped out. What ensued after was a terrible arguement. Before Dethen could be removed from the Guild, he removed himself.<br><br>His excuse for not zoning was that he knew he would die, so he brought them to us so we could save him. But he never once said in /gu he was in trouble and needed help or did a /y, he simply ran up to us, died before we even really saw what was happening and then we were busy fighting. He then supplied the following excuses as to why he didn't train us: his video card was lagging him, his connection was lagging him, his computer was causing him problems, it was our group enchanters fault, the zone lagged him badly and he didn't see us there (though, he was there with us previously). His excuses for his actions changed and became contradictory, which is really the whole reason we started to get angry over the issue.<br><br>What finally topped it all of was: <br><br>We were finally forced to put him on ignore because he would not stop telling us how it was everything elses fault and he had no responsibility in the matter at all and every one of us was wrong for being angry.<br><br>Over the course of the next couple of months, he has friends, guildies, aquaintances, strangers continue to send us tells relaying messages for him about how he wants to talk and be forgiven.<br><br>So, I don't know about the others, but I take him off ignore, tell him he is forgiven, but, I want nothing more to do with him and put him back on ignore.<br><br>He eventually explains that he shares his account with a younger individual who logs on as him and plays his character regularly, but doesn't always perform in his reputations best interest and explains that none of the bad things that happened were his fault, because it wasn't him.<br><br>Time passes, more tells from more people. Then we start getting tells from his alts. We ingore his alts, saying we just don't want anything more to do with him. Our ignore lists start to fill up with his alts.<br><br>A Guide is petitioned and gives us the method to properly record this happening and goes to talk to him, out of pity for us.<br><br>A couple of nights ago we run into Dethen in KC. I'm having troubles going link-dead constantly for some reason. We have a couple of bad pulls, some others have some bad pulls, there are lots of trains that night. We pull 4 to 5 trains ourselves due to getting corpses since the 10 people at the zone are sitting there and not pulling the front mobs or helping, but complaining about the trains being pulled to get corpses. Anyway, we are blamed for all trains that happen in KC that night (specifically Bryre - woot, you go girl. KC Sucks!). Fine, we're okay with that, we got our corpses, finished up what we were doing that night and logged.<br><br>Dethen comes to our open forums and posts. He's essentially told we aren't interested in letting him back in the Guild and aren't interested in having dealings with him and he explodes about we are all evil and satan worshippers (Our GL posted and invited him to our next virgin sacrifice..shesh), etc.<br><br>And then he says (the whole reason I just nearly killed everyone with the boredom of this post), and I quote from our board:<br><br>&quot;Think hard this may effect your place in either the skys or the underground and your guilds fate cuz if you keep this bull up I will personally enforce your bad rep along with many others if they ever bring your guild up. Good bye.&quot;<br><br>I don't know enough about him to know if he actually can harm the reputation that BDL is working on. I doubt he can, but he has been in many, many guilds and you never know.<br><br>I believe this post belongs here because if anyones reputation should be harmed it should either be his or mine, not BDL's. So, I'll just leave it for wiser heads to decide.<br><br>______________________________<br>Kahryne Desharra<br>Black Death Legion Senior Officer<br>51st Level Channeler of the Misplace Spell <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umaldar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maldar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#333333>(1/23/02 7:49:21 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Dethen Valiant Saga - Long Version</span><hr size=1> Kahryne,<br><br>  All of the dealings I have had with you and your guild-mates have been extremely honorable and forthright.

Maybe it's because they can't find a guild that fits them right.  I think (hope?) this is the case with most.  Others, however, guild-hop because they can't control themselves, and are unable to keep themselves welcome in a good guild.  It sounds like Dethen is one of that second group.

I'm of the opinion that if you go to camp an item that two people need, you at least TRY to stay long enough for both to get their item. That being said here is my first experience with Dethen that soured me upon him.<br><br>A druid friend of mine asked me if I wanted to go to MM to help another friend of hers get the hilt to the soulfire. Being the kind of person that likes to help friends and try out new quests I said sure. Not sure how Dethen got included in this but he got added to the little excursion which gave us 2 Paladins. To make a long story short the hilt dropped, Dethen won the roll and within 5 minutes something came up and he had to log. of course he left when our warrior was dragging someones body to the zone and we got overwhelmed and 2 people died in the process. Of course a who all Dethen showed him progressing across the zones to seems whatever came up either disappeard or just never existed.<br><br>I've run into him since then and each time I run into him I seem to like him less and less.<br><br>Taglos, Ranger of 51 seasons<br>unguilded <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uqienchi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>qienchi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 96<br> <font color=#333333>(1/25/02 2:34:33 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A bit off Topic</span><hr size=1> I went to BDL msg board, and apparently you removed all Dethen's post to member's area =( ... any particular reason for that?
