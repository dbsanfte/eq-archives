Good people that happen to by morally and ethically upstanding people should be allowed to choose to abort regardless of any other factors in the pregnancy.  <br>
<br>
They should have the right to determine what is done with their bodies, provided that they have shown that they are worthy of those rights.<br>
<br>
It's not too extreme a leap from your logic of forcing a woman to have a baby, to say determining that the government requires your body for any other purpose.<br>
<br>
Let's see.  Maybe if we impregnate a woman and bring her to term, we can study her medically, and discover ways to save other babies.  You've been determined to be pregnant, so for the greater good of ALL fetuses (sp?) we're going to run a swack of tests on you every week.  You have no choice in the matter.  After all according to Spock, the good of the many outweighs the good of the few.<br>
<br>
Your isolating your logic and arguments down to the greater good of that one pre-born baby.  ( i say it that way because I personally feel a babies rights start with it's breathing of air ).  Why not expand your logic to include the good of a people weighed down by taxes used to pay for child-support of unwanted babies, medical care for crack-babies, welfare for parents who can't take time away from unwanted babies to work.  Every unwanted child born into this word generates monetary costs that are payed for by the whole.  Even those children adopted by loving parents such as yourselves come with a price tag to the taxpayer.<br>
<br>
Don't get me for a heartless bastard.  I'm canadian where taxation and public healthcare are a way of life.  I just hate to see people forced to do things against there will for a small visible benefit, when nobody see's the big picture. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bbloodtide14744.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=cullyn>Cullyn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/14/01 3:39:57 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://media.ign.com/boards/images/icons/eeexcellent.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abortion 2 Foetus 2 Person</span><hr size=1> I reject your argument utterly. . .<br>
<br>
I see it as a tremendous leap from disallowing abortion as a legal option to pregnant women, to the government forcing someone to be subject to medical research.  <br>
<br>
You seem to be perceiving the fetus as simply an extension of the mother, whereas I percieve it as a seperate entity which should be accorded some legal protections (not equal protection as a living, breathing, child that exists seperate from the mother, but legal protection of  the right of the fetus to have the chance to develop).<br>
<br>
You also seem to wish to seperate society into groups where only the &quot;haves&quot; have certain rights.  I reject this as well.  The lowest, filthiest, most pathetic homeless man, who does nothing but drink, smoke, and panhandle, has the exact same rights as the richest, most famous, high-profile citizens.  It may be (unfortunately) true that some weathly individuals are able to afford better lawyers, and thus bend the rules to their own benifit, but the very foundation of the US legal system can be very easily summed up in the words of Thomas Jefferson:<br>
<br>
&quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   all</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> men are created equal, that they are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   endowed by their Creator</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If, as you say, the rights of a child begin once it breathes air, then let me pose a situation to you.<br>
<br>
In my home state, it is illegal to cause the death of an unborn child beyond 3 months development (the caveat is that the death has to occur as the result of an illegal act, thus staving off the pro-choice crowd for now, since abortions are currently legal in the US).  If you beat a pregnant woman, and she miscarries as a direct result of that beating, then you can be charged with first degree murder for the death of the fetus.  This is fairly new, but it has survived one court challenge (state courts) already.  There was a high-profile case where several men were convicted of murder (and assault) for beating a woman with the express intent of causing a miscarrage so the child's father would not have to pay child support.<br>
<br>
By your argument, there would be no crime commited against the fetus (or pre-born baby as you put it), and the only charges against the perpetrators would be assualt against the mother.  <br>

<br>
Reject me all you like. I'm used to it, I'm married.<br>
<br>
When the fetus becomes a unity of it's own and ceases to be just another cell in the mother body is the heart of all abortion arguments in my mind.  I picked air as an arbitrary point when the rights of one shift in part to another.  You have evidently picked conception as that time.  That's your call.<br>
<br>
Should the woman's ovum have rights as well?  Should my sperm?  Have I assaulted every possible child I have spurted out over the years?  They are all potential children.  A fetus is merely a potential child until it is actually born into this world successfully.  Should the fetus die in delivery, then it has not reached <br>
<br>
As for the have and have not's.<br>
<br>
Well there's a problem you see.  I've seen the whole US version of bill of rights.  It has made you what you are today.  Given the time in which it was spawned, when most had no rights and royalty walked all over the peasants, I can full see where it came from.  I'm not talking about the past, I'm talking about the future.  I am talking about evolving as a species.<br>
<br>
I did not specify how the have's and have-nots would be judged.  I made reference to them contributing to society.  This is not monetary, this is not financial, it is social.  Even the lowliest filthiest bum on a street corner can help society.  He can help be picking up trash, cleaning a park, painting the bench he sits on.  If the person is making a genuine effort to get by, the attain the general rights for which you stand.  Some homeless and poor are not poor because of lack of effort, it just happens.  These people pick themselves up and try to help themselves.  They deserve the freedom your forefathers fought and died to win.  The boozing drunkards that live off public assistance and donations do nothing for society as a whole and are making no effort to do so.  They deserve nothing.<br>
<br>
As for your example.<br>
<br>
In my home province it's illegal to beat a woman for ANY reason.  She doesn't even HAVE to be pregnant.  Our penalties for assaulting a woman are already strict, and if you cause the death of a fetus in the process, well that's big trouble.  The fetus doesn't need it's own rights for this.<br>
<br>
If I walked over to your house and beat the crap out of your dog (presuming you have one), is that wrong?  Is it illegal?  Will I be punished?  Yes, yes and yes.  Is it because I have violated the dogs rights or yours?  Should the dog have rights?<br>
<br>
Where's the difference? Dog or fetus, it's a subset of your own personal rights and should be treated as such.  If I kill your fetus, I've killed a part of you and it should be punished as such. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/urexraider.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rex Raider</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/15/01 10:33:24 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abortion 2 Foetus 2 Person</span><hr size=1> Hi everyone.  I am Rex Raider.  I am also sometimes known as Tin|CW|<br>
<br>
Although the following words were not written originally by me, I read this recently (written by George Carlin), and agree with them.  I thought this would be an interesting forum to post them.<br>
<br>
I do of course apologize to those that may be insulted by the following text.<br>
<br>
Do you ever notice that most people who are against abortion are people you wouldn't want to fuck in the first place? Conservatives are physically unattractive and morally inconsistent. They're obsessed with fetuses from conception to nine months, but after that they have no interest in you. None, no day care, no head start, no school lunch, no food stamps, no welfare, no nothing. If you're preborn, you're fine; if you're preschool your fucked.<br>
Once you leave the womb, conservatives don't care about you until you reach military age. Then you're just what they're looking for. Conservatives want live babies so they can raise them to be dead soldiers. <br>
Pro-Life, how can they be pro-life when they're killing doctors? What sort of moral philosophy is that? &quot;We'll do anything to save a fetus, but we might have to kill it later on if it grows up to be a doctor?&quot; They're not pro-life/ they're anti-woman. Simple, they are afraid of women, and they don't like them. They believe a woman's place is to function as a brood mare for the state. if they think a fetus is more important than a woman, they should try getting a fetus to wash the shit stains out of their underwear with no pay. <br>
Pro-life, you don't see many white, antiabortion women volunteering to have black fetuses transplanted into their uteruses do you? No, you don't see them adopting any crack babies, do you? No, that's something Jesus would do.<br>
You won't see many pro-lifers dousing themselves with kerosene and lighting themselves on fire. Remember the Buddhist monks in Vietnam? Morally committed religious people in Southeast Asia knew how to stage a protest: light yourself on fire! C'mon you Christian crusaders, let's see a little smoke. Let's see if you can match that fire in your bellies.<br>
Separate thought: Why is it when it's a human being it's called an abortion, and when it's a chicken it's called an omelet. Are we so much better then chickens? When did that happen? Name six ways we're better then chickens. See? No one can do it. You know why? Because chickens are decent people. You don't see chickens hanging around in drug gangs do you? No. You don't see chickens strappin' someone to a chair and hookin' up their nuts to a car battery. And when's the last time you heard about a chicken who came home from work and beat the shit out of his hen? Huh? It doesn't happen that's why cuz chickens are decent people. <br>
Back to abortion: The central question seems to be &quot;are fetuses human beings?&quot; Well if fetuses are human beings, why aren't they counted by the census? If fetuses are human beings why is it there's no funeral following a miscarriage? If fetuses are human beings, why do people say, &quot;we have two children and one on the way,&quot; instead of saying,&quot; we have three children?&quot;<br>
Some people say life begins at conception; I say life began a billion years ago, and it's a continuous process. And actually it goes back farther than that. What about the carbon atoms? Human life could not exist without carbon. So is it possible that maybe we shouldn't be burning all this coal? I don't mean to be picky, I'm just lookin' for a little consistency. <br>
The hard-core pro-lifers tell us that life begins at fertilization, when the sperm fertilizes the egg. Which usually occurs a few minutes after the man says, &quot;sorry, honey, I was gonna pull out, but the phone startled me.&quot; But even after fertilization it's still six or seven days before the egg reaches the uterus and pregnancy begins. And not every egg makes it. Eighty percent of a woman's fertilized eggs are rinsed out of her body once a month during those delightful few days she has. They end up on sanitary napkins, and yet they are fertilized eggs. So what these antiabortion people are actually telling us is that any women who's had more than one period is a serial killer. I don't mean to be picky I'm just looking for a little consistency. <br>
And speaking of consistency, Catholics and other Christians are against abortions, and they're against homosexuals. Well who has less abortions than homosexuals? Here's an entire class of citizens guaranteed never to have an abortion and the Catholics and Christians are just tossin' them aside. You'd think they'd be natural allies.<br>
And regarding the Catholics when I hear that the Pope and some of his &quot;holy&quot; friends have experienced their first pregnancies and labor pains, and raised a couple of children on minimum wage, I'll be glad to hear what they have to say about abortion. In the meantime what they ought to do is tell these priests who took a vow of chastity to keep their hands off the altar boys. When Jesus said, &quot;suffer the little children come unto me,&quot; pedophilia is not what he was talking about. He had something else on his mind.<br>

<br>
I did not state that I rejected you, merely your argument.  I know nothing of you personally.<br>
<br>
You and I obviously disagree funamentally on the nature of rights.  I feel they are inherent with the human condition, you seem to feel they must be earned.  I disagree.<br>
<br>
You also completely dodged the question I posed about the hypothetical instance of a beaten woman losing her fetus.  Yes, it is illegal to beat a woman.  In my area of residence it is a seperate crime <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> against the fetus</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to cause its death during the comission of a criminal act.  None of your response addressed the question I posed.  Do you feel that such a law is right/fair/proper, whatever word you choose to use?  Obviously, the majority of the people of my state feel that the fetus is entitled to some legal protections, seperate from those already afforded to its mother.  A position I wholeheartedly agree with.  <br>
<br>
You seem to be completely misinterpreting the general gist of some of my statements as well, which I suppose may simply be a result of your being canadian, and my being from the southern US.  <br>
<br>
<br>
As for the George Carlin quote, I would like to point out that I personally support most of the so-called &quot;liberal&quot; social programs.  Care should not end at birth, WIC is great, school lunch programs, medicare, etc.  I support all of these.  On most individual issues I side with the liberal position far more often than the conservative one, abortion being the most notable exception.  If you had to pidgeonhole me into some sort of political stereotype, I'd probably fit in best as a pro-life democrat.  I hold no party affilation, and doubt I ever will, and I vote republican, green, and libertarian on occasion, but in the context of the two major US parties, I fall in with the Democratic view far more often than the republican one.  <br>
<br>
I see the reverse of the Carlin position as being true.  Democrats wax eloquent about caring for the child in umpteen ways after it is born, yet they extend no protection to the unborn fetus.  This to me is the truely puzzling position.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uuraniumcw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>UraniumCW</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/15/01 12:35:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abortion 2 Foetus 2 Person</span><hr size=1> I didn't dodge the question at all.  You didn't read the answer.  :^)<br>
<br>
It's right here:<br>
<br>
***<br>
If I walked over to your house and beat the crap out of your dog (presuming you have one), is that wrong? Is it illegal? Will I be punished? Yes, yes and yes. Is it because I have violated the dogs rights or yours? Should the dog have rights?<br>
<br>
Where's the difference? Dog or fetus, it's a subset of your own personal rights and should be treated as such. If I kill your fetus, I've killed a part of you and it should be punished as such. <br>
***<br>
<br>
You could easily have fetus murder/damage/injury laws and have them be punishable without granting the fetus &quot;rights&quot;.  I agree it would be a heinous crime and should be punished.  I question whether the fetus needs rights assigned or granted to it.<br>
<br>
I contend that until successfully born, the fetus is an object and property of the person carrying it, possibly with some rights of property to the other person involved in the conception.  <br>
<br>
I realize this is arbitrary, harsh and somewhat extreme.  I know there are parents out there that have heard their fetus's heartbeat at 13 weeks, and seen ultrasounds and will be horrified by the term &quot;property&quot;.  Too bad, it's an opinion.  <br>
<br>
The whole abortion issue tends to revolve around when to declare the fetus a human being, not whether or not the fetus deserves protection.  If it's just another cell in your body, it gets nothing.  When it's human it's get what everyone else gets.  When does the change over take place?  At the first sign fertilization?  At the first sign of cell mitosis? At the first independant movement of the baby?  When the cortex forms? Upon birth?  There's a logical reason for all of them, and we won't all agree on one, there's no &quot;average&quot; answer.<br>
<br>
Pick an arbitrary time and run with it.  I don't think it's a black and white issue.  It's grey from 3 weeks to 7 months or so.  Before 3 weeks, it's pretty much a cell, after 7 months or so it's pretty obviously a baby.  In between, what is it?  When does it change?  Err on the side of the fetus's rights and say it's always a baby or err on the side of the mothers rights and give her control over her own body?<br>
<br>
My main problem with abortion laws in the fact that they restrict what you can do with your own body.  It's legal to smoke, do hard drugs and drink while pregnant, that's your right (killing it slowly in the long run).  But you can't terminate a pregnancy (killing it quickly).  <br>
<br>
I think it's despicable to do something like that to a fetus (drink, smoke).  I think abortions should only be allowed up until a certain term of the pregnancy (once again - arbitrary).  I think people that abort at 8 months should be shot.  I think people that intentionally harm fetuses are underdeveloped in some way.<br>
<br>
In your state, killing a fetus is murder.  I applaud that.  At what age do they consider it a &quot;fetus&quot;?  I am curious.  Is it at 1 second, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month?  What's the arbitrary definition adopted by your state lawyers?<br>
<br>
Admittedly percentages would be hard to apply to something like this.  But the general idea is there.  The fetus imediately gets protection against aggresive acts (as in assault and murder) but it's right to be born only comes the longer in develops.  Just a thought.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry this was a mess of thoughts all slapped together.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
George Carlin was funny and extreme of course but it does point out a lack of consistency.  I always balk at any categorizing or pigeon-holing.  I'm not conservative, I'm not liberal, I'm me.  I have some views that go one way, some another all based on my own personal ethics.  As a result, the Carlin bit is merely humor and not actually representative of anything other than Rex's bad taste in comics.  Weird Al Yankovic sucks too.<br>

I see where you are going, you consider the crime comitted in the beating of the dog as being a crime against the owner rather than the dog itself, I can follow that logic.  Don't think I agree with it, but I see the point you are/were trying to make now.<br>
<br>
I'm about 99% sure that the particular state law I was using as an example extends the rights to the fetus at 3 months.  <br>
<br>
To me, once everything has come to place (sperm, egg, sexy music, etc.) to create that 1 cell zygote that contains everything necessary to create a human, that is the point at which a separate life forms within the mother.  This life, imo, has a right to be allowed the chance to be born into the world.  I personally would not accord full &quot;human&quot; rights to a developing fetus, but I feel that some rights should be accorded to it.  Mainly, the right for a chance to make it.  <br>
<br>
Many people try to paint the abortion issue as a matter of whether the fetus is &quot;human&quot; or &quot;alive&quot; (thats silly, of course its alive, thats simply a fact).  I don't see the need to recognize it as &quot;human&quot; and give it the same rights as a week old infant, merely the fact that it should have a chance to make it to that stage, and that unnaturally taking that right from the fetus/unborn child should be a crime.  <br>

The main problem I see is that you have to subvert the mothers rights to grant the fetus rights.<br>
<br>
The baby has a right to live and the mother has a right not to carry it.<br>

<br>
Today, a single sperm or a single oocyte is ALONE sufficient to create life.  With today's medical advances, it no longer requires the combination of both to obtain a fertilized egg and thus the cell division that leads to life.<br>
<br>
Again, this goes to the heart of the argument--when does life begin.  Since conception no longer <u> has </u> to take place inside the human body through the natural act of sexual intercourse, such a defintion of life is or would be outdated.  That is why we need to be very careful when we try to pinpoint the exact moment life starts, as technology will continue to adjust that time frame.  As an example, within our lifetime, an artificial womb will likely be created allowing men to carry a child.  Needless to say human cloning has arrived as well.  All these issues require that we take a step back and carefully look at these issues and not establish arbitrary dates or definitions <p><center><A href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=17657"><IMG src=http://www.donorlaw.com/Spio.bmp></center></a>

I contend that that is an entirely different can of worms, and is seperate from the abortion argument.  <br>
<br>
I was arguing with the underlying assumption that we are talking about the conventional methods of human reproduction.  Namely a man, a woman, and some swapping of body fluids.  At least the swapping of fluids part, I suppose it would also apply to someone who was artificially insemenated, or implanted with a &quot;test tube&quot; fertilized egg.  <br>
<br>
I also believe that you are incorrect, a sperm or egg alone does not contain all of the information necessary to eventually produce a human life (they only have half of the necessary chromosomes).  Science can take the genetic material in most any mature cell and (theoretically) create a clone, but I do not believe there yet exists any method of generating a new, unique human life other than the joining of a sperm and an egg.     <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bbloodtide14744.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=cullyn>Cullyn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/15/01 2:54:31 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://media.ign.com/boards/images/icons/eeexcellent.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abortion 2 Foetus 2 Person</span><hr size=1> Response to Uraniums OES:<br>

Again, if you would read my posts, I am not attempting to define the zygote as fully human, merely a cell with everything necessary to become fully human provided nature is allowed to take its course.  Once that zygote is present in the womb, if you leave it alone for 9 months, then a kid is most likely (assuming no complications) gonna pop out.  I contend that once you have taken the fist step down that path, the point at which pregnancy/fetal development/child birth becomes inevitable, then nature should be allowed to take its course.  <br>
<br>
<br>
I would apply the same argument to pretty much all other genetic research.  Everything in our world has had a few billion/trillion what have you years to evolve into our current ecosystem, and we sure as hell do not know enough (or have the right imo) to be fucking with it.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Thinking about your beaten dog argument, I realized that, at least in the US, the dog itself does have rights.  If someone beats a dog that has no owner, they are charged with the exact same crime as someone who beats my dog.  Im my locality it is a misdemeanor count of animal cruelty.  I remember a case a couple of years ago where some local teens were convicted of taking kittens they found abandoned near a dumpster and tossing the kittens one at a time high into the air out the window of their moving car.  They commited no crime against anyone's property, they comitted a crime against the kittens.  It made the news because PETA and the ASPCA raised a big stink about it.  I would argue that a fertilized zygote with the potential to develop into a human being, is far more deserving of legal protections than a stray dog.  (I feel the dog deserves protection as well, Im not an opponent of reasonable animal rights laws). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uuraniumcw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>UraniumCW</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/15/01 3:00:23 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abortion 2 Foetus 2 Person</span><hr size=1> The dog is protected by law, the kittens are protected by law.<br>

I do not consider this to mean the animal has &quot;rights&quot; in the same way that you and I do.  Do you honestly feel that your dog (provided you have one) has the same level of rights that you do?<br>

The fetus can be protected by law to some degree (ie assault by an unwilling father or some other similar event).  But I balk at comparing that to the rights of the mother.<br>

I am not claiming the dog has rights equal to a human, nor am I claiming a fetus has rights equal to a human.  I contend that they do, however have rights, in the same manner as you or I do.<br>
<br>
Any there is a conflict between two entities &quot;rights&quot;, then the lesser of the two evils is generally chosen.  This is the basic principle I used in my initial argument.  I contend that the fetus's right to be allowed to develop outwieghs the right of the mother to remove it from her body.  <br>
<br>
Perhaps someday we will have the ability to remove a fetus from the womb and allow it to develop in an artificial environment, and we can have a comprimise solution.   <br>
<br>
Somewhat on a tangent here, it has always been interesting to me that, in general, supporters of animal rights tend to be pro-choice, and pro-lifers tend to view animals as merely property.  <br>

So we agree the baby has some right to safety, but a lesser amount of rights than the mother.<br>
<br>
You feel that in a conflict of rights the lesser evil is to be chosen.<br>
<br>
Let's compare.<br>
<br>
Terminate a fetus that is arguably not self-aware, but may well have religious significance in the form of a soul or potential life.  Free a woman from the responsability of unwanted pregnancy and motherhood.<br>
<br>
Or force the woman to go to term, enduring sickness, weakness, vomiting, possibly life threatening issues, medication, possibly extreme pain and surgery, in the hope that the baby being born survives, becomes a productive member of society, does not become a drain on taxpayers for the next 15-20 years etc...<br>
<br>
I dunno, I still think it's a tough call.  It's a tough call because I am unsure as to what values my morality assigns to the possible life of the baby.  Maybe I'll see it differently in 6 months when my child is born.<br>
<br>
I hate the idea of abortion, but I hate the idea of forcing a woman to do it as well.<br>

Technology is such that it no longer requires both a sperm and oocyte.  Scientists today no longer need both sets of chromsonal halves.  Rather, one alone is sufficient to create life, WITHOUT the other.  Cloning is nothing more than that--taking the genetic material from one and duplicating it.  I won't bore you with the details, but all it requires is either a single sperm or a single egg.  Cell division take place through the use of an electrical impulse which causes the cell to split.  In fact, it is expected that even cells found in a strand of hair will one day be sufficient to reproduce a person.<br>
<br>
As for technology allowing life to be created outside the womb, that has been taken place for more than a decade--In Vitro Fertilization.  The first 3-6 days of "life" takes place in the lab.  As I posted above, scientists also expect to be able to reproduce a human womb artificially.  We already have seen births of 1 specie of animal, carried in the womb of another-without the sharing of genetics.  I am more than happy to provide you with additional info if you are interested. <p><center><A href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=17657"><IMG src=http://www.donorlaw.com/Spio.bmp></center></a>

  Heh no, right now they could clone you based on your hair sample (although given that hair is dead (the part sticking out of the body is anyway)) if they could obtaina viable genetic sample,the problem with sperm and ova is that they are missing information, if you were to guess at this missing data you would get a genticlly approximated human, not a clone.<br>
<br>
 Dolly was not cloned from the originals egg, but other cells genetic information was extracted and intserted into a viable egg in which the original host genes had been removed.  after that it is a relatively simple embryo transplant situation.<br>
 here is a cut and paste from encarta on the web ont he subject:<br>
&quot;However, in July 1996, a team of Scottish scientists produced the first live birth of a healthy sheep cloned from an adult mammal. The team scraped skin cells from the udder of a donor sheep (sheep A) and these cells were temporarily starved of nutrients to halt cell development. An unfertilized egg was removed from a second sheep (sheep B) and its nuclear material was removed to eliminate genetic characteristics of the donor egg. A skin cell from sheep A (containing a nucleus with genetic material) was fused with the unfertilized egg from sheep B. The egg, now with a full complement of genes, began dividing and was placed into the uterus of a surrogate mother (sheep C). The embryo developed normally and was delivered safely. Named Dolly, this healthy sheep was introduced to the world with much fanfare in February 1997.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
 It is clearly stated that the donor cell was not a ova cell, but rather a skin sample.  there is still some debate as to whether the new sheep will live an average lifespan for a sheep or if the fact that the host had lived a number of years will be deducted fromt he life span of the cloned sheep.  Basically most cells can only divide a finite number of tiems before they give up trying and just plain die. (also an area of stuidy int he hopes that this can be manipulated to make humans live potentially until they decide it is timie for them to give up the ghost, as it were.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uspioctor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Spioctor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 693<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/16/01 3:18:58 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.donorlaw.com/spio4.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abortion 2 Foetus 2 Person</span><hr size=1> Phebos, read your post again: "An unfertilized egg was removed from a second sheep (sheep B) and its nuclear material was removed to eliminate genetic characteristics of the donor egg. A skin cell from sheep A (containing a nucleus with genetic material) as fused with the unfertilized egg from sheep B.<br>
<br>
The enucleated transfer removes the genetic material from the egg.  In its place, was the genetic material from Sheep A.  An electrical impulse then causes the first cell division or the genetic material from Sheep A, alone.   We work with both enucleated eggs and cytoplasmic transfers as well in which either the nucleus (genetic material of the egg) is removed and replaced or the cytoplasm (the fluid surrounding the egg) is withdrawn and injected into another egg.<br>
<br>
Remember, to clone is to reproduce the subject.  To do that <i>requires</i> that you not reproduce with a sperm an egg--but rather a single cell.  My point is that we no longer need both a sperm and an egg.  Rather, any single cell is sufficient now to create life if it contains the necessary DNA and can be coaxed back into its embryonic state.  I also might have confused the issue as there are different types of cloning and I have been simply speaking generically.<br>
<br>
So, whether its sperm, eggs, blood, or a skin cell, each alone is capable of producing life.  So where do we draw the line? <p><center><A href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=17657"><IMG src=http://www.donorlaw.com/Spio.bmp></center></a>
