<br>
There, some drinking, some just standing, watching the others, stood a herd of the most magnificent horses she had ever laid eyes on.<br>
<br>
The unicorns, more than two dozen, dotted the area around the falls, taking in their drink.<br>
<br>
Every horse was pure white...no discoloration, no mix of dappled brown or black, no stain on their perfectly white hides. The only color breaking up the white was gold...hooves like solid metal, mane and tail that brilliant dark yellow, and the horn, twisting like a golden spike, wicked sharp, two feet of colorful bone extending from the forehead of the beasts. Camille felt her lungs constrict as she looked upon the beasts of Tunare's stables.<br>
<br>
Now, she thought. Which one?<br>
<br>
One thing she noticed, as far as she could tell, they were almost primarily male. The stallions were everywhere, but of the mares, only two, one, young, small...no more than a colt. The other, adult. You could sense an air of a matron about her, the way she lowered her mouth to the water and drank, without glancing about, as if she knew, if anything startled the herd, she would be protected by the males. The stallions danced in the grass before her, locking horns in a play for attention, but she ignored them all, and lowered her head again to drink.<br>
<br>
Now or never.<br>
<br>
Camille stepped from the brush.<br>
<br>
Instantly the unicorns reacted, half of the herd circling the young female and standing very still, heads lowered to leave Camille facing a sharp row of golden spikes. The other half formed a line with almost military precision in front of the older mare, scuffing their front hooves in the soil and snorting in warning. A sea of golden lances moved to and fro and the stallions made a protective fence around the two females. Tension filled the air.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will not hurt you.&quot; Camille said, feeling like a fool speaking to the animals, but hoping her steady, even voice would calm the growing agitation of the herd. &quot;I just need to ride one of you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her eyes inspected the herd. The matron snorted once, and they parted, leaving a clear path between herself and Camille.<br>
With a deep breath, Camille began walking forward.<br>
<br>
Closer and closer she grew, the males growing more restless. Still the matron just watched her quietly, the only unicorn in the herd that did not have its weapon trained on her.<br>
<br>
When they were less than six feet apart, Camille stopped, noticing with unease that the unicorns that had been protecting the younger female had broken off, one by one and now were behind her, effectively sealing off any thought of retreat. All around her, golden horns lowered, fencing her in.<br>
<br>
&quot;I need your help.&quot; Camille addressed the matron.<br>
<br>
The matron regarded her quietly, and then neighed once. One of the males next to her pushed ahead, and touched its horn to the ground. Camille realized he wanted her to ride.<br>
<br>
Camille sighed in relief. That was easier than she had imagined. Although she would have never chosen a stallion if she had the choice; her experiences with Brimstone had left her scarred.<br>
<br>
No sooner had she thought that, than she realized she could never ride the unicorn who offered himself to her. &quot;Choose&quot; Duir had said, and this would not have been the beast Camille would choose.<br>
<br>
&quot;I choose you.&quot; Camille said, raising her finger to the matron, hand shaking.<br>
<br>
The matron snorted once. The males backed up, horns still lowered.<br>
<br>
Slowly the matron took a step forward. Her head lowered, levelling her horn at Camille. Camille held her breath.<br>
<br>
With a quick movement, lightly, the matron tapped her horn on the hilt of Reaver, poking out from its scabbard on Camille's back. The movement nearly threw her off balance. The matron whinnied, and danced back. Camille glanced over her shoulder at the handle of the sword. What did this horse want? The sword?<br>
<br>
Camille drew the weapon out, and extended it, hilt first, toward the matron. The unicorn tossed her head and snorted again, pawing the ground. Camille stood there, weapon reversed, confused.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you want?&quot; Camille asked again, offering the sword.<br>
<br>
The matron lowered her horn again, neighing. The horn weaved back and forth. Comprehension dawned uneasily on the knight.<br>
<br>
&quot;What, is it a spar you wan...?&quot; Camille began, and then the matron lunged at her, horn aimed at her throat.<br>
<br>
Instinctively, Camille flipped the weapon around and parried weakly, barely deflecting the horn to her left, passing it over her shoulder as the horse's head came in close. She could smell the warm exhale from the matron as their faces grew close enough for a kiss. And then the matron danced back.<br>
<br>
The males began to make a high pitched sound. Camille's ears rang as she stood facing the matron, as the noise rose in pitch. It almost sounded like human cries. Her eyes darted from the males to the matron in a panic.<br>
<br>
The unicorns were screaming.<br>
<br>
And then the matron charged.<br>
<br>
Camille dove to the side as the matron's bulk bore down upon her. Tucking and rolling as she did, sword out to the side as to not tangle itself up as she curled into a ball. She came out of the dive rolling over once, safely out of way of the thundering hooves. Had she not moved, she would have been trampled under the horse's rush. She unclasped her shield, and brought it up protectively in front of her, watching the matron as she cantered around. All around her the unicorns screamed.<br>
<br>
Another charge.<br>
<br>
Camille brought up the shield, knocking the matron's horn up high. Then the matron's chest hit her full across her body, and she was tossed to the side like a rag doll.<br>
<br>
Camille leapt to her feet as the unicorn trotted over to her. The head whipped, and the horn swung at her like a sword. Camille brought Reaver up and parried.<br>
<br>
Again and again the horse swung her head, blindingly. Camille found herself locked into a deadly battle with the horse. She refused to use her blade offensively, but the matron was giving her no room to even think about attacking. It was all defense, sheild up, blade parrying blow after blow, feinting right, riposting left, a dodge, block, as the unicorn stabbed at her relentlessly. Another block, parry, and the horse whinnied and reared back, for a moment exposing her underbelly to Camille as her hooves raised high to dash out her brains. Camille's first instinct was to thrust forward deep with Reaver, disembowling the horse. With every bit of control she could muster, instead she brought her sheild up in front of her face.<br>
<br>
With a jarring crash the horse bore down upon her, hooves hitting the sheild and knocking her flat to the ground. She was prone on her back, sheild still over her, covering her face protectively, as the matron's hooves landed to either side of her head, fancing her in. The breath knocked out of her, Camille lay immobilize under her shield, unable to see anything except the dull steel of her safeguard, inches from her eyes.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the horn drove itself through the sheild an inch away from her ear on her left, rending through the steel like a knife through paper. It plunged into the dirt next to her. Had the matron not miscalculated, Camille would have been pinned through the eyes like a butterfly to a board. <br>
<br>
The matron whinnied angrily and tossed up her head. Camille felt her grip on the sheild go, as the horse's strength ripped it from her grasp. The minute the horse's hooves lifted, she rolled to the side and came up, Reaver ready.<br>
<br>
The horse was shaking her head wildly, the shield still on her horn, stuck, as she tried frantically to shake off the sheet of metal that now blocked her vision. Camille watched, unsure of how to proceed, as the matron joined in with the warscream of the other unicorns, whipping her head from side to side, trying to free herself of the shield.<br>
<br>
<br>
The other unicorns were circling them, stomping their feet angrily. Camille turned warily watching them. They kept their circle going, growing tighter and tighter. Then, almost as one, they rushed her.<br>
<br>
Camille found herself screaming with them as they charged her. With a feral cry, she leaped for the back of the matron, grabbing the horn under the shiled, and swinging heavily onto the unicorn's back.<br>
<br>
The matron went wild, bucking madly. Camille held on like a vice, body aching as the unicorn tried to buck her off.<br>
<br>
And then the matron bolted.<br>
<br>
Wind rushed in Camille's face as the unicorn flew off up a path leading up the waterfall. The sheild still blinded her unwilling mount, and Camille had to bite back a cry as the unicorn almost ran them into one of the maple trees that dotted the path up the mountain side that the waterfall cascaded down. The other unicorns were flanking her, and started to crowd in around the matron, partially to guide her from running into obsticles in her blindness, and partly to attempt to gore Camille from her back. Holding onto the horn with one hand, Camille was forced to draw Reaver once more, swinging left and right, turning horns away from her as they attempted to skewer her sides. Now she was as blind as the horse, eyes left and right only, as she deflected blow after blow, arms tiring, but adrenaline pumping hot and fast through her veins, pushing her on.<br>
<br>
Upward they ascended, the unicorns keeping their queen's path straight, attempting to skewer the parasite from her back. Camille fighting them off like a rat backed into a corner, holding on for her life. The roar of water grew loud in her ears, but she hardly heard it above her own pants of air as she defended her sides. And suddenly the horses flanking her stopped, screaming louder, paniced.<br>
<br>
Camille's eyes forcused forward for a moment, just in time to see her blinded mount leap out into midair. The matron had just unknowingly reached the end of the path, and plunged with Camille over the edge of the waterfall.<br>
<br>
Camille bunched her leg muscles and pushed off from the back of the plummeting unicorn, as they both tumbled head over foot to the water below.<br>
<br>
ICE.<br>
<br>
Camille's body went through a violent reaction to the freezing water, as she hit the pool miraculaously feet first. Her leap had brought her ahead of the horse, and she plunged 10 feet straight down, into a deep part of the waterfall's basin. Reaver was almost ripped from her grasp, as training behind her, as she entered the water, it hit the edge of a shallow spot just a foot behind her. Had she not leapt, she would have been dashed on that rocky shelf, which was only 2 feet of water over hard shale, until it dropped deeper in the area where she had landed. She held her breath and fought exhaling as her body reacted to the cold, and kicked off the bottom towards the bright light that glittered on the surface above her. Her head broke the water and she gulped air in noisily.<br>
<br>
On the shallow shelf of rock lay the matron, on her side, chest heaving. From the unnatural cant of her legs, she had shattered nearly every bone in the fall when she hit the rocky shelf. Her eyes were wide and wild, blood mixed with the heavy foam surrounding her mouth and nostrils, as she lay on her side. The shield that had blinded her lay on the rock to the side, the fall having dislodged it on impact. High above them, the unicorns screamed, looking down at Camille as she pulled herself up, exhausted, onto the shelf. Then their heads disappeared, as they began charging down the mountain side.<br>
<br>
Camille crawled to the horse. The matron could do nothing except look at her with one eye rolled back. More blood and foam. The horse was dying.<br>
<br>
Camille drew herself up to her knees, hands trembling, looking at the horse that had come so close to killing her. The blood on that perfect white hide was a desecration.<br>
<br>
&quot;Live.&quot; Camille said softly, hands lighting with blue light.<br>
<br>
The mare screamed as Camille brought those two burning hands flat onto her shattered chest.<br>
<br>
--PULSE--<br>
<br>
Camille lit white like a star, as magic poured from her soul into her hands, pushing out in palpable waves into the dying unicorn. Bones healed, bleeding stopped, as Camille laid hands on the matron and gave her the touch of life that was the gift of the paladin. The matron drew herself hasily to all fours as Camille stumbled to her feet, drained to the point of near collapse. She stumbled against the horse's side, but the mare did not recoil, just let Camille hang on weakly, attempting to stand.<br>
<br>
The other unicorns had reached the edge of the pool, screaming intense and deafening. The mare swung her head aound and whinnied loudly. And as if a switch was thrown, the screaming...stopped.<br>
<br>
As one, the unicorns pointed their horns at the woman who hung on limply to the side of their queen. And slowly, lowered their heads, touching their horns to the floor.<br>
<br>
Camille watched numbly. Then the matron began to move away from her, and she fought to stand. Sloshing through the water to her sheild, she recovered it and strapped it to her side, watching the mare as she trotted a bit, and lowered her muzzle to wash the blood from her face in the cool waters. She drew up her head, snorting, as the water washed away the scarlet foam from her lips. Then she trotted slowly towards Camille, horn levelled at her heart.<br>
<br>
Camille watched her, panting.<br>
<br>
The mare stopped. A movement of her head, fast, catching Camille unaware. She would not have been able to anticipate it had she even had the strength to react.<br>
<br>
The mare whipped her head around and placed her head low, horn touching the ground at Camille's feet.<br>
<br>
Camille reached out and lifted the horse's head from the ground. With a weak hug, she put her arms around the mare's neck and buried her face into the horse's massive shoulder.<br>
<br>
&quot;I choose you.&quot; she whispered.<br>
<br>
And then, achingly, she climbed onto the mare's back, and cantered back the way she had come.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle.com Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27>Artistic Endeavors</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.vazaelle.com">Vazaelle.com</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246j<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
