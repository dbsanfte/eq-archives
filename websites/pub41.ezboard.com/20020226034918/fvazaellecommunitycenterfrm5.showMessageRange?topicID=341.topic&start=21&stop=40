<br>
- (Sotae) Had a friend in high school, used to throw the bitchinest parties. His parents would party with us. Hell, his dad supplied all the classic rock we listened to. His dad also had garbage bags filled with weed, and beer cases filled with bricks of hash in the furnace room that we would look at.. drool dribbling down are chins. Total joke.<br>
<br>
- Had this one Amiga copy party (if ya know what that means) when I was like 14 or something. One of the parents dropping off his kid happened to strike up a conversation with my dad and was like &quot;Yeah, I am so happy my son plays with his computer, rather than going out and getting laid by some slut who'd just give him some disease!&quot; WTF? You don't want your son gettin' laid? Can you say.. homo?<br>
<br>
- My mom has this thing people refer to as a &quot;Green Thumb&quot; so like, from the second you step into the backyard, it's like you walked into an amazon rain forest or something. Plants, trees, flowers.. everywhere. Then when you get to the ass end of the back yard, it's a garden. You name the vegetable.. it's there. And seeing as how I'm not an avid fan of eating my greens, I have no clue where it all goes. Definately maxed foraging.<br>
<br>
- Oh yeah, mom is also like a sweets-aholic or something. So she's constantly baking. Come x-mas.. there's gotta be atleast 20 different types of baked goods gtg at any time of day. Did I fail to mention there's also some form of cookie, loaf, muffin, bread on stand-by 24/7? Yeah, pretty much daily she turns something out of that oven of hers. And it's all damn good too. Definately maxed Baking.<br>
<br>
- Old style cooking. If there's fat in it.. I'm eating it. I'm pretty happy I haven't had a heart attack yet. No point in taking a cholesterol test, cuz it can't possibly measure the level I'm at. Good morning son (it's noon) want some breakfast? Pancakes, Eggs, Bacon, Sausages. Ahh.. that was filling. Have a smoke, and a cup of coffee. Fire up EQ, get to raid location, finish doing Aego's &quot;Hey son, are you ready for lunch?&quot; WTF? I just ate!! it's not even 1:30pm!! Then I deal with being asked if I'm hungry every 30 minutes til she closes down the kitchen at like 8pm. It's the one true complete disaster I have to deal with on a day to day basis.<br>
<br>
- How about being the older sibling? &quot;but you HAVE to help your brother with his homework&quot; Yeah.. cuz he helped me with mine while he was still in the womb. WTF? Hmm.. how about I just read for him, speak for him, sign his name for him, tie his shoes for him. Great thanks. Have a brother that can't turn the TV on, or switch the TV to watch DVD's without me getting up and doing it for him. I love it. I'm my brother's personal bitch, servant, secretary.<br>
<br>
- Worked with my dad. I'd get these crazy jobs where i'd stay up for like 3 days straight running this machine. So like.. mon, tues, wed.. til he finally said.. k, go home and get some rest. So I show up Thursday morning at like 7:15am, jesus, never heard the end of it. You see.. I was LATE. by 15 minutes. The fact that I stayed up busting my ass for 3 days has little relevance. Go figure.<br>
<br>
- Had this left-over sod from doing the front lawn sitting and rotting on the driveway. My dad decides it's time to go on a mission to dump this DIRT in the creek up the road. He thinks it's all like illegal.. like.. dumping dirt.. onto.. more dirt.. could possibly end the world or something. So we drive to the creek and pitch it out the back of the truck. Drive back home.. and I'm like &quot;Yo dad, uhm.. we're like in the wrong fucking driveway!&quot; My dad was so hammered, he pulled into my neighbors driveway thinking we were home!! Man.. /sigh<br>
<br>
But all in all, you take the good with the bad.. and give some years to pass.. and you know what.. you just can't hate them. You get a little older.. a little wiser.. and you get a better feeling for what they went through before you were born, when you were born, and while you were growing up. They've had hi's and low's the same way we do. Just remember usually they only want what's best for their children (although.. sotae.. uhm.. i don't know what to say.. heh.. you should turn that experience into a TV show or something.)<br>
<br>
Only thing I wanna recommend is getting in touch with your parents as soon as you can. Don't throw away any time you can spend with them (and I know it's tough having EQ.) You never know when one of them can just leave unexpectedly. I lost one of my parents in the last few years, and even though the bad probably outweighed the good (by a long shot,) it really leaves a huge hole. Not one that can be easily filled.<br>
<br>
No matter how much ya hate 'em, you just gotta love 'em.<br>

Cantonese(1 of 100 Chinese languages) always adds la after the sentence. It's how they speak. Like British say &quot;how are you&quot;, American say &quot;how are you doing&quot;. Whats wrong with that?<br>
Fish &gt; all to some Chinese especially Cantonese like your parents. If my sister in law orders fish, she means the FISH HEAD! <br>
Be proud of your parents if they came here with $100 spoke no English. What could you do if you were them?<br>
<br>
Americans have weird stuff too. So you hate them too?<br>

<br>
I'm a French Canadian now trapped in Baptist Kentucky of the USA.<br>
<br>
Mother is Austrian, and Step Father is from Newfoundland in Canada.<br>
<br>
Background on Mom:  Strong willed, organized to the point of OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder), and one smart lady.  Sharp as a knife as they say<br>
<br>
Father: Social Alchoholic (weekend binges), Newfoundland is sort of the West Virginia of Canada, every jokes about them and their niavete/gullibility/family tree.  Spends money at the racetrack constantly (Good thing mom hid the grocery money), smokes the heavy stuff (Belvedere when I was a kid, that denim colored pack, Export A before that).  Had a habit of placing his false teeth on the table when he ate (with everyone else around), cause he preferred to gum the fried and boiled remains.<br>
<br>
Grew up chewing fish.  Lots of Fish.  Fish fish fish.  Dad loved fish, as Newfoundland is fishing territory and everyone does it.  Lets not forget the random influx of Seal, Terr (A greasy sea bird like a gull), Puffin (think penguin), Moose, Bear, Whale and whatever else someone has shot recently.  Or whatever we have trapped and/or shot on one of the innumerable wilderness adventures in the woods of Canada.  One of the trips my brother wiped his ass with poison Ivy.  We cut short the trip.<br>
<br>
Mom had this clean freakyness going on.  5am in the morning up every single day cleaning.  Going to work, coming home and cleaning.  5am up on sunday baking breads for the 7 kids (the horde), for the week.  Dinners were everything and then some shoved into the same pot and BOILED.  Potatoes, Cabbage, Salt Beef, Fish, Parsnips, Carrots.  Same pot and pulled out separately.  Like if you put 8 things all together aand cook them in the same pot, putting them separately in the table will make them still taste different right?<br>
<br>
If it wasn't boiled..it was fried.  Eggs, bacon, Bologna, Fish Cakes, etc. Better yet..take the boiled leftovers form last night and FRY them today!  mmm...Hash they called it.<br>
<br>
Tea thing to.  I swear my dad pisses tea.  <br>
<br>
One thing about having a 'backwoods' Father.  education was NOT a priority.  I shoulda worked with my hands instead of my head dontcha know.  Shoulda stayed playing Hockey too.  Nothing like having a little NHL player in the family.  Uh huh not with those genes pop.  <br>
<br>
Somehow I truly believe that if I slept with multiple women regularly (and at the same time), drank hard liquour to excess, could install a toilet, knew all the teams in teh NHL and their stats for each player, smoked and drove a pick-up, that my dad would be alot more proud of me....<br>
<br>
Instead I became the six-digit Gay engineer living in the US...<br>

anywaz, my parents, basically the same as ur chinese ones (cept for the food bits, tho we do get packets of food for university...real food tho, like kraft dinner =P )<br>
<br>
I guess I was the naturally bright one in my family with math and science, I just owned those classes so my parents somehow got the belief that I worked hard. I hit HS and my grades dropped like 3% and all of a sudden I'm slacking and being lazy...uh mom? I haven't done hw since grade 4 thx...<br>
<br>
Oh and the EQ thing...oh god...I'm a loser, I have no friends, I play EQ to get away from social interaction...uh yeah, sure mom...thats why I am missing my PoF raid to go out with friends...uh huh...and thats why I get phonecalls...cause I'm a loser...right...and no EQ in university..ok mom...(on my credit card now)...no EQ...thats why I bought a AMD 1.4 with 256 MB RAM and thinking about getting 256 MB more...yeah, word needs it...<br>

It's not a solely Cantonese thing, it's an actual written character and therefore used throughout all the dialects. It's not even the most commonly-used of all the similar types of sounds in Chinese, at least for widely-spoken Mandarin -- I'd think that &quot;mah&quot; gets that title, which makes it more curious why foreigners take such an immediate response to &quot;lah.&quot;<br>
<br>
These words -- yah, mah, bah, lah, ah, yoh, loh, yeh, ah, -- are all used at the end of a phrase or sentence to emphasize something. Lah usually signals a feeling of ... being resigned, mild displeasure, taking on a tone of negotiation.  Few of these words are used in formal written Chinese, (one form of mah goes at the end of a question, and ah can mean surprise just like &quot;ah!&quot; in English, so they are excepted) they are mostly used by young people in everyday colloquial speech and ... nagging grandmas. ^.^<br>
<br>
Anyway lah, it is late loh, I go eat bah, and waste more bytes later yah, OK mah?<br>

Sotae I couldn't decide whether or not to laugh or cry for you.<br>
  Look at it this way, &quot;What doesn't kill us, makes us stronger&quot;<br>
My Dad was my biggest pain in the butt when I was growing up.  Or so I thought.<br>
 Now I look back on it and realize that every good thing I am, comes from him.<br>
  I'm in my 30's now and they still treat me like I'm 17 and live at home.<br>
  My parents are strict, devout catholics.  It wasn't bad enough that I don't practice anymore (I believe, I just don't go to church) but NOW I'm going to marry an athiest.<br>
  My parents were like are you SURE you don't want to get married in a church? &quot; You know you won't really be married unless you do it in the eyes of God?&quot; or &quot;How about we just have a priest there to bless you?&quot;<br>
  Funny part is I drive them nuts too.  They love my Fiance almost as much as me, actually they talk to and email him more then me too /cry.  So now they are all torn apart because they love him and he's an athiest.  How can this be?  lmao!<br>
  My Parents are Dutch turned American.  I grew up with Wooden shoes in my house.  Try explaining that to your friends.<br>
  I now appreciate my different upbringing and the cultures I've been exposed to, but I sure understand your pain.  Being a kid sucks when your parents are weird. lol <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukaminya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaminya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 109<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/23/01 8:21:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=341.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: LALALALALALALALA</span><hr size=1> Haha!

I think all fruits can be juiced. A tomato is a fruit. V8, anyone?<br>
<br>
Anyways, I'm chinese, born and raised in the USA. Hawaii to be exact. My parents both came from China. And yeah, they do those things too. No fish drying tho, it's pretty smelly so I think they just go to the store for that. What gets me is the constant pickling/preserving. Some of the nastiest crap, I swear, is sitting on my deck, atm. Jars of some fruit in some kind of salt/vinegar/whatever solution. I have no idea what happens to it when it's done fermenting or whatever. I don't think I can remember them imbibing any of that stuff, ever. Somehow, it seems to disappear. /shrug<br>
<br>
The only thing that I can remember them drying was what I think were duck livers. I ate some and they weren't bad. But most of what they prepare/eat as comfort food is nasty. I can't go into detail, but I guess it reminds them of where they grew up. Heh, it's probably healthier than the crap I eat at McDonalds, Jack in the Box, KFC, etc.<br>
<br>
And we have something of a garden in my backyard. My old house was worse, seeing as it had a bigger backyard. Melons and squashes all the time. And my brother had to plant an avacado seed there too (for kicks I guess). We had a mango tree that I miss dearly. I don't eat mangoes now, probably because I had enough of them growing up, heh. Banana plants too, I think we got them initially from our neighbors next door. Ironically, the one tree we tried to grow over and over again, a lychee tree, never happened. They always died, or got accidentally killed. At our new house, the yard is smaller so squashes are all that I see growing now.<br>
<br>
As for dating, my parents are pretty cool. My sister got married recently to a japanese guy from the Big Island in Hawaii. The only problem to that was I'm the oldest child so I should have been the first one to get married. I got some mild hints from them and my relatives. I guess that whole &quot;carry on the family name&quot; thing. Anyone of you girls willing to help me out? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Evie my grandpa has gone through over 10 Juiceman juicers, can you believe that? He was told that carrot juice would help him stay healthy, he ended up drinking so much that his hands turned orange. I don't think I could keep cucumber juice down, thinking about it makes me want to barf. I saw on Food Network that in South America the latest food fad is to eat marigold and other flower petals in their salads. YECH!!<br>

<br>
My best friend growing p was 1/2 black and 1/2 Korean (his mother).  His mom was the sweetest lady in the world but oh, my... the stuff she used to do...<br>
<br>
I remember a time right after I met him that I went to his house and as I had my hand raised to knock on the door this smell hit me.  Not a pleasant smell, mind you - something I had never smelled before and not missed.  I'm no wimp though, so I knocked on the door.<br>
<br>
When the door opened the odor hit me full in the face, driven by the pressure in their house.  My eyes began to water.  I couldn't breathe.  I croaked something and his mom figured I was looking for him.  She told me he wasn't home yet but that I was welcome to come in and wait.  I croaked my thanks and denial and tried not to run as I moved away from their house.<br>
<br>
That was my first exposure to Kimchi. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The fishes:  Ah, yes - I know the fishes!  A big 10 gallon tub of them sitting on the floor of the kitchen, soaking in brine juice.  When I asked what they were for my bud told me it was for a &quot;special Kimchi&quot; that his mother and grandmother were making.  /shudder<br>
<br>
Later that week I was at his house again and I saw his poor mom and his oh-so-ancient grandmother out in their back yard furiously digging a hole.  I told my friend that I was going to go help them and that he should come, too.  Who were we to let two nice ladies go digging holes unaided?  That's unamerican!  I had my hand on the knob of the back door and my bud SPAZZED.  I had never seen him like that.  He told me they were digging that hole to bury the &quot;special Kimchi&quot; in and that big unidentifiable bundle next to them was the said &quot;special Kimchi&quot;.  Needless to say we let them finish digging their own hole. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Or the time his mom called me - that's right, not him but her!  She asked me to come over.  I knew that my bud was gone with his dad for a few days so I had no clue what she wanted.  All I knew was that I wasn't going to dig any doggone Kimchi holes!  When I got there she sat me down in the &quot;formal&quot; parlor (somewhere my bud and I were never allowed to loiter, breathe or otherwise be seen in).  She brought me a Pepsi with ice and this was a surprise in itself as she never kept sodas in the house... juices, always juices in all the colors of the rainbow (and some not in any rainbow).<br>
<br>
She started the conversation in her broken english and at first I had a hard time figuring out exactly what we were talking about.  After a while it became clear.  My bud had gotten 4 A's and 3 B's on our last report card.  I had gotten 6 A's and 1 B.  She figured that this qualified me as some kind of academic tutor for my friend, her son. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  How was I to explain to her that she and her husband were pushing him too hard and putting him in classes that were almost too much for him, and compounding that with a forced extracurricular schedule that was turning him into a teenaged madman that was hanging on by his fingernails?  That was the first time in my life I wanted out of a situation so badly that didn't involve my own immediate family.<br>
<br>
Ahh, my family.  The sleeping father, the religiously zealous mother, the can-do-no-wrong little sister and the family on my mom's side...<br>
<br>
Rather than go into specifics of everyday interaction let me just give you a rundown of a holiday get-together.  Say, Thanksgiving...<br>
<br>
Wake up that day god-awful early, somewherea round o-dark'30.  Eat some healthy junk for breakfast that makes you unable to crap for 3 days.  Put on your church clothes even though everyone else there will be dressed in jeans and the best stuff from K-Mart.  Pile into the car and hope to the gods that the starter catches so I don't have to get out in my church clothes and help push-start it. Get on the road to Uncle Larry's &quot;ranch&quot; because we can't go to Brian and Sherry's anymore.  See, they had another kid and it's just too crowded there (what's that make, 6 kids now?).  Besides, Larry doesn't want to go to Brian's house because Brian still owes him money for the pair of rusted out 65 Mustangs that reside next to ther house (nevermind that they've been there for 30 years).  Besides, Larry's wife isn't feeling well (she hasn't felt well in 8 years and it's probably because she has no reason to be happy and healthy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  Can't come to our house as my mom won't allow drinking and smoking inside.<br>
<br>
After a 2-hour drive in silence (to not speak was good as anything you say can and will be construed by my mom as an insult to her religion, her person or otherwise degratory to her in some indirect manner) we arrive at Larry's house out in the boonies.  The 20 dogs his wife has bred but hasn't sold announce our arrival from their makeshift kennel.  Larry comes out to greet us and you can tell by the way he's walking that  he's already drunk (the Bud Light in his hand is a dead ringer, too) and it's only 9am. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The rest of the fam damily pours in over the next 3 hours but Grandma always manages to show up pretty much about when we do.  This isn't for puncuality, mind you.  It's so she and my mom can gripe about how everyone else is late.  In the meantime my dad has snuck off with Larry to have a beer (if my mom caught them she'd be mad at my dad for about a year) so I blackmail them into giving me a beer too, or I'll rat on them with lightning speed. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The women go into the kitchen to start the cooking and you can hear them arguing from miles away.  Not one of them can cook to save their life but they are determined to put on a show - the problem is they all have their own idea of &quot;the show&quot;.  All directors and no actors in the kitchen.<br>
<br>
The men put on the football game and I watch my dad try to melt in with them although he hasn't watched a ball game since last Thanksgiving.<br>
<br>
By now every male person above the age of 10 is drunk or buzzed.  This can only mean one thing.  Yup - violence.<br>
<br>
Larry says something about my mom that hits my dad the wrong way so my dad gets a big mouth.  He and Larry step outside to try to hurt eachother (kind of like two sloths wrestling) and Brian gets mad that Larry is fighting my dad who is so much smaller than he is.  So Brian jumps in, tosses my dad off of Larry and commences the real ass-whoopin.  By now my little sister or one of the other young women have run inside to rat to the big women and out they come, pouring from the door near the kitchen like a wave of estrogen.<br>
<br>
Grandma is crying.  My mom is flabbergasted and smells beer on my dad.  Sherry is mad that everyone is not proud of Brian for beating Larry's ass as she thinks he's deserved it all his life.  Larry is on the ground too drunk to realize he hasn't gotten up yet and his wife hasn't even come out of the house (see, she knows better <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )  The kids are crying because Grandma is sad.  The dogs are howling.  The cows all want to know what is going on and the horse wants to know what the cows are doing.<br>
<br>
The wives seperate and drag their husbands off for wound-attention and lecturing.  The kids all flock to grandma for lord-knows-what.  The single men and single women go back to the ball game.  I sneak off to snatch another beer while no one is paying attention.<br>
<br>
Thanksgiving dinner will now be 3 hours late even though the event only lasted 4 minutes.  /ponder  At least I'm trashed now and the Broncos are getting their asses whooped.  Life is good.<br>
<br>
Dad sneaks more beer as he's already in trouble and it can't get any worse.  Something about seeing a grown man hiding a beer in between the couch cushions and taking stealth-sips every now and then always struck me as funny...<br>
<br>
Finally dinner is ready and the women are still arguing about it.  Grandma wants to know why I have more meat than vegetables on my plate and if I like Cranberries any more this year than I have for the last 10 as she keeps making the dish with it &quot;just for me&quot;.  The turkey is dry, the gravy is horrid and the Cranberry thing goes untouched as usual.  Larry keeps drinking as does Brian and my dad eyes them enviously.<br>
<br>
Finally dinner is over but we can't leave yet.  Oh, no.  It's time for a &quot;get the whole family into the living room for a free-for-all that has not once gone good&quot; thing.<br>
<br>
Sherry wants to take pictures but grandma fusses about her appearance and it doesnt matter anyway as Sherry's 6 kids are clambering over everyone and everything without her or her husband showing the slightest bit if concern or control.  No one could hold still long enough to get a decent picture with all that going on.  My dad is back to stealth-sipping beer on the opposite side of the room from my mom so I meander over to him real nonchalantly and blackmail him into sharing it with me again.  Larry is cross-eyed. Brian's working on getting that way, too.  My dad begins to stealth-sip more urgently and sends me on a covert op to get him a beer out of the cooler out on the front porch.<br>
<br>
The women begin to argue about who knows what and Sherry is flapping her arms like a peacock in heat and this sets my mom off.  No matter how their argument starts these women - all of them - have been using the same insults on eachother all their lives.  Grandma starts crying again.  The dogs are howling and the cattle are running for some reason.  The men go outside because 30-degree darkness is more welcome than the cat-fight erupting inside.  The beer's out there anyway.<br>
<br>
Larry says something to Brian about the money he still owes him and another ass-whooping commences, this time without female involvement.  The kids are running back and forth between the two fights looking for an uninvolved adult to reestablish sanity.  They can't find one so they all come to me.  I can't do anything so I give them beer and go back to watching the fight.<br>
<br>
10 minutes later Larry is once again being nursed but is still too drunk to feel the pain.  His wife has gone off to a back room somewhere, probably under a bed.  My mom is berating my dad for not helping Larry (nevermind that Brian could beat both their asses at one time).  The women are still fuming at eachother and you can feel it in the air - it makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up.  Brian grabs another beer and glares at Larry.  My dad sends me on another covert op for more beer.  My mom spots me and she pulls me aside and tells me that she doesn't care at the moment if my dad drinks beer, and for me to just get him and the other menfolk out of the house again.<br>
<br>
Out we go into the frozen night and the women pick right back up where they left off.  I'm too drunk to care about the cold or them and so are the men.  The kids have full tummys, they're emotionally drained after seeing grandma cry twice in a day, they have some beer in them and they are falling asleep wherever they are, such as the kitchen floor.  The men are all getting along now and I don't know how, other than that 6 cases of beer are gone.  The beer keeps flowing and before long they are hugging eachother in the &quot;I love you man&quot; fashion. <br>
<br>
The women begin taking breaks from their battle to step outside in to the night's chill and they see this behavior from the  men.  This causes them to suddenly grab beer, too, and before long theyre hugging and remembering good times. <br>
<br>
Wthin the hour everyone is buzzed or drunk (except my mom who refuses to drink alcohol) and getting tired. They round the lump-o-kids up and pack into their Grenadas, Grand Torinos, Vegas and Gremlins.  Before they go they all talk about how they can't wait for Chrismas next month to do it all again.<br>
<br>
WTF?!?!?!?!<br>

ROFLMAO!!<br>
<br>
<br>
My Thanksgivings are always somewhere different but always consist of my family always making fun of how much I eat, and I have found through the years I can torture them by eating less and less because god forbid they out eat me, so I will usually have a small plate consisting of 1-2 slices of Turkey some mash potatoes and some corn or brocili (sp) and so EVERYONE has to eat less then me so basically everyone leaves with left overs because they are starving to death and I am just fine eating just enough to be satisfied!!<br>
<br>
Other get togethers with my mom &amp; step fathers family's go accordingly....<br>
<br>
We arrive at 5pm I stay involved and interested in the conversation for about 30 minutes and then I leave and all of the sudden its like someone woke a giant cage of birds because there is non stop squaking  and there is no way to hide from it other to do random &quot;errands&quot; for someone and drive far far away!!  :P  Then it comes time to go home....everyone gets up (except for me because I know whats coming!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) and starts heading to the door....then someone asks or brings something else up, then oh, geez, back to squaking for atleast another half hour - hour and a half until I just walk out to the car then my mother will usually follow slowly but surely!!  :P<br>
<br>
Time to talk about the real dad family!!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
So It's 1994ish and I'm 14 years old and have yet to meet my real dad....I get curious and ask my mother to arrange a meeting with my dad.  Well....we meet and what not and he seems alright....I start to stay a couple nights at his house over the next year, find out that he's a complete alcoholic and gets home from work and drinks himself to sleep every night!!  (and also carries on VERY boring conversations that just repeat himself constantly!!)  Well, I also have met my little half brother that has adapted to the drinking by basically staying in his room for hours studying or playing basketball elsewhere.....well, I start to pick up on this.  And a Barbeque comes up and the rest of my dad's side of the family comes over and I meet them and my dad is also teaching me how to BBQ (yeah its a black family!!  :P ) all this while I am trying to escape to chill with my little bro in his room but is difficult because I'm sorta the guest of honor...well, the evening comes around, the crowd is begining to dwindle because my uncle and father have drank all the alcohol in the house and all the ribs and chicken and greens are gone so basically the only people left is my step mother (very sweet lady!) my little bro my father's good friend from back in the day and my uncle and father....well the 3 old guys are bullshitting while I'm helping Jean (stepmom) and Jeremy (little bro) clean up.  All of the sudden there a bunch of loud thumps and some shouting and my father has my skinny ass uncle pinned to the ground and my father's friend is prying them apart.....well all this shouting is going on and before I know it my dad is in his bed passed out, the friend took my uncle home etc....well about an hour later my uncle comes back over banging on the front door yelling and screaming and blah blah so we call the police and Portland PD comes and puts him in detox etc....well from that day on whenever I was at my fathers all I heard was how my uncle shouldn't have disrespected him in his house and what not (I myself not knowing exactly what started everything) so I escaped to my bros room everytime he grabbed a drink and then I just stopped going over to his house and stopped calling him because calling would just be the same exact stuff but with a long distance bill from hell!!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
That's about as screwed up as my family gets....I could disect my wife's family, but I have typed enough atm!!  :P<br>

The worst part of Thanksgivings for me is that they're all at my snotty aunty's house. We all sit down at the table and before we eat she calls up her oldest daughter who moved away to California and has everyone pass around the phone to talk to her. When she comes home all she does is show me her 1000000 photos and talk about how drunk she got this one night or something. zzzzZZzZz<br>
