It's an asbolutely terrible law.  Though created to deal with some _real_ issues that need to be dealt with, it sure doesn't handle it in the right way.<br>
<br>
With regards to the RIAA this is still a lot like what happened when tapes came out, so go figure.  The thing which I think sometimes gets forgotten in this whole equation is that it is not the government's responsibility to ensure corporations' profitability.  If their business model ceases to be effective they have to change it.  Just because a company was succesful in the past does not grant it some kind of supreme right to be succesful in the future.  There's current legislation (in the House, I think) the CBDTPA/SSSCA which would mandate government (essentially) to create anti-piracy hardware to be put in absolutely every piece of consumer electronics and further set up a government group of &quot;cyber-cops&quot; to monitor this and copyright infringement.  And, of course, it's supported by the RIAA and MPAA.  The first requirement would cripple American electronics companies' competability with foreign corps and the second requirement is just ridiculous.  It is and always has been the responsibility of the copyright holder to defend their copyright.  Functional (if not good) laws exist once a copyright holder gets things to court.  It would be the worst kind of corporate wellfare to have a government copyright infringement detection agency, especially given it would basically give corporations the right to sue the government whenever they found a copyright infringement before said agency did.<br>
<br>
As for boycotting music as Herder suggests, I happen to like music a bit too much to do that.  Sure, I try to buy music at shows, which is cheaper and goes more directly to the band.  I also get a lot of stuff free because I'm sorta in the industry.  But not everyone comes to town or sends me records to review/play/promote.  In the end a record industry boycott would just hurt the artists who are for the most part already getting screwed royally.  Boycotting asshole artists, like, say, Metallica, is a whole different issue.<br>
<br>
What you should really do is keep downloading mp3s.  If you like a band you hear that way, buy their album, if possible from them at a show.  Do that and give money to the EFF <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.eff.org">www.eff.org</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.<br>

<br>
They'll just blame the decrease in profits on pirating and then even more laws will be passed and we'll end up paying taxes on stupid shit.<br>
<br>
I'm going insane if i have to start paying some crazy entertainment tax or something...  bad enough i have to pay into social security which i'll probably never get back.<br>
<br>
I don't even own ANY music cds. Didn't buy any pre-mp3 either.  I'm too lazy to change cds when the 1 song i want from a cd is over.  The only 2 dvds i have were given to me.<br>
<br>
I'm glad Napster went to hell.  I hate those programs. I always liked the more complex ways of getting everything so that not every fool has access to it.  Did anyone even give a damn about mp3s before napster?  I mean all my &quot;computer&quot; friends were downloading them far before then (years) and i'd have some on my computer and people would be like wow you have music on your computer?  But when the general populace (joe blow) got involved with the &quot;easy access&quot; method it all went to hell.<br>
<br>
I don't mind so much the new copy protection schemes and stuff that they make to prevent legitimate users from making copies of their stuff.  I think it's kinda funny really... they totally underestimate those with NBTD (nothing better to do)... there's always gonna be some computer geeks with NBTD who are gonna circumvent any encrypted system they make.... but i guess it's pretty annoying for less technical savvy people. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=1159.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=1159.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1159.topic&index=17><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.threadControl?topicID=1159.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1159.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1159.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm19">VCC Administration<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm18">Title Requests<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm1">General Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm23">SoL Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm4">The Bazaar<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm12">Voting Booth<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm13">Retirement Hall<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm3">Event Announcements<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm8">The Gallery<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm5">Rants and Flames<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm6">Guild Lists and Links<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm16">Guild Discussions<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm17">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm7">Vazaelle Guild Leader Lounge<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm24">VCC Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle.com Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.vazaelle.com">Vazaelle.com</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
