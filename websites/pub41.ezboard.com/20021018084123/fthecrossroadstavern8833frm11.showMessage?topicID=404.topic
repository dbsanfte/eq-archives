Thanks to Gilgurth for being extremely understanding.<br>
Thanks to Brendan for being a neutral evaluator.<br>
To the rest who ragged on me, please read my post in the bard section. It's a technical examination of some of the finer points of bard song twisting during raids.<br>
Raid leaders would benefit also.<br>

<br>
I have been in that situation as well but not on a vox raid. A lot of times you are doing the best job you can but it comes down to these people who are not pulling their own weight and hindering the progress. You know these people... the ones complaining about their pussy hurts and it's just too hard. WTF? Come on, some people have grown up in these nice and easy Kunark zones... and have no clue about how to function on a raid... not even that sometimes they don't know what the fuck to do because they never had this pressure on them to preform... and for what? To help kill a mob that they will possibly gain no loot from... so why bother to give more then 100%... let the other people there worry about that stuff...<br>
<br>
I realize a lot of what you have posted has come from  people sending to tells on how to do your job. You know a lot of these new bards have no clue of the flexibility and control we can have in a raid situation. They have conformed to a norm of what's to be expected of them and will not think outside the box for a little bit. Realizing that they can catch hell for trying something different or are not willing to do a lot more then what they were told to do. Be an example and let people know why you are doing a different twist... the reasons behind it. If they can't understand oh well... if they blame it on you when they all die because 1 bard tried to do something different... tried to compensate for what your party was lacking... then please tell them to STFU and be part of the solution not the problem.<br>

Any bard that insists on playing resists with a lute instead of drums IS stupid :P  Resists versus vox are paramount, given that 99% of the players there are not in lvl 60 equipment, their resist equipment is usually haphazard at best and they need all the help they can get. (and no, this is not an effort to demean them, it's just a fact of life.)  A bard's job during vox is to try and keep MR and CR as high as possible, screw mana, screw ac songs.. resists.  After being sent a tell about the situation, where both the raid leader and 'lead bard' Accent had refused to even consider such a thing, I sent a tell to Accent that admittedly wasn't very kind (something along the lines of 'you think playing niv's is vital during vox? hahaha :P ) and upon being told 'don't be ignorant' I promptly replied with nope.. i'm not ignorant but yer being quite stupid if you are so certain as to go against the known tactics versus Vox.   It went downhill from there and honestly, I am developing quite a negative attitude towards any twink bards excepting a certain few who I know CARE about their class instead of just wanting the equipment and glory :P <br>

It's only eleven less vs. cold<br>
2. Niv's adds 15-25 dmg rune against magic damage (more than makes up for eleven vs. cold- even better than sung SoS)<br>
3. My tanks were lvl 51-52 and out of the 4 of them, one got feared once in spite of the lack of elemental rhythms. And the cleric shouldn't be close enough to the dragon to be getting my songs.<br>
4. The fights lasted four minutes. Cleric died after 45 seconds and over the next three minutes I gave my my tanks an extra 900 hp.<br>
5. I switched to drums on next attempt when the raid leader asked me to. If any of you lead a raid that I'm allowed to come on, and ask me to use drums, I will.  If my tanks are going to have a problem with fears that outweighs the need for hp regeneration, I'll use drums.<br>
6. My comment about being ignorant.  Trilca: you actually think Niv's will do anything on a Vox raid? hahahaha   <br>
Accent: I'll explain it to you after the raid (this was in the middle of the rush to the dragon btw)<br>
Trilca: after you get your whole group wiped out you mean?<br>
Accent: don't be ignorant<br>
7. Yes I admit I am a heavy twink.  Bard was not my first class, though I wish now it had been.  I eat sleep and drink bards.  Ask my wife.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  For me, bards are the best class.  If my analysis of the songs in the bard section doesn't convince you I care about the class, nothing I say will.<br>
8.  I want to fit in with the bard community of Zebuxoruk. It is obviously an integrated and involved peer group.  That's the biggest reason the flames pained me.  If we can agree to disagree on this twisting choice, we can move on, work together and maybe even raid together.  That's my hope.<br>
