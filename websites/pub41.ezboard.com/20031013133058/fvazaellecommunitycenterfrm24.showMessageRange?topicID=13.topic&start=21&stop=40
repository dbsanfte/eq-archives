I guess if you want a giant flame fest keep bringing it up, in fact you might as well since nothing will stop that now anyways.<br>
<br>
As far as the incident, I was there but not really involved, I know that a few people decided to form groups and pull some stuff, and after a while I heard some ooc/says about them and some group.  Ive been to skyshrine 3 times in my life, 2 yelinak kills and getting CS key, so I have no fucking clue what might be a camp or what is required to pull something.  From the desription of the layout/what was killed it would sound to me like soliid would have a choice of either pulling the mobs that were up, or pulling past them and directly over the group that was fighting something?  That doesnt sound like much of a choice to me.  Now it seems like this is analogous to a group in karnors deciding to camp right on the bridge.  At that point you can either train them or kill 5 dogs every 30 min.  The camp site is designed to cut off pulls, de facto ksing, no I wouldnt respect that at all, shrug.  Now since they were there 1st maybe we should have asked them to move, but if they wouldnt I dont see why we should have to not kill anything just bc thier camp spot cuts off the majority of the dungeon, seems to me that is the more inconsiderate thing, shrug.<br>
<br>
In closing, good ways to resolve issues:  tells, politeness, compromise.  Bad ways:  insults over public channels, assumption of righteousness, inflamatory posts on public boards. <p>Procax

If we lost to something I could guarantee that you wouldn't have a problem rushing in after.  In fact I know that when a general was left up in Kithicor, you didn't track down the rogue who spawned the General to give them their loot, you took it down.  I don't have a problem with that.  But appearently you do, which makes it all the more odd that you did that.<br>
<br>
I am 100% positive that the Endless would kill something we lost to.  They will pull VS past a raid.  They will take a 30% Sev from Agony.  They will CoH past a raid that is already clearing down.<br>
<br>
Again, I don't have a problem will you all doing that to the other guilds.  But when it comes around don't bitch.  We got VS pulled over us.  Sure we were pissed, because we let it happen, not that it happened.  You will race, you don't have a problem with winning races.<br>
<br>
You know we do CT, you wanted a shot.  We stayed out of the zone for your shot.  We let you lose.  We zoned in.  We didn't say a word.  We just did our thing.  If you have a ss or a log of someone in IV talking smack in ooc post it.  I would love to see it.<br>

i'm curious, because i have a story i'd like to share with this thread based upon your answer.<br>
It concerns an incident in OS once upon a time, which you and i handled in tells, no /ooc flaming was involved. But if your going to use schoolyard name calling (hopeless order), then i'd like a chance to expose some hypocrisy here.<br>
<br>
As far as the HO err PO's attempt at VS the other night, lemme give you my take on it.<br>
PO entered KC and moved to the staging area before VS room.<br>
as we were buffing etc, Endless had a crew set up shop there aswell. IV apparently has some peeps waiting around too, according to /gu chat.<br>
Well, we decided to speed up our attack prolly due to the mass eyes watching us, and with a slight fear that nothing would stop anyone else from just waltzing into VS room to kill it.<br>
Well, we tried and failed. NP, we were aware that having a second go would be laughable because, heck we all know now that this server has become a &quot;you snooze, you lose&quot; server.<br>
(i have no problem with this). We decided we would send a cleric in rez us all and get the fuck outta there. But Endless was nice enough to rez us<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  So, we get rezzed and bang, inc like 15+ mobs whiping out all the newly rezzed. Big deal, shit like this is expected nowadays. There were words exchanged as to who trained that area, but personally i don't know or care who did. So from my bind spot i find out Endless took out VS, fair game NP. What does Endless do after they kill VS? They offered us some of the loot. WTF is this ? I think they had the best intentions for us attempting VS, we failed, they stepped up took out said mob and shared the loots. They do it outta pity? Perhaps, but i think they did it out of respect for other people on the server. Props to Endless. If they sat around cheering that we got whiped, then they have a fucking weird way of expressing their joy. Whereas other people  would be coming here wishing they were there to laugh at our misfortunes.<br>

Yes, SF and TE lost to CT, but remember it was our first attempt at fighting him.  We will do better next time with the knowledge we gained.<br>

IV always kills mobs on their first attempt?  No.  It is pretty poor of them to ridicule others who are attempting mobs for the first time and lose.<br>

You said you had been there for a while about 3 times in ooc, so why would the 'camped' mobs not be dead? Let me guess, half of the group had just come back from LD. AOK sounds good to me, just kinda pick a big area and flame anyone that comes near it.<br>
<br>
And as for this whole cazic thing, no one even brought it up till you guys started to flame us, none of us were planning on saying a thing. But you guys just figured you'd get some cheap shots in without any of us fighting back?<br>
<br>
Since you asked, Mori, I believe it took us 3 tries as most uber mobs do for us before we finally get it. We even after that time have failed a lot. We had around 45-50 I believe our first kill. Of course a lot has changed since then and tactics have improved, we worked hard for this head start so we wouldn't have any guilds competing with us as we were getting our strats down. But sure, blame us cause us 'breathing down your necks' (eventhough krim was the only IV in the zone while you guys were fighting) caused this.<br>
<br>
I feel bad for anyone on that raid, because I saw a lot of nice ooc msgs between endless and sf talking about how this was a learning experience.  Yet then you come here and try and place some of the blame on us?  As you said about Befb, I hope you don't speak for everyone on that raid. <p><br><font color=orange><font type=bold>Rhyu</></>

Thank you for your courteous reply.  Oh to be the strongest in Vazaelle.  Yes, I can understand the fact that IV has many many full time players who have leveled quickly and do impressive things.  You were fortunate enough to have xxx amount of tries on the big mobs since you were at the forefront.  Yes, I realize you could have come romping on in and KS'd the damn brown blob.  Thank you for &lt;allowing&gt; us our shot.<br>

I suppose that is the price you pay for not being the strongest.  That is, you must wait 1-2 months before you can retry mobs a few times to understand tactics and such.  So yes, Im sure well go for Sev again...well try things differently.  Hopefully well succeed or well have to face IV tromping on in gleefully.  The learning curve is much steeper in every other guild's situation.  <br>
<br>
Im not bitching about the unequal balance of power.  You have earned that through your actions and time invested.  I suppose it is the fact that when we try stuff, some particular members choose to talk shit and laugh and gloat should we fail.  **See Befb and Plumpkin's post here at VCC should you require an example***  You never had that power above you waiting for you to fail.  <br>

Enjoy your game, Ill enjoy mine.  That is, if you allow me to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/utreeslover.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Treeslover</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/25/01 2:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Soliid says:<br>

Apparently Soliid extends his uber mob philosophy to regular camps.  So just remember if you are doing the Crypt in Seb that just because you've engaged the guardians, its ok for Soliid to pull the hierophant past you because hey, you haven't engaged him and he's on their way to camping the blood.<br>

1)  I rarely post in the rants forum.  I jumped in when Befb started his gloating.  Please read my other posts concerning how I feel about this.<br>
<br>
2)  Im not blaming IV for anything.  And even though one IV was in fear (Krimzin), your raid force was at the portal.  Lets not mix words here. <br>
<br>
3)  IV didnt make us lose, however.  I wish we had another shot but we didnt.  Ok. <br>
<br>
3)  The raid was very fun, exciting, and fostered cooperation between two significant guilds.  I had hella fun.<br>

If someone beats you to the mob and engages first, I guess you're SOL. I say this from a personal point of view, and I think I can surmise that my guild takes the same opinion.<br>
<br>
TE tried Sevi twice and failed. We jumped in and tried him. We failed. They got him after we died. Are they pissed about that? it seems so. Are we? Nope. We couldn't kill the mob. Bummer for us. We'll try him again sometime. Are we pissed that TE CoH'd their guild past us to get Trak? No, we're not pissed. It was a nice tactic to get there first. I guess we're seeing the first effects of the transfers. Someone brought their naked 55+ mage over and now he's a trak camp-bish. I just hope TE isn't too upset when we find a way to circumvent their tactic.<br>
<br>
I guess the point of this ramble is: Be bold and try things you're not sure you can handle, but be willing to step aside when someone who *can* handle it shows up.<br>

You just have to pray you break the room before people get there.  If you're fighting those cleric golem things and that ph has spawned, you're claiming too much.<br>
<br>
And I do think that CoHing past a raid going down to Trakanon is reportable, I believe there was a guild on E'ci that was broken up because of this.  They had prior warnings though.  A friend from there told me, so don't come and get all technical if you were there, I wasn't.<br>
<br>
Since that is the case, if a gm isn't on, just send a monk down and train the mage, cheap tactics work both ways. =) <p><br><font color=orange><font type=bold>Rhyu</></>

I think if a guild/group goes through the trouble of clearing a whole plane to get to the boss, they should have as many tries to kill it as they want. <br>
<br>
Yesterday, Sacred Fires had to clear Fear not once, but twice (because the server repop was right after AEing the temple pulls) to get their shot at CT.  Might have been nicer to let them try a couple more times.<br>

<br>
Skyshrine.. is like Karnors there is one way to pull mobs if your pulling past pool room if someone is camping there clear it if someone is going to pull past it they are going to pull stuff in the way. Yelinak CoH takes about 30 min to set up thats about 1 round of spawn time for your &quot;camp&quot; that u were doing ppl wanted faction for killing statue / vind. I have np with them pulling through and over ppl if they are in the way.<br>
<br>
Ganking mobs.. works both ways some ppl award those who were there first with the 1 attempt others like to all out race and leap frog, IV will always give them a shot *IF* someone beats us there.<br>
<br>
Learning Curve Winning all the time yada yada... Do we lose on the shit we try? Yup sure we as im sure everyone knows usualy win the first time we try something new on the 3rd try. Is it fair that not everyone will get this option? nope but life isnt fair. We try to be fair in what we do when it comes to another guild being around I mean heck I even shared CT's loot with Silivir last night. =)<br>
<br>
<br>
p.s. Yes we did kill CT on our first try, im pretty sure that question was asked earlier in the thread. <p><BR>

<br>
And that is great that The Endless shared loot with the PO raid.  Had the loot been 2 cobalt greaves, not 3 staffs of shittiness would the outcome have been the same tho?  Never know.<br>
