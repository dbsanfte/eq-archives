Burning Meadow<br>
<br>
Come lady lie beneath these swaying leaves;<br>
Beckoning golden rye, beside mountain streams;<br>
Just you and I, so won’t you come;<br>
The lovers gentle sigh, arms entwined as one;<br>
Come lady lie, together let us dream;<br>
Dare not to be shy, embrace what love may bring;<br>
Our spirits soar to the sky, through wispy clouds we run;<br>
Over the fields we fly, dreaming of love yet unsung;<br>
Come lady lie, enter romantic scene;<br>
Gently side by side, passion smolders, steams;<br>
Kisses softly lit, fires eternal as the sun;<br>
Dusk enters night, lovers absorbed in fun;<br>
O come lady lie, in these arms of peace;<br>
Dream into my eyes your lips I tenderly kiss;<br>
Lovers lying thigh to thigh, so won’t you come;<br>
Swaying perfect time, rhythm lovers drum;<br>
Come my Queen and lie, make known your need;<br>
These gentle hands mine, desire to set you free;<br>
Fingers trace love lines, slowly softly strum;<br>
So won’t you come, come my Queen and lie;<br>
With me in this burning meadow of love.<br>

I like.  If you don't mind, good sir, with a glass of wine beside, I departed my usual cheery countenance in an effort to write something not as gleeful. 'Twas an interesting effort for someone accused of having permanent rose coloured glasses in front of their eyes.<br>
<br>
Love’s Promise Broken<br>
<br>
In meadows gleaming golden, ‘neath blue sky<br>
Where larks aflutter dance upon the breeze<br>
Did once love also dance ‘twixt you and I<br>
A love we thought enduring as the trees.<br>
<br>
A kiss, a touch, the warmth of soft embrace<br>
And whispered promises of love divine<br>
That time had not the power to displace<br>
Now soured as the most acidic wine.<br>
<br>
The words that sang, now bitter curses hiss<br>
Caressing fingers point accusingly<br>
Lips curl in anger where they once did kiss<br>
And coldness lives where once the heart was free.<br>
<br>
The lovers once in bliss, in anger part<br>
Despair, in victory, claims the broken heart.<br>
<br>

<br>
Naughty Knave<br>
<br>
There once was a charming young knave<br>
Who carried a rather large stave<br>
Until the smith's wife<br>
Wore a belly quite rife<br>
And the knave's stave was made to behave.<br>

<br>
Appearing from the void of nothingness,<br>
I stood upon a ridge watching her…an image of myself<br>
The winds caressed her face, winds of the west, warm and tender<br>
Her emerald eyes gazed across fields of flowers that danced before her.<br>
Her cloak moving slightly against the breeze, as if tugging for her to move on.<br>
She turned her face upward to the sky filled with light of the moon.<br>
The gypsy king she desired and whispered for each morning was nowhere near,<br>
Like a sinking tide, she knelt upon the ground…the sword gleaming in her hands.<br>
“I am a warrior, I live by a code…why must they take from me, when I do not take from them”<br>
Her words were soft yet strong while laced with pain and sorrow.<br>
<br>
A single tear slid silently down her face and fell upon the blade,<br>
It moved along the edge, splitting it apart…blood dripping upon the ground<br>
Traveling to the blade’s end, the sword pointed itself toward the furthest star.<br>
A flash of lightning exploded upon the night, darkness distrubed at midnight.<br>
The globe of mist swirled around the woman, never looking up as she raised her fist<br>
Her hand opened revealing the wound her heart felt as the lightning slammed against it.<br>
As quickly as it started, it ended and darkness prevailed again…<br>
The warrior who knew only death and suffering rose slowly as if defying good and evil<br>
“My heart just won’t let go and this sleeping tiger must remain asleep.  Do not awaken me.”<br>
She spoke with pride, strength, determination and willfulness just before she turned away<br>
I stood upon the ridge watching her...the ghost of myself<br>

Helplessly observing as the scene unfolded before him.<br>
His piercing blue eyes gazed in wonder as he saw the woman approach the opposite ridge.<br>
Long cold and remote his heart lept, could this be her, the princess he had given his love so long ago.<br>
Breathing deeply his heart burst into flames of a long sleeping desire.<br>
The breeze bore the familiar smell of the woman he loved.<br>
Watching her kneel for what seemed an eternity he saw her rise and draw her glimmering sword.<br>
Plunging recklessly from the ridge upon which he stood he sprinted across the meadow separating them, even as electricity filled the air.<br>
Screaming her name he watched as the fiery bolt slammed into her outstretched hand.<br>
She turned and their eyes locked momentarily.  <br>
In the sea of emerald and pain he saw the soft love she held for him yet.<br>
And she was gone.<br>
<br>
Kneeling in the spot she stood he raised his clichéd fist heavenward.<br>
A long painful roar burst from his cracked lips, echoing across the valley the sound of sorrow mixed with rage.<br>
A tear slid from his cheek and fell as he lowered his head to the ground.<br>
The warm wetness of her blood and his tear mixed together staining his cheek.<br>
Empty and still he notices a scroll in his clenched hand.<br>

<br>
My Dearly Beloved,<br>
<br>
The night is the most scariest for me, once sleep used to be welcomed and now I fear it.  I roam the meadows in the evenings while most nestle happily upon their pillow.  How many years has it been since the cloak of darkness allowed me the glory of a peaceful sleep?  It has been so long that I cannot even remember when that was.  But tonight's deprivation of sleep is the greatest of all, for I have looked inside of myself and these things I know.<br>
<br>
I died within.  I watched myself devoured piece by piece, the life sucked out. To think that you have suffered daily for years kills me worse than the death that myself met.  There is no way that I can look you in the eyes without feeling shame for what you endured.  My enemies have destroyed what I had left in me, any hope that I cherished to seek freedom from them has been removed with the swiftness of a sword.<br>
<br>
I know now, that returning to the life I embraced is out of the question.  To the Gods, I am Lady of Pain and to you, a betrayer.  To myself, I am a failure.  My mind no longer sees the freedom that my heart desires, I am a slave to my sword and until the Gods bestow upon me the release of this clutch, I am just an object.  Forgive me....<br>
 <br>
With deepest affection,<br>
Lady of Pain <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFF0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/btmalliance99801.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jazzerbojangles>JazzerBojangles</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 91<br> <font color=#000000>(6/23/03 8:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftmalliance99801frm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Burning Meadow</span><hr size=1> Pondering the scroll the Gypsy King sat in the evenings growing shadows.  Disbelief was replaced slowly with the dawning of a new resolve.  Standing suddenly he summoned his faithfull steed, mounted and rode briskly to the North.  The ever present laughter just beneath the survace was non existant in the scroll, could it be so grim.<br>
<br>
Entering the Northern realm of the great Wizard, Sative of the Arcdiom, Jesse could feel the magical energy in the air all around.  He would seek this heralded Wizard to request an incantation allowing him to become a Life Sprit.  A Life Spirit was a form of living dead, this allowed people to seek answers in the world of the demons and gods.  Very few ever attempted this and fewer still lived.  To fail would result in becoming a minion to one of the demons of the underwold.<br>
<br>
Knowing the risks involved Jesse knew this was the only way to seek the Gods who held his love in their grip of Pain.  He would seek out these Gods and request the price that must be paid for her release.  Resolute and riding boldly the Gypsy King set forth in the magical land to find the Wizard. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/btmalliance99801.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jazzerbojangles>JazzerBojangles</A> at: 6/23/03 11:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#EBEFF1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/btmalliance99801.showUserPublicProfile?gid=snowfoxainaruin>Snowfox Ainaruin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#000000>(6/24/03 10:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftmalliance99801frm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Burning Meadow</span><hr size=1> The features she knows as reality twist and bend, dissipating into a murky gray mist then as suddenly as the shifting began, it stops.

Standing before her in his true form, black tendrils slithering from his form, grasping at the gray mist and leaving their marks upon it.  He shifts into what could be considered as a crouch if there were a ground, his huge black wings stretched out behind him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I see you received my summons.&quot;  The smile upon his face twisted by the enormous fanged teeth formally hidden beneath his black lips.  The smile disappears, his wings flare up, and a hungry gleam flashes across his features.  &quot;I hunt for you...&quot; <br>
<br>
The stench of the hunt fills the room, blowing in through the hole until the spawn closes it and the fear chokes her awake.<br>
<br>
*********************************************************<br>
<br>
Sitting up quickly eyes wide and filled with alarm as the sweat mats against her hair that clings tightly to her face.  Knuckles white from clutching the sheets as the nightmare swallowed her deep into its core, she moves to leave the vision trap quickly tossing back the covers and running for the fresh cool air just outside the front door.<br>
<br>
Sliding down along the wall, sinking to the ground she tries to remember how she got here when she was from somewhere else.  How does she make the past understand they are not what she wants or needs, how does she make the present understand how much she wants and needs him?  Where is he when she needs him to calm the beast that lurks in the darkness?<br>
<br>
The late night townspeople stare at her oddly as they hurry back to a destination only they know of.  Do they see the beast she carries inside in her or do they know she is really a lie and just a slave who escaped her master?  The weary warrior weakly stands up allowing the wall to aid her like a worn old woman in need of assistance to even move.  Tomorrow she will seek him out....tomorrow she will find the one she loves and he will bring the life back to her.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow she finds Jesse....<br>

A dark smile slowly appears as the slave master relishes at the thought of having his prize possession back.  “Seek her lover and destroy him!”  Each word spoken harshly as he spun around to face his lackeys then softens his voice “Then bring her home to her.”  Ali Mannsan, the feared slave master of the high seas, turned toward the docks where his ship sat anchored that bore the name “Final Destiny”<br>
_______________________________________________________________<br>
<br>
“And so there I was standing on this lizard’s tail practicing my portal gate spell.”  The little halfing was saying while looking up at the wizard, a tall slender elf, who was watching the docks intently.  “When this paladin charged at me, waving her sword and shield around like there was no tomorrow! Hmpf!  Had it been my way that noble no good for nothing dinner plate wearer would not have seen tomorrow!”  Her hands placed firmly on her hips while fire flickered in her eyes telling the story to Rizmorik.<br>
<br>
The wizard calmly looked down at the rambling druid wondering to himself how did he manage to get so drunk from one of his concoctions that he ported himself into Pulbrook and woke up to find her leaning over peering at him oddly.  He swears she was talking the moment his mind cleared of the drunken festivity and hasn’t stopped chatting since.  In time, he found her company to be enjoyable and refreshing from the solitude life that wizards tend to follow. When it came time for him to depart he offered to show her new places if she cared to travel with him, she accepted eagerly and so it began.  His life has not been dull since that day, let alone quiet.  “Pray tell, little one, why would the good knight be coming at you that way?”  He asked while moving his attention back to the man strutting toward a ship, his anger rising to why such scum is allowed to share the ground that he does.<br>
<br>
“First, that scrawny silver piece announced she was Zumie, Noble Knight of Jilanli Temple, like I care!  Then she proceeds to inform me…mind you, her words…”inform me” that tail gating is not allowed.  Can you imagine such nerve!”  Rizmorik raised one hand to his temple and began to rub it slowly, his mind searching for answers to where in the master wizardry training did halfings come into play.  “Pity she just didn’t understand what you were doing.” He replied kindly though thinking next time he should leave her at home with Sative while he traveled doing research work.<br>
<br>
Upon seeing the slave master board his ship, Rizmorik gazed across to the inn where the woman once stood outside, he felt her presence but more so felt her desperation.   Feeling helpless and at a loss against the forces greater than he possessed he could only channel portions of the Lady of Pain through him hoping to ease her suffering.<br>
<br>
It was time to return home, he was drained and needed rest to regain his powers that seemed to be seeping away by an unknown force.  Palming his hand upward to the sun, the tiny crystal sparkled briefly before exploding into colors surrounding the pair, enveloping them then vanishing into thin air.<br>

Ali Mannsan shivered momentarily while standing on the deck of his ship, looking to the horizon wondering if a cold front was headed toward the town, he only saw there was nothing but bright sky and warm sun peering back at him.  What he couldn’t see lying upon the grass, the tiny black gem…a marker belonging to a wizard named Rizmorik. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftmalliance99801frm18.showNextMessage?topicID=9.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftmalliance99801frm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=10><img src=http://www.northwindhighlanders.com/images/ezboard/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftmalliance99801frm18.emailToFriend?topicID=9.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftmalliance99801frm18.threadControl?topicID=9.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/pastel/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftmalliance99801frm18.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=9.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftmalliance99801frm18.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=9.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="tmalliance99801frm5">NWH General<option value="tmalliance99801frm6">NWH Trades <option value="tmalliance99801frm9">NWH Quests<option value="tmalliance99801frm12">NWH Guild Only<option value="tmalliance99801frm17">NWH RvR Tactics<option value="tmalliance99801frm8">NWH Officers<option value="tmalliance99801frm10">Mayhem General<option value="tmalliance99801frm13">Mayhem Trades<option value="tmalliance99801frm14">Mayhem Quests<option value="tmalliance99801frm20">Planetside<option value="tmalliance99801frm16">Next Games<option value="tmalliance99801frm18">Minstrel Musings<option value="tmalliance99801frm15">DAoC Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000000>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/btmalliance99801>Northwind Highlanders</a><font color=#000000> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftmalliance99801frm18>Minstrel Musings</a> <font color=#000000> - </font><a href="www.northwindhighlanders.com">Northwind Highlander Stats</a><font color=#000000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.244<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
