In essence it has made my system extremely unstable and will often on boot up, right after the windows splash screen, give me an error with reards to Configmg.vxd and the system will halt asking to restart.<br>
<br>
I can't say it's all EQu, but my most recent re-installation of my entire system has lead me to believe its playing a major role. Here is what has been happening.<br>
<br>
System specs. AMD 950, windows 98se, soundblaster live, Ailinnator 2 video card with Nvida updated driver files.<br>
<br>
Prior to 3 weeks ago I was running a Voodoo3 3500tv card. At some point before I switched to the Aillinator 2, I was not having the problems I discussed above. But at some point I had updated EQu and after that I noticed some problems that were making the system act rather slow and sometimes after boot up windows would need to reinstall some drivers. What drivers I can't remember. I noticed the sytem was becoming unstable anyway.<br>
<br>
3 weeks ago I installed the new video card. Right after installing this card I started getting the boot up problem as stated. Noticed it had something to do with the VXD files and sometimes it would ask for one of the bios files. So, I decided to start from anew and wipe the drive clean.<br>
<br>
Last night I did a fresh new installation of windows and all programs. It was all going great, the system appeared to be solid and stable on every boot. EQ ran great with the new video card and new drivers. At this point I had not installed EQU or any of the other programs. All I had was Everquest, Norton Antivirus, and some other programs that are not attached to EQ in anyway. Once I decided everthing was working fine and after dozens of shut downs and reboots I decided it was time to install Eqinfo and EQu. Eqinfo went in with out a hitch. During installation of Equ, a message came up stated that it could not continue with the installation due to some outdated sytem files and said that it would need to replace them. At this point I became suspicious and didn't install it right away. Played with the system a bit and about 2 hours later went ahead to install EQu. It came up with the same prompt that it needed to replace some outdated system files. I agreed, it did its thing and the computer rebooted on its own. Then it finished with the installation. Did a reboot and the whole system had to go into safe mode right away. At this point windows was looking for the Bios files and needed to reinstal some driver files and hardware.<br>
<br>
Right after all this the system became very ansy and reboots were not stable, often needed to look for missing driver files. A couple of times it booted up looking for the Configmg.vxd file. At this point it was about 3 in the morning, so I gave it break and went to bed. This morning, I booted the system up and the prompt it was having a problem with the Configmg.vxd file, the system halted.<br>
<br>
I uninstalled EQu and anyother files I could see associated with it. Rebooted, Windows looked for and installed appropriate drivers and hardware that appeared to be missing. Shut down, let it sit for about 2 minutes and rebooted. One again, the Configmg.vxd prompt came up with the system hault.<br>
<br>
I suspect EQu has replaced certain windows virtual driver files that can't removed via it's installation and be replaced by windows with a simple re-install. What I would ask of you is a list of all the files that EQu installs. Before I go and format this drive once again, I'll erase the files and take it from there.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your help.<br>

<br>
When I got home this afternoon I went at it and did a bunch of testing with the files that EQu installs. Of these files there is one OLEAUT32.dll which is used by Windows and Directx all the time. You cannot erase it or replace it unless you boot up to DOS. This file is a newer version than what gets installed by 98se and appears to be the problem. Since I have erased all the files installed by EQu and reinstalled 98se to reinstitute the original windows files, the boot up problem appears to have gone away for now.<br>
<br>
Here is a files listing:<br>
<br>
vb6stkit.dll - no change, same original version<br>
comcat.dll - EQu replaced with newer version and this is used by Directx also<br>
stdole2.tlb - EQu replaced with newer version<br>
asycfilt.dll - EQu replaced with newer version<br>
olepro32.dll - EQu replaced with newer version and this is used by Directx also<br>
oleaut32.dll - EQu replaced with newer version and this is used by Directx also<br>
msvbvm60 - no change, same original version<br>
mscomctl.ocx - EQu replaced with newer version<br>
comdlg32.ocx - EQu replaced with newer version<br>
tabctl32.ocx - EQu replaced with newer version<br>
mswinsck.ocx - Never existed in 98se<br>
<br>
More testing and reboots will tell the story if there is in fact a compatability problem. I really like EQu and how it works. I'm hoping that we can fix this problem, if in fact it is on your end.<br>
<br>
More later,<br>
