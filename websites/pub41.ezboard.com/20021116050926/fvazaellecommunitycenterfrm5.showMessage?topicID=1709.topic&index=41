But then again as I said earlier, I have my own sense of self without a guild, so I can overlook rudeness by being the bigger "Man" if you will and apologizing. <br>

<br>
Fantasy was killing wurms at the ledge in HoT and I used my eye to open the door and check if Doze had spawned yet.  I honestly didn't know at the time that guilds killed things for an extended period of time on the ledge, and since Fantasy had been there for a couple hours, I assumed that they had moved deeper into HoT past the entrance area.  Since then I have encountered numerous occasions where people fight on the ledge so /shrug.<br>
<br>
Anyway, opened the door, realized my mistake as soon as it happened, and it shut without incident, but got quite a few hate tells from various Fantasy people for doing it.  It wouldn't have even made the rant pages except I was mad at being called names over a mistake and wanted a conclusive answer about the HoT door aggro and stupidly told Fantasy my oh-so-knowledgeable insights about where to fight in HoT (oops).<br>
<br>
I think I got negative points from Fubbik, Quarken, and Lushe for being preachy and didactic at Fantasy and not thinking to ask about whether it was safe to open the door to HoT or not in ooc.  Firion weighed in saying something to the effect of that while opening the door had no effect whatsoever on direct los aggro (of course), it may have one on assist/proximity aggro.  Firion's especially was a nice post, I'm sure someone will correct me on it.<br>

About respect, I didn't need to ask where they were because I knew where they were. Asking would've been pointless.<br>

I don't come here and ask if I can solo RoV or Emp because I know the answer, I won't ask a guild where they are when I know the answer because it's a waste of time and in know way whatsoever conveys respect imo.

Guess since it was my raid, I should try to clarify what I feel was going on.<br>
<br>
My problem with this Alyen, is that we WERE fighting mobs directly in front of door all night. <br>
Our monk was otw back with a pull and was just about back when you opened the door. No way you could have known that from looking through the door. He was able to FD and we were able to avoid engaging due to that. <br>
<br>
If you had taken the time to ask, I would certainly have had no problem at all just either asking you to wait 2 mins for us to engage and kill that mob or inform the puller to hold, then have you enter. So yes, no one was actively fighting at the door at that time, however, you were very very close.<br>
<br>
I'm not trashing your ability to go where you want, uber or not, I'm just asking that you and others to respect the procedure of not opening that door without asking the group inside. Besides, we werent ready for Doze, and certainly would have passed the word on to your guild because I know your interested in the ToV quest drops. I have before, and I had told another member of your guild not 15 mins prior that I would.<br>
<br>
So my point is not about &quot;HoT is camped,so you cant come in.&quot; It's about, showing a little concern in others success or failure. Even if you think there is nothing to worry about something may be going on that you cant see from looking thru the door. I sent you a tell. It wasnt hateful, it was just asking you to please ask about the door and to inform you that I had NP passing the message on to PO if Doze popped.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's about it. If you want to say, &quot;hey, nothing happened, stop crying&quot;.... then I'm sorry I wasted my time with this. BUT, hopefully, you'll realize from this post what my concern was when I spoke to you there and perhaps consider it, next time a situation like this develops.<br>
