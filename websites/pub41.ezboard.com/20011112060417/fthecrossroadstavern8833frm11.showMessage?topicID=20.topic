Mind you this is purely my opinion, but i like my opinion so :P<br>
To me, in the age of flattened management and empowerment, it seems like management is the most useless component of all. Noone seems to want to make decisions or enact their own authority. Lately it seems like management personnel are mere baby sitters.<br>
At my office, we lost 20 percent of our staff, due to low useage and loss of accounts to other travel firms. <br>
The majority of the layoffs were low seniority people. Most of those people had excellent customer service skills and a decent knowledge of the industry. <br>
It would make more sense to lay off the senior people who did not contribute, had piss poor attitudes towards the client and are more dead weight on payroll than they are worth. Not only do they make more money, but by getting rid of them you not only lose fatter paychecks, but shitty attitudes that roll down to the junior personnel.<br>
Same went for the management that got layed off. The two who got canned were fantastic leaders, and were inspirational to those on their teams. Yet more senior management in the same position who hold the worst record for team stats, disciplinary actions and attendance remained.<br>
I'm sorry if this makes no sense, but i just got off the midnight shift, im tired and pissed to no end.<br>
<br>
The point is, in this age where many companies are laying off personnel, it seems like those who are enacting this decision have no clue on how to do it.<br>
Noone wants to accept blame for companies profits falling. What should be plain to see, is that companies that are well managed generally don't lose profits. Therefore, if you are cleaning house, sometimes it would be wise to start at the top and work your way down.<br>

Actually part of the reason is that senior management feels it's easier to replace lower level people and the cost of dismissing them is lower.<br>
<br>
Remember that most high level managers have some kind of tenure with the company.  That means you've gotta pay them for their time.  At my company, it's 2 weeks pay for each year of server.  Most of the Senior managers here have 5 or more years.  That adds up.  Also, once the swing changes, and you need to get those managers back, there's a cost to do that (recruiting them, flying them in, relocating them.)<br>
<br>
Not that it's right .. just that it's fiscally sound<br>

Trust me, you'll have a great deal less stress if you stop trying to apply what's morally right and sound against what actually happens. If you feel you cannot do this, perhaps self-employment is the best option for you.<br>
<br>
Only one thing matters in any corporate environment - PROFITS.<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually part of the reason is that senior management feels it's easier to replace lower level people and the cost of dismissing them is lower.&quot; - This is correct.<br>
<br>
Middle management isnt safe either. If your company can't meet their projected numbers, more cutting will come in and those fatties will get chopped also.<br>
<br>
I'm not usually a negative oriented person, but I do not envision our economy rebounding anytime in the near future - this goes double for Tech companies. Until equipment and inventories from fallen tech's are absorbed, new equipment will remain on the shelves and those companies will have trouble meeting their expected numbers. Since salary is the higest expense, it gets cut first.<br>
<br>
Further rate cuts might help, but it's up to joe average consumer to &quot;take the plunge&quot; and borrow that money to start that buisness, buy that equipment, or piece of property.<br>
<br>

Being in the Semiconductor industries, the equipment manufacturing side, I get to feel the downturn first, and the upswing last.  This is the second one in 4 years.  I started here at the middle/end of the last one.<br>
<br>
I've been fortunate enough to work my ass off and not have to be concerned with the cuts.  Actually, this time I am a slight bit concerned, as it's the first time in 25 years my company is perdicting losses.  <br>
<br>
And I could be wrong, as I'm not an economist or in the banking industry (any more), but I believe our economy and fiscal strength was still very strong through Nov 2000.  Matter of fact, I dont believe the Dow or Nasdaq started to decline until Nov 2000.  I will go to some sites to pull the history and chats, but i believe it was up to level through Nov 2000.<br>

Dot.Commers are just as much to blame as any corporate fat cat in that they continually spouted off concepts and ideas that never had a chance of being profitable.  Yet the various media outlets online continually hyped this new breed of business entreprenuers on guess what?  Their own webpages such as MSN.com,  Yahoo,  and countless others.  Even worse was these sites became financial advisors to the mobs of &quot;investors&quot; who wanted to cash in on this craze.   Yet no one did the homework that most serious investors do and daytrading only lent to this laziness.<br>
<br>
Now what?  The only reason it isn't raining Stock brokers, and investors from windows is that most of them live in a split level two garage house and falling from even the second floor would only bruise them.<br>

I work for Hewlett Packard and my original position was axed in early March after six months of sitting on our asses in a holding pattern watching what the market was doing.  I still work there but I know that HP has laid good people off and there is always a possibility to do so again.  Layoffs help companies hit those lowered expectations it seems and I am not afraid to pick up a shovel and go back to manual labor if that is the only work available.  So I guess that some of your anger should not only be directed at the Strategic Management but also the little Dot.Commers  who basically lied out their collective asses and did it in such a masterful way that we all bought it hook, line, and sinker<br>

Oh...and that whole comment about the Unions being a catch net for the lazy may be true to some extent but I spent three years working in Factories in New England.  I have a friend who lost his left arm in the plastics factory I worked at when he was twenty-one. Mostly because his boss was pushing him to work in unsafe conditions.  While it cost my friend his arm, it cost that company a fortune to even attempt to make up for the obvious mistreatment of their workers.  although it couldn't buy his arm back.  Those Unions have kept workers from performing tasks that would get them killed, injured, or disabled permanently in the quest for the better ROI.  Not to mention the nightstick off their backs.  <br>
<br>

I've also watched a piano get delivered to a music theater in New York.  There was a ladder blocking the entrance, as the Union Electrician was fixing some lights over the door.  He was on his lunch, but the ladder was there.  The piano sat for an hour outside because the union moving people werent allowed to move the ladder, as it belonged to a union electrician.  SO HELP ME GOD!  Of course, they got paid for that hour.  Then, the union electrician came, and they moving people were allowed to bring it inside.  However, once in side, it had to sit until the union *something else* had to come, because the moving people werent allowed to move anything passed the door.  My friend, who managed the theater, ended up paying through the nose, all because the unions prohibited others from touching the materials on their turf.<br>
<br>
My favorite times are when unions like the Flight Attendants go on strike.  They get paid very well, free travel for them and family members, semi flexable hours, yet strike now and then, because they can.  I'll never forget when there was a strike 2 years ago.  I parked my car in the lot, only to see a BMW with a sign on it saying &quot;Support the Flight Attendant Strike.&quot;  Sorry, something about a $50,000 car and me giving you MORE money that burns me.  <br>
<br>
I don't think the Dot.commers can take all the blame.  Surely, their getting paid $150,000 right out of college and getting a swimming pool as part of their hiring package but distress on some companies, no doubt.  But our fiscal strength is a function of high tech, manufacturing, and other issues.  The fact that so many dot.coms went to the crapper can't be the case for Coca-cola having a bad year :) Banks, equiment manufacturers, etc.  Everyone's getting hammered.  <br>

I know that unions were the major factor in getting working conditions changed for the better in the 20th century. I know it got the scale of wages a bit more standard. However they fell to corruption. The most visible corruption is the auto industry. I grew up, for the most part, in a suburb of Detroit. Auto union dealings were a daily part of the news. Mostly bad. Fat cats like Jimmy Hoffa got their palms greased by money and it went down hill from there.<br>
One recent union dealing really bites my ass. The northwest airlines mechanics union settled, but there is a huge faction of people within the union who feel the 24 percent raise isn't enough. Apparently they want as much pay as those who fly the birds!<br>
Regarding the dot-commers, somewhere in time everyone thought that every person who started a web based business would be guarenteed or entitled to make intense profits. HAH to you!!<br>
To every would be investor who saw some tv commercial and blindly put his hard earned money into bad investments, doom on you dickie.<br>
The economy will eventually rebound, but only after the current crop of overpayed top executives are given golden parachutes and leave the mess for others to clean up. <p>We climb the highest 
mountain, just to get a better view
We plumb the deepest oceans, 
cause we're daring through and through.
We cross the scorching desert, 
Martini in our hand.
We ski the polar icecaps,
in tuxedo looking grand.
We are reckless, brave and loyal, and valiant til the end.
If you come in here a stranger, you will exit as a friend.

KUNGALOOSH!
