<br>
Yes this is my first character<br>
I clearly know how to play my character since I did manage to get to 60.<br>
 And about the part calling me a newbie ya, i am a newbie its my first character after all but look at you kead. I probably know more about this game then you do.  Just because i didnt know anything 40 levels ago doesnt meani know nothing now. So kead, feel free to call me a clueless newbie but as I said i probably know alot more then you do about this game and the pathetic part is i just started it.<br>
<br>
Continue to hate me all because of that one group I was with you in Velk. You made stupid comments about IV trying to start shit up and then I just starting giving it back , which ended up in you leaving the group then logging. BTW , that was the best day i did have , i felt i accomplished something when you left the group and logged (kind of like you went away crying like a little bitch).<br>
<br>
Oh yeah Kead, I really did LOVE the way you kept bragging about your gear that day (Krular and Endren and I was there too) and about how your bard twink gets l33t bard loot (nice touch man).<br>
<br>
As for another rant, I also do remember when PO had alot of people then all of a sudden lost the whole high level player base you had (many joined IV). Why did you lose those people kead? I think it had something to do with you being on a power trip and thinking you control everything.  Your a guild leader of Prome order who has many nice people in it but i am not sure how they can choose to follow the likes of a dolt. Kead you are like a virulent disease that has plagued this server and the only reason people know you is because of your guild (still not sure why people stay in the guild). Everyone in PO should make like the people who left long ago and leave kead (the disease) to just fade away with nothing to feed off of. <p>Menexia aixeneM<br>

If you would stop hording the fucking blue diamonds you get on raids and selling them for cash maybe you can distribute them amongst your members for some resist gear.<br>
<br>
All those raids in POG add up in blue diamonds and from allt he PO people i have spoke to, none of the members have seen any of those blue diamonds.  So where are they? they helping twink your bard? Im also sure you have been in Hate and hate blue diamonds come as a dime a dozen, so start giving them out and your members will have resist gear for the gimp dragon talendor.<br>
<br>
Loot being done by a leader who is the exact opposite of selfless should be done by rolling on shit because the bitch ass greedy leader keeps everything for him self<br>
<br>
P.S. To the PO people, majority of you probably still need resist gear etc. make sure you ask kead where the blue diamonds are. <p>Menexia aixeneM<br>

Erm, they all go to Khar, who them makes resist gear and hands them out, sometimes 30-40 pieces at a time.  Perhaps our newest members haven't gotten a ton of them yet (since we haven't been in Hate in what, 6 weeks?), but they do get distributed.<br>

<br>
Well, I'm really gonna be branded after this one I'm sure, but what the hell, it's a Friday, and I'm feeling wacky.<br>
<br>
For the last 3 months, we have had exactly *1* bard in the guild that was active - Alyen.  We also did not have anyone else that played a bard alt, so when duplicate/inferior loot to what Alyen had came up, it was either used in trades for other goodies, or, yeah, Kead put it on his alt (which from what I've seen, gets played maybe an hour a week)<br>
<br>
We have within the last couple of days guilded another bard, and I'm sure he'll end up inherating most of those goodies.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Well, I've mentioned loot, Kead, Alyen, and ghey bards all in one post.  The reaction should be somewhere between blazin' and thermonuclear.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/urhyustreetfighter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rhyu Streetfighter</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 192<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/24/01 5:53:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Anika...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Ideally you work together and/or split the pulls to make it that much faster<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
The reasoning here isn't flawed, it makes very good sense.  But I seem to remember a little trouble we had in *fear* one day when we wanted to try this.  Oh, yes, I forgot, as kead told Jaydrox when he summoned kead and I over to him, you guys were in fear to have fun, but when you guys are in ToV it's not?<br>
<br>
I don't mean for this to turn into another one of those threads about what happened that day...those were the ones that got so stupid we just all out stopped replying hehe. =)  I'm just saying, we time after time have tried, but when shit like that happens in ***FEAR*** it's sorta hard for us to expect it to work in ToV, wouldn't you agree? <p><br><font color=orange><font type=bold>Rhyu</></>

However, when was the last time you saw 3 guilds with 100+ people in Fear working together and staying out of people's way?  I haven't.  I *did* however see that in ToV.  Cooperation can actually work in EQ, it's just so damn hard to get everyone on the same page.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm not here to start some pissing contest.  We've (meaning PO) have screwed up too, and I've jumped on Kead for doing the same stuff I just on other people about.  We all have room to improve, it's just that sometimes those darn human emotions called pride and ego kick in, and I guess I'll have to follow that statement with saying that I'm just as guilty as anyone else.  /shrug. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uqxired.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Q Xired</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 199<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/24/01 6:58:48 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Anika...</span><hr size=1> shouldnt this be titled &quot;I don't usually rant but...&quot; <p>Quarken Xired

You have a problem with me based on what? The day you came a begged to be in my exp group and I let you join?<br>

Sure, I'd be upset if I tried to claim that every quest gem that dropped should default to me too. Afterall, you deserved them more right? 6 people working in that group, you didn't mention anything about needing those gems to complete armor drops you alread had so you didn't need any of them afaik, so we /randed. You rolled low and I still gave you one(3 dropped), just not the CFE you were drooling on.<br>

I do remember saying the only gems i wanted were the CFEs and didnt care about the rest (a lot dropped i think?)  The problem i have with u is your complete inconsistency and your 'im going to snitch on IV' attitude.  Seriously, you should feel lucky that IM not in charge of IV, cause i would have no problems running over your scrawny little ass when u say shit like that.  Like ive said...i like a lot of PO members.  This little crusade you have started isn't going to accomplish any good, so why are you even bothering?  Dunno, seems like a waste of time to me, but good job bringing shit up that happened 2 months ago!<br>
<br>
What all this bullshit is leading up to is the next time we bump heads in ToV, we will just move ahead of you so we can pass and not even try to work something out.  I dont want to do that, but i will if you guys refuse to cooperate /shrug.  It's up to you guys, you can make things easy or hard...the only people it hurts are the innocent players in your guild.  IV has some very nice people, but we will steamroll if u bullshit us the way u have been.  We were nice to u guys the other night when u were in fear, because we wanted CT, but we didnt want to 'ruin your fun' again.  If u keep on posting shit like this Alyen / Kead, what are the chances of us being nice to u guys again ?  Dunno, keep shooting yourself in the foot if u want though heh<br>

wowowowowow...clearly had to repost those lines as they were just too massive to only read once<br>

I move that we put Xarr in as our new PR guy.  Hell, if Xarr and Plumpkin were put in charge of that there'd be no bitching at all!<br>

<br>
Yeah Menexia, it's posts like that one that convince me you're still a clueless noob.  To date I have sold exactly ZERO blue diamonds.  That's right, ZERO.  I did trade a few away for spells... must make me a loot whore for trading gems earned by the guild for spells I so desperately needed.  After all, what is a warrior without his spells?  <br>
<br>
Oh yah, I gave a few blue diamonds away too, once upon a long time ago.  Back when nobody had blue diamonds and a guild was prepping for their first Trak run.  They were hurting for resist gear and offered to buy any blue diamonds we had.  We had 2, and since they had helped us in the past, I just gave the blue diamonds to the guild leader, gratis.  Wasn't thanked for it, but that's ok.  You're welcome anyway, Krimzin.  I know, I know... it was mean spirited of me, but that's just the mean jerk I am.<br>
<br>
Trust me, with the exception of some of our very newest members, everyone has plenty of blue diamond gear.  The gems and the velium bars were almost all supplied by the guild as well.  <br>
<br>
And yeah, we still have an extra PoG flute or two, like the one I offered to sell Krular that morning in Velks.  He didn't want it, preferring instead the flute from Fear.  We disagreed on which was better and why but no biggie... Like Rhyu mentioned in another post, there are different ways to play a character and so you choose different gear to reflect your own personal style.  So yah, my twink bard has a pog flute, Alyen has a PoG flute, our new bard has a PoG flute, a bard from what was Endless wound up w/ a PoG flute and I think I still have one banked, not positive though.<br>
<br>
Your problem that morning is the same as it is now... you don't have a clue as to what you're talking about. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/upyneforrester.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pyne Forrester</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 106<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/25/01 11:14:10 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> bards and flutes</span><hr size=1> I have a twink bard that only has a skin flute currently and would love an upgrade<br>
