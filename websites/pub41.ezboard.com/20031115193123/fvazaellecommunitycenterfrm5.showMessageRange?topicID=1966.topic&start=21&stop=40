This war is about saving lives.  No one in the civilized world wants more war to kill more people, but sometimes you are dragged kicking and screaming into war.  We've done everything else we possibly can to get Saddam to disarm, he's just not going to comply, he's a madman.  We have to shut him down before he makes World War 3 or kills millions of people.<br>
<br>
It sucks that we have to go through this crap, but if you want to blame someone for starting the war, look at Iraq.<br>
<br>
The only reason the French don't want to fight this war is because they've secretly been supplying Saddam with conventional weapons as well as components of weapons of mass destruction and it will hurt their wallets.<br>
<br>
Will a few bombs probably kill innocent civilians? I'm sure.  Is that better than killing 10 million innocent civilians, or more, with weapons of mass destruction? To me it clearly is.<br>

<br>
Iraq must be leveled if the war is to be fought and have the desired goal, at the very least Baghdad.  To do this, the current theory seems to be to have a massive front strike force.  Meaning a massive air strike to start off the war and then having infantry plow across the country after strategic targets have been neutralized.  <br>
<br>
Well, to support the aircraft you need air bases.  In the earlier gulf war Saudi Arabia was the main or at least one of the major staging points.  They, and all the nations bordering Iraq, save for Kuwait, it seems, are holding out for UN approval of the invasion.  This means little air base support and having air bases very close to the &lt;Hiraquis&gt; and alot more danger for the support crews.  Bush seeks to avoid this and staging aircraft carriers off the Kuwaiti coastline.  This is why forces are being held back and full mobilization hasn't been put into effect IMHO.  Why put your forces into a more dangerous situation if you don't have to?  Forward air bases will have to be setup inside Iraq to provide enough basing area for the desired strike force without more neighboring countries approval.  Setting this up while the 1st strike is in process and loitering aircraft would be ideal for a fast second strike.<br>
<br>
The way to send a message with war is a bloodbath.  As bad as it sounds it is true.  Merely removing Sadaam and his family from existence wouldn't stop another leader with the same &quot;vision&quot; from replacing him or starting the same thing anywhere in the world.<br>
<br>

Ahhh but why did the US get beaten in Vietnam?<br>
Essentially the US forces got eaten away by guerilla tactics.  Small raid after small raid upon their forces and forward bases eventually ground us out of the terrain.  Without public support in the US, proper support wasn't given and eventually the front line was pushed back to the starting point.  Many lessons were learned in Vietnam. <p><br>

I guess it only counts if it's 60 years ago?  Certainly not in a lifetime you experienced I'm sure.  You are apparently unfamiliar with your country (IE: the British) decimating our country in two seperate wars, and putting our citizens to death for merely not supporting their right to rule us. I assure, you, we have not forgotten. Our country is VERY familiar with the horrors of war in as much as you yourself are familiar with them. I like to think we've learned how far dictatorship gets this world, can you say the same?<br>

<br>
Well if you want to get technical, yes. James the First was King of Scotland. When his relative Queen Elisabeth died in 1603. He united England and Scotland and called it, get this, Great Britain.<br>
<br>
So Scotland did indeed have a &quot;modicum of power&quot; in the past 8 centuries, in fact within the past 5 centuries (24th of this year marks 500 years since James I took the throne of England. Gratz Jhardzia!) and yes within that time they were living under a SCOTTISH King, as was everyone in England at that time. <br>
<br>
So Ayiar, it might be best to stop using movies as historical references for your posts. You'll just end up owning yourself everytime. <p>Prybutok Agonista<br>

Well, as far as the French jokes, they are quite common in America now.  I've seen bumper stickers that say &quot;Iraq first, France next&quot;.  I saw a news story about an 80 year old American former soldier who had been part of D-Day and who had helped liberate France from the Germans.  He had gotten a certificate from the French government which he mailed back this week to them saying they could return it when they could pay friendship more than lip service.   Look at the Freedom Fries/French Fries thing in the Capitol.  The bottom line is that Americans are very angry as a whole with the French.  We considered them allies for a long time.  However, now the United States is under attack and the French are cockblocking us as we try to defend ourselves so they can sell more weapons to Saddam Hussein.  Of course Americans are angry at France, it's hard not to be.  Americans will be killed by the weapons the French have sold to the Iraqis.  It's a betrayal.<br>
<br>
I don't think people like Wilundar are motivated by financial greed or desire to maintain dictators in power.  Wilundar may be a bit naive in thinking that war is not necessary, but it comes from a sort of idealism and a desire for peace.  Most Americans, including me, do not believe that the actions of the French government are motivated by anything other than a desire to line their wallets without regard to the safety of the rest of the world or the many innocent people who have and will lose their lives to this tyrant wielding French weapons.<br>

Ayiar basically said what I wanted to.  Scotland isn't a country, so true, it didn't really do anything very wrong.  It didn't because it never had the power to.  Great Britain has done plenty.  There are incidents in the American revolution as bad as or worse than the Mei Lai incident and that's the tip of the iceberg.<br>
<br>
As far as Vietnam, the war was lost for several reasons.  First, the north vietnamese were being aided substantially by the Soviet Union.  Vietnam was essentially a war between the US and USSR with pawns involved (the Vietnamese).  Second, the US had no popular support for the war and no will to win.  We trickled in troops slowly instead of applying the massive force needed to win.  The war was fought horribly from a tactical point of view.  This war has strong public support (last poll I saw 55 percent support Bush, 37 percent oppose, rest are undecided).  The United States can easily crush Saddam (see the previous Gulf War).  Finally, you have this image that the people of Iraq believe in Saddam and will fight to the death for him.  Take a look at the link earlier in this thread.  The British were doing training exercises in Kuwait and the Iraqis ran across the border to surrender.  Hmm, is that fighting to the death?  I think not.<br>

<br>
Because you were doubting it ? It is quite sad that you arent even sure that french people are against saddam's - like dictatorships.<br>
<br>
We all agree on the fact that Saddam is a dictator, what we dont agree on is on the fact that he &quot;heavily threatens the US&quot; (cf the CIA still looking for evidences).<br>
Personnaly i could care less about a war, if US are going, they will pay the price, it doesnt really concern me. However it scares me a bit that after half a century of cold war, a preventive war is the new &quot;standart&quot; <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=473215">Karenne Kharne<br>
