Yes the wonderful topic of loot. The four letter word that can ruin friendships, reputation and tear a guild apart. So I'll post here and let all the trial members know how Odysseys do their loot distribution. Happy reading, it's long.<br><br><br><br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      1. Loot will be handed out based on merit, on a need basis.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br><br>Merit means, how much has that player contributed to the guild. Need, means how much of an improvement is the loot to the player's current equipment, and how will this loot strengthen the guild. Odysseys goal is to equip players that would give a significant improvement rather than a small improvement and at the same time strengthen the guild. <br><br>For example tanks (warriors, knights) needs high AC armors and equipment compared to other classes like ranger or rogues. It's common sense. <br><br><br><br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>     2. Who will be considered for the loot? Loots will be considered for full members &gt; trial members &gt; apps/invitees.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>In the case of 2 full members wanting the same thing, here are the things that will be considered: <br><br>a. how much of an improvement is this item<br>b. commitment to the guild - how much have you participated at guild raids<br>c. personality - if you're an asshole, loot whorish and a common jerk forget about it. <br>d. levels/seniority - should it still be a tie breaker, the one with the higher level will most likely be merited the item<br><br>The same breakdown of decisions apply for trial members, and apps/invitees, should there be more than 1 of you that wanted the loot.<br><br><br><br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>     3. Who decides on the loot? Officers do, it's not unusual to see a piece of loot on a corpse for more than 15 mins without anybody announcing who got it. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Officers tend to argue and debate among themselves as to who should get the item. Their intention is to make sure that loot is distributed evenly in the guild (we're not twinking one particular person), and that who would benefit that piece of loot. What's important is that, we do not want to hold on to loots, and ensure that piece of loot belongs to the right person. <br><br>For example: plate armor in ToV. These things drop like candy, but even so, we're not going to award each and every piece that drops to one particular person so that he/she can complete their armor. Instead, we tend to spread it all out, warriors first, then knights, bards, then clerics. Not one person will walk out of ToV with more than 2 pieces of plate armor if we try, unless off course there are 13 plate wearing classes there, and 13 plate boots dropped and 1 plate gauntlet.<br><br><br><br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>     4. Special Cases. There are cases when loot will not be decided on the spot by the officer, and that the piece of loot is usually kept for further discussion among officers in the officers forum.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>What warrants a special case? Well cases like Slug, Lodi, Woushi or all other small semi-hard small raid force required critter that drops a droppable uber/semi-uber loot. Loots like <br>CoCW, Lodi shell, Cbol, Scimitar of emerald dawn. Sometimes, the players present at the ganks are already equipped with items of similar value (haste), or of little upgrade, or that the one person that needs it and wants it is an asshole, then these items will be kept for further discusion. <br><br>Sometimes the items will be merited to members of the guild that were not present at that particular gank, but that is rare. Guild would like to reward those that came to help out, but items that would improve the guild overall is what the guild would like to aim for.<br><br><br><br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>     5. Other items that required to be decided before hand. Items such as bracer of benovelence, or fusible velium ore from guardian kozzalym, or the ore from master yael.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>This will often be decided by who needs it, who has been to the most kills, a vote from members present at the gank and by the officer present.<br><br>Example: Scout Charisa in WW. Item:Bracer of Benovelence, talisman or robe. Who gets the disc to turn in to the scout after it's over? First of all, who needs it? If more that 1, usually it is, how many scout gank have you been to? if equal, then we take a vote from the players present to find out who deserves this piece of loot. If it's still a tie, (god please let it not be) then the pplayers that wants that item random for it. <br><br>Please if you already have 1 bracer, and the next person does not, let them have the bracer, the overall strength of the guild is more important than your own uberness.<br><br><br><br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>     6. Alts. No we wil not be meriting loots to alts, unless there are no more present that would benefit that particular loot other than that alt.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Most of us do have characters of similar level to our main characters. This is when we tend to be playing them at some of the guild's raids as well. While it's not what the guild wants out of you, but if it's ok with the officers to play your alts at the raid, then it's ok. But more often than not, the Guild requires you to play your main. There are also time when the Guild will ask that you play your alt.<br><br>Which means, once you are guilded, you need to determine who is your main! Do not keep switching your characters at raids. We will not consider alt and main as 2 seperate characters, but as the same person. So choose wisely who you want to play as your main may miss out on the loot, if he's not present.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>     Special cases:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> There are folks in the guild that has 2 chars that they play as main. They have been given certain rights and permission by the officers and leader of the guild, as both characters are needed at raids. It has also been determined that of the characters only 1 of them will be considered for loots, unless there are none present that would benefit from that piece of loot other that the alt.<br><br><br><br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>     7. Donations to the guild bank. This a welcomed and encouraged gesture, especially once you've obtained an upgrade for that particular piece of armor, or weapon through the guild's effort. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Such things like kunark armor that you've replaced with skyshrine armor or thurgadin armor. While it is not required, but it is encouraged, and that the passable loot will find a new home among the members of the Guild.<br><br>Other items that are encouraged to be donated to the guild bank is the quest gems. Until more effort is done towards farming more quest gems, contributions from members are most welcomed. The bank is giving out more gems than it is receiving. Guild would like to ensure that there is a steady supply so that folks that has been merited quest armors would not have to wait for a long time before they are able to complete their quest armors. <br><br><br><br><br><br>Ok I think that is all that I have to say about how Odysseys handle loots, and it's distribution. For Trial members, you are also considered for loots, but do know that full members will be given first consideration. <br><br>On a side note, play your game well, get your levels, attend raids, contribute to the guild (this means help each other out, epics, xp, cr and not just raids) and above all your attitude and personality will most definately ensure you a big consideration and edge when the time comes for loot to be decided whether it'll be you or lootwhore_00.<br><br><br><br><br> <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=62453>Jaraan Stonebow</a><br><center><b>Warder of Odysseys</b></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ujaraan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jaraan</A> at: 7/22/02 4:16:55 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uterenya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Terenya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Purser</span><br>  Posts: 423<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/11/02 1:46:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fodysseyxevfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Loots</span><hr size=1> could not have said it any better<br><br>Hugs Jaraan<br> <p>Terenya Trueheart - Lvl 60 HierophantOfficer of Odysseys<img src=http://home.mindspring.com/~malousek/_uimages/Cheeky.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ujoylove.showPublicProfile?language=EN>joylove</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/21/02 11:26:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fodysseyxevfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> My Thought on Loot</span><hr size=1> Since my Mid level 30's I have been part of a loot collective similar to the Guild's concept.

I gave him two that dropped even though he was not there. sheesh..Threre was no lvl 60 spell that dropped off juggs while he was there that he should be demanding to have. As spells were being given to me you think I was checking them all? Over 100 spells that night dropped. Most of them were being told to me as they were given to me. On top of that, Yil arrived ten minutes before we were done doing the farming. That was after i stated in guild chat that those who were present would get first crack on spells. All other spells we had received would go to bank to be distributed evenly amongst those that can use  them. Up until I made that statement in guild  chat, Yil was not present for the first two hours of farming. <br><br><br>Lots of classes were not present that night. Spells have been given out fairly so far to those who can use them as in lvl appropriate. We are not giving one single person all the spells just cause they need them. All of our casters need spells. Would not be fair to give them all to one person just because they feel they should have them all. I will state again, spells will be distrubed evenly amongst casters. Once I have them sorted which I intend on working on today,  will be posted. If spells on the list are needed , the person who needs will post on what they need. They then will be given out fairly amongst who needs. They have not been sorted yet as I have had no time to do so. Seems to me we have been raiding every day since that first night of farming. <br><br>And if he is talking about Sunstrike, that did not fall off juggs while I was there. Seems to me it fell in Ssra and I was not holding loot that night. Grubby was. Only wiz spells I know that came from juggs were lvl 56 - 58 spells. I will know better after I have been given some time to sort them out.<br><br>As per my above statement from Jaraan's post on loot we will take Malo ( rare very expensive spell) as an example. If it drops and two shaman in guild need, it will be held until it has been discussed where that spell will &quot;most benefit the guild&quot;. Loot is not about one person's needs. It's about the guild as a whole's needs. I like Joy's statement from another post -- There is no &quot;I&quot; in Teamwork.<br><br>Here is the list that Yil needs : <br><br>- Levitation (Level 51).<br>- Vengeance Of Alkabor (Level 59).<br>- Disintegration (Level 60).<br>- Suntrike (Level 60).<br>- Winds of gegil (Level 60).<br>- Elnerick's Electrical Rending (Level 60).<br>- Firetree's Familiar Enhancement (Level 60).<br>- Garrison's Superior Sundering (Level 60).<br>- Greater Familiar (Level 60).<br><br>I gave him Tears of Prexus and Markers Discord that night. Two spells I know he has needed in a long time. I gave him those even though he was not present when they dropped. Only lvl 60 spell on that list that I know has dropped is Sunstrike and I know I don't have it.

Juggs seperately, and Gore separately. <br><br>Juggs<br><br>Here's how it has been with juggs spell farming, or any spell farming for that matter. Spells drop, someone in the kill group loot and pass it to an officer present at the raid. Announce it in guild. By the end of the night, when the raid is over, spells will be announced (or mayber later) and whoever was present at the event may ask for the spell that they need. Or you can post it on the forum. If there are spells that nobody present at the event can use, it'll be banked until it is sorted out and handed out later. Although there are times when the spells will be handed out on the spot, as they drop. <br><br>Gore<br><br>Dragon loots. Rare spells, rare items, and epic pieces. This is when 1 officer does not make the decision alone. It'll be a collective decision. It may end up couple of days before a decision is made, except for the epic piece where someone will be awarded the loot. Does melee loot or armor differ from spells? Usually it'll be Grubb or the leading officer at the dragon raid that will announce who gets what. So in the meantime, please be patient, there are other things more pressing than a piece of loot. <br><br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Ok I think that is all that I have to say about how Odysseys handle loots, and it's distribution. For Trial members, you are also considered for loots, but do know that full members will be given first consideration. <br><br>On a side note, play your game well, get your levels, attend raids, contribute to the guild (this means help each other out, epics, xp, cr and not just raids) and above all your attitude and personality will most definately ensure you a big consideration and edge when the time comes for loot to be decided whether it'll be you or lootwhore_00.<br><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br><br>Do note that the guild does not like to hold on to loots that is needed by a main full member of the guild. There is no reason for us to sell it when there are members in the that guild needs it. If you think we're holding on to loots so that we can sell it and earn money, for what? We have more than enough money in the bank to cover our expenses on peridots, coffins, pearls and TL gem thingies by selling all the other stuff that nobody in the guild wanted. I know that some loots has been held with the bank far longer that necessary, and for that we're sorry. <br><br>The officers of the guild are working to ensure you guys enjoy raiding and being a part of this guild while being rewarded with the loots from the riches that we reaped off our kills. Are we getting paid to do this? No. Are we enjoying our work? Yes, it's a great pleasure and honor to be serving such wonderful folks, but nobody is perfect, therefore not everyone is wonderful to work with. While others gave up trying to work with a difficult person, there are others that are willing to work out a solution. Do the officers only keep phat loots to themselves? No, but do realize that there's an officer present at most of the event. If the pioece of loot drop, it does not mean he/she wants that piece of loot, rather it'll be too difficult to just pass a judgement there on the spot. We'd rather let the other officers know what dropped and who would benefit from this. <br><br>And if you wish to know how I decide loots, read the qoutes that I added above. It's what I go with. I'd rather be rewarding those that has the right attitude with this guild, provided they have done their share of raiding, and contributions to the guild. If you find yourself without any piece of loot after a while even though some of them are usable by your class, you might want to question yourself why you're being passed over on loot. Is it your attitude and behavior? If you think this is not fair, then I think you should give a deeper thought on why are you with this guild. This guild was founded by a group of friends who liked to do the high end encounter and enjoy being around each other. Which means your attitude and personality that you bring into the guild matters most! It's not about what equipment you are wearing or what class you are, or the level you are. It's all about the attitude and personality of the character that you're playing. If you say you are roleplaying (snobby erudite, selfish hateful dark elf, a condescending high elf, a lazy ogre etc)......I may have misunderstood you, for that I'm sorry. <p><center><img src=http://home.mindspring.com/~malousek/_uimages/JaraanSig.jpg><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=62453>Jaraan Stonebow</a><br><center><b><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bodysseyxev>Warder of Odysseys</a></b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uaalandandustbone.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aalandan Dustbone</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.sovereignsmight.com/sigs/icon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fellow Traveler of Norrath</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/23/02 2:07:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fodysseyxevfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://users.ev1.net/~stang73/aalpics/aalwarlockrobe.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Loots</span><hr size=1> Sunstrike dropped when there was ONE group there - me, grubb, Jwiz, and 3 others - none of which were Yili.<br><br>Wtf is the attitude ?

I was there when yer Sunstrike dropped.  You werent there.  Neither was Dabin....but I dont see a "gimme the spell or I quit" whiny post from him here....<br><br>As far as SM goes, the new officers of SM didnt get along well with the old officers, and 4 of us departed, myself after a long bout with one of them.  I was also an officer in HC, and left to create SM.  I also was a founder of Guardian Brotherhood on Povar, a guild still going strong today, and of which my necro over there is a member, although very seldom played.  So suffice it to say I have extensive experience officering in EQ, helping others, mentoring, leading raids, as well as disciplinary actions with members as they needed to be talked to (I really hated that part of the job....)<br><br>But my leaving SM wasnt about my attendance at raids, nor was it my attitude towards loot - however the issue right now is....specifically that you feel you simply deserve it due to level - oh and the now classic line : "give it to me or i quit the guild".<br><br>Back to the topic, you weren't there when Sunstrike dropped.  You and Dabin are both lvl 60 wizzies - he wasnt there either : should he get a shot if he doesnt have?<br><br>And as to setting up raids, your idea of doing those PBAE raids is fine and dandy, but doing it on Fridays is wrong.  Im surprised if you dont know why, but lemme spell it out : Fri is TOV.  Just as you have "planned in advance" - so has our Guildleader.  <br><br>Hey, I freaking HATE tov, and dont need anything for any of my 3 main toons I use (Fenben, Aal, or Benelli).  Well maybe a plate BP, but I wouldnt think of even sending a tell for one if everyone there didnt already have one.  But I'm there, every time, thru every boring kill - because the guild needs me.  And many others of our guild need the loot that drops here.  I sacrafice the fun I would have to help out on Fri nights - I sit bored out of my mind avoiding AOEs all night long, cause its for the greater good, bud.  <br><br>So why are you setting raids up in advance that directly contradict the plans the rest of this RAIDING GUILD have set aside?<br><br>And if some spell drops that you need it (say we kill a named and a Luclin spell ya need drops) - would you expect it to go to you ?  <br><br>I havent known you too long, and hope that the tone of this post doesnt set you against it before you reach the underlying message, and the message is : you need to change the plans for your PBAE raids to off raid nights.  And the officers should ensure that we actually have one or two off raid nights, so that you can plan ahead as well.<br><br>As to spells and alts and your generousity, I dont know about all that.  I purchased and traded for and killed for all my alts spells up to 58.  I never once took a spell from any guild raid or anything.  Tears of prexus cost me 600pp, and about 2 hrs in Gfay.  Markars discord I beleive I got off a shroom or a jugg when I FD my butt down there and soloed several near the water.  This way my alts are equipped and therefore not a burden to the guild.<br><br>As to spells being announced when they drop.....well in this I truly agree with you.  IMO all loot should be announced when it drops...even if we disseminate it later.  Would be nice to know what drops when it drops.  But as to my experience, most of the time all loot is announced.<br><br>Also, I'm not saying you are a burden - please dont get me wrong.  All I'm saying is that you need to back off the "gimme my spells that dropped or I leave" - cause that attitude is pretty lame.  And before ya react angrily to that, think : you would think the same thing if some tank got mad he didnt get some uber tradeable sword if he was off in Sebillis when the guild killed some dragon....wouldnt you?  So why would it be different for you?<br><br>Anyways, see ya in game.  <br> <p><BR><EMBED SRC="http://users.ev1.net/~stang73/aalsig/lvl60.swf" WIDTH="500" HEIGHT="220" BORDER="0"></embed> <BR>Aalandan Dustbone <BR>60th Level Human Warlock <BR>Odysseys<BR><BR><i>"Play to have fun.

But as Board Moderator for the old SM boards, we did delete posts where the guild was being dragged down in general, or where officers were being put down just for the sake of being put down, particulalry when members were just about to leave.  There wasnt a point to keep it there, draggin everyone down.  I dont know if that is what Cab/Dec's post was like, I'm just saying thats what we did with such offensive posts.  And usually it was done with the agreement of a few officers online just to make sure it wasnt a power trip thing (not saying what happened here was a power trip thing, just giving an example.<br><br>Oh, bout Dabin not being 60, my bad....I thought he was.<br><br>Anyways, no biggie, might as well move forward and scratch it up to not getting the whole story and a misunderstanding or something.  <br><br>All I know is, its 4:45am and Im still at work :(<br><br><br>PS.
