<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
So I'm at my desk, trying to finish a grant proposal to get a lot of $$ from the State Dept.  A rather less-than-intelligent looking girl strolls into the front office and stands with a vacant stare on her face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi, where is the Institute of Religion?&quot; she says.<br>
<br>
Well, seeing how there are at least 14 different organizations here on the UC campus with some variation of that name, tell me a little more about what you need, I say.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm Mormon.&quot; she replies.<br>
<br>
And I'm a Scientologist, but thanks for sharing.  Now, what does that have to do with it?<br>
<br>
After interrogating her for about 2 more minutes, I deduce she is in fact searching for the local top-secret military compound HQ of the Church of Latter-Day Saints.  &quot;Institute of Religion&quot; is the little title the Mormon church has given to it's churches, because, of course, their church is the only religion.<br>
<br>
So, I explain with crystal clarity the route to her compound--- church, excuse me.  <br>
<br>
Fifteen minutes pass.<br>
<br>
She strolls back in, looking even more baffled than before, if this is possible.<br>
<br>
&quot;I couldn't find it.&quot; she informs me, her bullish nosering and badly bleached hair distracting me from the problem at hand.  I contemplate why she's hunting for the church of Mormon.  Perhaps parents can now send them away for reform, much like fat camp.  <br>
<br>
And of course, if you're seeking enlightenment, or directions to your local cult, you should always be sure to stop by the Religious Studies Department.  All the sociologists and staticians and sanskritists here can answer all your questions about spiritual fulfillment.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello?&quot; she asks me again, interrupting my moment of reverie.<br>
<br>
At this point, I lose any semblance of patience, courtesy, or professionalism.  I have just been on the phone with an irate professor who didn't realize shutting off her computer more frequently than once ever 2.5 years would help prolong the life of the fan and power source.  The computer problem is now my fault, of course.<br>
<br>
Reaching across the desk, I rip the Fall course catalog out of her pudgy little hands, tear the back cover with a highly detailed map of the campus off, and proceed to create a map so detailed and explicit, Ray Charles could follow it.<br>
<br>
At the stoplights, I write with my red pen in blazing block letters:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>RED MEANS STOP, YELLOW MEANS SLOW DOWN, GREEN MEANS GO.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
With large, jagged arrows, I mark her path down the campus roads, indicating which lane she should be in.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>TURN LEFT WHEN YOU SEE VOLLEYBALL NETS.  THERE IS SAND AND TWO LARGE POLES IN THE GROUND WITH A NET RUNNING BETWEEN THEM.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
At the approximate location of the compound, I sketch a fortress, complete with barbed wire and guard dogs, above which, giant red letters say:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>INSIMITUDE OF TEH RELOGGIN FOR MOMINS</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The 'S'e are backwards.  This is so she will understand it.<br>
She nods in quiet understanding when I hand her the mangled treasure map and walks out the door.  <br>
<br>
As I almost click the &quot;Add Post&quot; button, I receive a phone call.  It's our lady Magellan again.  She swiped one of my business cards.  <br>
<br>
Now, what bothers me most is not that she's lost again, or even calling me, or even that she now knows my name, number, and place of work, but that she's driving and using a cell phone at the same time.  <br>
<br>
She's probably chewing gum, too.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I still can't find it.&quot; booms over the line.  <br>
<br>
Aim for a tree and step on the right pedal, I say.  I hang up and start finish the grant proposal the fedex guy is coming for in 15 minutes.<br>
<br>

<br>
About 2 years ago, I'm sitting on the helldesk taking calls when this one woman asks me how to change the size of &quot;the pictures&quot; on her computer.  No problems, I try to walk her into Windows display properties and go about changing font sizes, resolutions, and the large icon settings.  None of this is works as she can't figure out what I mean by phrases like &quot;right click on the desktop&quot; or &quot;anywhere on the main screen with nothing open, click on the right side mouse button&quot;.  And she's insisting that I come to her desk and fix it.  Her building is a 20 minute drive from mine and besides as my favorite phrase in the IT world goes &quot;that's not my job&quot;.<br>
<br>
So another half hour passes with me trying everything I can think of to get this woman to change her display properties.  She can't find her Start button to get to control panel.  She doesn't know what I mean by a key with the windows logo on her keyboard.  No, she isn't using a Macintosh.  Eventually she bursts into tears and starts bawling some nonsense at me:<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not a computer person.  I've only been working on them.  I've been working on computers for 30 years but my eyes aren't so good and I don't understand these things&quot;<br>
<br>
She hung up before I could point out she had been working on computers a year longer than I'd even been alive and she somehow expected me to help her...  I made a luser cry... That was the best workday I've ever had... I hate people=] <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=truthreason>TruthReason</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I'm actually Goanad.</span><br>  Posts: 294<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/13/02 2:51:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1824.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stupid People and Customer Service</span><hr size=1> If she's blond, good looking, and on the phone with you again....it can only mean one thing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
and this pisses me off.  a lot.  a large number of issues our society faces are a direct result of this incredible ignorance.  subversive forces don't need to pull wool over our eyes because most of us don't understand the significance or scope of world and environmental issues, and even if they did, these things would come secondary to the entertainment industry, sports, gaming, and other trivial distractions.<br>

These findings were the result of sociologists' research. <br>
<br>
I'm starting to wonder whether the last quarter of the 21st century isn't one big assed experiment where, at least in western industrialized countries, the supreme being says &quot;Let's see how we can fuck with these humans and see how they react to being overworked, overstressed, etc.&quot; <br>
<br>
How do we or did we react? Gravitate towards politicians without substance, media stimulation that went from reasoned discourse like William Buckley or Phil Donohue to Jerry Springer\Jenny Jones? Families that cracked at the foundation level? While all along people themselves are still objectively just trying to make do and get along from one paycheck to the next. <br>
<br>
Maybe at some level-- life and public discourse is shallower because the body politik has been squashed by circumstance....splat!!! Of course that sounds like the mantra of victim. The real failing was with institutions not being able to support people under the weight of what has happened over the last 40 years. <br>
<br>
People who craft institutions or policies that support institutions in the broader sense of that word seldom are forward thinkers. The next election or next fiscal quarter report is far more centerstage for that type.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fadorib>Fadori B</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/14/02 3:00:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1824.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stupid People and Customer Service</span><hr size=1> I fix metalworking machines, and provide phone support for both customers and coworkers, as well as field service.  My area is basically Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and southern BC, but I live in the Seattle area.  So one day I get a call from our FNG (Fucking New Guy for those who don't know the phrase)  He's our latest and greatest Oregon guy, and is going to load software on a machine.  He's been at this 20+ years, and is a very smurt guy (so I'm told)  So I go through the backup procedure with him, then the install procedure, then the restore procedure.  I tell him to go ahead and do it and call me if he has ANY questions . . . so he backs it up, loads software, then backs up again over his backup.  Of course he doesn't call me or anything, calls my boss and tells him I made a mistake in the procedure I gave him, and thus my boss sends me to go fix it.  Keep in mind, it's after noon so my shift is almost over, and the customer is 6 hours away from me, so I tell my boss ok I'll head down first thing in the morning.  <br>
<br>
That isn't good enough, go there now and fix it, then head back etc etc.  So I drive, and drive, and drive.  I get there, and instead of staying to learn what the fuck he did wrong he heads home, so I call him.  He turned off his cell and wouldn't answer his home phone (damn I wish I could get outta things that easy when I fuck up)  The customer is a good friend of mine, and had been watching my fellow coworker fuck up, had even told him he was making a mistake but no he wouldn't listen . . .<br>
<br>
So anyways, some time in the early morning we get done and I start home, after having a fun night of doing a full system restore.  By 8 AM I'm an hour away from home and my boss is just getting in to work, so I call her.  I explain how he'd fucked up and what I'd done, and I'm headed home to get some much needed sleep, but no, she has another day's worth of work already scheduled and I can either come back to work or not come back, since it was all MY fault the Oregon customer had a problem.<br>
<br>
Now since then, this guy's broken several other machines that I've had to go fix, and just received the highest award at the company christmas party for dedication to the company and all his hard work.  Just thought I'd share, the idiots aren't always on the customer side &gt;&lt;<br>
<br>
And btw, no I don't work for Verant, although I think they'd hire this guy in a heartbeat <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cerosofvazaelle>Ceros of Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1091<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/14/02 8:44:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1824.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stupid People and Customer Service</span><hr size=1> Yeah, incompetence is everywhere, not just by customers.

<br>
I somewhat agree with Goanad, I think a large part of the problem is that people are over-worked and over-stressed which is absurd given the technological acheivements or society develops.  Unfortunately, technology offers most people trivia and while they work more and deal with a toxic environment as part of every day life, the top end of companies and professionals reap true benefits from the advancements of our society and take a larger percentage of a pie than they ever have.  It used to be the average man could have a family, home and car off a middle-class pay check, now a family needs two middle-class pay checks while living in vast debt for most of their lives, and might eventually own their own home.<br>
<br>
Computers improve our efficiency in countless new ways every year, and yet we keep working more more more for less less less.  All we have to show for it are toxic electronic toys made in incredibly polluting sweat shops by those who still have it much much much much worse.<br>
<br>
When most people are over-worked and over-stressed, they don't aspire to improve themselves in their spare time, they aspire to escape and relax at all costs.  The average person has an unhealthy diet designed for speed, is sleep deprived and can't even fix the problems in their own lives, much less deal with politics.  They are perpetually behind, always catching up -- in everything.<br>

Try finding a street in Kansas City with this strategy... <br>
<br>
KC also has that neat feature where the named streets start and stop at random intervals in random spots around the city.<br>

Stupidity breads like wildfire, and school systems have only made it worse over the years.. People are no longer taught to think.. or required to attempt to think for themselves.. <br>
For the past 20 years, school children are taught how to memorize useless facts, and retain the information in their brains long enough to pass a test..  There is a certain ammount of logic that schools currently fail to teach, partly because schools are only worried about their test scores for federal and state funding..<br>
One could blame it entirely on the public school systems.. But alot of private schools arent much better. They too are worried about those same test scores.. Maybe not for funding.. but for status and academic acceptance rates to sell their school.<br>
<br>
*Giggle*  Thinking back to science class.. We werent taught how to tell what direction we were facing by looking at the stars, we were asked to memorize the stars on a picture.. This is the big dipper.. etc.. <br>
We were trained to memorize dates, names, places, capitals.. I before E except after C..   But rarely were we asked why, how.. what would happen if.. Rarely were we ever asked to look for answers beyond the facts listed in our text books.. <br>
<br>
The majority of individuals ive met, that did have a clue.. either possess a desire to learn for themselves.. or had parents that cared enough and had enough desire to teach their children common sense.. <br>
I refuse to leave my daughter's entire education in the hands of schools.. I answer most of her questions, with other questions, (some may be leading questions) but i make her think, and come up with the answers herself...<br>
<br>
Einstein once said.. (ok, i have some book smarts as well as common sense.. )  &quot;The important thing is to never stop questioning... Curiosity has its own reasons for existing.. &quot;   <p>Zullie Zevize<br>

<br>
Relating my views on supidity not only to customer service, but to EQ.. <br>
<br>
There are too many.. who know enough about how to play their class, to get them to lvl 65, and join uber_guild_01.. Mindless repetition grinds, in perfect mathamatical groups..  But alot, havent learned how to think or adapt to not so perfect situations..  <br>
<br>
Yesterday, group doin OOC in tranquility, had war, monk, chanter, shaman, and druid.. doing an OOC for a cleric for exp grind.. Oh heaven forbid two healers arnt enough.. they expect to die and will need a rez?<br>
<br>
I know a lvl 65.. who spent most of his eq days running thru zones on autofollow.. who after playing a year and a half.. can still get lost in some of the most basic noobie zones.. (and no, i guess the compass on the screen doesnt help him much, when he doesnt know what direction he should be running.. ) and now that hes uber enough to have a bard speed pony.. lmao.. he can get lost much faster.. =)<br>
<br>
They learn how to raid in textbook raids, but fail to learn how to adapt to various situations, and too often cant react fast enough when their textbook goes up in flames due to the death of a single person..<br>
<br>
Everyone has those stories.. my latest one is from a few weeks ago.. was uber cleric_01 healing monkey on a pull with three mobs.. (*this is after bragging for 20 mins on their guild's kill of Uber_mob_01*)  Its not that she healed him, mistakes happen, we are all human.. its what happened after she died..  Chanter had mez'd all 3 mobs, I had them slowed.. and And some in the group were talking of their options... camping out aggro?  dragging cleric to another group for a rez while the chanter kept the mobs mez'd.. It actually took me and the monk (who did have a clue and was about to tank em for me if they took much longer deciding) a few mins to convince the 65 oh so uber war, that i could manage to heal him while we just killed the three mobs.. lmao..   (btw.. mana was 70 at the start of the first, and 80 by the end of the third.. lmao)  <br>
<br>
But there are some.. who like to experiment.. who try to learn everything..who know not only their class.. but other classes as well.. and can adapt to any situation.. Those are the people I enjoy playing with, enjoy raiding with.. Afterall.. in textbook groups/raids.. im reduced to being only a buffer/slower.. *giggle* if thats all I did day in and day out.. this would be the dullest game in the world.. for me anyway..  <p>Zullie Zevize<br>
