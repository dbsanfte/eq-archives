------------------------------ <br>
<br>
We wanted to start by letting everyone know how grateful we are for all of the suggestions for improvements that we've received both in EMail and on the various class and server boards. We appreciate all the help you've provided us. <br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
** Spells/Songs ** <br>
<br>
- Fixed a bard lockup bug that would occur randomly with during cast time <br>
- Fixed a song bug that was causing songs to be stuck on, triggered by contact proc buffs procs (such as Boon of the Garou) <br>

- Egress and Abscond have a reduced mana cost and a lesser chance to fizzle <br>
- Judgement has been improved to make it a better upgrade from the previous spell in the spell line <br>
- Shaman group buff spells (Tumultuous Strength and the Talisman spells - Cat, Brute, Rhino, and Raptor) have been improved to be more in line with the single target versions of those spells. <br>
- Added a new line of spells for Magicians that summons focus items <br>
- /pet get lost will now kill the buff as well as the familiar <br>
- Marzin's Mark now stack with Protection of the Glades <br>
- Improved the way that Abolish Disease/Poison and Counteract Disease/Poison work <br>
- Fixed it so that whenever a player loses the chance to click on a resurrection dialogue box (such as entering the inventory screen), the game will react as if the user had clicked "no". This should prevent cases where the player can not be resurrected unless they logged out <br>

- Vyzh`dra the Cursed has been adjusted to help balance the risk versus reward associated with the encounter <br>
<br>
<br>
** Items ** <br>
<br>
- Sleeper's Tomb Key is now Soulbound <br>
- Wand of Casual Blessings is not longer usable by Half-Elves, and is usable by Dark Elves and Gnomes. It also now looks like a staff and not a bag <br>
- Corrected some of the Velious quest helm graphics. All helms of this type are no longer displaying a graphic (as intended) and the 'customized' plate helms should all now have graphics (also as intended) <br>
- Custom Malevolent Crown should now be the same color as the rest of the armor set <br>
- The Beastlord Epic item has been changed to be more in line with other epic items <br>

- Shield of Auras should now have a graphic <br>
<br>
<br>
** Combat ** <br>
<br>
- Pets are now more likely to avoid NPC ripostes <br>
- Wizards now have an inherent chance to score a critical blast with their damage spells after 11th level. This ability does not lessen the chance of scoring a critical hit with Alternate Experience abilities that grant criticals <br>
<br>
<br>
** Client/Interface ** <br>
<br>
- Added /dopropertinting command. This command allows you to turn on and off the "DoProperTinting" option in the eqclient.ini file. Activating this command should correct most tinting issues (such as armor tint also tinting the character's skin). But if it causes issues you can toggle it off by using /dopropertinting off <br>
- Added /chat commands, that allow players to create their own chat channels. Please read the eqmanual_supplement.doc in your EverQuest directory for more information <br>
- Added /hitsmode command. This command allows you to more finely control how you see hits, including seeing them in a window other than your chat window. Please see the eqmanual_supplement.doc for more details <br>
- Added /clearhits to clear the current hits in the M2-M5 modes of the /hitsmode command. Again, please see the eqmanual_supplement for more information <br>
- Added /showgrass command. This toggles the radial flora (Luclin only) on and off <br>
- Added options in the Options screen (under Chat Filter) for filtering out Melee and Spell criticals. Options are All/Me/Off. These can also be activated using the /filter command, and will affect critical hit, critical blast, exceptional heal, and crippling blow messages <br>
- Changed /filter to allow you to toggle the various chat filter settings (still also lets you toggle the badwords filter) <br>
- Changed /channel to allow you to set your default chat channel. It also now saves this setting in the INI file <br>
- Changed the /targetgroupbuff command to be 'persistent'. The state of the switch will be stored in the eqclient.ini file and will be remembered when you log out or zone <br>
- Fixed the double messages received when "Soandso's song ends" <br>
- Mend should be working properly. "Can not use Mend for x seconds" can still appear, but you now should be able to use mend at the appropriate time <br>
- Fixed bug in the client that caused a "You are out of Ammo message" even when you still had ammo <br>
- Messages should no longer be lost while you are zoning <br>
- Corpses that are made to appear at the "safe spot" of a zone for any reason can now be moved using /corpse as long as the person using the command has /consent for that corpse <br>
- Added "AllLuclinPcModelsOff" line to the eqclient.ini file which, if set to TRUE, will skip the loading of all of the Luclin PC models (except the Vah Shir, which always gets loaded no matter what this is set to). This should allow players to set the loading of each race and sex individually for their normal game play, but then quickly turn all models off for a raid or other such circumstances <br>
- Added /rtarget function (can be used as /rt). This function targets the last character to send you a /tell. It follows all of the rules for /target <br>
- Messages sent to you while you are zoning should be saved and sent to you when you reach the other side of the zone. Messages should no longer be lost while zoning (unless zoning takes more than about 10 minutes for any reason) <br>
- You should be able to keep typing whatever you were in the middle of typing when you zoned... but it might not be processed till you're in the new zone <br>
- If someone is on your ignore list and they do a /random, you shouldn't see it anymore <br>
<br>
<br>
** Pathing ** <br>
<br>
- Corrected some pathing in Ak'Anon that was preventing some NPCs from reaching certain areas <br>
- Corrected some pathing issues in Acrylia Caverns <br>
- Corrected a problem with the entrance from Hollowshade Moor into Paludal Caverns that was preventing Beastlord Warders from entering the zone <br>
<br>
<br>
** Miscellaneous ** <br>
<br>
- Many cases where characters would stab themselves with their weapons when sitting should have been eliminated <br>
- Player characters no longer broadcast their location when they are stationary. This should reduce the resources used and improve gameplay <br>
- Fixed a problem that was causing some users to see blocky, unblended terrain where terrain types meet <br>
- Critical hit messages from spells now take into account PvP damage calculations. The actual damage was calculated correctly, it was just displaying wrong on the critical message <br>
- Fixed canoes, they should move forward and backwards normally again <br>
- We have been working to prevent characters from being stuck in the game after link death in such a way that prevents the player from logging back in. Players should be able to log back in no more than 5 minutes after going link dead in all situations <br>
- Added Sharvahl as a "home zone" for Vahshir when taking PvP racial faction hits into account <br>
- We have fixed the ATI flashing problem that some players with certain cards were having when inventory window was up <br>
<br>
<br>

APPENDIX E – Chat Channels <br>
<br>
<br>
EverQuest players can now open or join as many as 10 chat channels above and beyond the pre-created channels. The commands and discussion below only apply to these player-created channels, not to the game-wide channels such as /ooc or /shout. <br>
<br>
<br>
These are a few of the terms used to describe the chat channel functions: <br>
<br>
[] = optional parameters, <> = required parameters <br>
<br>
= [:] <br>
= [,...] <br>
<br>
This means that any place below where it lists you can use the with the password after it (don’t forget the colon between the two), or just the channel name where no password is in use. <br>
And any place it lists you can use a series of separated by commas. <br>
<br>
For example: /chat set Voxraidleader:seekrit, Voxraidgroupleader:notsoseekrit, Voxraidgeneral <br>
That would set three channels (Voxraidleader, Voxraidgroupleader and Voxraidgeneral), two with passwords (seekrit and notsoseekrit). Though we would suggest shorter channel names…  <br>
<br>
<br>
Here is a list of the commands available for using chat channels. After that we'll give a few examples. <br>
<br>
Note: Chat channel names are not case sensitive. You can use all lowercase letters if that makes it easier. The exception is creating channels. When you create a channel it will retain the capitalization you use when that name is displayed. But for any other use in the commands below you can use lowercase letter. <br>
<br>
<br>
Chat System Command List <br>
<br>
/chat set Makes you a member of all of the channels listed. You will be joined to those channels in the order listed (see /join below for details on what 'joining' a channel means). This will remove you from all previously joined channels. If you just want to join a new channel, use the /join command <br>
<br>
/join Allows you to join the channel or channels listed. If the channel does not yet exist it will create the channel and you will be added as a moderator for the channel (see below for moderator commands). Note: You may use spaces when creating a channel. But when the channel is created those spaces will be removed. So if you "/join fluffy bunny" the channel created will be "fluffybunny" <br>
<br>
/leave This will remove you from the channel. Note: You must specify a channel, either by name or by number, or the command will fail <br>
<br>
/leaveall Removes you from all channels <br>
<br>
/list [channel] Using this command without the [channel] parameter will list all of the channels that you are joined to, the channel number, and will give a numeric value for the number of people in that channel. The channel number is specific to individual users, so two people in the same channel may not have the same channel number for that channel. Using the command with a [channel] parameter will list the members of the channel by name <br>
<br>
/announce [on | off] Toggles on and off the announcements heard when people join or leave channels. This is set OFF by default <br>
<br>
/chat # Sends the message to the channel named. You must have the # symbol, that is not a hint to use a number <br>
<br>
/<1..10> Sends the message to the chat channel number listed. You can discover the number of the channels you are joined to by using /list. If no channel number is specified the message will be sent to you first chat channel (whichever is your channel number 1) <br>
<br>
/chat help Displays a list of chat channel commands <br>
<br>
<br>
Channel Moderator Command List <br>
<br>
/chat invite [channel] Sends an invitation to the specified character to join a the chat channel. If no channel is specified the character will be invited to join your first channel (whichever channel is your channel number 1). The invitation arrives as a text message. If the channel is password protected, the invited person can enter the channel only once without a password <br>
<br>
/chat grant [channel] Grants moderator privileges in the channel specified to the character named. If no channel is specified the character will be given moderator privileges to your first channel (whichever channel is your channel number 1) <br>
<br>
/chat password [channel] Sets the password for the channel specified. If no channel is specified the password will be applied to your first channel (whichever channel is your channel number 1). Note: A password protected channel is the only type of channel that is semi-permanent. Such a channel will disappear after it has been empty for 24 hours. All other channels cease to exist once they are empty <br>
<br>
/chat kick [channel] Kicks the character named off of the chat channel listed. If no channel is specified the character will be kicked our of your first channel (whichever channel is your channel number 1) <br>
<br>
/chat moderate [channel] Sets the specified channel to 'moderated' mode. This means that only those given 'voice' in the channel will be able to speak in that channel. If no channel is specified your first channel (whichever channel is your channel number 1) will be set into moderated mode. This is a toggle command, so if you execute this command a second time the channel will return to unmoderated status. <br>
<br>
/chat voice [channel] Give the named character the ability to speak in a moderated channel. If no channel is specified the character will be allowed voice in your first channel (whichever channel is your channel number 1) <br>
<br>
<br>
Note: A password protected channel is the only type of channel that is semi-permanent. Such a channel will disappear after it has been empty for 24 hours. All other channels cease to exist once they are empty <br>
<br>
Note for advanced users: /chat and / can be replaced with a semicolon ( ; ) in most cases. <br>
<br>
Associated commands <br>
<br>
Here are a few commands that you can use to make your chat channels even more friendly. <br>
<br>
/autojoin Saves the channels listed and automatically ;sets you to those channels when you log in. This information is saved in your eqclient.ini file in the [Defaults] section as ChannelAutoJoin=. You can edit that setting in the file while out of game if you wish <br>
<br>
/usecolor See the section in this manual for a description of the use of this command. The following /usercolor numbers have been added to allow greater customization of your chat channels: <br>
<br>
35 - Chat Channel Messages <br>
36 - Chat Channel 1 <br>
37 - Chat Channel 2 <br>
38 - Chat Channel 3 <br>
39 - Chat Channel 4 <br>
40 - Chat Channel 5 <br>
41 - Chat Channel 6 <br>
42 - Chat Channel 7 <br>
43 - Chat Channel 8 <br>
44 - Chat Channel 9 <br>
45 - Chat Channel 10 <br>
<br>
<br>
APPENDIX F - HITS MODE – Combat Text Display Options <br>
<br>
/hitsmode allows you to create separate windows for your combat text. This is a rather advanced feature, so it might take a little practice to get the results that you want. <br>
<br>
Here is the technical jargon: <br>
<br>
Usage: /hitsmode <br>
<br>
my = My Attacks, me = Me Getting Hit, other = Others Attacks <br>
<br>
If you choose M2 through M5, then: <br>
and are the screen location. <br>
is how many lines of text will be displayed. The acceptable range is 1 to 10 <br>
is a font size of the text. The acceptable range is 0, 1, or 2. <br>
is either on or off. 1 to turn on and 0 to turn it off. <br>
controls the background. It is either on or off. 1 to turn it on or 0 to turn it off. <br>
is the width of the background. <br>
<br>
note: m5 is only valid for My Attacks. It's ignored for other types and m4 is used instead. <br>
<br>
off - nothing displayed <br>
on - displayed as normal in the chat window <br>
M2 - displayed at a given X,Y position for a given number of lines in a given font size. <br>
M3 - displayed in condensed form at a given X,Y position for a given number of lines in a given font size. <br>
M4 - displayed as just the damage # at a given X,Y position for a given number of lines in a given font size. <br>
<br>
/clearhits will clear the current setting for the M2-M5 modes of the /hitsmode command.<br>
<br>

<br>
I WAS able to get on for about 30 minutes and play around with the chat channels and /hitsmode<br>
<br>
chat channels will be fantastic, although, you will have to manullly keep track of what channel you are speaking in, but they dont seem too difficult to manage<br>
<br>
/hitsmode is awesome.  Dont expect to like it right away though.  It will definietly take a few days, maybe even weeks to get everything set up in a way that works for you.  As a dual-wielding, double attacking, riposting, epic hasted ranger, I can say that this is the best change to the game since the new UI that came with Velious. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=8660" target="_new"><IMG SRC="http://www.usefulware.com/graphics/lines/sigalone.jpg"></A><br><b>Warder of Karana</b><br>
