<br>
* * * * * *<br>
<br>
Soft sunlight streamed down and through the whispering pines of the woodland as birds called to each other and grubbed in the fertile soil for their daily feast of bugs and worms. the day was warm, and the shade beneath the large spreading branches of the trees was cool and comforting, the very earth seeming to impart a sense of peace and serenity. though a breeze stirred the upper reaches of the trees, it was only faintly audible from the ground, as if a lute was being played softly across a sunlit glade. the constant hum and buzz of the insects rose from the tall grasses of the glade. Yet deeper in the forest, away from the prying eyes of most men lay the grand wizard spires of Greater Faydark. they stood there, moss covered and cold, even as the sunlight slashed down it’s heated rays and bathed the rune covered monolith with it’s golden rays. the spires pulsed once with a soft nimbus of blue energy and suddenly 3 figures appeared from out of the ether, brushing the already melting snow that had accumulated on their clothes.<br>
<br>
“Welcome to Greater Faydark…” said Zalbar almost casually sitting on the soft loam to regain his energies,”Was that actually Mithaniel Marr himself?”<br>
<br>
“Not so much the god himself, but rather his spirit.” replied Spioctor reverantly,” It is not unheard of for Mithaniel Marr to do such things, but it is no common occurrence. Be assured of that.”<br>
<br>
“I believe it is a good omen of things to come. Surely our cause is just and we cannot but prevail with the blessings of Marr himself!” said Argonious with a fervent gleam in his eyes.<br>
<br>
“ this gives us much to…arrrgh..”<br>
<br>
Zalbar’s statement was cut short as he grasped his wrist and doubled over in pain falling prone onto the ground. His breathe came in ragged gasps as he got to his hands and knees and then stood leaning heavily on his staff. Sweat streamed down his brow and his reddish locks lay damply against his forehead. the timberland had grown quiet and even the insects no longer sang their summer song. the glade was suddenly darkened as clouds covered the sun and a biting wind blew in from the west, chilling the trio to their bones. the air was heavy with the smell of rain and lightning arced back and forth within the clouds overhead<br>
<br>
Spioctor and Argonious rushed to Zalbar’s side to support him and then chanted quick prayers to Marr to heal their injured leader. Blue motes of holy energy surrounded Zalbar but quickly died, as if smothered by some otherworldly force.<br>
<br>
“ What foulness is this?” Argonious asked looking around furtively. “My spells have no effect.”<br>
<br>
“Neither do mine, what is it Zalbar? tell us, what thwarts us.” said Spioctor more calmly “ there is something not quite right here. Even the beasts of the forest have stilled.”<br>
<br>
“ I cannot…I must…” started Zalbar then shrugged off the paladins holding his arms. As his arms came free, the sleeves of his robes came up and Spioctor and Argonious both stared in shock at the runes burnt into the flesh of Zalbar’s arm. the flesh was curled black and charred around the edges, and the sickly sweet odour of burnt flesh assailed their nostrils. the red layers of skin underneath began to bleed and fell to the earth leaving a dark stain on the ground.<br>
<br>
“How…” they both stammered, then fell silent as Zalbar stepped back away from him.<br>
<br>
“I fear this day we have lost more then one brave paladin of the Blood tide. I had hoped that such a thing would never happen, but it seems I was mistaken. I must leave now. Fare thee well. take the path over yonder and it shall lead you to the high-elves of Felwithe. Abide there five days against my return and should I not appear by weeks end. then I am no more.” said Zalbar resignedly “ though I do not wish this burden upon anyone, should it come to pass that I have failed, then you must take my place Lord Quijano.”<br>
<br>
Spioctor’s eyes widened in horrified shock at the implication of Zalbar’s words. His mouth opened and then shut without speaking. then he nodded once, mute acceptance clearly visible on his face.<br>
<br>
“I understand and will do my best to honor you should it come to pass that you have fallen” said Spioctor<br>
<br>
“Can we not accompany you?” asked Argonious already seeing the answer in Zalbar’s eyes.<br>
<br>
“ Where I go, you would pose more of a threat to me than if I went alone paladin of Marr. Go now and abide against my return. Pray that our reunion will be a better day than this.” finished Zalbar clapping his hands together and disappearing slowly from view.<br>
<br>
Spioctor and Argonious looked at each other then silently gathered up their packs, walking slowly along the indicated trail. the sun had emerged from behind the dark scowling clouds and once again lit the forest with it’s warming rays. the wildlife once again moved and rustled in the underbrush and the birds took up their interrupted chorus. Life was at peace once again in the Greater Faydark, but the memory of that dark cloud hung heavily on the thoughts of at least two people travelling the wilds of the woods.<br>
<br>
<br>
* * * * * *<br>
<br>
It was dark and cold. No light lit the caverns, and the rock was clammy and seemed to emanate a putrescence and sense of foreboding. Somewhere water was dripping. the echoes reverbating and thrumming in a steady rhythm as they fell into a pool of water that had been collecting for untold ages. though unlit, Zalbar walked calmly along the stone passages winding back and forth beneath the mountain. His eyes glowed a deep purple, and seemed to almost penetrate the very rock as he strode puposefully deeper and deeper into the underdark. though he stopped frequently to listen to his surrounding, he still kept navigating his way under the oppressive weight of hundreds of thousands of tons of rock above him.<br>
<br>
Rounding a bend, he pulled back quickly and then peered around the corner before taking a few steps back. there, guarding a bridge that spanned a chasm, so deep that a torch dropped off it’s edge would burn itself out before hitting the bottom, were two teir’dal Dragoons. their arms glittered in the ultraviolet spectrum, and their backs were ramrod straight as they maintained their post. Halberds, the edges honed to a razor were held loosely but puposefully in their dark hands.<br>
<br>
He reached into his pack and rummaged around till he found what he was looking for. A small leathery mask, was held in his hands. It tingled with magical energy and he slipped it familiarly over his face. It glimmered for a few moments and then his features changed. His broad shoulders, and muscled chest seeming to shrink, his skin darkened and his ears grew pointed. Reddish hair turned white and straight, and his form had shrunk down a foot. to all eyes he was now a teir’dal. More than that, a teir’dal wizard of high station wearing the robes of a Channeler of Neriak.<br>
<br>
He strode boldly around the turn head held high and marched purposefully up to the guards and past them. However, before he could cross between them, twin halberds crossed in front of his face and the one on the right spoke.<br>
<br>
“Va’r k’un tah duh norgh sin’cha!” said the stern faced guard wanting know what Zalbar’s business was in this most sacred of places.<br>
<br>
“Ved, cha t’or sta!” said Zalbar furiously demanding that they remove their weapons barring his passage.<br>
<br>
“Yal t’or ka sahii Dragoon!” the guard replied stating that he was not under the authority of the wizards of Neriak.<br>
<br>
“t’il da soo dan Innoruk tol dan chu.” Said Zalbar explaining the summons he had received from the servant of Innoruk<br>
<br>
the two sentries looked nervously one to the other and then slowly raised their halberds and let pass the disguised wizard, a small smile playing on his lips. He had obviously enjoyed their discomfort and they returned to their posts with one last icy glare at the back of the purple robed wizard making his way across the stone causeway.<br>
<br>
Zalbar crossed the narrow rock bridge and then entered another warren of tunnels that seemed to twist here and there without purpose, but he took the turn and spiraling path in stride and moved through into the deepest caverns without pause. He winced occassionally and clenched his right fist in an attempt to control the pain. He was near. His blood sung, and roared in his ears, and then he was there. A grand arch, surmounted by the skull of some long forgotten demon, huge and foul beyond imagining. He stepped quickly through the arched gateway and moved forward to the small carved niche in the rear of the cave. It was charred black, and small flesh-hooks adorned the far wall, their tips still covered with gobbets of flesh and charred organs, creating an eerily grotesque curtain. the place smelt of a charnel house, and a small tunnel led off the back into the darkness. A pentacle was inscribed on the floor in blood, black candles lit at the points, and she sat there in the center. Her head was bowed, and her breathing shallow. In front of her outside the circle of protection was a silver amulet, cracked in half, the edges charred and blacked. It was her blood oath. the mystical amulet that all Blood tide wore, and contained, for lack of a better word, their essence of the bond that tied one to the other. this then was what had caused him so much pain, and the wound in his arm throbbed once again as blood trickled down to his fingertips, and then fell in a steady pattern on the cracked rock floor of the alcove.<br>
<br>
<br>
“Naldainie…”whispered Zalbar ignoring his lifesblood spilling out of him “Why?”<br>
<br>
She looked up at him then, her violet eyes searching his face for a hint of emotion, and then stood up and spoke softly to him. “Dearheart, the time has come for me to leave this place and the Blood tide. I knew you would come once the ritual had been completed and the ties severed. things are no longer what they seemed. Once I had such grand thoughts, but I now realize what foolish illusions they were. People have changed, and time moves on. I had to do this. If only to save myself. I cannot be bound to this anymore. I still cherish the memories I have Made with many of you, but for now I must go and follow my own path.” She said simply, once again bowing her head.<br>
<br>
Zalbar took in her form, marvelling at the quiet beauty that she seemed so unaware of, and stored them away, perhaps forever. His eyes beheld hers, and his mouth opened but words could not pass his lips. Almost unconsciously he reached out to her, but stopped at the sight of his blood dripping to the cavern floor. the bond had truly been broken. His blood was a testament to that.<br>
<br>
“I thought…that is…I…farewell Naldainie…you will be missed, and most certainly not forgotten.” He managed to say at last turning away from her, his shoulders slumping and a cold bundle of iron tying his innards in a knot.<br>
<br>
“One day perhaps our paths will cross again, and I shall rejoin the tide. But this is as it must be for now. this pains me as much as it does you.” She said again. Her arm reached out and squeezed his shoulder once, a single solitary tear, sparkling and glittering in the candlelight, rolled down her cheek to splash amongst the blood that Zalbar had spilt upon the floor. then she was gone down the passage into the darkness.<br>
<br>
Zalbar turned to look at her disappearing form and he sighed to himself, so many questions running circles in his mind. If only he had seen this coming. Perhaps a word here, and act there might have prevented this catastrophe. So many what ifs roiling in his thoughts. It was then that the reality of the situation came crashing down about him, as his heart and mind opened up to the fact that she was really gone. then Zalbar, the courageous leader, slayer of the red dragon Nagafen, the ice cold dispassionate ruler of the Blood tide sank slowly to his knees and wept unashamedly like a lost and lonely child, the two pieces of the amulet held in his bloody hands as he cried out into the darkness for an answer that would not come…<br>
