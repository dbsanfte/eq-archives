      <font color="#FF0033"><b>The Guide Program</b></font> </font> 
      <p><b>What is the Guide Program?</b></p>
      <p>Ozymandius started the Guide Program during early beta; its staff composed 
        of volunteers who wanted to contribute to the game in a larger sense. 
        Since its creation, the Guide program has grown at a tremendous rate, 
        and has worked closely with Verant Interactive to see to it that the players 
        have a unified and dedicated group of people who exist only to help them 
        and make their gameplay experience rewarding. Today, the Guide program 
        consists of hundreds of volunteer Guides, 1-3 Senior Guides per server, 
        each responsible for all Guide operations on that server, and a team of 
        Elder Guides responsible for overall program operations.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>How do I become a Guide?</b></p>
      <p>Players interested in volunteering at least 10 hours per week for the 
        Guide program may apply at <a href="http://guideapp.989studios.com" target="_blank">http://guideapp.989studios.com</a>.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>What can a Guide do for me?</b></p>
      <p>Guides in EverQuest are given a wide range of powers in order to provide 
        players with as much help as possible. Some of the most frequent services 
        we provide are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Corpse recovery when the player has died due to a verifiable bug.</li>
        <li>Processing information for leg-up kits (reimbursals) for those who 
          have lost corpses.</li>
        <li>Rescues at sea for boating (bug) accidents.</li>
        <li>Assistance in keeping the player free from unwanted harassment.</li>
        <li>Assistance in reporting bugs found in the game.</li>
        <li>Assistance in providing feedback for new game functions or modifications 
          to existing function.</li>
        <li>Reporting and documenting cases of exploitation and abuse and issuing 
          the required warnings in order to keep EverQuest &quot;cheat free&quot;.</li>
        <li>Assistance in corpse recovery when a player cannot see their corpse.</li>
        <li>Unsticking players who are lodged in the geography.</li>
        <li>Coordination of problems found in the game with the highest priority/most 
          frequent ones being hot-listed nightly for Verant.</li>
        <li>Answering frequently asked technical questions and solving technical 
          problems.</li>
        <li>Creating and running dynamic quests in the game. <font color="#0000CC"><b>MORE!</b></font></li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>What can a Guide not do for me?</b></p>
      <p>Guides follow an extensive set of procedures that detail what they can 
        and cannot do when helping players in the game. We created these procedures 
        by trying to imagine every possible player request, then removing the 
        ones that would cause exploits or favoritism. It is the goal of the Guide 
        program to help a player with any possible situation as long as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <p>It does not involve giving &quot;spoiler&quot; information, such 
            as detailed directions, quest information, or information on creatures, 
            armor and weapons. Knowledge of these subjects is considered part 
            of the &quot;mystery&quot; of the game. It is part of the game to 
            adventure and learn the wonders of the world of Norrath.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>It does not create an exploitable situation. Examples of this would 
            be switching a player to non-PvP. A player could engage in PvP activities, 
            then request to be switched back before any counter actions could 
            be taken against him. Guides have no way of knowing the circumstances 
            surrounding a player's PvP activities and therefore are not allowed 
            to change the PvP flag. Another example of this might be retrieving 
            corpses that are not due to a verifiable bug. If a player petitions 
            that they went linkdead and died, we have no way to verify this, and 
            cannot do a corpse recovery. Players simply &quot;pulling the plug&quot; 
            whenever they get in over their heads in a battle, then asking for 
            assistance with recovery could easily abuse this.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>It would not constitute favoritism or compete with activities conducted 
            by players in the game. For example, Guides will not bind players 
            to a location, except in the case where there is a bug in that player's 
            binding point. We cannot do this upon request for every player in 
            the game, so it is unfair to do it for a few. This would also compete 
            with players who are selling binding as a service.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>How do I contact a Guide?</b></p>
      <p> A player can see which GMs and Guides are online at any given time by 
        typing <b>/who gm all</b>.</p>
      <p>GMs and Guides may be contacted by the use of the <b>/petition</b> command. 
        Guides are instructed to not answer <b>/tell</b>, <b>/ooc</b>, or <b>/shout</b>. 
        This is not to disregard a player, but instead to assist those players 
        who are currently in queue, and waiting for a Guide. Petitions are answered 
        in the order in which they were submitted. <font color="#0000CC">Think 
        about this part a moment. If your a member of a large Guild you can get 
        a taste for what this must be like with /Guildsay and a Guide or GM must 
        be like a Guildmaster of all the people online. Frankly I dont see how 
        they can even remember who we are or what we say with all the tells they 
        must get. Also who among us have not typed in a long paragraph to someone 
        with a long nad difficult name only to use /reply and have it go to someone 
        who just interrupted?</font></p>
      <p>The petition queue was designed to provide a direct avenue to speak with 
        an EverQuest Guide or GM. It acts as an information gatherer and can be 
        accessed by all Guides and GMs to handle customer issues, complaints, 
        bugs, or feedback. The petition queue is the Guides' most versatile tool 
        in assisting the player, and is one of the program's most highly regarded 
        features. It is the desire of the Guide Program to answer every petition, 
        no matter how trivial, even if the answer is "I'm sorry, but we're not 
        able to do that." All customers are important and all need to know we 
        care and listen to them. As a player, it helps to understand how the queue 
        works, and how to best resolve your questions, comments, and issues. </p>

      <b>Guide Procedures for Common Game Situations</b></font></font> 
      <p>The Guide program strives to keep the game free of bugs, exploitation, 
        abuse, and harassment. With large numbers of people online, such problems 
        arise now and again, and the Guides intervene when necessary. The following 
        information is provided to help a player use the tools given to them to 
        handle most situations, and to help them decide what do when those tools 
        are not enough.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>What is the naming policy?</b></p>
      <p>Character names in EverQuest should reflect the genre of the game. Original, 
        high-fantasy names are desired. The following types of names are unacceptable 
        and are listed in order from the worst to the least offensive:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> 
          <p>Vile, rude and obscene names including common swear words, anatomical 
            references and deliberate misspellings and homonyms of these words. 
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>A combination of words that produce an offensive result (Hugeaz, 
            TugMcgroin). 
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>Religious names that other players find offensive (Jesus, Allah).

      <p><b>What is an exploit?</b></p>
      <p>Exploitation is defined as abusing a weakness or anomaly in the game 
        system. An exploit provides advantage for one or more players with the 
        <b>intention of profiting </b>from them in some manner. </p>
      <p>Examples of Exploitation: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Duping –</i> creation of money or items from nothing, or anomalies 
          within the game.</li>
        <li><i>Farming –</i> using broken spells or specific spell effects to 
          kill, drag, or lure monsters, thus gaining experience/loot from them.</li>
        <li><i>Safe Zones –</i> using areas of bad data in the game that have 
          monsters behaving erratically (such as running in place, running around, 
          standing still, or any other behavior that has the monster not defending 
          itself) to kill said monsters with minimal or no danger to the attacker.</li>
        <li><i>Price Gouging –</i> finding items that have anomalous pricing and 
          abusing them, such as items that sell for more than they cost to buy.</li>
        <li><i>PvP Switch Avoidance –</i> using in-game methods to work around 
          the PvP switch and allowing non-PvP players to kill other players, such 
          as hall blocking, dumping of monsters, or spell effects that cross that 
          boundary due to a bug. <font color="#0000CC">Think this should be under 
          abuse instead?</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>What is considered abuse?</b></p>
      <p>Abuse is defined as any activity that is exercised with the intent of 
        disrupting the over all play environment of one or more players. 
      <p>Examples of Abuse: 
      <ul>
        <li><i>Hate Mongering –</i> participation in or propagation of Hate literature, 
          behavior, or propaganda related to real-world characteristics.</li>
        <li><i>Sexual Harassment –</i> untoward and unwelcome advances of a graphic 
          and sexual nature. </li>
        <li><i>Attempting to Defraud a Customer Service Representative</i> - Petitioning 
          with false information with the intention of receiving benefits as a 
          result. This includes reporting bug deaths, experience or item loss, 
          or accusing other players of wrongdoing without basis for it.</li>
        <li><i>Using Threats of Retribution by GM Friends</i> – attempting to 
          convince another player that they have no recourse in a disagreement 
          because favoritism is shown to one of the parties by the Verant or Guide 
          staff.</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>What is considered Disruption?</b></p>
      <p>Disruption is defined as any activity that is disruptive to the game 
        play of others, though not necessarily with the intent to do so. Disruption 
        has been sub-categorized into major and minor types.</p>
      <p>Examples of Minor Disruption: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Non-Fantasy/Offensive Names –</i> Names that are not appropriate 
          for the fantasy genre of EverQuest (See Naming Policy).</li>
        <li><i>Excessive Spam –</i> Continued overuse of <b>/ooc</b>, <b>/shout</b>, 
          or <b>/auction</b> over time such that many players complain. <font color="#0000CC"><b>YAY!</b></font></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Examples of Major Disruption:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Foul Language</i> – excessive use of foul language in an inappropriate 
          context, including swear words, real–world racial slurs, and other language 
          that is not consistent with the fantasy environment and designed to 
          hurt.</li>
        <li><i>Stalking/Harassment –</i> following a player around after that 
          player has asked to be left alone, continually vulching and kill stealing 
          from the same person, and in general focusing unwelcome attention upon 
          another player over time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>What is the Guide program's procedure for handling exploits and abuse?</b></p>
      <p>When a player is accused of abuse, exploitation or disruption, the process 
        is as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Guides gather all of the information on ALL parties involved. They 
          get the character name, race, level, and account name of both the accusers 
          and the accused, as well as the zone and situation and document it. 
        </li>
        <li>Guides act only as investigators and reporters in incidents of abuse, 
          exploitation, and disruption. We gather data, issue warnings, and record 
          the incident. </li>
        <li>Verant reviews records of these incidents on a daily basis. Verant 
          GM's will then take discipinary action based on the severity and nature 
          of the offense, and/or the number of warnings, subject to their discretion. 
          This may include but is not limited to, temporary suspension or permanent 
          banning from the game. Disciplinary action may also include editing 
          of the character statistics, item inventory, or experience. Verant may 
          take other forms of disciplinary action at their discretion. Be advised 
          you may not receive any warnings prior to disciplinary action being 
          taken. Players who repeatedly exploit anomalies in the game or disrupt 
          the gameplay of others will not be tolerated in EverQuest. </li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>How can I handle verbal harassment by another player?</b> 
      <p>The best course of action is to immediately use the <b>/ignore &quot;playername&quot;</b> 
        command. It is a player's most powerful tool in these instances. If the 
        harassment continues in another form, (the person follows you throughout 
        the game attempting to injure or annoy you), <b>/petition</b> your incident 
        immediately.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>What is considered a verified bug death?</b></p>
      <p>A Guide has several tools at their disposal to verify bug deaths, researching 
        each incident on a case by case basis. </p>
      <p>Some examples of causes of death that are considered verifiable bug deaths:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Falling through the world for massive damage (corpse is found 10,000 
          feet below the world).</li>
        <li>Becoming trapped in a bugged patch of water, such that the character 
          is unable to leave and drowns.</li>
        <li>Being crushed by a ship.</li>
        <li>Falling off a boat while zoning, drowning, and leaving a corpse is 
          at the bottom of the sea.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In each of these cases, a Guide is able to determine if the death is 
        legitimate through use of their tools and the data collected. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>Can the Guides help me if I have a verified bug death?</b></p>
      <p>If the cause of death was a verifiable bug, the Guides can and will assist 
        you in recovering your corpse. Should your corpse be unrecoverable, the 
        Guides will gather the necessary information for a Verant GM to provide 
        you with a <b>leg-up kit</b> reimbursal, which is designed to help you 
        continue playing the game without having to re-equip your character from 
        scratch. </p>
      <p>This is a courtesy service provided by the Guide Program in an attempt 
        to compensate for the loss of experience and inconvenience caused by the 
        character dying to an anomaly in the game. Attempting to defraud a Guide 
        by filing false claims will be handled as a case of abuse, and reported 
        as such. </p>
      <p>&quot;Linkdeath&quot; is caused by client or network issues that will 
        exist well after release and can not be compensated for by programming. 
        &quot;Linkdeath&quot; can never be proven and can actually be used by 
        players to purposely avoid dire consequences of their actions in the game. 
        Consequently, dying while &quot;linkdead&quot; is not considered to be 
        death by a bug, with the one current exception of players going linkdead 
        on boats and drowning in the ocean. <font color="#0000CC">I keep telling 
        ya get a Druid or Wizard for your best bud!</font></p>

      Common Gameplay Questions</font></b></font> 
      <p><b>What is the proper use of the <i>/ooc</i>, <i>/auction</i>, and <i>/shout</i> 
        channels?</b></p>
      <p>These channels are provided as a courtesy for players to communicate 
        with one another in specific methods. The <b>/shout</b> command is for 
        players to use in-game character speech. This is used for role-playing, 
        asking for help or directions etc. The <b>/ooc</b> channel is specifically 
        for Out-Of-Character speech only. Tech questions, game issues, and other 
        such non-roleplaying questions are commonly used in this channel. The 
        <b>/auction</b> channel is for the buying and selling of goods and services, 
        and can be in character or not. It is important to remember that these 
        channels are a courtesy for players, extended conversation need to go 
        into <b>/tell</b>. Players who continue conversations far and beyond this, 
        are considered to be &quot;spamming, or flooding&quot; these channels 
        and are reminded they are under the same rules and regulations in game 
        as they are when in EverQuest's chat rooms. Players should not have to 
        turn off their <b>/ooc</b>, <b>/shout</b>, or <b>/auction</b> channels 
        because some players cannot follow or respect policy and other players.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>What if I can't see my corpse?</b></p>
      <p>Corpses are sometimes &quot;invisible&quot; after a death. A player may 
        ask a bard or necromancer to verify that indeed their corpse is invisible, 
        (the bard or necromancer can see it, but the player cannot), as sometimes 
        where a player &quot;thinks&quot; they died, is not where they actually 
        are. This is especially common in larger zones like Greater Faydark. Once 
        a player has verified their corpse is indeed invisible to them, usually 
        a quick log out and log in corrects the problem, if it does not, give 
        the Guides a <b>/petition</b> and they will come to assist. <font color="#0000CC">This 
        seems to happen more often in zoning situations as well in my experiance. 
        You know where you tried to zone or gate and thought you just might have 
        made it but died afterall?</font></p>

      <p><b>What is &quot;linkdeath&quot; and what happens when a player goes 
        &quot;linkdead&quot;?</b></p>
      <p>&quot;Linkdeath&quot; is defined as a player who loses their connection 
        to EverQuest, usually from their ISP going down, or Internet congestion 
        has caused that player to &quot;lag out&quot;. When a player goes &quot;linkdead&quot;, 
        he or she in essence basically becomes an NPC for all intents and purposes, 
        this gives control over to the server, and the PC will attempt to defend 
        itself like an NPC should a monster attack it or choose to harm it. The 
        &quot;linkdead&quot; character remains in game approximately 30 seconds 
        to a minute and then is logged off automatically by the server or given 
        over to the player should they log before then.</p>
