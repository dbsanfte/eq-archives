Welcome to the only place to get your info on Shadowknights.  I've
searched the net many times to find information about Shadowknights
to no avail.
</br></br>
Also iam looking for a few good people ;D to help with content for
the Shadowknight. This sight is made for you guys/gals out there that
share the same ideals I carry in my Troll brain.
</br></br>
Furthermore any SK is welcome Ogre, Troll, Dark Elf or Human. Just email me the
info to me and I will place it up with your name attached to the bottom.
</br></br>
Tanks! Grub gub...
