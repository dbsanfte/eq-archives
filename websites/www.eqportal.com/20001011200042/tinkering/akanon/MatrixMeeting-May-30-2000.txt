[Tue May 30 23:41:48 2000] Fulcrum pauses.
[Tue May 30 23:41:52 2000] Aleistor taps his chin with his quill.
[Tue May 30 23:41:53 2000] Kilkin says, in Gnomish, 'I like it'
[Tue May 30 23:42:11 2000] Aleistor says, in Gnomish, 'Wouldent this conflict with the main council?'
[Tue May 30 23:42:16 2000] Kilkin says, in Gnomish, 'As long as you understood what we discussed in the forum'
[Tue May 30 23:42:18 2000] Alet is looking at your equipment...
[Tue May 30 23:42:19 2000] Nizzle says, in Gnomish, 'I see no problems with it.'
[Tue May 30 23:42:28 2000] Alet says, 'Hail'

[Tue May 30 23:43:06 2000] Kilkin says, in Gnomish, 'I dont see how it conflicts'
[Tue May 30 23:43:06 2000] You say, 'Yes, you would have to have read'
[Tue May 30 23:43:14 2000] You say, 'the forum to perhaps understand what we meant'
[Tue May 30 23:43:21 2000] You say, 'The proposal is that'
[Tue May 30 23:43:41 2000] You say, 'there would be a number of committees that would look into various matters of Gnomish improtance'
[Tue May 30 23:43:50 2000] You say, 'ooc:'
[Tue May 30 23:44:03 2000] Aleistor frowns slightly.
[Tue May 30 23:44:05 2000] You say, 'A way to draw in those that do not wish to have a mojor role, but wish to be involved.  end'
[Tue May 30 23:44:19 2000] Fulcrum saved.
[Tue May 30 23:44:20 2000] Nizzle nods.
[Tue May 30 23:44:25 2000] Aleistor nods slightly.
[Tue May 30 23:44:30 2000] Aleistor says, in Gnomish, 'Forgive my ignorance.'
[Tue May 30 23:44:30 2000] You say, 'Please Aleistor, what are your thoughts?'
[Tue May 30 23:44:34 2000] Kilkin says, in Gnomish, 'The forum explains it well'
[Tue May 30 23:45:09 2000] Aleistor says, in Gnomish, 'I was just thinking that with smaller groups handeling everything . That the main council could easily become obsolete .'
[Tue May 30 23:45:17 2000] You say, 'Ahhh'
[Tue May 30 23:45:23 2000] Meraxes smiles.
[Tue May 30 23:45:26 2000] You say, 'These smaller committees'
[Tue May 30 23:45:34 2000] Nizzle thinks this is a small group,.
[Tue May 30 23:45:35 2000] You say, 'do not actually have an official voice'
[Tue May 30 23:45:43 2000] Kilkin says, in Gnomish, 'No those small committees are just for small items of interest .'
[Tue May 30 23:45:46 2000] You say, 'but rather they are a RP medium'
[Tue May 30 23:45:53 2000] Nizzle agrees with Fulcrum.

[Tue May 30 23:46:20 2000] You say, 'Yes'
[Tue May 30 23:46:25 2000] Aleistor laughs.
[Tue May 30 23:46:25 2000] Meraxes is still trying to figure that one out.
[Tue May 30 23:46:30 2000] Kilkin says, in Gnomish, 'Hah'
[Tue May 30 23:46:43 2000] Aleistor says, in Gnomish, 'How ogres can actually mate .'
[Tue May 30 23:46:46 2000] Aleistor shivers.

[Tue May 30 23:46:54 2000] You say, 'Great.  So shall we move onto Rights then?  Or are there any more responsibilities?'
[Tue May 30 23:46:58 2000] Kilkin says, in Gnomish, 'Wait'

[Tue May 30 23:48:10 2000] Kilkin says, in Gnomish, 'Inorder to foster and incourage the Tinkering growth of all Gnomes'
[Tue May 30 23:48:18 2000] Nizzle raises an eyebrow.
[Tue May 30 23:48:23 2000] Nizzle says, in Gnomish, 'I like it.'
[Tue May 30 23:48:30 2000] Kilkin says, in Gnomish, 'Meaning .'
[Tue May 30 23:48:34 2000] Aleistor says, in Gnomish, 'A sort of Trade Innovention clause.'
[Tue May 30 23:48:46 2000] You say, 'Yes, a good idea'
[Tue May 30 23:48:47 2000] Nizzle agrees with Aleistor.
[Tue May 30 23:48:56 2000] Kilkin says, in Gnomish, 'Our duty to lets others know about tinkering and to involve others in tinkering in general'
[Tue May 30 23:49:20 2000] Aleistor thinks that would be easily taxed...
[Tue May 30 23:49:24 2000] Kilkin says, in Gnomish, 'And makes it a more gnomish mandate since we mention tinkerin )'
[Tue May 30 23:49:24 2000] Aleistor grins evilly.
[Tue May 30 23:49:32 2000] You say, 'If I may offer a tangent here....'
[Tue May 30 23:49:38 2000] Kilkin says, in Gnomish, 'Please do'
[Tue May 30 23:49:55 2000] You say, 'It would be good for the items that us day-to-day Gnomes Tinker, I agree.....'
[Tue May 30 23:50:11 2000] Aleistor says out of character, 'Enchanter quest .'
[Tue May 30 23:50:28 2000] You say, 'But perhaps we should understand that there are technologies within the Kingdom that we cannot let others have or know about.'
[Tue May 30 23:50:36 2000] You say, 'The reason for the'
[Tue May 30 23:50:45 2000] You say, 'extermination of the rogue clockworks, for example'
[Tue May 30 23:50:53 2000] Nizzle nods in agreement.
[Tue May 30 23:50:54 2000] You say, 'Thoughts?'
[Tue May 30 23:51:03 2000] Kilkin says, in Gnomish, 'Well no i agree, but its just a statement to ourselves that we will foster the growth of Tinkering in general'
[Tue May 30 23:51:09 2000] Aleistor says, in Gnomish, '. .'
[Tue May 30 23:51:31 2000] You say, 'I would agree fostering it completely internally, but some restrictions externally'
[Tue May 30 23:51:35 2000] Aleistor excuses himself for a moment.
[Tue May 30 23:51:37 2000] You say, 'But perhapos this is too specific'
[Tue May 30 23:51:44 2000] Aleistor begins to cast a spell.
[Tue May 30 23:51:45 2000] Kilkin says, in Gnomish, 'Ok i understand'
[Tue May 30 23:51:52 2000] Aleistor begins to cast a spell.
[Tue May 30 23:51:56 2000] Kilkin says, in Gnomish, 'We can remove the throughout the known world part perhaps'
[Tue May 30 23:52:02 2000] Aleistor begins to cast a spell.
[Tue May 30 23:52:10 2000] Aleistor begins to cast a spell.
[Tue May 30 23:52:11 2000] Kilkin says, in Gnomish, 'And the advertizement part'
[Tue May 30 23:52:15 2000] Meraxes says, in Gnomish, 'Tell aleistor food?'
[Tue May 30 23:52:19 2000] Aleistor's spell fizzles!
[Tue May 30 23:52:20 2000] Aleistor begins to cast a spell.
[Tue May 30 23:52:29 2000] You say, 'Perhaps the items that may be given out to the masses must be sanctioned?'
[Tue May 30 23:52:47 2000] Aleistor says, in Gnomish, 'Agreed upon by the council .'
[Tue May 30 23:52:56 2000] Kilkin says, in Gnomish, 'I just think we need to mention tinkering in there somewhere in general or spacific'
[Tue May 30 23:53:00 2000] You say, 'Well, again perhaps this could be left for the actual government to figure out'
[Tue May 30 23:53:08 2000] You say, 'Yes, I agree with you completely Kilkin'
[Tue May 30 23:53:11 2000] Nizzle says, in Gnomish, 'I agree.'
[Tue May 30 23:53:22 2000] Aleistor says, in Gnomish, 'It is our forte.'
[Tue May 30 23:53:30 2000] You say, 'For the moment, we will leave in your thought Kilkin, agreed?'
[Tue May 30 23:53:30 2000] Kilkin says, in Gnomish, 'Waht are gnomes without being known for tinkering'
[Tue May 30 23:53:53 2000] Aleistor wishes someone would come up with the mechanical quill...
[Tue May 30 23:54:21 2000] Fulcrum pauses.
[Tue May 30 23:54:27 2000] You say, 'Onto Rights then?'
[Tue May 30 23:54:29 2000] Fulcrum saved.
[Tue May 30 23:54:31 2000] Nizzle nods.

[Tue May 30 23:55:42 2000] Bick beams a smile at Fulcrum.
[Tue May 30 23:55:42 2000] Meraxes bonks Kilkin on the head!
[Tue May 30 23:55:45 2000] You say, 'Does everyone understand what is behind this?'
[Tue May 30 23:55:45 2000] Aleistor says, in Gnomish, 'Aww.'
[Tue May 30 23:55:53 2000] You say, 'While in session,'
[Tue May 30 23:56:06 2000] You say, 'you may speak your mind, without fear of punishment'
[Tue May 30 23:56:24 2000] You say, 'But out of session, we are normal citizens'

[Wed May 31 00:07:23 2000] Kilkin says, in Gnomish, 'That needs to be discussed perhaps more indepth'
[Wed May 31 00:07:29 2000] You say, 'then that says something about us'

[Wed May 31 00:16:09 2000] Meraxes says, in Gnomish, 'Is the concern based upon division of Responsibility? or Quantity of Gnomes?'
[Wed May 31 00:16:34 2000] Kilkin says, in Gnomish, 'Prime, proximate and protectorate are equal in responsibility, is taht right?'
[Wed May 31 00:16:48 2000] You say, 'Well, that is debateable'

[Wed May 31 00:17:57 2000] Meraxes says, in Gnomish, 'Point: Does joining in simply mean they have to be part of the government?'
[Wed May 31 00:18:09 2000] You say, 'Should these members have an equal say in the direction of government (a real question here to everyone)'

[Wed May 31 00:21:00 2000] Nizzle says, in Gnomish, 'We start with the prime Maxtrix'
[Wed May 31 00:21:18 2000] Nizzle says, in Gnomish, '. we get that and the government formed .'
[Wed May 31 00:21:38 2000] Nizzle says, in Gnomish, '. from there we move to any other needed sections.'

[Wed May 31 00:22:23 2000] Nizzle says, in Gnomish, 'I would say no, Kilkin.'
[Wed May 31 00:22:32 2000] Nizzle says, in Gnomish, 'One is not enough'

[Wed May 31 00:28:30 2000] Nizzle says, in Gnomish, 'I should say we have not decided on those branches yet.'
[Wed May 31 00:28:38 2000] Nizzle says, in Gnomish, 'Am I right?'
