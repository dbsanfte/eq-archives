        <p align="center"><font color="#CCCC00" size="4"><i>By</i> <b>Xilith T'Vyn 
          of Tunare </b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#CCCC00"> As a Shadow Knight, you are part 
          Warrior and part Necromancer. Obviously, Humans and Dark Elves with 
          their lower strength will try to make up for it with their greater mana. 
          Without getting into a debate about the best race for a Shadow Knight, 
          I will present each level of spells through 22 from my 26th level Dark 
          Elf Xilith's point of view. Rank 1 - Level 9 (mostly level 1 Necro spells) 
          Finally, you have spells! One nice thing about hybrids is the spells 
          are always cheap relative to a caster. You must remember to train in 
          your magic skills. There are 5 different schools of magic: Abjuration, 
          Alteration, Conjuration, Divination, and Evocation. In addition, you 
          should train in Channeling, which will allow you to cast faster, and 
          resist interruption. This is extremely important to an SK since they 
          almost always cast in combat and get hit in the middle. At level 26 
          I am able to recover quite often and get that spell off. At this rank, 
          you only get Alteration, Conjuration, and Divination spells, so you 
          might consider waiting to train Abjuration and Evocation (First Evocation 
          spell is at 22nd level - Ward Undead). After you have trained in the 
          magical arts, you must purchase your spells and scribe them. Since you 
          don't yet have Meditate, this can be a tedious process, but it will 
          get better at 12th level. At this level, you won't find magic to be 
          of that much assistance, but you will get used to having 10 higher strength 
          constantly. Disease Cloud: Diseases the target and hits for 5 damage. 
          The best use I have found for this spell is that at lower levels it 
          can be quite a taunt. I found monsters would stay on me more and off 
          my wizard if I threw a disease in between swings every now and then. 
          I still have it memorized, and use it on really long fights and while 
          kiting to prevent mobs from healing. Invisibility to Undead: At this 
          level, only useful to avoid wandering undead, can make the run up from 
          South Ro much easier. In a few levels, it is really good in Befallen, 
          and again later when pulling from the house in Unrest. I don't regularly 
          keep it memorized unless I'm in Unrest. Remember, you can cast this 
          one on others too. Mana cost is really high for this level. Leering 
          Corpse: Your first pet, it should be level 4+. Pets are the subject 
          of much debate for SK's. I'm doing an article on using pets soon as 
          well. I don't remember using my pet much at this level. Troll and Ogre 
          SK's may not be able to summon a pet when they first get this spell 
          due to the high mana cost. Locate Corpse: This will target the nearest 
          corpse, and turn you towards it. If you target a player, it will turn 
          you towards their corpse and target it. Obvious use is to find your 
          corpse, or if it's not lost, to plot a straight line to it. Another 
          use is when a monster dies inside a tree or wall. Clear your target 
          and cast this spell, and it will target the corpse. Then use the /loot 
          command to loot it. Sense the Dead: Targets the nearest undead, and 
          turns you toward it. This can be a problem in zones with a lot of SK's 
          and Necro's, such as Nektrulos, as it will target pets as well. Useful 
          at this level to find things to fight. Might allow to find pet if pet 
          is targeted Siphon Strength: Steals 10 strength from target and gives 
          it to you. I have had this spell memmed ever since I bought it, and 
          rely on it to remain unencumbered (weak DE remember?), and to get a 
          little extra damage. Low mana cost, so you can cast it on everything 
          you fight as a cheap debuff, or to pull. In my eyes, one of our best 
          spells. Rank 2 - Level 15 (mostly level 4 Necro spells) At this level, 
          you will see your spells start to make a larger difference in the way 
          you play, and you will find yourself much more effective at each new 
          rank. If you haven't already, train in Abjuration for Numb the Dead 
          and Endure Cold. Bone Walk: A new pet, about level 8. Much more useful 
          than the last one. Read my guide on pets for some tips at this level. 
          Clinging Darkness: The darkness line is one of our best set of spells. 
          I always had it memorized until I got Engulfing Darkness at level 22. 
          Although not much damage (25-30 points), it will slow the mob down considerably, 
          allowing you to run, or prevent them from running. A great spell to 
          pull with, and/or cast on a monster before it will run. A mob near death 
          will turn its back to you and stand there, waiting for you to finish 
          it off. I love that, and my party too. After the last patch, however, 
          it will not stack with root, so coordinate with your rooters, as this 
          is better in my opinion, and saves them some mana. See Fear below for 
          some interesting combos. Endure Cold: Useful when fighting shamen such 
          as orcs, goblins, and gnolls in High Pass, or in Befallen to help against 
          Ice Boned Skeletons. Also useful later on when fighting higher wizzes 
          that use cold based attacks. You can keep your group buffed with this 
          to save a shaman or other buffer some mana. Fear: This spell has a few 
          uses, and can get you into trouble as well. You can cast it on a mob 
          in a camp to pull the others, and not have to fight him until he returns. 
          You can also slow a mob with a darkness spell, and then fear it while 
          you and your pet or party beat on it. I used this to solo blues in South 
          Karanas a little after 22nd level with Engulfing Darkness. You have 
          to watch out, though, because feared monsters can and will bring back 
          friends when it wears off. Also great in PvP or duels, either using 
          the above tactic or, in dangerous zones, to get them killed by falling 
          or lava. Another use is to fear something to let you run away from it. 
          Due to the long casting time, difficult to get off while getting hit. 
          I usually pull with darkness, then send my pet to intercept, and cast 
          fear while he takes a few hits. Mend Bones: You can heal your pet, or 
          some other Necro/SK's pet with this. Doesn't heal very much, though, 
          but I generally have enough mana to burn as a DE. I used this in Oasis 
          at levels 15-17 to let my pet tank while I stepped in to take swings 
          with a high damage, high delay weapon (Shiny Brass Halberd I believe) 
          Read my pet guide for more info on this. Numb the Dead: Used like lull, 
          but undead. Useful for pulling part of an undead camp. I only used this 
          while camping skeletons in Rathe Mts, but might be useful to get you 
          out of Befallen or Unrest as well. Shadow Step: This spell casts really, 
          really fast, maybe in a sec. Useful in a duel or PvP to confuse your 
          advisary or to get a headstart on a mob/player while fleeing. It can 
          disorient you, too, so watch out. Rank 3 - Level 22 (mostly level 8 
          Necro Spells) This is a good time for SK's. You've just had your damage 
          cap removed, an improved regeneration rate, and now have double attack. 
          By now you have a good weapon, and your pet can no longer hold a monsters 
          attention if you are in melee with it.. The best spell at this level 
          is Engulfing Darkness, and improvement to Clinging Darkness that will 
          dish out about 100 points of damage in addition to the slowing effect 
          you've come to love. You will need to train Evocation if you haven't 
          yet, and will find it hard to improve since you have just got your first 
          Evoc spell, Ward Undead. Convoke Shadow: About level 12 pet. It can 
          now dish out more damage, but is only good for a few hits, so don't 
          let it tank except to get off a spell. Still, pets can be a good DOT. 
          Useful for the darkness/fear combo described above. Dark Empathy: Trades 
          about 20 hp from yourself to the target. For Trolls this can be really 
          useful to even out the hit points of the tanks. At this level, you won't 
          save many lives with it, so mainly useful after combat. One trick, if 
          you are already hurt to or below half and can bandage well, is to cast 
          on other wounded player(s) that are above half and then bandage yourself. 
          Useful if you can't rest long, and the other player can tank the next 
          fight since you will be left at half. Deadeye: See invisible. Great 
          on PvP servers to avoid a surprise, or to save a mage casting see invis 
          on you before following him invisibly. Engulfing Darkness: Did I mention 
          I love this line of spells? Better damage, but used the same. Good for 
          about 100 points. You can just about kite with this on blues. Spook 
          the Dead: Makes undead run away. I have never used this spell, but your 
          mileage may vary. Vampiric Embrace: Another point of argument. Most 
          likely due to the fact that often SK's use slow 2H slashing weapons 
          that don't give much of a chance to do the embrace. Also, has a short 
          duration (about the length of an average fight). At level 22 it will 
          steal 13 health, and it goes up one point for every two levels. A high 
          DEX will help it to go off more in combat. I've had it go off 4 times 
          in a fight, and I've had it go off none, but it's better than nothing, 
          so I try to cast before a pull or respawn. I'd be interested in hearing 
          from someone using a really low delay weapon to see how often they get 
          it to work. Contrary to what Necro's may tell you, this spell HAS been 
          changed to work with or without a weapon. Ward Undead: Does about 41 
          damage to undead. Not very much you say? But if you use a high delay 
          weapon like I do, you can cast in between swings and it starts stacking 
          up. You can also fall back and attack from afar with this if you get 
          seriously hurt. Here's a trick to get your Evocation up to par… Summon 
          a pet, target it, and cast this repeatedly. You will fizzle a lot at 
          first, but you will improve, even though your pet is unaffected. I did 
          this while camping a slow spawn and got it up 60 points in one night.</font></p>
