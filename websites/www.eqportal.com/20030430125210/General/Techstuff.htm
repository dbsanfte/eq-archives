        problems, please make sure that you are using the most current drivers 
        available on the hardware manufacturer's web-site. In addition, we STRONGLY 
        advise you to go check out the <a href="s_video.html">Video Card FAQ</a>.

        to Windows. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Solution:</b> Make 
        sure that you have at least 100 megabytes of free space on the drive that 
        the EverQuest directory is located on. In addition, you will need to have 
        Windows managing your virtual memory memory AND that you have at least 
        200 meg free on the drive Windows resides (usually Drive C). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Problem:</b> A

        on the Play EverQuest button on the Server Selection screen. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Solution:</b> There 
        are a few possibilities relating to this error. The most likely is that 
        you are using an older model Cyrix processor. These processors don't work 
        with EverQuest. To confirm this, we recommend calling our Tech Support.

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Solution:</b> This 
        most likely means you have the CIH virus on your system. It is extremely 
        important that you rid your system of this Virus for a lot of reasons 
        (EverQuest being one of them). We recommend going to <a href="http://www.avp.com/" target="_blank">http://www.avp.com</a> 
        and downloading the Anti Viral Toolkit Pro. This will find and clean your 
        system. Please note that this Virus DID NOT come with EverQuest. It is 
        most likely gotten by downloading programs over the Net. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Solution:</b> This

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Solution:</b> This

        to <a href="http://www.3dfx.com/" target="_blank">http://www.3dfx.com</a> 
        and get the drivers there, or go to the <a href="s_video.html#voodoo1">Video

        running EverQuest with an ATI Rage 2, Rage 2+, or Rage Pro based chipset, 
        pink borders will appear around the item icons, on-screen overlays, and 
        chat. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Solution:</b> This 
        means you don't have the latest drivers. Please go to the <a href="s_video.html#ati">Video

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Problem:</b> While

        at the "EverQuest" loading screen and an error window with the message, 
        "VXD error, expecting 1.4, found 1.X". </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Solution:</b> You 
        are not running the most recent drivers for your video card. Please perform 
        the following procedure; Click on the "Start" button located on your Windows 
        taskbar. Next, highlight "Find", then select "Files or Folders…". Then 
        type "Glide.*" in the "Named" field and click the "Find Now" button. After 
        the search for the "Glide.*" file is complete, delete all of the "Glide.*" 
        files from the list. Once the Glide files have been deleted, you will 
        then need to install the most recent drivers from the card manufacturer's 
        web-site. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Problem:</b> When 
        using a card with a Banshee based chipset, you are unable to run EverQuest 
        in Glide. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Solution:</b> Currently 
        Glide mode in EverQuest does not work with the Banshee Chipset, so you 
        won't even see it is an option. The reason for this is a known problem 
        in Glide 3 that 3dfx is working on. They have just released new drivers 
        that appear to fix the problem. After we have completed testing of these 
        drivers we will turn Glide mode back on for the Banshee. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Problem:</b> When 
        using the ATI Rage Fury many graphical problems occur </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Solution:</b> Go 
        to the <a href="s_video.html#ati">Video Card FAQ</a> section and download 
        the latest drivers right from our site. These drivers ARE NEWER then the 
        ones on the ATI site. Once these go live on the ATI site we will take 
        the file down from our site and put in a link to theirs. </font></p>

        game is locking up after clicking on Play EverQuest on the server selection 
        screen on the loading screen with the Elf Woman on it. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Solution:</b> Many 
        errors occur at this point, almost all of them are related to not having 
        the most current drivers for your card. Lots of problems occur with Riva 
        TNT cards in this area if you don't have the latest drivers. Make sure 
        you have the ones we have tested EverQuest with by going to the <a href="s_video.html#rivatnt">Video 
        Card FAQ</a> section. </font></p>

        Voodoo2 locks up when switching between resolutions. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Solution:</b> Most 
        likely you DO have the latest drivers. The ones that are up on the 3dfx 
        site (and most of the card vendors) actually have a known bug in Glide 
        3.0 - To solve this, go to the older drivers in the <a href="noflash/s_video.html#voodoo2" target="_content">Video 
        Card FAQ</a> section. 3dfx is working on this problem, so hopefully the 
        next release of the V2 drivers will fix this problem. </font></p>

        is very dark and the Gamma Sliders don't seem to work. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Solution:</b> Currently 
        the Gamma Correction only works in Glide mode. It will be fixed very shortly 
        in D3D. If you are using D3D mode, use your cards video control center 
        to make the game brighter. </font></p>

        seems to run very slowly on your machine. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Solution:</b> EverQuest 
        is a very high end application. We recommend you increase your ram first. 
        Next is to make sure to have a 3d card that is modern by today's standards. 
        A Voodoo2, a Riva TNT or something along those lines. We also recommend 
        turning off particle effects (on the Display Options menu in game). We 
        also strongly recommend turning Sound Realism down to the lowest setting 
        as this will also help with framerate. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Solution:</b> Unfortunately 
        this is most likely the symptom of a bad connection to the game. If this

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Solution:</b> We
