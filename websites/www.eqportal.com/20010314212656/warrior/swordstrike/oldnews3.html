I noticed that i forgot to mention that if you want to write an Editorial, or Guide, then you can send them to us!  If they are well written, then i will post it on the site.  Just title your E-Mail as "Editorial" or "Guide"  and please include if you wish to have your email posted or not...  And PLEASE send em to us!  I know ady isnt here, but now that i have more time, i am working on the site!  I am doing my best...  I know that banner is annoying, but when Ady returns, we will move the site...  In the meantime, continue to post on our msg board, it will be a while til the move!<Br>
<p>   Also, for those of you who wanted the <i>SwordStrike</i> Gif banner, the program which i was using expired, and deleted my gifs...  WHEN i get a new one, (probably tonight)  i will recreate a <i>SwordStrike</i> Banner.  If you want one, please send us an email stating that you do, title it Banner, and i will send one to you...  Sorry bout how late this is, but well its taken a ton of my time and i have Veterens Day off, so i will be working on the site!  <BR></p>

Well i added a new section to our site, its called Editorials!  It is placed in our guides section, with a new visual!  This whole thing was spawned because i got an EXCELLENT email about melee problems and solutions. <BR>
Also, about the Angelfire banner, i have noticed that it pops up EVERY time i click on a swordstrike link, i am uncertain whether this is just my problem or everyones, but as for now, just minimize it, dont close it or it will just plague you...  I will have Ady work on this as soon as hes back on.<BR>

First, i must appologize about the utter lack of updates on the site.  Ady has been banned from the net, until he can raise his GPA a bit, and i am somewhat limited in my usage from my homework, and keeping my gpa up...  Anyway,  it seems that grey is the choice most prefered in the poll, so if i get the chance i will ask ady how to change it, and do so.  As for the news section, it will remain the way it is for color codeing purposes.  <BR>
Ady = <font color="blue">Blue</font><BR>
ME, Spartycus = Red<BR>
Anything else, not directly ours is, <font color="silver">Grey</font>
<BR> I am also looking into a new format for the msg board.  If it is possible i was thinking a board resembling the stratics one would be nice, and if we could color code it to our red and black and blue, it would be great!  <BR>
Again, sorry about our droping the ball like that...<BR>

<font color="blue">Hmm... Sparty used the word "wee"?  *ahem*.  Whatever.  I've put up a new poll on what you guys want the main color of the text to be.  The background will likely stay the same, so base your decision on that.<BR><BR>
Angelfire is giving us some kewl new tools.  CGI-BINs, Java Scrips, etc.  BUT we are now forced to put up an ad or be be deleted.  This means that we will be moving to <a href="http"//www.eqportal.com" target="_parent">EQPortal</a>.  Seems like a good enough site, and we've been invited so, why not.  What that means, is that the site at Angelfire, after the move, will have a big link to the normal page, but everything else will stay the same.  If that doesn't make sense, then don't worry about it.<BR><BR>
If you haven't been reading the message board, Spartycus is going to be taking 'a leave of absence'.  Basically he's not gonna do any work except the work he likes and has another thing he can whine about.  That also means that we might want another person to help us out with our updates.  Or two.  Whatever.  If so, we'll do this after the move to EQPortal.<BR><BR>
I'm going to be updating the equipment, mainly the PoF stuff, and try to get some things like STR/DEX/STA/AGI enhancing, warrior using, items up.  Its gonna take a while, so don't expect anything too soon.<BR>

Ahh back to updating the news section!!!!  I have been checking the message board every chance i get, and experimenting with new picture designs... I ALSO decided to start a string on our <B><i><A HREF="http://www.sitepowerup.com/mb/view.asp?BoardID=109769" target="_top">message board</a></b></i>, open to anyone who wishes to post about the problems of everquest, and what verant can do to solve them.  I will be sending the ENTIRE string to Verant on <B>October 29th, 1999</b>.  So dont miss out!<BR>

<font color="blue">Well, sorry about the lacks of updates.  Sparty and I, while not actually updating the news, have been checking the message board, and doing, um.. <i>research</i> on EverQuest :).  Well, to make up for it, I've posted a HUGE update today.  I updated the 1HS, put in the <B><a href="quCFT.html">CRAFTED QUEST!!!</a></b>.  Also, updated the Crafted stats so they are correct, in the equipment section.  Hmm... not much else to report on.  Grades coming in soon... mom will probably be pissed cause she is mad no matter what I get :-(, which might mean less online time for me for a while :_(.  Oh well.  Laterz.

<font color="blue">Hey, I added EQItems to the <a href="links.html"><B>links</b></a> section.  Go check it out, its a great site, and has information on almost all the items in the game.  <BR>

<font color="blue">Not much time to update, but theres a new person in the friends section, Stichy, I know hes a wizard, but hes so short and fuzzy and... oh well, anyway if you're interested in asherons call then, <UL>
<li><a href="http://cod.xrgaming.net/download/"><B>Click here</b></a> to download the Asherons Call bets (approx 55 meg)
<li>and then go to <a href="http://www.zone.com"><B>www.zone.com</b></a> and sign up for your Microsoft zone account. The rest should be easy.</ul>
<B><i>WARNING:</i></b> The file IS big, and I wouldn't reccomend downloading it if you aren't seriously interested in playing it, unless you have DSL or something.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!<Br>

Not to be left out, i changed the frames a bit... I made a new tiny little logo for the corner there, and added a feature to turn the music back on if you have a slight change of heart.  I mean KILLING the music, like what did the music ever do to you?(sorry bout the digression) Also i have been playing Asherons Call as of late, and have come to the conclusion that Microsoft cannot make games very well.  AC will be another KeWlDeWdZ game but is very interesting, and for some people it will be nice.  I wrote a nice little editorial about the 3 games UO, EQ, and AC, and you can check it out in the Guides section under <a href="Weeklyrant.html"><CENTER><IMG SRC="images/Rantpic.jpg" width="500" height="50" border="0"> </center></a><BR> Which is possibly the coolest picture i have done so far, and my favorite part of the site, second only to the msg board!<BR>

<font color="blue">WHOOHOO FINALLY FRAMES!!! I've spent the last 40 minutes updating every page we have, and working on the menu.  A few new things:  I didn't have time (nor the patience, attention span, etc.) to double check EVERY page that I updated, so some of them may look weird... please go through all the pages and send an email if you find something wrong.  Second, I've now made the option to turn off the music.  Right under the counter on the menu there should be a hyperlink to do it.  (three) One of the problems with frames, however, is that people with a 600x400 resolution WILL NOT be able to see the last few choices of the menu.  If this is you, then change your resolution (if you dont know how, left click on desktop, click properties, then click on settings tab on the top of the window that opens up, then in the lower right hand corner there should be a slider tab, move that to the right, and the number under it should change to look like 800 x 600, then click apply (if you do this and it screws up your computer its not my fault)) or get a new monitor.  Fourth, i took down the pic that was behind the menu eirlier... there really was no way to have it up and keep the menu readable, so I'll get sparty to do a new one.  Fifth, the news from the 1st to the 7th has been  sent into the void.  <BR><BR>
Okay now we're thinking of putting up a petition that we can get the viewers of our site to sign to make Bind Wounds better.  I have no idea how I should go about doing this so if you have any ideas, please email us. <BR>
