<b>January 7, 2002 - New Navigation for GPS Pages!</b>
	<hr>
<p align="justify">After a couple days of hard work, and a large shovel, I've dug my way through the old "EverScrolling" page with the GPS listings and hope that you will find a better system in it's place. Please let us know if you see anything that isn't as it should be and start sending in those updates! Enjoy. ~*~ Kritta

<b>January 5, 2002 - Geerlok trivials found!</b>
<hr>
<p>
Mikael of Antonius Bayle has found the trivials to the Geerlok Tradeskill Enhancers.  The number to be reached is <b>215</b>.  No more, no less.  Great job, Mikael, and good luck on your journey to 250!<p>
<b>January 4, 2002 - Happy New Year, and a new beginning for the forums</b>
<hr>
<p>
The tinkering forum has MOVED.  All links to the old one have been changed to the new one.  I moved them because Fulcrum was still the only admin for the old boards, and EZBoard was not able to make me an admin.  The new board is CSC Gold, which means there are NO ADS!  EVER!  For anyone who visits our board! Horray! Go on and visit the New Tinkering Forum at <a href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/btinkeringforum> http://pub39.ezboard.com/btinkeringforum</a>.  Enjoy!<p>
Another grand piece of news.. Kritta Didymus of the E'Ci server has accepted the position of "Trusted Lieutenant" on the boards, and here at Tinkering.org.  Everyone please welcome her to the job!  You can email her at ecitinker@hotmail.com.  Congrats, Kritta, and welcome aboard!<p>


<b>December 9, 2001 - All Luclin info here now!</b>
<hr>
<p>
Check the recipe and ingredients pages to find out what you need, and where you can find it, when you start making the new Luclin tinkering stuff.  So far, it's all been verified as *NOT* trivial at 205... Because it's so cheap (we're talking 5pp for the fermentation device), hopefully we'll find the trivials on these soon! Good luck!<p>

OK, well it sounded good at the time.<p>
A temporary page has been set up <a href=geerlok.html>here</a> so you can see the recipies and start collecting parts.  I have not yet found any of the mob drops... I'll keep you all updated!

<b>November 25, 2001 - More updates!</b><br>
<hr>
<p>
OK, I've just added more names to the GPS.  Look for your favorite gnomes on your server, and see how they're doing.  I've also changed the trivial listing on the gemcutter to 101, and powered gloves to 118. Special thanks to Frustraton Redfrost of Mith Marr, and Joebobhenry Hatfield of Solusek Ro!  (:

<b>November 11, 2001 - Rebreather How-to online</b><br>

<p>
The new Rebreather instructions are now posted.  Click on the rebreather icon up top to find it.  I replaced the gemcutter, because it's use has already been found.  The page is still there, and I can bring it back to the forefront if need be.  I would love to hear comments about the rebreather page, so please, email me at <a href=mailto:fizzwizz@tinkering.org>fizzwizz@tinkering.org</a>

<b>November 10, 2001 - Can it be? An update?</b><br>
<hr>
<p>
Well, well, well.  It's been a busy two months for me.  Being in the Air Force in the wake of the tragedy on September 11 has lead to me having little to no time to update this site.  Well, I'm back now.  Whee!  I've installed Windows XP on my computer, and it blasted away all of my email.  I'm still not happy about that.  I was unable to salvage most of the GPS updates that people sent in, so check the list now.  If you're not there, I don't have your name.
<p>
This weekend (Thank goodness it's three days!) I'll be adding a little bit to the site, including a rebreather "how-to" document.  This should help some of the up-and-coming tinkerers.
<p>
In the "News From the Moon" department, at least a couple new zones will be airless moonscapes, which means people will have to bring their own air. This, in turn, means that rebreathers <i>should</i> sell like hotcakes at zonelines and in the bazaar zone. I'm hoping so!
<p>
I'll update at least one more time this weekend, so keep checking back!
<p>

<b>September 11, 2001 - "A day to remember"</b><br>
<hr>
<p>
My thoughts and prayers go out to those whose lives were touched by the events today.  This is not a news station, so that's all I'm going to say.<p>
On a completely unrelated note, I've had a LOT of computer problems...  Anyone who sent in info to put on the GPS needs to email me again.  I'm really sorry about that.<p>


<b>August 30, 2001 - Gemcutter news</b><br>
<hr>
<p>
Thank you very much, everyone who has cut and pasted the story from Everlore about gemcutters.  It is appreciated.  Here is the note, in case you missed it.<p>

<center><table width=80%><tr><td><i>Since the discovery of the Gem Cutter gnomes have wondered its uses.<p>

The gemcutter can be used in place of the Darfumpel part of the shadow night quest containing a faceted Hyacinth as a quest componet.<p>

Take one gemcutter and one uncut hyacinth and put into a jewelry bag. Have a high-level jeweler combine these items and you receive the faceted Hyacinth.<p>

Darfumple (npc) charges 1000pp to facet the stone so using this, shadow nights could probably get it done cheaper from pc sources. This is the only quest I know of that it works on but it is surely compatible with other stones...</tr></table></center><p>

Lots of you sent that to me, so I figured I would put it here, even though the news originated on our message board.<p>

In related news, Stonebrunt is now open.  My iksar talked to every cat NPC he could find, and no mention of gems of any sort was made.  If anyone has any news that gemcutters have a use there, please email it to <a href=mailto:fizzwizz@tinkering.org>fizzwizz@tinkering.org</a>.  Thanks!<p>


<b>August 24, 2001 - I never thought I would start an update like this...</b><br>
<hr>
<p>An anonymous source close to Verant recently emailed me with this tidbit of information!<p>
<center><table width=80%><tr><td><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;i have it on good aurothority The Gem cutter is used for the production of 2 items which where originally in the BETAgame, but due to the inbalancing caused by these items they where dropped from the game, However the mighty wise gods at verant decided to keep the gem chopper in for use in a later quest/tinkerable item....<p>
  
The time is upon us soon<p>
 
Lunar events will provide answer to one of the uses<p>
 
The burnt granite hills of Odus will point to the other</tr></table></center>
<p>
I asked more about the Stonebrunt information, and the anonymous source replied with this:<p>
<center><table width=80%><tr><td>  <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;my source gets a little vague here, but i am led to believe that a new and rare mineral will be discover shortly after the discovery of stoneburtn mountains which will alloy the production of an item that requires a highly polished and shaped gem (look to your pages for further clues)</tr></table></center><p>
Of course, we here at the Compendium will keep you up to date, as soon as Stonebrunt Mountains goes live (should be any time now!)<p>

<b>August 21, 2001 - Just a little note.</b><br>

<hr>
<p>Special thanks to Menhir, the lvl 58 monk on Tunare who has helped me kill holgreshes twice now, because he's looking for the elder beads.  If you ever make a gnome cleric or warrior, you've got a pair of arms (at least!) coming.  Thanks!<p>

<b>August 18, 2001 - Website updates.</b><br>

<hr>
<p>I made a bunch of updates to the GPS.  If you sent me an email, you should be there now.  Let me know if you're not!  According to Igbert, it's possible to go above 200 in tinkering now, but he has hit a wall at 203.  It's unknown if that is the new limit, or if he just had REALLY bad luck with the random number generator.  We'll keep you informed, of course!<p>

<b>August 11, 2001 - Yakatizma Speaks Again!</b><br>

<hr>
<p>After Igbert got skill 200, and was unable to raise his skill to 201, after 80 combines, I sent off another email to Yakatizma, the Tradeskill guy at Verant.  He responded, telling us that it is curently impossible to get to skill 201 or above, but it may be changed in the next patch (on Tuesday).  You can read all about it <a href=yakmail2.txt>here</a>!<p>
In not-quite-related news, I did some major updates to the GPS.  If you're already on the System, but want your data updated (new email address, or a higher skill), let me know!<p>


<b>August 8, 2001 - Website Updates Abound!</b><br>

<hr>
<p>I awarded three <a href=goldengear.html>Golden Gears</a> today, for the categories of <b>Thermal Cloak Trivial Point</b>, <b>Rebreather Trivial Point</b>, and <b>For Outstanding Resolve and Dedication (200 skill)</b>.  Great job, all of you, and keep up the good work!<p>
I've decided that any tinkerer who surpasses skill 200 will receive a Golden Gear.  I will require a screenshot proving this, of course.<p>
I also updated the Trivial points (or lack thereof) of Footwarming Boots and the Vanishing Device on the <a href=recipes.html>Recipes</a> page.<p>
I'd like to ask all Tinkerers out there to write in to <a href=mailto:fizzwizz@tinkering.org>fizzwizz@tinkering.org</a> with any information they'd like to add to the <a href=locator.html>Gnome Positioning System (GPS)</a>.  I'll make a concerted effort to keep that page as up to date as possible, but I'll need your help!<p>
Happy Tinkering!<p>




<b>August 7, 2001 - A Personal Victory</b><br>

<hr>
<p>It's almost amazing how good a single click can make you feel, no matter what had happened before. Last night, I attempted two vanishing devices, and failed both.  Ah well, was kind of expecting it. I pulled out the holgresh furs I had just bought for 50pp each, and stuck them in the toolbox with all the other stuff.  Click one, failed and got my fine plate arms back.  Do it again, and........<p>

Yay!  Rebreathers are now trivial, and I have something to show for all of my hard work and spent cash... My first piece of Watchman armor! I'm very happy about this! Can you tell?<p>
In related news, and MUCH more impressive, Igbert, a regular poster on the boards, just got skill 200!!!  Congratulate him at <a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/ffulcrumstinkeringforumsworkbench.showMessage?topicID=695.topic>this thread!</a><p>
<b>August 6, 2001 - Two updates.</b><br>

<hr>
<p>Two verified trivial points were added this morning. Chupon of Vazelle wrote in with screenshots proving a trivial point of 82 for the Thermal Cloak, and Saervil of Brell Serilis let us know, once and for all, that rebreathers go trivial at 175.  Thanks go out to them both!<p>
There's a lively discussion going on in the forum this week, about the difficulty of raising the skill past 175.  Feel free to stop by and add your own opinion.  Is it too hard to find components?  Does it take too long to search and destroy haze panthers? Are we all just lazy, and expect this to be like smithing or brewing?  Tell us what you think over on this thread!

<b>August 3, 2001 - Yakatizma speaks!</b><br>

<hr>
<p>So yesterday I felt a whim come over me and I sent an email over to Dan "Yakatizma" Enright.  He hinted to some special things coming soon (well, maybe) to tinkering.  I'll let you all read the email.  Enjoy!<p>

<b>August 2, 2001 - Fulcrum's Under New Management!</b><br>

<hr>
<p>Hello, fellow tinkerers!  My name is Fizzwizz Cookiegnomie, and I play on the Tunare server, along with Dakirn (when he plays).  My tinkering skill is 174, the highest on my server.</p>
<p>Because of continued time constraints, Dakirn has not been able to update this site as much as he'd like, and he's asked me to take his place, and put new blood back into the Tinkering Compendium.  I'll try not to let him down!  (:</p>
<p>I look forward to talking to you all over at the <a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/bfulcrumstinkeringforums target=new_window>message board</a>!</p>

<b>May 30, 2001 - Clockwork Watchman Helmet Update!</b><br>

<hr>
<p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>Today's patch fixed the clockwork watchman helmet. It was announced in the 
  patch log as being fixed. Go Gnomes!</p>
<b>April 30, 2001 - Site updates</b><br>
<hr>
<p>I know it's been a while since I've last updated the site, but there hasn't 
  been much new information on the tinkering front.</p>
<p>As most of you are aware, the clockwork watchman helmet graphic no longer shows 
  up when viewed by other people. I have personally sent a few e-mails to <A href="mailto:eqmail@station.sony.com">eqmail@station.sony.com</a>, 
  <a href="mailtop:eqtesting@station.sony.com">eqtesting@station.sony.com</a>, and to <a href="mailto:eqcs@station.sony.com">eqcs@station.sony.com</a> in response to this. 
  The best that I've come up with so far from the EQ Customer Service department, 
  is that this is being looked into, and was most likely unintentional.</p>
<p>Still, I have also posted many times on the new boards in both the Developer's 
  corner and the Bug and Testing forum. I have yet to see any response.</p>
<p>I am going to gather up a listing of posts from the past few weeks from the 
  message boards, and compile them into an e-mail which I will send to just about 
  every EverQuest e-mail address I can find. Hopefully, this will get some type 
  of response from them before the next patch.</p>
<p>Along with the disappointment about the helmet skin, I am also going to post 
  a few other problems that the community has noticed with the current state of 
  tinkering, such as the extreme difficulty of raising skill past 175, vanishing 
  devices, and other component woes.</p>
<p>I've started a post on the message board, <a href="http://pub7.ezboard.com/ffulcrumstinkeringforumsworkbench.showMessage?topicID=524.topic">Rants 
  and Raves</a>, which I will turn into an e-mail to Verant later this week. I'm 
  hoping to get some good information here, so please don't just flame them. Constructive 
  criticism is needed :)</p>
<p>As for the site updates, I'm going to update the GPS tomorrow or Wednesday.</p>
<p></p>
<b>March 10, 2001 - Clockwork Breastplate made!</b><br>

<hr>
<p>For everyone who doesn't know, Meshugugget of Luclin has made the first <a href="bp.html" target="new_window">clockwork 
  watchman breastplate</a>! Grats go out to her and Kraket, Mutt, Wyrian and Sbik 
  for helping to gather components. She said it took about 30 attempts of vanishing 
  devices and breastplates for her to make one. She successfully made it with 
  a skill of 156.</p>
<p>Clockwork gauntlets have also been made, but I do not yet have a screenshot 
  of them. Wyzskarlet of Brell was the first person to make these and let anyone 
  know :) The gauntlets are a +30 strength buff. That means boots are going to 
  be dex.</p>
<p>Also, Knok Verst of the Karana server has informed me that Clockwork Watchman 
  Armor is activateable at level 20.</p>
<b>February 21, 2001 - Site updates</b><br>
<hr>
<p>Okey everyone, doing some site updates today, yay!</p>
<p>Mostly GPS and component locations were updated. Also, I have been informed 
  that Rebreathers are trivial at a skill of 177. Since this is the closest number 
  I have, I'm going to update the recipe section (I'm sorry to whoever e-mailed 
  me this, I can't find it anywhere.)</p>
<p>Also, I have heard from someone who parsed the spell data file that guantlets 
  and boots cast +30 strength buff and a +30 dex buff (Steam Overload and Mana 
  Infusion).. don't know which does which yet.</p>
<b>January 29, 2001 - Vanishing Device made!</b> 
<hr>
<p>It is my great pleasure to introduce the finished <a href="images/device.jpg" target=new_window>gnomish 
  vanishing device</a>! Thanks go out to Wyzskarlet of Brell Serilis, and to Krilan 
  for supplying the eye and keeping the finished product. This item was not trivial 
  at 154 skill. The item is what appears to be a secondary slot item, with 5 charges 
  of invisbility cloak. Also, the item appears to be ALL/ALL as well. I've added 
  a link in the recipe section to the stats of the item.</p>
<b>January 10, 2001 - Back to work!</b> 
<hr>
<p>Well, I've finally got a chance to do some updates.  The javascript errors for the Netscape users should be gone now.  There are a couple GPS updates, and I've added screenshots of the Clockwork Watchman Helmet to the recipes section (just click on the link).  Also, I will be updating the ingredients location page as soon as I get a chance.  I've been busy lately, and my internet connection has been so cheesy that I've been stuck in Hate for two weeks now :(  But, rest assured, that I will update it in the near future!</p>

<b>December 27, 2000 - Happy Holidays!</b> 
<hr>
<p>Happy holidays everyone!</p>
<p>I've made a few updates to the recipes page with the descovery of the clockwork 
  watchman armor. I'm still looking into the JavaScript problems that Netscape 
  users are experiencing, and I hope to fix it soon.</p>
<p>Also, I have updated the GPS.</p>
<p>Also, I have recieved many e-mails asking about the mailing list. I have posted 
  a link to the mailing list (EQ_Tinkering), where all you have to do is sign 
  up. I'm not running this list, but it seems to have a lot of members. So sign 
  up!</p>
<b>December 17, 2000 - Updates at last!</b> 
<hr>
<p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>Finally got some updates up! Woohoo!</p>
<p>The new stuff from Velious has been added to the various sections of the site, 
  as well as quite a few GPS updates. The Community Posting has been re-made into 
  the link for the Forums. There is a link on the Links page to the old posting, 
  if anyone needs it for some reason.</p>
<p>I'll be getting back to doing updates. It's been hard without internet access, 
  but everything should be smooth once I get back to playing the game and getting 
  the expansion.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who sent me pictures and information from the new book. 
  I've been busy wading through the 200 emails I got from everyone (PLEASE remember 
  to resize your screenshots!)</p>
N<b>ovember 21, 2000 - Eeeeek!</b> 
<hr>
<p>Ok ok ok! Stop e-mailing meeeee!As many, many people have stated, that is crushed 
  diamond in TD, not diamond dust!</p>
<p>Small update today. I hope to update the GPS during the holiday weekend. </p>
<p>Included in the future enchancements, I'll be making a change to the pricing 
  for tinkering. I'll be including a high/low scale to show the price for tinkering 
  with 60 charisma, 100 charisma, and 150 charisma. A lot of people have been 
  asking for this, since we have such a low charisma. I've started a post on the 
  tinkering board called &quot;Tinkering Prices,&quot; so if anyone has information, 
  it'll make it a lot easier for me to update the pricing :)</p>
<p>Velious is fast approaching, hopefully some new tinkering stuff will come from 
  it :)</p>
<b>November 10, 2000 - Updates, updates, updates! </b> 
<hr>
<p>Wow, sorry for the long delay folks. I've been trapped inside Fulcrum's workshop 
  for almost a month. I went inside to find a couple notes for King Ak'Anon and 
  couldn't find my way out. Luckly a few Watchmen came by and helped me out:)</p>
<p>Quite a few updates today, mostly to the GPS. I have also been informed that 
  there is already a Tinkering mailing list, which you can find out more information 
  about here: <a href=http://www.egroups.com/group/EQ_Tinkering>http://www.egroups.com/group/EQ_Tinkering</a>.</p>
<p>Also, Dielzen of the Innoruuk server has informed me that Diamond Dust also 
  drops in Timorous Deep every twenty minutes next to Golra on the Golra Iceberg. 
  He said that the gorolas are mostly blue to a level 32 monk. I don't have a 
  loc for it, but will be posting one as soon as I get it.</p>
<b>October 17, 2000 - Site Updates and Mailing List Poll </b> 
<hr>
<p>I've updated the recipie section to include powered gloves and catapults. I 
  have posted a message on the forums asking if anyone wants a tinkering mailing 
  list. I've already recieved a few e-mails about people who want one, but I figured 
  that I'd put a message up on the boards, since some people bypass the site completely 
  :( </p>
<b>October 16, 2000 - Mailing List and other things </b> 
<hr>
<p>Ok, I'm not sure what happened to the mailing list, or even if it's still around, 
  but if anyone wants one let me know. If I get enough people interested I'll 
  start another one up.</p>
<p>I have also put a big warning on the community recipies page. Apparently, some 
  people were trying to make the items and posting why they didn't work. Keep 
  in mind the community posting page is for tinkering ideas, and do not currently 
  work in the game, nor may they ever work.</p>
<p>I'm also looking for a screenshot of powered gloves and a catapult so that 
  I can update the recipie sections. If anyone has them, send them to me please 
  :) </p>
<b>October 14, 2000 - Site Updates Coming Soon!</b> 
<hr>
<p>Greetings Everyone.As many of you know, Fulcrum is currently MIA. Since that 
  is the case, I am here to take over the tinkering Compendium. I am Dakirn Wigglesnout, 
  Gnome Warrior extrordinare of the Tunare server. Some of you may already know 
  me, some of you do not, but I'm going to do my best to keep this site going.</p>
<p>You'll notice quite a few changes over the next few weeks. I plan to change 
  the website a little to make it prettier. If you anyone has suggestions for 
  the site, please feel free to e-mail me at <a href=mailto:dakirn@tinkering.org>dakirn@tinkering.org.</a></p>
<p>Also, I have registered the domain name <a href=http://www.tinkering.org>www.tinkering.org</a> 
  to make it easier for some people to access the site. Since there is a tinkering 
  upgrade planned for around the time of the Velious expansion, I figured that 
  it'd be easier for people to remember that way =)</p>
<p>The forums will be staying the same, I like them and didn't want to touch 'em.Change 
  is not always painless, but hopefully we'll be able to pull together as a community 
  to make this new site the premiere tinkering information on the internet!</p>
