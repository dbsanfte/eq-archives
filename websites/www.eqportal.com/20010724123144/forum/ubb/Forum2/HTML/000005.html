</FONT><HR>Before we had illusions and pets what made enchanters Enchanters?<BR>What was it that struck you as the core intent of the class?<BR>I rarely bother with a pet. Got them late enough that I never really bothered.<BR>The illusions are key to me for the versatility they give us.<BR>Enchants are not in place and your bit about the tells if they do get in place is right on.<BR>Most of the spells people have fun with don't come up until 12th level which is a bit late for core abilities. So<BR>what is our core?<BR>We have kind of neat cbt spells but most would rather use an a Wizard or even a pet over our offensive spells.<BR>The manual specifically states we will never be as good at them as a Wizard.<BR>This means they are not the core. Buffs and debuffs?<BR>There is a reason we get so many tells for a cure or heal. When people think Buffs they think the priest classes<BR>and if we can buff we must be able to heal since other priests can.<BR>Fact is though that we are missing many buffs and are not as good at it as Shamans or Druids in general or Hp<BR>and AC buffs as the Cleric.<BR>As to Debuffs they are resisted all too often and other classes get some of ours as well. They certainly are not<BR>very spectaluar when you have to explain thier effect after a battle.<P>So what is our core?<BR>Not offensive power, not buffs, not debuffs, not pets, not illusions, not enchantment(at least not yet). Can we do<BR>anything better then anyone else and is that something so useful to a party that parties generally consider the<BR>Enchanter a valauble member? <BR>I became an Enchanter because I wanted to group. At 8th level I can buff a bit but not so good as a Priest type,<BR>nor can I fight as well as them and I cant heal.<BR>What do I tell people when trying to convince them they should let me join instead of just coming to me at the city<BR>or dungeon gates becasue they want me to make stuff for them?<BR>Is making stuff our core? We get Enchant metal spells but magicains make more then we can.<P>Again what is our Core? THE defining thing that makes our class?<BR>I think versatility.<BR>We are the jack of all trades for the magic user proffesions.<BR>We can do a bit of each of the others though not so well as any of them.<BR>We can do crowd control, stop or start trains, weaken our enimies and strengthen our allies, get better then<BR>average prices, go more places then others (and even help our party travel), and do more outside of combat<BR>then anyone except a Rogue.<BR>Personaly I want a few more buffs. Dextrous Aura at 4th and Feet Like Cat at 8th and an improved Strength<BR>spell. I never want us to get stronger pets or heals or endures and I think our offensive spell list is set just about<BR>right. the buffs may give us that visible edge to help us party. I also of course wnat the spells the manual says<BR>are our core abilities. Enchant Places and things. People are covered pretty well for now. However people see<BR>us a support class and when they compare us to Clerics, Druids, Shamans or Bards we often come up short in<BR>their minds and current goals/requests.<BR>However as it stands though I find this a more difficult and slow advancing class to play this class has the most<BR>travel and entertaining options available to it at higher levels.<BR>When we are tired of fighting monsters we can do quests or explore.<BR>Or just amuse ourselves and others with various tricks.<BR>Hard work but wide rewards.<BR>I'm in this class for the exploring and fun. As my friends tell me that is why I am still 8th level.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I have no direct answer to your question but perhaps our most distinctive ability is the fact that we can reliably beat yellow monsters solo with little chance of dying absent interference from a second monster.  This is not true, so far as i can tell, of any other character class except necros and clerics against undead.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I dont see combat as the core of this class.  i usually go for blues but do recognize some types of Yellows are easier for me to handle then they would be for another class.  Just as Undead are for Clerics and Magicians can usually solo Yellows before 12 as well.<BR>Here is an excerpt of my thoughts.<BR>I am pretty happy with this class and feel our offensive power is set about right.<BR>I wish we had a bit more in the Buff department considering how good Shamans, Druids and Clerics are at it with the<BR>rest of the stuff they get.<BR>I want to be obviously useful to a group without having to act as a pushy salesman everytime I'm looking for a group in<BR>a new area. Also before we get Whirl at 12 many dont really want to share with us.<BR>However the Enchantments would be a nice way to have us buff (especialy with temp enchantments). Your right we<BR>would get a lot of Tells from people asking us to do it for them for free. Never mind our time and mana investment or<BR>that they would not want to party with us.<BR>I could live with the Tells. I certainly get enough of them now asking for Cures and heals which really aggravates me.<BR>However I have visions of setting up shop outside a dungeon and casting Rune on people someday. No I would not<BR>want to do it all the time, but it would be fun now and then. Also as the odd help to the newbie or short term gift to one<BR>who just aided you or was simply freindly.<BR>The main reason we should get those enchantments though is the description of our class everywhere you look.<BR>To quote....<BR>The primary focus of the Enchanter’s art can be summed up<BR>by the name of the arcane order to which he belongs:<BR>Enchanter. Their spells are crafted to enchant people, places,<BR>and things. This art allows them to charm beings and make<BR>them fight for their new master, or magically enhance the<BR>capabilities of a sword. They also have some skill in offensive<BR>spells, but are never as skilled as a Wizard.<P>We Enchant people well enough but the only Place Enchantment I know of is Sentinel and the only Thing Enchantment<BR>is the Enchant metal spells. That only helps a bit in making jewerly. I would like us to be able to enchant hides and bow<BR>staves as well for example to make us great at any of the crafts. Seen a Whittiling tool or Planing tool? We should<BR>have that for the other Trades (taht would help all not us) but someting like the Enchant metal spells for other<BR>components would be nifty. Something like the Alchemists skill for Enchanting would go a long way to making us stand<BR>out from the other buffers.<BR>However the line about enhance the capabilities of a sword should either be removed or given to us. I did not become<BR>an Enchanter for power.<BR>I became an Enchanter because it looked like I could make things (same reason for a gnome) and enchanting places<BR>sounded neat as well.I liked the illusion options and enduring breath, leviate, invis and See invis as well as serpent<BR>sight for travel. Of course a Druid gets all of those, better buffs, better travel spells and better combat spells and<BR>melee.<BR>A Shaman gets almost all of that as well and even more offensive and buff ability. They also get (broken now) the<BR>Alchemy skill to make potions with.<BR>We are better socially with the Illusions (though Shamans get a CHA buff as well) but it was the promise of making<BR>neat toys that got me into this class.<BR>We have to be viable in combat (I feel we are though would like the Dextrous Aura at 4th and Feet Like Cat at 8th to<BR>attract parties more at those levels) but we need a bit more enouragment to attract parites, especially before level 12.<BR>Even then I would like to be something other then a "Johny One Spell" (or I would have played a Wizard) and making<BR>things and encahnting places is on the list and promised.<BR>I am not talking about powerful enchantments either.<BR>Those would be nice as quests such as with an Enchanting skill and an Enchanting Kit that we used like a Trade skill<BR>with REALLY expensive and rare components.<BR>However the thing that we should get is temp enchantments such as reduced delay or increased damage hit bonus<BR>with a weapon. Most of the Priest buffs (Shaman, Druid and Cleric) would be fine if we had to cast them on an item as<BR>they last a reasonable amount of time. Would not be too bad if they even required a cheap reagent as well (as long as<BR>it was stackable and the same for all the temp enchantments). Ours would not be as good as the others since tehy<BR>cost money and we ahve to go through the Trade screen. However if we had greater versatility it would be a good<BR>trade off.<BR>At least this is my opinion...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>What Enchanters Do Best, and other txt <BR>by Azeraphel of Solusek Ro <BR>                                                                            posted 5/20/99 9:13:48 PM <P><BR>I posed the question to GZ that has been posed before; what is it that makes enchanters valuable? What makes<BR>us worthwhile? And he actually gave an answer that makes a bit of sense.<P>Me:<BR>I guess my real question is, what is it an enchanter is meant to be to a party? Why would a party want an<BR>enchanter, as opposed to any other class? Wizards burn much better, mages have much better pets, necros<BR>have much better DoT, clerics and shamans have much better buffs. We seem to be the "do just about<BR>everything, but poorly" class.<P>GZ:<BR>Best speed up attacks (warriors will love you), slow down monster attacks, whirl, mesmerize, AOE mesmerize,<BR>Charm, lull, soothe, etc.<P>So, it seems to be all about combat pace and crowd control. If you think about it, it's a fairly valuable function. I<BR>don't think it's what we all figured the class would be about, but it's a decent answer.<P>We do have the only haste/slow combination, to my knowledge. This tactic doesn't become available until level<BR>16, however. That's a long, long ways to go for the newbie enchanter, though... a class that doesn't come into its<BR>own until level 16 is a tough class indeed.<P>He also talked about resist rates. All enchanter combat spells fall under the all-or-nothing 65% success<BR>category, with a few exceptions. (Mem Blur) Damage spells generally have an 80% chance of success. Necro<BR>DoT falls under the 80% category as well, while ours does not. Tashan, according to GZ, lowers that resist rate<BR>by about 15%; later installments of the spell do even more.<P>Effectively, on a Tashaned creature, we have the same success rates on all of our spells as other casters do on<BR>their DD. This does mean, however, that Tashan is not really optional, if we want to be effective.<P>Anyway, GZ has more or less made a believer out of me. I'm sticking with the class, problematic though it is.<P>Though, if he gimps another one of our spells, I'm driving to california with a baseball bat.<P>- Az</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>This is a good rant from Eqvault <BR>by Buddan, gnoll puppy enchanter LONG <BR>                                                                            posted 5/20/99 9:30:24 PM <P><BR>This pretty much sums up the speed up slow down explanation...and then some.<P>Verant's Complete Contempt for Players (long)<P>Posted by Franko on May 20, 1999 at 14:10:19:<P>(adsl-216-101-109-180.dsl.snfc21.pacbell.net - 216.101.109.180)<P>Sorry folks but after last nights in game potshot at enchanters by Brad I had to post. I am utterly appalled by the<BR>lack of respect Verant has shown<BR>for players and the contempt Brad is treating us with. I guess he is utterly uninformed about gameplay issues,<BR>knows something we don’t (maybe we<BR>just have to wait for the expansion pack to get all those fixes we need?), or he is just a jerk. I have a few points I<BR>wish to make, mostly about my<BR>beloved enchanter class, but some about magic user issues in general. <P>A little about my qualifications, I have played an enchanter to level 24 (this puts me into the top 15 or 20 on<BR>Xegony and within the top 50 players<BR>across all servers). I also have played a bard to 14 and a druid to 5. I have played constantly since release<BR>because I am a student. I also was a beta<BR>tester.<P>First the magic user issues (so if you don’t want to read the rest of my post you can skip it). This game shipped<BR>in a definitely pre-release form.<BR>Research was broken from the get go and so was specialization. How many of you know people who were able<BR>to hit level 16 and buy<BR>specialization skills in all areas (this was removed a short while ago), I had a friend who dropped 40<BR>development points into these skills. Now I am<BR>sure these points will be lost once the skill is currently implemented. This is a definite loss and it could easily<BR>have been prevented by doing at release<BR>what was done more than a month later. <P>Spell research, broken in the beginning and still buggy. While I have had some success with this skill many<BR>other’s have not been so fortunate. Ask<BR>any magician who wasted precious component only to be told, “oops we’ll fix that soon”. At this point you are out<BR>of materials that may have taken<BR>a month to get, guess you get to try again(fun fun fun). How about magician double jeopardy, first research the<BR>lower level spell that is a component<BR>for you next research spell (any thoughts on trying two or three research rolls in a row along with this games not<BR>so random, random number<BR>generator?)<P>Availability of components has always been a real problem. Just recently has the spawn rate on components<BR>been upped. This could account for the<BR>fact that I had found just 3 components during the pre-increase times. The biggest problem is the mobs you<BR>have to kill to get the components are<BR>too high level. How are you going to kill a level 35 mob to get components for a level 24 or 29 spell? This is<BR>especially a problem for magicians.<BR>Imagine trying to level missing both your arms and a leg, this is what they face. The fact that some players have<BR>done this is a testament to their skill<BR>and not to the general state of the class. No matter what, you are always going to have some truly exceptional<BR>players. The rest of any class can not<BR>be held to that same standard and told “well if X player did it there is nothing wrong”.<P>Now on to balancing issues. How is it that necros, druids, and shamans(quite probably the most underrated<BR>class in the game) are untouched by the<BR>mighty nerfing effort? I have had 3 friends level necros from birth to high teens and 20’s in less than a week (in<BR>one case 12 to 17 in 7 hours). When<BR>considering necros I just need to think of the great sand giant hunt (6 players 20 to 16 taking out mobs a group<BR>10 levels higher would think twice<BR>about). The reason enchanters whirl was gimped was that it allowed groups to kill mobs with impunity, sounds<BR>sort like kiting as employed by druids<BR>and shaman, does it not? Yet we have seen that the real priorities lie in toning down that really easy to play and<BR>fast to level enchanter class.<P>Finally, the enchanter portion of my posting. Last night Brad posted that we “we should take our supposedly<BR>underpowered enchanters to Mistmore<BR>and make good use of our “really really effective endure magic spell””. Well I guess he knows something we all<BR>don’t. Shaman and clerics get that<BR>same spell. Guess who any smart player would rather have in their party? Why have an unreliable and<BR>underpowered enchanter in your party in a<BR>very dangerous dungeon when you can get the same effect and have a real powerhouse (Cleric or Shaman not<BR>as good as an Enchanter in<BR>Mistmore?, naaah couldn’t be). From this comment and the analysis that follows I conclude that either Brad and<BR>Verant is uninformed or simply<BR>thinks that enchanters are “good enough”.<P>NOTE (If you don’t want to read my Enchanter analysis skip to the bottom now)<P>What enchanters can do;<P>1) Direct Damage: very weak. The level 24 enchanter spell does 142 damage and at a cost of 100 manna. This<BR>is by far better than the level 16<BR>spell which does 94 points for 80 manna. All enchanter DD spells are dual action damage + stun. This makes<BR>the resistance rate much higher. In<BR>addition the promised “2 second stun” has a really negligible effect and now breaks our best spell (whirl).<BR>Wizards, Magicians, Necros, (probably<BR>Druids, Clerics, and Shaman too) all have better DD. Thus an Enchanter can not do any kind of DD.<BR>2) DOT: very weak, Choke does 90 damage over 35 sec for 50 manna. This is the level 12 spell and it does not<BR>get upgraded till 29. As a note<BR>Enchanters may not stack their dots only one at a time. Necro, Shaman, and Druid all get better and more<BR>manna efficient dots.
