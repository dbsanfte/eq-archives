The cancel magic spell is useful for dispelling harmful spells cast on
group members. However it will cancel the first icon displayed.&nbsp; If
your party members have many buffs, leave the first icon "slot" open for
harmful magic. You can do this by casting a minor buff followed by the
serious buffs. Then you can dispell the minor buff.&nbsp; (Submitted by

multiple items for an NPC involve him giving you a container in which to

are essentially free containers which you can get often right at level
1.</b>
<p><img SRC="wpn167.gif" height=32 width=32><b>For classes with the ability
to "sneak", when an NPC merchant regards you&nbsp; less then indifferently,
enable sneak before selling or buying from the merchant to get better prices.&nbsp;
(You'll know it's working when you /con the merchant and they are "indifferent"
to you).&nbsp; This also allows players who couldn't normally deal with
an NPC merchant (i.e. Aviak Merchant in South Karana) to buy and sell from
them.</b>
<p><img SRC="wpn167.gif" height=32 width=32><b>If you are going to duel
or go to an arena, be aware of a very serious problem, which may be a bug

weapon permanently.&nbsp; Thus, if you duel, I would suggest you and your
opponent agree to use cheap weapons and shields.&nbsp; Also, some are apparantly
using the skill while invisible to disarm unsuspecting players of their
weapons.&nbsp; See invisible is a good spell to cast before entering an
arena.</b>
<p><img SRC="wpn167.gif" height=32 width=32><b> [AllaKhazam's note:&nbsp;
I have note verified this personally].&nbsp; There is a joystick setup
wchich can work with Everquest. The trick is to buy one of the Gravis Line
of Joysticks that supports their "keyset manager" software. This package,
that comes with the joysticks, allows you to program the directional pad
as well as 10 programmable buttons on the joystick to emulate keyboard
functions. It works great in conjunction with placing commands in your
"hotbox" section in everquest. Hope this will Help some of you all out
there with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.&nbsp; The joysticks that work are:&nbsp;
Gravis Gamepad Pro, Gravis Blackhawk and Gravis Xterminator.&nbsp; I might
mention that the package requires you to associate it with an EXE extension
to know when to use the joystick. Be sure to associate this with eqgame.exe
and not the everquest.exe, or it won't work.&nbsp; (Submitted by Darque

<p><img SRC="wpn167.gif" height=32 width=32><b>/Autosplit and /split split
<u>coins</u>
evenly, not amounts.&nbsp; Thus if a party of three loots a corpse with
1 pp, 1 gp and 1 sp, the looter will get a platinum, another person will
get a gold and another person will get a silver.&nbsp; Big difference!&nbsp;
If you trust your party members and want to be completely egalitarian,
have one person go to the bank and start at zero loot, loot every monster
and split the money evenly with the party at the end of the day.&nbsp;
To be really frugal, make your treasurer the person with the highest charisma
and local faction and have him sell any extra items before the final accounting.&nbsp;

<p><img SRC="wpn167.gif" height=32 width=32><b>Ctrl-Left clicking on a
multiple stacked item in your inventory lets you quickly select one item.

<p><img SRC="wpn167.gif" height=32 width=32><b>When you start out, try
to learn and practice as many different weapon skills as possible.&nbsp;
It is much easier to practice a weapon skill at lower levels when you go
against weak monsters than later on against the killers.&nbsp; If you try
and learn a new weapon skill at higher levels, you will either die a lot
or be forced to use a lot of your practice points to bring it to a respectable
level.</b>
<p><img SRC="wpn167.gif" height=32 width=32><b>You can assign an inventory
slot to a hot button.&nbsp; This works great for magic items that have
a magic spell to cast, like the wall squad ring.&nbsp; Makes using such
items much faster in battle.&nbsp; (Submitted by MeleKahn)</b>
<p><img SRC="wpn167.gif" height=32 width=32><b>Program a social button
to say /corpse. If you ever have your body in a bad spot and are afraid
to go get it,&nbsp; hotkey that button. Then as you inch toward your body
trying hard not to awake the nasties who have spawned on your body, press
the hot key continually and your body will move toward you from a pretty
good distance. When it comes to you, run to a safe place all the way pressing
the hotkey and you will "drag" your corpse with you.&nbsp; This also works
good for underwater corpse recovery.&nbsp; Also, summoning a corpse (/corpse)
will not make invisibility drop, but looting it will. If you die in a dangerous
place (say the west side of oasis) you may want to find someone to cast
invisibility on you (caster and target must be in same group). You can
then hot key /corpse to drag your corpse to a safe place to get your gear
back. Added bonus, a corpse bouncing along the ground looks cool (anyone
without see invisibility will only see the corpse dragging).&nbsp; (Submitted
by Onyxx and Oglug)</b>
<p><img SRC="wpn167.gif" height=32 width=32><b>Here is a tip for maximizing
profits while hunting with a group:&nbsp; This will take a lot of trust,
so if you do not know your party members well do not do it.&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;
Get a lot of backpacks, sacks or chests and distribute them to all party
members.&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Have one person loot the corpse until he is full,
then the next person loots, and so on.&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Do not go sell until
everyone is full.&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; Have the person with the highest charisma
sell all the items at a shop that will give him/her the best prices (most
likely his/her home city).&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; Then split the gold between all
members as the party sees fit (we always do an even split).&nbsp; 6.&nbsp;
Now if there is an item that a person wants the party can have them buy
it and split the money between the group or the group can give it to the
person.&nbsp; This works very well with a group that hunts very often together.&nbsp;
We have employed this tactic to our advantage very often but everyone needs
to remember that people get dropped from the server.&nbsp; They will come
back with the stuff or your share of the gold(if they are honorable).&nbsp;

<p><img SRC="wpn167.gif" height=32 width=32><b>Use of small boats (By Tothis)&nbsp;
You get IN the boat and right click on it.&nbsp; You will get a message
that says "You have the helm" and your movement keys now control the boat.&nbsp;
Not only was I able to use this boat, but Rexan (my Dwarven friend) was
able to stand in the back of the boat and keep lookout as I paddled us
about.&nbsp; The advantage was that he could click on things and con them
while my view was pretty much limited to the direction I was rowing us.&nbsp;
Some notes on using the boats to travel about:</b>
<blockquote><b>1. The boats have a definate "front" and "back". If you
get in and take control while facing the wrong way your controls will be
reversed. Simplesolution, right click to give up control of the boat, turn
yourself around (do the hookey po..umm) and resume control of the boat
with anotherright click.</b>
<p><b>2. The boat is NOT zippy. This is NOT a shortcut. If you are tempted
to do what we did (Travel from one side ot the other) take a look at the
map link on this site for the Ocean of Tears (the first one is better).
EACH little square is 1000X1000. This map is HUGE. We went from 8000(near
the human Island) to -9000 (sisterhood's Island). The top speed of this
boat is about the same as if you were running. By comparison, the Butcher
Block Zone is about 6000X6000... and that's a pretty good sized zone. The
big boat travels MUCH faster...</b>
<p><b>3. No spells. Just like riding the big boat, something about these
romantic ocean canoe trips just stuns your spellcasting.</b>
<p><b>4. If you fall out most races can't get back on unless you try to
do so from dry land.&nbsp; (Humans seem to be able to get back on by going
to the long sides and swimming forward)&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, we have managed
to 'Lock' two boats together. Neither of us could move and had to swim
to shore (so don't get too close to each other if you are each in seperate
boats).</b>
<p><b>5. The boat has hit points. This leads to the disturbing idea that
it could be sunk.</b></blockquote>
<img SRC="wpn167.gif" height=32 width=32><b>As soon as you start your character,
go into options and reprogram your hotkeys to change auto attack from the
default "A" key to something you will never accidentally hit, such as "~".&nbsp;
This will prevent you from accidentally attacking a NPC you are talking
to because you forgot to hit the enter key to bring up the talk screen.</b>
<p><img SRC="wpn167.gif" height=32 width=32><b>If you hold down the numberlock
key you will continue to run forward without having to keep a hand on the
arrow key.&nbsp; This can free your hands to type messages to you group
and friends.&nbsp; Just keep an eye on where you are going.</b>
<p><img SRC="wpn167.gif" height=32 width=32><b>If you are new to a zone,
play close to the zone border while you ckeck out the monsters in the area.&nbsp;
This will give you a chance to run for cover if you get in over your head.</b>
<p><img SRC="wpn167.gif" height=32 width=32><b>You can keep track of the
people you enjoyed grouping with by adding them to your friends list.&nbsp;
Type /friend name to add or delete the person and then /who all friends
to see which friends are on line when you log back on.&nbsp; You can have
up to 25 people on your list. (/friend will tell you who is on the list).
This is a good way to remember names of people you liked and to develop
closer friendships.</b>
<p><img SRC="wpn167.gif" height=32 width=32><b>Program a social button
to say help and put it in your hotkeys.&nbsp; The split second it saves
you may make a difference in how quickly people react to you.</b>
<p><img SRC="wpn167.gif" height=32 width=32><b>It does you no good to /shout
for help.&nbsp; The zones are too big and everyone who sees it will assume
you are too far away.&nbsp; You are better off just typing help and hoping
that someone within hearing range will respond.&nbsp; If a person sees
a cry for help come up on his screen from nearby, he is much&nbsp; more
likely to try to lend aid.</b>

practice, practice.&nbsp; If you find yourself standing around waiting

<p><img SRC="wpn167.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" height=32 width=32 align=BOTTOM><b>Go
for swim.&nbsp; Build up your swimming skill before you get on a boat.

how to swim.</b>

action has a repercussion.&nbsp; Pay attention to the faction adjustments
you are given.&nbsp; When you go to a new area, try to kill things the
locals dislike to gain faction with them.&nbsp; You can readily build up
either good will or ill will with almost every action.&nbsp; Start killing
kobalds, and not only will every kobald in the area start to single you
out for attack, but all of the kobald’s allies will start to dislike you
as well.&nbsp; This is important, because the developers have seen fit
to include high level killer NPC’s in otherwise low level zones that will
run up and whack you if they start to dislike you (or sometimes just because
they can).&nbsp; Also, that kobald runt you have no problem smacking around
probably has bigger siblings who will knock your socks off when they see
you.</b>
<p><img SRC="wpn167.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" height=32 width=32 align=BOTTOM><b>Learn
which monsters give good gold, and which give good experience.&nbsp; It

<p><img SRC="wpn167.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" height=32 width=32 align=BOTTOM><b>Consult
with the maps section before starting into a new area.&nbsp; The cities

<p><img SRC="wpn167.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" height=32 width=32 align=BOTTOM><b>Please
use /ooc for out of character statements. Also try and limit the use of
/shout.&nbsp; It is a role playing game.&nbsp; This doesn't mean saying
thee and thou, but it does mean that your character shouldn't know or talk
about the real world, at least not on /shout.</b>

you sell to or buy from a shop keeper /con him.&nbsp; The more he likes
you the better the prices.&nbsp; An apprehensive shop keeper will quote
you bad prices just because he doesn't like the looks of you.&nbsp; There
can be a 15 to 20% difference in rates.&nbsp; If he isn't at least indifferent,
you should try and find another shop keeper to sell to.&nbsp; Attutudes
will vary even within a city.&nbsp; Buying and selling from the right person

<p><img SRC="wpn167.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" height=32 width=32 align=BOTTOM><b>Don't
play in one view.&nbsp; Get used to the other camera views and use them
when appropriate.&nbsp; Most peoople will prefer to stay in the first person
view most of the game.&nbsp; I know this is how I play.&nbsp; However,
when in a battle, you may want to switch to one of the wider views where
you can see what is happening all around you.&nbsp; The other views can
also help you scout the terrain around you for firends or foes.</b>

This mode is strictly for inventory and other temporary things.&nbsp; Program
all of your useful commands onto your hot keys (you have 36 of them after
all).&nbsp; Then hit F10 once to go to partial full screen mode.&nbsp;
You can move around and fight in this mode and still have access to all

should optimize your screen size by going to options and setting your screen

RECOVERY.&nbsp; This is from a post on EQ Vault by John Smedley:&nbsp;
"In a nutshell, the Corpse Recovery rules are as follows:&nbsp; Characters
All Levels: If you have no items on your corpse, it will dissapear within
3 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Characters Level 1-5: Corpse will dissapear within
30 minutes (real time) whether you are online or offline. Those of you
wondering why this rule is in place? - There would be WAY to many bodies
if we didn't do it this way.&nbsp; Characters Level 6 and above - Corpse
will dissapear within 24 hours if the player is online (being at the character
select screen STILL counts as online). Corpses will dissapear within 1
week if the player is offline."</b></blockquote>
