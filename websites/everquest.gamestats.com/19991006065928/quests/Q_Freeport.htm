Beur Tenlah stands in the tunnels not far from the tavern by the dock.&nbsp;
He is thirsty, but too lazy to go all the way up to the tavern for his
favorite dwarven brew.&nbsp; Go buy him a Dwarven Ale and you will gain
some experience, faction and his thanks, as well as a new quest from his
pal Harkin.&nbsp; Note: If you are an evil race the Ogre Paladin (How can
this class exist?) will kill anyone evil who walks into the bar to buy
the ale.&nbsp; So you need to buy it elsewhere before you go to Freeport.&nbsp;
This quest no longer raises faction with the Freeport Militia.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><a NAME="Corrupt Guards (F)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Corrupt Guards:</font>
The guards in Freeport are corrupt and the Paladin's Guild wants you to
do something about it.&nbsp; Kill the guards and return their&nbsp; helmets
to the paladin guildmaster one at a time for some decent money, experience
and a faction adjustment.&nbsp; Beware that this quest will make you very
unpopular among the guards as your faction will go up with the Knights
of Truth and down with the Freeport Militia.</b>
<p><a NAME="Deathfist Slashed Belts (F)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Deathfist
Slashed Belts:</font>&nbsp; There are 2 people who pay bounties on the
belts.&nbsp; One is Captain Hazran of the militia, and he is located on
the outside balcony of the militia HQ building.&nbsp; Giving him two belts
causes you to gain faction with the militia, and lose faction with the
paladin, warrior, and I think cleric guilds.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also bring
belts to Cain Darkmoor, who is located in the banquet room on the 2nd floor
of the warrior guildhall.&nbsp; He now&nbsp; wants two belts at a time.&nbsp;
When you give him two belts, you gain faction with the warriors and paladins,
and you lose it with the militia.&nbsp; You also get 2 - 10 gp and some
decent xp. Also, when you give Cain a belt, he'll thank and ask you for
help with his "bigger problem."&nbsp; Asking about this sends you to the
paladin guild where you learn about the Corrupt Guards quest.&nbsp; (Submitted

Masks in Neriak sends you to freeport to speak to the same dark elf who
spawns at night down by the docks. She gives you a mission to kill Lyda
Nasin, the daughter of the Owner of the Seafarers Roost. She spawns on
the second floor of the Seafarers in the morning, however Dark elves are
KOS if they enter the bar (with the new ability to move and stay hidden
perhaps the thieves can now complete this one...) In any case an easier
way to kill her is to hire someone to go upstairs and tell her that a ship
has docked. She will come outside to the pier where she can be killed.
You get faction, some cash, and a minor item. (Submitted by Feywin)</b>
<p><a NAME="Exotic Drinks (F)"></a><img SRC="iconupdated.gif" height=12 width=60><b><font color="#FF0000">Exotic
Drinks:</font>&nbsp; This quest is probably the best quest in the game
for a lower level magic user, especially an enchanter.&nbsp; In fact, with
the new changes, only an enchanter (or perhaps a very careful dark elf)
can really do the whole thing.&nbsp; It results in the Stein of Moggok,
a great magic item which gives +10 int, +5 dex, +10 hp, +25 disease resistance,
has two charges of healing and acts as a greater light source.&nbsp; The
items can be collected by just about anyone, but you need to to be an enchanter
to finish the quest.&nbsp; I know the quest works every time with a level
20 enchanter who has illusion ogre and benevolence.&nbsp; It also can work
in some instances with a level 12 enchanter who has illusion dark elf and
alliance.&nbsp; It is a lengthy quest, requiring you to go all over the
world to get items, but worth it.&nbsp; Clurg, the Ogre bartender in Ogguk,
has lost his bartender's compendium and wants it back badly.&nbsp; It is
currently held by Bartender Gregor, in Freeport.&nbsp; Fortunately, Gregor
has a lust for exotic drinks, and lacks only the ingredients to make his
dream concoctions.&nbsp; He will give you the compendium for those ingredients.&nbsp;
He wants you to get him the following items:&nbsp; (1) a Kiola Nut, which
can be purchased on the island of Erollisi for about 2 gp, (2) Erud's Tonic
[now a no drop lore item] (see Erudin quests, basically a quick purchase
and exchange), (3) Honey Jum from Rivervale (See Rivervale Quests - the
price is now 3 platinum) [note:&nbsp; You need an indifferent faction in
Rivervale for this one or you need to trust a halfling to get it for you.&nbsp;
If you can't find a trustworthy halfling, (I had the misfortune of initially
getting ripped off by a particularly nasty halfling named Mappas who believed
he could extort 5 pp for the honey jum after I gave him the items and a
promise of 5 gp to get it [back when it only cost 5 gp for the item]) you
can easily create one of your own and do the exchange since a level 1 can
easily do this part of the quest], and (4) a Koalindl Fish from the lake
in the Temple of Life in Qeynos [now a no drop lore item].&nbsp; This is
the hardest and most costly part of the quest.&nbsp; You will take a severe
faction hit with several good factions and with Rodcet Nife himself for
killing the fish, dropping several levels in faction, and you will get
attacked and killed when you leave the water unless you gate in time.&nbsp;
(There is also a paladin who will jump in and kill you in the water if
he is nearby).&nbsp; The fish do not drop a corpse every time, so you may
have to kill several fish, potentially making you kos with many clerics
afterwards.&nbsp; Also, they are a slow spawn and are currently being camped
quite a bit.&nbsp; I don't know if this will work, but it might be possible
for two people to do this with one creating a mule to kill the fish and
take the faction hit, while the enchanter who will complete the quests
loots it and gets the item.&nbsp;&nbsp; As another alternative, Frostbite
the Dog in WK sometimes drops a Koalindl fish if his master is not around,
but you lose some serious faction for this as well and one of the people
you lose faction with happens to spend a lot of time in Gregor's bar, making
it tough to complete the quest if you become kos with her.&nbsp; Although
the resulting drink sounds pretty foul to me, should you manage to gather
all of these ingredients he promises to give you his bartender's compendium.&nbsp;
The enchanter must give Gregor the ingredients.&nbsp; IMPORTANT.&nbsp;
You must now give them to him one at a time, or he will send you back to
collect the other three all over again!&nbsp; Gregor will then give him
3 to 4 pp and the bartender's compendium, which is a no drop item.&nbsp;
This has to be taken to Ogguk and given to Clurg the bartender there.&nbsp;
Be aware that even under an illusion some ogres might attack you, so it
might help to go invisible.&nbsp; Before giving it to Clurg, the enchanter
needs to cast illusion ogre and benevolence.&nbsp; Or as an alternative,
cast illusion dark elf and alliance (this lets it be done by a lower level
enchanter, but does not seem to work every time).&nbsp; If his or her faction
is not good enough, it won't work (I have had reports that indifferent
has worked for some people and not worked for others, but that is probably
the minimum he should con).&nbsp; Clurg will then give you the stein.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I would say, assuming you can get sow when needed, you can do this quest
in just about 3 hours (less if you have teleports).</b>
<p><a NAME="Frikniller Family"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Frikniller
Family:</font>&nbsp; If you ask Gren Frikniller, a bodyguard for the rogue
guildmaster in East Freeport, who his sister is, he will tell you that
it is Falia Frikniller, who is in North Freeport. He will give you a letter
to take to her. When you give this letter to Falia in North Freeport, she
will say thanks and give you a broken heirloom that she asks you to take
back to Gren.&nbsp; She also gives you some faction, a little experience
and a few coppers. When you give the heirloom to Gren, he just gives you
some faction and a little experience, since he says the heirloom isn't
worth anything anyways.&nbsp; The faction adjustments are as follows:&nbsp;
For giving the letter to Falia, Merchants of Rivervale, Deeppockets, Guardians
of the Vale and Mayor Gubbin go up, and Coalition of Tradesfolk III&nbsp;
goes down.&nbsp; For giving the heirloom to Gren, Coalition of Tradesfolk

your standing with the Dismal Rage and Opal Darkbriar and lower it with
the Knights of Truth. As a side note, it's interesting to see that Verant
has staged two totally opposite classes with opposing quests.&nbsp; You
can't kill him while he is in his shop in North Freeport, or his corpse
will disappear. Since he is a merchant at the time, he won't leave a corpse.&nbsp;

Inn.&nbsp; Apparently, someone is leaking information to the dark elves
concerning the city defenses.&nbsp; Your contact is on the second floor.&nbsp;
Tell her who sent you and she will give you some information and ask for
a glass of wine.&nbsp; Give her the wine and she will give you the key
phrase you must use with the innkeeper, something like I need mail for
the 2nd room.&nbsp; He will ask you to prove it is your room by showing
him the key.&nbsp; If you enter the middle room on the right on the second
floor you may see Shintl Lowbrow.&nbsp; If she is there, wait for her to
leave. She sometimes will pick up the key, in which case you have to kill
her to get it.&nbsp;&nbsp; If she isn't there, look on the floor at the
back left by the bureau for the key.&nbsp; Give the key to the innkeeper
and he will give you the mail.&nbsp; Take the mail to the person who gave
you the quest.&nbsp; She will tell you to take it to Toala, who is located
on the top floor of the arena.&nbsp;&nbsp; Toala will then tell you to
kill Shintl Lowbrow and her drow helper (who that is I don't know).&nbsp;
She will give you a box in which you put both heads and combine.&nbsp;

a rogue stole a pouch off&nbsp; her boat&nbsp; that has a voucher ticket
for a part she needs to complete a repair to the boat.&nbsp; Her bodyguard
gives you a description of the thief, which seems to match an NPC fisherman
named Brunar Rankin.&nbsp; Brunar will deny being the villain and killing
him does not get the pouch.&nbsp; If you stay with Brunar he eventually
goes up into the Seafarers Roost and gives his 'Catch" to Gregor the bartender.&nbsp;
If asked about Brunar, Gregor hints that he steals for him. Gregor says
he will put the catch down in the storeroom, which by the way leads down
to the Thieves guild.&nbsp; The pouch can be found between a box and a
crate in the storage room with the secret door to the thieves guild.&nbsp;
Take the pouch to Lenka and she says this and that about the stuff was
stolen&nbsp; and tells you that you can have the junk in the pouch.&nbsp;

Raltur Calikson in the shadowknights guild asks you to [serve] your Lord,

and ogres as pawns,so does the Dismal Rage (the shadowknight guild) use
the Freeport Militia.&nbsp; Raltur wants you to report to Sir Lucan D'Leer
himself (found in the main militia building by the western gates), and
tell him that you [are from the Shrine of Innoruuk]. You are instructed
to do whatever Sir Lucan asks, because after all, little favors lead to
large debts. Most importantly, if you find something important, you are
to bring it to him, not Sir Lucan.&nbsp; Talking to Sir Lucan reveals a
different attitude as he berates the Dismal Rage for being slow to send
an agent. He even threatens to have them broken up and jailed. Finally
he tells you that his guards have reported that there is a messenger from
Qeynos staying at an Inn on the western edge of the Commonlands. You are
to go and intercept this message. In fact you must kill Mojax Hikspin,
who is sitting on the south ridge of the lake in the western Commonlands.
He has the message that was meant for the Knights of Truth.&nbsp; It is
possible that there are two separate messages, which yeild different results
when returned.&nbsp; I am not certain of this though.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you
bring this message to Raltur Calikson in the Shadow Knights guild he will
give you a first level spell (other than faction and exp adjustment) and
he will give you another quest to kill the traitor (see traitor quest below).&nbsp;
I have also been told that you may get a quest to kill Lady Shae and recover
something called the Bayle List, but don't know the details of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><a NAME="The Painting"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">The Painting:</font>&nbsp;
(This quest may be broken)&nbsp;&nbsp; In Qeynos there is an Erudite Enchanter
that roams the docks. Her name is Danaria Hollin and she wants someone
to go to Freeport to pick up a painting from Palatos Kynarn.&nbsp; He is
in E. Freeport in a very seedy part of town.&nbsp; You hail him and tell
that Danaria sent you for the painting.&nbsp; He says you are waisting
your time and all he wants is Captain.&nbsp; Captain is a drink that you
buy from the vendor there.&nbsp; (Captain Jack?)&nbsp; After giving him
4 he tells you he needs a boat beacon mount.&nbsp; He tells you to go see
the gnomes about getting it.&nbsp; The Gnomes he refers to are the two
brothers Svinal and Lystyn Wyspin who run 'The Emporium' store next to
the bank in North Freeport.&nbsp; The gnomes will tell you basically you
will need good skill in Smithing (About 70+) and several items.&nbsp; Take
the Boat Beacon Mount, a Greater Lightstone, a Metal Disk, and a Copper
Band and combine them in a forge.&nbsp; The Metal Disk and Copper Band
are sold by the Gnomes.&nbsp; When combined you get a Boat Beacon (Lore
Item) which can go in the 2nd Melee slot to activate it.&nbsp; It is a
Lantern that casts light like a Greater Lightstone.&nbsp; If you take the
beacon back to Palatos, you gain a small amount of exp, faction and some
change.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he mentions that Lenka Stouthart, who is by
the docks in Freeport, has some interest in it.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you take
the beacon to her, she will give you the painting (no drop lore item).&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, returning the painting to Danaria just gets you a thank you, so
you obviously need to take it somewhere else (perhaps back to Erudin to
the enchanter's guild).&nbsp; I have no information beyond this point as
to whether this leads to anything good.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Submitted by

Theron Rolius, in the Hall of Truth, standing next to the paladin guildmaster
in the rear raised section, is the person who initiates this quest. He
asks you to meet a messenger named Mojax Hikspin "near a lake in the Commonlands".&nbsp;
When found in West Commonlands, he is usually sitting next to the fisherman
on the lake - the one that won't talk or sell to you.&nbsp; He needs a
flask of milk, which you can get from the office of the people or at Greenleaf's
in Freeport.&nbsp; As soon as you give him the milk, he starts to hand
you a note, but a fast NPC named Duggin Scumper comes by, insults the Freeport
king or something, and runs off, yelling that You'll never catch him, and
that he's taking this to his superior in the Quenos Royal hall or something.&nbsp;
In order to get the note, you have to attack the man, kill him (he's around
level 3 or 4) and loot his corpse to find the note.&nbsp; Then you return
the note to Eeyana Neastra, a sentry on the top level of the temple of
Marr (she may be in the Hall of Truth now).&nbsp; He is very tough to catch
without magic.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, sometimes if you stop chasing him and
return to Mojax, he will walk down the path to a pillar and drop the note
for you there.&nbsp; Each time you give Mojax milk, you restart the sequence
so that you can try again if you mis the first time.&nbsp; You get a little
gold, a item (sometimes a potion), experience, and increased faction standing
with the Knights of Truth.&nbsp; (Submitted by Saidan)</b>

Somewhere in the Ocean of Tears there is an undead island (rough loc of

a couple gargoyles, and four specters.&nbsp; There you will find stranded
a female paladin named Sentry Xyrin.&nbsp; She mentions that she was part
of a [boat disaster] and that she is from the temple of Marr in Freeport.&nbsp;
She will ask you to get her a [Potion of Marr] from Serna Tasknon is the
Temple of Marr in Freeport.&nbsp; With the potion she will be able to regain
her strength and take on the undead.&nbsp; (You can also initiate this
quest by first speaking to someone in the Temple of Marr, getting the potion,
and from that point on learning of Sentry Xyrinn's location and going to
look for her).&nbsp;&nbsp; You have to get the bottle from the Temple of
Marr and then bring the bottle to all the 8 guards in alphabetical order
(It does not tell you all the names so you must figure this out yourself).&nbsp;
It seems that if your faction is not high enough you can't get the bottle.&nbsp;
When you give it to the last person (not including Xyrinn) he will tell
you that she went to the Sisterhood of Erolisi.&nbsp; The sisters will
tell you she is either dead or stranded on a nearby island.&nbsp; Then
go to the island where she is stranded and give the bottle to her.&nbsp;

I am told this is now given to people after level 9.&nbsp; Because it is
an important Paladin quest, I have left in the various shortcuts people
have sent in so you can try various ways to get it done.&nbsp; This quest
is given by Merko, in the Hall of Truth. The first thing Merko asks you
for is to help Altunic Jartin in the E. Commons. Take him the letter, and
he will ask you to help him with a thief named Squire Narl.&nbsp; See the
Squire Narl quest in E Commonlands.&nbsp; (basically you need to buy him
a cloth tunic - you can do this after level 9 even if he doesn't ask for
it and still get the token).&nbsp; This will get you a token of generosity.&nbsp;
After you give him the token, Merko will ask you to get him a spider venom
sack.&nbsp; Give him one and you will get a token of bravery along with
some experience anf faction&nbsp; (again, even if he won't talk to you
after level 9, if you give him the venom sack he should still give you
the token). He will then tell you to give him both if you want to go further
on. Give him both tokens and he will ask you to take the test of truth,
which is killing the guard that appears in the sewers (again after level
9 he might not ask this, but the guard will still spawn). The guard is
actually a female militia spy. Kill her quickly or she will run to the
zone and be gone. If you kill her and take the token she has to Merko,
you will recive the Testimony of Truth Scroll, proclaiming you are a Knight
of Truth.&nbsp; This scroll is needed for the Soulfire quest, but is a
no drop item, so you will have to carry it around with you for quite a
while.&nbsp; Throughout this quest, you will recieve many good faction
hits for the Knights of Truth, and the Clerics of Erolissi and a lot of
negative hits for the militia. Most people are KOS to the militia after
killing the spy, so be aware of the consequenses of your actions.&nbsp;

This is the quest for the Paladin Sword <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics/Soulfire.htm">Soulfire</a></font>.&nbsp;
I have included the details of the beginning part that anyone can do, but
left out the names of the final NPC's you need to kill.&nbsp; Be aware
that you cannot complete this quest and get Soulfire unless you have a
party of adventurers well into their 40's.&nbsp; After completing the messenger
quest, you take the Zimel's Blades price list back to Kalatrina Plossen
in the Hall of Truth.&nbsp; She then transcribes a little of the note,
and determines that it seems to be some sort of price list.&nbsp; She then
sends you to speak with Rashinda (last name of Elore) at the Freeport Office
of the People, but tells you to report back to her what Rashinda tells
you has happened to Zimel's Blades.&nbsp; Once at the Office of the People,
Rashinda will spill her guts if she is asked, "Have you heard of Zimel's
Blades?".&nbsp; She then goes in to detail about the owner being [Ariska
Zimel], and that Zimel's Blades was condemned after Zimel's disappearance.&nbsp;
Zimel's Blades was a weapons shop in East Freeport which was condemned
by the city.&nbsp; She mentions that Groflah Steadirt bought most of the
scraps that were left of Zimel's Blades.&nbsp; Obviously the next question
is to ask Rashinda about Ariska Zimel (a simple "Who was Ariska Zimel?"
suffices).&nbsp; She then goes in to the fact that Ariska Zimel was an
extraordinary blacksmith who also was a great adventurer.&nbsp; She says
that he and Groflah Steadirt were best friends and adventured together
until each of them settled in Freeport.&nbsp; She then mentions Zimel's
disappearance again, and says that you should go speak to Groflah, because
he could give you more information about Zimel then she can.&nbsp; Somewhere
in this mess of conversation, after she mentions Zimel, and you ask her
about him, she mentions Steadirt again.&nbsp; This is the time to ask her
about Groflah Steadirt, and again, a simple "Who is Groflah Steadirt?"
will suffice. Okay, so now that you have all of this information, you're
supposed to return to Kalatrina Plossen at the Hall of Truth and tell her
that "Zimel's Blades was condemed".&nbsp; Where upon she wonders why Lucan
would visit a condemned building.&nbsp; She figures he must be searching
for something, and mentions that when she last visited the local forge
(must be Groflah's, but she doesn't say that) she heard rumors of Lucan
searching for a sword named Soulfire.&nbsp; She then says if that is true,
then you must find it first, as no more power must go Lucan's way.&nbsp;
She then say's "Seek this sword out."&nbsp; Don't give her the price list,
because she won't give it back and you need it to continue.&nbsp; The purpose
of the price list is to get Groflah to open up to you, instead of telling
you that he's never heard of Zimel's Blades and to go away, because he's
busy and can't speak there.&nbsp; His response after receiving the price
list is, and I quote:&nbsp; " Where did you find this?&nbsp; This was the
main price list of Zimel's Blades, but it should be all burnt up.&nbsp;
I was at Zimel's right after the fire and I did not see it hanging where
it should have been.&nbsp; The entire inside was gutted and.... Wait....
The sequence of the dots!!!&nbsp; Hmmm.&nbsp; I cannot talk with you here.&nbsp;
Meet me at the Seafarers by the docks at night.&nbsp; Give me the note
when next we meet."&nbsp; End quote.&nbsp; To get Groflah to talk you have
to be in a certain tavern in East Freeport around 5 or 6am.&nbsp; He will
appear and wag his tongue freely (presumably from the liquor).&nbsp; He'll
tell you about Tumpy Tonics (apparently all dwarves are lushes) and will
talk about Zimel, relating the story about what it was that Zimel found,
why he disappeared and who the culprit is.&nbsp; You must then talk to
the beggar Tykar Renlin, who shows up at the Seafarer's roost. You need
to give him 4 droms champagnes, one at a time, to get him to talk.&nbsp;&nbsp;
He will talk to you and give you a blanket.&nbsp; It turns out that Zimel
is being held prisoner down below the arena (I think it may be cell block
number 4).&nbsp; When you talk to Zimel, he says something that ends with
"bog n goo".&nbsp; When you give him edible goo (from cooking), he then
says " bog n goo.&nbsp; Blanket too!"&nbsp; What you need to do is give
him edible goo, bog juice, and the blanket.&nbsp; Bog juice can be made
by a brewer.&nbsp; After giving him the bog juice and goo, you will receive
a banker's key "H.K. 102" for High Keep. You need to give this to the bank
clerk in highhold and she will give you a note to deliver to Brother Hayle
in Splitpaw.&nbsp; He will tell you the items you need to collect to get
soulfire:&nbsp; The Hilt of Soulfire, the Brilliant Sword of Faith, Your
Testimony and the letter you received from the bank clerk.&nbsp; The hilt
and sword are obtained from killing high level NPC's (who shall remain
nameless here, but Hayle gives you the clues you need to track them down),
and the testimony is obtained through a side quest which is listed elsewhere
on this site.&nbsp;&nbsp; (There have been far too many contributors to
this quest information to name them individually - thank you all)</b>
