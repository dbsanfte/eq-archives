the bug list is only for major bugs which can cause more than just an annoyance

and maybe tell you how to avoid it.&nbsp; I have not posted many of the
minor bugs reported to me, or the list would just get too unwieldy.&nbsp;
I also will not post anything that can be exploited.&nbsp; Doriath sent
me an e-mail on names that most people might not realize.&nbsp; Apparantly
if you claim a name on one server, it cannot be used on any other server.&nbsp;
I know this was not true when the game first was released, since I claimed
AllaKhazam on most of the original servers, but he tested it out and says
that it seems to be how it works now.</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000066">A note on the bugs page.&nbsp; I got lots of
responses on that. *groan*.&nbsp; It is not my intention to collect a list
of every bug in the game or to start some drive to get certain ones fixed.&nbsp;
I seriously doubt that anyone of importance at Verant ever visits this
site, and they should have a bigger and better list anyways (you did submit
all those as /bugs didn't you?).&nbsp; Moreover, I assume (at least hope)
that they are working diligently to fix those bugs that do exist.&nbsp;
Nor is it to post exploits.&nbsp; The purpose of my list is to allow the
visitors here to share with each other information about serious problems
to avoid or beware of that are not supposed to be part of the game and
can really affect your enjoyment and gameplay.&nbsp; The following sections

<p><b><font color="#000066">For those of you who haven't noticed, Everevent
has not been updated in a while.&nbsp; It is currently in the process of
being revamped and reopened by a new webmaster.&nbsp; I have taken the
link out for now and will announce when it is up and running again.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Also, I'm not sure everyone realized that there is a search engine for
the site which will let you search all of the information found on the
site using key words.&nbsp; I moved the link up to the top of the index
frame so that it is more prominent.&nbsp; Finally, I was given a link to
a CGI program that is really cool.&nbsp; It is called </font><a href="http://jeffs.hardwarecentral.com/cgi-bin/eqstats.cgi">Jeff's
Everquest Log File CGI Parser</a> <font color="#000066">and it uses the
new /log feature to break down your log file and tell you how your day
went, including how many hits and misses you had, what you fought, how
much you gained and lost, your faction changes, and a lot more.&nbsp; I
thought it was pretty impressive.&nbsp; Go check it out.</font></b>

in a full description of the <a href="quests/Q_Everf.htm#Tarton's Wheel">Ice
Comet Quest</a> in Everfrost.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to add a new section
listing the known bugs in the game so that people can be aware of things
that they shouldn't do or should be on the alert for, like dropping lore
items, trading lore items in a container, disarming people in a duel, etc.&nbsp;
Obviously, Verant should really keep such a list, since theirs would be
a lot more accurate and updated than any I can put together, but until
they do, I will post one.&nbsp; Please e-mail bugs (not exploits) you know
about so that I can include them in the list.&nbsp; The following sections

I have seen so far sounds interesting.&nbsp; Basically a whole new continent
about twice the size of Faydwer will be available.&nbsp; It will be the
home of a new race of evil lizard people and a small High Elf village.&nbsp;
Except for the Iskar newbie area, the zones are supposed to be for levels
20 and higher.&nbsp; It will supposedly be reached by boat, probably leaving
the Oasis of Marr, and will only be able to be accessed by those who buy
the expansion.&nbsp; Items brought back will supposedly be able to be used
by anyone.&nbsp; The level cap will probably be raised and the graphics
in the new continent are supposed to be of a higher quality.&nbsp; A couple
of people told me they saw the demo at gencon and were very impressed with
the new graphics.&nbsp; If anyone was at gencon and knows more about the
new continent and zones, please e-mail me about it.&nbsp; I would like

of the quest items are now no drop and no trade.&nbsp; This means you can't
give them to someone with a higher faction to complete the quest, and you

I personally don't think it's a bad move to force you to complete the quest
yourself.&nbsp; This is why faction was added to the game.&nbsp; I do think
they should make no drop items bankable so that you can at least store
them until you are able to use them.&nbsp; Monks and magic users, being
somewhat limited in their carrying weight will have a much tougher time
completing quests now.&nbsp; The irony is that Verant, which has professed
a disdain for spoiler sites like this one, has made this site and others

either have to quickly figure out what to do with it or else destroy it.</font></b>
