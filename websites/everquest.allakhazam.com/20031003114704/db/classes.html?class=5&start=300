If you look at my profile, you'll see there's still a *LOT* of room for improvement, but plat is still a serious issue, so it's moving along a little piece at a time.  Any quick and easy recommendations would be appreciated.<br><br>Having upgraded to the Velium Short Blade (at 250pp) as recommended, I can say that this is an astounding improvement, and between it and Vamp Embrace I am now a proc'ing machine during melee.  Ah, fun!  I would highly recommend this for the mid-level character working his way up in the world.  A pity it's lore; I'd love to see a Ranger or Warrior dual-wielding these things, though there's enough other weapons that proc the same effect that it wouldn't be too difficult.<br><br>Anyway, onto my inquiries:<br><br>First question:  is 30 too low to be working on Darkforge?  Supposedly, it should be fine, and I do not think I will be doing all of the work alone, however, I'd rather not walk into some terribly unpleasant situation.<br><br>Second question:  is Wave of Enfeeblement worth using?  I can't see a dramatic improvement with it, and am not certain if it's worth having scribed.  And how about Scream of Pain?  I haven't been able to sufficiently grade the use of these yet, and wanted soome outside opinions.<br><br>Again, thank you for your help; I appreciate the dialogue and opinions on this board, it's giving me a lot to work with.<br><br>Drom<br>30 Shadow Knight  -  Quellious<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Mon Jun 17 06:07:46 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

JUST REMEMBER TO GIVE FIRST PIECE TO FRIEND TO HOLD. ARMOR IS LORE. as you can guess i screwed up on that once ;) bracers by the way are not lore.<br><br>don't worry too much about trying to avoid HT. you will frustrate yourself. forget what you know about harmtouch. crusaders can cast it as a distance spell so the plan to pull and send pet in as i gets near doesn't usually work. if the crusader spawns solo at base of ramp you can send in pet but sometimes he'll hold HT just for you *shrug* always figure on taking 330 pts of dmg to open the fight. and don't send in pet against spawns at top of ramp, your pet will pull the damn gorillas in addition to the lizards and then all hell breaks loose.<br><br>you can zone to escape into the temple but be aware. you can get killed in there fast if somone if training from the other side. try and use feign instead - OHH AND REMEMBER FEIGN ONLY WORKS IF YOU TURN ATTACK OFF FIRST - THANK YOU NEPTUNIS &amp; LUNATIC<br><br>if a crusader spawns on top of one of the small temples and you have small group and want to pull there is one thing you can try but it is REALLY risky and i DO NOT RECOMMEND IT. you will get the whole temple, but here is once thing i did once that actually worked.<br><br>i cast fear on the crusader in question. if it sticks he'll run north up the middle of the island. feign immediately as the entire temple wants your head now. if you feign fast enough. the rest of the temple will go right back to their spawn points and forget about you before the fear even wears off. this often does not happen and fear wears off too soon. also sometimes you get hit before feign goes off which basically means your dead since you have 6 lizards beating on you. - LIKE I SAID RISKY.<br><br>anyway if you've gotten this far stand up and move a ways north and wait for crusader to return. if you are REALLY lucky. he'll be alone. usually he'll have picked up at least one add. sometimes a train in which case it's time to praactice those feigning skills again.<br><br>whatever you do - don't get frustrated. sometimes the spawn rate will absolutely stink. 3 hours no crusaders. sometimes you'll get 3 in 15 minutes. it's all about patience and dedication. this is a very attainable quest for patient people and the xp along the way is great.<br><br>the lizards also drop tons of fs weapons that sell well unless you're used to the money that your lvl 60 main has ;) . wish i had that problem.<br><br>if you run into questions post again. i'd love to help.<br><br>oh and yes the quests are mutliquestable as of 2 months ago. just make sure you are in a group and turn in the last piece. in my opinion the only piece that everyone seems to find rare is the breast plate. i only saw it drop once ever. this is debatable though. i've heard visor too and i saw that drop 4 or 5 times so *shrug* it's pretty darn close to random.<br><br>LAST TIP ALMOST FORGOT: lizards heal themselves like nobody's business - justicars and judicators especially. have to take out healers first and they have lot of mana. a bard sining manadrain really helps. don't get too frustrated by how hard it is to interrupt their casting just bash when you can and hack away, they do go OOM eventually. this is all the more reason to never pull more than 2 at a time.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Mon Jun 17 16:37:29 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

The drops are now outside the temple and you can get the decayed as drops from either :<br>    1. The crusaders which are random spawns on any of the pyramids drop at least one piece of decayed and up to 3. The pyramids i belive are on a 15min spawn timer. I soloed them recently as 52sk and the first pyramid respawned by the time i had taken down 2 more pyramids.<br>    2. Tbe lizard spiritualist which seems to be the replacement of the old ritualist as he has the spear and drops up to 3  decayed items but is not on a 2hr timer. he does not have a random spawn position however but his  ph is a slivered (or possibly silvered) tae ew observer or any of the normal lizzy types, eg. fanatic. To get to his spawn point just follow the river from either side of the temple staying on the same side as the temple and you will see a bit of ground going slightly up with a rock there. there should be 4 (i think) spawns there, one is behind the rock and the other 3 are visible as soon as u can see this area. this is much easier with a small group since there are not as many mobs and it may well be possible to solo it altho at 30 this may be difficult.<br>    as to wave of enfeeblement... it sux except for pulling and weakening multiple mobs as Neptunis says..i dont mem this as its very rarely useful. Scream of pain stacks with shadow vortex and also shroud of hate (which are lvl39spells) altho shroud of hate is an atk buff. scream of pain and shadow vortex together are very nice as they lower ur opponents ac by around 25( not sure havent time to check it..) and buff urs which is sweet in pvp and if you are the main tank in a group, however scream of pain takes a lot of mana, i think its 100 which with shadow vortex and shroud of hate totals to 200 which is a hell of a lot for a hybrid..well im done good luck with darkforge :)</p>&nbsp;<br></td></td></tr>

So go and bring friends.  The MOBs have relocated so I'm not sure exactly where or how hard it is to get to the Crusaiders.<br><br>Wave of Enfeeblement is an AE so that's it's value.  If you have a group pulling multiple MOBs one caste weakens them all, but it does have a high resist rate and of course doesn't stack with the old spell.  I'd use it if you are fighting in a group pulling more than 1 at a time.  Scream of Pain is a buff, but at that level won't show a great improvement but every little bit helps.  It also helps with agro and has low mana.  Buy it and use it.  Tactic for those 2 spells:  On Mezzed MOBs, first tell everyone YOU and ONLY YOU will break mez, then taunt, caste Scream of Pain, taunt, caste wave of enfeeblement, taunt, slash and you will get hit as long as the Chanter isn't sitting.  You should use your debuffs like this all the time to build hate before breaking mez.<br><br>Sounds like your on your way now though, keep at it.  And as you upgrade look for things like the Bloodstained Mantle which I kept a s resistance gear into my 50's, Drakehide Belt (5AC +3 DEX +10 sv magic) which has a focus effect and is also great resist gear into the 50's.  There are some good cheap items out there that will last you a long time if you just keep your eyes open for them.<br><br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 55 DE Revenant</p>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 62 DE Gravelord<br>Have Axe, will travel</td></td></tr>

You cannot let the warrior do this.  All you really have to do is pop your DoT's on him, not engulfing unless your sure his MR is like 25 (we know how easily that gets resisted), and shadow step when he gets near.  Joust with him a little and anytime you get low on health, just shadow step and tap, shadow step and tap.  Re apply DoT's as needed.  This class will probably eat all your mana.<br><br>Rangers:  As for this very pathetic class, pretty much all you have to do is resist snare and your fightin a warrior with a DD (which sucks ass).  As for the bow, if it looks like he is gonna use it, stand behind a tree and tap him.  Arrows cant go through trees, but spells can. This is pretty much a warrior. forgot something, if the ranger does snare you and put his @#%^ty DoT's on you, use your cancel magic, he has low level spells, should only take 1 or 2 casts to get rid of either of the above.<br><br>Wizards:  I really have no idea, they always kill me.  Id assume just high resists does the trick.  Probably surprising  them helps too but really, i only have 1.7k HP and they nuke me for 700-1k.  Maybe someone can help me out on this one.<br><br>Mages:  This class is pretty easy as well.  Now I've never fought a mage with the epic pet but i have fought them.  You can do one of two things, you can  either fear the pet and watch him run off get agros, if your in an agro zone, or, darkness the pet and hope the mage is dumb enough to run after you, leaving the pet far behind.  Usually, as you play a class you get smarter, so the snare method wont work as often on high levels.  The fear way works great, except that mages get a fearless pet buff.  just try to find a way to separate the mage and his pet, find some @#%^ed up pathing in the zone and take advantage of it.  As for his nukes, if he doesnt have a pet, he should run out of mana before he can kill you if you have enough HP.  Remember, resists always help.<br><br>NecromANCER:  This is how I almost beat a necro 2 levels above me.  Get as far away as possible to still be able to cast spells. Just throw your DoT's on him and stay out of spell casting range so he cant tap you or DoT you.  Re apply DoT's as necessary.  As for the pet, spook the dead or just snare him like the mage pet.  Keeping a pumice stone on you always helps cuz if you get DoTed, you die pretty much.<br><br>Enchanters:  High levels these guys are bitches and this is another class that i dont know how to beat.  They lower my STR by 130, make my MR 23, and with my STR at 20, i cant move, so im good as dead.  At lower levels though, be sure to have yourself DoTed with disease cloud, as long as your DoTed you cant be mezzed. Pet just fear.  Need some help here with 50+ enchanters.<br><br>Paladins:  if you spotted a paladin, dont start the fight with a sword whack or anything, first use cancel magic to get rid of his buffs, and than you can run in their swingin your sword.  Thing is, your gonna have to go toe-to-toe against pallies, just remember to tap often to keep your health up and dont let them get away, otherwise they heal themselves and come back with full health.  MR helps to resist their stuns, which is a good thing, cuz they can keep you stunned for up to 18 seconds.  As for LoH, many paladins wait too long to use it, so you have to wait till just the right time to use your HT so that it should kill them, but they have enough health where they werent expecting it.  Hope you have HIGH STA cuz these guys can take a long ass time to kill.<br><br>Rogues:  A pretty bad pvp class if you dont surprise anyone,  just dont let them get their BS off and you will be fine.  with their low HP's just keep them DoTed and joust with them, they go down very quick.  Also be sure to have see invis up.<br><br>Monks:  Another bad pvp class, this is like an uber damage warrior, so just shadow step away, apply DoTs, joust a few rounds, and tap when you get one bub below full.  Not much to beatin this class cuz not much to them.<br><br>Shadow Knights:  Hopefully you wont have to fight the best PVP class in the game, but if you do, all you can do is hope your gear is better and you must out-think him.  Be sure to keep cancel magic up to cancel darkness if he lands it, but i cant say much about these guys, so maybe someone could help me out.<br><br>Druids:  these guys are up there on the pvp ranks, so your gonna have to think more than you did against the ranger.  Good things is, their DoT's are magic based so keep cancel magic up to remove those and any snares that land, if the druid cant land his DoT's or snare, that leaves his DD's only and without you bein snared, you should get some good whacks before they can get one off.  FR helps here. Also, if you can manage to snare a druid, any caster at that, you should win.<br><br>Shaman:  only ones ive fought have been 6-8 levels higher than me, so they usually win.  Maybe someone can help me out here, cuz i have no idea at all.<br><br>Cleric: truthfully, ive never fought a cleric in my life.  I always just think about its just gonna cost me all my mana, and all my STA, and he still wont be dead with those friggin heals of his.  besides, who fights clerics?<br><br>Beastlord: Probably like a mage, fear his pet, then pull the monk strategy i believe, I've never fought one of these because not to many are in rage of me.<br><br>Bard:  They are actually kinda hard.  Dont even try darkness line, unless its disease based, but put all DoT's that arent MAGIC on him.  If he starts running, DO NOT FOLLOW.  He will just start singing his gay song that hurts you and he doesnt need mana, so he can go on for hours till you die.  Just wait for him to come back, if he doesnt, talk @#%^, then he will come back.  Ive only killed one high level bard, that was because the rest ran.  This one tried to run but HT took him out before he could start haulin real ass.<br><br>Alright, hopefully this does it.  Please note that i am a level 48 Shadow Knight, so these are strategies for pre-50 classes.  Everyone i fight over 50 beats the @#%^ out of me.  Anyway, if someone could help me out with some of those classes that would help.  Also, this is on the server Vallon Zek, so i could be fightin any levels + or -8.  Also, this is pvp server, none of that blue server @#%^, so no one know when they are gettin attacked so you cant always be ready, in some cases, whoever gets first hit wins.  Whereas on blue servers, everyone has time to buff themselves and all that other bull yit, so strategies may change, like alot of cancel magic castings.<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Sun Jun 16 08:24:09 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Kildiar, The Shadow Knight Innoruuk Rejected<br><br><br><br>"Rangers suck, no argument there."</td></td></tr>

Though I usually do not duel people and I am not on a PVP server I know some ways to help.<br><br>Wizard: Like all casters they focus on INT and lack on resistances. If you get darkness and FEAR whack em from behind. I Dueled a 49 wizzie and he only had 800 HP or so. After a few whacks he was very low and I pretty much won, Thanks Cazic Thule fear lasted. Keep resisances high and never let your DOTs drop from em. You should get blasted by his first spell and take you to half HP but once fear and darkness are on your home free. Cancle Magic is always good to have memed.<br><br>Chanter: Never dueled one:)<br><br>Mages: I Disagree totally with you on mages being easy. If they have they're pets hasted your screwed trying to get your spells off. If it's any other pet besides fire you may have a chance. All I can say is keep resistances high.<br><br>SHAMEN: They are in my opinion the king of all PVP. I have a 46th shaman friend and he has beat me everytime. If your rooted your totally screwed. They blast you wiht DOTs and they're flash of light series is an SK nightmare. They're pet helps with your spell interuptions, but if you attack the pet your dead already while the shaman DOTs your ass. I have know clue how to beat them even wiht migh resistances Malise line of spells keeps em low. They have high AC and enough HP to not die as fast as casters. So GL!<br><br>Paladins/Warrior: They are quite funny esp. when they try and duel. They are the worst class I belive. They are good tanks and can deal melee damage as good as we can but, their damage spells are nothing DOT they dont get and pretty much the easyest class to beat along with warrior. Fear right off the bat. Sure they run fast but darkness em afterwards. If they resist cast in between their long delays. Pretty much fear, darkness ,DOT ,cancle magic their buffs, and whack away!<br><br>Monks: They are usually the class I come closest with at low HPs while dueling. Darkness DOTs/tap/Siphon strength/fear&nbsp;&nbsp;all that stuff will cripple a monk and in time you sal win!<br><br>Like I said I don't duel exept while selling in EC. But most classes are at the mercy to other as long at you faster than they are.<br><br> Rangers are great if they land snare. Same with Druid and Necros basically use your crap against ya haha.<br><br>Shadowknights are in the top three best soloers and keep showing them paladins how it's done!<br><br>Islude-&quot;From the south. Heh, The deep south.&quot;<br>(Overall good post Kildiar) </p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

 u dont get hit by it often and they drop like flies once u've got rid of those bastard buffs...stuns suck altho i think our lifetap and dot lines more than make up for it..life leech at 50 seriously kiks ass (2sec cast 280 lifetap..takes a lot of mana if u have low int tho (like me))<br>  sk ..well basically on a pvp server its not likely u'll both be at full hp full mana so whoever is if ur at roughly the same lvl should effectively win...ht is pretty much useless below 40 ..at 39 i hted myself and lost a whole one bubble of hp wow..but with the increase at 40+ against tanks its useful so just pray u have it up..<br>   against enchanters either have mental resists ( not something i have unfortunately) or hope u get enough time inbetween mezzes to seriously hurt em with ht and a high damage weapon since u wont get many hits in..if u start the fight as with all casters u pretty much win<br>  well thats me done, not sure why i bothered postin since im not all that confident on the matter but hey if this is useful to anyone then thats kool...constructive criticism would be appreciated cos as i realise sum of my tactics suk and yet this is still one long @$$ post</p>&nbsp;<br></td></td></tr>

You will seldom resist anything cast by a Red MOB, and should almost always resists the low green MOBs with the new coding. <br><br>No other Stat affects resists, not INT, WIS, CHA, nothing but saves.  The one area people often make this mistaken assumption that a high CHA will help prevent Charm and mez, but there is no proof to this.<br><br>Keep working on resists, you'll find it come naturally as you get the higher level armors anyway.  Most Planes Armors have alot of resists so dispite their low AC (relative to Velius Quest stuff) they are still useful.  And don't forget Poison resists, that will prevent the slows, and a Slow is worse in some cases than a root.<br><br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 55 DE Revenant</p>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 62 DE Gravelord<br>Have Axe, will travel</td></td></tr>

In other words, they can't hate you twice...  =)<br><br>Gnome, Human, &amp; ERU SKs are the ones truly suffering from being an SK--the other races are alrdy hated, so no big deal to me.<br><br>Additoinally, and perhaps, more humorous, is the philosophy I adopted.  I have many friends who worry a lot about faction--&quot;I CANT KILL THERE&quot; or &quot;I CANT KILL THAT&quot; are common things I hear and I chuckle all the time.<br><br>They are suffering from NOT being a dark race SK is the way that I like to look at it.  My philosophy---They hate me?  I HATE EM BACK!!  There is little to worry about killing when most hate you, so you can hunt anywhere &amp; kill most anything with a smile on your face.<br><br>Try putting together a Plane of Growth raid sometime (where armor the equivalent of Thurg armor drops, but you do NOT need to get any silly gems or turn them into anybody--you loot it, you put it on).  It seems that 1/2 the people you meet will NOT hunt there becuase they dont want to ruin Tunare/Gfay faction--ESPECIALLY the High-elf CLRs.<br><br>95% of the time, I could care less about faction.  Damaging CoV faction is really the ONLY time I have taken any measures from NOT killing a MOB (becuase I need to finish getting SS armor).<br><br>Moral of the message??  Enjoy playing a &quot;dark&quot; SK--they are hilarious &amp; you dont have to worry about a lot of other crap-ola that others do...<br><br>Lunatic</p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

All other classes I wouldnt recommend getting it--its a waste of $$ IMO becuase the skeleton illusion doesnt do anything for you since you are alrdy small.<br><br>On the server that I play on, it is extremely rare &amp; generally commands a high price.  NOTE--just becuase an item is RARE does NOT NECESSARILY MEAN that it should automatically command a high price, but that is another story...  =)<br><br>Anyways, EVEN for a ORG / TRL SK, I STILL would NOT recommend getting it, as SKs get Deadly Temptation (&quot;DT&quot;) at 58, which has a skelle illusion on it &amp; it regens mana (its similar to Call of Bones for a NEC).<br><br>So, if you get it, sell it for a furtune &amp; smile when you get DT.

Melee agro has 2 components, first is how often you hit, the second is how hard you hit.  Most Warriors/duel wielders go with the speed of hits for agro.  It's true that the more you hit the more agro you build, but that wouldn't account for our agro very often.  So the other thing I have seen is that how hard you hit is almost as big a factior in agro as how fast you swing.  I'm now using a 2hs most times and I swing alot slower than the Rangers/Warriors I fighting with, but when I get a really hard hit the MOB still turns and takes a swing at me for it.  So just avoid the old myth about &quot;a fine steel dagger will out taunt a MoSS&quot; it just ain't so.  I recommend you always go for the best ratio weapon not the fastest for agro.<br><br>Next, one of the biggest factors for agro is proximity to the MOB.  The person closest to the MOB has the best agro potential.  If you want to hold agro fight right on top of the MOB, so close you are almost inside it's model.  If you don't want agro fight as far away as you can hit the MOB.  Teach this to your friends you group with, it's a very important issue to learn.<br><br>Pets, first PETS ARE FIXED :).  The Pet agro on Mezzed MOBs works as advertized, in fact a pet can't even be made to break mez it gives a stupid &quot;sorry master I am unable to wake&quot; whatever MOB.  So USE YOUR PETS!  Leave pets taunting, if they get killed that's alot of hit points of damage you didn't have to take.  Pets will become your best friend again.<br><br>Spell agro, this is where you all feel ripped off.  Ok, first I can't speak for the new Luclin spells I never used them (the low level ones).  But what works for me now, tried in about 8 zones so far, is Shadow Vortex followed by Heart Flutter as needed.  I would recommend that the lower level SK's keep using Disease Cloud to taunt, it may be less effective but it still has some agro and it casts very fast with little mana use.  Also cast/bash/taunt all at once to get the best effect.  Timing on taunts sometimes makes all the difference.  Also so MOBs hate some spells more than others.  Some MOBs don't care if you snare them, others will never get pulled off the snarer, some hate disease still, while others hate the life taps more.  Try everything you have in a new zone and then stick with what works best.  But remember what didn't give you agro and use that when someone else is the Main tank so you don't pull away agro.<br><br>So this is what I've found works for me with taunting.  What works for the rest of you?<br><br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 55 DE Revenant</p>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 62 DE Gravelord<br>Have Axe, will travel</td></td></tr>

The number of hits doesnt automatically generate more taunt than the dmg you do.  I'm not aware of any mathematical model that can determine which is better, but I believe there is a close balance between the two &amp; you hit the nail on the head.  Perhaps its as simple as how much damage you are doing overall that generates the most hate (which would make the most sense).  <br><br>I also agree 100% as far as recommending RATIO over everything (I do the same all the time)--SKs get the best ratio weapons in the game, so you shoudl go for them like no tomorrow.  Seldom, if ever, should a SK EVER be wielding a lammy (that should be an OFFHAND ONLY weapon for a duel-wielder like WAR)<br><br>As far as spells, I use the exact same two (HF &amp; SV) when I need to keep agro.  Where I still have issues, a darkness or tap (UGH the casting time on some of them though) usually turns the tide in my favor for holding agro, but that isnt too common.   Torrent of Hate, Pain &amp; Fatigue ALL do NOT generate a lot of hate, so I seldom rely on those to generate hate.  I also havent tried too many of the lower lvl SKs spells for taunt (never had to before--perhaps I will try some of them now)<br><br>As far as proximity, I have NOT had the success that you have apparantely had with agro.  I notice that closer defenitely helps, but its the spells that really make the difference over proximity, but perhaps that is just me.<br><br>I SO PREFER the OLD disease based agro rules than the new ones though.  Pre-agro-nerf, I dont think any class could even come CLOSE to outtaunting an SK.  Now, the game is FAR more challenging.  Is that fun to be more challenging?  Some may argue yes.  As for me, I say NO! because I thought it was fun as hell to cast something as feeble as Disease Cloud from across the room &amp; have the mob turn &amp; run at you....<br><br>Lunatic</p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

This same trend continues past 55 also.<br><br>Again, I have no idea how to quantify it, but I think that level also plays a role....<br><br>Lunatic</p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

To lose agro take away one or more of those factors eg not use spells that induce agro, use slower weapons, use proximity/position, side or back of the mob the furthest away I can get and still hit.<br><br></p>&nbsp;<br>Cannis 65th Ranger<br></td></td></tr>

Also if you taunt on the way back you would boost yourself higher on the Hate list, as will having a dot work on them during the run to your group.  But if you are puller and not Main Tank it's best to FD once you get to the group anyway to dump all agro and let the Tank establish his agro.<br><br>Neptunis</p>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 62 DE Gravelord<br>Have Axe, will travel</td></td></tr>

I'm still doing upgrades to AC and stats with armor and other equipment, but this seems more important at the moment in order for me to be able to contribute in groups.  What would a level 25 SK on a budget do to upgrade his weapon from here, be it quest-items or just saving my pennies?<br><br>My second question seems to go along with the first.

(not that i'm all that high these days)<br><br>i particularly remember in my teens and 20's that i had a VERY hard time getting aggro from higher lvl characters. in my 30's this has been less of an issue. not sure why that is but wihtout changing much about my tactics , getting aggro became easier in the 30's. <br><br>one other point on that though. remember that taking aggro should be done by an sk only when you need to move a mob or get attention of a caster or backstabber. if you have a well balanced group you will likely have a warrior or pally who i would let take the damage personally ;)<br><br>btw - i'm not saying you are doing anything wrong just a suggestion as lately i've noticed (in many OT groups i've been in) that getting aggro has become somewhat of a contest. maybe folks are concerned about raising defense skills?? not sure. but as long as you can get aggro off of casters in a pinch that's prolly most important. oh and if you are grouped with a bard and can't get aggro off him. don't sweat it - i can't a good half the time at least too ;). damn aggro pigs. sheesh put down one of those weapons or something.</p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

For a really nice taunting weapon get a Velium Short Blade 10/24 proc's velium shards (12dd cold based).  It's fast, hits hard, well kind of hard, and the proc will help them hate you.  The sword starts procing at lvl 25 btw.  It's also dirt cheap, actually cheaper than the Centi Shortsword at about 200-250pp.  The Stallag Terrorspine Spear is another really good taunter but is piercing and sells for about 300pp.  <br><br>I REALLY hate the FBSS, the AC is just horrible.  For Haste I'd look for Lesser or Greater Guards of Haste (Haste Shoulders) or Chromaitic Boots.  All 3 are the same Haste or close to the FBSS abd give AC.  Chromatic boots are 10AC with INT, the Shoulders are 5 and 10 AC respectively (and magic for bash) with more stats, the lesser is have the other stats or the greater.  Prices for these are not stable as they are rare but not that great for the lvl 40's who can farm them, but the shoulders are cheaper than the FBSS (maybe 500-1k), boots are a little more as they add 4 Wisdom so Pali's and poor Clerics like them alot (up to 4k).<br><br>If you are on a budget the last thing I would buy is a FBSS.  Any other waste item will give you more bag for the buck.  Any of these:  Centi Short Sword, Velium Short Blade, CSS (Crystalline Short Sword), Stallag Terrorspine Spear or even a Sword of Skyfire which is cheap now will give you good damage and great agro.<br><br>Good luck in the quest for better stuff.<br><br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 55 DE Revenant</p>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 62 DE Gravelord<br>Have Axe, will travel</td></td></tr>

I also usually waited to nearly full mana between kites, unless I was absolutely certain I could kill a MOB.  Starting a kite at less than full mana takes more guts than I have most days.  But there have been times/locations where I could kill 2 MOBs before medding, the Giant Fort in Warslick Woods was one example.<br><br>As for spells, I used to believe as you do about using only damaging spells for soloing, I believed it till this last weekend.  This weekend I was soloing light blues while waiting for my Guild to arrive for a Raid, I had alot of time and decided to experiment.  I started using Boil Blood, Engulfing Darkness and Heart Flutter but ended up each fight (just tanking, couldn't fear there) OOM and down a bubble to a bubble and a half of life.  I decided to try a couple of debuffs and was amaized at the difference.  I used Shroud of Pain, Shroud of Hate, Torrent of Hate and Heart Flutter (which also debuffs ATK rating).  I found I could end each fight full life and with at least a bubble of mana, often 2 bubbles.  By using these spells I was adding 74 to attack rating plus some AC too, and taking the same from the MOB.  I was hitting more often and for slightly more, while getting hit for slightly less.  I will need to do more experimentation but I think debuffs may be more useful than dots in some situations.<br><br>For fear-kiting 2hs is considered the best option as the damage output is greater.  But it really comes down to the relative quality of your weapons.  The difference in using an Ebon Mace (19/24) or a Dark Reaver, the Ebon Mace clearly wins, but if you had a Strength of Grodan (41/51) then 2hs would be the way to go.<br><br>As for conserving mana, the best option is to never have the MOB turn on you, always keeping it feared before fear runs out (saves on lifetaps).  But since this isn't always possible I would often run away from the MOB, bringing it back to a start point for the fear track before I re feared to make sure I knew exactly where the MOB would run.  Also it allowed me an uninterupted cast while the MOB was still running towards me.<br><br>But it sounds like your doing most things about as good as anyone does them.  A Moonstone ring might be a worthwhile investment now to increase the range you can start casting fear.  Just keep looking for that perfect fear track and use a pet whenever it doesn't cause adds.<br><br>neptunis<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed Jun 12 17:48:30 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 62 DE Gravelord<br>Have Axe, will travel</td></td></tr>

Keep doing what you are doing with your FBSS that works out great if you have the haste.<br><br>4. This was situational, I found that most of the times I would typically hit for less damage with my 2hs than I did while I was in group due to the mob moving erratically.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other times when the mob would move in straight lines my 2hs was the best weapon.<br><br>5. I must have had better luck than you because I found rhinos and tigresses the easiest to solo. Tigers and sarnak knights were a waste to me. Rhinos btw give the most experience of the mobs in OT, I watched my experience bar as I solo'd with my ranger and sk, the Rhinos on average gave me more experience per kill than any other mob.  Kill what works best for you, it does no good for you to fight the same mobs as I did if you have more downtime than you would fighting mobs you are use to. <br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Jun  4 18:04:49 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Cannis 65th Ranger<br></td></td></tr>

Ok first how much mana does the SK pet use and how long does he last?  Usually he took about 1 bubble of mana (almost every level pet) and lasted over an hour to all day depending on how well I was doing that day.  Now, how much damage does he do, hits for 20's does he, oh yeh and he Bashes so he will disrupt casters too.  So for over an hour you have a DOT that does 20 HP's damage every 5 seconds or so, that's some good use of mana in my book.  <br><br>Now look at the bad pull, where your going to die.  With pet up you run, pet takes agro and gives you about 15 seconds head start running, or FD time, that's a nice use of bone chips too.  I have also used a pet to split 2 spawns to pull later.  I bring pet with me and pull 1, 2 come and I then Pull again whichever 1 the pet isn't agro too.  The 2 NPC's are now split enough to single pull them once the pet dies and I can stand back up.  The pet will work about the same now if you have a Chanter, the pet makes it easy to get everyone on 1 MOB while the pet slows down the other and the Chanter Mezzes the one the pet is on without getting beat on.<br><br>When you learn how to use the pet better, even the level 9 pet is useful.  Every bit of damage you can add when soloing helps you, and the Pet is a great DOT in those cases.  Now with the new pet rules regarding agro and Mez the pet's are immensely more useful than ever before.  A good Shadow Knight will learn to master every ability he/she has to do damage the enemy and the Pet is one of the more interesting ones to master.<br><br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 55 DE Revenant</p>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 62 DE Gravelord<br>Have Axe, will travel</td></td></tr>

I'd say where you were describing is one of the places you may not want a pet, green agro's can be a pain, unless you have mana and need something to tap.<br><br>I normally try and get velium weapons since my pet can proc them now.  But if no weapons are available I'll still summon them, 10 damage a hit beats no damage a hit.  The only time not to use a pet is wheer they bring agro you don't want in my opinion.

Our equipment to the best of my knowledge is roughly equal.<br><br>I'm wondering if there is any tactic, or item I can get that will help give me an edge. I thought about picking up a vial of vampire blood as I've heard it can add to my resist magic (that would bring my SVM up to about 80 to 85 I'm thinking provided it worked I've never used it before) I also plan on using a sow potion to make fear kiting if she does get it off less effective. Any other ideas would be appreciated.<br><br>Also a side question, At level 32 my AC is 671 is this too low...on par...good. If it is too low where should my AC roughly be at my lvl? At 40...50...60?<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Adrioch<br>Lvl 32 Dark Elf SK<br>Morell-Thule<br>Pact of Mortals</p>&nbsp;<br></td></td></tr>

Don't forget your pet, and give him a rusty weapon, all weapons hit for the same regardless.  Both of your pets will most likely go at it, and hopefully yours gets the final hit.  Well that's how it is when I fight SK's.  <br><br>At lvl 32, you may have a problem getting your darkness going(resisted alot for me), but keep at it.  and drain his str, then his ac, atk.  That's my order, but it all ends the same.  And stack your DOT's, heat blood is one of my favorite, and it's hard to resist.<br><br>The one item I love in pvp/dueling is my shield.  A well placed bash saves lots of hp's and really turns the edge.  And last but not least, HT, If you don't use yours, she will.  Make sure you land yours at the right time.  <br><br>If I remember correctly my life tap cost me a lot of mana at 33, and I was a dark elf.  So be careful not to over do the life tap.  OOM, means sitting duck.  Make sure they run out first, while they are trying to get they're DOT's going, your interupting, and getting your good licks in.<br><br>I tend to run strait at them, bash, slash, past them, then stop, and while Im turning around, cast life tap.  They have to turn around to see you.<br><br>Im a little tired all, so sorry for the rambling, but I love my pvp.  Hope this helps some of ya'll. Good luck.<br><br><br>Scyinide 41(Retired)<br>Tallon Zek Server<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Jun  4 17:31:20 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br></td></td></tr>

Here's the deal. The reagent you use is a coffin costing about 1 to 2pp depending on your charisma. I buy mine in Neriak from the human merchant next to the soulbinder in the foreign quarter.

They are not above 35th level<br><br>The coffins can't be put in containers so that's a bit of a pain. I usually keep one in the bank to summon my own corpse if I am dead.

So you can buy different types and classes of coffins you have to check them before you buy. for instance the jaded inlaid coffin is used for lvl35 and up corps summons. while the black cerimonial coffins are used for lvl 35 and below also with saying that. i will also say that you have to insure you have the right coffin for the right spell<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Sun Jul&nbsp;&nbsp;7 18:24:10 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br></td></td></tr>

Maybe get a Greater Guard of Haste for your shoulders if you want haste, but get at least 5 AC and better 10AC item for the waste.<br><br>Loose the Netted Kelp Choker, you should get an even trade for a Spider Fur Collar with much better stats for a SK.  Bracer of Scavenging is better (better stats) than the Darkforge Bracer and Gauntlets of the Black are now fairly cheap and alot better than the DF Gloves.<br><br>Both rings could be upgraded to the 6AC 65HP ones, but that isn't essential.  You should also look to find or quest the DF Legs.

ROFL, I went to lvl 30 with a Silvery War Axe (1 hand version) so 10/22 sure beats my 6/22 in those levels.

The defense goes up slow because you must be hit (not just swung at) to have this go up, and the hard you get hit the faster it goes up.<br><br>I have recently tried a few new twinks and my latest has made it to lvl 10 and has only gotten 10 increases in defense.  So at that point I stripped off some armor and amaizingly his defense is now going up rapidly.  I 'think' that if your AC is already negating most of the enemies attack it looks to your defensive skills like you are not being attacked and they don't get trained.  I have seen several other posts about AC talking about how you take damage being:  first the enemies attack is rated against your dodge/parry/rippost, then against your AC then against your defensive skills to determne if and how much you get hit for.  If this is in fact true and your armor is preventing you from getting hit all by itself most times, then that could account for the slow improvements I've seen in defense.  It seems that the best way to train defense is to actually lower your AC slightly, get some type of regen and have a healer keep you alive while getting hit hard.<br><br>This is just my theory to explain the same thing you are seeing.  Take it for what it's worth since I can't prove it.<br><br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 55 DE Revenant</p>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 62 DE Gravelord<br>Have Axe, will travel</td></td></tr>
