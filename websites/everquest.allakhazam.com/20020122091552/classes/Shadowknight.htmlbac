<p><b>This is a very difficult class to play.&nbsp; Shadowknights are supposed
to be the opposite of Paladins.&nbsp; They are basically a combination
of a necromancer and a warrior, leaning more towards the warrior aspects.&nbsp;
Because of the necromancer elements, they are actually a little easier
to solo than other tank classes, getting some dot spells and a pet to help
them out.&nbsp; Yet in many ways, they are also weaker.&nbsp; This class
really comes into its own at the higher levels, but can be very difficult
to get to that point.&nbsp; As with the necromancer, shadowknights are
hated by most good NPC's, and find it difficult to find places to buy and
sell things.&nbsp; It is also difficult to travel, as many NPC's will kill
you on sight.&nbsp; However, this is part of the challenge of playing an
evil class, and an element that many people enjoy.&nbsp; This is probably
one of the least played classes in the game, so it can sometimes be difficult
to find a group that knows how to use your skills.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
if you have the patience to milk it through the lower levels and are willing
to be hated by just about everything in Norrath, you may enjoy playing
this class.</b>
