You want to know what the problem with that is?  SK spells basically stink for the level you are when you get them.  Why is that a problem?  Well, put simply for your simple brain, SKs are TANKS that use spells to SUPPLEMENT their TANKING ABILITY, NOT the other way around.<br><br>Next thing out of your rude mouth will be that DE WAR are better then ORG/TRL WAR because of their higher AGI.....<br><br>The numbers ARE WHAT THEY ARE---I don't make this crap up on my own, nor could I care less about one race being superior to another.

And sine the last time I was grouped with a Troll SK (2 nights ago in Velks) on the MOBs I tanked I needed alot less healing than he did.  When I tank I get 1 CHeal per fight against most spiders, he needed CHeal and at least 2 devine lights per spider, so who was the better tank?  I asked him his HP's after we were both buffed, he had me by just over 100HP's.  We both had high end gear, but he went +INT where I went with more STA/HPs.  If we both stripped down he'd have a bigger edge in HP's, but you never fight that way so it's irrelevant.<br><br>What do SK's have over Trolls?  INT, AGI and DEX are all higher.  They can wear alot of armor pieces that Trolls can't (Hero Bracer, Imbued Granit Spaulers, and several more very nice items).  And our spells are great at every level, once you learn HOW to use them.  At lvl 55 our Lifetaps are awesome and only get better, since I fight at about 16 INT, yes I get alot more life per mana bar than a Troll.  The Troll SK's I ask usually fught at about 100 INT (some more) so that gives me over 600 mana more than they do (that's 4 Spirit Taps more if that's all we caste which it isn't).  In fact I often end up being the snarer for most XP groups lately, as my darkness sticks at least as well as ensnare and slows just as much, AND does damage.  With our debuffs we can stack as much debuff as the Enchanters Cripple Spell (using all 4 major debuffs we have).<br><br><br>And just 1 last point, who wins Best of the Best Tournaments more?  Well it's DE SK's and Gnome Warriors.  Why?  I'm not sure but I'd guess it's because we've learned how to get the most out of our classes while the Trolls just run up and hit Auto Attack and cast spells every now and then.  PvP is not that relavent to Player vs MOB. but it's something you should think about the next time you use someone's question to go off on an irrelevant topic about how only Trolls and Ogres make good SK's.<br><br>So do some looking, you'll see I've posted for a LONG time with a good reputaion.  So just MAYBE I know about SK's a little.  I'm still not sure you've ever played an SK reading all your posts.<br><br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 55 DE Revanent</p>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 62 DE Gravelord<br>Have Axe, will travel</td></td></tr>

I use the dex/haste/invis gnome-only clickys relentlessly (our culteral armour is awsome for gnome warriors and I still use the effects at 60). No where other than warrior epic can I get a nice clicky-dex buff until mabee I start using weapons procing avatar, so gnome-only dex buffs are welcome.<br><br>In full Myrmidons and have excellent dex and cap str and dex at 255 when fully buffed(agi comes darn close (252ish), I would reccomend you dump all points into stamina, as I still cant cap that at 255 (I put all my in STR when STR was god 3 years ago).<br><br>The only drawback I had the whoel time as a gnome warrior was the lack of good armour for short races back in the kunark era. We couldnt wear Imbued Granite Spaulders from the Hole (now we have alternates which are better anyway), we couldnt use the 16ac 3str sleeves form FM (which we have better nowdays anyway, at the time 16ac was godly comparable only to cobalt), And we couldnt use a few other things which have better items availible to us now anyway (tantors tusk replaces the fact we could never use the huge axe from kunark for riposte disc's etc)<br><br>All in all it ALL comes down to what you like. At 60 the iksar may have 60more ac, the ogres may have more hp (until you're muffed to 255 the same as they are) and the ogres may be unstunnable, but I've not fought a mob yet where I've lost aggro due to stun, and the bigger mobs out there seem to stun ALOT less than general zone trash mobs anyway (not counting those that proc or ae a stun even ogres get hit by). Not to mention the 60 extra ac an iksar may have still wont mitigate the majority of those 850 quads your taking from Uber_mob003.<br><br>And besides, Gnomes are just too damn stylish.<br><br>Gnimwit Gnumbskull&quot;<br><br>&quot;What makes the best warrior is the person driving the warrior.

The regen at uber levels means even less. We just took Rhaq 1--one of easier mobs that needs rotation CH--and the other MT (since I died about 1 minute into the fight) took about 100,000 damage in 7 minutes. In the 70 ticks an Iksar would have regen (wiht full AAs to regen) something like 1600 HP.

Further, the Gnome, AT THE END OF THE DAY, does NOT HAVE THE ADVANTAGES that the other races do.  All he can do is belittle the advantages of those other races.  I dont care either way---Im not biased to any one race.  The advantages ARE WHAT THEY ARE &amp; if you WANT TO MAXIMIZE YOUR character, why not have the most advantages?  You two, on the other hand, are totally biased to DEs &amp; that is just plain silly.

Can you explain that?  Further, it is NOT EASY, despite what ANYONE SAYS.  Yeah right.  Like getting this END GAME gear that everyone talks about is SO EASY.  If it was so easy, then why doesnt the lvl 55 DE have it then?<br><br>Oh, I get it.  You need to be near lvl 60 (or so)to get it then?  If that's the case, that's silly also.  Basically, you are TOTALLY OUTMATCHED until you reach lvl 60 (or so), at which time, the other SUPERIOR TANKING RACES are hampered by the caps more than your NON-TANKING RACE (otherwise the NON-TANKING RACES WOULD NEVER CATCH THEM--Verant should probably fix this, but...).

Please see my other post where I discuss this further.  I group with ANYONE &amp; EVERYONE, including NECs/WIZs/MAGs--they are all great.  Some FOOLS though, have a total misunderstanding that they done bring anything to the table &amp; that perception is just not right.  As a matter of fact, its just plain stupid.<br><br>What you guys are missing, however, is that a DE/ERU SK cannot tank as well as a ORG/TRL SK (all things being equal).  <br><br>If you want to bitch at someone, bitch at Verant--THEY MADE THE NUMBERS UP--I DIDNT.<br><br>Lunatic</p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>
