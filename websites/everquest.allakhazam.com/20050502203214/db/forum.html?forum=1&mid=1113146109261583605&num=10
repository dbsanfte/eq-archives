Solo tasks and group missions (ok, and events as well, but we'll ignore that for now). This can cause confusion because the &quot;missions&quot; use the task window, so lots of people get really confused when talking about them. But you can really think of them as two separate things. The solo tasks are things that only you do. You may do them in conjunction with other people, but you only get the extra credit for your task, and no one else has to have that same task as you. The shared tasks (missions) are selected like LDoN adventures or GoD/OoW expeditions. Your group must all be within a certain level range (10 in this case) and they all get the same mission and succeed at the same time and get the same reward.<br><br>Until you have indifferent faction, you cannot get *any* solo tasks or group missions from eitherr the Keepers or Dark Reign people (the two groups in the caves). Prior to that, you can build faction one of two ways:<br><br>1. Join someone else's mission. Only the requester has to have sufficient faction/progression to get the mission. Anyone else can be a member and go along. Since the missions are given out by either the Keeper (good guys) or Dark Reign (bad guys), and SoE didn't want to force people to split too badly, there are *no* faction hits or gains for simply completing the missions. At the end of the mission, you get some number of crystals (either ebon or radiant depending on who gave out the mission), and a faction token (also specific to the group). You can trade the crystals if you want, but the faction token is no-drop. If you don't want the faction hit (say yo're working on Keepers faction and youdid a mission for Dark Reign), just destroy the token. If you want it, hand it in to the correct guy at the wayfarers camp (I'll explain that in a second).<br><br>2. Do a solo task at the wayfarers camp. Since there's been an amazing amount of confusion on this too, let me explain further. There are *three* camps of relevant NPCs in Lavastorm for the DoN expansion. There are the Keeper's (left side of caves). There is the Dark Reign (right side). There is the wayfarers (neutral). If I had a dollar for everytime someone thought the wayfarers *are* one of those other two camps, I'd be really really wealthy. No. They are at a different camp. Straight out from both caves is a big hill (you run between it and the zonewall when you go from one cave to the other). On the other side of that hill are two things. At the west end is the entrance to Naggy's lair. At the east end is the wayfarers camp. If you hit the big lake of lave, you've gone too far...<br><br>There are six NPCs of importance to this issue there. Don't ask me the names, cause I don't remember. You need to hail them and talk to them. Two of them will specifically talk about collecting faction tokens, one for each of the two factions. Those are the guys you turn the faction tokens you get at the end of missions to. The other four give out solo tasks. <b>Read what they say when you hail them!</b>. They will say they either work for the followers of Firiona Vie (Keepers) or &quot;dark Crusaders&quot; (Dark Reign). You'd be amazed how many people don't realize that even though they all say &quot;Alliance Tasks&quot; above their names, they are *not* all for the same faction. Make sure you talk to one of the two that are for the faction you want to increase.<br><br>Each of the two pairs gives out the same tasks. So just because someone says &quot;get task X&quot;, and you got that same named task, do *not* assume that you'll get the same faction (I've seen people screw up and erase their faction gains this way many times). Again. Pay attention to the messages they give when you hail them. They'll tell you what faction they work for. Stop and read that before accepting a task, or you'll waste a hell of a lot of tome. Of the four tasks, 3 of them are &quot;collection&quot; type tasks. If you are truely doing them solo, you *might* get a collection done faster. But there's one &quot;kill&quot; mission called population control. Basically you kill 20 mobs in Stillmoon temple (except for the statues). If you are grouping at all to do these tasks, that is the one you should take. The reason is that everyon in the group gets credit for the kill for every kill. So a group of 6 could all take the population control task, run to still moon, kill 20 mobs and all 6 are done. That same group if they all took the meat collection quest (get 7 goblin meat IIRC) would need to kill an absolute minimum of 42 mobs. That's assuing that every single mob they kill is a goblin, and that each of them drop a meat (which isn't likely). It's a no-brainer IMO.<br><br>If you hit the &quot;decline all&quot; button, wait a few seconds, and then hail the task giver again, he'll present you with new tasks (it may take a few tries). Basically, once you do one task, that giver will automatically offer you the other task he's got the next time you show up (and only that task). Unless you really really want to waste a lot of time with this part, I'd recommend just finding one task you can do easily, and using this method to repeat that task over and over.<br><br><br><br>A couple final notes. Once you get to indifferent faction, the guys in the caves will offer you missiones. They'll also offer you solo tasks as well. These are a bit different then the ones from the wayfarers. They are a &quot;set&quot; of tasks that go in tiers. You start to get some serious rewards from those, but they start to get much more difficult as well.<br><br>At that point, the wayfarers will no longer offer you solo tasks. Not a big deal since the whole reason for doing them was to get up faction in the first place, and you're done with that. There are a whole set of mission you can do now, and you'll start to get rewards for them (crystals and more faction). The more faction you gain,and the more progression you go through your solo tasks, the more stuff you get as a reward. More importantly, you can invite other people to your DoNs instead of the other way around.<br><br>It's a pretty decent set up. Heh. It's actually remarkably similar to a mission progression system that I wrote about back when LDoN came out when I was bitching about how they *should* have done that expansion. They don't have the dynamic threats and zone impacts that I envisioned, but this is a step in the right diretion.</p></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8">Posting from San Diego, CA</td></tr></table>

Honestly, you'll have a hell of a time doing those solo tasks at a lower level anyway (aside from the &quot;kill 11 goblin laborers in stillmoon&quot; one I suppose).<br><br>As to the wayfarers solo tasks, I honestly found them *very* hard to do solo. As a level 66 paladin I *could* single kill the mobs, but it was really really slow and annoying. The lavaspider thingies were a pain to get to and the pathing of the mobs guaranteed that you'd get a higher level &quot;rare&quot; mob coming from one direction or another before you could collect the silks you needed. The best one seemed to be the &quot;kill 20&quot; mission in stillmoon, but I honestly gave up after like 2 solo kills since it was waaaay too slow doing it alone. I was unlucky and found no one there at the time. Came back later and grouped up with random people there and finished it in no time.<br><br><br>And that's the really cool thing about those wayfarers solo tasks. Aside from one occasion, I've yet to log into stillmoon and see no one there at all. And since most of the people there are doing various faction quests themselves (exp isn't that got IMO), no one has any issues with inviting random people to join up. Um. This is obviously another reason to take the &quot;kill 20&quot; task instead of the goblin meat task. Folks might be less likely to invite you to join them if they know they'll have to share drops with you (unless of course none of them have that particular mission). Since all kills count for everyone, they'll always be willing to invite you if that's the mission you have. It costs them nothing.<br><br><br>Oh. One more observation. Don't forget your double exp potion you hopefully got recently. Once you start doing the second tier solo tasks (the ones from the keeper/darkreign camps), the exp reward for completion starts to get *really* huge. It's not a bad idea at all to take a drink of your potion right before you kill that last mob. I think the first solo one gave me like 1.5 bubbles of AA exp. Later tasks will give out free AAs (not sure if that's actual exp though, so that may not count). But you'll likely not get a better gain in terms of exp per use of those potions then upon completion of those tasks.</p></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8">Posting from San Diego, CA</td></tr></table>

Solo tasks and group missions (ok, and events as well, but we'll ignore that for now). This can cause confusion because the &quot;missions&quot; use the task window, so lots of people get really confused when talking about them. But you can really think of them as two separate things. The solo tasks are things that only you do. You may do them in conjunction with other people, but you only get the extra credit for your task, and no one else has to have that same task as you. The shared tasks (missions) are selected like LDoN adventures or GoD/OoW expeditions. Your group must all be within a certain level range (10 in this case) and they all get the same mission and succeed at the same time and get the same reward.<br><br>Until you have indifferent faction, you cannot get *any* solo tasks or group missions from eitherr the Keepers or Dark Reign people (the two groups in the caves). Prior to that, you can build faction one of two ways:<br><br>1. Join someone else's mission. Only the requester has to have sufficient faction/progression to get the mission. Anyone else can be a member and go along. Since the missions are given out by either the Keeper (good guys) or Dark Reign (bad guys), and SoE didn't want to force people to split too badly, there are *no* faction hits or gains for simply completing the missions. At the end of the mission, you get some number of crystals (either ebon or radiant depending on who gave out the mission), and a faction token (also specific to the group). You can trade the crystals if you want, but the faction token is no-drop. If you don't want the faction hit (say yo're working on Keepers faction and youdid a mission for Dark Reign), just destroy the token. If you want it, hand it in to the correct guy at the wayfarers camp (I'll explain that in a second).<br><br>2. Do a solo task at the wayfarers camp. Since there's been an amazing amount of confusion on this too, let me explain further. There are *three* camps of relevant NPCs in Lavastorm for the DoN expansion. There are the Keeper's (left side of caves). There is the Dark Reign (right side). There is the wayfarers (neutral). If I had a dollar for everytime someone thought the wayfarers *are* one of those other two camps, I'd be really really wealthy. No. They are at a different camp. Straight out from both caves is a big hill (you run between it and the zonewall when you go from one cave to the other). On the other side of that hill are two things. At the west end is the entrance to Naggy's lair. At the east end is the wayfarers camp. If you hit the big lake of lave, you've gone too far...<br><br>There are six NPCs of importance to this issue there. Don't ask me the names, cause I don't remember. You need to hail them and talk to them. Two of them will specifically talk about collecting faction tokens, one for each of the two factions. Those are the guys you turn the faction tokens you get at the end of missions to. The other four give out solo tasks. Read what they say when you hail them!. They will say they either work for the followers of Firiona Vie (Keepers) or &quot;dark Crusaders&quot; (Dark Reign). You'd be amazed how many people don't realize that even though they all say &quot;Alliance Tasks&quot; above their names, they are *not* all for the same faction. Make sure you talk to one of the two that are for the faction you want to increase.<br><br>Each of the two pairs gives out the same tasks. So just because someone says &quot;get task X&quot;, and you got that same named task, do *not* assume that you'll get the same faction (I've seen people screw up and erase their faction gains this way many times). Again. Pay attention to the messages they give when you hail them. They'll tell you what faction they work for. Stop and read that before accepting a task, or you'll waste a hell of a lot of tome. Of the four tasks, 3 of them are &quot;collection&quot; type tasks. If you are truely doing them solo, you *might* get a collection done faster. But there's one &quot;kill&quot; mission called population control. Basically you kill 20 mobs in Stillmoon temple (except for the statues). If you are grouping at all to do these tasks, that is the one you should take. The reason is that everyon in the group gets credit for the kill for every kill. So a group of 6 could all take the population control task, run to still moon, kill 20 mobs and all 6 are done. That same group if they all took the meat collection quest (get 7 goblin meat IIRC) would need to kill an absolute minimum of 42 mobs. That's assuing that every single mob they kill is a goblin, and that each of them drop a meat (which isn't likely). It's a no-brainer IMO.<br><br>If you hit the &quot;decline all&quot; button, wait a few seconds, and then hail the task giver again, he'll present you with new tasks (it may take a few tries). Basically, once you do one task, that giver will automatically offer you the other task he's got the next time you show up (and only that task). Unless you really really want to waste a lot of time with this part, I'd recommend just finding one task you can do easily, and using this method to repeat that task over and over.<br><br><br><br>A couple final notes. Once you get to indifferent faction, the guys in the caves will offer you missiones. They'll also offer you solo tasks as well. These are a bit different then the ones from the wayfarers. They are a &quot;set&quot; of tasks that go in tiers. You start to get some serious rewards from those, but they start to get much more difficult as well.<br><br>At that point, the wayfarers will no longer offer you solo tasks. Not a big deal since the whole reason for doing them was to get up faction in the first place, and you're done with that. There are a whole set of mission you can do now, and you'll start to get rewards for them (crystals and more faction). The more faction you gain,and the more progression you go through your solo tasks, the more stuff you get as a reward. More importantly, you can invite other people to your DoNs instead of the other way around.<br><br>It's a pretty decent set up. Heh. It's actually remarkably similar to a mission progression system that I wrote about back when LDoN came out when I was bitching about how they *should* have done that expansion. They don't have the dynamic threats and zone impacts that I envisioned, but this is a step in the right diretion.<hr size="1" /></blockquote><br><br>classic<br><br><i><span class="sm">Edited, Mon Apr 11 20:07:02 2005 by Dracoid</span class="sm"></i></p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br /><b><span style='color: blue;'><a href="HTTP://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=648266&resize=true" target="akztarg">Expert Brewer Dracoid Electricbozoukiboy</a></b></span style='color: blue;'><br>68 Halfling Druid with 35AA<br><b><span style='color: blue;'><a href="HTTP://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=993904" target="akztarg"><br><br>Brazlaag Bigblueunderpants</a></b></span style='color: blue;'><br>41 Ogre Shadowknight<br><br><a href="HTTP://everquest.allakhazam.com/uf/Dracoid/robocop.jpg" target="akztarg">policing the streets of the asylum</a></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8">Posting from the gallery</td></tr></table>
