Included are more details and a few explanations changed to fill in gaps. I have completed this quest recently and also have a few Lucan slayings under my belt so here it goes...<br><br>OK you want to get your soulfire? All you will need for this quest is knowledge of a few places on norrath and in the end a few friends in there mid 40s to help you complete it. You will also take serious faction hits in Freeport...But no bother, all REAL paladins are and will always be KOS in west/east Freeport.. Learn the sewer maps well, especially how to use the hidden wall in West Freeport to get to paladin-friendly north Freeport. (Eqatlas.com has great maps for learning this, I recommend consulting maps before going to all places in this quest)<br><br>First off, forget all that crap about Zimel's Blades, it's just for background info. Second, you can start this quest at any level.<br><br>Step One: Zone into WFP and go to the newbie zone and start killing snakes, fire beetles, and rats. You will need about 10 of each of these (unless you are or know someone who is a brewer/baker): snake scales, fire beetle eyes, rat ears. Also Make sure to check every vendor for "a spiders venom sack' (which you will need in the near future) as well as the ears, scales and eyes - newbies sell these to vendors.<br><br>Step Two: Zone to EC and run to the hidden inn (between the 2 orc camps along the northern wall). The vendor on the right sells cloth shirts. Buy one. Run over to Altunic Jartin's Hut (which is near the zone to WC on the path) and give him the cloth shirt. He will give you a coin. (If he's not there wait about 5 minutes, he roams the zone before he comes back)<br><br>Step Three: Zone into Nro and kill Desert Tarantulas until you get a spider venom sac. You may get lucky and find one for sale at one of the merchants (which was mentioned before) <br><br>Step Four: Zone into EFP and go to the tavern at the docks. As you are facing the bar there should be a doorway to your left. Go in that room and the merchant from the bar on the side. Buy a Drom's champagne from the merchant. It is lore so you can only buy one. Now at the bar that you are facing sooner or later will spawn a guy named Tykar Renklin. I've done this twice. The first time he spawned at 5 pm (game time) after about 10 minutes of me waiting, the second time he spawned at 1 am after about 2 hours =(. He looks like a madman from North Ro. As soon as he spawns begin Hailing him. Also give him the Drom's Champagne. As you continue to Hail him buy another Drom's from the merchant and give it to him. After a total of four Drom's Champagnes he will give you a blanket (no drop lore) It would be easier if you had a friend help you with the Hails while you buy the Drom's and give to him, but it can be done just as easily alone.<br><br>Step 5: Run to NFP and go to the paladin guild. In the back yard there stands a leather-clad freak by the name of Merko Quentalis(sp?) Give him the spider venom sac. He will give you a coin. Give the coin that he gave you plus the coin that Altunic Jartin gave you back to him at the same time. As soon as you do this RUN to the sewers right there (behind the canoe) and Kill the npc that spawns there. (She is lvl 5 or so I believe) Root, snare, blast, if you have friends, but do her in quick because she runs away. She looks like a wfp guard. She will drop another coin. Give that coin to Merko and he will give you Your Testament (Put it in bank for safekeeping) <br>(Item 1 for Soulfire).<br><br>Step Six: While in NFP run to the marketplace (where the bank is) and go to the inn by jade tiger's. Purchase from one of the merchants a bottle. Go to the Brew Kettle there and put the following items in: snake scale (1), bottle (1), water flask (1) (which you should have on you unless you're a camel or something), and press combine. If you fail you will get the bottle back. Try again. You have 10 snake scales to work with. If you fail 10 times you don't deserve Soulfire LOL. J/K. The item you are trying to brew is Bog Juice. Once you have the bog juice exit the building and directly across the courtyard from you will be an oven. Place a rat ear and a fire beetle eye in the oven and combine. Do this till you succeed. You will make Edible Goo. Be sure to put the bog juice and edible goo beneath your own supply of food and water in your inventory or else you will eat that nasty stuff. (Put it in bank for safekeeping)<br><br>Step Seven: Zone to WFP again and run to the arena. In one of the jail cells is a prisoner. (Not sure what number cell but as you run in from the arena it will be the first cell on your left) Give the blanket, juice, and goo to the prisoner and he will give you a key.<br><br>Step Eight: Run that key all the way through high hold to High Keep and give it to bank clerk jaylin (sp?). She will give you a letter to Brother Hayle in SplitPaw.<br>(Item 2 for Soulfire)<br><br>Step nine: Run to Queynos and convert about 100pp to gold pieces...Run to the temple of life and look for Lashun Novashine who is sporadically on the ramp leading to the gyrating disk of the temple of life. If he is not there wait, he will eventually walk on or appear there. /con him. Hand him 2gp at a time until you are AMIABLE with the temple of life. (You may continue to hand him 2 gp at a time until you are warmly but that takes hours on end) Now, there is a paladin knight that swims in this nice pool underneath the ramp, he is guarding the fish inside the pool. And a great way to raise faction QUICKLY is to kill these fish "Koalandi" and the fish that sometimes loots from their corpses is handed to the paladin swimming in the pool, and as long as you are at least amiable with the priests of life it will give you a NICE faction boost with the temple, as well as a gift (I got a necklace and nice caster ring after a few trys) Now you must understand killing these fish gives you negative faction, so the best way to get these fish to the paladin is to have a friend create a mule, or new character to use (preferably a human warrior) and kill the fish - another note is that you must stay near the edges of the pool to avoid being killed by the paladin in the water...Now, have your friend or hired newbie =) kill fish and let you loot them, immediately giving the looted fish to the paladin swimming...I went from amiable to warmly in 8 fish, some ppl do it in 4 others in 10...Depends, but it works well, and is faster than the 2gp method. As soon as you are warmly with temple of life, you are done with this part. Also, beware what you kill...lots of NPCs in norrath will give you negative faction hits with temple - so if you get a hit immediately go back to queynos and raise it back to warmly.<br><br>Step Ten: Head to West Freeport again. This is where you need your high level friends. You are about to take down Sir Lucan, who spawns in the Freeport militia house in West Freeport. (He is sometimes not there or not spawned yet, he has a 6 hour spawn time so wait) Lucan is only level 48ish but he hits hard and has a buddy named Brother Jentry who will completely heal Lucan. (Lucan hits in double 100s, similar to fighting higher-level named frogs in lguk)<br><br>Here is how you kill Lucan:<br><br>You will need at least 4 tanks, 2 druids, cleric and some nuking classes if you can muster. (DO THIS IN THE DAYTIME =p) Get buffed up and rdy...It will be divided up like this, you have the attacking ppl and the hailing/pulling ppl (who must be non-kos), and 1 druid that will kite Brother Jentry. The attacking ppl are whom you are going to pull lucan to to get whooped, I recommend you have this force at the west wall, near the cactus that marks the zone line. (Facing the gate to your left) When I pulled lucan I was a 40 paladin with wolf form and good buffs, I had a friend open the doors in the militia house for me to insure I don?t get stuck and get a whoopin by guards on the way out. I ran Lucan straight out to the zone without getting hit once. Now, after I zoned I immediately zoned back...I began to hail Lucan along with a friend, at this point Lucan and the rest of the guards will begin to kill stuff in the zone, this is normal... Continually hail lucan and eventually all the guards will return to there spots cept for Lucan who is being hailed. When the guards have returned and there is no other guards cept for lucan in site, have someone hit lucan and pull him to your attacking party waiting at the cactus on the west wall. Begin to pound lucan and watch the heals on the tanks for they will be beat on pretty badly. Now, sometimes (every time I have killed Lucan) Brother Jentry will come out to Lucans side and try to heal him (no matter if he went back or not) If Jentry reappears you need to have 1 of your 2 druids (or another kiting class) kite Jentry to the opposite wall and keep them there until the battle is done.<br>After Lucan is killed he will respawn into a weaker undead form and it is this next kill that will wield the testament for the soulfire, it is no drop so the paladin must loot it. The other lucan corpse will sometimes have some nifty boots so loot that one as well. PPL who don?t want the freeport milita faction hit need to zone before lucan is killed :)<br><br>Step eleven: Zone into NFP and hand the Lucan's testament into Valeron Dushire at the Pali Guild. This will get you the brilliant sword of faith (Item 3 for soulfire).<br><br>Step twelve: Get a port to BB or GFAY and go to Mistmoore. You will now need to kill a shadow knight troll named Xitocl and get item 4, the glowing hilt. All you need is 2 tanks in there 40s, preferably a ranger/druid, and a healer class. (1 person MUST know mistmoore well, it is not a nice place and you will need someone with camo or invisibility) Xiotlc is a level 38 MOB despite rumors of being higher and he spawns in the 'spa' room. Camp in the gargoyle room near the spa room and eventually Xio will spawn. His placeholder is 'a mistmoore guard' who is very easy to kill. Xiotlc will drop the hilt every time and exit by jumping off of the bridge that leads directly to the zone.<br><br>Okay let's review the items:<br><br>item 1: Your Testament (Lore/No Drop)<br>item 2: Note to Brother Hayle (neither lore nor no drop...I've heard of n00bs who make money doing this quest for higher level pali's that don't wanna waste time)<br>item 3: Flaming Sword (Lore/No Drop)<br>item 4: Glowing Hilt (Lore/No Drop)<br><br>Step thirteen: Get a port to North Karanas and run to SplitPaw in South Karanas (approx loc: neg 3500 pos 500 in the middle of the 3 spires) Have your wizzie or druid friend there with ya, and have a map of the place handy. Your friend is there for invis and port once you get the sword. Don't forget to get a screenshot right away though =). Run in to the jail where Brother Hayle is and con him. MAKE SURE HE IS WARMLY /CON BEFORE YOU GIVE HIM ANYTHING&gt; this is where that 2 gp at a time and fish faction quest was for. If he is, give him only the note from the clerk in HK first. He will then give you that note back and give you a shopping list (the items you already have =P) Then give all the items back to him and you will get...dun dun DUN:<br>A really cool lookin not TOO shabby sword called soulfire.<br><br>Okay some disclaimers:<br>Second I apologize if this walkthrough doesn't include any of the background info. But this is the fastest most reliable way to get that damned..err...holy sword. If you want background info, read about it on this site. No room for roleplaying but this quest is arduous enough as it is.<br>Third, if you are KoS to the militia already don't fret, verant may suck but they ain't dumb. Notice the only part that requires you to actually be around militia guards is the blanket/goo/juice part. What does that part lead to? The note to Brother Hayle which is NOT no drop. A gimp can run this leg of the quest.<br>Finally, realize that you don't have to do the steps in this order. Just keep in mind which pieces go to what items and you can pick any order you want.<br><br>From&nbsp;&nbsp;: www.Everlore.com/quests<br><br><br></p></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width="100%"><tr><td id=fs8></td><td align=right id=fs8 >0 Replies</td></tr></table></td></tr></table><tr><td class=mhback align=right><span class=mh id=fs8><a class=mh href=/db/classes.html?class=6><img src=/shared/root_thread_ico.gif border=0 alt="Up" width=17 height=11> Thread Index</a> |  <a class=mh href=/db/classes.html?class=6&post=1><img src=/shared/new_thread_ico.gif border=0 alt="New" width=17 height=11> New Subject</a> | <a class=mh href=/db/classes.html?class=6&mid=98463949855467&num=0&post=1&mid=98463949855467><img src=/shared/reply_to_thread_ico.gif border=0 alt="Reply" width=17 height=11> Reply to Thread</a></span></td></tr><tr><td><table width=100% border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=mform><tr><td colspan=1  style='font-size: 9.5px;'>0 Posts [ <a href="/fsearch.html?base=class6">Search Forums</a> ]</nobr></td></tr></table>&nbsp;</td></tr>
