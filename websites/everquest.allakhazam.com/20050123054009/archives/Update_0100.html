normally use this space to editorialize, but I really think something has
to be done soon about the load on the servers.&nbsp; In many ways, the
game is becomming unplayable, at least in prime time.&nbsp; The new server
goes up and there's 2000 people on it.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; Clearly, we need
about 5 more of those.&nbsp; It seems obvious to me that the player base
has gone up 40 to 50% since Christmas.&nbsp; It's great that more people
are discovering this excellent game, but the game needs to expand to deal
with the influx of people.&nbsp; I know Verant is trying to deal with it,
and I'm sure the expansion will help, but the delay is definitely frustrating
to many people.&nbsp; So I'll say here what many players are saying elsewhere.&nbsp;
Please put up more servers.&nbsp; I know it's not the be all end all solution,
but it's a start.&nbsp; We want to spend our time fighting Mobs, not fighting
off other players.</font></b>

to change your bookmark to everquest.allakhazam.com.&nbsp; For those who
have been yearning for the old Webbbs board, I have put it up, as well
as the new board.&nbsp; I figure I would let people post on whichever board
they favor.&nbsp; It is linked in the index as Messages, and the Ubbs board
is linked as Forums.&nbsp; Things are beginning to trickle in about the
New </font><a href="zones/Planes/Air.htm">Plane of Sky </a><font color="#000066">(which
brings to mind the question of where the GM's will hang out now that this
is a public plane).&nbsp; It seems more like a high level Temple of Solusek
Ro, with sets of quests for each class than another version of the other
Planes.&nbsp; Very interesting.&nbsp; I have gotten the basic quest descriptions
for many of the quests, and put them in the </font><a href="quests/Q_Sky_Plane.html">Plane
of Sky quest</a><font color="#000066"> section, though I am still missing
a few classes.&nbsp; I have yet to hear from anyone who has completed one

the people who give out the quest.&nbsp; If you manage to complete one
of these quests, please let me know the details and send in the item specifications.&nbsp;

announce the addition of a new affiliate.&nbsp; It's been pointed out to
me that the site is often oriented more towards the good races in Norrath

to admit that I play about 5 different characters and not one is an evil
race.&nbsp; (I'll have to start one up now that I think about it).&nbsp;

<p><b><font color="#000066">January 1, 2000 (or is that 19100):&nbsp; Those
of you who have checked the message board today probably noticed that we
skipped forward a few millenia and are now in the fine year of 19100.&nbsp;
Well, I went out and got the updated version of Webbbs and just finished
installing it.&nbsp; Alas, the version I was using was so old that I can't
transfer the old messages, so we're starting out fresh.&nbsp; The new board
has some nice features.&nbsp; I hope you like it.</font></b>
