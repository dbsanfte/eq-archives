<p><b>Rangers are sort of a cross between a fighter and a druid.&nbsp;
Rangers are the best class at using a bow, and the best magic bows in the
game can only be used by a ranger.&nbsp; Also, Rangers have an innate resistance
to the elements, getting +4 to both fire and cold resistance.&nbsp; Tracking
makes this class really shine.&nbsp; This skill makes Rangers welcome in
any group hunting outdoors.&nbsp; Foraging is also a nice skill given to
Rangers.&nbsp; If you have a Ranger you can find the monsters that give
you the best experience or gold without a lot of mindless wandering, and
you can keep a look out for the ones that will kill you on sight.&nbsp;
Rangers are also pretty good fighters and can readily play the tank.&nbsp;
You can't dish out or take as much damage as a warrior, and you are somewhat
limited in your weapon and armor selection, but you can definitely hold
your own.&nbsp; Because of his druid and tracking abilities, the Ranger
is pretty good solo class.&nbsp; Tracking lets you pick your fights and
only engage the monsters you can beat, and warns you when you are getting
near something that can take you out in a hurry.&nbsp; Your spell casting
lets you slow down the foe to better attack or run.&nbsp; Your ability
with the bow gives you the chance to do damage without engaging.&nbsp;
And your fighting ability lets you fight it straight up when you need to.</b>
