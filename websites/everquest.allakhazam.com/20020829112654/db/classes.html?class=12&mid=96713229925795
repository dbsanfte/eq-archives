	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have seen a few good magician guide posts, however I am gonna show you how to REALLY do good as a magician. This is VERY LONG. It is the extended version of the one I already wrote on this forum. It takes you past level 30 and has a few other things I forgot. <br><br>First off choose your race. I suggest putting 25 points into intelligence and 5 into chrisma. Also, DON'T BE A HUMAN OR DARK ELF IF YOU ARE JUST STARTING THE GAME. Dark elves are evil and will get killed on sight by a lot of other races. Some people say humans level faster than every other race...well guess what..THEY DON'T. Plus humans start with the lowest intelligence and are blind in the night. Also, I wouldn't suggest being an Erudite if you are a newbie. They are nightblind and have THE WORST starting zone in the game. If you are just starting your character I suggest being a Gnome or High Elf. These races are good-aligned, have infravision, and start on the continent of Faydwer...which is a MUCH more newbie oriented continent with less dangers. When you start give your note to your guildmaster and get your newbie robe. Put one training point into piercing, evocation, abjuration, conjuration, and channeling. Scribe your two newbie spells minor shielding and Burst of Flame. Always keep your self buffed with minor shielding - it does make a big differnce at low levels. Use Burst of Flame to help kill your enemy while you melee it. get to level 4...no big problem. <br><br>Now the fun starts. At level 4 you get new spells and the meditation skill. Only put one point into medition. It will raise very fast. You should buy Summon food, Summon water, Flare, Summon dagger(all level 1 spells)...Summon Bandages, Burn, Gate, level 4 earth pet, level 4 water pet. At level 4 you should only buy the earth and water pets. The air and fire ones aren't very useful at these levels, however will become much more usefull at higher levels(especially the air pet!). Sense you can summon bandages it is a good idea to summon a lot of them and practice yuor bind bound skill. It will allow you to heal any player, including your self up to half health. Also at these lower levels it is a VERY good idea to give your pets rusty two-handed weapons (rusty scythes, two-handed swords, and halberds). They will make your pets do MASSIVE damage and allow you to take BIG things. Now from level 4 until 8 your fighting strategy will be simple: send your pet, nuke the MOB with your damage spell (called a DD for short, for all you newbies reading this), and go in and tank for a pet if needed. Since you started out as a gnome or high-elf like I told you to (you did didn't you, hehe), you will be able to kill kobolds to get to level 6. If you are a high elf just run to steamfont...its only a 5 minute run. If you are a gnome...well steamfont is your newbie zone so you should already be there. The kobold camp has 3 kobolds that spawn at the camp and one off the side of the camp on the mountain side. To take the 3 kobolds you will need to give your pet a rusty scythe, two-handed sword, or halberd. They aren't that hard to find. Go to greater faydark and ask around for some. Or go to Felwithe, the starting city of the high elves. You will be able to find some rusty two-handers at many vendors. Kobolds will get you to level 6. Once you get to level 6 I suggest going to Butcher Block and killing dwarven skelatons at the druid ring. They are levels 5-7 and are VERY good exp. If your pet has a two hander you will do very well. The dwarven skelatons will get you to level 8. If you didn't start as a High Elf or Gnome (not recommended if you are first starting everquest), then just find stuff around your newbie zone. At levels 4-8 its not like their is a lack of things kill. IMO find a skelaton camp if you didn't start as a High Elf or gnome. They are in almost everyone newbie zone and will get you to level 8.<br><br>Some people when they first start out don't know how to control their pets. Here are all of the commands you will need to use to control your pet. <br><br>/pet attack - send your pet after whatever you want. <br>/pet back off - makes your pet back off the thing you are fighting. Has to be hit multiple times to work, and if your enemy attacks you yuor pet will go in again. <br>/pet report health - this command makes yourpet tell you how much health it has left. VERY usefull command. Use it a lot in battle. Make sure your pet doesn't die. <br>/pet gaurd here - makes your pet stay where they are and come assist you if anything attacks you. They will return to the spot they left after killing whatever attacked you. <br>/pet get lost - if you get a lower level pet and you aren't satisfied, use this command to get rid of the pet and summon a more powerful one. <br><br>Some other things about pets. Once you get to level 8 MAKE SURE that you outdamge your pet with you DD spells. If you don't outdamage your pet then your pet will get half of the exp. from whatever you killed. From level 4-7 its fine if your pet outdamages you, and since you should be giving your lower level pets rusty two-handed weapons to maked them do A LOT more damage, you probably won't be able to outdamge your pet. However once you get to level 8 make sure you take a little over half of your enemy's HP off with your own DD's so you get full exp. for the kill. <br><br>Level 8 is when magicians start to become REALLY good. At this level they get two great DD's, a damage shield, invisibility, a pet healing spell, a bunch of summoning spells, and of course your pets. The problem is that at this level spells suddenly cost a LOT for their level and you will have A LOT of spells to buy. If you have another higher level character this is no problem, but new characters will have to conserve their money. If you are low on money i suggest buying these spell first and the rest later: level 8 earth pet, Shock of Blades, Sheild of Fire, Invisibility, and Staff of Tracing. These are the only spells you will need for now. The summon staff spell can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. Now to make a ton of money you are going to hunt wisps. Wisps can only be hit by magician means( ie spells or a magical weapon), so it is very important to buy your level 8 summon staff spell, becuase it will make your pets able to hit the wisps. <br><br>The best place to hunt wisps is on the wisp island located between Odus and Qeynos. To get to it, ride the boat from qeynos to Odus and get off at the island the boat stops at in the middle of the ride. Be sure you brought a lot of backpacks/small containers. The strategy to kill these things will be: summon and earth pet and give it a staff you summoned. Then buff the earth pet with your fire damage shield. Then send it in on the wisp and stand back and keep burning the wisp until it is dead. Tank for your pet and cast your shock of swords spell inbetween the attacks of the wisp if needed. Make sure the wisp you attack is along and there are no other ones near. Wisps WILL assist each other and at this level 2 wisps means death. Also, you will want to use your level 1 "summon dagger" spell against the wisps becuase it will summon a magical weapon, and if you are just starting out and don't have a higher level character, you probably won't have access to a magical weapon. Now when you loot the wisps destroy the burnt out lightstone and regular lightstone they drop. However save the Greater Light Stones. You will get one greater lightstone for about every 5 wisps you kill. When all of your backpacks and containers are totally full with Greater light stones, take them to the gypsy camp and give them to one of the ladys(I forget which lady it is exactly...just ask someone). For every greater light stone you give her you will get a good deal of exp. for this level and about 9pp. Very soon you will have enough money to buy the rest of your spells. Here are all the other level 8 spells you will want to buy: <br><br>Renew Elements - this spell will heal your pets. It is good spell during downtime if they aren't fully healed by the time your mana is full. YOu won't need it with your level 8 pets, but your level 12 pets that have more hp and regen slower(becuase of your pet buff burnout) might need to be healed sometimes. This spell is based off your Alteration magic group. This is the first alteration spell you will get. It will fizzle a lot, so practice it up. <br><br>Dimensional Pocket - this spell summons a 4-slot weightless container that makes anything you put into it weightless. Very useful, however USE WITH CAUNTION. The pocket, and everything you put in it, will dissapear if you log off. Is good at higher levels when MOBS are dropped a lot of weapons that are too heavy to carry. Just summon a pocket and put them in it until you can go sell them. This spell can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Eye of Zoom - this isn't as useful a spell as it is fun. It will summon an eye than you can move around and see with. You can't have a pet out to cast this spell. Its fun to scout out an area with or scare lower level people, but it isn't really that useful. <br><br>Lesser Sheilding - this is an upgrade to your level 1 minor shielding spell. Always keep yourself buffed with it. <br><br>Flame Bolt - this is the other DD(direct damage) spell you get at level 8. It has a MUCH farther range than shock of swords and does more damage per hit. The downsides to it are that it takes more mana, has a slightly longer casting time, requires you to have a clear line of sight with your enemy, and will get resisted a lot by things with high fire resists. Its good for pulling things becuase you will be able to get 3 of them off before the monster can reach you, but generally you will want to use Shock of Swords. <br><br>If you ever suddenly feel like not making tons of money and get bored of wisps(unlikely), their are some other good spots to hunt. The first is the single siren spawn in OOT(ocean of tears). Take the boat from FP to BB. Eventually you will come to two large rocks jutting out of the water. Jump off the boat and swim to the left one. On the opposite side of the rock where you swam to is a level 12 siren. You can take her at level 8. Before you go get a bind at the docks in FP. The exp. is great, but its not quite as good as wisps, and the loot is nowhere near as good.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addidion to the single spawn siren is the entire zone of steamfont. This zone has TONS of level 7-11 things...minotaurs, skelatons, pumas, plauge rats, earth elementals, and even harpys! At level 8 you will be able to take all the 11 things if your pet has a weapon. I highly suggest using an earth pet if you come here. A good place to pull things is near the entrance of the minotaur cave on the wall. Ask for directions to the cave. The real danger here is the level 35 minotaur hero that will sometimes spawn and come near the mino cave. If you stay on the wall you will usually be fine. The last place to hunt from level 8-12 is in the east commons. Here you will see darkweed snakes practically carpeting the ground. Use a water pet to kill them becuae they have a VERY nasty poison attack, and the water pet will totally negate the effects of it. You will be able to take them fairly easy even if you don't give your water pet a rusty two-hander. With a rusty two-hander you will beat them into ovlivion.<br><br>Now you will be able to get to level 12 quickly by killing wisps and turning in Greater Light Stones(or if you already had plenty of money so you went to one of my other suggested places). You will also make a ton of money(if you hunted wisps). I highly suggest buying a Stein of Mogguk with all your new money. It gives +10 to your intelligence, which gives you more mana. Also, i would buy some other +int necklaces, earrings, and rings. A new robe would be good too(do you wanna wear your newbie robe forever??) Here are the level 12 spells you will want to buy: <br><br>Burnout - This spell will make your pets regen their hp slower, but it will also make them attack better. A good pet buff spell. Always keep it on your pet. <br><br>Bind Affinity - AWESOME SPELL. This will allow you to bind yourself anywhere so that when you die, thats where you will appear. Before you got this spell you had to have other people bind you, and you can only be bound in cities when other people cast it. <br><br>Cancel Magic - this has several uses. First off it can be used to remove any buffs your enemy has on themselves. Secondly, it can be used to remove most(but not all) DoT's(or damage over time spells) that were cast on you by the enemy. <br><br>Ward Summoned - This is a good spell to use in lavastorm. The only problem is that there are way better places to hunt than lavastorm. Against elemenals it is VERY good. It does the damage of fire bolt, and has the low resist, quick casting time, and lower mana that Shock of Steel has. However, it can only be used against summoned things. The only time you will use it is when dueling other people that have pets. <br><br>Summon Fang - This spell summons a 5/26 weapon that will hit magical creatures(hehe wisps!). If you still don't have a magical weapon at this level use this instead of your level 1 summon dagger spell to hit wisps with. You can fight wisps up to level 16, so it will still be usefull. It can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Elemental Earth - Your earth pet will be the only pet you need to buy. It has massive hp and casts a root spell to keep the enemy away from you. Buffed with burnout and with its massive hp, you might get to full mana before it gets to full health. If that happens use your renew elements spell. <br><br>You also get two area effect spells at this level. You can buy them if you want, but you won't need them. They are almost totally useless for soloing, which is what you should be doing at lower levels. <br><br>At level 12 there are a lot of things open to you. You can kill wisps all the way until level 16. At level 12 your pets will be to hit magical things without wielding magical weapons. Since your level 12 pets will only do 16 damage per hit(and thats the maximum level pets), you should be giving them rusty-two handed weapons. If you can't get any two-handed weapons then just give your pet any weapon. If your pet has a weapon they will do a little more damage than normal even if the weapon doesn't make them hit for a higher maximum damage. Now if you don't want to kill wisps there are a ton of other things to do. <br><br>In Lake Rathe there is a level 15 monk called the hermit. He stands in this hut int he corner of the zone, and repsawns every 5 minutes after being killed. He can get you to level 16 if you don't want to do wisps, or want to mix things up. Summon an earth pet, buff with damage shield and burnout, and then send your pet in and stand back and blast with Shock of Swords until he dies. Tank for pet if needed, however don't do it too much. At level 12 he will kill you quickly. Remember, make sure to outdamage your pet. He is very good exp. and will get you to level 16 preety quick. The loot isn't nearly as good as wisps though. <br><br>Another place to hunt is in OOT(the ocean of tears), which is located between the continents of Antonica and feydwer. You will be hunting sirens in this zone. Go to the docks in freeport and bind yourself there. If you take the ship from freeport to butcher block you will eventually come to two large rocks coming out of the water. Jump off the boat and swim to the rock ont he right. Here you will see two level 12 sirens. Buff your water pet with burnout and your damage shield and send it in. If you bought your area effect spells this would be the time to use them(in fact it is the ONLY use for them). The sirens hit fairly hard but have low hp. After you kill the two sirens they will start spawning one at a time. Kill them as soon as they spawn very quickly. That way you won't have to fight 2 at a time anymore. This spot is AMAZING exp, however like the hermit, it is not nearly as good loot as wisps. Also, be sure to give your pet a rusty two-handed sword befoe you engage the sirens. The best spot to buy rusty weapons is on the boat from freeport to butcher block. At the first stop you will arrive at sister island. Get off and go in the shop. They sell rusty halberds here. When givin to your pet, they will make your pet do 20 damage a hit. Also, it is highly suggested to use a water pet here, since you will have to kill 2 things every 5 minutes it is a better choice than the earth pet that might not be able to keep up with the quick spawns.<br><br>Soon you will be level 16. All of these methods will level you fast(although I still think wisps are the best method becuase they give so much money). Once you get to level 16 the best place to hunt is in lake rathe, which is where the hermit was located if you went to fight him from 12-16. Before I talk about lake rathe I will tell you your new spells for level 16: <br><br>Shock of Flame - a new DD spell! At level 12 you didn't get a new DD, except for ward summoned which you probably didn't use. For 70 mana this spell will start off doing 91 damage and eventually raise to 97 damage. <br><br>See Invisible - this spell will allow you to see invisible players and pets. Since your air pet casts invisiblity on itself a lot, its good to use this spell when using an air pet. <br><br>Summon Throwing Daggers - this spell will summon a bunch of throwing dagger that can be given to someone that uses throwing weapons (monks, rogues, and bards in general). This spell can only be bought in the dark elf, gnome, and erudite cities. <br><br>Heatstone - this spell will summon an item that will grant the user infravision. Is good to give to night-blind races or to use yourself if you started as an Erudite or human(Although if you are a begginer you probably did what I said and started as a gnome or high elf, which means you all ready have infravision). <br><br>Staff of Warding - summons an 8/38 staff with a couple charges of glimpse(which always you to see farther). It really doesn't have much use except to play around with the glimpse spell it comes with(or you can give it to a low level newbie...is a good weapon for a newbie). This spell can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Level 16 pets - At this level I would suggest buying all the pets. Also at this level you can not buy all the pets in your guild. The level 16 and 20 pets must be bought in OOT(the ocean of tears). I forget which island has the vendor that sells the pets, so ask around. <br><br>Shielding - An upgrade to your lesser shielding spell. keep it on at all times. The extra hp and ac can save your life if you need to tank and its a close battle. <br><br>Phantom Leather - this spell boots your AC and also lets your regen your HP a little faster. It is good for if you are going into a tough battle where you will probably have to tank. <br><br>At level 16 you get the ability to start researching. Go to your guild and put one point into your researching skill and it will be maxed until level 20(there is a bug where after putting a point in at your guild it raises your skill higher then its suposed to). Of all the pure casters, magicians have it the hardest when it comes to researching. They have to combine old spells, a word, and an item to make scrolls they can use. I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about researching becuase it would take a LONG time to explain. So go to castersrealm.com and look at the magician research stuff. Hehe if you are a newbie first starting out, feel lucky. When i first started the game resarching was nearly impossible. Since then, however, they have made it easier(although it is still fairly hard). <br><br>Okay Now back to the hunting guide. At level 16 venture to Lake rathe. Here you will find a bunch of aviak guards that are level 16-20. For their level, they aren't that hard. At level 16 you will be able to take level 20 aviaks. This is also the level when you should start grouping. Almost all the aviaks in this zone are close together, and will attack you at the same time. The only time you will want to solo when hunting them is if you are at the single aviak spawn, or at the entrance to the arena zone where you can take the two aviaks one at a time. However this isn't always possible, as they are sometimes camped, so you will have to group with another person(or two other people if you want to take the 3-spawn aviaks). Aviaks are pretty good loot dropping up to 3pp and FS(fine steel) weapons which will sell for about 5pp each at the ogre vendors in the zone(don't worry even though they are ogres they sell to everyone). The aviak guards also drop words which you can use to research some of your level 16 spells(if you didn't buy them already). <br><br>Fighting aviak guards will get you to level 20 pretty quickly. It is easily the best place for yuor level, I really can't even think of any other place that comes close to how nice this zone is. Some people will tell you that Oasis is a good zone for this level, but I totally disagree with that. it is severely overcrowded, the loot sucks, and there are specter and sand giant trains all the time. When you get to level 20 its time for new spells! Here is the list of spells: <br><br>Bolt of Flame - this spell does MASSIVE damage and has a VERY long range too! But be careful, it has a huge taunt rate so you will usually want to use an earth or air pet when soloing becuase of their root/stun spells. Also you have to have a clear line of sight for it too work. <br><br>Elemental Shield - a fairly useful buff for things that cast spells. Raises your cold and fire resistances. <br><br>Spear of Warding - summons a magical spear that has a small fire and cold resist+ tacked on to it. Not all that usefull. Give it to a newbie or a a rogue without a magic piercing weapon. can also be given to pet, but once you hit 29 and get your rune swords, it becomes useles to give to pets. It can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Renew Summoning - this is a very nice upgrade to your level 8 pet-only healing spell. Use it when your pet is low in HP or if your mana is full and your pet's hp isn't full. <br><br>Summon Arrows - this spell summons a bunch of magical arrows. Give them to people that use bows and don't want to spend money making or buying arrows. Fairly useful. Can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Summon Waterstone - this summons a stone with a charge of enduring breath, which makes you able to breathe under-water. Great for when you want to go to kedge keep at higher levels, or just to keep in your inventory incase you for some reason get caught under-water. It can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Shield of Flame - an upgrade to your level 8 damage shield. Definately use it to buff yuor pet before you attack something or in a group on the tanks. <br><br>Rain of Fire - an area effect spell. Is useful when your group wants to take multiple mobs and their is no enchanter around to mezz the extras. Be careful though, it will get the monsters mad at you. It is limited in its use. <br><br>Level 20 pets - I suggest that you buy all of the pets at this level. You can't buy them all at your guild. You have to go to the merchant in OOT on one of the islands to get the rest that aren't sold at your guild. <br><br>Now the level 20 fighting place - SOUTH KARANA!!!! This zone has TONS of stuff in it. At level 20 there are many things you can do. First off is the aviak city. The aviaks here anywhere from about levels 15-30. Get a group and kill rooks that spawn on the bottom, or go up to the penthouse. Splitpaw - right outside the dungeon of split paw there are three spires and a hill. Level 24-29 gnolls spawn here. If you are able to get in a group the exp. is pretty decent. Treants, these things are pretty good exp. and VERY good loot. They are heavily camped though, so you might have to wait to get in a group. Alsom treants drop your faction with druids and with qeynos, so don't kill them if you don't want to be KOS at the druid rings or in qeynos. Centaurs, these guys can be good exp. and drop some nice items too. The best place to hunt them is near the centaur outpost. Many will wander by the outpost. You will be able to solo any that don't con red. If you get in a group with someone that can track it is even better because sometimes the pickings get slim and having someone who can easily find more make for good exp. Also, there are a couple merchants in one of the stables at the centaur outpost. Sell there. <br><br>The last thing this wonderful zone offerrs....the hermit. In the middle of nowhere is alevel 20 ranger. He is VERY good exp. Why? becuase he has a 3 MINUTE SPAWN. Not only that but the loot he drops isn't bad. PLUS, sometimes he drops FS two-handed weapons which you can give to your pet to make them do 24 damage a hit. The only problem is that he sits in a hut with a door that won't open. To pull him out go near the chimney of the house, have no one targeted, and say 'kill you'. After doing that a few times he will attack you through the wall and your pet will go after him. You won't be able to use your level 20 bolt spell the first time you attack him becuase it won't go through the wall. use your level 16 DD that will still hit him. I HIGHLY suggest that you use a water or air pet to camp him. Why? Becuase since he repsawns every 3 minutes, your earth pet will never be able to regen in time, only your water or air pet will be able to keep up(well the fire pet could keep up too, but you don't want to use him here, dies way too fast). After you kill him the first time you won't need to say 'kill you' anymore. As soon as he spawns again just target your pet and type /assist. Then the hermit will auto maticcaly be targeted and you can pull him out of the house using your level 16 DD, and then once he teleportes out of the house you can use your level 20 DD. However, if you are using a water pet and not an air pet, try to keep him in the house, pull him with your level 16 DD and then send your pet in, and then burn with caution so he stays on your water pet and does teleport out to attack you. If you are using an air pet it is fine to pull him out becuase the air pet will stun him and let you DD. <br><br>With everything it has to offer South karana will be able to get you to level 30. You can easily get from level 20 to 27 just soloing the hermit. If the hermit is camped by someone ele you can always do centaurs, gnolls ouside of splitpaw, and aviaks. Plus once you get to level 24 you can go INSIDE spiltpaw with a group for decent exp.  If you don't mind losing faction with the druids and qeynos you can also kill treants which are a VERY good money source. Even better than the treants is the druid ring in east karana(acctually not that far away). Here there will be 3 druids (and sometimes you will get a few treants) that respawn every 3 minutes. It is WAYYYY better than the south karana treants, but you need more people to hold it down, and its more dangerous. However, if you can get 4 casters(including you), in their mid to high 20's together, you will get AMAZING EXP and INSANE LOOT. Of course you have to be willing to becoming KoS in qeynos and at all the druid rings.<br><br>Once you get to level 30 you can go out and do whatever you want. Level 30 is the first 'hell' level so leveling to level 31 will take you a while. Also on the level 24 and 29 spells....buy ALL of them. Once you get to these levels simply buy ALL of your spells. You will be grouping more and more, and you never know when you might need a spell that would seem worthless to you if you were soloing. Also, most of the level 24 and 29 pet spells can't be bought and MUST be researched. You should be able to do all right without researching extra pets, but you should always try to get all of your pets. Also, when you get to level 29 ALWAYS give your pet two rune swords that you are able to summon once you get to level 29(unless you can get two gnoll hide lariats, or a combination of a gnoll hide lariat and a rune sword). They will make your pet do a lot more damage(or stun sometime in the case of the lariats). <br><br>At level 29/30 get two gnoll hide lariats. Go to Rathe mountains. Summon an air pet, buff it with burnout 2, and give him the two gnoll hide lariats. Now go solo giant skelatons and cyclops's(how the heck do you say the plural of cyclops??????). Anyway, against the giant skelatons it will be VERY easy...send your pet in and then cast your level 24 Shock spell 3 times. The massive stun proc the air will do with the lariats combined with his own stun will easily keep the skelatons on him no matter what you do. Just make sure you outdamage your pet so you get full EXP. for the kill. You could have taken these giant skelatons at level 24 without many problems, but there are A LOT of wandering cyclops's in the zone, and they will have killed you at level 24. If you are gonna solo cyclops's at level 29 you won't want to do a huge burn so quick, becuase the are an avaerage of 5 levels higher than giant skelatons and won't get stunned as much. They will get stunned a fair amount of the time though. Just Blast when needed and Try to outdamage your pet without the cyclops aggroing on you. Also, instead of using and air pet you can use an earth pet and give it two rune swords, or if you can't get enough gnoll hide lariats, give your air pet two rune swords. You can get to level 34 soloing giant skels/cyclop's and then from 34 to 39 just on cyclops's (at level 34 cyclop's become pretty easy and you will be able to kill them quickly). <br><br>Also at level 34 you can start killing Hill Giants, Sand Giants, Specters, and Griffons that don't con red(if they con yellow you still might not want to do it). They are all pretty good exp. and loot(especially the giants). Also at level 34 you can start taking city guards. They are level 30-35 in most places, with the best spot to hunt them being butcher block(dwarf guards) and steamfont(gnome guards). All these things can level you from level 34 to 45 or 46, or 39 to 45 or 46 if you kept killing cyclops's at 34. The guards especially.<br><br>Now something else you will be doing a lot at this level is grouping. Starting at level 24 you should start grouping. All the soloing strategys I listed above are not the only ways to go. Grouping in Upper guk, Lower guk, Solesk A and B, Splitpaw, Mistmoore, Unrest, and other dungeons can work very well sometimes. Plus, once you get to about level 44 you will want to group A LOT. As a magician your role in the group will be to dish out a lot of damage via your pets, DD spells, and damage shield. You should start grouping as early as possibly to learn to to fight well in a group. As I said, once to get to your mid-40's, grouping will become essential. It becomes a lot harder to solo. However if you do want to solo from the mid-40's to 50, Seafury Cyclops's in OOT and high level giants(ice giants in everfrost) would be your best bet. However I wouln't suggest that too highly consdiering that the exp. won't be as good as getting in a good group.<br><br>I currently do not have the expansion so I don't know exactly what its like post-50. However I hear soloing is VERY difficult, and you WILL want to get into groups. Heh, its sort of lame that I don't have the expansion. The reason is becauce my video card isn't good enough and my parents don't feel all that well about paying $100 for a videa card for a 'game'. Hehe rofl....not quite 18 yet. Ah well....Thanks for reading this guide.<br><br>Corpusnuntia/Divineshadow/Natalos/Naltec/Plantmaster/Zuranthium/Sunsong <br><br>Player of many characters on the Nameless server. <br><br>Give me a good rating for this one! Took me two hours to write! Also sorry about the spell/grammer mistakes. I am sure I made some, but I didn't have time to check em. *wave* <br><br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>From my hunting experience on wisp island, it could get VERY uncomfortable at level 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Main reason is the wisps tend to circle the island and walk around the coast in bands.  More than one wisp on a level 8 wisp can equal out to pain and ouchies in a hurry.  Don't kill anything with kedge in the name there, makes the kerrans go sadistic on you.<br><br>Level 15 Monk in Lake Rathe:  Named Jonah Brucker or Brunker can't remember.  Damage shield works well here.  He has the same spawn time as Trissa Whistlesong, water and minor gems for loot, but rarely camped as most people don't consider the loot worth it.  Same exp as Trissa though.<br><br>One thing Corpusnuntia didn't mention is the bard Trissa Whistlesong in West Freeport in Hogcaller's Inn.  She is level 15, hits for low damage (comparatively) and only has one attack per round.  It MIGHT be possible for a level 12 magician to kill her, my experience is from a druid and I imagine it would be possible.  You will have TERRIBLE competition for this spawn, but the reward is awesome experience and at least 1pp in loot every time.  Another downside is negatory faction with Guards of Qeynos, Knights of Truth, and Antonican Bards.  This is not a massive hit though, my druid hunted her from 14 until 19 and is dubious to bards.<br><br>Hermit in SK:  Lots of competition!  Hits for 42 and double attacks, throws in a kick every couple of rounds.  About 1 in 6 times he will drop an FS: Scimitar, Shortsword, Longsword, or 2 Handed Sword.  Might drop the bastard and broadsword too, never had them in my experience.  He sometimes drops magician research items (pearl shard, ice of vellious), but do not count on these.  Great experience, gets mind numbingly boring.<br><br>Guards:  Take the time to learn which guards are uber newbie guards and which ones aren't.  Choice Butcherblock hunting is npc's not guards, seen a 51 magician friend die to a guard there, at some places it has a chance of being an uberguard or a normal guard (Delin's hut)  These npc's used to be really camped but people have seemed to calm down.<br><br>Aviak guards are not sometimes camped, they are 99.9% of the time camped.  Can be good exp though.<br><br>I told Zuranthium about the dwarf skeletons in Butcherblock ;)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The easiest way to level from 44 to 48 is to kill spectres and sand giants in oasis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only do you get fast experience, but you can make 100pp/hour just by killing them.<br><br>Seafury Cyclops's in OOT might give better experience but they have around 4000hp which is a full mana drain for a lvl 44-47 mage.  Not only that, but they resist the fire dd's somewhat so they arent the best thing to solo.  However grouped vs sea furies is much faster experience.<br><br>Ice giants are a good idea because they are the same level but more susceptible to fire attacks.  Not only that, but they are much easier to kill with jboots since everfrost is a big running zone unlike OOT (island).<br><br>Escape in everfrost is easy compared to escaping an island.<br><br>I'm still in oasis about to get 47, but watch out because those spectres are very easy to train.  And 3 or 4 can wreak havoc on many newbies in the zone.<br><br>SG's go down pretty fast if using an earth pet and shock of swords (44 dd magical).  Usually 4 shocks + pet with fire shield takes care of the problem.<br><br>Each spec usually takes 2 shocks and pet with fire shield, sometimes a Blaze (34 dd fire) is needed to finish a spec off.<br><br>Specs (1.5-1.8khp) Sg's(2-2.3khp)<br><br>Two to three specs can be killed per mana bar or upto two sg's.  <br><br>Great exp for the small downtime and its always nice to get a lockjaw now and then.<br><br>Very nice and informative post Zuranthium, just lengthy and a possible spoiler for mages who want to do some exploring of their own :)<br>&nbsp;<br>Eendyar Soulseeker<br>46'th High Elf Mage <br>"Mythic Synergy"<br><a href="http://www.mythicsynergy.com" target=_new>http://www.mythicsynergy.com</a><br>Fennin Ro</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Thanks for the reply to my post Edndyar. I talked about killing spectors and the like in my guide, however I didn't recommnd doing it to your level. The problem I found with these guys, was that at level 46, over half of them were conning green, giving no exp. for the kill, or signficantly less. <br><br>Also, Oasis is ALWAYS really crowded and these things are HIGHLY camped, so thats sort of why I suggested Sea Furies. There usually won't be anyone at the seafuries. So even though it takes a lot longer to kill them, and you have a lot more downtime. You will be getting more exp. then if you were at Oasis, forced to group with a couple other people becuase its so crowded, and not getting exp.(or barely any) every other pull becuase they con green.<br><br>Also you mentioned something about not hunting Seafuries becuase their magic resist to fire was high. Well I won't suggest trying to take seafuries until level 44, which is when you get your new shock DD that isn't fire based.<br><br>I hope you like my guide. As you said it is 'a possible spoiler', however this is just a GUIDE and I would have to smack the person that did everything step by step, level by level, to what I said in here. I personally like to explore, which is how I found a few of the places that I listed in my guide, so I definetely wouldn't want any newbie to think its not good to travel and explore.
