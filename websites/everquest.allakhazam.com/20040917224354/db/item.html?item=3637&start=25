It as full spoilers and complete details on every segment of the quest. If you find this walkthough to be missing anything, please contact me by email [&lt;crydee@monsterweb.org&gt;.]<br>Although it is possible to do portions of the quest out of order, this walkthrough assumes that you complete each part before moving on to the next section. Just in case you have done portions of the quest out of order, I have made note of what items you would have if you have been doing the quest in the exact order listed here and which of those are required to complete that part of the quest.<br>NOTE: If at any point in the quest you need to use sneak to deal with an NPC, you will need to use sneak again at all later encounters. Although I will suggest using sneak the during the first encounter with a potentially problematic NPC, you will need to remember to use it again for later encounters. This mostly concerns Kinlo Strongarm and Mairee Silentone.<br><br>Part 1: Obtain the Shiny Tin Bowl<br><br>Telin Darkforest in Burning Woods, Kunark<br>Telin Darkforest can be found near the zone to Skyfire Mountains. The easiest way to find him is to head to the North East part of the zone, towards Skyfire, and you should eventually pick him up on tracking.<br>You say, 'hail Telin Darkforest'<br>Telin Darkforest looks at you serenely. 'Hello, wanderer.'<br>You say, 'what are you doing in this forest'<br>Telin Darkforest says 'Mighty this place must have been, once. Now scarred by hatred and suffering. I have been sent here seeking answers to problems not yet understood.<br>You say, 'what answers'<br>Telin Darkforest considers you for a few moments before speaking. 'A great evil walks across the land. The hand of some demon we don't yet know is twisting and polluting forests.'<br>You say, 'what evil'<br>Telin Darkforest says 'If I knew that, I wouldnt be here looking for answers. I would be elsewhere, looking for solutions. For now, I suspect much but know little.<br>You say, 'what do you suspect'<br>Telin Darkforest looks at you and sighs. 'The lands are changing. Beasts, large and small, have turned upon those who watched over them. Druids and rangers, worshippers of both Karana and Tunare, have reported a feeling of hatred throughout their once peaceful lands.'<br>You say, 'perhaps it is Innoruuk'<br>Telin Darkforest raises his eyebrow slightly and a subtle look of surprise creeps across his face. 'Innoruuk? Perhaps. Aye. It must be. Perhaps I knew and didn't want to consider the possibility. It must be this though, and some action will have to be taken.'<br>You say, 'what action should I take'<br>Telin Darkforest looks at you consideringly and then scribbles something quickly on a small, worn paper. 'You seem powerful enough. Perhaps you can help those who seek to protect nature's peace. Take this note. Deliver it only into the hands of Faelin Bloodbriar. Where you will find her, I cannot say. She is a friend of mine and a wanderer. She has been seen from one end of the lands to the other. Seek her out, and quickly.'<br>Telin Darkforest gives you a "Worn Note" to take to Faelin Bloodbriar.<br>Worn Note<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>WT: 0.1<br>Class: ALL<br>Race: ALL<br><br>Faelin Bloodbriar in Greater Faydark, Faydark<br>Faelin Bloodbriar spawns at POS 1500, POS 500 in Greater Faydark. Her placeholder is an orc pawn. Faelin is a rare spawn. Just hang around this area and kill all orc pawns you see around the area. Once you see either Faelin or an orc pawn spawn, you can procede to camp just that spot and not worry about additional orcs.<br>Give Telin&#8217;s note to Faelin<br>Faelin Bloodbriar reads the note carefully and growls to herself. 'Bad news, eh? Take this ring. There is one elf, dark elf even, who we must go to in order to gather insight into Innoruuk's plans. Giz X'Tin, he goes by most commonly. Kithicor seems to be his favorite haunt and most likely you will find him there. Don't ask how I know him. Just take the ring as my sign to him and he will speak to you. We don't need to speak again, so dont seek me out, just goto Telin. I must leave to investigate these events.'<br>Faelin Bloodbriar gives you "Faelins Ring" to take to take to Giz X'Tin.<br>Faelin's Ring<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>WT: 0.1<br>Class: ALL<br>Race: ALL<br><br>Giz X`Tin in Kithicor Forest, Antonica<br>Giz X'Tin is a wandering spawn that has been mostly seen towards the north end of the zone. He said to spawn around POS 1000, POS 1500. It is known that he does wander the zone. I have seen hin on track durning the day and night time. The easiest way that I have found to find him is to run along the way between West Commons and Rivervale. If he is up, you will most likely pick him up on tracking. Most likely your faction with Giz X'Tin will not be high enough, cast Spirit of Wolf on yourself, run up behind him and sneak before you give him Faelin's Ring.<br>Give Faelin&#8217;s Ring to Giz X'Tin<br>Giz X`Tin flips you a coin after he recognizes the ring. 'It seems we have a mutual 'acquaintance.' The coin repays an old debt. You don't have to worry about what that is. Luckily, Lord Innoruuk has informed me of your coming and your desires. Fortunately, I have all the answers you require right here at the end of my friend's blade. I think I'll be paying my old 'friend' a visit.'<br>Teir`Dal Reaver says 'Lord Innoruuk, I have failed you. Forgive me and spare me from service to your undead minions in the world!<br>Giz X'Tin gives you a "Dark Metal Coin" to take to Telin Darkforest.<br>Dark Metal Coin<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>WT: 0.1<br>Class: ALL<br>Race: ALL<br>A Teir'Dal Reaver will spawn when you get the Dark Metal Coin. There is no reason to kill the reaver here unless you want some fun. He drops nothing and you already have the coin for the next part. The reaver is said to be level 50 exactly and tough to fight. I just got the coin and ran.<br><br>Telin Darkforest in Burning Woods, Kunark<br>Give coin to Telin<br>Telin Darkforest scratches the coin as he looks at it. 'Faelin sent you to Giz? Surprising. This coin speaks to the outcome of your talk. He would hardly give this bit of metal to a stranger, but that's a story for a different time. So, you say Giz did confirm Innoruuk's involvement, and something about undead minions? Here, take this coin back. Find Arch Druid Althele in the Karanas and show her that. Tell her what we have discussed. She will look kindly on an ally in this matter.'<br>Telin Darkforest gives you a "Worn Dark Metal Coin" to take to Althele.<br>Worn Dark Metal Coin<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>WT: 0.1<br>Class: ALL<br>Race: ALL<br><br>Althele in East Karana, Antonica<br>NOTE: Do not procede with this part until you are ready to deal with the Dark Elf Corruptor and two Dark Elf Reavers that will spawn. If you fail to kill the Dark Elf Corruptor you will have to the start quest over from the beginning.<br>Althele can be found close to the Barbarian Village around NEG 3650, NEG 1600. Tholris and Fang should also be there with her. If you see any of the other druids with her, do not give her the coin right away. First check to see if someone is currently in the process of doing this part of the quest. If this is the case, just wait for them to finish up. Althele, Tholris and Fang all respawn thirty minutes after all the druids have been despawned. The other possibility, is that someone had tried to do this part of the quest, failed and the spawn is messed up. If this is the case, you may have to wait for the server till after the server goes down again to be able to the quest.<br>You say, 'hail Althele'<br>Althele says 'Hello, friend. Beautiful is what I would call such a day normally but lately?<br>Give Coin to Althele<br>Althele looks at the coin and nods gravely at you as she slips it into a fold of her clothing. 'I see. The story of this coin speaks much to me as do the words you have given me. Telin sent word that you would arrive. The tidings you bring are ill indeed. Here, take this amulet and find Sionae. She is nearby. We will speak more on this matter when all are present.'<br>Althele gives you a "Braided Grass Amulet" to take to Sionae.<br>Braided Grass Amulet<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>WT: 0.1<br>Clas: ALL<br>Race: ALL<br>You say, 'hail Tholris'<br>Tholris stares in contemplation at the landscape.<br>Althele says 'Tholris does not speak much. He is here to assist me in my duties. He is my hands, as Fang is my eyes.<br>Fang barks in response to Althele's words.<br>You say, 'why do you need him as your hands and fang as your eyes?'<br>Althele says 'Yes. I cannot see any longer, my sight long since lost in the march of years. By the blessings of Tunare and Karana, though, I still make myself useful.<br>Sionae spawns after you get the Braided Grass Amulet and can be found around NEG 2300, NEG 930.<br>Give amulet to Sionae<br>Sionae says 'I see that the time has come. Take the amulet and give it to the third of our kin, Nuien. I will meet you at the gathering.<br>Sionae gives you a "Frayed Braided Grass Amulet" to take to Nuien, who spawns near NEG 3650, NEG 300.<br>Frayed Braided Grass Amulet<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>WT: 0.1<br>Class: ALL<br>Race: ALL<br>You need to move quickly to Nuien. People who are Kill on Sight to druids may walk past him because of where he spawns. If this happens, Nuien will argo on that person. I do not know if he will argo on any hostile mobs in the area, but it is best to move quickly and not take that chance. If Nuien is killed, the spawn will be messed up and you will have to start all over. Even if Nuien argos on someone, you can still give him the Frayed Braided Grass Amulet. He will then start walking to the gathering place and Teloa will spawn.<br>Give amulet to Nuien<br>Nuien says 'So be it. Do as you have done before and find the next. Teloa is the last.<br>Nuien gives the "Frayed Braided Grass Amulet" back to you, and Teloa spawns near the waterfall around NEG 3800, NEG 2860.<br>Give amulet to Teloa<br>Teloa begins walking toward the gathering spot. 'Follow me to the gathering now.'<br>Follow Teloa back to where Althele is, which is where the druids are gathering. You will not have the amulet at this point as she does not return it to you.<br>Althele says 'Great mother of life and father of sky, growth and spirit, Tunare and Karana. Innoruuk once again schemes and we have failed in our duties to protect our land. We give our powers in sacrifice for your help. Heed our call and send us your wisdom.<br>Althele snaps her head towards you. 'Innoruuk's brood is upon us. Go, find the spawn of hatred before they reach this point and destroy them!'<br>Dark Elf Corruptor and several Dark Reavers spawn, level supposed to be 50ish. Only the Corruptor is said to have to be killed. It is recommended that you root him, so he does not despawn on you. Additionally, it has been mentioned that he cannot be pulled, so you have to rush in and attack him.<br>Dark Elf Corruptor shouts 'We come for you, fools. Your reign of weakness over the powers of the land comes to an end now!<br>The easist way to do this is to have two group of people waiting on the hill. The first group will attack the Dark Elf Corruptor immediately. The second group will kite the Dark Elf Reavers to keep them distracted until the Corruptor has been killed. Even though you will miss most [or all] of the fighting, you should be one of the people in the group killing the Corruptor just so that you will be able to loot his corpse right away and get the "Fleshbound Tomb."<br>Once the Dark Elf Corruptor is killed, the group killing the Corruptor will take out the reavers. Even though some advocate killing the corruptor and letting the reavers get the druids. I don't recommend this for several reasons. First off, it is not within the theme of the quest to let the druids get killed.

[Note: This part is optional. It is here to give you a clue as to what eventually needs to be done with the hammer.]<br>Kinlo Strongarm examines the hammer respectfully, admiring its craftsmanship. He strikes it against his anvil and winces as a howl fills the air. 'This is one of the ancients' hammers? I can almost, well, almost hear it callin ta me. It's strong, that's fer sure, lad. I don't know how ye got it, but aye, a dwarf could make a mighty blade with this. It's lookin like this thing still has its owner inside it though. I'm not knowin how, and not wantin to know, but fer yer own good ye better find some way ta get 'im out.'<br>Kinlo gives you back the "Soulbound Hammer," which identifies as Hammer of an ancient dwarf.<br>Soulbound Hammer<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>Skill: 1H Blunt Atk Delay: 50<br>DMG: 2<br>WT: 5.0<br>Class: RNG<br>Race: ALL<br><br>Mairee Silentone in Eurdin, Odus<br>Mairee Silentone is in the jewlrey shop near the bank. She is at the back of the store. If your faction with her is less than indifferent, stand behind her and use sneak.<br>You say, 'What ancient hammer?'<br>Mairee Silentone says 'Yes, the ancient hammer. I heard something about that. Do you mind if I take a look at it?'<br>Give Mairee Silentone the "Soulbound Hammer," which identifies as Hammer of an ancient dwarf.<br>Mairee Silentone makes a few marks on the hammer, and all the while you can hear a muffled cursing coming from the hammer head. 'Yes, it is an ancient dwarf's hammer. Interesting artifact. I've marked it to keep it stable while you retrieve something for me. You need to travel to the Plane of Air and find a swirling sphere of color. Bring it and the hammer back to me.'<br>Mairee Silentone gives you the "Dwarven Smiths Hammer," which identifies as Hammer of an ancient dwarf.<br>Dwarven Smiths Hammer<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>DMG: 2<br>WT: 5.0<br>Class: RNG<br>Race: ALL<br><br>Plane of Air<br>The Swirling Sphere of Color drops on either Island 4 or 5 [depending on if you count Djorn's Island.] To get to Island 5, you must do all the previous islands in order. Since Island 2 [Djorn] may be skipped, it is not always counted. The Islands are: <br>Fairy <br>Djorn <br>Azarack <br>Gorgalisk <br>Pegasus & Griffons <br>Spiroc <br>Bazzazzt <br>Sister of Spire <br>Eye of Veeshan <br>The way the mobs work on this island is that you will first see Level 52 mobs. When these are killed, they split int two new mobs that are Level 54. When the Level 54 mobs are killed, they split into two new mobs that are Level 56. One of the Level 56 mobs will be an "Essence Tamer Griffon," which is the mob that drops the Swirling Sphere of Color, and it drops it every time.<br>The Plane of Air can only be reached by the Level 46 Wizard spell "Alter Plane: Sky." This spell does require a reagent to be cast called "Cloudy Stone of Veeshan." This reagent can only be purchased at the 3rd floor of the City Library of Erudin and costs around 200-250PP depending on your faction.<br>Go to Island Five of the Plane of Air. Kill the Essensce Tamer to get the "Swirling Sphere of Color," which identifies as Magic Sphere from Plane of Air. This will require a major guild raid to complete. If your guild can handle Venril Sathir, it should be able to handle this.<br>Swirling Sphere of Color<br>Magic ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>Class: ALL<br>Race: ALL<br><br>Mairee Silentone in Eurdin, Odus<br>Give Mairee Silentone the Dwarven Smiths Hammer and the Swirling Sphere of Color.<br>Mairee Silentone holds the sphere and makes intricate marks and patterns on it, eventually turning the entire crystal clear. She rolls it across the hammer, raising a ringing sound in the room. 'There. Now take the hammer back to Kinlo. He'll know what to do from here. Good luck to you .'<br>Mairee Silentone gives you the "Hammer of the Ancients," which identifies as Hammer of an ancient dwarf.<br>Hammer of the Ancients<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>Skill: 1H Blunt Atk Delay: 40<br>DMG: 2<br>WT: 5.0<br>Class: RNG<br>Race: HUM ELF HEF<br><br>Kinlo Strongarm in Kaladim <B>, Faydark<br>Give Kinlo Strongarm the Hammer of the Ancients, which causes Usbak the Old to spawn.<br>Kinlo Strongarm looks at the hammer and nods once before slamming the head against his anvil, and shattering the head. In a cloud of dust, another dwarf appears from the cloud and tosses you a hunk of metal. Kinlo stares in awe.<br>Usbak the Old gives you "Small bit of Mithril Ore," which identifies as Small bit of Mithril Ore.<br>Small bit of Mithril Ore<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>WT: 3.0<br>Class: ALL<br>Race: ALL<br>You say, 'hail Usbak the Old'<br>Usbak the Old says 'Took ya long enough! Ye'd think ya had an orc head on them shoulders there. I'm owin' ya for yer help though. Else I'd have been on that darn hammer for ages. Ye said ya had an ancient blade or somethin ta be smithin. If so lemme see it.<br>If you found it necessary to use sneak to get Kinlo to respond to you favorably, you will need to use sneak with Usbak the Old as well. Give Usbak the Old the Ancient Longsword and he gives you the "Refined Ancient Sword," which identifies as Sword to show Telin.<br>Refined Ancient Sword<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>Skill: 1H Slashing Atk Delay: 20<br>DMG: 8<br>WT: 1.5<br>Class: RNG<br>Race: HUM ELF HEF<br>Usbak the Old admires the blade and then starts to bang the edge with a hammer. 'Hah, that was a good blade, no doubt. Ain't seen one I couldn't make better though. I'm knowin' yer cause and all I know is ye should take that ancient blade ta yer friend in the woods, he'll know what to do now. With that I'm gonna be takin muh leave. Debt paid and all. If'n yer wantin' another blade, which ye do, ye got enough ore left that Kinlo can do it for ye'<br>Usbak the Old despawns. Give the Small bit of Mithril Ore to Kinlo Stirngarm and he forges the "Refined Mithril Blade" for you.<br>Kinlo Strongarm says 'Erm. Well, I aint never worked with this stuff but here's what I got for ya. It ain't bad, pretty much like the one ye got there.

'Now that's fine work. Just a moment, we have a friend here who can enchant one of the blades. Give her the blade the ancient smithed.'<br>Faelin Bloodbriar appears. Give her the Refined Ancient Sword. She enchants it and returns it to you.<br>Faelin smiles at you, then closes her eyes as she sets the gem 'Nature's Balance' into the crossguard and begins to channel her spirit into the sword. The ground rumbles loudly as she casts. She collapses in exhaustion after a short time. 'Take the blade, and perhaps you can finish this. You must strike at Innoruuk's heart. Bring his shattered gem and the mithril blade to Xanuusus. Only with Innoruuk's death can the balance of the land once again be restored. If we do not meet again, remember you always have my eternal thanks.'<br>Swiftwind<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>Skill: 1H Slashing Atk Delay: 21<br>DMG: 13<br>STR: +15 DEX: +5 STA: +10 HP: +50<br>SV FIRE: +5 SV DISEASE: +5 SV COLD: +5 SV MAGIC: +5<br>SV POISON: +5<br>Effect: Swift Spirit<br>WT: 2.0<br>Class: RNG<br>Race: HUM ELF HEF<br>Faelin despawns at this point.<br><br>Strike Directly Against Innoruuk<br>Go to the Plane of Hate and slay Innoruuk for the "Shattered Emerald of Corruption." This will require a guild raid to complete, but should be easy in comparison to some of the other mobs you have encountered. The Shattered Emerald of Corruption is now a random/rare drop from any of the sub-boss mobs in the Plane of Hate. If you are not on a raid to kill Innoruuk, I strongly recommend clearing the entire zone to increase the chances of getting this paticular drop from one of the other mobs.<br>Shattered Emerald of Corruption<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>WT: 0.1<br>Class: ALL<br>Race: ALL<br><br>Xanuusus in North Karana, Antonica<br>You say, 'hail Xanuusus'<br>Xanuusus says 'Greetings, small one! I am Xanuusus of the Stormreapers. You are welcome to rest beneath my mighty branches.<br>Give Xanuusus the Refined Mithril Blade and the Shattered Emerald of Corruption.<br>Xanuusus waves his hands over the gem of corruption and a wave of warm energy passes through the area. With care for such a huge creature, he melds the gem into the sword and seems to glow all over as he channels energy into the weapon. 'Thus is the link of hate broken between Innoruuk and the spirit of earth. Through your will has balance returned. Your deeds, your work for the good of all, will be remembered by anyone who walks beneath the canopy of a forest or roams the plains. Continue your vigil over nature's balance.' <br>Earthcaller<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>Skill: 1H Slashing Atk Delay: 24<br>DMG: 14<br>STR: +15 DEX: +5 STA: +10 HP: +50<br>SV FIRE: +5 SV DISEASE: +5 SV COLD: +5 SV MAGIC: +5<br>SV POISON: +5<br>Effect: Earthcall<br>WT: 2.0<br>Class: RNG<br>Race: HUM ELF HEF<br>The quest has now been completed!<br></p>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
