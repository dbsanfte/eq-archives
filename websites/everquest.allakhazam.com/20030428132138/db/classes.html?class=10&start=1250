	   <tr><td colspan=2>&gt; i was wondering wich skill should i work on 1hs 2hs or Peircing.?<br><br>Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)  Granted 1hs is the typical Ranger road, but better to learn as many weapon skills as you can.<br><br>With 338pp in the bank, you can definitely afford Ice-tooth claws (11/29, 1hs) for about 175-200pp, but since you already have a 1hs weapon, you might want to wait on them until later.  <br><br>Drakkel-forged Bastard Swords (20/44, 2hs) go for 100-125pp, and are more than worth it.  Remember though, that you will only be able to hit for max 29 damage (until lvl 20, when your damage cap comes off.)<br><br>Bloodstained fangs (30-50pp) aren't great weapons at all, but they are cheap :) and for your level they'll do nicely.<br><br>My lvl 25 Ranger uses Ice Tooth Claws in his main hand and a Bloodstained Fang (9/32, piercing) in his off hand.  He also alternates these weapons with a Drakkel-forged Bastard Sword to keep that skill up.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>After following this thread for quite some time, I feel the need to voice my opinions on the subject of rangers.&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel they are very underpowered and unbalanced.  I will elaborate on what makes them underpowered later in this post.  I also believe I should state that I have a level 52 ranger, so the things I say are not said out of malice or jealousy.  They are from experience.  I first started playing my ranger when the game first came out.  At that time, rangers were one of the best classes in the game.  They had the same defense as warriors, and they could wear the best armor in the game (rubicite), and use the best weapons in the game (short sword of ykesha).  In addition, they could can several versatile spells that were inaccessible to other melees.  Those were the good old days, when rangers were actually a valid class.  However, after the release of Kunark, rangers have slowly and steadily gotten the shaft, time and time again.  Let me explain my reasoning.<br><br>Issue 1) Tanking Ability<br><br>A ranger&#8217;s tanking ability is laughable.  They can&#8217;t even tank as well as a rogue, let alone a warrior.  Here are a few numbers to prove my point.<br><br>Defense<br>Warrior: 252<br>Rogue: 252<br>Ranger: 200<br>Ranger-Rogue Deficit: 52 points<br><br>Dodge<br>Warrior: 175<br>Rogue: 210<br>Ranger: 170<br>Ranger-Rogue Deficit: 40 points<br><br>Parry<br>Warrior: 230<br>Rogue: 230<br>Ranger: 220<br>Ranger-Rogue Deficit: 10 points<br><br>Riposte<br>Warrior: 225<br>Rogue: 225<br>Ranger: 150<br>Ranger-Rogue Deficit: 75 points<br><br>Raw AC granted from full suit of Kunark armor<br>(Cobalt, Mrylokar&#8217;s, and Tolan&#8217;s respectively)<br>Warrior: 220<br>Rogue: 155<br>Ranger: 155<br>Ranger-Rogue Deficit: Even<br><br>The warrior numbers are posted just as a reference, I wouldn&#8217;t expect a ranger to tank as well as a warrior, but I&#8217;m sure that these numbers clearly show how utterly horrible a ranger&#8217;s tanking ability is.  A rogue is clearly a superior tank, having a higher defense, and higher dodge/parry/riposte skill caps.  Another point that I should mention is that I am comparing them to a rogue, who isn&#8217;t even suppose to be tanking in the first place.<br>Finally, I was conducting some tests, comparing a ranger to a warrior in tanking ability.  I would attack a single monster, and drag it to a zone line.  I then just let it attack me until I was near death, and then I would zone.  I did this a number of times, and timed how long it took the creature to work me down, then averaged out the times.  I repeated this test with a warrior friend of mine, just to see the difference.  The warrior lasted 3 times longer than I did.  Meaning that the monster would have killed me 3 times over before it would have killed the warrior.  While I understand that a ranger is not supposed to be as good of a tank as a warrior, this seems ridiculous.  A ranger is little more than a speed bump as far as tanking ability is concerned.<br><br>Issue 2) Damage Output<br><br>Well, I was willing to let forget the idea of being a tank, besides, rangers have excellent damage out put right?  Not quite.  A ranger&#8217;s damage output is yet another thing which has fallen by the wayside.  While the patch some time ago raised their offensive skill caps to that of the other melees, it was of little help due to the fact that the other classes simply get better weapons/skills.  A monk or a rogue can easily surpass the damage output of a ranger.  It isn&#8217;t even a contest.  A rogue with double backstab can do unbelievable amounts of damage, as well as having a better weapon selection than a ranger.  The monk with his epic or a runed fighter&#8217;s staff easily out damages a ranger.  And actually, a monk without his epic, using just his bare fists will out damage a ranger unless the rangers has weapons of epic quality or better.  This seems sadly inadequate.  Here are a few numbers to illustrate my point.<br><br>Rogue:<br>Locustlure: 8/17 (35% atk spd decrease proc)<br>Sebilite Croaking Dirk: 10/18<br>Bloodpoint: 10/21 (80 dmg lifetap proc)<br>Ragebringer(epic): 15/25 (40% haste, 40 atk, 9 ac proc)<br><br>Monk:<br>Runed Fighter&#8217;s Staff: 19/20<br>Imbued Fighter&#8217;s Staff: 38/40<br>Fists(no epic, lvl 50): 14/28 (I think, not sure exactly)<br>Fists(epic): 9/16 (clickable 40% haste)<br><br>Ranger:<br>Lupine Dagger: 9/18 (Greater Wolf Form proc)<br>Fayguard Parrying Dagger: 9/17 (29 AE dmg proc)<br>Earthcaller: 14/24 (500dmg 20/tick dot proc)<br>Swiftwind: 13/21 (40% haste, 30 atk proc)<br><br>Issue 3) Utility<br><br>	Even after I realized that I was completely inferior in both tanking and damage dealing ability, I still had hope for my ranger.  I could still do things out of combat that those other melees couldn&#8217;t.  When they took that away from me, it was the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back so to speak.  I stripped down my ranger and sold everything off to start up a warrior.  I just couldn&#8217;t believe what has happened to rangers with the release of Kunark/Velious.  All of the ranger&#8217;s utilitarian spells, which made him a cut above the rest of the other melees are now castable by anybody with the appropriate gear!  Clickable effects on items emulate almost all of a ranger&#8217;s spells.  Here are the most glaring examples.<br><br>Spirit of Wolf:  Journeyman&#8217;s Boots/Traveler&#8217;s Boots<br>Healing/Invigor: Cobalt Breastplate<br>See Invisibility:  Bracer of the Hidden<br>Strength of Earth: Cobalt Boots<br>Invisibility: Cobalt Greaves<br>Infravision: Glowing Stone Band/Cobalt Helm<br>Chloroplast: Fungi Tunic<br>Root: Crystaline Silk Net<br><br><br>The list goes on, but I will not bore you with the details.  I might also add that all of those effects are mana free, where as the ranger has to spend mana to cast his spells.<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>Well, I just don&#8217;t know what else to say.  Rangers can&#8217;t tank as well as others, can&#8217;t deal damage as well as others, and don&#8217;t really have any unique utility to them due to new gear.  Verant has always stated that a class doesn&#8217;t have to be the best at something to be balanced, there just has to be a compelling reason to play the class.  The only problem is, there absolutely NO reason to play a ranger when they are completely and totally outclassed by the other melees.<br>	<br>	If this article keeps even one person from making a ranger, then the time I spent writing it will not be in vein.   It will keep someone from spending weeks upon weeks of played time building up a character just to have his or her hopes shattered.  Moaning mournfully as the cold, hard reality sets in upon them, that they have just wasted months of time building up a ranger.  That all of the time they spent would have been better off playing something other than what I consider to be the absolute weakest class in the game.<br><br>Pire Ashwood 52 Ranger<br>Tarew Marr<br>Born: March 16, 1999<br>Died: September 10, 2001<br>May he rest in peace...<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Good point of the numbers side of the defensive skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do agree that there should be no way a rogue has that much of a differential in defensive skills.  The only thing I could see is the Rogue having a higher Dodge, and the Ranger having a higher Riposte and Parry.  Defense should cap at the same point.<br><br>As to weapons, just go pick up Primal/Priceless if you want to compare endgame weapons.  It all evens out there.  I won't compare the Epics.  Whoever designed them didn't have a clue (Ragebringer is &gt;ungodly&lt; powerful compared to how hard it is to get).<br><br>For damage output, it would be more fair to compare a monk vs a ranger.  Both are designed as "anywhere damage". Ranger, using spells, will outdamage any other melee, except for the backstabbing Rogue of course, when everyone has comparable weapons.  Look at the parsing/logs of the higher level guilds out there.  A double backstabbing Rogue will clean any melee's clock damage output wise.  But no backstabs= a similarily equipped Ranger can outdamage everyone else on a semi-consistant basis.  <br><br><br>"If this article keeps even one person from making a ranger, then the time I spent writing it will not be in vein. It will keep someone from spending weeks upon weeks of played time building up a character just to have his or her hopes shattered. Moaning mournfully as the cold, hard reality sets in upon them, that they have just wasted months of time building up a ranger. That all of the time they spent would have been better off playing something other than what I consider to be the absolute weakest class in the game. "<br><br>*sigh*  Why suddenly do these people develop the "desire" to keep others from "spending weeks and weeks" on a supposidly useless character?<br><br>While this was a well written post (unlike a lot that show up here), and it had some valid points, I fail to believe anyone in the gaming community really cares what other people play.  For EQ, as long as there are an adequate amount of clerics, chanters, and warriors (which are considered the core character classes for higher end encounters), why should you care?  I mean, if everyone plays a ranger which, according to you, sucks so horribly, then that means it will be easier to find a group, to get phat lewtz, and to play the game.  When there is a sudden influx of posts saying the exact same thing (although this one was written much better than the others), it just makes me think someone has a vendetta against a class.<br><br>As to "Ranger's" spells being castable by "anyone" with the proper gear?  Let's see.  Cobalt, Cobalt, Cobalt, Cobalt.  And the BP and Legs you will never see unless you belong to an "Uber" guild who monopolizes the spawns.  A lot of the stuff mentioned are laughable buff wise.  That Shaman is gonna snicker when he throws Strength on you fo +67, vs your Str of Earth for 15.  And sure, Root can be cast from some items.  But how many are you going to farm/carry?  20 uses worth?  100?  And let us not get into item casting times (anywhere from "normal" to 15 times the normal casting time).<br><br>Please, as I stated in other posts, make constructive suggestions for improvements.  Don't just say "Rangers suck, don't play them".  Pointing out weaknesses is fine, but also show ways to correct them.<br><br>Rangers need work at the HIGH END GAME.  So did Rogues.  And Warriors.  And Paladins and SKs.  All the the melee based classes (minus the monk) did/still do.  Some need to be toned down but will not (aka Warriors and Rogues).  But the ones that still need some work, specifically a Ranger, is &gt;far&lt; from a useless character.<br><br><br>Gorthin Spiritcaller<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>There are a few problems with some of your points.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will reply on a point by point basis.<br><br>"As to weapons, just go pick up Primal/Priceless if you want to compare endgame weapons. It all evens out there. I won't compare the Epics. "<br><br>While it is correct that in the end, everybody will be using primal/priceless weapons, the fact remains that a primal/priceless in the hands of anybody else will do more damage.  A rogue with a priceless spear will WAY outdamage a ranger, and a warrior with critical hits will outdamage a ranger as well.<br><br>"For damage output, it would be more fair to compare a monk vs a ranger. Both are designed as "anywhere damage". Ranger, using spells, will outdamage any other melee, except for the backstabbing Rogue of course, when everyone has comparable weapons. Look at the parsing/logs of the higher level guilds out there. A double backstabbing Rogue will clean any melee's clock damage output wise."<br><br>In the end game, this simply isn't true.  Especially the point about a ranger using spells outdamaging any other melee with the exception of rogues.  A ranger's damaging spells will be outright resisted on any high level mob.  Once you take their damage spells out of the equation, what do they become?<br><br>"As to "Ranger's" spells being castable by "anyone" with the proper gear? Let's see. Cobalt, Cobalt, Cobalt, Cobalt. And the BP and Legs you will never see unless you belong to an "Uber" guild who monopolizes the spawns. A lot of the stuff mentioned are laughable buff wise. That Shaman is gonna snicker when he throws Strength on you fo +67, vs your Str of Earth for 15. And sure, Root can be cast from some items. But how many are you going to farm/carry? 20 uses worth? 100? And let us not get into item casting times (anywhere from "normal" to 15 times the normal casting time)."<br><br>I was specificly things that a warrior can use against a ranger's spells, perhaps I should have made that more clear.  A warrior, in my opinion, has the least utility out of any class, they are purely focused on melee.  However, with proper gear, they have the exact same utility spells as a ranger.  That was the point I was trying to make.  And as to the casting times on the items, the cobalt breastplate takes about 13 seconds to cast a 100 point heal.  A ranger takes about 3 seconds to cast a 90 point heal, but then has to med for about 30 seconds to get the mana back.  So who actually is winning this deal?  Finally, you do not have to be in an uber guild in order to get cobalt.  My warrior has a few pieces, and I am not in an uber guild.  Admittedly the breastplate and leggings might be rather difficult to come by, but I can just make due with a fungi tunic and bandages.<br><br>"Rangers need work at the HIGH END GAME. So did Rogues. And Warriors. And Paladins and SKs. All the the melee based classes (minus the monk) did/still do. Some need to be toned down but will not (aka Warriors and Rogues). But the ones that still need some work, specifically a Ranger, is &gt;far&lt; from a useless character."<br><br>Well, at the high end game, I fail to see the use of a ranger.  They don't do damage, they can't tank, and their utility is negated due to gear.  Please, if you see anything useful about the ranger, post it.<br><br>"*sigh* Why suddenly do these people develop the "desire" to keep others from "spending weeks and weeks" on a supposidly useless character?"<br><br>Because I would not want anybody to endure the pain I had to go through of watching their character develop, just to realize that their character is inferior in every way to the other classes.<br><br>"While this was a well written post (unlike a lot that show up here), and it had some valid points, I fail to believe anyone in the gaming community really cares what other people play. For EQ, as long as there are an adequate amount of clerics, chanters, and warriors (which are considered the core character classes for higher end encounters), why should you care? I mean, if everyone plays a ranger which, according to you, sucks so horribly, then that means it will be easier to find a group, to get phat lewtz, and to play the game. When there is a sudden influx of posts saying the exact same thing (although this one was written much better than the others), it just makes me think someone has a vendetta against a class."<br><br>Well, I really do care about what other people play.  I believe that if enough people would stop playing rangers.  That perhaps it will motivate Verant to finally examine rangers, and do something to help this poor, underpowered class.<br>And hes, I do have a vendetta against rangers.  I spent about 48 days of played time building up a ranger to level 52.  And now I realize that I just wasted my time building up the weakest class in the game.  I honestly can't see any reason to play a ranger, other than wanting to challenge of playing an inferior class.<br><br>As for possible fixes to the class.  I really don't know what can pull rangers out of the hole Verant has dug them.  Here are a few things that might help.<br><br>1) Raise defense cap to 230.<br>2) Raise dodge/parry/riposte caps.<br>3) Add some sort of self only haste spell.  This would help to bring their damage output in line with the other melees on high level encounters.<br>4) Add a new "Call of X" spell that makes their weapons proc 50 unresistable damage.<br>5) Add regeneration at level 39.  They already get chloroplast at level 55, but for some reason, they never get regeneration?  Seems weird to me.<br>6) Add strength of stone at level 39.  Again, they already get storm strength at level 53, but somehow, they never get strength of stone?<br>7) Lower jolt to level 39.  This is the level that a ranger's defense caps out.  At this level they really need to be staying out of combat, and controling their aggro.<br><br>Other than that, I don't know.  They have already given away the ranger's utility, which my favorite part of the class.  But these changes would bring a ranger up in tanking ability to just below that of a rogue, and would put them ahead of most melees in damage output.  But even with all those changes, I still don't thing I could be willing to pick up and play a ranger again.  If anybody else has some suggestions, I would like to hear them :)<br><br>Pire Ashwood 52 Ranger <br>Tarew Marr <br>Born: March 16, 1999 <br>Died: September 10, 2001 <br>May he rest in peace... <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Excellent.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am &gt;so&lt; glad this did not turn into a flame war/733t skillz war.  Let me respond to what I see as wrong with your post =)<br><br>"While it is correct that in the end, everybody will be using primal/priceless weapons, the fact remains that a primal/priceless in the hands of anybody else will do more damage. A rogue with a priceless spear will WAY outdamage a ranger, and a warrior with critical hits will outdamage a ranger as well. "<br><br>Unless the Rogue has a higher cap on Dual wield, there is no way a &gt;&gt;non backstabbing rogue&lt;&lt; will out melee a Ranger.  They are equal, and once the Ranger does a little self buffing, he should come out ahead.  Backstab skews everything out of whack.  Even with crits, the Warrior will NOT outdamage the Ranger.  Why?  Defensive Disc.  That is the main reason a Warrior is the tank of choice (and sometimes the only choice) for high end encounters.  Losing 30%+ of your damage output will keep them from outdamaging a Ranger.<br><br>"In the end game, this simply isn't true. Especially the point about a ranger using spells outdamaging any other melee with the exception of rogues. A ranger's damaging spells will be outright resisted on any high level mob. Once you take their damage spells out of the equation, what do they become?"<br><br>But you can't take them out of the equation.  Between a Druid using Ro's, the Enchanter Tashing, and the Shaman/Magician Maloing, you can get spells to stick quite nicely.  For some reason, Calefaction is a beast to resist from what I have seen.  Yes, it has a long delay, but it is a "free" 450 damage.  If you manage to remove the spells, then sure, Rangers would be inadequate.  But in a balanced group, Ranger nukes work just fine with a little debuffing.  Everyone has resist problems (except for Lures from Wizzies), that is why Verant made debuffs.<br><br>"I was specificly things that a warrior can use against a ranger's spells, perhaps I should have made that more clear.

Other cobolt is pricey, but common.  Noone denies Verant screwed up giving warriors spells like that.  That was one balancing feature:  They were dependent on others for magical support.  As to the Invigor right click vs casting Healing, it all depends.  In those 13 seconds, a Ranger can cure 360 damage vs 100.  Yes it eats mana, but it just depends on if you need it or not. It also ties you up for those 13 seconds to get the effect.  That can be bad. Fungi Tunic should not be warrior wearable IMO =)  But yes, with Kunark armor, Rogues and Warriors received some right click abilities they should not have gotten.  Nothing we can do about it now, though.<br><br>"Because I would not want anybody to endure the pain I had to go through of watching their character develop, just to realize that their character is inferior in every way to the other classes"<br><br>We will just have to agree to disagree here.  I do not feel Rangers are inferior in everyway.  Sure, they have some weak points, but properly played in a balanced group, they are killing machines.  VErant still claims this is a group game, so you have to gear yourself that way to get maximum results.<br><br>"1) Raise defense cap to 230. <br>2) Raise dodge/parry/riposte caps. <br>3) Add some sort of self only haste spell. This would help to bring their damage output in line with the other melees on high level encounters. <br>4) Add a new "Call of X" spell that makes their weapons proc 50 unresistable damage. <br>5) Add regeneration at level 39.

At this level they really need to be staying out of combat, and controling their aggro. "<br><br>#1 and #2) I agree with raising the defense cap to at least 225 (no higher than 240), but leave Dodge alone.  Raise parry and riposte to the cap.  Rogues got way too much, and they left the ranger behind on this.<br><br>#3)Swiftwind gives a 40% haste. And most of the time you will either have a Chanter or Shaman to Haste you.  Not to mention a Bard to stack in song haste.  I don't see this one helping any.<br><br>#4)  Call of Sky adds a 35+ a stun proc.  Call of Fire adds a 75 proc.  These are in the game.  Call of Sky is borderline unresistable.  So they kind of already have this.  And Sky procs a buttload for me.<br><br>#5) Druids get Regen at 34, so for a Ranger instead of 39, 49 would be more in line I do think.  Would be a nice bonus, but something to save the class.<br><br>#6) Almost exactly the same as #5, down to the levels =)<br><br>#7)I honestly do not think jolt needs to be lowered in level.  Everyone caps defense at 40 except for pure INT casters.  The problem is 50+, not 1-50.  Aggro control is the key.  And in this case means proper weapon selection, avoiding the taunt button, and know which spells to cast when.<br><br>Honestly, to make Rangers more in line where they should be vs Warriors and Rogues would mean a cap reduction for a lot of Rogue skills, which is not going to happen.  The best we can hope for is a cap raise to equal levels of a rogue on the defensive skills, but Verant will say it is too much, as Paladins and Sks are supposed to be the defensive Hybrids.  A moderate defense increase, along with increasing Riposte and Parry (leave Dodge alone just to appease Verant) would help a decent amount.<br><br>Personally though, I think Rangers are locked into this for the long haul.  It just takes a lot of patience, skill, and adaptability to play a Ranger and squeeze the most out of them.  Just hitting Autoattack, casting snare, and looting won't cut it for this potentially wonderful class.  Hopefully something can be found to help, and it is not a bunch of crappy underpowered spells being released in Luclin =/<br><br>Gorthin Spiritcaller<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Finally, calefaction is not a "free" 450 damage.  It costs 250 mana.  That is about 90 secs of medding just to cast 1 spell.  Considering a rogue can backstab for about that much, or a monk can do about that much in 2 or 3 rounds of combat, all mana free, I don't consider it to be all that impressive.<br><br>"Like I said, Cobolt Legs and BP are the ones you need the "Uber" guild for.

It's true that this game is group oriented game, and that is the main reason I feel the ranger is underpowered.  In my experiences, no group wanted a ranger.  No guild wanted a ranger.  I was forced to solo through my entire career.  Occasionally I could get into a group here and there, but it was mainly because they felt pity for me, not because they needed me.

As to a monk outdamaging a Ranger who is casting, that can only happen if they have a great Tank.  Monks have NO aggro management short of melee distance, weapon selection, and turning off autoattack.  A monk who goes all out will die, and quickly (so would the Ranger in that situation).  As to "natural haste", that only applies to their fists, which never improve beyond 14/26 (Human, level 60).  Anyone should have equivilent/better weapons by that point.<br><br>High end encounters require a Warrior (or multiples) with the defensive Disc.  Noone else can stand in there long enough without it to allow the Clerics to CH them multiple times over the course of a fight that can last 5+ minutes.  Only warriors can do that, which is what makes them &gt;the&lt; tanks.  In a normal xp grind group, most prefer a SK or Paladin as the primary tank, simply because Paladins and SKs can generally hold aggro better than a Warrior, and SKs get FD.  The warrior having a higher AC in most cases doesn't matter on High End Velious and Kunark encounters.  Those MOBS always hit for close to max damage regardless.  Defensive Disc is what keeps the warrior alive.<br><br>"The main problem is I have found with rangers, is that their high level nukes are all fire based (firestrike and calefaction). Next to magic based, fire based is the most commonly resisted form of magic.

Considering a rogue can backstab for about that much, or a monk can do about that much in 2 or 3 rounds of combat, all mana free, I don't consider it to be all that impressive. "<br><br>Druids have this problem as well, but they are solid nukers.  You have to know when you can nuke, and when it is best not to.  As to needing to cast these debuffs to nuke "just to pull their own weight", that is crazy.  Rangers have pure offensive melee equal (caps and weapons wise) to any other class.  If you can't nuke it, then melee it (which is where 85% of your damage should come from anyway IMO.  Overnukking combined with lots of melee damage= too much aggro).  And by "free" damage I meant you do not have to do anything special for it.  Yes, it takes mana.  But what else are you going to do with it?  Mana is there for a reason, to be USED.  If you just sit there and admire that full blue mana bar, it is a waste.  Use the mana (wisely).  And for a Monk to do that kind of damage in 2 or 3 rounds, they are going to need a high end 2h blunt weapon, dual attack each time, and hit each time.  Taking into consideration that the average melee hit ratio is about 65%, it will definately take more than 2 or three rounds to pull that off, in a consistant manner.  Hell, at level 43 with a Arbitor's, if I double attack each round for three rounds and hit on each, my low str Ranger can do 672 damage (112 max per hit or so).  But #1) I will usually not double attack three times in a row #2)I will not hit all 6 times #3)I will not hit for max damage.  That generalization would apply to all melee classes =)  It may happen once in a great while, but not consistantly.  Don't forget, that 450 damage is IN ADDITION to what the Ranger normally does melee wise.  It is not the sole source of damage.<br><br>"Well, it seems that we both agree that Verant messed up horribly when they gave away the ranger's utilitarian spells to everybody. As far as the Invigorate vs Healing goes, a ranger has never been a combat healer. They simply don't heal as fast as a mob can deal damage. Therefore, the Invigorate/Healing would be used almost exclusively during down times. Given that stipulation, I would much rather have a mana free 13 second cast heal spell"<br><br>No, Rangers are not combat healers.  We are downtime reducers, and in a blatant emergency, can combat heal if all else fails.  Granted, Rangers suck at it, but it can be done.  I would like to point out that 95% of the Warrior population won't see a Cobolt BP on the average server, so trying to say an item like that makes a Ranger obsolete is not valid IMO.  Everyone loves mana free healing, but most will see the self only regen items, and Rangers can still project their healing onto others.  *shrug*  If you have it, use it.  If not, well, then you need a Ranger (or other healing capable class) to help.  Before they made duck interrupt instant, once that Cleric started the 10 second Cheal, the Enchanter would hold his breath if there wasn't a secondary healer.  It was rare, but I have seen Rangers successfully emergency heal and pull the monster off the enchanter quicker than taunt ever could.  Like I said, it was rare, but I have seen it =)  <br><br>"The problem I see is that while rangers have numberous weak points, they don't have any strong points. It's true that this game is group oriented game, and that is the main reason I feel the ranger is underpowered. In my experiences, no group wanted a ranger. No guild wanted a ranger. I was forced to solo through my entire career. Occasionally I could get into a group here and there, but it was mainly because they felt pity for me, not because they needed me. But I can't really say I blame them, why would you want a ranger, when you can take a warrior, rogue or monk. "<br><br>A Ranger is a Hybrid, and will not have any "strong" points.  The strongest facets of the class are :Track, offensive output, flexibility.  As to no group wanting a Ranger, I NEVER have a problem finding a group.  It may take 10 minutes, but most groups actually prefer picking up a Ranger as a secondary tank over most others because of the flexibility.  I do not know what server you are on, but Bristlebane is actually quite Ranger friendly.  The reason I would want a Ranger over a Monk or Rogue can range from group balance, needing a SoWer/snarer, needing a tracker, being able to use the spell versatility, to just plain out needing someone with a taunt button.  Others can think of more, but I just woke up and am still gathering my thoughts for the day =P<br><br>I haven't given up, but Verant feels they like the classes where they are for the most part.  Maybe the Rangers will get a few more tweaks, but only Verant knows that.<br><br>Gorthin Spiritcaller<br><br><br><br> <br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>alright in part this is why a ranger sucks major ass:<br>1. Your DD spells blow some major ass, at lvl 22 you get one that does 30DD, ehll if you dont melee for more than 30 dmage by the time your 22, stop playing the game.<br>2. Who cares if you rangers get a heal spell, it costs you rangers about a little more that half a mana bub and it heals you about 30hp at lvl 30.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now correct me if im wrong, but at lvl 30, you have near 900 or so HP, so what that would take you about 30 heals to get to full health which would take even more downtime then if you just let a cleric heal you once.<br>3. As for your snares, thats the only one things you rangers are good at.  Of course, an SK gets a snaring DoT, which is obviously better because it snares and does dmg.<br>4. as for your unique spells vs. an SK's.  There are 3 classes that can track so your isnt really unique anymore, and besides that, what the hel are you going to do track me to death?  As for a Shadow Knight, we get the Skill Harm Touch, which can easily win any battle for us.  I have just learned that it can do even more that 1900 dmg, somewhere in the 2500 range, including the discipline, also the discipline makes in unresistable, so casters and rogues and rangers, your @#%^ed. AS for your archery skills, maybe you do get critical hits, but anyone can train in archery, making critical hits the only thing that would save you, why would a warrior ever use a bow you may ask? When a Ranger thinks he did something smart and rooted him and starts shooting arrows at him.  The warrior can still keep you losing health and once that root wheres off, once again, rangers @#%^ed.<br>6.  Maybe your cheap ass heals are useful, but there not.  Maybe an SK's lifetap is even more useful. At lvl 30, we get a 45dmg lifetap, at 39, we get a 90dmg, at 49 a 150 or so dmg, and at 60 a 330dmg lifetap, dont forget that all of this dmg comes to our own HP decreasing our downtime while bringing some pain on the mob.<br>7.  Your epics suck, they are just like a warriors only with different procs, which according to you guys, the earth call proc gets resisted very often, therefore making the haste the only useful thing.  Now the SK epic, 40/45 with a 330DD Lifetap, that means a double hit of around 140 or so and if the proc kicks in, hell thats 330dmg that you get drained of and any dmg you may have done, gets restored by this.<br><br>So clearly, you rangers blow complete ass when compared to an SK, the only reason ppl still play your class is....i dont know why ppl play your class, maybe its because they enjoy being the underdog and never doing anything important for a change. <br>&nbsp;<br>Kildiar, The Shadow Knight Inoruuk Rejected<br><br>"A warrior's quote once said rangers suck....I agree"</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>First off I want it to be known it is obvious this person is a Troll.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to say a class "sucks", then offer constructive advice as to how they could be fixed.  Otherwise, find something else to do with your time than cluttering up this (or any for the matter) messege board with useless posts.<br><br>Secondly, this will be a long post.  Just a quick warning =)<br><br>Normally, I refrain from responding to this type of post/person, but I am getting tired of seeing this person flood the board in one of multiple login names about how bad "Rangers suck".  This person obviously has no clue about the high end game.  Oh, I am sure they will respond with "STFU n00b33, I hve a 52 dr00d, and I ownz joo with my 733t skillz!?!?!?!!?"<br><br>Do Rangers need work, &gt;&gt;&gt;AT THE HIGHER END GAME&lt;&lt;&lt; ?  Yes, although there have been some improvements.  From 1 to about 54, though, Rangers are quite balanced.  Every class needs some balancing post 54, as Verant never really expected the game to go beyong 50.  The foundation the game is built upon was not designed to handle where they have put the classes and MOBS, aka level 50+.<br><br>As to your points why "Rangers Suck", I guess I should refute them.<br><br>"1. Your DD spells blow some major ass, at lvl 22 you get one that does 30DD, ehll if you dont melee for more than 30 dmage by the time your 22, stop playing the game."<br><br>Wooo, level 22.  Yeah, what a class can do at level 22 is a major factor in whether they suck or not *rolls eyes*.  Anyway, at 22, the Ignite spell does 37 damage, 23% more than you claim.  It also takes a paltry 30 mana, and has a casting time of 2.1 seconds.  This fits nicely inbetween the swings of most weapons that non twinked/non uber twinked people would have at that level.<br><br>If you really want to compare, the SK tap at that level will do 11 hp max.  So by your logic, because at level 22 SKs can only do 11 damage max on their tap, "SKs suck".  I mean, really, if you can't do more than 11 damage by level &gt;22&lt;, come on, stop playing the game.<br><br>What you fail to mention is that at higher levels, Rangers get some downright mean DDs.  Call of flame, Calefaction, Firestrike.  Heck, even Careless lightning at 39 is quite nice for a melee first character. <br><br><br>"2.Who cares if you rangers get a heal spell, it costs you rangers about a little more that half a mana bub and it heals you about 30hp at lvl 30. Now correct me if im wrong, but at lvl 30, you have near 900 or so HP, so what that would take you about 30 heals to get to full health which would take even more downtime then if you just let a cleric heal you once"<br><br>Oh please.  30 mana at level 30 costing half a bubb?  What game have you been playing?  With around a 90 wis, that 30 mana heal costs an average level 30 Ranger 1/4 a bubb.  While at this level it is not great (29 hp healed), it can reduce downtime for the group by healing nicked members.  It can also allow that necro to keep his Hp-&gt;mana conversion spells up in between without having to try to find little stuff to tap.  As to a cleric being able to heal with one spell, how does this make Rangers suck?  Your tap at 30 will heal 45 damage.  So you would need 20 taps to heal the same 900 damage, but you also have to deal with the MOB you are tapping hitting you back.  Unless you are in a newbie zone and can tap something like a Moss Snake, in the process of "healing" the MOB is going to hit you for extra damage and make a SKs lifetaps an impractical way to heal any amount of damage.  Your tap may/should cost a little over half a bubb at 30, maybe that is where you are confused.  And yes, I have a 34 SK, so at least for this level, I know what I am talking about.  A Ranger at level 30 should be able to, or at least come close, heal himself totally in one mana bar.  Can an SK do that?  No.<br><br>"3. As for your snares, thats the only one things you rangers are good at. Of course, an SK gets a snaring DoT, which is obviously better because it snares and does dmg. "<br><br>How long have you been playing?  Let's see.  The darkness line absolutely PALES compared to snare.  Snare has a greater duration.  Snare gets resisted less.  And because snare does NOT do damage, it is more useful, in more situations.  Why?  Ever heard of enchanters Mezzing something?  Good luck trying that if your darkness them.  Snare also has a large (but nice) taunt component.  Snare is probably the #1 spell in the game for overall usefullness.  The darkness line can substitute for snare, but an SK who is having to cast Darkness three times per fight to get it to stick is not doing his job.  Your mana is better spent elsewhere.<br><br>"4. as for your unique spells vs. an SK's. There are 3 classes that can track so your isnt really unique anymore, and besides that, what the hel are you going to do track me to death? As for a Shadow Knight, we get the Skill Harm Touch, which can easily win any battle for us. I have just learned that it can do even more that 1900 dmg, somewhere in the 2500 range, including the discipline, also the discipline makes in unresistable, so casters and rogues and rangers, your @#%^ed. AS for your archery skills, maybe you do get critical hits, but anyone can train in archery, making critical hits the only thing that would save you, why would a warrior ever use a bow you may ask? When a Ranger thinks he did something smart and rooted him and starts shooting arrows at him. The warrior can still keep you losing health and once that root wheres off, once again, rangers @#%^ed."<br><br>Oh, now we are talking PvP.  PvP is so screwed up in EQ, it is not a valid grounds for any arguement, especially if a class "sucks" or not.  Anyway, any class that gets into a bow fight with a Ranger will lose.  Watch a high level Ranger use the Trueshot discipline sometime.   <br><br>"6. Maybe your cheap ass heals are useful, but there not. Maybe an SK's lifetap is even more useful. At lvl 30, we get a 45dmg lifetap, at 39, we get a 90dmg, at 49 a 150 or so dmg, and at 60 a 330dmg lifetap, dont forget that all of this dmg comes to our own HP decreasing our downtime while bringing some pain on the mob. "<br><br>You DO NOT get a new tap at 39.  However, Rangers get careless lightning (70 mana 99 damage 2.7 second casting time).  Your tap at 49 is a QUEST spell, does 280 damage max, takes 315 mana, and can only be cast once every two minutes.  At 51 is when you get your next "normal" lifetap for 75 damage.  Please, at least learn to read a spell list.  Know what our quest spell does at 49?  I assume you still can't read a spell list so I will tell you.  206 damage for 125 mana, with a recast of 18 seconds.  So in your two minutes, you can do 560 damage with your quest tap, and a Ranger can do 1236 damage with his quest spell.<br><br>"7. Your epics suck, they are just like a warriors only with different procs, which according to you guys, the earth call proc gets resisted very often, therefore making the haste the only useful thing. Now the SK epic, 40/45 with a 330DD Lifetap, that means a double hit of around 140 or so and if the proc kicks in, hell thats 330dmg that you get drained of and any dmg you may have done, gets restored by this."<br><br>Epics have NOTHING to do with how the class preforms.  With a few exceptions, Primal/priceless gear from the high end game totally blows away most Epics.  If you are basing the balance of a class on the Epic, well, I won't say it.  Epics are nice to have, but they are not all that.  And who cares about PvP. If it was balanced, then we could talk about it.  Just because a SK is generally better at it (high end especially) does not make it a better class. <br><br>"So clearly, you rangers blow complete ass when compared to an SK, the only reason ppl still play your class is....i dont know why ppl play your class, maybe its because they enjoy being the underdog and never doing anything important for a change."<br><br>People play the Ranger class because:<br><br>#1) The Rare Spawn finding kings. <br>#2) Deal buttloads of offensive damage.<br>#3) Are versatile (offense, defense, utility).<br>#4) They can be quite fun, if you learn how to play the class.  Playing a Ranger (and most classes) takes more than just hitting the autoattack and casting a spell here and there.  Sure you can do it, but a well played Ranger (or any other class) is a wonderful sight to behold.<br><br>Now, if you have constructive advice as to how to make this class more balanced, then please post it.  Otherwise, please quit clogging this board with useless posts.<br><br>Gorthin Spiritcaller<br>51 Shaman BB<br>Davall<br>43 Ranger BB<br>Chugrahk<br>34 SK BB<br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>ok, for your DD spells, use guys are wisdom caster and that means it you will have less mana that an INT caster, so our tap for 11 dmg may not be much, it costs practically no mana&nbsp;&nbsp;at all whereas those @#%^ty DD's cost you guys about 1 blue or maybe even 1.5.  <br>Obviously you have never added INT to your SK. My SK's base INT is at 117 and with my INT gear on it is around 130, that makes my 36 dmg tap, cost me about 1/4 or so of one bub of mana.  Whereas your guys heal may save downtime, it takes you a whole bar, according to you, to heal yourself full, well that means that maybe you did save the healer some mana, but now you have no mana to cast spells making you just a weak warrior for very long time, and since you will no longer have mana, that downtime you saved is now back in use.  As for our taps,  maybe they do have a long recast time, who cares they do better than your heals and thats all that matters.<br>About the darkness, enchanters only really mez when you pull more than one thing.  Now why theh lle would you ast darkness on two things, just cast it on one mez the other, and when your ready to break the mez, just darkness it.<br>Dont diss PvP just cuz rangers blow some major ass at it, and i wasnt saying that a warrior and ranger archery duel was going to be even, i was pointing out that even if you do root and arrow them to death, they can still shoot arrows back and after that root runs out, at lest you wont have full health<br>So i can tell by your respons to the epic that you do realize they suck, and taht the SK epic is much much much better, i aslo forgot to include that it has bash ability on it to interrupt caster.<br>Rangers dont deal as much offensive damage as you think they do. A monk, rogue, and warrior deal more dmg, and near the end of the game, you rangers are at the bottom of the pecking order in damage dealing.  As for rangers being a fun class to play? maybe if your blasted off your ass  and you think its fun to track things and act like a fruity flower sniffing ranger.  And i guess you do realize that a ranger unique skill, track does blow major ass and that HT is sooo much better.<br>&nbsp;<br>Kildiar, The Shadow Knight Inoruuk Rejected<br><br>"A warrior's quote once said rangers suck....I agree"</td></tr>

I also play a 43rd Ranger and from damage output of both in melee, my ranger far outdamages my Sk (sk using MoSS). As for solo ability they are both equal but as in group ability my ranger let just say I can shout for a group as a ranger and get one quick, but as Sk well unless no warrior/monk/ranger are available he might get a pick up group.&nbsp;&nbsp;I enjoy playing my Sk or I wouldnt have invested the time to get to 40th. But in raid situations Warrior is number one tank, then you get damage dealers monk/rogue/ranger and if none of those available you take an sk or pally as back up tank. <br><br>As for Sk's having better epic I think not they are probably about equal due to disparity in weapon skill.  You have to be able to hit mob for it to damage just ask uber raid guild to run a log of damage output by Ranger and Sk and you will see the damage the Sk do in melee is laughable, most of the time they miss or hit for min damage cuz offensive cap sucks for the knight classes.<br><br>So in other words Kildiar, stick to posting on a subject you actually have some knowledge about.<br><br>Cannis 43rd Ranger<br>Razer 40th Shadowknight<br>&nbsp;<br>Cannis 60th Ranger<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ok, first off there is such a thing as the return key to have coherent paragraphs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also the shift key works wonders for capitalization.  Not to mention the occasional punctuation will help get your ideas across.  Let me go through and refute what you have written, yet again.  Another somewhat long post.  This will be my last one, as I am sure that I will not get through to this Troll.<br><br>"ok, for your DD spells, use guys are wisdom caster and that means it you will have less mana that an INT caster, so our tap for 11 dmg may not be much, it costs practically no mana at all whereas those @#%^ty DD's cost you guys about 1 blue or maybe even 1.5."<br><br>A 110 int or a 110 wis generate the same amount of mana. For example, at level 10, a 110 int or wisdom generates 240 mana.  So throw that part out the window.  Now, a level 22 Wood Elf (just for an example) with a Base 85 wisdom will have 418 mana before any other considerations.  Assuming the hybrid spell penalty is 50%, that means each ignite would cost 45 mana, and that is about 1/2 of a blue bubb of mana, not one or 1.5 as you claim.  Throw that part out.  For you to nuke for 37 you have to cast the level 15 tap 4 times (for 44 damage).  4*18= 72 mana.  With the same 240 mana, that comes out to just a hair under a full bubb of mana.  This includes the fact that lifetaps no longer cost SKs extra mana. Ranger 1: Troll 0<br><br>"Obviously you have never added INT to your SK. My SK's base INT is at 117 and with my INT gear on it is around 130, that makes my 36 dmg tap, cost me about 1/4 or so of one bub of mana. "<br><br>Chugrahk.  Ogre SK level 34.  Int 130 with gear.  So at 34, we have the same mana base.  That makes this a little easier =)  Just to clarify, there is not 36 damage lifetap.  It caps at 45 damage, and starts at 39, and costs 63 mana per cast.  Using the mana calculator, at 34, with 130 int that is 952 mana.  That comes out to 15 taps per bar, or 2/3 bubb per tap.  A little simple math can fix a lot, no?<br>Ranger 2: Troll 0<br><br>"Whereas your guys heal may save downtime, it takes you a whole bar, according to you, to heal yourself full, well that means that maybe you did save the healer some mana, but now you have no mana to cast spells making you just a weak warrior for very long time, and since you will no longer have mana, that downtime you saved is now back in use. As for our taps, maybe they do have a long recast time, who cares they do better than your heals and thats all that matters."<br><br>Well, let's see.  If I have to dump a full bar of mana to heal myself (which, btw doesn't happen after level 39 with the new heal), that means the Cleric is OOM or VLOM.  Odds are I am gonna heal to a comfortable amount (read 50%), then sit and med.  I will then ask the cleric if I should continue to heal.  The reason for this is he/she may need to rebuff people.  Because I am not going to have the 200 wis/int a lot of casters do, I have comparatively less mana, so it takes less time for me to med back to 70%+.  If the cleric says keep healing, I will.  And I will still be able to med back up to a workable level before the cleric says ready.  The cleric's 1428 mana vs my 952.  That works out to by the time he meds to full, I can med a full bar +50% over again.  Math, gotta love it.  As to your taps being better than a heal, that is sutuation dependent.  That tap doesn't do anything to save/heal the enchanter who is DoT'd and the cleric is OOM.<br><br>Rangers 3:  Troll 0 <br><br>"Dont diss PvP just cuz rangers blow some major ass at it, and i wasnt saying that a warrior and ranger archery duel was going to be even, i was pointing out that even if you do root and arrow them to death, they can still shoot arrows back and after that root runs out, at lest you wont have full health "<br><br>Ask around.  Rangers are quite feared on the PvP servers.  SoW, snare, archery, and Damage shields along with some offensive spells, and the ability to heal all add up to a tough mother to kill if played right.  In an Arrow war with a Ranger, if his archery is respectable, the Ranger will always win, hands down.  Even if you do a bubble of health to me, I will have done at least that much to you, more than likely twice as much.<br><br>PvP doesn't count.  Score stays even.<br><br>"So i can tell by your respons to the epic that you do realize they suck, and taht the SK epic is much much much better, i aslo forgot to include that it has bash ability on it to interrupt caster. "<br><br>Epics do not define the class.  If they do, then Verant screwed up.  Only Ragebringer, the Click Stick, and the Magician Epic are class defining.<br><br>Score stays the same.  Epics not a valid point when deciding if a class "sucks".<br><br>"Rangers dont deal as much offensive damage as you think they do. A monk, rogue, and warrior deal more dmg, and near the end of the game, you rangers are at the bottom of the pecking order in damage dealing. As for rangers being a fun class to play? maybe if your blasted off your ass and you think its fun to track things and act like a fruity flower sniffing ranger. And i guess you do realize that a ranger unique skill, track does blow major ass and that HT is sooo much better."<br><br>Ooo where to begin?   End Game Warriors will NEVER deal more damage.  Why?  They have defensive disc going 90% of the time.  Monks normally won't.  Why?  No aggro management.  Rogues clean everyone's clocks.  Why?  Not part of this discussion.  Rangers have the Jolt line of spells to deal with Aggro, so they can unload more freely than the monk.  Warriors look for aggro, not damage output. Aggro= fast weapons+procs, even if they suck (but there are some VERY nice weapons that fit this to a T).  If you think you need to blast your arse off to have fun as a Ranger, then play a Wizzy.  Rangers are all about squeezing as much efficiency as they can from their spells, not going nuke happy.  As to Harm Touch being better...  You can use it once every 90 minutes of real time.  I can recycle track every 10 seconds.  Bet Track gets a lot more practical use.  You should have been saying that Feign Dead is the spell ability that makes SKs so awesome.  HT is just a circus trick.<br><br>Rangers 4 : Troll 0<br><br>There you go.  Some basic math clears up the falsehoods you claim make the Ranger class suck.  Please, go away.  I am not going to respond to you anymore.  Have a nice day.<br><br>Gorthin Spiritcaller <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

The SK max's out at 225. This translates into "Ranger does more damage AND hits more often." This is even with 2handed weapons.<br><br>Every Class has it's use. Rangers are a Melee version of the Wizzy. Maximum damage with Minimum agro. We agree that we will never take damage as well as an SK. We don't want to.

The Ranger is always guaging the effects of his attacks, the effects of the attacks of those around him AND the effects of the MoB on himself and his party.<br><br>I can,<br>-Heal others in a fight (AKA try to keep the cleric from dying... can you?),<br>-Let you know when a particularly rare/dangerous MoB is up from across the zone (Gorenair just doesn't like wolf form, does she?

Only problem? its 1hb, so 90% of rangers won't be able to use it, because they've done no work in 1hb.  Other examples come to mind as well: there's a Ranger only 2hb that drops in a Kunark dungeon that has a ratio of something like 31/35 or so, which is pretty nice for any weapon.<br>&nbsp;<br>Malevant Faeshadow.&nbsp;&nbsp;Outrider.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>How many times have you tried to find a group. Well when I have that trouble i switch over to my ranger. With healing to recover your down time is cut down. A warrior solo is stuck at half health most of the time and my ranger deals the same damage and is always topped off. Also with hide and camo you can safely recover your health without being pestered by stuff. The other ability that make rangers great solo is snare. The trick is if your lossing a fight snare the critters and run for zone. Sometimes I snare 3 critters at a time to get away. The final solo tool is root spell. This spells let you root one critter as you defeat the other. Then if your health is ok you take out the second one too. If not just snare and run to zone. My favorite zone for a level 30+ ranger is Crystal Caverns. The orcs don't hit hard and players will pay you serious cash for pieces and Velium. Also the drops from Herbalist, Foreman and Oracle will give you some serious cash. Also you can sell at the merchants in CC with sneak. <br><br>Good Hunting <br>Ranger of the 40th Circle <br>Marteau of 7th.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I still have to train my lvl 10 points (sneak), and I have meditate coming up at 12.  All my skills are pretty much maxed out.  I will be dumping 1 point into sneak and one in meditate (i think you have to train meditate???).  So now my long winded question is this...after training sneak and meditate (if necessary) I will have 13 training points to assign, what should I do?  Should I dump them into forage...cause it sucks or should I save them up for lvl 15 or lvl 18 (dual wield) and 20 (dual attack)???<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>It felt i needed to say something.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will point out the following first.<br>1. My main is not a Ranger it is a Paladin. (Some ppl say the same stuff about them but thats a different story.)<br>2. I have only played my ranger to lvl 20.<br>So with that said i will say my peace..<br><br>As for rangers sucking, Well Every classes has its place and its abilities and disabilities.  Rangers may not be able to take hits but that&#8217;s not there job.  Rangers and Paladins for that matter are what lots of people call Utility Classes.  They fill the spots of 1 or 2 classes if they are not available.  For example my paladin filled the spot of a cleric in Lower Guk a couple of nights a go.  We where camping the Frenzy when the cleric went LD the spawn was going to pop so we had to pull it.  I equipped some of the extra wis gear that I carry got C1 and insight from the chanter and the necro just pumbed mana in to me..  we held the swap and no one died. ( All though it was scary as hell :)  )  that&#8217;s why there are hybrids they fill the slots of other classes when needed.  <br>Rangers are a dmg dealing class.  If there is no rogue/monk or you just want more dmg the get a ranger.  They also bring some nice spells with them. Dots, Sow, Agi and Str Skin like line, DDs and small AC debuffs and snare which in very important.  The most important thing for a ranger to learn is how to control agro.  You don&#8217;t want to be at the top of the hate list.  So don&#8217;t lay all your spells on the mob at one time.  So snare when the mob is lower on HP and let the MA gain good agro before u open up that can of woop ass.  If you do get agro just turn off attack and slowly back off.  The MA should get agro back very quickly and if they don&#8217;t they are not doing something right or you really made the mob mad. hehehe  <br>Thats all i have to say at this time... I think i stated the facts and only the facts if i have made a mistake please point it out. ( I can take creative "Flames")<br><br>Stay safe all  :)<br><br>Amath<br>45 Paladin<br>35 Druid<br>20 Ranger<br><br>Ps. Ranger and Wars have the same offensive skill cap.

Now when that attack button pops back up turn around and run at the mob and hit him again with your weighted axe, this should deal about 140 or so dmg per swing.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I may not be the most appropriate person to answer your question nor do i pretend to be...this is just my oppinion. Both classes are good and enjoyable to play. I believe it is more a factor of difficulty in playing them properly. By this I mean that Rangers are generaly a harder class to play than SKs, be it because of "inferior" armour,hp,and/or weapons. Alot of people wont play a higher difficulty character be it because they either dont want to spend the extra time and effort needed or simply because they cant(watch me get flamed royally for this part). "Why waste my time with a Ranger when I can solo much more effectively with an SK and especially at higher lvls" was how a friend of mine put it. Both characters have their ups and downs, I believe it up to the certain individual as to which character he/she will end up preffering. I know this is not a streight-forwrd answer but it seems to be the truest, to me at least. Learn how to play a class well and you will be able to go against even the toughest of foes.<br><br>Deudred rainstalker <br>38 Ranger  <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

We DeFiNiTeLy cannot use the same armor. SK's can use armor that is commonly reffered to a "Plate" type armor. It has better AC (usually ALOT better) then what Rangers wear, which is refered to as "Chain" type armor. When you compare comparable level attained armor, the Warrior/SK/Pally will usually have somewhere over a 10% AC jump on a comparably equipped Ranger. This is not because of the AGI stat, I assure you, because Rangers usually have a much better AGI than the afforementioned classes (how many SK's do you know START with their AGI pumped to a 105 or so?)<br><br>Now I don't think the Ranger's weapons are inferior either, they are just better suited to the type of tactics we use. But Rangers and SK's don't use the same weapons. Rangers depend on speed to get more hits, while the SK relies more on brute force and that everpresent DoT commonly reffered to as a "Pet".<br><br>Kildiar, have you ever played a Ranger past 9th level? I don't think you have or you wouldn't be asking how playing a Ranger would be harder than playing an SK. The tactics are completely different.<br><br>I am playing a Troll SK of Innoruuk as an alternate character. So I know what the differences are.<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>No, we don't use the same weapons. We only use 2 handers to lessen our agro. SK's tend to use 2 handers to maximize their damage. <br><br>Sure, we want to also contribute to the fight, but we don't do as much damage with 2 Handers, no matter how big they are or how strong the wielder is.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a Swarmcaller. Great Damage/Delay weapon, but I do over 200 points of damage a minute more with my Wurmie/Giant Militia Sword combo. The math is simple. With a second weapon in the fight, our damage output doesn't quite double, but it dramatically increases. Also, I know that when my Str is buffed out to over 200, it just adds to the damage difference.<br><br>I agree that the AC difference for raw AGI isn't exactly stupendous. But it isn't just for the couple of measely AC points that we up our AGI for. The heightened AGI also helps our avoidance skills like Dodge and Parry kick in.<br><br>**EDITED**<br>I just realized that not only will I do as much damage as you will with a 2H-weapon, I will probably do MORE than you will post-50. The Reason? My skill caps are higher (250 post 50, compared to 225 for the SK). Even out the Str and Weapon stats, and the Ranger will do more Damage. Higher Weapon and Offense skill caps, and neither does Critical Damage in Melee combat.<br><br>So the only way you will outdamage me is to raise your stats above mine (Oh, I get Storm Str later in levels) or to get a bigger weapon (Ogguk Cleaver is a nice one that Rangers can't use). Your DoT's are a nice addition too, but they aren't a pure Melee statistic.<br><br>So there is the Melee situation.<br><br>I also just got some new info. Looks like the Test Server is implementing Triple Strike for the Ranger and the Monk. YIKES! Looks like more Agro Management. If this is the case, I am gonna start going to look for the slowest weapons I can find just to keep my agro down. I may even sell my FBSS and put something with AC back on my waist.<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Whoever took control of designing the Ranger for Verant was not after staying true to AD&D's view of a Ranger.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ranger in AD&D of course is THE pet class.  In EverQuest, the pet classes are:  Necromancer (they get a skeletal creature), Cleric (in later levels can summon a hammer that fights for them), Enchanter (gets an animated weapon and shield), Magician (gets the best pets in game so far, an elemental pet that has various special attacks in later levels &lt;i.e. one is a Rogue class that can backstab for massive amounts of damage&gt;), ShadowKnight (can summon a skeleton), Shaman / Druid (can summon a wolf, I believe)....<br><br>So you say where are the ranger pets?  Nowhere.  Sorry.<br><br>(BTW when I posted a message about how Rangers were SO untrue to AD&D on another message board, someone very, um, emotionally told me that Verant created these classes and races and could do what they wanted with them - to which I say - BAH - they actually got the best of both worlds - they didn't have to stay true to AD&D but got to name the classes and races after AD&D.  They should have come up with their own class names for things.  Ranger = PET CLASS in D&D, so since in EQ it's a very different class, it should have been called something original, such as Bowfighter.  Or something.)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Here is what I would suggest.&nbsp;&nbsp;Look for the Fine Steel/common cheapie versions of what you have already.  They should run about 5 to 10 plat each, assuming you can buy them from players.  They should fit within you budget at the moment.  Remember, these are cheap weapons, not the "uber" stuff.<br><br>FS Two Handed sword is 12 Dmg 43 delay.  That is a &gt;huge&lt; increase in both damage and speed over what you have.  Also the Bone Bladed Claymore from Befallen can be bought cheap (usually, sometimes for 10 plat on Bristlebane).  It is 17 Damage, 45 delay, -8 AGI.  An even larger upgrade, just make sure the -8 agi does not drop you below 75.<br><br>Fine Steel Longsword is 6 dmg 28 delay.  For the 5 plat it costs, it will still knock off almost half a second on your attack delay.  That is a good chunk of delay reduced.  A Fading Shadow Longword is 7 dmg 27 delay.  Not bad, either, and can usually be bought in EC fairly cheap (most consider it on the level of FS).<br><br>As to piercing, this is a little tougher.  The faster stuff does not hit as hard (for the cheap items).  You may be able to find a bloodstained fang cheaply (read 20 plat).  It is 9 Dmg and 32 delay.  It is a little slower than the snake fang, but will do almost twice the damage.  You can also look for a Fading Shadow Spear which is 7 Dmg 26 delay.<br><br>There are some nice low level non twink items that can be bought.  I hope I mentioned a few that can help you.  Also, do not be afraid of using the search features on this site.

In group fighting how do they fit in plz -as I know they are not a main tank or a damage giver.  Are they suposed to tank or cast in groups? and does this role then change at later lvls?  Plz dont any start on about they are sucky at later lvls as I am playing a ranger for the same reasons as I chose my rogue - not to level the quickest and get the best loot but to play the character!

	   <tr><td colspan=2> Rangers trully are a verry interesting and fun characters to play. As far as strategy I agree with the others on what they say. When in a grp dont try to be the main tank unless you have to. Stick to being a seccondary tank and help out with the Snare/Dot line of spells. Also help out the team healer by back-up healing ( i.e top-up heal or take care of the not-so-heavily wounded).<br>Allways remeber that your snare spell will work as the best taunt no mater how maxed out the warriors is. This can be both good and dangerous as mobs will tend to turn on you pretty often.<br> As for soloing the general idea is to Snare/Dot a single creature and maybe soften it up with a fwe arrows if your archerry is good enough. Dont try to finish them off this way as it will take too long. You are best off getting up close and personal with them as soon as you feel comfortable.<br> Also keep your tracking and foraging maxed out. They are a must for survival. Less time spent in vendors with forage keeping your food supply toped up. Tracking also helps in traveling. if you are lost but konw of a mob or person in the general direction you want lock onto them, tho this can get tricky in confined spaces and/or maze-like zones.<br> All in all the best thing is to take theese blueprints and change them around a bit to better suit your style of playing.And above all have funn.<br><br>Deudred Rainstalker<br>38 ranger<br>Karana<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
