	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ahh....the Wurmy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's my two cents.  It's a great weapon, but yes that stam drain is a monster.  I use a Lammy and a CSS when I am solo, or the only tank in the group (Tunare please keep that a rare occurance)  When I am the Back-up tank I switch to the Wurmy and CSS.  I do this to Avoid the uber-taunt we Rangers are famous for, by slowing my attack down.  I still do solid damage but not as quickly.  Now, this wouldn't help (as i hit for 25-50 with the CSS and then 50-120 with the Wurmy) but the Stam drain actually helps me as I get slower with each swing, but i keep the damage about the same.  After the battle, even if there is another MOB up for slaughter, I cast Invigor on myself and then start over again.  So use a Wurmslayer if you like.  I figure if you have a meat-wall in your group, let him get the bruises.  We rangers need to stay looking good while we slay our foes!

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Currently I'm in Everfrost with a level 22 Ranger. I became impatient and tried to solo a couple of mammoths that conned even with me. I was able to kill the first two without any problem. The third resisted all my roots and was about to wipe the floor with me when a level 9 shaman healed me (while two roots finally stuck). Someone sent me a tell saying that I should fear kite the mammoths instead of rooting them and throwing all my DD spells and shooting arrows at them. So, when I logged off I read some message boards and found that I got panic animal at level 22. I ran to Surefall Glade, bought and memmed the spell, and ran back to Everfrost to try it out on a calf. Sure enough, panic animal was working.<br><br>My question is this. When I read through things on the Internet to help me with strategy and so forth, there are typically seven spells listed as being available to a level 22 Ranger. Panic animal is not one of them. I could really have used Panic animal when my partner and I took on a wooly mammoth that conned yellow to me. I died, she survived. The two tusks were some consolation.<br><br>Does anyonw know what the best guide to what spells are available to Rangers?

There are no supiror classes. but lets compare rangers and sk. I noticed one of you said you can stack 3 dots, yea o undead. And Rangers are much better with bows and you can't argue with that.yes you have fear, but we also have panic animal. And if you really want to argue about who can meele more than mabey we should duel.Somtimes if you sk's have a really good weapon you can beat us out for damage, but for the most part you will lose. I would like to see you beat a lammy and a wormslayer.As that guy was saing earlier, you will consistantly hit for more but i can get in 3 times as manhits as you. I don't want to rude but if you are saing we need to get a life, then wha are you doing taking you time on a site that has nothing to do with you.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>HOLY COW MAYBE SKS DO MORE DAMAGE THAN RANGERS IN HAND TO HAND!!! OMG WTF!!!! That means that rangers suck, obviously. Dude. Brilliant. I'm such a moron, I thought that rangers were good because they are almost the most versatile class in the game, not because they can hit for more damage in hand to hand. Okay, let's take duels. Ranger snares you, runs off to where you can't see him, buffs himself silly, and comes back to run around in circles filling you full of arrows. (Criticals for 44 with dmg 1 arrows - hey! I just made up the damage difference in hand to hand!) Oh, but you've got Slow spells! I'm dead in the water now! Of course a quick cancel magic gets rid of that as long as you're smart and use damage shield(s) to free up the first 1 or two slots for those pesky SK DoTs...then just back up to a comfortable distance (snare, you'll find, lasts for quite awhile), pop off some more arrows, re-do our 106 pt DoT, maybe throw in a few DD's just for good measure, re-do SOW, and run away to meditate a little. I've won duels without even fighting in hand-to-hand (quiver was a little low afterwards, though)...and don't think for a minute that SKs can outdo rangers for long-range damage. Pets? No ranged attacks, and snare only costs 15 mana. Moving on...<br><br>Groups! Ah, yes, no kiting in groups, right? Only melee damage matters in groups, right? So the SKs must be better! Of course! Then after a fight when the cleric has no mana the SK can heal himself to save them the trouble, right? Or how about SOWing the group so they can get away in case of a train? Very helpful. Okay, so you might say the ranger's heal sucks. It does. But it's still a HEAL, so it's still faster than sitting on your duff waiting for your hitpoints to regenerate, and it's a lot more efficient than having your cleric waste mana that could be used during the fight. And sure, if you're in a good enough group, you won't HAVE to run...but it only takes one train to get you all killed. And most druids don't have the mana to keep SOWing the entire group over and over. We make up for the slight lack of damage in hand to hand, and the lack of a pet in mana saved to the casters. <br><br>Maybe "THE intelligent SK" (does that imply that there's only one?) needs to duel a few intelligent bow-notchers (I KNOW there are more than one) and get his arse handed to him so that he'll gain some respect for us "flower sniffing gay rangers."<br><br>Lethek Stormwind<br>(Ayonae Ro)<br><br>Drop the argument? I think not! Not until I hear a retraction of all insults to rangers. And maybe a little boot-kissing.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>First, ranger buffs may blow, but they're infinitely better than no buffs at all, and cost very little mana. Second, if you want to blow all your mana shadow-stepping to avoid my arrows, be my guest, but I have this neat little mana-free ability known as tracking...third, I don't know ANY SK (maybe you ARE the only intelligent one...) who pulls greens and lifetaps to regain hp. For one thing, your'e not ALWAYS going to have a constant supply of greenies - or at least ones who are low enough level for you to actually SAVE time by fighting them - and for another, I've never seen an SK lifetap faster than I can heal...remember, the point was to SAVE time, not make your group wait for you to pull a mob, lifetap yourself up to par, and then finish it off every time you want to pull something that actually gives you exp. As for SOWing the whole group, I was pointing out that since most of a ranger's spells are just lower-level druid spells, his spells would be mostly useless in a group that had a druid. In such a case, he could still be useful as a mana battery, SOWing the whole group so the druid wouldn't have to, and saving him just that much more mana for his UPPER-level druid spells. As far as MR goes, first of all if you can get your MR up to 120 so can I, and then I'll resist all of your DoTs and snares, and second of all, your MR doesn't stop me at all from SOWing myself - which has the same effect as snaring you, more or less. As for damage dealing, your math may look nice on paper, but you're leaving out a lot of things. For one thing, you get a damage bonus for your primary hand, every time it hits, depending on your level. More hits = more damage bonus. Second, at 39 rangers get a spell that makes ALL of their weapons (both primary and secondary) proc additional damage, and low delay means more procs, and even more damage. This also applies to ALL weapons that proc, like the Ykesha weapons (75pt DD), which start proc-ing at lvl 36 or 37, depending on which one you get.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ok fine your buffs are better than none, i mean hell never know when those extra 70 HP will come in handy. two Shadow Step only costs 5 mana and a second to cast, go ahead and track me i will just let you waste a few more arrows and use it again.,&nbsp;&nbsp;As for MR, i guess neither of our spells will make any difference to the other so who cares about those, since our spells are also like you guys.  Three being an intelligence caster i am sure we have more mana then you and lifetaps cost very little mana at all, so i guess you could heal your self, which when watching my friend takes about half a mana bar, and i will just tap things, which uses about a 10th of a mana bar, also dont forget the infemous ghetto SK heal, i mean hell it blows ass but if we have a warrior that is tanking might as well let him have you HP.  As for your SoW and running away, i'll just invis my self while you run away thinking i am going to chase you.  SO i guess about the damage dealing thing i was right when i said we do pretty much equivalent damage.  Later in the game, when grouping is almost a must, either things are green or red so there is usually always a greeny runnin' around and if not, i just tell the warrior to tank while i tap the hell outta the mob, because life tap is unresistable, thank god.  As for SoWing the whole group, fine i will give you that, it was a very good point you made unlike a few other rangers in this forum.<br><br><br><br>Kildiar Shadow Knight<br>"I came here to see if you rangers could change my mind, this guys has done a very good job..."<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>OK, you Invis'd. By the time you got Invis, we got See Invis. Which means you are still being tracked and seen and that Arrow I just shot at you prolly has Crit written all over it.<br><br>Oh, btw, we can crit whether you are stationary or moving, and our range can be pretty long armed. A bow with 200 rng and arrows that add 150 means we can shoot you alot farther out than you can cast to hurt us. With a 6 slot Quiver and the ammo slot, that means (count with me, boys and girls) I have 140 arrows to shoot at you, not counting being able to make them on the fly (and most rangers who use their bows properly carry enough arrow components to fill their quiver at least twice because you can't solo without arrows).<br><br>Now let's do a little more math. With crits and misses figured into the equation, I do about 15 (err on the low side) points per arrow. That comes out to 2100 points of damage. You think you can lifetap or lifespike fast enough to stay ahead of that AND Shadowstep around AND have enough mana for all of this...&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, now you see the problem even casting Mob's have with a Ranger that has room to use his tools effectively.<br><br>As for Tap being unresistable...  you must be nuts. I also have a troll SK and his tap has been resisted by red mobs that are only 1 or two levels red (level was known because of group makeup). So don't get too cocky about lifetap. It can be resisted as a straight MR. Something to add to your book of knowledge.<br>&nbsp;<br>Domnall Phyrestorme - 22 Ranger (I started over)<br>Eevill Inkarnate - 45 Necromancer<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>This is my second guide in trying to help people with Ranger characters and to try and convince people to play Rangers. Right now, my Ranger is level 32, and has good stats and great armour. I'll list it so you all can see about what a level 30 should have.<br>149 STR, 94 STA, 143 AGI, 102 DEX, 77 WIS, 77 INT, & 76 CHA. I know I need to get my WIS up...<br>20 vs Poison, 28 vs Magic, 15 vs Disease, 39 vs Heat, 54 vs Cold<br>1002 HPs, 652 AC, 733 Attack<br><br>My list of Armour and Weapons (toys):<br>2 Orc Fang Earrings<br>Orc Fang Necklace<br>Enshrouded Veil<br>Executioners Hood<br>2 Jagged Bands<br>Bracer of Erollisi<br>Ry'Gorr Iron Armguards<br>Ry'Gorr Chain Gloves<br>Serpentine Bracer<br>Crested Spaulders<br>Ry'Gorr Battle Mail<br>Cloak of the Ice Bear<br>This Banded Belt<br>Ice Weave<br>Watchmans Boots<br>Rough Ashwood Recurve Bow<br>Icetooths Claws<br>Stormfeather Talons<br><br>Now for where I made my levels and friends, you will need a Teleport:<br>Inside the Qeynos Newbie Area for lvls 1-5, find some rats, gnolls, bugs, or bats to get experience. Use Track (set to distance) to find all the monsters.<br>Outside of BlackBurrow in the Qeynos Hills for lvl 5-6, because you don't want to go into BlackBurrow just yet, it's too mean. Kill the spawn thats next to the mouth of the tunnel (no pun intended) or anything worth experience that wanders by, put your Track skill to use again.<br>Now move into BlackBurrow for lvls 6-11. Start hunting lawn trash around the top, and if BB is still too hard for you then go back outside and lvl again for more HPs. After you've made a level hunting lawn trash, go down to the med room and kill the scrawny gnolls there and the gnolls across the bridge. After you've leveled again, try and get a snake ledge/pit group or you can try to solo the giant snakes.<br>Everybody will tell you to move on to the Elite groups, but grab a Teleport to the West Commons instead for levels 11-16.Join a Dervish Cutthroats instead of the Elite group, you'll make experience and money faster! Prepare yourself for tough fights with Dervish Thugs, they're pretty mean.<br>Once you reach level 16, journey over to Highpass Hold and wait to join an orc group there up to level 20. The groups in HH are usually fast paced and very efficient, and if you've been used to soloing then this group will bring you up to date on all the group terms and tactics. By the way, have fun picking out a surname.<br>For levels 20-28, move inside to Highpass Keep. In the basement, there are goblins and those're hunted. Join one of those groups and try to have fun because it gets a bit repetitive.<br>Now we travel to the dangerous lands that constitute Kunark for levels 28-32. I only say up to 32 because that's my highest level character. Get a giant fort group in the Frontier Mountains and be sure to have your 30th spells bought ahead of time and brought with you. <br>Some notes you'll need if you're not familiar with the areas and since you'll be traveling some. The Bank of Qeynos is in South Qeynos across a small bridge. Hunting Dervish Cutthroats is good experience, and the merchant in the nearby druid ring makes keeping your weight low easy. The Freeport bank is in North Freeport, across the market area. The nearest Ranger Trainer will be in Kithicor, near the Rivervale entrance, you'll pick them up on Track. Starting off in HH, the guards will generally not like you and you shouldn't explore the tavers too much because of a Dark Elf Shadowknight spy I found the hard way. Killing orcs will help you gain faction with the HH guards though. Inside HK, the bank is near the basement. Before you start hunting the goblins, dont worry about being trained, you aren't KOS at first. The only 'good-guy' bank in Kunark is in Firiona Vie. There is a trainer, spell merchant, and fletching merchant too.<br>Now head to the Overthere and group for levels 32-40. Be careful not to run into the Dragoons that patrol from the evil outpost, they run at SoW speed and tear apart groups in the 40's.<br>I'm guessing that once you hit your 40's, you should try and group in Skyfire (there's creepy looking stuff in there) or move into the new continent of Velious, which is just as dangerous as Kunark.<br>During all of this leveling, you should make a few trips to East Commons when you've gotten a few hundred extra platinum for some good armour. Remember that when you're buying a better armour piece than one you already own, sell the piece you're wearing so you can afford even better. You'll want to Dual Wield 1H Slashing weapons, and get a Trueshot Bow. Don't focus on weapons with procs, focus on weapons that have low delay and high damage. Try to find weapons that add to stats too.<br>Also, a warning. Because you're a hybrid class and casting skills are earned and not born with, you WILL have to puy a point into each area of casting. I found that out the hard way too and suffered through level 9 with casting skills of 1.<br>Don't foget about Kiting either, it's a very useful technique. You Snare or Root the monster you want to kill, then nuke or snipe the monster until your Snare/Root wears off. Now you repeat the process OR get persenal and melee the monster to death. Later, you can Reverse Kite with animals, which means you Fear the animal after Snaring it, then proceed to nuke/snipe it.<br>Have fun being a Ranger, you'll make lots of friends and get around. Good luck finding the right armour/weapons/friends/guild etc.!<br><br>Aeresia Staarphyre ~ Lvl 32 Ranger of Quellious<br><br>P.S.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Pretty good equipment but you need to ditch the Bracer of Erollisi and serpentine bracer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember the rule AC RULES.

I knew I would be getting slow experience during hell level and cougar claw earrings were dropped about as often as Forest Loops.  I took advantage of the hell lvl and killed tons of cougars and got 2 cougar claws. From 36-40 I hunted in EW Walrus, Ulthork, and Ry'Gorr Orcs. 40 Hell level back to FV and hunted Drolvargs solo close to FV so I could raise my piercing, 2hs, archery, 1hb fletching skill and sell quickly. 41-42 Dreadlands in group and solo OT when I couldn't find group.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Your welcome, btw thanks for the guides. As for the AC vs Agi, yes agi can keep you from getting hit but AC will protect you when you do get hit.<br>Lets face it with our low defensive skills you will be getting hit. If you want proof that AC is more important just check your AC and note your value, then cast Feet Like Cat. You will notice only a small increase of 3 AC I believe. So if you have a serpentine bracer which is 9 Agi and 1 Ac you get roughly 2.5 ac out it. While a Bracer of Scavenging is 9 AC plus 5 sta and 5 dex giving you 6.5 more AC. And more dex is always good since it will improve your archery dmg and make your weapons proc when you get Call of Sky buff.<br><br>Yes I know that procs unreliable damage but its pretty nice bonus since you don't use much mana during fights when you have a bunch of casters in group.<br><br>Cannis Skywise<br>42nd Ranger of Tunare<br>Bertoxxulous<br>&nbsp;<br>Cannis 58th Ranger<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>READ THIS IF YOU FEEL LIKE QUITTING YOUR RANGER!!!<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ladies and Gentlemen, in my opinion and many other peoples's, the Ranger is an excellent class. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise. Rangers are the Jack-of-All-Trades, the EQ equivilant of a Swiss Army Knife. You can cast offensive and defensive spells, use utility spells (such as Camouflage), and cast buff spells to enhance character stats. As a Ranger you can melee like a Warrior, heal in down-time, snipe from afar if low on health, pull only one monster from a group via Harmony spell, etc. You can do practically anything as a Ranger! With Forage, you can be the group's food and drink supply if far from civilization. Since Rangers travel and make friends, you probably have a few stories to tell to stop boredom during downtime. Track makes EQ life so much easier, especially when set to distance, so you can find all the worthwhile things to kill without wandering or know when an ugly is headed your way and you know you don't want to meet him.<br>   It's hard to start a Ranger, but they're great by mid-20's. Get the right equipment and make the right friends to have the most fun with EQ! The Ranger is a fun and functional class!<br>   I've NEVER been rejected from a group because of my class! Every group I've ever been in has loved having me in their group! You can buff if the group has no Druid, tank if there's no Warrior, pull if there isn't a Monk, heal in downtime if without a Cleric or Paladin, DoT if the group lacks a Necromancer, nuke if there's no Wizard, lower aggro range on monsters if the group is missing an Enchanter, etc. Rangers specialise in nothing, but are at LEAST decent in all things so they make great substitutes!<br>   Rangers excell just as well as anybody else in Trade Skills except for Jeweling. And with Spirit of Wolf, traveling to get the supplies is much faster and easier.<br>   Rangers make excellent soloers also by using their large array of spells and combat abilities and special abilities. Use Track to find a monster, Snare or Root him, shoot him with your bow from a distance or nuke him with spells like Burst of Fire, get close and personal with your Dual Wield and Double Attack skills, defend yourself from the monster's attacks with Parry/Riposte/Dodge, if an extra monster jumps in you can Snare or Root him too or run away with SoW. Blind Rangers get the Dance of Fireflies spells to see in the dark, and Rangers in unfamiliar territory can cast Bind Sight on a scout to see the area ahead without being there. Rangers can also Damage Shield themselves before battle, and beleive me, a DS helps.<br>   Rangers should focus on four things in my opinion; STR, AGI, and WIS. STR is used for carrying weight around and for battle skills. AGI, when paired with maxxed Defense Skills, means that monsters cant touch you or cant hit you as hard. WIS is for mana towards spells and determines how fast you'll learn new skills. If you plan on using weapons that proc, focus on DEX. DEX also help determine how often you'll land your blows.<br>   For NPC's that dont like you or are about to surprise you, you can use Sneak or Hide. I've had many a time when I didn't have Camo memmed and I heard the THUMP-THUMP of giant feet, so I used Hide and the giant passed me by. You also have the advantage of Sneak to get by monsters with their back turned to you, or to do quests with NPC's that hate you.<br>   And for those of you out there who like to make fun of other classes, let me explain something. All classes were designed to be equal. They all have their strengths and weaknesses, and they balance out for every class, period. The reason some people love their certain class and no-one else's is because that class fits them. The Ranger class fits me, the Warrior for my brother, the Cleric for a friend of mine, the Wizard for my cousin, the ShadowKnight for my dad, etc. Stop flaming about one class better than another, because what you REALLY mean is that your class suits you better than the class you're flaming about.<br>   One last thing, my Ranger is only lvl 32 and all of this I already know about Rangers. It's not hard to learn about or learn to love a Ranger. Rangers are great to play, group with, or be friends with. Get acquainted with a Ranger, you might surprise yourself and start playing one.<br><br>Draktos Daer'Akh ~ Lvl 22 Necromancer of Ayonae Ro<br>Khaliban Scarletvespers ~ Lvl 20 Cleric of Ayonae Ro<br>Gitzom Odis ~ Lvl 16 Shaman of Ayonae Ro<br>Aeresia Staarphyre ~ Lvl 32 Ranger of Quellious<br>Jreken Silverblades ~ Lvl 29 Warrior of Quellious<br><br>"Quote?

	   <tr><td colspan=2>*Note* This thread has nothing in common with a strategy for Rangers and you should skip this if strategy is what your looking for. You can consider this as a flame if you wish or you may consider this as a tale. As a way of showing that we are all equal. This is a tale of the creation of all life in a EQ view. *End Note*<br><br> The universe was created by the Elder Gods beings who were lords of all life. When they worked the magic's of life and time they created the orbs of rock that float through the river of time. <br><br> From this the gods created their children to rule and create on these orbs. The child of the elders to give life to the orb was Veeshan the Crystaline Dragon. With her talon she struck a blow to the land and gave birth to the Dragons.<br><br> The other children of the elders were jealous of Veeshan and stook claim upon the land. Rallos, Tunare, Cazic and the others all created life. "We shall cast them down upon this planet so they shall know our tyrany." And so the elder races were created. But the gods did not know unlike their creators that a being cannot be controled or destoryed that they will rule themselves. <br><br> Thus groups of the gods creations discovered that they control their own lives and souls and are not puppets that can be played with to achieve their gods own personal goals and desires. And so while the children of the gods waged war among themselves the deserters took control of their own destiny. <br><br> From the will and life of the people others were created and freedom was made. However the gods did not want their creations to&nbsp;&nbsp;grow all powerfull and become independent. Thus the first war between mortals occured, and the world changed. <br><br> However the play on Norath was seen by the creators of all the elder gods. When they saw what their children had done they banished them to their own planes where they can no longer abuse the lives of their creations. <br><br> But it was to late the world was flung into a war each side joined with their creator and givin powers to serve the will of their god. Thus began the eternal war between all of humanity each being a mindless pupet. <br><br> Thus we were created and our powers embued upon us to serve the will of our god. But we have what was desired. Our freedom and will to live as we wish.<br><br>*Note* Hope this helps grasp the concept of Role Playing and gives you insight to your life from a dream. *End Note*<br><br>Teguvin <br>Quellious Server<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>OK, you think you can do more Damage than I can? Tell you what, why don't you and your pet find a Ranger of equal level and duel?&nbsp;&nbsp;I can face you any day of the week, make you waste your mana and take you and your pet out.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Because I don't have to use my mana for anything other than Snare and Root. After I Snare you, I will lead your pet out a ways, melee it down before you ever catch up to me without losing more than a bub of health at MAX, take your dreaded HT, while snaring you again, then root and arrow kite you till you pass out dead. You better have ALOT of bone chips, cause your pets ain't NOTHING to a Ranger that knows what to do with them.  If I decide to use my mana, Dismiss Summoned works wonders if I decide to root your pet like I did you and take it out with a couple of casts (very mana efficient spell, BTW) all the while DoTing your sorry behind, still pumping you full of arrows and generally making your day miserable. Sure, you have DoT's and other spells at your command... Big deal. With Snare, my Bow range AND SoW (at higher levels), you will never get close enough to me to cast them.<br><br>As for dealing Damage in a fight with similar critters...  We use 1HS Dual Wield OR 2HS.  We decide just how much agro we want to take. Unless your HT is up, you haven't got much of a chance of taking down the MoB or making it pay attention to you before the caster bites it, while we can MAKE the MoB pay attention to us, drag it off and root it so that the caster can still do their job and make it through the fight ALIVE. NO other class can touch us in the agro department when we dual wield, even in higher levels when the Warrior Taunt skill caps out at around 200 compared to our 150. Add fast dual weapon swings, Proc of both Weapons (sometimes two proc's on each weapon if the weapons have their own proc before we use Call of Sky, and then if one Proc doesn't go off the second one might, so it doubles our chance at having a Proc hit), Taunt, Snare and Flame Lick and we OWN the MoB's attention (except when the Cleric sees the need to cast a CH, and then it takes a few swings to get it to back up off the Cleric).<br><br>The Ranger you fought honestly did not realize his full potential. You should never have been able to touch him had he snared you and solo'd your pet while you played catch-up. But hey, dems da breaks.<br><br>I can solo ANY Even to Blue, provided I have some clear room to kite with. Snare, a bow and a full quiver, and I am more efficient than you are. My mana is only necessary to slow it down while I plink down shafts of pointy death from a distance. Resnare every so often, sometimes root and DoT as well if my running room is limited.<br><br>I like SK's, don't get me wrong.  I have a Troll that I love to play.  But SK's do not own Rangers. Rangers don't own SK's. They are just two different means to a MoB's end.<br>&nbsp;<br>Domnall Phyrestorme - 22 Ranger (I started over)<br>Eevill Inkarnate - 45 Necromancer<br></td></tr>

Five, i happen to have a weapon that is an ensnaring roots my target so after i do that i can stack my 5 DoT's on you, steal away at lest 50 points of your STR, 30 or so which go to me. Two, i solo yellows and low reds just by using my snaring DoT's and stacking at least up to 4 more DoT's on them.  Then i melee a few, then fear kite them and its so easy to kill practically anything that isnt 8 lvls above me.

Snare takes as long as your disease cloud, still does more agro AND makes it so the source of irritation (which sometimes is me if I forget to target the mob after buffing rofl) goes mighty slow for a mighty long time.<br><br>Kildiar, I have to hand it to you, you have alot of Rangers ticked off, BUT you have some of the best ones posting some good advice for PvP situations and general utility info.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Wow, that was a very helpfull post for the Rangers. I thank you SK, for giving me another oppritunity to show someone what Rangers can really do. Since I always get the response to my duels that duels prove nothing but that you can solo, Im gunna give a group example. Say Im in a group with a 34 Cleric<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;           32 Warrior<br>             35 Monk<br>             29 Enchanter<br>             32 Shammy<br>             30 Ranger (me)<br>This seems to be about what I usually group with. The cleric would pry buff the tanks and heal. The Warrior would tank and keep the mob on him. The Monk would melee and sometimes get the agrro on him and turn auto attack off. The Enchanter would haste and mez. The Shammy would buff whatever the Cleric didnt, SoW and backup heal. The Ranger would buff herself, SoW when not in battle, heal small amounts of HP during downtime, DoT if no one else is, snare, root for aggro control, fear animals for aggro control, nuke every now and then, restore stamina, cancel magic on the de-buffs, pull with harmony, SoW and after all of this, melee. BETTER than an SK. We get double attack and dual weild, attacking several times, WITH low delay.<br>Now, to talk @#%^ about YOU. You somehow manage to find a group, with the same classes and lvls.<br>34 Cleric<br>32 Warrior<br>35 Monk<br>29 Enchanter<br>32 Shammy<br>30 SK (I dont really care what lvl you are so im making you 30 like me.) Everyone has the same job as before, but theres someone NEW in the team. Lets see..... Lets look at spells first. You would send out your lvl 16 pet, play dead, DoT, lifetap, nuke undead only, fear would be the most usefull spell for you, use that snare thing and melee WORSE than Rangers. You would pry get a heavy 2hs or 2hb and try to get the mob on you instead of the Monk beacause of low HP. You cant do this cuz you do ALOT less damage with a 2 hander than 2 1 handers. We can attack several times in a row for 20 damage, like 5-6 with fast weapons, while you can attack twice for 40-50. The Warrior would end up taking the damage and you would only be usefull as a weak DoT spell with an even weaker pet. And we could use you as a decoy why everyone else runs to zone.<br>Well, sounds like that lvl 30 Ranger is sounding alittle better, isnt it? Haha, I can name alot more good stuff about the SK then that, but this is to prove a point. A SK has a spot in a group, as does ANY class. There is NO better class. I dont care what you SKs, Bards, Clerics, Druids, Enchanters, Mages, Monks, Necros, Pallys, fellow Rangers, Rogues, Shammys, Warriors and Wizzys say, everyone has a place in a group. Verant made us this way. If you dont like it complain to them. And, please, if you wanna trash my saying, READ IT FIRST! Keep up the arguements. They keep me on these boards. -Julily<br>&nbsp;<br>Ranger<br>Someone once told me that no one person can change this game. I'm going to change that.</td></tr>

I don't think someone living in the real world could be as stupid and as blind. Only cazic thule can break the mind of someone like that, LOL. <br>Well, i could say that last day, in Dreadlands, i was outdamaging a 47 SK with my 43 ranger, and she was screaming, plz! stop taunting , i am the main tank! LOL was LMAO, cause i deleted that hotkey monthes ago ( flame lick is much better ) The reply was : OH damm, U rangers are doing so much damages! can't u switch to slower weapon? I did and she could main tank finally :). That do not mean that SK are a bad class, u should first think about one thing, mister SK : U are a good tank, everybody agree, rangers are Aka Damage dealers, and that makes a big difference... <br>After this fight ( was great group, even with a sk, LOL),&nbsp;&nbsp;i had to leave to join guildies who were planning to raid karnor : disbanded, a few seconds later, group was shouting: Group needs Melee damage dealer, ranger or monk, send tells plz. See, no one asked for a SK, as they DIDN'T need one, what they needed to be efficient was a damage dealer. When Cazic Thule will give u a little more IQ, u'll understand, poor dark one, that rangers or SK, are useful sometimes, and useless in other situations, playing a SK, for sure, wont show u the big potential of EQ, in terms of tactic, cause u don't really need to think a lot to play a SK in a good way, tanking is the easiest way to play: click on attack button, and wait for the damages to kill the mob, cast a few dots and stay infront of mob to get the agro with your powerfull weapons, and cry for your pet to help you ( strange that SK and Pallys get all the good stuff... Perhaps verant wanted to give them a chance to survive in norrath :)) ). Rangers have no pets, and no good stuff til they hit 55, HOW THE HELL CAN THEY REACH THOSE LEVELS WITHOUT THE ARSENAL OF SKs? hmm Perhaps they are good enough after all :)   <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

And another thing, i have alredy explained the pet, he is just like a DoT, he does damage over time and he lasts forever so dont say anything about our pet.  I dont care what lighties think, i am on a pvp server i kill all lighties i see; especially those god forsaken retarded pallies and bards, so maybe your groups call for rangers but i have been grouped with a ranger b4, he was always gettin heals from the cleric practically every few seconds.  and i already explained my dmg output a little farther up on the forum, which doesnt include misses and such, and it appears we do about the same amount of dmg, i also mentioned to drop the dmg arugument because it was pointless if we do the same dmg.  btw rangers have an even easier job they go behind the mob and just push auto attack, they dont even have to taunt or anything nor do they have to cast spells.  Besides, who needs a group i solo because SK's are very good at unlike rangers, who are not quite as powerful in that area.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Why is a supposed SK making posts on a Ranger Page?&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is he posting anon?  Another question on my mind is why does he think we suck so much?  Rangers are the MOST versatile class in the game.  Looking at all your previous posts that I could stomach to look at without laughing at your unfortunate gay self, I saw you made some vital errors in your facts.<br>1. WE DO MORE DAMAGE THAN YOU DO, we are 1 of 2 dual weilding double attacking classes in the game.  We can use more weapon types than you just as well as you.  With equal type weapons we will stomp your sorry Evil god worshiping @$$ into oblivion.<br>2. We also have a superb taunt, the spell: &quot;Flame Lick&quot; is one of the better taunting spells in the game.<br>3. We have an actual heal.  It is a sucky one by most class standards, but hey it is decent for it's mana cost.<br>4. We have buffs that actually don't suck, yes it's true we can and do cast buffs that are beneficial: Call of sky/Earth, Wolf Form, Hawk Eye, Feet like the Cat, Str of Earth, Bramble, Coat, sorry I am rambling.<br>5. We have decent Blasting spells, &quot;Call of Flames&quot; is a good example.  It will chap your retarded butt thats for sure.<br>6. Even without a pet to fall back on we have excellent soloing ability.  We can bow kite so we don't use mana.  We don't run out of arrows if we invest in &quot;Endless Quiver&quot; I might add.  With SoW or Wolf form (Take your pick) we can travel to our hunting ground much faster.  With our Dots (yes we actually have some of them too) We can drop the creature that much quicker.  Like you we have snare and root, this also gives us a great advantage soloing.<br>7. You have better armor most of the time (So what?) we have better Dex/Agi most of the time (on average) so it evens out.<br>8. You HT/FD We Track/Forage/Dual Wield/ have better faction automatically<br>9. guess who is not going to hell when we die (Rangers) guess who is (Have fun Sk's) Brimstone hurts last I checked.<br>10. Rangers Have BOW MASTERY, TRUESHOT DISC, and KICK ARSE RANGER ONLY BOWS, I can't wait till you are bow critted on for 20K+ :) Have a nice day.<br>11. IMMUNITY TO FEAR with a nice Disc of ours, thats a big line of spells you own washed down with a big glass of: SUX TO BE YOU! =P<br>12. Getting indegestion yet?  Well unfortunatly for you I am not done with you yet.  It gets better my friend, Any disadvantage you can think of look at our Alternate Exp capabilities we pretty much can fix them all.<br>13. Did I mention Arrow in @$$?  Oh ya I did sorry just had to throw it in.  We have Hide good luck seeing us, EVER.  &quot;Helm of the tracker&quot; perm effect: Truesight.  Dual swords beat one every day of the week.  2hander abuser are you?  We can do that too.<br>14.  I saw you mentioned int casters having more mana, gonna have to check on that but I am fairly certain that is not so.<br>15.  IMO Shadow Knights have just as much a purpose as Rangers, but you happen to be a reason that most Sk's have bad faction.<br>16. We do have a taunt button to push should we be in a tanking position, which I have filled, we also disarm so to your respnse we have it easier (ya right) We are also often pullers due to our harmony spell and excellent bow damage.<br>17. To your comment on the ranger you grouped with that was getting heals from the cleric every few seconds, obviously he was an exception to the common Ranger.  I would have backed off jolted healed myself :) then rejoined the melee.<br>18. The list is endless isn't it?  Your pet is a dot that can be rooted and dotted itself, making it pointless.  I also mentioned before unless restrained can be a hazard to you and your party.<br>19. I also would like to point out that I have never seen a person soloing over 40.  Anyone that does is guildless and in my opinion stupid.  Every now and then sure but as a main way to fight good luck to those who try to keep it up past 45.<br>20. To make a conclusion though I don't really have to, on my reasons you suck and we don't we don't we can pick our battles using tracking techniques.  We find your special mobs on track that drop that special item you are wetting yourself over.  You also atributed that the SK that was beat in a duel by the ranger had a sucky weapon.  Any good melee knows that a sword does not make a warrrior, his knowledge of war does.<br><br>  I also would like to make clear that in a group I would prefer a Pally over an SK due to the fact he has the number 1 best heal in the game (LOH) and the pet is an unpredictable variable in a dungeon setting.  You have HT he has LOH I like his better.  PALLY POWER!!!  Sorry my list stopped at 20, but I am getting tired, it is 2:45 am.<br><br>I wish all Sk's the best of luck in the future except the retard posting on the ranger forum pretending to know something(Kildiar).  I am not picking on Sk's in fact I play one as an alt.  I like to think that all classes have their good/bad points.  I also learned that you should use your bad points to help you role play, as this is an RPG not to dwell on.  Bad points others have should be treated as a unique ability in itself and that person should be thought better because of it.<br><br>To all you Rangers out there reading this post good luck happy hunting and in the end Gate well :)  Dying happens to everyone (including SK's) and should not discourage you from playing the class you like.  I like the Sk over the Ranger for some reasons but I have more reasons to make the Ranger my Main class over ALL the others in the end.  Don't let anyone tell you that you are a mana drain, or mob fodder, or any other terms that apply to your class choice.<br><br>To the dumb SK Kildiar shut up nobody likes you.  I learned the only way to deal with your menace is to wait in a tree and shoot you where it looks like it will hurt the most.<br><br>Bremi Gendrolis Ranger of Tunare 50th season<br>Vejjita 22nd Knight of Shadow  (Innoruk)<br>Torrun Tobattle 21st Paladin to Tunare<br><br>(Other characters deleted or of to small of level to even name)<br><br>&quot;I have Ranger gated enough to fence my entire yard!&quot;     Bremi's Creed<br>&quot;Ignorance is a Double Edged Bannana.&quot; So sayeth many.<br>What's the difference between a Ranger and a corpse?

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I agree with everyone who thinks these arguments are stupid and pointless. I'm just trying to save ANOTHER SK from thinking we suck. K, lets look at what spells we have at 22 and compare. You say our melee skills are the same, and at lvl 22 it all depends on the weapon, so my arguement is with the spells. BTW, this is figting a NON animal and a NON undead creature. We can snare whatever we are fighting, skin like rock for 100 HP and 8 AC, heal for 33 HP (for downtime), self only damage sheild for 1 HP while giving 6 AC, root, cure poison, buff AGI by 18, invis, AOE nuke for 25 damage, self only increase ATK by 14, DD target for 37 damage and pull with harmony.<br>Now, the SK spells. You got a lvl 12 pet or "DoT", lifetap for 30, snare with 110 damage DoT, self only increase ATK by 22, shadow step yourself away from trouble so you can run to zone, cast an 18 second fear spell, steal 10 STR, can pull well and taunts well.<br>Well, I admit you can raise your ATK rating more, DoTs are better, a lesser snare with DoT, raise STR by 10, fear (for a very short period of time), and tank. Sounds good to me. And, now, for Rangers. We can nuke, snare, damage sheild, buff better, invis, and pull well. Cant tank. To me both of these classes sound fairly equal. We are each better than the other at some stuff. I'm not trashing SK or Rangers, I'm just saying we are ALL usefull. In our own special way )&nbsp;&nbsp;-Julily<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I KNOW you did not just suggest hunting those adorable overgrown white teddy bears in Everfrost, you ARE a Ranger did you forget? hehe j/k role play the way you see fit, but to answer your question here are a few suggestions:<br><br>1) Preferred solution: FORGET ABOUT MONEY. You need to level asap. You can do that with any rusty sword you find in BlackBurrow and you will find a lot because you need to go there NOW NOW NOW.. Do not pass go and forget about the 200PP because it is just not happening. you can get from 9 to level 16 in Blackburrow in less than a RL week(just a few hours a day playing time) as long as you are carefull, group with non idiots and learn the zone and where to hunt. This is also a crucial time where you will be developing some lasting frienships/groupmates. (just leave halfling rogues alone they level too fast and will leave you behind).<br><br>The more you worry about money the less you will gain exp.. and in the long run you want exp over money ANY day. You are a few levels away from getting both. However, if you are desparate for cash and you are going to ignore my first peice of advice then here's 2 ideas.<br><br>1) Get a tailoring kit and put a point in tailoring as soon as you can. Go to Everfrost and kill spiders. I suggest making your home point at Bandl's to be safe (love those big bad arse Barb guards:) The reason I&nbsp;&nbsp;want you to go with spiders is this: you need 2 spider silks to make thread and you want to make stacks and stacks of thread. I have seen hi lvl players offering as much as 20pp ON THE AVERAGE for stacks of thread in East Karana.(and this is prob the best zone to go to sell them but wait till 16 or so.. NK is kinda hazardous till you get to know it) While passing through there the other day someone was offering 50pp a stack!!<br><br>The reason I like this method is because Everfrost is also great exp for someone in your lvl range, Just watch out for Orc Shamans and Icebone Skellies. Kill snow leapords and spiders.. then move onto mammoth calves with a partner. Also easy zone to find a partner or 2 in as there are always Shaman looking to group with a tank-like individual.<br><br>Another place is Bandits in West karana. While passing through there the other day I saw some new mobs I hadn't seen before that gave my lvl 33 Ranger the creeps, so the curse of the Karanas might have made this a bit more dangerous place to hunt, but the bandit farm is great for sashes.<br><br>Sashes are like gnoll teeth.. you turn them in close to the paladin guild in Qeynos for exp, some cash, and a bronze item (weapon or shield) that you can turn around and sell. If I remember right.. it averages out to be about 3-4 pp per sash. on a good night in a good group you can haul in 3-4 sashes an hour. I would came back to the bandit camps into my early 20's for some quick solo sash action to make some plat. One warning: The casters HURT YOU BIG TIME! Major undercon. If you are not in a full group (and a good one) of mostly 10-14 players, I wouldn't advise taking on more than one or two at a time. I had full groups taken down many times by 3 casters at once, but it is GREAT learning for later groups.<br><br>Other advice to give: <br><br>Don't ignore 1hs because you will want to dual wield when you get it (17?)<br>However, 2hs will serve you far better until you get there. Also work on pierce if you have time.<br><br>Don't waste more than 1 skill point in anything until you get to 20 and see where your weaknesses in your skills lie. All skills will improve with use.<br><br>Sense heading is a bear to raise, I suggest mapping one of your movement keys (for example right arrow)<br>to HotKey #10 in bank one (your primary HotKey bank) and putting your sense heading hotkey in that slot. Now whenever you turn right you will automatically use sense heading and it will be up in no time flat. DO this with any and all skills you don't use frequently. I did NOT know about this and I thought I would die a slow painful death before I ever got sense heading maxxed out. Now I am working on hide and sneak and forage (that is why you want to save your skill points, I wish I had 30 or 40 in the bank to throw at forage, I am in HELL trying to get it up there)<br><br>I don't know about the rest of the Rangers out there, but nothing gives me better pride in being a Ranger than fletching a decent starter bow for a young ranger. I normally bowyer and give away 2 or 3 bows whenever I am in a zone where there is a Ranger guild and I see a ton of non twinked low lvl Rangers around. If you happen to see a High level Ranger around the guild and he isn't doing anything (most of the time they will be fletching heh) ask politley if there are any services you may be able to perform for him in exchange for a starter bow and see what happens ;). <br><br>FLETCHING: Rangers and fletchers go hand in hand. Regardless of whether you experience RHS (Ranger hate syndrome) or not, there will be times you want to be alone by yourself in the woods while dawn creeps silently in the distance behind you. Tracking that elusive prey with bow in hand and arrow nocked. That is the essence and lifeblood of a Ranger. Fletching will keep you broke. It will make you want to pull your hair out, it will not make you rich BUT!! Remember this:<br><br>A bow never tells you it doesn't want to hunt by your side<br>A bow never asks for half of the looting right to your kills<br>A bow never asks for a sow and requires no mana to maintain<br>A bow never breaks during stressful fights like the morale of a party member will.<br><br>So put a skill point into it asap and consult one of the great guides on the net (search for "EQ fletching guide") <br><br>A Ranger without a bow is 1/6th Druid and 1/2<br>Warrior.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Oh, we have suck HP, we cant be any good. Our melee is just as good as a Warrior, and if the tank knows how to play her/his class, then the Ranger shouldnt get hit much.

Bows CAN be nice, but, our melee is better." <br><br>Geez, dunno you ever roleplay?&nbsp;&nbsp;Guess you think this is a fps eh? If it doesn't kill something then its not a useful skill? Play a class/race without forage and see if you don't miss it.  Its just as valuable to me in roleplay as SoW is.  <br><br>What kind of ranger doesn't rely on his bow solo'n and guess what...your epic requires you to forage some no drop stuff. When your hanging around in Everfrost foraging over and over for weeks on end cuz you don't have the forage skill to get what you need you will wish you would have that great skill built up.  I am at 183 skill right now in forage, I have not bought food in almost 10 lvls and the last time I had to buy food was because I gave away food to all the party members (they sure were happy I had forage) that were running low and I was going to town to buy some more fletching stuff (because I know our archery is just as good as our melee). Ask some Druids that didn't work forage how hard is to find an FV rose when you need one, those are the ones that are willing to give 100pp for one. I give them as gifts on top of my donation for ports at times.  Hmmm and lets talk about trade skills damn forage comes in handy, I am beginning to be a rather good cook, oh and my brewing is getting rather good if I do say so myself. Sure for group usefulness its not the end all beat all but for roleplay its right up there with our other skills.<br><br>As for melee being the best we have, I beg to differ you won't be solo'n higher lvl mobs with melee unless your ultra twink.  The only way your gonna take gonna be able to solo Hill Giants or Sand Giants before 45th is using your bow. I know this, because started hunting them with my bow at 39th.<br><br>There are few higher lvl Rangers than me with less archery than I (I am at 200)have, that wish they worked their archery more so they can fully utilize their Trueshot /disc.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I've read through these discussions and seen some interesting stuff and seen some serious BS. I'm a 52 Ranger and also have a couple other high level characters and would like to have my say.<br><br>Rangers, like any class, have a place in the world of Norrath. Period. They have their strengths and they have their weaknesses, as players you have to use your characters strengths and avoid the weaknesses. In most places, especially dungeons, people say you cannot get by without the "Big Three" : Warrior, Cleric, Enchanter. I say, BULL! All of the classes are well balanced enough now (and after two years they ought to be) that almost any combination of characters can be useful AND successful. Oh, don't get me wrong, when I'm in a group I always look for the big three as well, if they are available, but to turn down a group because they are missing one or all of them is ridiculous.<br><br>Rangers are now a viable solo class up into high 40's maybe even low 50's with the addition of panic animal a few months ago. Before that, they were not. Now I'm not saying no ranger ever soloed or that it was impossible, but I am saying it wasn't fun before that addition and the lowering of level needed to cast some spells (SoW, etc...). Whether or not it's faster to solo or group is a personal preference and I for one am glad they gave rangers this abilty to solo more efficiently.<br><br>The key to being a good ranger is to know your class and be able to get the most potential out of it. That potential changes in every situation and with every group. Sometimes you are a secondary tank needed to deal max damage, sometimes you are main tank needed to take damage, sometimes you'll be a replacement druid for buffs, sometimes your main responsibility will be snaring, etc... it is always changing and dynamic. The thing is you are grouped with smart, knowledgeable players the group will shift to utilize your abilities and limit your weaknesses, if they aren't smart or knowledgeable, well those just bitch and complain about a great class that they don't wanna take the time to understand.<br><br>My advice to all the new Rangers starting out is look at what type of Ranger you want to play, then chart out your career using info from websites and discussions like this to figure out where to go and what items to get. Unfortunately, a Ranger is only as good as his gear at the higher levels, and while the same can be said for some other classes it holds the most true for Rangers. Figure out what gear you want to get, save all your money, pick your battles and mobs, and most of all have fun.<br><br>The Ranger is arguably one of the most popular classes in all of Fantasy / D&D type worlds and there is no reason why they shouldn't be popular on Norrath. At one time they were very weak and ineffectual as compared to some of the classes but those days are gone. Now we are a force to be reckoned with and our voices shall be heard!<br><br>So good luck to all and if you didn't like the positive things I had to say about Rangers, well, whatever negative feelings you have about my opinion... is how I feel about yours =0)<br><br><br>Icehawk Forestguard<br>52 Pathfinder (Domination)<br>Erollisi Marr<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hi fellow rangers...it's 2 'o clock in the morning right now and i'm kinda tired... All i have to say is rangers are awesome.&nbsp;&nbsp;My ranger is 50th lvl. I soloed all the way. Sure there were some times when i grouped for certain items or faction, but when i wanted uber xp, i soloed. I was 40th 10 days (RL) ago; ever since then i've been soloing in EW.  Some advice for 22+ soloers : learn to use panic animal...it is your friend. Hmmm...i guess i could give a list of where i soloed...20-22(kinda hazy): Grouped at the goblin caves in LOIO. 22-25: Soloed sabertooths and grimalkins in LOIO. 25-30 Sarnak Recruits in LOIO. 30-32: Grouped in FM (crappy xp..shoulda went to Iceclad). 32-35: Grouped in OT (not bad xp, but the Goons are a PITA). 35-40 Soloed sabertooth tigresses and kunark rhinoes in OT (great xp). 40-42: Soloed dire wolves, snow cougars, and tundra kodiaks at the bridge in EW. 42-45: moved further into EW, soloing dire wolves, snow cougars, kodiaks, and some wooly mammoths. 45-50: Soloed wooly and tundra mammoths, wooly rhinoes, savage dire wolfs, walruses (just about anything blue and animalian(? hehe /yawn)), and a blue snow cougar/dire wolf every once and a while.  Like i said, there were times when i grouped for items (eg: Ry'Gorr fort in EW for Ry'Gorr armor) and faction, but i soloed when i wanted good xp.<br>Ack! now its 2:30<br>/yawn<br><br>Solomos<br>Ranger of the 50th Season<br>&lt;Rangers of Tunare&gt;<br>Prexus Server<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
