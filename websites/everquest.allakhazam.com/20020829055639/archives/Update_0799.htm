<p><b><font color="#000066">July 30, 1999:&nbsp; Thanks to the many people
who sent in information on the new <a href="Skills/Poison_Making.htm">poison
skill</a>.&nbsp; I think I have a pretty comprehensive guide up now, along
with some actual
<a href="Skills/poisonr.htm">recipes</a> and the <a href="Skills/Potteryr.htm">pottery</a>
vial recipes.&nbsp; Information keeps trickling in on how the last update
affected the quests.&nbsp; Some have definitely had their faction changed
(Ale for Beur will not help you get faction with Freeport Militia anymore).&nbsp;
However, I have also been told that the amount of experience you get for
many quests has increased.&nbsp; I might go out this weekend and experiment
a little.&nbsp; I'm also starting to get some item descriptions sent in
for items from the plane of fear.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; From what I can see,
each class has a set of mega armor they can get there.&nbsp; If you are
brave enough to risk going there, it seems well worth the trip.&nbsp; I
have completely updated the <a href="zones/Antonica/Oasis.htm">Oasis</a>
zone description.&nbsp; I'm going to try to go through the zones over the
next couple of weeks and put in better descriptions.</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000066">July 29, 1999:&nbsp; Verant sure was busy on
Tuesday.&nbsp; More things seemed to have changed than were in the official
announcement.&nbsp; Several people have told me that faction adjustments
for several quests have been eliminated or changed, so be wary of the quest
faction chart until I get updates.&nbsp; From the descriptions I was sent,
I'm guessing that they got rid of the easy faction raising quests, like
the Ale for Beur quest.&nbsp; If this is true, it makes most quests even
more worthless than before and is yet one more blow for doing quests as
opposed to just killing things.&nbsp; Also, I have been told that numerous
necromancers lost many of the the research words they had stocked, forcing
them to search all over again for these rare items.&nbsp; Let's hope that
gets corrected.</font></b>

to stress test their servers yesterday certainly stress tested gamestats.&nbsp;
This site had over 23,000 visitors!&nbsp; I'm happy to say that there was
no noticable slow down with that heavy use.&nbsp; This is a good update.&nbsp;
Several nice new quests have been added, including what I believe is the
start of the wizard's ice comet quest (in Everfrost), the new research
quest in N Karana, a lead on the tome of ages quest, and a couple of weapon
quests.&nbsp; Thanks to those who pointed out the the Eye of Stormhammer
quest does work.&nbsp; It must be a faction thing.&nbsp; Also, the Cure
for Lempick quest in W. Karana seems like a relatively easy way for a lower
level paladin or cleric to get a decent weapon, assuming it works as I
was told.&nbsp; There is also some limited information on the new poison
skill for thieves.</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000066">July 8, 1999:&nbsp; It's amazing how quickly
information circulates around the web.&nbsp; Someone has apparantly finished
the Zimels Blades quest and acquired Soulfire.&nbsp; I have posted the
stats in <a href="equipment/2HSlash.htm">2 Hand Slashing</a>.&nbsp; Also,
if you want to see a screen shot of it go to&nbsp;</font></b> <b><a href="http://www.terrafusion.com/soulfire/">http://www.terrafusion.com/soulfire/</a>
.&nbsp;<font color="#000066"> It is pretty impressive.&nbsp; Almost makes
you want to play a Paladin.&nbsp; Several Brewers have sent in the <a href="Skills/Brewingr.htm">correct
bog juice recipe</a>.&nbsp; One even included a screen shot, so I believe
that it is accurate.&nbsp; I would like to reorganize the guild list to
list guilds by server, so if your guild has a link there without a server
designation, please let me know what server you are on.&nbsp; A lot of
new stuff was added today.&nbsp; New or updated information has been added

<p><b><font color="#000066">July 7, 1999:&nbsp; I think of this site as
a community resource as much as my personal site, so don't be afraid to
give me feedback on things you would like to see here that you believe
would make it more enjoyable to visit or would give you information that
you are currently missing. Of course, I give no guarantees.&nbsp; I know
I need a better graphics design and backgrounds, but those will take time.
(I'm definitely not an artist).&nbsp; I'm currently working on a faction
page by quest, and also on putting up a list of books recommended by others.
(I know it's not EQ related, but it's fun and many people seem to like
it). If there is something you would like here that would not be outrageously
difficult to put together (remember I'm not a programmer), e-mail me and
I'll consider it.&nbsp; Some ideas I have are an editorial page where you
can submit your opinions and rants, additional message boards [although
the web seems full of EQ boards], and a chat room.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">Along these lines, I am opening the site to
taking on affiliates.&nbsp; I'll add a page that details this information,
but basically, if you have a site that you believe compliments, but doesn't
just duplicate, mine and would like to join me and gamestats, let me know.
Obvious examples are class and race specific sites. Please, I'm not interested
in start up pages, but instead in pages that have been around long enough
for the webmaster to realize how much work is involved and to have demonstrated
the desire and ability to put in the effort.&nbsp; If you would like to
get in on the fun, let me know.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">On to the update news. Alas, the bog juice
recipe turned out to be a false rumor.&nbsp; Back to the old drawing board.&nbsp;
I wanted to give him enough time to work out the kinks before I steered
all of the visitors here his way, but check out the player's data base
now up on the </font><a href="http://www.harpers.net/bard/index.htm">EQ
Bardic Guide</a><font color="#000066">. You can add your information in
and then search the existing information on other players and characters
in various ways. It's pretty cool. The following sections have updates:

<p><b><font color="#000066">July 1, 1999:&nbsp; Happy Canada Day to our
Canadian Brethren (I know there are a lot of visitors here from north of
the border).&nbsp; I've had some trouble sending e-mail the last few days,
so if you didn't get a response from me it probably didn't go through (I'm
pretty sure that I <u>received</u> all of the e-mail though).&nbsp; If
you haven't checked out Ever Event in a&nbsp; while, give it another look.&nbsp;
Brett got off to a rough start, but is starting to get together a very
nice site (some of you may remember how bad this site looked when I first
put it up&nbsp; - not that it still couldn't use a little spiffing up).&nbsp;
If your guild or group has an upcoming event planned, please let him know.&nbsp;
It would be nice to have everything calendered in one place for easy reference.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">There is a new book poll up.&nbsp; Go under
books to vote for you favorite Science Fiction and Fantasy Novel.&nbsp;
It's a big category, so I'm going to have to keep the choices somewhat
limited.&nbsp; If I've made an obvious exclusion, let me know and I'll
consider including it.&nbsp; I'd also note that druids seem to be dominating
the favorite class poll.&nbsp; Don't forget to vote for your favorite.</font></b>
