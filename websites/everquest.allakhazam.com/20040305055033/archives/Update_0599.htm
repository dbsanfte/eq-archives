<p><b><font color="#000066">May 21, 1999:&nbsp; The gamestats server has
experienced some problems this morning due to [you won't believe this]
problems upstream with UUNet [arrrgh that name sends shivers down my spine].&nbsp;
So if you are having problems with your connection, it should be resolved
soon.&nbsp; Thanks to you who pointed out that the EQ Vault announcement
about a new zone was wrong.&nbsp; It in fact is the old Solusek B dungeon,
which has been renamed Nagafen's Lair.&nbsp; I have updated the Antonica
Zone descriptions to reflect this.&nbsp; This is a very high level dungeon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><b><font color="#000066">May 20, 1999:&nbsp; The following announcement
was posted on EQ Vault.&nbsp; I thought it was worth posting here:&nbsp;
"New Zone - Kelleton informed me that Aradune (aka Brad McQuaid) posted
a system wide message last night around 1:30 EST informing players that
a new zone called Nagafen's Layer is now&nbsp; operational."&nbsp; If someone
finds out more, such as where this zone is and what's in it, let me know
so that I can update the guide for everyone to reference.&nbsp; Many changes
were made to the equipment guide.&nbsp; Thanks to those who pointed out
some errors.&nbsp; Please let me know of any mistakes in the guide, and
send in any information on items not included.&nbsp; I would like to start
compiling lists of magic items.&nbsp; The following sections have had information
added or modified:&nbsp; </font></b><a href="quests/Q_Qeynos.htm">Qeynos

<p><b><font color="#000066">May 19, 1999:&nbsp; I have made another major
addition to the site today, adding in a new equipment guide.&nbsp; It is
linked on the menu to the left.&nbsp; Presently, it does not include weapons,
though I hope to add them soon.&nbsp; I have arranged the equipment items
by the slot they are placed in.&nbsp; Thus, you will find all rings under
"finger slot items", belts under "waist slot items", etc.&nbsp; I debated
putting them in the form of a chart or table, but decided a list format
would give more room and flexibility to add extra information such as where
an item can be found, or how an item is made.&nbsp; The lists should include
most of the basic items along with some magic items.&nbsp; As with everything
else on the site, I welcome your input on additions or corrections to the
various lists.&nbsp; I know for a fact that I am missing many magic items,
so please send in any information you have.&nbsp; Some very nice quest
updates today, including a hint on getting the elusive Erud's Tonic and
a lot more information on the complex Zimel's Blade Quest.&nbsp; The following

I&nbsp; moved and then gamestats ftp server went down.&nbsp; So today there
are essentially 5 days worth of updates in one.&nbsp; Yippee - Go nuts.&nbsp;
Highlights are a new guide on Shadowkinghts by Khan, a slew of Necro spell
research formulae sent in by Damandred Ashaman (I altered that section
so that I can add each class as an individual section), a lot of new jewelry
recipes from D'Gourges Myndsey, a new blacksmithing guide by Soldric of
Felwithe and a solution to that pesky honey jum quest (see Misty Thicket
quests).&nbsp; Additions or changes have been made to the following sections:&nbsp;
Halas quests, Grobb quests, Freeport quests, Qeynos quests, Surefall Glades
quests, Western Karana quests, Kelethin quests, Chat terms, Tips, Guild
Links, Toxxulia Forest quests, Erudin quests, Archery skill, Jewelry recipes,
Factions, Necromancer Spell Research, Magician Spell Research, Rivervale
quests, Misty Thicket quests, Qeynos Hills quests, Shadowknight class,
Blacksmithing, Tailoring recipes, Kithicor zone, Highhold zone, Crushbone
zone, Splitpaw zone, Southern Ro zone, Rathe zone..</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">May 13, 1999:&nbsp; Sabrael has sent in another
excellent and entertaining guide.&nbsp; This one is on archery.&nbsp; Check
it out under the skills section.&nbsp; Added a new map of Antonica Zone
Connections sent to me by Trutz.&nbsp; Also updated the following:&nbsp;
chat terms, N Karana quests, S Karana quests, Surefall Glades quests, Ogguk
quests, Kelethin quests, Guild links, Spell Research Recipes, Tinkering
recipes, Necro group combat strategies, Tips.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">May 12, 1999:&nbsp; Thanks to those of you
who sent in faction information.&nbsp; The list is growing, but far from
complete.&nbsp; Please try to jot down the messages you get after a kill
and send them in to me to add to the list.&nbsp; As people are getting
higher in levels, faction is becoming more and more important.&nbsp; Added&nbsp;
links or information to the following sections:&nbsp; Qeynos quests, Halas
quests, Qeynos Hills quests, Kelethin quests, Freeport quests, Kerra quests,
Erud's Crossing quests, Grobb quests, Smithing, Jewelry recipes, Nektulos
(new map link), Steamfont (new map link), Druid Class, General Links, Rivervale
quests.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">May 11, 1999:&nbsp; I have added two new sections.&nbsp;
The first section is a faction list.&nbsp; It is very preliminary, and
I want to give special thanks to Kylyni of Felwithe for providing the initial
information to get the list started.&nbsp; The faction list is broken down
into three sections:&nbsp; a zone by zone list of the faction groups;&nbsp;
an alphabetical list of monsters with which factions are raised or lowered
by killing them;&nbsp; and an alphabetical list of groups with which monster
kills raise or lower faction with that group.&nbsp; I am relying upon the
readers here to send in the information necessary to fill in the many gaps,
so please make note of the faction messages you get when you kill something
and send it in to me to include on the list (Note that the area of the
kill is usually necessary).&nbsp; My hope is that you can use the lists
to figure out who to kill or leave alone to raise faction with important
groups such as your guild.&nbsp; The second section I added is more for
newbies.&nbsp; It is a list of common chat terms used in the game.&nbsp;
As with everything on this site, I welcome any additions or corrections
to this list.&nbsp;&nbsp; I now know why there are so many cook books in
the world.&nbsp; It seems that, like in real life, Everquest chefs like
to share their trade with the world.&nbsp; I have added an additional baker's
guide sent in by Hugo the Halfling.&nbsp; He also sent me a slew of recipes.&nbsp;
It is possible that the list now has all of the known cooking recipes in
the world of Norrath.&nbsp; Check out the new guide.&nbsp;&nbsp; Added
new information or links to the following sections:&nbsp; Bard Class, General
Links, Butcherblock, Ocean of Tears, Splitpaw, Crushbone quests, Qeynos
quests, Neriak quests, Ogguk quests, Halas quests, Everfrost quests, Western
Karana quests.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">May 10, 1999:&nbsp; As you can see, I have
reformatted the table of contents to get rid of the buttons.&nbsp; This
will allow me to continue to add additional sections without things getting
too unwieldy.&nbsp; I have broken the last of the old player's guide into
3 sections:&nbsp; Character creation, Starting off and Combat tips.&nbsp;
In the works is a faction guide and a page of common chat terms.&nbsp;
I also added a section for guild links.&nbsp; These will just go in a list
with no comments, since I do not intend to push one guild or another on
this page.&nbsp; If you wish to have you guild linked from here, please
e-mail me.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">Information has been added to the following
sections:&nbsp; Kaladim quests, Ogguk quests, Qeynos quests, Neriak quests,
Ak'Anon quests, Lavastorm quests, Erudin quests, Steamfont quests, Freeport
quests, Runnyeye quests, Surefall Glades Quests, Rivervale quests, Qeynos
hills quests, Lesser Faydark Quests, Kelethin quests, Western Commonlands
quests, Upper Guk quests, Druid Class, Command List.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">May 9, 1999:&nbsp; Added in new guides and
recipes for fletching, brewing and pottery, thanks to some excellent submissions
by Sabrael, Kozmo and Mustadio.&nbsp; Sabrael's fletching guide is particularly
entertaining and detailed, and I recommend it to all aspiring fletchers.&nbsp;
I have lots of quests to add which I hope to get to tomorrow.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">May 7, 1999:&nbsp; The direct links to the
Japanese maps now work (I hope).&nbsp; If you haven't checked them out
yet, you should do so.&nbsp; I think they are by far the best maps out
there.&nbsp; In addition to the maps that were linked before, he has added
maps for Black Burrow (Surface), Lake Rath, Kithicore Forest, Southern
Karanas, Dagnor's Cauldron, Greater Faydark, Kelethin and Lesser Faydark.&nbsp;
Yahoo.&nbsp; More maps.&nbsp; My thanks to Lilith and Eve for letting me
on to chat with Brad and Shon.&nbsp; They seem very concerned with responding
to the input of the game players in order to make this the best game there
is (which it already is).</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">Brad McQuade and Shon Damron are being interviewed
tonight on L &amp; E, and they have asked me to come on and ask some questions.&nbsp;

Erudin quests, Kerra quests.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">May 6, 1999:&nbsp; Tolthis has sent in a nice
long list of Baking and Tinkering Recipes.&nbsp; These have now been added
to the respective skill lists.&nbsp; If you have bought books on one of
the trade skills (smithing, pottery, baking, spell research, jewelry, etc.)
and are willing to share their secrets, please e-mail me the recipes/formulae
in them, including the books in which they are found if posible.&nbsp;
I also still need guides on several skills.&nbsp; Also the questmaster
Kozmo has sent in a whole pile of quests for Rivervale to keep you halflings
happy.&nbsp; He promises more to come.</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000066">May 5, 1999:&nbsp; Verrant now has a page which
lists updates and changes in the game.&nbsp; I have added it to the general
links section.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;</font></b> <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/indev.html">here</a>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000066">
as well.&nbsp; Check it out.&nbsp; It is very informative.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Kelethin quests, Butcherblock quests, Highhold Keep quests, Rivervale quests,
Innothule Swamp quests, Ogguk quests, Neriak quests, Befallen quests, Freeport
quests, Brewing Recipes, General Links.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">May 4, 1999:&nbsp; Whew!&nbsp; Busy Day.&nbsp;
I have finished changing the quest section so that each zone now has its
own page of quests, instead of the being one long 100 meg 20 page list
of quests.&nbsp; There may be a few kinks I have to work out, but hopefully
it will work.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">I have updated the skills section and am looking
for information.&nbsp; I have broken the skills section into individual
pages with a page on each skill for basic information and for recipes/formulae.&nbsp;
If you believe you know about an individual skill, and wish to share your
knowledge, I would love to have you write a guide on that skill.&nbsp;
Multiple guides are welcome as well.&nbsp; Just e-mail me.&nbsp; Right
now the only skills thoroughly covered are baking, blacksmithing and fishing
</font><font color="#FF0000">[Thanks
to an addition on Smithing made by Garalorn]</font><font color="#000066">,
with a guide promised on fletching.&nbsp; Also, the skills each have recipes
and formulae that are found in books throughout the game.&nbsp; I would
like to collect that information here.&nbsp; If you know of a recipe that
is not included (Which is pretty much all of them right now), please e-mail
me.&nbsp; As usual, include your game name so that I can credit you for
your submission.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">Along these lines, I am making several other
changes to the site.&nbsp; Because EQ will not let you minimize the game,
you are forced to print out any useful information to read while in the
game.&nbsp; I want to make the information on this site easily printable.&nbsp;
This means breaking it down into smaller pages.&nbsp; I have started with
the skills section, as explained above, and plan on doing the same with
the quest section soon so that you can print out the quests zone by zone.&nbsp;
I plan on leaving the zone sections as they are.&nbsp; I will probably
then redo the index to make everything easier to find (Hopefully).&nbsp;
Let me know what you think.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">The following sections have been updated:&nbsp;
North Ro, Black Burrow, Erudin, Kaladim, Southern Karana, Qeynos, General
Links.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">May 3, 1999:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make it easier
for you to follow additions and changes on the site, I will place either&nbsp;<img SRC="iconnew.gif" height=12 width=31>or&nbsp;<img SRC="iconupdated.gif" height=12 width=60>
in front of the affected section.&nbsp; (For Quests this will only go in
the quest section, not the zone section).&nbsp; Hopefully, I will remember
to delete them after a few days so that everything doesn't start to say
new or updated.&nbsp; Speaking of, I have added a number of new tips and
some new quests.&nbsp; Also added a map of Nektulos Forest sent in By Saro.&nbsp;
The following sections have been added to or updated:&nbsp; Kaladim, Surefall
Glades, Qeynos, Nektulos, Steamfont, Runnyeye, Tips, Player's Guide Food
and Drink</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">Don't forget if you run across a new quest
