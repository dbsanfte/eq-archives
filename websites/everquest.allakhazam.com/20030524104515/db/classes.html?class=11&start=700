	   <tr><td colspan=2>Far far too many wizards just don't seem to know how to play in a group.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm goin to tell you how.  You are the final resort.  You are the one who gets the kill.  Whatever you do, don't feel you have to blast away at the Mob just because the fighters are hitting away at it.  Nothing is more annoying in a group than waiting around for a wizard who is oom because he spent way too much mana making an easy kill.  Also, nothing is more annoying than a wizard who constantly draws the Mob to him because he cast too early and runs around yelling for help.<br><br>When your tank brings in a Mob, do a /assist.  Then sit down and start medding.  Watch the tank's hit point meter and the Mob's hit point meter.  If the tank gets in trouble, by all means get up and blast away to save his butt (unless you have a healer who can do it far better then you can).  Otherwise, wait until the Mob gets to half damage, and then get up and blast away at it.  Snag those that run away an kill them.  A good wizard will almost always get the groups kill.   As soon as the battle is over, sit and med again.  You can go whole battles without more than a glimpse at what you are fighting.<br><br>Yes, you will indeed spend most of each battle sitting on your butt.  That's your job.  You're a wizard.  If you're party doesn't understand, get a better group.  They probably don't know how to play anyways.  Ideally, you should spend the same amount of time medding for mana as the tanks spend sitting for hp.  If the group is waiting around for you to gain mana, then you are casting too much.  If you are sitting around waiting for them to heal, cast more often.  Adjust your tactics for your particular group.  A properly played wizard can easily double a group's effectiveness.  A poorly played wizard is just a liabilllity.<br><br>Da Wiz<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

There are a few criteria for this to hold true: <br><br>1.) You are level 35+ and have sit-med. This is important because you DO need to know exactly what the tanks bring in during multiple mob pulls. Simply knowing what they are currently attacking is not enough. <br><br>2.) You are not sitting in the pull path, or in multiple mob pulls you are not sitting close enough to aggro the additional mobs. <br><br>It takes some experience to get a feeling for just how close you can sit to a mob under various conditions, but this information is important so experiment with it. <br><br>- Melee'ing is mostly a waste of time at higher levels, even if you are at full mana. This is an individual call, and you need to decide if your melee output damage is really high enough to warrant using it. I really don't recommend non-spell fighting unless you have a weapon with an effect or a weapon that can cast a spell itself, such as the Soloist Icy Wand. Things to think about before melee'ing: <br><br>1.) Swinging = aggro. You don't even have to hit the mob. Anytime you swing at a mob you build on your aggro, even if it is only a small bit. <br><br>2.) You have to get close. Distance plays a factor in aggro, and if you have casted on the mob during the fight it may attack unexpectedly if you step into melee range. Also, if you get closer to the mob than the tanks (there just isn't "melee distance", but rather degrees of melee distance) it could also turn onto you. <br><br>3.) Your melee skills suck ;). While at lower levels you may be able to significantly contribute to a battle, you will find that this becomes less and less true as your character progresses. Ask yourself, would it be better if I melee'd or should I just cast a light nuke and sit to med briefly? Most of the time you will do more damage from a safer distance by just casting a lower level nuke and then sitting to med the little mana you used up. <br><br>- If you are not at full, MEDITATE! Recently I started a new character, and I can't tell you how much I hate to see a Cleric cast a heal, and then continue to stand around watching the battle like a newbie, which perhaps they are. Of course, a few more heals later they are "OOM" because they did not sit and med when they should have. What is a real killer is when they still don't med but instead jump in and try to help my SK melee...what I needed was a heal soon, not someone adding a pitiful amount of melee damage to my own ;). Mana = life blood, if you aren't full and there is nothing urgent to do then MED! :D <br><br>- I disagree with the original poster - getting the kill isn't your job, making sure the mob doesn't get away is your job. Sometimes this translates into over-nuking the mob as it nears its death, but that is far from the ideal solution. One of the responders already covered snare, and I'd like to expand on that topic. As a mob loses hitpoints it weakens, and if it gets really low on hitpoints its movement slows to a crawl, sometimes even a stop, particularly if it is snared. Your job then, is to nuke it to death with a minimum of over-kill (within 50 damage or so) or to hurt it bad enough to bring it down to "crawl" speed. The tanks should then be merrily slashing and bashing it in the back, bringing it down before it can get far at all (meanwhile you have gone back to medding, right?) :D. In dungeons with tight corners it may be necessary to over-nuke the mob, however, as two steps may be all it needs to round the corner for friends :(. The one thing you really want to beware is nuking it hard enough to make it run, but not hard enough to slow it to a crawl. This is a very, VERY bad scenario. Luckily it is controllable with experience - know how much your nukes do, know how much it will take off the mob's life bar, and have different "sized" nukes memmed for different situation (a big nuke and a small nuke). A good wizard should be able to visualize how much his nuke will take off the mob's hitpoint bar and account for the damage that will be done by the other players before ever casting his spell. This is really important - perhaps you know this mob will run at half health, and your nuke will only bring it to 55% health, but you MUST account for the damage done by others during your casting or you may suddenly find the mob down to 45% health instead of the predicted 55%, and running like mad down the corridor to get friends :O. I speak from experience ;). <br><br>- Area Effect spells need their own thread...actually, they need several ;).

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I support the idea of nuking towards the middle of a mob's life bar rather than towards the end or beginning.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of your tanks have weapons that are procing as well as situations where some Cleric or Pali will cast a small nuke or Dot.  The thing is, trying to avoid corpse nuking, that is, thinking you are gonna get in the killing blow, only to end up frying something already dead--talk about a waste of mana!  On the other side of the situation, nuking too early leads to unnecessary resists and/or having the mob agro on you early in a combat round.  Since i don't yet have med/look ability, I usually stand, assits the primary tank while assesing the situations, including factors of what other group members are going to be able to contribute, then sit and med till I see the targeted mob's health is at about 70-80%.  Then I will add one major nuke.  If I don't get full dmg, I may add another lesser nuke--then I sit and med.  Depending on the area, particularly tight spaced dungeons, I may jump up on a mob near it's death and fry it if it is fleeing too close to places I know it's friends are waiting. Otherwise I try to avoid "Corpse Nukes" at all costs--they are just the worst waste of mana possible.<br><br>Another thought for groups is that if I see that the tanks are enganged heavily, and the healer gets agro'd, I will often throw a max nuke at that mob to get it off the healer.  The healer will usually then keep me healed while I either burn the mob, or some tank comes to pull it off me--or I just stun and root that mob and move to the other side of the battle to continue medding. If the mob returns on me, the tanks are usually in a better position by that time to taunt off me.<br><br>And yes, we need to get some AoE threads going here.  There are some awesome ones on Gaffes, but the topic is always worth keeping up, since some newer players may never find the old threads in this or other forums.<br><br><br>Kelvyn, 30th wiz, Veeshan<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have read your posts about grouping and I would like to add my 2 cp's worth.<br><br>First of all, when fighting in groups, I always have at least one or two high level spells memorized, at least one spell of a lower level, root, and Tishan's Clash.<br><br>When starting a fight with a creature yellow or red, I wait until the tanks take off anywhere from 15- 20% of the monsters health and cast my most powerful spell on it, then immediately sit down and med. During this time I watch the health of the monster, plus the health of my group members. When the monster loses about another 20- 25% of his health I cast another spell, which one really depends on how many tanks are in the group. sometimes I cast another powerful one, sometimes I cast a weaker one. In a situation where we have at least 2 tanks and a healer, i try not to cast more than twice per fight against yellows or reds. Sometimes I may need to cast more if the tanks are taking too much damage (especially if we have no healer). I never pull mobs on me using this method, and I am usually alway the only one who always has full health (this has caused a couple of people to get mad at me who didnt understand the role of the caster).<br><br>When fighting blacks (whites), or blues, or greens, I try not to use my more powerful spells, and cast a weaker one, or maybe Tishan's Clash to stun them for a little while. I usually cast at least once with a black, but hardly ever against a blue or green...unless our tanks are taking too many hits. During these fights I am always medding.<br><br>Now, these scenerios are all assuming that we are fighting one monster at a time. It gets a little tricky when fighting a mob. I only use DD attacks. I have not used AoE's since about level 8. I have just never had any use for them. They dont do as much damage to each creature as a DD, and it almost always results in pulling a mob onto myself. I have found that I can be most effective to use my most powerful spells and hit one at a time (only the ones that our tanks are fighting, and after losing 15- 20% of its health) to kill the monsters quickly, using all my mana if need be. I also may root 1 or 2 so the tanks can concentrate on one at a time. If I am sow'd and we have got way too many on us, I have been known to nuke a couple of them to draw them on to me, then run them around until our tanks have finished killing the others, then bring the monsters back or just run them to zone.<br><br>Someone posted on here saying not&nbsp;&nbsp;to fight melee. I have even heard some people say not to carry a weapon at all past a certain level. I disagree with that wholeheartedly. Now I'm not suggesting that you try to fight melee all the time like a warrior, expecting to do a lot of damage. But like it or not, melee fighting is the only way to build up your defense skills, like dodge. What I do is this....I said before that usually fighting a blue or green, I sit and med through it. Well, If I am full mana, I will get in and swing the staff around. I am certainly not expecting to do a lot of damage to the thing I am fighting. I do it mainly to pass the time (since my mana is full). But it also doesnt hurt to have your offense skills go up either. Right now my 2H Blunt skill is average. My offense is good, and my defense is very good (I am currently level 24 and carry a fine steel staff) and I fight melee better than most other casters I've ever been grouped with.<br><br> And even though these skills still may not be very important to a group, they have been extremely valuable in soloing. I cant tell you how many times I have had very close calls in a fight because I ran out of mana and had to finish the fight off with my staff. Then going back and looking at all the dodges I had done, or the misses from the monster. Also, when fighting those pesky greens that attack me even though I get no exp, I almost always fight melee through the majority of it when I can. That keeps me from wasting precious mana.<br><br>The wizard's battle skills lies in magic casting. And that should be the way you fight for the most part. But I think it's important to have some half-way decent melee skills and a good weapon for those times when you are out of mana or just want to conserve.<br><br>This is just my opinion, but it has worked for me very well. I suppose if you asked 10 different wizards what the best way to play the character is, you'd get 10 different answers.The good thing about Everquest is there is no one way you have to play your character, I dont care what it is. Just experiment and find out what works best for you. If your group doesnt like the way you are playing, drop out and find another group until you do. Now, I guess if you are constantly getting kicked out of groups because of the way you play, you might want to consider a new strategy. But the important thing is to have fun, and have fun playing it your way.<br><br>Vanderboz<br>24'th level wizzy<br>The Rathe<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>This is an excellent area to fight in groups up to level 24, or to solo if you can get any of the single spawns to yourself. Aviak guards don't have any faction, and will never aggro on you while medding. They can be tricky to solo, though. My strategy was the old stand-by root-and-nuke. Keep Sheildskin up, or Leatherskin if you have it, and stand your ground if root breaks. By the way, if you have Enstil, don't use it. Enstil lasts longer than root, but breaks easier, so stick to root on critters you are fighting. Use Enstil to park a mob and leave alone. If you can re-root, just back off and start nuking again. For those trouble birds who just won't stay rooted, if you get below half health, cast shadow-step - it is very hard to interupt, and you can nearly always get it off. You will wind up on the bottom of the lake more than likely, where you will have all the time in the world (in most cases) to gate to safety. You might lose your spot, but it is better than dying and losing it anyway.<br>&nbsp;<br>Daeanor Endarion<br>Sorceror of the Rathe</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Another thing to keep in mind is that while it is important to combat to build various skills, there are some excellent quests at lower levels that can be done repeatedly and really move the exp along.&nbsp;&nbsp;Either in CB or EC/WC, the belts quests are awesome from level 5 till like 12 or 14.  Again, after that, I agree that Oasis is ideal, or Dirv groups in N ro or WC.  The belts and lego pads in CB are espcially good, though if you are in Erude, it is quite a walk.  If you can find a TP to GFay and get a bind at orc lift (fairly easy to get the bind--takes some doing to get a TP out of Erude/Tox if you are lower level--take the boat to Queynos and shout). The one thing NOT to do as a level 1-10 wiz in Erude (IMHO) is to stay anywhere around Erude. Toxx newbie zone sucks and a little wandering there brings on elementals which will strike you dead. Quenyos and the Karana's areas are a little better, but all-in-all, I'd move to Gfay or EC/WC as soon as possible.  There are more contacts around FP, and there is always pleanty of action in and around CB.<br><br><br>Kelvyn, 30th Wiz, Veeshan <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>*Whispers*&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is my secret.  I am Torshen, an erudite wizard, and found an excellent solo ledge in blackburrow that easily took me from twelth to sixteenth level. It also can provide experience far past these levels, but loses some of its charm after sixteenth. (this may not apply to you just yet, but if you find yourself in blackburrow, watch for the ledge I am talking about.  Then you can begin to judge when you are ready to solo there.)  Just as you enter blackburrow there is a tree to your left.  It is a well known fact that this tree is a pit trap, dropping you into a pool deep in blackburrow. If you are lower level the three patrolling gnolls around the pool will have your hide, but around tenth to eleventh (?) they will begin to ignore you.  Looking around you will see a bridge and small waterfall.  Head toward the waterfall, staying on the ledge to your left.  As you move along the ledge look to your right.  Standing above you, across the stream, will be an elite gnoll guard, gnoll shaman, or gnoll commander.  Probably conning white, yellow or red.  At this point you need to know how the other monsters in blackburrow will react to you.  If gnolls still attack you, this fight is not for you, but if regular gnolls leave you alone you are ready to attempt this kill.  Use Root on the gnoll, then begin using your DD spells to take him down.  BOLT SPELLS WILL NOT WORK! They will almost always hit the wall ledge instead of the gnoll.  The secret to this strategy is knowing how the creature will react.  Apparently, this gnoll is scared of water and will not simply jump the gap to kill you.  He will run in a huge loop just to get you.  DD spells will still be able to hit him, giving you three to four free shots before he closes with you.  By now he is so weak that only a little more damage is needed to make him run (if he hasn't already!) then another spell or two to drop him.  Remember you will be fighting a yellow or red con, so the exp will be excellent, and the loot is good too.  Sound too good to be true?  It might be, if you aren't careful.  There is a gnoll watcher waiting beyond the door, where you cannot see him.  When the gnoll you are fighting moves, he will run close enough to the door to alert the watcher, who will also come for you.  He too has a long way to run, so you are okay if you are fast.  So long as your target stays rooted you have nothing to worry about, but once he runs the clock is ticking.  My response to this was to bind myself just outside blackburrow.  After my main target was killed a quick gate would bring me to safety where i could med and recover.  The other benefit to being bound just outside blackburrow is that, if you do die, you can quickly mem your most powerful attack spell, and charge back into the fight. As I gained levels I found I could take the main target and the watcher.  It may take a few attempts to get your timing down, and learn to budget your mana.  For this to work you probably want to have two dd spells memorized, your most powerful and a lesser low mana version.  You will also want to memorize gate, root, and don't forget those all important shield spells! There is one more hazard I will mention while I am thinking about it.  Straight across from the gnoll, where you will be standing is a corner in the wall, with a small upward slope.  There is a hole in the world in that spot, and your corpse will fall through if you die there.  Then you must summon a GM to rescue it.  Just remember to take a step away from the wall while fighting and you will be fine.  <br><br>The important thing to remember, and this always applies, is that you are a wizard, intelligence and strategy are your best tools.  Learn your enemies, watch how they react to you, where they run, and who they bring.  Learning a monsters response to you is more powerful than any spell you can ever learn!<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Once you start off, you get two spells and a puny weapon.&nbsp;&nbsp;Memorize those spells and click on them once they are in your spell book.  Then a little gem appears with your mouse pointer.  Move it across to one of the empty gem slots on the side and click.  Note: This is the only way to cast spells.  If you have any online friends, ask them to lend you some money to purchase the rest of your spells.  If not, it's just a simple matter of selling the loot from the corpses of the things you kill.  Cast the Minor Shield spell.  Don't worry the spells outlined in yellow can only be cast on yourself so you don't waste mana on others.  (No I'm not a bastard, but later on you'll find out how much you'll come to appreciate your mana and not waste it.) Now, begin to battle the low-level monsters outside of your city.   Make sure to stay in an area where you can run to the guards if you get in trouble.  Cast the spell from a bit of a distance from your target, then press the auto attack button.  Which is default set to (A).  You really want to change this because when you talk to people you could have accidents.  Especially with guard NPCs, all of which at this point would be able to kill you effortlessly.  I recommend changing it to (0) on the number pad on the right of your keyboard.  Try to keep casting the spell while the battle's going.  If you win, loot the corpse.  Then rest.  Sit down when resting to gather more mana and regenerate your hit points faster.  If you get in trouble, run back to the guards, and always rest by the guards.  This is a basis for your low levels, from 1-5 or so.  During that time, you will get a skill called meditate.  It will be your best friend.  When you sit down to gain mana, go into your spell book and click on the now touchable, meditate button.  This will enable you to gather mana much faster.  Also, practice as many of your skills as you can, while you level, it's very important to keep up with them so that you don't lose tracks.  Save the bonus five points that you get to train with from your guild master, and level up to five on skills like tailoring, alcohol brewing, and what not, just so that it makes it easier when you really carry them out (which levels them most of the time.)  Once you get to 5, you should go to into the wilds and start killing things there.  And don't forget to keep buying your spells.  For a while you get new spells at every four levels or so.    After you start to get weakened from killing things, go meditate near the guards, and try to avoid meditating in the middle of a monster filled zone when you're at such a low level.  As you level up more, you will start to venture father out from you're home city.  That's a good thing so that you can find new challenges, and level up easier.  Try to find new weapons too.  Put some points into the one-hand blunt weapons skill, and begin to work with that.  One hand blunt is in general, the best weapon skill for wizards.  This way, you can hold a magical item in the other hand.  When you get money, and you have to choose between a new spell and equipment, go for the spell.  It can do you a world of good.<br>Keep selling useless things you pick up off of corpses.  It gives more room, and you lose carrying weight.  Next, I recommend checking out Allakazam's Quest Database.  It's an awesome resource and very precise.  Check the quests that are in your area, and see if there's anything that it looks like you can handle.  Once you get to 12.  Get your bind spell and head to Erud's Crossing.  (Make sure you have a magical weapon, or else you can't hit the wisps!)  Erud's crossing features an island in between the continents of Odus and Antonica.  The boats that ferry in between the two continents will take you there.  Don't worry about swimming to the island. The boat docks there.  There you will find an island full of friendly cat like people.  You can purchase water and food at one of the shops.  But whatever you do, DO NOT KILL THE KERRA BEETLES!!!<br>There are two bad things that happen if you do.  One, the cat people get pissed and attack you, and two, an aggravated Fire Elemental spawns.  Do not encounter him yet!  For now, you're best off with the Kerra snakes, and on occasion, spiders.  The bad thing with the spiders is that they attack in-groups.  I wouldn't recommend soloing a wisp till you get to 14.  And make sure that there aren't others near.  They like to help.  Ahhhh!  This is long!  Well, that's how to get to 16.  I'll submit another one of these for leveling from there.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The secret to leveling a wizard is finding a good spot to solo. You might think you spend most of your time medding, but the xp goes much faster solo all the same, and medding is faster than healing any time. Kill low blues and high greens. Find a spot where you can med safely between fights, and can find as stuff to attack as fast as you med up. I would suggest gnolls in the Blackburrow area at your level (I think, it's been so long, you still can get xp there). Low to mid teens, Wisps (careful to only get one, they are very bad in multiples). Lavastorm after a bit higher, and Lake Rathe high teens to low 20's. Root and nuke, and as little melee as you can get away with. Once you are in your 20's, all your fights should be with magic.<br>&nbsp;<br>Daeanor Endarion<br>Sorceror of the Rathe</td></tr>

Especially if you can find an second Wizard and an enchanter to mez thoes mobs and give breeze once you get up there a little. Wizards take a lot of strategy and gambling in the lower levels, no doubt about it. One excellent place to camp a bit later on (like 20 or so) is the Eye Room in Beholder. Those polished Bone Bracelets sure are nice when you are 20th, and the same group above can easily hold the spawn. Add a couple of tanks and you can pull the minos at the room entrance. You can stay there getting good xp until 24th or so, at which point I recommend heading to the Lake of Ill Omen for awhile killing sarnaks and gobbos, then moving on to Dalnirs.<br>&nbsp;<br>Adesius Skyefyre<br>30th Level Wizard<br>Brell</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;     Wizards are quite fun. You start out slow, but pick it up after 30 or so. We are exceptional kiters after we Bonds of Force(if you dont believe me, try it) Actually, many Wizards I know have got up through the 50s by just soloing from 34 or so onward. Only problem is you need SoW to kite well, or the Journyman boots. Ive found some good places to kite in Kunark. Namely the Mountain Giant fort in The Frontier Mountains and The Overthere. Those are good from the low 30s on up till the low 40s. Many Wizards I have talked to like to kite spectres as well, although I never really took a liking to it. Hill Giants on the other hand are more my speed...although I wouldnt suggest trying a Hill Giant until at least 39. 1 thing to remember when kiting is to always watch out for people, as it is very rude behavior to kite a mob into a group. Hill Giants or Sand giants will do good in the 40s, as well as some of the higher mobs in The Overthere. Dreadlands also present a whole slough of possible targets, a favorite for many is right outside Karnors. Be careful if you must zone though, as a constant trainbringer is very frowned upon. Sea Fury Cyclops in the Ocean of Tears is a good idea in the high 40s(48+) and after you get Conflageration and Ice Comet at 44 and 49, respectively, it makes your job much easier. I havent had much exp kiting after 51:) Namely because I havent made it their yet, but Im sure I will find something to kill. I hope I helped someone out with this...some Wizard out their thats stuck grouping somewhere and wants a change of pace, any questions look me up on Povar or email me.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Wizard's are of course the master nukers.&nbsp;&nbsp;But that does not mean that they are better than any of the other caster classes.  Each have their own specialties.  But when it comes to doing mass amounts of damage in a short time.  Wizard's are the masters!<br><br>The best way to battle using a wizard is in a group.  You can of course battle alone, but at lower levels it's really annoying when you're trying to cast spells.  <br>"You begin casting."<br>"You are hit for 26 points of damage."<br>"Your casting is interrupted."<br>It goes on like that.  Anyways, it is true that Wizards are of the most use in higher levels, but that doesn't mean that you have to be bored in the lower levels.<br><br>Now,  find a group, (try to find a balanced one with at least one healer.  It'll make your job a lot easier).  During battle, don't nuke away with every point of mana that you have.  Sit and watch.  I'm not saying don't participate, and steal free exp, but wait for when it looks like you are really needed.  You can stand back, because you don't have to be touching a MOB to cast your spells on them.  When it looks like a MOB is going to run away.  NUKE IT!!!  If you let it go, it's probably going to bring back another huge train to fight your already wearied battle group. Should it ever happen, and your group has been very weakened, that's probably your cue to teleport you, and your group out.  Keep an eye on all your teamates health bars, if one gets too low, lend a hand and use some mana, or alert the group healer.  It's no good to have the party die one by one.  And of course if your party ever does bite off more than it can kill, again it is your cue to teleport out.  Your group can heal and then go back for more later.<br><br>Another important point while battling, is to be very careful with your area effect spells.  They can be useful, but they can also have all the dungeon's MOBs gang beating you.  A wizard is NOT meant to take that kind of punishment.  If you do get a ew enemies chasing around, alert some of your group's tanks.  Have them come and deal with it.  Don't run around in circles with the MOBs chasing you and the tanks chasing them.  Go to your tanks, and have them get them off you, and if you're almost dead, alert the healer, after all, that's what they're there for.  You do your job and let them do theirs.<br><br>One last thing I want to mention is that, if your group is killing lower level enemies, or only a few at a time, why not jump in with your staff.  It's another way to raise that one hand blunt.  Well, that's my opinion, I hope you all find it useful.<br><br>Artannis<br>High Elven<br>Wizard<br>Tunare Server<br>&nbsp;<br>"People will belive any lie either because they want it to be true, or they're arfaid it's true."<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>A lower level kiting technique is the circle of death grouping with a Druid. He sows both members, then he goes out and snares (and swarms) a yellow/red beast, comes back to you (running around you in a circle), you start casting the DD's until the mob turns on you... you then run around (in a circle) as the druid casts DD's until it turns back on the druid which means you cast DD's again, etc... works from L14 druids up<br>Say L12 to L16 wizards as a start, all the way up to 24<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>No real need to group with a druid to kite, just a couple of pp will get a nearby druid to cast sow then you just tag, run and nuke.&nbsp;&nbsp;Best thing to do is not even worry about casting root, since you're going to be hunting reds anyhow, it won't work most of the time.  Just run for about 5-6 seconds then cast your spell.  You don't even have to turn around to cast it, just be sure that you have come to a complete stop before starting to cast.  Best Place for this kind of kiting is South Karana...Large areas of running room.  I soloed from 18 - 24 in this zone alone in about 2 weeks.<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>
