	   <tr><td colspan=2>Okay, I see lots of talk about factions going around on several of the message sections. I'll get to that in a sec.<br><br>Quests. I really don't know any good 'chanter quests for our level. *shrug* If you're an elf, I would suggest playing with other quests. I've made lvl 8 really fast due in part to the CB Belts (read more about faction hits later). An enchanter can solo orcs sucessfully, with some risk. Once you hit around lvl 10 or so, get a druid and a couple of others, talk to the cleric head in Felwithe and learn about the drunkard. Go play with the sisters. Loot is great because they drop bronze and jewels sometimes. Collect each necklace from the sister and get an item that while useless to you sells well. I suggest being a jeweler because of our enchantments. This and the CB belts are good for that, because you get armor that you can sell on the belt quest. As an alternate, if you don't want to take additional faction hits with IB for turning in the belts, sell them by the bag to players. You can get upwards of 10plat a bag, depending on server and drop rates that night.<br><br>For a race, I really suggest Elves. If you want to play an easily travelable dark elf, illusions and alliance make it easy for a DE to move about cities and deal with the citizens. Your spells along thoselines only get better for this too. My personal fave is a High Elf because of the natural cha and int.<br><br>Enchanters can be solo or group. I have much sucess soloing, enough that it outweighs the dangers, like dying. Most nights I can make enough solo xp that dying isn't that big of a deal. If I have a night where it is hard to stay alive, then I find a partner to two. Why solo? some quests are easier solo. Sometimes you want to do it on your own. Soloing can still leave room for RP. You can solo, but take out time to assist those around you with buffs, which you really can't do if you are grouped because those buffs ahve to be reserved for group. Willingness to help those around you goes a long way to getting your name out there (in a good way).<br><br>Now, onto factions. I can't say this enough. Factions are a political game. Political games, while taking much research, are really easy to play. They are simple matter of knowing who your friend's friends are and your enemy's enemies are, and knowing how and when to strike at one without jeapardizing the other. Really, you could play the entire game on hunting npc's and quests that will adjust your factions.<br><br>Yes, fighting in Crush will make you KoS to Indigo Brotherhood. Now, since the guards have a LARGE agro radius, this can make Alliance impossible to use. Well, if it is items you need to buy, befriend a darkie to do buying for you from Neriak. Epic quest. Ok, I've not looked at the Epic, so I don't know at what point we have to go to Neriak. I do know that with most epics you can really forget doing them until you are lvl 20 or so. Yeah, you can do somethings, but from what's i've seen for the druid and mage epics, it really isn't worth it to start until later. Well, by the time you are in your 20's, you can find a darkie group and hunt NPC's that are on the IB's raise list. <br>Kill NPC's for a while and keep testing faction. At some point, you will not be instantly KoS. This is good. This means you can Alliance IB people as needed to make sure you can complete quest. And, of course, by this time, you have a spell that is much better than alliance. <br>And all the while, you are gain xp because these aren't low lvl mobs.<br>As an alternate, you don't have to kill the mob to get the faction. Find a group willing to hunt them, and buff the group and atleast try to cast debuffs on the mobs while they are fighting. You will still get the faction hits. :) Not the xp, but this game isn't ALWAYS about xp. This is good if some of the mobs are too high for you when you try to do the epic.<br>Ok, if you watch your faction hits, you will see that your factions with emerald warriors and merchants go down.<br>No problem. Do what you need to do in Neriak. Now, go fight Aqua goblins. This will raise your Emerald faction and keep guards from killing you. Oh, check your faction first on the guards. You are only moving your faction with IB up by 1 or 2, so you might not be KoS to the guards. If you are, it shouldn't be Scowling, just the lower end of Threatening. But check. My experience has been mostly indiff with my home guards, so you are looking at 2 inbetween indiff and scowling.<br>alrighty then. Now, you can't buy? Well, if you aren't KoS to the merchants, you've got the spells that it doesn't really matter. Still, if you really want to raise that faction, go free slaves in crush. Warning, you will lower your faction again, so if you don't need the faction because of spells, leave it be. <br><br>*sigh* No, I haven't experienced this. I did my homework on the factions. Is it complicated? Yes. Okay, factions aren't there just to drive us nuts. Factions are also there for us to play with an manipulate. Yes it is complicated. It will probably be the most complex game you play on EQ next to doing the Druid epic (ugh, can they make it any worse? no, don't answer that). <br><br>Now, one last note. The suggestions of CB are primarily for high elven enchanters. I probably should have specified more clearly. <br><br>Oh, and for the last time YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY ALL YOUR ENCHANTMENT SPELLS IN NERIAK!! Okay, the Enchanter guild is in Felwith. There is a woman in one of hte rooms that sells enchantment spells. There is a guy in Highpass on the first floor who sells your pets. There are ench guilds in Freeport and in Qeynos, and in Erudin (though why you'd want to go there if you were erudite...*wink*) There are tons of spells like invis, gate, etc that we share with other classes. <br><br>Okay, so you don't ever HAVE to go to Neriak until you are of a level high enough to be able to either ignore the faction limits or fix the factions. <br><br>And come on. High Elves are already KoS in Neriak. Hello, we are the Traitors!<br><br>Okay, so have fun. Hey, if anyone has played the political faction game, or can try it, please post and let us know how it works. I will eventually be doing it with my enchanter and my necro.<br><br>Peace and fun gaming.<br><br>Oh, and before anyone asks, yes I have played political games before. Can you say Vampire? <br><br>I thought so.<br><br>Peace<br><br>Madalyn...<br><br>aka<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>"In waking a tiger, use a very long stick." -Mao Tse-Tung.

After searching the large database of quests that are here for enchanters, i found that there aren't really any low leveled ones.  It kinda makes me wanna level more, but in truth, EverQuest is more about quests if you think about it.  The fact that you are there just to level would make the game dull.  But since the quests are there, it adds a certain zing and makes the game more fun.  So I ask all you peeps out there.  What is a good low level enchanter quest for me to complete.  Either reply like i have seen up there, or send a tell to Veilo.  Thanks.<br>&nbsp;<br>Enchanter Extraorinare</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hi all. One solid quest you could do after about tenth level is the greater lightstone/research book quest. A nice little quest with good cash reward and not too much travel. Kill willowisps (Erud's Crossing is a fantastic place for this, plus it's good experience to boot) until you got a backpack or so filled with greater lightstones. Take them to the gypsies in North Karana. Get the book, you'll need one anyway. Sell all but one back for about 9 plat each. It's good cash considering the relatively low level.<br><br>Just one possibility...<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Tenser - Mighty Enchanter<br>Hasan - The Erudite Paladin</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Yes, the stein quest is most excellent.&nbsp;&nbsp;The +10INT makes it a high demand low/mid level caster item.  I've done this quest probably almost 10 times now.  I've sold several to PCs for 150-175pp.  (I recognize that with your quest emphasized playing style the ability to profit from quests may not mean much to you, but it's a nice way to fund your jeweling skill).  I've also given one to my newbie necro as well as helped out a few friends with one of these.<br><br>Personally, I'm really anticipating getting up to mid 20s to 30, as there is a whole list of Enchanter quests at that time that give some REALLY nice items.  (i.e. All the incandescent items as well as the Rod of Insidious Glamour).  As far as I can see, these look like some very entertaining quests that are well worth doing.  Now I've just gotta plug through some levels to get to where I can actually do them.<br><br>Anyhow, that's my take on the situation.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Enchanters are great at soloing, mainly because of there mind control spells, just cast fear while your monster is gettin his a#$ whooped and fire away at the sametime while your monster is slashing your opponent in the back. The only problem is when soloing with your enchanter you end up depending on your pet too much, which is good and bad thing. Your monster is distacting the opponent while u cast enfeeblement, and Choatic Feedback(which does 45 Dmg easy), the bad thing is first thing your monster is dead, u will end up as well if you are not able to cast while the monster is not allowing u to cast a spell to create another monster to help protect you, your only real hope is charm and fear while soloing without a tank.<br><br>P.S: I am lvl 14 and i didn't group once, so in other words... Enchanters are the only spell castor class without needing of tank.(also try playing the magician, there pets are of great use and alot like an enchanter but more of a nuker and solo almost a well.)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I hate to burst your bubble friend, and don't think of this as a flame post, but Enchanters are one of the poorest solo classes in the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;Albeit up to 14 you shouldn't have too much trouble soloing a Chanter (or any other class), but I believe as you level more you'll find that it gets harder and harder.  Enchanters get excellent spells (mind control spells you call them) but the bulk of their spells are best used in group situations (mezzes, haste, debuffs, breeze).  You talk about 'fear kiting' ("cast fear while your monster is gettin his a#$ whooped and fire away") and yes this is not a bad strategy, but Chanters will never be able to fear kite like a Necro can.  Necros get the 'darkness' line of spells which decrease the MOBs speed running away from you, plus multiple DoTs which will be wearing the MOB down as he flees, plus beefier pets that deal more damage and take more hits.<br><br>Their pet is severely limited especially when you compare them to Necro or Mage pets.  You cannot command your pet like the others, plus the animations you make are generally weaker than other casters' pets.<br><br>You say:  "Enchanters are the only spell castor class without needing of tank."<br><br>I think you'll find that common opinion is that the best or at least second best solo class in the game is the Necro.  Mages, as well, will far outsolo an Enchanter.  Their pets are better, as well as their nukes.<br><br>Again, I don't mean this as a flame, but be a little more careful about what you post on these boards.  You don't want to lead other people astray and give them bad information about our uber cool game, do you?

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Glass, I dont see you having any real high level chars... a level 13 enchanter can easily solo 3 reds with a sow, Ive done it. all it takes is some mana and good cha. if you get your hands on some jboots or sow potions, enchanters become a very lethal solo class. bards use the same tactic, charm kiting. at later levels, enchanters usually cant take on a single enemy alone, but rather many at a time. a single, the enchanter will run out of mana before he or she can kill it, making use of charms and mesmerizing spells, the enchanter can easily take down 3-6. I encourage all enchanters to take time and test out all your soloing capabilities, there are times where you cant find a group (although that's rare) its nice to know you can solo if you arent in the mood for grouping. if you only explore the grouping possibilities, you will only see a fraction of the class' greatness. although I know Ill prolly get flamed for this next sentence, Im going to say it anyways in hopes of helping someone out. I think enchanters are the best solo class, only thing I can think of that would top them would be a bard&nbsp;&nbsp; maybe. Ive played a necro to 40, its not great soloing. but with an enchanter I can get about half a yellow buble of exp at lvl 41 from one battle, and around 41 is when I stopped trying to keep track. its easy to fail as an enchanter, its very challenging to be a great enchanter, but remember that the people who say charms suck are usually the ones that sit down to med while having a frost giant standing right next to them. ts not imposible to be a great soloing enchanter, just experiment.<br><br><br><br><br>     -Enchant<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

It is the tents on the other side of the hill that most groups congregate around, so i stay away from there.<br>Don't worry about multi-mobs near the tents. Mez the one you don't want, and pull the one you do (just don't pull across your mezzed mob). I usually pull with either suffocate or enfeeble. Really, you should pull with enfeeble.<br>Let the mob get one hit on you, hten back out. Juli will tank. Hit with Tashan. This momentarily stuns the mob and i think it also lowers ac or something. It generally makes the fight go better. Cast suffocating fear for the DD effect and watch while your pet kills it. If the mob is tough, you will want to melee with your pet, otherwise, your pet will bite it, and you will be in a world of hurt. If your pet does die, recast it as quickly as you can. forget dding the mob, get your animation.<br>When I was lvl 4, Juli would sometimes con even or yellow. I was able to pull yellow mobs then. By now, those yellows should be blue to you. So is Juli. :) <br>Another orc tactic is fear-kiting. I wouldn't suggest this on the hill. Too many people means someone might KS (even if only accidentally). You can either fear kite down the trail towards crush or inside crush itself. If you go in crush, fight by the first bridge (to your left after you leave entrance tunnel.<br>I would replace Tashan with fear.<br>Now, summon juli and buff the two of you. med. Now, head in. Be careful medding for trains. There are some clever spots to go med (see crushbone tactics). You will have a better time if you buff yourself before going in, then just buff your pet once you summon it inside.<br>Do not pull with fear. It will do you little good to fear something your animation won't attack. :)<br>If there are orcs within social prox, then mez them, and pull your desired target with Enfeeble.<br>Let him come to you. Turn so that he will not run back to where other orcs are. Once he tries to hit you, Juli will join in. <br>Now, cast Fear. Mob will run, and Juli will reverse-kite after him. Cast your DD on him. Re-fear as needed, and watch him die.<br>Med against the wall as far from mobs as you can.<br>Repeat.<br>Collect belts too. You can turn them in at Kaladim for great xp. To Canloe in hte warrior's guild. You will get armor that you can't wear. Sell it. You make good money off of it. I would suggest that you go into jewel crafting, so you want all the money you can get.<br>If you group, try to form the group so you are leading. In a group of 2, you should pull. you will need Juli. More than 2, let someone else pull. Juli can watch your back. Make sure your group knows that you will mez unwanted pulls. Have everyone use the /assist command to fight what the puller fights. You mez the others, then cast your DD. save mana to mez again until you've cleaned out all mobs. <br>If your group is large enough, don't be afraid to med after casting mez and your DD on the mob people are fighting. They need you to be at full mana. Just tell them, and tell them that you will re-mez waking mobs. You will get a message. Have your cursor on the sit/stand button, or set it as a hot key.<br>You can get excellent xp for soloing, but in a group, xp starts to dry up on the hill. If you group, you should go into crushbone. better orcs, better xp. In a group, you can take down red cents, but don't try the lego's. they will only shrug off your spells at this lvl.<br> <br>Madalyn<br>aka<br><br>&nbsp;<br>"In waking a tiger, use a very long stick." -Mao Tse-Tung.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Howdy folks. <br><br>Thanks for the advice, I took it to heart, and it's all been very helpful for this career meleer.<br><br>Just made 12th level, got all the new spells, but now I'm a bit mystified. I don't want to go into the depths of Blackburrow, although I suspect that would be good practice with stun/mez type things, but so far my luck has been poor mezzing while trying to tell others not to attack more than one thing at a time.<br><br>So, other than teaming up with a few others in the West Karana, I've not gotten far. My question is, where's a good place to hunt from 12 to, say, 17 or 18? I know after that I can go to Unrest or Highpass or LOIO among others, but where are some good places to go between 12 and 17 for an enchanter?<br><br>Thanks again.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Tenser - Mighty Enchanter<br>Hasan - The Erudite Paladin</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ah-wah! We are great solo'ers, even low level. I solo my 'chanter all the time, and I'm only lvl 8. Infact, I've been solo'ing orc hill since about lvl 4. (and stop hitting me with the "why blue orc" question *wink* gah!)<br>Solo capabilities probably depend on zones, of course. <br>I can't really say best places for 'chanter's to hunt at your lvl. I know where my druid did best hunting, if you want to try them...<br>1. Unrest. It is best to find people you like to group with and get them to go.<br>2. Lavastorm. You can loot bloodstones most of the time from lava crawlers. Take a mage or druid with you and the two of you can own this zone. Be careful if you are pvp<br>3. Sister's Camp in Lesser Faydark. Good quest. Good loot. Great xp. You might can solo this. If not, find a druid to work the camp with you.<br><br>Okay, my tip for grouping. Form your group if you can, or otherwise show your prowess so that the group leader will hand command to you. Or, just make the following as "suggestions"<br><br>1. the group has 1 puller<br>2. everyone makes a /assist hotkey<br>3. puller makes and incoming %t hotkey<br>4. you make a mezzing additional mob hotkey<br>5. puller doesn't go until buffs are done, and casters are atleast at 70m<br>6. when puller goes out, everyone targets puller.<br>7. when puller says incoming %t, everyone hits assist key so that they are targeting puller's mob<br><br>Now, everyone is attacking same mob. Including you at first. If there are additionals, take yourself off auto-attack and mezz the additionals, using your hotkey. If the add has a different tag, give the mezzed tag.<br>now, go back to assisting puller with mob. and remezz adds as needed.<br><br>If you have trouble getting them to go along, just say "ok, we will do it YOUR way" and when they keep attacking the mezzed mobs because no one is using /assist, then just step back and let them die. You aren't a healer anyway. when they gripe at you for letting them die, inform them that you aren't a healer, so you can't heal them. That you aren't a tank, so you can't pull mobs off, and you aren't at evac level. And someone needed to stay alive to let everyone know when it was safe to rezone and to pull corpses to safe location. and besides, if they would stop hitting mezzed mobs, they wouldn't die. At this point, you should be able to represent your plan with better results.<br><br>If this fails, dump them and find a partner. Together you can work on tactics, then add people in and work them into your tactics.<br><br>Peace<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I said it before, I love my enchanter. Tricky, but fun to play. Once I figured out pet commands don't work on my ani, I was in a much better place. :) (I get vengence on this by charming animals with my druid)<br>Okay, so I've reached Lvl 6. Yes, yes, I am now THE woman on campus. ;) Since there are numerous posts about starting new enchanters, I thought I would do Newbie talk while the newbie experience is still fresh.<br>I am playing a High Elf Enchanter, so my main suggestions are there, but I will try to mention mobs in other areas that I know are similar lvl<br><br>Levels 1-2 <br>Fight Bats, Wasps, and the occassional Skele. You will be running like a baby to the guards or dying alot in lvl 1. Get used to it. It will get better. As soon as you get some money, go buy your first animation, and let him tank while you cast. This will cut down your dying.<br>Collect Bat wings. Do not sell them to merchants. You can do one of two things: sell stacks of 20 to other players for 2-5pp or turn them in 4 at a time to Niola Impholder in Felwith. She gives a spell you can't use, so turn around and sell it. She does give you xp and faction. If you are going nuts on the bats, I would suggest doing both things. Otherwise, it just depends on which you want to do more, get $ or get xp/faction. At the time, I was more concerned with faction and lvling past 1 and 2.<br>You should be able to kill a skele with a staff. Switch out your dagger for it. Better weapon.<br>2-4<br>Around here, you should start taking on orc pawns, pixie tricksters, and spiderlings. Don't sell your spiderling silk. Take it to the shop next to the floating guilds in Felwith. There is a loom there. Practice tailoring with the spiderling silks. You can make a little more money this way than you would just selling the silk itself<br>You should also be perfecting your soloing skills with your animation. Yes, he is weak, but he will save your life. When he dies, resummon him ASAP. If you get too low on health, run. He can be resummoned.<br>4-5<br>Once you hit lvl 4, forget all about the zone trash.<br>Go buy your next animation (Juli, I think). Also, buy your next set of spells. Tashan is your friend. So is suffocating sphere and mezz.<br>Also, buy yourself a couple of extra stacks of tiny daggers if you can afford them. You will understand why in a moment.<br>At level 4, I want to introduce you to orc hill.<br>I don't suggest grouping right away. For reasons listed, you want to be very discriminating. Besides, it really isn't necessary. <br>Before going, you should set up 2 hotkeys. "TRAIN to Guards, includ's %T" and "TRAIN to Zone, includ's %T". This is really a consideration matter. You will be doing one of two things alot here. Either running and creating trains or dying. Don't let that deter you. The xp you will get soloing here makes it well worth the running, zoning, and dying. And it will prepare you for soon-to-come dungeons where that is the norm. <br>Orc Hill is frequently camped, but there is generally still plenty of orc centurions spawning that a soloist can pull. <br>Con your pet. If he is yellow to you (which I got alot my first night out on orc hill) then you can take yellow con centurions. Otherwise, stick to black/white cons.<br>Mem your buffs.<br>Buff you and your pet and med up. While medding, mem the following: Your Strengh buff, Haze, Mez, Suffocating Sphere, Enfeeblement, Tashan. Then cautiously head out to the Hill. I circle the hill to see who and what is fighting, then select my pull.<br>Stay close enough to grouped fighters that you can /y. Be ready to respond to /y.<br>You will probably fight one cent, then med. Generally a pawn joins in. There is occassionally 2 cents. Try to mez the second and assist your pet with your hurt spells. Recast pet if necessary.<br>Once out of mana, pick a tree and med at the top of orc hill. Groups are close by if you get in trouble. Make sure you have an animation guarding you. I can usually med most of the way undisturbed, relatively. I rarely get into too much trouble, and can count on groups to help me. Other casters med there, so people understand.<br>Be ready to help when someone calls for help. Cast your specialties. Mez the extra mobs and buff the target. then confuse the mob and inflict damage. You will notice that my tactic means you will not likely get the xp unless the one you are helping is too weak to fight. You don't need xp from assists. What you need is to show others exactly what an enchanter can do.<br>Only group with someone who knows or has a good idea, or is willing to learn what an enchanter can do. Really, you only need one person. Preferably a healing class. <br>If you want your ani fighting right off, then pull. The ani will fight whatever attacks you or it. Otherwise, let animation hang out. If something comes up and agro's you, your ani is watching your back.<br>With two people, swarms of 3 orcs are no problem. Just mez the ones you want to wait on. then you can just tell people watching that you are fine and that you will call if you need help.<br>Collect Centurion belts. As many as you can. Put them in the bank using the one in Kelethin (no zoning). And remember those extra tiny daggers? refresh as you need to in Kelethin. You will need to alot.<br>I was a little ways into lvl 4 when I discovered I could, with risk and patience, solo orc hill. It was fun. I got through lvl 4 and into lvl 5 here.<br>Lvl 5<br>Once you have a bag or so of belts, head to Kaladim. You can cross through BB fairly safely. Be careful a night because of Goblin shamans.<br>Being only slightly into lvl 5, I took 9 belts to Kaladim and turned them in to Canloe. I got about 4 bubbles of gold xp. almost my lvl! I hadn't realized just HOW luctrative the xp was.<br>I save a peice of each armor received for a friend and sold the rest. bought cloth pants.<br>Since I was so close to my lvl, I decided to finish my lvl in Butcherblock.<br>Try to get SoW. Offer to pay. You get better results and you AREN'T BEGGING!!<br>Head back towards gfay zone. Pick off goblins, skunks and snakes. These are fairly easy kills. If you want a funny story, while medding, I suddenly noticed several faction changes and xp. Apparently an orc centrion had come upon me,and my animation dispatched it before it could even deal me any damage. Nice ani<br>I tried to get a yellow-conned basklisk using fear-kiting. I got it down to half health, but my ani died. I tried to keep fear kiting it myself, but that was a mistake. I forgot lesson 1. No melee unless it is an emergency. I should have feared and recast ani. Instead, the bask turned back on me and stunned me. I tried yelling for help, and was told to run to guards, who were only a few feet away, just out of reponse radius. Hello, don't you think I would have run if I could. I guess they hadn't fought basks before. Lesson: wait about 2 more lvls. They con high yellow at the least.<br>But, dispite dying, I got lvl 6 here. Woo hoo.<br><br>So that is my newbie experience up to lvl 6. I really like my enchanter. she has been much fun. BTW, put your points into craft. Mine is jewels.<br>Soloing these lvls and these tough mobs is important. If you haven't played an enchanter (I hadn't) then you need to learn what you can do, what you can handle, and what tactics work. For example, solo, if you mez a tough mob, your pet gets a free hit on him. :) It is a change, and you can practice your casting skill for mez. But really, you should back up your ani with damage and confusion spells.<br>Once you know what you can do and work out your best tactics, you can start grouping with other characters and educate them based on your own experience.<br><br>have fun. I hope someone looking to play an enchanter finds this useful.<br><br>My next stop? Eh, BB for a while, going after spiders, cause I want silk armor. After that?

It is VERY effective.  The main problem is that it is so hard to find anyone who know's what to do with an Enchanter at this level. <br>Any ideas on how to quickly educate the less enlightened of Norrath of the power of the enchanter?  Last night (8/12/01) I spent about 30 minutes explaining what rolls each person in the party would take, and what to do when I cast mez...  I really believe that Enchanters need to take over a party as the leader when they join/create one, otherwise they become useless, and the multiple casts of mezz on the same target and shout's at the attacker that want's to be the hero really builds up agro... and death's.<br>So, to make a long story short :-) what are your experiences with newbies, and how do you get them to understand simple things like everyone attack one target, and no AoE spells? <br><br>Thanks all!<br><br>Aeolas<br>Druid of the 24th season <br>Worshipper of Tunare<br><br>Uniamar<br>Enchanter of the 10th season<br>Worshipper of the true knowledge of the mind<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The great wonderous newbie groups!&nbsp;&nbsp;These will usually last you from lv 1-20ish.  Meaning, they don't fully understand what you can do, or how to handle what you do.  Signs of these groups are: the druids still end up nuking away, while the tank is down to a bubble of health, and not getting a heal from the druid.  The warrior uses cheap 'inc' messages(however, some of em are rather funny), and the zone shouts "A Sand Giant has hit you for 96 damage!"<br><br>When I grew up with my main chanter, it was back when no one really knew what enchanters could do(they have come a LONG ways, before hardly any chanters existed in game).  Enchanter's were a second rate class, you heard nothing about them.  Breeze wasn't out yet, so basically it sucked till you got to lv 29(people understood what clarity did, hehe).  Mainly, in area's such as oasis I'd get a group, and they'd pull 2-3 orcs, I'd mez the extras, and they'd break em.  When that happens, you usually recast, if they break again you literally growl at your computer ;P  And tell the group to please get on one target.  <br><br>Yeah, after something like that would happen I'd have to explain to them what mesmerize did.  I was even almost to the point of making a web site to explain it all, I got utterly tired of explaining it to almost every group.  <br><br>Basically, tell them that when the puller gets more than one, attack/assist the one the puller is attacking(explain assist if need be, and hotkeys if you want).  Now, tell them that you'll take care of all the others with mez.  By saying, it freezes the mob in place, and they won't attack or move as long as no DAMAGE comes to them.  Many Enchanter's, including myself, have Mez keys set up, mine atm says "%t has been mezzed, leave em alone!" or "%t has been mezzed, you attack em, you fight em!"  But once a group understands what you can do, it won't be as bad(unless it's a true newbie group).<br><br>As for people breaking mez, they're ALWAYS there.  I usually will mez the extras, if it breaks I'll tell them to get on main target/assist, and remez.  If it breaks again, I sit down and meditate.  If they start yelling for help, I'll stand and mem blur, but I show them no sympathy ;P  and I'll say, you broke mez 2x, have fun.  They learn fast that way.  <br><br>Also, if you are mezzing, be sure to tell the group to not use AE damage spells/songs or weapons.  It becomes an utter pain to have 3 mezzes break because of a bard/wiz/war using an AE.  <br><br>Hope that helps, and understand that you'll be explaining your abilities to a lot of groups.  Just get a rote explanation down, that describes it quick and easy.  And look forward to the upper lvs when you will no longer have to explain yourself(or get into a dungeon or the sarnak fort in ill omen)  People in those areas know that a chanter is a MUST to survive.  Have fun...and don't be too bossy tho, I hate leading groups, I'm just the man who goofs off in the corner while I keep them all alive(yes, me! not the healers, cause I'm the one keeping the healers alive, hehe ;P).<br><br>Ithyl     <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Heya, yep at low levels Enchanters can be very frustrating for exactly that reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cool part is, as soon as a group realizes what Enchanters are capable of, they will worship you and stand in awe.  I've heard it said before, and it's the same with myself.  The very reason I started an Enchanter was due to my first experience grouping with one.<br><br>I mostly agree with your statement about 'taking charge'.  With an uneducated group this is too true.  Enchanters have sort of a bad rap around the game for being bossy.  IMO it's not that we are bossy, but exactly like you say there are so many people out there that just need to understand our roles in a group before we can bring much of anything of value to the group.<br><br>MY THEORY:<br><br>When I first join a group, as long as we are in a relatively 'safe' location, I will give them all the benefit of the doubt and do my job without saying a word.  Frequently, as you can imagine, there is at least one person who doesn't know how to group with a Chanter.  When this is the case, I will groupsay a general message like, 'Please everyone use assist on the puller and attack only one monster at a time.'  If there are no questions, I assume that everyone understands.  Frequently, there are questions in which case I/we educate the whole group on setting up an assist hotkey.  So there is step one.<br><br>If problems persist, I will repeat the general message and follow it with some more specific thing, like:  'I mezzed the second orc and it broke immediately because someone was attacking it.  It will save us ALL mana and HPs to use assist and attack only ONE beast at a time.'  A little firmer but still patient.<br><br>If it happens a third time, I will give the ultimatum.  Basically repeat step two and let them know that if it doesn't change I will have to leave the group, in a non-offensive manner if possible.  At this point, if they haven't learned yet, it usually doesn't work out and there is another occurence (breaking mezz or whatever).  In this case, I do exactly as I said.  I apologize and tell them that I can't group here anymore and I go elsewhere seeking a group.<br><br>The nice thing is, there are a good number of experienced players who are starting an alt and have a high level character.  Also, if you do 'break through' to a group and they realize what you can do for them, you'll find you'll make many longtime friends that will group with you for a long time to come.<br><br>It can be hard to find a good group in this manner, but it's well worth it when you do.  At least I think so.  So good luck with your adventures.  Hope this helps ...<br><br>Zasshatiz/Yizzelar/Gluadilae/&Co.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Now that you're 16, you enter into using research.&nbsp;&nbsp;For us, it isn't nearly as important as wizards, but we can find it useful.  I'll admit, my research sucked at lv 45, around 40 or so, hehe.  ButI always carried around my Tome of Endless Enchantments, just cause I liked the whole RP aspect of it, I always carried my Tome around.  <br><br>As for getting started.  Yes, you need the Tome, then you need the pages.  I believe Tas. pages are first, and the way these ones work(and all the ones that are ripped and not full pages) is that there are two sides to each page, a right and a left.  You need to find both sides. Once you get both sides, you can put them into your Tome and hit combine while crossing your fingers.  If it fails, you're out your components with no spell and have to go looking again.<br><br>I suggest, if you can get the spell elsewhere, do so.  Like levitate, get that at druid or shaman guilds.  Also, for research lists, I suggest going to eq.castersrealm.com , they got great info on researching and other aspects of the class.  Good luck!<br><br>Ithyl<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>If you already have the nuts, the quest is almost over.&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest, going to WC, binding, then just run to Rivervale(or get a FREE port to misty).  Get the honeyjum, then gate.  You'll be back in WC, and you can probably find a port here to Toxx.  Get to tox, get Erud's tonic, and then take the boat to Qeynos.  As you goto Qeynos, and are at the Temple of Nife/clerics guild, camp right outside the water.  Make the mule Shadow knight(for harm touch) and hunt the fishies.  Get the scales, then gate back to WC.  Run to the Bar get the notebook.<br><br>That's as far as you could get on the quest with the aid of your druid anyway.  But, you'll still have to run to qeynos and camp the fish, so really the druid only saves you 5-10pp depending on how much you pay for ports.  Then, just head over to Ogguk.  And don't forget to cast alliance/benev on Clurg...you HAVE to be indiff to get the stein..I made that mistake once.<br><br>Good luck, and with your chanter, it should only take you about 1hour to 1hr 30mins...with sow.<br><br>Ithyl<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>You don't have to be indifferent.&nbsp;&nbsp;My enchanter at 12th got his first stein, with dubious consider.  Religion probably makes a different.  My agnostic koada'dal under illusion with alliance may well get it then where a real tier'dal with alliance might not.  If you can't, then don't sweat it..  there's always Benevolence.  Just go level a while then come back.  The thing you really want from oggok anyway is the Crude Stein. (10 Sta, 15 Cha)  Look for someone killing ogre guards and loot one.  They usually don't mind, since they can only have one themself. (Lore)  The 10 Int on the SoM is nice, but I haven't been using mine at level 24..  I just sell them, and hold my crude stein and Rod of Insidious Glamour (12 Cha).<br><br>If you want to make Moggok runs over and over for money though, I've found the most efficient way to be to Bind in Freeport at the docks.  Ship to Sister Isle for nuts.  Gate.  Run to Rivervale for HoneyJum.  Get a port if possible there, to toxx preferably, or WK, and then hit Erudin for the tonic and Qeynos for the fish, in whichever order you get to them (depending on the port).  Or you get a SoW and run over to Qeynos, then Erudin, for the same.  Use a mule character to get the fish - the regurgatonic process is too slow, and you dont want the faction hit of killing the fish yourself.  Anyway then gate back to Freeport, turn in the items, one at a time, to get the Compendium.  Run down to Oggok for stein. Gate.  Repeat, selling stein in EC or WC on the way to Rivervale.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>For those who are thinking about playing an enchanter, and those who may already have one, here are a few tips.<br><br>1. Always keep these spells in your spell slots, granted you're high enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tash, Mem blur, Mez(your newest mez), and AE Stun(s).  It is those spells that define our class, and those spells will get you out of(or help) almost any situation.  All the other spells you put up are just added for the group situation, like slows(very important, could even put that up in the always up slot too).  Later on in your life, as you get into the mid-late 40s, you'll start taking down your DoTs(Necros are better than ours, and if they cast it ours wont stick) and most likely have already taken down your nukes.  They're just too many other spells that would suit the needs of the group better...like charm.<br><br>2.  Charming.  Awesome ability, but not many know how to use it correctly.  The easiest thing to do here is to tell your charmed pet to guard a certain area /pet guard here.  Then go across the room(or field) and just start meditating.  Press F1 twice, and that will target your charmed pet.  Once charm breaks, stand up and cast mem blur.  If that for some reason fails, wait get hit, stun, then mez.  I say wait to get hit, because if you cast too soon you're most likely going to be hit anyways and break the casting, easier to let them have a round on you before you cast.<br><br>3.  Spell book.  I bought all my spells, I like to have all of them, even the useless ones like Calm and the bind sight spells.  But, be sure to keep the first 9 or so pages full of the spells you use most often.  Over time, you'll be able to flip through the entire 9 pages without even thinking and already know where your spells are.  Know your tome!<br><br>4.  Nukes.  Our nukes just suck.  The only one that's worth anything is Chaotic feedback.  It can be partially resisted, unlike any of our other nukes, and it interrupts castings.  I used to always have a nuke up till about 44, then I cursed at the waste of mana due to constant resists.  You know you can nuke, but there's a better spell to fill its spot.<br><br>5.  Targeting.  A lot of enchanters have a problem targeting "add" mobs.  I agree, this can be hard at times, but there are a few tricks you can use.  First, when more than one mob is pulled, the one who is not being attacked is usually closer to the tank.  You can see this even if their mob graphics are the same.  One will be a little closer and one a litter further back.  Check the blinking title above them to make sure if you need to as well.  Then mez.  Another way is to press /assist, then see which one is being attacked, and mez every other mob that is there.  Or, the easy cheap way, just mez the ones with full hp(hehe).  Be sure to use your highest level mez, this buys you more time and they are less resisted.  However, there are moments that call for you to pull out the lesser spells(ex: lot of mobs and you're low on mana), so keep your mez spells close together in your spell book.   As for AEmez, use it with caution.  I rarely pull this out, but I know where it is in my book and I know what situations it's best used for.  If you do use it, be sure to cast it every 17 seconds or so...I think it only lasts 24 secs.<br><br>6.  Healers.  Take it upon yourself to take care of the healers in the group.  Many of them have hot keys set up stating that they are being attacked, let them use those, but as soon as the healer is hit, cast mem blur.  By now, many of the groups fighters will be on the creature, or the creature will no longer care about the cleric and go jump on the fighters attacking it's friend.  If you use this spell correctly, it's a god spell...it also erases the damage done(that is an exploit if used to steal xp though).<br><br>7. Mem blur vs Root.  Some chanters prefer to have root up instead of mem blur.  It's about .5 quicker casting time, but honestly how many times is root resisted?  And, does it erase aggro?  Nope.  Mem blur is very unresistable, and if it fails, you can cast mez.  Root can be a pain to get it to stick where mem blur is just one quick cast.  You can play around with it, but I think in the end and at higher levels, you'll lean more towards mem blur.<br><br>8.  Animations.  They're ok, no they are not great, but they're better than nothing.  Do not call them "pets" because they aren't pets, I view them as personal damage shields.  They can do decent damage, no where near a necro or mage but it's decent at the cost of crappy hp.  Do I use these guys, rarely.  There had been levels where I went an entire spell level without getting my new animation(tho, I bought it later hehe) and didn't even miss him.  Because, in groups, they're mez breakers.  You can't control with an animation, if you're hit once, your animation goes beserk.  If your hit by 2 mobs, he'll fight one, then may even quickly switch over to the other after you had just mezzed it.  Not fun.  As for solo'n with them, it can be done, but aint that great.  You just mainly make them chase the moon/fear while it beats on them.  Charm works a lot better.<br><br>9. Spells.  Know the duration of your spells, specially your mezzes.  This is something that is very important, and over time you'll get the hang of when you need to reapply mez, and have enough time for a resist to recast if needed.  Also, cast buffs on yourself before casting them on the group, so your's fall first, then you can start recasting on the group.  And when clarity falls in combat on a healer or nuker, sit and put it up right away, if you have time and are not being attacked.  It's important that they get it..specially the healer.<br><br>10.  Hp.  You're hp sucks.  Face it.  We have the lowest hp out of any other class in the game.  You're lucky if you break 900 or so by 50(buffed).  So, be sure to always ask for a hp buff from a cleric, even if it requires a component(you should have one on you), symbol of piz takes a jasper, as does Rune III.  Because, our title comes with it resists, and 2 mobs resisting AE stun is not a fun thing at times...why I usually keep 2 stuns up.  lv 4(quick) and lv 20 or lv 44.  On my new chanter now, I'm having a hard time giving up my hp rings and necklace.  65hp x 3 does add quiet a bit ;P<br><br>11.  Charisma Vs. Int.  This is all your decision.  I prefer to go with Charisma, as CHA does play into mez.  So, if it sticks I've saved mana, where if I had lower CHA and it didn't stick I'd end up wasting that extra mana my int gave me to recast.  However, at higher levels, it's a lot easier to balance the two out so they are both in the 190+'s.  So, here it's up to you.<br><br>12. Grouping with other chanters.  This is utterly horrible.  If you do it, you and the other chanter will be watching each other like a hawk.  Seeing how they play, and then you'll tell yourself they don't know what they're doin, and try to mez things before they do.  Yeah, I know you all have done that before.  We're brutal...and bards...if you haven't grouped with many you'll come to get upset at them every once in a while, they like to charm and mez and it wrecks it for us.  Ah well.  Also, remember mez can't overwrite another mez.  So, a lv 4 mez can't be overwritten with a lv 39(think that's entrance..maybe it's 34 hehe).  Just something you may want to know when goruping with another chanter.  And anyways, most groups dont want 2 chanters, yet if you do get in one work it out with them on what spells you'll be casting.  But be sure to keep those 4 main spells(at topic 1) on your list at all times.<br><br>13. Have fun.  You're most likely the reason why your group lives.  Keep that in mind, but dont think that, hehe.  When I'm in groups, I make them laugh, using my illusions and such to add more to the party.  I've had 4 people make chanter's because they grouped with me and had so much fun and still did a great job.  It's a great feeling when people give you compliments and even better when they let you have the rare loot off the mob you were camping/fighting because they all thought you did a great job.  So, basically, have fun while still working.  Hehe, and at 29 you get air elemental form...I had gotten to the point where if I wasn't floating I had a hard time doin my job, hehe...don't get addicted.<br><br>That about wraps it up.  I'm sure I missed some things out of it, and you may have better ideas, but this is the roll I played and I did extremely well and was very well liked in groups.  As for crafting, I say don't worry about that till you got money.  Save the gems you get, but really, you're not going to be rich enough to craft jewelry and buy your spells, and afford components for your rune series.  But, many people say otherwise, and if you have a finacial source, go for it.<br><br>Anyways, I just put up a huge amount of info and I hope someone takes the time to read it and think on it.  It could improve your style or you could laugh at mine.  And when you die, and you will(4 things beating on you for 100+ is not fun when you got about 800hps) just say to your group "lalala" and wait for the zone.  Then look at your natural hps and cry ;P<br><br>Ithyl<br>-lv 16 Enchanter<br>RETIRED<br>Kair<br>-lv 45 Chanter<br>Serivok<br>-lv 29 Chanter<br>Serivok II(diff server, hehe)<br>-lv 14 Chanter<br>....yeah, don't ask ;P  I love chanters, hehe.   <br><br><br><br>  <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Good advise for the levels concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd have to say that after 51, mem blur (and its upgrades) don't do the job very well.  I always used blur and not root, but once I started doing sebilis at 51 I found mem blurs took way too much mana and really never worked.  Easier imo to either root or chain stun until the tank  gets it off me.  And if the tank can't taunt something off in 15-20 seconds or so of me stunning....well then that's when I get a new tank =p.  Nukes pretty much do always suck, although resists aren't so bad at high levels (if you tash); the long long recast time and poor mana-damage ratio continue to suck though.  DoTs suck until 56.  Torment of Argli is a nice 900 damage spell for 150 mana, and a quick cast time, which means its easy to toss on a mob if you have a little extra mana (doesn't stack with Splurt, so only use if you have no necro.  however it DOES stack with all your other enchanter dots).  Asphixiate at 59 is a nice one too, with 1100 damage or so and the usual debuffs that come with our dots.  With these 2 dots you can actually kill blues (low blues!) with root and dot...just make sure their slow and keep rune III (or 5 if you want to use peridots) up.  Um...yeah, that stuff about grouping with other enchanters....I hate other enchanters.  I usually end up doing all the work and leave them to nuke or something, cause I like to be in control.<br><br>Side note, enchanters often are what makes all the differance.  Even without our mezing capacity, we basically double the efficiancy of the group with clarity/c2, speeding by 60%+ and slowing by 50%+...quicker kills, less mana used by cleric on heals by a long run, and that mana regens faster.  What this normally means is that a group I'm in can kill with absolutely no down time.  My groups in fact often have one of the casters pulling, so that the tanks just stand there and fight while we build up a little line of mobs.  This way, there's no down time while the dumb tanks are running around trying to pull.  They just smack one til its dead, then the smack the next one, and so on.  I don't know how often people comment that exp is really good when I'm around.<br><br>While I'm on the topic....enchanters make great pullers, if you know what you're doing.  I mean in a dungeon, where pulling takes a bit of skill.  So many warriors insist on pulling...I find that annoying, cause to a warrior, "pulling" means finding a room of mobs, shooting one, and running away.  We can do so much better.  For a solo pull, pull it with slow so its ready for melee when it gets back...also saves you from getting pounded in the back so much.  For a pull of 2, shoot one with mez, the other should pull its self.  Once the combat is engaged, run back to the mezed one and tash it; it should break mez just around the time when the first one is dead.  If the group kills too slow, let it run to camp and mez it there.  For splitting large rooms, use AE mez (fascinate only, mesmerization is too short).  With luck you get one resist and there's your pull, if they all get mezed just hit one and pull it quickly.  Then run back, use AE tash (if you have it), and root them all (if you have the time) and single mez them as they pop.  Basically...the point of this is that pulling is just crowd control (which you Should be good at) but backwords.  It just takes a little practice to be good at both.<br><br>Tarnin Austa, 59 Enchanter (7th Hammer server)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
