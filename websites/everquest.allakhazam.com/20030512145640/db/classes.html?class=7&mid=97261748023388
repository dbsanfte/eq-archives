	   <tr><td colspan=2>Greetings all.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a sort of beginner here in the realm Norrath and was wondering if I could get some help.  I bought this game about 4 weeks ago and started as a ranger...that was interesting to make it short.  I'll admit rangers are fun to play and are pretty good soloers but I want a class that I know exactly what my role is.  SO I was hoping I could get some tips for playing a Cleric.  I've decided I'm going to be a Dwarf Cleric even though a halfling sounds like a good choice too.  Anyway any advice would be helpful Thanks for your time<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>First of all, max out your Wisdom with your starting points. I personally favour putting any reamaining points into Strength (but then I like playing Halfling Clerics &lt;now&gt; and they are a little weaker than Dwarves). Your strength should be around 80 to 85 min just so you can wear decent armour and still carry a bit of loot.<br><br>There are plenty of good hunting spots for beginners on Faydwer. Butcher is good and the Chessboard there will be great when you get a little higher. Greater Faydark is also good and hunting those orcs really helps with your faction. BTW keep any bone chips you find. You can turn these into either the Paladin Guild in Kaladim or the Cleric Guild in Felwithe. It's good xp and good faction.<br><br>Just so you know, playing a Dwarven Cleric can get a little rough. In groups, Clerics are often relegated to Healer only (a VERY important role, but can be a little boring for some). Also, Dwarves get a xp penalty (not sure what it is for Dwarven Clerics), whereas Halflings actually get an xp bonus (it's +15% for Halfling Warriors, I think it's about +10% for Halfling Clerics). Just keep this in mind if you're interested in leveling quick.<br><br>Naturally, Clerics are one of the most sought after classes when grouping. I've been in many groups with 4 or 5 members and we are doing perfectly fine. Then a Cleric zones in and advertises they're looking for a group and we grab them, not because we need him (though they are VERY handy) but because we don't want one of the other groups to get an edge on us :P<br>&nbsp;<br>________<br><br>I've travelled this world and have seen many wondrous things. You are not one of them.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I took this from the Old Forums. I've seen more postings on this in other areas and on other boards, but all are essentially the same. My thanks to BLAH who posted this on April 3. I've taken and posted the entire post, but the Halfling basically gets a 0.9 multiplier for xp needed to gain a level (that's a little over a 10% bonus). Warriors get a further multiplier of 0.9 while Rogues get a multiplier of 0.905. I was mistaken that Clerics get a bonus (sorry, senility must be setting in). Therefore Halfling Warriors get a (roughly) 20% bonus (ie. a 0.81 multiplier), Halfling Clerics get a (roughly) 10% bonus (ie. a 0.9 multiplier), and Halfling Rogues get a (roughly) 19% bonus (ie. a 0.8145 multiplier). Note that there are further modifiers for level, but this is the same for all Classes and Races (hence the "Hell" levels).<br><br>Without further ado, here is BLAH's posting (if you want further proof, do your own search :P):<br><br><br>Taken complete leave of your senses? Now you can purchase advertising in this drab frame. <br><br>Everquest Experience - The Definitive Breakdown (Originally posted to the official Everquest message base. Research done by posters to Hackersquest.) <br><br>As Abashi said about exp in a recent post: <br><br>"It's not a matter of time, it's the fact that I've chosen not to answer this question. I'm sorry that the people here disagree with that decision, but there is information that you should find out on your own, and all of the bumps in the world won't change that." <br><br>He finally challenged us to "find out on our own." Well, we did, and here are the results. <br><br>First, some basics. For convenience, I will use the terms 'mob' and 'NPC' interchangeably. There is no difference as far as exp goes. <br><br>1. The exp given by every mob in the game = (mob level) * (mob level) * X. <br><br>There are four major catagories of mobs, 'newbie' (levels 1-4), 'low' (level 5-6), 'outdoor' (level 7+), and 'dungeon' (any level). The category determines the X value, which are as follows: <br><br>Outdoor: 75 Dungeon: 80 Low: 100 Newbie: Varies by zone. Anywhere from 103 to 114 have been recorded. <br><br>Therefore, every mob gives a fixed amount of exp, assuming it is in normal exp ranges (blue to red). Starting in the low-mid levels, mobs that are one level green give 50% of the exp that they should. Once into the mid levels, mobs that are two levels green start giving 25% of the exp they would if they were blue or higher. <br><br>This only covers solo, non-pet combat. We'll get to pets and grouping later. <br><br>2. The exp required to gain a level is determined by a character's race, class, and level range. <br><br>This is fairly obvious, but what we really want to know is what the formulas are and what the values are for each race/class/level range. I'm not going to get into the details of just *how* these figures were derived, but suffice it to say it was a lot of testing, recording, and experimenting, and analyzing of usually hidden data in the game. <br><br>The total exp required to complete level X = X * X * X * C * R * L, or X^3 * C * R * L. <br><br>As Abashi has stated, we see that exp gain is not linear. Once again, no big surprise, but we really want values for these variables (R = race, C = class, L = level range), so here they are: <br><br>R VALUES -------- Barbarian 105 Dark Elf 100 Dwarf 100 Erudite 100 Gnome 100 Half Elf 100 Halfling 95 High Elf 100 Human 100 Ogre 115 Troll 120 Wood Elf 100 <br><br>C VALUES -------- Bard 14 Cleric 10 Druid 10 Enchanter 11 Magician 11 Monk 12 Necromancer 11 Paladin 14 Ranger 14 Rogue 9.05 Shadow Knight 14 Shaman 10 Warrior 9 Wizard 11 <br><br>L VALUES -------- Levels 1-29: 1.0 Levels 30-34: 1.1 Levels 35-39: 1.2 Levels 40-44: 1.3 Levels 45-50: 1.4 <br><br>Here we have the data that everyone wants, the actual exp penalties/bonuses. Assuming the base value for the race multiplier is 100 (a reasonable assumption), we see that Humans get *no* exp bonus. Actually, the only race with an exp bonus are Halflings, with a 5% bonus. <br><br>The numbers for the class multipliers aren't much of a surprise with the exception of the Bard (which is apparently considered a hybrid class), the Monk (who seem to get a penalty for not needing fancy equipment to be a melee class), and the Rogue (who get a bonus because, well, they kind of suck). <br><br>The L values don't really come into play until looking at how exp works for leveling (in particular hell levels), so we'll get into that next. <br><br>3. Hell levels really are a mathematical consequence, more of a "bug" or shoddy programming than a "feature". <br><br>Abashi has stated that as the exp curves change, the game forces characters to make up the difference in the exp they should have gotten on that curve up to that point. To everyone's surprise, he's actually right. It helps to look at some actual exp tables at this point to see the "hell level phenomenon" in action. Unfortunately, I can't make tables in this post so it's kind of hard to show it here, but I will show show excerpts from a table. <br><br>We'll use a Human Warrior in this example. <br><br>Assume he's level 1, starting with 0 exp. <br><br>To complete level 1, he needs a total of 1 * 1 * 1 * 100 * 9 * 1.0 = 900 exp points, a difference of 900. <br><br>To complete level 2, he needs a total of 2 * 2 * 2 * 100 * 9 * 1.0 = 7,200 exp points, a difference of 6,300. <br><br>To complete level 3, he needs a total of 3 * 3 * 3 * 100 * 9 * 1.0 = 24,300 exp points, a difference of 17,100. <br><br>... <br><br>To complete level 27, he needs a total of 27 * 27 * 27 * 100 * 9 * 1.0 = 17,714,700 exp points, a difference of 1,896,300. <br><br>To complete level 28, he needs a total of 28 * 28 * 28 * 100 * 9 * 1.0 = 19,756,800 exp points, a difference of 2,042,100. <br><br>To complete level 29, he needs a total of 29 * 29 * 29 * 100 * 9 * 1.0 = 21,950,100 exp points, a difference of 2,193,300. <br><br>Now, he's level 30, the first hell level. L changes to 1.1, and we see the (not so surprising) results. <br><br>To complete level 30, he needs a total of 30 * 30 * 30 * 100 * 9 * 1.1 = 26,730,000 exp points, a difference of 4,779,900. <br><br>Then, we're back to semi-normal leveling. <br><br>To complete level 31, he needs a total of 31 * 31 * 31 * 100 * 9 * 1.1 = 29,493,090 exp points, a difference of 2,763,090. <br><br>To complete level 32, he needs a total of 32 * 32 * 32 * 100 * 9 * 1.1 = 32,440,320 exp points, a difference of 2,947,230. <br><br>To complete level 33, he needs a total of 33 * 33 * 33 * 100 * 9 * 1.1 = 35,577,630 exp points, a difference of 3,137,310. <br><br>To complete level 34, he needs a total of 34 * 34 * 34 * 100 * 9 * 1.1 = 38,910,960 exp points, a difference of 3,333,330. <br><br>Now we're at hell level 35, the L changes to 1.2, and we see the results again. <br><br>To complete level 35, he needs a total of 35 * 35 * 35 * 100 * 9 * 1.2 = 46,305,000 exp points, a difference of 7,394,040. <br><br>To complete level 36, he needs a total of 36 * 36 * 36 * 100 * 9 * 1.2 = 50,388,480 exp points, a difference of 4,083,480. <br><br>To complete level 37, he needs a total of 37 * 37 * 37 * 100 * 9 * 1.2 = 54,705,240 exp points, a difference of 4,316,760. <br><br>and so on up to 50. <br><br>This tells us a few things, the main one being that progressive hell levels aren't all as bad as they're made out to be. The exp required to get level 31 is roughly 2x what would be expected, but the exp required to get 36 is rougly 2.1x. At 41 it's roughly 2.15x, and at 46 it's only around 2.2x. <br><br>So, while this shows that hell levels really are just a "bug" with the formulas, the progressive severity of the effect is minimal. However, the "hell level phenomenon" could be eliminated if non-linearity were spread out. One way of doing this would be to have exponentially increasing multipliers over the entire 30-50 range. For example, the 30 multiplier would be something like 1.001 (to account for the large range beneath it), 31 might be 1.003, 32 at 1.01, etc, slowly increasing to 1.1 at 35. It would gradually but exponentially rise to the 1.4 level at 45, and ideally (mathematically, it wouldn't make the players very happy), beyond 45, to 50 and beyond. This would keep the 30-45 range basically the same but make the 46-50 range much harder, and by the time players hit 60, things start getting a little ridiculous with the exponential growth at this time. <br><br>But we're getting off the point here, which is how exp works in the current game. <br><br>3. Pets do not take a fixed amount of exp when solo. <br><br>Surprise, surprise! Pet exp penalties do not work *at all* like Verant claims. If a pet class, for example a mage, is fighting blue mobs with a pet and the pet does less than 50% of the combined damage done between the mage and pet, the mage gets 100% of the exp. If the pet outdamages the mage and the mage gets credit for the kill, the mage gets 50% of the exp. <br><br>This works for blue through red mobs, but when dealing with green mobs of any kind, if the pet outdamages the mage, the mage gets no exp. If the mage outdamages the pet, though, he gets the normal green exp, be it 50% or 25%. <br><br>4. There is no group exp bonus. <br><br>This might have already been discussed, but there is no extra exp tacked on to the total exp from a mob by nature of a group getting the kill. The "group bonus" is another way of saying that a good group will be able to fight more creatures with less downtime than if the group members fought solo, thus increasing each member's rate of exp gain. <br><br>5. Group exp is not based on level (within reason). <br><br>The exp gained by each group member, as long as each member is reasonably close in level to each other, is computed by proportionally dividing the exp per kill by the total exp of each group member. There is no accounting for the level of each person when determining the split, unless certain people in the group are far too low level (a level 50 and a level 20 for example). This leads to a few direct conclusions: <br><br>People in hell levels do not take a disproportionate split of a group's exp. Classes will larger innate exp penalties do not take a disproportionate split of a group's exp. People with larger innate exp penalties level slower than their groupmates, even when fighting the same creatures. They gain exp at the same rate and will have the same total exp after fighting the same creatures together, but each one will be at a different level or at least a different percentage into a level with the same amount of exp points. Certain classes need to play more, outside of their normal groups, to keep up with their regular groupmates. A Troll Shadow Knight will need to play *a lot* longer than the Halfling Warrior he normally groups with to remain at the same level over any signifigant amount of time. Someone who is grouped with another who is slightly lowerl level but fighting things that are green to the higher level person and blue to the lower level one is still taking exp from the group. Therefore, the high level person isn't just "helping", he's stealing a lot of exp which isn't going anywhere because the mob is too low level for him to gain anything. 6. Pets take no exp in groups. <br><br>No matter what they do, how many there are, and how much damage they put out, we can not find any cases where pets take *any* exp away from a group. It's possible that there is some way for pets to take exp from groups, but in every sort of normal fighting in Everquest, it simply does not occur. <br><br>7. Exp loss on death is a percentage of a character's total exp. <br><br>This is fairly obvious to anyone who has died in a hell level. A character loses a percentage of their total exp, and the percentage of loss increases either in relation to the total exp as the total increases. This is roughly equivalent in a mathematical sense to a table of percentage of exp loss per level with increasing values, but there is insufficient data collected at this time to determine either the actual implementation or the actual percentages. However, at very low levels the percentage is around 1%, slowly increasing to somewhere around 10% at high levels. <br><br>That's about all I can think of saying about experience at this time that isn't already established knowledge. I cannot take credit for most of the collection or analyzing of the data reported here, and must extend a deep thanks to our friends at HackersQuest, both for their powerful tools used to collect and process this data and for their public forums where the data was compiled and discussed, and many of the conclusions expressed above were drawn. <br><br>Despite Verant's half-hearted attempts to stop the work, the task of uncovering the secrets of EverQuest continues to progress. For some of us, there's more to EverQuest than hitting 50, twinking, and item farming (even though many of us who use these tools, including myself, have done all three). We want to learn the details of the workings of the game, which Verant sees fit as being a bannable offense should they find out. Figuring out the rules behind the game is much more interesting than using the tools put out by HackersQuest to "cheat", but by Verant's definitions, knowing, or even working to figure out the rules, is cheating. Hacking items, looting corpses, duping money, and altering spells is cheating, none of which can be done with the public HackersQuest tools. Knowing the rules of the game is not. <br><br>I hope this post was helpful in answering some long-standing questions about exp penalties, splits, pets, and other issues that should have been addressed a long time ago but are still a source of confusion in game for many of the players. <br><br>(My apologies for this remaining uncredited, but I was unable to find the original thread. The message itself was sent to me via email by Bladedemon.) <br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>________<br><br>I've travelled this world and have seen many wondrous things. You are not one of them.</td></tr>
