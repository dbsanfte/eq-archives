But there is also a limit how long you can sit there &quot;waiting&quot; calling it a camp, when not actively fighting. Doing that too long is as rude as not respecting a camp.<br /><br />Training is also not considered against soe's rules unless you intentionally did it.  A monk leading a train to your camp, well off the path to the zone line and fd'ing for instance. A train from a bad pull and running for the zone isn't against soe's rules.

In regards to the OP, this was not violated. You had not engaged and as you were waiting on a tank, you were not ready. The mage came along and was ready, so he was not in violation of the PNP. As far as Zek transfers, some of them are a problem as they are not used to the full PNP. It largely didnt exist on the Zek servers except for a few items, such as being excessivley crude and so forth. Just give them time.<br /><br /><br />The other set of rules is basic politness. Note that edicate can vary from server to server, but what the mage did to the OP would be considered rude on most servers. If you see folks setting up to take something, generally let them have it. People who repeatidly break camps get bad reps and soon find themselves having difficulty finding a group. If they are guilded it can cause even more issues as most guilds take a dim view of breaking others camps by their members.</p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br />Dorboln Crushkiller<br />&lt;In Via Damnum&gt;<br />Xev Server<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=911157" target="akztarg">http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_pr...?num=911157</a><br />Mindariax Tamuril<br />Blackburrow Server<br /><a href="http://eq2players.station.sony.com/en/pplayer.vm?characterId=116417103" target="akztarg">http://eq2players.station.sony.com/en/pplayer...d=116417103</a></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8"></td></tr></table>

I waited for a minuite, just to make sure I wasnt going to take this groups kill, no they were not fighting it, 100 percent on the hp bar, and hit it with my best nuke. Went on over a looted the aug.<br />I wasnt a mind reader, the mob is fairly common, and they looked like they could get exp in the zone while waiting for a respawn.<br /><br /><br />See what it COULD look like from the mages perspective?<br /><br />I would have tried to find a guild status and posted on their guild website. <br />Many is the time when I have been&nbsp;&nbsp;camped needing to med up a bit or heal. Someone else wanders buy looking for the mob (Ice giants usually, sometimes other mobs) and I let them know I am not ready to engage and if they are, go ahead and take the kill.<br /><br /><br />Along the same lines:<br /> Last night in unrest I had my alts on, cleric 18, Beastl 15 grouped with a guildy. Train shout is made and we see the 4 level 30 folks running out followed by the Fabled ghould magi. I quickly camp the cleric and log on as Jon (53 Paladin).<br />Wander down hoping to get the magi as he walks back, instead the group is fighting at the zone line.  Im low on manna but heal one of them and sit back against the wall. They are not doing a lot of damage, so after min or so I ask in OOC if they needed a hand. Magi was then around 52 percnet hp. They replied yes please. So I <br />waded in. Found, to my suprise that a 53 paladin could outdamage 4 level 30 players and a warder. When the mob went down I got the exp and the loot. Since I had brought the BL just to get the drop I let the group know that I was going to take it. (fabled gloves of the magi, ac 9 summoning efficency 2) I offered to buff them back up and help with the fabled undead knight as I already had that drop, but they left instead. <br />I dont feel bad, or that I was rude. They needed the help, asked for it and no one was more suprised than I, that I got the exp. <br /><br /></p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br />For Truth, Justice, and the Norrathian Way!</td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8">Posting from East Coast</td></tr></table>

If I'm rolling around with my main and see a mob I would like to take down (and considering how much those augs sell for, I'd like to take them down when I see them), I'm going to do it if I can. If I see a group there camping the spawn, I won't just rush in though. I'll ask if they're going after it, but they have a time limit. If they don't attack it after say... 10 minutes, I'm taking it. If they haven't attacked it by then, then they obviously can't handle the encounter, and therefor don't &quot;have&quot; the camp. While most people respect camps, it's also understood that if you can't handle a camp, you can't claim a camp. If they told me &quot;we're waiting on our warrior to get back, he got killed and we don't have a rezzer.&quot; then I'd give the benefit of the doubt and wait another 10 minutes or so. If they said &quot;We're looking for a warrior to tank because we can't handle it yet&quot; then they can't claim the camp.<br /><br />They may sound like a dickish thing to do to the lower guys, but respect works in both directions.

One of other groups of farmers  buffed every elemental in the towers to the teeth, because they had an enchanter (can charm giants) and we only had a mage (elementals only.)<br /><br />Basically, the guild-wars most servers had during velious, on a slightly smaller scale, complete with venemous ninja-recruiting.<br /><br />  It's the only time in everquest I've ever stooped to charmed-pet dispelling, albeit in retaliation for a series of trains. <br /><br />we also ran amuck over tactics, I actually got one of them banned when I found her mega-exploiting faction, the gm popped in right after she finished soloing rallos zek.<br /><br />horribly violent, mean, nasty, and one of the best times I've had in EQ.  the end result?  most of us became way better players than we would have without having had essentially pvp competition.  <br /><br /><br />now that my primary gear source is not what I've farmed myself, I'm much nicer on nameds.   I mostly avoid people I have problems with now -- easier, since we aren't competing for the same eight six-hour spawn mobs.  Except A.  I think I'd dump a train in her lap if I ever saw her again.  <br /><br /> </p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br /><a href="HTTP://www.czaemon.com" target="akztarg">Czaemon</a><br /></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8">Posting from retired. for the summer. kind of.</td></tr></table>

There is not a lot you can do if a group of uber guild mates who come in and decide to be rude if they do not break the SoE guidelines. <br /><br />It really depends on the players not the guild. There are several &quot;uber&quot; guilds on Cazic-Thule who I have been in groups with different members with (names left out but you know who they are).

In Kurns if someone killed the cook while I was waiting, glowing skull in hand, to do the turn in, I'd be pretty pissed.

Lets say, a Ukun Gutfeaster. While you are waiting, he pops and everyone gets ready. All of a sudden, a mage comes by and takes the mob, killing it off... loots the augmentation... Then tells us to get over it. His last declaration is that the mob is common... Spent the last two hours on line fighting ukuns. Stupid magi.<hr size="1" /></blockquote><br /><br />I'll answer by addressing the OP.<br /><br />Here's where I see flaws in your position. First off. You've been &quot;fighting ukuns&quot; for two hours, but for some reason are waiting for a warrior so you can take down the gutfeaster.<br /><br />Let me clue in a few people about DS rares. They are almost identical in difficulty to the PH mobs. The *only* difference is that the rares will summon.<br /><br />The Ukun gutfeaster is like 50 feet away from the port in. There are no mobs to clear and nothing else really nearby to kill. The *only* reason to kill the PHs is to get the gutfeaster to spawn.<br /><br /><br />One has to wonder what you were doing killing PHs for 2 hours if you couldn't actually kill the gutfeaster itself?<br /><br />I'm pretty sure that the mage was wondering the same exact thing. Honestly, I would have just left the camp to you anyway, but I'm nice that way. What you have to realize though is that in this particular case you *are* being just as selfish as the mage. The mobs in DS are on 20 minute respawn cycles. So every minute you sit there with a mob popped but not killing it is a minute longer before the next mob spawns. Since the rares are part of that cycle, one can argue that you are reducing the total number of future chances for people to get that spawn by sitting there not killing the one in front of you. That's pretty darn inconsiderate.<br /><br /><br />As several people have stated, there are no camps, but most people will respect a group that is &quot;in force&quot; and reasonably quick about engaging. This does not mean that you can &quot;call the mob&quot; and then sit there for 3 hours assembling enough people to kill it. No one's going to let you get away with that, and you are potentially screwing people over by doing it. With some mobs, the respawn is calculated in such a way that some idiot delaying 3 hours to kill it may cause the next respawn to fall outside the raid window of a group that might otherwise have been able to engage. It's *extremely* inconsiderate to sit on a spawn.<br /><br /><br />Piss or get off the pot. It is just as inconsiderate for you to sit there occupying a spawn but not killing it as it is for someone to run up and &quot;take&quot; your spawn. Seems a bit harsh, but you have to think about things from other players perspectives as well as yours.</p></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8">Posting from San Diego, CA</td></tr></table>

A lot of people were getting stressed out over those fire hornet wings. It was stupid of him to take it to /ooc, but, what ya gonna do?<br /><br />That's a problem you're always going to have as a bard though. Most bards pull with a non-damaging song, be it dispell, slow, snare, debuff, whatever. They're very low aggro generating songs, so it's easy for the tank to take aggro, and it &quot;preps&quot; the mob for the group. The downside is it's VERY easy for another puller to snag it if they want with something as simple as 1 arrow. I've had it done to me many times. If I'm trying to pull a mob that is in high demand, say a named in WoS for instance, I'll usually grab a few adds too. If they do manage to steal my named from me before I get to camp, they're going to have to deal with the adds after I fade... hope they got a chanter. I'll be sure to watch the named mobs HP in my targeting window too. If it starts to go up, they aren't engaged anymore and it's free for the pullin'.<br /><br />There was one time when someone stole a named from me after I did a beautiful fade split in middle sands in BoT. They stole the named and dragged it to lower sands. It was SO obvious I was pulling it, I mean, I had to fade split it twice to get it single, but they stole it anyway. Normally, I would of said something to them and left it at that, but this time I was mad. It was a nice pull! So, I memmed highsun, waited for the mob to get to 10%, then gated it back. Like idiots, they ran after it, and got all of the adds that I was able to split off (a kriger and 3 or 4 regular mobs). After the groups untimely demise, I fade split the named again and we got the loot (it only dropped a freakin' ring of thunderous spirits IIRC).<br /><br />Moral of the story: if you're a bard pulling highly contested mobs, be ready to deal with aggro stealing aszhats. You're GOING to run into them.<br /><br />This may all sound like very rude behavior. Just keep in mind that I don't resort to these tactics unless someone deserves them. If I run up and someone's already engaged or pulled a named, I wouldn't do any of this to get the named. It's only if I pull a mob first and someone tries to KS me.</p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br /><a href="HTTP://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1006062&resize=true" target="akztarg">Jiggidyjay</a> - <span class="sm">Mr Ranger</span><br /><a href="HTTP://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1003866&resize=true" target="akztarg">Zingin Ansinging</a> - <span class="sm">Mr Bard of <a href="HTTP://firestormers.com/viewnews.php" target="akztarg">The Firestormers</a></span><br /><a href="HTTP://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1006061&resize=true" target="akztarg">Zolotaya</a> - <span class="sm">Ms Necro</span><br /><a href="HTTP://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1189723" target="akztarg">Zeibis</a> - <span class="sm">Monk</span></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8">Posting from over the river and through the woods...</td></tr></table>

Not really an issue IMO. As you pointed out, the mobs are FFA since there are tons of them in the area, lots of people hunting them, and no mob is any &quot;better&quot; then any other.<br /><br />The rule for single mobs like that is that the group that agros it, gets it. First in force applies to specific mobs that drop specific items. That really doesn't apply here. Um. Let me be clear. In this case, you had *both*. You were &quot;first in force&quot; since you clearly were capable of killing the mob *and* you had it engaaged. The &quot;first in force&quot; rule is intended to give groups who are on the scene of a named/rare mob first shot at it as long as they are there first with a sufficient force and engage in a reasonable amount of time. It's pointless when it comes to general mob killing since every mob in the area applies (although most players will still recognize a group &quot;in force&quot; at a specific camp or group of spawns even though it's not required by the rules). The first in force rule is not intended to be some additional requirement for groups/raids, but an alternative method of establishing &quot;ownership&quot; of a mob. Normal rules say engagement gives you ownership. The problem is that raid forces generally need a bit of prep time and there were issues with folks jumping raids. Some raid groups would respond to this by kiting a mob around until they finished assembling and/or prepping, but then this got abused, so the first in force rule came into being to prevent it. It should never be applied to random mobs in an area.<br /><br /><br /><br />Long ago I got in the habit of /assisting mobs prior to pulling them (especially if they were moving or we were anywhere near other people). My thinking is that if the mob is argoed on someone, my /assist will target that person. If the mob doesn't have anyone targeted, then it's free to pull.<br /><br />Looks like that guy will have to learn that lesson. He certainly should not have been pissed at you (and you should not have been so at him either). It's not uncommon at all to see the mob, but not the other group of PCs hunting the mob. Mistakes happen. I find it's best to just shrug them off and move on.
