Lets get going!<br><br>Races.<br>Well races are pretty much a mixed bag, from the role playing standpoint any race will do and any stat shortages can be overcome later on. My warrior I chose was a barbarian, It was my first character and if I made another I would choose the same. But my stats would be a bit different. I started with something like 125 str, boosted my AGI and put nothing in DEX because it wasn't highlighted in Green on the character creation screen. HEY I was a newb calm down:). As I hit my mid levels and start using more weapons that proc I find myself looking for items that raise my pathetic 70 dex, sigh.... In hindsight I would probably raise str to 120 and put the rest into dex, or even less str and more dex. It&#8217;s your choice. Yes the other classes do make good choices, but I hate faction work and I have never had a faction problem with my barbarian, even a lot of the mobs con amiable to me for some reason I can't fathom. Barbarians also get slam without a shield, but in my weapon selection I will discuss why this isn't too important.<br><br>Making Money<br><br>Ironic that I am writing in this post because It seemed like I was always broke. As a warrior you have an interesting way to make money, Use that strength of yours. After you save up 30pp from carrying home every single piece of loot you can pick up, start banking. Go to a mixed zone with some High level players, Ever frost is a great place for this. Ask ooc if anyone needs a banker, Basically you run out to the high levels who are toasting giants, they give you a sh*t load of gold and items and you pay them a slightly discounted price, then run back to town much richer. Gold exchanges with PP anywhere from 20g-1pp to 55g-5pp depending on how stingy that high level player is:) they will also sell you FS weapons and other things for 2-3pp each or less, plus they may sometime give them to you for free. Banking can be good way to get several hundred platinum in a short time. Plus it gives you great stories, I got to tell all the other level 7's about how the Ice giant attacked me and I lived. <br><br>Soloing<br><br>Huh? Warriors solo? How you ask? Well first off yes it is possible, I soloed on and off up to level 31 which is where I am now. I soloed steadily from level 24-29 with little trouble; I have even soloed in MistMoore, which is hard to hunt in with a group. My advice on soloing, as soon as you can afford it, Learn Bandage! This skill will help you get back up to 50% health where you should be able to kill a low blue. Secondly, Kill LOW blues, nothing black after 16 or so. At 25 I was still getting 1/3 or more blue bubbles each kill of a level 21 mob. At 31 I can hunt level 24-25 mobs and still get decent exp, if your going to solo live with the fact that you will be soloing young. Now what do you look for when you are finding a spot to solo? The best places to look for have mobs that don't aggro, like Oasis, Aviaks in SK, and the hermit in SK, however you can solo in places like LOIO and MM with a little caution. Also make sure you have a SoW whenever possible, and if you have the cash buy a potion or two, real Lifesavers. The hermit in SK is a personal favorite of mine, He is a druid, but killing him gives NO faction hits, he is an easy kill 25-28 and gives good exp, plus 5g-3pp and occasional FS loots. He spawns once every three minutes, just sit on the roof of his house (So wandering Techs Mas gnolls don't aggro you, It is rare but they can wander over here, I have had it happen, they are all near 28-30 and hit HARD and will leave you dead or hurting.) when you see him cast a spell stand in front of his door, His door is locked so what you need to do is move so you can see through the space between the door and the wall and target him, walk to the door out of the gate around his house, open it, say outloud, "I kill you" yes I know its corny, but he will aggro you and chase after you to where you want to kill him at. He spawns about every 3minutes give or take 10 seconds giving you time to bandage up and rest back to half health. Good luck soloing as long as you can, but remember grouping can be much more fun and later on you have too, plus you need to learn taunt, more on that later.<br><br>Where to Hunt<br><br>This is a continuation of my last post and is from the perspective of a good race with starting faction.<br>1-4/5 Whatever newbie zone you started in should do for now, If you started in Everfrost the zone is excellent, with a plethora of enemies all in narrow valleys lined up to fall beneath your sword. Plus save all polar bear skins, turn them in to the woman in mac's kilt shops for gold and free armor plus exp. nice. Other good quests for this level is the ice goblin necklace, which is given in the bottom of the warrior&#8217;s guild by a female in plate mail. At 5 you can pick gnolls off the entrance to BB. Things to watch out for, aggroing large mobs of bears and wolves can be bad, plus Vengeful's are bad. Vengefuls look like normal decaying skeletons but are around level 8-12 and are named lyricist, soloist, I think conductor or something similar, it has been a long time:).<br><br>6-16<br><br>You will spend all your time either in BB, which is great for faction, or in Everfrost tundra; this is where you will be banking if you choose too. BB is a great spot if you are careful, watch out for trains and strange pathing. Always pick up any gnoll fangs you find, they are GREAT exp even into level 10. You can turn gnoll fangs in at two places nearby, Halas(3) or Qeynos(4) Turn them in in halas to the same lady you turned in the necklaces too in the bottom of the warriors guild. The other spot is the warrior guild leader in South Qeynos, to get there take the other exit from the top of BB, when you zone walk out of the tunnel and go along the left wall until you find a path and a guard tower, follow the path and take a left at the rock marker(If you turn around you go to West Karanas or take a right to goto Surefall) run along about 50 yards and you will zone into north qeynos. Run straight forward between the guard and into the small tunnel, run straight with the building on your left into another little tunnel, continue straight, take a right and you will find the zone to South Qeynos, (Anyone think that Qeynos backwards is Sony EQ is a little suspicious?) Head left past the clock, forward and then left, straight and you will come out by a large circular structure that is the arena, head around it to your right to find the way in, the Guild leader is on the top floor, his name is Captain Tillin, give him 4 gnoll fangs (Not Stacked!) and he will give you four moonstones and some good exp. You can turn the moonstones into the bartender near the docks, just look for a bar with a second bar in the back and when you hail the bartender he tells you to show these people how a real puddle walker drinks, or something similar. Give him four moonstones for crappy exp and for 4 bottles of alcohol you can sell, or drink if you&#8217;re a real warrior:). Now where in BB can you hunt? basically work your way from top to bottom as you get older, and don't worry about grouping or soloing, either one works and both are great for this place. Also there are several good pieces of newbie equipment in here that raise str and give agi.<br>Everfrost tundra has some great hunting for Ice orcs and mammoth calfs, plus some other miscellaneous stuff. Mammoth calf hides drop of calfs and can be given to a rogue in the bank at Halas, (Ps the banker is on rogue faction, if you hurt your rogue faction too much you can't bank, so do this quest early to raise faction) you will get a nice piece of rogue only armor that sells for several pp to store for 4 calf hides. Orcs drop bracers that can be turned in (2) at Mac's kilts, same lady, or (4) to lady in warrior&#8217;s guild. Grouping out here can be nice, or you can hang along a wall and solo stuff, I soloed calfs from about 13-16 and it worked well alternating with the elite ledge in BB.<br><br>15-18<br>Really I must say my favorite places for these levels was High hold, to get there just run across all the karanas following the labeled paths, but for your first trip you should go with someone else to learn the way. You can be bound in HH, which is wonderful for us melees. One side is filled with Gnolls, the other side has Orcs, I started at gnolls, then went to orcs, but either side is ok, Orcs work FP faction Gnolls work Karanas faction. Gnoll scalps can be turned into the guard at the Gnoll area, captain something, I am not sure how many you turn in at once. The orcs lie to the other side and are also a little higher level. This zone is great Exp but you should really group, the experience is good for you. Also there are several vendors in this zone who will buy the Ringmail you will be picking up for several PP (That is after you equip yourself any missing pieces of armor) Plus there is a bank if you zone into High Hold itself. Now what really makes this zone great? Rare drops, Two named gnolls spawn and drop the Polished granite tomahawk(PGT, 6/28 procs a +str -agi damage absorbing at level 10 or else 11, memory fuzzy), and Cracked darkwood shield( ac 5-8 shield +9 str not sure on AC), the named orc drops a Shralok Pack(8 slot 25% weight reduction and holds giant items) This thing Rocks!. I spent about 4 days here going from level 15-18 and picked up a Shield and Pack that I still use. A point of good advice, after your group(You are grouping right?) kills the named gnoll, everyone will roll for the rare item, by typing /ran 100 it will pick a number between 1-100 and display it. whoever gets the highest number gets the item, Good luck!.<br><br>19-24/25 Lake of Ill Omen<br>When I hit this level the zones had been in place for awhile, There are two ways to get there, you can head through OT and Which is insanely hard because you will be trying to dodge level 35-45+ monsters that run faster then a SoW and will aggro you like no tomorrow. The other way, which I only found out about recently is MUCH safer and I recommend it. Go to East freeport, ride a boat to butcher block, get on a shuttle to take you to Firiona Vie. Once you&#8217;re in firiona GET A BIND. Now, LOIO is only one zone away, but getting there can be tricky, the path is strewn with level 30 ish monsters that cast spells and are generally bitchy. there are two ways, Get a sow and run it like mad, or try and weave between mobs. Either one will work and both can result in a heart attack. To get out of this zone cross the bridge out of the town, head left along the shore until it meets a river you will see a giant iskar statue standing over the river, basically follow the river straight to the zone. One minor note, I was doing a corpse run at night and as I stopped at the base of the statue I clicked around once or twice to see if any mobs where nearby. I targets Soandso's pet. as I sat there thinking about that the pet aggroed on me and the 50ish necro dotted me with a spell that drained 700hp in about 25 seconds. Talk about fun corpse run experiences. That is the only real problem I had in FV. Now once you get to LOIO what are you going to do, Join a group, until your high 20's or 30 this is a great zone to group in, at 19-23 you will probably be grouped on the shore pulling in wandering monsters, you can then move on to the frontdoor(FD) and backdoor(BD) of the sarnak fort, which is also a good spot in a group. If your group is very good/brave you can camp inside the fort. this is probably where you will solo to avoid harassing the groups outside later. On the far side of the lake is a giant windmill(WM) you can sell here, get sows, get healed and other stuff from players, this is like the newbie ramp of the zone. Near this is the ruins of a house that is filled with undead you can group there as well. when you hit low to mid 20's you can always zone over to the Frontier Mountains(FM) and hunt Hill giants at the fortress.<br><br>25-28 HERMIT <br><br>I must say, the hermit in SK is the greatest place to hunt I have found, easy to kill, great exp and loot, good spawn rate, little danger. He is in the middle of South Karana, get the loc from a kind player. and bring a lot of Bandages, no real vendors nearby for a warrior, or ask a magician to summon some for you(Tip the poor guy!). If you want to group head west a little to the Aviaks (KFC... Karanas Fried Chicken) you can't miss it, looks like a giant tree house. good hunting and they don't aggro you unless you are attacking another, they range from about 15-29 levels. Another place is to hunt Mammoths in Everfrost, you can bank while doing this, and there tusks sell for 8-10 pp, only downside is there are never many mammoths and it might seem like the rangers and druids are getting them ALL. hehehe oh well that&#8217;s why I left there, but its great money if you like hunting there. Hunt from the Mammoth ruins on the south wall.<br><br>29-30 I soloed in KFC with a lot of luck and no deaths, or you can goto Rathe Mountains which is one zone south one zone east and kill some giant skeletons for decent exp. I also soloed out of level 30 in MistMoore. Mistmoore can be a deathtrap with a group. It&#8217;s almost a promised deathtrap without a group. Unless your group is well past mid thirties do not pull from any farther then the graveyard and the outer courtyard. MEMORIZE the way to the zone. Mobs will aggro you almost always, they will start horrible trains if you let them. Also there are two spawns of grinning/sneering/leering Gargoyles in the main yard. They are like Mammoths in Everfrost. They drop eyes that are stackable and sell for 8-10pp. There is a narrow canyon path between courtyard and outside the graveyard, if you are pulling from here and see a mob walking towards the courtyard, careful, the two times I have attacked this mob it sprinted back down the path into the heart of MM castle and started one hell of a train. For that matter, if you attack something and it disappears, count to about 15 seconds, if it doesn't show up get to the zone now, and if anyone ever yells Train you had better listen and move to the zone ASAP. Lastly you can Solo in LOIO by picking off sarnaks inside the fort, at the FD/BD or at the skelly hut(ruins of house).<br><br>Weapon Choices and Skills<br><br>What do I use as a warrior? Well there are arguments for every type of weapon from blunt(jade mace) to piercing and so on. I have chosen 1hs and 2hs with a little archery (Anyone capable of using a bow should use one.) The main reason I choose 1hs/2hs was because that&#8217;s what are epics are, and for different things each weapon type is better. Up until about level 30 when you get 4 attacks with 1hs weapons a 2hs will outdamage you so I keep both and keep them maxed, but in a group I almost exclusively use 1hs for the taunt and extra hits. A brief explanation of what I know about taunt. Taunt determines how high you are on the monsters hate list, AKA who is it going to attack. Taunt seems to be less based on damage and more on the number of times you hit the mob. You can also raise your taunt by using the taunt skill (I didn't need to say that did I....?) Always keep your taunt skill maxed, it will save your group mates lives many times. I have read pages and pages of debate on which of two one handed slashing theories is correct, The two beliefs are that you should put a fast weapon in your main hand, and a slow weapon in your offhand, or vice versa. The thoughts are this, some think your offhand weapon gets a chance to attack everytime your main weapon swings, no matter what its delay is. The other thought is your offhand attacks whenever your main does ONLY if its delay has cycled from the last attack, so if the delay is higher on your offhand it will only attack every other time your main does. I am not sure which one is correct so I just stick with two weapons with good ratios, right now an Ice tooths claw main(11/29) and Berserkers sword offhand (12/36) this combo works well for me and I am happy so far. Plus this is a cheap combo with Ice tooths running from 200-350 and berserkers from 85-150. Bind wound is a great skill if you plan on soloing at all and hate sitting there watching hitpoints come back at 2/3/4/5 hp a tick. Sense heading is great to find your way around, if you can learn to use it and /loc effectively you will never have a problem finding anyone or anything. I have worked on fishing on and off, its nice when your waiting for that damn boat because your too broke to pay for a port. plus its a little free food, take it or leave it. Now heres a great one, Bash versus Kick. I choose kick for a few reasons. One I can use it with two one handed slashing, you can't bash with two swords. Secondly later on in life I am going to use 1hs a lot more as a warrior then 2hs so I want to be able to kick. Bash does stun but I figure the much faster 1hs attacks make up for that. Kick is capped lower, But I believe that cap is lifted when get to very high levels, not 100% on that, leave Bash for Shadow Knights and Paladins. Dodge caps at 140 so those Monks feel special, so when it stops at 140 don't be surprised.<br><br><br>Miscellaneous crap.<br><br>Be polite and always tip when you can afford it. Do not beg, that level 30 player had to work just as hard to get the stuff he has as you did, and he is probably just as broke, I might have 30pp in the bank and people are sending me tells asking for 300pp. They forget that higher level players are constantly spending there money on stuff the same as younger players, so don't beg its annoying and rude.<br>When you get to level 20 and your skills break 100 instead of saying a word like average/poor/very bad it says master and shows you the number your stat is at.<br><br>Other Tidbits.<br><br>So what do warriors get to make up for this lack of magic you ask? well our major benefits are an increasing resist magic stat that raises as you gain levels. At level 20/30/40... we get extra HP bonus, nothing amazing but very nice. We also get disciplines. I just got my first at level 30, which gives me +3 to all resists for 3 minutes, ok I know it stinks but they get better. Some of the ones you get later include resistance to fear, greater accuracy, greater defense, super riposte and a few others. <br><br>Closing Thoughts<br><br>As a warrior you get to be constantly in the melee, the center of the action, however don't let yourself be fooled, at later levels you are not there to do damage, you are there to Piss the mob off and keep it attacking you, so it doesn&#8217;t hurt that little caster back there lining up his nuke. If you actually read all of this I am proud, send any thoughts to Rcuhljr@aol.com. you can also respond here but the email would be nice:) I hope this helps you and if you ever have any questions feel free to ask me in the game or email me. I am on server Druzzil Ro Stay safe you guys!<br></p>&nbsp;<br>Lancegar Barbarian warrior of the 43th rank DEAD :(<br>Ireul Necro of the 16th circle</td></tr>

Your life has mirrored mine in many ways.  I also lacked the dex which I would change.  Here is what I would add to your post: train all weapon skills. I know that our epics are 1hs and 2hs but there is a time where u will use weapons that are 1hb piercing and even 2hb.  I myself made a joke at 45 which was- what honest warrior would use a piercing weapon.  Now I am 55 and guess what I use two Bloodpoints.  If your not up on Bloodpoints look them up I believe these are some of the best pre-epic weapons in the game.  So at level 50 I trained for three days in dreadlands on piecring and raised it a 175 points. Post level 50 it becomes very hard to train weapons trust me.)  The second thing I would add is this-Bash rules as a barbarian.  When u start hitting your 40's u will be expected to interrupt casters and bash is the skill of choice for this.  Bind wounds start from level one. another skill i picked up at 30(.   So practice up everything and good luck.  The Warrior is one of the best classes to play when u hit 50 you can walk into runnyeye and slaughter the whole place non=stop. Not that I am bragging about being able to do it I do it for revenge from when I died there all the time in my late 20's.</p>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>
