	   <tr><td colspan=2>Okay this got bumped back to the 3rd page so I am reposting it: <br><br>First off choose your race. I suggest putting 25 points into intelligence and 5 into charisma. Also, DON'T BE A HUMAN OR DARK ELF IF YOU ARE JUST STARTING THE GAME. Dark elves are evil and will get killed on sight by a lot of other races. Some people say humans level faster than every other race...well guess what..THEY DON'T. Plus humans start with the lowest intelligence and are blind in the night. Also, I wouldn't suggest being an Erudite if you are a newbie. They are nightblind and have THE WORST starting zone in the game. If you are just starting your character I suggest being a Gnome or High Elf. These races are good aligned, have infravision, and start on the continent of Faydwer...which is a MUCH more newbie oriented continent with less dangers. If you have experience with the game, be any race you want. If you don't like gnomes or high elves, at least just be one for a little bit to get used to the game. When you start give your note to your guildmaster and get your newbie robe. Put one training point into piercing, evocation, abjuration, conjuration, and channeling. Scribe your two newbie spells minor shielding and Burst of Flame. Always keep yourself buffed with minor shielding - it does make a big difference at low levels. Use Burst of Flame to help kill your enemy while you melee it. get to level 4...no big problem. <br><br>Now the fun starts. At level 4 you get new spells and the meditation skill. Only put one point into meditate. It will rise very quickly. You should buy Summon food, Summon water, Flare, Summon dagger (all level 1 spells)...Summon Bandages, Burn, Gate, level 4 earth pet, level 4 water pet. At level 4 you should only buy the earth and water pets. The air and fire ones aren't very useful at these levels, however will become much more useful at higher levels (especially the air pet!). Since you can summon bandages it is a good idea to summon a lot of them and practice your bind wound skill. It will allow you to heal any player, including your self up to half health. Also at these lower levels it is a VERY good idea to give your pets rusty two-handed weapons (rusty scythes, two-handed swords, and halberds). They will make your pets do MASSIVE damage and allow you to take BIG things. Now from level 4 until 8 your fighting strategy will be simple: send your pet, nuke the MOB with your damage spell (called a DD for short, for all you newbies reading this), and go in and tank for a pet if needed. Since you started out as a gnome or high-elf like I told you to (you did didn't you, hehe), you will be able to kill kobolds to get to level 6. If you are a high elf just run to steamfont...its only a 5 minute run. If you are a gnome...well steamfont is your newbie zone so you should already be there. The kobold camp has 3 kobolds that spawn at the camp and one off the side of the camp on the mountainside. To take the 3 kobolds you will need to give your pet a rusty scythe, two-handed sword, or halberd. They aren't that hard to find. Go to greater faydark and ask around for some. Or go to Felwithe, the starting city of the high elves. You will be able to find some rusty two-handers at many vendors. Kobolds will get you to level 6. Once you get to level 6 I suggest going to Butcher Block and killing dwarven skeletons at the druid ring. They are levels 5-7 and are VERY good exp. If your pet has a two hander you will do very well. The dwarven skeletons will get you to level 8. If you didn't start as a High Elf or Gnome (not recommended if you are first starting everquest), then just find stuff around your newbie zone. At levels 4-8 its not like there is a lack of things kill. IMO find a skeleton camp if you didn't start as a High Elf or gnome. They are in almost every newbie zone and will get you to level 8. <br><br>Some people when they first start out don't know how to control their pets. Here are most of the commands you will need to use to control your pet. <br><br>/pet attack - send your pet after whatever you want. <br>/pet back off - makes your pet back off the thing you are fighting. Has to be hit multiple times to work, and if your enemy attacks you, your pet will go in again. <br>/pet report health - this command makes your pet tell you how much health it has left. VERY useful command. Use it a lot in battle. Make sure your pet doesn't die. <br>/pet guard here - makes your pet stay where they are and come assist you if anything attacks you. They will return to the spot they left after killing whatever attacked you. <br>/pet get lost - if you get a lower level pet and you aren't satisfied, use this command to get rid of the pet and summon a more powerful one. <br><br>Some other things about pets. Once you get to level 8 MAKE SURE that you outdamage your pet with you DD spells. If you don't outdamage your pet then your pet will get half of the exp. from whatever you killed. From level 4-7 its fine if your pet outdamages you, and since you should be giving your lower level pets rusty two-handed weapons to make them do A LOT more damage, you probably won't be able to outdamage your pet. However once you get to level 8 make sure you take a little over half of your enemy's HP off with your own DD's so you get full exp. for the kill. <br><br>Also, I CONSTANTLY hear newbies asking, &amp;#8220;which pet is the best.&amp;#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, there is no best pet. All of the pets have times when they are good and times when they are bad. One of the best things about being a magician is your selection of pets. Here is the basic run-down on all of the pets: <br><br>Earth &amp;#8211; Has the most HP out of all the pets and casts root a lot. This pet has very low agility however, so it gets hit a lot, and it does the lowest amount of damage out of all the pets(mainly because it misses a lot.) However, since it does have a MASSIVE amount of hitpoints it is the pet that can take a beating for the longest amount of time. This pet is good for when you need to take down something big, or for when you really don&amp;#8217;t want something running away (since it casts root sooo much). <br><br>Water &amp;#8211; This pet is the pet that is totally balanced. It has good hitpoints, good agility, and does good damage. Its special abilities are that it is immune to poison and that it has regen. This pet is good for when you are camping a spot where things re-pop very quickly, since it regains its hitpoints so quickly from the regen. It also shines when fighting snakes that poison, since it is immune to poison. And lastly, it is a great pet for when you are poor, because you can buy just this pet and do all right with only it. <br><br>Air- This pet has the highest agility and dexterity out of all of the pets. However it also has low hitpoints and doesn&amp;#8217;t do a whole lot of damage (although it does do a little more than the earth). The air pet is not good at lower levels when its high agility and dexterity don&amp;#8217;t help very much. However, once you get to about level 20, it becomes a great pet to use. This pet&amp;#8217;s special abilities are that it casts invisiblity on itself, and a stun spell on enemies. It is a great pet to use in dungeons since it goes invisible, and a great pet to use against casters, since its stun spell will interrupt casters. This pet is also not good at lower levels, because at lower levels it doesn&amp;#8217;t cast its stun spell much. However, as you go up in levels it will start casting it more frequently. I recommend waiting until 20 to get this pet. It isn&amp;#8217;t very good at the lower levels, but at higher levels it really shines!(especially in duels versus casters). <br><br>Fire &amp;#8211; This pet is the worst tank out of all the pets, meaning that it will die the quickest, however it makes up for this by being able to do MASSIVE amounts of damage. What makes it do so much damage is its damage shield. When you cast the pet it comes with a damage shield that is about twice as good as the one that you could cast at that level. It also casts a fire-based DD spell that does a good amount of damage. When using this pet you will also be saving mana, since you won&amp;#8217;t have to cast your damage shield on it, since it already has one. This pet is used when you want to kill something really quick. However, don&amp;#8217;t forget that the fire pet must be taking hits to do its massive damage. Otherwise, its damage shield won&amp;#8217;t come into play, which is what makes it do soooo much damage. I find this pet as when of the most fun to use, simply because of how fast it lets you take things down (and how it looks). <br><br>Level 8 is when magicians start to become really good. At this level they get two great DD's, a damage shield, invisibility, a pet healing spell, a bunch of minor summoning spells, and of course your pets. The problem is that at this level spells suddenly cost a LOT for their level and you will have A LOT of spells to buy. If you have another higher level character this is no problem, but new characters will have to conserve their money. If you are low on money I suggest buying these spell first and the rest later: level 8 earth pet, Shock of Blades, Shield of Fire, Invisibility, and Staff of Tracing. These are the only spells you will need for now. The summon staff spell can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. Now to make a ton of money you are going to hunt wisps. Wisps can only be hit by magical means( ie spells or a magical weapon), so it is very important to buy your level 8 summon staff spell, because it will make your pets able to hit the wisps. <br><br>The best place to hunt wisps is on the wisp island located between Odus and Qeynos. To get to it, ride the boat from Qeynos to Odus and get off at the island the boat stops at in the middle of the ride. Be sure you brought a lot of backpacks/small containers. The strategy to kill these things will be summon an earth pet and give it a staff you summoned. Then buff the earth pet with your fire damage shield. Then send it in on the wisp and stand back and keep burning the wisp until it is dead. Tank for your pet and cast your shock of swords spell in-between the attacks of the wisp if needed. Make sure the wisp you attack is alone and there are no other ones near. Wisps WILL assist each other and at this level 2 wisps means death. Also, you will want to use your level 1 &quot;summon dagger&quot; spell against the wisps because it will summon a magical weapon, and if you are just starting out and don't have a higher level character, you probably won't have access to a magical weapon. Now when you loot the wisps destroy the burnt out lightstone and regular lightstone they drop. However save the Greater Light Stones. You will get one greater lightstone for about every 5 wisps you kill. When all of your backpacks and containers are totally full with Greater light stones, take them to the gypsy camp in North Karana if you are good aligned, or South Ro if you are evil, and give them to one of the ladies (I forget which lady it is exactly...just ask someone. If no one knows then just hail them all. The one you want is the one that talks about the Concordance of research.). For every greater light stone you give her you will get a good deal of exp. for this level and about 9pp. Very soon you will have enough money to buy the rest of your spells. Here are all the other level 8 spells you will want to buy: <br><br>Renew Elements - this spell will heal your pets. It is good spell during downtime if they aren't fully healed by the time your mana is full. You won't need it with your level 8 pets, but your level 12 pets that have more hp and regen slower (because of your pet buff burnout) might need to be healed sometimes. This spell is based off your Alteration magic group. This is the first alteration spell you will get. It will fizzle a lot, so practice it up. <br><br>Dimensional Pocket - this spell summons a 4-slot weightless container that makes anything you put into it weightless. Very useful, however USE WITH CAUNTION. The pocket, and everything you put in it, will disappear if you log off. Is good at higher levels when MOBS are dropped a lot of weapons that are too heavy to carry. Just summon a pocket and put them in it until you can go sell them. This spell can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Eye of Zoom - this isn't as useful a spell as it is fun. It will summon an eye than you can move around and see with. You can't have a pet out to cast this spell. Its fun to scout out an area with or scare lower level people, but it isn't really that useful. It also has a pretty short duration. <br><br>Lesser Shielding - this is an upgrade to your level 1 minor shielding spell. Always keep yourself buffed with it. <br><br>Flame Bolt - this is the other DD (direct damage) spell you get at level 8. It has a MUCH farther range than shock of swords and does more damage per hit. The downsides to it are that it takes more mana, has a slightly longer casting time, requires you to have a clear line of sight with your enemy, and will get resisted a lot by things with high fire resists. Its good for pulling things because you will be able to get 3 of them off before the monster can reach you, but generally you will want to use Shock of Swords. <br><br>If you ever suddenly feel like not making tons of money and get bored of wisps (unlikely), their are some other good spots to hunt. The first is the single siren spawn in OOT (ocean of tears). Take the boat from FP to BB. Eventually you will come to two large rocks jutting out of the water. Jump off the boat and swim to the left one. On the opposite side of the rock where you swam to is a level 12 siren. You can take her at level 8. Before you go get a bind at the docks in FP. The exp. is great, but its not quite as good as wisps, and the loot is nowhere near as good. In addition to the single spawn siren is the entire zone of steamfont. This zone has TONS of level 7-11 things...minotaurs, skeletons, pumas, plague rats, earth elementals, and even harpies! At level 8 you will be able to take all the 11 things if your pet has a weapon. I highly suggest using an earth pet if you come here. A good place to pull things is near the entrance of the minotaur cave on the wall. Ask for directions to the cave. The real danger here is the level 35 minotaur hero that will sometimes spawn and come near the mino cave. If you stay on the wall you will usually be fine. The last place to hunt from level 8-12 is in the east commons. Here you will see darkweed snakes practically carpeting the ground. Use a water pet to kill them because they have a VERY nasty poison attack, and the water pet will totally negate the effects of it. You will be able to take them fairly easy even if you don't give your water pet a rusty two-hander. With a rusty two-hander you will beat them into oblivion. <br><br>Now you will be able to get to level 12 quickly by killing wisps and turning in Greater Light Stones (or if you already had plenty of money so you went to one of my other suggested places). You will also make a ton of money (if you hunted wisps). I highly suggest buying a Stein of Mogguk with all your new money. It gives +10 to your intelligence, which gives you more mana. Also, I would buy some other +int necklaces, earrings, and rings. A new robe would be good too (do you wanna wear your newbie robe forever??) Here are the level 12 spells you will want to buy: <br><br>Burnout - This spell will make your pets regen their hp slower, but it will also make them attack better. A good pet buff spell. Always keep it on your pet. <br><br>Bind Affinity - AWESOME SPELL. This will allow you to bind yourself anywhere so that when you die, that&amp;#8217;s where you will appear. Before you got this spell you had to have other people bind you, and you can only be bound in cities when other people cast it. <br><br>Cancel Magic - this has several uses. First off it can be used to remove any buffs your enemy has on themselves. Secondly, it can be used to remove most (but not all) DoT&amp;#8217;s (or damage over time spells) that were cast on you by the enemy. <br><br>Ward Summoned - This is a good spell to use in lavastorm. The only problem is that there are way better places to hunt than lavastorm. Against elementals it is VERY good. It does the damage of fire bolt, and has the low resist, quick casting time, and lower mana that Shock of Steel has. However, it can only be used against summoned things. The only time you will use it is when dueling other people that have pets. <br><br>Summon Fang - This spell summons a 5/26 weapon that will hit magical creatures (hehe wisps!). If you still don't have a magical weapon at this level use this instead of your level 1 summon dagger spell to hit wisps with. You can fight wisps up to level 16, so it will still be useful. It can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Elemental Earth - Your earth pet will be the only pet you need to buy. It has massive hp and casts a root spell to keep the enemy away from you. Buffed with burnout and with its massive hp, you might get to full mana before it gets to full health. If that happens use your renew elements spell. <br><br>You also get two area effect spells at this level. The first type are rain spells. These are very good against 1-3 enemies. Against a single enemy a rain spell will hit 3 times. Against 2-3 enemies your rain will hit twice. Against 4 enemies you rain will hit once. Against more than 4 enemies your rain will only hit 4 of the enemies. The second type of AoE spells hits all enemies once. These AoE's are good against 4 or more enemies. <br><br>At level 12 there are a lot of things open to you. You can kill wisps all the way until level 16. At level 12 your pets will be to hit magical things without wielding magical weapons. Since your level 12 pets will only do 16 damage per hit (and that&amp;#8217;s the maximum level pet), you should be giving them rusty-two handed weapons. If you can't get any two-handed weapons then just give your pet any weapon. If your pet has a weapon they will do a little more damage than normal even if the weapon doesn't make them hit for a higher maximum damage. Verant says it won&amp;#8217;t do anything, but I don&amp;#8217;t care. At least just give your pet a summoned weapon so they look pretty. Now if you don't want to kill wisps there are a ton of other things to do. <br><br>In Lake Rathe there is a level 15 monk called the hermit. He stands in this hut in the corner of the zone, and respawns every 5 minutes after being killed. He can get you to level 16 if you don't want to do wisps, or want to mix things up. Summon an earth pet, buff with damage shield and burnout, and then send your pet in and stand back and blast with Shock of Swords until he dies. If you don&amp;#8217;t want to use an earth pet, try a fire pet. Since this guy is a monk, he does a lot of attacks per round, you&amp;#8217;re your fire pet&amp;#8217;s damage shield will help very much. Tank for pet if needed, however don't do it too much. At level 12 he will kill you quickly. Remember, make sure to outdamage your pet. He is very good exp. and will get you to level 16 pretty quick. The loot isn't nearly as good as wisps though. <br><br>Another place to hunt is in OOT (the ocean of tears), which is located between the continents of Antonica and Feydwer. You will be hunting sirens in this zone. Go to the docks in Freeport and bind yourself there. If you take the ship from Freeport to butcher block you will eventually come to two large rocks coming out of the water. Jump off the boat and swim to the rock on the right. Here you will see two level 12 sirens. Buff your water pet with burnout and your damage shield and send it in. If you bought your area effect spells this would be the time to use them (the rain based AoE works best). The sirens hit fairly hard but have low hp. After you kill the two sirens they will start spawning one at a time. Quickly kill them using your rain AoE, and make sure you spread out their spawns. That way you won't have to fight 2 at a time anymore. This spot is AMAZING exp., however like the hermit; it is not nearly as good loot as wisps. Also, be sure to give your pet a rusty two-handed sword before you engage the sirens. The best spot to buy rusty weapons is on the boat from Freeport to butcher block. At the first stop you will arrive at sister island. Get off and go in the shop. They sell rusty halberds here. When giving to your pet, they will make your pet do 20 damage a hit. Also, it is highly suggested to use a water pet here, since you will have to kill 2 things every 5 minutes it is a better choice than the earth pet that might not be able to keep up with the quick spawns. <br><br>Soon you will be level 16. All of these methods will level you fast (although I still think wisps are the best method because they give so much money). Once you get to level 16 the best place to hunt is in lake rathe, which is where the hermit was located if you went to fight him from 12-16. Before I talk about lake rathe I will tell you your new spells for level 16: <br><br>Shock of Flame - a new DD spell! At level 12 you didn't get a real DD, except for ward summoned which you probably didn't use. Sure, you got the rain spell, which can hit 3 times against a single enemy; making it mana efficient and doing good damage, but you didn&amp;#8217;t get a real DD spell. For 70 mana this spell will start off doing 90-some damage. <br><br>See Invisible - this spell will allow you to see invisible players and pets. Since your air pet casts invisibility on itself a lot, its good to use this spell when using an air pet. <br><br>Summon Throwing Daggers - this spell will summon a bunch of throwing dagger that can be given to someone that uses throwing weapons (monks, rogues, and bards in general). This spell can only be bought in the dark elf, gnome, and erudite cities. <br><br>Heatstone - this spell will summon an item that will grant the user infravision. Is good to give to night-blind races or to use yourself if you started as an Erudite or human (Although if you are a beginner you probably did what I said and started as a gnome or high elf, which means you all ready have infravision). <br><br>Staff of Warding - summons an 8/38 staff with a couple charges of glimpse (which always you to see farther). It really doesn't have much use except to play around with the glimpse spell it comes with (or you can give it to a low level newbie...is a good weapon for a newbie). This spell can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Level 16 pets - At this level I would suggest buying all the pets. Also at this level you can not buy all the pets in your guild. The level 16 and 20 pets must be bought in OOT (the ocean of tears). The island next to Sister Island where the AC spawns is where you will find the vendor. <br><br>Shielding - An upgrade to your lesser shielding spell. keep it on at all times. The extra hp and ac can save your life if you need to tank and it&amp;#8217;s a close battle. <br><br>Phantom Leather - this spell boots your AC and also lets your regen your HP a little faster. It is good for if you are going into a tough battle where you will probably have to tank. It takes a cat&amp;#8217;s eye agate component to cast. <br><br>At level 16 you get the ability to start researching. Go to your guild and put one point into your researching skill and it will be maxed until level 20(there is a bug where after putting a point in at your guild it raises your skill higher then its supposed to). Of all the pure casters, magicians have it the hardest when it comes to researching. They have to combine old spells, a word, and an item to make scrolls they can use. I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about researching because it would take a LONG time to explain. So go to castersrealm.com and look at the magician research stuff. Hehe if you are a newbie first starting out, feel lucky. When I first started the game researching was nearly impossible. Since then, however, they have made it easier (although it is still fairly hard). <br><br>Okay now back to the hunting guide. At level 16 venture to Lake rathe. Here you will find a bunch of aviak guards that are level 16-20. For their level, they aren't that hard. At level 16 you will be able to take level 20 aviaks. This is also the level when you should start grouping. Almost all the aviaks in this zone are close together, and will attack you at the same time. The only time you will want to solo when hunting them is if you are at the single aviak spawn, or at the entrance to the arena zone where you can take the two aviaks one at a time. However this isn't always possible, as they are sometimes camped, so you will have to group with another person (or two other people if you want to take the 3-spawn aviaks). Aviaks are pretty good loot dropping up to 3pp and FS (fine steel) weapons which will sell for about 5pp each at the ogre vendors in the zone (don't worry even though they are ogres they sell to everyone). The aviak guards also drop words which you can use to research some of your level 16 spells (if you didn't buy them already). <br><br>Another good spot for level 16 is the zone Lake of ill Omen, located in Kunark near west Cabilis. There are a bunch of things here that will con blue to yellow for you to kill. It is a bit more dangerous here than in Lake Rathe though. <br><br>Fighting aviak guards or creatures in the Lake of Ill Omen will get you to level 20 pretty quickly. Some people will tell you that Oasis is a good zone for this level, but I totally disagree with that. It is severely overcrowded; the loot sucks, and there are specter and sand giant trains all the time. When you get to level 20 it's time for new spells! Here is the list of spells: <br><br>Bolt of Flame - this spell does MASSIVE damage and has a VERY long range too! But be careful, it has a huge taunt rate so you will usually want to use an earth or air pet when soloing because of their root/stun spells. Also you have to have a clear line of sight for it too work. <br><br>Elemental Shield - a fairly useful buff for things that cast spells. Raises your cold and fire resistances. <br><br>Spear of Warding - summons a magical spear that has a small fire and cold resist+ tacked on to it. Not all that useful. Give it to a newbie or a rogue without a magic piercing weapon. It can also be given to pet. It can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Renew Summoning - this is a very nice upgrade to your level 8 pet-only healing spell. Use it when your pet is low in HP or if your mana is full and your pet's hp isn't full. <br><br>Summon Arrows - this spell summons a bunch of magical arrows. Give them to people that use bows and don't want to spend money making or buying arrows. Fairly useful. Can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Summon Waterstone - this summons a stone with a charge of enduring breath, which makes you able to breathe under-water. Great for when you want to go to kedge keep at higher levels, or just to keep in your inventory incase you for some reason get caught under-water. It can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Shield of Flame - an upgrade to your level 8 damage shield. Definitely use it to buff your pet before you attack something or in a group on the tanks. <br><br>Rain of Fire - an area effect spell. This is useful when your group wants to take multiple mobs and there is no enchanter around to mezz the extras. Be careful though, it will get the monsters mad at you. It is also very good for soloing, because it will hit single mobs 3 times, making it very mana efficient. <br><br>Level 20 pets - I suggest that you buy all of the pets at this level. You can't buy them all at your guild. You have to go to the merchant in OOT on one of the islands to get the rest that aren't sold at your guild. <br><br>Now the level 20 fighting place - SOUTH KARANA!!!! This zone has TONS of stuff in it. At level 20 there are many things you can do. First off is the aviak city. The aviaks here anywhere from about levels 15-30. Get a group and kill rooks that spawn on the bottom, or go up to the penthouse. Splitpaw - right outside the dungeon of split paw there are three spires and a hill. Level 24-29 gnolls spawn here. If you are able to get in a group the exp. is pretty decent. Treants, these things are pretty good exp. and VERY good loot. They are heavily camped though, so you might have to wait to get in a group. Also treants drop your faction with druids and with Qeynos, so don't kill them if you don't want to be KOS at the druid rings or in Qeynos. Centaurs, these guys can be good exp. and drop some nice items too. The best place to hunt them is near the centaur outpost. Many will wander by the outpost. You will be able to solo any that don't con red. If you get in a group with someone that can track it is even better because sometimes the pickings get slim and having someone who can easily find more make for good exp. Also, there are a couple merchants in one of the stables at the centaur outpost. Sell there. There are also shadowed men that are in the low 20&amp;#8217;s that you can kill. They make good target&amp;#8217;s for your damage spells against summoned things, but you need a group, and the loot sucks very badly. <br><br>The last thing this wonderful zone offers....the hermit. In the middle of nowhere is a level 20 ranger. He is VERY good exp. Why? because he has a 3 MINUTE SPAWN. Not only that but the loot he drops isn't bad. PLUS, sometimes he drops FS two-handed weapons which you can give to your pet to make them do 24 damage a hit. The only problem is that he sits in a hut with a door that won't open. To pull him out go near the chimney of the house, have no one targeted, and say 'kill you'. After doing that a few times he will attack you through the wall and your pet will go after him. You won't be able to use your level 20 bolt spell the first time you attack him because it won't go through the wall. use your level 16 DD that will still hit him. I HIGHLY suggest that you use a water or air pet to camp him. Why? Because since he respawns every 3 minutes, your earth pet will never be able to regen in time, only your water or air pet will be able to keep up(well the fire pet could keep up too, but you don't want to use him here, dies way too fast). After you kill him the first time you won't need to say 'kill you' anymore. As soon as he spawns again just target your pet and type /assist. Then the hermit will automatically be targeted and you can pull him out of the house using your level 16 DD, and then once he teleports out of the house you can use your level 20 DD. However, if you are using a water pet and not an air pet, try to keep him in the house, pull him with your level 16 DD and then send your pet in, and then burn with caution so he stays on your water pet and doesn&amp;#8217;t teleport out to attack you. If you are using an air pet it is fine to pull him out because the air pet will stun him and let you DD. <br><br>With everything it has to offer South Karana will be able to get you to level 30. You can easily get from level 20 to 28 just soloing the hermit. If the hermit is camped by someone else you can always do centaurs, gnolls outside of splitpaw, and aviaks. Plus once you get to level 24 you can go INSIDE spiltpaw with a group for decent exp. If you don't mind losing faction with the druids and Qeynos you can also kill treants which are a VERY good money source. Even better than the treants is the druid ring in east Karana(actually not that far away). Here there will be 3 druids (and sometimes you will get a few treants) that respawn every 3 minutes. It is WAYYYY better than the south Karana treants, but you need more people to hold it down, and its more dangerous. However, if you can get 4 casters(including you), in their mid to high 20's together, you will get AMAZING EXP. and INSANE LOOT. Of course you have to be willing to becoming KoS in Qeynos and at some of the druid rings. <br><br>Another good spot for levels 24 to 30 is the dungeon Solesk A. Get a map of the place and head to the 'frenzied' room. This spot is very nice solo exp. and loot, and there is a zone nearby if you mess up. Expect to die a couple of times though, becuase well, its a dungeon. Even if you die a few times, its still worth it. <br><br>A good spot in Kunark for level 24-30 is the forest giant mini-village located in the center of Warslick&amp;#8217;s Woods. They are pretty good exp. and the loot is decent too. If you get really lucky they will drop a forest loop, which is worth a lot of money. This spot is a bit dangerous though, and don&amp;#8217;t expect to get a forest loop soon. Be happy if you get a single one after 10 hours of fighting. <br><br>Once you get to level 29/30 you have a lot of options. Level 30 is the first 'hell' level so leveling to level 31 will take you a while. Also on the level 24 and 29 spells....buy ALL of them. Once you get to these levels simply buy ALL of your spells. You will be grouping more and more, and you never know when you might need a spell that would seem worthless to you if you were soloing. Also, most of the level 24 and 29 pet spells can't be bought and MUST be researched. You should be able to do all right without researching extra pets, but you should always try to get all of your pets. You should also have enough money by this level so that buying all of your spells won&amp;#8217;t bankrupt you. When you get to level 29 ALWAYS give your pet two weapons that you are able to summon once you get to level 29. Some very good weapons to give your pets are gnoll hide lariats. They drop off of splitpaw gnolls and are cheap to buy. The sweet thing about them is that when your pet uses them, they will start proccing stun. <br><br><br>At level 29/30 a great zone to go to is OOT. Take the boat from Freeport to BB and get off at the first stop. On this island you will find two level 25 sisters that are near the docks and 3 dwarfs, 2 of which are level 24, and one of which is level 25. These guys are extremely good exp. Until level 34/35. Hunting the dwarf couple that spawn by the rock on one of the corners of the island will get you to level 34. The two sisters by the dock(one on the dock, one next to a tree by the dock) will get you to level 35. The dwarfs will drop your faction with dawrven NPC&amp;#8217;s in BB, but not the guards. Killing the sisters will make you KOS in all of Faydark, but going to crushbone will give you back the faction you lost, if you care about it. <br><br>At level 34 a great Kunark zone is OT (Overthere). Here you will be able to fight tigers, sarnacks, rhino&amp;#8217;s, and many other things. You can manage soloing here, but getting a group would be better. There are always lots of groups that are fighting here by the FM and SF zones, and in-between these zones on the wall. The loot isn&amp;#8217;t too great, but this zone can take you to level 44. You CAN get higher than 44 here, but the exp. slows down around the low 40&amp;#8217;s. <br><br>Also at level 34 you can also start killing Cyclops&amp;#8217;s, Hill Giants, Sand Giants, Specters, and Griffins that don't con red(if they con yellow you still might not want to do it). They are all pretty good exp. and loot(especially the giants). It is really better to wait until level 39 to fight them if you are wanting to get exp, however you CAN kill them at 34. Also at level 34 you can start taking guards. They are level 30-35 in most places, with the best spot to hunt them being butcher block(the NPC&amp;#8217;s, not the guards however) and steamfont(gnome guards)and rathe mountains(troll guards). All these things can level you from level 34 to 47 or 48(except the cyc&amp;#8217;s). Overall though, a great spot for fighting these types of MOBS is Rathe mountains. This place has tons of Cyclopes&amp;#8217; and hill giants. There is also a wizard girl in this zone that you can camp, and two troll guards that are level 35. At levels 34-38 you will only be able to take one of the guards at a time. At 39-43 you will be able to take both of them, but you won&amp;#8217;t be able to totally keep up with both of the spawns. At levels 44-47 you will be able to take both troll guards and keep the spawns under control. The trolls guards and Cynthia are pretty heavily camped though, so don&amp;#8217;t expect to just be able to go there and camp them. The good thing is that if they are camped there are always plenty of hill giants to kill which are good exp. and great loot. <br><br>Once you get to the 40&amp;#8217;s the Dreadlands in Kunark is a very good spot to solo or group. Grouping is better here however, as in most Kunark zones, because lots of monsters wander around. This is a great zone and can easily take you into your low 50&amp;#8217;s. Also, if <br><br>Now something else you will be doing a lot at this level is grouping. Starting at level 24 you should start grouping. All the soloing strategies I listed above are not the only ways to go. Grouping in Upper guk, Lower guk, Solusek A and B, Splitpaw, Mistmoore, Unrest, Karnor&amp;#8217;s Castle, Kurn&amp;#8217;s Keep, City of Mist, and other dungeons can work very well sometimes. Plus, once you get to your high 40's you will want to group A LOT. As a magician your role in the group will be to dish out a lot of damage via your pets, DD spells, and damage shields. Your malise spells will also be a plus if there is no shaman or enchanter around. You should start grouping as early as possibly to learn how to fight well in a group. As I said, once to get to your high-40's, grouping will become essential. It becomes a lot harder to solo. However if you do want to solo from the mid-40's to the low 50's, Seafury Cyclops's in OOT and ice giants in everfrost would be your best bet. However I wouldn't suggest that too highly considering that the exp. won't be as good as getting in a good group. Plus, before level 49 they are hard to kill, and will take a full bar of mana. <br><br>It would be too hard for me to write a guide for every single dungeon, so I am just going to give you an overview. I highly suggest grouping in dungeons now. Verant recently not only incresed the exp. for large groups, but also increased the exp. MANY dungeons give. Plus grouping is a lot of fun and soloing outdoors can get boring. <br><br>Lower Guk I a great spot at level 34+. There is a room in this zone called the &amp;#8216;bedroom&amp;#8217;, and it is a great spot to set up a group and pull from. It is very good exp., but be weary of trains. This dungeon is definitely a death box, and you will find that surviving in a dungeon as a magician is a much harder feat to do than other classes. In addition to the &amp;#8216;bedroom&amp;#8217; there are lots of other great things to do here. There is some MEGA loot to get, especially a Robe called the Shiny Metallic Robe, which is a rare drop off the ghoul magi dude. There is also a plethora of great fighter equipment here that you can sell or give to one of your twink. Just of few things are the FBSS(a sash that gives haste); the exo axe, a nice two handed slashing weapon for a warrior; short swords of the ykkshea(the spelling is way off on that one, don&amp;#8217;t know exact spell), which are one handed slashing weapons that proc a 75 pt DD, and many other great things. <br><br>Another dungeon I have experience in is Splitpaw. This is not as good of a dungeon as many others, but it is still a decent spot to group in and get exp. starting at level 24 and continuing up into the high 30&amp;#8217;s. The only problem is that there usually aren&amp;#8217;t enough people around to start groups in the higher level parts of this zone. As for magician loot the best drop is this zone is the gnoll hide tome with gives +10 int and a few other stats, but drops your strength(although your str. dropping isn&amp;#8217;t that big of a deal). <br><br>At level 16 and up until the high 30&amp;#8217;s one of the decent dungeons on the continent of Feydwer that you can go to is Unrest. Personally, I didn&amp;#8217;t like it much because there were WAY too many trains, and it was even more of a deathbox than Lower Guk. However, you can do pretty well soloing lawn trash from 16-20, and this can be a great place to go if you get a good group. The only thing is good groups just don&amp;#8217;t spawn every 3 minutes. =:-). If you can get a nice group though, you&amp;#8217;ll have fun. There is a ton of FS weapons here that you can store in your summoned bags to sell for a lot of money. <br><br>One of my newly favoirte dungeons is Mistmoore. From level 24 until the mid 40&amp;#8217;s, you can do great here. At level 24 to 30 you can make good exp. soloing the familiars near the entrance. The only downside is that you will be making hardly any money doing this. One of the best spots in this dungeon is the gravyard. Here you can get a small group and take the whole thing. There are 5 level 24-30 things that spawn every 15 minutes here. At level 34 you can even solo the whole thing by yourself, with some difficulty. If you do want to solo it, make sure you use an earth pet. Root is essential. The best drop in the graveyard for magicians is the sacrafical dagger. It is a 5/21 weapon that gives +5 to int. It is a common drop off of one of the rare spawns in the graveyard. This is actually a pretty small dungeon. However it is a great spot. Of course all of the dungeons on Feydwer are small. Except Kedge Keep&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230; <br><br>Ah yes, Kedge Keep. This zone is completely underwater and can be quite difficult to get used to. You will defiantely want the spell that summons you a waterstone here. I have only went here a few times, but there are some things I know aobut it. First of all, don&amp;#8217;t go here if you want exp. You definitely can NOT solo here and there is almost always no one here. However, there are many great drops in this zone, so it is a great zone to raid. The best drop in this zone for the magician is the Staff of Elemenal Mastry Water. It is dropped off of the &amp;#8216;boss&amp;#8217; of the zone, Phingel Autotrops. When held your water pets will become much more power, even more so then when using the regular water focus item. I will talk about focus items in a little bit. <br><br><br>Nagafen&amp;#8217;s Lair, or Solusek B as it is called, is a very good spot once you get to level 44. I definitely wouldn&amp;#8217;t suggest going before 44 though, because if you do you will have to use your level 24 shock DD against all of the things in here. They have extremely high fire resists. There is more good fighter equipment drops in here than caster, but it is still a great spot for picking up exp. and money once you get to 44. Plus this is the only zone I know of that drops fire giants toes, which you need for your fire focus item. The only thing is that you need to get a good group that is fairly high level, since they are mildly hard. <br><br>Ah yes, focus items. Focus items are weapons that you hold. While holding them, your pets will be more powerful when you summon them. There are 4 different focus items, and each one is used when summon each kind of different pet. There is the shovel of ponz, torch of alna, broom of trilion, and stein of ullissa. Some of the spellings might be off a little bit. If you want to find out how to get these things, just check Allakhazam&amp;#8217;s quest database. It would take me too long to go through everything you have to do. It would also be stupid since they are listed on this very site. Focus items work for all levels of pets, and when used on level 34 or high pets they will make your pets look a little bigger. Also, the fire focus item is the hardest to get. Took me a while to get fire giants toes for the quest. <br><br>There are also Staff&amp;#8217;s of Elemental Mastery. These work just like focus items, but work even better. The water one is dropped off of the boss in Kedge Keep, the earth one is dropped off of Innoruk, and the air one is received from a quest in the plane of air. I have to idea where the fire one is dropped, and I am not even sure if it is in the game(yet). The water staff is the easiest to get and the earth is the hardest(I managed to get the water after several Kedge runs). <br><br>Also people, please try to HAVE FUN. Please don't do nothing but solo and/or kill stuff. Try adventuring(WITHOUT A MAP FROM THE INTERNET), roleplaying, and dueling. They add a lot to the game. It is just so exciting to be in a new place without knowing where you are, or fighting another player. <br><br>I think that just about wraps it up. <br><br>Former Player Of: <br>Zuranthium Spellcrafter&lt;Elitists&gt; - Level 50 Gnome Magician of The Tribunal Server. <br>Corpusnuntia Nimtathan&lt;Valorguard&gt; - Level 40 Erudite Necromancer of The Nameless Server. <br><br>P.S. &amp;#8211; When pasted into Word Perfect this has 7,978 words.

I have spider silks (from spiders) and a large sewing box.  I've also put some training points into tailoring.  I can't seem to find if I can start out using spider silks, or do I have to go the pelt route?  Is there a wedsite devoted to just how to begin tailoring, what is needed etc.?

	   <tr><td colspan=2>There may be some truth to that. In PvE a mage just has to keep aggro on the pet. He can chain cast pets to kill kill amazingly difficult MOBs.<br><br>However, the trick here is keeping the aggro on the pet. In PvP that doesn't work. the pally will come directly for the mage, completely ignoring the pet. If he ever gets into melee distance, the mage dies.<br><br>However, that does not mean a mage cannot successfully PK a pally. To kill the mage, he has first to find him. If the pally is not aware of the mage coming, the mage just hides in some corner and sets the pet on the pally. The pally now has two choices: killing the pet (exactly what the mage wants, keeping aggro on the pet) or search for the mage while getting beat up by the pet.<br><br>So, in a duel style situation, i do not give the mage much of a chance, in some PK situations it looks entirely different.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nindor<br>L52 Dwarven Cleric on Zebuxoruk</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2><br><br>Dear Verant (and all Mages who would like to Listen), <br><br>I have noticed a enormous lack of vision regarding the Mage class. <br>1.	Mages have no class defining abilities, and not even remotely the abilities of other classes at the same level. Yes we do have our pet, 4 types, which is nice.. But I cannot say this is class defining anymore now that Beastlords, Enchanters, Shamans, Druids, Necromancers, Wizards (well ok it is a buff), and for Beastlords it&amp;#8217;s a skill and doesn&amp;#8217;t even cost mana to cast not to mention the pet procs much like our pets with Beastlord buffs. We really are no longer &amp;#8216;special&amp;#8217; in that sense.<br>2.	When I began my Mage, I was wandering around Erudin one day and found the Casters guild. I looked up and saw &amp;#8216;Crimson Hands&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;Craft Keepers&amp;#8217; and the &amp;#8216;Gate Callers&amp;#8217;. Well I said &amp;#8220;I certainly don&amp;#8217;t think I would consider myself a &amp;#8220;Craft Keeper&amp;#8221; and I am absolutely not a &amp;#8220;Gate Caller&amp;#8221; considering the only port I get (And every other caster class for that matter) is Gate. So I proudly bounced up the stairs to the Crimson Hands.. And then promptly walked back down to go into the Gate Callers.. A question . What &amp;#8220;Gates&amp;#8221; do we have other than gate itself? For that matter shouldn&amp;#8217;t every caster class train there? <br>3.	Next, the title &amp;#8220;Elementalist&amp;#8221;.. At level 60 we can gain the title Elementalist. Turns out yes we can summon sentient pets from the various planes&amp;#8230;But we cant do any sort of damage other than fire/steel ? Enchanters can turn into our pets and gain some of the bonuses they have? And we cant? Oh yeah not till we gain enough alt xp to get those forms&amp;#8230; But I can watch a level 24 Enchanter running around as a Earth Elemental and they get some buffs associated with it?? The only thing Elemental we do is summon the pets. Any other class has more ways to manipulate elemental resists, buffs, debuffs etc than we do. We have a damage shield, and the Mala line of spells. I am not complaining about these spells specifically, they are great, BUT if we are to be &amp;#8220;Elementalists&amp;#8221; I would think we would have much more variety spanning the other elements. Maybe a Form of Stone? Form of air? No. We have to wait till post 50 for that, while druids have DD water/fire/earth (snare)/lightning by level 24. Not to mention soon after they can Levitate (a spell we have to wait till 39 to summon a ring that has levitate.. wouldn&amp;#8217;t a mage say screw the ring, I just want to levitate!) , Port, SOW, etc. Mages? At 24 we have the upgraded pet line, upgraded fire/steel attack, and we are able to finally summon 20 food /drink.. Elementalists we are not&amp;#8230; <br>4.	A bit on being a &amp;#8216;summoner&amp;#8217; :Ok. I know Verant is into the true feel of the game, have them explain to me why I am able to summon semi-intelligent, talking, magic-using elementals from the plane/zone they originated, yet I am unable to summon my damn pet from over yon hill until I am level 39? Cmon now. I can summon Full sets of Phantom Chainmail neatly placed in a nice phantom bag, but I cant summon some phantom platinum? Summon a weapon I can conceivably use? Why would I want to summon a damn staff that can cast flare? I want a staff that at least procs something useful jeez.. What stupid mage would have made these spells.? Hey lets me honest fellow mages, if we were gonna make a summon, we would be summoning huge staves that proc Shock of Spikes.. or better. I probably shouldn&amp;#8217;t even say that because Verant may give the spell to us at level 58 and make the stave Druid only. (And give the same spell to Necro&amp;#8217;s at level 11)<br>5.	I want the title of my character to become &amp;#8220;Lvl 60 Vending Machine&amp;#8221; instead of Elementalist. Whats funny, is only newbies want our summoned items, and its not like we make money handing that everpopular summon staff of warding.. That makes Plat let me tell you. Anyone at a similar level to me does not want a full set of platemail much less chainmail. Only for a corpse retrieval maybe, but that same person will usually go find a necro and throw him some cash. My favorite spell of all is the all powerful &amp;#8220;Eye of Zomm&amp;#8221; . (let the hilarity ensue). <br>6.	I think we are fine in combat mind you. Outside of that we have little purpose. I watch a beastlords pet do equal damage, a necro pet doing near the same damage, but they also have mezzes, fear, dots, heals.. We have.. heals. Wow. Now lets move our attention to our friends the Bard and the Druid. Can we all say ..holy crap. These are the classes that can do everything for everyone.. I started a bard so I could regain some of the ego I lost getting laughed at by some of my druid friends. <br>7.	The epic: I will get my epic, if Verant does nothing to make us feel wanted I will get that damn pet by attrition as poor Mages get thrown by the wayside as more and more people realize instead of riding a boat, they could be hurtling through the woods with SOW, Lev, and invis seeing new zones that we could only hope to run to . One thing Verant: Couldn&amp;#8217;t you AT LEAST given our Epic Pets a different form other than our air pet? GOD you have upgraded all the graphics on all&nbsp;&nbsp;the Mobs, and yet you still refuse to give us anything but a big air pet. If I get my epic pet and ONE newbie says &amp;#8220;Nice Air pet&amp;#8221; I will drop Mod rods all over every damn Newbie zone in Norrath.. I wont even warn the kids not to touch the red button ..I am telling you. <br>Final Note. <br>Although I love my character, I am bothered by the fact Verant doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to have any vision as to what our class should become down the road. Are we summoners? Are we Elemental Masters? Are we Gate Callers (hell yeah when our pets die we are..=) ) I feel as if I should have been given a big Top Hat at level 1 and my epic quest should be for the spell &amp;#8220;Summon Card Trick&amp;#8221; . (At first I was going to say &amp;#8220;Summon Rabbit out of Hat&amp;#8221; but as we all know having a 5th pet would overpower our class, and we all know Verant would have none of that. <br>I just want to have utility outside of combat, something class defining that will not be given to every other class.. Something that seems to fit our class billing. I have heard Verant is planning a Mage class overhaul.. I sincerely hope they take our opinions into account.. I do not want to simply summon Rods in my old age.. Even a simple Port to Plane of Sky/Growth would be nice.. It would just make sense. Please Verant find a true plan for Mages and stick to it. <br><br><br>My first and last post,<br><br>Ephedrinex Goodcorpse<br>Erollsi Marr<br>Mage of 32 sleight of hand tricks. <br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I'm sorry but you sound like a kid having a temper tantrum. <br><br>I agree that the mage class needs some work. But We are the best soloest one on one up to 50, Excluding the Druid/Wiz quad kiting. But they use a lot more mana than we do. I always managed to kill the same number of mobs they did in the amt of time they had to med. I've soloed most of the time to 55th lvl. Post 50 it gets real hard to solo and get good exp. My recomendation is to learn to group and you will find post 50 getting exp groups will be a lot easyer. Spend a lvl soloing and a lvl grouping so you keep both skills maxed.<br><br>My biggest complaint is they don't want us to solo but they don't give us a real place in a group. I'm invited on a lot of CoM raids for the Shaman epic due to my 49th fire pet. But other than that not needed on most raids. <br><br>Now if you really want to get the mage class upgraded go to the real everquest board and post an intelegent post. Instead of a rant. When you rant they are much less likly to take what you have to say into consideration.<br><br>Cilditin 55th Mage (Utopian of Povar)<br>Bedin 56th Shaman (Utopian of Povar)<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I've been reading several post on several different boards and it seems that the time has come for Verant to sit down and take time to think about where the EQ world is heading in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, many of the problems being discussed about mages have their roots in playing style: solo vrs group.  Both sides are valid methods of play; but to try and make one class fit into both catagories is more than any designer could possibly accomplish.  I think Verant needs to define the main method of play for a class as clearly as it has pure casters vrs melee fighters.  For example: Solo classes could be heavily quest based and receive little help from towns and guilds. A solo class would have no group buff spells, but could have self only buffs. <br>It is not beyond comprehension to have a solo only class; after all there are plenty of group only classes (cleric, enchanter, bard) --I know some people will say they can solo these classes but lets try and be honest; they do much better in groups. <br>Mage, Necro strike me as being a good start for a remake into the solo only class for casters.<br>Maybe Monk/Rogue for melee.<br>In closing: I think that Verant needs to recongnize soloing as a legitimate form of play and balance a few classes with that in mind. After all if group play were the only way to play then Verant would allow group accounts with discounts(Lol-- not bloody likely!)<br>I personally like to play both group and solo, but get frustrated when my solo characters at higher levels get spells and tactics which are obviously trying to shove them into a happy happy joy joy group.<br><br>Ozymandieus lvl 40(Erudian)<br>Magician<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>/ooc I'm going to agree with Verant for once, and say that the solo classes are perfectly fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem you're experiencing is twofold:<br>1) Magicians are NOT the best solo class in the game.  A magician can not solo as well as a druid or necromancer when he reaches the higher levels.  Thus, Verant has included a number of group-based spells to increase the magician's efficiency as he is occassionally forced to group for experience.<br>Here's an example: the magician epic quest involves camping Innoruuk.  You can't solo a god, no matter who you are.  Sorry.  So, why not have some group spells, if you're going to group anyway.<br>2) All the solo classes can group, the idea being if you can do it yourself, you can do it with some help.  It's just that simple.<br><br>Gallius Gatecaller<br>25th Magician of Erud<br>Bristlebane Server<br>&nbsp;<br>Gallius Gatecaller<br>Arbitrator of the High Keepers of Odus<br>"I understand, that you don't."</td></tr>

Well who needs a necro or a mage, as a matter of fact, when they can have a Enchanter and a tank instead. Face it mages you wont be wanted in groups much till 55 ( IE CoH). I like soloing , its fun, i hardly ever die, and when i do ( rarely) i cant blame anyone but myself. Also, dont be ashamed of being a Solo class , im proud of it infact i prefer it...

Besides the money, all of the higher level items you need will be GIVEN to you by higher level characters for free if you just ask them, becuase they really aren't worth much.<br><br>As for hunting Lake of Ill Omen is an alright spot, like Yen said, however there are better spots if you don't like how crowded the Lake is and how many wandering monsters there are.<br><br>South Karana: You can fight the hermit here until 28, and around 24 you can starting killing Treants and Gnolls. There are also shadowed men, aviaks, and centaurs for if all of the above are already camped. Splitpaw is also located in South Karana, so you can go into there with a group around 24 too.<br><br>Lake Rathe: You can fight aviak guards here until 24. It is right next to South Karana so you can move there when you get bored of it.<br><br>Those are two great spots for your level.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Boy, now there's a doozy of a question. The answer depends on wether you're twinked or not. If you have an alt and are just wondering what kind of equip to buy... well I'll get into that. <br><br>If not then you're equipment options are kinda limited. It's hard to get equip for mages without a little help, or some funding. There are a few cheap options, such as a few mage usable items that drop off the low level mobs in innothule and upper guk, however you're not likely to be able to get them with a low level mage. Not without help anyway.<br><br>Another option is raw silk. That you can get from tailors pretty cheaply. Most learning tailoring just end up reselling equip that low a level to vendors, so you may be able to find it there too, if you keep your eyes open.<br><br>After that there are a few neat items in the temple of Solusek Ro that you can quest for, including your mage foci (which do work at all levels and are obtainable before 34, IF you have help).<br><br>Now, if you're talking player-bought equip that's a different matter. The main things you're going to be looking for are anything you can use that has int. The more the better. However, once you get your int over 200, it becomes less important. Normally mana goes up by a multiplier based on your int and level. Over 200 int, though, it only goes up 6 mana for each int point over the limit.<br><br>After the cap look to items that add resists, mana, then of less importance, HP and other stats. Resists and mana should be your primary concern though. The rest is just gravy.<br><br>The advisor's robe you're not going to be able to improve on for a while, and like it or not folx, the stein of moggok is one of the best, most versitile items in the game. 10 int on an off hand that you can buy for like 200 pp, or quest for as a 15ish chanter. Yeesh.<br><br>The 3 int earrings are off an easy quest in the qeynos aquaducts. Was easily farming em at lvl 12.<br><br>Now some of the big &quot;must have&quot; items for mid level casters are kind of universal. Steins of moggok are a big one. As are polished bone bracers, which are 3 int, 3 wis wrists you can get off evil eyes in beholder. There are a couple other items that can be had cheaply from PC jewlers. A lot of the other common stuff you can get by trading. There are a lot of items that are pretty much impossible to get at mid levels, but are highly farmed by higher levels, so are pretty easy to buy. After you get a few hundred pp from monsters (will feel like it's taking forever, but you will) after that go SHOPPING! Finding neat new toys is one of the coolest things about this game. But if yer really looking for the kind of stuff other people of your level have, inspect em!<br><br>Up at the higher levels... well... if you have the drive to reach that far, you'll find out for yourself. =)<br><br>Good luck.<br><br>Faelawen Starfyre, the Mad Mage of Povar<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>If you are fighting a ranger, that probably means you are going to get hit quickly. Because of this, you should cast a damage shield on yourself right before you start the duel. With the damage he is taking from your shield, the damage from your pet, and damage from your direct damage spells, you should be able to kill him before he kills you. Then again, with how twinked everyone is these days that probably won't work. Casters are almost totally useless in the low levels now since you can gave a warrior character a massively powerful weapon and armor at level 1; while casters are always restricted to what spells they can cast by their level.<br><br>Snare is hard to deal with by itself. My dueling tactics as a mage were to use an earth or air pet to slow the enemy down, while I ran around them in confusions patterns and let me pet beat on them to death. If I was using earth and they got rooted, then I would run far away and start using bolt spells. <br><br>Using bolt spells and kiting are some of the best things magicians can do to win duels. Snare really makes those tactics less effective. <br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>1) Mages sort of suck PvP at 12.&nbsp;&nbsp;They get no new direct damage spells and so are still using the lvl 8 spells that hit for 31 and 41.  At 16 they rule once again though.<br><br>2) Earth pets are ok, I almost exclusively use air pets anymore (strictly for PvP) because the stun works nicely against melees and casters.  But your reasoning here is sound, earth pet against ranger is a good idea if you ask me.  The problem is that pet spells seem to get resisted quite a bit more than our spells do.  Plus I don't think the pet root lasts very long.<br><br>3) Run like a madman!  I don't mean running away, I mean don't let him get close enough to melee you.  He is not an NPC and therefore you CAN lose him or at least put some distance between yourselves so that he can't smash you to bits.  Of course Rangers get snare at 9 which really makes that kind of crappy.  But normally you can run around enough to at least get space to get one spell off.  Run up and down hills, bugs in the game make it look like you keep running straight when you may have actually turned.  Toggle F9 so you can see where he is and how close he is.<br><br>Well those are some basic things I can think of.  That might help.<br><br>-Yizz<br><br>Edit:  Forgot to mention this.  Rain of Blades is not the spell to use in that situation.  Stick with the DDs you got at 8.  RoB will suck all your mana quick and you're most likely not going to get all three waves off on your opponent.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Dec 14 02:47:00 2001</em><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
