	   <tr><td colspan=2>Some of the best hunting I've found for post 40 hell levels is on this "new" continent.  (Still call it the new continent, and the others the "Older World"...)  :)<br><br>I know where I've been hunting, and want to get a feel of where others are hunting.  Here's a list of some of the better places I've found.<br><br>1) Frountier Mountains:  Thoe whole zone is chock full of medium - to - low blues and can be worked pretty fast.   I like hanging out near the Burning Woods zone, though, since the higher cons tend to be around this area.<br><br>2) Burning Woods:  Just inside the zone from Frountier Mountains.  Lots of higher to mid ranged blues, with even some whites, yellows and reds in range if you so desire them.  (Probably a good idea to hunt this with a partner, though.)<br><br>3) The Overthere:  Most of the mobs here are starting to go green now, and the loot is pathetic, but you can still pick up a little bit of exp here.<br><br>4) The Mines of Nurga: Probably the least used, and most neglected dungeon on the game.  Many times I've been the only one in this zone.  Some of the great hunting spots are right inside the zone, up the right hand waterfall, there are 2 spawn points, and the other location is back in where all the spiders start up, there are 2 sets of spider spawns, with 2 in each loaction that can be split pretty well...  (This is about right to med up between the splits, if you are carefull, adn work the spiders methodically)<br><br>5)The Dreadlands: North Wall.  Just watch out for the dragon that wanders around here.  If you have killed any wurms in Burning Woods you are KOS to this one.<br><br>6) The Temple of Droga: Several spots in here are fun/exciting, even though there are a few greens mixed in.  (This will also take a group to go back in very far.)  The loot here can be either poor, or very good, depending on if you can find the "drop" mobs.  (Shroud of Nature's a pretty good drop, but it's a long camp, I understand, and can be overwhelming to someone soloing)<br><br>These are just a few of the places in Kunark that I have hunted since 40.  I just dinged 46 last night, so I'm not sure if the cons have changed on any of these, though.  <br><br>Let's here from the rest of you about where you are hunting, and how things in those places are going.  Might give the rest of us some ideas, too...  :)<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Elrique Melnebone<br>Elementalist of Blood and Honor<br>Master Vending Machine<br>Veeshan</td></tr>

DONT cast on the mob. Send in pet, make sure its buffed. Let pet solo mob till its down to around 30% health. Then type in /pet get lost (make sure you are close enough for pet to accept messages).  then start casting to summon a new pet, when the spell is 1/4 of a bub from going off, hit enter. Pet suicides, 1 second later new one appears. THIS IS WHY YOU DONT CAST ON MOB. when The first pet dies, his aggro is wiped from the mob making you the target. BUT. if you dont cast on mob, he hits you once, pet jumps in , start over, Works very nicely.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>This is fairly common and since lots of stuff tend to get stated over again, it isnt necessarily to bring this back up.  I am a lvl 51 High Elf Mage and will be working on a guide for this board as well but wont recommend it to the inexperienced player.  I use the tactic listed here even at 51 against just bout everything just because I dont hunt for xp.....I just come across stuff to kill to keep my pet busy.  =)  As far as downtime, it is non-existent.  I summon a pet and buff and send it ina nd sit there meddin while assistin back and forth between MoB and Pet......if Pet is doin fine I continue sitting but if the pet is losing I stand up...let the pet get to 20H and start castin another pet.....while the spell is castin I start typin /pet get lost....and the just a sec before the spell goes off I hit Enter.  Bout the time the one pet poofs another is beside me which I buff.  And since I am not patient and am not about to wait for my pet to regain all those HP (Earth Pet) if he is low, I kill him and summon another.  <br><br>Now the reason I choose this tactic is because I run a guild and enjoy the social aspects of the game more than the gain xp  gain xp  gain xp.....so while the pet is fightin, I am talkin!<br><br>And I gain just as much xp as someone who has to sit there and med bec they blasted the crap out of the last MoB and their pet finished the fight with 90H while their mana bar dropped to 40M.<br><br>Just some thoughts...<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>"I am a 45 mage, Yellow cons are though, even with a pet that has about 3000 hp."<br><br>This is called BS. At level 45 no pet, not even the earth pet, has anywhere 3k hp. The level 49 earth pet is the only pet with 3k hp. This strategy is also not very good becuase if you don't outdamage your pet they get half of the exp. from the kill. It is better to take low blues that can be killed quickly giving very low downtime. This is also called the pet recasting trick which has already been written by someone on this forum.<br><br>At 45 spectors and the shadowknight/shaman in rathe mountains are good choices. A level 45 magician can also take seafuries at this level, but they aren't as good of exp. as the spectors or duel troll spawns in Rathe Mountains.<br><br>If you like grouping I suggest lower guk or solusek B(nagafen's lair). Kedge Keep is also a great place, especially if you are going to fight the 'boss' of the zone(forget name). He drops the level 49 Elemental Staff of Mastry: Water. Of all these Guk is my favorite.<br><br>I hear that there are also a TON of great spots in Kunark, however I don't have Kunark (video card not good enough).<br><br>Happy Hunting.<br><br>Zuranthium/Divineshadow/Corpusnuntia/Sunsong/Naltec/Natalos/Plantmaster<br><br>Player of many characters on the Nameless.<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hail and G'Day all!<br><br>I was a bit leary to post any sort of guide here, after looking at some of the flames other posters have received for their comments/guides, but what the heck...  No one knows it all, and my ideas might spark someone else's creativity.<br><br>Breaking this into 3 seperate parts, starting out, soloing and grouping, since there are differing tactics for each type of hunting.<br><br>Starting out:<br><br>    Intellegence is directly proportional to mana.  The higher your int, the more mana you have per level, until you hit 200 int.  Then, it's time to start swapping int items for better and throwing in some mana items or other stat buffing items.  This being said, I would recommend anyone starting a Magi to dump as many points as racially possible into Intellegence and then split what few remain across the other stats as you see fit.  (Other stats can be raised via items as you gain in levels...   Remember, out of mana=dead!)<br><br>    That said, the next important thing is mana conservation.  If you don't learn it early, you are going to get frustrated and quit, or never reach the potential that you COULD reach by learning this.<br><br>Solo:<br><br>For starting levels, there really isn't much that can be taught...  From 1-4 you are petless, and having to rely on melee and a couple of casts to kill those mobs.  After that, here are some tricks:<br><br>&lt;li&gt;1) If you are pulling to the pet, in an outdoor situation, where you are controlling what you fight and when you fight it, always put your pet on guard.  He always turns to the nearest mob, and can be used as a proximity detector.<br><br>&lt;li&gt;2) Pet control.  Always know where your pet is.  If you haven't parked him someplace, then he should be right on your tail, if he's not, you are going to be in trouble, sooner or later.<br><br>&lt;li&gt;3) When the money starts to flow in a bit, start carrying more than a few Reagents at a time.  You can then setup shop in your hunting grounds, Summon a pet, and then sic him on a green to see the damage he does.  If it's not the highest, or the pet cons green, etc...  Resummon.  (This can take SEVERAL resummons)  Always use Reclaim on the pets you are getting rid of in this way, or you will be OOM in just a few tries.<br><br>&lt;li&gt;4) Pets and healing.  We have 2 heal spells aimed at pets.  One at 8th level and another at 20th level.  If your pet is taking a lot of damage, you need to learn when it's time to cut and run, or time to get off that last quick heal, or time to nuke the mob.  This takes practice and experience, so keep trying.  Remember, your pet is your only friend while soloing.  He's the only thing you have to count on, so keep him healthy, and he'll keep you healthy.  Kill him off, and you're dead!  <br><br>&lt;li&gt;5) If the pull or pet has gotten away from you, count on either zoning or dying.  There is no middle ground.  He will be back, and with a lot of friends.  If your pet doesn't come back, that means there are some majorly upset mobs out there, with your name on their tongues...  <br><br>&lt;li&gt;6) Always, always, always put a damage shield on your pet before you go out looking, unless it's a Fire pet.  (Remember this is unresisted damage!)  Then, when you get back, you don't have to remember to do it, and you can concentrate on killing the mob.<br><br>&lt;li&gt;6) Burnout series.  Man, it's so surprising to me the Magi out there that have no clue how this spell series works.  What is a good pet without the Burnout series is truely an AWESOME pet with it...  If you aren' using it, quit playing the class and try something else, cuz you are wasting your time.<br><br>Grouping:<br><br>&lt;li&gt;1) Unresistable Damage:  Magi's have the best Damage Shields in the game with our Flame Sheilds.  When the puller says "inc" it's time to start laying these on the tanks and your pet. (assuming not a Fire pet)  The damage might SEEM small, but at 20 points a pop for a 45th level Magi, and assuming the tank gets hit 5 times a tic, that's 100 points of damage that someone doesn't have to do any other way...  :)<br><br>&lt;li&gt;2) Maximizing Damage:  The Malise line of spells are probably the least used of all the debuffing spells int he game, yet are probably some of the better spells we Magi could ever hope for.  How many of us have seen that mob down to the last sliver of health, and you're burning your last sliver of mana, and the pet's almost gone, to see the fatal line "a Mobxx has resisted your xyz spell"  <br><br>When I'm pulling, I use Malise/Malisement.  Not only does it affect my spell success rates, but also the pet's spells...  And any other caster in your group will apreciate seeing that line "Elrique says to the group 'Malise'"<br><br>&lt;li&gt;3) Mana control:  Some of the Magi's I've played with are Nuke, Nuke, Nuke, Oom...  Now either the rest of the group is carrying the Magi, with a little help from his pet, or, they are waiting for him to get some reserves back up and not maximizing their time killing mobs.  Learn when to over burn, and when to sit and med through a fight.<br><br>&lt;li&gt;4) Pets and Healing.  I have gotten into the habit of giving mana reports and pet health reports at the same time...  Mine are like 60, pet 100.  Just a good practice to get into, since that way everyone in the group has a better picture of overall group health.  (That one big pull one time the pet's going to be at 20 when the inc comes, and bingo!  Dead group, cuz you didn't have the time needed to trim the odds down with a FOH pet.)<br><br>&lt;li&gt;5) Assisting:  Always, always, always assist the designated player...  (Making an /Assist so-and-so key for this is a great idea.)  If your pet is getting hit from another source and continuously reagros on that source, it's time to let the designated assist know which mob and that's the next one on his list.  (Tanks might want to make an /Assist pet key so they can get onto the pet's target quicker, too...)<br><br>Many of these things are "Common Sense" but it is SO surprising how many higher level Magis I see running around not doing these things.  (Actually, it's almost frightening when I'm grouped with one of them!)  :(  Just a little bit of time to learn and practice some of these skills are going to be well worth your time and effort in the long run, and will make you a better player as well...  Yeah, you might not be soloing to 50 in 3 weeks or less,  you WILL be enjoying the time you are in perhaps a bit more by knowing you are a valued part of a group, and doing something together that none of you could do seperately.<br><br>Elrique Melnebone<br>Magi of the 11th Spell Circle<br>Veeshan<br>&nbsp;<br>Elrique Melnebone<br>Elementalist of Blood and Honor<br>Master Vending Machine<br>Veeshan</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hail all,<br><br>Many mages i've heard always mention that mages DO NOT FIGHT with their melee skills.<br><br>This is a shame as there are quite some benefits if you train your fight skills.<br><br>POSSIBLE SPOILER FOR YOU SO DO NOT READ ON IF NOT INTERESTED IN HARD FACTS OF SKILLS.<br><br>Tips<br>----<br>1) Start training these skills early on as melee skills only improve against monsters that are at least BLUE.<br>2) It generally takes me up to 2 bubs of experience while soloing to get all my fighting skills maxxed for my current level. Of course this means i was maxed beforehand.<br>In a group that allows me to melee from time to time, it takes me up to 4 bubs to get them maxxed.<br>3) They are hard to train if not started early, but will allow you to protect your pet. Use your Phantom shield(s) after lvl 16.<br>4) You will die a bit more in the short long while training them, but will die less later on. <br>5) I tend to get more skill gains in less occupied zones on average. I might be wrong but it sure has panned out for me that way.<br><br>Effects of Fighting skills<br>--------------------------<br>Dodge<br>--&gt; Lets you dodge from time to time.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hi all,<br><br>I have read quite a few bits about which pet is the best, and it seems to me, that there is generally a tendency to go from earth pet (low lvl) to air pet (high lvl). Personally (lvl 14 now) I never could befriend myself with earth pets, they are too much punching balls, i used water most of the time<br><br>Now my question to you: which type did or do you use around lvl 16<br>- when soloing outdoor<br>- when soloing indoor<br>- when grouping outdoor<br>- when grouping indoor<br>?<br><br>A short explanation would be fine<br><br>Thx for your reply<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Forenote:<br>---------<br>I will not go into details of the strengths, weakness of the different types of elementals.<br><br>The suggestions of elements focus on the majority of huntingl, i.e. blues to yellows.<br><br>This document is valid for elementals of lvl 19-33 of which i know something about.<br>Lvl 34+ is a slightly different ballgame especially as the majority of hunting is either grouping or blue-hunting while soloing. Any additions by higher level players would be welcome here.<br><br>You can solo with each elemental and each one has their advantage. Your success lies in learning how to accomodate your pets strengths and weaknesses as well as your playstyle (camp, explore and hunt, try new things, etc.).<br><br>For soloing ask yourself the following questions:<br>A) Do you cast a lot of damaging spells as quickly as possible?<br>B) Do you cast some damage spells, but time them so you don't overaggro the opponent?<br>c) Are you hunting in an area you can not run or flee (i.e small island, dungeon, many monsters that will attack close by, etc.)?<br>d) Are the monsters you're fighting very aggressive (i.e. generally humanoids are more aggressive than animals)?<br>e) Are the monsters you are fighting poisonous?<br>f) Are the monsters you are fighting casters?<br>g) Are the monsters you are fighting blues, whites or yellows?<br>h) Are the monsters you are fighting less protected against fire?<br><br>EARTH<br>-----<br>A) Yes.<br>B) No.<br>c) + d) You tend more to Yes.<br>e) No.<br>f) not relevant.<br>g) mainly blues and whites.<br>h) not relevant.<br>These answers show that you aggro the monster very heavily and thus the monster will be completely fixated on you. The regen of the pet is quite slow and tends to increase my meditation times.<br>The 'Rooting' allows you more safety and different techniques in Kiting.<br><br>WATER<br>-----<br>A) No.<br>B) Yes.<br>c) + d) You tend more to No.<br>e) Yes.<br>f) not relevant<br>g) not relevant (i.e. blue, whites and yellows)<br>h) not relevant<br>These ansers show that you carefully cast your spells and don't aggro the monsters much. The monster will be generally fixated on your Water pet. The regen of the pet is awesome and tends to lessen your downtime.<br>This teaches you a valuable lesson of how to hunt with non-Rooting monster. This is something you will be doing more often as you advance into the higher levels.<br><br>AIR<br>---<br>A) No.<br>B) Yes.<br>c) + d) You tend more to No.<br>e) No.<br>f) Yes.<br>g) mainly blues.<br>h) not relevant.<br>The Stun effect is very useful against casters, however the Air elemental is not really made for Soloing up to lvl 33.<br><br>Fire<br>----<br>A) No.<br>B) Yes.<br>c) + d) You tend more to No.<br>e) No.<br>f) No.<br>g) mainly blues.<br>h) Yes.<br>The Fire elemental is only useful for soloing against monsters with low fire protection. They become much more useful for soloing after 34.<br><br>My hunting<br>----------<br>I have been mainly using the Water pet for soloing purposes from lvl 12 up to my current lvl and have done quite well with it as soon as i learned not to overaggro.<br>I personally think it has improved my hunting in groups as well. The only time i get aggroed nowadays is when a monster gets created closest to me or when i actively perform it to pull a monster of a group member.<br>The Water seems to give me less downtime as i melee in between with Phantom shield leather on, thus protecting my pet and improving his already awesome regen even more.<br><br>Finally enjoy the game while you can as leveling for leveling sake takes quite a bit out of the game (at least for me).<br><br>Disclaimers<br>-----------<br><br>Most of this document is based on experiences i've personally had and through many of the tales / insights i've seen on other boards or in the game.<br>&nbsp;<br>SlyFox, mage</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Here is my next installment to these boards, from yours truly, Zuranthium.<br><br>CAUTION, IF YOU DON'T LIKE TO KNOW THE INNER WORKINGS OF EVERQUEST THEN DON'T READ THIS. YOU MAY COME OUT KNOWING SOME THINGS YOU DIDN'T WANT TO. DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU.<br><br>This post will tell exactly how exp. in everquest works. Lets start out with the leveling formula.<br><br>The exp. needed to gain a level is: level * level * level * race * class * level multiplier<br><br>Here are the values for the races:<br><br>Troll:120, Iksar:120, Ogre:115, Barbarian:105, Wood Elf:100, High Elf:100, Erudite:100, Gnome:100, Half Elf:100, Dark Elf:100, Dwarf:100, Human:100, Halfling:95 .<br><br>Sorry guys, humans don't level faster than all the other races, contrary to popular belief. Halflings do by a minor amount.<br><br>Now here are the values for the classes:<br><br>Ranger:14, Shadowknight:14, Paladin:14, Bard:14, Monk:12, Enchanter:11, Necromancer:11, Magician:11, Wizard:11, Cleric:10, Shaman:10, Druid:10, Rogue:9.05, Warrior:9 .<br><br>As it turns out the hybirds(yes, bards...) take longer to level than the other classes. Warriors and rogues take the least exp. to level.<br><br>Finally, the last number to the formula, here are the level multipliers:<br><br>Levels 1-29: 1.0 , Levels 30-34: 1.1, Levels 35-39: 1.2, Levels 40-44: 1.3, Levels 45-49: 1.4 .....once you get to level 50 almost every level is a hell level and the multiplier steadily rises.<br><br>The 'hell' levels are caused by the sudden change in exp. needed to level at the first level of the level multiplier changes( ie 30, 35, 40, etc.).<br><br>So, lets have an example. We will use a Human Cleric.<br><br>At level 1 the cleric starts with no exp. and needs a total of 1 * 1 * 1 * 100 * 10 * 1 exp. to level, for a total of 1000 exp. and a difference of 1000 exp.<br><br>At level the the cleric starts with 1000 exp. he gained from level 1 and now needs 2 * 2 * 2 * 100 * 10 * 1 exp. to level, for a total of 8000 exp., and a difference of 7000 exp.<br><br>Now lets jump ahead some. At level 10 the cleric starts the level with 729,000 exp. from level 9 ( 9 * 9 * 9 * 100 * 10 * 1). At level 10 the cleric will need a total of 10 * 10 * 10 * 100 * 10 * 1 exp. to level....or 1,000,000 exp. Since he had already gained 729,000 exp. from previous levels, he needs to gain 271,000 exp. to get to level 11 ( 1,000,000 - 729,000 = 271,000 ).<br><br>At it contiues like this for a while until level 30, the first hell level. At level 29 the cleric needed to gain 2,437,000 exp. to level. Now at level 30 they need 30 * 30 * 30 * 100 * 10* 1.1 exp. to level...for a total of 29,700,000 exp. Since they already made 24,383,000 exp. from previous levels (29 * 29 * 29 * 100 * 10 * 1 = 24,389,000), they need to gain 5,317,000 exp. to level ( 29,700,000 - 24,383,000 = 5,317,000).<br><br>Now we will move on to how much exp. the creatures of the game give per kill. Every creature in the game gives level * level * type, of exp. per kill.<br><br>There are many type of creatures in the game....the type multiplier ranges anywhere from 75 to 110. There are 4 major types of creatures:<br><br>Newbie(levels 1-4): 100-110, Low(levels 5-6): 100, Outdoors(levels 7+): 75, Dungeon(any levels): 80.<br><br>If the mob casts or is overly powerful for its level, or is magical, then the type multiplier of that creature usually goes up some. So, the average level 1 mob gives 1 * 1 * 100 exp. per kill, for a total of 100 exp. That level 1 cleric would need to kill 10 level one things to advance to level 2. Knowing that, you can now calculate how many kills you need to level, or about how much exp. you would be able to earn over a period of time(3 hours for example).<br><br>Calculation group exp. isn't that hard. When in a group, the exp. for every kill is divided evenly between the the group members. There is no extra group exp. bonus. If anyone in the group is too low for the group, they will still be taking a share of exp. away from the group, however they will not gain it. If a group has a wide range of levels, but they are still all within the grouping level limit, a few odd things can occur. First of all if someone in the group kills something that cons blue to them, but green to another person int he group, they will have to share the exp. with the person(people) that conned it green, even though that higher level person won't get exp. for the kill. It will simply be wasted. <br><br>At higher levels green cons will still give exp. If they are one level green then they will give half the exp. that they normally would upon being killed. If they are two levels green they will give one quarter the exp. that they normally would. Anything that is 3 levels green or lower won't give any exp.<br><br>One of the last things is pets. While in groups pets will take absolutely NO exp. away from the group. No matter how many of them there are, they simply won't take any exp. away from the group.<br><br>In soloing situations it is a bit different. When soloing, the pet will take half of the exp. away from every kill IF they outdamage their master. If the person who is using the pet outdamages the pet with their spells, then the pet will take NO exp. away from the kill. That is why it is always very important to outdamage your pet if you are soloing. If you don't then you will lose a bunch of exp. that isn't going anywhere.<br><br>I think that about wraps it up. If you have any questions e-mail me at tim_gerber@yahoo.com , or just do a RE to this post. Hope you enjoyed it. use the information wisely.<br><br>Corpusnuntia/Divineshadow/Zuranthium/Plantmaster/naltec/Natalos/Sunsong<br><br>Player of many characters on the Nameless server.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I am a level 30 Druid and I still melee.  Don't get me wrong.  I don't melee like the melee classes do.  There is absolutely no way that casters/healers can melee from the beginning of a fight at these levels.  But, when soloing, I still melee to end a fight.  My meleeing is to do secondary damage to my target.  The main reason for stopping to fight is to give my DOTs time to do full damage, and my damage shield to wittle down the MOBs HPs.<br><br>I begin my fight by snaring.  Then I begin DD kiting until the MOB is down to about 1/3 of its HPs.  Then I DS myself, and,  then, DOT the MOB.  I stand there allowing the MOB to close on me and begin meleeing.  I get absolutely pulverized by the MOB, but my DOTs and DS are at work.  Soon, the MOB either turns to run, but is snared, or it does some extra damage on me and finally dies.  If the MOB turns to run I continue meleeing.<br><br>If I am lucky, the MOB only knocks off about 1/3 to half my HPs.  Usually my HP are down to around 33% to 25%.  This is what TREE FORM is for.  Turn into a tree and your HP will regenerate at about the same pace as your mana as you med.  Your mana and HP are maxed at about the same time.  Repeat the entire process.<br><br>Yes, Druids can melee.  Do not fool yourself though.  You WILL die if you try meleeing from the beginning of a fight.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Actually, the formula is a lil more advanced than stated.  They all get an equal share based on their level....it would not be 25% each for 3 lvl 30's and a lvl 28......instead the xp would be divided as to advance each member equally thru his/her lvl. It would most prob look more along the line of the 3 30's getting 26% and the lvl 28 gettin 22%.  This is not a calculation.....just stating how it works.  The lvl 28 would be advancing at an equal pace as the lvl  30 members....  Now of course the lvl 28 is going to level first and be well into 29 before the level 30's level but that is just because the 3 lvl 30 characters are in HELL!!!!<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Of the two, gossimer seems to be a bit better (higher AC vs. weight), and is a very attractive white color- very scarce.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well, here is my 2cps worth. I worked up my tailoring skills to make raw silk. It works fine. :) Im lvl 20 now tho, and I do like to fight, despite the severe combat limitations of this class. I kept advancing my tailoring skill and am now making cured silk. Cured silk is excellent mid level armor, with AC of 5 pretty much across the board. Now, what to do with it? Well, there are a lot of casters out there. And there are a lot of newbies. I sell cured silk off for about 1pp per piece of clothes, and gold for about 5gp per piece of clothes, only to offset the cost and time. (ie, brewing heady kiolas for cured and hunting spiderwebs for raw and cured). What else do I use my money for? Well, my advice - Move to freeport and start working on that blacksmith skill. I am currently about lvl 115 in blacksmithing, and am almost ready to attempt the apex of armor - the new elven chain mail line. This stuff is hard to make and expensive if you fail, so you should only try it if you are a master blacksmith. However, the stats on this @#%^ is amazing. Its also magical, so it has properties Im not sure of. Only downside is it is class specific. If you are a HE for example, you can only forge HE armor at a forge in Felwithe, etc. still. this @#%^ SELLS ITSELF :) What mage wouldnt want a nice AC9 piece of armor? from what I heard, it isnt even all that heavy. I mean collectively Im sure it can be, but hell, just get st increasing items. :) <br><br>This wonderful website has all sorts of guides about how to be a blacksmith.. it takes a long time to learn and it is expensive, but if you move to freeport and hunt in lavastorm a lot, you will be able to not only make and sell the best possible magical armor for your race, but you will be able to make all sorts of cool armor for other races that can significantly increase your number of friends and your cash influx. :) <br><br>Nahualli<br><br>Elemental Master of the 20th Summon<br>Tarrew Marr<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Okay I would like to point out that this last post made me sound like a moron.. I am revising it now. <br><br>First of all, my apologies.. I had posted this as a hypothetical situation, but when I actually put into practice, it was much different. First of all, I went ahead and bought a LOT of Kiola Sap (available at most bars, its a POUCH dont look for anything in a BOTTLE, a lot of empty bottles and a lot of water. I sat my ass in front of that brew barrel and swore I was going to make Heady Kiolas. I didnt realize that you shouldnt attempt HKs anytime before lvl 28. Oh well.. trial and error, and I am now lvl 25 in brewing, and I had a whole @#%^load of heady kiolas. By the way, if you fail at a HK, you lose the water and sap, you keep the bottle. <br><br>Then I started to work on the cured silk. Successfully made a gorget and sandals on my first try, then failed for about 20 more tries. It got kinda expensive and I ran out of spider silks. I headed out to EC to try to find more silks, and tried to wear the cured silk. heh heh heh. I then realized its MONK ONLY. I thought well Ill be damned. I turned to the zone and announced that any noob that tagged me first at the FP gates would get a cured silk gorget and sandals for free. NO ONE answered. I thought fine, Ill sell it to a vendor. I sold the gorget off for 5 golds, but held on to the sandals... I dont like selling stuff back that someone else can use... and I announced again. This dude, lvl 26 monk walks up and pokes me. I say "noobs only sorry" he says "Oh I want to buy them off you for 20 plats". Im thinking @#%^! so he bought them off me. 20 plats! I was floored. Having found some more silk, I proceeded to make a cured silk Gi, the tunic/robe thingy. first off the AC on it is 8, but the weight is negligible. It is also a MONK ONLY item. I EFFORTLESSLY sold it off for 35pp. Sold a cloak and pants off for another 40pp. So.. in ONE DAY, with stuff I was ready to give away and even destroy, I made 95 plats! Now, this is no gold mine, and it wont buy you no totemic armor, but hey, if I invest some serious concentration into this, I can rake in several hundred plats per day! You are only limited, with cured silk... by the number of monks that are being played. :) Remember, both human and Iksar can play monks... the only bad part is that iksar monks have an incredibly hard life... by the time they make it to Freeport, they more often than not have decent gear already. Something to be said about promoting monkhood. :) LOL<br><br>Nahualli <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I wanted to share what was a very effective strategy with all of you.<br><br>I play a druid and I managed to get into a basment group in Unrest the other night. Sharing my group were two tanks, another druid, a cleric (were we lucky or what?) and a magician. Our levels ranged from 29 to 33. <br><br>Upon breaking the initial full basement spawn, we set down to pull individual MoBs as they showed up. Our magician summoned an Air Pet and armed it with twin Gnoll-Hide Lariats. As any of you familiar with the basement in Unrest know, Festering Hags are probably the worst of what spawns there- not many HP, but they have a very nasty Force Shock spell that I think does upward of 300 points damage. Well, our magician's pet took care of that- you know that air pets cast stun which interrupts both attacks AND spells. Add to the pet's spell the twin stun procs of the 2 gnoll hide lariats, and the Hag's never got a spell off! It made fignting them, if not a pleasure, at least tolerable. The lariat's price has dropped to around 5pp each now, so they are pretty cost-effective (unless you have a tendency to lose pets alot- then could get a bit costly).<br><br>I implore all of you magicians out there to carefully consider your choice of pet when in a group. If your group is to face a caster, do them a favor and summon an Air pet to reduce the number of spells you'll have to absorb.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>   The only problem I find with dungeons is that by them time you get to the dungeon and form a group(which can drain a lot of time), you could have been soloing and making a lot of exp. The other thing I find is that it is hard to find players that REALLY know how to play their class. So in a dungeon, you will likely be stuck with some people that will not do things for the best of the group and cause trains, pull while the group is hurt, not assist the people that need to be assisted, break mezzes, etc. Until the mid 30's, when soloing exp. starts to slow down for the 'soloing classes', it is my general opinion that you would be much better off soloing. I would say that 95% of the time you wouldn't be able to find a dungeon group that would give more exp. or better loot(since you have to slpit it between multiple people), then if you were to solo.<br>  This is only dungeon groups though. Outdoor groups that want to take multiple spawns or camps can definately give you better exp. than soloing. However, in deungeons there is a lot more risk and it is a lot easier for people to mess up, hence you will die and your exp. gain will be cut down significantly.<br>  However, once you get to higher levels you won't have as much problems. If the person was good enough to get to level 40 then they probably know how to play their class. There will be less fools becuase the players will be much more expirienced. Also, I would have to say that you DEFINATELY want to get into groups in the mid 40's. IMO, that is when soloing exp. becomes horrible and dungeon/outdoor group play becomes necessary. I am not saying the soloing classes can't solo at those levels, I am just saying it is a lot harder. At level 10 a magician could take a low red con. At level 50 a magician would be hard-pressed to do a white. Plus there is a lot more downtime at higher levels if soloing.<br><br>Good post Adiemus, i definately agree with your point on using air pets against casters (heck, in a dungeon an air pet would all-around be the best choice anyway...hehe they are my favorite too).<br><br>Zuranthium/Corpusnuntia/Divineshadow/Naltec/Natalos/Sunsong/Plantmaster<br><br>Player of many characters on the Nameless server.<br><br>P.S. - If you haven't read the Harry Potter books I suggest you do. It has nothing to do with this topic, but I had to tell you. Many people won't read them becuase they think they are childish. However, after reading the series I can definately say you need to read them. Even if your an adult; many of my former teachers have read them and loved them.<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Thanks for the kind words Zuranthium...muchly appreciated.<br><br>I guess I am just a social animal- I prefer grouping to soloing, with the reservation here that I group with intellegent players who know their roles. This is especially true in places like Unrest and Mistmoor., but a general rule anywhere. If I want to die, I can certainly arrange to do that thru my own stupidity, rather than rely on that of others, y'know?<br><br>The relative merits of soloing vs. grouping have been debated at great length, and I think you'd be hard-pressed to change anyone's mind whatever you say. I take the stance that, grouped, you can take on many more mobs with less downtime PROVIDED all folks work together and don't waste mana/hit points. Yes, xp is divided among however many in the group, but if you can take on 6 mobs in the same time that you could take one solo (assuming here that the spawns can support such), the xp is roughly equal and the loot probably as good or possibly even a bit better.<br><br>Of course, if you happen to be unfortunate enough to group with a bunch of morons, then all the above obviously does not apply...<br><br>I will concede the point you raised about time wasted looking for groups that you could spend soloing. many is the time that I have camped a character in sheer frustration after spending half an hour shouting LFG! LFG! to no avail. In times like that, thank goodness I have a druid or magician to fall back on to solo a bit so I can do something constructive.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I totally fogot about a GREAT place to hunt in my huge guide. Sister Island! I'll tell ya whats good about it:<br><br>At level 10 a magician not wanting to hunt wisps can come here. You get to sister island by taking the boat from freeport to butcherblock. The first stop(only one really) that the boat makes is sister island. If you are a dark elf magician you will have to jump off the boat before it docks, becuase there is a level 25 sister right on the dock that will whack you if you get off the boat.<br><br>There are level 7-13 sisters roaming all over the island. A level 10 magician can beat the level 13 ones. They run very fast, so you will want to have your pet guard at the shore than then pull at maximum distance with your shock spell, and then run back to the pet and kill the sister. The loot is VERY good for this level. They drop rusty halberds that can be given to your pet to make them do 20 damage a hit, or they can be sold for 3 gold to a merchant. The sister also drop purity belts almost every time. They can be sold to a vendor for a little over a PP. The danger of this is that the sisters help eahc other out, and there is a level 15/16 pirate wandering around that will kick your butt if your low on mana.<br><br>You will be able to get to level 16 killing sisters if you don't feel like hunting wisps or going to the 2x siren spawn that is also in the zone. Sisters a little more risky than the other two options, but if you feel like danger, go for it.<br><br>Sister Island doesn't have anything to offer a magician from levels 16-21, so you won't won't to come here then. At level 22 you can come back and start hunting bigger sisters. Near the shore by the dock there is a level 22-24 sister named Antime. A level 22 magician can camp her and get to level 24(although the hermit in south karana gives better exp.). Once you get to 24 on her you can start killing dwarves, or other sisters. There is one sister standing on the dock and another standing by a tree that is by the dock.  You can camp these girls from level 24 all the way to level 36. At level 36 they will con green, however, so the exp. will become bad. Be sure to pull they away from each other, and to the shore, becuase they WILL assist each other.<br><br>There are also 3 level 24/25 dwarves on the island. At level 24 you will only be able to take 2 of them, and even then you won't be able to fully keep up with the spawns. Once you get to level 29 you will be able to take two of them, and keep them dead. At 34 you will be able to take all 3. These, like the sisters, will get you to level 36 before the exp. is bad.<br><br>Overall: A VERY good spot for the level 22-35 magician, and a decent spot for a level 10-15 magician.<br><br>Things to Remember: Don't forget to outdamage your pet. If you don't, it will steal half of your exp. for the kill. Killing sisters drops your faction with the wood elves and high elves. If you are a dark elf your already KOS, so it doesn't matter. If your not a dark elf, and don't want to become KOS, then don't kill the sisters on the island, just the dwarves. Killing the dwarves will drop your faction, but not with dwarven guards. KIlling the dwarves ont his isaldn will make you KOS to a few useless NPCS in south kaladim. So you shouldn't worry about becoming KOS, it won't hurt you.<br><br>ENJOY!<br><br>Corpusnuntia/Divineshadow/Zuranthium/Plantmaster/Naltec/Natalos/Sunsong<br><br>Player of many characters on the Nameless server.<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

I believe that if you read the user agreement it says something about exploiting bugs being a bannable offense. <br><br>As for running away at an angle, I'm not sure. Since you aren't using the hesitation caused by the creature having to switch directions to your advantage it's not the same as moving back and forth while fighting. However, my guess is that you are getting your full speed moving forward + the sideways speed equaling a faster overall speed. That could be considered exploiting a bug since in real life running at an angle doesn't increase your speed. I'm not saying it's cheating, but it is borderline.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

However, most of the time you will die becuase the thing attacking you can run faster or just as fast. Here comes the trick that will save your life hundreds of times over when outdoors. While running hit the number lock button. This will make you run forward without holding the forward button. Then hold the CTRL key and one of the sideways moving buttons(lef or right). The effect? You will strafe WHILE running, making you move FASTER than most MOBS. <br><br>If you don't have sow or aren't a bard, this will save you A LOT. It even helps if you DO have sow, becuase then you will be able to run faster than MOBS with sow speed. If you are able to cast sow and it runs out right when you are about to run away, this trick will save your life. <br><br>Please give me some good ratings for this one. I just saved your life many times, no matter what kind of character you play. BTW, try not to spread it around too much.

There are many bugs in the game that cheat players all the time, so using one to your advantage doesnt hurt (especially when you get disconnected in the middle of a high level dungeon and come back without a pet being killed by a high level mob).

	   <tr><td colspan=2>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>This is a small post to explain how to be a usefull magician in general.  This is also a tip for higher level mages.<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Master summoner, a mage can summon all the essential gear he needs for battle.  I mean common, 5 ac necklace, 4 ac rings, a dagger or staves.  This is what you call usefull summoning.<br><br>Among these, the mage is a good person to know in a dungeon or a zone where you can't get the goods you need.<br><br>What am I talking about you say?<br>Basic essentials off course!<br><br>Every item a mage summons has beneficial value:<br><br>Daggers, Staves, Stones, Food/Water, Bands, Bags<br>Arrows, Swords.. and so on.<br><br>Now what does a monk or warrior do with no healer? Bands off course.. lots and lots of bands.<br><br>Now we may not be able to sell clarity or sow as well as enchanter or druids but coldstones, runed swords, and levitation rings do sell well.  Even a stack of bandages earned me 5pp.  The wonderful part about bandages is its 1 extra band per every 2 levels of the mage.  A level 40 can summon a stack in 1 cast and sell it off pretty easy.<br><br>Or how about a dimensional whole with 20 food(cornucopia) or 20 water (everfount) for some plat.  Nice isnt it?<br><br>Even rangers and warriors message me for arrows.  Why? because were there, we can summon the item  cheap, fast, and plenty of them.<br><br>----------------------------------------------<br>Tips for 29+ mages<br>----------------------------------------------<br><br>From my experiences, it was safe to show your level until 29 or so before getting extreme newbie spam and request for gear.<br><br>Until level 39 it wasnt that bad but then the request hit me hard as soon as i'm recognized as a 40+ mage.<br><br>At level 44, my whole bar of mana will dissappear if I sit non/anon in a newbie zone.<br><br>At oasis docks, I went normal for 10 min and had at least 3 /tells a minute for bandages, cold stones, and swords of runes.<br><br>Now all of those who have necro's out there, yes all of you who might read this post, you know you drool at the availability of procing swords for your pets.  You never stop spamming me, swords, Swords.. SwOrDS!...<br><br>Most people would tell me "just tell them no", but would you really want 20 people messaging you anyways for goods???<br>Of course not.  <br><br>So anon or roleplay is the way to go and just /tell a person if he shouts for a needed summon.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------<br>Final commentary.<br>-------------------------------------------------<br><br>Mages rock, they are balanced, have offensive power, and can summon essential and usefull gear.<br>Like shamans for a group who can buff any stat, we can provide almost any basic item needed.<br><br>We are group friendly by providing a tank and magical damage at the same time.  We can take some hits, not much, and most of all fire shield the tanks.<br><br>We certainly do have a down side of no special mana regen or escape method if pet-less.  But a good mage would not be caught without a pet or at least would gate out if pet was dying.<br><br>Good luck to all of you starting a mage, my final tip to you is dont put any points into your stamina,agility,dexterity,wisdom,charisma when making a mage.  Thats how I partially screwed myself, but any minor mistake can be fixed by item equips.  :)<br><br>p.s.(put 5-10 in str and 15-20 in int)<br><br>p.s.s(Zuranthium I would be a sage too if I clicked all my posts with excellents at work &gt;:P<br>j/k nice job....) <br>&nbsp;<br>Eendyar Soulseeker<br>46'th High Elf Mage <br>"Mythic Synergy"<br><a href="http://www.mythicsynergy.com" target=_new>http://www.mythicsynergy.com</a><br>Fennin Ro</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Im sorry I had to correct you - its just i have a monk character in addition to my mage and i hate how people assume that monks and warriors are just the same but monks dont use weapons or aromor but have cool magical attacks.  Monks have many skills that warriors dont (i.e. Sneak, feign death, safe fall, block, intimidation, mend, etc..) and are more proficient in dodge, dual wield, double attack, and kick; then they have all their monk moves like tiger claw, eagle strike, dragon punch, round kick, and flying dragon kick (most of these are magical).  Im not trying to dis warriors or anything - but monks have some skills they dont - so they arent just another tank that rock in all the weapons and can wear awesome armor; they can heal themselves with mend, survive with feign death, dont need levitate to go through a desert, can scare their foes away, sneak by KOS NPC's, and block attacks.  Because of these "special" skills and magical attacks, monks make better solo classes than most people think (not until they get feign death though) and shouldnt be grouped with other tanks as just an all-around weapons master who cant heal themselves or feign death.<br><br>               - A monk proud of his abilities<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Im sorry but the sutff we can summon is NOT useless.  At least one of my group members almost always runs out of food or drink while were hunting/questing.  Also bandages - people who are wounded will almost always pay a few pp for a stack of them (especially if you bind their wound int he case of newbies with low skill level).  Plus, summoned things help you make friends, people dont mind being handed something even if it will disappear when they log out.  And I really dont like to go buy weapons for my pets just to lose them and the money that they cost - its much better to summon them.  Oh and when your a real newbie - those staff spells help - especially when you first start fighting wisps since the staffs are magic - people always ask me to summon them magic weapons when they're just starting to fight wisps or for corpse retrieval when they dont have a weapon on them.  And although i dont yet have some of the 50+ spells - im really looking forward to some of those conjuration ones. :)  <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>       Many people will say that a magician is a combination of a Wizard and a Warrior, this is simply not true.  The Magician is more than that, it is the most powerful class in all of norrath.<br><br>When you look at the races you can select for your magician the erudites stick out as having much better stats thean the other races but are blind at night.  If you really care about night sight then be a gnome.  Humans gain levels faster than other races but have miserable stats.  Nights sight can be remedy at lvl 16 so blindness is not as bad as it seems.  For the purposes of this guide i'll assume you were an erudite or human. if you chose gnome or high-elf (bad choice IMO) read the extremely long magician guide which will tell you what to do.<br>    If you were an erudite turn in your guild note and travel to qeynos where you will ask for a bind.  Now go to North Qeynos and kill newbie monster monsters until you reach level 4. Always have minor shielding on, it will save you many times.<br>   Now erudites must travel back to erudin in order to train in meditation while humans need only go to their guild.  You should purchase the spells;Summon Food, water, and dagger from your level one rank and Gate, Elmantalkin Earth, summon bandages and Burn.<br>   Now travel to BlackBurrow in Qeynos hills, there you will kill the gnolls that spawn outside of the dungeon.  You should give your pet any weapons the gnolls drop.  Your strategy should be send your pet to attack with /pet kill and cast burn TWICE and then move in to melee with your pet.  With this method you should be able to kill all 3 faster than they spawn.  keep any gnoll teeth that they drop and sell the weapons and cloth armor.  At lvl 6 you will be ready to venture into black burrow, called BB for short.<br>     BB is a dungeon, which means that deep in the cavaerns monsters almost 10 levels higher than you riseside.  If someone shouts train, that means go to the zone because they're bringing up those monsters, called mobs for short, and a bunch of their friends.  Where you want to fight is the bridge, go to the door that leads deeper into the dungeon and follow that path until you come to the bottom that area is called the bridge.  You can kill almost all the gnolls that spawn in that area with little difficulty use the same stragegy you used on the gnolls outside except you may wish to burn more while you are meleeing.  Kill these until you hit 8.  Go back to Qeynos and give the gnoll tetth that you kept to Captain tillin this will give you gobs of xp and moonstones, now take the moonstones to mcNeal Jocub in fish's bar and he will give you BlackBurrow stout which you can sell to him for about 7 silver.  <br>   Your level 8 spells are a serious investment at 4-5pp a pop.  Just buy Elementaling earth, shock of blades, shield of fire, and lesser shielding; if you have the money.  Now return to BlackBurrow and go to the bridge, now go around the lake to the right, avioding the gnolls until you come to another door.  follow that path up until you come to an open space, that is where giant snakes spawn and you will be killing these.  Send you pet to attack and give him the shield of fire burn generously with shock of baldes and use /pet report health when he reaches 40% jump in and melee.  You can rest safely on the ledge where one of the snakes spawn.  they drop snake fangs, keep one for yourself and sell the rest to merchants.  Kill these until level 10 where you will give black burrow a farewell and travel to the island in erud's crossing where willowisps will be your target, these are relitively easy and you can solo them up to lvl 16. destroy the burned out lightstones they drop sell the regular ones to the catman on the island and keep the greater lightsones.  give them to a gypsy in North Karana and she will give you a concordance of research which you can sell to a different gypsy for about 8 plat.  kill these guys until you hit lvl 16 and stop buy in Erudin to buy your spells at the libirary at lvl 12 buy; bind affintiy, burnout, and elemental: fire. at 16 buy summon throwing dagger, shielding, summon heartstone, phantom leather (requires a cat's eye agate for a reagent) buy shock of Flame, a 100 piont DD and Minor Summoning: water.<br>    Now use your riches to buy a stein of moggock and a Flowing Black Robe, and maybe some +int earring and rings from a jeweler.  offer some newbie 10plat to create a mule and kill fish in the water at the clerics guild and let you loot the corpses.  Give the fish corpse to the cleric in the pool and he'll give you a band of rochet nife, a +3Int +12mana ring.<br>   Go to Highpass Hold and kill gnolls, you may wish to join a group until you get to level 18, where you can solo gnolls and shout for a group on orc side where the mobs spawn fast and hit hard and a group of 4 or less will quickly be overwhelmed.  If you prefer a more laid back fight then stay with the gnolls, either way, when you hit 20 it's time to go again, stop by in .  Now head to South Karana and kill Aviaks until you get to 23.  You should go to the treants after that and kill them until 26.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

There was no call for your tone in attacking the message, then the manner in which the message was written. You can disagree with his ideas (I do as well- having hunted in BB with other characters, I agree that the zone tends to be full of, if not idiots, then certainly folks that can't control their pulls. I am quick to admit that bad pathing and horrible AI contribute to this as well), but please take an "agree-to-disagree" tone without attacks on English (did you ever think he might not speak English as a first language? EQ has players from all around the world) and, especially, not putting down someone else's work to elevate your own. Like I said above, a great deal of thought went into your initial Guide- don't sully your reputation by this insipid sniping at others.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

What I found though is that a human mage although low on int (I made mine with 100 int) have much better strength, and dex.  This is important because you will last a big longer in a melee, long enough usually for your cleric to heal you and your pet to save your butt.<br><br>Besides that you will have less issues with NPCs and always better prices with merchants.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Reread your post:<br><br>&gt;Um...why did you write this? Didn't you see my &gt;HUGE magician guide that took me 2 hours to &gt;write??<br><br>The above is being a jerk in anyone's book. He wrote his guide because he felt he had something to contribute. It is his opinion.  Maybe not the same as yours, but he has the right to post even though you have put out your guide.  Since your guide did not cover newbie type areas in Qeynos, his post seems like a fair post.<br><br><br><br>&gt;I definetely wouldn't suggest going to BB unless &gt;you are gonna fight giant snakes or elite &gt;gnolls. That zone IMO is the gathering of &gt;idiots...and trains are horrible there.<br><br>This is not a bad zone at the point he suggested. You just have to know where to fight.  Giant snake are great exp and good loot. But you can still get hit by trains.  There is a great room, however, with 3 gnolls that very few people vist.  It is a great place to solo with little interference from others.  Go to the tree with the trap floor on the main level outside (just to the left of the entrance). Cast invisible and drop through the trap into the water below.  Swim to the hallway out of sight of the gnolls. There are three that are there around the water.  Cast a pet in the hall, earth or water depending on your style.  The 3 gnolls should all be blue to you.  The one nearest to the hallway can be pulled without pulling the other 2.  Kill him first, med and get pet to full HP.  Wait for the remaining 2 gnolls to get to the end of the chamber away from the bridge at the other end.  Send your pet in to take on one of them.  The key here is to try to break up the spawn.  Kill one of the 2 gnolls and drag the fight out a little to kill the second one to spread the spawn.  When you are done you can sit in the room and take the spawns one at a time.  Rarely does anyone come in here and it is a dead end so no trains come through.  When you are done, gate out. You don't even have to bother learning the rest of the dungeon if you don't want to.  I've leveled two characters (one a magi) in this room.  You can go two levels here.  If the Mobs start conning green to you you need to watch out, they will run and bring friends. If one gets out, gate.<br><br>So I dont' see BB as a waste of time and would recommend it when played right.  I don't view this person's post as useless, just a different way to play the game.<br><br><br>&gt;Also, can you please use paragraphs when you &gt;right a guide....its really hard to read without &gt;em. <br><br>This was a useful piece of feedback.  Problem is it got lost in the attack you made in the first two lines.  Zuranthium, you have some good ideas, you just need to allow that people have opinions other than yours.  Like I said in my message below to you, others have as much right to post here as you do without having you come directly at them.  There are not enough people posting here yet that we can absorb these kind of comments.  The above poster will likely not post again and move to another board and we have potentially lost another person to support this board.<br><br>Cetus<br>The nameless<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Cetus<br>The Nameless</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Please, reread your post.  In your first sentence you asked him why he posted his opinion when you had spent your 2 hours writing your guide. The implication of that is that he should not have written anything since your guide was all that anyone needed to read.  If that was not your intent then I think you should clairfy for him what you ment.  At least two people read it as a negative comment (myself and the other poster). It didn't come off a question, but as an arrogant comment that he should not post a guide since you had already put one up.  Again if I have misread your intent, I appologize. But at least one other read it that way.<br><br>In your response to the first poster who disagreed with you, you said that this was a bad info and did not want people wasting their time acting on it.  That was, to me, why I made my comment.<br><br>You can certainly have your opinions. I said nothing on you opinion on idiots in BB. I agree! I just laid out a way that others could avoid the idiots.<br><br>Zuranthium, I don't want to get a odd with you. I just want you to be a little more sensitive to others when you write.  See my post to you on down on your magi guide (a good guide btw).

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have seen a few good magician guide posts, however I am gonna show you how to REALLY do good as a magician. This is VERY LONG. It is the extended version of the one I already wrote on this forum. It takes you past level 30 and has a few other things I forgot. <br><br>First off choose your race. I suggest putting 25 points into intelligence and 5 into chrisma. Also, DON'T BE A HUMAN OR DARK ELF IF YOU ARE JUST STARTING THE GAME. Dark elves are evil and will get killed on sight by a lot of other races. Some people say humans level faster than every other race...well guess what..THEY DON'T. Plus humans start with the lowest intelligence and are blind in the night. Also, I wouldn't suggest being an Erudite if you are a newbie. They are nightblind and have THE WORST starting zone in the game. If you are just starting your character I suggest being a Gnome or High Elf. These races are good-aligned, have infravision, and start on the continent of Faydwer...which is a MUCH more newbie oriented continent with less dangers. When you start give your note to your guildmaster and get your newbie robe. Put one training point into piercing, evocation, abjuration, conjuration, and channeling. Scribe your two newbie spells minor shielding and Burst of Flame. Always keep your self buffed with minor shielding - it does make a big differnce at low levels. Use Burst of Flame to help kill your enemy while you melee it. get to level 4...no big problem. <br><br>Now the fun starts. At level 4 you get new spells and the meditation skill. Only put one point into medition. It will raise very fast. You should buy Summon food, Summon water, Flare, Summon dagger(all level 1 spells)...Summon Bandages, Burn, Gate, level 4 earth pet, level 4 water pet. At level 4 you should only buy the earth and water pets. The air and fire ones aren't very useful at these levels, however will become much more usefull at higher levels(especially the air pet!). Sense you can summon bandages it is a good idea to summon a lot of them and practice yuor bind bound skill. It will allow you to heal any player, including your self up to half health. Also at these lower levels it is a VERY good idea to give your pets rusty two-handed weapons (rusty scythes, two-handed swords, and halberds). They will make your pets do MASSIVE damage and allow you to take BIG things. Now from level 4 until 8 your fighting strategy will be simple: send your pet, nuke the MOB with your damage spell (called a DD for short, for all you newbies reading this), and go in and tank for a pet if needed. Since you started out as a gnome or high-elf like I told you to (you did didn't you, hehe), you will be able to kill kobolds to get to level 6. If you are a high elf just run to steamfont...its only a 5 minute run. If you are a gnome...well steamfont is your newbie zone so you should already be there. The kobold camp has 3 kobolds that spawn at the camp and one off the side of the camp on the mountain side. To take the 3 kobolds you will need to give your pet a rusty scythe, two-handed sword, or halberd. They aren't that hard to find. Go to greater faydark and ask around for some. Or go to Felwithe, the starting city of the high elves. You will be able to find some rusty two-handers at many vendors. Kobolds will get you to level 6. Once you get to level 6 I suggest going to Butcher Block and killing dwarven skelatons at the druid ring. They are levels 5-7 and are VERY good exp. If your pet has a two hander you will do very well. The dwarven skelatons will get you to level 8. If you didn't start as a High Elf or Gnome (not recommended if you are first starting everquest), then just find stuff around your newbie zone. At levels 4-8 its not like their is a lack of things kill. IMO find a skelaton camp if you didn't start as a High Elf or gnome. They are in almost everyone newbie zone and will get you to level 8.<br><br>Some people when they first start out don't know how to control their pets. Here are all of the commands you will need to use to control your pet. <br><br>/pet attack - send your pet after whatever you want. <br>/pet back off - makes your pet back off the thing you are fighting. Has to be hit multiple times to work, and if your enemy attacks you yuor pet will go in again. <br>/pet report health - this command makes yourpet tell you how much health it has left. VERY usefull command. Use it a lot in battle. Make sure your pet doesn't die. <br>/pet gaurd here - makes your pet stay where they are and come assist you if anything attacks you. They will return to the spot they left after killing whatever attacked you. <br>/pet get lost - if you get a lower level pet and you aren't satisfied, use this command to get rid of the pet and summon a more powerful one. <br><br>Some other things about pets. Once you get to level 8 MAKE SURE that you outdamge your pet with you DD spells. If you don't outdamage your pet then your pet will get half of the exp. from whatever you killed. From level 4-7 its fine if your pet outdamages you, and since you should be giving your lower level pets rusty two-handed weapons to maked them do A LOT more damage, you probably won't be able to outdamge your pet. However once you get to level 8 make sure you take a little over half of your enemy's HP off with your own DD's so you get full exp. for the kill. <br><br>Level 8 is when magicians start to become REALLY good. At this level they get two great DD's, a damage shield, invisibility, a pet healing spell, a bunch of summoning spells, and of course your pets. The problem is that at this level spells suddenly cost a LOT for their level and you will have A LOT of spells to buy. If you have another higher level character this is no problem, but new characters will have to conserve their money. If you are low on money i suggest buying these spell first and the rest later: level 8 earth pet, Shock of Blades, Sheild of Fire, Invisibility, and Staff of Tracing. These are the only spells you will need for now. The summon staff spell can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. Now to make a ton of money you are going to hunt wisps. Wisps can only be hit by magician means( ie spells or a magical weapon), so it is very important to buy your level 8 summon staff spell, becuase it will make your pets able to hit the wisps. <br><br>The best place to hunt wisps is on the wisp island located between Odus and Qeynos. To get to it, ride the boat from qeynos to Odus and get off at the island the boat stops at in the middle of the ride. Be sure you brought a lot of backpacks/small containers. The strategy to kill these things will be: summon and earth pet and give it a staff you summoned. Then buff the earth pet with your fire damage shield. Then send it in on the wisp and stand back and keep burning the wisp until it is dead. Tank for your pet and cast your shock of swords spell inbetween the attacks of the wisp if needed. Make sure the wisp you attack is along and there are no other ones near. Wisps WILL assist each other and at this level 2 wisps means death. Also, you will want to use your level 1 "summon dagger" spell against the wisps becuase it will summon a magical weapon, and if you are just starting out and don't have a higher level character, you probably won't have access to a magical weapon. Now when you loot the wisps destroy the burnt out lightstone and regular lightstone they drop. However save the Greater Light Stones. You will get one greater lightstone for about every 5 wisps you kill. When all of your backpacks and containers are totally full with Greater light stones, take them to the gypsy camp and give them to one of the ladys(I forget which lady it is exactly...just ask someone). For every greater light stone you give her you will get a good deal of exp. for this level and about 9pp. Very soon you will have enough money to buy the rest of your spells. Here are all the other level 8 spells you will want to buy: <br><br>Renew Elements - this spell will heal your pets. It is good spell during downtime if they aren't fully healed by the time your mana is full. YOu won't need it with your level 8 pets, but your level 12 pets that have more hp and regen slower(becuase of your pet buff burnout) might need to be healed sometimes. This spell is based off your Alteration magic group. This is the first alteration spell you will get. It will fizzle a lot, so practice it up. <br><br>Dimensional Pocket - this spell summons a 4-slot weightless container that makes anything you put into it weightless. Very useful, however USE WITH CAUNTION. The pocket, and everything you put in it, will dissapear if you log off. Is good at higher levels when MOBS are dropped a lot of weapons that are too heavy to carry. Just summon a pocket and put them in it until you can go sell them. This spell can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Eye of Zoom - this isn't as useful a spell as it is fun. It will summon an eye than you can move around and see with. You can't have a pet out to cast this spell. Its fun to scout out an area with or scare lower level people, but it isn't really that useful. <br><br>Lesser Sheilding - this is an upgrade to your level 1 minor shielding spell. Always keep yourself buffed with it. <br><br>Flame Bolt - this is the other DD(direct damage) spell you get at level 8. It has a MUCH farther range than shock of swords and does more damage per hit. The downsides to it are that it takes more mana, has a slightly longer casting time, requires you to have a clear line of sight with your enemy, and will get resisted a lot by things with high fire resists. Its good for pulling things becuase you will be able to get 3 of them off before the monster can reach you, but generally you will want to use Shock of Swords. <br><br>If you ever suddenly feel like not making tons of money and get bored of wisps(unlikely), their are some other good spots to hunt. The first is the single siren spawn in OOT(ocean of tears). Take the boat from FP to BB. Eventually you will come to two large rocks jutting out of the water. Jump off the boat and swim to the left one. On the opposite side of the rock where you swam to is a level 12 siren. You can take her at level 8. Before you go get a bind at the docks in FP. The exp. is great, but its not quite as good as wisps, and the loot is nowhere near as good.  In addidion to the single spawn siren is the entire zone of steamfont. This zone has TONS of level 7-11 things...minotaurs, skelatons, pumas, plauge rats, earth elementals, and even harpys! At level 8 you will be able to take all the 11 things if your pet has a weapon. I highly suggest using an earth pet if you come here. A good place to pull things is near the entrance of the minotaur cave on the wall. Ask for directions to the cave. The real danger here is the level 35 minotaur hero that will sometimes spawn and come near the mino cave. If you stay on the wall you will usually be fine. The last place to hunt from level 8-12 is in the east commons. Here you will see darkweed snakes practically carpeting the ground. Use a water pet to kill them becuae they have a VERY nasty poison attack, and the water pet will totally negate the effects of it. You will be able to take them fairly easy even if you don't give your water pet a rusty two-hander. With a rusty two-hander you will beat them into ovlivion.<br><br>Now you will be able to get to level 12 quickly by killing wisps and turning in Greater Light Stones(or if you already had plenty of money so you went to one of my other suggested places). You will also make a ton of money(if you hunted wisps). I highly suggest buying a Stein of Mogguk with all your new money. It gives +10 to your intelligence, which gives you more mana. Also, i would buy some other +int necklaces, earrings, and rings. A new robe would be good too(do you wanna wear your newbie robe forever??) Here are the level 12 spells you will want to buy: <br><br>Burnout - This spell will make your pets regen their hp slower, but it will also make them attack better. A good pet buff spell. Always keep it on your pet. <br><br>Bind Affinity - AWESOME SPELL. This will allow you to bind yourself anywhere so that when you die, thats where you will appear. Before you got this spell you had to have other people bind you, and you can only be bound in cities when other people cast it. <br><br>Cancel Magic - this has several uses. First off it can be used to remove any buffs your enemy has on themselves. Secondly, it can be used to remove most(but not all) DoT's(or damage over time spells) that were cast on you by the enemy. <br><br>Ward Summoned - This is a good spell to use in lavastorm. The only problem is that there are way better places to hunt than lavastorm. Against elemenals it is VERY good. It does the damage of fire bolt, and has the low resist, quick casting time, and lower mana that Shock of Steel has. However, it can only be used against summoned things. The only time you will use it is when dueling other people that have pets. <br><br>Summon Fang - This spell summons a 5/26 weapon that will hit magical creatures(hehe wisps!). If you still don't have a magical weapon at this level use this instead of your level 1 summon dagger spell to hit wisps with. You can fight wisps up to level 16, so it will still be usefull. It can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Elemental Earth - Your earth pet will be the only pet you need to buy. It has massive hp and casts a root spell to keep the enemy away from you. Buffed with burnout and with its massive hp, you might get to full mana before it gets to full health. If that happens use your renew elements spell. <br><br>You also get two area effect spells at this level. You can buy them if you want, but you won't need them. They are almost totally useless for soloing, which is what you should be doing at lower levels. <br><br>At level 12 there are a lot of things open to you. You can kill wisps all the way until level 16. At level 12 your pets will be to hit magical things without wielding magical weapons. Since your level 12 pets will only do 16 damage per hit(and thats the maximum level pets), you should be giving them rusty-two handed weapons. If you can't get any two-handed weapons then just give your pet any weapon. If your pet has a weapon they will do a little more damage than normal even if the weapon doesn't make them hit for a higher maximum damage. Now if you don't want to kill wisps there are a ton of other things to do. <br><br>In Lake Rathe there is a level 15 monk called the hermit. He stands in this hut int he corner of the zone, and repsawns every 5 minutes after being killed. He can get you to level 16 if you don't want to do wisps, or want to mix things up. Summon an earth pet, buff with damage shield and burnout, and then send your pet in and stand back and blast with Shock of Swords until he dies. Tank for pet if needed, however don't do it too much. At level 12 he will kill you quickly. Remember, make sure to outdamage your pet. He is very good exp. and will get you to level 16 preety quick. The loot isn't nearly as good as wisps though. <br><br>Another place to hunt is in OOT(the ocean of tears), which is located between the continents of Antonica and feydwer. You will be hunting sirens in this zone. Go to the docks in freeport and bind yourself there. If you take the ship from freeport to butcher block you will eventually come to two large rocks coming out of the water. Jump off the boat and swim to the rock ont he right. Here you will see two level 12 sirens. Buff your water pet with burnout and your damage shield and send it in. If you bought your area effect spells this would be the time to use them(in fact it is the ONLY use for them). The sirens hit fairly hard but have low hp. After you kill the two sirens they will start spawning one at a time. Kill them as soon as they spawn very quickly. That way you won't have to fight 2 at a time anymore. This spot is AMAZING exp, however like the hermit, it is not nearly as good loot as wisps. Also, be sure to give your pet a rusty two-handed sword befoe you engage the sirens. The best spot to buy rusty weapons is on the boat from freeport to butcher block. At the first stop you will arrive at sister island. Get off and go in the shop. They sell rusty halberds here. When givin to your pet, they will make your pet do 20 damage a hit. Also, it is highly suggested to use a water pet here, since you will have to kill 2 things every 5 minutes it is a better choice than the earth pet that might not be able to keep up with the quick spawns.<br><br>Soon you will be level 16. All of these methods will level you fast(although I still think wisps are the best method becuase they give so much money). Once you get to level 16 the best place to hunt is in lake rathe, which is where the hermit was located if you went to fight him from 12-16. Before I talk about lake rathe I will tell you your new spells for level 16: <br><br>Shock of Flame - a new DD spell! At level 12 you didn't get a new DD, except for ward summoned which you probably didn't use. For 70 mana this spell will start off doing 91 damage and eventually raise to 97 damage. <br><br>See Invisible - this spell will allow you to see invisible players and pets. Since your air pet casts invisiblity on itself a lot, its good to use this spell when using an air pet. <br><br>Summon Throwing Daggers - this spell will summon a bunch of throwing dagger that can be given to someone that uses throwing weapons (monks, rogues, and bards in general). This spell can only be bought in the dark elf, gnome, and erudite cities. <br><br>Heatstone - this spell will summon an item that will grant the user infravision. Is good to give to night-blind races or to use yourself if you started as an Erudite or human(Although if you are a begginer you probably did what I said and started as a gnome or high elf, which means you all ready have infravision). <br><br>Staff of Warding - summons an 8/38 staff with a couple charges of glimpse(which always you to see farther). It really doesn't have much use except to play around with the glimpse spell it comes with(or you can give it to a low level newbie...is a good weapon for a newbie). This spell can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Level 16 pets - At this level I would suggest buying all the pets. Also at this level you can not buy all the pets in your guild. The level 16 and 20 pets must be bought in OOT(the ocean of tears). I forget which island has the vendor that sells the pets, so ask around. <br><br>Shielding - An upgrade to your lesser shielding spell. keep it on at all times. The extra hp and ac can save your life if you need to tank and its a close battle. <br><br>Phantom Leather - this spell boots your AC and also lets your regen your HP a little faster. It is good for if you are going into a tough battle where you will probably have to tank. <br><br>At level 16 you get the ability to start researching. Go to your guild and put one point into your researching skill and it will be maxed until level 20(there is a bug where after putting a point in at your guild it raises your skill higher then its suposed to). Of all the pure casters, magicians have it the hardest when it comes to researching. They have to combine old spells, a word, and an item to make scrolls they can use. I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about researching becuase it would take a LONG time to explain. So go to castersrealm.com and look at the magician research stuff. Hehe if you are a newbie first starting out, feel lucky. When i first started the game resarching was nearly impossible. Since then, however, they have made it easier(although it is still fairly hard). <br><br>Okay Now back to the hunting guide. At level 16 venture to Lake rathe. Here you will find a bunch of aviak guards that are level 16-20. For their level, they aren't that hard. At level 16 you will be able to take level 20 aviaks. This is also the level when you should start grouping. Almost all the aviaks in this zone are close together, and will attack you at the same time. The only time you will want to solo when hunting them is if you are at the single aviak spawn, or at the entrance to the arena zone where you can take the two aviaks one at a time. However this isn't always possible, as they are sometimes camped, so you will have to group with another person(or two other people if you want to take the 3-spawn aviaks). Aviaks are pretty good loot dropping up to 3pp and FS(fine steel) weapons which will sell for about 5pp each at the ogre vendors in the zone(don't worry even though they are ogres they sell to everyone). The aviak guards also drop words which you can use to research some of your level 16 spells(if you didn't buy them already). <br><br>Fighting aviak guards will get you to level 20 pretty quickly. It is easily the best place for yuor level, I really can't even think of any other place that comes close to how nice this zone is. Some people will tell you that Oasis is a good zone for this level, but I totally disagree with that. it is severely overcrowded, the loot sucks, and there are specter and sand giant trains all the time. When you get to level 20 its time for new spells! Here is the list of spells: <br><br>Bolt of Flame - this spell does MASSIVE damage and has a VERY long range too! But be careful, it has a huge taunt rate so you will usually want to use an earth or air pet when soloing becuase of their root/stun spells. Also you have to have a clear line of sight for it too work. <br><br>Elemental Shield - a fairly useful buff for things that cast spells. Raises your cold and fire resistances. <br><br>Spear of Warding - summons a magical spear that has a small fire and cold resist+ tacked on to it. Not all that usefull. Give it to a newbie or a a rogue without a magic piercing weapon. can also be given to pet, but once you hit 29 and get your rune swords, it becomes useles to give to pets. It can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Renew Summoning - this is a very nice upgrade to your level 8 pet-only healing spell. Use it when your pet is low in HP or if your mana is full and your pet's hp isn't full. <br><br>Summon Arrows - this spell summons a bunch of magical arrows. Give them to people that use bows and don't want to spend money making or buying arrows. Fairly useful. Can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Summon Waterstone - this summons a stone with a charge of enduring breath, which makes you able to breathe under-water. Great for when you want to go to kedge keep at higher levels, or just to keep in your inventory incase you for some reason get caught under-water. It can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Shield of Flame - an upgrade to your level 8 damage shield. Definately use it to buff yuor pet before you attack something or in a group on the tanks. <br><br>Rain of Fire - an area effect spell. Is useful when your group wants to take multiple mobs and their is no enchanter around to mezz the extras. Be careful though, it will get the monsters mad at you. It is limited in its use. <br><br>Level 20 pets - I suggest that you buy all of the pets at this level. You can't buy them all at your guild. You have to go to the merchant in OOT on one of the islands to get the rest that aren't sold at your guild. <br><br>Now the level 20 fighting place - SOUTH KARANA!!!! This zone has TONS of stuff in it. At level 20 there are many things you can do. First off is the aviak city. The aviaks here anywhere from about levels 15-30. Get a group and kill rooks that spawn on the bottom, or go up to the penthouse. Splitpaw - right outside the dungeon of split paw there are three spires and a hill. Level 24-29 gnolls spawn here. If you are able to get in a group the exp. is pretty decent. Treants, these things are pretty good exp. and VERY good loot. They are heavily camped though, so you might have to wait to get in a group. Alsom treants drop your faction with druids and with qeynos, so don't kill them if you don't want to be KOS at the druid rings or in qeynos. Centaurs, these guys can be good exp. and drop some nice items too. The best place to hunt them is near the centaur outpost. Many will wander by the outpost. You will be able to solo any that don't con red. If you get in a group with someone that can track it is even better because sometimes the pickings get slim and having someone who can easily find more make for good exp. Also, there are a couple merchants in one of the stables at the centaur outpost. Sell there. <br><br>The last thing this wonderful zone offerrs....the hermit. In the middle of nowhere is alevel 20 ranger. He is VERY good exp. Why? becuase he has a 3 MINUTE SPAWN. Not only that but the loot he drops isn't bad. PLUS, sometimes he drops FS two-handed weapons which you can give to your pet to make them do 24 damage a hit. The only problem is that he sits in a hut with a door that won't open. To pull him out go near the chimney of the house, have no one targeted, and say 'kill you'. After doing that a few times he will attack you through the wall and your pet will go after him. You won't be able to use your level 20 bolt spell the first time you attack him becuase it won't go through the wall. use your level 16 DD that will still hit him. I HIGHLY suggest that you use a water or air pet to camp him. Why? Becuase since he repsawns every 3 minutes, your earth pet will never be able to regen in time, only your water or air pet will be able to keep up(well the fire pet could keep up too, but you don't want to use him here, dies way too fast). After you kill him the first time you won't need to say 'kill you' anymore. As soon as he spawns again just target your pet and type /assist. Then the hermit will auto maticcaly be targeted and you can pull him out of the house using your level 16 DD, and then once he teleportes out of the house you can use your level 20 DD. However, if you are using a water pet and not an air pet, try to keep him in the house, pull him with your level 16 DD and then send your pet in, and then burn with caution so he stays on your water pet and does teleport out to attack you. If you are using an air pet it is fine to pull him out becuase the air pet will stun him and let you DD. <br><br>With everything it has to offer South karana will be able to get you to level 30. You can easily get from level 20 to 27 just soloing the hermit. If the hermit is camped by someone ele you can always do centaurs, gnolls ouside of splitpaw, and aviaks. Plus once you get to level 24 you can go INSIDE spiltpaw with a group for decent exp.  If you don't mind losing faction with the druids and qeynos you can also kill treants which are a VERY good money source. Even better than the treants is the druid ring in east karana(acctually not that far away). Here there will be 3 druids (and sometimes you will get a few treants) that respawn every 3 minutes. It is WAYYYY better than the south karana treants, but you need more people to hold it down, and its more dangerous. However, if you can get 4 casters(including you), in their mid to high 20's together, you will get AMAZING EXP and INSANE LOOT. Of course you have to be willing to becoming KoS in qeynos and at all the druid rings.<br><br>Once you get to level 30 you can go out and do whatever you want. Level 30 is the first 'hell' level so leveling to level 31 will take you a while. Also on the level 24 and 29 spells....buy ALL of them. Once you get to these levels simply buy ALL of your spells. You will be grouping more and more, and you never know when you might need a spell that would seem worthless to you if you were soloing. Also, most of the level 24 and 29 pet spells can't be bought and MUST be researched. You should be able to do all right without researching extra pets, but you should always try to get all of your pets. Also, when you get to level 29 ALWAYS give your pet two rune swords that you are able to summon once you get to level 29(unless you can get two gnoll hide lariats, or a combination of a gnoll hide lariat and a rune sword). They will make your pet do a lot more damage(or stun sometime in the case of the lariats). <br><br>At level 29/30 get two gnoll hide lariats. Go to Rathe mountains. Summon an air pet, buff it with burnout 2, and give him the two gnoll hide lariats. Now go solo giant skelatons and cyclops's(how the heck do you say the plural of cyclops??????). Anyway, against the giant skelatons it will be VERY easy...send your pet in and then cast your level 24 Shock spell 3 times. The massive stun proc the air will do with the lariats combined with his own stun will easily keep the skelatons on him no matter what you do. Just make sure you outdamage your pet so you get full EXP. for the kill. You could have taken these giant skelatons at level 24 without many problems, but there are A LOT of wandering cyclops's in the zone, and they will have killed you at level 24. If you are gonna solo cyclops's at level 29 you won't want to do a huge burn so quick, becuase the are an avaerage of 5 levels higher than giant skelatons and won't get stunned as much. They will get stunned a fair amount of the time though. Just Blast when needed and Try to outdamage your pet without the cyclops aggroing on you. Also, instead of using and air pet you can use an earth pet and give it two rune swords, or if you can't get enough gnoll hide lariats, give your air pet two rune swords. You can get to level 34 soloing giant skels/cyclop's and then from 34 to 39 just on cyclops's (at level 34 cyclop's become pretty easy and you will be able to kill them quickly). <br><br>Also at level 34 you can start killing Hill Giants, Sand Giants, Specters, and Griffons that don't con red(if they con yellow you still might not want to do it). They are all pretty good exp. and loot(especially the giants). Also at level 34 you can start taking city guards. They are level 30-35 in most places, with the best spot to hunt them being butcher block(dwarf guards) and steamfont(gnome guards). All these things can level you from level 34 to 45 or 46, or 39 to 45 or 46 if you kept killing cyclops's at 34. The guards especially.<br><br>Now something else you will be doing a lot at this level is grouping. Starting at level 24 you should start grouping. All the soloing strategys I listed above are not the only ways to go. Grouping in Upper guk, Lower guk, Solesk A and B, Splitpaw, Mistmoore, Unrest, and other dungeons can work very well sometimes. Plus, once you get to about level 44 you will want to group A LOT. As a magician your role in the group will be to dish out a lot of damage via your pets, DD spells, and damage shield. You should start grouping as early as possibly to learn to to fight well in a group. As I said, once to get to your mid-40's, grouping will become essential. It becomes a lot harder to solo. However if you do want to solo from the mid-40's to 50, Seafury Cyclops's in OOT and high level giants(ice giants in everfrost) would be your best bet. However I wouln't suggest that too highly consdiering that the exp. won't be as good as getting in a good group.<br><br>I currently do not have the expansion so I don't know exactly what its like post-50. However I hear soloing is VERY difficult, and you WILL want to get into groups. Heh, its sort of lame that I don't have the expansion. The reason is becauce my video card isn't good enough and my parents don't feel all that well about paying $100 for a videa card for a 'game'. Hehe rofl....not quite 18 yet. Ah well....Thanks for reading this guide.<br><br>Corpusnuntia/Divineshadow/Natalos/Naltec/Plantmaster/Zuranthium/Sunsong <br><br>Player of many characters on the Nameless server. <br><br>Give me a good rating for this one! Took me two hours to write! Also sorry about the spell/grammer mistakes. I am sure I made some, but I didn't have time to check em. *wave* <br><br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>For those of you that DO have Kunark, it is the place to be 44+, solo or grouped!  You have SO much more variety to choose from.

In Lake of Ill Omen there are two 2 hour spawns of level 40 shamen, both of whom drop weapons worth over 500pp (exact price server dependant).  In Burning Woods if you are hunting sarnaks outside Chardok you will pick up a Runic Carver within an hour of arrival every time you go.  In a full group in Trakanons Teeth with a druid to pull the Forager/Hunter/Nameds youll be brining in about 1 NICE rare item every hour to get your chance to random for.<br><br>PS: Yeah, I missed a LOT.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>From my hunting experience on wisp island, it could get VERY uncomfortable at level 8.  Main reason is the wisps tend to circle the island and walk around the coast in bands.  More than one wisp on a level 8 wisp can equal out to pain and ouchies in a hurry.  Don't kill anything with kedge in the name there, makes the kerrans go sadistic on you.<br><br>Level 15 Monk in Lake Rathe:  Named Jonah Brucker or Brunker can't remember.  Damage shield works well here.  He has the same spawn time as Trissa Whistlesong, water and minor gems for loot, but rarely camped as most people don't consider the loot worth it.  Same exp as Trissa though.<br><br>One thing Corpusnuntia didn't mention is the bard Trissa Whistlesong in West Freeport in Hogcaller's Inn.  She is level 15, hits for low damage (comparatively) and only has one attack per round.  It MIGHT be possible for a level 12 magician to kill her, my experience is from a druid and I imagine it would be possible.  You will have TERRIBLE competition for this spawn, but the reward is awesome experience and at least 1pp in loot every time.  Another downside is negatory faction with Guards of Qeynos, Knights of Truth, and Antonican Bards.  This is not a massive hit though, my druid hunted her from 14 until 19 and is dubious to bards.<br><br>Hermit in SK:  Lots of competition!  Hits for 42 and double attacks, throws in a kick every couple of rounds.  About 1 in 6 times he will drop an FS: Scimitar, Shortsword, Longsword, or 2 Handed Sword.  Might drop the bastard and broadsword too, never had them in my experience.  He sometimes drops magician research items (pearl shard, ice of vellious), but do not count on these.  Great experience, gets mind numbingly boring.<br><br>Guards:  Take the time to learn which guards are uber newbie guards and which ones aren't.  Choice Butcherblock hunting is npc's not guards, seen a 51 magician friend die to a guard there, at some places it has a chance of being an uberguard or a normal guard (Delin's hut)  These npc's used to be really camped but people have seemed to calm down.<br><br>Aviak guards are not sometimes camped, they are 99.9% of the time camped.  Can be good exp though.<br><br>I told Zuranthium about the dwarf skeletons in Butcherblock ;)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The easiest way to level from 44 to 48 is to kill spectres and sand giants in oasis.  Not only do you get fast experience, but you can make 100pp/hour just by killing them.<br><br>Seafury Cyclops's in OOT might give better experience but they have around 4000hp which is a full mana drain for a lvl 44-47 mage.  Not only that, but they resist the fire dd's somewhat so they arent the best thing to solo.  However grouped vs sea furies is much faster experience.<br><br>Ice giants are a good idea because they are the same level but more susceptible to fire attacks.  Not only that, but they are much easier to kill with jboots since everfrost is a big running zone unlike OOT (island).<br><br>Escape in everfrost is easy compared to escaping an island.<br><br>I'm still in oasis about to get 47, but watch out because those spectres are very easy to train.  And 3 or 4 can wreak havoc on many newbies in the zone.<br><br>SG's go down pretty fast if using an earth pet and shock of swords (44 dd magical).  Usually 4 shocks + pet with fire shield takes care of the problem.<br><br>Each spec usually takes 2 shocks and pet with fire shield, sometimes a Blaze (34 dd fire) is needed to finish a spec off.<br><br>Specs (1.5-1.8khp) Sg's(2-2.3khp)<br><br>Two to three specs can be killed per mana bar or upto two sg's.  <br><br>Great exp for the small downtime and its always nice to get a lockjaw now and then.<br><br>Very nice and informative post Zuranthium, just lengthy and a possible spoiler for mages who want to do some exploring of their own :)<br>&nbsp;<br>Eendyar Soulseeker<br>46'th High Elf Mage <br>"Mythic Synergy"<br><a href="http://www.mythicsynergy.com" target=_new>http://www.mythicsynergy.com</a><br>Fennin Ro</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Thanks for the reply to my post Edndyar. I talked about killing spectors and the like in my guide, however I didn't recommnd doing it to your level. The problem I found with these guys, was that at level 46, over half of them were conning green, giving no exp. for the kill, or signficantly less. <br><br>Also, Oasis is ALWAYS really crowded and these things are HIGHLY camped, so thats sort of why I suggested Sea Furies. There usually won't be anyone at the seafuries. So even though it takes a lot longer to kill them, and you have a lot more downtime. You will be getting more exp. then if you were at Oasis, forced to group with a couple other people becuase its so crowded, and not getting exp.(or barely any) every other pull becuase they con green.<br><br>Also you mentioned something about not hunting Seafuries becuase their magic resist to fire was high. Well I won't suggest trying to take seafuries until level 44, which is when you get your new shock DD that isn't fire based.<br><br>I hope you like my guide. As you said it is 'a possible spoiler', however this is just a GUIDE and I would have to smack the person that did everything step by step, level by level, to what I said in here. I personally like to explore, which is how I found a few of the places that I listed in my guide, so I definetely wouldn't want any newbie to think its not good to travel and explore.
