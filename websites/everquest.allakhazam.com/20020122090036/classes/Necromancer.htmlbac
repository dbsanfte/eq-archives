<p><b>This is one of the best classes to solo.&nbsp; The combination of
a strong pet and damage over time (dot) spells makes the necromancer able
to solo creatures most other classes wouldn't think of taking on.&nbsp;
Of course, since most NPC's hate the site of you, you may find it necessary
to solo.&nbsp; You will also find that you are unable to play in certain
zones where the good NPC's will try to kill you when they see you.&nbsp;
Like the magician, the Necromancer has the combined ability to summon a
skeleton to work as a tank and then stand back and blast away, but the
necromancer's dot spells are arguably more powerful combat spells than
the mage's dd spells.&nbsp; While not as strong as a fighter or a wizard
in either specialty, the combination of skills can be pretty deadly.&nbsp;
The biggest drawback of a necromancer is that you are evil.&nbsp; In many
areas, you areKOS to the shopkeepers and can't even get a shopkeeper to
sell you food.&nbsp; Travelling is very difficult, and you can't rely upon
the guards in most places to help you out.&nbsp; Although many who play
a necromancer choose to play solo much of the time, Necromancers are very
useful in a group.&nbsp; With their pet and spells, they give the group
both a tank and a battle mage in one package.&nbsp; This is a difficult
class to play, but is a good one if you want to spend most of your time
soloing.</b>
