It is based on my exp and dps calculations.&nbsp;&nbsp;although I don't believe you can calculate the actual damage you will do by such simple means I do think that it is a good way to compair the damage done with different weapons.  <br>I also take a number of other factors into consideration such as the damage cap 10 per lvl 10 and 14 pre lvl 20 and the str bonus for primary hand after lvl 28.<br>The dps calculation i use is (2xdamage+bonus)/delay<br><br>1. short swords<br>In newbee zones the best 1hs that drops is the rusty shortswords, if you sharpen it it is the best sword you can loot in most starting areas.  You can also buy short swords in most newbee zones and pre lvl 10 the FS short swords is one of the best 1hs you can use.  This is do to it's low damage and good speed.  At low lvls you need low damage weapons to get your skills up.<br>2. Sivery War Axe and other 6 damage low 20 delay weapons.<br>These are great starting weapons do to the low damage and short delay. These weapons go for about 10pp in the bazaar.  Are great for getting skills up and are effective until lvl 20.  (by effective i mean i was able to solo with these weapons at that lvl with lvl approiate armor, in this case a full suit of banded)<br><br>Icetooth Claw and other weapons with a damage of around 10 and a high 20's delay.  <br>Of these the claw is the cheepest, however the other can be moved to the off hand when you obtain a better weapon.  These weapons are effective until about lvl 30 with a mix of banded and crafted class armor.  I used a claw and a 8/24 1hb or a 9 /25 dagger in my off hand.  These really are some of the best weapons no twinks can get mid teens and should be the weapon of choice while upgrading your armor to crafted class.  Also with a group you can do RE while in your 20's.  RE is where the BALS drops.  <br>Past lvl 20 you really dont want a primary weapons with a delay above 30 or so.<br><br>Lam 8/19<br>This is probably the most popular twink weapons.  and the goal of many worriors.  I personally think this weapon is over raited and over priced.  However do to the low damage it hits for full effect for lvl 1 on.  Not true for many of the other high end weapons.  This weapon can be used till lvl 50 as a primarry weapon.  I feel that it should not be used as an off hand weapon do to the cost and the fact that in the off hand dps dose not change with lvl.  And there are a number of weapons with higher dps at much lower cost.  <br><br>Cenit Warhammer 15/32<br>The slowest and lowest of the centi weapons. Also it will not hit for full damage till lvl 20. <br>Inspite of this I think this is one of the better buys.  there is not that much differance in the dps of the centi weapons and you will want to have a good 1hb to keep your skill up.  this is a nice upgrade from the Icetooth claw like weapons and can be used as a primary weapon until the mid 30s with good results.<br><br>Centi shortsowrd 12/25 and 12/26 weapons<br>All the centi weapons have good bonuse.  I believe these weapons are very conpaiable to the Lam. I fact I think they are better do to their higher dps at during the mid lvls, and the much lower price tag.  I have seen two css hold agro vs two lams a number of times.  Mostly because the css makes a better off hand weapon.  These are good weapons till lvl 50 or so.<br><br>Centi Longsword 14/28<br>I personally don't believe this weapon is woth what it cost.  I feel you get almost the same dps in your off hand with the css.  However this is one of the very best off hand weapons you can get pre lvl 50 or without spending a boat load of plat.  <br><br>Wurmy 25/40<br>This weapon has fallen from favor recently.  It is too slow to compete with most of the other twink weapons pre lvl 20 (do to the damage caps)<br>And some say it is too slow for a primary weapon for a warrior how is trying to hold agro.  Here is my rebuttle for the common agrments about speed being more important that dps (and pre lvl 50 you will be very hard pressed to get a higher dps weapon)<br>1. Misses generate agro.  This is based on the observation that you can swing at a mob and miss it and it will still attack you.  This is like someone realizing you are trying to kill them and starting to denfend themselfs.  I have never been able to pull a mob off of a caster with a miss.  I have seen a number of times when lower lvl warrors hold agro or get some agro while fighting blue mobs but not while fitting yellow or red mobs in the same group. (you miss more vs yellow and red mobs) This proves to me that misses do not generate much if any agro once the fight is started.  <br>2. Number of touches has a major impact on holding agro.  I know that in one of the eq book it states that number of touches is a factor in decding who holds agro, however it does not say that it is the major factor.  I have never seen an equile lvl and same race warrior out agro using weapons that have a lower dps even when they are faster.  However I have seen a number of insidances when a lower lvl large race warrior will out agor a higher lvl small race warrior with equilent or better weapons.  Large race warrior tend to be stronger and thus do more damage.  This suggest that the amount of damage done is the major factor in deciding how holds agro.  This is less the case post lvl 50 but I have seen it at those lvls as well.  <br>My first warrior used a wurmy form lvl 30 to lvl 50 (obtaining a fbss at lvl 41) and More times than not held agro.  My off hand post lvl 45 was a rune blade sword of night 12/26 with a 176 proc.  It is possible that my off hand weapon was the deciding factor a number of times.  But it too is a relativly slow weapon.<br><br>Jade Mace <br>One of the few common weapons that has a better dps than the wurmy pre lvl 50.  Presonally I feel this weapons should be as popular as the lam.  However it is a 1hb and many a warrior only keep there 1hs skills lvl maxed or even developed.  <br><br>Two hand weapons<br>It is now a very rare thing to see warriors using two hand weapons.  This is do to the belief that speed is more important than dps.  These factors have resulted in a number of very good two hand weapons being sold at unbelieveable prices in the Bazaar.  <br>I like two hand weapons for the following reasions<br>1. I believe that dps is the major factor in deciding who hods agro.  And pre lvl 50 you can get two hand weapons that out damage a number of one hand weapons combos for far less plat.<br>2. Instant damage.  Both crits and dubble attacks are instant damage.  How much instant damage you do is a factor of dps not weapon speed.  For example a lam will hit abut twice as often as a SBH but the SBH 30/40 will do three times the damage.  And you don't get dubble attacks with your off hand.  <br>3. Slow weapons are much better against mobs with damage shields and thoes who enrage.<br><br>SBH 30/40 <br>Is usable well past lvl 50. Can often be bought for 50plat or so.  I have used it to hold agro from lvl 20 to lvl 51.  This weapons can compete with most pairs of 1hs until lvl 50 for agro.  All and all one of the best weapons in the game for those who don't have a boat load of plat.  <br><br>BABS<br>Another very nice and cheep two hand weapons.  What's more is it is very light and acts as a light source.  My first warrior would pull with a weighted axe and then switch to his BABS.  He was able to hold agro during most of his time in FM and OT zones.  <br><br>If you are a poor warrior and want to give those unber twinks a run for their plat invest in a good two hand weapons and save your plat for a haste item.  <br><br>Use a weapons like the silver war axe and claw then get your armor to chain, banded, or bronze.  Then upgrade your weapons to CSS or such and upgrade your armor to crafted class.</p>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Which really added to my dps.  <br>Personally I feel it is unwise to rely on them for the following reasons<br>1. proc is a random event, and you can not count on it happing.<br>2. the higher the mob's lvl is compaired to your lvl the less your weapon will proc.  <br><br>If without the proc you will not hold agro, I believe it could prove disisterous for your group or raid.  But if the proc just adds to your ability to hold agro then I would not hesatate to be MA. <br><br>I have used the following weapons with procs<br><br>Yak, I still like this weapon, and at one time it was used well into the 40's.  <br><br>RBSoN I loved this, too bad the one that still drops in the game (if it does) doesent have the proc.<br><br>VAoVB I always felt this weapon was over raited, maybe because it couldn't compete with the RBSoN.  <br><br>Frosty Probably the most popular upper end procing weapons that can be bought.  I personally believe it is good enough to use in your primary hand as well.  However I replaced my with a LSoF. (off hand)  I played around with both for a couple of weeks.  For me I get agro faster and hold it better with the LSoF.<br><br>If I used a weapon with a proc I will try and insure that i get boon.  <br><br>deciding between a weapon with a lower dps and a proc and a weapon with a higher dps is never stright forward.  <br><br>using a Parser and seeing two consitive hits with your off hand weapon on it, or scrolling back and seeing the two hits with your off hand weapons is not prof of a dubble attack with our off hand.  Unless the log has some kind of time stamp or other indication to show both hits happend at the exact same time.  <br>I have seen the off hand weapons score two hits (with some time between them) with no hit scored by the primary weapon.  <br><br>As for 2hw vs 2 1hw for holding agro at lower and mid lvl compaired to high lvls consider the following.<br>Your off hand scored more hits (as a percent of your primary hand) the higher your lvl.  At high lvl (really about 40+ or so) your off hand weapons accounts for a larger percent of your total damage than at lvl 20.  <br>So maybe at lvl 20 the 2hw just has to out damage the primary and 25% of the off hand.  But at lvl 55 it has to out damage the primary and 65% percent of the off hand.  (percents are guess based on observations, not hard numbers)<br><br>After lvl 55+ it is a very rare thing to see a 2hw take and hold agro vs 2 1hw.  I have seen it happen such as with dobble crits.  <br><br>I still use 2hw with my high lvl war, mostly to allow a melee with less ability to hold agro  to hold it when doing so is adventagous to the group or raid.  To see thoes 400 and 500 plus crips.  To keep all my weapon skills lvl maxed.  <br><br>Curently my lower lvl war will use his 2hw to hold agro and to see the reaction of those who believe that two hand weapons are too slow to hold agro effectivly.  I like being different than 99 percent of the warrior.  And I get a big kick out of holding agro with a 50 pp weapon vs weapons that cost 1000s of plat :)<br>Oh btw my warriors are on different servers.  For me most of the fun of eq is improving my toon as they lvl up.  Never was much of a fan of twinking.  <br><br></p>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I have also had 4 or 5 processes during one fight.  This being the case I don't feel you can count on the proc to hold agro. For me taunt is much more effective.  <br><br>When i am MA I normally don't have to worry about knights and such taking agro for long periods of time.  If they are over agroing the cleric just cast cel heal on them (instead of complete heal).  They soon get the idea that they are not MA.  Furthermore in exp groups I find that melee classes the rely on mana to hold agro either run out of mana or use it slow enough as not to hold agro for long perirods of time.  The exception being when the have C3.  Since warriors, can be out agroed by anyone else it is evryone elses responcibility to minimize their agro.  This being the case our main job is to get agro back when some nuker, healer, or slower has been attacked.<br>For me getting agro back seldomes takes long enough for the weapon to proc.  The things that matter in these casses are dps, weapons speed, and taunt. <br>Yes proc does help a lot with holding agro.  But getting agro back quickly is the most important part of our role, and procs just don't happen often enough to help with this.  </p>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I am a 52 War on Rodcet Nife and prefer a solid 2hs. At this stage of the game it is difficult to hold aggro when in a balanced group as most other classes will out damage you (in some cases grabbing the mobs undivided attention). I have found that banging on the taunt key and sitting in front of the mob will earn&nbsp;&nbsp;a good deal of aggro, and generally put you back on top of the hate list.<br><br>I feel being a war entitles you to produce the most damage you possibly can, and swinging a lammy/centi just doesn't work for me. This is my observation, once I began using higher end 2hs (ratios of 2:1 or better 30/33, 40/44, 44/44 and so on) and learned to hold aggro the same way casters do when they med. I can produce many times more damage per fight or grind session.  I'm still working through parse files to get accurate stats. I enjoy thowing down 2-3k+ points of damage per mob, especially when that crushing 400+ crit pops makes me fell more like a tank instead of a aggro/HP sponge.<br><br>my 2 cp :)<br>Tard 52 war RN</p>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

Where to begin<br><br>You said &quot;I feel being a war entitles you to produce the most damage you possibly can&quot; then why arn't you playing a monk or a rog.&nbsp;&nbsp;on't let the name fool you.  We are NOT damage dealers.  Absolutly if you can hold aggro and do damage fabulous, I know im not exactly helping the mob any hen the fleshgrinder procs, but the MOST IMPORTANT THING A WARRIOR DOES IS HOLD AGGRO.  If your not doing this, the group might as well get another monk. Perhaps the reson you have trouble HOLDING aggo is becuase you don't like to swing a lammy/cent, or more likely at 52 some decent proccing weapons.  Yes, the other classes are going to outdamge you, but taunt has allot of other factors thrown in.  Learn to manage these other factors and you will not have nay trouble holding aggro.<br><br>You said &quot;especially when that crushing 400+ crit pops makes me fell more like a tank instead of a aggro/HP sponge.&quot;  If you don't like ding this, why play a warrior.  I rather enjoy being the MA.  If you enjoy doing damage, play a monk.  Yeah it feels good when all those groupies tell you NICE HIT!!! :) but it feels better when all the factors are working together and your groupies tell you GRATZ DING :)<br></p>&nbsp;<br>Sometimes I do what I'd like to do, The rest of the time I do what I have to.<br>Veteran Ratman 65 warrior<br>Curelessme 59 Mage<br>Thunderfighter 55 Monk<br>Fellowship of Brothers<br>FOB HK SL Alliance</td></tr>
