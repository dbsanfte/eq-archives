	   <tr><td colspan=2>Here is a few tips for fellow pullers...lol<br><br>The art of pulling...<br><br>The art of pulling is not by any means easy or the same for any areas of even the same dungeon.&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for research outside of the game cannot be impressed enuff on everyone in the eq game...you need to know what to expect...where to zone...what it's like pulling...problems you may encounter...what loot is on what mobs...nothing worse than not doing the legwork on research and underestimate a mob and it's loot potential.  Is it a common/rare/very rare drop on a common/rare/very rare/triggered mob...etc etc etc  Other things to always be aware of is as follows:<br><br>1)  Pathing:  Meaning if you pull a mob, will it run straight to you or will it aggro more by running some insane pathing area you are not aware of and training more than your single pull?<br>Are you new to zone or a veteran puller in this area with these mobs?  How far is zone, in case you need too.  If you pull to many and know death is INC if you try to take them to party...do you train to zone, die and get a CR/rez, or KILL YOUR WHOLE GROUP?  Last option is least liked btw...LOL<br><br>2)  Aggro Radius:  If a mob is KOS to you...will it attack or only when you sit down?  Will others aggro from rooms or areas nearby that you are unaware of?<br><br>3)  Train handling capacity:  What can your group feasibly handle as a group before a casualty is caused and you are now on CR duty for a fellow party member?  If you do not have a healer in any sized group...then trains equal death...sooner or later.<br><br>4)  Group Mana Status:  Do you know what, if any, mana your group's casters are at?  Is healer at FM or OOM?  Is that wiz/mage/necro/chanter gonna have enuff mana to save your group from a bad pull or did you just sign everyone's CR ticket?<br>Do you know if the mobs you are pulling are too high for your casters to help you on, cuz if that's the case...you just turned a bunch of casters into Tanks and that's not a pretty sight by any means.<br><br>5)  AFK status:  Is your group all there?  Is the chanter getting a soda?  The cleric in the bathroom?  Or the other tanks afk?  Just because you are in a group and wanting xps is no excuse to be caught with your pants down for not asking the group?  IS EVERYONE RDY FOR A PULL?  IS EVERYONE BACK OR WE WAITING?  Pulling 3 mobs to an AFK group is the surest way to anger your party, kill yourself since no is around to help get the mobs that are beating you to death like a rag doll, and begin your way to a long and lengthy CR.<br><br>6)  Bind status:  Is your entire group binded in the closest zone or did they forget?  I was once in a group where no one but me bothered to bind in a nearby zone.  "Why bother we have a cleric with rez?"  Well...the cleric was the first to die and then everyone else but me.  I was smart and moved the cleric to zone area.  Everyone else kept pulling away and died.<br>I didn't stay with that group for too long after that.   Btw...cleric's bind pt was in FV...LOL<br><br>7)  Rdy status:  Is your group rdy for you to pull?  How many mobs can you pull?  Killing one mob fast or 8 mobs slowly is a choice best decided beforehand.  No chanter to mez?  Then 1-3 mobs at most.  Chanter with FM...whose Mez's stick...pull 1-5 mobs if you can handle it.  DON'T HAVE A CLUE ON HOW MANY TO PULL?  simple pull one single and work up from there.<br>Nothing is worse than the entire group looking around for you as your health bar looks like this one min ========== and then goes to this == with them saying, "WTF...ARE YOU PULLING?"  No one can save you, cuz no one has a clue where you are, what you pulled, or how many you pulled.<br><br>  Designated puller:  This should either be the highest lvl tank...highest ac/hp tank...this consideration should be based on NO buffs whatsoever?  Why?  Cuz sooner or later those buffs will vanish and usually do at the most inconvenient time also I might add.  Let me add this one final word of caution:  NO ONE & I MEAN NO ONE SHOULD PULL EXCEPT THE DESIGNATED PULLER.  Roamers and adds from aggro are one thing that are considered a way of life.  Surest way to step out of line in a group is to not be the designated puller and pull something.  I have seen it happen...it is not a nice feeling to see someone give you an add with an INC pull on the way.  E.g., I was in DL...A rogue was running around picking pockets like crazy in our group and trying the proc on his new dagger.  I was designated puller.  I pull single spider, get add giant...add spider...not bad i'm thinking...i got a chanter and full group with 2 healers.  When lo and behold as i run back and see this on chat channel... "WTF...who trained us?  OMG...why do we have 3 spiders nuking us?"  Needless to say... I had to kite my mobs around for a bit until it was safe to run my pull back to group.  SoW drops...oh oh ...hit jboots ...wait...can't...WTF!!!  I'm ROOTED   ARGH.... Loading Please Wait..."    Needless to say..the group disbanded regrouped and rogue was no longer with us.  End of story.  <br><br>While this is not a definitive guide to pulling in the least, I am only mentioning some of the most important aspects that one should be aware of.  HOTKEYS and their use for rdy for pull, mana status, INC %T should be in every pullers social keys. <br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Excellent post.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like to add a few points from my own experience.  Keep in mind that I'm a 30 pally so this information may not apply to higher levels.  Also, in my experience the puller is very often the group leader so bear that in mind with these points.<br><br>1) First of all, nine times out of ten you're chosen as puller upon entering the dungeon.  Always start slow so the group can get its rythm.  Never zip by mobs you think won't agro.  I made this mistake recently in perma.  Nothing in the early parts of the dungeon agro'd me while soloing and I went charging to where I thought we'd have good hunting.  Next thing I know the 27 shammy is getting swarmed and 10+ greenie goblins chipped away our group.  We weren't ready and no one was assisting.  After that, three of the group members didn't want to go back in.  <br><br>2) Set the expectation.  I was in Paw recently and there were two other groups camping the front area, meaning we had to compete for spawns.  This can mean slightly more dangerous pulls or pulls that don't occur at the best possible times.  But the group that meds and heals to full after every pull is going to be beaten to the spawns every time.  I explained this to the casters and told them after each pull I was going right back out to look for the next one and that it was it up to *them* to tell me immediately after a pull if they needed a med break.  <br><br>What is the group's purpose?  Are you going after a particular loot or spawn?  Especially in a pickup group it's important to define this. <br><br>If you're going after xyz loot that is deap in the dungeon, tell the group up front.  "This is going to be tough.  We cannot afford a lot of AFKs.  Do any of you have to log soon?  etc."  Set the expectation early on.<br><br>3) Generally speaking, call the shots.  The puller is ussually the leader of the group and if no one else steps up for the job then assume it.  As puller you have the best information about spawn locations and the current danger level.  <br><br>In an easy and safe exp situation this isn't as crucial, but if you are dungeon crawling it is critical.  Democracy is just too slow to engage the group in every decision.  If you don't know the dungeon well then defer to the person that does.  But if you are reasonably confident in your knowledge then tell the group what to do, when to move, when to med etc.  <br><br>Are group members not playing their roles?  Again, depending on how safe your situation is this may not be a factor.  But if you've got a cleric attempting to melee and players are coming close to dying as a result, you need to speak up.  <br><br>I'll give an example of how some of this comes into play.  I was in the befallen key room (pre-nerf) with two other low 20s players.  ONE bad agro and we would have to run for it.  We had just taken down two tough spawns (yellows to us at the time) and were at about 40% hp and 20% mana.  I told them I was pulling from the hall and they asked me to hold off.  Knowing that the room was going to pop in four minutes, I knew that if i waited for us to med to full we'd be fighting 3 yellows with low health, and mana wasn't going to save us.  I explained this to them, we took down the yellow in the hall, healed/med'ed and were ready when the other two popped in the room.  <br><br>This example also brings up another important point: the best time to pull is *not* necessarily when everyone is at full hp and mana, and you will find that most dungeons have areas that will not allow this.  Knowing where these tough spots are in a dungeon comes with experience and research.<br><br>4) Get the feel of the group.  Again, a good puller/leader will always be mindful of the group's pulse.  If you've got people that are clearly panicky in dungeons (coughRangerscough) they're going to be unreliable in battle.  They likely won't quit on you but in a battle they won't fight their best.  <br><br>In addition, watch how the battle is going and what people are doing.  Is the caster not assisting you and nuking the other mob?  Since no one is dealing damage to the other mob that will almost gaurantee the caster will get agro'd.  Is another melee taunting the mob off you from the get go?  This is appropriate in some circumstances but ussually you keep the agro on the main tank/puller.  In most cases, if you are *not* the main tank or puller don't try to 'distribute' damage between yourself and him if you have a decent healer.  Now the healer has more to watch.  <br><br>Are the casters nuking too early?  I once grouped with a guy who would cook up a nuke timed to hit the mob I was pulling just as it came into the room before us melees could generate any agro.  Guess what happens next?  <br><br>If you, as puller and/or tank are not getting assisted let the group know.  If a caster or healer gets agro'd, you as main puller/tank immediately switch and taunt off.  Everyone else assists you.  If your first target was reasonably beaten down (say 50% or so) you might decide to switch back to the first target.  That's your call and depends on the situation.  But if you do switch targets, you should hotkey a social telling your group to re-assist you.  Casters are ussually meding and will not see you switch.  Now they stand up to nuke and pop the wrong target and get agro'd again.  <br><br>The other option is that just one of the melees breaks off the main fight to taunt off a caster and then rejoins once this is done.  This must be established in advance, and frankly only works in groups that play together regularly.  If that player dies or must back out of the fight, the other players need to know to do the taunting role.  This is ussually too much to expect from a pickup group.<br><br>5) Know the timer.  You don't need to know it to the second but know the timer.  If something pops in the room you're camping you want to have a reasonably good idea when.  It's simple: as soon as you kill it, glance over at the clock and write down the time.  When it pops again, you now know the spawn timer in most cases.  <br><br>The spawn timer is not the same througout the dungeon and may vary even with the same type of mobs.  For example, goblins at the front of permy have an incredibly long spawn timer.  In other areas it's 5 - 10 minutes.  <br><br>For dungeon crawling, it is absolutely crucial to know the spawn timer.  <br><br>6) Give the group info where appropriate.  Have you been pulling blues but are about to pull the 'king' mob who happens to be red?  Are you pulling casters this time instead of melees?  There is nothing worse than pulling a casting/healing mob that four melees can't take down but three good nukes at the right time would have allowed the group to get over the 'hump'.  But oops, you figured it was a single so you'd let the nukers med through this one.  <br><br>7) Switch views during the fight.  Hit f9 three times to get a good outside view.  Hit it again two times to return to normal.  By doing this you are able to spot adds or identify a healer/caster mob that you must switch too as soon as possible.  You can see if the casters get agro'd.  And ultimately, you will see when multiple adds arrive and you must run.  Being able to spot this even a few seconds earlier improves your groups chances of making it to the zone.  In my experience the average group takes at least three rounds of combat, but ussually around five, to realize they are in over their heads and need to run.  When you take into account nuking mobs, you can save your party hundreds to thousands of hit points if you make the call earlier.<br><br>8) Lastly, grow a thick skin.  In some camps I've pulled for hours consistently and reliably and generated a lot of exp and loot for the group.  But then I have one bad pull and a couple people die.  Now everyone is talking smack about me.  <br><br>I've taken people deeper in dungeons than they would have ever gone and gotten them back out in one piece, but because they almost died they complain.  Are they complaining when they auction off that item they won in EC for 200p?<br><br>I've had people call me 'bossy', 'type A', etc. when I tell people what to do, and I rarely do this unless it is necessary.  Mind you, doesn't matter what you tell people or how.  If the group is med'ing and some idiot just can't sit still and you warn him not to run around because he'll agro everything, now you're bossy.  <br><br>Well, re-reading this I realize I went off on some big time tangents but I hope some of this is useful to you.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
