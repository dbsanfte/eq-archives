Use whicherver you have a better weapon for at the time.  Souldragoon is right that under the dmg cap 1h is usually more effecient, but I know in my case I can do significantly more dmg using my Axe of the Iron back rather than my velious longsword (essentially a combine longsword, just cheaper).

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hmmmmm...soloing at lvl 30 in Mistmoore as a Paladin.  Been there, done that...or should I say TRIED that and it is a very risky proposition indeed. Why? Because you can rarely just pull one mob there, and often times get 4 or even 5 at a time.  If one of those is a caster-type, you are in trouble. If 2 are casters, forget about it.  The pathing is difficult and the Mobs take circumferential routes to get to you when you pull them, thereby gathering friends along the way.  They are also very close to other mobs in small groups of 2 or 3.  Without a Harmony, pulling is very hard.  You can handle most anything that spawns in the Lake area (including the Gargs by the Tower) at lvl 30 and won't even get XP for some of it, but you will rarely get the benefit of one on one combat. <br><br>My solo success has been strictly confined to the Lake/Ramp area and usually when there were other groups there that helped control the spawns, giving me my own little pocket of mobs to mess with.  I have also been the ONLY one in the zone many times, standing at the top of the ramp, trying and trying and trying again to pull just one or two mobs from the first ledge.  I have tried lull (which sucks), I have tried soothe with very little success....some, but not much. I usually just make my pull, realize both Gargs and the two Initiates on the ledge both aggroed because my Lull or Soothe didn't work, they usually pull the other two near the lake and they ALL come running up the ramp. Time to zone out. One note, however, sometimes, the Gargs are the LAST mob to leave the zone once you've zoned out. So if you're lucky, you can zone back in and catch one remaining Garg and fight him one on one.<br><br>Like I say, you can handle anything that spawns in the entrance or even the Grave Yard and with a Wurm you are well-equiped and can handle two maybe even three of the lesser fighter types (Initiates, pledges and sentrys) on your own, but the Casters are bad news and interspersed with the fighter mobs.  MM is known for its DEADLY trains. The reason being, you don't get to fight just one at a time.<br><br>Solo as a 30th lvl Paladin,  my opinion is I wouldn't recommend it an it would be restricted to the Lake/Ramp area. Even the GraveYard is off-limits.  Even if you could get to the graveyard on your own (and the only way you would do this would be if a group cleared the way for you or someone gives you Invis) you would find it tough if not impossible to hold. You won't be able to fight your way there by yourself, that's for sure. Maybe you could purchase some Invis potions and get in and out that way if you've got the cash, which it appears you do since you are wielding a Wurmslayer! After the Graveyard, just about every place else is off-limits as well. The Ancille Valley, the Castle Entrance area, and most certainly the castle itself. Even if you could get to it, you would scarcely get a foot in the door before you died, unless invised.  I'm afraid you're going to need some help for many lvls to come in MM. <br><br>Just my humble opinion as a member of the 31st Circle of Dwarven Paladins and a Twilight Brethren. If you prove me wrong, PLEASE post and let me and others know how you pulled it off!<br><br>Kneesmasher<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Your actually at the point I'm at.  However, for some suggestions, first get an Axe of the Iron Back and start working your 2hs.  You can usually find them for 60-70pp.  For a 1hs weapon, I'd suggest going with either a 1 handed silvery war axe or a pgt.  The war axe has a slightly better dmg/dly ratio, but the pgt has a decent proc.  Just go with whatever you can find cheaper on your server or whatever fits your playstyle.  Neither of these will hit for more than the 12 your hitting for now, but they have a signifigant reduction in delay will more than make up for it.  If you insist on doing more dmg, I've heard a crystilline fiber or some such (a whip of some kind), runs around 8dmg, 26dly. Armor wise, I have a mix of bronze and banded with some nice extras, including darkmail gauntlets, orc fang earrings, jagged bands, and a silvery plated bracer.  These items are generally fairly inexpensive and provide a great stat and AC boosts.  I hope this helps some.<br>Rathiel <br>17th Season Knight of Truth<br>Druizzil Ro<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Using it, I hit at my under 20 level max of 29. <br><br>For 1HB, I use the Shining Star of Light (28/6), its from a Cleric/Paladin quest and I consider it to be the first paladin holy weapon.  I haven't really been looking for another one yet, Im at level 15 and more intersted in a 1HS.<br><br>So looking through Allakhazam's, I found these 1HS I'm interested in.

It's time to get my second, the Falchion of Koada'Vie (6/24)MAGIC LORE ITEM. But without a group, me at lvl 16, may need to get some more exp first.<br><br>Other Options:<br>Gladius(7/29)MAGIC- Dropped from the Lessor Blade Fiend at the Estate of Undead.  This guy shows up randomly so there isn't a camp for it.  The place is just kinda bad news for lvl 17, but is doable.<br><br>Polished Granite Tomahawk (6/26) MAGIC LORE ITEM - Dropped in Highhold Pass on the gnoll Grenix Mucktail.  He spawns rarely on the gnoll ledge, so I heard.  This one has a beserker strength proc.  The Dwarvish Axe (6/26)may be an easier cheaper alternative, but it isn't magical or have the proc bonus.  The Dwarvish Axe can be obtained from a quest or Lord Darish in Crushbone(lvl17).<br><br>Barbed Leather Whip (7/28) MAGIC - can be obtained from Bonecracker in Najena (lvl 22)<br><br>Coldian Velium Long Sword (7/28) MAGIC Purchased from vendors in Velious<br><br>Except for not being magical, the racial crafted swords are really good.  Antonian Long Sword (8/28), Seafarer's Cutlass (7/23) and Koada'Dal Falchion (7/24) have rocking stats.

I use this skill on all MOBs with DS (Damage Shields), especially spiders in Kunark. <br><br>This spell must be cast before any offensive skills are cast on a MOB, otherwise you may cancel the effect of the previous spell cast.<br><br>Another use is to target yourself to remove adverse spells cast on you by the MOBs. This is not nearly as effective though. You are not able to select the effect that you want cancelled, hence you are usually deBuffing yourself.

Great for uping weapon skills cause they aren't hitting me really hard and I can take a lot of swings on them.  I can also solo the mournful undead(?) and a greater skele (?) there.  Sometimes I just hang around the entrance and work on my ward undead skill if there is a group pulling from the house to the entrance.

Go solo the death beetles at lvl 12, they should con black to high blue, and are not that hard to kill. Or you can just go to the Dervish camps in Nro with a good group there, you can get about 2 levels in a day or so.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I find it hard to believe that you are getting little or no experience in CB at lvl 12. It should easily keep you occupied into your later teens. I played there almost exclusively for more than 10 lvls without much difficulty getting XP at all. But I did run solo most of that time.  Perhaps you haven't ventured far enough into the zone?  Cents are probably starting to play out for you, but Legos and Emis should be right up your alley at 12th lvl and a good challenge to boot! If you have a regular group, maybe singular Legos pose little challenge, but try out the Throne Room! TONS of good experience there as a lvl 12 and more action than you or your party can handle. As a matter of fact, I would venture to say TR is a bit over your head, even in a group, if all of your group members are equal to your lvl.  And IF that's not enough for you, you can always venture up into the Tower, but I wouldn't recommend until post 15th lvl. Unless you are HEAVILY twinked out, Crush and the Prophet, not to mention DVinn, will be way too much for you.<br><br>Try the Slavers near the slave pits and the Taskmaster, or the Emi, Oracle and occasional Lego that spawn directly under the tower area in the alcove. The Oracle that spawns under the tower is especially nasty.  Good experience there too.  Also, don't just pass up the pawns that spawn. They are Placeholders for other mobs. Kill the pawns and give other bigger mobs a chance to spawn in their place. Don't just settle for the Cents. CB has much more to offer than that.<br><br>However, since CB is so crowded all the time, and if you are just plain tired of it, you can always venture into Butcherblock and hunt the Undead Pawns and such that spawn at the Chessboard, if you don't want to venture too far from home yet.  Unrest yard trash is a possibility with a group, but Unrest as a whole is still a bit over your head, not to mention the hazardous travel through the Cauldron to get there at your lvl and the trains that ravage through Unrest on a regular basis.<br><br>One more option that comes to mind, among many, would be North Karana and the local Beetles, Lions and Bears.  They are a bit over your head solo or maybe a good challenge from some of them, but with a group you can handle most of them. Just watch out for the Griffins, Griffawns and Grifeens, not to mention the occasional Hill Giants.  If you are bored with CB at lvl 12, then perhaps this would be right up your alley, along with the other options that have been mentioned before me.<br><br>Kneesmasher Ayebulger<br>31st Circle of Dwarven Paladins<br>Twilight Brethren<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

He's right about hittin unrest, and those trains can be very scary, expecially when those darkbone or greater barbed skele's start training into the tunnel, my suggestion is to get to lvl 15 b4 gopin ther so you have an undead damage spell.  Go to nro and camp dervs or oasis and hunt crocs and then head back to good ol' faydwer.  Clerics are much better suited for State of Unrest though, because by lvl 15 they can do about 90 damage per shot with Expulse Undead.  Good luck whoever is there now and whoever is goin there now.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I agree with Kneeman, Axes of Iron Back are a dime a dozen at east commons auction block(tunnel).  If you were in my server and send out an auction for the axe, I'd probably sell you mine for 50pp.  I'm not sure cuz I haven't tried selling mine, but Axe of Iron Back, BiBs, 2hand practice sword, and other similar weapons are selling so cheap now a days.  <br><br>I'm fortunate enough that I started out in a server with a lot of battled hardened, high level paladins.  Some of them would come up to newbie palys and assist them in whatever way and some would actually give them mediocre weapons and other items, for free!  <br><br>Just like what everyone would tell me when I post a question on this message board, sometimes you just have to stick it out and hope for good fortune comes your way, hopefully soon.  It does eventually, if you play enough. Most of the time it happens when you least expect it.<br><br>I'd would also like to take this opportunity to thank all those high level paladins(there is a lot of them)and this website in particular that helped me out during my newbie days.  I would've given up on this game if it wasn't for them.  I can't think of a better class that would actually give you the feeling of being part of the world of Norrath.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Yes, your trouble is mostly allocated with you being on a new server, so many of those items will not be auctioned, because they are worth more to the person who gets them than to sell them. Plus, an Axe of the iron Back is one of the most twinked item in the game. Since it is worth more than 150pp or so, people dont sell it often, they just twink with it, thats why you dont see it being auctioned. With you being on a new server, i say to wait a couple of weeks, start a new character, and look until you see one being auctioned, and it will probably be for more than it is worth, A LOT more.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>As i read through these posts and i have read easily 90% of them I listen to advice about how to acquire this weapon or that weapon and watch the auction screen and so on, while i do all that and i have never seen an axe of ironback auctioned or to be honest I've not seen any item specific weapon on the auction block. I have looked in every zone and asked other fellow paladins of higher lvl than i in those zones and i get the same thing they don't know where i can find any weapn either (I.E. 2 hand practice sword, axe of ironback, mithril 2 hander). I mean most of these Paladins are in their mid 20 lvls and no idea where to purchase the item or anything like that. I have a feeling it is partially due to the fact i am on the Vazaelle server is that possible? Could the fact i am on a new server be why i am finding it more difficult to obtain these weapons? I had to bite the bullet and buy a 2hs from gypsie for 116pp because it was the only way i could get a weapon to kill wisps with any kind of efficiency with. What should i do next?

	   <tr><td colspan=2>At your level, fairy dust should not be a problem for you to aquire.  The fairy "city" is along the left wall as you exit out of mistmoore.  All of the fairies can drop dust.  The safest thing to do is stay away from the "city" and kill the maidens that hang out around the perimeter.  A gnomish robot named "Gearheart" protects the fairy princess at the center of the mushroom ring (the city).  I'm able to handle all of them at level 40, but I wasn't able to at level 35.  I've killed fairies for a couple of hours at a time and collected 4 stacks of dust.  Just remember that you can only have one soil of underfoot at a time because it is lore.  If you don't feel like killing the fairies, they usually sell for 10 pp if people are selling them in lesser or greater fay.<br><br>As for getting granite (I assume that's what you meant by "handling mistmoore"), the safest spot to get some is at the enynti spawn.  She spawns along with 2 gargoyles.  Half of the time the goyles that spawn are sneering or grinning (which don't drop granite).  You would need an invis to get to this spawn, so try to find an enchanter who can use the gloves that enynti drops.  They are needed for their incandescant gloves.  The quickest way to get granite is to get a group together and raid the castle.  For some strange reason, though, I've always found it difficult to get people together for mistmoore.  It's a wonder that I managed to get my hilt of soulfire.<br><br>And as for the plague sharks...  heh, good luck on that one.  I have yet seen anyone with vambraces of ro or seen them auctioned.  I have made it a point to get the help of a tracker when I get back on Feb 14.  I will be the first person I know who has em.  =P  There are better pieces out there, but darnit, it'll just be kewl to have people see them on me.  "WOW!  You got em!" they'll say...  heh heh heh...<br><br>Souldragoon Flamingheart<br>40th circle Paladin of Virtue<br>Fennin Ro<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Follow virtue, and the virtuous will follow you.</i></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hmmm....the age old question of handling Mistmoore! I too have had my share of troubles in MM.  MM is indeed a tricky but wonderful zone. As hard as it is, I love it!! There are some good guides out on the web (Search on Yahoo for Mistmoore) but they mostly deal with the entrance ramp, lake and corner area, touch briefly on the Ancille Valley past the tunnel and the Grave Yard, but speak very little about inside the Castle itself, with the exception of the Maid and Butler area on lvl 1.  <br><br>Here's how I got my 5 pieces of MM granite to date and what I've learned about MM so far.<br><br>Piece 1: Got it when I was low 20's hunting in the Lake Area when a higher lvl trained a near-dead Flouting Garg to zone. My group killed it and since I was the only Paladin I got the granite. At the time, to be honest, I didn't even know what it was for, but took it when someone said it was a Pally Ro Armor quest item. Little did I know how hard it REALLY was to come by!<br><br>Pieces 2-5: I gathered a group of near 30's, went into the GY behind the crypt, cleared the Jail area through the secret walls, then pulled the first few spawns on the stairs to the Jail, this includes the Avenging Caitiff when he/she/it spawns.  Once the stairs were partly cleared, we slowly worked up the stairs, killing along the way, making sure NOTHING ran and got away (kinda hard with all the corners on the stairway) and finally ended up in the Torture Chamber room.  While working up the stairs, if a mob runs from you and goes DOWN the stairs the way you just came up, give chase because you know the area is clear. If it gets away and runs UP, see my advice below about escaping Mobs.  <br><br>Up two short flights of stairs from the Torture Chamber is a small landing area with three hallways and 2 Gargs perched in their alcoves. The landing is just down the hall from the Spa room.  You can pull these Gargs to the Torture Chamber and fight them there (preferred) or you can fight them on the landing, but risk attracting the attention of other more loathesome beasts nearby.  These Garge drop the granite regularly (not every time but it's certainly not rare).  If all goes well, and no other groups screw up your camp, (which happens A LOT) you can hold this rather precarious camp for quite sometime.  Occasional wanderers and local spawns will pop that you have to deal with, but as long as you SNARE and ROOT EVERY SINGLE MOB, EVERYTIME you should be able to hold it for a while. <br><br>More words of caution, WHEN (not if, but WHEN) a mob does finally get away from you, through resisting 3 roots in a row, a bad pull or whatever, don't hesitate, don't think about it, EVAC! You will thank me later.  If a Mob gets away, NOTHING good is going to come from it, you are NOT going to get lucky, you WILL soon be swamped by big bad mobs, so might as well get out in that short calm lag time between mob escape and impending doom. Clear this with your group before you ever get to the EVAC point.<br><br>One of the hardest parts is keeping restless party members from wandering or looking around when camped in the Torture Chamber or anywhere in or near the Castle. It can get slow between spawns, but wandering is death.  Simple as that. If you move, you MUST move as a group, except for the puller.<br><br>To EVAC from this area in the absence of a Caster who can do it the easy way, you can move down the flights of stairs (I think two quick flights) and out onto the bridge that spans between the Tower directly adjacent to the bottom of the ramp area and lake area and the main castle area.  (You see this bridge everytime you enter MM and go down the ramp. It is on your right!) From this bridge you can JUMP to the left side, land where the two Initiates spawn on the ledge by the ramp area, and quickly run up the ramp to the zone.  Keep in mind, you will take damage when you jump. I have taken as much as 80 pts jumping, so make sure you can survive the fall. By Evacing this way you train much fewer mobs, immediately escape those mobs that were chasing you (they won't jump) and save those people at the zone some heartburn as well.<br><br>I have had pretty good success with this approach but have never been able to hold this camp indefinitely. I have always been forced out by one factor or another.  But it can be good while it lasts.<br><br>More MM information, about 7pm many of the "normal" mobs turn into Undead mobs and stay that way til about 8am the next morning, game time. ALWAYS check the time, keep track of it, and adjust spells, change weapon to Ghoulbane or whatever when it is appropriate.  Will Sappers, Thought Corrupters, etc. are all Undead. Most people hate them, as a Paladin, I love'em. Between Ghoulbane and Expulse Undead, I fight them better than anything else. I'm sure you would agree.<br><br>For the melatite and fairy dust, you can just buy them if you have the cash. Many people hunt the fairies. I chose not to and bought my dust.  I can't help with the Plague Sharks yet...haven't tried it to date.<br><br>Good luck to you and look me up! I'm there most of the time.<br><br>Kneesmasher Ayebulger<br>30th Circle of Dwarven Paladins<br>Twilight Brethren<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well, you are about the level where Paladins get a little frustrating, but a lot more fun. Personnally, you are in quite good shape, 34 levels in 4 months is fairly quick leveling, it took me 6 months to get to lvl 35 respectivaly. Ro armor is a good way of getting fast cash, but the quest dealing with plauge sharks is probably the hardest Ro. I got lucky, and got the greave mold and the boot mold fairly quickly, those are the real common ones. A good way of getting MM granite is to wait in MM till you see around 15 high level people in zone, then ask for them to send you a tell if any granite drops. I remember getting about 20 tells in 5 mins because an uber guild was there for a LONG time. I also got some dark pauldrons, which are the items for the Ro Breastplate mold. quite handy indeed, so if you do manage to get 2 pauldrons, do that quest instead of anything else, BP's sell like hotcakes. After you have that, you may be able to ask someone to kill fairies for you in Lfay or Gfay, since they arent that hard, and loot their fairy dusts, if you dont want the faction hits. Everything else is easy to obtain except the Melatite from SolA, that is the hardest part of Ro from my experience, its uncommon, and everything in SolA aggroes cept the gnomes. After you get the Ro, you can sell it for about 1k per peice. As an alternative, you can get some great cash and exp in Lower Guk, now that you may be high enough to hunt there. You can camp the assasin or the savant, and pull from all areas, common drops are FS armor, words, runes, and some good pp for cash on bodies. Also, the savant drops the enameled black BP, which sells for around 1k too, and is not lore, so you can just get one, then go camp it again with a different group, and get another one. You may want to upgrade armor before you upgrade your weapon, and if you do follow this guide, be able to get a couple of peices of Ro within maybe 2 weeks, and some rare Lguk drops in that time too. Armor upgrades that are good for your level- Rygorr, Ro, Assorted peices of Sentry armor, Rare drops like the Dwarven Work Boots, All rare tank armor drops in LGuk. Weapon upgrades- Wurmslayer, Ghoulbane( if you dont already have one, which you should), Mith 2hander, Worn Crescent Axe( if you find a great deal froma desperate person), El;ectrum Bladed Whatchamacallit( buy fangs, do quest in MM), Blade of Xalgoz, Nathsar Greatsword. These are all assuming you have upwards of 3k+ in the bank.<br>Zomor-bertoxx<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Another good suggestion for money is the bandit quest in W. Karanas.  The bandits here will drop bronze weapons fairly frequently, and a bandit sash almost but not quite as often as the orcs drop belts in cb.  These can be turned in to the thunder paladins guild in qeynos for bronze weapons and a decent amount of coin, upwards of 1-2pp.  I did this yesterday with my lvl pally, and made about 60pp in about 3 hrs.  At lvl 20 you should be able to handle just about anything the camps throw at you, just be careful if you attract more than one male half elf.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The above information about granite in the graveyard is incorrect. No granite drops in the graveyard. The red Imp spawns there but he doesn't drop granite and is not a gargoyle. The imps two drops are the sacrifical dagger (common) and the bloodstone eyepatch (rare).  There are NO Gargoyles that spawn in the graveyard at all....ever, and gargoyles are the ONLY mobs that drop the granite. And more specifically, it drops from Flouting, Leering and Jeering gargoyles. I have never seen it drop from a Sneering or Grinning Gargoyle, but thats not to say it NEVER happens. It would just be extremely rare.  Maybe you encountered a Gargoyle in the GY that was trained there and it happened to drop granite for you.<br><br>You will get NO granite by camping the graveyard in MM unless someone trains a Garg there for you to kill.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>------------------------------<br>Things we absolutely need<br>------------------------------<br><br>1.  We need higher defensive skills.  As it stands, a warrior friend of the same level has much better AC than me, unbuffed and without a shield.  He is wearing mostly crafted, some Indo.  I am wearing Valorium BP/Legs and Deepwater everything else.  As suggested before, 245 would be nice.<br><br>2.  Scrap Holyforge.  It's a waste of a discipline, frankly.  I would like so see a gimped version of Defensive at 60, and Sanctification at 55.  This would allow us to participate at Venril Sathir at the same level as everybody else (Sanctification <i> does</i> block his lifetap, right?).<br><br>3.  MOBs should be able to be interrupted in casting, although not stunned, with bashes and stuns.  A CHeal on Vox usually starts when she's pretty low.  Trak attempts to gate at very low health.  Usually around less than 10%, which is 3200 HP on these mobs.  Ten percent of King Tormax is 100 000 HP (supposedly).  Ouch?  Although he doesn't gate, this is just an example.<br><br>------------------------------<br>Things that would be really nice<br>------------------------------<br><br>1.  I would like to see Gorenaire and Talendor always drop Vox and Nagafen books, respectively.  That goes for the bard and warrior scales too.  I mean honestly, if you can get a team together to gank Gorenaire, you <i> deserve</i> your epic.<br><br>2.  I would like to see Superior heal at 54, and Remedy at 57 or 58.  As Druids may be getting healing upgrades, I'd like to see minor upgrades for us too.<br><br>3.  I saw somebody suggest that we be able to use the Block skill while using a shield.  I don't see this as difficult to code, as bash can only be used with a shield, by large races, or with an epic.  This might help our tanking abilities when that's what needed of us instead of damage.<br><br>4.  Divine Strength bumped to an earlier level?  The ranger buff at 50 seriously makes DS look like a marginal improvement, ten levels later.<br><br>5.  Change the Defender back to an all-or-nothing proc.  And make it stun for 2 seconds, just so we can feel special that it made a difference.<br><br>6.  Flame of Light needs a graphic and sound.<br><br>7.  The Fiery Defender should always be visible, like the ranger and shadowknight epics.  As it stands, people with particles off (read: everybody) see you swinging around your Hilt 'O Death with no blade.<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>Comments?<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Praetor</b>, 60th Crusader<br>Avatars of Discord</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I was just reading a post from another message board about this level 18 paly asking help on what weapon to buy.  His problem is "I have 1k to spend but I don't know which weapon to buy". <br>I am a level 20 paladin and I have played the game honestly(I don't know about smartly though).  That means no twinks and power leveling.  At level 20, I can't recall having more than 300pp in the bank.  I have made some plats but after all the upgrade and dressing up, i cant seem to save pp that much.  I currently have BiBs for 2hs and crystal fiber for 1hs and both cost for merely a little over 100pp.  I wouldn't mind doing quests for good weapons but if I have the resources of acquiring them safely and quickly, then it would be a no-brainer, heck yah I'm gonna buy them! <br>I've also done all the easy-money stuff, GLS quests, lego pads, cb belts...etc and I know there is a lot of twinking going on of which I don't really care for that much. Even being in unrest, all that loot and go to bank does get old after a while.<br>Now, if there is a way of getting 1k at level 18 faster and without twinking, I'd be sporting me a ghoulbane and a faster 2hs weapon.  If any of you knows of a way to get that kind of cash at that level, how and where, I would very much like to hear from you.<br>Other than that, this game rules!!!<br><br>Good Journey to you all,<br>Fellow Paly<br>20th season<br>Cazic Thule server<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well, some people may have twinked, some just may have gotten extremely lucky with things dropping, and some may have spent over 2 weeks getting money. If you have just been playing through the levels, you should have at LEAST 300pp with the good weapons you have. Since you are lvl 20, the BIBS is a good sword for you to use, and you DO have another good 1hs. Remember, at your lvl, you will hit for a lot more than 20 or so with the BIBS. That should be good for you till about lvl 25 or so. If you do want to make some money+ leveling at your level, i suggest going to Highpass, and making a gnoll group. There are Ringmail drops here, and rawhide armor. Also, you have a chance at a great shield + a good sword if you hunt a bit here. youll prolly want to keep the sword and the shield if you get them, the shield should last through 35 or so, your *New*, hopefully 1hs sword should last you through about lvl 25, where you can sell that for a bit, and maybe buy something else. Also, if you REALLY want to be frugal, get a guide to Lguk, and shout there for someone to tell you if shin greaves drop. Those are fairly good, no drop legs, and you MIGHT be able to get Shin Guantlets while you are there. If you pick up these, you can sell your old stuff for a few pp or some good pp. If you see someone leave stuff on a corpse of something you cant kill, loot it, there will be most likely some FS weapons or something. At your level, the only real good "easy-cash" method is GLS quest. And that just SUCKS doing it. If you work hard enough though, you might be able to get up near 1kpp in about a week of 3 hours playing periods. Thats all my advice, besides, if you work towards making levels, you will probably be able to get loot along with that. Dont give up, the road is hard but the payoff is good. Last advice-SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR LATER WHEN YOU REALLY NEED IT, BELIEVE ME!<br>Zomor-bertoxx<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

To give you an idea about money, I spent around 3 hrs doing this the other day with my lvl 18 paladin and made about 60pp.  Plus, I find it a little more interesting than the wisp quest.  <br>Rathiel<br>18th Season Knight of Truth<br>Druizzil Ro<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Anyways, answering your question, DEFINATLY keep the BIBS, just go to Crushbone and collect some CB belts and sell them for 1pp each. when you have maybe 30pp or so, buy a shiny brass shield(best newbie easy to obtain shield in the game), and a mino axe. then just practice both each level until they max out. This way you have more opportunities to buy great deals and actually be able to use the weapons you buy. You will be able to beat the crap out of a lvl 30 giant with a weighted axe for the opening blow, and then rip him apart after that with a faster 1hs+shield combo that you keep in store.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Paladins can be soloed, but equipment is your key to success. Right now, I have a paladin that just hit 35 on bristlebane (Diovan).<br><br>I think the biggest factor to me soloing better in lake of ill omen (I went there at lvl21 and had a lot of downtime) was that I was able to get my hands on a mithril 2hander (21 dmg, 28 dly with haste factored in (haste is the effect on the weapon, not from fbss or anything)). I got it at lvl25 and I've been much more effective at soloing since then. My armor is pretty good too (mostly strength boosts, but some dex/wis/etc in there). <br><br>Anyway, most of my items came from chance encounters with a couple of high level folks. If you're not as lucky, still don't give up. Save as much money as you can and first go for a better weapon (the lowest delay, highest damage you can afford). delay always makes a difference, because you want to kill the mob as quick as you can.<br><br>Get an axe of iron back (16dmg, 37dly or something like that -- been using it until lvl25). it's better than your forged blade, and you can get one for around 100pp. that's the quickest solution to your weapon problem if you don't have a lot of cash to spare.<br><br>A good way to make money is to make your way to east/west commons and collect greater lightstones off willowisps. They're rare drops, but you can sell them to people for around 5-6pp each. even better, go to oasis and you can give them to a certain gypsy (forgot the name). Not only do you get exp, but you get an item (a container, so make sure you have an open general slot), which you can sell back to the gypsy for around 7-8pp. Another thing is to collect high quality bear pelts off kodiaks. These are much more rare, but they go for 30-40pp each.<br><br>at 16...I would tell you to hunt in oasis, but that zone is overcrowded a lot of times (at least it was on bristlebane). it's kinda risky too, because everything other than crocodiles/caimans aggro on you.<br><br>a strategy you might try using (if you have root, but I don't know if you get that yet), is to root your opponent if you're running low on hp, back up a bit, and heal yourself. you could even med too until root breaks (so move back a bit and make sure nothing else will jump you). it's hard to tell when root will break (if it even holds), so always be prepared.<br><br>and ac/agi is important more than anything for armor (strength is nice for the extra damage, but it's not that noticeable unless you have over +20 extra strength). agi will help you dodge hits more; I think ac just makes successful hits do less damage (I don't see how it will help you to avoid hits if you're wearing heavy, high ac armor).<br><br>I've said a lot of crap, and I'm not sure how much of it is helpful, but I hope you got something out of it. Take care and have hope.<br><br>Diovan (Bristlebane)<br>Feresta (The Rathe)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I am also on a PvP server, which adds even more trials.  As a note, When solo, I gain XP faster than I do in a group, and that is saying something.  With LOH and your healing spells, you have the equivilent of 3x your HP in your use.  Equipment is very key.  Always get the best you can.  I am not the best equipped, but Im not that bad off.

The weapons damage is a no brainer in its importance.<br><br>So for example a level 15 paladin like me has a Blackened Iron Bastard sword (20/48).  My skill is maxed (5+5*lvl) at 80.  My strength is 102. <br><br>Max = ((102+80)/100)*20)+0<br>Max = 36<br><br>But thats funny, I usually hit for 29.  Well since I'm under level 20, I have a twink cap at 29.  I can't hit harder until I reach level 20.<br><br>I love that sword, it was a gift to me when I formed our guild.  But the damage it can do is very misleading.  Its delay is so slow, what happens if I miss.  Or if I miss twice?  When I'm in a group and we're taking on something pretty mean, that could happen.<br><br>I'm not sure if a lower damage/lower delay weapon would be better.  I usually use my lower delay weapons to work on skill level.<br>&nbsp;<br>This is the way, grasshopper.</td></tr>

You are on the brink of making an amazing discovery: double attacks at 20 and new spells at 22!  So stick it out and reap the rewards! Don't give up or be too concerned until you have reached your rights of passage, had your damage cap removed, and have the opportunity to add that last name if you so desire.  And whatever you do, don't compare yourself to a Warrior. They will soon be or are out-distancing you on damage.<br><br>My personal experience was to see my damage jump from regular 29pt hits with my Axe of the Iron Back, to 35-37 points once I reached 20th lvl, almost like someone flipped a switch! It was instantaneous<br><br>However, it does make a difference on the weapon. Like my earlier post (Damage vs Speed) mentions, my Deepwater Harpoon has a damage of 18 but I rarely hit for 50pts with it. My 2-hs Practice Sword has a damage of 19 (only 1 pt more) but I routinely hit for 56 and 57 points of damage with it! Why the difference due to one single damage point difference? I have no idea....but it's true.  The Practice Sword is a bit slow for me, so I use my Harpoon as my primary 2-hs.  But it recently came in very handy while in Sol A where the low blue/high green gobs SWARM all over you! Hard to beat the Thistle Shield in those situations.<br><br>Stay true to the cause, persevere, and reap the rewards!<br><br>Kneesmasher Ayebulger<br>30th Circle of Dwarven Paladins<br>Twilight Brethren<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

You will probably get 1k-2k just for two levels because the drops there are so good. I also say that you might want to save up your pp, you WILL need it for later. But you could buy a Wurmslayer if you do get like 500 more pp, and sell your ghoulbane. But buy the scales and then do the quest, better deal for you. Also, if your hard for cash, you can sell the Wurmslayer you got for 5k or so, than buy the scales again for 3.5k and do the quest again, gaining you 1.5k easily!<br>Zomor-bertoxx<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I don't exactly have the stats of these charactes before me, so I don't know the comparison, but if someone would be kinda enough to reply, I'd like to know what the best idea might be as for which combination of race and Paladin.  Along with this reply, I'd hope someone would give me a good idea as to what stat might I want to pump my extra character creation points into.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>As a Dwarven Paladin, I will undoubtedly be slanted towards thinking Dwarven Paladins are the best! My little guy ROCKS and I love playing him. If you want to run the BEST Character/Class combination, then I would say a Dwarf is the way to go! However, you should play what you feel most comfortable and happy with, NOT what the best combination of stats is.  You will not be happy with your character otherwise.  If you think an Erudite Paladin or Half-Elf Paladin is best, run one of those.<br><br>In keeping with your question, let me point out that dwarves start with an Agility stat of 70. If your agility stat is below 75, you receive a 50 pt. Armor Class deduction/penalty! So if you do start a Dwarf, make sure you put those all-important 5 points into Agility. I'd split the rest between Strength and Wisdom, skip Intelligence and Charisma all together, and if you really wanted to, throw a point or two into Dex, but that's not really necessary. With any odd points I'd throw them into Strength.  Remember, you will be looked upon as a tank, so Armor Class is king!

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Okay all you Paladins out there, I thought I would start a new thread and get everyone's opinion on the subject of damage of a weapon versus speed of a weapon. While I think we all agree that there is a subjective line, somewhere out there, where damage vs speed is a trade off! The trick is to maximize that trade-off with the right weapons. Since there are few high damage weapons with short delays, you have to make a decision eventually regarding which weapon you want to use, and there are lots to choose from.  To start the ball rolling, I will begin with my current arsenal of weapons.<br><br>(1)Deepwater Harpoon: 18 damage, 40 delay, +5 wisdom, +5 stamina, weight of 13, damage per second rating: 9.25. I hit in the upper 30's to mid 40's with this weapon regularly at 30th lvl.  The Wisdom plus is nice and since it's 2-hs and kinda heavy the stamina is always a plus! No doubt about it, it is a nice well-rounded pally only weapon! It is my primary 2-hs weapon. <br><br>(2)2-handed Practice Sword: 19 damage, 47 delay, Weight 10, damage per second rating: 8.30, Procs Shield of Thistles!  I like this weapon, even though it is on the slow side, because it hits like a ton of bricks and procs the damage shield! I hit in the mid 50's with this weapon regularly, even though it is only one damage point more than the Harpoon.  I use this weapon when there is a very good chance of fighting multiple mobs where you will be getting hit from all sides. This works well with lower lvl mobs that swarm but not so well on higher ones. I will probably sell this weapon soon.<br><br>I prefer to fight 2-h slash, and I used the Axe of the Ironback for 10+ lvls and finally moved on;<br>but as we all know, there are lots of times where a BASH is necessary and 1-hs is the way to go. My current 1-hs weapon is: (and YES, that's singular):<br><br>Ghoulbane: Damage 15, Delay 34, Weight 9.5, Damage per second: 9.12, Special Proc of Dismiss Undead!  I use this weapon exclusively for my 1-hs duties.  When fighting undead, there is no equal, at least not that can be attained at my level. The Dismiss Undead Procs for 152 points at lvl 30, along with your regular slash.  I have actually had the sword proc TWICE back to back on a double attack where I did 342 pts of damage to the poor Carrion Ghoul in a single round!  I regularly hit in the mid 30's with this weapon. It is a good 1-hs weapon all around, no doubt about it, and against undead, WATCH OUT! I will keep it til I have to turn it in on my Fiery Avenger/Defender quest, whichever it is. And then I will go back and attempt to get another one! <br><br>My ultimate 1-hs, at least for the foreseeable future, is a Wurmslayer, but I can't realistically afford that yet. My ultimate 2-hs for the foreseeable future is a Mithril 2-hander but I can't afford that either! <br><br>Okay, let the discussion begin! I would like to preface the discussion by: LETS BE REALISTIC! I don't want to hear about how you got a Jade Inlaid Crescent Axe at 7th lvl and it's awesome, or how you used to use Ghoulbane while in your teens but you traded it for a Wurmslayer at 19th and are now looking for a weapon that does over 30 pts of damage since you are now 23rd level!  If you EARNED your weapons, I'd like to hear from you!  Looking forward to the discussion....<br><br>Kneesmasher Ayebulger<br>30th Circle of Dwarven Paladins<br>Twilight Brethren<br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>There is post by PraetorFenix that explains this as well.  This is my take of the stuff from lvl 15 paladin.  Anyways, I already typed it by the time I noticed Praetor's post.<br><br>I read this post about max damage: <br><a href="http://eqforge.com/forums/Forum16/HTML/008833.html" target=_new>http://eqforge.com/forums/Forum16/HTML/008833.html</a><br><br>It said that max damage is: <br>MAX = [((Weapon Skill + Strength)/100) * (DMG)) + (Level Damage Bonus)] <br><br>Level Damage Bonus = (Level - 25)/3 <br><br>I didn't care as much about the formulas, but I was intersted in the relationship of strength and weapon skill and the role they played.  I find the formulas to be pretty accurate, but not right on the money. It is really geared for people lvl 30 or above.<br><br>That article suggests that one's weapon skill + strength are determining factors in damage. The weapons damage is a no brainer in its importance. <br><br>So for example a level 15 paladin like me has a Blackened Iron Bastard sword (20/48). My skill is maxed (5+5*lvl) at 80. My strength is 102. <br><br>Max = ((102+80)/100)*20)+0 <br>Max = 36 <br><br>But thats funny, I usually hit for 29. Well since I'm under level 20, I have a twink cap at 29. I can't hit harder until I reach level 20. <br><br>My 1hs is a forged long sword and my 1HB is the Shining Star.  Hmmm, lets see what do I use? The Blackened Iron Bastard sword.  The other ones work, but are used more to up weapon skill.<br><br>This is what I've been doing.  I carry around my blackend sword at all times.  If I'm working on skill level, I'll switch out my 2HS for the round shield and long sword.  But if I find my self getting in trouble, then I whip out big daddy and let him take care of business:)<br><br>I love that sword, it was a gift to me when I formed our guild. But the damage it can do is very misleading. Its delay is so slow, what happens if I miss. Or if I miss twice? Some mobs are just more agile or dexterous than other mobs.  Their level compared to mine is also a factor.  A question is, if I miss 30% of the time with the long delay two hander, will I also miss 30% of the time with a short delay weapon? <br><br>If I do, then the answer is pretty easy, I would chose whatever weapon gave me the most damage in a given time period.<br><br>I have no idea of how people determine damage per second. So I can do an easier example.  Lets use my Blackened Iron Bastard sword and my Shining Star of Light.  Using the above formula, I expect to get 11 damage max from the Shining star of Light and 29 damage max from the sword.  Lets assume that I will hit max of both and connect 70% of the time.<br><br>Since the Shining Star is twice as fast as the Blackened bastard sword, it will hit 14 times out of 20 swings, while the bastard sword hits 7 times out of 10 swings in the same time period.<br><br>Shining Star total dam = 14*11 = 154<br>Blackend Sword tot dam = 7*29 = 203<br><br>This doesn't take into account bash.  Lets say, I bash for 6, hitting 70% of the time, and bash is used once every 3 swings of the shining star, we can assume 3-4 bashes at 6dmg.  That helps some, but not enough.<br><br>I find from my experience, that my blackened sword is just better while soloing and often during grouping. Althougth the numbers I'm using does not use hits that are below max damage and assumes that the hit/miss ratio is equal, the max damage of those weapons are accurate.  So don't flame me cause of the numbers, its just speculation.<br><br>In groups I find that sometimes, the blackened sword isn't too effective.  Since groups take on bigger and badder things than soloing, I find when I miss, I'm missing big.  Sometimes 3 times in a row.  If fighting trains or longer fights, then its works good, but if the fight is short and quick, I often find that I really didn't contribute enough damage.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>This is the way, grasshopper.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Yeh, I agree with earning the Ghoulbane "the righteous way", more like "the Paladin way".  That is to actually go in Upper Guk and hack and slash your way through Lord Shin and hope nobody other than Paladins are camped there, and also that he may actually drop the sword the first time you kill him who happens to be a fellow paladin.  What is up with that?  Like everyone keep saying it should be a no drop item.  <br><br>Anyway, I'm a level 19 paly who happens to have a whip for a weapon.  I'm using the Crystal Fiber for my 1 hand slash(8dmg, 26dly).  Its fast,it hits almost consistently around 16-18 and you get bash(SBS) on top on that.  I dig this weapon.  This should at least be good enough until I get ghoulbane, thats if I have enough time to spend in frogland(annoying sound) and kill a fellow paladin.<br><br>As for my 2hs weapon, I thought Blackened Iron Bastard Sword(BIBS-20dmg, 47dly) was better than my Axe of Iron Back(16dmg-37dly).  At level 16, I was hitting in the upper 20's.  The delay wasn't noticeable, so I stuck with the higher damage.  <br><br>Somehow I prefer the 1hs/shield combo, it gives me more of a paladin feel to it.  Having a shield makes it more heroeic(spelled right?) as well.  It seems like if you add up all the damages, you get more from a faster weapon.  <br><br>So that's my 2coppers and I hope to see you all in Norrath duking it out with the mobs.  Later!<br>BTW, I bought all my weapons with the money I made from every low level mobs that nobody wants to fight, just like all the non-twinkers.<br><br>Cya,<br>Level 19 Paly<br>Cazic thule<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Nice post Kneesmasher, i also used a ghoulbane at lvls 28-35. It is a good weapon, and since i was an idiot and didnt train in 2hs, i never used any 2hs weapons. Ghoulbane at your level rocks for fighting undead creatures, it procs easy, almost never resisted, has a good dps ratio, and has a great proc. Granted, that 2hs you use is a great weapon,but when you get a Wurmslayer, it will make that look like a rusty weapon. One way to get it is to sell your ghoulbane and 2h practice sword, and hopefully youve been saving up around a k or so, buy the scales used for the Wurmslayer quest. Go do the quest, get your wurmslayer, and revel in the fact of that you ripped someone off SOOOOOOOOOOOOO badly. I used to hit in the high 70's and low 80's consistently when i was lvl 36. Even a Mith2hander cant do that. Trust me, Wurmslayer is worth the price you might pay for it, it does WAYYYYYYY more damage than a Mith 2hander, besides the delay. Plus, you get bash and some more stat adjustment plus ac from a shield. Also, dont try to go get the ghoulbane the "honorable" way, because at lvl 30, you need a full group of 35's to just get that far into the dungeon if you are KoS. And hunting the Shin lord WILL make you KoS in Uguk. this means that whenever you want to go to Lguk for some cash or stuff, you will have to clear everything in your way, hence you destroy your faction with live frogs forever. Not good. Also, i think that you should keep that 2hslash up wit that weapon, when you are not the main tank, i suggest using that instead of Wurm, just for keeping skills up. What else- ah yes, i would definatly take damage over speed weapons. My reasons are if you have a dmg shielded apponent, hence almost every single thing in a non cleared dungeon, you wont get hurt that bad, but youll kill yourself with speed weapons. Also, doing more damage at once is a better taunt then doing a lot of damage over time. Back to GB, if you stick with your levels, cash will flow, and youll be able to buy more stuff. You can also do Ro at your level, its INCREDIBLE exp then, each thing for a mold turned in is a bub of exp. Than you can sell Ro for money hence being able to buy better stuff. As for 2hs, i would keep yours for now, until you can go do Soulfire. Ok, i think i went a lil overboard, but what the hay. Bomb me if ya want hehe.<br>Zomor-bertoxx<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I started tings out Focusing primary on a 1HS and Bash combo.  This being my first character and on a relatively new server (it was new the day I first logged on) so Ghoulbane and Wurmslayer were not as readily available as on other servers, and I didn't have the plat for them either (still don't either :) ).<br><br>I decided in my mid-teens that a lower delay and a decent damage combo would be best for me so that I could increase my skill levels faster and maximize the time to learn several skills before the next level was upon me. (I was leveling from 15-27 at around once per day).<br><br>1) One handed slash - started out with a Fine Steel Long Sword (6dmg/28 delay- I think).  Grabbed a Minotuar Battle axe at lvl 8 (8dmg/38 delay).  And am currently using a Crystalline Blade- fogot the stats but am hitting at roughly 26 per swing.  My Shield has stayed the same during this entire time (a Shiny Brass Shield) which I plan to upgrade one of these days.  I bash with the shield constitantly at 9 hp per bash.<br><br>2) Two handed slash- I didn't start using a 2 handed sword/axe until around level 12 when a friend traded me for 3 DF belts a Giant Tree Flayer (10 damage/ 41 delay). I wasn't happy with it, all it was good for was to kill willowisps for the GLS.  I bought a Axe of the Iron Back (16dmg/37delay) at lvl 20 and am currently using it to this day.  <br><br>I try to keep those to skills maxed due to the fact that you'll never know what type of weapon will fall into your hands, and being able to use it and use it well will either make you love the weapon or hate it and sell it off.  Of course as I continue progressing in levels and accumulating more things, I plan on earning (that's right I am not going to buy) my ghoulbane and Deepwater Harpon- both of which will be attainable at around lvl 32 for me.  Until then I will still use my Crystaline blade and Axe of the Iron Back till that time.  <br>&nbsp;<br>Dadin <br>54th Cavalier<br>Honored Circle on Xev<br><br>Dwarven Thane<br>Hellwinds - Palomides </td></tr>
