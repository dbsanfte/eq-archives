	   <tr><td colspan=2>Sorry foks, but if your not lev 50+ in a big time guild you have very little chance of doing anything cool in this game. I started playing EQ when kunark cam out and now have a lev 51 ranger. and I still have never had a chance to get in on a dragon raid, or a plan raid, or even some of the nice camps here or Sol b. This more than anything make me want to quite this game. Before I came to this relization I had hope that maybe some day through hard work and LONG LONG hours of playing I would be able to do some of the things that eveyone wants to do when they start playing this game. But now I know better. I have no high lev friends to help me out. Ever thing I have gotten has been gottne by my self through saving and grouping like a mad man. I have ran it to some very nice people that have help me out with some informantion and even in finishing some quest that I wanted to. But the longer I play the more I relize that split between the ubers and the rest of us. And it just make me sick. great zones like mistmoore, and upper guk are NEVER used unless by some lone person farming an item. There are grinder zones that we all know well, Oasis, OT, DL, and other zones like that those, but god how boring those zones get. So you want to try and lev some where else good luck finding a group. Most people only want to kill things that are eather 20lev's lower then them for an item, or they think they can take something 20lev's higher then them trying to get some item. Thouse are the people that get most of us killed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know where I'm going with this but I can tell you that I'm writeing it after 4 hours of trying to get into the frenzed room, and being told that I'm too low. Another 3 hours trying to get a group together to kill the eveil eye, with no one being interested for what ever reason they had. another 3 and some odd hours trying to get into or hell even on the list for the efreet room in sol b. The hole time being told that I'm too low, or that they don't have a full group and don't need one. and I just had to vent a little. The only way that I think I am ever going to get the lammy of my dreams is to kill HG's for 2 weeks stright and save every cp i get. and I don't even toy with the idea that I will ever be able to get my epics. Now you may say that no one deserves there epics, they have to earned. But earned how? By makeing friends with 50+ lev 60 char to help me do a quest? I'm sure that most of you have noticed that high lev people will not even return a tell from you, if your just asking for derictions. I can understand that a little, with everyone begging for items and suck I have been know to ignore a persone too, but not untill I see what they want. If they want advise or derictions I do the best I can to help them out, if they want an item or money I say no, if they ask again I but them on ignore. So if your not in a major guild, How in the hell do you get into one when they won't even talk to you. And we all know there is no way to solo for your epic. So I ask again how do you earn it?????<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

You need to group up with some guildies, help them out on their questing, and in return, they will help you out on your questing. The result, you and your guild friend have the items you want. I am not sure what server your on, but a 50+ player usually can find a guild no sweat, and guilds are always doing weekly raids, distributing the loot to who is in need (hopefullly). I am currently working on getting in to a real nice guild on my server. I am very picky, because there are alot of guilds that suck, and just bicker...and obviously those are to be avioded. I did my homework, asked around, and found the guild I want. Once in, I plan to stay, and earn my keep. Friends help friends....and that is how you get yer uber class sheit.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I just want to point out that track is useful for more than just soloing.<br><br>When grouped in an outdoor zone it can take you straight to the mobs you want (eg: the Tesch Mas gnolls around Paw or the Mammoths of Everfrost). So it can be VERY useful in groups. :)<br><br>The only place where track is of little value is in a densely packed dungeon with many corridors. This is because track only tells you that the mob is to your left, not that you have to go down the hallway, turn right, go down the stairs, through the door, make a left and go straight, make another left and choose the door to you right. So using track in a place like Blackburrow, where there are many corridors and floors, can be frustrating. But if you want to kill a specfic named mob and have no IDEA where to look, it's better than wandering aimlessly.<br><br>Just my 2cp.

You shouldn't lose to one no matter how well-played then you dumb bitch!!!<br><br>I tell ya what Kildy, you need to stop smoking that bud and get in on some of this crack that I'm on, at least you remember @#%^ afterwards!!!<br><br>@#%^ing loser, I have NO RESPECT for one such as you. You couldn't keep your @#%^ together if you ate a pound of cheese and drank a gallon of milk for 3 days straight!!! Tell me I'm wrong, stupid ass Kildiar, so you can contradict yourself once again.....<br><br>@#%^ING LOSER<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Okay, Kildiar won't stop posting all this crap on the boards untill we stop arguing. Or, when we convince him that Rangers don't suck. And, I KNOW that we won't stop. So, why fight it? I have a list of reasons why we don't suck. Okay, mainly a comparison between Rangers, SK's, and even some about Paladins.<br><br>1.We can TRACK! This thing is awesome. I mean, I always use it to find that animal, or that lost newbie. I use it to find Kelethin when I zone into GFay, the possibilites are almost endless.<br>2.We get the best archery damage in the game, I mean I don't see the Warriors with any good bows at all nowadays. Plus, add TT in, and you are KICKIN ASS!<br>3.Dual wield/double attack combo. We are the ONLY hybrids in the game that get this combo, and are one of the only four classes that can do this. We dish out more damage than a Warrior usually with better weapons, making us the third highest damage dealing melees in the game.<br>4.Epics. Or, well, Swiftwind. That weapon rules! My Pally friend is jealous cuz the Ranger epic (Swiftwind) OWNS most other melee class epic. Kildiar, since you say this is a group game, lets compare our epics in a group. Yours looks cooler and procs a lifetap of like 350. Ours looks stupid and has a haste of 40% ans raises attack by 30. Now, as we all know, there is a Cleric and an Enchanter in the group. Lets say everyone is level 50. The Enchanter can haste for 60%, outing you at 60, and me at the cap (forgot what the haste cap is). Then, you have your epic doing very, VERY small damage to the mob, and healing you a bit. Well, as YOU have stated so many times before, THATS WHAT CLERICS ARE FOR!!!!!!!!!!<br>5.Damage shields. Our self only, long lasting damage shields STACK with the normal ones, so, when we ARE tanking (it happens) we can be doing ALOT more damage.<br>6.All other buffs. These are our best spells, the skins, SoW, and stat buffs. Okay, we are ALMOST the best buffing hybrid (damn Paladins). Now, in a duel, we would both have more resists than usual Kildiar, but, the Ranger is buffed to hell when you only have a few buffs cuz you can't AC tap us or anything. Buffs ARE more usfull than taps.<br>7.Weapons. Rangers get a HUGE variety of weapons, making us all the more dangerous. You pitiful SKs and Paladins with your weapons. You get some really cool weapons, but, since you can't dual wield, we are STILL better.<br>8.Fear Animal. Okay, you SK's get Fear. Thats cool, up untill the 50's, you can easily just kill animals solo with this. No need for a fear that works on everything. Our coolest new spell )<br>9.Races. We get to be two very cool races. The Half Elves, and, the almighty Woodelves! (Sorry Humans, this is just my opinion). Will, you SK's get to be Ogres and Trolls. NO comparison there.<br>9.Armor looks. I hear some Rangers complain about the cool green and brwon armors, well, I think they look awesome, way better than that rusty red, or dirty black SK's wear. I'm not even gunna start on Pally armor.<br>10.Ass holes like you. You guys are just making me want to prove you wrong more.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Warriors are really actually a defensive class, not really offensive, already three other classes that handle that.<br><br>4)  so you get 100% haste, and i have 86% (i think FBSS is 26%)  not a big difference.  As for the life tap, sure it heals me, saving cleric mana, and its also a DD.  As for your other epic, i can see by the mention of it, you dont quite enjoy it.<br><br>5) We get damage shields as well, a 12 damage shield that stacks<br><br>6) We get a cancel magic spell string, not too hard to cancel the ranger buffs, considering they are somewhere around 20 levels lower buffs.<br><br>7) If your talking about damage output, an SK can dish the same damage as a ranger if he throws all his DoT's on the mob and taps inbetween swings.<br><br>8) Have no idea what that was supposed to prove, but hey, if we are gonna throw fears in there.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Regarding the reason warriors don't max out archery despite the fact that they can critical.&nbsp;&nbsp;Warriors are interested in archery primarily as a pulling device.  This means they go for bows with a high damage/high delay so that they max the damage on the ONE shot they take on the mob to pull it to the group.  For a warrior to bow-kite, he needs a group....and a group that wants the warrior to bow-kite is as elusive as your friends are on this board, Kildiar, LOL.  A warrior soaks up damage while dealing a respectable amount, that is their role and they will have a hard time trying to break out of that.<br><br>A ranger, meanwhile, gets the spells to fear and bow-kite.  A ranger can root-N-snipe/blast as a SOLO tactic, no need to make the group mad that the ranger is not max damage producing (meleeing) until he gets the Trueshot discipline.  A ranger chooses lower damage/lower delay bow that leaves a warrior scratching his head at the cost.  Why? over time, a ranger pumps more arrows out for more damage in the long run over a high damage/high delay bow.<br><br>Get lots of plat to give to your guild trainer (look at how quickly the costs go up the further you level) if you intend to max out a warrior's archery skill or be prepared for LONG slow skill levelling.  Warriors will rarely get more than one shot off at a mob, pulling or not.  A warrior who pulls off the mob to plink is in a bad healing group, in most situations.  A ranger who pulls off a mob in a group knows aggro management and might have TS discipline ready to go.<br><br>Sk's can max out their archery relatively quickly due to the low skill cap they have.  It makes a huge difference after hitting Master, trust me, I know. <br>&nbsp;<br>Colphax<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=187084" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=187084</a><br>&lt;Vox Populi&gt;<br>Baradur 30 Human Cleric<br>Malden 16 Dwarven Warrior</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;This post is a bit long.  When there's something to be said about a class the only thing to do is to say everything about a class.  I hope other rangers will read this and take heart that they're better than other classes think, and that other classes will take note and realize that we're not liabilities.  <br><br><br>I'm sure what I'm about to say has been said here before, but since I just got here I'll put down all I've learned about being a ranger since I started my first character on EQ.<br><br>I picked a ranger because it seemed like a good class.  It could cast some defensive spells and a few offencive spells.  It could wear armor and use a sword and shield, and later it could weild two weapons.  I started with a half-elf ranger because the stats seemed right for the character.<br><br>Surefall Glade was a good starting point.  There's a major town nearby with many quests for a young character and the Qeynos Hills area is a nice newbie area without too many people in it.  <br><br>Nearby Blackburrow was a great place to find people to group with and a wonderful place to learn how to avoid trains.  It was also an outside area so all of a young rangers spells would be available, even in the deepest portions of the gnoll homeland.  <br><br>Everfrost was full of creatures to fight also, and the not so friendly barbarians would still welcome someone who had killed one of their dogs in West Karana a few times.  There were plenty of animals to practice fear kiting on and lots of good targets for archery that didn't move too fast even without snare.<br><br>West Karana is the most dangerous zone for a young ranger.  There are many camps of bandits with sashes to turn in for experience and some coins and items (to sell for more coins).  Unfortunitly there are many threats that a young ranger can't avoid or run away from easily.  The twin cyclopses, Froon and Choon, are one of them; and will often be seen chasing some poor unfortunate soul along the road to one of the zones.  There is an occasional giant wandering the area also.  He finds most of the people fighting the bandits to be easy targets.  A Werewolf often shows up at night also.  He runs very fast and hits fairly hard.  There is also the Ghoul Messenger to watch out for, at least until you're able to beat him (arround 30th) and turn in his map for your Short Sword of Morin.  <br><br>So much for the basic area knowledge, it's nothing you can't find on any website dedicated to EQ anywhere.  Just thought it'd be some useful knowledge for people starting in the area.  <br><br>Now on to the important stuff, the skills of a ranger.<br><br>First and foremost is Tracking.  Tracking is one of the most useful skills a ranger has.  Two other classes get tracking, the druid and the bard.  The bard and druid can't, however, alter the tracking list.  A ranger has several different /tracksorts to use.  The most useful is &lt;closest&gt;.  This one tells you what the nearest mobs are, and what direction.  If you put me in any zone I've spent a decent ammount of time in I can tell you what zone, where in the zone I am, and about how far away any given mob is just from the track list.  Closest is the best for avoiding powerful enemies, or for finding easy kills without having to run too far.  Another good one is &lt;consider&gt;, this one groups enemies in order from blue, even, yellow, green, red.  (I think that's the right order, been a while since I've used it.)  This one is good for finding mobs that are killable with ease.  It dosn't give a hint as to how far away things are however.  The /tracksort &lt;normal&gt; lists things in the order that they spawned.  This is useful for looking for new mobs and named mobs, but that's about all.  Usually the red mobs will be the lowest on the list, while easily killed green ones are near the top.  Unfortunitly the newest mob could be one at the far range of tracking leaving you to follow the trail for a long while before finding the creature.  Tracking is still useful in dungons, if a ranger knows a dungon fairly well, or has a good map of the area, he can find a mob without much trouble with tracking.  The skill of the person behind the 'toon comes into play when tracking is needed in a dungon.  <br><br>Archery is the second great ranger skill.  I'm currently 42nd level with a maxed skill of 200 using ceramic silver tipped parabolic arrows (damage 5, range 150) and a non-magical Trueshot bow.  I can do an average of 40 damage with each arrow, and I've gotten crits up to 79 points.  (I recently leveled to 42, so the max has probably gone up a bit again.)  Warriors can do greater crits using 2HS weapons, but a ranger can do that ammount of dammage while keeping away from the mob.  A bow with a decent range can also keep a ranger safe from a caster or bard.  Bow damage can also be dished out while moving, giving a ranger an advantage over casters.  If the range of the bow is beyond the range of the spells a caster tries to use then a ranger dosn't have to worry about getting nuked while dishing out damage to an offending caster.  (It's a risky business saying just inside bow range but out of spell range.  More than once I've been on the reciving end of a high damage nuke when I strayed too close to my rooted/snared caster)  Once a ranger gets the Trueshot Dicipline (at 55th level I belive) he can do amazing damage with his bow.  I've seen screen shots of 400+ damage from one arrow.<br><br>Another great skill that rangers get are their spells.  Rangers get spells from many of the other caster types in the game.  Even with the first set of spells it enhances the damage output of a ranger, and his value to the group with healing and buffs spells.  His spells aren't as powerful as other casters, but what caster could sit in the middle of a fight and cast while being beaten on by a mob for an extended period of time.  Rangers can also alternate between casting and using the bow to get some very nice damage on mobs from range.  If you shoot a mob for 20 damage and cast Ignite for 35 more it averages out to about twenty five damage a second from range.  It depends of course on your mana supply and how fast you can fire your bow.  Rangers also get a few ranger only spells.  My favorite is Call of the Sky.  This spells imbues a rangers weapons with the ability to activate a 35 damage proc.  With two quick weapons swinging and Call of the Sky activated a ranger can go a long way to preventing a caster mob from getting spells off.  Each time the weapon procs it has a 1 foot knock back and an interrupt.  This keeps the group safe from casting mobs.  (I'm currently enjoying interrupting the spells of Drachnids)  Another good spell is SoW at 30th level.  A long time to wait, but well worth it.  The various Dots, DD spells, roots and snares help a ranger to solo creatures where another melee class would have trouble in a stand up fight with a creature of the same level.  I managed to solo my first to Hill Gians in Rathe Mountians when I was 38th level.  By using my bow and Ignite in conjunction with snare and alot of backing off I was able to drop two giants in about 20 minutes.  Not nearly as impressive as a pure caster, but amazing for a melee/hybrid class.  <br><br>Now that I've covered the major advantages of being a ranger, it's time for the downside of being a woodsy type.  <br><br>If you're playing a ranger it can be hard to get groups between 20th and 30th levels.  That's okay tho.  There are plenty of animals to fear kite to get you through these levels.  A ranger shouldn't have to go underground into a dungon until he's far beyond 30th level.  Everything a ranger needs is above ground with fur and fangs.  There are amazing ammounts of money to be made from silk swatches (use sewing skill), HQ bear and wolf skins (Just cause you worship Tunare dosn't mean you can't help keep the population down), and even the occasional word and rune.  Just pick a zone with alot of foot traffic and auction every now and then that you have a bunch for sale and watch the offers come in.  Once you hit 30th and get sow you'll have plenty of "slowbies" who are willing to put up with you for your SoW spell.  <br><br>If you're playing a ranger in the upper level games be prepared to die.  As a ranger it's your JOB to pull any agro'd mobs off of chanters/casters/clerics.  Just make sure you announce that you're doing it.  When you pull off of someone the first thing to do is throw whatever healing spell you have on them and then attack the creature with whatever you've got.  Snare, root, DoT, DD, bow, melee, taunt, disarm, kick.  With everything going at once it shouldn't be too long before whatever was beating on the poor caster is now beating on you.  This is the point where you die.  The main reason for this is that most healers (not all, there are some good ones out there, I know who you are and appreciate it) will begin to heal the now safe caster back to full.  This leaves you to take the brunt of the mobs fury for quite a while until either other tanks come in or it gets nuked to oblivion.  Unfortunitly a ranger dosn't often last that long.  There is no class that can take damage from an upper level mob for very long, some can just take it longer than others.  The greatest dissapointment of dying is how everyone blames the ranger for dying.  Even if you've pulled the mob of the cleric who rezes everyone you may still be berated for dying.  Don't worry about it, it's part of being a ranger.  If the group you're raiding with gets too petulent about your often demise just (and you didn't hear this from me) stop saving the casters for a bit.  When everything has to stop because the cleric has to do a corpse run two or three times everyone will want you to die for the cause again.  Complaints will stop, for a little while.  Just don't do it too often, or you might not be invited to the next raid.<br><br>The third disadvante for a ranger is how much a ranger costs.  The good equipment for a ranger is price between cleric and pure caster costs.  And the best bow you'll get until you hit 50 or so is the Trueshot yout make with your own two hands.  You'll need to buy some of the few items that have AC and WIS, and since they can be worn by pretty much every other WIS caster out there they are rare and expensive.  Don't worry too much about raising your WIS tho.  My mana goes from empty to full in about four minutes right now, and I only run out if I'm doing a solo kite that breaks snare and root alot.  Probably the most expensive thing a ranger would want to own is Tolan's Darkwood Bracer.  This bad boy is only AC 14, but it has an unlimited charge of Summon Arrows.  That means unlimited ammunition for all your shooting needs, and the arrows are magic also.  The bracer usually costs about 5-6K on most of the servers, due to it's rarity and difficulty of the mob.  The arrow effect also can't be used until you're 45+.  But it's well worth the price.  <br><br>If things go bad you'll find yourself Kiting many mobs arround whatever clear area of zone you can find while everyone else head back to their corpses.  A ranger either dies first, or he dies last.  As a ranger I've never been in the middle of the list of deaths.  If you're the last to fall, there's no reason for you to die also.  Just start running, if you have SoW keep it up.  If they're a slow mob, run backwards and shoot at them.  Who knows, you may get a kill or two while the rest are out of zone and get all the exp for yourself.  (Hey, someone's got to get it, and the mobs are already half dead, it'd be a shame for all the damage to regen)  If you get good at kiting you can keep it up for as long as needed.  <br><br>A quick story for you.  I was with guildies in Timorous Deep at the Spiroc house.  I was 36th at the time, far too low to fight the colorful inhabitants of that aviary.  I was there to get some experience from my higher-level bretheren and hopefully some plat to help my meager bank account.  During a bad pull five spirocs were pulled back to our camp.  After several attempts to root and snare our main puller went down hard.  The spirocs then turned their attention on our druid, the druid managed to kite for a bit before they got her trapped aginst another sudden pop.  Down went the druid.  Because of spells and arrows coming from me the spirocs came after me next.  During the ensuing melee our cleric cast celestial healing agroing two of the parrot people onto her.  Unfortunitly I was unable to agro both off of her so she fell in the heat of battle.  At that point I decided it was time to run my lowbie ranger tail out of there.  I headed up the beach in the hopes of a raft and a quick zone out.  I soon outpace the parots, who are unable to fly, and hardly able to run.  I turned and began to fire my bow while letting them follow me.  I'd like to say that I managed to kill one, but I didn't.  The most I managed to do was keep running for a half hour keeping them away from me and re-SoWing myself as necessary.  I also pulled an ogre or two into the mix, so I had quite the menagarie following me by the time our cleric got back.  (Cleric players take note of this point in the story)  After looting all but one item from her corpse our cleric did a VERY foolish thing.  She Celestial Healed me because I was under two bubles of health.  Due to the range between me and the kited birds, and the fact that I hadn't been doing much lately to create agro, they all mobed our cleric killing her quite quickly and efficently.  They then began following me again.  After about another 15 minutes everyone got thier corpses back and thier equipment on.  I ran past with my train of nasties and let them pull one at a time off the end.  I made sure that I swung back in time to get the exp for each kill, and so they could just keep pulling them off.  After about twenty minutes all the mobs were dead, and I was a good deal closer to the next level.  I hope my fellow rangers never find themselves in this sort of situation; it's stressful, taxing, and exhillerating; but if you do, rest assured that you'll be well equiped to handle the massive number of angry creatures that want to make you into the most popular type of ranger, a dead ranger.<br><br>There you have it.  The good and the bad of it.  What to look forward to, and what to dread.  Straight from the rangers mouth.  <br><br>As far as PVP goes, a ranger can beat any other class with a bit of skill, trickery and luck.  Here's a few pointers for each class.<br><br>Warriors:  Just snare/root these bishes and then shoot/dot away.  They'll fall fast before a barrage of fire, lightning and arrows.  Just make sure you keep them rooted and all they can do is TRY to respond with their arrows.<br><br>Rogues:  Same as warriors above, plus don't turn your back.  A rogue of the same level can drop your HP faster than anything short of a dragon or deity.<br><br>Paladins:  Pretty much the same as warriors, just keep out of casting range and have alot of arrows ready.  Be prepared to kill a Pally twice, that Lay on Hands means you need to dish out twice as much damage.  They can also heal themselves so make sure you have ALOT of arrows to finish this steel clad healing machine off.<br><br>Shadowknights:  These guys are tough, they have pets, they have a snare spell that will overwrite your SoW, they have a Harm Touch that will knock a bunch off of your life, they have as much magical firepower as you do and all of it is offensive based.  Just jump in and start swinging, nuking, doting, and hope he runs out of HP and mana before you do.  Your main advantage is that he only uses one weapon, you have two.  That means you get to interrupt his spells more often than he gets to interrupt yours.  Good luck and Tunare go with you.  <br><br>Bards:  These are the ugly, bastard step-child of all the classes.  If you can do it, they can do it, at twice the speed and without the mana cost.  Treat these guys as pallys.  Just root and shoot from out of their song range until they die.  Just remember that they're as fast as you are, and can swing just as often.  If they're a good twiner they may just beat you, if they're not the bish is yours to mount over your mantle.  If a bard is smart enough to start your dual with an instrument instead of weapons, you're facing a master and probably already lost unless you can keep him FAR away.  <br><br>Monks:  These guys hit hard and fast, but have less HP than even you do.  If you really want to mess them over follow the instructions for the warrior, and if they Feign Death just get close and AOE the both of you.  FD dosn't do anything in duals, but it's fun to watch him pop back up before he wants to.  Just be aware that they can bind self, that means they can heal anywhere from 1/3 to 1/2 of their HP just by pressing a button.  Don't close in for the kill until you know for SURE that they've used it recently.  <br><br>Chanters:  These guys are easy.  The only thing they have going for them is mez, and that's easily countered.  Just DoT yourself and keep the DoT and and mez will break as soon as it hits.  Chase the clarity casting bastard down and show him that rangers don't appreciate the sparkles before their eyes.  We prefer the stars overhead.  If a chanter does happen to nuke you just keep going.  They can't do it much and by the time he gets the second one loaded you should be on top of him swinging away and interrupting his spells.  Just don't let the DoT drop.  If you do and get Mezed, well, you'll probably be standing still for a long time while he gets mana and life back.  <br><br>Shaman:  These guys are HARD.  If you can get him rooted and snared and keep WAY out of spell range and shoot with the bow then you just may beat him.  Keep buffs low and cancel magic up.  If he DoTs you just alternate between shooting and casting cancel magic on yourself until the DoT is gone.  If he's got a pet keep one of your Anti-Summoned spells up.  They work wonders on pets of all sorts.  If you're going after a shammy, good luck.  The barbarian ones make excellent winter rugs too.<br><br>Druids:  This guy is your best friend, except for in a dual.  If you dual with a druid you'll spend alot of time sitting still sucking up AoE attacks and watching your life go down.  If you can get the first root off keep them away like every other caster and shoot away.  If you're lucky root will break while he's healing himself and you'll get another on before he moves.  These guys run as fast as you do, and can root/snare/dot/nuke/AOE alot better than you can.  If they get close press the attack and hope for interrupts, alot of interrupts.  If you happen to beat one carve Tunare's name in their back, just to remind them that they're not the ultimate servant of Nature.  <br><br>Mages:  Mages have massive spell power, lousy hit points.  If you're starting close keep close and keep swinging.  Watch for their pets too.  If you can hit hard and fast enough a mage will fall before getting two or three spells off.  If you're lucky he'll get none off.  If you're starting from range just root and shoot like with the other caster types.  If his pet comes at you just root the pet and use your Anti-summoned spells on it.  It'll go down quick.  Don't melee fire pets(they have a Damage Shield), and don't get close to earth pets (They use root as a standard form of attack).  If you have high resists you can try and close when he's weak to knock him out and save some arrows; but you don't have resists that high until his spells hit hard enough to drop you like a gnoll pup.<br><br>Wizards.  These guys are pure nukage.  They can dish out more HP than you've got.  If you've got high resists just close and beat on them till they're dead.  If you have anything less than 100+ resists just root and move far enough away to shoot until they're dead.  If you see him sit to med and change spells run in QUICK and start swinging.  Wizzies have spells that outrange your bow, unless you've got 175-200 range on it.  Even then they can hit you with some of their spells that are fire and forget.  They keep moving until they hit the zone edge, or you.  (You CAN use this to your advantage tho, if there's a mob behind you that gets hit it will agro on the mage.  Not quite a fair one-on-one dual, but it's a risk he's taking.)<br><br>Necromancers:  Um, you're dead.  Unless you can suck up three types of dots while taking a beating from a nasty pet and do this all while under a snare type effect don't take this guy on.  If you have to fight one tho, just get close and beat away.  Ignore the pet, or root it at some convienent far off spot.  Keep beating on the necro while he Life Taps you and hope that you do more damage than he steals.  If you can root him and his pet at range just keep shooting away like with any other caster.  Necro's have long range spells too, so you'll probably get hit anyway.  As with Wizzies, if he sits to change spells in his book run in swinging.  <br><br>Clerics:  Don't dual clerics.  The cleric you defeat and gloat over today, may be the CLERIC you have to beg a rez from tomorow.  If you have to dual a cleric just move in and keep swinging.  Throw a few cancel magics on him to take off some AC and HP.  Watch for the stun spells, and any of the healing spells.  Pretty much if you can keep swinging at a cleric he'll fall fairly quickly.  They have some good smite spells tho, so watch out for those.  You can root and shoot clerics also, but you'll be in for a LONG time shooting.  So be nice to your cleric, they're not worht killing, and you'll need him to rez you later on.<br><br>As with any dual the skill and equipment of the characters impacts greatly on the outcome.  All of the scenarios are based on players of equal skill and equivilent equipment going at it.  The ranger also has one final advantage in duals.  Every other class will underestamate you, saying to themselves, 'It's just a ranger, I can take him'.  Be prepared for their outraged cries of, "No fair rooting me!  I'm a warrior and can't reach you from here," or, "Hey, I would have beaten you if you hadn't been out of my casting range,"  or even, "If I hadn't been interrupted so much I would have won," and especially, "No fair DoTing so my mez woln't stick!"  Sure, people can complain, but you don't tell them they can't use their crits, or harm touch, or pets do you?  Or course not, because you're a ranger.  If you win it's a victory for rangers every where; and if you die, well, you're a ranger.  That's what rangers do for a living.<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I know that a warrior gets the same archery cap as a ranger.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure if they get crits also.  I'm sure they do but I havn't seen one.  <br><br>That most warriors don't get archery up is one factor in my strategy for them.  The other reason it works is because warriors usually have only a basic found bow and basic found arrows.  If a warrior had the same bow and arrows as I did I might be worried about the outcome.  <br><br>I've been using a Trueshot long bow, which is about the best bow you can get before 45+ level.  It dosn't have more damage that some that you can make, but the delay is much less, and it's Ranger only.  So I'm fairly certian that if I got in a bow dual with a warrior I'd win.  <br><br>Another aspect of the Root and Shoot strategy is that I can cast a variety of Dot's and AOE's on him, and I can cast heals on myself.  The only hope a warrior has is if he has a regen item or by some FREAK chance I manage to miss with 10 or 12 arrows in a row giving him time to bind wounds.  He could also have healing potions, or a Wall Squad Ring (Quest Version).  Charges on those would run out quickly.  <br><br>Now if a warrior were to have a Bow of the Huntsman and the 5 damage arrows that I use he might win.  I'd have a better chance tho.  It's not confirmed but I've heard that rangers get a bonus to hit and damage on mobs that are standing still using archery.  The bonus may apply to anyone using a bow, but I can only speak from experience.  I know the only times I've gotten my max crits were when mobs were rooted or standing still for some other reason.  Usually being in a melee fight dosn't count as standing still either.  <br><br>Just out of curiosity I checked what my damage with the hunting bow and the basic mob drops arrows would do.  I did about 32 damage (my skill is higher, and offence and agi may take part in damage also) and my best crit was 56.  Not great, but still pretty good damage for one shot every second and a half.<br><br>(I almost bought a fleeting quiver earlier which would have made me a gattling gun archer but the bastich said he "misstyped" the price of 1K and that it was actually going for 3K.  Rangers, don't pay more than 1K for one.  For 1K you could get your sewing to master level and buy or hunt down and kill the mobs with the stuff you need.  Unless you have money coming out your varied orifices and have to spend it.  In that case I'll make you one fore 3K!)<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Damn man! You must know something that I don't cuz Taioring is a HELL of a lot harder to raise than Fletching, IMO of course. My fletching skill is 177, my tailoring is 98. There is no way Tailoring is easier to get up then Fletching, provided you have the cash. Fletching you get every single item from a vendor, you can get it to 200's using this technique, just by sitting next to a vendor the WHOLE TIME!!! This takes a lot of cash, but so does tailoring.<br><br>Look man, if you want to tailor you have to get @#%^loads of spider silk and/or HQ Cat Skins. Now you can buy these (if you have A LOT of cash) or you can hunt them FOREVER before you get a realistic amount that raises your skill enough!!! Take your pick, and after you get past skill of 108 I heard it takes forever to get to 150. Therefore, taking the failure rating of Fleeting Quiver (still hard to make at 160-180) and all the time it takes to get your skill that high, it's well worth the price.<br><br>That's all I'm trying to say, it is definitely worth 3k, if someone sold for 1k I would jump all over that.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>You're exactly right, Kildiar. I do see no reason to argue with you on why the Ranger is a powerful class. The reason: it is pointless. No matter what I say, it will not change your view about us. I REPEAT, it will not change YOUR VIEW on us. <br><br>You already have it in your mind that Rangers suck, and nothing I have to say will change that. Others have already written probably everything there is about why THEY think the Rangers are a good class, and you just say no, they're wrong.<br><br>So what's the point of arguing about it over and over Kildiar??? You have expressed your points NUMBEROUS times, yet you will not let it rest. I can tell you why you do it, because you are a little KID. Fifteen, well, exactly my point. At fifteen you think you know everything, TRUST ME, I was there once too. Keep posting all the factual information you'd like, such as skill caps and all that. God that's funny, the reason Verant made the Rangers skill caps that low was because RANGERS would be too powerful perhaps.....<br><br>Kildiar, one reason you give for hating Rangers just totally perplexes me though. You say one reason you hate them is because of the people on this board. Hint Hint, go on another Forum, post that class sucks over and over, give reasons as to why sometimes, sometimes not (you know, just be your normal self :P) and see what they begin to say. The stuff they say will not be any less forgiving than what us Rangers have written to you. Pretty soon you will be hating every class in this game, if THAT is a PRIMARY REASON. <br><br>Another thing, you seem to be a chronic liar. You act like you never get beat in battles, by anyone, except for fellow SK's. Come on, kid, do you expect us all to believe that???&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't care how good you are, everybody loses sometimes. ESPECIALLY on PvP servers, where you constantly have to be on guard for others.<br><br>In final Kildiar, MY PERCEPTION of you will never change, as your perception of Rangers will never change. One final thing about IGNORANCE, don't talk to me about ignorance until you learn what the word means. Ignorance is posting Rangers suck on a board and not expecting to be flamed for it. Ignorance is posting Rangers suck on a board and expecting a reasonable DEBATE, not argument, when YOU were the one that first came out with no intentions other than to piss us off. Only LATELY have you acted like you want to reason with us (RANGERS).<br><br>That's all I have to say about that....for now. Take care.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Izzy Jizzy<br>57th Dark Elf Rogue<br><br>Spinn Sappa<br>19th Wood Elf Ranger<br></td></tr>

They arent quite what i am arguing about, yet people bring them up anyway.  Funny thing is, they dont even know me and they assume all these strange ass things.  Maybe you rangers should focus more on trying to tell me why your class is potent, and not why i am, in your opinion, a loser.  Truthfully, i could care less what you call me, it just shows how much you abandon hope on arguing with me to prove whether or not the ranger is worthy of a class.  If you look earlier on the board, during my first attacks, youll notice that, when presented with logical arguments, i came to enjoy this class, but come back to hating it after i get these insults, that i really could care less about.  How cool would one have to be to insult someone else over the computer? that is cowardice my friends.<br>     I hope you rangers learn a bit of logic when arguing with me, maybe youll learn to appreciate your class more, or maybe youll learn to hate it, it all depends on your abilities to defeat me.<br>     Is Julily still here?

You can start on them at 22 if you'd like (please note that it is somewhat difficult then, AND dangerous), although if you die you can just use the excuse that you will now just end up collecting more mammoth tusks and becoming all the more richer in the end. You can hunt mammoths up to 35, as far as I'm concerned they're well worth it also.<br><br>Imagine that, killing something at 22 that gives great LOOT and EXPERIENCE, and still KILLING it all the way up until 35!!!

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hiya all. this is just my weekly rant for the n00bs that come here. I love the ranger class, I love my ranger, dont listen do the weak arse ranger flamers, they all wannabes. The ranger class is a damn good class. This is said from experience. Having track , right off the bat, being a ranger is extrememly helpful if you are new to Norrath for sure. Being able to snare a mob if you are getting raped by it, and hightailing it to the zone...it has saved my life countless times. Ah, and sow- at level 30. Woot! heheh. then at 39, levitate, muhahaha...no more falling for damage. And...having Panic Animal, the ranger fear spell, is a XP harvester, if you want it to be, from level 22 on up. Heck...I am level 47 and I still use fear every once and a while. Wxample...the iceforged shackle quest, in Velious, the Wakening zone. you got to kill Tigeraptors for one of the quest pieces. Alone? np! , just snare and fear, and get yer drop. Ah well. Just lovin my ranger. Thanks for reading my incessent weekly ramble ;)&nbsp;&nbsp;Good hunting, rangers<br><br>Skulreaver Swiftblade<br>47 ranger , Eci<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I've seen a few newbies in here concerned about what to hunt, what skills to train in, how to find guilds and the like. Sit down children, Lashara will endeavor to teach you how to survive your early years.<br><br>She is hoping that you took her advice and started with a wood elf or half elf in Kelethin. If not, this post will be of less use to you, but you did want to this this the harder way, didn't you? <br><br>You spawn hoplessly lost in the tree city and you start to think....Where the hell am I? Stay calm, my friend. First thing you must do is going into settings/preferences on the left side bar and go to keyboard. Find the autoattack listing and change it from 'a' to any non-letter character except backspace. I personally chose the number 0. The reason for changing this is if you are typing a msg to a PC in conversation and you forget to hit enter before you start typing, at the first 'a' you press you will attack the PC. They will defend themselves and poof! Instant death! So please, please do this first. <br><br>Now, carefully look around you. You should see a big brown sign with a button-like thing near it. Go to that. Remember to keep your view in 1st person, and panned slightly downwards so you can see where the ramps are (and aren't!). It is highly likely that you will see a loom on the same platform as the sign. This tells you that you are above the "Newbie lift". Go over to the sign, press the little button and wait for the lift platform to come up (only if it isn't up already). Step on the platform, turn around and press the button again. Now turn back around and wait til you touch down. At the bottom, walk off the platform onto another, short ramp. You will now see two paths, one to your right and another one straight ahead. Choose the one straight ahead and follow it to the next lift. Move quickly, the guards will handle anything that follows you. At the bottom of this new lift, look around. You should see an ugly dude in black robes called "Priest of Discord". If you do, then good job. You are at the PoD lift. Go up using the buttons. At the top go straight ahead one platform, then turn left and go up the ramp. You should now be on the platform with a building labeled "Bank of Kelethin". Remember this platform, you'll be visiting here a lot. With your back to the ramp you just came up, look left and head on up that ramp. Then go down the ramp on the right hand side of this platform. On the far side of this newest platform should be a building marked "Faydark's Champions"! Congradulations! You found the ranger guild.<br><br> Go in and hail everbody. Get the quests as well. There should be quests for orc hatchets, the trueshot bow, and pixie dust. Now give your newbie note to the guy who gives the Trueshot bow quest named Maesyn Trueshot. He will give you your newbie tunic. (WARNING: Don't throw this tunic away!!!!! You will need it to do the Trueshot bow quest. Store it in the bank once you get an upgrade to this slot.) Put it on, then right click on Maesyn to see a list of skills you can train in as a ranger. You also have five points with which to train. Put one of these points in Sense Heading, another in Track and the rest in 1 hand slash. Now hotkey sense heading, track, forage and hide (if you are a wood elf) and your attack. Make sure you've put your newbie sword in your primary hand! Go back to the PoD lift and down. Up over the hill are a plethora of weakling mobs to kill. But at level 1, try to avoid the orc pawns and the wasps and stick to bats and skels. Wasps will team up on you, and orc pawns actually start at level 2 so they are a bit tough. Use track, but don't really follow it for now. It's better in this stage to eyeball things to go after so you don't stray too far from the safety of the guards. This way, if you get into trouble, high tail it back to the guards who will save you. Use sense heading everytime it refreshes. Use forage everytime it refreshes unless you are fighting. Collect your batwings and bonechips in stacks. And one you get a stack, use /auction WTS stack of _________! You can get 3-5pp a stack for the items by wizards and necromancers who need them. If you don't get&nbsp;&nbsp;buyer right away, don't despair. Just keep saving them up in the bank. When you do get a buyer (for one or the other) s/he'll generally clean you right out so the more stacks you have the more money you make. Also, save the best pierce weapon you can get off a skel. <br><br>Ding! Level 2. Skip merrily back to your guild, and train with Maesyn in Piercing, Hand 2 Hand, Taunt, Archery, and Fletching. Now go back into the woods, fight, and do some math. You should eventually see a message in lovely blue that says "You have increased your skill in 1 handed slashing! (#)" That number is the value of your current skill. Now, that value caps at a specific number determined by your level. More specifcally, level*5 + 5. So if you are level 2, you can get your weapon skills up to 15. So get your 1 hand slash up to 15, and then put your pierce weapon in hand. Once that too goes to 15, use your fists to fight. Keep rotating like this as you go up the levels, to keep your weapon scores up to par. Use forage, track, and sense heading at every chance. Use taunt while fighting solo to bring up that skill. Save and sell your batwings and bonechips. And now you can hunt the orc pawns for their hatchets. Take two hatchets back to Dill Fireshine (after recieving the quest) and he will reward you with some piece of crap armor and some coin and lots of exp! (Note: make sure before handing them over that both are in fact, named "Orc Hatchlet" or something similar. The icon is identical for the rusty axe, which pawns also drop. And Dill doesn't want those.)<br><br>Anywho, at level 3 you'll get forage for sure, if you haven't already. Make sure you use it often. Now, that you have a few pp (hopefully) from your batwings/bonechips endeavors, starting collecting small/med banded armor from smiths. Just use /auction WTB small/medium banded! and wait for offers to pour in. Pay no more than 1pp/AC. Half elves, you can only wear size medium. Wood elves, you can wear small OR medium. But chose small over medium because it generally weighs less. Note! Don't waste your money on banded boots! Get blackened iron if you can because they are magical. Also try to upgrade your weapons. Whip out a calculator for what you have, and divide delay by damage. The smaller that number is, the better. If it works out to be the same, look at item weight. Once again, less is more. Some items have procs. These items have an extra kick that is very useful. Get these items if you can. Magic items are also useful, but not as much as you might think. This is only a small bonus, but necessary for fighting some creatures. However you won't be thinking about fighting these creatures til level 9 at least, so don't worry about it til then. <br><br>At level 5 you get kick. Train in it, and add it to your hotkeys. Then try and get an orc hill group. While you wait, try out your new kicking talents on those poor orc pawns. Spiffy, eh? Once you get a group, go to the PoD lift. Put your view into 1st person, and with your back to the lift, look slightly up. Turn left and follow the edge of the city to another lift set deep into a hill. This is the last lift, the orc lift. Be careful! Orc centurions wander around here and will swat you like a fly unless you're grouped. Have your group meet you at the lift (just tell them you're new) and escort you to the hill. And kick some ass there all the way up til level 9, when you get spells, covered in my next tutorial. <br><br>A few side notes:<br>- Never drink in Kelethin and make sure you keep your view panned downwards and stay away from the edge.<br>- Don't kill the black wolves and don't help anyone who is. It's just un-rangerly.<br>- Track tends to be a bit buggy when trying to track to other PCs. It works fine when tracking mobs or NPCs, or group members, but sometimes when you're using it to track another PC, if will lead you in circles. Don't rely to heavily on it for this. (Note: I play on a non-PVP server. Not sure if this is different on PVP servers.)<br>- Fletching is important to rangers! Learn how to do it and reap the rewards. And to learn, do a web search for Aolena's Fletching Guide. Print it out (I know, it's 18 pages long) because it's well worth it, and refer to it often.<br>- Print maps for places you visit (Kelethin is essential) from www.eqatlas.com). Put them in a binder and you will thank yourself (and me!).<br>- The reason I suggest learning pierce, 1hs and Hand to hand is as follows: Your epic weapon is a 1hs. But there are some nice pierce weapons for rangers. And on corpse runs, you'll want to have some chance at fending off the angry cent that's chasing you. And since you spawn with only your fists and feet.....a little monk skill is required.<br><br>Any questions? Just ask.<br>  <br>Good hunting rangers!<br>&nbsp;<br>Lashara Dyran<br>"Little Miss Bow & Arrows"<br>Keeper of the wolves<br>Ranger of the 51st sun <br>Lanys T'Vyl</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Izzy is correct. Once you train in a skill, that is enough, and you will continue to advance in the skill by using the skill. (eg: to improve kick, kick mobs when fighting, to improve forage, click forage a lot) You do not need to train at the guild more than once per skill. And with innate skills (like forage and hide are innate to woodelves) you do not have to train at all. So what do you do with all the extra train points you get? You use them carefully.<br><br>You see, some skills, for whatever reason, are either more difficult or more costly to improve than others. For example, to improve my piercing skill all I have to do is wage combat with a piercing weapon in hand and wait. But to improve my smithing skill, I must purchase two stacks of ore pieces and a stack of water flasks, find a forge and then one by one put 2 ores and 1 flask in the forge, click combine and watch all my money disappear in a botch. This is a very expensive way to improve a skill. <br><br>Improving my bind wound skill is difficult, because in order to use it I have to be below 1/2 health. That means I have to let some mob beat on me til I'm that low and then hope I can kill it, or find some creative way to hurt myself. (Jumping off the Kelethin platforms works well for this at higher (25) levels btw. This is a harder than average skill to improve. <br><br>So some people use their extra practice sessions to train in these costly, or less often used skills to keep them at a respectable level. <br><br>And so you only have to formally train in each skill once. Then take your skills to the forest and practice, practice, practice!<br><br>May Tunare guide your steps,<br>&nbsp;<br>Lashara Dyran<br>"Little Miss Bow & Arrows"<br>Keeper of the wolves<br>Ranger of the 51st sun <br>Lanys T'Vyl</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well, I guess I will try to help you. First of all, the garbage about having to train in something every level is NOT TRUE. Once you put a skill point into something, the skill, as you said, will continue to grow if you use it. Some skills, such as lockpicking for a rogue, requires you to be a certain level in it before it will begin to go up(for some reason you have to have a skill of at least 11 before the door in Befallen will let you start advancing in the skill). Some skills you do NOT need to train in in order to have the skill start going up, it will just go up automatically. The best advice I can really offer is to go to eq.castersrealm.com, go to the Ranger section, then go to skills and find out which ones require training before they go up and which ones do not.<br><br>Hope this helps a little, basically you DO NOT have to train in something more than once for it to begin to go up as you use it, and some skills you do not have to train in at all.<br><br>Good luck.<br>&nbsp;<br>Izzy Jizzy<br>57th Dark Elf Rogue<br><br>Spinn Sappa<br>19th Wood Elf Ranger<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>My ranger recently achieved 31st level.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was sitting on the dock in Iceclad the other day practicing my spell skills.  Casting Dance of the Fireflies (so I could sucessfully use Stinging Swarm {Conjuration}), Camoflage for Divination, and I was flame licking myself for Evocation.<br><br>I haven't used any of my DD spells in actual combat in a very long time.  I decided to cast Ignite on myself to work up Evocation faster.  What a bull spell.  Why do we have this?  As far as Evocation goes, I get far more use out of Flamefist and Flamelick than I do out of any of the Direct Damages we rangers possess.  I would rather have a couple of good buffs than any of the DD spells (i.e. Lightining, Ignite etc.).  They were fun at lower levels, but if you play your ranger correctly, you will never use DD later on. A dexterity buff on the other hand at level 22 would be great!  More crits for those arrows.<br><br>Stinging Swarm is looking like its a pretty useful spell.  Flame Lick, Snare, Root, Stinging Swarm, Arrows, Flame Lick, Snare, Arrows and melee a little bit.  Life this way has been pretty good in Iceclad.  You can throw in Panic Animal or use all kinds of different combinations.  This is only one version I have used.  Just remember young rangers, don't make the mistake I did at level 15.  Practice Dance of the Fireflies as often as you can.  Max out your Conjuration skill.  Otherwise, you will hit level 30 and find yourself unable to cast Stinging Swarm at all.  Fizzles cost a lot of mana. And death and frustration.  Practice, practice, practice.<br><br>Safe Questing<br>&nbsp;<br>Ironhom Hammerforge<br>Paladin of Kaladim<br>Chivalric Order<br><br><br><br><br></td></tr>

I'm not gonna get into what class is better like you do, I'm just gonna say play what you want and talk about constructive things on the APPROPRIATE FORUM. Believe me when I say we have all heard what YOU think of Ranger's for the last month now. WOW! You have developed you own opinions, how old do you have to be before that happens??? Unfortunately LOSERS like you still come to a Forum and think it is their right to spread bad words about a class. You know what, if there were no Rangers out there how could YOU kill them all??? Isn't that FUN for you??? So I wouldn't complain if I were you....<br><br>While I know this post will do nothing but spur you on somemore, that's partly why I wrote it....<br>The more posts you write, the more posts I can mark as AWFUL, no matter how constructive ONE might be. Because while maybe 1 out of your 10 posts might hold factual information...all the others are just OPINIONS and just plain GARBAGE.<br><br>Seriously Kildiar, Loser Boy Do'Urden, I love those books too, and since it seems you fancy yourself as Drizzt, try and act like him. It seems to me your acting more like Artemis or Jarlaxle....<br><br>And about killing a Ranger 6-8 levels above you pffft!! LOL, please know that IF this is true, it's because the guy didn't know what he was doing or YOU are twinked and maybe he wasn't. Either way, don't brag about it. I've killed many people above me, and died by many people below me. What does that say? I've been killed by almost all classes, and have killed ALL classes. However, I must say my 18 Ranger is nicely, NICELY TWINKED now, so I would bet all my money on ME over any other SK same level, and even a few levels above. :P<br><br>That's all I have to say about this nuisance (Kildiar Do'Urden....LOL).<br><br>"Kildiar's IGNORANT...no argument there."<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Izzy Jizzy<br>57th Dark Elf Rogue<br><br>Spinn Sappa<br>19th Wood Elf Ranger<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well first of all Ranger's don't suck, that I do agree with. But let's not kid ourselves and think Rangers can come even remotely close to the damage output of a Rogue....<br><br>It's not every minute that a Rogue can hit for "such and such damage", it's every 8-10 seconds. And as for the taunt factor, they could easily taunt a MOB off of a caster if the Rogue so chose, as could a Ranger. So while I can see where you're coming from, you have a lot of mis-leading information in your post. The thing about "more things in the melee perspective" is false also. While Rogues don't get kick (god only knows why NOT?!?!) they do get more defensive melee skills, not to mention Backstab.<br><br>OK, just had to point that out.<br>&nbsp;<br>Izzy Jizzy<br>57th Dark Elf Rogue<br><br>Spinn Sappa<br>19th Wood Elf Ranger<br></td></tr>

We have lower everything then Warriors and Rogues. WTF did you not understand what a Ranger, Rogue, Warrior is?? I mean a Warrior (hack,slash, repeat till dead). Rogue (get behind them hack,slash,repeat). Ranger (Fear Kite,Hack/Slash, Use bow to fire arrows). <br><br>We are not tanks (Warriors are). We are the ones that have to be versatile in the group. So many jobs we can do. Hate to say it we do not suck. You suck for posting on our board and flaming us all the time.

But then leaves it at that. That's called OPINION. You're just here to piss people off, and you're doing a good job of it. :) Listen to Rauv when he says Rangers are supposed to BE Rangers, not warriors, rogues, monks, etc. Cuz he's right.<br><br>God Damn Kildiar, give it a break and let this Ranger Forum RIP for awhile.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hey all,<br>I posted a while back regarding the Wurmslayer, is it worth it, is it as good as people say, blah blah...<br><br>I got some great gear suggestions and as well, reasons to not use wurmy... They were all valid, but I decided I'd rather see for myself. So I ended up buying one, I let myself get slightly ripped (by like 100p, no biggie) but I must say I like it. Yes it's slow, yes it does a monstrous buttload of damage. A lot more than my old config of Velium Warsword / Velium Shortblade (or Dragonhorn Yak)... right now I'm using it with a Journeyman's Walking Stick (saving up for a GJB or something noproc). I've done a fair amount of testing with it but I do believe from what I've seen so far I'll be using it into my 50's (right now level 42, all weapon skills maxed except 2hs and 2hb =P).<br><br>My sta is 95 atm with gear on, the only thing I can think of to push it up to 100 any time soon is the Ivy boots, but I refuse to wear them on the same grounds as some pallies refuse to wear Ro armour, I won't kill faeries. But I digress, the point is, it doesn't matter if Wurmy drains sta as fast as it does. The way I look at it is, if I'm soloing, I can root the mob and sit for a sec to get sta back, and if I'm grouped, there will almost certainly be breaks in between pulls for me to invigor. Plus, with my current config, either a GJB or lammy will put me over the top, so it won't matter anyhoo =)<br><br>I will say, however, that this testing has been somewhat uneven, for the fact that I've been using Wurmslayer with an FBSS, which I didn't have while I was using my Velium sword duo. I will still defend my choice of Wurmslayer, by saying that not only is reduced delay on a 25 damage weapon some good, but reduced delay on weapons that are good taunt stuffs without haste = not good. Besides, I would argue that a 25/40 beats the pants off a 10/24 any day for damage anyway.<br><br><br>p/s oh yeah, forgot...

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well, there is an Everquest Strategy Guide you could buy. Look for it online, you will find it somewhere. Or you could go on over to eq.castersrealm.com (type it exactly like that, NO www in front)and take a look at the Ranger section. It has strategies on how to play a Ranger and other nice stuff. Really, though, most of it you will learn over time. Have no worries, you will be ok. Just have fun playing and pick up on things you see that are positive. It will all work out for you. Hehe, I remember when I had my first Ranger, I hunted over in Qeynos Hills forever and rarely saw another soul. I didn't even know other people played the game!!! I had my Rusy Sword and was going to town on the beetles, bats, and skellys. It was great!!! As a matter of fact, I almost wish I could go back to that, it was probably funner back then!<br><br>Hope that helps a little bit, cya.<br>&nbsp;<br>Izzy Jizzy<br>57th Dark Elf Rogue<br><br>Spinn Sappa<br>19th Wood Elf Ranger<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I just like to let you guys know how much a ranger sucks a being a class...<br><br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure a ranger cant tank, but this is pathetic.  A rogue can tank much better then a ranger could.  If you go look at all the skill caps listed below, the rogue surpasses the ranger in every one except i believe dodge, they are tied.  Also, as mentioned previously on the board, a test went on to see how long a ranger could tank a black and compare it to a warrior.  I do reallize that rangers are not a tanking class, but you have to take some hits.  The warrior lasted 3 times longer then the ranger.  That means that the warrior died once, but the ranger died 3 times.  (they were the same level, same HP, and all that other crap, except not same class).  I am well aaware of this how a ranger cannot tank, that is why i compared them to a class that cannot tank as well.<br><br>2)  Sure you get some nice utility spells, but arent they all on items now. But with the release of Kunark and velious, everyone can use them...<br><br>Sow-               Jboots<br>Invigor-           Cobalt BP<br>Strength of Earth- Cobalt Boots<br>Invis-             Cobalt Greaves<br>Infravision-       Cobalt Helm<br>Chloroplast-       Fungi Tunic<br>Root-              Crystaline Silk net<br>Snare-             Silken Whip of Ensnaring<br><br>there are plenty more, but i need not bore you.  This should be adequete to show that with this equipment, a warrior can almost be ranger like.<br><br>3) Damage Output, you guys seem to think you can deal as much damage as a monk, maybe you could before level 50, but after, monks leave you behind.  Ill leave rogues out of this because im sure we all realize a rogue out damages all melees.<br><br>In conclusion, the ranger, sure i know its not a tanking class, but its skill is really pathetic.  Two, with the relious of Kunark and Velious, a warrior could almost be ranger like, just minus track and the DD's. Three, the damage output is not quite up to par.<br><br>Defensive Skill Chart<br><br>Defense:<br>Warrior-252<br>Rogue-  252<br>Ranger- 200<br><br>Rogue wins there<br><br>Dodge:<br>Warrior- 175<br>Rogue-   200<br>Ranger-  200<br><br>its a tie<br><br>Parry:<br>Warrior-230<br>Rogue-  230<br>Ranger- 220<br><br>Rogue wins again<br><br>Riposte:<br>Warrior- 225<br>Rogue-   225<br>Ranger-  150<br><br>Owch, ranger loses big there.<br><br>Raw AC gained from full suit of kunark Armor<br>(Cobalt, Mrylokar's, and Tolan's)<br><br>Warrior- 220<br>Rogue-   155<br>Ranger-  155<br><br>Damn, I am the man<br>&nbsp;<br>Kildiar, The Shadow Knight Innoruuk Rejected<br><br><br><br>"Rangers suck, no argument there."</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Okay, at least this time RangerFlama (we all know who he really is) isn't being vulgar or obnoxious with his post.&nbsp;&nbsp;He presents valid reasons for why he does not like rangers and I, being a ranger, dont think this post should be buried.  It is presented in a logical and organized manner, worthy of a place on the ranger forum.  <br><br>What I am trying to say is dont bury it, give it an excellent rating.  This way, we can all read it and see how the numbers are all against us and how bad we all suck.  Then, in our depressed and miserable mood, we can log on, track down some poor, weak, cowardly dark elf shadow knights, dual them and kill them, ponder our weakness an ineffectiveness, track down an ogre warrior or two, dual them and waste them, ponder our faults and obstacles to success, wander around and think how mega cool we look and how legendary the exploits of the ranger are throughout Norrath and much of fantasy literature.<br><br>By the way, RangerFlama, I am sure all your numbers are accurate and seem to make the ranger weaker, but you vastly underestimate the intangibles.  I play on a PVP server.  I have a pretty twinked Dwarf Paladin there.  I can tell you this, the one class that has given me more trouble than any other is the ranger.  They kill me with ease.  Yet I can battle warriors, SKs, Shamans (no prob) and casters.  Monks give me some trouble, especially Futoshi, who is an Iksar Monk.  Yet the two most feared classes are druids and then rangers (hrmm - a druid hybrid).  And before you get any ideas, everyone on Tallon Zek is twinked, and twinked heavily.  You do not survive there if you do not have superior items.   All classes and all races are twinked.<br><br>I gave you an excellent rating.  Of all your #!@&!* posts this was the best one.  Keep it up. Have discussions with rangers.  By the way, I see you mention absolutley nothing about Shadow Knights, your own weasily class.  They are not feared on PVP, but necros are.<br><br>So, the numbers on rangers don't add up.  They look weak on paper.  Yet, a well played ranger always seems to come out on top.  It's kind of like the New York Yankees.  They don't look too good on paper, yet they just keep winning and winning and winning and winning.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hmmm, I did not know you play on a PVP server.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most interesting.  I choose to play the Paladin on PVP because I didnt want two characters of the same class as my mains.  Also, I thought the LOH of the paladin would be a unique weapon on PVP, and it has turned out to be true.  Many casters have expended all of their mana to get me down to half a bubble of health only to have me suddenly at full health and rooting and blinding them.  Since you play PVP, you know how it goes.<br><br>I kid you not, rangers on Tallon Zek are pretty formidable.  I don't even attempt to mess with druids, it's useless.  Necros, if you do not resist their first spell, will debuff you and cause a lot of trouble and slow you down.  A few of the nasty rangers I've run into are also xteamers, which I really hate.<br><br>I don't know what to say to you really.  I mean, my ranger does pretty good on the Torv Server.  I thoroughly enjoy roleplaying him and he can hold his own in many dangerous zones.  I just have to be careful.  When I am grouped I stay away from aggro and use it only when necessary.  I think I play my ranger pretty well and I believe my ranger self would easily defeat my paladin self.  I don't dislike my ranger at all.<br><br>Good Luck to You Foe!  Too bad everybody will bury your newer, more acceptable posts.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ironhom Hammerforge<br>Paladin of Kaladim<br>Chivalric Order<br><br><br><br><br></td></tr>
