	   <tr><td colspan=2>My prefernce in all roleplaying games is to be an elf, so I'm biased. If you want to travel safely in cities, be a High Elf. If you like a challenge and being able to see places in the game most people don't, be a Dark Elf. Also, I have a Mage, Druid and Necro and can say that using the one handed (1H Blunt) staff as your melee weapon in the beginning will pay off later. Better damage in the long run (even with higher delay). Either buy a 1H Blunt staff or just arm one that a mob drops. On pets: you'll end up using water or earth all the time anyway, so I'll spare you the money wasting of buying air or fire pets until later levels when their specific talents become useful. Also, buy True North and keep Divination maxed because you'll need that when Invisibility becomes available.<br>Hope this helps a bit.<br>&nbsp;<br>Aaneldarie Tura'Seorsa<br>29th Season Magician&nbsp;&nbsp;Vazaelle</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Greetings young mage!<br>Actually, with that much platinum, you can buy stuff that will last you until well into your 40s. One thing you should look for are +int rings/earring. You can get a couple of earrings that are +4 int/+2 str, which would be great because you will need a little boost in your str for carrying loot. They are called golden sapphire earrings I believe. Not sure on the cost on your server, but I have gotten them for about 150pp an earring. You can also get you a runed circlet that is +4 int/wis that is good, should cost you about 100pp at most. Or, if you are lucky, you can purchase you your mage robe for about 350pp to 500pp. Again the prices may vary on your server. I play on Bertox so the economy is a lot different. lol But the main thing I would use your money on is to get +int rings, earring, necklace, or bracers. If you can get good deals, then you may be able to buy stuff that will last you WELL past your 20s.<br><br>Hope it helps.<br><br>Vaelek<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Greetings fellow Mages =)<br>I have read through the replies to your question and have found some misinformation. First off, the pet will STILL follow you if you use /guard me, just like it does when you use /follow me. The only main difference is that there is a chance that the pet will just agro and attack something that is too close to you if you are using /guard me, instead of /follow me. One thing though that I have found. Is that at the higher lvls (36 right now but noticed it back in the low 20s) is that my pets do not agro much on things anymore and just go off and attack things that wander too close. I have found that on occasion it will attack something that has zero'd in on me while I am medding or something and attack it just before it gets to me. I think, with the things that I have seen from my own pets, is that the pet has an "agro meter" of sorts. It measure how hostile something is to you, and how dangerous that something is to you (what it cons to you) and also whether it is coming in to attack or not. When you use the /guard (anything) commands, this "meter" is turned on. If a monster starts coming in for the attack, the pet zero's in on the most dangerous, which in most cases is the first one that tries to hit you, and then sets out on the offensive. Whereas, if you are using the /follow me command, the pet just sits there and waits until you command it or you get into trouble. Another difference I have found with the /guard commands is that the pet ALWAYS faces the closest enemy. I have used this tactic when camping out in the wild or in a closed in area. I tell my pet to /guard here, thus keeping him from pacing back and forth or getting in my face, and then watch to see which way he turns. Then I step out a little ways in that direction and normally can see what he is looking at. It is a great tactic for your party puller to use. I have found that many other classes, and maybe some mages, don't know about this or realize it and how useful it can be. I hardly every use /follow me anymore, since my pet hardly ever agros off onto stuff. But one thing that you might want to keep in mind, I do not hunt in dungeons much, mainly out in the open. <br><br>Now on the comment about you not know how to command your pet. No wonder mages have a bad name! I mean, WTF man? All you have to do is the /pet back off&nbsp;&nbsp;command until your pet backs off. If it doesn't work once, then KEEP DOING IT!!! and your pet will back off. Then you just use the /assist &lt;target&gt; command to target the monster that everyone is fighting and then send in your pet. If you have to, use the /pet get lost command to desummon your pet if it is causing too much trouble. Or if it is too far away, just use invisibility or hide and it will disappear automatically no matter where it is. You can always summon a new pet, so there is no sense in letting it get away and bringing back trouble. In a party, you should have no trouble /backing off with your pet. Most times, the monsters are agro'd onto the players, so your pet isn't getting hit. And if it is, and the enchanter is trying to mez it, then keep using the /back off command until yer damn pet backs off. I can switch targets in the middle of a fight, get the mob off of the healer until help arrives or it is mez'd, and then get the pet back onto the first target. All in the middle of battle. Don't be afraid to move around or to call off your pet. It is better to have the pet sitting there doing nothing, than messing up a mez in a nasty fight.<br><br>Well that is just my opinion, hope it helps someone. =)<br><br>Vaelek<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>&gt;I mean, WTF man? All you have to do is the /pet back off command until your pet backs off. If it doesn't work once, then KEEP DOING IT!!! and your pet will back off. <br><br>Ok, two questions.<br><br>First, if a pet gets hit, will it or will it not hit back even if previously backed off?<br><br>Second, if a mob has been hit by a pet and no other action has been taken that earns more hate, will it or will it not continue hitting the pet?<br><br>My impression is yes to both questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you've got a mob that's hitting your pet, and you've got your pet that keeps retaliating.  Why would /pet back off ever work?  If you "KEEP DOING IT!!!," the mob will KEEP hitting your pet, and your pet will KEEP getting started hitting it again.  <br><br>If a mez lands at a moment when the laggy system decides that a /pet back off has just landed, great.  If a mez lands at a moment when the laggy system decides a blow from the mob has just landed, the pet would be very likely to hit once before the next /pet back off works its way through cyberspace to the server.  <br><br>Then, if things work the way I think they do, you would have a backed-off pet, a woken-up mob, and a ticked-off dead enchanter.<br><br>So in one sense, you're right: it would get the pet backed off eventually.  But what I was really asking was whether there was a way of backing a pet off from a mob that's still hitting it, *before* the mob gets aggroed onto your cleric or enchanter.<br><br>I've never had an enchanter volunteer to die in the name of science and let me test this out, so I don't really know for sure.  (My RL brother's primary is a druid, so I've spent a lot of time hunting giants and other outdoor kite fodder, so my time in groups based on enchanter crowd control has been limited.)  But as I level, I'm more and more likely to be in that situation. So far, I've always just been careful not to let my pet get aggroed on by part of a big pull, to the point of not summoning one if there's no place to keep them out of combat until things are under control.  <br> <br>&nbsp;<br>Necro 53 of Nighthaven<br>on Cazic-Thule</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Just as a word of advice, Erudite magicians start off kill-on-sight with all Paineel residents, so it's not so easy as to just waltz in and start fighting in Paineel. You might get away with it if you don't turn in your newbie note, but you'll be robeless for a few levels if you do that.<br><br>If you want to fight in the Warrens, you'll be fine by the time you're at that level, so you can slip into Paineel with few problems. The guards look undead, but they can't see through invisibility, so just cast invisibility on yourself and run like the wind until you get well past the guards. Your level 4 pet just isn't good enough for dungeon fighting, and the entrance to the Warrens is a pretty hazzardous area for trains.<br><br>I never had a problem with night vision as an Erudite. At levels 1-4, I just used True North to find my way back to town, and after that my wisp stone, plus True North, plus Sense Summoned helped me get my bearings really easily. Also, most of the nice camp spots in Toxxulia are right by the zone wall or river, so they're easy to get to. And remember, once you hit level 16 you will never worry about night vision again.<br><br>But gnomes are pretty good magicians, too, and they're adorably cute, and Steamfont is such a nice zone up until you get Bind Affinity. After that, you can pretty much fight anywhere you want.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have noticed that there have been a SWARM of newbies ever since I stopped actively playing EQ.<br><br>In any case, none of the are 'the best.' They are all better or worse than each other in certain situations.<br><br>The earth pet is good for soloing very big mobs. It will last the longest, and does a very good job with a damage shield on it. Plus it roots a lot which helps for if you want to nuke a lot. The downside of the earth pet is that its root spell will stop fleeing enemies, which in some cases is not a good thing. Why not? Becuase when an enemy is fleeing your pet can kill it until it dies and take no damage. If that same fleeing mob is rooted, then the mob will keep attacking your pet, and your pet will take longer to regen after the thing is dead. Also, when you are in a close fighting and the mob suddenly stops fleeing becuase it is rooted, and attacks your pet, your pet might die.<br><br>The water pet is your normal all-around pet. Good hp, good agility, good damage...but not the best in any categorie. Two additional benefits of the water pet is that it regnerates HP faster than other pets and that it is totally immune to poison. If you are fighting things that poison, or you don't know which pet would be best to use, try out the water pet.<br><br>The air pet is good for not only soloing low blue cons, but also for fighting casting mobs. The air pet has the most agility of all the pets, which means once you get to about level 20, you will see a noticible difference in how much it gets hit compared to the other pets. The air pet casts a stun spell, which in addition to interupping things that cast spells, the stun has a very high taunt factor, and will keep the monster off of you and on the air pet. Plus, the air pet casts invisibility on itself, which makes it good for when you want to wander around dungeons. The bad thing about the air is that it has low hp and that until about level 20, its high agility won't do much since the pets' defensive skills are not very high.<br><br>The fire pet is good for when you want to do a lot of damage or kill something very quickly. If you want to kill mulitple low blue mobs, then you can use the fire pet to kill them very quickly. The fire pets damage shield that is casts on itself is much better than the one you can cast, and is the main reason to why the fire pet dishes out so much damage. Besides the damage shield the fire pet also casts a fire based direct damage spell a lot, which adds additional damage. The fire pet has HORRID hitpoints, so don't use it against monsters that are bigger than you, it will die quickly. It is best used against low blues, because it won't die nearly as quickly and can dish out a lot of damage. Also, in a group setting the fire pet is a good damage dealer.<br><br>Also, an additional note, if you are soloing, make sure you do more damage than your pet(ie. take off 51% or a little more of the monster's hitpoints with your direct damage spells). If you don't outdamage your pet, it will get half the exp. for the kill. If you do outdamage your pet, you get full exp. for the kill.<br><br>Former Addict of Everquest.<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I agree with you that there is absolutely no reason to train any in conjuration or evocation; you will use those skills so often that they will always be high.<br><br>Divination and abjuration you won't use as much, but they're important to keep up anyway. Thankfully, if your skill is a little low, you can just cast Sense Summoned or Minor Shielding on yourself while waiting for a boat or whatnot and your skills will raise quite nicely.<br><br>The big bear, though, is alteration. You don't get any alteration spells at all until level 8, I believe, and you won't use that pet heal spell enough to get your skill up very high. You'll use burnout (another alteration skill) pretty frequently after level 12, but that alone isn't going to raise your skill very high either.<br><br>However, at level 24 you get your first Malise spell, which is alteration based and will become a very important spell for you the further you progress through the game, so it's really important to work on alteration at least at this point.<br><br>If you want to be a little thrifty with your practice points, save all you can and put a few into alteration, because it will be the single hardest skill to raise and you will be pretty frustrated at level 24 if your skill is too low.<br><br>But do save up a few skill points for later. You'll be thankful when you use up six Words of Fizzle trying to make your level 39 pets because your research skill is horrible. Just bite the bullet and spend the plat on training so you can put the grimoire back on the bookshelf and go out and kill more stuff. :-)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

TG someone saved my ass and i got on boat asap to get outta there.  went to oasis, soloed way to 20 again, then went to lake of ill omen.  ill omen is KING for bout that lvl, got to 26, then started soloing in omen again.  got lvl 29 and went into frontier mnts.  got lvl 30, then went to overthere to realize that the exp sucked at my lvl and went back to FM to finish off the hell lvl.  i took peoples advice and took the raft from nro to iceclad in velious to take cougars.  GREAT exp and loot.  i got like 4 cougar claw earings (sell for bout 500pp) from rolls and lvl 34 i headed out for spells and to the overthere again.  just yesterday i got lvl 35 in overthere.  so now im in oasis, spectre and SG groups when i can.  so thats my route of travels lvls 1-35, wish me luck on gettin outta this hell lvl ;)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

After you gain a few more levels you will be able to hunt treants in south karana and druids/treants in east karana for TONS of money. Also, if you are low on money go to wisp isle in erud's crossing and kill every wisp you see. Then turn in the greater lightstones at the gypsy camp in north karana to get the concordanance of research book. After you get the book, sell it back to the gypsy lady for 9pp. This works best from levels 8-16, becuase during those levels you will still be getting exp. for the wisps.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I recently did this with my Mage who had hit 20. I went to South karana(the Karana with Splitpaw next to it) and near one of the corners is a hut with a door that does not open. Summon your water pet, go up to the side of the hut when 100% mana and health, and say "Kill you" about 3 times. A hermit(ranger) will rush out, he hits kinda hard for level 20-22, but has low hps. All you need to do is nuke about 2-3 times depending on level to do half damage, and then heal pet accordingly. This guy gives AWESOME exp for 20-25. He also drops a Fine Steel 2Hander about 75% of the time. The best part is HE IS ON A 3MINUTE SPAWN TIME!!!!!!!!!!! of course, this means you will have to use your Water or Air pet because the earth pet will not be able to regen enough health in 3 mins to go again.<br> After he pops again, target your pet, and type /assist. You will get a target on him, so just nuke with your Shock of _____ spell to get him out, and send pet in. Wait for a bit, Nuke, Nuke, Heal pet, Watch the exp flow. Give 1 Fine steeler to your pet so he hits for 24 each time. FS2Handers go for about 5pp to merchants, so that is about 75pp per hour, even more if you can get a newbie to buy it off you for about 10pp. Thats pretty good for about 4 hours per level=about 300pp per level at level 20!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THAT IS SIMPLY AMAZING. So after 5 levels, i have about 2k from one camp, im level 25, and i finally bought myself that damn Stein of Moggok.Talk about being Happy-you can too!<br><br><br>Zomor Soulsaver-Paladin of the 45th circle and a successful Champion of Brell.<br><br>Gnobole Mindshreader-Magician of the 25th season<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Fighting willowisps is a good moneymaker for level 8-12, but frankly, you can do better after level 12. Frankly, the wisps do not drop greater lightstones all that frequently. You'll be lucky to get one greater lightstone per 7-10 kills, and the experience slows to a crawl after level 12 or so.<br><br>Lavastorm is a great mage-friendly money zone. Keep a dimensional pocket for dervish rocks, and sell those off to the gypsies for 4gp apiece. The other loot is lightweight, stackable, and (except for fire drake scales) sells for anywhere from 3gp to 1pp apiece. Gems, eggs, sacs of bile, more gems (lots of gems in this zone). Drakes and rock dervishes will also drop coin, averaging about 2gp apiece. It doesn't sound like just a whole lot, but the mobs drop lots of loot, so it all really adds up. You don't kill a green mob only to find out it has a "burned out lightstone" on it.<br><br>Higher level elementals and lava crawlers will also drop research words, pages, and runes, so it's a good way to start up a collection. I found a nice collection of level 16-20 words.<br><br>A big, big advantage of this zone is that most of the loot stacks, so you can just pile it in the bank and sell it to your guild merchants when you go back to buy your next round of spells.<br><br>If you have no love for dark elves, there is a dark elven guard outside the entrance to Lavastorm who spawns in the level 14-17 range. You and your level 16 pet will take him down with ease, and he'll respawn right about the time you get up to full mana. He also *always* drops a bronze longsword, so you get a little experience and a guaranteed 2pp5gp per kill. <br><br>By the time you've finished getting experience from this zone, you're ready to carefully start picking off gargoyles in the Ocean of Tears. They seem to drop an average of one gargoyle eye per two kills, so that's a 4pp kill with good experience. If you've been soloing up to this point, you'll know how to keep from getting frenzied by the other gargoyles.<br><br>Then, of course, you hit your high 20s/early 30s and start buying gems for focus items, and it's back to practicing your begging skill on the merchants, but that's another story =)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>You can get a decent amount of experience and loot right in your own back yard hunting drakes and the occasional elemental beyond the windmills in Steamfont.<br><br>Around level 10 or so, go get yourself bound in Freeport and use invisibility to sneak through Nektalos Forest to Lavastorm. Excellent fighting there, and really good loot. The fire drakes drop putrid bile and gems; lava basilisks drop eggs and eyestalks which sell for several gold apiece. After level 12, your shielded, burned out pet should be able to take a beating from the rock dervishes. Use your weightless bags to hold the bricks of ore, which sell for 4gp to the gypsies in Lavastorm.<br><br>Most of the loot in Lavastorm is lightweight and stackable, so you can take the boat back to Ak'anon and sell to your guild merchants for better prices every couple of levels. Bloodstones are common gem drops here, so split the difference between merchant buy/sell price and auction them off to clerics and paladins.<br><br>If you can take out the occasional wandering fire goblin, they frequently drop soot hemlock, which sells for a pretty penny as well.<br><br>Most drakes and dervishes drop an average of 2gp; sometimes it's silver and copper, sometimes it's as high as 6gp. Imps and sprites are stingy; basilisks, elementals, and lava crawlers don't seem to have pockets but do drop gems or other loot.<br><br>A lot of high level players wander this zone on the way to the various dungeons, so you'll often sit down to meditate and stand up to find you've been gifted with some decent buffs by generous enchanters and druids.<br><br>The money and experience is comparable to fighting wisps (which don't drop the greater lightstones very often; maybe one drop in ten), and only the wandering elementals will give you trouble. All the other mobs are non-social and non-aggressive, so you can pick and choose what you fight fairly easily. Just stay away from the northern reaches, where the crocodiles will give you a run for your money if you get too close.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Kadthar here,<br><br>This will be a long post.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm going to describe exactly how I went through getting the pet spells for Levels 16 and 20.  This comes from the perspective of an Erudite magician or a human magician starting out of Qeynos, so if you're a high elf, dark elf, or gnome, or a human out of Freeport, the process can be much simplified.<br>First, I started from Qeynos. If you're on Odus, the trip to Qeynos is only a quick boat ride, so it shouldn't be a big deal to start out your trip there.  The first thing you'll need to do is get to Highpass.  There is another way through, but I believe it would be more difficult.  Getting to Higpass is pretty simple, though, particularly if you're invisible.  You pass through Qeynos Hills, West Karana, North Karana and East Karana on the way there.  This trip is not too difficult to find your way through....you need to follow the paths and the sign markers which will direct you to Highpass.  You should definitely be invisible through North and East Karana if you're Level 16 or about, though it's probably a good idea to be invisible in West Karana, too, just to make sure that none of the few dangerous creatures there bother you.  The only place where there will be any question of which way to go is in West Karana, as there are several intersections on the path to North Karana, not all of which have a path marker.  Most (if not all) of the alternate paths will be dead ends eventually, leading either to one of the various farms, bandit camps, or in one case, to the ogre camp.  This is the one you particularly want to avoid as some of the ogres see invisible creatures.  When the path forks near the two-spawn bandit spot in the road, take the direction where the bandits spawn.  The other way will lead to the ogres.  Otherwise, as long as you're invisible, you should be safe, even if you mistakenly choose the wrong path.<br>Once you've gone through the Karanas, and have arrived in Highpass, I suggest you bind yourself there as I did.  It is a better place to come back to if you die further on than going back all the way to Qeynos.  This is particularly important at this point as you're nearing Freeport and have to pass through Kithicor to get there.  Again, it's absolutely essential to be invisible when going through Kithicor as it is a dangerous zone.  Furthermore, I had been warned to only travel there during the day.  I followed this warning and that is probably the reason I got through the whole trip without dying.  Go past the orc camp in Highpass and from there you will enter Kithicor.  It is a good idea to be invisible even while in Highpass, as the orc camp will cause you problems if you aren't.  When you go into Kithicor if it is day, and early enough that you don't feel that you'll have night fall on you in the forest, you can travel the zone safely by remaining invisible and hugging the zone wall. (Ideally, you'll want to remain high on the wall.)  If it is night, wait invisible near the zone border (or in Highpass preferably) until day breaks.  Hug the right wall as you come out of Highpass and keep going until you reach the entrance to West Commons.  The only creature I saw while I was in the zone during the day was the leader of the Shralok orcs, and he didn't see me.  Once you're in West commons, follow the north wall (the left wall) into East commons and from there continue to follow the same wall into Freeport.  In West Commons, there is one undead camp on the wall you'll want to avoid....I suppose it's best to avoid all the camps, which you can do quite easily if you're invisible.  There is one zone entrance on this wall in East commons, into Nektulos, but you'll ignore it.<br>Now that you're in West Freeport, you'll need to go into East Freeport and catch the boat into the Ocean of Tears.  This is the point that humans from Freeport will start their journey, a much shorter one.  Also, once a dark elf sneaks into Freeport after traveling through Nektulos and East Commons, he or she will start the journey here as well.  Gnomes and High Elves will have to ride the boat to Freeport from Butcherblock, but there is no need to actually stop in Freeport, as any mage needs to catch the boat here to get these spells.  There may be a long wait for the boat to arrive, but after catching it, the ride will be short.  You will need to ride the boat into the Ocean of Tears, and get off on the first island, which is called Sister Island.  This is where the trip becomes a problem for dark elves, though all other races (depending possibly upon religion) should be fine all the way through.  Travel along the coast of Sister Island to the right, also invisible here, until you get to a dwarven camp.  The invisibility is necessary here as there are some unfriendly pirates roaming the island.  From the dwarf camp, swim out to an island that should be visible here, with a tower on it.  At this tower is the high elf merchant that sells your Level 16 and 20 pet spells, along with various other magician spells.  Invisibility is good here, also, as there is a cyclops on this island that will probably eat you if he sees you.  Since your invisibility will drop when you purchase the spells, it is a good idea to have your sound up when you get to this island as the thumping noise will warn you when the cyclops in near.  Purchasing these spells is also a problem for dark elves, or so I've heard, and could be for others depending on religion and other faction issues.  Once you've purchased your pet spells, the easiest way to make the return trip is to gate back to whatever safe bind point you left from, unless there is some hunting you want to do in the Ocean of Tears.

What you have in a pet is virtually another tank correct ? so if you have a level 30 pet its another 30 warrior for the group. To add to that magicians have some of the highest DD Spells around. What better to have then to have a 50 + mage in the group sitting off to the back casting DD spells for 300 HP of damage on a mob that tough for the group ?? I say mages are damn good in groups IF the person knows how to play a mage. For example if you get agged on, dont run around like a bitch, stand there and dont do JACK and let the tanks get them off of you thats what they are there for in the group. if your in a good group the tanks will protect you because they NEED your dd spells. Not only that your pet will die trying to agg the mob off of you.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I must say that I have to disagree with some of the other here I would have to rate it this way.<br><br>1) Druids - If you look all the way from 1 to 60, Druids are the best soloers going. Their ability to solo yellow mobs into their 40's, and quad kite has to put them over the edge on this.<br><br>2) Necros - Possibly the best choice if you want to be able to solo and have very lil downtime. I know that I love my Necro for Soloin.<br><br>3) Wizards - Adequate soloers at lower levels, but in upper levels Wizards are able to start quad kiting and are simply amazing for Soloing.<br><br>4) Shadow Knights - Not great soloers in the mid levels (although still very possible), by later levels they are the best true melee soloer.<br><br>5) Bards - Much like Shadow Knights Bards may have some problems soloing for a few levels, but once they get their Fear Song, they may be one of the best Soloers out there in the later levels.<br><br>6) Mages - The mage pet is great, but unfortunately there you have to be very careful about the Mob that you try to solo. You will also have a great deal of down time unless you have <br>clarity. There also is no way to quad kite so you can not boost your efficiency. The one plus about the Mage is, it is possible to solo indoors. Mages also are one of the best classes for farming indoors (assuming lots of green mobs). A mage pet is very good at handling multiple green mobs with a lil AE help.<br><br>7) Enchanters. An enchanter with JBoots may be the best soloer out there. Although I've never played an enchanter, a good enchanter can Solo very efficiently with the Charm method. Allowing one mob to kill another, you get xp for the dead one and your charmed Mob may also be about dead, thus giving you two kills with very lil mana expence. Let me add, this method seems the most challenging, but also most exciting. I hope I can start an enchanter soon.<br><br>This is of course my opinion, but quad kiting and fear certainly makes for the best soloers all around.<br><br>I must also disagree with the statement that all classes can solo equally well, and that it all depends on the player. Certain classes are inherantly more adept at soloing. For example, although a cleric can solo, the spells that they have do not lend to soloing very efficiently.<br><br>Good Luck to you,<br><br>Peredur<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Its hard to say the top five soloing classes. In my mind there is a top 7 to the soloing classes.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#8217;s a bit too hard to put into a top 5.<br><br>In no particular order, here are the 7 classes that I think are the best soloers:<br><br>Bards<br>Necromancers<br>Magicians<br>Enchanters<br>Druids<br>Shaman<br>Wizards<br><br>Now all of these classes start becoming good soloers at different levels and they also gain/lose power throughout the levels. Although once you get to about level 50, soloing for any class isn't very effective. Here are some more in-depth descriptions of these 7 soloing classes, and also how I rated them. The rating I gave them was based on their overall soling ability from levels 1 to 50. So just because one class can solo better than another class at a certain level, it doesn't mean that they are overall a better soloer.<br><br>1. Necromancers - This really isn't much of a surprise. Necromancers are extremely strong soloers from level 1 all the way up to 50. They simply have all the right stuff: snares, fears, pets, extremely mana efficient DoT's, very good mana regen, and several ways to escape from death. Necromancers are surpassed by a couple of other classes at certain levels and in certain situations as far as soloing goes, but overall they are simply the best at it.<br><br>2. Bards - This one might surprise a lot of people. At lower levels bards can melee well and then have very little downtime afterwards because of their healing song. At the lower-mid levels bards can kite nearly as well as a druid, and then have no downtime afterwards since their songs take no mana. Then starting at level 27 bards become VERY good soloers, because of their charm spell. It takes practice, but I have seen bards do wondrous things with it. Charm a mob and then send it after another mob, re-charming as needed. Once the mob you charmed has killed off the target, it will be at low life, and you can kite it around and kill it quickly. Once it is all said and done you have killed two things and can start right over again since you didn't need to use mana to do it.<br><br>3. Magicians - This one isn't too hard to figure out. Magicians have extremely good pets and nice direct damage spells, along with great damage shields. These abilities give a magician the power to kill things just as well as a necromancer. However, magicians have no mana regaining spells. Plus, magicians have almost no way to escape from death if their pet dies. The only two ways are gate and strafe-running, both of which can fail all too easily. However, don't let that bring you down. Magicians ARE good soloers or else I wouldn't have put them as number 3. <br><br><br>4. Enchanters - The soloing arts of the enchanter are quite different from that of the other classes. However, they can do it well if they so wish, using their wide variety of tactical approaches. The first way for the enchanter to solo is to use their pets, debuffs, and damage spells. They buff up their pet, engage an enemy using a resistance debuff, and back up and cast DD's and DoT's on the mobs. The DD's of the enchanter are mana efficient after using a form of tashan, however they have a long recast time and a huge taunt factor. The DoT's of the enchanter are very mana efficient and have a small debuff effect in them, however the DoT's enchanters get are spread out pretty far in-bewteen the levels, so they get new versions later. The pets of the enchanter are fairly weak. They can deal out decent damage, however they tank very poorly and can not be commanded like other pets. This tactic works best during the lower and mid levels. <br>     The other way of an enchanter soloing is to use their charm spells at a dual-spawn to charm one mob, and then kill the other one. After the non-charmed mob is dead, the charmed one will be at low life, so the enchanter can finish it off with a DD or two. The other way of using charm is to charm a mob that is extremely overpowered for its level, and kill tons of low blue cons with it. You need to have sow to do this however. Also, this tactic doesn't work until an enchanter gets their higher level forms of charm. The level 12 one simply doesn't work very well.  These two tactics alone aren't what make the enchanter a good soloer, however. In addition to these tactic enchanters have many ways to escape from death and good mana regening spells to cut down on downtime.<br><br>5. Druids - As yes the druids. Good direct damage spells, good damage over time spells, wonderful damage shields, roots, snares, harmony, heals, and movement increasing spells. Druids can solo quite well. At lower levels druids can buff themselves up, kill something with melee and damage spells, and then heal themselves afterwards. Once they get to the higher levels, they start using different tactics. The first, and most common, is to snare a mob, and then run around using one of their movement enhancing spells, and casting direct damage spells along the way. This tactic allows a druid to kill thing risk-free. The other tactic is rooting a mob, and then casting DoT's on it, and meditating while it is rooted. This version is a little harder, because you have to re-root the mob every so often, but it works well also. In addition to these things druids also get the harmony spell which allows them to solo entire camps by themselves.  Plus, on top of all that, druids get teleportation spells which actually makes them a little better as soloers, because they can get to new hunting spots faster.<br>     What is the downside? Well druids have no mana regen spells (except at level 60, but that doesn't really count) and the way in which the kill things is not quite as efficient as how a magician or necromancer would. This makes the druid have more downtime than the other classes listed about them. However, because of snare and sow/wolfform, they are virtually unkillable because they can just run to the zone before something can kill them. Also, another version of druid soloing is to snare 4 mobs, and then run around and cast AoE damage spells on them. While this way is very mana efficient, it takes a long time to not only get down right, but to also perform. Not to mention that it is fairly risky and incurs a HUGE downtime.<br><br>6. Shaman - Shaman are pretty good soloers. They have powerful DoT's, good de-buffs, all right DD's, heal spells, pets (at higher levels, and only weak ones), mana regen spells, and SOW. At lower levels a shaman can buff themselves up and then debuff an enemy and use DoT's and melee to kill it. If anything goes wrong they can outrun the enemy using their sow spell. This works fairly well, but it isn't nearly as good as what other classes can do. Shamans really don't become really good soloers until level 34, which is when they their first pet. Even though the pet is weak, it DOES do extra damage and lets the shaman tank less, because the pet can take some hits.      <br>     Before shaman get their pet they can use the same soloing tactics as a druid (root/DoT or kite with DD's). Shaman are not as good as a druid though because their root spell isn't nearly as good, and they don't have a snare spell to help them kite. However, at 24, they DO get a mana regen spell, although it is not as good as the ones of the necromancer or enchanter. Pretty much, before shaman get their pets, they are all right soloers. After they get their pets, they are good soloers. <br><br>7. Wizards - The last in the line of the top 7 soloers. Before level 29 a wizard can do good soloing if they have sow. With sow, their powerful direct damage spells allow them to run around and kill an enemy with a good mana efficiency. However, wizards can't cast sow, so there are sometime problems with getting it. Also, since they don't get a snare spell before level 29, it takes them more running-around time to kill an enemy. Also, wizards have no form of mana regen before level 34 and don't have many good ways to escape death.<br>    Now once wizards get to level 29 everything changes. They get a snare spell at this level which allows them to kite better, because they won&#8217;t have to run as much. Also, once wizards get their snare spell, they can start quad-kiting as druids do, except they can do it BETTER than druids because of more mana efficient area effect damage spells. Although since wizards don&#8217;t have sow, they have to get it from other classes or by buying sow potions. Sow isn&#8217;t actually a necessity for quad-kiting, but it is VERY helpful. Of course, quad-kiting is quite risky, can only be done in certain spots, and has a LOT of downtime. However, at level 34 wizards get a mana regen spell that helps out a bit. It isn&#8217;t nearly as good as the enchanter or necromancer mana regens, or even as good as the shaman mama regen, but it does help. Also, like druids wizards have teleportation spells which helps them get to new hunting spots quicker.<br><br>Everything I have written is simply my opinion, so take it as you will.  Also, just because I listed one class as a better soloer than another class, it doesn&#8217;t mean that they solo A LOT better, or that they are better soloers at EVERY level.  The ratings I gave the classes were how well they soloed OVERALL from 1 to 50.  For example, someone might say that a level 34 wizard solos better than a druid because they have a mana regen spell and a much better direct damage spell. That would be true, however think about the wizard before level 29. Druids were better soloers at those levels, so they had a higher cumulative rating. Also, please remember that these are the best soloing classes in the game. Just because I gave the necromancer a 1 rating, and the druid a 5 rating, it doesn&#8217;t mean that the necromancer is WAY better than the druid and that druid sucks at soloing. The differences in soloing levels between each rating is VERY minor. For example, even though a magician got a 3 rating, and the shaman got a 6, it doesn&#8217;t mean that the magician is some god compared to the shaman. Also take note that I have NOT played the wizard and druid classes up to a decent level, and what I wrote about them was simply what I have seen and heard about from friends. So please remember all of these important details.<br><br>I hope you enjoyed my post. If you don&#8217;t agree with me then at least you had the satisfaction of being amused by what I thought. Email me if you have any questions&#8230;.. tim_gerber@yahoo.com.<br><br>Zuranthium Spellcrafter&lt;Elitists&gt; &#8211; Former level 50 Gnome Magician of The Tribunal server.<br>Corpusnuntia Nimtathan&lt;Valorguard&gt; - Former level 40 Erudite Necromancer of The Nameless server.<br><br>P.S. &#8211; PLEASE do not just sit in the game and do nothing but solo.  If you are doing that, then you are missing out on a huge part of the game. Try making friend, grouping with friends, roleplaying, dueling, and exploring an new area WITHOUT a map off of the internet. I think you will find the game much more enjoyable if you do.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Okay this got bumped back to the 3rd page so I am reposting it:<br><br>I am upgrading the guide to incorporate some Kunark stuff. I am also reposting this for Martinet who said it was her bible for magicians =:-) . <br><br>First off choose your race. I suggest putting 25 points into intelligence and 5 into charisma. Also, DON'T BE A HUMAN OR DARK ELF IF YOU ARE JUST STARTING THE GAME. Dark elves are evil and will get killed on sight by a lot of other races. Some people say humans level faster than every other race...well guess what..THEY DON'T. Plus humans start with the lowest intelligence and are blind in the night. Also, I wouldn't suggest being an Erudite if you are a newbie. They are nightblind and have THE WORST starting zone in the game. If you are just starting your character I suggest being a Gnome or High Elf. These races are good aligned, have infravision, and start on the continent of Faydwer...which is a MUCH more newbie oriented continent with less dangers. If you have experience with the game, be any race you want. If you don't like gnomes or high elves, at least just be one for a little bit to get used to the game. When you start give your note to your guildmaster and get your newbie robe. Put one training point into piercing, evocation, abjuration, conjuration, and channeling. Scribe your two newbie spells minor shielding and Burst of Flame. Always keep yourself buffed with minor shielding - it does make a big difference at low levels. Use Burst of Flame to help kill your enemy while you melee it. get to level 4...no big problem. <br><br>Now the fun starts. At level 4 you get new spells and the meditation skill. Only put one point into meditate. It will rise very quickly. You should buy Summon food, Summon water, Flare, Summon dagger (all level 1 spells)...Summon Bandages, Burn, Gate, level 4 earth pet, level 4 water pet. At level 4 you should only buy the earth and water pets. The air and fire ones aren't very useful at these levels, however will become much more useful at higher levels (especially the air pet!). Sense you can summon bandages it is a good idea to summon a lot of them and practice your bind wound skill. It will allow you to heal any player, including your self up to half health. Also at these lower levels it is a VERY good idea to give your pets rusty two-handed weapons (rusty scythes, two-handed swords, and halberds). They will make your pets do MASSIVE damage and allow you to take BIG things. Now from level 4 until 8 your fighting strategy will be simple: send your pet, nuke the MOB with your damage spell (called a DD for short, for all you newbies reading this), and go in and tank for a pet if needed. Since you started out as a gnome or high-elf like I told you to (you did didn't you, hehe), you will be able to kill kobolds to get to level 6. If you are a high elf just run to steamfont...its only a 5 minute run. If you are a gnome...well steamfont is your newbie zone so you should already be there. The kobold camp has 3 kobolds that spawn at the camp and one off the side of the camp on the mountainside. To take the 3 kobolds you will need to give your pet a rusty scythe, two-handed sword, or halberd. They aren't that hard to find. Go to greater faydark and ask around for some. Or go to Felwithe, the starting city of the high elves. You will be able to find some rusty two-handers at many vendors. Kobolds will get you to level 6. Once you get to level 6 I suggest going to Butcher Block and killing dwarven skeletons at the druid ring. They are levels 5-7 and are VERY good exp. If your pet has a two hander you will do very well. The dwarven skeletons will get you to level 8. If you didn't start as a High Elf or Gnome (not recommended if you are first starting everquest), then just find stuff around your newbie zone. At levels 4-8 its not like there is a lack of things kill. IMO find a skeleton camp if you didn't start as a High Elf or gnome. They are in almost every newbie zone and will get you to level 8. <br><br>Some people when they first start out don't know how to control their pets. Here are most of the commands you will need to use to control your pet. <br><br>/pet attack - send your pet after whatever you want. <br>/pet back off - makes your pet back off the thing you are fighting. Has to be hit multiple times to work, and if your enemy attacks you, your pet will go in again. <br>/pet report health - this command makes your pet tell you how much health it has left. VERY useful command. Use it a lot in battle. Make sure your pet doesn't die. <br>/pet guard here - makes your pet stay where they are and come assist you if anything attacks you. They will return to the spot they left after killing whatever attacked you. <br>/pet get lost - if you get a lower level pet and you aren't satisfied, use this command to get rid of the pet and summon a more powerful one. <br><br>Some other things about pets. Once you get to level 8 MAKE SURE that you outdamage your pet with you DD spells. If you don't outdamage your pet then your pet will get half of the exp. from whatever you killed. From level 4-7 its fine if your pet outdamages you, and since you should be giving your lower level pets rusty two-handed weapons to make them do A LOT more damage, you probably won't be able to outdamage your pet. However once you get to level 8 make sure you take a little over half of your enemy's HP off with your own DD's so you get full exp. for the kill. <br><br>Level 8 is when magicians start to become REALLY good. At this level they get two great DD's, a damage shield, invisibility, a pet healing spell, a bunch of summoning spells, and of course your pets. The problem is that at this level spells suddenly cost a LOT for their level and you will have A LOT of spells to buy. If you have another higher level character this is no problem, but new characters will have to conserve their money. If you are low on money I suggest buying these spell first and the rest later: level 8 earth pet, Shock of Blades, Shield of Fire, Invisibility, and Staff of Tracing. These are the only spells you will need for now. The summon staff spell can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. Now to make a ton of money you are going to hunt wisps. Wisps can only be hit by magical means( ie spells or a magical weapon), so it is very important to buy your level 8 summon staff spell, because it will make your pets able to hit the wisps. <br><br>The best place to hunt wisps is on the wisp island located between Odus and Qeynos. To get to it, ride the boat from Qeynos to Odus and get off at the island the boat stops at in the middle of the ride. Be sure you brought a lot of backpacks/small containers. The strategy to kill these things will be summon an earth pet and give it a staff you summoned. Then buff the earth pet with your fire damage shield. Then send it in on the wisp and stand back and keep burning the wisp until it is dead. Tank for your pet and cast your shock of swords spell in-between the attacks of the wisp if needed. Make sure the wisp you attack is alone and there are no other ones near. Wisps WILL assist each other and at this level 2 wisps means death. Also, you will want to use your level 1 "summon dagger" spell against the wisps because it will summon a magical weapon, and if you are just starting out and don't have a higher level character, you probably won't have access to a magical weapon. Now when you loot the wisps destroy the burnt out lightstone and regular lightstone they drop. However save the Greater Light Stones. You will get one greater lightstone for about every 5 wisps you kill. When all of your backpacks and containers are totally full with Greater light stones, take them to the gypsy camp in North Karana if you are good aligned, or South Ro if you are evil, and give them to one of the ladies (I forget which lady it is exactly...just ask someone. If no one knows then just hail them all. The one you want is the one that talks about the Concordance of research.). For every greater light stone you give her you will get a good deal of exp. for this level and about 9pp. Very soon you will have enough money to buy the rest of your spells. Here are all the other level 8 spells you will want to buy: <br><br>Renew Elements - this spell will heal your pets. It is good spell during downtime if they aren't fully healed by the time your mana is full. You won't need it with your level 8 pets, but your level 12 pets that have more hp and regen slower (because of your pet buff burnout) might need to be healed sometimes. This spell is based off your Alteration magic group. This is the first alteration spell you will get. It will fizzle a lot, so practice it up. <br><br>Dimensional Pocket - this spell summons a 4-slot weightless container that makes anything you put into it weightless. Very useful, however USE WITH CAUNTION. The pocket, and everything you put in it, will disappear if you log off. Is good at higher levels when MOBS are dropped a lot of weapons that are too heavy to carry. Just summon a pocket and put them in it until you can go sell them. This spell can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Eye of Zoom - this isn't as useful a spell as it is fun. It will summon an eye than you can move around and see with. You can't have a pet out to cast this spell. Its fun to scout out an area with or scare lower level people, but it isn't really that useful. It also has a pretty short duration. <br><br>Lesser Shielding - this is an upgrade to your level 1 minor shielding spell. Always keep yourself buffed with it. <br><br>Flame Bolt - this is the other DD (direct damage) spell you get at level 8. It has a MUCH farther range than shock of swords and does more damage per hit. The downsides to it are that it takes more mana, has a slightly longer casting time, requires you to have a clear line of sight with your enemy, and will get resisted a lot by things with high fire resists. Its good for pulling things because you will be able to get 3 of them off before the monster can reach you, but generally you will want to use Shock of Swords. <br><br>If you ever suddenly feel like not making tons of money and get bored of wisps (unlikely), their are some other good spots to hunt. The first is the single siren spawn in OOT (ocean of tears). Take the boat from FP to BB. Eventually you will come to two large rocks jutting out of the water. Jump off the boat and swim to the left one. On the opposite side of the rock where you swam to is a level 12 siren. You can take her at level 8. Before you go get a bind at the docks in FP. The exp. is great, but its not quite as good as wisps, and the loot is nowhere near as good. In addition to the single spawn siren is the entire zone of steamfont. This zone has TONS of level 7-11 things...minotaurs, skeletons, pumas, plague rats, earth elementals, and even harpies! At level 8 you will be able to take all the 11 things if your pet has a weapon. I highly suggest using an earth pet if you come here. A good place to pull things is near the entrance of the minotaur cave on the wall. Ask for directions to the cave. The real danger here is the level 35 minotaur hero that will sometimes spawn and come near the mino cave. If you stay on the wall you will usually be fine. The last place to hunt from level 8-12 is in the east commons. Here you will see darkweed snakes practically carpeting the ground. Use a water pet to kill them because they have a VERY nasty poison attack, and the water pet will totally negate the effects of it. You will be able to take them fairly easy even if you don't give your water pet a rusty two-hander. With a rusty two-hander you will beat them into oblivion. <br><br>Now you will be able to get to level 12 quickly by killing wisps and turning in Greater Light Stones (or if you already had plenty of money so you went to one of my other suggested places). You will also make a ton of money (if you hunted wisps). I highly suggest buying a Stein of Mogguk with all your new money. It gives +10 to your intelligence, which gives you more mana. Also, I would buy some other +int necklaces, earrings, and rings. A new robe would be good too (do you wanna wear your newbie robe forever??) Here are the level 12 spells you will want to buy: <br><br>Burnout - This spell will make your pets regen their hp slower, but it will also make them attack better. A good pet buff spell. Always keep it on your pet. <br><br>Bind Affinity - AWESOME SPELL. This will allow you to bind yourself anywhere so that when you die, that&#8217;s where you will appear. Before you got this spell you had to have other people bind you, and you can only be bound in cities when other people cast it. <br><br>Cancel Magic - this has several uses. First off it can be used to remove any buffs your enemy has on themselves. Secondly, it can be used to remove most (but not all) DoT&#8217;s (or damage over time spells) that were cast on you by the enemy. <br><br>Ward Summoned - This is a good spell to use in lavastorm. The only problem is that there are way better places to hunt than lavastorm. Against elementals it is VERY good. It does the damage of fire bolt, and has the low resist, quick casting time, and lower mana that Shock of Steel has. However, it can only be used against summoned things. The only time you will use it is when dueling other people that have pets. <br><br>Summon Fang - This spell summons a 5/26 weapon that will hit magical creatures (hehe wisps!). If you still don't have a magical weapon at this level use this instead of your level 1 summon dagger spell to hit wisps with. You can fight wisps up to level 16, so it will still be useful. It can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Elemental Earth - Your earth pet will be the only pet you need to buy. It has massive hp and casts a root spell to keep the enemy away from you. Buffed with burnout and with its massive hp, you might get to full mana before it gets to full health. If that happens use your renew elements spell. <br><br>You also get two area effect spells at this level. The first type are rain spells. These are very good against 1-3 enemies. Against a single enemy a rain spell will hit 3 times. Against 2-3 enemies your rain will hit twice. Against 4 enemies you rain will hit once. Against more than 4 enemies your rain will only hit 4 of the enemies. The second type of AoE spells hits all enemies once. These AoE's are good against 4 or more enemies. <br><br>At level 12 there are a lot of things open to you. You can kill wisps all the way until level 16. At level 12 your pets will be to hit magical things without wielding magical weapons. Since your level 12 pets will only do 16 damage per hit (and that&#8217;s the maximum level pet), you should be giving them rusty-two handed weapons. If you can't get any two-handed weapons then just give your pet any weapon. If your pet has a weapon they will do a little more damage than normal even if the weapon doesn't make them hit for a higher maximum damage. Verant says it won&#8217;t do anything, but I don&#8217;t care. At least just give your pet a summoned weapon so they look pretty. Now if you don't want to kill wisps there are a ton of other things to do. <br><br>In Lake Rathe there is a level 15 monk called the hermit. He stands in this hut in the corner of the zone, and respawns every 5 minutes after being killed. He can get you to level 16 if you don't want to do wisps, or want to mix things up. Summon an earth pet, buff with damage shield and burnout, and then send your pet in and stand back and blast with Shock of Swords until he dies. If you don&#8217;t want to use an earth pet, try a fire pet. Since this guy is a monk, he does a lot of attacks per round, you&#8217;re your fire pet&#8217;s damage shield will help very much. Tank for pet if needed, however don't do it too much. At level 12 he will kill you quickly. Remember, make sure to outdamage your pet. He is very good exp. and will get you to level 16 pretty quick. The loot isn't nearly as good as wisps though. <br><br>Another place to hunt is in OOT (the ocean of tears), which is located between the continents of Antonica and Feydwer. You will be hunting sirens in this zone. Go to the docks in Freeport and bind yourself there. If you take the ship from Freeport to butcher block you will eventually come to two large rocks coming out of the water. Jump off the boat and swim to the rock on the right. Here you will see two level 12 sirens. Buff your water pet with burnout and your damage shield and send it in. If you bought your area effect spells this would be the time to use them (the rain based AoE works best). The sirens hit fairly hard but have low hp. After you kill the two sirens they will start spawning one at a time. Quickly kill them using your rain AoE, and make sure you spread out their spawns. That way you won't have to fight 2 at a time anymore. This spot is AMAZING exp., however like the hermit; it is not nearly as good loot as wisps. Also, be sure to give your pet a rusty two-handed sword before you engage the sirens. The best spot to buy rusty weapons is on the boat from Freeport to butcher block. At the first stop you will arrive at sister island. Get off and go in the shop. They sell rusty halberds here. When giving to your pet, they will make your pet do 20 damage a hit. Also, it is highly suggested to use a water pet here, since you will have to kill 2 things every 5 minutes it is a better choice than the earth pet that might not be able to keep up with the quick spawns. <br><br>Soon you will be level 16. All of these methods will level you fast (although I still think wisps are the best method because they give so much money). Once you get to level 16 the best place to hunt is in lake rathe, which is where the hermit was located if you went to fight him from 12-16. Before I talk about lake rathe I will tell you your new spells for level 16: <br><br>Shock of Flame - a new DD spell! At level 12 you didn't get a real DD, except for ward summoned which you probably didn't use. Sure, you got the rain spell, which can hit 3 times against a single enemy; making it mana efficient and doing good damage, but you didn&#8217;t get a real DD spell. For 70 mana this spell will start off doing 90-some damage. <br><br>See Invisible - this spell will allow you to see invisible players and pets. Since your air pet casts invisibility on itself a lot, its good to use this spell when using an air pet. <br><br>Summon Throwing Daggers - this spell will summon a bunch of throwing dagger that can be given to someone that uses throwing weapons (monks, rogues, and bards in general). This spell can only be bought in the dark elf, gnome, and erudite cities. <br><br>Heatstone - this spell will summon an item that will grant the user infravision. Is good to give to night-blind races or to use yourself if you started as an Erudite or human (Although if you are a beginner you probably did what I said and started as a gnome or high elf, which means you all ready have infravision). <br><br>Staff of Warding - summons an 8/38 staff with a couple charges of glimpse (which always you to see farther). It really doesn't have much use except to play around with the glimpse spell it comes with (or you can give it to a low level newbie...is a good weapon for a newbie). This spell can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Level 16 pets - At this level I would suggest buying all the pets. Also at this level you can not buy all the pets in your guild. The level 16 and 20 pets must be bought in OOT (the ocean of tears). The island next to Sister Island where the AC spawns is where you will find the vendor. <br><br>Shielding - An upgrade to your lesser shielding spell. keep it on at all times. The extra hp and ac can save your life if you need to tank and it&#8217;s a close battle. <br><br>Phantom Leather - this spell boots your AC and also lets your regen your HP a little faster. It is good for if you are going into a tough battle where you will probably have to tank. It takes a cat&#8217;s eye agate component to cast. <br><br>At level 16 you get the ability to start researching. Go to your guild and put one point into your researching skill and it will be maxed until level 20(there is a bug where after putting a point in at your guild it raises your skill higher then its supposed to). Of all the pure casters, magicians have it the hardest when it comes to researching. They have to combine old spells, a word, and an item to make scrolls they can use. I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about researching because it would take a LONG time to explain. So go to castersrealm.com and look at the magician research stuff. Hehe if you are a newbie first starting out, feel lucky. When I first started the game researching was nearly impossible. Since then, however, they have made it easier (although it is still fairly hard). <br><br>Okay Now back to the hunting guide. At level 16 venture to Lake rathe. Here you will find a bunch of aviak guards that are level 16-20. For their level, they aren't that hard. At level 16 you will be able to take level 20 aviaks. This is also the level when you should start grouping. Almost all the aviaks in this zone are close together, and will attack you at the same time. The only time you will want to solo when hunting them is if you are at the single aviak spawn, or at the entrance to the arena zone where you can take the two aviaks one at a time. However this isn't always possible, as they are sometimes camped, so you will have to group with another person (or two other people if you want to take the 3-spawn aviaks). Aviaks are pretty good loot dropping up to 3pp and FS (fine steel) weapons which will sell for about 5pp each at the ogre vendors in the zone (don't worry even though they are ogres they sell to everyone). The aviak guards also drop words which you can use to research some of your level 16 spells (if you didn't buy them already). <br><br>Another good spot for level 16 is the zone Lake of ill Omen, located in Kunark near west Cabilis. There are a bunch of things here that will con blue to yellow for you to kill. It is a bit more dangerous here than in Lake Rathe though. <br><br>Fighting aviak guards or creatures in the Lake of Ill Omen will get you to level 20 pretty quickly. Some people will tell you that Oasis is a good zone for this level, but I totally disagree with that. It is severely overcrowded; the loot sucks, and there are specter and sand giant trains all the time. When you get to level 20 its time for new spells! Here is the list of spells: <br><br>Bolt of Flame - this spell does MASSIVE damage and has a VERY long range too! But be careful, it has a huge taunt rate so you will usually want to use an earth or air pet when soloing because of their root/stun spells. Also you have to have a clear line of sight for it too work. <br><br>Elemental Shield - a fairly useful buff for things that cast spells. Raises your cold and fire resistances. <br><br>Spear of Warding - summons a magical spear that has a small fire and cold resist+ tacked on to it. Not all that useful. Give it to a newbie or a rogue without a magic piercing weapon. It can also be given to pet. It can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Renew Summoning - this is a very nice upgrade to your level 8 pet-only healing spell. Use it when your pet is low in HP or if your mana is full and your pet's hp isn't full. <br><br>Summon Arrows - this spell summons a bunch of magical arrows. Give them to people that use bows and don't want to spend money making or buying arrows. Fairly useful. Can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Summon Waterstone - this summons a stone with a charge of enduring breath, which makes you able to breathe under-water. Great for when you want to go to kedge keep at higher levels, or just to keep in your inventory incase you for some reason get caught under-water. It can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Shield of Flame - an upgrade to your level 8 damage shield. Definitely use it to buff your pet before you attack something or in a group on the tanks. <br><br>Rain of Fire - an area effect spell. This is useful when your group wants to take multiple mobs and there is no enchanter around to mezz the extras. Be careful though, it will get the monsters mad at you. It is also very good for soloing, because it will hit single mobs 3 times, making it very mana efficient. <br><br>Level 20 pets - I suggest that you buy all of the pets at this level. You can't buy them all at your guild. You have to go to the merchant in OOT on one of the islands to get the rest that aren't sold at your guild. <br><br>Now the level 20 fighting place - SOUTH KARANA!!!! This zone has TONS of stuff in it. At level 20 there are many things you can do. First off is the aviak city. The aviaks here anywhere from about levels 15-30. Get a group and kill rooks that spawn on the bottom, or go up to the penthouse. Splitpaw - right outside the dungeon of split paw there are three spires and a hill. Level 24-29 gnolls spawn here. If you are able to get in a group the exp. is pretty decent. Treants, these things are pretty good exp. and VERY good loot. They are heavily camped though, so you might have to wait to get in a group. Also treants drop your faction with druids and with Qeynos, so don't kill them if you don't want to be KOS at the druid rings or in Qeynos. Centaurs, these guys can be good exp. and drop some nice items too. The best place to hunt them is near the centaur outpost. Many will wander by the outpost. You will be able to solo any that don't con red. If you get in a group with someone that can track it is even better because sometimes the pickings get slim and having someone who can easily find more make for good exp. Also, there are a couple merchants in one of the stables at the centaur outpost. Sell there. There are also shadowed men that are in the low 20&#8217;s that you can kill. They make good target&#8217;s for your damage spells against summoned things, but you need a group, and the loot sucks very badly. <br><br>The last thing this wonderful zone offers....the hermit. In the middle of nowhere is a level 20 ranger. He is VERY good exp. Why? because he has a 3 MINUTE SPAWN. Not only that but the loot he drops isn't bad. PLUS, sometimes he drops FS two-handed weapons which you can give to your pet to make them do 24 damage a hit. The only problem is that he sits in a hut with a door that won't open. To pull him out go near the chimney of the house, have no one targeted, and say 'kill you'. After doing that a few times he will attack you through the wall and your pet will go after him. You won't be able to use your level 20 bolt spell the first time you attack him because it won't go through the wall. use your level 16 DD that will still hit him. I HIGHLY suggest that you use a water or air pet to camp him. Why? Because since he respawns every 3 minutes, your earth pet will never be able to regen in time, only your water or air pet will be able to keep up(well the fire pet could keep up too, but you don't want to use him here, dies way too fast). After you kill him the first time you won't need to say 'kill you' anymore. As soon as he spawns again just target your pet and type /assist. Then the hermit will automatically be targeted and you can pull him out of the house using your level 16 DD, and then once he teleports out of the house you can use your level 20 DD. However, if you are using a water pet and not an air pet, try to keep him in the house, pull him with your level 16 DD and then send your pet in, and then burn with caution so he stays on your water pet and doesn&#8217;t teleport out to attack you. If you are using an air pet it is fine to pull him out because the air pet will stun him and let you DD. <br><br>With everything it has to offer South Karana will be able to get you to level 30. You can easily get from level 20 to 27 just soloing the hermit. If the hermit is camped by someone else you can always do centaurs, gnolls outside of splitpaw, and aviaks. Plus once you get to level 24 you can go INSIDE spiltpaw with a group for decent exp. If you don't mind losing faction with the druids and Qeynos you can also kill treants which are a VERY good money source. Even better than the treants is the druid ring in east Karana(actually not that far away). Here there will be 3 druids (and sometimes you will get a few treants) that respawn every 3 minutes. It is WAYYYY better than the south Karana treants, but you need more people to hold it down, and its more dangerous. However, if you can get 4 casters(including you), in their mid to high 20's together, you will get AMAZING EXP. and INSANE LOOT. Of course you have to be willing to becoming KoS in Qeynos and at some of the druid rings. <br><br>Another good spot for levels 24 to 30 is the dungeon Solesk A. Get a map of the place and head to the 'frenzied' room. This spot is very nice solo exp. and loot, and there is a zone nearby if you mess up. Expect to die a couple of times though, becuase well, its a dungeon. Even if you die a few times, its still worth it. <br><br>A good spot in Kunark for level 24-30 is the forest giant mini-village located in the center of Warslick&#8217;s Woods. They are pretty good exp. And the loot is decent too. If you get really lucky they will drop a forest loop, which is worth a lot of money. This spot is a bit dangerous though, and don&#8217;t expect to get a forest loop soon. Be happy if you get a single one after 10 hours of fighting. <br><br>Once you get to level 29/30 you have a lot of options. Level 30 is the first 'hell' level so leveling to level 31 will take you a while. Also on the level 24 and 29 spells....buy ALL of them. Once you get to these levels simply buy ALL of your spells. You will be grouping more and more, and you never know when you might need a spell that would seem worthless to you if you were soloing. Also, most of the level 24 and 29 pet spells can't be bought and MUST be researched. You should be able to do all right without researching extra pets, but you should always try to get all of your pets. You should also have enough money by this level so that buying all of your spells won&#8217;t bankrupt you. Also, when you get to level 29 ALWAYS give your pet two weapons that you are able to summon once you get to level 29. Some very good weapons to give your pets are gnoll hide lariats. They drop off of splitpaw gnolls and are cheap to buy. The sweet thing about them is that when your pet uses them, they will start proccing stun. <br><br><br>At level 29/30 a great zone to go to is OOT. Take the boat from Freeport to BB and get off at the first stop. On this island you will find two level 25 sisters that are near the docks and 3 dwarfs, 2 of which are level 24, and one of which is level 25. These guys are extremely good exp. Until level 34/35. Hunting the dwarf couple that spawn by the rock on one of the corners of the island will get you to level 34. The two sisters by the dock(one on the dock, one next to a tree by the dock) will get you to level 35. The dwarfs will drop your faction with dawrven NPC&#8217;s in BB, but not the guards. Killing the sisters will make you KOS in all of Faydark, but going to crushbone will give you back the faction you lost, if you care about it. <br><br>At level 34 a great Kunark zone is OT (Overthere). Here you will be able to fight tigers, sarnacks, rhino&#8217;s, and many other things. You can manage soloing here, but getting a group would be better. There are always lots of groups that are fighting here by the FM and SF zones, and in-between these zones on the wall. The loot isn&#8217;t too great, but this zone can take you to level 44. You CAN get higher than 44 here, but the exp. Slows down around 44. <br><br>Also at level 34 you can also start killing Cyclops&#8217;s, Hill Giants, Sand Giants, Specters, and Griffins that don't con red(if they con yellow you still might not want to do it). They are all pretty good exp. and loot(especially the giants). The only thing is they give you a LOT o Also at level 34 you can start taking city guards. They are level 30-35 in most places, with the best spot to hunt them being butcher block(the NPC&#8217;s, not the guards however) and steamfont(gnome guards)and rathe mountains(troll guards). All these things can level you from level 34 to 45 or 46(except the cyc&#8217;s). Overall though, a great spot for fighting these types of MOBS is Rathe mountains. This place has tons of Cyclopes&#8217; and hill giants. There is also a wizard girl in this zone that you can camp, and two troll guards that are level 35. At levels 34-38 you will only be able to take one of the guards at a time. At 39-43 you will be able to take both of them, but you won&#8217;t be able to totally keep up with both of the spawns. At levels 44/45 you will be able to take both troll guards and keep the spawns under control. The trolls guards and Cynthia are pretty heavily camped though, so don&#8217;t expect to just be able to go there and camp them. The good thing is that if they are camped there are always plenty of hill giants to kill which are good exp. And great loot. <br><br>Once you get to the 40&#8217;s the Dreadlands in Kunark is a very good spot to solo or group. Grouping is better here however, as in most Kunark zones, because lots of monsters wander around. This is a great zone and can easily take you into your low 50&#8217;s. <br><br>Now something else you will be doing a lot at this level is grouping. Starting at level 24 you should start grouping. All the soloing strategies I listed above are not the only ways to go. Grouping in Upper guk, Lower guk, Solusek A and B, Splitpaw, Mistmoore, Unrest, Karnor&#8217;s Castle, Kurn&#8217;s Keep, City of Mist, and other dungeons can work very well sometimes. Plus, once you get to about level 46 you will want to group A LOT. As a magician your role in the group will be to dish out a lot of damage via your pets, DD spells, and damage shields. Your malise spells will also be a plus if there is no shaman or enchanter around. You should start grouping as early as possibly to learn how to fight well in a group. As I said, once to get to your mid-40's, grouping will become essential. It becomes a lot harder to solo. However if you do want to solo from the mid-40's to 50, Seafury Cyclops's in OOT and high level giants(ice giants in everfrost) would be your best bet. However I wouldn't suggest that too highly considering that the exp. won't be as good as getting in a good group. Plus, before level 49 they are hard to kill, and will take a full bar of mana. <br><br>It would be too hard for me to write a guide for every single dungeon, so I am just going to give you an overview. I hgighly suggest grouping in dungeons now. Verant recently not only incresed the exp. for large groups, but also increased the exp. MANY dungeons give. Plus grouping is a lot of fun and soloing outdoors can get boring. <br><br>Lower Guk I a great spot at level 34+. There is a room in this zone called the &#8216;bedroom&#8217;, and it is a great spot to set up a group and pull from. It is very good exp., but be weary of trains. This dungeon is definitely a death box, and you will find that surviving in a dungeon as a magician is a much harder feat to do than other classes. In addition to the &#8216;bedroom&#8217; there are lots of other great things to do here. There is some MEGA loot to get, especially a Robe called the Shiny Metallic Robe, which is a rare drop off the ghoul magi dude. There is also a plethora of great fighter equipment here that you can sell or give to one of your twink. Just of few things are the FBSS(a sash that gives haste); the exo axe, a nice two handed slashing weapon for a warrior; short swords of the ykkshea(the spelling is way off on that one, don&#8217;t know exact spell), which are one handed slashing weapons that proc a 75 pt DD, and many other great things. <br><br>Another dungeon I have experience in is Splitpaw. This is not as good of a dungeon as many others, but it is still a decent spot to group in and get exp. starting at level 24 and continuing up into the high 30&#8217;s. The only problem is that there usually aren&#8217;t enough people around to start groups in the higher level parts of this zone. As for magician loot the best drop is this zone is the gnoll hide tome with gives +10 int and a few other stats, but drops your strength(although your str. dropping isn&#8217;t that big of a deal). <br><br>At level 16 and up until the high 30&#8217;s one of the decent dungeons on the continent of Feydwer that you can go to is Unrest. Personally, I didn&#8217;t like it much because there were WAY too many trains, and it was even more of a deathbox than Lower Guk. However, you can do pretty well soloing lawn trash from 16-20, and this can be a great place to go if you get a good group. The only thing is good groups just don&#8217;t spawn every 3 minutes. &#61514;. If you can get a nice group though, you&#8217;ll have fun. There is a ton of FS weapons here that you can store in your summoned bags to sell for a lot of money. <br><br>One of my newly favoirte dungeons is Mistmoore. From level 24 until the mid 40&#8217;s, you can do great here. At level 24 to 30 you can make good exp. soloing the familiars near the entrance. The only downside is that you will be making hardly any money doing this. One of the best spots in this dungeon is the gravyard. Here you can get a small group and take the whole thing. There are 5 level 24-30 things that spawn every 15 minutes here. At level 34 you can even solo the whole thing by yourself, with some difficulty. If you do want to solo it, make sure you use an earth pet. Root is essential. The best drop in the graveyard for magicians is the sacrafical dagger. It is a 5/21 weapon that gives +5 to int. It is a common drop off of one of the rare spawns in the graveyard. This is actually a pretty small dungeon. However it is a great spot. Of course all of the dungeons on Feydwer are small. Except Kedge Keep&#8230;&#8230; <br><br>Ah yes, Kedge Keep. This zone is completely underwater and can be quite difficult to get used to. You will defiantely want the spell that summons you a waterstone here. I have only went here a few times, but there are some things I know aobut it. First of all, don&#8217;t go here if you want exp. You definitely can NOT solo here and there is almost always no one here. However, there are many great drops in this zone, so it is a great zone to raid. The best drop in this zone for the magician is the Staff of Elemenal Mastry Water. It is dropped off of the &#8216;boss&#8217; of the zone, Phingel Autotrops. When held your water pets will become much more power, even more so then when using the regular water focus item. I will talk about focus items in a little bit. <br><br><br>Nagafen&#8217;s Lair, or Solusek B as it is called, is a very good spot once you get to level 44. I definitely wouldn&#8217;t suggest going before 44 though, because if you do you will have to use your level 24 shock DD against all of the things in here. They have extremely high fire resists. There is more good fighter equipment drops in here than caster, but it is still a great spot for picking up exp. and money once you get to 44. Plus this is the only zone I know of that drops fire giants toes, which you need for your fire focus item. The only thing is that you need to get a good group that is fairly high level, since they are mildly hard. <br><br>Ah yes, focus items. Focus items are weapons that you hold. While holding them, your pets will be more powerful when you summon them. There are 4 different focus items, and each one is used when summon each kind of different pet. There is the shovel of ponz, torch of alna, broom of trilion, and stein of ullissa. Some of the spellings might be off a little bit. If you want to find out how to get these things, just check Allakhazam&#8217;s quest database. It would take me too long to go through everything you have to do. It would also be stupid since they are listed on this very site. Focus items work for all levels of pets, and when used on level 34 or high pets they will make your pets look a little bigger. Also, the fire focus item is the hardest to get. Took me a while to get fire giants toes for the quest. <br><br>There are also Staff&#8217;s of Elemental Mastery. These work just like focus items, but work even better. The water one is dropped off of the boss in Kedge Keep, the earth one is dropped off of Innoruk, and the air one is received from a quest in the plane of air. I have to idea where the fire one is dropped, and I am not even sure if it is in the game(yet). The water staff is the easiest to get and the earth is the hardest. <br><br>Also people, please try to HAVE FUN. Please don't do nothing but solo and/or kill stuff. Try adventuring(WITHOUT A MAP FROM THE INTERNET), roleplaying, and dueling. They add a lot to the game.<br><br>I think that about wraps it up. I have Velious now, but since my characters got deleted and my biggest character is a level 14 enchanter, I don't think I will be writing about it any time soon. <br><br>Corpusnuntia/Divineshadow/Natalos/Naltec/Plantmaster/Zuranthium/Sunsong <br><br>Player of many characters across too many servers. <br><br>P.S. &#8211; When pasted into Word Perfect this has 7,985 words. Phew&#8230;glad I am done. <br><br>Email me at tim_gerber@yahoo.com if you have any questions. <br><br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

Just the first room You will find plenty of Lancers to pull. Just use your lvl 1 spell to pull them to zone. With the fire pet you can clean up in here. Just summon a lot of waterstones and if you need to go afk for even a couple seconds use one before afk. Your stamina will bottom out but not a big deal. Your swimming will max fast. And as stated not many people come here except for raids on Phinny who btw drops the Staff of Elemental Mastery Water.&nbsp;&nbsp;So not apt to see 1 train. Only thing that got me was when a group came in to do a raid they would clean house on the first room before moving on. Which they need to do but stops your exp for a few mins.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Not a bad guide, but it leaves a few holes. In such a huge game environment, there really is no "one best" way or place to fight.<br><br>Toxxulia Forrest: It's really not such a bad newbie area, once you get used to it. It's certainly no worse than Nektolous Forrest or the Feerrot. One of your first purchases should be True North; this level 1 spell will point you towards the Erudin city entrance, and it's great for finding home again. At level 4, get Sense Summoned. There are three summoned NPC pets in the zone. Jalen Goldsinger's pet is right outside a caster supply hut where you can buy malachite and sell your goods at much better prices than any other merchant save your guild merchants. If you get one of the other two pets (Elial Brook's or Gnarthene Skurl), cast true north and run for your life. You don't want to mess with them.<br><br>You can partner up to take on the kobald camps for a level or two, then you can solo the camps and take on any skeletons that wander past. Your pet can solo the skunks, which occasionally drop a scent gland which sells for over 1 gp. The kobalds themselves drop hides, gems, boxes, bags, and booze. You'll have enough money to get your pet and a couple of auxilliary spells when you get to level 8.<br><br>At level 8, go pay Elial Brook a visit. You can easily solo him at this level with your improved pet, and he gives excellent faction; you can further improve faction by turning in his bones to Markus in the magician guild.<br><br>Once you've gotten your faction up to "warmly" with your guild, you can venture to The Warrens for some team dungeon fighting, or head to Erud's Crossing for good experience and loot at the same time.<br><br>Erud's Crossing: It's not just about the wisps. In fact, you'll get more consistant money and decent experience taking out the various kerran snakes and vampire bats you find. The snakes drop giant snake fangs and venom sacs, which sell for upwards of 3gp apiece, and tons of snake scales. The scales are near worthless as sellable loot, but you can give them or sell them to shamans (maybe in exchange for a buff or two), or you can use them to gain caster faction in Qeynos if you didn't start out there.<br><br>Vampire bats are usually a pretty easy fight, and they drop upwards of 3 wings/furs per bat (I've seen as many as five of each). They also drop jars of saliva, which sell for a decent price. The only ones to really watch for are the bats with skeleton pets; they will cast some nasty necromancer spells, and they are usually 3-5 levels higher than the other bats on the island.<br><br>You can handle most of the fire elementals that spawn on the island; these are lower level elementals than the ones at Lavastorm.<br><br>The occasionaly Island Madman will be excellent experience. You can solo them when they con yellow, although you should be careful because they are casters and they don't always stay focused on your pet.<br><br>Stay away from the spiders unless you have a death wish. They are very social and the island is small enough that you can attract the attention of a half dozen spiders very easily. Save the spiders for when you are level 16 or so and return to buy some new spells and get some guild training; you can handle multiple spiders at that point, and you can save up silk swatches for tailoring.<br><br>The wisps are good experience in their own right. Don't destroy the regular lightstones; they sell for about 8gp apiece. You can also take a money loss and turn them in along with greater lightstones for a little more experience. The burned-out lightstones are needed for practice research, but they are NO RENT so there is no need to keep them unless you are in your upper 20s.<br><br>In short, this island is about a lot more than just wisps. Most of the common mobs are good experience and excellent loot for their level. I fought from 8-12 in Erud's Crossing and had enough money for every single level 12 spell, with ALL of my greater-lightstone loot left over for future uses.<br><br>Lavastorm Mountains: I'm not sure why you disdain Lavastorm; it was built for magicians and druids. The loot is outstanding, and the experience is plentiful. Few mobs will aggro on you unless you start attacking, so it's a relatively safe place to fight. Summon up a couple of dimensional pockets to store those bricks of ore, and sell them in the zone so you don't have to carry them around. You don't have to return to a city until you run out of spell components or your small change starts weighing you down; Invisibility and a little caution will get you through Nek Forrest with little risk, and from there it's a short jaunt to Freeport. You can even buff up your shady Freeport faction in your early levels by doing the Slonsin quest in Erudin (if you started there). That quest raises lots of factions and lowers none.<br><br>Besides, Lavastorm is just such an awesome looking and sounding zone. Not to mention the higher levels who hang out at the various dungeon zones and who will often give you some really nice buffs for free. (You don't even have to ask; however, giving a few common drop bloodstones to a cleric will usually result in a good symbol spell for you).<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>While I agree with the majority of the post, I believe the 8 to 20 should be changed. From lvl 8 to 12 you can solo the thugs, smugglers in the Qeynos sewers. This zone gives a 20% bonus to XP. You should be able to solo the thugs at 8. These are on a 5 min spawn so you have time to med to full then nuke. At 12 you should be able to handle 2 of the Smuggler spawns. Loot is decent with the ocassional Bronze drop. At 12 to 16 Hunt bandits in the WK. The 2 spawn bandits on the road is great for soloing. These drop bronze weapons and the red sash. Fill up you summoned bags with bronze weapons and sashes. Gate back to (Qeynos you did bind there ?) Sell the bronze and turn int the sashes to the pally next to the shield salesman. He gives xp and some gold and Bronze weapons. A 2 hour camp of the spawn netted me a level and 60pp. I turned in 14 sashes. Farmers at the barn with the bandits always drop sashes and are green to a lvl 12. This is better than Wisps because it cuts down all the travel time on the boat and the long run back and forth to turn in the GLstones.<br><br>16 to 20 ORCS<br>Since you just had to go to the OOT to get your pet spells, stop in the oasis to lvl to 18. Good loot dropped and the orc highway there means little down time. 18 to 20 run to HHP and hunt the orc spawn there. This spawn is also very fast and the orcs drop bronze weapons and ringmail armor. The orc spawn is also right next to the zone line for quick evac and a bank is in the next zone HHK.<br>&nbsp;<br>Shoikan Shonuff<br>Rise of the Fallen<br>51 Dark Elf Reaver<br>Rodcent Nife</td></tr>

Keep a stack of gnoll fangs.  As soon as you level up, go to South Qeynos and turn in the gnoll fangs, and then the moonstones.  You should now have an experience buffer for fighting in Blackburrow.<br>Hope it helps.<br>&nbsp;<br>Druid Bolooen Naturewolf :-)<br>Morrell-Thule<br></td></tr>
