<p><b>The enchanter can be soloed, with a little patiece and care, but
is more useful in a group.&nbsp; It has the weakness of a spell caster
without the attack powers many of the other classes have.&nbsp; However,
Enchanters are very valuable group members.&nbsp; At higher levels, enchanters
are considered invaluable and are probably second only to clerics in popularity
when forming a group.&nbsp; They are sort of an all around magic class,
with a little of every type of spell.&nbsp; They can buff you up to make
you worth about another level and then buff down the monsters to make them
easier to attack.&nbsp; They have some limited attack spells, and have
spells such as root and lull which can make life easier for the whole party
in battle.&nbsp; With an enchanter in the party, the group can take on
much higher level monsters and get a correspondingly higher experience
and gold return.&nbsp; An enchanter's main work includes buffing the party
and lulling unwanted combatants before the battle, and debuffing and playing
traffic cop during the battle via the wide arsenal of stun spells and charm.&nbsp;
Properly played, an enchanter can keep a group of mobs off balance while
the party picks off one at a time.&nbsp; Basically, the enchanter keeps
the party alive by keeping the extra Mobs off the group.&nbsp; In addition,
they receive a number of illusions and environmental spells, allowing the
enchanter to travel anywhere he wants and sell too just about anyone at
a good price.&nbsp; Because of this, faction is less crucial to enchanters
than other classes.&nbsp; Enchanter are also the only class that realistically
can use the jewelry making skill to make magical items.&nbsp;&nbsp; If
you like to group, and don't mind being the one giving support to the others,
this is a good class to play.</b><b></b>
