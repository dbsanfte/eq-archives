There was all the usual BS that goes along with that:  Putting together groups in which half the members would disband for some lame reason ("Need to feed the chinchilla, sorry!")  Clerics were trying to melee, casters were oblivious to agro control and the melees were looting everything even when fights were still going on.  And of course between fights the players that didn't need healing or buffs would go off wandering, leading to the inevitable agro'ing of five mobs in the next room that would overpower the group and send us running.  I think everyone has been down this road before.  <br><br>Around this time I thought of quitting EQ.  It seemed like a pointless game to me.  Heck, all you do is find a group and a place to camp so you can gain exp and level.  Now you're one level higher.  So what?  Cleric heals, caster nukes, melee swings.  Occasionally there's a train and we all run.  Ho hum.  And with the flakiness of the average EQ player you don't even *think* about taking risks.  <br><br>Oh but there's quests, you say.  Yup, pointless stupid quests for an item that can ussually be bought in east commons for 10p with rare exceptions - items that in most cases you wouldn't even use.  And that stupid [bracketed] text system - drop your target or say the wrong thing?  Repeat quest.  Asinine.<br><br>So one day this 29 pally comes up to me in Befallen after I advertise that I'm looking for a group.  He asks my level, 21, asks what I'm swinging, crystallized 13/31, says it will do.  Says he has the key to the 2nd floor and off he goes.  <br><br>Now those of you familiar with Befallen know that *everything* will agro on you, regardless of level.  There's no such thing as waltzing into a lower part of the dungeon for xyz camp spot.  You have to fight your way in and out.<br><br>Now for this reason, I'm thinking we need more than just the two of us even if he is 29.  Even at 21 I'd been hen-pecked to death by the mid-teens mobs on the first floor.  I've been in groups of 6 on the 2nd floor with low to mid 20's players and still been overpowered.  But I followed anyway.  Why not?<br><br>This guy didn't talk much.  One or two words was all he said.  "Med here", "over here", "not there", "loot", etc.  <br><br>We'd take down a mob and move on deeper into the dungeon.  We didn't stop.  We moved fast.  Finally, when we had reached the furthest into befallen I had yet been, I asked him where we were going to camp.  We were now in areas that kept me on my toes even in a full group.  He said we were going to the key room!  <br><br>Was he nuts?  With only two?  <br><br>I decided to trust this guy.  He seemed to know what he was doing and this agressive dungeon crawling was so much more fun and exciting than the usual grouping and camping.  He knew where the spawns were and he had an uncanny sense for the re-spawn times.  He didn't fool around.  He'd kill stuff, heal, med, move on, repeat.  No telling me about his wife.  No asking me what I did for a living.  No "afk - gotta take out the trash, feed the cat, milk the cow, etc.".  <br><br>He was there to play.  Good.<br><br>I didn't want to die that far in but at the same time I couldn't believe we had gotten as far as we had, just the two of us, with so little trouble.  For the most part it didn't matter that he was 29.  The way we were moving would have been equally effective for someone at 15.  And this guy was picking that certain corner of the room that would agro the least number of mobs.  He seemed to know just when to med and heal and just when to move.  Instead of blundering through the place with a group of six we were totally out-thinking this dungeon with only two.  I had never played EQ like this before.<br><br>At some point I no longer needed his instructions.  We'd kill a couple mobs and he'd move to a corner and I knew that's where the safe spot was and I went there too.  When he sat down to med I did too.  <br><br>At the same time I stepped up to the challenge.  He was taking most of the hits since he generated the most agro.  When he got down to about 40% health I'd taunt the mob off for the remainder of the fight and add a couple undead nukes.  If he got low on mana from heals I'd automatically assist in healing.  <br><br>When we got to the key room we had to break a spawn of three mid-20's mobs, low blue to him and yellow or red to me.  After two of them we were both down to slivers and he had already used his LoH on me.  He rooted the last mob and we backed off and healed.  We both got to about a third before it broke.  Almost out of mana, we taunted the mob back and forth, healed, rooted, healed and *finally* it went down after we had pulled every trick we knew to kill it while we held on for dear life.  No two warriors of similiar level could have made it this far, I thought.  Not without a cleric, anyway.<br><br>Without saying a word he moved to the far corner and started meding and I did the same.  A couple pops later he made his one and only mistake.  A pop in the opposite corner moved along the wall toward us and agro'd the spawn outside in the hall.  Then a second popped in the room for a total of three.  At full energy we had barely survived but at half energy and low mana...<br><br>He made for the door and he didn't have to say a thing - I knew, I was right behind him.  On the top floor the locked door shut right in my face and I turned around to witness the worst train I'd ever seen heading my way.  The door popped open again and I made for the exit, both of us on slivers of health.  I kicked off my train social just before we zoned.<br><br>Outside we were congratulating each other for cheating death and within seconds a dozen or so other players zoned out of befallen with comments like "That train was RIDICULOUS."  After healing and med'ing we zoned back in and counted several bodies right inside the entrance from players that foolishly stuck around to fight. <br><br>No, we didn't get the key but it was within our grasp.  The second time around we did it easily.  It was almost boring compared to our first attempt.<br><br>Well since that day I play EQ in a whole new way.  I constantly ignore the risks and go into places I probably shouldn't.  I always print out a map of the dungeon and take notes of what spawns where and how often.  I note which rooms are tough to break and where the good med spots are.  <br><br>Since then I've led groups into places they were sure they shouldn't be.  There have been several occasions where this has meant seemingly impossible corpse runs but one way or another we all make it out.  And there are always group members that will quit because they think we're in over our heads.  <br><br>In a lot of cases you get happy-go-lucky players that snap to alertness when you agressively push into a dungeon, just like I did that first time.  They quickly realize you're pushing the limits of your character and quick thinking and smart playing are what will keep you alive.  They don't argue for five minutes over what the loot rules will be or bicker over a bad pull.  The only way to survive is to work as a team.   <br><br>Nowadays when I end up in a group that's more like a roaming cocktail party than anything else, I politely tell them I'm disbanding.  There's nothing that bores me more than playing with people that want to just find a nice safe spot to camp and gain exp and level.  What's the point of all that if you're not having fun?  And if you know you have to quit in half an hour, why join a group and then ditch them when they need you the most?  <br><br>Previous to this experience I didn't think EQ was a thinking person's game.  I figured you either grouped to gain overwhelming odds or you were decimated in short order.  Especially in such a tight playing dungeon as Befallen I never imagined a player could progress through without agro'ing the whole place on top of him.  If I hadn't run into this guy I probably wouldn't be playing even now.  <br><br>Good hunting!</p></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width="100%"><tr><td id=fs8></td><td align=right id=fs8 >3 Replies</td></tr></table></td></tr></table><tr><td>

There is a 10 mr earring I found at this site, and I asked my guild to go into droga so we could get some. We had 8 people, most around 35 or so, I was highest at 44. We managed to fight our way through the whole dungeon, through all of the goblin mines and frequently defeating 4 or more goblins at a time, although usually I could get a single using soothe.&nbsp;&nbsp;We only really stopped to look at the map, droga is confusing, or to let the chanter get some mana back up.   Finally we made it to a big room with a pool in it, and a temple. We killed all the goblins there, but while we were waiting several cleric goblins ambushed us and we had to evac, but it was getting late anyway. Droga was completely empty except for us and is very creepy with the goblin war drums beating in the distance, some of the rooms were full of 10+ goblins and were very dark, so I needed ultravision to scout ahead. <br><br>Zeal &lt;Sanctus Lumen&gt;<br>Erudite Paladin, Sullon Zek</p></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width="100%"><tr><td id=fs8></td><td align=right id=fs8 >0 Replies</td></tr></table></td></tr></table><tr><td>
