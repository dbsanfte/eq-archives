The easiest way to find him is to head to the North East part of the zone, towards Skyfire, and you should eventually pick him up on tracking.<br><br>You say, 'hail Telin Darkforest'<br>Telin Darkforest looks at you serenely. 'Hello, wanderer.'<br>You say, 'what are you doing in this forest'<br>Telin Darkforest says 'Mighty this place must have been, once. Now scarred by hatred and suffering. I have been sent here seeking answers to problems not yet understood.<br>You say, 'what answers'<br>Telin Darkforest considers you for a few moments before speaking. 'A great evil walks across the land. The hand of some demon we don't yet know is twisting and polluting forests.'<br>You say, 'what evil'<br>Telin Darkforest says 'If I knew that, I wouldnt be here looking for answers. I would be elsewhere, looking for solutions. For now, I suspect much but know little.<br>You say, 'what do you suspect'<br>Telin Darkforest looks at you and sighs. 'The lands are changing. Beasts, large and small, have turned upon those who watched over them. Druids and rangers, worshippers of both Karana and Tunare, have reported a feeling of hatred throughout their once peaceful lands.'<br>You say, 'perhaps it is Innoruuk'<br>Telin Darkforest raises his eyebrow slightly and a subtle look of surprise creeps across his face. 'Innoruuk? Perhaps. Aye. It must be. Perhaps I knew and didn't want to consider the possibility. It must be this though, and some action will have to be taken.'<br>You say, 'what action should I take'<br>Telin Darkforest looks at you consideringly and then scribbles something quickly on a small, worn paper. 'You seem powerful enough. Perhaps you can help those who seek to protect nature's peace. Take this note. Deliver it only into the hands of Faelin Bloodbriar. Where you will find her, I cannot say. She is a friend of mine and a wanderer. She has been seen from one end of the lands to the other.

Once you see either Faelin or an orc pawn spawn, you can procede to camp just that spot and not worry about additional orcs.<br><br>Give Telin&amp;#8217;s note to Faelin<br>Faelin Bloodbriar reads the note carefully and growls to herself. 'Bad news, eh? Take this ring. There is one elf, dark elf even, who we must go to in order to gather insight into Innoruuk's plans. Giz X'Tin, he goes by most commonly. Kithicor seems to be his favorite haunt and most likely you will find him there. Don't ask how I know him. Just take the ring as my sign to him and he will speak to you.

He said to spawn around POS 1000, POS 1500. It is known that he does wander the zone. I have seen hin on track durning the day and night time. The easiest way that I have found to find him is to run along the way between West Commons and Rivervale. If he is up, you will most likely pick him up on tracking. Most likely your faction with Giz X'Tin will not be high enough, cast Spirit of Wolf on yourself, run up behind him and sneak before you give him Faelin's Ring.<br><br>Give Faelin&amp;#8217;s Ring to Giz X'Tin<br>Giz X`Tin flips you a coin after he recognizes the ring. 'It seems we have a mutual 'acquaintance.' The coin repays an old debt. You don't have to worry about what that is. Luckily, Lord Innoruuk has informed me of your coming and your desires. Fortunately, I have all the answers you require right here at the end of my friend's blade. I think I'll be paying my old 'friend' a visit.'<br>Teir`Dal Reaver says 'Lord Innoruuk, I have failed you.

If you fail to kill the Dark Elf Corruptor you will have to the start quest over from the beginning.<br><br>Althele can be found close to the Barbarian Village around NEG 3650, NEG 1600. Tholris and Fang should also be there with her. If you see any of the other druids with her, do not give her the coin right away. First check to see if someone is currently in the process of doing this part of the quest. If this is the case, just wait for them to finish up. Althele, Tholris and Fang all respawn thirty minutes after all the druids have been despawned. The other possibility, is that someone had tried to do this part of the quest, failed and the spawn is messed up. If this is the case, you may have to wait for the server till after the server goes down again to be able to the quest.<br><br>You say, 'hail Althele'<br>Althele says 'Hello, friend. Beautiful is what I would call such a day normally but lately?<br>Give Coin to Althele<br>Althele looks at the coin and nods gravely at you as she slips it into a fold of her clothing. 'I see. The story of this coin speaks much to me as do the words you have given me. Telin sent word that you would arrive. The tidings you bring are ill indeed. Here, take this amulet and find Sionae. She is nearby. We will speak more on this matter when all are present.'<br><br>Althele gives you a &quot;Braided Grass Amulet&quot; to take to Sionae.<br><br>Braided Grass Amulet<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>WT: 0.1<br>Clas: ALL<br>Race: ALL<br><br>You say, 'hail Tholris'<br>Tholris stares in contemplation at the landscape.<br>Althele says 'Tholris does not speak much.

He is my hands, as Fang is my eyes.<br>Fang barks in response to Althele's words.<br>You say, 'why do you need him as your hands and fang as your eyes?'<br>Althele says 'Yes. I cannot see any longer, my sight long since lost in the march of years. By the blessings of Tunare and Karana, though, I still make myself useful.<br><br>Sionae spawns after you get the Braided Grass Amulet and can be found around NEG 2300, NEG 930.<br><br>Give amulet to Sionae<br>Sionae says 'I see that the time has come. Take the amulet and give it to the third of our kin, Nuien. I will meet you at the gathering.<br><br>Sionae gives you a &quot;Frayed Braided Grass Amulet&quot; to take to Nuien, who spawns near NEG 3650, NEG 300.<br><br>Frayed Braided Grass Amulet<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>WT: 0.1<br>Class: ALL<br>Race: ALL<br><br>You need to move quickly to Nuien. People who are Kill on Sight to druids may walk past him because of where he spawns. If this happens, Nuien will argo on that person. I do not know if he will argo on any hostile mobs in the area, but it is best to move quickly and not take that chance. If Nuien is killed, the spawn will be messed up and you will have to start all over. Even if Nuien argos on someone, you can still give him the Frayed Braided Grass Amulet. He will then start walking to the gathering place and Teloa will spawn.<br><br>Give amulet to Nuien<br>Nuien says 'So be it. Do as you have done before and find the next. Teloa is the last.<br><br>Nuien gives the &quot;Frayed Braided Grass Amulet&quot; back to you, and Teloa spawns near the waterfall around NEG 3800, NEG 2860.<br><br>Give amulet to Teloa<br>Teloa begins walking toward the gathering spot. 'Follow me to the gathering now.'<br><br>Follow Teloa back to where Althele is, which is where the druids are gathering. You will not have the amulet at this point as she does not return it to you.<br><br>Althele says 'Great mother of life and father of sky, growth and spirit, Tunare and Karana. Innoruuk once again schemes and we have failed in our duties to protect our land. We give our powers in sacrifice for your help. Heed our call and send us your wisdom.<br>Althele snaps her head towards you. 'Innoruuk's brood is upon us. Go, find the spawn of hatred before they reach this point and destroy them!'<br><br>Dark Elf Corruptor and several Dark Reavers spawn, level supposed to be 50ish. Only the Corruptor is said to have to be killed. It is recommended that you root him, so he does not despawn on you. Additionally, it has been mentioned that he cannot be pulled, so you have to rush in and attack him.<br><br>Dark Elf Corruptor shouts 'We come for you, fools. Your reign of weakness over the powers of the land comes to an end now!<br><br>The easist way to do this is to have two group of people waiting on the hill. The first group will attack the Dark Elf Corruptor immediately. The second group will kite the Dark Elf Reavers to keep them distracted until the Corruptor has been killed. Even though you will miss most [or all] of the fighting, you should be one of the people in the group killing the Corruptor just so that you will be able to loot his corpse right away and get the &quot;Fleshbound Tomb.&quot;<br>Once the Dark Elf Corruptor is killed, the group killing the Corruptor will take out the reavers. Even though some advocate killing the corruptor and letting the reavers get the druids. I don't recommend this for several reasons. First off, it is not within the theme of the quest to let the druids get killed. Secondly, it is more time productive to kill the reavers also then turn in the Felshbound Tomb to Althele right away.<br><br>Fleshbound Tomb<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>WT: 0.5<br>Class: ALL<br>Race: ALL<br><br>Give the &quot;Fleshbound Tomb to Althele.<br><br>'Althele hands the book to Tholris who reads through it with lines of concern etched on his face, then whispers into her ear.

Ella Foodcrafter will run all over the zone. The wait usually isn't long, so it is easier to wait for her to come to the guards. She doesn't stay in one place for long, so you may want to bring along a friend to constantly hail until you give her the Earth Stained Note.<br><br>You say, 'hail Ella Foodcrafter'<br>Ella Foodcrafter says 'Hi, hi.

Make sure that you hit the Combine button on the Pottery Wheel after you place all items in it. If you close the Pottery Wheel without hitting combine, you will lose all the items and have to re-do parts 3-5 of the quest.<br><br>Runecrested Bowl<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>WT: 0.5<br>Class: ALL<br>Race: ALL<br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Part 7: Obtain the Ancient Longsword<br><br>Item Checklist:<br><br>You should have the following items:<br><br>Shiny Tin Bowl: see part 1 to obtain [required] <br>Hardened Mixture: see part 2 to obtain [required] <br>Runecrested Bowl: see part 6 to obtain [required] <br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Ella Foodcrafter in Misty Thicket, Antonica<br><br>Give Ella Foodcrafter the Hardened Mixture and the Runecrested Bowl.<br><br>Ella Foodcrafter smiles slowly as she works the mixture in the bowl and it starts to shine with power. 'This is... a piece of a lost magic item known as Nature's Gem. When restored to completeness I've heard its healing powers will be extraodrinary. Take it now.I will take the bowl and hopefully do some good from my end. From here, you can go many ways but I can't guide your path step by step.

'You must be the one that has been spoken of. Yes, yes I am one of the circle. There are many of us in the lands right now, all seeking answers to the ills that have befallen our homes.'<br>You say, 'what answers?'<br>Foloal Stormforest says 'I have heard whispers of new Iksar movements in the land. The name of Venril Sathir is on the scaled lips and sharp tongues of every cold blooded lizard in this place.'<br>You say, 'what about venril sathir?'<br>Foloal Stormforest says 'All I've heard are whispers of connections between the undead lizards and the dark god of hate. There's some kind of history behind the two. It might be that Venril is the main focus of Innoruuk's will in the land. Then again, maybe not, but this is the best we've gotten so far. If you think you can do it, then find him and remove him from the face of this earth. Bring me the half of the stone I know you have and whatever conduit of power you find on his rotting corpse.<br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Venril Sathir in Karnor's Castle, Kunark<br><br>If the normal spawned version of Venril Sathir is up, he must be killed. This causes Venril Sathirs remains to spawn.<br><br>Venril Sathirs remains says 'The living fire. I seek the fires of life. Bring them.<br><br>Use the spell Dance of the Fireflies to summon a Firefly Globe. Give Venril Sathirs remains the Firefly Globe, which causes the Spirit of Venril Sathir to spawn.<br><br>Venril Sathirs remains grasps the glowing sphere of fireflies from your hands. Tendrils of mystical energy begin to flow forth from the swarm of glowing insects like tiny fingers. The glowing tendrils begin to reach into the ribcage of the rotting remains of Venril Sathir, coalescing into the form of an iksar ghost.<br><br>You say, 'hail Spirit of Venril Sathir'<br>Spirit of Venril Sathir says 'So mortals, you seek to end the tainting of Tunare's children? So be it, I have no cares. My death has been caused by this foolishness and I want no more to do with it. Bring me a scroll with the knowledge of resurrection so that I may once again live. I will hand you that which you seek.<br><br>Give the Spirit of Venril Sathir the Level 49 Cleric Ressurection spell.<br><br>Spirit of Venril Sathir says 'I am alive! My thanks to you. And now I will aid you in your quest for preserving the forests of norrath. Your carcass will help nurture the soils of the wilderness.<br><br>Venril Sathir respawns. Kill Venril Sathir to get the &quot;Pusling Green Stone,&quot; which identifies as Pulsing with a sickly light. This version of Venril Sathir should be easier to kill as I have been told that he does not Lifetap. He will drop two Pusling Green Stones and nothing else.<br><br>Pulsing Green Stone<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>WT: 0.2<br>Class: ALL<br>Race: ALL<br><br>NOTE: There is an alternate method of obtaining the Pulsing Green Stone. The alternate method requires you to go to Howling Stones, kill Drucilla Sathir for the Phalactery, and give this item to Venril Sathirs remains. The remains will give you one Pulsing Green Stone and despawn.<br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Foloal Stormforest in Firiona Vie, Kunark<br><br>Give Foloal Stormforest the Softly Glowing Stone and the Pusling Green Stone.<br><br>Foloal Stormforest blinks and carefully takes the stones from you, cautiously scratching the jagged green stone against the other. Its skin seems to shiver and flake at the contact and eventually begins to shine brightly. 'With the gem nature's balance is complete. Take the stone and walk your path. Blade or lightning caller, burning sword or the mother's walk.'<br><br>Foloal Stormforest gives you the &quot;Warmly Glowing Stone,&quot; that identifies as Natures Balance Completed.<br><br>Warmly Glowing Stone<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>WT: 0.4<br>Class: ALL<br>Race: ALL<br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Telin Darkforest in Burning Woods, Kunark<br><br>Give Telin Darkforest the Warmly Glowing Stone.<br><br>Telin Darkforest nods as he unbuckles his sword and hands it to you. 'The storm callers are working on containing and fighting against the corruption but they can not hold back the inevitable for long. It is up to us to strike against Innoruuk directly. If we were warriors or paladins we would have a fancy ceremony and plenty of feasting but we're just rangers, without time for pleasantries. The sword you hold in your hands is one of the oldest blades known, even to the eldest. To strike at the darkest heart of evil requires a weapon beyond this, or even ones you may carry at your side. The first task, the first preperation you must make is the smithing of that blade. Its edge sharpened, its balance made perfect. When you have finished, bring me this sword again.<br><br>Telin gives you an &quot;Ancient Longsword,&quot; which identifies as a &quot;Finely Crafted Longsword.&quot;<br><br>Ancient Longsword<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>Skill: 1H Slashing Atk Delay: 25<br>DMG: 10<br>STR +5 HP +10 SV DISEASE +5 SV POISON +5<br>WT: 1.5<br>Class: RNG<br>Race: ALL <br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Part 8: Obtain Swiftwind &amp; Earthcaller<br><br>Item Checklist:<br><br>You should have the following items:<br><br>Shiny Tin Bowl: see part 1 to obtain [required] <br>Ancient Longsword: see part 7 to obtain [required] <br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Kinlo Strongarm in Kaladim <B>, Faydark<br><br>Kinlo Strongarm is located in Kaladim <B> in Everhot's Forge, bottom floor. This part is completely optional. It is here just for completeness as it adds to the story of the quest.<br><br>You say, 'what ancient'<br>Kinlo Strongarm says 'The ancient smiths, for what I think yer askin about, ain't been around fer a long time, laddy. Last anyone heard o' the ancients was 'fore my time even. There be more than a few tales about 'em.<br>You say, 'what few tales'<br>Kinlo Strongarm says 'There be some who talk about how the ancient smiths went down to work fer the duke o' below, sayin he be needin some fine dwarven smiths fer makin some castle or some such. There be tales that the ancients were so good at smithin that the duke took 'em down and made 'em head smiths over his minions. There's even tales that some o the smiths' souls were trapped in their hammers, stuck there by some necromancer or somethin, as punishment or retribution.<br>You say, 'what hammer hammers?'<br>Kinlo Strongarm says 'Aye. Some says their souls were bound into their hammers by an Erudite necromancer and enchanter. They say they used the power of the hammers ta profit by makin ships, boats, and houses better than any other merchants. Sad tale, if'n it be true.<br>You say, 'what Erudite necromancer?'<br>Kinlo Strongarm says 'I'm not knowin more about the story, lad. Everythin I know is already in what I said. Aye, Erudites. I suppose if yer wantin ta run after shortbeard tales ya can look over on that plague island they call Odus.<br>You say, 'What Erudite enchanter?'<br>Kinlo Strongarm says 'I'm not knowing more about the story, lad. Everything I know is already in what I said. Aye, Erudites. I suppose if yer wantin ta run after shortbeard tales you can look over on that plagued island they call Odus.<br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Jaeil the Wretched in The Hole, Odus<br><br>Jaeil the Wretched can be found in The Hole. I do not have a location for him because I have not heard of anyone having difficulties finding him. He does not despawn and should always be there. Like Venril Sathir, this will require a guild raid to complete. If you can deal with Venril Sathir, you can deal with Jaeil. This will be a triggered spawn, and you will need to be prepared to fight him.<br><br>Jaeil the Wretched whimpers pathetically as his reflection catches his eye. He turns and stares pitifully at the ceiling.<br><br>Jaeil the Wretched shields his eyes from his reflection in the water, occasionally gibbering as he scratches at a flapping, rotted patch of skin on his sunken face. In his arms he cradles something. He seems to emanate an aura of power.<br><br>Stand behind Jaeil the Wretched to make him indifferent to you, then give him the Shiny Tin Bowl so that he will see his reflection.<br><br>Jaeil the Wretched howls in anger, his body seeming to suck energy from the walls around him as he sees his reflection. He pulls a hammer from the bundle in his arms and swings fiercely at your head.<br><br>Jaeil the Insane spawns and attacks. Kill Jaeil the Insane and loot the &quot;Soulbound Hammer,&quot; which identifies as Hammer of an ancient dwarf. Jaeil the Wretched will still be there; just ignore him as he is not part of the fight. You only need to fight Jaeil the Insane.<br><br>Soulbound Hammer<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>Skill: 1H Blunt Atk Delay: 50<br>DMG: 2<br>WT: 5.0<br>Class: RNG<br>Race: ALL<br><br>If for any reason your entire raiding party dies at Jaeil the Insane or on the way there, the easiest way to recover is by having some people make Halfling Rogues that worship Brell Serilis, then have a Druid port to Misty Thicket to pick them up and port them to Toxxulia Forest, cast Spirt of the Wolf, then run to the Hole. Additionally, you can bind in the Paineel area, near the lake outside The Hole. If you duck, you should be able to fit through the crack in the door. Mobs in The Hole will look at these characters dubiously, but will not argo. You will want at least two - one to drag corpses from past the drop down point to the ledge and a second to drag corpses from the ledge to near the entrance area.<br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Kinlo Strongarm in Kaladim <B>, Faydark<br><br>Give the Soulbound Hammer to Kinlo Strongarm. [Note: This part is optional. It is here to give you a clue as to what eventually needs to be done with the hammer.]<br><br>Kinlo Strongarm examines the hammer respectfully, admiring its craftsmanship. He strikes it against his anvil and winces as a howl fills the air. 'This is one of the ancients' hammers? I can almost, well, almost hear it callin ta me. It's strong, that's fer sure, lad. I don't know how ye got it, but aye, a dwarf could make a mighty blade with this. It's lookin like this thing still has its owner inside it though. I'm not knowin how, and not wantin to know, but fer yer own good ye better find some way ta get 'im out.'<br><br>Kinlo gives you back the &quot;Soulbound Hammer,&quot; which identifies as Hammer of an ancient dwarf.<br><br>Soulbound Hammer<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>Skill: 1H Blunt Atk Delay: 50<br>DMG: 2<br>WT: 5.0<br>Class: RNG<br>Race: ALL<br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Mairee Silentone in Eurdin, Odus<br><br>Mairee Silentone is in the jewlrey shop near the bank. She is at the back of the store. If your faction with her is less than indifferent, stand behind her and use sneak.<br><br>You say, 'What ancient hammer?'<br>Mairee Silentone says 'Yes, the ancient hammer. I heard something about that. Do you mind if I take a look at it?'<br><br>Give Mairee Silentone the &quot;Soulbound Hammer,&quot; which identifies as Hammer of an ancient dwarf.<br><br>Mairee Silentone makes a few marks on the hammer, and all the while you can hear a muffled cursing coming from the hammer head. 'Yes, it is an ancient dwarf's hammer. Interesting artifact. I've marked it to keep it stable while you retrieve something for me. You need to travel to the Plane of Air and find a swirling sphere of color. Bring it and the hammer back to me.'<br><br>Mairee Silentone gives you the &quot;Dwarven Smiths Hammer,&quot; which identifies as Hammer of an ancient dwarf.<br><br>Dwarven Smiths Hammer<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>DMG: 2<br>WT: 5.0<br>Class: RNG<br>Race: ALL<br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Plane of Air<br><br>The Swirling Sphere of Color drops on either Island 4 or 5 [depending on if you count Djorn's Island.] To get to Island 5, you must do all the previous islands in order. Since Island 2 [Djorn] may be skipped, it is not always counted. The Islands are: <br><br>Fairy <br>Djorn <br>Azarack <br>Gorgalisk <br>Pegasus &amp; Griffons <br>Spiroc <br>Bazzazzt <br>Sister of Spire <br>Eye of Veeshan <br><br>The way the mobs work on this island is that you will first see Level 52 mobs. When these are killed, they split int two new mobs that are Level 54. When the Level 54 mobs are killed, they split into two new mobs that are Level 56. One of the Level 56 mobs will be an &quot;Essence Tamer Griffon,&quot; which is the mob that drops the Swirling Sphere of Color, and it drops it every time.<br><br>The Plane of Air can only be reached by the Level 46 Wizard spell &quot;Alter Plane: Sky.&quot; This spell does require a reagent to be cast called &quot;Cloudy Stone of Veeshan.&quot; This reagent can only be purchased at the 3rd floor of the City Library of Erudin and costs around 200-250PP depending on your faction.<br><br>Go to Island Five of the Plane of Air. Kill the Essensce Tamer to get the &quot;Swirling Sphere of Color,&quot; which identifies as Magic Sphere from Plane of Air. This will require a major guild raid to complete. If your guild can handle Venril Sathir, it should be able to handle this.<br><br>Swirling Sphere of Color<br>Magic ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>Class: ALL<br>Race: ALL<br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Mairee Silentone in Eurdin, Odus<br><br>Give Mairee Silentone the Dwarven Smiths Hammer and the Swirling Sphere of Color.<br><br>Mairee Silentone holds the sphere and makes intricate marks and patterns on it, eventually turning the entire crystal clear. She rolls it across the hammer, raising a ringing sound in the room. 'There. Now take the hammer back to Kinlo. He'll know what to do from here. Good luck to you .'<br><br>Mairee Silentone gives you the &quot;Hammer of the Ancients,&quot; which identifies as Hammer of an ancient dwarf.<br><br>Hammer of the Ancients<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>Skill: 1H Blunt Atk Delay: 40<br>DMG: 2<br>WT: 5.0<br>Class: RNG<br>Race: HUM ELF HEF<br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Kinlo Strongarm in Kaladim <B>, Faydark<br><br>Give Kinlo Strongarm the Hammer of the Ancients, which causes Usbak the Old to spawn.<br><br>Kinlo Strongarm looks at the hammer and nods once before slamming the head against his anvil, and shattering the head. In a cloud of dust, another dwarf appears from the cloud and tosses you a hunk of metal. Kinlo stares in awe.<br><br>Usbak the Old gives you &quot;Small bit of Mithril Ore,&quot; which identifies as Small bit of Mithril Ore.<br><br>Small bit of Mithril Ore<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>WT: 3.0<br>Class: ALL<br>Race: ALL<br><br>You say, 'hail Usbak the Old'<br>Usbak the Old says 'Took ya long enough!

If so lemme see it.<br><br>If you found it necessary to use sneak to get Kinlo to respond to you favorably, you will need to use sneak with Usbak the Old as well. Give Usbak the Old the Ancient Longsword and he gives you the &quot;Refined Ancient Sword,&quot; which identifies as Sword to show Telin.<br><br>Refined Ancient Sword<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>Skill: 1H Slashing Atk Delay: 20<br>DMG: 8<br>WT: 1.5<br>Class: RNG<br>Race: HUM ELF HEF<br><br>Usbak the Old admires the blade and then starts to bang the edge with a hammer.

Give the Small bit of Mithril Ore to Kinlo Stirngarm and he forges the &quot;Refined Mithril Blade&quot; for you.<br><br>Kinlo Strongarm says 'Erm. Well, I aint never worked with this stuff but here's what I got for ya. It ain't bad, pretty much like the one ye got there.

'Now that's fine work. Just a moment, we have a friend here who can enchant one of the blades. Give her the blade the ancient smithed.'<br><br>Faelin Bloodbriar appears. Give her the Refined Ancient Sword. She enchants it and returns it to you.<br><br>Faelin smiles at you, then closes her eyes as she sets the gem 'Nature's Balance' into the crossguard and begins to channel her spirit into the sword. The ground rumbles loudly as she casts. She collapses in exhaustion after a short time. 'Take the blade, and perhaps you can finish this. You must strike at Innoruuk's heart. Bring his shattered gem and the mithril blade to Xanuusus. Only with Innoruuk's death can the balance of the land once again be restored.

The Shattered Emerald of Corruption is now a random/rare drop from any of the sub-boss mobs in the Plane of Hate. If you are not on a raid to kill Innoruuk, I strongly recommend clearing the entire zone to increase the chances of getting this paticular drop from one of the other mobs.<br><br>Shattered Emerald of Corruption<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>WT: 0.1<br>Class: ALL<br>Race: ALL<br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Xanuusus in North Karana, Antonica<br><br>You say, 'hail Xanuusus'<br>Xanuusus says 'Greetings, small one!

With care for such a huge creature, he melds the gem into the sword and seems to glow all over as he channels energy into the weapon. 'Thus is the link of hate broken between Innoruuk and the spirit of earth. Through your will has balance returned.
