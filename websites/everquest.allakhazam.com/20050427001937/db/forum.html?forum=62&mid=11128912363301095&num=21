So he did for about 10 minutes.  Honestly, I didn't notice a big difference (keep in mind, I'm about 2 weeks into the game).  <br><br>Well, I'm a &quot;grownup&quot; n00b now and people ask me to PL.  In general, I don't PL people I don't know.  For two reasons:<br><br>1.  I end up PL'ing for 3 - 6 hours.  LOL  My eyes go crossed and it gets mind-numbing boring.  <br>2.  If these people are quite new to the game, it doesn't teach them their job or their &quot;combat skills.&quot; I'm the one tanking and the tank isn't getting &quot;evasion skill ups&quot; or any other defensive skill ups for that matter.  <br><br>So in the end a PL can hurt new players much more than it can help them IMHO.  But then it comes to LS members who are Rank 5+ and have jobs well into the 40's and 50's who want to level, let's say THF (which is probably the most annoying job to level until 15), I do so more than willingly because god I hope they PL my little low jobs in return some day!  <br><br>But then there's the gray area, let's say I'm NIN and in the dunes, with some people without subjobs.  Should I get a PL?  I try not to cause even un-subjobbed players can be awesome and I've had parties go fantastic in the Dunes.  Anyways, thoughts?  Opinions?  Stories of PL's?  <br><br>(Side Story)<br>I had my mentor flag up once.  This guy noticed I was a higher lvl WHM and decided to ask for a PL.  When I told him I was busy and couldn't PL me, he started cursing me out and calling me a bad mentor.  O.o  He quickly got b-listed as I went on my way.  LOL /sigh<br><br><br>Edit:  Obviously a bitter person who destroys LS's keeps rating me and my fellow LS members down.  ; ;  Thank you guys for the responses!<br><br>My other reason for sometimes PL'ing is to raise my Healing Magic skill which I think must skill up about as slow as Summoning Magic.  Anyone else have any ideas for raising this without PL'ing?<br><br><br><i><span class="sm">Edited, Fri Apr  8 14:06:06 2005 by Jiade</span class="sm"></i></p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br />Jiade--Remora<br>WHM61/BRD58/BLM38/DRG27 ... and others<br>San d'Oria Rank 6<br>WHM AF:&nbsp;&nbsp;1 [x] 2 [x] 3 [x] 4 [x] 5 [x] 6 [x]<br>BRD AF:  1 [x] 2 [x] 3 [ ] 4 [x] 5 [ ] 6 [ ]<br>Genkai:  1 [x] 2 [x] 3 [x] 4 [ ] 5 [ ]</td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8">Posting from Virginia</td><td align="right" id="fs8" >35 Replies</td></tr></table>

You're a crutch for them to lean on so they can take on stuff they should never think of taking on.&nbsp;&nbsp;And they don't learn a true sense of their capabilities.  It's almost never good enough to tell your toddler the iron is hot, cuz 9 times out of 10 they gotta touch to realize it hurts.  And people that haven't been forced to do it on their own a few times tend to expect too much per kill without taking the party makeup into account.<br><br>2. By limiting how much healing the whm's are able to do you gimp their healing skill stat, and it's hard enough to keep capped.  And it becomes incredibly boring for the healers because they feel useless, as a general rule.  <br><br>3. 10-25 is where you really learn how to play the job well, and for most if you don't get a good feel for the job in these 15 levels, then most people never will.  Having a power level throughout this region of levels allows the entire party to slack off, and just mash buttons while killing stuff, never being forced to learn the more advanced styles of play.<br><br>Powerleveling isn't as damaging to player skills if it's a babysitting role, waiting for things to go to hell before saving the day, but making the entire party work for their experience.<br><br>And as a thief I've had the displeasure of partying with people that were clearly powerlevled.  Tanks that refuse to stand still despite how often or nicely you ask then to stand still, samurai that don't know what a skillchain is let alone how to pull one off, and the inability of these morons to understand how to set up a proper SATA, despite only asking:<br><br>1. the tank to stand still<br>2. another melee to stand behind the mob<br><br>I often wonder if people are simply role playing the intelligence stat too literally when they play melee classes.</p></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8"></td></tr></table>

In most cases, getting a PL is completely wasted experience (even for Rank 5+). Not experience <b>points</b>, but the actual hands on experience of coming into the role of a certain job. When I finally decided (and believe me, it was a very long, drawn out decision) to get Utsusemi and try leveling NIN, a couple of LS friends and I formed a party in the dunes and had one of our high-level SMN friends PL us. I hated it. I was confused. I had no idea how Utsusemi worked, how to cast it, when to cast it, ect ect ect. I got two levels that night though! Yay! The next day however, in my first actual exp party, no PL... I was completely lost. I was taking beatings, I couldn't keep any of my shadows up, hate was all over the place... Quite frankly, I had no idea what I was doing. I loved it. It was the actual hands-on experience that began my long lesson of actually understanding how to Blink tank. How to actually play as a NIN.<br><br>So, even though PLs are extremely convenient... especially when you're starting from lvl 1 on your 6th 25+ job... I honestly think in negates from what will come to be your overall effectiveness playing as that job.<br></p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br />Nalin --&gt; Female Hume<br>RDM61/WHM45/RNG35/NIN20/BLM24 - Remora :)<br>~*Bastok Rank 6*~ PM 2-5, ZM 4-1<br><br>RDM AF 1[x] 2[x] 3[x] 4[x] 5[x] 6[x]<br>WHM AF 1[x] 2[ ] 3[ ] 4[ ] 5[ ] 6[ ]<br>Limit Break 1[x] 2[x] 3[x] 4[x] 5[ ]<br>Clothcraft:32 Cooking:55 Alchemy: 26<br><br><a href="http://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?72508" target="akztarg">http://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?72508</a></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8">Posting from Aurora, Colorado</td></tr></table>

I ripped through Qufim and the Jungles in a fraction of the time it took to get past Valkurm. Just about every party I was in consisted of players who knew what they were doing, and had workable job combinations. In general, people always had current gear that was suited for their job.<br><br>Now when I'm levelling my War in Yuhtunga/Yhoator, 4 out of 5 parties consist of people with underlevelled subjobs that make no sense (WHM/MNK.. What the hell?!), outdated gear, and absolutely no clue on how to play! And every single time I get stuck in one of those parties, the first question asked by a different member is 'Who is the PL?'. The worst part is, I'm sure the powerlevelling epidemic extends into Garlaige, East Altep, Crawler's nest and more.<br><br>After seeing all of this firsthand with my lower jobs, it's not surprising when I try to level my Monk now that so many people suck, even at this point in the game. It's these same people that just want to power their way through the whole game without ever learning how to play it.</p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br />Moridam on Remora<br>Rank 6 Bastok<br><br><a href="http://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?32031" target="akztarg">http://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?32031</a><br><br>As of 4/3: MNK 54/ WAR 27/THF 17/BRD 17/WHM 9 /RNG 5/BST 3<br>AF 1: O 2: O 3: X 4: X 5: X 6: X<br>LB 1: O 2: O 3: X 4: X 5: X</td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8">Posting from Worcester, MA</td></tr></table>

It was in dunes, they were all high rank and understood their jobs, and were paying me a lot.  They even managed to keep the hate off me most of the time, which didn't matter much but said quite a bit about their skills.<br><br>Last night I spent 2 hours in the Dunes helping people out.  I run around anon and in newb camoflauge (lvl 14 gear) so I don't get constant requests for raises and powerlevels, but last night was different.  In the entire time I was there, I didn't hear a single shout for a raise. O.o  As I wandered around, every single pt there had a powerleveler. One lvl 13 pt even kicked their whm because he didn't want to take on a gob mugger!  I had a nice conversation with that party's pl'er in /tell and convinced him he was hurting them in the long run and he left. ^^<br><br>I got all the way to level 23 before I got into a powerleveled party in Qufim.  It was kind of nice, but not fun at all.  I got loads of exp but my skillups lagged behind and I had to spend a few hours in town working on them later because of it.<br><br>My worst experience by far has been in Kazham from 25-31.  I couldn't believe how many idiots and gimps were there, and I can only blame it on pl'ers in Dunes and Qufim.<br><br>There is only 1 way to pl people without hurting them imo:  Stop links and aggro and heal them between battles to reduce downtime.  If you feel like it, you can save the pt from a wipe with a carefully timed cure II but keep in mind that you learn the most when you die.</p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br />Janx<br>11 brd 38 whm 18 blm<br>Rank 3 Bastok Hume<br>Remora Server<br>Bonecraft: 40 Leathercraft: 5<br>Goldsmithing: 8 Smithing: 16</td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8">Posting from NE, USA, ZZ Plural Z Alpha</td></tr></table>

However, we all know the road to higher levels is not one easily tread. We cannot, and would not be able to receive a Power Level ALL of the time. The longest Power Level I have had was perhaps 2 hours. Now, when you figure 2 hours in the DAYS which many players devote to leveling up their jobs, it is hardly enough time for someone to actually not be able to learn their job. This game provides plenty of time for players to be able to become acquited (sp?) with their jobs, and a Power Level once in a blue moon would not dampen that seriously. Instead, a Power Level can allow the Exp grind to go by a little easier. Let people worry about only the SC which they are not familiar, or simply as a way to see how much damage one can honestly dish out without holding back.<br><br>Now, I also realize that new players, once they have tasted how much faster exp rolls in with a Power Level, would start to beg for more Power Levels, and that can be a problem. However, those n00b (yes, I am aware of the difference, and chose to use n00b) that consistently ask for PL can be reasonably assumed to also be players that would cut corners, not listen to others and think of themselve primarily as well. These combined traits all contribute to making them bad players, not we cannot solely blame a few hours of PL as the cause of all their inaduquacies.<br><br>Hence, I vote for PL, because I honestly do not see true harm being done by having a Power Level. I myself have received numberous PL in the course of leveling up various jobs, and so far, I have not been told by any party members that I am poor players despite having had some Power Levels.</p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br />Cay<br>Server: Remora<br><br>Main: Pld48/War24<br>Nation: Bastok Rank: 5<br>Craft: Cooking 60.0; Alchemy 50.0<br>PM: 1-2; ZI: 0; AF: 1[O], 2[ ], 3[ ], 4[ ], 5[ ].<br><br><a href="http://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?83635" target="akztarg">http://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?83635</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8"></td></tr></table>

The General Discussion forum often has this topic spring up, and it usually turns ugly pretty quickly.  So good job on keeping it intelligent!<br><br>PLs, in themselves, are not evil.  They can be useful at times.  They can also be detrimental.  It's a matter of context.  However, I have personally received 4 PLs from friends in my entire time in FFXI (that does not include being in a party where someone else has brought a PL with them).  I have <i>never</i> asked for a PL.  And I have refused a number of PLs, because I felt that I did not know the role of my current job (be it thf, bst rng, etc) well enough for my liking.<br><br>Why? Everyone here has mentioned the obvious: you don't learn your role.  I won't repeat it- I think that Nalinn made the best analogy with his experience as a new NIN.  But, that is a part of the problem that arises.  I will expand a little:<br><br>Add to that your weapons and defence skills won't level properly.  Think about this: you hit mobs and get skillups.  With PLs, you don't have to hit as much most of the time, because you don't have to worry about pacing yourself.  Thus, things like your shield skill, block skill, ranged skills won't level as well, and you end up having to go back to skillup parties to make up for it.  And let's face it, who wants that WAR in the party that always misses?  Heavy damage is great, but not if the great axe never connects!<br><br>Also, in the PL parties that I've been in, the players get sloppy.  WHMs don't need to cast Heal, Protect gets neglected, and spells are haphazard.  BLMs overnuke because they think they will just be healed, so they don't learn the importance of pacing their spells.  WARs don't provoke every 30 seconds, and don't use Boost every 15 seconds if they're subbing MNK.  THFs have a harder time doing SA (and later SATA), because the hate keeps jumping from the &quot;tank&quot; to the DD to the PLer.  In general, if the party plyed <i>without</i> the PLer in the same way, they'd die a lot, and lose xp.  Since the PLer is there, they get away with it.  The longer (and more frequently) a player is in a party with PLers available, the more likely he or she will be as sloppy without one, because it takes practice to keep your skills and timing up to par.<br><br>Finally, I know everyone and their mother says &quot;back when I first started, things were different...&quot; BUT... When I first started, PLs were nowhere near as common.  I would get one or two parties out of a dozen that had PLers present- and I'm talking about the Dunes.  Now, I have to seek a party without one more often than not.  I can say that I am comfortable with my WAR, MNK and THF abilities and weapons/defense levels because I made sure I got as much exposure to PL-free parties as I could in the limited party experience I have had (I've said how much I hate the exp grind).  One thing I personally don't want is to join a party and realise that I'm the one that is the weak link.<br><br>So yes, go out and get an occasional PL if you wish.  However, be aware that PL parties are best used infrequently.  As Cay mentioned, most PLers aren't willing to do more than an hour or two at a time.  However, when one person in a party says &quot;My PL has gtg in 5 min&quot;, and someone else pipes up a second later with &quot;My PL is otw&quot;, it's time to look critically about the calibre of people churning out levels and where they'll end up.  They may end up killing you in later levels because they can't hold hate, or overnuke, or don't have critical skills up to par for their job.  <br><br>My final vote: Everything in moderation, but just say no to frequent PL parties.</p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br />Wondroustremor (Remora):<br><a href="http://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?46812" target="akztarg">http://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?46812</a> <br>No matter how the wind howls, the mountain cannot bow to it.</td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8">Posting from Bermuda</td></tr></table>

WHMs don't need to cast Heal, Protect gets neglected, and spells are haphazard. BLMs overnuke because they think they will just be healed, so they don't learn the importance of pacing their spells. WARs don't provoke every 30 seconds, and don't use Boost every 15 seconds if they're subbing MNK. THFs have a harder time doing SA (and later SATA), because the hate keeps jumping from the &quot;tank&quot; to the DD to the PLer. In general, if the party plyed without the PLer in the same way, they'd die a lot, and lose xp. Since the PLer is there, they get away with it. The longer (and more frequently) a player is in a party with PLers available, the more likely he or she will be as sloppy without one, because it takes practice to keep your skills and timing up to par. <hr size="1" /></blockquote> actually I rather like that little blurb lol.<br><br>I would like to disagree however that xp rolls in faster with a PLer, that Cay has pointed out.&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually by personal experience, I find PL parties have horrid xp/hour rate than ones without.

One of my buddies was being pl'ed thru some levels in qufim, since we were bored, and my staff skill needed leveling, I decided to join.  I was like blm23 or so and he was some melee job of about the same level. forgot the exact job but he was armed with an axe - that I remember).  Since this was a roaming pl, even though I was a blm, I ended up doing mainly mele work with mb's on the sc's.<br><br>You're going &quot;wait a sec, blm... melee... wtf...?&quot;.  Yep it was a weird ass setup.  but it worked.  I rested when the pl needed to rest and since I was melee'ing I wasn't having the hate problems of most blms get so familiar with.  The sc's and the bursts compensated nicely for the lack of extra people and we were always on the move.<br><br>The thing here is that that was the only case in my memory where the pl was faster than a good party.  Most of the time it is usualy slower.  This is not the pl'er's fault, it's usualy the puller/leaders fault.  Also due to the lousy mob availability in the dunes - it's one of the worst places to PL in vanadiel.<br><br>Which raises the question if PL'ing is not faster than a good party, why do newbies do it?</p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br />Strangeone - RDM/BLM (usualy) Tarutaru (always)<br>62RDM 32BLM 18SAM 17RNG 14WHM 13PLD 12DRG 11THF 11NIN 11BRD 10WAR 10DRK 10BST 8MNK 8SMN<br>60WoodC 60BoneC 47ClothC 17SmithC 8CookC 8LeatherC 8Alchemy (rest lower)<br>Rank: 8&nbsp;&nbsp; ZM: 7   PM 2.4   AF: <span style='color: olive;'>1 2 3 4 5 6</span style='color: olive;'>   GK: <span style='color: olive;'>1 2 3 4</span style='color: olive;'> <span style='color: red;'>5</span style='color: red;'><br>ChaosStorm LS, Elusive LS - Remora Server</td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8">Posting from Montreal</td></tr></table>

I am frequently asked to PL, and as a general rule, if you're asking me randomly, you're not going to get it.  Secondly, I don't think PL's hurt all that much, as long as, like has been said, it's done in moderation.  Leveling up your 4th, 5th, 6th, etc job gets to be tedious.  And I feel that as long as the people know their role, and still perform them, then everything will be ok.  I generally don't PL parties, simply for this reason; however, I PL many of my friends up to Lv. 10 - 12 so they can get into parties quickly.  Weapons will cap often 3-4 fights into the next level, because they're taking on T mobs all by themselves (so to speak).  Evasion wouldn't level as high, etc, but that's something that the person asking for a PL, has to deal with, and sacrifice in order to get to the level that they want.  I usually PL 6-10, and I just PL'd my freind's ninja to 10 not 2 hours ago.  <br><br>In reply to the poster who mentioned the WHM in the party feeling left out and useless.  I ran into this on the Carbuncle server.  We had a Lv. 66 PL, that was just throwing huge cures out everywhere, all my curing was doing absolutely nothing.  So, I just sat there, when afk and went out to get something to eat.  I returned to my computer to find myself a level higher, and the party still going strong.  A wholly empty experience I must say, so I decided to melee and level my club skill up.  When PL'ing keep that in mind.  <br><br>As a general rule, when I PL parties, I make sure they're made like a normal party, and I'll tell them to battle like they would, and I'll take turn with the resident WHM.  They take on two mobs while I watch, as a safety net.  To eliminate downtime, the WHM rests, while I take his place, and I try to take hate, just to make my job a little easier.  After that battle, the mages are completely rested up, and I sit back down for about few minutes, resting my MP and watching the party.  I would suggest this to people that PL.  They can get good XP, because the PT is set up well.  No one really loses that much in the way of skills, and the WHM won't feel useless.  You're simply there as a &quot;just in case&quot; for instance, the puller got aggro'd by a gob on the way back to camp.  And the WHM can safely rest, while you keep his party alive, and the process starts over again.<br><br>As for overnuking BLMs, I simply warn them, that my time is precious, and I refuse to cure a tanking BLM.  Learn to pace yourself, and not draw hate.  Once in a while, the BLM draws hate, that's fine.  But if I'm PL'ing, and the BLM is tanking 8/10 fights, I'll tell him one last time, that I'll a) let him die, or b) be on my way.  Often this ends with the leader, sometimes the BLM, saying I'm paying you, do as I say.  I can do without your 10k per hour my friend, but apparently you can't do without me.  I can earn that much farming to tele taxi'ing.  <br><br>Anyway, sorry for the long-winded post but I hope some will take my advice, and PL'ing won't be looked down upon as much...<br><br>P.S. Yes, when I walk through Valkurm, it seems at least 50% of parties now have a PL, it's sickening. </p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br />~Simplicity~ [Remora]<br>WHM55/BLM27<br>Cooking: 14 &gt;.&gt;<br>Fishing:&nbsp;&nbsp;3 m(_ _)m</td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8"></td></tr></table>

The PLer would cast their cures, and when they run dry, resident healer take up the charge etc. This being said, I do have to agree that this would only be true if the party knows it's limit, and fight VT and occasional IT for exp chains.<br><br>On a side note, it is my opinion that most people no know fully understand how to obtaining faster exp/hr. Alot of people I run across seem to think that as long as each fight give ~180-200 exp, then the party is good, even though the party is barely making chain #1s and the down time is immense. To truly obtain great exp/hr, the trick is to use IT mobs to finish as higher chains. Specifically, start chain with a T mob, chain #1 with VT, chain #2 with IT, chain #3 with VT, chain #4 with VT if party can make it to chain 5 or IT if not. To have fluid exp chain is simply way better than to have 200 exp per fight, but 3 minutes b/w each fight for resting.<br><br>But hey, I think I'm preaching to the choir here ;).<br><br>Anyways, back on topic. The PLed party would have very fast exp/hr, especially in the dunes if they decide to go with exp chains. In fact, with a PL, the party can maintain the chains faster and longer, hence making having a PL viable. However, this is IF the party knows this.<br><br>Guess that's just about as much as I have to say on this topic. Great to see something that is hotly debated did not resort to alot of name calling and insults ^^.</p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br />Cay<br>Server: Remora<br><br>Main: Pld48/War24<br>Nation: Bastok Rank: 5<br>Craft: Cooking 60.0; Alchemy 50.0<br>PM: 1-2; ZI: 0; AF: 1[O], 2[ ], 3[ ], 4[ ], 5[ ].<br><br><a href="http://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?83635" target="akztarg">http://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?83635</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8"></td></tr></table>

As a result, the melee fighters connect with the mob a lot less than they normally would, and it's left to the mages to nuke them, which results in a long, drawn-out fight that actually often gives a lot less weapons skillups than it should.  It also explains why the mobs seem to get pissed at the BLMs and RDMs more often in PL parties- not just because the mages are overdoing it, but the melees are getting in less hits, and less hits means less hate.

I have told people to &quot;make me an offer, or to get me interested&quot; but nobody has yet done so.<br><br>That being said. I dont know if it hurts them or not.. alot of people on here talk about &quot;playing skill&quot; and I tend to think that &quot;playing skill&quot; is developed by a combination of several methods.<br><br>1. Copy other good players or copy well known methods.<br>2. Read guides online and copy there methods.<br>3. Listen to your party members when they tell you what to do.<br>4. Experiment with new ideas, and try to figure it out.<br><br>A method that does not work is..&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>5. spend a sh*tload of time doing exactaly the same thing over and over without knowing if its right or not. (This is generaly what you get from parties.)<br><br>..but honestly if you havnt done any research, or never seen a certan job played well before.. its going to take you a very very long time to get the hang of ANY job. PL'ing IMHO wont really help or hinder this. I swear to god.. people sucked before PL's because they didnt learn what others expect of them.<br><br>As for skill.. I dont thnk people solo enough. Most of my really big skill gains have made I did solo. The game also makes soloing at high levels almost imposable but .. when you do so.. you do so for skill.. not for exp. I honestly think people party too much.<br><br>Most parties dont even know how to use a PL. they go for the IT's and they should be going for the T's .. so the exp isent that good.<br><br>Lastly most PL's in the dunes dont know how to do it very well .. so the exp isnt very good. (and if your reading this.. here is my &quot;homegrown&quot; method. Keep stoneskin up. Have the tank voke once. Have the white mage banish nuke or melee. wait for the tank to get to about 1/3 hp then cure him fully with one apporate Cure spell. You now have hate, so take a knee and rest till the end of the fight. rinse &amp; repeat.)<br><br>If your wondering, No, I dont PL people often, I've only done about 5 ever, and again none for money. Yes, I join n00b parties and sometimes die with them. Yes, I try to teach them and Yes, I actively work to make Remora a better place instead just complaining about PL'ers or Gil sellers.<br><br>End note.. I have no vote here. I could go either way but.. There are bigger problems then PL'ers.<br><br><i><span class="sm">Edited, Thu Apr 21 05:31:42 2005 by Jadier</span class="sm"></i></p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br />"OK, so ten out of ten for style, but minus several million for good thinking, yeah?" -- Jadier // Remora</td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8">Posting from REMORA</td></tr></table>

Just like I blame PLer's for all the bad parties I've been in because of truly clueless players that have made it out of the trying levels of 10-20.<br><br>Every single bad player I've had the unfortunatude to group with on remora has been PLed through valkurm.</p></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8"></td></tr></table>

He'd think like &quot;Hey this PT sucks, I need a PL.&quot; rather than thinking &quot;Hmm... this doesn't work out, why is that?&quot;. Sound like they would be relying on PL. Then once they reach level 30, it's all about &quot;Can someone help me with this xxxx? {Reward}&quot; without even attempt to ask people they know during their lower levels (if they manage to make friends) and gather some people at similar levels to try it. It's hard to make friends if you don't go through some challenges together.<br><br>With some people charging for PL and Raise, new players will have the idea that if no {Reward} no {Help me out!} in Remora. This is depressing. There wasn't such a thing 2 years ago when English players are mostly lower levels. I don't even know when did the whole server start charging the people they help out.<br><br>Even for people at higher levels, they still refuse to look for a way to refine their skills. Any pld out there know that the more you tank as a pld the better you become at tanking no matter how bad you are at start. As you play other jobs you start having insights into those jobs (esp sub job) and reflect it into your main job you will notice what should you be doing to make the PT better. If you get a PL through those 10~20 levels then you'd probably not get enough 'real' experience on the job you level and won't improve.<br><br>This carries out to the missions and quests too. &quot;I just want to do it and be done with it&quot;.... These quests and missions reveal a great story line behind it and you just want to &quot;be done with it&quot;. Hire a high level player (a mage who can sneak/invisible you) and let him do everything, you just /follow and &quot;be done with it&quot;. I'd rather do it as a lower level party and have some fun even if we fail.<br><br> As people get deparate and offer {Reward} the higher levels will feel that it is about right to charge [this] much for helping [that] quest. &quot;I have people offering me 200k to help on this quest yesterday, so 150k {Reward} is about right.&quot; - Well, it's not wrong to ask for reward since they spend their time to help out someone unknown. But what important is that people somehow get the idea of an option {Reward} will gives you a better chance of getting high level help and be done with your quest.</p></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8"></td></tr></table>

Though it can sometimes be a true test of how skilled you are; soloing doesn't really teach you your job though.  This game is entirely reliant on parties and trusting your party members knowing their job, and when a party member doesn't know know his job its very apparent and should be critised (however them listening is a whole other matter).<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote><b id="fs8">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />As people get deparate and offer {Reward} the higher levels will feel that it is about right to charge [this] much for helping [that] quest. &quot;I have people offering me 200k to help on this quest yesterday, so 150k {Reward} is about right.&quot; - Well, it's not wrong to ask for reward since they spend their time to help out someone unknown.
