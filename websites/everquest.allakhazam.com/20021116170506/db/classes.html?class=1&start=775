Sarnak Battlehammer 30dmg 40del is half the price of any velious 30dmg 40del weapon and is warrior only, I hit like a god with it.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Don&#8217;t know?&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, neither did I until I started doing some experimenting with my Warrior.  I wanted to hit for the most dmg possible and be able to taunt as efficiently as possible.  Also, I was looking for that rush I got when I was a newbie and a fight got real hairy.  Some Warriors may do this already and it is just not talked about much.  I have been playing around with this since level 15 and I am level 40 now.<br><br>Disclaimers: <br>Warriors, if you try this and die it is no ones fault but your own.<br>Make sure you can trust whom you are grouped (guild mates or good friends) with.<br>I do not recommend doing this in a pick-up group (even though I have, successfully).<br>Do not do this below level 15 un-twinked.<br>I was in a full set of smithed banded armor at level 15.<br><br>Details, Details, Details:  You get a chance to Critical Hit when you are in battle.  These wonderful blows are few and far between though.  Your chances for achieving a Crit rise when you are berserk.  You go berserk when you are at or below 2 bubs of health.  If you are at less then 1 and half bubs of health you start to get a chance to deliver a Crippling Blow.  At level 15 you have the Dual Wield and Double Attack skills.  This also increases you chance to Crit and Cripp because you attempt to hit more often.  Ok so the goal is to keep your health at one to 2 bubs of health so you stay berserk and to hit as much as possible. WARNING: People playing a Cleric may become physically ill in RL watching a Warrior gamble like this because they are so ingrained to HEAL, HEAL, And HEAL.<br><br>Here we go.<br>Create some hot keys.  &#8220;&lt;&lt;&lt; DO NOT HEAL ME, YET. &gt;&gt;&gt;&#8221;  &#8220;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAL NOW PLEASE!! &gt;&gt;&gt;&#8220; These Hot Keys do not guarantee that you will get healed in time which is the reason for the name HP Russian Roulette.<br><br>Make sure you have the right people in the group.  Warrior, Cleric and Shaman (this is the optimal combo).  You can also have several other combinations but every group member has to know exactly what is needed form them.  You can substitute a Druid for a Cleric.  A Ranger and Enchanter can substitute (sort of) for a Shaman.  Having a 2nd Warrior in the group is nice and if both are willing to gamble even better.<br>Warrior:  Can Pull, Hit and Taunt.  Also verify that Mana Supply for casters is sufficient.<br>Cleric:  Can heal and give Protection Buffs (i.e. Guard, Bravery and Symbol (if possible)).  Also needs to determine the right heal spell to use.  This is probably the most difficult to determine.  Sometimes Stun MOB Warrior is on and occasionally Root Park a second MOB if no one else in group can.<br>Shaman:  Can give BUFFS (what I call the FULL BANK) STR, STA, AGI, DEX, HASTE and SHIFTING SHEILD.  Also can SLOW the MOB.  If Enchanter is in the group hopefully they can HASTE and MEZ.<br>Druid:  If  Pri-healer (Cleric should always be healer if one is in the Group) heal, protection buffs and Harmony (if camp needs to be broken).  If not Pri-healer and no Shaman in the group.  Give buffs (STR), Snare and DD attacks.<br>I could go on forever and I can&#8217;t say that I know everything a class can do to assist this process but the aforementioned are the basics.  I have done this with just a Cleric before, but I prefer to have the other classes in the group too.<br><br>Making sure you are pulling properly and the right MOBs is essential.  When pulling DO NOT (even if you have SoW) run up to a MOB and engage it then run back to group.  Use a Bow and from the furthest distance it can hit from tag a MOB then head back to the group. You never want to take dmg of any amount away from the group.  Pulling a Red /con creature is like having the Mafia collect on a gambling debt so I don&#8217;t recommend pulling Reds.  Single pull Yellow or White/Black /con creatures are ok, but if a second Yellow to Blue wanders into the fight the bullet is going to line up with the chamber REAL fast unless someone in the group is very good at Root Parking so everyone can move away form the second one to finish off the first one.  And it is better if you have a group of 5 to 6 if you are going to pull Yellows or White/Black /con creatures. Single pull Blue /con creatures are optimal.  Now if the first Blue is half or more dead and a second Blue wanders into the fight it is a little more manageable.  If possible Root Parking is preferred but not always necessary.<br><br>I was gambling two nights ago in EW with a Cleric, Shaman and myself.  We where hunting Ulthorks.  The Ulthorks where all BTM and I landed multiple Critical and Crippling blows on each creature.  Also, last night I was in GD bear 3 in a full group no Shaman.  Group make up was Rouge, Ranger, Cleric, Druid, and 2 Warriors.  So I did not have STA, DEX or HASTE buffs so the Crit and Cripp hits did not happen as often as they did in EW with the Shaman.  The Kodiaks where BTM and I was the highest level, main puller and taunter in the group.<br><br>Conjo Dracon<br>Warrior 4oth Season<br>7th Hammer<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Heres some suggestion on how to play a warrior. People will probably argue with this but this is how I prefer to play my warrior.<br><br>Ok stats to concentrate on are AC str and stam. These three are most important. Some people same agi is important because it raises AC and makes you run faster but you have a hard enough time raising str ac and stam so dont worry about it. You will get agi bonuses from crafted armor and other items. Dex supposedly affects weapon procs but with shaman buffs and werewolf form, I have 241 dex and I have really noticed a significant difference so I suggest leaving it alone.<br><br>Ok when starting your warrrior unless you are playing an ogre or troll or some other race with naturally high starting stam, put MOST of your starting points into stam. Now most people will argue with me and say put it all into str but str is a MUCH easier stat to raise to stam. Your character might not be so good early off but it will be much easier to find str items than it will be stam items and will help your character much more later on in the game<br><br>As far as weapon skills, until about lvl 40 or 45 use two hand weapons BUT keep your one hand skills and dual wield up. This will be difficult but after 45 warriors get signinifact increases with the dmg they do with weapons and therefore dual wield almost always does more dmg than 2h weapons at high levels. <br><br>As far as items go, I think its best to try and balance out str and stam. Being a warrior with really high attack but low hp wont cut it if you have to be main tank. And being a warrior with really high hp and low attack wont cut it either when your a secondary tank or the only tank. So I think its best to have good attack and good hp. But I think AC is important above all so work hard to raise your HP. Its hard to balance out str and stam while going for AC but it can be done and I'm sorry but dont have any suggestions at the moment cause not on my character and cant remember the exact stats on some of her gear.<br><br>Caseth Fuzybuny<br>Level 45 Proud Halfling Warrior<br>Member of "The Harvester's of Souls"<br>Povar Server<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I am sorry but I will not likely respond to any questions you may have, so please just make best of this that you can. Read on and good luck to you on your adventures....<br><br>p.s. The stats on the chars may look a wee bit messed up (but they are in order) so you will just have to count and make sure you have the correct place for the number as for the stat.

It also affects how fast you learn offensive skills. It also affects your &#8220;attack rating&#8221; (ATK) which is thought to help you land your attacks more often. This is a good stat for the warrior. There have been many that start a character over because they found out later that they did not have the muscles to carry plate armour, weapons and loot without being &#8220;encumbered&#8221; (going past your weight allowance) which will lower agility (AGI) and thus lower armour class (AC)  which means you will get hit more often, and take more damage when hit. So make sure you have a decent amount of strength, after all, you are a warrior right?<br><br>Stamina: (STA) affects how long you can breath under water without having to come up for air. It also affects how long you can battle for. Swinging that big arse axe of yours can tire ye out. Note: a funny thing about STA, if you jump a few times it will drop your STA bar like it aint nothing. Last but not least, it is the stat that adds hit points (HP) to your &#8220;total HP count&#8221; every time you level up.<br><br>Dexterity: (DEX) affects how hard you hit with your bows, how fast you learn weapon skills, and how often a magic weapon will process it&#8217;s effect. This also affects how often you will score critical hits (CRITS) and crippling blows (CRIPS)  (Note: &#8220;crippling blows&#8221; are pretty much &#8220;critical hits&#8221; that happen while you are in &#8220;berserker mode&#8221; which is when you reach 2 bubs of health and lower). Note: DEX has been thought to affect how often you land blows with melee weapons, but this is not so. ATK and weapon skills affect how often you land blows.<br><br><br><br>Agility: (AGI) affects how often you get hit or missed by an attack (melee) and how much damage you take when you get hit (Note: AGI ads a small bit to AC, so this is why it takes away damage directed towards you). It also affects how fast you learn defensive skills.  Since this affects if you get hit and how much damage you take it is a good stat for warriors and casters (or hybrids like a Paladin) because it will make you have a less chance of having your spells disrupted. <br><br>Intelligence: (INT) affects either the chance of raising up in a skill (such as Fletching) or the chance of making a successful attempt (actually making an item) at creating something using a skill (such as Fletching) (INT and WIS are both worth the same thing to a warrior. Nothing)<br><br>Wisdom: (WIS) affects either the chance of raising up in a skill (such as Fletching) or the chance of making a successful attempt (actually making an item) at creating something using a skill (such as Fletching) (INT and WIS are about worth the same thing to a warrior. Nothing)<br><br>Charisma: (CHA) affects how good of deals you get at vendors when buying and selling. That is it for that one. You will not care after you level up a bit because you will be selling good items to players and trashing (or giving away) the rest.<br><br>Deity: The choice of deity affects how non-playing characters (NPC&#8217;s) will view you.  In general good citizens like people who worship good gods, and vice versa.  This factors into the prices you pay at the stores, the quests you are given, and the willingness of guards to come to your rescue.  When choosing a god, think how it will affect your role- playing.  Certain class/deity combinations are killed on sight (KOS) in some towns.  A rogue who worships the goddess of love will probably face ridicule at the local thieves guild and have a hard time convincing someone to train him. On the other hand, a wizard who worships chaos will probably find few friends in the more civilized cities.  This is not an unimportant choice.<br><br>In my opinion, I think this is the order of importance on stats, but you are the one creating your character. STR, STA, AGI, DEX. If you choose a character with high STR and STA such as an ogre, troll or barbarian, then I would say this order, AGI, DEX, STR, STA.<br>Keep in mind, although we do &#8220;hack and slash&#8221; deal out damage, we are meant for taking damage (hence the word &#8220;tank&#8221; or &#8220;meatshield&#8221; which you will become familiar with) So you may want to think of what stats are most likely to keep you alive longer and also let you pound on some mobs. Also keep in mind that we warriors are not going to be the ones dishing out the most damage, so just deal with it. It is your job to keep that girly man in the dress alive so he can twiddle his thumbs and make things go BOOM.<br><br><br>Now lets take a look at what certain races have to offer you as a warrior.<br><br>Barbarian: The barbarian starts off in the city of Halas, in the frozen Northlands. <br>Barbarians (along with Ogres and Trolls) get the ability to &#8220;slam&#8221; which is the same as bash (you can stun a mob and cause it to not cast its spell and also cause it to not be able to run) but you do not need to use a shield to do so. You can &#8220;slam&#8221; while using a 2 handed or two 1 handed weapons. Slam is very important to train and keep it maxed Barbarians are also the only race that has the ability to wear large or medium armour (medium cost less to buy) Barbarians are tall and may find some trouble fitting in certain areas or through doors that were made for Dwarves, Gnomes or some types of Elfs. Barbarians do not have any special seeing ability. They do, however, look cool with their blue war paint that most of them have on. Barbarians are a good a good race.<br><br>Dark Elf: The epitome of evil, Dark elves start out in the underground city of Neriak. The dark race can see in the darkness as well as the light, and has the innate ability to hide from their foes. Being a dark race, however, has its problems. They are KOS (killed on site) to most cities in the game, hence the word &#8220;difficult&#8221; you will be prompted with when you choose this race. Dark Elfs wear medium armour. Dark Elves are an evil race.<br><br>Dwarf: (My personal choice) Dwarves start off in Kaladim, on the continent of Faydwer. At home in the mines, dwarves see very well (not as good as the Dark Elf though) at night. Dwarves also do this cool tuck and roll when they jump. Since they are small they will have no trouble fitting into tight places, but they do have trouble seeing a mob coming if a small hill is between them. Dwarves start off with their sense heading (inner compass if you will) at 50, so they are good at telling what direction they are facing. Dwarves wear small armour (the cheapest to buy) Dwarves are a good race.<br><br>Gnome: Gnomes start off in Ak'Anon, which is located at the far end of the continent of Faydwer. As a subterranean race, gnomes can see very well in the dark.  Gnomes are also the only race to get the tinkering skill, letting them make some nifty, even if mostly useless, trinkets. Gnomes are a small race so you will not find it hard to move in and out of tight places. You will, however, find it difficult to see mobs over even some of the smallest hills. Gnomes wear small armour. Gnomes are a good race (unless you choose to be a Necromancer).<br><br>Half Elf: Half elves start off in Freeport or Qeynos/Surefall. Half Elves are considered a good race.  Not quite accepted by wither race, half elves inherit traits from both of their parents.  From their elven parents, they gain infravision and thus can see well in the dark.  Yet they retain much of the hardiness of their human heritage, and are thus stronger and sturdier than most elves. Half-Elves can only wear medium sized armour.<br><br>Halfling: Halflings start out in the city of Rivervale, which probably has the nicest of all the newbie areas.  Halflings are considered a good race and are welcomed in the good cities of Norrath.  Halflings are also able to see well in the dark, and have the inate ability to hide and sneak.  Of all the races, halflings tend to level the fastest. I belive they can only wear small armour. I am a Dwarf and bigger then a hafling and I can only wear small armour myself.<br><br>Human: Humans can start either in Freeport or Qeynos/Surefall.  Humans get the most choices of classes, are one of only two races that can play a monk (the other being an Iksar), and level faster than most other races.  However, they suffer from lesser overall starting stats.  A human can  play any class except the Shaman.  Humans are considered a good race, unless they pick an evil class.  Humans cannot see the dark, and need a light source when going out at night.  Other than halflings, no other race levels as fast as a human. Humans can only wear medium armour.<br><br>Iksar: The Iksar are the only race that starts in the continent of Kunark, starting in the city of Cabilis.  The lizard people are hated by both the good and evil races in the rest of the world and have a lot of difficulty playing outside their starting continent.  Overall, they get very nice stats. The Iksar has the inate ability to forage, has infravision, and has the very nice ability to regenerate at a rate of 3 hp per tick. They a also get a bonus to swimming (100 at creation I believe) I believe they wear only medium armour,  a lot of items in the game (armour and such) can&#8217;t be wore by Iksars. So you will have to look in different places to find armour that you as an Iksar can wear.<br><br>Ogre: A powerful race, Ogres start off in the city of Oggok.  Ogres are fighters by trade and can only play a shadowknight, shaman or warrior.  They are the strongest and most naturally powerful of all the races.   Considered an evil race, Ogres are killed on sight in most cities of Norrath.  Many players who play ogres like to talk in broken speech, so be forewarned when trying to communicate with your fellow players. Ogres (along with Barbarians and Trolls) get the ability to &#8220;slam&#8221; which is the same as bash (you can stun a mob and cause it to not cast its spell and also cause it to not be able to run) but you do not need to use a shield to do so. You can &#8220;slam&#8221; while using a 2 handed or two 1 handed weapons. Slam is very important to train and keep it maxed. Ogres also have a added bonus of not being able to BE stunned by mobs (melee only) that attack them from the front. Ogres can only wear large armour.<br><br>Troll: Trolls, like Ogres, are innately powerful fighters with a high strength and stamina.  They start off in the city of Grobb, far south in Antonica. Trolls have the innate ability to regenerate damage, gaining 2 hp per tick.  As an evil race, they are killed on sight in most cities.  Like ogres, players who play trolls like to speak broken english. Trolls (along with Barbarians and Ogres) get the ability to &#8220;slam&#8221; which is the same as bash (you can stun a mob and cause it to not cast its spell and also cause it to not be able to run) but you do not need to use a shield to do so. You can &#8220;slam&#8221; while using a 2 handed or two 1 handed weapons. Slam is very important to train and keep it maxed. Trolls can only wear large armour.<br><br>Wood Elf: The wood elf is the earthier of the two-elven races, and more of a fighter than a caster of magic&#8217;s.  They start in the tree city of Kelethin over the Greater Faydark.  Because of their connection to the woods, all wood elves are able to forage for food and hide from their enemies. Wood elves also have excellent eyesight and can see in the dark. Wood elves can wear BOTH small and medium armour.<br><br>Now lets take a look at some of the abilities we get as Warriors.<br><br>Critical hits: This can start happening at level 12. This will allow you to land hits (automatically) of up to 2x your normal damage.<br><br>Crippling blows: This is a &#8220;critical hit&#8221; that happens when you are in &#8220;Berserker frenzy&#8221; see &#8220;berserker frenzy&#8221;<br><br>Berserker frenzy: When you get low on health (2 bubs or lower) you will be stronger than usual. If you happen to land a &#8220;critical hit&#8221; it will be converted into a &#8220;crippling blow&#8221; which can reward you with attacks of up to 4x your normal damage.<br><br>Magic resistance: We do not have any magical powers but we have learned to build a defense (no surprise there, we are indeed the best classJ) for magical attacks. We get 1 extra point &#8220;sv magic&#8221; every 2 levels we grow.<br><br>Now lets take a look at &#8220;disciplines&#8221; and what they do and when you get them.<br><br>Evasive: Becomes available at level &#8220;52&#8221; Duration time is 3 min and recycle (how long it takes before you can use it again) time is 15 min. Effect: The warrior is hit by his opponent less often but also will hit his target less often.<br><br>Charge: Level &#8220;53&#8221; Duration time is 14 seconds and recycle time is 30 min. Effect: When using this discipline the warrior will automatically land all attacks against his opponent.<br><br>Mighty strike: Level &#8220;54&#8221; Duration 10 seconds and recycle 60 min. Effect: When using this discipline all landed attacks will automatically be either Critical Hits or Crippling Blows.<br><br>Defensive: Level &#8220;55&#8221; Duration 3 min and recycle 15 min. Effect: The warrior will take less melee damage but also will deal less. This only affects &#8220;melee damage&#8221; nothing else.<br><br>Furious: Level &#8220;56&#8221; Duration 9 seconds and recycle 60 min. Effect: When using this discipline the warrior will automatically riposte every attack landed by the opponent.<br><br>Precision: Level &#8220;57&#8221; Duration 3 min and recycle 30 min. Effect: The warrior will have a greater chance to hit his target but will also have a greater chance of being hit.<br><br>Fell strike: Level &#8220;58&#8221; Duration 12 seconds recycle 30 min. Effect: All hits landed by the warrior will be for at least 4x the base weapons damage.<br><br>Fortitude: Level &#8220;59&#8221; Duration 8 seconds recycle 60 min. Effect: The warrior cannot be harmed by &#8220;melee&#8221; attacks. Magical attacks are not affected at all.<br><br>Aggressive: Level &#8220;60&#8221; Duration 3 min recycle 27 min. Effect: The warrior will do more damage with every blow landed but will also take more damage as well.<br>Now lets take a look at when some of our skills cap (will no longer progress as you level)<br><br> LVL	 TRAINING	 PRE-50 MAX	POST-50 MAX<br>--	Defense	210	252<br>--	Offense	210	252<br>1	1-H Blunt	 200	250<br>1	1-H Slash	200	250<br>1	2-H Blunt	200	250<br>1	2-H Slash	200	250<br>1	Archery	200	240<br>1	Kick*	149	210<br>1	Piercing	200	225<br>1	Taunt	200	200<br>1	Throwing	113	200<br>5	Bind Wound**	100	210<br>6	Bash	200	240<br>6	Dodge	140	175<br>10	Parry	200	230<br>13	Dual Wield	200	240<br>15	Double Attack	205	245<br>25	Riposte	200	225<br>35	Disarm	200	200<br>60	 Triple Attack	--	 ?<br><br>                            The &#8220;kick&#8221; skill will also be able to stun after level 55.<br>                            The &#8220;bind wound&#8221; skill (after level 60 at skill level of 201)<br>                            will heal up to 70% of your life.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>okay, this is coming from a lvl 12 HALFLING warrior, i chose halfling because i have a halfling druid and really like the rivervale-fp area, as well as having good faction. now, where to lvl-<br><br>1-4: There is a quest near the druid guild, some guy named reebo leafsway will hand you a crate of rotten carrots when you talk to him. give him the carrots back and you will get a regular box of carrots back. take these to the lady in the fools gold, for exp, cash, and faction. now ask her about the stew or soup, and take the bowl of soup she gives you to a guard in the first floor of the bank, in the room with the long table. you get xp, faction, and cash. Doing this whole quest once through gives you half of lvl 1- and around 2gp as well! do it over and over, you never even have to zone!<br><br>4-9: okay, train in the war guild and spend your points as you chose, and then buy a large sewing kit for 1pp, and head out past the wall in misty thicket. at lvls 4 and 5, take only giant rats, large bats, and shadow wolves. at 6, start taking giant bats, and possibly group at goblins. at 7, head to the goblin or orc camps, stay there until lvl 9. for every 4 runnyeye beads you get, sherrif rugulo(sp) will give you great xp cash and faction, as well as food and drink. Also, at the orc camp, save every single DF belt you get.<br><br>9-12: at lvl 9, head on over to EC, get in an orc group, and have fun! just a reminder about those belts, if you cant get a group at any time, just start auctioning that you want to sell some DF belts for 5pp each. i saved every single belt i have gotten, and just sold them all for over 300pp! this is a great amount of money at this lvl, and you can easily make this much too.<br><br>12-15: at lvl 12 you get critical hits, which will do wonders for your dmg output, as long as you have a good dexterity (i have a 123, thx to my 100 natural dex.) As a halfling, i get roughly 3 times the amount of crits and crips than the ogre/troll/barb standing next to me. The ogre warrior tells me about his coloassal str, how mine sux. he has a 150, i have a 124, not too bad. The barb tells me about his 112 sta, i tell him about my 119 sta. he starts to cry. The troll thinks he has me beat with his regen, i have a high lvl cleric friend gheal me. halflings own! anyway, where to lvl??? west commons, of course! either solo YKs and wisps, or group at derv/orc camps. The WC orc camp is bigger than both EC's combined, so the exp is better.<br><br>15-20: well, you now have dual wield and double attack, lucky dog. I have a gnoll hide lariat and a langseax to dual-wield, and a BIBS for nice dmg. I set a new record for my dmg, 98/98, to crips in a row, with double attack. it was awesome. took half health off the orc i was killin. Anyway, the best exp at these lvls is not oasis, it is high pass hold. At 15, get in an orc group, kill them until 20. These are your first lvls when you actually loot good armor- ring mail. While its not as good as banded, bronze, crafted, etc, once you get a full load sprint to EC, and sell a whole suit for 150pp or so, to some newbie twink warrior. great money, and exp<br><br>20-30: LoIO, all the way through. either hunt wildlife just outside the zone from firiona vie, off to the left of where the river meets the lake, or get in a sarnak group- sarnak ceremonial dagger, sword, and other rare drops will make this easily your best money session ever, and the exp is very good as well. Also, at 20 the dmg cap is removed. whats a dmg cap you ask? <br><br>okay- from lvls 1 to 9, the most dmg you can do in a single hit is 21. This basically means that any weapon with a dmg of 11+ instead has a dmg of 10. i have seen so many people wielding exe axes at lvl 5 it isnt even funny. the axe is basically a 10/50 untill lvl 10, the ratio sucks, a 15pp langseax is better, as is a 15pp sarnak great cleaver. From lvls 10 to 19, the dmg cap is raised to 29, meaning any weapon w/ a dmg of 15+ instead has a dmg of 14. At these lvls a BBC, BIBS, and LoW all have better ratios than most any 1hs around, so use them good. The most single-blow dmg you can do under lvl 20 is 98, wielding a weapon of dmg 14, when you crip. the dmg is 7 x the weapons dmg- 7 x 14= 98. At 20, the dmg cap is banished, so you can do your 175+ with one crip while wielding an exe axe.<br>anyway, thats enough for now, go Halflings!!!<br><br>Aoeladre, <br>Halfling Warrior, <br>Red Circle of Death(soon ot be officer)<br>Nameless server<br><br>ps- any questions? gimme a tell<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well.. first of all Ogres do what warriors do best better than any other race - tank. Of course they have that insane HP and strength too, meaning they are one of the best warrior damage dealers (though some argue the fast races are better in melee.. not too sure if that's true or not). And I don't see that many Ogre warriors, they're about as command as the rest I think. <br><br>Trolls have a noticeable strength difference and worse charisma I believe.. but regeneration really makes them a worthy choice. Most warriors stop trying to solo around 20-25 because it takes way too long to rest all your HP back (unless you have a healer or regen on, either way you can get both in a group so no point going through the bother). If you use bind wound and the troll's regen, however, I have heard that trolls can keep on soloing for awhile longer. and they have better agi/dex than ogres too.<br><br>but.. I do think that soloing for warriors is kinda dumb later on, since you're so wanted in groups you won't have trouble finding one. so in my opinion I think you should pick ogre over troll.<br><br>duergar, dwarf warrior<br>prexus<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Dear Duergar,<br>Here is a little Advice from a 28th Warrior Dwarf, just what you neeed, eh?&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, forget about using duel wield as your primary, there is a big reason for this, cost.  Don't get me wrong, practice your duel wield brains out, cause you will want it when you hit, say 40 or so, but until then, you will want to make sure your 2hs is up there good.  Don't bother practicing Bash, you just discard it when you get duel wield.  The reason for wanting duel weild is this: when you buy a weapon, you are paying mostly for the ratio (dly/dmg) and a little for the buffs and weight.  First, there are a lot more 2hs weapons with better ratios for cheaper than 1hs weapons, the good 1hs weapons don't come along till later.  Second, 2hs weapons often end up costing the same or less for the same ratio as 1hs weapons, and you have to buy TWO of the 1hs weapons to use duel wield.  Example; I use as a 28 warrior, a Executioners Axe, 25-50 (ratio of 2) and haste which procs around 30, so when you get to 35 or 40, the stats are more like 25-40, (ratio of 1.7) Now, that axe costs about 300-400 pp now, pretty common, easy to find.  Before I got that Axe, I was using an Icetooths claws 11-29, and a Crystalline Fiber 7-24, I think.  The Icetooths Claws, besides being difficult to find, cost over 400 pp often, and for the Crystallized Sword with the same stats, about the same.  Crystallized Swords and the Claws are almost impossible to find for under 400 pp, and difficult to find at any price.  that means you are paying over twice the price for something with nearly 1 and1/3 times the ratio.  Its really pathetic.  You would think that fighting with two weapons would give you more damage, but your total ratio is what matters, and 1hs weapons with buffs and ratios below 2 don't appear until at least the 40s.  So my message to you is, keep your 2hs up, and your 1hs, and use duel weild when you get it until about 20-25, then swtich to 2hs.  trust me, its better.  For your first duel wield 1hs, try langseaxs, they go for about 20-30 pp, and have pretty good stats for that price and level.<br>As for the armor, the Dwarven ringmail Tunic is best until you can get Bronze or Plate.  If I were you, I'd start looking around right now for Bloodforge Armor in Butcherblock or GFAY.  It looks like black chain, is magic, fits dwarf warriors only, has better stats than banded and regular chain.  The magic means that if you punch or kick(by the way, practice kick when u get it, you will be using it forever) you will be using a magic weapon, and will be able to injure mobs that can only be hit by magic weapons.  Also, bronze, or any type of plate is better than chain, Bloodforge, or Banded.  Buy chain or banded, or bloodforge, wear it till about 18 or 20, then get Bronze, then FP around 25, then Crafted armor around 30.  My advice for armor now would be Bloodforge, except for chest, keep the Tunic, and or banded and mail.  Butcherblock is also a great place to find Small Bronze selling cheaply, since it drops off skellys in Unrest to the south, and anyone fighting in UNrest eventually has to go back through BB to buy and sell.  Normal price is about 15-30 pp per peice, depending on which peice(the bigger, the more pp)  Also, keep your eye out for anyone selling a Bloodforge Helm, they are very rare, and worth between 100 and 200 pp, with a LOT of extra bonuses. Good Luck, fellow Dwarven Warrior, and may Brell be with you.<br><br>Khallim Bloodhelm<br>Dwarven Warrior of the 29th Campaign<br>Proud Member of the Acolytes Reborn<br>Tholuxe Paells<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
