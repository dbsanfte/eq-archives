I know an SK extremely well, but not any other class.<br><br>I recently have started bottin a Shaman friend from the same guild that I am in, but outside of the obvious things that they do, I have no clue what the hell I am doing.  =)  Im learning very quickly, but Im still totally wet behind the ears..<br><br>So, can you guys help me out a little?  <br><br>For instance:<br><br>1.  If I get agro, what is a SHM best defense?  Root?  Slow?  Heal?<br><br>2.  If adds come, what then becomes my best defense?  Should I aoe slow?  Should I heal the puller first?  Should I root adds?<br><br>3.  What are some really sweet spell combinations?<br><br>Any thoughts, including the questions above, woudl be greatly appreciated.<br><br>By the way, my SK and the SHM are both 61+ and geared very nicely if that helps in the analysis.<br><br>Thanks in advance,<br><br>Luna</p>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Aggro from maloxxx is next to nil, and a mob can be taunted off of you easy.  And when it's slowed, who cares if it's aggro'd you.<br>Granted I don't have the best hps in the world, but fully buffed at 3.5khps those neat little creepers and crocs in pon will eat me in no time if I fail to slow it, and after you prolly your cleric.<br>Actually was grouped with another 59 shammy today who got all upset when slow aggro got him whacked.  I told him to use malosini and he told me if the warrior was taunting he wouldnt have gotten aggro.  That has to be the stupidest thing I have ever heard anyone say.  As a shaman YOU should be the one deciding how much aggro you have.  About the only thing that can pull a po'd mob off me is a chanter casting tash, which is one of the reasons I specifically request them not to cast it unless they absolutely have to.<br>Always keep the &quot;not-quite-ch&quot; spell memmed.<br>Who knows when you gonna have a bad pull and the cleric has to chain cast ethereal light or some such to keep everyone alive.<br>As for DS potions...what's the point?<br>I mean, honestly...<br>Sure you get a lil xtra damage every few seconds but if you need that damage to kill the mobs you shouldn't be in pop.<br>Remember DS works best when the mobs are goin full speed and if you must have a ds then let the druid or mage or whatever handle that.<br>As far as canni-dancin well, you might want to stand a little longer in pop than you are used to in other zones because that 600-1k damage they did to you for that instant you sat lost you 320-500 or so mana that could have been harvested with can4.<br>Wait till the mob is below 2 bubs or so of life before you even think about sitting, and then just pop down and up to see if the mob will turn toward you.<br>Oh, and play in 3rd person as much as you can.<br>I know it's hard to get used to but you will eventually come to find first person too constrictive.<br>3rd person perspective let's you keep an eye on the whole picture and see those sneaky bastard mobs that like to hide under docks or come flyin off from god knows where.<br>I know I'm jumpin around here but bear with me.<br>Oh, and as for dotting/nuking well, we have some really crappy dps so if you want to help out keep nife memmed and summon your dog.<br>Doggy should be all you really use anyhow unless your group has crappy dps...our dots dont really scratch up the mobs all too bad in pop.<br>Save your extra mana for heals, and yes DO heal yourself if you got aggro and about to die.<br>Use that nice chloroblast spell, it has saved me on more than one occasion.<br>Your spells will not get interrupted all that much contrary to what one of the above posters said and chloro is fast.<br>Even faster if you smart enuf to have the cleric cast blessing of faith on you before you start fighting.<br>Sometimes that little heal is all the difference between that Ethereal Light hitting you and it hitting your corpse.<br>But don't run around, makes it hard for the tanks to taunt it off.<br>And so EVERYONE knows, PETS DONT BREAK MEZ!!!<br>I'll say it again...<br>PETS DON'T BREAK MEZ!!!<br>It was posted in one of the patch messages, and confirmed to me by a gm on my server, Povar.<br>If something is breaking mez it's either one of the idiot melee, a druid using their damage-inflicting root, or a necro's dot.<br>That little message we get that says, &quot;sorry master, I am unable to awaken TARGET&quot; means exactly that.<br>I'm so tired of some chanter doing a crappy job, or dumb melee breaking mez and tryin to pass it off as my pet's fault.<br>Stick to your guns and pay attention to the other people in your group.<br>Chances are one of them can't get out of their HHP mentality and own up to their stupid mistakes.<br>Ok I'm starting to ramble so /q.<br><br>Mephista<br>59 Shaman<br>Povar</p>&nbsp;<br>Mephista D`Monica<br>&lt;Stoic&gt;<br>Povar<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=617033" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=617033</a></td></tr>

First I will say that in some cases for a shaman getting aggro is the best defense/offense thing to do.<br><br>  Offensively for instance if the only melee in the group or still alive is a rogue you want the aggro so they can backstab. You can also offtank slowed mobs or pull off other casters if needed with a dot or a nuke or a slow if the mob isn't slowed yet. Obviously I don't suggest this unless you have a fairly decent ac/ hps vs the mobs attack. I usually only offtank casters who have broken mezz and been mana drained/used up their mana.<br> <br> When you slow it's not good to sit down sometimes in groups. So often if mana is good, it's ok to throw your spear or your hammer into the fray and take the risk of getting hit once or twice since you should have regen up anyway. If you are using bear form and tanking shrink yourself. You can also cast canni if your not getting aggro while you are tanking. This may sound suicidal but if you use a weapon like the howling harpoon the stun proc is worth the effort and you don't get much aggro. If you have or are using a decent damage output weapon like the epic, winterstorm or the rune etched ice wurm fang I suggest waiting a tick or two for the real tanks to get some decent aggro.<br><br>   Make a hotkey for mobs you dot they can't be mezzed if they are dotted this is to let the chanter know what to mezz and the tanks to know what to focus on. This also lets people know how you are using your mana and gives them a general idea of how tough the mob is.<br><br>    Pet kiting or pet + tank kiting is a good method to prevent people from getting hurt. I did a fair amount of hunting in burning woods with a warrior friend and this is how it usually went. If there were two mobs hitting him I would slow both dot one to get it's aggro and root it. If it broke root i would run it around until he was done, reroot it or tank it. If it was a named baddie like gorgul patlock that was an add or a problem due to mana I would get the aggro he would taunt it I would sit to get aggro back and gain mana and move before it hit me. He and the pet would attack it from behind, thus increasing our damage per second and decreasing its. This also works with a pet although not as well. <br><br>  As far as using root goes it's a judgement call on the situation if a mob is rooted it will keep hitting people or pets that are tanking it when otherwise it would turn and run. On the flipside, It also won't run off and bring friends to the party.<br><br>   Also good to know is that your char affects your resist chance of slows and dots etc. Always keep your charisma buffed on mobs you are getting resisted on. Our debuffs work as well as an enchanters but often their char is higher(affecting their ability to debuff) in the everyday situation because they are more charisma dependent than we are. With up to 6 mobs mezzed checking against your charisma every tick you'd want a high charisma too. So the best combo is to have them tash for the slows when neccessary(slow goes against mr even though it can be cured like a disease). I had a great crypt group last night where we did this against the emperor(lvl 60 mob) and it worked really well both of us lvl 54. If you know ahead of time that your gonna need it buy some straight charisma stuff. It's worth losing 100 or more out of your mana pool to be able to overcome one or more resists of a 250 mana turgurs.<br><br>  One other thing before I go hps are as valuable as wisdom/mana to shamans if not more so because they will keep you alive and allow you to be safer when you use your canni. It's worth losing 25 mana out of your pool for 50+ hps. This is the ratio of canni conversion which gets slightly better at each step up. It's great having a big pool for buffing a raid party, but in exp groups getting mana back is the key thing.<br><br>Ok enough now gotta run :-)<br><br>Arnoldofgaul<br>54 shaman erollisi marr</p>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

Why have a char buff in the first place if there wasn't an application for it in battle? Shamans also get +5 char at character generation, there has to be a reason for this. I know all about the hp/ac/resists stuff too I was attempting to cover subjects that weren't covered by other people. There is quite alot to know and yes it's debateable what kind of gear to get it depends what kinds of mobs you like to fight and how you like to play. Some shamans prefer wisdom over ac and mana in some cases because they do alot of tradeskills/spell casting, other shammies like to tank, some like to solo some do lots of raiding Personally I like experience grouping and going after mobs way over my lvl, that's why charsmia is important to me.

Unless your group is very tank heavy, your group STR, DEX, AGI, etc spells are a bit worthless. Everyone can use more HP and AGI for better AC if they get aggro, so use your group STA and group AGI spells for that. If you have encumbered groupmates ( ask them they may not know it ), then STR buff the group as well. If you cant afford the mana or dont have the spells, use JB buffs or the lower mana single target buffs. If theres no chanter make sure MT has celerity or better ( i know at some point 60+ we get 60% haste spell--if u have that use it--make sure pet has this spell as well and a STR buff--thats all Id put on pet unless soloing ).<br>  Ok to your first question, your best defense is to not get aggroed, easier said than done. WHEN you get aggro, if the mob isnt slowed by then either root it and back up or if you are in danger of dying run small circles around your party to stay in healing range and let them know you need a heal. If the mob IS slowed, then try backing off a bit and the MT ( main tank ) should be able to re-establish aggro fairly quickly. If it wont leave u alone, you may want to try a blind spell ( not reccommended ) or just root it. Use the level 5 root, with everyone wailing on the mob, pet and DoT/DD damage it wont last long but will buy you some time. Never try to heal yourself while an unslowed mob is beating on you, they take too long and will most likely be interrupted and you will die, especially on level 45+ mobs. You should cast Turgurs First unless the mob is really high MR or level 58+, then cast Malo or Malosini ( have both loaded ) depending on what spells you have.<br>2. If adds come your puller isnt doing the best of job or isnt the rigfht class, but sometimes you dont get theperfect group makeup. Chanter should be main crowd control, mezzing adds. Tigirs Insects is the AoE slow you refer to is only a 50% slow but I believe has a hate reduction factor in the spell too, but if there are enough mobs to use that spell you better be evaccing out of there or your party is trashed. Maybe use it to buy the wiz/dru a few secs to get off a evac. If the adds arent real close to each other or the party yet, root may be the best option, however in that case you want to use your best root. Its best to have a chanter for crowd control as even ONE add in a zone like Plane of Nightmares will rip a caster party a new one quick. We had a full group last night I was the lowest at 56 and MT was a 64 BL. At 61 druids ahve a better 75% CH than we do, but if no druids are there definately have that spell loaded. Note you will almost require a cleric and a enchanter for some of the mobs here.<br>3. The way I fight in groups like that is I have loaded chloroblast, group regrowth,cannibalize 3 ( or 4 in your case ), buff slot, buff slot, malosi ( or malo or malosini in your case ), root, and Turgurs. Turgurs landed alot more often than malosi did on mobs I was fighting last night and usually this is the case, chanters wont always tash at first as the have to deal with mez aggro and have crap HP--they will ALWAYS want you to slow--as soon as the MT has picked a target, /assist him and slow that mob asap. Mobs usually dont come after you unless you fail to land a slow or 2 then cast again and slow them.<br>If you can get Malosinia ( -70 to all resists except disease ) use that and Malo to debuff real high level mobs , casting malo first of course.<br>      Dont waste mana with DoTs or DD, just about every other class can out do us there and if you get resists on slow and maloxxx you will eat mana quick if your party is pulling at a good rate. Send in pet once MT has engaged mob and its slowed. After you maloxxx it then JBB blast it if u have one, and cannibalize inbetween JBB blasts to recover mana. <br>   If you dont have any AA yet Id reccomend the following--hp regen 3, mental clarity 3, mass cannibalize, and if you raid alot mass group buff. Also run speed one is good if you get dispelled and need to make it to a zone line ( or switch out your boots for epic boots--instant cast SoW ). Keep regen and greater bearform on, at level 56 I have 25 hp regen/tick self buffed--iksar and troll shaman will have alot more--thats more mana for you. Get an iksar BP of Fungi tunic for more HP regen too if you can afford/find them<br><br>   Miscellaneous thoughts--always keep a few Kilvas Skine of Flame DS potions on you--they stack with druid or mage DS, cleric reverse DS and bard song too as well as coldain ring DS I think--our MT last night had a 76 hp DS on that gave him 15 hp back every time the mob hit him. Every bit of offense helps and at level 60+ the potions last a long time--like 15-16 minutes and are atleast a 31 hp DS. <br>    Keep an eye on your cleric and especially chanter--they can get aggro fast and an unslowed mob will tear them a new one quick--if they have aggro start casting heals even if their HP arent dropping--they will be very soon very fast. <br>   I make hotkeys for the following : JBB, attack, /pet attack, /pet guard me, /pet back off, %t has been slowed, %t has been malosied, and varios gear that casts effects ( like my cure disease and cure poison earrings--saves me a buff slot). I have several more but those get used the most. Solo, buff the pet with all the best buffs you have, in a group just haste and STR, and in a raid ask if they want you to have a pet up. <br>   When I solo I go to places like SF where JBB as its cold DD almost alwasys hits even unbuffed level 48-52 mobs full damage every time. I stack Bane of Nife and E-bolt and then let mob chase me until pet gets back aggro ( I almost always have pet taunting on ), cause now DoTs do full damage even when mobs are chasing you. <br>    Never use the cripple line unless its an epic fight where that 1% reduction in mob effectiveness may make or break the fight--I never see any difference on short fights to justify the mana.<br>     Big thing for shaman too is know what mobs are unslowable, and what mobs can only be disease-slowed ( Plague of Insects and the new PoP one )--if u have to use them use insideous decay to debuff their DR--its 1.0 sec cast time and unresistable.<br>     Shaman can melee to with the right gear but only in real limited situatuions. I will step in and take hits if my pets at like 10% life and the mob is nearly dead so he will hit me and not kill the pet which is nearly 2000 mana in remaking/rebuffing pet. Our pets can solo light blue mobs at 56 provided the pet is fully buffed and the mob is Turgur's slowed. Throw in a few JBB blasts if you have it and he can solo low blues with no mana loss from you.<br>     Well hope that helps some if you need anything else please post.<br><br>56 Ogre Luminary on Luclin Server--Chaotic Winds--Baron Aggrok</p>&nbsp;<br>64 Ogre Oracle on Luclin Server--Venerable Aggrok</td></tr>

Not getting aggro - Usually I hit the mob with a malo at the beginning of the fight.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's very low aggro, and if it sticks, you probably won't have a problem landing slow.  Regardless, if the mob does resist, unless it has pretty high MR, I just cast Turgur's next.  Not doing so would be a waste of the cleric's mana, because around the 50's things hit hard, and your slow is 70% or more.<br><br>Sometimes this will still get you aggro, even though there's been some time for the tanks to taunt.  If I get aggro, I usually sit still long enough to get the mob taunted off me. (I was trained not to run away a long time ago by an enchanter friend, hehe.)  Running away will usually just create a chase, and it's much harder to taunt while your target is running away.  If slow landed and caused aggro, you usually have 5 or 10 seconds before you get hit anyway.  If not, I'll try to root and back off.<br><br>2. Healing - I have Chloroblast, but I don't usually keep it loaded unless I'm in a group without a cleric.  It doesn't heal as much as Superior, but has a faster casting time, making it a &quot;critical moment&quot; type heal.<br><br>If you're with a cleric, you probably won't have to worry about healing.  When clerics use their Complete Heal macro, you might throw a Superior Heal on if the target is still taking heavy damage.<br><br>And yea, start healing the cleric and especially the enchanter as soon as they start getting hit.  Enchanters can die before a heal goes off, so as soon as you see their life going down, heal them.<br><br>3 Spell lineup - Grouped and solo, my slots are pretty much the same, only a few trivials switched out.  In a group, my lineup is usually Superior Healing, Frost Strike (if there's an enchanter) / Bane of Nife (if there isn't), Malosi, Root (Paralyzing Earth, but yea), Chloroblast, Turgur's, Cannibalize III, group Regrowth.  Although I keep a DoT or DD up most of the time, I barely ever cast them, unless I have C3.<br><br>4. DoT's - If there's an enchanter, never DoT.  Ever.  DoT's make mesmerizing impossible, which is bad.  If something can't be mezzed because you dotted it, people will probably be angry with you.<br><br>5. Buffing - I believe that a fully buffed party is more effective than halfway.  Harnessing of Spirit is pretty mana-heavy, but the combined 50 str/dex is worth it in my opinion.  Strength probably only makes a marginal difference in damage later in the game, but dexterity will help people to proc their weapons more often.  (I was in a group once with two monks who had T-Staff's and 200+ dex; the amount of proccing was ridiculous lol.)  Give everyone agility; it helps dodge attacks.  I've had more than one enchanter comment on how my agility buff probably saved him from the angry mob.  Stamina, I usually only cast on the tanks and myself (so I have more health to eat).  And don't forget haste if there's no enchanters...your tanks won't.<br><br>Eh, I've said enough I think lol.  I hope that helps someone.<br><br>Xahra<br>56 Iksar Shaman<br>Luclin<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=143058" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=143058</a></p>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I know like Gullerback in Burning Woods cant be Turgurs slowed but diseease slowed only. If the mob is on you and not slowed let the cleric know and/or run circles around the group  to get a heal.<br>    In a small group, I still never use DD, maybe a Bane of Nife if there are other shaman/enchnaters to haste / slow.<br>  The message about mobs getting full damage from DoTs came out a month or 2 ago AFAIK. Mobs have always taken full damage while rooted or feared but not chasing you. Now it doesnt matter if they are feared, rooted or chasing you the DoT doed the same damage<br><br><br>56 Ogre Luminary on Luclin server--Chaotic Winds--Baron Aggrok<br><br><br></p>&nbsp;<br>64 Ogre Oracle on Luclin Server--Venerable Aggrok</td></tr>

At your level, you can slow by 75%, thus cutting their damage output down to 1/4.   I haven't gotten AoE slow yet, but I'd worry that it would draw aggro toward me (yes, I am totally open to others' experience here).  I generally single slow the MoB the main is working on, and any MEZZED adds (if you are lucky enough to have an enchanter in the group).  If you have no mezzer, then slow each mob, but be ready to root and move.<br><br>If magic resistance is a problem, you can Malo (unresistable resistance debuff), or even better, if you have an enchanter to Tash, use Malosini.  It's resistable, but debuffs for more.<br><br>If there is no Cleric, Complete (75%) Heal the main tank when they get ot about half health.<br><br>When I get aggroed, I root and back up. I also try to use root to keep mobs away form people, but slowing is MUCH easier, and lasts longer.<br>Once the mobs are slowed, if you have mana to spare, you might toss some debuffs on the mobs, makes them easier to hit, etc.  These spells are underused IMHO.<br><br>Basically, a Shaman is so versatile, he can easily use up all his mana in two or three pulls if he does &quot;all of the above&quot;.  If mana conservation is important (as it almost always is) just focus on the slowing, you've got the BEST slow spell in the game.  Keep root up for self defense.  <br><br>Also, keep a Regeneration spell on you and do the &quot;Mana dance&quot; - Stand, Cannibalize, sit, repeat.  A hotkey is good for this:<br><br>/stand<br>/cast 1 (I keep Cannibalize in slot 1)<br>/pause 15 (or one more than the spell cast time)<br>/sit<br><br>Your tactics change depening on who's in the group with you.  If you've got a Druid, let him ROOT and DoT.  If you've got an Enchanter, let her Haste.  If you've got a Cleric, let him heal.  Try to balance mana useage among all the casters, so one of you isn't always the one who's OOM.<br>These are based on my experiences up to lvl 54.  Hope it's useful.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Nov  8 14:15:16 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br>______________________________________<br><b>Dargadin, Barbarian Shaman of the 61st Season</b><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=494767" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=494767</a><br><b><span style='color: red;'>Lost Fires</span style='color: red;'><br>Ayonae Ro Server</b><br></td></tr>
