You talk about taking out yellow cons, then you obviously lay waste to even cons and just destroy blue cons. That's not how the game was designed. All those players out there playing a rogue the &quot;hard way&quot; (read, the way it was intended) have that many fewer kills now. If you twink yourself out (and by that I mean several VERY high items) you unfairly monopolize kills and thus make things harder and less fun for others.<br><br>Secondly, why would a player ask for other players' opinions, and then attack those players for having those opinions? &quot;Methinks thou dost protest too much&quot; In other words, I wonder if you don't agree with us maybe.<br><br>However, I hate to say it, in the end, YOU are the one paying for YOUR game. Which means, play it anyway you want so you can have fun .... I know that's what I do.</p>&nbsp;<br>Restyn<br>Rogue of Saryrn Server<br>51 Seasons</td></td></tr>

I have started characters thru level 20 with no twinking, however.<br><br>It should be said that to twink a character involves first getting a main character into the high levels of the game (unless you're given all your stuff by a friend)  I personally have no opinion on the matter.  When I get my Rogue up real high in level, I'm sure as hell gonna pass my stuff down to a new character and beat it down.<br><br>Everyone should play the game one time thru and figure out how it all works.  Twinking wears out once you hit about level 40 anyway (unless you have a LOT of money) SO WHY NOT TWINK?!<br><br>I for one am saving all the Ravenscale armor I've had and will pass it on to my cousin in the future, he wants to make a rogue, and in return, he wants to pass onto me some caster items because I want to make a necro.

I went ahead and kept the stuff I paid for the paladin/rogue and put them on mules and/or sold them (kept what I planned on using at later more adequate levels).  I spent around 20k on the rogue which is FAR less than what I could have but it gives the game far more &quot;flavor&quot;.  It leaves room for improvement around the mid 20's to 40's and keeps me looking forward to something.  Sure some might say that becuase I wear SCHW on him at lvl 12 he's still &quot;too twinked&quot;... well hey at least I'm not walking around with full halfling cultural or something.  I made myself some haze black panther skin (after aquiring quite a bit of supplies) and tried it out... still made things too easy and I put the fungi tunic back on my mule (I use one on my monk as well, figured the fungi would come in use on raids 50+) so right now he only has I'd say about half of his slots filled.  Sure other people still know I'm a twink but by far its not enough to make the biggest difference in the world.  I recently saw a monk (friend of mine) who had some of the gear on him at lvl 14 that my lvl 60 wears.. blew my mind.  (my dual wield setup is Goranga spiked club and SoS) and here he is at lvl 14 walking around with both.  I didn't mind, sure it made the whole soloing aspect of monks a lot easier for him (he paid me to make him full BPS).  I would also like to add that I created an enchanter, beastlord, and wizard and have them all to mid 20's to mid 40's and didn't even put a single piece of equipment on them.  Also I would like to ask you, have any of you ever recieved an item of any kind from a higher lvl player when you were lower lvl? a lot of people that think twinking is bad have actually twinked without knowing it.  If a high lvl gives you an item too high for your level regardless of what item it is and how hard it is to get IT MAKES YOU A TWINK.  I mean ... think about it... if you have items that you shouldn't have at your level technically a twink so for the people who think twinking is bad just think of that.  Anywayz the game has become definitely more dificult now that I can't solo yellows etc. but hey it's more fun and keeps my free time flying by.  So I hope this will be the final word on the whole twinking topic ... pretty sure it won't be though.</p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

I haven't had more than friggin 2k my entire EQ career! And I sure as hell have had a blast playing my rogue this far. I just can't understand why someone would want to twink a new character as much as possible. It's like playing through Starcraft with the cheat codes on (anyone else been there?)...it's just mindless eye candy with no challenges and no mental stimulation. You just veggify your brain while wasting hours of valuable time. You even have a good argument against twinking in your post.<br><br>Quote: &quot;I made a paladin and twinked him with about 200k-300k worth of stuff... round his mid 20's I got tired of playing him...&quot;<br><br>Hmm I wonder why you could possibly got tired of playing him? Because twinking makes the game less fun, which is exactly what you said. Then you &quot;cut down&quot; to only 20k, which still makes me extremely sick that you would try to pass that off as not much. You found that it's more fun with only 20k as opposed to 100k, but why did you even give that much? Logically, you would find the most fun in starting from nothing, or at least less than 1k.<br><br>And about someone giving you an item for free making you a twink, that is absolute bull. Someone gave my level 2 paladin a full set of banded and an axe of the iron back. You would call that twinking!? That's barely 100pp in today's market. Sure if someone gave my new rogue a full set of mrylokar's and a trak tooth, THAT would be twinking. But who in their right mind would give me all that but myself? Even if someone else would give me that, it's still a choice whether I should use it or not, and it comes down to the same ethics as twinking yourself.<br></p>&nbsp;<br>Daviv McD (Un-retired!)<br>36th Dwarf Rogue<br>Fury Fighters<br>Xegony<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13233" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13233</a></td></td></tr>

Anyway your analogy doesn't really fit. A more appropriate analogy would be me being jealous of a millionaire's son who's completely financially supported and surrounded by luxury his whole life, and doesn't have to really do much work at all. Even then, the son would have to actually be the millionaire reincarnated into a child's body, but he can still transfer back and forth between his former self...screw analogies, why don't we just talk about the topic itself?<br><br>I am not arguing against twinking because I'm jealous. That wouldn't even make sense if I tried to...&quot;You shouldn't twink because it makes the game less challenging and less fun, so uh..yeah I'm jealous of you because you missed out on all that fun and I have to sit here and enjoy it!!&quot; Go back and READ the whole of my post; I'll retype my points here as well. First I showed my distaste for his quote about 100k. It doesn't make me sick because I wish I had his 100k, but because it's just ridiculous that someone would think 100k is not too much to give a LEVEL 1 CHARACTER. Like I said I've played up to level 32 by myself, never seen more than 2k, and I've had plenty of fun. I cannot mentally comprehend why someone would think they needed 100k to START OFF.<br><br>Next I related EQ to Starcraft. Twinking is a little bit like using the cheat codes. You kill things faster, you take less damage, you have an overall much better chance of beating the game. Also, near the end of the game it still takes a lot of work to finish missions with one or two cheat codes on, just like the usefullness of twinking wears off as you get higher level.<br><br>Then I pointed out he had an argument against twinking in his own post. This relates back to the fact that you simply enjoy the game less the more you twink.<br><br>The next part I like. When cornered with a good argument, some people try to use that argument against the other person, instead of simply defending against it. In this case, I and others were arguing that twinking is bad. Instead of trying to convince us that twinking wasn't bad, he pointed his finger at us and said everyone twinks. I say it again, that's bull. Does he really think that giving a newb a set of banded is just as bad as giving yourself 100k worth of stuff? Giving someone else stuff at least spreads the wealth a little. And uh, I can really just make a character on seventh hammer and ask a few people for uber lewt and they really WILL give me stuff instead of /ignore me? Hmmph, he gave a level 47 some froggy robe, wow. Someone please check my math, but 47 is 46 away from 1, which is the level you start at. I don't know how much this frog robe of yours is worth, but at level 47 I'm sure he could have afforded to buy it himself. You can't really have any 45+ twinks, unless your guild manages to let him loot some awesome nodrop armor from 65+ mobs.<br><br>Finally, I said this somewhere but I'll say it again. If you need to twink to have fun, maybe you should find a different game than EQ. You realize you're paying up to $12 a month for a game you can't even enjoy playing the way it was meant to be played? Or at least your parents are. Oh and one more point: the economy in EQ is extremely screwed up. I believe it gets screwed up most by new expansions and the introduction of better yet easier to get equipment, and second by twinking. Ever heard of deflation? If plat and equipment is always created, never destroyed, then eventually everything will be dirt cheap and newbies will be able to buy uber stuff themselves, so you won't even be able to twink anymore. The only thing keeping that from happening are NPC merchants and retiring PCs. That's one reason I'm looking forward to World of Warcraft; Blizzard is no fool at gaming and will find a great way to keep the economy up.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Mon Jul&nbsp;&nbsp;8 19:22:58 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Daviv McD (Un-retired!)<br>36th Dwarf Rogue<br>Fury Fighters<br>Xegony<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13233" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13233</a></td></td></tr>

I mean if it has no point in the end then why the big fuss daviv? and starcraft can't even compare to EQ. &quot;you have an overall much better chance of beating the game.&quot; err its called everquest for a reason... think about it E-V-E-R-Q-U-E-S-T on top of this if I pay that 12 dollars a month I have every right to twink... just makes me lvl faster and makes more use of the time I'm paying for.  And as for making blizzard look like some kind of &quot;god&quot; of PC games you're not even close.  D2 was hella @#%^ed over cause blizz was too damn lazy to do anything about hackers.  Sure this problem will most likely not be prevalent in WoW but none the less give WoW the time and audience that EQ has had and just watch unless they do what D2 did (lvl restrictions on items) then people will continue to twink. On top of that people still twink with lvl restrictions they give themselves good stuff they can use at low lvls, get themselves PL'd and then they use the good stuff they got to twink themselves with. when it comes down to it you're arguing over something thats not gonna end.  Hey you can twink too once you take the TIME the WORK and the PATIENCE to get two characters to lvl 60 and get them at least 45AA points each on both.  Until then don't tell me that twinking is rediculous cause it isn't its one thing ... OWED</p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

And the fact that I didn't even completely twink my rogue doesn't mean I lay waste to stuff.  Hell I can't even take 2+ dark blues and having to sit down and rest up after fighting a white or two doesn't really qualify as a hella twink.  I'm having just as much fun as when I started my other 2 characters and at the same time I'm not worried about being flushed with questing.  I went ahead and did all the slickfingers stuff which gave me a few hours of good questing.  On top of that just recently I saw a guy who paid for a bunch of MQ thurg items for his new character now THATS a helluva twink job and I COUILD do that the fact that I don't means I don't take enjoyment from doing that.  SO if you think just becuase I twink a little its made the game SOOOOO easy... sorry to tell you you're wrong.  Fact of the matter is I don't have it much easier than rogues my own level.  So for you to sit here and say that I'm just doing the same thing even though I didn't spend as much money is completely rediculous.  if ya don't believe me check it out for yourself.  the difference isn't big enough.  Anyways I respect all of your opinions and thank you all... fact of the matter is some of you don't like twinking (for whatever reason) and I really don't mind it, keeps me busy and leaves me with not quite as many CR's as I'd care to do. So thats that, and to the people who think ALL characters should be made from scratch more power to you, but hey I've spent enough time and money on this game to twink as I feel necessary =) well whatever as long as you have fun it really don't matter what you do to play the game.  I'm having a blast and I'm lvl 24 now (thank god for the PC zone exp.) and for any of you think that &quot;I'm not as good or experienced as a rogue who started from scratch&quot; hey whatever you want to think is good for you but if you think me less experienced for twinking a bit, whatever lol twinking doesn't mean you can't learn simply put.  Anyways once again thanks everyone and be safe. </p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

Ummm well, you wanna know something, IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH YOU TWINK CUZ AT 50+ YOU STILL AINT GONNA BE ABLE TO SOLO A BLUE!  Hell I have to use my disciplines most often to take down a light blue, or sometimes even get owned by some green mobs.  While I do respect some of the knowledge you know of the class not all of us want to play OUR game this way.  And while I understand you are not as fully knowledged in the &quot;high end game,&quot;  perhaps you should take a step back and examine that angle of EQ.  Having uber gear is pretty much the goal of the game.  The better your gear is the better you help your group/guild, the more you help them, the more you can do.  You just arent going to see a guild go straight from wearing fine plate to warlords, you have to go through steps in armor.  And as I am sure you realize this what does it really matter if you just skip a bunch of steps if you plan to play your character to 60 asap anyways?  Really and truly twinked characters can easily PL entire groups just by the awesome dmg output they have because they have gear that boosts their stats enough to where something blue is trivial.  To me it seems until you have played all aspects of the game you should stick to talking about what you know &gt;&lt;<br> </p>&nbsp;<br>~Tactikal Mizkalculation~&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>65 Deciever <br>Vazaelle<br></td></td></tr>

To get &quot;uber&quot; gear? Well, if you wanna pay $12 a month just so you can work day and night on a character that doesn't exist, so you can collect fabulous and powerful treasure that doesn't exist, be my guest. In my opinion, the only thing that makes EQ worth playing and worth paying is the fact that you're playing with thousands of other usually friendly people. If you don't agree, think about the last time you talked to anyone, grouped with anyone, done a deal with anyone, saw anyone, heard anyone, or got any money or equipment you didn't loot from a mob you soloed or received from a quest. Now erase all those moments and think where you would be now if EQ was a single player game. So don't act like it's a single player game. The point of the game, and any game, is to HAVE FUN, not to beat it. Jeez, you can't even beat EQ, so why would the &quot;goal&quot; be to get uber equipment?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I sorta chuckle at your childish insult of &quot;the lowbies&quot;. Now I know who it really is that camps orc camps with his level 59 and when the lower levels complain you say &quot;I own you, stupid noobs! I am one lewt dewd!!!&quot; Do you realize that there are real people playing those characters, and that one of those newbs could already have 3 level 60s, or maybe that one of those real people could be smarter, wiser, and/or more worthy of respect than you? The highest level and uberest characters in EQ are played by people who spend so much time in EQ that they have no real life. I've been playing EQ for over a year and a half, and I only have a level 32 with crappy equipment to show for it. I don't care that I'm not level 60 with uber stuff yet because I don't need phat lewt to have fun, and at the same time I played EQ I've managed to keep my real life in better shape than it's ever been before.<br><br>Quote: &quot;To me it seems until you have played all aspects of the game you should stick to talking about what you know&quot;<br><br>I AM sticking to what I know: the low to mid-end game. All my arguments are why you shouldn't twink AT LOW LEVELS. I don't give a crap what the end-game is like because a) That's not all there is to the game, b) No end to the game actually exists, and c) Many if not most people will never even see the &quot;end&quot;-game, like me.<br><br>That is the major problem with EQ. It absolutely does NOT cater to the casal player; just to the hard-core, middle-aged, lives in his parents' basement player. The casual player is caught up in the excitement of EQ, but as they continue to play they must either devote more of their life to EQ and less to real life, or just get frustrated and stop playing. I fall into this second category. I haven't played EQ in 3 months, and I don't miss it. I'm looking forward to WoW mainly cuz Blizzard (IMHO the greatest game company ever) is gonna take all the MMORPG's, take the good stuff, fix the bad stuff, and add in their own originality into it.<br><br>Sorry I go off topic a lot but a word about Blizzard: Why do people criticize Blizzard so much about hackers? They ship out an excellent game for a one-time price, and throw in Battle.net for free. Battle.net automatically updates your game to the latest version, protects against hackers (not complete protection but a lot better than you think), and is one of the best utilities for chatting and guilding and grouping and playing in an easy and user-friendly manner, all FOR FREE. If you can give me an example of any other best-selling multiplayer games out there that isn't a victim of hackers, please let me know. Oh and MMORPG's like EQ DON'T count. First of all everything you could possibly alter to cheat is on Verant's computers, not your own. It's one thing to take a hex editor and change a couple numbers in a character file on your computer, but it's infinitely harder to do the same to a file on a highly secure network without being detected. Second, there is a monthly fee to play MMORPG's, which is what funds the security that keeps their files safe. Now if idiots using hacks they downloaded off the internet is the only thing that makes you decide you don't like Blizzard, then what'll happen when Blizzard eliminates the hacker factor? The greatest game for years to come, I hope.</p>&nbsp;<br>Daviv McD (Un-retired!)<br>36th Dwarf Rogue<br>Fury Fighters<br>Xegony<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13233" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13233</a></td></td></tr>

Now I am sure you probably dont understand this but YOU CANT SOLO FOR GEAR FOR A CHARACTER OF YOUR OWN LEVEL AS A ROGUE!  There is not one item I have on my character that I didnt group with others and win the roll on, get awarded on a raid, or get from selling other gear i didnt want (aquired by afore mentioned methods).  Now I realize something uber to you like say a giant snake fang could be soloed, however for those of us who play the game in order to kill everything possible you are going to need better gear than that, and that is going to take being in a guild and raiding, or lots and lots of playtime in groups (with lots of luck on rolls) so you can make the plat to buy the really cool stuff.<br><br>If you have been playing for a year and a half and are only lvl 32, perhaps you should try another game more suited to your playstyle or gaming habits.  Try Tetris and work your way up from there.<br><br>&quot;That is the major problem with EQ.  It absolutely does NOT cater to the casual player, just to the hard-core, middle-aged, lives in his parents' basement player&quot;<br><br>HAHA I only live at 13 time zones from my parents basement. And you really dont have to devote more of your time to EQ vice RL, you just have to make friends, and play with them as you level.  If you haven't played in 3 months and don't miss it then why the hell do you keep coming in here and posting about it?<br><br>There are cheats for EQ ... try showeq for example, shows you every mob in the zone its lvl and  hps as well as a completely detailed map of the zone, of course you must have known about that though with all the information you have aquired on a game that you haven't played in a while and dont miss.  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>&nbsp;<br>~Tactikal Mizkalculation~&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>65 Deciever <br>Vazaelle<br></td></td></tr>

So, I will continue to suggest not twinking.  <br><br>Anyway, having run a necro or monk or ranger or whatever to level 60 does not mean you know the strategies for correctly playing a rogue.  By twinking you lose out on those lessons early on. So, when the time comes that you need certain knowledge and experience you don't have it.<br><br>If you really feel you must twink then do it. I won't hate you (at least not for that reason). I really suggest that you limit twinking to a basic level. Its one thing to put high teens gear on a new character; even I do that.

His pets aren't any stronger than any other lvl 16 mage's pets and I can maybe get 2-3 more nukes off than I could without being twinked. The only real advantage is his ac for his lvl.

Actually, no not at all. Working your way up to 47 on your own and getting equivalent level 47 armor is nothing at all like taking a 60 you already have and camping easy green mobs until you have sufficient twink equipment. If you meant that they had to go through getting their 60 to 60 (and their 57 to 57 in this case as well), that doesn't even apply. Unless the only point they made a lvl 60 character was JUST so they could twink a new char, and that would be pretty daft.<br><br>I'm not saying people shouldn't have a right to twink, but it just doesn't make sense that someone who has enough time to get a level 60 and 57 would be so impatient in getting yet another character up to 60. I guess this is one way you can tell Verant truly is getting people addicted to their game. I mean, most games you just beat, maybe a few times, and throw it on the shelf. With EQ, even when you get to the highest level, there's still a whole freaking lot to do. And you see people amassing as many level 60's as they can even when they haven't done everything they could with any one of them. The only reason I would ever make a new character is if I felt I could have more fun with it. And indeed lately I've made a few new characters (monk, necro, and of course another rogue) and got them to 10 with absolutely NO outside help (which includes self-help a.k.a. twinking), just to see how fun each was compared to the others.<br><br>My final statement: If you've gotta twink to have fun, maybe you should start looking for a cheaper game, or at least a better one. *cough* World of Warcraft!! *cough*<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Sun Jun 30 20:46:08 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Daviv McD (Un-retired!)<br>36th Dwarf Rogue<br>Fury Fighters<br>Xegony<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13233" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13233</a></td></td></tr>

In a group in Sebilis you can easily make 500pp just off cash/cash gems alone, now add in winning a role on say a Hierophants Cloak (about 10k or so on my server), a good day in my book.  Well, as you may or may not know, it can can sometimes be extremely difficult to find a group as one of a bazillion 60 rogues sitting around lfg, sometimes you get bored and want to play a character you can just solo, or find a group in well populated zones.  And why would i want to be playing a monk in wu's armor wielding a springwood club wehn i could be wearing a fungi with a sos? Hmm difficult choice.  <br><br>It has been my experience that those who bitch about twinking are usually people newer to EQ who havent put in the time in order to attain a character equiped to there liking, and are usually jealous of people  who have.<br><br>Coincedentally I am still trying to fully equip my rogue, and re-equip my paly i stripped when i made my rogue.  I did however take some items i have won in xp groups, and a couple i bought and made a gimpy monk i like to play sometimes.  <br><br>My rogue is pretty well equiped with some ToV armor pieces and such, but my gear ranges from Uber (ToV BP), to super gimp ( cougar claw earrings).  So, while I am still striving to get more equipment for my own character please note there are some out there who have done this and are still playing getting uber items and dont need em for there main characters.  As for me I will still be saving to buy my lodizal shield and silver chitin bracer that i want.  After trading away most of my monks gear for seb croaking dirk, selling my guard captains mallet, buying a silver chitin bracer, and then trading the bracer and dirk for a crescent blades of luclin I have 2k to my name ... so only 40k to go, unless i get lucky and catch lodizal. <br><br>Oh well guess i will get off my soap box, sorry watching a movie while i type this.  oh yea, and as far as pick pocketing Tani, I have hear tale of a way that you can target him, and go to a room above which is uninhabited and pick pocket him that way.  I personally just walked up behind him made 2 attempts and got it, not before needing a rez cuz i didnt realize i would be KoS in Neriak.  One reason that you may be KoS is your deity btw, no matter what form you are in.<br><br></p>&nbsp;<br>~Tactikal Mizkalculation~&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>65 Deciever <br>Vazaelle<br></td></td></tr>
