	   <tr><td colspan=2>Enchanters are not really known to be a solo class, but they can get away with soloing with the charm line.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, many of their spells and abilities work the best in group situations.  Some examples: clarity line helps all group members and allows faster pulling.  Haste helps your tanks kill faster and hence take less damage, which again allows faster pulling.  The mez line is most useful in groups since that is most likely the situation where you'll encounter more than one beast at a time.<br><br>For soloing, again charm is your greatest asset if you ask me.  Charm soloing is fun, challenging, and can be rewarding, but I don't know of any enchanters who have strictly or even mostly soloed throughout their career.  Some other helpful charm soloing spells are the slow line, nukes, and to a lesser extent your DoTs.<br><br>There's the slightly long answer.  The short answer, in my opinion, would be that enchanters are best suited to group situations but can also solo effectively in certain situations.  Personally, I would say I group 90% of the time and solo mainly for a break from the grind, for some added excitement, and to keep all of my skills up to snuff.<br><br>have fun,<br><br>-Yizz<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>There is no one best race for enchanters or any class really.&nbsp;&nbsp;They all have their unique skills and defincicies.  That being said, I'll run down the list of 'Enchanterable' races and do a quick comparison.  Before that, though, I'll list in order what stats I believe to be most important to the class:<br><br>1)INT - Of course, more intelligence = more mana at each level.  As enchanters are a pure INT caster class, the importance of mana is hard to argue with.<br><br>2)CHA - Enchanters are unique in their charisma-based spells such as the charm and mezz line.  These are both pretty crucial skills to the clas and as such I would put CHA as the number 2 stat.<br><br>3)STA - Enchanters quite possibly take the most aggro of all caster classes when trying to get hairy situations under control.  STA adds to the number of hitpoints you get at every level.  Obviously, with more HP you can take more hits.  So, I put this stat at number 3.<br><br>4)STR - A large frustration I have found with the class is the inability to carry much loot after you have all of your gear equipped and on your person.  For this reason alone, I favor STR as the number 4 stat.<br><br>OK, with this order in mind I'll compare each race as far as stats and abilities go:<br><br>Dark Elf - INT 109, CHA 70, STA 65, STR 60.  Inkies start with good INT but the lowest CHA.  STA is also the lowest, and STR is average.<br><br>Advantages:  DEs can see at night with ultravision from the start.  Enchanters get vision enhancing spells which make this only a minor advantage.  I like that DEs start close to the center of Norrath, and as an agnostic enchanter can get into many cities from the beginning.  Again, though, faction is a minor issue to enchanters who get many spells to get them into otherwise hostile territory.<br><br>Disadvantages:  DEs are considered an evil race which may deter some players.  Their starting CHA is pretty stinky as well.<br><br>Erudite - INT 117, CHA 80, STA 70, STR 60.  Erudites start with the highest INT and second highest CHA scores.  Their STA and STR are also both decent.<br><br>Advantages:  Like already said, they get some really good starting stats to begin with.  Their starting faction is also pretty decent with many cities and races.<br><br>Disadvantages:  Erudites have no night vision to begin with, but again this will quickly change with spells.  Their starting area really sucks if you ask me too.<br><br>Gnome - INT 108, CHA 70, STA 70, STR 60.  Gnomes have good starting INT but tie for the lowest starting CHA with DEs.  Their STA and STR are both average.<br><br>Advantages:  Gnomes have one of the best and most uncrowded newbie zones in the game if you ask me.  Plus, they just look cool and I hear they get all the chicks.<br><br>Disadvantages:  Gnomes have low CHA which may be tough to deal with.  Also, some people may not like starting in such a tucked away corner of Norrath.<br><br>High Elf - INT 102, CHA 90, STA 65, STR 55.  HEs have good INT, and the highest of all CHA.  STA and STR, however, are both very low.<br><br>Advantages:  HEs have excellent starting core stats (INT and CHA) for Enchanters.  They start in a decent area of the world also.<br><br>Disadvantages:  Personally, I really don't like the look or the 'goody-goody' reputation of HEs.  Also, the low STA and STR could be a nuisance.<br><br>Humans - INT 85, CHA 85, STA 75, STR 75.  Humans have the lowest INT, good CHA, and the highest STA and STR.<br><br>Advantages:  Humans can start in Freeport (also in Qeynos I believe but I would rather start in FP) which is a good place to grow up.  Despite the low INT, they are the most 'balanced' race with decent stats everywhere else.<br><br>Disadvantages:  Humans also have no form of night vision to start with.  Of course, the low INT may be a factor as well.  Also, I personally think they are ugly.<br><br>Well, there you have it.  Keep in mind this is by no means a comprehensive comparison nor is it all objective.  Much of it has to do with personal opinion.  The bottom line, decide what's most important to you how you want to play the game and decide based on that what race you will play.  Any race can make an excellent enchanter with all the gear available out there.  The most crucial factor is the ability of the player behind the character.<br><br>Most importantly, have fun!<br><br>-Yizz<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

And yes grouping with my gnomish mage friend he gets a noticiable XP boost over me. Oh and 3.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have heard that this is a relatively rare spell to have for enchanters.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know if it is because the pages themselves are that rare or simply because players lose interest in hunting them down after a few levels.  Whatever the case is, it is still one of the few spells still missing from my book.<br><br>With that said, I have come up with several suggestions that say to hunt in the Kunark zones (Frontier Mountains, Warslik's Woods, Dalnir, and possibly Firiona Vie) in addition to checking all of the vendors in these and other Kunark zones.<br><br>Best of luck to you in your hunt.  If you do come across a good source for these pages, I know that I for one would like to hear about it.  So, post a reply if you find the 'gold mine'.<br><br>-Yizzelar<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>At level 12 you'll run into a lot of people new to the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, many, if not most, of them will not know what an enchanter is for yet.  There's a few things you can do.  You could be insistent and keep pounding away at them with speeches about what mezz is and why you don't attack the Orc that's just standing there doing nothing.  If they don't eventually get it, I suppose you could even go so far as disbanding from the group and trying to find a new one.<br><br>Secondly, you could shrug it off after the second or third mezz is broken in a row and stick to debuffing/dotting the MOBs.  Maybe this is just deferring the problem until some other unfortunate enchanter has to teach these guys, but it would be easier on your own sanity for the time being.<br><br>Lastly, you could go find a good place to solo for the next few levels.  If I recall correctly, from 12 to 16, and possibly even up to 20, your animation pet is still reasonably able to take some hits and survive to tank for you while you sit back and debuff/nuke/dot the MOBs to death.<br><br>At level 12, though, I wouldn't get too worked up about it.  People tend to get much better about assisting the main tank as time goes on.  Myself, I was probably around 19 before I ever even grouped with an enchanter.  I learned fast, though, and in fact that group is what made me decide to play an enchanter.  Now, he is my main.  There will still be people down the road who just don't seem to get it though.  I've run into one horrible druid as late as level 39 or so who still didn't understand mez, even after I tried to patiently explain it to him.  His name is now on the list of people who I will not group with again.  Fortunately, this list is not too long yet.  So, be patient, by the time you hit level 20 or so you should be more sought after in groups and you should also find yourself running into less people who don't understand mez and /assist.<br><br>As for spells, it sounds like you've got a pretty good arrangement for yourself.  Tash should always be your opening spell, for obvious reasons.  Personally, at level 41, slow is almost always the second spell I cast also.  The STR debuff is probably nice for now, but soon it won't make enough of a difference for it to be worthwhile.  That's my opinion anyhow.  As far as using the chain stun as a substitute for mez, I say if they can't learn to use mez, then why bother with crowd control at all?  Not to say that chain stunning itself is a bad thing, but not as a substitute for mez in bad groups.  Let them learn from having three MOBs running around smacking everyone around a bit.  <br><br>As for using your DoT (Choke) at that level, it depends on the situation.  If MOBs are surviving long enough for the DoT to run its course or at least long enough to do more than 50 damage, then by all means use the DoT.  If you are in a group that is mowing through MOBs left and right, why not just use your level 8 nuke (Chaotic Feedback) which is 5 less mana.  It only hits for 48, whereas your DoT does 80 total, but again if MOBs aren't staying alive long enough, then your DoT is not worth it.<br><br>I've done this before, and I'm not sure if it helped anyone, but I'll list what spells I'd have memmed at level 12 as a suggestion.  People play differently, though, and this is just what I would have, not necessarily the only spells to use.<br><br>1)Tashan<br>2)Languid Pace<br>3)Choke<br>4)Mesmerise<br>5)Color Flux<br>6)Chaotic Feedback<br>7)Root<br>8)Rotating Buff Slot (Pet, Mist, Lesser Shielding)<br><br>This is actually very similar to what my spells look like even now at level 41 for group situations.  Only difference is Nuke in slot 3 and another Color Stun in slot 6.  I don't know why that matters, just thought I'd mention it.<br><br>OK, that's enough for now.  Hopefully this will give you some ideas though.  Good luck.<br><br>[41 Enchanter] Yizzelar (Unknown)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I've noticed that sometimes my invisibility spell will drop with no warning.&nbsp;&nbsp;And that usually I am being attacked at the same time.  So it seems to me that being attacked negates invisibility.  I've read this poster somewhere but does anyone know for a fact if this is correct? Or is it just an impression?  (But if enough people get the same impression it very well may be fact.)<br><br>Also, I know undead can sometimes see through invisibilty but what does the spell description mean by frenzied animals?  Is this something in addition to the part that mentions that once something has noticed you (and put you on their hate list) that turning invisible won't save you?<br><br>Finally, I was jogging from LOIO to FV while invisible when a Froglok shin warrior attacked me.  Looking at my log I see that my inviso dropped (no warning) at the exact moment he attacked meaning his attack negated my inviso. But how in the world did he see me?  He cast no spells on me so I don't think he was a caster so no 'see invisible' at work here I don't think.  I've heard that MOBs higher level than you, perhaps 7 or more levels, can sometimes see through inviso but I was level 26 and I think 28 is their max level so I don't see how that could be it.  I am really confused and could use advice from someone who knows.<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well, like some of you I created my enchanter before I ever heard of anyo of the sites like Allakhazam, but I'll throw my 2 cents in on what I've found out by level 37 about stats.&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to change of opinion when I hit 54.  /grins.<br><br>Agnostic - I think I would have gone that way.  No benefit to following a deity.  LOTS of negatives if you do.<br><br>1.  STR-I put 5 points into STR on creation.  I think I should have put more.  I constantly have to carry stuff, or do because I can.  I get more loot and don't get enc. as much.  Mana regenerates slower when you're encumbered.  Just so you know, also if you are out of food and/or water.<br><br>2.  INT- overrated in many ways imho.  Too many items to count that add INT.  Yeah mana is good and yes we're oom a lot, cause we do a lot, not cause we don't have enough mana to start with.  Without major twinked items and Radiant Visage, (I've made, quested or bought everything I have) I have 153 int and 193 charisma.  <br><br>3.  CHA- Yeah, try charming a Hill giant with 120 Charisma and then try with 175+.  BIG difference.  The only thing here is Enchanters get CHA buffs and many of our quest items have Charisma in them too.  BUT, don't overlook putting a few points here.  Since getting my charisma to 193+ for group use, I've been much more successful in crowd control than before.  I can get it to 202 if I swap out my sapphire earrings, but have to give up strength to do it and have seen no apparent difference between charisma of 193 and 202.<br><br>3.  STA - I put a few into STA, that was a waste if you ask me.  You get 1hp per STA point.  Like that's going to save your life.  Rune gives you like 173 extra hp buffer, and Shields give more as well.  I think those points would have been better in INT, CHA or STR even.<br><br>Wouldn't bother with WIS, DEX, AGI either.  I swap out Polished Bone Bracelets with my Gold cats-eye bracelets when working on tradeskills, not sure if it really helps but it seems to, especially since I got gatorscale leggings.<br><br>Jewelcraft for fun and profit?  Well for fun, not for profit.  Unless you enjoy spending hours on end sending out auction's.  I'd rather be out fighting.  I'm at 185 skill in Jewelcraft and master of many others, cause I like the idea and I do it in my down time.  You won't make money at this unless your guild or sugar-daddy finances you, at least till after level 34, even then only at the expense of not questing, not fighting and not leveling.  shrugs your choice.  I enjoy the fact that I've made my gold sapphire earrings, most of my friends have good jewelry too.  But I'm just not in to sitting around auctioning stuff.  I can usually make more profit killing mobs.  You can usually buy the jewelry for much less than it will cost you to get to the skill level you'll need to make it yourself.  To me, it just makes a difference that I made it myself.<br><br>Other trade-skills to consider.  Well if you want some great items, the Coldain Prayer Shawl's look great to me.  You need Tailoring, Pottery (maybe), Brewing, and Baking.  All much cheaper to master than Jewel Craft, except the Tailoring.  I'd recommend taking up tailoring, you can make money sooner with HQ backpacks and it is required for the Coldain quests.<br><br>Soloing? Shrugs again. If I have to or if I'm bored, I can and do it pretty well most times.  Don't have to much since level 20.  Chanters pretty much rock in group and rarely have a problem getting a group if you want one.  Have played with charm soloing more since I got my charisma up, I rarely even load a nuke any more.  Make /pet attack hot key.  SoW nice, not always necessary, if no SoW make sure you know where the zone is and be close to it.  Have Nullify Magic and Color stun loaded, Beguile or charm pet after tash.  Pick your target (try different mobs in your zone, you'll figure out which ones work well), click on it hit /pet attack hot key.  Follow your pet and when you get close enough tash root the bad guy.  I don't root pet, my preference.  Watch health bars of both, if your pet is getting lower than the other, root pet, nullify magic, beguile the other one.  (You already tashed it before you rooted it so should be no problem).  Also if I have a pet and have had for a while, I re-charm before charm breaks if it hasn't withing one or two minutes and if mana is good, I don't know seems to work for me.  (note, you have been sitting or meditating during the fight right?) Other spells loaded depend on your preference etc.  I won't bore you with more details, play with it.  I tried charm at level 12, I don't recommend at that level solo.  With someone else backing you up, it's great practice.  Unless you're majorly twinked at level 12 your charisma is like 120, charm will usually break after about 20 seconds or so in my experience.  Hopefully the mob is dead by then, sometimes not.  (At level 12 you should try sirens; charm one have it attack the other.  Backup is good to have, make sure you have gate loaded though.)<br><br>Favorite things to charm.  Derv's, Kodiaks, Sarnaks.  It's so funny going to WC to kill bears for pelts and charm a Dervish Thug.  Lowbies will run up to him to try to attack as you run around looking for your next kill, thinking you're running away from him.  It's a riot.  You'll need a /rofl key for that one.  (side note, if you don't think your charisma makes a difference in charm time, try this charm a kodiak with no charisma buffs, sit around see how long it lasts, try with Charisma over 180 or so, I noticed a big difference.  Maybe it's just coincidence, but after I got my charisma to 193 I had an alligator following me for like half an hour in Cazic Thule.  Enchanter pets can be some of the most amusing in the game.)<br><br>Which brings up the next topic, Enchanter animations.   I use mine a lot more than many Enchanters at my level, I think.  I love my ani's.  They will protect me in weak groups who don't watch out for me, I can use them as support melee if we are caster heavy.  Need rune all the time for that.  I've even been main backup tank in a group with two enchanters.  Me and my little blender with dagger of dropping or bronze dagger with Augmentation can do a bunch of damage.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hi there, just wanted to say something about the Jewel craft issue. I am a 250 master Jeweler lvl 59 enchanter. Spend the money and the time to become a 250 Jeweler, but don't do this all at once. Spend time each bringing you skill up 5 to 10 points each level and try and bring your skill up. Don't try and sell any silver rings or anything like that,just make them and sell them back to the merchant. Remember you DO NOT need to enchant the metal in order to increase your skill. You will make money. Once you get one person to buy from you that is lvl 50+ they will pass your name on and so on and so forth. I am not joking when I say I can easily make 10k in one night on jewelry. The people that buy from you will remember you and come back to you, as well as sending their friends to you. Trust me work on it while you are lower in levels and once you are 50+ and can reach skill 250 it pays off big time. <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

It is not just the melee classes that have to grasp the concept of agro management.<br><br>Certain actions (esp. offensive actions) cause you to rise a certain amount on a mob's hate list. Sanity Warp (90+ DD spell) has a HUGE kicker for agro. Therefore, there are two immediate issues with this strategy:<br><br><b>(i)</b> At level 16, this spell is unreliable at best even with Tashan (Magic resistance debuff - should ALWAYS be your first or second spell. Improves your chance - and that of your group - to land spells). Without tashan, you're wasting mana and achieving HUGE taunt in the bargin. Bonus!<br><br><b>(ii)</b> It bears to reiterate that certain chanter spells have a high taunt factor. At level 19, I'm starting to take on board agro management and <i>timing</i> my spells - in the same way Wizards have to. Well, wizards that wish to remain healthy :P <br><br>The key to comedy, and agro management, is timing (from a caster's perspective). In a group situation, you land tashan, possibly wait for the tank to achieve taunt, and then follow up with other spells. Tip: Memory Blur is a fantastic spell to mop up hate (agro) when a mob is laying the beat down on your healer. Remarkable spell. In one of my groups, I noticed at the corner of my eye one of the mobs peel off from the group and beat down on the cleric. One liberal application of Mem Blur and said mob ignored the cleric (remember: turn OFF auto-attack - nothing worse then regaining agro) and retargetted the tank.<br><br>In a solo situation you most certainly do NOT land Sanity Warp as your first or even second spell. Massive, MASSIVE taunt which will cause your pet to intervene when the mob starts whopping your chanter ass (what with your whooping sub AC :P). Pet will not be able to taunt mob from beating down on you, which means you cannot mezmorise the mob due to pyschopathic pet .. unless you can stun, until (i) you can mem gate and beat feet, (ii) root the mob, or (iii) the pet manages to taunt the mob from you ..<br><br>I found out the HARD way against a crag spider. Hurts when a mob whacks you for 38 dam a pop, and its poison is absolutely <i>vile</i>. I got lucky. Root, fall back, let pet gain taunt. Was left with 1 1/2 bars of RED, 'tho. Exceedingly fortunate. <br><br>A better strategy adopted by many posters would be:<br><br><b>(i)</b> Lead with Tashan<br><b>(i)a</b> Attempt to Mezz target Mob if mob is 2.5 seconds distance from you (casting time) or ..<br><b>(ii)</b> Pet intervenes once the mob hits you, if so, back off<br><b>(iii)</b> DoT (Choke is a real goodie - debuff and a DoT)<br><b>(iv)</b> Depending on the specific mob, debuff .. e.g Languid Pace, Disempower, Weaken etc.<br><b>(v)</b> DD if necessary<br><br>My personal tactic is to rush into melee range and stun (colour flux - I will chain stun at lvl 20 by adding colour shift to a hotkey with flux. Mentioned elsewhere in this thread). 1 second casting time, minimal taunt, and best of all, your pet has 4 seconds worth of free attacks (not much, I grant you) but best of all, NO damage for those 4 seconds.<br><br>As has been stated, Chanters have a wide range of situational spells, and the ability to take down mobs to pissant size. That is the key soloing .. with our weak pets and their inherent disadvantage (no control) - adaptability. I like charm soloing for that adrenaline rush :P Caster madman make <i>excellent</i> pets - those spells can really lay the smack down. Have yet to try charming DBS [Dry Bones Skeletons] but would work equally as well in theory .. or unless, Charm breaks. c.f. stun.<br><br>**Note to self: Remember, and REMEMBER: colour flux (stun) is an AoE (Area of Effect) spell. It will affect ALL mobs in the spell radius - absolutely no discriminations. Not fun to have a kindly guard whack you for triple figures because it was caught in your stun.<br><br>To reiterate: when you hit level 16, you must start to grasp the concept of agro management. When your spells start to add a taunt kicker, and mobs start to hit in the high 30's +, apart from the healer, you are the class that cannot AFFORD to die. With your pitiful AC, you will not be able to withstand too many blows - better to learn agro management now than to rely on tanks regaining agro. ** When mobs start to whale in triple figures, you're usually dead at this point.

Sk's and Necro's can get a corpse whereas the clerics cannot...Bards Can keep a group alive with similiar skills to those of enchanters provided they KNOW what to do.   <br><br>Anyhow, no class is really better than another but people just happen to enjoy playing one over another for some reason or another.  The big picture is that TEAMWORK and understanding how each class can serve each other is the key to success in the game.<br><br>I started off playing a cleric.  She is lvl 59 today.  My second character, I made an enchanter. As my cleric, I learned a lot about enchanters besides LOVING them.  For instance, I rune myself, I rune the cleric.  (btw, my enchanter is lvl 31 and tho twinked a little - she is definately not powerlvled.)  If there are more than one tank in the group, I explain that I will Alacrity them and I assign someone as my timer.  I have them use Ss to communicate that their speed has gone.  When that tanks is gone, so are the others going.  I have the monk tell me when to Aug him.  Sometimes, if I cannot find a good tank as a timer, I cast it on myself and time that way.  I know many players may want to say, why waste the time.  In a group, I once timed Alacrity on myself to use as the timer then kept it on the tank.  He didn't say much about it then but one week later, he told me, I SO LOVE YOUR SPEED!  <br><br>I will admit that it is annoying to have people break mezzes.  We, enchanters, often find that this occurs mostly with newbies.  I don't have much patience for dealing with that.  What I have done though is play my lvl 59 cleric and let others know that I have an alternate character who is an enchanter.  Lo and behold, so do they and before I know it...my enchanter gets an invitation to group with players who are alternates but just trying out another class.  Those are the best!  We really do find out how each class can benefit the other.  More so than that though, high lvls above 40ish Know not to break mezzes and have learned to /assist &lt;target tank&gt;, so when I play with their lower alternate character, BING!, no lessons need to be learned.<br><br>Newbies really need to listen up to higher lvls of their same class.  Oftentimes, I'll give a tell to a higher lvl'd enchanter that I admire with my cleric and I'll ask them for advice.  I am a professional at playing my cleric but I have much to learn with my enchanter.<br><br>One tip I was given that I found extremely effective as my enchanter was this:  Use F9 key, and targeting becomes much easier for mezzing.  Enthrall is better and last longers than Mezmerization; however there are instances AE mez comes in handy.  Stand Back when casting AE mez so that you do not mez yourself.<br><br>One last comment:  When I play my cleric, grouping with a bard AND enchanter is HEAVEN DIVINE!<br><br>Jeek<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hrmm, well about the only thing I can think to do is look at the level 12 spells and decide what I would have loaded now.&nbsp;&nbsp;This would be the setup I would use.<br><br>1)Tashan<br>2)Languid Pace<br>3)Chaotic Feedback<br>4)Mesmerize<br>5)Color Flux<br>6)Root<br>7)Choke (if grouped or animation soloing)  Charm (if charm soloing)<br>8)Rotating Buff Slot (Pet, Mist, Shielding, Strengthen)<br><br>If in a full group, I probably wouldn't cast much more than tash and slow on each mob, maybe a nuke here and there if I had plenty of mana.  If things started to get ugly, you would have your AoE stun, mez, and root loaded for crowd control.<br><br>If soloing with animation, I would start with tash and try to get a root off before the mob hit me.  This way the pet doesn't engage yet and he may actually survive the whole battle.  With the mob rooted I would slow and then DoT, maybe nuke until root breaks and then let the pet beat him the rest of the way to his death.<br><br>Charm soloing I never tried at this level, but if you have the cajones, then I would suggest trying it only if you have a SoW on at all times.  Even then I would have a hard time trusting this low level charm spell to stick long enough to be really effective.  But then, like I said, I never tried it myself.  Again I'd lead off with tash then try to charm my new buddy.  Once done, send him in against the target, tash the target, slow it, and maybe nuke once to turn the scale enough in your pet's favor.<br><br>This, looking back, is how I'd have my spells arranged if I was back at level 12.  Different people might have different ideas though, so this is by no means gospel truth.  The best you can probably do is goof around with each spell and decide if you like it or not.<br><br>have fun,<br><br>-Yizz<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want money, avoid tradeskills.  In today's game, trying to work on tradeskills early in your career will lead to poverty and much frustration.  I started jewelry at level 8, as soon as I got Enchant Silver, and to be quite honest, I'd have much better gear and much more money if I'd just left it alone and not have bothered with it.  I realize a lot of you are drawn to Enchanters just for jewelry.  If that's you, please stop playing an Enchanter.  You're going to end up spending more money on it than you will ever get back, unless you plan on spending a nice loooooooooong while in the FP area trying to peddle your wares (oh yeah, and you're only gonna make any sort of real money when you can start doing Platinum at level 34, and even then, good luck).<br><br>2) I don't advise trying to solo after level 5.  Just find groups.  You're gonna get a lot of people here who're gonna sell you on Charm-kiting, Mez-n-Nuke, AoE-Mez-n-Nuke, and a ton of other funky, gimmicky ways of trying to solo your Chanter, but my advice to you is just to stick to your guns and be the best grouping Enchanter you can be.  Enchanters are social by need and nature.  We control everything that's around us, and that gives us a ton of power.  However, we can't really do much in a void.  And for those who are going to argue that I probably just suck at soloing, I'm going to have to defend my credibility.  I did solo Noclin Saah in Paineel for about 2 levels.  I've also charm-kited Specs in Oasis (what a horribly fun time that was, watching newbies get slaughtered the first few times I tried it  :D ).  Sure, it was decent XP, but in a group, I would just command the puller to bring 3 or 4 mobs, and I'd keep them all in a nice, orderly line for my group to kill.  Oh...here are some numbers too:  In a group of 6, XP gets divided among 6 people rather evenly, throwing in a certain bonus percentage for having a full group.  Soloing, you may kill a mob once every 10 to 15 minutes.  In a group, you can kill 1 mob per 1 to 2 minutes, if your group is decent.  That means that in 15 minutes, you've just killed 5 or 6 mobs, and have gotten as much XP as you would've gotten soloing.  Plus, you just had the added advantage of being safe and secure AND you're ready to keep on pulling mobs, whereas if you were solo, you'd be on yer butt meditating.  :D  The bottom line is to just find groups.<br><br>3)  Learn your crowd control abilities early on.  No, Enchanters aren't &quot;defined as a class&quot; when they get to level 16 and get Breeze.  Breeze is 1 mana a tick, it's laughable.  The whole deal with Breeze-whore casters is that it's all in the mind.  They fool themselves into thinking that Breeze is some horribly powerful mana-regen spell.  It's 1 mana a tick, folks.  Nothing more.  Your mana is going to regen about 5 to 10 percent faster, that's about it.  But I digress.  You get Mesmerize at level 4 and Color Flux at level 8.  You're good to go.  Tell your pullers to start pulling in multiples.  Start teaching people how to assist each other.  Start working on tricks to target better (as you get older, you'll see that from levels 1 to 50, an Enchanter really just learns elaborate ways to click on targets).  Once you go beyond your greenhorn levels, you're ready to show people what a powerful class the Enchanter truly is.<br><br>4) Do research and teach others.  There are TONS of good guides out there for learning how to play an effective Enchanter.  Check out Allakhazam's links section, and I'm sure you'll find plenty of literature.  Go to those sites, explore, investigate, and when the time comes, show other people how to work with you, and learn to work with others (early in your career, it's going to be VERY difficult to get melee attackers to assist each other...they'll end up learnning as they go, trust me...yet, some still aren't smart enough to do so).<br><br>That's about all I've got for now...maybe one day, I'll write my own expansive &quot;How to be an Enchanter&quot; guide.<br><br>Oh...as a side note:  Please, do not refer to Clarity as &quot;crack&quot;, &quot;sugar&quot;, &quot;sweet thing&quot;, &quot;caster cocaine&quot;, &quot;Wizzie Dope&quot;, &quot;Cleric juice&quot; or any other silly name.  You defame Enchanters everywhere and make us vastly underrated in the eyes of other players.  We are Enchanters, be proud of that.  Without us, groups don't work.  (Oh, and when someone tells you that Bards can do our jobs, just laugh, leave their group and let them find a Bard...you're an Enchanter, you're elite, and nobody can do the job you do).<br>&nbsp;<br>Ellon Silktongue<br>54th level Illusionist<br>Drinal Server<br>Avengers of Honour</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I agree with you on some points there Ellon, but I don't think you need to be quite so negative in some of your criticisms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, this is not a flame post, it's a 'response' in the hopes that other people will see that there are more than one side to many issues, and learn to explore and adventure on their own.  Making up their own minds about what works for them.<br><br>1)Jewelry:  Couldn't agree more.  Although I've not completely given up the trade yet, it's become so expensive and cost-ineffecient for me that I've decided to hold it off indefinitely.  With a skill now of 124 I have had only marginal success in selling items like silver ruby veils.  It seems, also, that with every expansion that equipment comes around that is frequently as good or better than what we can make, and usually sells for cheaper.  My advice, maybe practice up jewelry enough to make yourself and friends some cheap silver items in the early levels.  Beyond that, I would wait until you have plenty of plat in the bank, and your INT well over 200 to minimize failures and maximize chances for skill improves.  Otherwise, you'll be Everbroke.<br><br>2)Soloing:  One reason I love my enchanter is that they can be effectively played solo, partnered, or grouped.  For me, I do all three.  Having burned through the last 8 levels or so in OT I am extremely bored with outdoor groups and need a huge change.  So, I've been soloing through level 40.  Could I get better xp in a full group in OT or DL?  Probably, but would I be enjoying myself?  Nope.  It bothers me when people express opinions in the form of 'these are the facts.'  The truth is, enchanters have so many spells and so many unique spells, there is no 'one right way' to play one.  Therefore, IMHO, make up your own mind.  We are capable of soloing, we are highly sought after in groups.  You choose.<br><br>3)Yes, what will define you as a competent enchanter in groups is your ability to keep total control over what is going on.  If you can successfully learn this skill, you will find yourself making lots of friends who will send you tells from three zones away asking you to come group with them.  Your CC abilities save your tanks hitpoints which save your healers mana which allows you to pull faster and get more xp, not to mention to run a very safe group.<br><br>4)Only thing I would add here is check out the enchanter forums on castersrealm.com and ask about Eugee's enchanter guide.  It's very comprehensive, entertaining, and popular.<br><br>So I guess the only point I really didn't see eye to eye with Ellon on were his remarks on soloing.  Other than that, I agree on everything else.  One last comment though, it's kind of ironic that you take offense at the slang terms for clarity, and yet at the bottom of your post you have &quot;Pimping is a state of mind...&quot;  It's a game, don't take it too seriously.<br><br>-Yizzelar<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Not that I dont beleive in the importance of CHA, after all how is it good to have more mana but of bunch of resist on your mez, but CHA gears are simply cheaper. I've put all my points in CHA and now it cost me a fortune to increase my INT. Example on my server a batskull earring cost 300pp-450pp and it gives +5 INT but an opalline earring cost like 80pp for 5 CHA. For about 140pp you can make yourself a pair of +7 CHA ring and i think its trivial at 127, for a pair of +5 INT you'd need Velium rings which cost way much more. You can make yourself a pair of +7 CHA bracer for about 25pp once you can enchant gold and I personnaly dont know any +7 INT items that you can get for that price. Even if you dont have the money to learn jewelry those items are pretty cheap for the CHA they provides and anyone with a skill of 150 can make it easily. So for +38 CHA it could only cost you 350pp (well on my server) it probly cost me 3k for the same amount of INT gears. It cost me about 1.5k to get my jewelry skill to 150 so my advice to you is put your points in INT and make up with the gears. And also you will get CHA buff later that will totally make up for the CHA you dont have when you start.<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ah, Grasshopper, you still see things in an inexperienced light.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Charisma JEWELRY is cheaper than Int JEWELRY, but jewelry is only 6 slots out of 17.  If you do your research, you'll see that Int gear is a dime a dozen, while Cha gear is a lot harder to find.<br><br>Also, you will get 1 point of mana per level for every 5 points of Int that you have (this is a rough estimate, but accurate enough to rely on).  Until you go beyond level 20 or so, you're better off getting Mana increasing gear over Int.  However, you get Breeze at level 16, and Clarity at level 29.  With the boost in mana regen that you get from those, you can safely afford to sacrifice your Int for other items.<br><br>Lastly, Charisma starts to truly affect your Mezzes and Charms in a positive way at around 170.  Cha jewelry and a buff isn't going to get you where you should be.  It's going to take some heavy investing in other gear to get your Cha up, and honestly, you're going to have a hard time finding anything good.<br><br>By the way, here's  list of gear that's good and not extraordinarily hard to get, and the relevant stat:<br><br>Head: Batfang Headband or Savant's Cap (int 3 each)<br>Face: Silver Star Ruby Veil (Cha 5), Incandescent Mask (Int 5, Cha 6, somewhat tough quest item 29+)<br>Ears: Opalline Earing (Cha 5), Gold Sapphire Earring (Int 4)<br>Fingers: Electrum Star Ruby rings (Cha 7)<br>Wrists: Gold Cat Eye Bracers (Cha 7), Polished Bone Bracers (Int 3)<br>Arms: Gatorscale Sleeves (Int 6)<br>Waist: Braided Cinch Cord (Int 4)<br>Legs: Drake Hide leggings (Cha 5)<br>Feet: Loam Encrusted Boots (Cha 8, higher level item) (Note:  This was the hardest slot for me to fill.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>There is some validation to his claim, but IMO it only really comes into play in the very high level game (i.e. ~45-60).&nbsp;&nbsp;Before then, unless you are twinked you'll be more worried about INT/CHA for your chanter.  The common trend for enchanters seems to be gather up all their INT/CHA gear until both are 'maxed' at 200, then realizing that some extra HP/AC would really do some good, so they start replacing some gear with more of those stats on it.  I think what your friend is saying is that why not boost your STA now so that you'll be 'a leg up' in the higher levels, with slighty more STA and therefore more HP naturally.<br><br>It's been my experience, albeit only in some 39 levels so far, that enchanters get aggroed, usually with good reason, more than any other casters.  The exception may be clerics at high levels.  When I need to mezz, 9 of 10 times I'll throw on a tash first, which usually brings the MOB running to me.  As long as I can get a color stun off quickly I usually only take one or two hits, but the times when you get resists/interruptions is when that extra AC/HP is going to save your arse if your healer can't.<br><br>So, he has a valid argument, depending on how you are looking at the game though.  His focus is set mainly on the high end game, where it makes sense.  It's up to you to decide if you want to suffer being 'dumb and smelly' in lower levels as a sacrifice to being tougher in the later levels.<br><br>P.S. I still love my little animation pet.  Yes, I can still solo with him, but sheesh it takes a buttload of mana and poor little airhead is usually pretty beat up afterward.  Charm soloing is much more exciting and rewarding IMO.  =)<br><br>Have fun,<br><br>Yizzelar<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Sorry for the delayed response, been 'AFK' for a bit.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know that either INT or CHA items have more AC than the other.  I think you can find items with either that have/don't have AC/HP along with them.  For example, I'm thinking of trading my 2STR/4INT earring for a 2AC/5CHA one basically for the extra AC.  I'll replace the lost INT and get even more AC with a new robe (oh yeah baby gimme that Froglok Bonecaster's Robe!).  Not to mention the 10STR which will more than make up for the 2 I lose.  I'm not sure if all of that really has a point except to say that there's a lot of items in the game you can find with both AC and INT or CHA, sometimes even all three.  =)<br><br>I'm not 100% certain on the CHA cap at 200, but personally I am very happy with mine at 173, and won't worry about it anymore at all when I get it to 175.  Based on what most other higher level chanters say, the effect above 150 or so seems so miniscule to them that they don't bother much with it after that point.  I have not seen any 'hard facts' for this claim though, so I'll keep mine at 175 or so and be happy.<br><br>As for the Paw 'exploit', yeah I would guess that they had fixed that.  I know that every time I have tried to cast charm when I already had a pet (summoned animation or charmed), it's told me that I can only have one pet at a time.  I don't know if what you refer to is particular to that zone or not, but even if it was I would be 99.99% sure that Verant has put a stop to it by now.<br><br>Well good luck with your new chanter and keep us posted on the progress.<br><br>-Yizz<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Greetings all!<br><br>I have a question that has probably been answered hundreds and hundreds of times but hey..whats once more right!? lol Anyway I am a rapidly growing chanter. Made level 6 in about 8 hours of broken playing..no groups or twinking I figure I wil start to group once I hit 10 or so, but I was wondering where is the best place to gain xp AND loot while soloing? I am mostly in EC killing everything that moves, and on occasion I will sneak into WC and beat down something I can handle. I prefer both xp and loot in once place that I can handle but I really prefer a place that I can get money. Any help will be GREATLY appreciated! Thanks in advance.<br><br>Edari<br>2nd Circle High-Elf Enchanter<br>Xegony<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
