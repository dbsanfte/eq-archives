You can throw this puppy in your offhand once you get dual-wield, and keep it, like I did, till level 45, when the proc is enabled. It procs 'cancel magic' at 45, which will strip you of your buffs :/ . But, until then, you got a low delay, good ratio 1hs, that adds 20 dex, which is awesome for us rangers, and it looks badass, like a shadowknights Dark Reaver. On my server, you can get one for as low as 1k. Well, theres some info for the weapon question. Hope this helps, and hope you can get your hands on one of 'em.<br><br>Skul<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Rest of the armor probably BA. <br>Weapons some low delay weapons for skillbuilding (dragoon dirk 40pp max, icepaws 350-450pp,...)and some decent weapons for later like icethoots (250-350pp) and BA longsword.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>This is what I would do, doing the Ivy Etched Armor quests are fun. I wore some banded pieces till 30th and did just fine. If I was starting a twink ranger I wouldn't get armor that is better than Ivy so it would give me reason to quest. What I would get is the following:<br><br>2 Forest Loop or 2 cougar claw earring or 1 of each they relatively cheap these days. <br><br>Lots of armor choices out there but this stuff is relatively cheap and easy to get.<br><br>Blackened Alloy Armor for chest, waist, legs, back, boots and arms (better AC than banded and not that expensive) Blackened Iron Armor is ok too and probably a bit cheaper. If you end up buying banded armor just make sure you get some kind of magic boot for kicking those ghouls and wisps.<br><br>Head exe hood or blackened iron or alloy crown<br><br>Shoulder bloodstained mantle is good choice gives pretty good magic resist and str bonus<br><br>Face Dented brass mask<br><br>For wrist slot I would pick up a bracer of scavenging and bracer of Erollisi (sp)<br><br>For Fingers I would pick up either 6AC/65hps rings or go cheap route and pick up jagged bands.<br><br>For weapons I would pick up a bunch of velium weapons for 1hb 2hb 2hs 1hs and piercer a walrus tooth is good and cheap or a dragoon dirk till you hit 20th then upgrade.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I say get those weapons is cuz they are comparable to fs weapons but are magical in nature.  I believe in maxing all weapons skills its easier to do if it takes you a lot of swings to kill something.  Besides until you hit 20th and lose your damage cap it doesn't make sense to use an uber weapon.<br><br>Get the best bow you can afford and start your fletching as soon as you can.<br><br>I make Trueshot bows occassionally on my server and give em out to young rangers for doing a special task or sometimes if I need the coin I sell em for 100pp. You might be able to find a deal like that on your server.<br><br>If you don't like my suggestions for gear you could just join this site as a premium member and do a search here on this site and will give you a list of armors for each of your slots.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>First of all, Merry Christmas Everybody!<br><br>Now, we all had so much fun with Rauvin &quot;Most Memorable Death&quot; post I thought I'd make a similar thread - most memorable fight (hopefully that you lived to see the end of.)<br><br><br>Mine was at level 14, Butcherblock Mountains, Chessboard. My group and I had been hunting the pawns, knights, and bishops there for several hours. About 8 o'clock at night game time there was a long break in the spawns. We were all goofing off, joking around, when our druid goes,<br><br>&quot;/g Guys.....don't move!&quot;<br><br>The three of us tanks stopped dead. The king had spawned on the board and we were just outside his aggro radius. I made a wide circle back the the group. At level 14, I was the group leader and highest ranking member.<br><br>&quot;We'll pull around him.&quot; I said, knowing fully well that the king is around level 18, and seeing as we had a few level 9's in the group, I was pretty sure him and his spells would make short work of us. But after a few more pops it became apparent that that wasn't going to work. His pet was wandering to close to one of the spawn points, and if we got an add, it was going to be crazy.<br><br>This happened in May, but off the top of my head we had myself, a dwarf pally, an erudite necro, a high elf cleric, dwarf warrior and a wood elf druid. A pretty balanced group, but the king was red to all of us. &quot;/shout Looking for help with the undead&nbsp;&nbsp;king at Chessboard&quot; rang through the zone. Within a few seconds we'd drawn one helpful person - a level 30 something druid who did nothing but buff us and left, and a big crowd of spectators. Apparently, they'd come to watch us die. My group and I formulated a plan.<br><br>I was going to snare pull him, and the dwarven pally was going to tank the pet. I was to be main tank (the warrior was level 9) on the king, with warrior playing second fiddle. Druid nukes, cleric keeps me alive as long as possible, necro fears and sics his pet on the king. But bearing in mind the king's high magic resistance, fear and DoT spells and stupid pet, I figured I was going to wake up naked in Kelethin within a very few short minutes. I was only hoping that I lived long enough to make it so the group could take him down.<br><br>Once everyone knew their role, I made the pull. It was over in no time. I cast snare. He resisted, and ran towards me cackling as skeletons do. The necro feared. Nothing happened. Out of the corner of my eye I'm seeing fireworks as the pally starting using his versus undead spells on the pet. My HP bar is going down.....down......down.......down.....<br><br>You feel your muscles buldge with berserker strength! I could have kissed my polished granite tomahawk at that moment. At this point I have 30% HP, king is at 75%. Still doesn't look good for me. I hack away a little bit more. PGT procs again! I seeing the druid nuking his ass off and suprisingly some of them are sticking. King at 50%. Cleric is hollering &quot;LOM!&quot; And my HP bar is looking scary at 50%. And another proc! By now, I'm laughing at my desk because I haven't taken a hit in the past 20 ticks. Oops. Spoke to soon. King at 20%. And I am getting smashed around. By now I'm screaming at the warrior to taunt it off me. And he's screaming right back &quot;I'm trying, I'm trying!&quot;. I watch in horror as my red bar slips to below 10%. And then....<br><br>YOU lose control of yourself!<br><br>And suddenly I'm walking towards the zone wall, on a casual stroll. The king had feared me and turned on the warrior. Standing back now I'm firing all the arrows I have in my pockets and praying.....praying.<br><br>You hit an undead king for 7 points of damage!<br>An undead king dies!<br><br>I was screaming. I couldn't believe I'd survived and that we'd killed him, and no one had died. we made short work of the pet and then I passed out mead to the party members. The audience was clapping. But the best part of the night was our cleric typing this in the channel:<br><br>/shout &quot;Lashara is the Queen of Chessboard! The King is dead! Long live our Queen!&quot;<br><br>It was an awesome night.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lashara Dyran<br>"Little Miss Bow & Arrows"<br>Keeper of the wolves<br>Ranger of the 34th sun <br>Lanys T'Vyl</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Merry Christmas to you.<br><br>That was a good fight, it amazing how the close ones are always the most fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rush and feeling of accomplishment that you get after the fight is over.<br><br>Mine was when I was camping the Mino Hero at 42nd level.  I was doing the camp to get the Hero Bracer for a few of the lower level members.  I am one of 6 light race/class members in our mainly evil guild.  My Sk was my main for the first 35 levels, as we all know guilds become like families so it was natural that my alts follow in his footsteps.  Well before I get off the subject, I was there and some lower levels were killing clockworks, drakes, elementals and harpies. I was damage shielding them and buffing on occassion. I asked them to kill the PH for the Mino Hero.  They agree, I believe one was barbarian shamaness a gnome rogue, and gnome necro.  <br><br>I was healing them after a fight when a 44 mage comes through and I say becareful going in there cuz Meldrath is a tough son of a gun.  She tells me to mind my own business, well you can guess what happens next. She pulls a train consisting of to 2 Mino Lords (think it was a bug that caused 2 to spawn), and 2 Mino Sentries.  Meldrath followed her to guards. She must have gated after taking him to the guards. I immediately snared both Lords and the Sentries. Ran back and memmed root after casting Call of Sky.<br><br>I through a quick DoT on all of them. The rest of the lower levels scrammed but the barbarian shamaness. I began kitting them and to half then engaging in melee one at time, used root to hold off the other 3 while I finished the one I was on. After repeating this till the last Sentry was dead her comrads return I am down to my last bub of health. Sentries being green still hit hard when they do hit. The Lords were low blues, well I use up my last bub of mana getting my health up by one bub, the shamaness heals me till shes oom, bless her heart. Her group decides to kill the PH.<br><br>Well I have one bub of mana by the time the kill the PH and guess who pops? My friend I have been waiting for the Mino Hero.  Needless to say I was kinda upset, but I think to myself I can sit here for another 2 hours or take em on ... besides I was killing him since I hit 39th level, I'm 42nd now and should be able to take em easier. So I cast snare, knowing snare would break before I, would finish my kiting I didnt cast a dot. For some reason I had made 1 10 slot backpack of arrows in addition to the 6 slot quiver I had. I was down to 8 stacks of arrows and typically with the Mino Hero I would kite em using 3 stacks of arrows, bad pathing for archery is reason for so many, and use DoT's. This time I would have only arrows. So I kite him and realize I need to get his health down. Quick cuz I am not doing enough damage with arrows this time, damn Verant with their archery bugs.<br><br>So I run and engage em, I take him down to 2 bubs of health. But he took me down to 1 bub of health from 3/4 so I back off and laydown snare and begin kiting again.  Well as luck would have it, my SoW runs out and I get hit while trying to cast SoW. The little shamaness I was helping earlier realized what had happened and cast SoW on me.  I thank her she says the least I could do for you since you were helping us. I am below one bub of health so the Mino Hero won't run till I get his health below mine.  The shamaness is trying to heal me but I have to keep moving to keep out of the Mino Hero range so she is not able to heal.  I am slinging arrows and just as his snare breaks he hits me bring me down to 52 hps and I get snare off and run back.  Hes after me with a vengenance now, I stick em with a few more arrows.<br><br>But by this time I am running low on arrows. So I head to area with the best pathing for archery though least amount of space for running around. I fling arrow off and bam I get a critical of 61 dmg sending him running so I make sure to position myself behind him, he can riposte for 88 dmg, and let loose, the shamaness comes and heals me to one bub, I loot the shackle and give her the 40pp I had on me and the mino axes that the Mino Hero had. I thanked her, got some mana, and buffed her group and bid my farewell.  I know I could have run to the guards by the wind mills but I knew that with a little help from Tunare I would be ok. It wasn't epic by some peoples standards, but after the fight I was very proud of that Hero Bracer I was rewarded with and the guild member I gave it too is very proud to be wearing it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Cannis 50th Ranger<br>Razer 43rd Sk<br>Jeetkundo 20th Monk<br>Mikaraz 27th Warrior<br>Taranthian 30th Necro</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Damn you Lashara you would have to come up with Greatest Fight. Dang now I have to pick my brian for awhile..........<br><br>Hmmm would have to say that it was when I went back into Black Burrow and pulled up track. It was 4 a.m. central time. No one in the zone except me. I went from top to bottom killing everything. Once I cleared a level I moved down. Now this is hard to do if you have ever been in Blackburrow. Spawn times are crazy here and the wandering gnoll patrols are crazy. Very easy to pull a train here. I went all the way down to the third level and killed off all the guys that smacked me around when I was a newbie running around with just banded armor on and rusty weapons. Did not even loot the corpses just went on a killing spree. Took me about 1 hour to clear out all the mobs I could find. Pulled up track and noticed that everything above me had respawned. Corpses laying everywhere I went back up through the tunnels and hallways killing as I saw em. I did not get em all, but it felt great to walk down to level 3 and back up again without dying and only medding once in the Green Room.<br><br>All in all it was nothing great it was my way of getting even with all those Burly Gnolls, Gnoll Gaurdsmen, Splitpaw Refugee, Gnoll Commander and Elite Gnoll Gaurdsmen for all the deaths they gave me.<br><br>Merry Christmas all and I hope you all have Happy New Year<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Wed Dec 26 03:26:37 2001</em><br>&nbsp;<br>May Karana Bless You All,<br><br>Rauvin Darkfeather<br>Protector of the Great Storm and Follower of Karana</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ok. First off Merry Christmas Eve and Merry Christmas to all my fellow rangers!<br><br>My discouraging issue: I am a 51 ranger, that can't seem to make any cash! From level 40 or so I had been focusing very strongly on fletching and archery. Every time I'd come back to town to sell, I'd get some brain-food from a chanter (to raise my int and wis) and some shammy buffs (raising my str dex and agi) , then begin my fletching...till I was broke. I didn't really mind at the time and now I am close to 200 in each- fletching and archery, and must admit it ws worth it. A ranger must be the best bowsman he can, no arguement. Anyways. Now, level 51...I find my way to the Mountains of Rathe and begin kiting Hill Giants. Real good loot, but everyone and there brother is there, getting loot and &lt;XP&gt;.<br>I got bored of that quick. Where can I go to kite and get xp at the same time , at level 51 ? Maybe the only way to make plat quick is to buy low, and sell high in the marketplace, but I personally can't stand the place. Well, any suggestions? I just want to make enuf plat to get myself some haste /sigh. Any ideas?<br><br>Skulreaver Swiftblade<br>51 Pathfinder Eci<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Brother,<br>I too hate to sit in the markets selling things, so basically what I do for cash is kill giants in EK, NK, and WK. Tower of Frozen Shadows is also a nice place to pick up some pp on the 3rd lvl of course plus you can get gnome skin for twinking lower level guild members and get the key for the 4th level if you dont already have it. I wouldn't recomend the 4th level of ToFS without a group though, I was with 55 druid 53rd mage and 51 enchanter and they were getting exp off the kills. I also found Mistmoore a good source of income, I like Lower Guk late at night too, not many people on so getting a group is no problem again some decent drops for lower level guild members along with chance for FBSS if you get that camp. Plus if you have any lower level Rangers in your guild ya can pick up the Ademantite Band for multiquesting the Call of Flame with em.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Cannis 50th Ranger<br>Razer 43rd Sk<br>Jeetkundo 20th Monk<br>Mikaraz 27th Warrior<br>Taranthian 30th Necro</td></tr>

Like alot of woodelf newbies i tried to leave Kelethin whitout the elavator. But most memorable is probably the time i died in EK. I was lvl 14 at the time and wanted to go to HPH so i got a port to NK. Getting trough NK no problem but then came EK. I was pretty scared when i entered this zone: lots of reds and yellows, no guards, no camo yet for me... so i heard of this NPC named sir Morgan who would take you to the ledge and protect you on the way. Talked to him, he started moving, i followed, suddenly a lion attacks me. i thought this lvl 40+ will protect me but he just walked on. so i started fighting back. then another lion joins in and i start running (had sow on) towards Sir Morgan to try to get to the zone. When i catch up with him i suddenly see my health bar going down real fast. last thing i saw:<br>Sir Morgan hits you for 70 points of damage<br>...<br>Loading please wait.<br><br>I must have left clicked him while autoattack was still on. So the guy that was supposed to protect me killed me himself.<br><br>Natric Silverstar<br>Lvl 21 woodelf Ranger<br>AB server<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>So its a fair day in the lands of Norrath and I too was at the budding season of 14 when I decided to take a trip back to the homelands from my current hunting in Freeport.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I grabbed the boat in EF and curled up near the bar in the lower galley.  I continued to click sneak and hide to train them, and each time I clicked hide it would of course tell me I had to be perfectly still thanks to the boats movement.  So the boat zoned and I continued my click fest on hide and sneak.  Then all of a sudden hide worked, so we had come to the first stop in OT.  <br><br>This little trip took place after a big patch, so while I was sitting in the boat hiding and sneaking, I heard and unfimiliar noise.  I thought it was new content so I clicked off sneak (first mistake) then moved towards the deck (second mistake) and upon stepping out on the deck two Sea Fury Cyclops promplty stepped on me. (Last mistake.)  Sadly my mad dash for the dock failed and my body was lost at the zone at 3 am in the morning.  So I had to log out and wait for GM's the next morning.  Just to think that if I had just stayed put it wouldn't have happened and who ever traied the two brutes on the boat would have died alone. <br>&nbsp;<br>Kiushapo Sadalbari<br>Season 36 Wood Elf Ranger<br>{Phoenix of the Flame}</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Howdy, as you may know I've been in the overthere, ready to move on soon. Went from 33 to 39 here. Walked in the zone maxxed archery at 170. Walked out 6 levels later archery still at 170 ( I let myself fall behind ). No place I could find to buy fletching supplies. I set out on a quest to get all my lev 39 spells ( and believe me it ended up being a quest ). Gathered them all and formulated my first plan that actually worked on the FIRST try ( I'm famous on Tunare appearing before my other naked guildmates, buck naked myself saying &quot; Okay I have ANOTHER plan &quot; ). Well I set out to raise my archery back up to max before it got too far by the wayside. My plan was to dart over to oasis of Marr, sow, levitate, and hawkeye myself. Then make my first solo attempt at a sand giant ever. I hated those guys since my mid teen levels. I medded, planned, and watched younger ones running in terror. Then I spotted a plain old SG running about swatting down all the orc and croc groups like it weren't no thing. I sighed deeply and decided to try my plan.<br><br>Root ( if it sticks you can then snare, dot and a nuke or 2, if it didn't well snare probably wouldn't have stuck either ). it did = )<br><br>Dot next so it does the most damage while he's rooted<br><br>Snare, do I need to explain this = ) ?<br><br>Careless lightning, DON'T do this, it wastes mana and doesn't knock enough HP off a SG. <br><br>Now it's time to pop off arrows until root breaks. Okay root breaks. Cool I run backward faster sowed then he does forward snared. Having a blast and gaining an audience of puzzled onlookers ( also a few awe stricken ones ). Remember those pesky dunes you had to run up and down and fall all over ? Not anymore, not with levitate. Flying 20 feet in the air eyeball to eyeball with an SG is a blast. And again, it's also a crowd pleaser. The kids loved it = ). <br><br>Re-apply snare when necessary. <br><br>You should be able to avoid the sg's with ease, taking a hit every now and then. <br><br>Raised my archery skill 3 points on one SG. Got Sands of ro, and gave that to a most happy Pally. Plan on doing this at least until I max. Slow going but good xp. <br><br>Anyway if you're mid forties or lower and worried about keeping archery up, give this a shot. Hope it helped.<br><br>Montye Cristo<br>Slaying SG's with class 1 arrows.<br><br>P.S. By the way, want to also make a good impression? Try EC with sow and levitate on, near the orc camps. Find a group who needs spawn broken. Run up the nearest wall and then straight out over the orc camp. You'll look to be about a hundred feet in the air. Then Rain down lightning killing the orcs in one or 2 shots. The camp will be clear before you get halfway down. Sit to meditate while hovering down. Big crowd pleaser = ). <br><br>&nbsp;<br>True, cities have banks, but alas, I have no money. So why leave the comforts of the wild?</td></tr>

Well anyways my point is that rangers dont suck and i actually think they are the coolest class.  im only lvl 35 but thats high enough to know that when i play other classes i miss the track, sow, and heals (they may suck but they are way better than sitting).<br><br>G O   R A N G E R S !<br>&nbsp;<br>Ranger of the 36th season<br>Saryn Server</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hello all,<br><br>My name is Moseby, I am a 39 Ranger on Druzzil Ro who just got into Everquest in July.<br><br>I've read with great interest the debate over twinking. Since I knew no one in EQ when I started, I had to accumulate all my wealth by myself. Now that I am 39, a few things have struck me.<br><br>In particular, I look at my equipment and realize that all of my armor was as the result of quests (Ivy) or drops off mobs that I've killed. On the other hand, every weapon I've ever used was given to me or bought. It has often seemed that the weapons that drop off a mob are usually worse than the weapon you already have to be able to fight there.<br><br>On the other hand, I run across armor all the time that is better than mine. I will prolly be teased, but just in the last week I picked up cougar claw earrings, dwarven workboots, jagged bands, blackened alloy gridle, and a strawspun belt all of which were an upgrade or at least roughly equivalent to what I had at the time. That type of thing has never happened to me with weapons.<br><br>Well, I have no conclusion, just thought I would throw that out there for the masses to respond to.<br><br>Moseby<br>Ranger of the 39th Season<br>Kindred Spirit Guardians<br>Druzzil Ro<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Moseby<br>Ranger of 43rd Season<br>Druzzil Ro</td></tr>

This would allow you to withstand the attacks from the higher level mobs and also force you to group to put out the damage to take down the mobs that drop the better weapons.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I know a lot of people hate dying. Lord knows I do and I hate looking for a rezz or hunting my body down, but my friends and I sat down the other night and were laughing over our most memorable death we have had on EQ. So for all here to share in the experience what was your most memorable death?<br><br>Mine was when I was checking out a new zone Stonebrunt Mtns opened up and myself and 2 friends (a level 53 Shaman and 55 Warrior) decided to go check out this place. Well everything conned blue and higher to me and the other two a lot of green cons. We started out normal just running around checking things out. Then I hear those famous last words. &quot;So you guy's WANNA HAVE SOME FUN.&quot; I am thinking sure why not I am always up for fun and I am secure in my level. Well we went after a named mob in the zone that we say. Con: RED what would you like your TOMBSTONE to SAY. Maybe I should have taken the hint, but hey it is all in fun. Well Dax my warrior buddy starts hacking at it and I am shooting arrows and the occasional spell at it. Major resists. Well our Shammy went LD just as we get 3 adds. Hmmmm where is this going. I see over group chat Hey I am getting low on health from the Warrior. I am trying to heal but they are hitting him hard. Next thing I know I got major aggro and the Warrior dies. So with SoW on I am running like a little girl yelling HELP at the top of my lungs. I find the zone wall and think hmmmmm lets follow the zone wall and I will find the zone. Wrong I ended up falling one moment I am running the next I see those dreaded words LOADING PLEASE WAIT.......... Fell for 1,000 pts of damage. Well we decided after that lets head over to GFaydark. I needed the Ivy Rune off of the browny there and we did not want to die agian. Wrong we forgot the golden rule KNOCK on WOOD when you say this. We got the Rune and so did my wife for her Ranger. Then we got hit by 5 brownie scouts. I hear RUN over group chat. Well would have been nice to run if I was not rooted to the forest floor. I get stunned 3 times and during one of my turns in the circle I was doing I see my buddy Dax go down. Not cool when the tank that is level 55 goes down. Who was next. Yep you guessed it your fav Ranger Rauvin. I yelled over at the wife RUN NOW. She bolted and I died. Then the Shammie got it sqaure in the eyes. We all end up back at our bind points. So who is still alive I ask. My wife sitting across from me is typing and I can hear her say I am and I have no clue were I am. Over group chat we all see &quot;me&quot; in small letters and the following &quot;I am still alive and hiding, I have no clue where I am and I need help...DAX GEA RAUV I am going to kill you guys if you do not come get NOW.......<br><br>Well that was two death in one night, but I will never forget either one. Too look back on it now....I was pissed at the time, but now I cannot keep from laughing about it all.<br><br>I hope you all enjoyed my rambling and I hope you can share some of your memorable moments here on this BBS like forum.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Dec 21 03:45:00 2001</em><br>&nbsp;<br>May Karana Bless You All,<br><br>Rauvin Darkfeather<br>Protector of the Great Storm and Follower of Karana</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Awesome idea for a thread Rauvin. It deserved the excellent I gave it !<br><br>My most memorable death? Gee there's been so many. Okay, frontier mountains lev 33. Group DISBANDED on a bad pull of giants from the fortress, ran and left while a Chanter and I tried to keep some order. Well it was a losing battle. So being half dead, I decided to just run my buns off as far away from the chanter as possible, maybe try and save him. And my sow was still good. At least that part of the plan worked. I managed to outdistance the initial sg's, but dropped right into a pile of wanderers, who popped me a few times. So, on I ran very low on health. Still making distance though. Ran right into some wandering goblins. They popped my a few times, but I got away, just barely above one bub health I ran a few mins til I knew I was safe ( new to the zone I had no idea where the zone locs were ). I sat and camped out succesfully = ). Right after that I re-entered the world. Right next to a wandering casting goblin, He popped me, I ran, got some distance. Hitting my /loc hot key all the while becuase I was SO lost in this zone. &quot; Goblin soandso casts a spell on you &quot; dropped dead. &quot; Loading Please wait &quot; Which immediately goes to the server login screen ( yup got bumped from the server&nbsp;&nbsp;). BEFORE I could write down the loc of my actual death. Frustrated I went to bed. The next day I searched what must have been ALMOST been the entire zone, no luck, and no luck finding a necro or anyone who had stumbled across my corpse. On the search goes. Finally I give in and petition ( not thinking it would do any good, but, hey I DID use LOC before I died, not my fault I got bumped from the server ). I found a really cool one who hooked me up and waited by my corpse while I tracked her down. While looting, I got aggrod and was forced to run and camp out again. Re-entered the world started looting again, got aggrod, died. No prob I now had loc of corpse, bid my good day to the gm and started out again. Looted corpse, aggrod, died. 6th time is a charm right. Yup I finally looted and moved on. Needless to say it was a rough beginning to my Kunark experience. ( not to mention spiders killed me 3 times near FV and that named lizard caster looking thing nabbed me once ). Thank goodness for the overthere = ). That's my worst death<br><br>Montye<br>&nbsp;<br>True, cities have banks, but alas, I have no money. So why leave the comforts of the wild?</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I've got a couple to add to the mix.<br><br>The first was right after I'd gotten sixth level.&nbsp;&nbsp;Things were going well, I was about to get spells and I was getting about a blue and a half per level in exp.  I could still beat on a yellow and expect to come out on top.<br><br>Enter the undead ruins in Qeynos Hills.  They have some dreadbone skeletons that 90% of the characters in EQ would laugh at.  I was not yet at the point where I could laugh at them.  <br><br>I see three people trying a fighting withdrawl aginst these things, so being the helpful ranger that I am I jump in and start beating on them despite their red cons.  One by one my new found fellows fall before the dreadbones.  I'm the last on left and die, right over my newbie bind spot.  <br><br>LOADING PLEASE WAIT<br>A dreadbone skeleton hits YOU<br>A dreadbone skeleton hits YOU<br>A dreadbone Skeleton hits YOU<br>LOADING PLEASE WAIT<br>A dreadbone skeleton hits YOU<br>A dreadbone skeleton hits YOU<br>A dreadbone Skeleton hits YOU<br>LOADING PLEASE WAIT<br>A dreadbone skeleton hits YOU<br>A dreadbone skeleton hits YOU<br>A dreadbone Skeleton hits YOU<br>LOADING PLEASE WAIT<br>A dreadbone skeleton hits YOU<br>A dreadbone skeleton hits YOU<br>A dreadbone Skeleton hits YOU<br>LOADING PLEASE WAIT<br><br>It's fortunate for me that some kind soul noticed the slaughter of my continuing respawning self and managed to get the guards over to where I was so they could kill the skellies.  Not only was this the largest number of deaths in a row in EQ history it also put me from a couple of blues to 7th back down to just above 5th level.  Needless to say I was REALLY pissed and made it's my lifes work to get high enough to wipe out the entire ruins for an entire game day.  It took me about a week to get there.<br><br>The other memoral death was while I was in Kael Drakkel.  It wasn't during a raid, or a run to WL; I had managed to get the named dragon's tail from EW and was looking for Gleed to turn it in to get my Bow of the Huntsman.  Well I had spent four days killing dwarfs and tracking wolves in GD to get to dubious with the Kromrif; and due to many guild hunts in Skyshrine for guardian and sentry equipment I was warmly to the Kromzek.  <br><br>There is, however, a third faction I'd managed to neglect.  <br><br>I'd managed to track down Gleed and targeted the giant that I belived to be him.  I walk into the room he's in and WHAM!  I suddenly have four giants on me and die in about three quarters of a second.  <br><br>LOADING PLEASE WAIT<br><br>I'm bound in Kael, which is good because it means I don't have far to run naked.  So I manage to memorize spells, zone out to SOW and Camo myself, zone back and and start to where I belive my corpse is; beneath the feet of the supposedly benovelent giant who has my bow.  <br><br>About ten seconds into heading over camo drops.  I figure I didn't need it to get that far so I'd scout arround and see what killed me.  I'm standing on the bridge looking things over, my corpse is where I can see it, but out of range for pulling.  I con the nearby giants and manage to find the one who attacked me.  King Tormax faction makes an instant and ugly impression upon me.  Ready to Attack.  Not pretty.  I use my paltry sneak and hide skill to get close enough to grab my corpse and begin to drag it away from the killer giant.<br><br>Anyone who's spent some time in Kael knows that dragging a KOS corpse is a fast way to a faster death.  I hear the agro tag line of this giant and begin to run for it.  Unfortunitly I'm on a slippery bridge and can't get in purchase.  My corpse falls off the bridge down among the dire wolves below, and I follow it hoping that somehow pathing will save me.  I was wrong.  Four giants fall on top of me, bashing, kicking, stabbing, slashing and biting the entire time.  Now as I'm dying I manage to look up through the blood and brain tissue dripping down my face and see who standing before me raising a mace.  Gleed.  The giant I belived to be in the room across the bridge; he was standing below the bridge I'd twice crossed and twice died crossing, down among the dire wolves who now had two Ratslayer corpses to nibble on.  <br><br>LOADING PLEASE WAIT<br><br>I re-mem, re-buff, re-zone, re-sow, re-camo, re-zone, and re-head for my corpse.  I get there, cammo has, of course, dropped.  I see my corpse in the pit, and fortunitly the giants have all gone back to their spawn spots.  I loot my corpse, clean up my naked corpse and look up to see Gleed grinning at me warmly.  'You bastard,' I think to myself as I walk up to him to collect my bow.  I give him the tail, get the bow and am overjoyed.  Two deaths are worth the amazing piece of equipment I now posess.  <br><br>Here comes the memorable part.  I con Gleed.  He's a nice cheery blue, with no other giants arround and all the wolves milling about at the end of the pit they seem to enjoy so much.  I figure, 'What the hell, you only live thrice,' and let fly at him with my new, uber, procing bow.  What do I see as my arrow connects and he turns to come after me?<br><br>Your will is not sufficent to command this weapon.<br><br>So I'm running to the zone line with a bunch of giants after me, and I almost make it.  Almost.  <br><br>So there it is, hope you enjoy it, and learn from it.   Gleed is under the bridge, not across it.  He shoulda been a troll.<br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Great thread, here's my favorite death. One of the Ivy quests for my lvl 30 ranger required killing Slaythe the Slayer in Lower Guk, a live Froglok. I had been on a tear with my Ivy quests and figured I could continue my luck in Guk. <br><br>Not having been anywhere near Guk before, I decided I would wander there myself and get advice from those people camping the zone. When I get to Upper Guk the Frogloks conned indifferent to me, nice. So I am wandering around Upper Guk when I come across a 34 Warrior girl and ask her to lead me to Lower Guk. She does, but when I zone in, it is not the green cons from above but lots of yellow and reds. That would require lots of backup, so I decided to head home and wait for guild.<br><br>Just as I am leaving the warrior is mobbed and I decide to do the friendly thing and heal. Oh no, she kills the thing and I take a faction hit. Now I know getting out is going to be more painful.<br><br>I zone into Upper Guk and 95% of my track is green. So i start walking, and no froglok gives me a second look. But this tunnel isn't looking very familiar, and I proceed to walk into a room where there is a light blue con. He decides to play the hero, and his 2 green friends join in. <br><br>I have no idea why but I decide to evacuate even though they could barely hit me. I mean, I can find the way out or even a zone back into Lower Guk, right? So I just start running, with Sow I am twice as fast as these guys. But now, everything is aggroing me. With my speed and since they were mostly green, I honestly ran for like 5 minutes and picked up no less than 40 Forgloks. I was running so crazy I would double back and see frogloks I had aggroed earlier who had already given up on me.<br><br>Well, I finally ended up in a room full of casters and committed to a battle royale of me versus Upper Guk. Not pretty. The extraction of my corpse was another adventure, but all in all it was by far the most memorable death.<br><br>Moseby<br>Ranger of the 39th Season<br>Kindred Spirit Guardians<br>Druzzil Ro<br>&nbsp;<br>Moseby<br>Ranger of 43rd Season<br>Druzzil Ro</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Great idea for a thread Rauvin!<br><br>Hmmm, my most memorable death. I must admit, their are plenty to choose from. So here's a small sampling.<br><br>It's my first day in the game ever, and Lashara is a level 1 naked wood elf wandering around the Faydark. I had never played the game before, and my boyfriend was on the way to come help me get accustomed. He send me a tell. &quot;Just go down the lift to the newbie garden and hunt there. I'll be there in a few minutes.&quot; Newbie garden? Where's that? So I head down the lift and wander around for a bit. Suddenly...<br>An orc centurion hits YOU for 8 points of damage.<br>An orc centurion hits YOU for 3 points of damage.<br>I start running. I don't know where I'm going, but I'm running to get there. My first death, lying naked in the Greater Faydark with 4 cents beating on me, and without a CLUE as to where I died.<br>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br><br>-- <br><br>I'm about 12th level, and hunting somewhere in the Commons. A lion attacks me, and I was soloing. He cons yellow to me, but seeing as I was too far from the zone to run, I attack the lion. Five minutes later, the lion is laying dead at my feet. No without a lot of work, mind you. I am completely out of mana and have a total of around 6 hit points to my name. Whew! I said, and sat down in my safe spot to rest and recuperate. Suddenly....YOU have been hit for 3 points of damage! I look up from my book and there's the measly goblin who is so green to me it isn't funny, smashing on me because I am sitting in his seat. Under normal conditions I would have healed myself, but remember I am out of mana. I get the goblin down to half health before:<br>A goblin hits YOU for 6 points of damage!<br>YOU die!<br>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT....<br><br>Grrrrrr.<br>--<br><br>About 16 levels after this (level 28), Lashara is huting in the Frontier Mountains. Or she was. Being over-encumbered, and out of arrows, she decides to make the long, and dangerous trek bck to the city of Firiona Vie. All goes well until she actually enters the FV zone. It is twilight, the time of day when the drachnids are most abundant. Our ranger casts Camo on herself (SoW was still up) and starts running along the bank of the river, conning each mob to make sure it can't see her. And then, about halfway to FV....<br><br>&quot;You feel yourself starting to appear.&quot;<br><br>The words that poured out of my mouth at that point are not found in any dictionary. Two seconds later I am no longer invisible, and about 20 drachnids have their attention focused solely on me. I start to run.<br>At the end of the river, by the big Iksar statue, I see an Iksar standing there. Wishing to warn of him the huge string of trouble following me, and perhaps enlist some help, I do a /yell. As I run by, I notice his name is Vekis. And then....<br><br>Vekis begins to cast a spell.<br>You have been hit by non-melee for 665 points of damage!<br>He was a level 56 NPC Iksar Necromancer.<br><br>By now, I am in big sh*t. But with SoW on I am starting to outdistance the drachnids and they haven't rooted me. I run past the guards to the bridge, and breathe a sigh of relief. I am safe.<br><br>WRONG.<br><br>Pain and suffering tries to strike YOU, but misses!<br>YOU die!<br>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br><br>In my terrfied flight across the map, one of the drachnids has poisoned me.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Mine was in Crushbone around level 15.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was grouping in the throne room when someone pulled a tower train consisting of Crush, D'Vinn and their cronies.  We were already in wild melee with all the legos and whatnot in the throne room.  Bam, Bam, Bam - three group memebrs die and everyone starts to run.  I ran striaght for the window and jumped right out.  Problem was I was sowed and not too used to the speed yet.  I ran straight at the moat and fell in.  The huge train followed the others to the zone, so I was safe for a moment.  Well, my swimming was already pretty good, but I couldn't get up that damn ladder.  I kept getting to the top and falling back in.  Soon I see the other two groups members died before they reached the zone, so, of course the entire gang of orcs is heading back to take care of me along with everthing else they pick up along the way.  D'vinn was the first to jump in the water with me.  I began to swim.  Being sowed and a pretty good swimmer, I began to out pace him.<br><br>The problem was I was also aggroing evrything along the topside of the moat.  By now the rest of the train had jumped in the moat.  I knew I was going to die when I got back to the ladder in front (I swam all the way around), so I took a great screen shot of me with about 30 orcs and D'vinn swimming after me.  Too bad I lost that picture, it was a classic.  LOADING......<br><br>When I got back I jumped in to retrieve my corpse.  There were a million tells going around and /ooc and group talk and I wasn't paying attention to my air meter.  LOADING......two corpses.  Same spot.  <br><br>I waited awhile and went back again.  Jumped in and began looting the first corpse.  For some bizarre reason Crush was still swimming in the moat and proceeding to beat on me.  Once again I couldn't get up the ladder.  LOADING......three corpses.  Same spot.<br><br>The good thing was the next time I went back D'Vinn's corpse was laying on the path.  Nobody was around, and I looted it.  Dragoon Dirk!  WOOT.  First half decent drop I got in EQ.  Looted my three corpses and I lived to fight another day.<br>&nbsp;<br>Judd Jaggedoak <br>(deceased)<br>Wood Elf Ranger<br><br><br><br><br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ok, you all are gonna find this one funny as hell. I was in EW in guild chat tellin em whats going on as I am pulling and fear kiting Tundra Wooly Mammoths, one kill from making 47th lvl. <br><br>I shoot a lone mammoth and run back to coastline and sow drops. Well not paying attention I snare myself. I don't worry cuz I can snare and fear the mammoth. The only problem now is that the fear is being resisted 4 times in a row. Finally fear sticks and Im tearing up the mammoth but the third time the fear is resisted 4 times again. I am backing up and as you know the coastline in EW is cliff I fall for a total of 374dmg. As I climb my way up that mammoth is tearing me up for another 280dmg. I get back up and fear the mammoth by this time my health is below half with damage from falling and fear being resisted but I have mammoth below 1 bub so I say self we can come out on top. Well fear is resisted 2 times again. I am thinking damn I better run and sow myself. So I get distance back and SoW well as SoW lands his snare breaks and bam I get hit and stunned fall off the cliff again hehe Im below 1 bub of health.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I get fear off low on mana from dots and fearing cant cast heal. So I think to myself I should be able to kill it. I start tearing up as it breaks fear early and bam LOADING PLEASE WAIT comes up. As you know 46th is after a hell level.  Well you lose a ton of experience during that level. <br><br>While in Thurgadin I get a cool cleric that says drag ya corpse to GD zone and I will rez hehe 100pp later Im back killing not just one more tundra mammoth but end up having to kill 2 to get 47th finally.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Thanks to all that posted to this one. I am so happy I finally made Sage status and it is all due to you guys liking some of my posts. THANK YOU ALL.....<br><br>Alas the whole reason I came up with this post is due to a friend ((Daxargen)) asking me what my most memorable death was due to my level. Trust me I have had may and every time I die I am pretty upset, but find the humor in it when it is brought up later on. Had another one happen to my cleric friend today.<br><br>We were hunting in Dawnshroud Peaks. I was playing my wifes Ranger and we were trying to level. Her to 33, the cleric to 32. Well we got him to DING to 32 and killed a white con to be safe. We went back into the little building to zone back over to Netherbian Liar. He and I were both OOM. Well someone decided not to yell or shout out that he was pulling three of those nasty little shrooms through to the zone. All I saw was Oh crap and I went LD. He got nailed by all three of em and lost a whole yellow bubble of health. He was laughing about it when I called him. He told me that is the 10th time that he has gotten level 32 and lost it. Guess level 30,35,40,45,50,55 are not the only h*ll levels......<br><br>Thank you all for reading this post and making me and my wife chuckle at some of your most memorable deaths...<br>&nbsp;<br>May Karana Bless You All,<br><br>Rauvin Darkfeather<br>Protector of the Great Storm and Follower of Karana</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Okay fellow forest protector's I pose a serious question to all. In this day and age I find a lot of my friends on EQ are somewhat higher then me right now. I have been offered Ubra Gear from them and they have tried to hook me up with that cool sword that is 1 HS and does 12 to 13 damage and only delays for 26, but I am a roleplayer at heart and love to quest for my gear. So without further ado.<br><br>Do you or are you twinked at this time and what are your thoughts on twinking?<br><br>Now my thoughts are I would rather have my guild or friends that I can group with go get that Ubra item cuz it is more memorable for me. If given the chance I say no whenever someone tries to give me an ubra weapon or hook me up with a lot of cool gear. To me it takes away from the game.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>No, I am not twinked, and very proud of it. Like you, I have turned down weapons and armor that I did not earn.<br>My problem with twinking is not when someone twinks a warrior, for example, but when they twink a class that takes an additional amount of skill, that's when things go downhill fast. <br><br>For example, take your typical twinked, PL'd ranger. A ranger's role changes drastically at least twice in the character's lifetime from 1 to 60. As Cannis mentioned when twinked, your character's skills will suffer, making your character a paper tiger...they will look tough, but their skills will not be able to live up to the look. Just as important, is that the person behind the keyboard's skills will not have had time to grow with the demands of the class.<br><br>A ranger who has not learned how to root-park, pull, gain and shed aggro, or kite properly is a ranger who will let his group down when those skills are required. It is those rangers who give all rangers a bad name.<br><br>That being said, not all twinks are unfamiliar with the class, or are not uber-twinks who did not have to learn to survive.<br><br><br>The following has nothing to do with being a ranger on Everquest:<br><br>As far as your addendum or how we should rate people, Rauvin, if someone expresses their opinion, that is their right. If that opinion contains bad advice, then I will rate it accordingly, that is my right. <br>It is a free country, but this board is a benign dictatorship. You and I signed away our American right to free speech when we joined the site, and agreed to follow Allakhazam's rules.<br>The purpose of this board is to &quot;Post your strategies on how to best play and develop the Ranger&quot;. People come here for advice, if that advice is flawed, or even worse, downright wrong, it is our duty to rate that mis-information poorly, so others who are looking for advice are not misled.<br>Sorry for the redirect, but I think it needed to be said with all the talk about &quot;ratings&quot; around here lately.<br><br>V<br>&nbsp;<br>True satisfaction can only be gained through the hunt.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Vindicarre it has been my exp once you hit the hell levels if you have an uber weapon your weapon skills will still be maxed.&nbsp;&nbsp;At levels before 20th level twinking with high damage low delay weapon is more detrimental but above 30th I don't see it as such a big problem mainly due to the mobs hps start to increase dramatically.  <br><br>As far as learning the role of the ranger, yes that comes with progression through levels but also comes more into play when you group. I found after soloing most of the time from 15th till 24th level hurt me more as I did not truly know the what a ranger should or should not do in group. After 8 levels spent in groups I learned through trial and error what to do and not to do.<br>As for my progression from 32-47th I learn that role from message boards like this one, Rangers Glade and other high level Rangers I know and through personal experience. <br><br>For those soloing rangers out there remember to group because at higher levels in order to achieve the worthwhile rewards you will need groups to do it. Building friendships is what makes this game really worthwhile in my opinion and working well in groups is the most important skill you can develop.<br>&nbsp;<br>Cannis 50th Ranger<br>Razer 43rd Sk<br>Jeetkundo 20th Monk<br>Mikaraz 27th Warrior<br>Taranthian 30th Necro</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Grouping seems to be the meat and potatoes of EverQuest. And getting a good group is essential to your non-frustrated, fast leveling, enjoyment of Everquest. So how does a ranger make him/herself appealing to groups? We aren't great healers, or tanks, and we certainly can't mez the mob. And most people consider us the accessory class, once you have tank, healer and crowd control? So how does the group seeking ranger make sure that s/he gets picked to go into that fifth or sixth slot? Simple. You be the best group member you can be. And here's how.<br><br>1. Offer to pull. Outside of the monk, you are the best puller your group can have. Have Harmony and Snare up. Harmony first, then Snare. If you have SoW on, run backwards to your group firing arrows at the mob all the way. Stop. Flame lick. Stop. Attack. Wait til the mob is at 1/4 health. Rinse. Repeat. And here's a hint. Use 3rd person view from behind with the camera panned about halfway back. That way, while running backwards, you can still see where you're going and any incomming adds. You'll have eyes in the back of your head! (Literally).<br>2. Know your buffs. Druids get almost every buff you can offer. EXCEPT Feet Like Cat. This is an AGI boost that helps everyone get hit less. Make sure it's on everybody. Shamans get it too, but they may be reserving their gems for other spells. Offer it. Chances are, people will want it. If you don't have a druid, keep Skin and a Damage Shield on the tanking members. And make sure everyone has STR on (chanter STR is best, but shaman's and druids have their own strength spells so ask first to save mana - yours OR theirs).<br>3. Keep good tabs on your aggro. You want to be lower than the warriors on the aggro list, but above the rogues and the casters. And know how to get your aggro up quickly if the mob turns on someone you want him to leave alone. Flame lick and Snare are major aggro uppers. Taunt works well if paired with poor faction.<br>4. Know how to use /assist. You -should- be the main puller, but if for some reason you aren't, keep your target on whoever's pulling and macro a key for /assist. What this does: It makes you auto-attack whatever the puller is attacking when you press the button. This makes life much easier for enchanters who are trying their hardest to mez one of the mobs, and can't find one that someone in the group isn't beating on. (Very frustrating).<br>5. Appreciate your healers!!!! You'd be very suprised how often healers get left out of the loot cycle because they're so busy staring at their spell books and making sure they have enough mana to save your ass when things turn ugly. If you notice your healer seems to be getting the short end of the stick, send him/her a tell and offer to loot for him/her and split on a regular basis. They -do- appreciate it! Remember, without your healer, you are quite seriously DEAD MEAT.<br>6. Use root. Got an add? Use root. Caster getting beaten on? Use root. Someone's running around in circles and everyone else is trying to yank to mob off him or her because that member is dying? Use root. Need to make some aggro fast? Use root. Need a head start while you run for the hills? Use root. Looking to break the chanter's mez on that last mob? Use root. Any questions?<br>7. In group tell, when you join and when any other group member joins, state plainly to the group. &quot;If you are a caster and something aggros on you....scream!&quot; And when it happens.....cause it will... drop EVERYTHING and see number 6. Use root and aggro that mob!<br>8. Remember that your death proves nothing. If you are getting smashed around, back off and let someone else take a little bit of the heat. Even a caster if need be. If the whole group is going down, you should be among the first to die. However, in a fight that could go either way, you are more useful to your group alive, maybe healing and firing off arrows, than as a smear on the turf. Remember that.<br>9. Maintain a positive attitude and a good outlook, and be helpful whereever you can. If something went terribly wrong and you died, instead of freaking out and screaming at your group, offer to bring them food and water from the local city. The right outlook can make all the difference. <br><br>And finally, something I highly recommend to everyone.<br><br>Start at least one character of every class, and play that class til level 10. If you don't have time for every class, try a cleric, a bard and an enchanter as top priority. Understanding the role that a class plays in a group is crucial to appreciating them as a group member. Maybe it seems that the cleric is whining about not getting enough loot, but until you've played a cleric, you don't realize how often they get left out. Maybe you don't understand why the enchanter keeps screaming &quot;Use /assist you bunch of morons!&quot; Play one til level 8 and you will understand. Bards just seem to work differently than any other class (and I've played them all) and that's why I recommend playing them too.<br><br>Good grouping, rangers!<br>&nbsp;<br>Lashara Dyran<br>"Little Miss Bow & Arrows"<br>Keeper of the wolves<br>Ranger of the 34th sun <br>Lanys T'Vyl</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I agree with most of your post but 1 never pull with snare the group will hate you when you take long to bring mob to em. Snare should only be used towards the end of the fight so you don't gain agro if your not the main tank. Nothing irritates the tank than a ranger or monk pulling agro from em. <br><br>On point 6 if you get multiple adds snare flamelick and kite till your group is ready to pull one from you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Druid could do same thing but its better for you to do it because if situation deteriorates the druid can port the group out.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Dec 21 11:59:30 2001</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Cannis 50th Ranger<br>Razer 43rd Sk<br>Jeetkundo 20th Monk<br>Mikaraz 27th Warrior<br>Taranthian 30th Necro</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Cannis;<br><br>Here's why I disagree. First of all I write all my posts for people 30 or under, because I've never experienced 30+ so I can't speak. These people do not have SoW (unless they get it from someone else, and even then some mobs run insanely fast) so kiting multiple adds sets you up for a world of hurt. I find it much more efficient to root an add before it hits the party. That way he can't hurt anybody, and if you do have a chanter, he'll have an easier time putting a mez/charm on the thing.<br><br>On the snare pulling and why I recommend it. Well, firstly, I do mostly short pulls from smaller camps. I don't pull for very long distances. So the time difference between snare vs. no snare is minimal. Secondly, I find if you time your pulls right, the group never notices how long you take to get a mob to them because you're already luring the next one in by the time they've finished the first. And lastly, I have never had a group complain about my pulling methods, so I don't think they -hate- it. The bonus of being able to run backwards and fire arrows at the mob during your pull is two-fold. One, you are doing damage. (Always good). Secondly, you are continually working your Archery skill, which can be a bugger to get up. Never had a problem with the tank not being able to taunt him off me. In fact, the only problem I -have- encountered with snare pulling is the increased risk of a wandering mob aggro-ing because of wandering into your slower moving prey.<br><br>Other than that, it's all been gravy.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lashara Dyran<br>"Little Miss Bow & Arrows"<br>Keeper of the wolves<br>Ranger of the 34th sun <br>Lanys T'Vyl</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ok I understand where your coming from now but I was going by your level. You have SoW so there is no need to snare pull once you have SoW. I hunted in Frontier Mountain, Overthere, Eastern Wastes and Dreadlands from 28th-45th respectively, these all being outdoor zones so I was designated puller. I found that the faster you pull the more the group wanted you. I would leave to pull at 1 bub from the mobs death to get another but if you have 4 groups in area pullin mobs tend to thin out quickly along with ks that can occur from a long pull.&nbsp;&nbsp;So my point is that snare is not a good way to pull post 30. You will be pulling from distances in those zones.<br><br>Once you get in Overthere, Dreadlands group you will find what the group demands of a chain puller.  As far as tank pulling agro you will find as I did that takes a while for the tank to build up enough agro to keep the mob off you its not so bad at lower levels but at higher levels pulling mob agro off you will get harder for tanks.  (CoM comes to mind here 49sk 51 monk and 45 rogue and me 42 ranger...Ranger gets beat down harmony/snare pulling...CH for Ranger CH for Ranger CH for ranger) I am of the belief that you form your habits early, I use to snare at beginnings or middle of fights and have moved to end of fight due to damage inflicted on me till tank could build agro.<br><br>Trust me on this one, your world is going to change radically over the next few levels. This where the techniques of agro control start to come into play.<br><br>As for kiting multiple adds I was assuming outdoor scenario with no enchanter and assuming more than one add. For 1-2 adds ghetto mez is perfectly viable way to take care of them its just when you have more than that I found kiting away from group is best for me, easy to do with SoW (practice archery) you can keep agro at will (flamelick/snare)and if things go bad the group can escape. The point being is that your group lives even if you do not, making ranger look like hero...therefore increasing our public image...which leads to /ooc Group looking for Ranger levels 30-35.<br><br>If I came across as attacking your post I apologize I sometimes don't state things in the most diplomatic way. I will try to do better in the future.<br>&nbsp;<br>Cannis 50th Ranger<br>Razer 43rd Sk<br>Jeetkundo 20th Monk<br>Mikaraz 27th Warrior<br>Taranthian 30th Necro</td></tr>
