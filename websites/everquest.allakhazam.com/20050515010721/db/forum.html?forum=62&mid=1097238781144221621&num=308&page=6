I have had players in game think im a jerk, but hey i have my off days and ive tried to make things right with them, cause im a very cool guy. This is just a game, has nothing to do with real life, and shouldn't effect it. Some poeple think im Very skilled some poeple think im a mean. So i just wanted to say, I'm sorry to anyone and everyone, that if in game i was rude or mean to you. Its a shame when Poeple IRL like Anonymous take grudges against other players and do things like Harass people in real life, but You just have to remember these poeple need help socialy cause the Game is all they have, Forgive them and move on. cause if you have faith in things you do you know what is real and what isn't.This is supposed to be fun, gonna chill out. As for anything else, i agree that everyone feels differently about players, Clelond is very cool guy, known him for {long time} but maybe you caught him on a 'off day'. It's pointless to come on and beg people to blist someone who was rude to you cause in the end, IRL that person could be very cool and nice in game to someone else on another time.<br><br>Anyways, Peace out, Have fun, Its just a game.<br><br><i><span class="sm">Edited, Wed Mar&nbsp;&nbsp;2 19:59:36 2005 by theysayimcrazy</span class="sm"></i></p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br />Jobs: SMN 60, BLM 37, WHM 37 WAR 30 PLD 15<br>(Do you need any help?)</td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8">Posting from NYC</td></tr></table>

Stop whining and get over it. You got everyone killed in BCNM, everyone thought you were a noob and blisted you.<br>You got mad at me and other camper cause we were camping Spook when you were farming for your little gil selling trade in. Everyone on LS knows your a gil seller, You admit to it on game just on this board do you deny it, and that is the 100% Truth.<br>Locodawg thought you were a stupid player as a PLD refusing to tank (huh!?). Everey page on this forum you complain and whine about pety things plasyers do. You shout in jeuno that playerrs are noobs. You come on board bitchiung about how people arent good enuff when you allways sub NIN in parties as a PLD, which is why you only made it to lvl 30. You call everyone a noob, Spam /check and /slap emotes on them. Get mad when people &quot;get in the way of you gil selling&quot;. You deleted your character cause you knew others knew about this. And you will reply to this message i bet just like you allways do, You say you wont but you do cause you know your a liar and cant be trusted. Players will NOT let you get in the way of them having fun john. Im sorry, but wehave other things to do then worry about a gillselling PLD/NIN who ALLWAYS gets people killed in bcnm, i really am sorry your revenge scheme didnt work on me, but as i said. As another player of final fantasy IX i have better things to do then bicker and bitch like a child with someone who feels so insecure with ones reputation to pose as someone else.<br><br>Peace out kiddo, I hope on your new server you wont gil sell, pose as someone else and or spam emotes then go online and whine about how people resent you.<br><br><br>THIS GAME IS FOR FUN! THIS ISNT REAL LIFE. Its 100% Entertianment and i know this is all you have in your real life, but i wont allow you to ruin my gaming experience with your lies, acts of &quot;revenge&quot; etc etc. I know you'll reply to this so i wont say 'farewell&quot;<br><br>Peace out, have fun, play nice!</p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br />Jobs: SMN 60, BLM 37, WHM 37 WAR 30 PLD 15<br>(Do you need any help?)</td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8">Posting from NYC</td></tr></table>

I was training mobs in Palborough and had about 20 around me. Some BLM ran by and cast stonega on the quads, and almost all of them swarmed him, ruined him, then returning to getting killed by me. By the time I was done I was floating around 20 MP, so I rested a bit, and the dead BLM demanded I raise him. I rest up to 40, refresh, and tell him he'll have to wait.<br><br>I sorta raised him. You know. I was casting the spell then moved and it cancelled before it went off. Oops &gt;:] I let it go off after he finally shut up in tells. I wander off, back to mining, leaving him there...he hadn't &quot;allowed himself to be revived&quot; yet. I come back around a few minutes later...the quads in the room respawned. He finally accepts the raise and gets up, and starts to REST. Surrounded by quads. They make their lil sound, turn, and whap him back down.<br><br>He HPs. I mine about my business. Nobody else is upstairs, so I start another train. I get a tell in the middle of it all:<br><br>[GM]something: I received a complaint concerning an repeated MPK...care to explain?<br><br>I proceed to explain how the BLM was fundamentally retarded. I said it was my mobs that killed him the first time, but he got their attention on his own. Because those monsters definitely killed him over and over, but of his own doing. Anyway, it goes on for a bit, which really cuts into my mining and farming.<br><br>Anyway, the moral of the story is later on he tried to train mobs onto me and warp away. Except the quads beat some spell interruption into him, and he sort of just died.

I am truly sorry that this happened but are you sure you have the right person?  Everything you've said up to this post might have been believable until you said that he started to &quot;talk sh*t.&quot;<br><br>You must have the wrong player, this isn't the Tryst that is in my linkshell nor the one that I went to college with, and since there can only be one Tryst per server, there must have been some confusion.  Please don't confuse players in blacklist stories and defame the wrong people, this is an online community and reputations matter.<br><br>But seriously Willow, claiming half of Giddeus as your own still does sound a little sketchy.  If the mob is yellow, it's free to claim, it's stupid, I agree, but the system works like that, and it makes it so that no one player can claim an entire area for this exact reason.<br><br>Willow I believe you wrote this on December 7th in response to someone else blacklisting someone for this exact reason you blacklisted Tryst:<br><br><blockquote><b id="fs8">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />I hate to break it to you, but you don't own the Tomb area just by farming there. Sure, great, you're working hard. So are other people. If you're killing things that you wouldn't even get a notable amount of XP for, especially none, then you don't have any right to comaplain if somebody else kills them. If you're there first, fine, good, but he can still hunt in the same area. You don't have any special claim there for ALL the mobs. <br><br>By the sounds of things, he was there first. And you showed up, and started telling him what he could and couldn't kill. Nothing gives you that right. <br><br>Nothing annoys me more than when I'm hunting in an area and some jackass comes in, and accuses me of &quot;stealing his mobs&quot; when I get something dead. It isn't your zone, especially if you were not there first.<hr size="1" /></blockquote><br><br><i><span class="sm">Edited, Fri Mar 11 14:47:24 2005 by Tiaan</span class="sm"></i></p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br />~Tiaan<br>Remora<br>73BLM/WHM/RDM {sky}= O {moon}= O Optical Hat = O<br>71DRK/THF&nbsp;&nbsp;       Tavnazian Archipelago = O<br>53WAR/THF<br>38WHM/BLM<br>37THF/WAR<br>37RDM/BLM/WHM</td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8"></td></tr></table>

I was farming where Willow said I was.  I did banishga his mobs.  I also had an argument with him.  However, there are a few facts that have seemingly been omitted or skewed.<br><br>1.  I DID NOT follow Willow around.  I happened upon ONE of his trains that I did Banishga ONCE, NO MORE.<br><br>2.  I called Willow oblivious after banishing ONE of his trains, because he seems to have not noticed that he had picked off a few of the yags off of MY trains.  I never boasted near any other players, seeing as Willow and I only spoke in /tell.  <br><br>3.  Willow is upset and is willing to blacklist me over ONE YAGUDO NECKLACE.<br><br>4.  I had only responded with an &quot;lol&quot; after being slapped, not poked, because I did not clearly remember who Willow was, and that is probably because I immediately tried to forget his name after he cursed and swore at me.<br><br>  I am sorry if I have caused any inconvenience to anyone, especially Tiaan for having to try to defend her friend.  I do feel that I should apologize to Willow for retalliating in a rude manner unfitting of me and my ls.  However, this is a game, and I will promptly and assuredly forget this misshap ever occured because I am here to have fun.<br><br><i><span class="sm">Edited, Fri Mar 11 17:14:23 2005 by RemoraTryst</span class="sm"></i></p></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8"></td></tr></table>

Sure, great, you're working hard. So are other people. If you're killing things that you wouldn't even get a notable amount of XP for, especially none, then you don't have any right to comaplain if somebody else kills them. If you're there first, fine, good, but he can still hunt in the same area. You don't have any special claim there for ALL the mobs. <br><br>By the sounds of things, he was there first.

Nothing gives you that right. <br><br>Nothing annoys me more than when I'm hunting in an area and some jackass comes in, and accuses me of &quot;stealing his mobs&quot; when I get something dead.

That all the mobs were his to kill, whether or not he made actions on them or no. It wasn't over a mob that was already being trained. I don't care if somebody else is in the same zone as I am, trying to get mobs. I do however care if they wait to pick off the mobs that I gathered together. They want to start their own train, that's fine. I don't care. But they can get their OWN train. I don't run back and forth, collecting all the yagudo together into a small area to kill quickly just so some schmuck comes by and takes advantage of my efforts.</p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br />→↓↘ⓟ</td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8">Posting from Deep within my thoughts....</td></tr></table>

When I'm in Valkurm Dunes, and I see someone training gobs down near Konschtat, I'll /t them with this message.  &quot;Kill them now, or I'm going to.&quot;  I do this for the lower levels who now don't have any prey, because of this high level.  If you wish to train lizzies then go up near D-6 where the only parties are taking out goblins, and don't mind so much if you're taking out lizards.  In King Ranperre's Tomb, I've taken an entire train of Mouse Bats off of someone, they way I see it, if there is more than one person farming bats in that same confined area, it's a little more courteous to, rather than train them, nuke them one by one.  Gives everyone a chance to get their share, without fighting and stealing each others trains.  I'd like to point out, that 90%-95% of the time, when I /t someone with that, they do proceed to kill their train, even if it's a WAR, and he has to melee them to death, if I see him ending his quest for a larger and larger train, I'll leave his mobs go, and even throw out Pro II, Shell II and Haste on him.  Pretty much, just be considerate.  Especially when you're farming mobs that lower levels could very well be killing to gain experience.  When you have every mob in the zone on you, because you're &quot;Leveling up shield skill,&quot; you're not allowing any additional mobs to spawn.  I ran into this in Fort Ghelsba, where a Mithra had trained every single Orc in all of Fort Ghelsba, up near Warchief, and was training her shield skill.  A couple of my LS friends were trying to level, and she threatened MPK if they touched any of &quot;her orcs.&quot;  I promptly switched to WHM, and headed over.  I /t'd her and said by keeping all these mobs up here alive, you're robbing these people of any chance to gain experience.  She just kept on complaining, so Banishga II, Elemental Seal Waterga, Stonega, Banishga II took care of everything.  <br><br>Pretty much, I'm just trying to say that we need to be courteous to others when we're farming our mobs.  It's fine normally, go to a corner of the zone where not too many people are, and for God's sake, if you're training Yags, and a Lv. 12 takes ONE off of your train, simply because it's Decent Challenge, and he needs experience, don't berate him for it.  I'm sure you can live with one less Yagudo.  And how do you avoid this?  Kill off your train, and start over, or simply kill one by one.

Quite frankly, I can also understand why he would then go and kill all the mobs she had trained.<br><br>Added to that, she threatened to MPK anyone that touched 'her' mobs.  That, in itself, is a moronic threat.  If she's high enough level to train some Orcs, she can do it in an area that less people frequent.  She also didn't have to train the whole camp, and tell people to back off... it's selfish, and the people that <i>can</i> level there are inconvenienced.<br><br>As Simp pointed out, the more mobs left alive in a huge train, the less monsters other people can kill, which means they won't respawn until the person leading the train has had their fun- at everyone else's expense.<br><br>Don't get me wrong- I'm not against making a train and killing them off.  However, everything has its place.  Making a train in an area that you know lower levels often use to level is okay, provided you leave sufficient mobs for them to attack.<br><br>Also, I've noticed that some people get very touchy when you take one or two mobs that they've trained.  I understand that they pulled it first- but if I spend 10 minutes looking for one thing to kill, because some self-important moron has taken everything out of that zone and <i>refuses to kill any of them</i>, they don't need all of those mobs.  In my opinion, the best train-makers make a big train quickly, and <b>kill</b> the train quickly.  I personally feel that most people that train an entire zone do so just to show off that they can make a bigass train- not because they need to.<br><br>Another point- I've seen several occasions where someone makes a massive train and runs around an area, where they show off how much they can pull.  Not understanding the principles of hate well, they keep pulling new mobs without ensuring the old ones still have enough hate.  As a result, when they pass the lower-level players (who might live on a 1-on-1 fight), they break away from the train, and kill the low-lvls.  And in each case (I have seen it about 4 or 5 times), they responded that it wasn't their fault- that everyone shuold have known to stay out of the way.  How can people stay out of the way of a massive group running all over a zone?<br><br>Finally, can we please get past this bickering?  The Black List thread, as we have already seen, has enough personal attacks in it- and it didn't help those two people either.  Most readers got tired and frustrated of the constant back-and-forth.

I'm sorry I don't know much about training stuff at lower levels for farming or skill up for low weapon skill since I have only do it once (or twice) and don't really like it. But here is what I know:<br><br>#1 As long as the name is not in purple and anyone else that is not in your party or alliance can attack then it is not &quot;your&quot; mob even if it is attacking you and/or your party. You have no right of what so ever to claim that one is yours. This is true for ANY stituation in cluding: <br>-Bst charm various pets to fight NM (the NM purple name dissappears 2~4sec after charm) and being claimed by another party.<br>-Exp party in an area that has a small/limited amount of monsters and someone (or a group) come up and kill everything in the area (for whatever reason: coffer, bst exp, skill up, fun...).<br>-A player claim a monster that another player trying to claim even if it's intentional (ie. follow someone and provoke/dia whatever he tries to attack).<br><br>#2 Everyone has equal rights. Everyone has the rights to skill up, gain exp, gain money... etc. A bst will have the right to exp in 'any' area he wants as long as he doesn't MPK anyone (accidentally or intentionally). A player will have the right to attack any train/mob that is not claimed (in purple/red name) no matter who or how other people are training them. A high level will have to the right to kill a low level monster to skill up (or just for fun) even if an exp party is trying to earn exp from it.<br><br>Those are strictly defined &quot;rules&quot; (mechanism) that have been designed for the game and everyone of us has to agree unless we can force/ask the game designers to change it. But there is a moral factor that is not counted in those. A lv50 killing Lizzards in Valkurm Dunes for fun/skill up knowing fully well that there are lv12~14 parties trying to earn exp on those because they don't know anything else to kill is morally wrong. The lv50 has a many options on what to skill up on (ie. many other zones that are not occupied by exp parties) while the exp party has very limited choices. A player trying to 'steal' a mob that has become unclaimed (due to charm/attacking a train...etc) knowing fully well that the other player have been fighting/claiming it for a while is also morally wrong.<br><br>So I think in this case: <br>-Tryst is (morally) wrong for trying to claim/attack the train made by Willow knowing fully well that a portion of it is originally claimed (or attacked) by Willow. The very fact that you trying to re-claim the mobs that have been accidentally attacked by Willow is a good enough reason.<br><br>-Willow is wrong (not about moral) claiming that the whole train is his when it is not due to the game mechanism that you can't claim more than 1 mob for long.<br><br>-The mithra in the Outpost is wrong (by the rules of the game agreed upon playing) because she threatens someone (harassment) and attempting to MPK (even though she haven't commited it). She is also wrong (same reason as Willow) for claiming monsters that she's not claiming (technically).<br><br>-Chakrila is being rude for slapping someone who don't know well and/or he doesn't know you. You are morally wrong for skilling up on the lizards knowing fully well that there are exp parties near by trying to gain exp on them. You do have the option to skill up in another area (such as Buburimu, Jugner or Passhow.. etc) and you choose not to do so. You're also morally wrong for telling a lie that you '/poke' Tryst but you actually '/slap' him. Whether it is a large or small telling a lie like that makes you look like a scamer (even if you aren't), is that right?<br><br><i><span class="sm">Edited, Thu Mar 17 13:38:20 2005 by kenki</span class="sm"></i></p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br /><a href="http://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?8953" target="akztarg">http://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?8953</a><br>War 65, Mnk 60, Rng 55, Brd 40, Bst 37, Whm 40, Nin 33, Thf 36...

Then when everyone started running low, and we called and gathered for escape, she decided to instead continue nuking for three tier-two spells, until she didn't have ENOUGH for escape. Then, she complained that the only reason, aside from her blowing her MP on attacking instead of getting everyone out, was because I hadn't refreshed her instead of picking up backup healing.<br><br>Then she wouldn't shut up in /tell, trying to pass the blame to me. She said she didn't HAVE to rest between battles, and she had priority for refresh over myself and the white mage, despite us having two black mages. She also refused to not negate my Dia II with Bio II over and over, despite us having a skilled blink tank.

When I asked why he was doing this - was he pissed at us taking a farming spot, did he had a problem with one or more memebers of my party he politely told me no, that he was simply bored and wanted to have fun.<br><br>So, with the exception of mpking, then the harassment the next day, I can see why you would think him a good, polite player.  I can only tell you what I had experienced.<br><br>If you see a black-haired male Elvaan named Jaaspeh in armor in a party, then I suppose he's fine - seeing him run around the jungle in nothing but the default Elvaan clothing, his info set to /anon and with a couple of goblin smithys trailing behind him all I ask is that you, as his friend, try explaining to him that his boredom shouldn't be alleviated at the expense of others.  I'm sure there was an eco-warrior or an expeditionary force that was looking for members - he could have joined them instead.<br><br>- Ma'at</p></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8">Posting from Soviet Canuckistan</td></tr></table>

While waiting for our disconnected pally to reconnect, Tenakajr pulls a gob to our camp, takes the time to position it in between our mages and melees, then casts sleep on it.  I knew right away what he was doing, and told him in /say and my party what he was doing and that I was going to call a GM.  <br><br>I then headed to the zone as well as Tenakajr.  When we got through the zone, I told Tenakajr I was going to call a GM on him and report it.  He told me he didn't care and that it was his first time doing what he did.  I then returned to camp and not 3 minutes later he attempted to MPK us again, while I was speaking to the GM about what had happened.  This time he almost got the gob to us, but died while trying to cast sleep on the gob a third time after being interrupted twice.  We all were ok since the gob returned to its spawn area.  I gave a shout to let everyone in the area know what he had done so they would have a warning to stay away from this individual.<br><br>*Edit spelling and capitializationz*<br><br><i><span class="sm">Edited, Mon Mar 28 16:52:19 2005 by xModeratorx</span class="sm"></i></p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br />Server: Remora<br>Name: Moderator<br>Nation: San d' Oria<br>Race: Elvaan</td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8">Posting from Maryland</td></tr></table>

It wasn't anything too serious but it was annoying to say the least.<br><br>I was seeking with a comment and flag up, and I had clearly written in my comment 'No Blind Invites' and '{/tell} {Please check it.} {Thank You.}'. So, maybe ten minutes after seeking, I get an invite from Tenakajr. I figure I'll ask the person what the party setup is, so I send him a /tell politely asking exactly that. He flat-out refused to reveal the lineup and told me I had to join or not; Naturally, I declined the invite. After that, I got a swarm of angry tells about how rude I am and so forth. Eh, whatever... I didn't blacklist him, but I won't be partying with that fellow anytime soon.<br><br>Maybe he didn't try to MPK me 'cuz he saw me clearing out a few smithy trains with my main earlier that day ^^</p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br />Moridam on Remora<br>Rank 6 Bastok<br><br><a href="http://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?32031" target="akztarg">http://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?32031</a><br><br>As of 5/3: MNK 56/ WAR 29/THF 17/BRD 17/WHM 9 /RNG 5/BST 3<br>AF 1: O 2: O 3: X 4: X 5: X 6: X<br>LB 1: O 2: O 3: X 4: X 5: X</td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8">Posting from Worcester, MA</td></tr></table>

Spending 45 minutes hacking at a Leecher or a Snipper for 0 and 1 point hits doesn't make you &quot;mad EXPz&quot; it makes you a loser who killed 45 minutes+ for no xp because you need to call for help so the PL player could kill the mob with 2 hits.  A PL helps to keep downtime to a minimum, extends chains because of a lack of downtime and at best, is there for situations of totally accidental link/aggro issues (like a gob popping in camp).  You learn nothing about your job or how to party effectively and level none of your important skills if you just let the mob whack away at the PL and let the PLer do all the healing/buffing (no heal/guard/parry/shield/evasion/enhancing skill ups = gimpy character, irregardless of what level they may actually be).  It's junk food xp - all bang, no substance.<br><br>- Ma'at</p></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8">Posting from Soviet Canuckistan</td></tr></table>

Maybe you will agree with me maybe not that's up to you but here is my story.<br><br>I was doing a tele service and a friend of mine needed a tele, so she invited me for the tele. She needed to go pick up another friend at Mea which is no problem. So we are at Mea right now there are 4 of us in our pt. We notice that the Archeiologist is really close to popping so we wait til the last memeber gets there to trade, and we need one more to pop it. So my friends go to their linkshell and one of their mates is coming to help us pop the NM. He gets a tele to meet us, and the WHM that gave him the tele named ZED runs over to us and pops the NM before their ls mate can get there to pop it. I was shocked. As a WHM I would never even think of doing something like that. I still am upset about this and it happened about 2 weeks ago. So I am not saying to blist ZED but watch out for him because he doesn't care about other people at all.</p></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8"></td></tr></table>
