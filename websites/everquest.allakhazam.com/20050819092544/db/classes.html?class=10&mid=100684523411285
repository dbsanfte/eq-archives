<p>Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;This post is a bit long.  When there's something to be said about a class the only thing to do is to say everything about a class.  I hope other rangers will read this and take heart that they're better than other classes think, and that other classes will take note and realize that we're not liabilities.   <br /> <br /> <br />I'm sure what I'm about to say has been said here before, but since I just got here I'll put down all I've learned about being a ranger since I started my first character on EQ. <br /> <br />I picked a ranger because it seemed like a good class.  It could cast some defensive spells and a few offencive spells.  It could wear armor and use a sword and shield, and later it could weild two weapons.  I started with a half-elf ranger because the stats seemed right for the character. <br /> <br />Surefall Glade was a good starting point.  There's a major town nearby with many quests for a young character and the Qeynos Hills area is a nice newbie area without too many people in it.   <br /> <br />Nearby Blackburrow was a great place to find people to group with and a wonderful place to learn how to avoid trains.  It was also an outside area so all of a young rangers spells would be available, even in the deepest portions of the gnoll homeland.   <br /> <br />Everfrost was full of creatures to fight also, and the not so friendly barbarians would still welcome someone who had killed one of their dogs in West Karana a few times.  There were plenty of animals to practice fear kiting on and lots of good targets for archery that didn't move too fast even without snare. <br /> <br />West Karana is the most dangerous zone for a young ranger.  There are many camps of bandits with sashes to turn in for experience and some coins and items (to sell for more coins).  Unfortunitly there are many threats that a young ranger can't avoid or run away from easily.  The twin cyclopses, Froon and Choon, are one of them; and will often be seen chasing some poor unfortunate soul along the road to one of the zones.  There is an occasional giant wandering the area also.  He finds most of the people fighting the bandits to be easy targets.  A Werewolf often shows up at night also.  He runs very fast and hits fairly hard.  There is also the Ghoul Messenger to watch out for, at least until you're able to beat him (arround 30th) and turn in his map for your Short Sword of Morin.   <br /> <br />So much for the basic area knowledge, it's nothing you can't find on any website dedicated to EQ anywhere.  Just thought it'd be some useful knowledge for people starting in the area.   <br /> <br />Now on to the important stuff, the skills of a ranger. <br /> <br />First and foremost is Tracking.  Tracking is one of the most useful skills a ranger has.  Two other classes get tracking, the druid and the bard.  The bard and druid can't, however, alter the tracking list.  A ranger has several different /tracksorts to use.  The most useful is &lt;closest&gt;.  This one tells you what the nearest mobs are, and what direction.  If you put me in any zone I've spent a decent ammount of time in I can tell you what zone, where in the zone I am, and about how far away any given mob is just from the track list.  Closest is the best for avoiding powerful enemies, or for finding easy kills without having to run too far.  Another good one is &lt;consider&gt;, this one groups enemies in order from blue, even, yellow, green, red.  (I think that's the right order, been a while since I've used it.)  This one is good for finding mobs that are killable with ease.  It dosn't give a hint as to how far away things are however.  The /tracksort &lt;normal&gt; lists things in the order that they spawned.  This is useful for looking for new mobs and named mobs, but that's about all.  Usually the red mobs will be the lowest on the list, while easily killed green ones are near the top.  Unfortunitly the newest mob could be one at the far range of tracking leaving you to follow the trail for a long while before finding the creature.  Tracking is still useful in dungons, if a ranger knows a dungon fairly well, or has a good map of the area, he can find a mob without much trouble with tracking.  The skill of the person behind the 'toon comes into play when tracking is needed in a dungon.   <br /> <br />Archery is the second great ranger skill.  I'm currently 42nd level with a maxed skill of 200 using ceramic silver tipped parabolic arrows (damage 5, range 150) and a non-magical Trueshot bow.  I can do an average of 40 damage with each arrow, and I've gotten crits up to 79 points.  (I recently leveled to 42, so the max has probably gone up a bit again.)  Warriors can do greater crits using 2HS weapons, but a ranger can do that ammount of dammage while keeping away from the mob.  A bow with a decent range can also keep a ranger safe from a caster or bard.  Bow damage can also be dished out while moving, giving a ranger an advantage over casters.  If the range of the bow is beyond the range of the spells a caster tries to use then a ranger dosn't have to worry about getting nuked while dishing out damage to an offending caster.  (It's a risky business saying just inside bow range but out of spell range.  More than once I've been on the reciving end of a high damage nuke when I strayed too close to my rooted/snared caster)  Once a ranger gets the Trueshot Dicipline (at 55th level I belive) he can do amazing damage with his bow.  I've seen screen shots of 400+ damage from one arrow. <br /> <br />Another great skill that rangers get are their spells.  Rangers get spells from many of the other caster types in the game.  Even with the first set of spells it enhances the damage output of a ranger, and his value to the group with healing and buffs spells.  His spells aren't as powerful as other casters, but what caster could sit in the middle of a fight and cast while being beaten on by a mob for an extended period of time.  Rangers can also alternate between casting and using the bow to get some very nice damage on mobs from range.  If you shoot a mob for 20 damage and cast Ignite for 35 more it averages out to about twenty five damage a second from range.  It depends of course on your mana supply and how fast you can fire your bow.  Rangers also get a few ranger only spells.  My favorite is Call of the Sky.  This spells imbues a rangers weapons with the ability to activate a 35 damage proc.  With two quick weapons swinging and Call of the Sky activated a ranger can go a long way to preventing a caster mob from getting spells off.  Each time the weapon procs it has a 1 foot knock back and an interrupt.  This keeps the group safe from casting mobs.  (I'm currently enjoying interrupting the spells of Drachnids)  Another good spell is SoW at 30th level.  A long time to wait, but well worth it.  The various Dots, DD spells, roots and snares help a ranger to solo creatures where another melee class would have trouble in a stand up fight with a creature of the same level.  I managed to solo my first to Hill Gians in Rathe Mountians when I was 38th level.  By using my bow and Ignite in conjunction with snare and alot of backing off I was able to drop two giants in about 20 minutes.  Not nearly as impressive as a pure caster, but amazing for a melee/hybrid class.   <br /> <br />Now that I've covered the major advantages of being a ranger, it's time for the downside of being a woodsy type.   <br /> <br />If you're playing a ranger it can be hard to get groups between 20th and 30th levels.  That's okay tho.  There are plenty of animals to fear kite to get you through these levels.  A ranger shouldn't have to go underground into a dungon until he's far beyond 30th level.  Everything a ranger needs is above ground with fur and fangs.  There are amazing ammounts of money to be made from silk swatches (use sewing skill), HQ bear and wolf skins (Just cause you worship Tunare dosn't mean you can't help keep the population down), and even the occasional word and rune.  Just pick a zone with alot of foot traffic and auction every now and then that you have a bunch for sale and watch the offers come in.  Once you hit 30th and get sow you'll have plenty of "slowbies" who are willing to put up with you for your SoW spell.   <br /> <br />If you're playing a ranger in the upper level games be prepared to die.  As a ranger it's your JOB to pull any agro'd mobs off of chanters/casters/clerics.  Just make sure you announce that you're doing it.  When you pull off of someone the first thing to do is throw whatever healing spell you have on them and then attack the creature with whatever you've got.  Snare, root, DoT, DD, bow, melee, taunt, disarm, kick.  With everything going at once it shouldn't be too long before whatever was beating on the poor caster is now beating on you.  This is the point where you die.  The main reason for this is that most healers (not all, there are some good ones out there, I know who you are and appreciate it) will begin to heal the now safe caster back to full.  This leaves you to take the brunt of the mobs fury for quite a while until either other tanks come in or it gets nuked to oblivion.  Unfortunitly a ranger dosn't often last that long.  There is no class that can take damage from an upper level mob for very long, some can just take it longer than others.  The greatest dissapointment of dying is how everyone blames the ranger for dying.  Even if you've pulled the mob of the cleric who rezes everyone you may still be berated for dying.  Don't worry about it, it's part of being a ranger.  If the group you're raiding with gets too petulent about your often demise just (and you didn't hear this from me) stop saving the casters for a bit.  When everything has to stop because the cleric has to do a corpse run two or three times everyone will want you to die for the cause again.  Complaints will stop, for a little while.  Just don't do it too often, or you might not be invited to the next raid. <br /> <br />The third disadvante for a ranger is how much a ranger costs.  The good equipment for a ranger is price between cleric and pure caster costs.  And the best bow you'll get until you hit 50 or so is the Trueshot yout make with your own two hands.  You'll need to buy some of the few items that have AC and WIS, and since they can be worn by pretty much every other WIS caster out there they are rare and expensive.  Don't worry too much about raising your WIS tho.  My mana goes from empty to full in about four minutes right now, and I only run out if I'm doing a solo kite that breaks snare and root alot.  Probably the most expensive thing a ranger would want to own is Tolan's Darkwood Bracer.  This bad boy is only AC 14, but it has an unlimited charge of Summon Arrows.  That means unlimited ammunition for all your shooting needs, and the arrows are magic also.  The bracer usually costs about 5-6K on most of the servers, due to it's rarity and difficulty of the mob.  The arrow effect also can't be used until you're 45+.  But it's well worth the price.   <br /> <br />If things go bad you'll find yourself Kiting many mobs arround whatever clear area of zone you can find while everyone else head back to their corpses.  A ranger either dies first, or he dies last.  As a ranger I've never been in the middle of the list of deaths.  If you're the last to fall, there's no reason for you to die also.  Just start running, if you have SoW keep it up.  If they're a slow mob, run backwards and shoot at them.  Who knows, you may get a kill or two while the rest are out of zone and get all the exp for yourself.  (Hey, someone's got to get it, and the mobs are already half dead, it'd be a shame for all the damage to regen)  If you get good at kiting you can keep it up for as long as needed.   <br /> <br />A quick story for you.  I was with guildies in Timorous Deep at the Spiroc house.  I was 36th at the time, far too low to fight the colorful inhabitants of that aviary.  I was there to get some experience from my higher-level bretheren and hopefully some plat to help my meager bank account.  During a bad pull five spirocs were pulled back to our camp.  After several attempts to root and snare our main puller went down hard.  The spirocs then turned their attention on our druid, the druid managed to kite for a bit before they got her trapped aginst another sudden pop.  Down went the druid.  Because of spells and arrows coming from me the spirocs came after me next.  During the ensuing melee our cleric cast celestial healing agroing two of the parrot people onto her.  Unfortunitly I was unable to agro both off of her so she fell in the heat of battle.  At that point I decided it was time to run my lowbie ranger tail out of there.  I headed up the beach in the hopes of a raft and a quick zone out.  I soon outpace the parots, who are unable to fly, and hardly able to run.  I turned and began to fire my bow while letting them follow me.  I'd like to say that I managed to kill one, but I didn't.  The most I managed to do was keep running for a half hour keeping them away from me and re-SoWing myself as necessary.  I also pulled an ogre or two into the mix, so I had quite the menagarie following me by the time our cleric got back.  (Cleric players take note of this point in the story)  After looting all but one item from her corpse our cleric did a VERY foolish thing.  She Celestial Healed me because I was under two bubles of health.  Due to the range between me and the kited birds, and the fact that I hadn't been doing much lately to create agro, they all mobed our cleric killing her quite quickly and efficently.  They then began following me again.  After about another 15 minutes everyone got thier corpses back and thier equipment on.  I ran past with my train of nasties and let them pull one at a time off the end.  I made sure that I swung back in time to get the exp for each kill, and so they could just keep pulling them off.  After about twenty minutes all the mobs were dead, and I was a good deal closer to the next level.  I hope my fellow rangers never find themselves in this sort of situation; it's stressful, taxing, and exhillerating; but if you do, rest assured that you'll be well equiped to handle the massive number of angry creatures that want to make you into the most popular type of ranger, a dead ranger. <br /> <br />There you have it.  The good and the bad of it.  What to look forward to, and what to dread.  Straight from the rangers mouth.   <br /> <br />As far as PVP goes, a ranger can beat any other class with a bit of skill, trickery and luck.  Here's a few pointers for each class. <br /> <br />Warriors:  Just snare/root these bishes and then shoot/dot away.  They'll fall fast before a barrage of fire, lightning and arrows.  Just make sure you keep them rooted and all they can do is TRY to respond with their arrows. <br /> <br />Rogues:  Same as warriors above, plus don't turn your back.  A rogue of the same level can drop your HP faster than anything short of a dragon or deity. <br /> <br />Paladins:  Pretty much the same as warriors, just keep out of casting range and have alot of arrows ready.  Be prepared to kill a Pally twice, that Lay on Hands means you need to dish out twice as much damage.  They can also heal themselves so make sure you have ALOT of arrows to finish this steel clad healing machine off. <br /> <br />Shadowknights:  These guys are tough, they have pets, they have a snare spell that will overwrite your SoW, they have a Harm Touch that will knock a bunch off of your life, they have as much magical firepower as you do and all of it is offensive based.  Just jump in and start swinging, nuking, doting, and hope he runs out of HP and mana before you do.  Your main advantage is that he only uses one weapon, you have two.  That means you get to interrupt his spells more often than he gets to interrupt yours.  Good luck and Tunare go with you.   <br /> <br />Bards:  These are the ugly, bastard step-child of all the classes.  If you can do it, they can do it, at twice the speed and without the mana cost.  Treat these guys as pallys.  Just root and shoot from out of their song range until they die.  Just remember that they're as fast as you are, and can swing just as often.  If they're a good twiner they may just beat you, if they're not the bish is yours to mount over your mantle.  If a bard is smart enough to start your dual with an instrument instead of weapons, you're facing a master and probably already lost unless you can keep him FAR away.   <br /> <br />Monks:  These guys hit hard and fast, but have less HP than even you do.  If you really want to mess them over follow the instructions for the warrior, and if they Feign Death just get close and AOE the both of you.  FD dosn't do anything in duals, but it's fun to watch him pop back up before he wants to.  Just be aware that they can bind self, that means they can heal anywhere from 1/3 to 1/2 of their HP just by pressing a button.  Don't close in for the kill until you know for SURE that they've used it recently.   <br /> <br />Chanters:  These guys are easy.  The only thing they have going for them is mez, and that's easily countered.  Just DoT yourself and keep the DoT and and mez will break as soon as it hits.  Chase the clarity casting bastard down and show him that rangers don't appreciate the sparkles before their eyes.  We prefer the stars overhead.  If a chanter does happen to nuke you just keep going.  They can't do it much and by the time he gets the second one loaded you should be on top of him swinging away and interrupting his spells.  Just don't let the DoT drop.  If you do and get Mezed, well, you'll probably be standing still for a long time while he gets mana and life back.   <br /> <br />Shaman:  These guys are HARD.  If you can get him rooted and snared and keep WAY out of spell range and shoot with the bow then you just may beat him.  Keep buffs low and cancel magic up.  If he DoTs you just alternate between shooting and casting cancel magic on yourself until the DoT is gone.  If he's got a pet keep one of your Anti-Summoned spells up.  They work wonders on pets of all sorts.  If you're going after a shammy, good luck.  The barbarian ones make excellent winter rugs too. <br /> <br />Druids:  This guy is your best friend, except for in a dual.  If you dual with a druid you'll spend alot of time sitting still sucking up AoE attacks and watching your life go down.  If you can get the first root off keep them away like every other caster and shoot away.  If you're lucky root will break while he's healing himself and you'll get another on before he moves.  These guys run as fast as you do, and can root/snare/dot/nuke/AOE alot better than you can.  If they get close press the attack and hope for interrupts, alot of interrupts.  If you happen to beat one carve Tunare's name in their back, just to remind them that they're not the ultimate servant of Nature.   <br /> <br />Mages:  Mages have massive spell power, lousy hit points.  If you're starting close keep close and keep swinging.  Watch for their pets too.  If you can hit hard and fast enough a mage will fall before getting two or three spells off.  If you're lucky he'll get none off.  If you're starting from range just root and shoot like with the other caster types.  If his pet comes at you just root the pet and use your Anti-summoned spells on it.  It'll go down quick.  Don't melee fire pets(they have a Damage Shield), and don't get close to earth pets (They use root as a standard form of attack).  If you have high resists you can try and close when he's weak to knock him out and save some arrows; but you don't have resists that high until his spells hit hard enough to drop you like a gnoll pup. <br /> <br />Wizards.  These guys are pure nukage.  They can dish out more HP than you've got.  If you've got high resists just close and beat on them till they're dead.  If you have anything less than 100+ resists just root and move far enough away to shoot until they're dead.  If you see him sit to med and change spells run in QUICK and start swinging.  Wizzies have spells that outrange your bow, unless you've got 175-200 range on it.  Even then they can hit you with some of their spells that are fire and forget.  They keep moving until they hit the zone edge, or you.  (You CAN use this to your advantage tho, if there's a mob behind you that gets hit it will agro on the mage.  Not quite a fair one-on-one dual, but it's a risk he's taking.) <br /> <br />Necromancers:  Um, you're dead.  Unless you can suck up three types of dots while taking a beating from a nasty pet and do this all while under a snare type effect don't take this guy on.  If you have to fight one tho, just get close and beat away.  Ignore the pet, or root it at some convienent far off spot.  Keep beating on the necro while he Life Taps you and hope that you do more damage than he steals.  If you can root him and his pet at range just keep shooting away like with any other caster.  Necro's have long range spells too, so you'll probably get hit anyway.  As with Wizzies, if he sits to change spells in his book run in swinging.   <br /> <br />Clerics:  Don't dual clerics.  The cleric you defeat and gloat over today, may be the CLERIC you have to beg a rez from tomorow.  If you have to dual a cleric just move in and keep swinging.  Throw a few cancel magics on him to take off some AC and HP.  Watch for the stun spells, and any of the healing spells.  Pretty much if you can keep swinging at a cleric he'll fall fairly quickly.  They have some good smite spells tho, so watch out for those.  You can root and shoot clerics also, but you'll be in for a LONG time shooting.  So be nice to your cleric, they're not worht killing, and you'll need him to rez you later on. <br /> <br />As with any dual the skill and equipment of the characters impacts greatly on the outcome.  All of the scenarios are based on players of equal skill and equivilent equipment going at it.  The ranger also has one final advantage in duals.  Every other class will underestamate you, saying to themselves, 'It's just a ranger, I can take him'.  Be prepared for their outraged cries of, "No fair rooting me!  I'm a warrior and can't reach you from here," or, "Hey, I would have beaten you if you hadn't been out of my casting range,"  or even, "If I hadn't been interrupted so much I would have won," and especially, "No fair DoTing so my mez woln't stick!"  Sure, people can complain, but you don't tell them they can't use their crits, or harm touch, or pets do you?  Or course not, because you're a ranger.  If you win it's a victory for rangers every where; and if you die, well, you're a ranger.  That's what rangers do for a living.</p>
