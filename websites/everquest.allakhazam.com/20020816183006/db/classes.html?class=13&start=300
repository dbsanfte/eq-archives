	   <tr><td colspan=2>Giant Snake Fang (5/27). Very good non-magic piercing weapon, and relatively easy to obtain. The odd thing is that considering that the mobs and the item are fairly common, why you hardly see these either being sold or given to newbies? I shall be farming these to give away, as I would have greatly appreicated one as a young Enchanter.<br><br>Drops:<br><br>East Commons:<br>Asp<br>Darkweed Snake<br><br>Eruds Crossing:<br>Kerra Snake<br><br>Note: Dearie me. Never tussled with an Asp, as the horror stories regarding it's incredibly strong and potent poison terrified me. Also, Darkweed Snakes are mean, mean and thrice mean! At the level when they conned 'risky' (blue), these snakes hit hard for their level, and their poison is particularly vile. Ick all round. <br><br>By contrast, Kerra snakes are far easier than Darkweed. Perhaps because I was 12th level when fighting these [Kerra]. However, I did notice that the poison on Kerra Snakes is fairly weak when compared to a Darkweed &lt;shudders&gt;.<br><br>re: Weapons. 16pp? I was fortunate to obtain a Dracnid Leg tip for 10pp in Kelethin (6/27 magic).<br>I was extremely fortunate that another player had no real use for it and was in the Kelethin area. The only other piercing weapon is the Dragoon Dirk. Out of your price range :(<br><br>To be honest, I would try to find a Giant Snake Fang. If not, maybe a cracked staff? With 16pp at my disposal, a weapon should be near the bottom of your list of priority. Maybe, some +stat jewelry? +2 cha necklace and a pair of +2 int rings will set you back around 12pp. With the remaining 4pp save for raw silk armour.<br><br>riotgirl<br>(13 seasons fledgling Enchanter)<br>Ayonae Ro server<br><br>P.s. I will attempt to farm some Giant Snake Fangs -- the only problem is that the Fangs weigh 5.0 each. Can you say 'encumbered'? :P<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hi everyone it's me again. Last time I forgot to log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;anyways hers some more tips. <br><br>10-12  Now you have enough mana that you can try rooting and nuking solo. I personally would get someone to take you up to HHK (HIghhold Keep) and buy a couple of your pet seplls so you don't have to make frequent trips.  If you want to solo you probably should do this,(just don't go through Kicthor Forest at night like I did!!!!)  I was soloing yellow scarbs in the Desert of Ro but you can hunt in NRO, BB/Chessboard, Blackburrow, PLains of Karana/West, Crshbone(DON'T bad faction with dark elves and even if your a lightie I would'nt sugguest it), and Steamfont are all good places that aren't far from most enchanter cities.  <br><br>Fighting Blues- These just get hit your mob once and have pet jump on him and you can nuke it about twice. If your pet is about to die cast fear on the target nuke it then sit down and med. If more then one joins you have 2 choices. If its blue try mezzing and if it fails maybe you should run, if it's even or above I would flee but if you think your ready try it.<br><br>Fighting Evens and Yellows- Buff you and your pet with everything, (even see invisible if your on a PvP server, people sometimes will attack you during while your fighting especially backstabbing rogues) then start out with Root and nuke and nuke and nuke when root wears off you can let him attack you to get pet on him or recast root or mez.  Either way your probably low on mana so you may want to med.  Be careful about your pet cause it may die and I have had many expierances getting critical hits from monsters attacking me while i med.  Just the stradegy here is root nuke debuff if you want and repeat.  It's not as hard as it looks just don't try it on things that use to be red on your last level.  <br><br>Equip- My enchanter is twinked so this is easier for me than yo0. Save up for gossimar if you can or damask.  If your really rich buy a Flowing black robe.  I have a green silken drape which is pretty nice for 200-250 plat.  At this point you may want to get some starting ingredients for our special enchanter only quest. Stein of Moggok.  read more about it on the site and don't try to turn stuff in unless your a dark elf.  Anyways let me get my enchanter to level 12 and i'll give you some more tips!<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Terinan Iceforest</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>IF this is your first charcter or even your first caster you might want to try a couple of group type casters (clerics, druids, shamans, before playing an Enchanter. This class is the most difficult and rewarding in the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;Im going to give you tips on soloing up til level 10 when you are considered a newbie. (Note this is not a complete guide and is better suited to the newer player.  I apologize for the short level range but I will update)<br><br>LV 1-3 During these Levels just kill everything white and blue.   Kill loot sell kill Loot sell kill.  If your having trouble you might want to buy the Weaken Spell and lower it's strength.  Although many people saay our pets aren't at all useful use it at lv 1 if you have it.  Even at 2 and 3 it can be used to take the blows you would be taking making this level bracket go along quicker.<br><br>LV 4-7 These Levels you want to go out and explore the world.  You now have acess to Gate which alows you to teleport to your bind spot.  Suffocating Sphere is a nice upgrade to Shallow breath. Haze grants more AC.  Also Enfeeblement lowers strength and I believe their AC too.  Now you also have the spell the makes enchanters enchanters, Mesmerize. Use it. Use it often.  This spell enables you to take on 2 white mobs(wih your new lv 4-5 pet of course) as long as you have enough mana.  As soon as you damage a mob it will wake up though but you can debuff using Enfeeblement and Tashan.  <br><br>lV 8-10  You now have a dd spell called Chaotic Feedback which averages about 43 points of damage.  You have 4 racial illusions total now and a new pet spell which from now on wll be in Highhold keep.  Even though you can now cripple your targets using Root, Mezmerize, Tashan and Enfeebelment it's not dead yet.  Dont get cocky like I did and lose your level.  Remember you dont get your rise of power til 30 +.  At these levels use the same tactics you did and dont solo unless you are sure of yourself and full health and mana.  Use Mesmerize then root the mob along with tashan enfeeblement and then nuke them to death, but save some mana in case you have to make an emergency gate.  I have to end now so I can go aback and learn more about this wonderful class, but I will update ASAP.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Dear all, <br><br>This post was cut and pasted from the Wizard's class discussion forum. EVERY caster ought to read this post, nod furiously, and then see "LOADING. PLEASE WAIT." flash on their monitors because they were in fits of laughter.<br><br>Actually Wizards get several types of pets. This informative spoiler written by Kusinata of the Nameless is a spoiler about these pets. <br><br>***SPOILER FOLLOWS*** <br><br>PART 1 -- How to Summon Your Pet <br>There is no need to obtain or scribe a spell scroll for this. All wizards are able to cast the summoning as an intrinsic class ability. To do this, first enter the zone in which you intend to hunt, then enter the following command: <br><br>/shout Group seeks lvl [your level] tank <br><br>Expect many fizzles. In fact, this spell fizzles so often that the fizzle message has been disabled to spare you the spam, so on failure you just get stony silence. On the bright side, it costs you niether mana nor items to cast (...initially, that is. You'll pay through the nose in terms of mana and items as your pet goes into action.) Don't be discouraged. Keep casting and soon your tank will appear. <br><br>PART 2 -- What is a "Tank?" <br>Just as enchanters get animations and magicians get elementals, wizards get "tanks." While I would have thought, before reading all this "Give us pets!" nonsense, that the sight of a wizard plunging nose-first into peril with his faithful tank in tow was one of the more common sights in Norrath, it is, I suppose, understandable that one could overlook them. Let us take stock of the tank, then, and compare it to the other caster pets. <br><br>Tanks are most like mage pets in both apperance and behavior, though they are substantially inferior in combat power. They can be easily distinguished from each other in that tanks have heads, although this is purely there for decoration. Like mage pets, tanks may be given weapons to use, but should not be given anything that you expect to get back. Fortunately, unlike mage pets, tanks generally come equipped with weapons on summoning, hence the prudent wizard doesn't give them Jack Diddly. Finally, just like mage pets, most tanks have some kind of minor magical attack, along with an unrestrainable tendancy to use it exactly when you don't want them to. <br><br>PART 3 -- Getting a Good Tank <br>In contrast to the common practice of other pet-wielding classes, the high failure rate of the summoning means that wizards cannot expect to summon and destroy thier tanks until they get an "even pet." The "/tank get lost" command is bugged anyway, leading to unpredictable results. If you simply must destroy your tank, it is far more efficient to send it out on a pull, invis everyone in the party while it is gone, then hit the "disband" key as soon as it makes contact. It should return to a point near the camp and, if invis holds, it will mill around a little until it finally succumbs to the pulled MOB's. At this point you may attempt to cast a summoning for another tank. (N.B. It is widely rumored among higher level wizards that repeated use of this method results in a higher fizzle rate for the summoning.) <br><br>PART 4 -- Fighting with a Tank in the Party <br>Tanks, like enchanter pets, are largely automated, with one important difference: Tanks are highly active and aggro on almost everything. This has its good and bad aspects. On the one hand, tanks can be set to auto-pull MOB's and dice them up at camp, netting you exp while you med, eat, watch TV, fondle the girlfriend, etc.; on the other hand, they have a variety of obnoxious personal habits, such as binge drinking, sexually harassing the party's druid, and pulling trios of fire giants while you're at 10% mana. You have to take the good with the bad -- just remember to always have gate memmed. <br><br>The typical "tank pull" goes something like this: <br>1) The tank is buffed and told to pull. <br>2) The tank signals readiness to pull by chugging ale until he weaves and commenting on the druid's breasts. <br>3) The tank departs and the druid bitterly starts listening to Ani DiFranco tunes while she meds. <br>4) The tank returns suddenly with about four dangerous and upset MOB's on his tail. <br>5) The tank says "Incoming!" <br>6) With the exception of the druid, who is still jamming with Ani, the group leaps into coordinated action, focusing their attacks on the group's bard. <br>7) The bard's instrument is vigorously lodged in his rectum so that the party can target the enemy. <br>8) Acquiring your target by assisting the puller, you light off your most potent nuke. <br>9) Your target rushes you, and you summon the tank to your aid saying "ON ME!" <br>10) The cleric pulls the remaining 3 MOB's off the tank by healing him. <br>11) The enchanter highlights the MOB attacking you by casting mesmerize on it. <br>12) The tank, guided by the blue flash, rushes to attack the mezzed MOB. <br>13) With mez broken, the MOB continues to pound you while the tank attempts to taunt it off you. <br>14) Taunt succeeds a few seconds after you die. <br>15) The cleric, forgotten in all the excitement, is killed by the other 3 MOB's. <br>16) With the cleric dead, the tank panics and trains his MOB to zone; meanwhile, the 3 other MOB's pounce on the medding/grooving druid. <br>17) The druid prepares to evac while the enchanter prepares to mesmerize the MOBs off her. <br>18) The bard extracts his instrument from his nethers and strikes up a tune, taunting all the MOBs off the druid. <br>19) The enchanter mesmerizes the bard. <br>20) The bard dies and the druid evacs to safety with the enchanter. <br><br>Of course, it doesn't always go this well, but this is the general idea. <br><br>(*grins*) <br><br>Sallies <br>Apprentice Wizard <br>Vallon Zek <br><br>Thanks to Kushinata for a good laugh, I hope he/she doesn't mind me sharing this around a bit.

	   <tr><td colspan=2><br>First things first, have you gotten all of your spells? some not well known research spells are great to have.&nbsp;&nbsp;Check your spells against casters realm list<br><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spells.asp?Class=Enchanter" target=_new>http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spells.asp?Class=Enchanter</a><br><br>If you haven't and are having bad luck with not succeeding in creating your spells, buy a concordance of research and up your research that way (warning: money sapper from components if you want to raise it a lot)<br><br>Before battle you must make sure you have the right buffs on and keep them on throughout your fight and group members who need them.  breeze, sympathetic aura(yourself only to aid in mezzing), cloud, shielding for yourself, and endure magic(protection from mezzing yourself on aoe mezzes) are the basic spells you should try to always have on.  <br><br>The first battle should tell you if your group knows how to play with an enchanter or not.  If your tanks are not assisting the puller or if a number of other things happen you have to give them "the talk" in which probably the 2 most important points include you say to them:<br>"-always assist the puller<br>-if i try to mez one and it resists and comes after me, don't charge at it unless i ask for help, because most probably you'll break my mez<br>when i succeed in mezzing it a second later."<br><br>To help others, make sure you have a hotkey button that goes something like this (with enthrall being on oh say, the 5th slot)<br><br>/cast 5<br>/gsay "Attempting to MEZ %T do not attack it"<br><br>And make sure if you die or something happens where you change around your spells, to make sure that the /cast # command and the slot you have your enthrall spell in match up.  You don't want to accidentally gate yourself or something ;P<br><br>A hotkey like that is essential for enthrall (probably use the word mez instead of enthrall because most non enchanters don't know the names of the single target mezzes)  You don't necessarily need a hotkey button for the rest, maybe root... Some like to, others say that to many txt buttons linked with spells gives too much spam, but its a matter of what you like, really.<br><br>Some of what you cast will depend on what other classes you are grouped with.  For example later on you can ds, invigor, and high lvl runes, etc to try to lessen the impact of not having a druid/cleric.   <br><br>it sounds like you are doing great so far with tashing everything and quicknessing the tanks and knowing when and when not to use aoe mez.  The Tash line costs little, casts quick, and works well, and tanks love their crack just as much as we casters love ours(make sure you are using tashani and not tashan though)  Also debuffs are fine, the best one being tashani and then languid pace IMHO, but any more than that you should only do if you have extra mana and time on your hands, (unless you are camping one large spawn) because it is more efficient to buff your tanks, and usually your time is spent elsewhere.  Once a pull is inc, a good proccess would be this<br><br>if there is one mob pulled..<br>let the tank get in a taunt and a little damage so the mob won't aggro on you when you cast on it.  Tashani the mob then quickness tank and   languid pace the mob.  Nuke(sanity warp)/dot(choke) it if you have mana to burn.<br><br>if more than one comes...<br>immediately single enthrall the spares.  make sure everyone is assisting off of the tank or this will do nothing.  If one resists, tashani and enthrall again.  (or first tashani then enthrall... but you don't always have time for this method and it may aggro on you)If the mob hits you quickly and interrupts you a lot, color shift to stun him (casts fast) then enthrall him and the rest.  After the enthralling is done, tash the ones you haven't for future enthralls, or other spells against it.  Remember when something is enthralled you can debuff it all you want without breaking enthrall.  Now quickness the tank if he needs it and languid pace the one he's on and the rest.  Med and watch your text screen to see if an enthrall wears off or is broken and re-enthrall.  monitor everyone's health as well, which will give an indication if there has been an add.  When the tank gets down to the last or second to last one, feel free to nuke/dot if mana permits and everyone's buffs are good.<br><br><br>if there are quite a lot....<br>aoe mez first if you know you aren't attacking high magic resists mobs.  if one resists and gets on you, tashani it and enthrall.  If more than one get on you, colorshift/aoe mez--keep trying until you get it off. Run a bit away when you can(so you won't mez self with next aoe mez if you haven't mezzed yourself along with this first one), and tash them all, quickness the tank if mana permits, re aoe mez (mezmerization) and med.  This should have taken up a lot of your mana, and your number one priority is crowd control, so don't worry about debuffing(besides tash).  Root if you want and have mana a few out of the way ones so that when aoe mez wears off you can have extra time and maybe even enthrall it.  Med for future mezmerization/enthralls.  because this pull should have, brought you down significantly in mana (or will when its over) and you don't want the one your tank is on to possibly aggro on you especially if several enthralls/mezmerizations wear off... Don't forget too, single target mezzes(i.e. enthrall) doesn't stack with mezmerization.  <br><br>If ever there are problems, such as the tank can't taunt one off the cleric, and you don't have memory blur memorized, enthrall that one, and when the tank breaks mez, the mob will usually go on him instead of the cleric.  <br><br>if you are low on mana...<br>if a lot come, try to stand back enough to aoe mez to give your group a chance to live when they run or aoe mez then tash them all and med, redoing the aoe mez about every 20 seconds or so (lasts 24 seconds according to casters realm)<br><br>Although your mana will probably be nice now that you have breeze, try to make sure it is at least 2 bubbles at all times in case of an unexpected large pull or train. Quickness to tanks is a nice way to drain your mana ;) <br><br>If you have mana and time to burn...<br>-cast serpent sight on those who can't see well in the dark, it really does help them out more than you might think.<br>-illusion yourself as a troll to gain back more hit points per tick and save the cleric some mana<br>-benevolence a random npc (non-KOS)and bask in the love. :)<br>-aid the puller by calming a second monster so that you have an easier pull and no need/less need to enthrall<br>-cancel magic to get rid of those annoying ds's on MOB's<br>-root the ones you have mezzed so that if mez/enthrall wears off first you have more time to remez it.  <br>-rebuff yourself and the rest of your group<br>-rune the tank/yourself if the cleric is low on mana and you are in a dangerous spot<br>-if your tank usually pulls one or just if you have an extra slot open, put on your whirl till you hurl spell (nice stun) but be sure to always tashani first<br>-cast true north to get that stubborn divination skill up.<br>-chaotic feedback a group member so they can see the pretty sparkles and you can work on your evocation<br>-get yourself a pet  -nooo not an animation--, a real pet(have animations for soloing...fine, but in groups they just break mez too much).  Charm something (also tashani it) and help out your tank with /pet attack  or /pet guard here etc.<br><br>Here's a good list of spells to have mem'd<br>-gate<br>-quickness/languid pace<br>-root/dd/dot<br>-color flux<br>-mezmerization<br>-enthrall<br>-tashani<br>-changable buff/free spell, such as breeze, or whirl till you hurl if you want to see 'em spin ;)<br><br>i have to say too, that enchanters get a vast array of spells, a great selection to chose from, especially in the higher levels when you'll get more lines of spells, and different types of illusions. <br>People probably say you are brave to start out with an enchanter because it is hard to master the art of crowd control well, especially since it is so important, and can be the difference between life and death for your group in so many instances.  <br><br>Enchanters are one of the most sought after classes in the game.  Have fun with the array of options you have, the options will grow more as you level, although of course there are some spells you will use most, there are usually some helpful bonuses from obscure spells for your group (i.e. serpent sight) Of course what i gave are just some things that have worked for me, and i'm sure i'm missing something, but refine it to fit your own personality :)<br><br>Xaria Soulchanger<br>38 Enchantress of the Druzzil Ro server<br>Paragons of Conquest<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well after dueling a certain cleric today I admit I must have to revise this. More and more people are bringing it upon themselves to have high resists. Especially in the matter of magic resist. So I am thinking now is the perfect time to update on this. <br><br>Dueling Casters:<br>============<br>With the majority of the Everquest population constantly upgrading on their resist gear new tactics will have to be made. I have thought day in and day out of exactly what I could do and here is some things that I have learned over time.<br><br>When dueling casters the most important thing to have is a nice melee skill and your resists as high as possible depending on the class. <br><br>Here is a list of what resists to keep up based on class. This is only from my understanding of playing certain chars low level so I do not understand the high end of it but here goes.<br>Keep in mind that these spells are going to be more commonly used in no way am I saying that if you have this up that they won't be able to get a cast off on you. I am also not listing hybrid classes here because resist will be same as their parent class.<br><br>Resists to Keep up based on Class:<br>==========================<br>Druids<br>Heat/Cold/Poison/Magic<br><br>Wizard<br>Heat/Cold/Magic<br><br>Mage<br>Heat<br><br>Enchanter<br>Magic<br><br>Cleric<br>Magic<br><br>Necromancer<br>Magic/Poison<br><br>Buffs to Keep up<br>=============<br>Most, if not all casters have some form of Cancel Magic, however none can beat that of the enchanters. Therefore you will need to put up 4 buffs that aren't needed which WILL be dispelled if the person you are dueling is smart. Now after you have done so you will want to put up your good buffs. Put up your buffs in order of least important to most important so if more get's dispelled the last on your list which will be the most important spell will still be there. Also it would be a good idea to put up boon of the garou because you will be meleeing. It will help you regain HP as well as add some attack power to you. Buff with Berserker Spirit/Rune last, regain mana then accept the duel. Every time this fades, try to keep it up again, I reccommend Berserker spirit for casters because most of the time their melee skills suck anyhow so you won't need rune. The casting time on BS is also much lower then rune and less mana costly.<br><br>First line of Spells to Keep up (Enchanter only)<br>===================================<br>Tashania<br>Recant Magic<br>Color Stun (lowest casting time highest level spell which you have)<br>Berserker Spirit<br>Wandering Mind<br>Theft of Thought<br>Boon of the Garou<br>Mez<br><br>First wave of casting<br>================<br>Immediately start with recant magic, recant magic is THE best dispell so far, not sure if there are upgrades yet. Recant magic will dispell almost all spells depending on level of spell. I dueled a cleric today and supposedly all spells except mine were dispelled. Next, land a tash on him/her you will need their MR lowered in order to mez them so you can debuff and get ready for melee. Next keep stunning/mezzing until you get one off hopefully their MR isn't too high where you can't cast any spells at all, if that happens you will lose. Now that you have him/her mezzed land a Theft of Thought and a Wandering mind to help with your mana and to lessen theirs so they don't cast. Also get up Mana sieve and cast it on your opponent at least 5 times, this is the amount I tested on which will run them OOM considering you used ToT and Wandering mind as well. It may be more though but last person I dueled said this. Now you want to land Cripple and Weakness on your opponent to lessen the AC/STR for the up and coming melee battle.<br><br>Second line of spells to Keep up<br>========================<br>Tashania<br>Berserker Spirit<br>Illusion:Werewolf<br>Boon of the Garou<br>Aanyas Quickening<br>Mez<br>Theft of Thought<br>Wandering Mind<br><br>Melee time<br>========<br>Yes Boon of the Garou and Illusion werewolf do stack for those of you who didn't know it. Illusion Werewolf is +20 STR i believe with low % haste. Boon of the Garou adds ATK/100dex/40 hp life tap proc/and small % haste. Now add on your BS again which is a 40 str buff i THINK. Now what you have is an extra 60-70 str an extra 100 dex and a helluva a lot more attack power. Buff yourself with AQ also and you come out one fast mofuka. Now the melee begins. Keep meleeing/recasting buffs as needed especially ToT and Wandering mind every time it pops up and BS every time it wears off. It will be a long battle but if you stick to this you SHOULD do fine. Thank you. Hope this was of some help<br><br><br>(Disclaimer)<br><br>This is in no way meant to be complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very tired now and will update it tomorrow.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Is it worth it? IS IT WORTH IT? Obviously you don't see the benefits of the enchant metal series and the animation series, so I will explain this to you as simply as possible. I myself almost always solo, and even if I'm not soloing, having a fighter around that is the same level as your last spell level is great! There's nothing like the security of having someone watching your back as you meditate or loot corpses either. For that matter, enchanter pets are hands down the coolest in the game... We get a floating shield and weapon! Everyone else's pet has to have a body... And our pet counts as a magic weapon, too, so it can help you hunt willowwisps... Now, as far as the enchant metal series goes... Enchant silver's not that great, but if you are going to work jewelry, wouldn't you much rather make magic artifacts than simple baubles? Besides, some of the later enchant metal spells produce items that are in high demand. That means you can 'make' money by making a whole bunch of the artifacts and then selling them wholesale to other players! Cool!<br>Well, I hope that straitens you out, whippersnapper! Enchanters rule because of those two spell series (and tashani).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; --Emett<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Sorry to have to break it to you but the buff line of spells that you most likely have bought, are either the ones that you will -still- be using, right up to level 12 (the level where you cannot afford to have 'strength' wasting a valuable gem slot), and/or the buffs which you will merely upgrade such as 'minor shielding' to 'lesser shielding' at level 8.<br><br>At level 4, you'll obtain the 'haze' buff which will raise your AC by a whooping 4 points -- however, as numerous posters have pointed out, our class is a subtle one and -small- amounts are the difference between life and death for an Enchanter.<br><br>The spells you obtain at level 4 are the ones which define the class you play, in this case 'Colour Flux' and 'Mesmorisation'. The application of these important line of spells are not immediately obvious at this level, probably because the various distinctions between the classes are not apparent and most players are still relying on melee reliefing their pet, whilst blasting with a DoT.<br><br>Colour Flux is the first in the series of 'stun' spells available to our class which is one of the most versatile spells that you will obtain. The spell stuns a group of mobs around the caster for 4 seconds, which allows the caster and/or his group to get in a few blows and/or cast another spell. Note: in an emergency, those 4 seconds can be -vital- for backtracking towards either the zone exit or guards.<br><br>'Colour Flux' is mana efficient (20 mana) and incredibly fast (1 second casting time) which gives it such versatility. The spell has applications to allow melee classes to add a few extra blows without the mob riposting; allows casters to fire off another spell (mesmorisation is a good one and saves lives. Usually, your own); as well as allowing you -vital- seconds to escape to safety should a situation turn precarious. Also, due to it's fast casting time, you can interrupt other spell casting mobs -- if you fire -immediately- after you see, "A &lt;mob&gt; casts a spell".<br><br>Mesmorisation is the first in the series of 'enrapture' spells which will hold a mob completely passive (provided the mob does not recieve any damage -- either from spells or melee) for up to 24 seconds, dependent on caster level, mob resistance and secondary check on caster's charisma.<br><br>Just like 'Colour Flux', this spell is incredibly mana efficient (20 mana) and is tremendously versatile. In a group situation, the ability to control the flow of mobs by effectively neutralising them, defines our class and what -only- our class and can do safely. In solo situations, those precious 24 seconds can allow a caster to cast a range of other spells on the mesmorised mob (nb: providing that the spells are non-damage otherwise you'll break the mesmorisation) such as 'Tashan' (another 4th level spell) to lower the mobs magical resistance, and then a debuff such as 'Enfeeble' (guess what? Another 4th level spell), followed up by a DoT ('Suffocating Sphere' -- 4th level upgrade of 'Suffocating Breathe').<br><br>These two spells -define- your class -- your strengths and also, your weaknesses -- and have such versatility in their application that they will -always- be memorised. <br><br>One final point: if you do plan to use a pet then please understand that a 4th level pet will get pretty chewed up by most mobs your level, unless you relieve the poor soul (alternatively, read the posts below and/or Eq caster's realm on the use of pets effectively).<br><br>Personally, the -best- use of pets that I have found is for maxing out spell skill levels. <br><br>Spell skill levels: each spell will belong to a particular magical class &lt;skill&gt; i.e. mesmorisation falls under the 'Conjuration' skill. Your skill level in a particular magical class has a -large- bearing on the effectiveness of all spells belonging to that magical class.<br><br>Skill level is determined by the following formula: &lt;level&gt;*5+5. Example: at level 4, you would max out a particular skill level at 25 e.g. 4*5=20, 20+5=25. <br><br>Therefore, upon arriving at a new level, I summon a pet, and cast various spells from different spell classes ('Minor Shielding' to increase Abjuration, and your DoT spells on green/blue mobs to increase Alteration).<br><br>When you obtain both 'Colour Flux' (uses the Diviniation skill) and 'Mesmorisation' (uses the Conjuration skill) at level 4, your skill in both classes should be 0 -- and given the -importance- of both spells, you should max these out at -every- level. What better way to do this than to simply cast them on your placid, docile and long suffering pet.<br><br>Hoped that this information has helped somewhat. My -best- piece of advice is to read ALL of the posts contained in this forum for Enchanters. If you have a question or are unclear on some matter, chances are that it has already been answered.<br><br>riotgirl<br>(11 seasons -- fledgling enchanter)<br>Ayonae Ro server<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hi, this topic has been touched upon here and there, but I'd like to get some straitforward discussion of it going.&nbsp;&nbsp;So you know where I'm coming from, 52 Enchanter, in a good guild (but not like we-all-have-epics-and-ss-armor good), and have pretty much been grouping (as an enchanter, i.e. mez haste slow etc) since my high teens or low 20s.  <br><br>The Question:  I've seen in quite a few places some extreme praise of the AE mez spells, the level 16 Mesmerization and the 52 spell Fascinate.  We all know how these work, and for convenience, I believe they both have a cast time of 3.0, with the stun times being 16 and 32 seconds respectively.  In CC (crowd control) discussions here I've seen many that say that on a pull of 3 or more they throw out an AE, root (or tash and root), and pick them off with single mez as they pop up.  (a few prefer to reapply the AE)  On castersrealm, in a discussion on spell slots, the majority of the posters kept AE in a permanent slot.  In a discussion of the spell fasctinate, one poster called mesmerization the "most powerful spell" pre-kunark, and fascinate the new most powerful spell.  Now the question I raise is: Is AE mez needed to keep control, or is it a sloppy (if not dangerous) way to play?<br><br>My Experience: I used AE mez extensively from level 20 to 30, in the sarnak fort in LoIO and a few times in Cazic-Thule.  I did find it to be a great way to get control.  After this, I didn't find it quite so useful, perhaps because most of my leveling from 30 to 45 was in outdoor areas, where pulls rarely exceeded 3 mobs.  However, in KC, Sebilis, the Hole, and other high level dungeons, I never use the AE mez.<br><br>Why not?  First, there are dangers to useing the AE.  Mezing yourself is not a serious danger, because first, it is rare with high MR, and second, if you don't resist, something else might resist, and will come and wake you up.  The only problem with mezing yourself is that in most groups you'll need to cast other spells during the fight (especially ones with no shaman, since you'll have to slow the mobs).  The second problem with AE, also one relating to the other-spell problem, is that it has a very short duration versus Dazzle (16 or 32 versus 96).  If you belong to the school that likes to reapply the AE, then you will be hard pressed to get off any other spells.  If you are one that roots and remezes, essentially what you're saving with the AE is the hits that the mobs will get off while you target and mez each one.  I usually don't find this to be a problem, since the pulled mobs are usually on the puller for a while, and then run to the cleric after the first heal.  Unless there is a large swarm of mobs (which would probably be a problem if you AE'd them anyway due to resists), the cleric probably has the AC to tank for the 5 seconds it will take to mez the first one, which will probably anger the second one sufficiently to get it away from him.  Of course, use of color stuns can be used effectively to minimize premez damage and to taunt extra mobs into a mezible position.  The third main problem I find with the AE approach is a question of dealing with resistant mobs.  Say 3 are pulled, and they all have high MR.  Say you toss out your AE mez and all 3 resist it.  This will quite likely draw 2 angry, magic resistant mobs on to you, which is always a bad idea.  I'm not saying this will be a problem often, but it is something to consider.  Another problem is that encountered with any AE spells...hitting unwanted targets, especially in a vertical place like kedge or some places in KC.  <br><br>Reasons For AE: 1) Inexperience.  It's easier to use this, especially before you develop the skills of fast targeting and instinctive timing of mezes.  I don't mean this as an insult to anyone who uses AE regularly, although in my experience I found the usefullness of mesmerization waned as I learned more about enchanting.<br>2) The AE group, of course, or quad-kiting with a druid or wiz.<br>3) Raid Situations, where you signifigantly outlevel your opponants (they are low blues and green).  In situations like this, large pulls often happen because of a desire to get to the camp or whatever.  This is really off the point though, i only mentioned it so its clear that this discussion is on use of AE in a somewhat hazerdous situation.<br>4) ???  I don't know of a good reason to use AE mez other than those mentioned.  I'd love to hear what people think abou this though.<br><br>Tarnin Austa, 52 Illusionist &lt;Dragon Society&gt;<br>7th Hammer<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I'll just use dazzle for the single target mez and mez for aoe mez for less confusion<br><br>AE mez isn't that great, but it is useful.&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually I won't use aoe mez unless there are problems-- i.e. an unexpected pull of 6 or so, or if 3 are on the cleric that needs to be free for heals immediately, (especially if the tank isn't a taunt class--hey we all have had those kind of groups where sometimes tanks&#8217; damage alone does not taunt well enough).   Or if there are problems targeting (which usually isn't that bad).  Usually in situation where there is a really bad pull or many mobs are hitting the wrong people, I will aoe mez, tash and dazzle any that resist (thank the gods for channeling and the quick cast time of tash! :)), then tash the remainder, to get them ready for future dazzling and aoe mezzing, If i have time and mana and is feasible(especially if i am worried about my health), i might even root one or two (so that when they break mez i have extra time to remez/dazzle them with out them bashing on me.)  <br>If there is an insane number of guys around, but the tanks and cleric could be able to handle them all if they get them one by one, I will continue the aoe mez, (possibly root) and dazzle any singles I can, possibly ones that have been rooted far off  :)  , over and over until they are all dazzled.<br>If you know from experience that these are very high magic resist mobs, you could try workign with your tanks' taunt or root if necessary to tash first then start the aoe mez cycle<br><br>And although there should be time when you see a big pull to back away in preparation for ae mez so you don't mez yourself, if you do mez yourself, one mob might resist and attack you immediately, or it might wear off and they'll come after you<br><br>Don't forget if they are on you the cleric is open for heal.  Sometimes I might chain aoe mez and tash individuals if there are way way too many, and we are preparing for an evac.  Although yah you the chanter does haste and debuff, the primary and most important role of the chanter is crowd control.   <br><br>bottom line it is a matter of taste and style, but I do not use this style w/ aoe mez regularly---I use aoe mez for huge pulls or times when one of your members is very close to dying and has several on them--where there isn't enough time to taunt them all off or single mez them all off, so, basically, emergencies.  <br><br>oh! one more emergency hehe if the chanter is low on mana for some strange reason (maybe more applicable to lower levels) then aoe mez saves mana so the group can run to zone etc if it is plausible) Of course every case is different and must be evaluated case to case, but i have had a pretty good success rate for these general tactics in emergencies above :)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>To the 42nd chanter Helkiroo,<br>If you are all about mezzing the mobs go for it...and just hope you dont die! I agree totally with the lvl 56 chanter...never never use ae mez cause it doe's only lead to death...I dont care if you do got high charisma.The are still debating what charisma really does do, besides the fact that it does lower prices when buying and like after you have 130 charisma it really doesnt matter how much more charisma you do have. I think that if other people did have a chanter, you would really think about using ae mez, because if you do, plan on dying.Think about this....this has happened several times, Your killin and you got a sow'er in your group....the tank pulls 3 mobs and there is a group of 4 twinks......as soon as you use ae mez you aggro all the mobs except the one the tanks are on. Now on the other hand if you got a tank pulling a couple mobs at once and you get some extras then I believe the only way to help (without you dying)is tashan one then use entrance or whatever spell you have to mez at your level, and then just repeat to the next one. <br><br>LOL I dont know what it is about these people that try to post these posts, but you need to learn the advantages of the Encahnter's. One of the advantages is that our pets hit really fast, and have very low hit points...so dont use your pet that much...unless you use fear and lower the mobs speed and use a strength debuff. You will have to use your pet later on though so cast a pet when you fight maybe some small stuff so when you are a higher level you don't fizzle as much.If you think you are soo smart, then try killing every one of the spectres in Oasis at&nbsp;&nbsp;lvl 35. Do you know anyone who can take 6 specs at once and still at the end have about 40% mana left? Charm is an enchanters best friend. If you are in a group then your job is pretty much to tashan the mobs and lower there attack speed and haste your tanks, and if you have a pet add to the damage with a charmed pet. This is only my 2cp though.<br><br>DESPIZED GRAVEWALKER<br>37th LVL CHANTER.<br>Luclin Server<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Whew, where to start.&nbsp;&nbsp;OK first this is coming from the person who started this post, Tarnin (now 56 chanter).  First off, mister 42 chanter who says that if you can't mez the resists you are too slow.  Ok, if you're fast enough to mez the resists why not just single mez them all?  Easier that way because like the 56 poster said if you AE and get multiple resists you have multiple mobs on you.  And as for your statement that the mobs hit too fast and the tanks cant handle the beating, I'll say what I always say...let the mobs hit the guys in metal, not the guys in cloth.  They have at least 50% to 100% more hp then the chanter, and usually about twice the AC.  <br><br>Now for the 37 poster.  First off, you'll never fizzle your pet cause mez is a conjuration, if you're doing what you're supposed to be doing in a group, your conjuration and alteration will always max first.  As for what you said about AE, right on I think you're right, though i usually like to shoot out mez before tash unless i'm fighting things that resist alot...saves time, but it can take time away if you mess up...tough call there, hehe.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>this is a strat. for you lvl26-29 people.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most chanters go and find their own little group in ill omen to just sit back and mez all the extra sarnaks in the fort (yes, hunt in the fort at ill omen for this lvl, dont hunt giants).  Well, i tell you no.  Find a tank that is lvl 26+ and PARTNER with him, dont make a group larger than three people, just a waste of exp.  when he pulls give him a alacrity and start melee.  If you are a higher lvl than ur partner, the sarnak wont hit u, and u can screw up the sarnak's hits.  also, i have found a nifty combo, color stun, color shift.  they are stun spells that u get at lvl 4 and 20 (color shift you have to research =( ).  These two spells are low mana spells, and they stun for 4 and 6 secs. you can rotate them for about the hole fight and only loose 15-20% of ur mana, and the tank hasnt been hit yet! just a nifty little thing that i just fould useful. <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>got from wiz board...cool<br><br><br><br><br>I'm a level 22 Wizard and alot of us complain that our spells resists too much despite the fact that Wiz spells are the least resistible among all casters, by how much is just a mystery. <br><br>Against red cons, we can just forget about it. Resists, resists, resists... <br><br>The other night I was in a 6 people group. 2 monks, 2 druids, 1 enchanter and 1 wiz. We were taking things down fast, yellows and white cons. All my spells were consistently hitting for full even against the yellows which would normally do some partial resists. <br><br>Then a red con was pulled. Normally I would sit out or get up and whack with my staff since it's a waste of manna since it'll only resists. But I was at full manna so what the heck. <br><br>I casted stun and it stuck.. stunned it again and it stuck... hmmm. What the heck, with the mob hitpoint halfway down, I used my best DD at this point... Bam... hit for full... 174 points of Damage. A red con turned it's back after that and was beaten to death by the monks. <br><br>So I did a "/g All my spells were hitting that red one. Never happened before" <br><br>Then a response, "I was opening up with Tash on it... it lowers it's magic resistance, that's why you're hitting it for full." <br><br>My jaw dropped. So this is Verant's fix to the Wiz resist problem that they won't tell us. It's the Enchanter. I wanted to get up and hug that Chanter. Also wanted to ask him if he was a Verant programmer who wanted to show one wizzie that the Wizard is a balanced class. <br><br>That night in that group, I was master of Damage. I would cast 3 stuns and a Force Shock. Out of the 3 damagers in there, me and 2 monks, I was accountable for at least 38% of direct damage. That would leave 68% in between the 2 monks which comes down to 34% each. With my 3 stuns, they were probably getting an additional 5% each of free hits on the mob. So I could easily be attributed to 48% damage including damage incurred while mob is stunned. I could do more damage but I would never cast more than 4 times per fight to avoid going oom and what fun is it if the monks can't do their nice roundhouses and flying kicks. Chanter gave me breeze as well so I was giving my 38% for each mob. The Druids didn't involve themselves much in the fights since they focused there strategy on healing the 2 monks. <br><br>It was a fun night. The best night I've had in EQ so far. Makes me feel like I don't want to group with anyone anymore unless there is a Chanter opening up with Tash. <br><br>So all you whiny wizards out there who complain about resists. Verant has fixed it! They want you to be grouped with an Enchanter. PERIOD. <br> <br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
