	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hello fellow shamans,<br><br>	Having played EQ extensively in the past 3 years, including a lot of<br>time in the &quot;end game&quot; (there's no mob up to velious expansion that I<br>haven't killed beside tunare and AoW), and spending more and more time on my<br>shaman (lvl 45 now), I read those forums a lot lately and want to share some<br>info/experience with you. Also please excuse my english, it isn't prefect as<br>I am french. I am also very twinked out, so some of the equipment I talk<br>about might not be accessible yet to most shamans, but they are things any<br>shaman should try their hardest to get (JBB, fungi tunic, good weapons, etc)<br><br>	There's a few points I want to make, and the first is about melee.<br>True, shamans can not dish out damage like tanks, but to say that our melee<br>damage output is meaningless isn't true. With a good weapon a shaman can<br>deal some pretty decent dmg with melee. For example at 45 I use a rune<br>etched icewurm fang (12/19 proc 83 dd piercer) and blight (23/47 proc<br>scourge (procs more than any weapon i ever used) 2hb). I usualy don't melee<br>much while soloing anymore myself (did to about 35), but I'll get into that<br>later. My point here is that while it is not always the best choice to<br>melee, shaman do have pretty decent melee skills and not using/maxing them<br>can only make you less versatile. In a group at lvl 45, if there's a cleric<br>I usualy can stay pretty close to full mana at all time (I like having the<br>opportunity to have my full mana available if things go bad), so after I<br>slow/debuff the mob(s) we are fighting, I usualy jump in and take a few<br>wacks at the mob while I can/regen my mana back. So basicly, by the end<br>game, you can expect your shaman to have a very decent weapon, and you will<br>regret not having kept offense/defense/weapon skills maxed.<br><br>	Another thing I'd like to comment on is the AC versus Wis debate.<br>While I agree that wisdom is a nice thing to have and I try to keep it as<br>high as possible, even more important than your total mana is the speed at<br>wich we regen that mana. So I myself go for AC first, then wis/mana on<br>items. Exception to that rule is hp regen items. While most shamans cannot<br>afford a fungi tunic, imho an iksar ceremonial BP (wich go for about 5~10 k<br>on my server) is a must untill you get can5/torpor combo. You will see that<br>the added 5 hp/tick (or 15 for fungi) that stack with regen spell means you<br>will regain mana much faster. I do very well at 45 with only 157 wis and a<br>fungi. In fact at lvl 38 I soloed a lvl 45 named in stonebrunt (the tiger<br>that drops the monk footpads), took about 30 minutes of kiting and regen to<br>regain mana, but it worked. Killing something 7 lvl highers at that lvl is<br>not something to spit on, and there's no way I could have done that without<br>good regen items/ac (FYI I kited it, didn't even dream about meleeing, but<br>good ac helped me the few times I had to refresh sow/dots or can for more<br>mana). So imho above AC/wis you should look for an item with regen (iksar BP<br>should be easiest to get for most shammies, and if you ever get a fungi,<br>then your set for life (or at least till can5/torpor). When you get near 45<br>you should look for JB armor, nice ac and the effects allow you to keep your<br>tanks buffed even in most mana intensive groups (i usualy group with people<br>that do constant pulling, so keeping up with mana can be hard when you try<br>to buff everyone to the max). JB boot/arm/glove are pretty cheap nowadays<br>and every shaman should try to get them, as they really help a lot to save<br>on mana usage.<br><br>	When I solo I stand at max cast range and I pull with malise line.<br>Immediatly after spell has finished casting I start running away from the<br>mob. When spells recycle time is done (usualy 2.5 seconds later), I stop and<br>cast my best root. Then I go to max cast range again and put disease dot on<br>the mob (I cast disease before poison because it last longer so casting it<br>at start of fight means I usualy will get the full effect before the mob<br>dies). If root breaks from the dd part of the dot I run away from the mob<br>till I'm at max cast range and root again. Then I put poison DoT in. If root<br>breaks I run out of cast range and root again, that way mob NEVER hits me.<br>Once both dots are on the rooted/malised mob, I once again go to max cast<br>range and start Cannibalizing my mana back. Now that I dinged 45 I usualy<br>only put in 1 dot and JBB the mob to death. Sure JBB sometimes break root,<br>but since I do this mostly in outdoor zones I stay at edge of casting range<br>and can reapply root before the mob gets to me 95% of the time. In dungeons<br>(I do solo a lot in dungeons like CoM and solB and guk), that's where good<br>AC/defense comes in play. I have about 925 AC and can take a few hits<br>without a problem while I re-root the mob when it breaks. At 45 using those<br>techniques, I can solo pretty much anything that cannot summon.<br><br>	In groups I used to keep str on all tanks, sta/agi/AC/regen(if no<br>cleric) on the main taunter, and dex on whoever had a good proc'ing weapon,<br>talisman/speed on all melee. Now at 45 (45 rocks!) I can put str/agi/dex on<br>everyone with JB armor buffs (sure they are a little less than the best<br>stats buff, but keeping them on all tanks at all time without using a single<br>point of mana is really worth having 5 less str/agi/dex than the best buffs<br>would give). When all are buffed I make pet and from then on only cast to<br>slow/debuff mobs and then melee/can, I can usualy stay close to FM at all<br>time after that, with tanks fully buffed. I don't have JB legs/helm/BP, BP I<br>would only use for sta buff, since you'd have to kill me in RL to take the<br>fungi tunic off my chest slot, helm a) looks bad, and my little barbie<br>shammie is too cute without helm so I use non visible head piece (tranix<br>crown, also priceless for night vision) and b) charisma buff is meaningless<br>to me, only time I need cha is when I do alchemy, and I have gear/buffs for<br>that, I practicly NEVER use charm animals and only use a pet in a group<br>really, they are more of a pain when soloing IMHO. Legs I would never wear<br>since I have thurg quested legs. So basicly with very little fund a shaman<br>can get most of what I do (JB arm/gloves/boots, iksar bp for regen and a<br>decent weapon), and if you get richer or lucky you can upgrade to fungi/uber<br>weapon/JBB.<br><br>	A last point would be that IMHO, a shaman should never nuke at all.<br>At 45 i think my evoc skill is... hmmm 23 =). Having a lvl 60 mage I can<br>tell you that 1) shaman DD are really mana inneficient and 2) shaman Dots<br>are way more efficient than DD, sure it takes a little longer to kill one<br>mob, but the downtime is WAY less than with DD. In 45 lvl the only DD I used<br>regularly is JBB effect once i got lvl 45 )<br><br>	So this is how I view the shaman class, it's a very fun class to<br>play (although I played 7 past 30 and had fun with most of them), this is<br>after all, a game, and fun should be your priority =)<br><br>Khrana &lt;The Dark Exile&gt;<br>Lvl 45 shamanette of doom<br>7th hammer server<br><br>Artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few things to note here. First of all Fungi Tunics are still pretty rare on alot of servers, and those that have them will want no less than 30kpp for one. Iksar regen BP are about 6kpp on Luclin, still expensive but much more obtainable. Dont even think that you are going to be able to roll on a fungi as a shaman if it drops. Iceworm fangs are probably the nicest piercer you can weild pre-Epic, but are hard to find despite being shaman only--they are 6kpp minimum. Not sure what you are talking about on JB gear--I assume you meant the arms, gloves and helm as these are the 3 most common pieces. The BP only drops from Trakanon and the Legs ( clickable AGI buff ) only drop from Venril Sathir, head mob of KC. Note that these items are never for sale, and if you are an ogre or troll shaman hunting in KC will make you KOS in the OT Outpost, so unless you never plan on going thru there again dont hunt KC. You mention cannibalize 5/torpor combo, but as far as i know there is no Can 5--unless you are talking about the AA skill. Also torpor is level 60, and I believe it slows and snares you while its in effect, which is going to put a major damper on meleeing--i may be wrong. Also JBB's are rare as well, and when they come up for sale you will be about 10-15kpp lighter in the bank if you can get one. Casting your best root on a mob that is actively dotted and has a pet on it is a major waste of mana as its going to be broken very quickly--id use the level 5 root spell. Nice post if a late as any shaman who has all of this gear will Im sure already have a good method of getting items/XP. <br><br>54 Ogre Battleshaman on Luclin server--Aggrok<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Outstanding post, Khrana.&nbsp;&nbsp;Great information to be given out to many high level shamans, and I'm taking notes on what you say.  Here for the review of Allakhazam's readers is my post from a different message board regarding strategy and some of the problems that face shamans.  By the way, my shaman isn't wealthy or much of a twink, so while I value what you wrote, Khrana, there's no way I will ever own anything worth 5K Plat like the regen items you mentioned. =)  Okay, here goes.<br><br><br>------- Pasted Post -----------<br><br>I've been playing my shaman for some time now.  I'm<br>level 40 and taking a break from the game but still<br>enjoy visiting this thread.  Unfortunately when I made<br>this guy, I had no idea about EQ or how it worked, and<br>so he did NOT get his WIS maxed out at birth, like<br>every other shaman in the world.  Oh well, live and<br>learn.  It wasn't really until about level 15 to 20<br>that I realized that my buffs would more than make up<br>for any kind of starting stats that got dumped into<br>wisdom.  So my base WIS is like 90 I think :(   .  Oh<br>well, that being said, Gundark is clearly the best<br>looking shaman ever, with a bunch of CHA points.  WTF<br>was I thinking???  Anyways, that's not the point.<br>The point is this- I've been able to compensate for a<br>relatively low base wisdom by playing the shaman class<br>SMARTER, not HARDER.  Since I also dumped some points<br>into STA at birth, CANNIBALIZE has been the greatest<br>gift the spirits could have given to this dumb<br>barbarian.  Get your Regen on and your Cann on, and<br>your mana is well under control.  Even with stupid WIS<br>like me.  Have a few buddies that can heal ya up.  In<br>a battle, I cann myself just as fast as sometimes the<br>Tanks lose their HP.  That way, I'm not in the fray,<br>and getting mana to make up for early stupidity.  <br>The only HUGE drawback to having low base WIS is that<br>I cannot solo.  No way, DoT's and Dogs<br>notwithstanding.  Can't do it with such low mana pool.<br> By the way, the math on my mana seems to be that my<br>base mana is about 90% of Barbies with maxed out WIS<br>at any given level.  With all my equipment, my WIS is<br>around 160-165 these days.  Still not the brightest<br>light on the Christmas tree, but hey, whaddyagonnado?<br><br>First Item: Genabalizing<br>Now then, regarding the CANN series of spells.   I did<br>some research on it to find some stats.  <br>CANN 1 hurts you for 50 HP, but raises Mana by 28. <br>Ratio = .56 Mana per HP<br>CANN 2 hurts you for 67 HP, but raises Mana by 36. <br>Ratio = .53 Mana per HP<br>CANN 3 hurts you for 74 HP, but raises Mana by 41. <br>Ratio = .55 Mana per HP<br>CANN 4 hurts you for 148 HP, but raises Mana by 82. <br>Ratio = .55 Mana per HP.  <br>(Yeah, I like math and use big sentences and talk too<br>much.  I also don't use U or 4 or THX or whatever. <br>Bite me.  I'm published on actual paper, not just the<br>internet.  Are you?  THen SHUTTIT)<br>Now wait a minute, it looks like the Cann spells LATER<br>in the series are actually LESS EFFICIENT!  WTF???<br>You'd think that, rather than just increase the damage<br>to your body and increase the mana output, they'd<br>adjust it so the mana to HP ratio was slightly<br>IMPROVED with each successive spell.<br>Hmmmm.<br>Dadgummit, that's a cryin shame.  Anyways, I guess<br>that all the way up through the 50's and to 60, I'll<br>just keep on using the same old 50 HP Cann spell. <br>More battle spam?  Who cares.  More mana.<br><br>Next item: the DOG.<br>There's been some debate as to whether or not the dog<br>is worth having around.  I'd have to guess that a<br>smarter Shammy with more Mana could heal him up and<br>buff him and do pretty well soloing.  But by 34,<br>you're pretty much done with that, I don't care HOW<br>wise you are :)  I like to think of the DOG as a FREE<br>DOT.  Cast him once, OUCH you lose a bubble to two<br>bubbles of mana, but that's soon recovered.  If you're<br>in a good group, he can help out the other melee<br>folks.  He won't ever hit very hard compared to your<br>ogre warrior friend, or that crazy Ranger shooting her<br>Velium war bow or whatever with double critical hits<br>and all that, but he's still there, nippin at the mobs<br>heels.<br>He rarely will take damage, he doesn't do enough to<br>get aggro.  He's a free DoT in every subsequent battle<br>after you cast him.  I find it funny that sometime<br>earlier on the thread people were saying the dog<br>SUCKS.  (shrug) Compared to pretty much every other<br>pet in the game, you bet.  But sheesh, free damage<br>people.  C'mon.  <br>One thing though, keep that mutt under control. <br>Listen to your chanter, and make DARN sure you target<br>the main tanks mob and /assist before sending the pup<br>in.  Can't have him breaking mezzes.  He does that to<br>me and my ENC buddy, I /pet get lost him ASAP.  He's<br>good and free damage and all, but he's not worth that.<br> If you can't control your pet, leave him in the spell<br>book.  I think that THOSE are the people who say that<br>the dog sucks... the ones who don't know how to work<br>him.<br><br>Final Item: Spells to Memorize.  <br>Don't do this thing I see so many SHM do, where you<br>sit down, memorize all your buffs, then massively buff<br>all at once.  You should keep buffs on a &quot;cycle.&quot;  You<br>get a feel for how long your buffs last.  When you get<br>into a group, first thing to do is buff yourself with<br>DEX-- or get a time stamp so that you know when the<br>buffs are about to fade.  I always buff myself with<br>DEX first.  That way, when my arm icon starts to<br>blink, I know that my tanks are about to say &quot;DEX<br>FADING&quot; or &quot;DEX PLZ.&quot;  You see your own fading,<br>refresh it and target all your melees in order.  Use<br>the F1-F6 keys for this by the way, not the mouse. <br>And your dog you can target by clicking F1 twice.<br>Why DEX instead of STR?  Your guys will get more hits<br>in.  Sure, they might not be as BIG as they are when<br>you STR them, but trust me, quantity over quality<br>regarding the hits.  I'd rather have my tank hit 5<br>times in 20 seconds for 50 each time because his DEX<br>is higher, than 3 times for 80 in the same time<br>because of STR.  Plus, if you think about it, at the<br>levels I'm talking about, your tanks have weapons that<br>proc.  They need DEX to do that.  Free damage baby. <br>DEX your crazy Bard too while you're at it.  Their songs<br>will be less likely to end because they can't hit an F<br>chord.  They don't even know that, crazy singers.  But<br>DEX 'em anyway.<br>Then, after a couple minutes (once the mana is back<br>where you started) replace the DEX spell with STR in<br>the slot.  STR your guys.  Do this again with AGI,<br>that keeps em from getting hit.  Might wanna get the<br>casters or clerics too, if you got mana to spare. <br>Sometimes they DO get aggroed, and the AGI MIGHT just<br>help them avoid getting hit.  STA is of course last,<br>for Tanks only (not melees, but TANKS, there's a<br>difference.)  More STA = more HP.  Remember, though<br>you gotta buff yourself so you know when each of these<br>buffs progressively are fading.  Not all at once, but<br>one statistic every three four or five minutes or so. <br><br>AC Buffs or my personal favorite, the Talisman of<br>Tnarg or whatever spell you are of appropriate level<br>for.  That thing lasts FOREVER, it seems, and is a<br>nice little HP buff.  Usually it stacks with HP buffs<br>that other people are putting on your guy. <br>Don't forget the best speed buff you have.  It fades faster, but keep it up on the guys.  <br><br>If you did the job right, you will see your arm buffs<br>fade, not all at once in a bad battle, but one at a<br>time with plenty of chance for your brain to rest<br>between.  You see yours going, hit your guys.  This is<br>my favorite right here.<br><br>Crazy_Warrior tells the group, &quot;DEX Fading.&quot;<br>Crazy_Warrior tells the group, &quot;Oh, never mind you got<br>it.&quot;<br>Incredibly_Efficient_Shaman tells the group, &quot;How are<br>other buffs?&quot;<br>Crazy_Warrior tells the group, &quot;All still there, thx.&quot;<br>Snobby_Palidin tells the group, &quot;Yup.  THX.&quot;<br>Mana_Greedy_Druid tells the group, &quot;I don't have any<br>buffs.&quot;<br>Incredibly_Efficient_Shaman tells the group, &quot;I know.&quot;<br><br>By the way, if you got a Druid, ask that tree hugger<br>to SoW and Chloro your party-- they got the Pack<br>Spirit and whatnot.  More efficient than you.  Any<br>druid that doesn't do this is being greedy with mana. <br> (heheh, one of my best friends in game is a Druid, I<br>just like to hassle 'em.  They think they can buff<br>people haha.)  Let them STR your tanks if you want,<br>but I guarantee you that the tanks will be asking for<br>refreshes all the time.  <br><br>You'll have to decide for yourself which stat enhancing buffs to give which tanks.  Not all Shamans want to cast STA.  That's fine.  It's a preference thing with me, and if I can do it with low base wisdom efficiently using the cycle method, I figure why not go ahead and keep it up?  After all, it can't HURT your warrior, can it?<br><br>So spell slots should be:<br>1: Current Buff from the Cycle<br>2: CANNIBALIZE<br>3: Slow Debuff<br>4: Red-Arm Debuff (I forget it's name at the moment. <br>Make's mob frail though)<br>5: DoT 1<br>6: DoT 2<br>7: DoT resist debuffer.  Usually Malaise or<br>something-- or another DoT.<br>8: Best heal you got.  <br><br>Oh and here's something in the lower levels... if you<br>get into a group where they think you are the healer,<br>LEAVE.  Our heals can't hold a candle to other folks. <br>If you have no cleric, make DAMN sure you got a buddy<br>druid or Pally or someone who has SOME kind of heal<br>comparable to yours.  We are BACKUP healers, and any<br>group that thinks they're gonna tackle the sarnaks at<br>level 23 or something like that with only a shaman or<br>only a druid for a healer is deluding themselves. <br>They better have a 'chanter or two of us backup heal<br>types for crowd control and trauma medicine.  You're<br>NOT a healer, you are a buffer.  The more you buff<br>your guys (and girls) the more you will ALL live.  The<br>more they think you are there to be the main healer,<br>the more trouble you'll get into.<br>Do we never heal?  Bah, of course we heal all the<br>time.  We're there with our best heal ALWAYS memorized<br>just to be ready in case things go bad on your CLERIC<br>or if she's out of brain power or whatever.  <br><br>That's the great thing about us Shamans.  We're really<br>good at one thing (buffing and de-buffing) and a Jack<br>of all Trades in pretty much everything else.  DD,<br>DoT, Heals, utility spells like night vision and what<br>not.  Shoot, I've even been able to contribute some to<br>the actual melee battles going on from time to time. <br>A real Swiss-Army Knife of a class. <br><br>Okay, it's huge, I'm sorry.  But I hope that this has<br>been useful to you in playing your Shaman effectively.<br><br>Gundark Viresdator (Strengthgiver) of Xev<br>Shaman of the Tribunal, 40th Winter.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
