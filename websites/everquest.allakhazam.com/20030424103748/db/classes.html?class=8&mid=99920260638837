	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hi! I'm Tatiyanna, a 16th Season Wood Elf Druid.<br><br>Okay, here is what I know for lvling, some of it I know by not doing :( <br><br>Ok, even though you don't really care about loot for yourself personally, I would suggest building it up when you are able. While Buffs go a long way to helping newbies, being able to donate the occassional armor or plat is always a good thing. Heh heh, I know. :) Also, if you team up with a 'chanter, the two of you can pool your resources and his/her mana to make good enchanted Jewelry for newbies, with hp, mana, stats, protections...<br><br>And it so happens that the places I am going to suggest do also have good loot...<br><br>Ok, you don't care about quests, but I would suggest playing with a couple that involve mobs you are fighting.<br><br>Pixies: there are a couple of quests for pixie dust in Kelethin (rangers and rogues guilds) and you can rid the world of those pesky buggy chicks AND! get xp for killing them, as they are probably even to you or blue.<br>Bats: Save bat wings, because you'll want them come lvl 14. I would save about 75% of them. The rest I would give to Niola Impholder in Felwith, in the mage's guild. For a spell, sell it back to her, and XP. <br>Orc Pawns: Some of them drop Orc Hatchets, which you can turn in at the Ranger's guild for xp and something else, but I don't remember what.<br><br>I suggest these because it is basically extra xp on mobs you are already killing in the newbie area. The pixie dust for Rangers is also a free bag until you turn it in :)<br><br>Once you are around lvl 5, head to Orc Hill. You can get a group, or if there are enough people on the hill, solo. Fight Orc Cents and get those belts! Put them in the bank and hold on to them.<br><br>Stay around orc hill until about lvl 7. You should get some good xp here. By lvl 7, you should be able to get a group for Crushbone. Depending, you can do this at lvl 6, but only with people who are 7 or 8, and who know what they are doing.<br><br>Mid way through lvl 7, you should have a good number of Orc Belts. Hightail it to Kaladim and turn them all in until you ding lvl 9. If you don't have armor yet, you have most of the components you will need now. You will have lots of extras. Put together sets so that you have stuff to give away later, and pull some out to sell.<br><br>You should still be bound at Kelethin. Gate back and head to the guild. You are lvl 9 now. You should have enough money banked that you can buy your lvl 9 spells. Get Treeform, Ward Summoned, Light Healing, Thistle Coat, Shield of Thistles, and Ignite for sure. Sell your extra armor peices here. <br><br>You have some choices. I would hang around Crush for a little longer. You can get into groups and get good xp at Slaver Caves for a while. Free slaves for merchant faction. (this will be good, because better faction = better prices, and you can buy/sell for people who are kos or just outsiders to gfay for better than they'd do on thier own). It is also extra xp for killing orc slavers.<br><br>Around Lvl 10 or 11, go to Steamfont. If you want, you can already head there at lvl 9, depending on if you are bored with Crushbone or not.<br><br>At Steamfont, you can use Treeform and solo Elementals, drakes, etc. Use Ward Summoned on eles. It is a great spell to have. Elementals sometimes drop gems,and so do drakes. If you are inclined, save them for enchanting jewelers later. You can bank them in bags or boxes, and they are stackable.<br>You can also group here for Mino Cave,which is really great xp in this zone.<br>You can stay in steam until probably lvl 12.<br><br>Welcome to Lvl 12. I would like to introduce to you two things.<br><br>1. lesser faydark and the sister camp<br>2. dagnor's cauldron and unrest keep<br><br>Starting really at lvl 10 or 11 you can get a small group and go pick on the Nybright Sisters. Again, great xp, a fast spawning camp, and a quest that you can complete (xtra xp for killing them) in Kelethin. Save what you get to give away, but if you get the bearskin gloves, wear them. I love mine<br><br>At lvl 12, go to Unrest. This VERY dangerous zone is a great place to lvl in your teens through the 20's, dispite the dangers. Even the blue mobs give excellent xp. When you first come here, start in a large group until you are used to it, then you can get a smaller group. Camp the back yard and take out yard trash until your 20's, when you want to get into a near-full group again and start into the house.<br><br>Now, for teens, everyone says "oasis oasis oasis". I hate oasis. i really didn't find the xp to be that great, the zone was too crowded and i tended to die of stupid things because people around me were either too lagged to help or simply wouldn't help. Also, while loot isn't important, you will need money for your spells, and Oasis isn't the place to get it. Great that you can get up through 19, and probably to 24 in oasis. So, you got your lvl, how you going to get your spells, hmm?<br><br>That ends my oasis rant. Lake of Ill Omen is supposed to be really good. But, it is also VERY crowded and only accessible if you have the Kunark expansion, which some of us don't yet. ;)<br><br>Alright, you should be able to play around in Unrest until lvl 14. Now, hightail it back to Kelethin. You should have plenty of money for your spells because Unrest is just sooooo wonderful for loot. Hey, if you loot a pristine carapace, which you will, stop in Kaladim. There is a guy at the warriors guild who will make cool armor for 23gp. It is worth it, because while you can't use it (gnomes, dwarves and halflings only) you can auction it later or give it away. It is very nice armor. So, bank it. <br><br>Okay, now you have SoW, and so begins your saint whatever career. :) <br><br>We are quickly hitting my lvl of expertise, because I am only lvl 16, but I will atleast get you to where I am and on your way to the 19 and 24 marks.<br><br>Start travelling. You can get all your great travelling spells, SoW, Lev, etc. And Bind. Start Auctioning your SoWs and Binds where ever you go. This will get your name out there and people will know to come to you when they have need of buffs now and ports later. Oh, offer to give free food and water, since you can summon it. Just remind people it is norent<br><br>You want to travel. Because it does little good to dump someone somewhere and not be able to tell him how to get where he is going. If you study the maps, yeah, that is ok. But it is better to travel the zones and be able to warn and advise travellers. :) <br><br>Go to Freeport first and learn your way around. You can do Binds and SoWs at West Gate. You will get LOTS of takers.<br><br>Now, head out to East Commons. If you have a regular to partner with, drag him along. Otherwise, find someone, a tank preferably or a mage, and go to Nektulos and head to Lavastorm. Sneak past the guard with Camo.<br><br>If you have the Mage, play in Lavastorm for a while. You still get good xp on blues. Lava Crawlers are what you really want to hunt, and they are easy to take down with Expulse Summoned. I have even taken down yellows solo with it, but was oom after. You'll loot bloodstones. Save them for an enchanter, as mentioned above. Same with any other jewel that you find. Watchout for fire eles, they agro. so do sprites, and they hurt. Leave basks alone. The Shadowed Men don't wander unless pulled.<br><br>when done playing in Lava, or if you aren't with another caster, then pick on the guard outside Lava. PUll him from inside the zonecavern to avoid iron and stone guardians. He will be good xp for a while, and will vary in lvl. He hits hard so let a pet or tank tank him, and keep them buffed. They have strong resists to snare and hail, but not to fire, so I use ignite on them. Use either snare or swarm to pull them.<br><br>Once you get the hang of the guards, you can play with the ones on the bridge. I would head back out to commons and find someone to share the bridge. You take one side, they take the other. If you don't you will end up pulling the entire bridge in one pull. These guys have a HUGE agro radius and a HUGE social radius. But they are GREAT xp, drop a bronze sword every time, AND sometimes words,which you can give to caster friends for research.<br><br>If your saintly side feels bad about hunting guards in someone elses newbie zone, look at your faction hits. You are striking at the Indigo Brotherhood for making that infernal alliance with the Orcs in Gfay. :) Hee hee one of my guild's tag lines<br><br>Other places to go ehre for the teens: Befallen, which is hidden off of West Commons. the first lvl will probably be green to you, but keep going down. You'll find stuff. There is an xp bonus here. Read LVL. It is a dangerous zone, but seems to be worth it (I've not really gotten to explore it yet, but it looks wonderful from what i've seen). This is also loot heavy, but you gotta save for spells :)<br><br>In your mid-late teens you can group for HIgh Pass hold, another good place for xp. <br><br>Remember that armor? Well, head to Rivervale. You can either auction it to a halfling druid (and whatever other class can wear it) or give it to a newbie one. which ever.<br><br>Now, head out the the Karanas. You want the Karanas zone that is right out of HIghpass. Don't remember which it is. <br><br>This is a great zone to kite and charm animals. You should have befriend animal. I would suggest charming a green cat (they hit hard) and letting it tank something tougher. Greens stay charmed longer. You can give it the /pet commands. woo hoo. And it is so nice to see a cat charm amiable for a change. :)<br><br>Kite here for a little while, using SoW and snare, or fearkite animals with a panic animal and a pet. You can solo. Or group to take on Crag Spiders. Have your heal poison spell memmed. Very important. I would suggest a mage to help you with them, and use charmed cats. Griffawns (FAWNS) are good xp too. Two people with pets can take these easy and it is still good xp. <br><br>when you are ready to travel again, head to Qeynos. You can visit surefall if you need druid spells still. <br><br>There is little for you to do here at your level, but explore and get to know the land. People will want to come here, and you can give them a quick where-to-go.<br><br>Done? ok. Go to (erk, erk) Erudin. The only thing you care about here is getting to Stonebrunt Mountains. This is supposed to be like LOIO and is supposed to be great xp. It should carry you through your 20's if you want.<br><br>I suggest heading back to Dagnor's Cauldron in your late teens. You can group there for goblins. These guys are DEFINATELY great xp. Between Dag and SBM you should be able to make it through your 20's. Kite in the Karanas for a change of pace. If you have Kunark, there are supposed to be great kiting zones there too.<br><br>Ok, I hope this helps.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>"In waking a tiger, use a very long stick." -Mao Tse-Tung.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Okay, I don't normally play on pvp. I have an enchanter on, I think Rallos, for when Qell is down or I don't want to hear "but I lost my corpse" on the guild channel. <br><br>I'M KIDDING! really, on the guild channel part. I'm kidding. I'm a good guild mommy.<br><br>But, from what I've been reading on PVP's. The worst places for PVP are probably going to be Lavastorm and maybe Oasis. But I would avoid oasis anyways because it is a waste of time, and Lava is not a must. It is just a really great zone.<br><br>If you are lucky and aren't on when pvp dweebs are on, then you will be fine when on Feydwer. If you are worried about Steam, find a spawn point for what you want to hunt away from the mino caves. Few people will notice you, and you will be in Treeform.<br><br>My other tip for pvp is ALWAYS stay anonymous or in /roleplay mode. This keeps people from knowing what you are in /who queries and hunting you down. tee hee<br><br>Also, unless said druid is hunting people on pvp, someone would have to be a total dweeb or STUPID to go hunting druids. Druids can be your best friend because of SoW, Ports, and killer buffs. Everyone is always begging me for SoWs on Quell. If I as on PVP and someone killed me, then wanted SoW, I would laugh, then use the tactics I described later for pvp fighting. :)<br><br>Okay, before I get flamed for my above post. Treat PVP's like mobs with brains (making assumptions there, but hey *wink*). <br><br>Gee, i'm feeling my p's and q's.<br><br>Only stupid people, IMO, are going to pvp you in a dungeon. Unless they are high enough lvl not to be agro'd. Them, I call jerks. anyways, we all have better things to worry about in dungeons than attacking other players. Besides, you might need help from those players so DON"T ATTACK OTHERS IN A DUNGEON!!!<br><br>and, um, this was in reply to someone on tunare. Last time I was on Tunare, it wasn't PVP<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>"In waking a tiger, use a very long stick." -Mao Tse-Tung. Did he go to Stonebrunt too?</td></tr>
