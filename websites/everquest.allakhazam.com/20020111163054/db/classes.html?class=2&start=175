I have been trying to decide which is a better rogue race;  Barbies or Dwarves.  Taking everything into consideration, it's very close.  First I was set that Barbies were better.  Then I was convinced that Dwarves are.  Now (I'm very unstable, huh?) I am leaning a little back to Barbies.  Confusing, isn't it?  What do you think.  Please don't just say, "This ones better.", give me some reasons.  This will help any newbies to the rogue class.

Also safe fall has a hard cap of 94; you can never raise it above that. It took me 5 lvls wondering why it wasn't improving to figure it out. Checkout the FAQ under rogue guides at thesafehouse.org for all the skill limits. As for improving backstab, you have two options. Group all the time, and you will see your backstab skill skyrocket, or stay soloing, in which case you won't really use backstab that much anyway. I suggest option A. The cool thing about backstab is that as the skill goes up, so do your backstabs.<br>&nbsp;<br>Daviv McD 26th Dwarf Rogue<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13233" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13233</a></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Dude, I've just gotta flame you for this. I can see how AGI would be good for warriors, although STA might be more important for them, because they're tanks; it's their job to know how to take damage. The rogue's job is to DO damage. They can do the most melee damage of any class in the game and quite possibly the most damage of any class overall if you know what you're doing and play it right. Which means forget about AGI and AC. Everyone keeps saying that STR and DEX items are easy to come by. SO WHAT? You can never have too much STR and DEX, so why not start with higher anyway? Nobody seems to notice that AC and AGI are even easier to come by. Obviously, AC comes with pretty much any armor you'll actually wear, and AGI comes along with most of the DEX pieces I wear. I've got +49 in DEX items, and +20 AGI came with it, without even looking for AGI items. By the time I fight mobs w/ 32k HP, I doubt I will be doing only 300 extra damage than others. I do 100-200 more damage than others in my group right NOW, and often I do more than everyone else put together (not counting casters of course cuz I couldn't see how much they hit for, but once I had a pally, a tank, and a monk, all higher lvl than me, who couldn't match my damage together) And at the same time, I doubt I would take more damage than others. Unless something goes terribly wrong and all the tanks die, I won't take more than a scratch cuz evade (evade works off of hide, which is guess what...a DEX skill). Even then there are monks and other rogues and whatnot who will probably get picked on first. So unless you're planning on soloing the deities and dragons of the world, forget AGI.<br>&nbsp;<br>Daviv McD 26th Dwarf Rogue<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13233" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13233</a></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>In addition to that, cuz I was running out of time while I wrote it, you try to assume too much about me. I originally picked a rogue cuz I thought they looked cool, with all the cool skills they could do. I thought it would be nice to go around sneaking and hiding and role-playing that I was above the common folk and I had advantages over all the folk and stuff like that. It wasn't til later that I realized that rogues actually rocked, and it was later yet when I realized that rogues are one of the main damage dealers in combat. I wouldn't want to role-play a caster except maybe a hybrid because frankly in role-playing terms they are wusses, always staying back from the main combat and letting their nukes/pets do the work for them. If you actually read any fantasy books you'll find that the casters are generally better in combat overall, making them the most powerful kind of characters. Well anyway I don't really play to role-play that much, and I don't play to be a "power gamer" or whatever other kind of crap you wanna label me with, I just play to have fun. Heh here's something to ponder, you admit that the rogue's job is to do damage, and then you say that str/dex isn't the only part of the equation. So ummm, how does AGI fit into the damage equation?

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I never argued that agil was most important that is up to debate.  I was simply stating that agility can give you more than str can point for point.  Simply put 1 extra str may add a slight amount to your overall damage but 1 extra point of agility can save you from taking far greater damage.  Yes a rogue damage is his main assest but even with evade you will take damage.  A good backstab can turn the mob on you just for a second til evade goes off and that 1 second can be 1000 damage against very powerful mobs.  Evade does not work all the time (ie you can fail the skill check) then you can move (underwater evade has a much smaller chance of working, on hills or steep land can cause you to fail because you moved) and finally higher level mobs when they are tend to stun or push you a bit when they hit you also causing evade to fail.  During those times you can take significant damage if your agility and AC have been sacrificed for str and dex, the added damage you do is such a insignificant percentage of the MOBS hitpoints but when you get hit the mob does substantial percentage of your hitpoints.  For those that like to look at numbers MOB about 55 hits (with fists this doesn't count magic) for about 275 damage max per hit with a possiblity of 4 hits per round.  You do say a max of 75pts with 4 hits per round and a possibly BS of 400pts every 3-4 rounds.  The extra few points in str may bring your max to 80 and backstab to 450.  Assuming max potential giving an extra 20 pts per round and extra 50 more every 3-4 rounds so about an extra 130damage in 4 rounds with the mobs potential damge of 4400 in 4 rounds.  If that extra agility/AC helps you dodge just one of those 16 hits you save 275 hitpoints.  I do not claim this to be anything more than just an example in order to portray the concept.  Also in your life as a rogue you run into mobs that will attack you and you need to escape extra agility/ac might help you last a bit longer to escape and more so when you are attacked by a green mob or multiple green mobs your agility/ac will make them miss a lot more than just the level difference.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Sorry if I sounded a bit grumpy in my last post. Well ok I was grumpy; it was after I died 6 times in Sol A and before I turned the sparkle purse in. Well anyway...yay! You have a great argument; which is what I asked for. And you clarified that you are not arguing that AGI is the best stat, which is also good. Now for my defense: You are comparing str to agi in your argument. That's worse than comparing apples to oranges; it's like comparing the color of an apple to the sweetness of an orange. I'll explain: Str and Dex make up the offensive skills, while Sta and Agi make up the defensive. Str determines your max damage, while dex determines how good you are at doing that damage. In the same way, sta determines your max hitpoints, and agi determines how well you can keep your hitpoints. To be fair, you should either compare str to sta, dex to agi, or both str and dex to sta and agi. Also, when you go into number crunching with the stats, you're treading in unknown waters. No one save Verant knows the exact equations used in determining damage done or taken. Heck, they might have thrown charisma in those equations somewhere just for the fun of it. Besides you're not being objective with how effective agi and str are. You say that one extra point in agi will help avoid 1000s of points of damage? Get real. If you're going on the basis of that one extra point helping you make one more dodge or parry or whatever, than in the same way one more point in dex will help you make one more successful evade. True, evade doesn't always work. But the effects of evade are additive; one successful evade can last throughout the entire battle. I have a macro that evades every time I backstab, and the mobs completely ignore me, even when I miss an evade while making a huge backstab at the same time. I'm not saying that agi is completely useless; there are times when the mob does attack me and doesn't get off for a second or two. But the thing is my agility is good enough that I don't have to worry about it. One point of agility is NOT going to save a rogue every time, but one point of str and/or dex WILL always make him more effective in battle. One thing you forgot about is dex; dex makes you attack faster and connect more, as well as proccing your weapon more. It also helps evade work better, and makes you run faster. If I had mobs after me who I didn't want to fight, I'd rather run away from them faster then be able to take more punishment. Str doesn't do as much as dex, but it will increase the max of every hit you make, so along with dex your potential will increase exponentially. Agi is purely a defensive stat, and rogues just aren't in a defensive position enough to make this that important of a statistic. One more thing: I don't agree with your example being limited to only mobs w/ 30k+ HP. Many of the people who play EQ will never make it to that point. At least at my level, I am the main damage dealer in the groups I am in. The more damage I do, the quicker the battle is, the less damage the tanks will take, and the happier the group is in general. And as I said before, the mobs do attack me once in a while, but I just tell the cleric not to heal me; I'll be fine. And I am; I have all misses filtered out, so most of the time when a mob attacks me it doesn't even show up on the log.<br>&nbsp;<br>Daviv McD 26th Dwarf Rogue<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13233" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13233</a></td></tr>

Half Elves and Wood Elves have average stats, as do humans, with the benefit of night vision.  Dark Elves also have the ability to gain great strength, but their weakness lies in stamina not dexterity or not and agility.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I'm afraid you will get a lot more than you bargained for, Mr. Newbie. Me, Tally, Ishkur, and Anon will all be likely to fight over this post for another month. To try to reduce the amount of arguing on my part, I will state as much of my opinion as I can in this post. Until a new argument is made which is not covered by this post, I will not post any more replies on the subject. So let's begin, shall we? First of all, all that I say will be in the highest interest of those like Mr. Newbie who would like to know what rogue race would be the BEST to play, and what to put his points in. Please do not flame me because I put role-playing aside, or because I declare a race as "best" when all rogue races CAN rock. I will simply not reply to any such flames; I am arguing on the terms of facts and technical issues only. Thus said, we begin by looking at what stats are most important to a rogue. STR and DEX are the most important two, although which of these is more important is up to how you want to play your rogue. Higher STR means higher backstabs (the rogue's most important skill by far) and higher regular hits (don't forget these too). Higher DEX means faster attacks, less missing, more hits for max, more weapon procs, most rogue skills and offensive skills improving faster, those same skills succeeding more, and more damage done with bow/range weapons. DEX gives you lot more advantages, but STR gives you an advantage you can clearly witness in battle. After these, STA and AGI are next important. I'm not going to go into exactly what these do, just let you know these are pretty much only defensive stats. Since you probably won't be in a defensive position all that much, unless you plan on soloing, I don't consider these stats to be all that important. WIS, INT, and CHA are all on the bottom, and you shouldn't put any points into these upon creation. So just using STR and DEX, we find that barbies start with a total of 183 in these, with the stats leaned heavily towards STR. However, dwarves start with a total of 190, plus the points are more easily distributed. I sorta chuckle when I read that half-elves are very well balanced and they have DEX and what-not. Sorry, but they only have 165 total STR and DEX, and even though most of that comes from their DEX, dorf's DEX is still better. Halflings aren't much better with 170. Dark elves come dead last at a mere 145. (A little aside here to those who think dark elves rock: sure your dark elf MIGHT rock, but they have the worst potential. This post is for those who want to start with the best character they can possibly make.) Now, this method of calculation is very selective, but if we were to include AGI, I believe we should also include some way to make these not as important in the calculating. Using the popular method of statistical weighting, let's give a weight of 2 to each STR and DEX, and 1 to AGI. Barbies come in at 458, dorfs at 460, half-elves at 430, halflings at 445, and dark elves down at 390. Only if you consider AGI as important as STR and DEX (a laughable concept), will you find dwarves NOT in the lead. So my opinion is if you want to get the best kick-ass rogue possible, pick a dwarf. They also get infravision, which is pretty nice. Although if you're a barbarian you can just turn up the brightness until you get a mask of deception. Barbarians also get slam to stun their opponents so you can get around them and backstab; however, I don't think this is really an advantage as you will most often be in a group with a tank anyway. There are two things I think you should NOT pick a certain race for; one is if that race starts with a skill at a higher value already, such as halflings who start with hide 'n' sneak at 50. Trust me, in the realm of EQ, it takes practically no time to get a character's skills from 0 to 50. Besides, you won't be needing these skills much before level 10 anyway. The other thing you should NOT pick a race for is to look as "cool" as a dark elf. Go get yourself a mask of deception and you can look as cool as you want, get ultravision, and still not have to have crappy strength. That's about all I have to say about picking a race; about what to put your stats in: put 'em into STR and DEX only; distribute them how you want to play your rogue, either inhumanly strong or inhumanly fast, or a balance of both. It's up to you. As I wrap up this huge post, I'd like to once again stress how this is a FACT-based post meant for those who are interested in playing the BEST rogue they can.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I was the only dorf rogue around for a long time and now the trend is spreading, making me look normal instead of extraordinary. =P. Yeah I once though AGI was great also, but I'm not seeing anything good come of it. All it does is raise AC and help with purely defensive skills. Even with my high AGI I rarely maxed out these skills cuz I was rarely in a defensive position. If you wanna get good dueling stats, however, I'd think that AGI and DEX would BOTH be more important than STR. That's cuz you gotta act like you're soloing.

High DEX give more frequent proc's.  DEX can allow you to run a bit faster, too.  Useful when chasing or fleeing.  Unlike most melee types, with a rogue its not how much damage you do at once, its how fast you deal it out.  AGI is nice for the AC boost but its so easy to get decent armor.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Wow you've had one too many cups of java there, little guy! You should register with Allakhazam; you seem to have lots of opinions poppin' out all the time. Anyway, yeah you can't start on the epic til you're lvl 50. Your reward for it is the Ragebringer (link here: <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4066" target=_new>http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4066</a> ). Along the way you probly get tons o' xp and pp as well. I'm assuming you meant bloodstained fang instead of tooth; that is definitely a sweet weapon for lower level rogues. I kept mine until level 20. Unfortunately, they are a lore item, which means you can only own one of them. That sucked for me cuz a guy wanted to trade me a mask worth over 800pp for my bloody fang, but the trade automatically cancelled cuz he already had one. I suggest getting a low delay piercer for off-hand, like a walrus tooth or dragoon dirk. Get a dragoon dirk anyway cuz you can stick it in range and have it out of the way but still get the stat boosts from it. If you can find em, get a stiletto of the bloodclaw or an obsidian shard; prices could range anywhere from 50-150pp, with the shard being the cheaper of the 2. They have ratios comparable to walrus tooth and dragoon dirk, and also have procs. Shard does a 30dd spell and drains like 6-8 AC from the mob, and stiletto has a 50 DoT spell. The thing is these don't proc til lvl 16 or 18 and they don't have stats. Haha yes moonstone rings are everywhere; I even found one myself once. Some guy just gave it to me cuz he was like 5pp short in a deal with me. I didn't keep it cuz I traded it and 50pp for a fire emerald platinum ring (+5 STR +5 DEX, avg price 275pp. tell me that ain't sweet =P) Anyway they sell for about 50pp. Don't plan on getting one off a mob anytime soon though; they drop off of a lvl 42-44 mob in Lower Guk. The reason these rings are all over the place, at least in my guess, is cuz these are the same mobs that drop FBSS's (Flowing Black Silk Sash, 21% permanent haste, avg price of 7.5Kpp). <br>I love beating up higher lvl warriors and monks and whatnot that think they will own me. When I was 10, I hopped into the arena with a 17 warrior. Thinking I would completely suck, he let me get a first backstab off. So I did, and at first I just stood face to face with him and kept attacking. When I was down to a bubble of health, I hid and bandaged myself back up to half. He, surprised how much I had hurt him but not worried in the least also backed up and started to heal. However, his method of healing was just sitting down; he didn't have any bandages! So I crept up and popped him another backstab. He was annoyed, but still not worried. I attacked him a little until he turned around, then I immediately hid again. Snuck around, backstab. After every time I backstabbed him and hid, he would run around in circles for a little but always sit down eventually. By the time I got him down to one bubble of health, I was completely healed, so I was just gonna finish him off with regular hits. Unfortunately, he got a 53 warrior friend to come in and help him; I just barely crawled out of the arena before he could kill me. If he didn't have his friend there though, I woulda creamed him!<br>&nbsp;<br>Daviv McD 26th Dwarf Rogue<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13233" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13233</a></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>First of all, it's rogue.  To many people make that mistake and I know that Daviv is gonna nail ya for that one.  Ok, now for my thoughts on the races.  For the sake of the people who disagree with me on everything, I will point out (like I usually do) that these are IN MY OPINION.  Now, this is how I see it:<br><br>Barbarians:  (used to be my #1 rogue race, kinda between them and dwarves now) BEST starting stats (nobody I've met has disagreed with this), slam (like you said, very cool, I haven't really pointed this one out before, but it is nice), being tall is not good in most situations (some doors are predjudice against us), night vision sucks.  Notice I'm not pointing out how to fix the problems this time because I know you've all heard it.<br><br>Dwarves:  (The more I read about these guys, the more I am convinced that they are the best rogues) second best starting stats IN MY OPINION (some will argue with this, but I think they have the second best because the way the points are spread out), good night vision, and short.<br><br>Halflings:  VERY over-rated IN MY OPINION, they have excellent dex/agi, short, good night vision, VERY LOW STR (which is the major stat for a rogue because it controls how much dmg we deal and that's what we are for).  All in all, these guys aren't very good IN MY OPINION. <br><br>You might think other-wise, but this is how I see it.  I know that there are a lot of typos in this so (you know who you are) don't correct me.  It's late and I have had one of the worst days in my life.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>IMHO Half-Elves make great rogues.  They have very well balanced stating stats, night vision, a lower exp pt penalty than other races, and they look cool in just about every armor they can wear (except, maybe, Ry'Gor).<br><br>If you want high STR then you can get buffs with the armor. In fact, any stat can be boosted with armor and jewelry buffs.  Group with a Chanter, Druid or a Shaman and use their stat buffs.<br><br>Rogues, in general, are the damage kings because we dish it out faster than anybody else and not because we hit harder with each strike.  Anything that lowers your attack delay (ie haste) is more valuable to a rogue than anything else. Rogues are food processors.<br><br>Don't forget poison.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>LOL nice post. Man oh man, you shoulda realized how dumb she was as soon as you saw her with 2 kodiak claws. I may be wrong, but stats on those are 7dmg 30dly. Even the cheapest piercing weapons (walrus tooth, dragoon dirk, bloodstained fang) have a much better ratio than that! They don't all have a better damage, but as a rogue, especially one who is abandoning backstab, she should have realized that ratio is much more important than damage. <br>To everyone: An interesting thought I had was what if you considered backstab as a third weapon you wielded, and calculated its damage and delay? (Haha! Rogues get triple wield!) In practice and theory, your backstabs will be about 4 times your regular hits, varying on your level, strength, and whatnot. At level 26 with a STR of 123 and a slime coated harpoon with 10 dmg, I get regular hits of 26 and backstabs of 117. That's a backstab-to-regular damage ratio of exactly 4.5. Now I've heard, but I haven't timed it myself, that you backstab every 8 seconds, and that a normal weapon delay is stated in 10ths of a second. That would make my backstab 'weapon' to have a delay of 80.  However, with 156 DEX I'm guessing that I'm a little faster than the norm. So I'm estimating my backstab weapon to be a 45 dmg 75 dly weapon. That's a ratio of 1.667. Kick-a$$, ain't it? I'm sorry, but I just love math; I've got to go a step further. Calculating the approximate ratio of ALL weapons together: I get a .793 ratio weapon. Or the equivalent of a 61 dmg, 48 dly weapon. Yes, I am a number cruncher. If you hate number-crunching, then ignore this post and don't flame me. It's just evidence of how important backstab is to a rogue. BTW Ishkur, nice statement about rangers. ;)<br>&nbsp;<br>Daviv McD 26th Dwarf Rogue<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13233" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13233</a></td></tr>

She had ruined her faction with her trainers so she couldnt use her practices or get her new skills. So from level 5 until she learned how to use practices at about level 13 she was using a rusty battle axe. Her piercing was down at what 25 or something like that AND she wasn't using backstab. Then she soloed from 1 to 20 where she is now so her backstab still sucks. A rogue is an example of a class where you have to know what you're doing to successfully play one.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well I haven't been able to visit this site in a while (two days is a long time without EQ!) and I'm just clarifying where I stand in all this mud-slinging. You're right Anon, I was pretty much knocking DE's just to get Ishkur to come out of hiding and say something. Truly, all rogues can be great if you know what you're doing. However, I have also had the experience of playing a variety of rogue races. I've had a human, barbarian, dark elf, halfling, and 2 dwarf rogues.  To tell you the honest-to-God truth, I had the most fun with my dwarves, and I refuse to believe it had nothing to do with stats. They were both well-equipped, but not twinked. In fact, one dwarf started with all of my human rogue's equipment (well that might be considered twinking, 'cept the human was only level 14 and he only had a max of 200-300pp worth of stuff). Immediately I saw an improvement from the human to the dwarf. With a bloodstained fang the human was backstabbing for around the 30s at level 13 or 14. As soon as the dwarf dinged level 10, I found a rat in the newbie yard and *BAM!* 52 points of damage! I nearly crapped my pants. Besides that, he was fast as lightning and could take a lot more punishment. Similar stories apply to the DE and halfling rogues (they were worse than my dwarves). The only one I didn't play too much was the barbarian dwarf, but only cuz I made him on a PvP server and I just got frustrated trying to level. Anyway, yes it's true that no rogue race really sucks, it's just the person behind the toon; but I'd rather be behind a toon that's better to start with. Another thing; it's sad, but as you can tell I pretty much only play rogues. I had a pally and a warrior once, but I love rogues the best. And like Tallicus, I don't think I'd get into the hang of being a caster, at least not now. None of that matters, because I love rogues enough to never get sick of 'em; they are kick-ass if you know how to play one. Oh and if any well-prepared necros wanna take me on, give me a tell, as long as "well-prepared" doesn't mean twinked.<br>&nbsp;<br>Daviv McD 26th Dwarf Rogue<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13233" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13233</a></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>If you guys really want to get into spelling/grammar type stuff, ok.  First off, there should be a comma between wrong and though.  I don't think that too and though should be grouped together like that.  It should say, "...is spelled wrong, too." or, "...is spelled wrong, though."  There should also be a comma before Tally in, "don't insult..." and instead of a comma after that same "Tally" there should be a period and a new sentence.  You might wanna just end that sentence after, "i'm trying to say." then go on with, "Of course" as a new sentence with another comma after "course".  I was throwing a weak insult in there, yes.  I was also just stating what I really think is.  I think that people who post on this should just register.  It's a simple, little 1 minute process that is well worth it.

(i mean, i would hate to be flamed :P) the strongest, fastest, and smartest don't always win in RL, and definitely not in this game. that's y i almost think it's funny that everyone thinks so highly about the stats in the first place....but rightfully so if u do go ahead and pick that character. IMO it would make for a really bland game if all did the same.<br><br>now that i have reiterated this point about as much as the NUMBER CRUNCHING OF THE STATS was....i must say i will post no more on the subject. we can't get rid of the pplz that say characters suck because of their inferior stats as much as the world will ever get rid of the terrorists unfortunately, so i will just have to deal with it. as long as the posts may have touched others and i stopped even one person from saying the dreaded words, "Well, i wanted to be this race, but the stats were just not good enuf" then that is enuf for me. later kids, and enjoy the game aight, no matter what race or class you are..........<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>First off, you might want to get another character to buy the sapphire for you. Preferably a paladin or something else that would have high charisma and good faction. Either ask a friend if he could buy it for you (as long as you supply the cash), or use one of your own; make a new one if you have to. This will save you a lot of cash, maybe up to 150pp or so. For the rest of the cash, Frontier Mountains is a good place to go. The giants have plenty of cash (make sure to pickpocket as much as possible, even off other peep's mobs if you can) and great loot. Besides the occaisional runes and words and precious gems and whatever, they have a couple of weapons which are really crappy but sell very nicely to vendors. The best I think is the leg-chopper, which I can sell to a vendor for 38pp at 38 CHA (coincedence?). If I switched items around to buff my CHA up to 60, or just had a friend with great CHA and faction to sell it for me, I'd probably get almost 50pp for it. Now that's not much when considering the 600pp price tag of the sapphire, but it helps. Working in FM I can usually make at least 100pp or more a day. Another place I got tons of moolah was Lower Guk. It's risky, but it's a nice place to go for a lower level rogue. First of all you can pick up the mask of deception if anyone's camping the assassin for the SBD, and second of all it seems a lot of people just let the corpses lie there. This is especially true of a high-level person who's only making his way to a high-level spawn. They'll kill all mobs in the way and leave the corpse there for you to loot. The froggies down there have up to 5pp on each of them and there are also a lot of nice items to sell. In the one time I went down there to get the mask, I spent about an hour or so there and made over 75pp, not including the loot I could sell! I can only wonder how much I could make if I spent a whole day looting other people's leftovers...  Well anyway have fun and good luck gettin' cash and the burning rapier!<br>&nbsp;<br>Daviv McD 26th Dwarf Rogue<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13233" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13233</a></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Great post.  REALLY great post.  Problem.  The Gem IS No Drop.  Last I checked it was.  Second off, another way to make money is in Mistmoore.  You gotta go get the Blood Spirits there anyway.  Here's the thin'.  At 65 Charisma it was worth 567pp.  I made this money easy and I didn't really realize how great Mistmoore was.  There are 2 robes.  Nobles's Robe.  It's a common drop.  Doesn't seem like much, but it's 500pp at least in Xev server it is.  And the Advisor's Robe is about 200 to 300pp.  I got the robes just off the bodies on the floor and most High Lvl people don't loot the items.  Made 800pp off the Robes.  Was able to pay for the Cask, 2 skins, and the gem and still have a bit of change to spare.  Whatever works for ya, but check Mistmoore out.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Just a little comment from an outside opinion on this big debate goin' on:<br>The point of EverQuest is to have fun; I'm not saying that debating about it is bad, but try to put a little more time into playing the game and relax a little. Also, if you think role-playing is the biggest factor in EverQuest, you're in for a shock (of blades). I don't know about you, but I don't have much fun role-playing a sucky character. If you think numbers-crunching is the biggest factor in EQ, better buff that magic resist up, cuz here comes that shock again. Once again, the most important factor is having fun. And if you have fun debating, that's fine, just keep your posts clean.

LOL...if everyone thought that way we would see all BARBIE rogues...OGRE warriors, etc. there is a reason Verant put all these races in this game with the selection of classes. if u went even farther, u could extend it to the CLASSES instead of the races playing the classes. and IMO i think it is FUN to play a "sucky" character...as u so eloquently put it.<br><br>also...i never said role-playing was the biggest factor in playing the game. however if someone chooses a character cuz they always wanted to be that race and class regardless of stats, and those stats are inferior, then he shouldn't have to sit there and listen to how his character sux. and i honestly believe the person behind the toon plays the most important role in deciding if the character sux or not. im sure there are many many stat inferior rogues that can beat their "superior" brothers. <br><br>IMO i consider this all more of a challenge and makes it even FUNNER to play my DE rogue. i think it's funny that a BARBIE rogue already thinks he has the heads-up on me just because his stats are better, just like those cocky NECROS think they have the one-up cuz im JUST A ROGUE. so to u, whatever ur name is, i say that im having GREAT FUN! <br><br>unfortunately the FLAMES are back for this one post, cuz the person once again insulted the "inferior" rogues. easily not an "excellent" post Tally, even i thought u would see he/she was insulting my kind. i do agree with the having fun aspect of the post however, as i have said that over and over. <br><br>i guess i have to basically let everyone know exactly what i want them to eliminate from their posts. AVOID SAYING ONE RACE SUX CUZ OF IT'S STATS! OR EVEN BETTER JUST AVOID SAYING ONE RACE SUX PERIOD. cuz the person behind the toon really decides if the toon sux or not.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Actually, most of the time, you want your highest damage weapon in primary and your lowest delay in secondary. The reason is two-fold:<br>1) Obviously, you will get higher backstabs with a higher damage weapon. Rogues have a lot of advantages, but backstab is definitely their best.<br>2) Faster delay in secondary means more chances to attack. You won't always attack with your offhand, and it only checks for a success after the delay. Therefore it's best to have it check more often, with a faster delay weapon.<br>There are exceptions to these rules, one being that your harpoon is primary only. Another is if you have some crappy weapon that's like 10dmg, 50dly, and another sweet one that's 7dmg, 15dly. In that case, I'd suggest throwing the crappy one away altogether and get a better one =P.<br><br>Daviv McD &lt;Fearless Empire&gt;<br>26th Dwarf Rogue<br>Xegony<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

U know what i just got outta reading the first page of this forum??? not jack @#%^. any moron with half a brain can see that the dark elves starting stats suck compared to those of the others. i have some advice to u guys crunching those numbers so hard (snickers), take a Calculus class are sumptin, christ!<br><br>hey...i have sumptin special for u  too Tallicus. y pick a rogue in the first place, cuz it's inferior to a Necromancer. like u say about Dwarves and Barbs...so much better than Dark Elves, well Necros better than Rogues. so goto that forum and start crunching the numbers over there plz. god i can't believe u actually sit at ur comp and do that @#%^. it baffles me...someone wants to play the game as a character he chooses and u sit there and point out all thats wrong.<br><br>like i said, anyone that is older than 5 yrs old can see who has better STARTING STATS, so stop arguing about a number here and a number there. what about the person, or in ur case, MORON playing the toon??? do u think that could influence the outcome of the battle a lil? and if we're talking PvP here, those numbers almost are moot. the roll of the dice...or computer code for this game is also gonna affect the outcome of the battle as much as those differences in numbers will. heh and another thing...what if u start ur NEW rogue off uber-twinked (wink wink)...throws those stats right out the window. the ultra-vision is also a great thing too...TRUST ME!<br><br>IN THE END all that really matters is picking sumptin that fits right with u...pplz that are actually swayed another way cuz of these posts bout DE's sucking never really had "true" roleplaying spirit anyhow. argue if u'd like, but taking the BEST STATS and not who u think u would fit or want to be is NOT.....i repeat is NOT roleplaying. and that's fine. if that's how u like it. but PLZ stop posting these numbers, we can do the math ourselves and if i needed u, Tallicus, to tell me over and over in a post that DE's STARTING STATS sucked, i should go back to 2nd grade.....<br><br>if all u really care about is the STARTING STATS on every class out there we would only see the same races over and over...i like a lil mixture to spice things up. i picked my DE rogue, not because of his STARTING STATS obviously, but because that's what i wanted to roleplay as...and it's damn fun. <br><br>the PERSON BEHIND the toon is where it's REALLY at neways...i thought ya'll knew. so i guess Tallicus needed the biggest headstart he could get. ouch.......<br><br>sorry...but i have to mention one more thing. i hate to pick on u even more Tallicus, but u seem to me some little punk kid that sits at his comp and watches this forum 24/7 (will know by his response time eh?) and types sumptin in thinking he's all clever. o! i can't forget u crunch all those rogue stat number so well too! wow!! neways..back to what i was getting at, STOP asking pplz to rate u!!! that is extremelly lame. some of ur posts are decent but when u throw in a PLZ RATE ME! line i just LMAO and wanna puke at the same time. take this advice and the above down like a bad pill u HAVE TO SWALLOW and u'll be aight. if not.......<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

First off, I HATE typing the same $&!% over and over myself, but whenever I look at this board, someone has a question about "who's the best rogue to start with?" or "I'm having second thoughts about...".  I just point out what I have pointed out to many times already.  If you wanna RP, have tons of fun and you'll wish you picked a different game.  This is the worst game on earth to RP in.  I started this game with low expectations because it said "online RPG" all over it.  I got into it and found out that you COULD try to RP, but the other aspects of it were really what makes the game.  About the necro vs. rogue thing, HA!  I think casters are... I guess to hard to play.  I used to have a few but got bored with them and late at night when it's hard to keep your eyes open it's impossible to keep up with spells/pets and crap.  The whole night vision thing, they just recently gave barbies, humans, and erudites better natural night vision.  Besides, how hard is it to find a magic item or a serpent sight item?  Not hard at all.  I could keep going, but my eyes hurt and I can't think straight right now (... or ever, really).  Oh yeah, this ones for you, Anonymous (it's not hard to register, you know).

	   <tr><td colspan=2>On the real, I gotta agree with the man.  Thought he hit ya a bit too hard Tallicus, but he's right.  I can see the numbers which is why you work with what you got.  Think about it, Barbarbian's have GREAT Str but not so great Dex.  Does that mean they suck?  No.  Like I said before, my Dark Elf Rogue is like Doug Flutie. Doubted, surrounded by lots of bigger and badder mobs but always finds a way to win. A tactician.<br><br>On the real this is my first char and also I was gonna pick a Dwarf.  But the beard turned me off and besides, my RL girlfriend at the time wanted me to pick an evil char for the guild.  So, I chose a Dark Elf Rogue.  And to tell you the truth, I hold my own.  I've messed up Enchanters and Warriors in duels and I just keep gettin' better with age.  'sides, I'm a shady person. I pick pocket from people's mobs when they piss me off by insultin' and stuff, I talk a lot of smack, I hide a lot and I'm sinister and full of mischeif.  All of those spell Rogue.<br><br>By you pointin' out stats repeatedly, you're sayin' that ev'ryone that has a Wood Elf, Halflin', Half-Elf, Dark Elf, Gnome, and Human Rogue sucks.  We all have our strengths and weaknesses.  But it's how we work with those strengths and weaknesses that makes us deadly Rogues.  I respect all Rogues, e'en the Halflin's although I hate them RP wise.  If you like ev'rythin' goin' in your favor without any repercussions, that's you.  But don't knock me or ev'ryone else because of it.<br><br>Hell, e'en Daviv don't get on that point.  His argument is that Dwarves make great Rogues because they are endowed with Str and Dex.  Great argument.  He explained it all.  You just kept statin' the obvious.  After a while I ignored ya and when I saw you tryin' to lower my rate, I laughed cuz I really don't care.  If someone actually understood what I meant, that's all the ratin' I need.  If it matters that much to ya, I'll actually take the time and rate ya, cuz I usually don't rate anyone but hey, that's y'all biz.  Besides, we Rogues, we supposed to be helpin' each other out.<br><br>And by the way bro, I think a Rogue can take a Necro, although it would take a lot of effort and cunnin'.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ishkur D`Macbain<br>Teir'Dal Dobluth<br><br>"So what if I stabbed him in the back.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I'm not going to flame ya.  I really think you have some great opinions and flames suck.  I will say that you need to pick a point and stay on it.  One post you'll say that DEs are great stat wise and that you can take down warriors and you'll just continually say that your char is a good damage dealer compared to anyone.  The next post you'll say that your a DE just for RP.  I am not dissing all other rogue races, I'm just saying that if you want the best stat rogue, go for barbie (and maybe dwarf... yeah, Daviv has some good points).  As for me pointing out the obvious, srry.  It started out as me telling a newbie (to the rogue, anyway) that barbies are best stat wise IMO.  Then Daviv and you joined in ect.  Ok, stopping because nature is screaming at me.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Completely agree on the Rogue being able to take a Necro out Ishkur...but that's if the Necro is not well-prepared and the Rogue uses all of his advantages. However, let's not kid ourselves and think we can take a well prepared Necro. Just slip outta sight and live to fight him another day....<br><br>So with that said, I was stating Necros CAN be more BADASS than a Rogue...which is why I thought Tallicus should goto that forum. With as much as he is obsessed with the numbers...u figure he would want to be the ALL POWERFUL. And it's hard to argue that Necros aren't.<br><br>Neways, I was just using that as an example to show Tallicus how ignorant he sounds pointing out the obvious. And y he should understand that some pplz don't play a character cuz it's the BEST. I hope that most pplz play their character cuz that's what they wanted to be, and not back down because the stats may be inferior. i HATE when i hear pplz say "Yah, I wanted to be a woodelf rogue, but the BARBIES STATS were just so much BETTER!!" Those are the pplz that have no RP spirit...which once again I say is FINE. but don't come on a board and argue over 3 @#%^ING NUMBERS y one is better or not. three NUMBER DIFFERENCE...get a life u two. (u know who i'm talking about) Take the challenge of developing and playing ur rogue, no matter what the stats. cuz at the end of the day those numbers don't mean @#%^ if u can't play him. <br><br>ok...no more posts for me i think i have it all off of my chest now. REMEMBER...it's how u play ur rogue, or any character for that matter, that counts the most, NOT the stats!<br><br>btw Ishkur...i like the quote, very nice.<br>althout Tallicus's quote DOES FIT him very nicely.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
