	   <tr><td colspan=2>Throughout my 15 months of playing Everquest, I have noticed that Rangers have become less and less welcome in groups. I have heard many Rangers complain of this, and I have wondered why? Recently, I came to the realization that (in general) people playing Rangers are the reason why they are not welcome, and not the class in itself. Big statement? Yes, but here are my experiences with grouping with Rangers.<br><br>Every Ranger I have grouped with, with one exception, has had some or all of the following shortcomings:<br><br>1) Spells - Rangers rarely cast anything other than Snare. I know that a Ranger's healing spells are not great, but they're better than nothing. My main character is a Paladin and I ALWAYS heal in between battles. This allows the main healer to save their mana for battles. HEAL BETWEEN BATTLES!! AND DON'T JUST HEAL YOURSELF!<br><br>2) Loot - Most Rangers are used to soloing. Later in levels (and particularly with the new group friendly changes), grouping is a must. SPLIT UP THE LOOT!!! I've yet to meet a Ranger (excepting that one mentioned above) who isn't loot crazy. At higher levels, it is standard practice to have Autosplit on. Sure it spreads that useless copper around, but that copper will build up anyways and can be easily destroyed. Having Autosplit on allows the puller to pull at a constant rate without stopping to loot. If you ever wonder why people don't want to group with you a second time, think about the last time you grouped with them. If you were looting lots, that's probably why. Very few people will chastise you in the game about over looting, you just won't be welcome back in the group.<br><br>3) Taunting - I know that Rangers are a "Natural" taunt, but I've seen too many Rangers who keep using their Taunt Skill despite the fact that there are Warriors or Paladins in the group. Warriors and Paladins have better HP, AC, and defensive abilities. DO NOT TAUNT IF GROUPED WITH THEM, unless they are getting too hurt themselves. Rangers are offensive weapons, but they can not take the hits like a Warrior or Paladin.<br><br>4) Meditate - Believe it or not, I have met a few Rangers who's Meditate skill was under 100 at level 30!! Meditate should be the FIRST skill to max out when you level! If you're not Meditating, you're obviously not using your spells for the full benefit of the group. If you're not the puller, sit your hiney down after healing/buffing the group and Meditate!<br><br>I do not want to make it sound as if Rangers are money-hungry and self-centered and I realize that this is going to irritate many Rangers out there who already follow these guidelines, but I am speaking from my own experiences with Rangers. The Ranger is probably the MOST difficult class to play properly, but it can be an extremely beneficial asset to a group. I do hope that this helps new and old Rangers to become more "group-friendly."<br><br>Good journeys to all.<br>&nbsp;<br>________<br><br>I've travelled this world and have seen many wondrous things.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I would add the following advice, from significant experience (level 33 Ranger).&nbsp;&nbsp;As a ranger, go for the fastest weapons you can find. Leave the big strike 2hs weapons to the warrior or paladin; look up the logs and you will find out that you do as much or most often more damage than any member of the group, because you hit fast and often with your dual wield and double attack skills.  A well armed and skilled ranger will consistantly outdamage any member of a group except a rogue with a good backstab, but he can usually count of taking more damage than any other member because of this and the limits in armor that the ranger is bound by.  Get assistance from friends, guild members or anyone else you can and get your Ivy tunic and bracers early, both are possible with good help well before level 30 and they make a significant difference. Get your short sword of Morin as early as you can; again with the help of friends if needed. The 6 dam 22 delay will make for excellent damage, much more than an 8 or 9 damage weapon at 30 or more, because of the frequency of attacks and the corresponding frequency of successful dual welds or double attacks. Max every spellcasting skill you have and keep them maxed; the same goes for sense heading, bind wound, meditate and archery. Use track every time it comes up to keep it maxed. Even in dungeons, track will tell you what has spawned in the next room or around the next corner, and your group will do much better for knowing it. Cast feet like cat on all the tanks in your group, and the casters. Druids do not get that spell, and extra agility means all of your group take fewer hits. If you take a lot of damage you can step bak 4 or 5 steps and do 21 points of damage every 4 seconds with the trueshot bow, 44 on a critical hit, and cast your ignite spell between shots for 37.  Also, while you should not use your taunt skill while fighting as secondary tank to a warrior or paladin, do build the skill up when you are soloing or if you have to be primary tank for a small group or duo. This will allow you to very easily peel the mob that attacks the cleric or casters, or pull a mob off a weakened tank, as the combination of a good taunt and fast damage will bring you up to the top of the hate list pronto.  Just be carefull to control how much you aggro the mob yourself, or the warrior and paladin will have to step over your corpse to finish it. You are a damage dealer, not a meatshield, and you will naver take the hits that a warrior or paladin can, but you will more than do your share of damage in any melee, and your spells will help the group even when you must step back or follow behind as you snare a fleeing mob so the tanks can get it. <br> Playing a ranger means learning the strengths and weakness of the class more so than any other class I am familiar with. Combine your skills, plan your tactics, inform your group of your abilities and you will not only be welcome in groups, but you will be more amd more often looked to as a leader in them.<br><br>Akelan Farseeker - ranger of the 33rd hunt.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Rangers do have a very important role in EQ.<br><br>My posting was not meant as Ranger-bashing, but was meant to aid people in playing their Rangers better. Rangers are offensive weapons, that, when used correctly, can have devastating effect on mobs. Their weakness is their lack of defensive ability and it is this weakness that shines through at higher levels. The Ranger takes a great deal of strategy and finesse to play, much more so than most other classes in EQ.<br>&nbsp;<br>________<br><br>I've travelled this world and have seen many wondrous things.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I am playing a 18 level Ranger right now & some of the above comments are valid. However, I don't think the above issues are the problem. I think that the assumption that Rangers are more than they are is part of it.<br><br>Example, I grouped with a level 15 Druid in EK the other day. I thought we were going to camp the bridge & pull towards zone. Good xp in crag spiders & griffawns. But this guy was charming critters towards the ramp & expecting me to kill things that were conning red to me. After we died he got very agitated ( actually verbally abusive /ignore is a wonderful thing ) and told me Rangers were worthless cause our hitpoints are low, lousy armor, ad nauseum. I've heard this comment before - That Ranger skills are by nature mediocre & therefore.....<br><br>First, When I group I try to find a well rounded group. I know this isn't always possible, but you can try. The best groups for me have been with 1 pure caster, 1-3 Rangers, a druid or shaman, a monk & a bard. We ruled the High Keep orc camp one late night and zoned only once and suffered only 1 death in the several hours we played. The bard pulled ( amazing puller too I might add ), the caster sat on the sidelines and cast DD spells, the 2 Rangers & monk pummelled the little orcs & the shaman watched our health. <br><br>Second, a Ranger needs to watch the type of spells cast. When I am soloing I use the grasping roots spells to trap my prey, shoot off a couple arrows then cast an invoke lightening or burst of flame, before I physically attack. Obvioiusly that doesn't work in a group. Doesn't always work solo. I try to see what kind of entrapment being used. If on of the others has a good entrapment thing going I try to hit the prey with a good DD spell & then enter the fray - kicking & hitting as well as I can.Sometimes I am casting the snare or grasp roots so I stand back cast the spell(s) & then start fighting. This has been sucessful. <br><br>3rd, Use your bow. You don't need to leave your group to pull many times - especially in open areas. You don't waste mana on snare spells & you aren't running back & forth. Besides you want to improve on your fletching skills -- RIGHT? I have used my bow in HK to pull gnolls. I sit on a ledge looking down on the path & take a shot or two from above. Gives you a nice time delay to prepare.<br><br>Fourth, Communicate. I find many Rangers to be a silent sort. Chat & let your group know what you are doing.<br><br>Next remember to meditate. I am a level 18 with a meditate level in the mid-90s. I max it out at every level. Let your group know that you are medding. There is nothing more annoying than someone who fights a good fight & then sits down, doesn't say a word & then doesn't move until the next POP. It doesn't take long to say "medding".<br><br>Next when looting - leave your autosplit on and be choosy with your loot. If your Ranger is like mine their weight max is pretty low. Take as many of the rune stones, parchments etc that your can take. They sell for more than weapons - most of the time - and weigh next to nothing. If the loot is mostly weapons ask for a strength buff & deal. I've carried 3 dozen swords off the gnoll ledge working with a weigh ratio or 189/90. You can;t run, but fighting isn't usually a problem when overloaded. Just make sure you know where the closest sale point is. <br><br>7th is the issue of taunting - I have be groused at for not using it more. Usually by Warriors & Monks. They can take the hits, but when they see you health bar staying at 60-80 % they get a bit testy. Take the hits, if you have a healer in the group, they'll fix you. Learn to use bandages so you don't use your mana on healing. Use your bandages on your party. I have fought in parties where I couldn't get hit if I wanted too unless everyone was killed & I was left alone That does not make you popular. Throw a couple practice points into your taunt at an early level & use it even when you don't have too. I will even taunt in solo situations. If you aren't sure how your party wants you to taunt ASK!!<br><br>Next is the healing issue. Most characters assume Rangers have more mana than we do & that we can cast a snare spell, use a couple DD spells in batle & still be able to heal ourselves and most of the party. I have educated several people on this issue. Just because we have alot doesn't mean we can use it all in 1 fell swoop. I carry 2 stacks of bandages and hope to have a druid or shaman for healing. Or a bard. I have made it plain to a couple of groups that I can cast during the battle or heal afterwards, but rarely both to their expectations. READ THE MANUAL - Rangers are mana challenged as well as srength challenged. Many folk only read the stats on their own character. We need to be the great educators of Norrath ( heheh ) and when we get jumped about this or that OR get told we aren't wanted in a group because "I played with aRanger once - who refused to ( fill in the blank )." Explain that you have about 1/2 the mana of a druid and ( fill in the blank ). You'd be surprised at the result.<br><br>Rangers are an asset to groups in many ways. But the problem isn't always what we do or don't do, but the perceptions of what we can or can't do. Play to your strengthes and do make excuses for the rest. I love my Ranger more than any other character. I have had a few bad group experiences, but most have been great. <br><br>May Tunare light your footfalls, shield your sword arm and guide your arrow to it's mark!!!<br><br>Athynna<br>(Terris-Thule)<br>Lastly, watch your weapons. I have not quested much so I am running some average weapons ( right now a fine steel rapier & a polished granite tomahawk ) but I look for shortest possible delay time & weight. I set my hotkeys to battle ( kick, taunt, battlecry- used once per battle, invoke lightening & burst of flame ) and fight. Kick is a weapon. Use it as much as possible. I set the other side to have track available at all times. And once in battle I pan my view once to check for any others coming to help their buddies. Gnolls like to join in. There is nothing more annoying that having 2 soothsayers and a shaman nearly dead - you need a break and BAM 2 brawlers show up unannounced from behind. So be aware. Watch for more attendees & watch your party. Heal/bandage if & when you can.<br><br>Lastly, learn to be a team player. We Rangers are usually a solitary bunch. Many of us level slowly because we solo alot. I was in a slump at level 17 and was at 17 for nearly 5 weeks. It's been a week ( I only play an hour or so a day & weekends - I have teenagers that fight for phone time ) of grouping in High Keep & I am nearly at 19. I like to solo, I like to walk the zones, I like to group for an hour or so and then move on. But I rarely have trouble finding a group and have several folk that will now ask me to join there groups. Make friends. I have a few folk that we chat across zones & when we meet up we group. If you pass across someone again & again send them a tell and keep contact. Though some characters come & go there are many that stay for the long haul. Make that contact. I personally attract the little people ( I think the little men just like being with long legged Wood elves myself, but that's just an opinion ) so I keep track of them & keep a few on my friends list. USE THAT LIST!! I run the list when I log on to see who's around. If they are in my zone I suggest a group. Usually works. Rangers are solitary but not unfriendly.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Wow...you can be quite wrong...<br><br>Rangers for one are the most useful in a group as a puller. You need to perfect those skills especially, and if you do so, you'll be wanted in their group from then forward. You can easily track monsters that the group may want to face (which essentially turns you into a pulling machine...just bringing them in one after another). However, this also means that you should not be the one looting. Ask your group to have autosplit on, and right after the kill (unless your casters need to med, or your tanks need to heal up), you should be on your way pulling the next creature. Once the ranger receives the Harmony spell, he easily becomes the best puller (tracking, arrows, harmony to lower aggro radius) in the game. Furthermore, once you receive SoW at level 39, groups would simply love you.<br><br>And to clear up a few things:<br><br>1) Rangers are decent tanks. Just cause they are only mediocre warriors and do not have as high hp or AC, this does not mean they cannot take the damage. On the contrary, rangers tend to have one of the highest agilites of the melee classes making them one of the hardest to hit as well. This is why a ranger makes a decent tank. A well-played ranger who develops his skill in dodging and raises his agility through items and spells (Feet Like Cat) can be a very effective tank.<br><br>2) Like I said, if you are playing the ranger correctly in a group, and constantly pulling monster after monster...you should not be the one looting. I, for one, rarely ever loot, unless there is an item that I need to retrieve from a monster.<br><br>3) Don't be mistaken why you suddenly become the target against monsters. This is only partly due to your Taunt skill. Little spells like Burst of Flame and Snare quickly brings the monster to attack on you...while the Warrior and the Paladin do not have a spell that will turn the monsters toward them. This is why some mobs tend to bash on the ranger a bit. However, a smart ranger also backs out of melee when he has two bubbles of health, so the monster turns toward the next closest tank (the warrior). This allows time for the ranger to heal up a bit, or cast a few damaging spells (or shoot off some arrows, while the other tanks take some hits). Remember, rangers are useful cause not only are they limited to close range melee fighting, but are just as effective on the outside. Keep this in mind if you need the monster to target a different tank. Of course, if you're down to only one bubble of health, the mob usually tends to bash on you until you see the Loading sign =P.<br><br>3)The person above me stated that he was encumbered with a 187/90 or so. You do not want this. This affects both your stamina and directly lowers your agility. (Stamina bar which is basically your agility). So, if you need to run away, you'll become fatigued much quicker. Furthermore, with a low agility, the monster not only hits you more, but will do more damage with each hit. The mob has a less chance of missing if your agility lowers. Keep this in mind. And soon, once you improve from your standard banded, you will soon get your hands on much lighter armor. I currently have a weight of 62/104.<br><br>4) Finally, this would be an ideal party (more for the higher levels):<br><br>1 Ranger - to pull (not too effective in raids or in dungeons, which is why they aren't as requested in some "elite" guilds)<br>2 Warriors or 1 Warrior/1 Paladin - 2 basic tanks<br>2 Clerics - to heal<br>1 Enchanter - to mesmerize and cast clarity on the clerics.<br><br>That would be my ideal party. And just think. Warriors would constantly be healed. Casters will constantly have their mana refreshed. And if the ranger performs well, he'll be pulling monsters constantly, one after another. Downtime = barely any.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>All of this stuff is really good, the main point is rangers don't have obviously powerful stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;What we do have are flexible abilities which are only as useful as you can make them.  I seem to end up playing the tank more often than not, and I have learned one very important lesson from this, root rocks!  Sure warriors and pally's can taunt and take the dmg, but what happens when that orc would rather beat on your caster instead of the tank?  Root him, inform the group that he is rooted and let the caster back off.  That gives the group anywhere from 4-10 secs to deal with the problem, which in a good group is more than enough time.  I was in highpass the other evening and for quite some time was the primary healer and secondary tank for the group.  We spent some four hours where no one was ever above half hitpoints or mana, I was never able to buff anyone (all mana was going for heals and roots), but nobody died and we were not driven like sheep to the zone, ever.  You can be a great group player as a ranger if you use your skills the max, educate your party on what you can and cannot do, and keep them informed of what you are doing.  You can't tank like a war, pally, or even sk, but you can use taunt to spread out the dmg so your prim tanks aren't totally wiped out and you can use your weak ass heals to keep the main healers from wasting mana between battles when they should be medding.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have to second something mentioned in this post... Tell your party what youre capable of doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Heres what I learned in HighPass, fighting from level 15-19.  Plan your attacks with your group, keeping in mind that each group is different, and requires different tactics.  Rangers can fit into any group, as we do have a wide variety of skills.  Figure these skills out, and use them accordingly.  Also, know what other classes are capable of, and when planning your tactics out, think of these things.  Rogue in the group?  Let them know that youll try and fight opposite them, giving them a better chance to backstab.  Warrior in the group?  Offer to taunt-pong with them, and to /assist them at their request.  <br><br>Taunting:  If youre the main tank, taunt.  If youre secondary, taunt only when the main tank is low, or if a MOB is on a caster.<br><br>Casting:  You have spells, so use em.  Are they weak?  Yes.  Do 10 Burst of Flame casts add up?  Yes.  If a MOB is not on me, I attack, kick, and cast, dropping to about 1/3 total mana before saving it for emergency casting.  Snare and root effectively, too (someone mentioned rooting a MOB thats aggro'd on a caster... perfect).  Also, keep in mind that Lightning spells are AOE, so if you have 3 orcs bunched up on your group, its going to damage all of them.  Sure, we're not "nuking" things for 500+ points, but you'll find the DD spells add up over the course of a battle.  Also, be ready to heal and snare/root at a moments notice.  Save your group once with root, and they'll remember.  One final thing on casting, remember that your group has meditating downtime... use it.  My med was maxed as soon as I hit level 14, and its been that way since.  <br><br>Weapon Choices:  Max atleast two melee disciplines out.  I made this mistake, and had to backtrack to practise 2H slashing at level 16.  It took time, and no one likes seeing you hit for 1 point of damage consistently.  Also, use your weapons effectively... At level 19 for duel wielding, I used a Short Sword of Morin and a Polished Granite Tomahawk... When the PGT proc'd, I taunted no matter what, because I knew I had a buffer of "no damage taken" time.  Groups appreciate that kind of 'heads up' play.<br><br>Hotkeys:  Program them for spells, taunt, and in-battle communications.  I programmed one for "&lt;grouptalk&gt; incoming &lt;target&gt;", so when I track-pull, I announce what Ive got coming in.  I programmed one that lets the tank know Im assisting them with whatever the target is ("&lt;grouptalk&gt; assisting you with &lt;target&gt;").  <br><br>Attitude:  Rangers get a bad rap, and I dont agree with it.  That being said, having a bad attitude, or not playing to your full potential as a Ranger, isnt going to help you get into groups later.  I think Rangers alot of fun to play, and to play with, when you use the wide variety of skills you have.  <br><br>Good luck!!<br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I whole-heartedly agree that every group is different and requires different tactics.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a Ranger truly uses their skills wisely, they can fill MANY gaps.<br>   Need a healer?  &lt;Invite&gt; me.<br>   Need a tank?  &lt;Invite&gt; me.<br>   Need a good puller who can find the *best* spawns?  &lt;Invite&gt; me.<br><br>One note on taunt, I disagree with the original poster.  There are 3 situations where taunt can be the key to being welcomed back into groups:<br>1&gt; If you ARE the main tank<br>2&gt; If the main tanks are incapable of keeping the MOBs off casters (happens a lot - there are a lot of warriors out there that don't have &lt;taunt&gt; hot-keyed because "I wanted to use that button for ... skill instead").<br>3&gt; You are grouped with rogues.  Rogues love me because I can almost guarantee that I can keep the MOB on me.  "Oh, you backstabbed for 75 points!  Twice?  Cool."  The extra damage I take is minimized by the MOB's quick death.<br><br>I know of 1 wizard, 1 cleric, and 2 rogues that invite me into their groups just because I know how and when to &lt;taunt&gt; (and they don't invite their previous tanks back...wonder why...).<br><br>~~Stonewater<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
