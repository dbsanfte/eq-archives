<blockquote><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>General Information</font></font>
- Before creating a character, look at the information on race, class and
statistics, read the linked guides and check out the fighting strategies
of the various classes to decide what you think you will enjoy playing
the most.&nbsp; Match your character to your personality, (or vice versa).&nbsp;
Keep in mind that all characters play much the same for the first few levels.&nbsp;
Though I haven't gotten that high, there are those who say that you can't
get a true feel for a class before level 15 or 20.&nbsp; I would say it
is at least level 7 to 10 before you start to understand the strengths
and weaknesses of your class.&nbsp; Since it can take 60 or 70 hours to
just get a character to level 8, I would suggest you start out with something
you really feel will be fun to play.&nbsp; I hope this guide can help you
save some of your precious playing time by steering you to the character
which suits you best.</b>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Choosing a Server</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For the most part the choice of a server is not crucial, since it doesn't
really affect lag like in some other games, but different servers will
affect your playing style.&nbsp; There are some factors you should consider.&nbsp;
First is whether you wish to player kill (PK).&nbsp; If you are really
into this, you should probably choose one of the pvp (player versus player)
servers or the race war server. [for a good description of playing on the
race war server, see&nbsp;</b> <b><a href="http://www.cheatsearch.com/eq/library/beginpvp.html" TARGET="_blank">Bere
Ironwood's Guide to Race-war Player vrs. Player</a>]. While you can chose
pvp on any server, probably 99% of the other players will be non pvp and
only pvp players can affect each other with spells such as heals.&nbsp;
The reality is that you can't really be an effective pvp on a non pvp server.&nbsp;
Another factor to consider on choosing a server is the age of the server
and the number of people who play there.&nbsp; The older the server, the
higher the levels will be of most of the players.&nbsp; Also, on the older
servers, many of the low level characters are secondary characters for
players with high level characters, which means they are often twinked
with items not normally available to players at that level.&nbsp; Of course,
these players will also be more familiar with the zones and with how to
properly play the game than many newer players, and there are likely to
be more items floating around for sale than on the newer servers, driving
the prices down somewhat.&nbsp; If you are from Europe, you may want to
consider Solusek Ro, which is kind of the unofficial European server, and
has a large German and French Speaking population on it.&nbsp; Probably
the biggest consideration is server population. Many servers suffer from
some serious over-crowding issues.&nbsp; The game was designed to handle
about 1,500 people at peak, but several servers go into the 2,000 range.&nbsp;
The more people on at a given time, the more competition there is for kills.&nbsp;
If you aren't looking to meet a friend who is already established on a
given server, I would highly suggest that you find a server with a lower
number of players.</b>
<p><a NAME="Race"></a><b><i><font face="Kaufmann Bd BT"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Race
&amp; Class</font></font></font></i></b>
<p><b>Check the race and class descriptions on this site to help decide
which combination you prefer.</b>
<p><a NAME="Statistics"></a><img SRC="iconupdated.gif" height=12 width=60><b><i><font color="#FF0000"><font face="Kaufmann Bd BT"><font size=+2>Stats</font></font><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font></i>
You chose your character's stats when you create it, and have to live with
the decision thereafter.&nbsp; There is no one perfect way to set up an
individual character class.&nbsp; Much of it depends on your playing style,
your preferences and the decision you make as to how you want your character
to make his or her&nbsp; way through the world.&nbsp; Below are the basic
descriptions of how the stats affect the characters.</b>
<blockquote>
<center><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Strength</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>This is probably the most important skill for tanks.&nbsp; Strength
affects your maximum damage cap, the average damage you do, how much stuff
you can carry and how quickly you learn many offensive skills.&nbsp; If
you plan on wearing heavy armor and carrying around a lot of extra equipment,
you will need decent strength.&nbsp; With a high strength you can carry
more loot and armor and go longer before having to run back to town to
sell.&nbsp; If you plan on soloing, you may want to put extra points into
strength, even if you are a magic user.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is definitely important
for a fighter type to have good strength, but you should also consider
some of the other attributes.</b>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Stamina</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>One of the most important stats for all classes.&nbsp; The higher
your stamina, the more hit points you get for each level.&nbsp; Over time,
this can really pay off.&nbsp; It also affects how well you can breathe
underwater.&nbsp; This is more important for the tank classes than magic
users.</b>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Dexterity</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>This determines how hard you hit with your bows, how quickly you
learn weapon and rogue skills, and how often a magic weapon will process
it's skill.&nbsp; This is a good skill to have for fighters, especially
rangers and rogues, and of only limited use for magic users.</b>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Agility</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>This determines how often you get hit or missed by an attack and
how much damage you take when you get hit.&nbsp; It also affects how quickly
you learn defensive skills.&nbsp; Since you will take less damage and have
a better chance of not having your spells disrupted if you have a higher
amount of agility, this is useful for both fighters and magic users.&nbsp;
However, for magic users, its usefulness diminishes as you go up in levels
and spend less time in actual melee.&nbsp; I wouldn't bother with this
stat too much for a magic user who plans on grouping most of the time,
but a solo magic user should probably have a high agility.</b>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Intelligence</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>The most important stat for the basic caster classes.&nbsp; For Wizards,
Magicians, Necromancers and Shadow Knights, the higher your intelligence,
the more mana you get for each level. This is obviously very important
since without mana a magic user is basically worthless.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
higher value of intelligence or wisdom is used to determine how quickly
you will learn most of your skills, which makes having one or the other
high useful for all classes.&nbsp; Many would suggest that a magic user
put all of his points here.&nbsp; Certainly, if you plan on spending most
of your time in a group, intelligence is the most important stat to boost.</b>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Wisdom</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>The same effect as intelligence for the deity-based magic users:&nbsp;
Cleric, Shaman Druid, Paladin and Ranger.&nbsp; The higher your wisdom,
the more mana you get for each level.&nbsp;&nbsp; Very important for the
deity-based magic users, but much less important for everyone else. The
higher value of intelligence or wisdom is used to determine how quickly
you will learn most of your skills, which makes having one or the other
high useful for all classes.</b>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Charisma</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>The biggest effect of charisma is in the amount you will get buying
from and selling to NPC’s.&nbsp; If they like you, they give you a better
deal, which is not to be ignored in the cash starved world of Norrath.&nbsp;
Charisma also affects the saving throw for charm spells, which makes it
very useful for bards and enchanters.</b></blockquote>
<a NAME="Deity"></a><b><i><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Deity</font></font></i></b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The choice of deity affects how NPC’s will view
you.&nbsp; In general good citizens like people who worship good gods,
and vice versa.&nbsp; This factors into the prices you pay at the stores,
the quests you are given, and the willingness of guards to come to your
rescue.&nbsp; When choosing a god, think how it will affect your role playing.&nbsp;
Certain class/deity combinations are killed on sight in some towns.&nbsp;
A rogue who worships the goddess of love will probably face ridicule at
the local thieves guild and have a hard time convincing someone to train
him. On the other hand, a wizard who worships chaos will probably find
few friends in the more civilized cities.&nbsp; This is not an unimportant
choice.</b>
<p><a NAME="Name"></a><b><i><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Name</font></font></i>-
Pick a name that is easy to read, spell and remember. Here's why.&nbsp;
First, especially at lower levels, each member of a particular race looks
a lot alike, except that hovering above everyone's head is their name for
all to see.&nbsp; This is your chance to distinguish yourself.&nbsp; Second,
you meet with people, group together and disband a lot during the game.&nbsp;
Assuming you were a good group member, you want everyone to remember you
so that they will group with you again.&nbsp; It is best to have a memorable
and unique name that will stick in the memory of other players.&nbsp; Finally,
the game requires a lot of personal messages where the person has to type
in your name to talk to you.&nbsp; Oddball spellings are just annoying
when trying to find and talk to someone.&nbsp; Take your time and think
up a good name that fits your character.&nbsp; Your name can never be changed.</b>
<p><b><i><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Background</font></font></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
You can fill in a biography on your character by right clicking on his
picture (or /conning yourself).&nbsp; When others examine you they will
be able to read your biography.&nbsp; This is a good time to start to role
play your character.&nbsp; Think of some basic information that will help
you define your character's personality, and put it in.&nbsp; Is he going
to be Good? Evil? Selfish? Uptight? Stingy? Generous? Helpful?&nbsp; Adding
a personality to your character will really help you get into the game,
and it doesn't have to be your real personality.&nbsp; I would add that
if you plan to play an evil selfish player, be prepared to have difficulty
grouping.&nbsp; The servers are small enough that reputations are earned
and spread among the other players.</b></blockquote>
