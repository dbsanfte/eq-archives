<blockquote>
<center><b>The game is remarkably bug free and bugs are constantly being
corrected.&nbsp; However, listed below are known major bugs to watch out
for, as reported by various visitors to the site.&nbsp; The purpose of
this list is not to catalogue all of the flaws in the game or list the
small annoyances like monster lag.&nbsp; Nor is it to point out potential
exploits.&nbsp; (Those bugs will not be listed)&nbsp; Instead these bugs
are the ones that can really cause you a headache, or even disable your
character, if you don't watch out for them.&nbsp; If you know of any major
bugs that are not on this list, or if you know of a fix that has been made
to a bug that is listed, please e-mail me</b></center>
</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=3 WIDTH="50%">
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<b>Dropping a lore item (and perhaps any other type of item) will sometimes
cause it to disappear forever.&nbsp; Basically, try to avoid dropping anything.&nbsp;
(This may have been fixed)</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>There are several bugs to be aware of while trading:&nbsp; If you are
executing a trade and one of the parties moves, the items in the trade
window will sometimes disappear.&nbsp; Additionally, if the party you are
trading with cancels the trade while you are in the process of moving an
item, the item will sometimeds disappear.&nbsp; And if you are trading
with someone and they die before they complete the trade, you will lose
everything in the trade window.&nbsp; Also, heavy lag can cause everything
in the trade window to disappear.&nbsp; Trade interrupts casting. Don't
try to trade with someone in combat.&nbsp; It will interrupt any spells
they are casting.&nbsp; (BTW, doing this deliberately is a bannable offense)</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Charm seems to have several bugs in it.&nbsp; The worst one is if you
are charmed by an NPC, there is a bug where a random item in your primary
weapon slot may sometimes change into something else. [I am told this has
been fixed, but cannot confirm]. If this happens, keep the item in the
slot and petition a GM.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people just die after being charmed.&nbsp;
And charm sometimes causes your hot buttons to stop functioning until you
log out or zone (this is often caused when you cast a spell right after
being charmed).&nbsp; Basically, be very wary when entering an area where
you can be charmed or just avoid them alltogether.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Fear can also cause many of the problems experienced with charm, such
as the problem with your hot keys malfunctioning.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Several bugs with pets seem to make the pet randomly disappear or go
out of control.&nbsp; Levitation can sometimes cause you to lose control
of your pet.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also places within certain zones which
cause a pet to commit suicide:&nbsp; one is in Innothule in front of the
Guk zone;&nbsp; another is in the mino cave near the wall; Lesser Faydark
is another trouble zone.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Due to lag, you can still be hit by mobs after you think you have zoned.
If you are fighting near a zone make sure you can take at least another
hit or two before running.&nbsp; Also, if you die in the zone itself, you
may reset back to your last save, which can cause you to lose any items
you just acquired.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>The&nbsp; small canoes are buggy. You cannot fight from them but some
monsters can attack you. Do not ride with more than one person in a canoe
at a time or one person might get out of synch with the server and end
up far away from the canoe and unable to move.&nbsp; (If this happens,
the helmsman can simply right click the boat to release control, and the
other people on the boat will 're-synch' with the server and warp to the
correct location.&nbsp; So if you are a passenger, if you notice that you
stop moving, notify the helmsman and they can resynch you.)</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>There is a bug in the zone between Qeynos Hills and Western Karana.&nbsp;
If someone is standing or sitting just at the border in WK, it will cause
people trying to zone the bounce back to QH.&nbsp; Other zones have this
bug too, but this is the worst one.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>If you die too near a wall or a hillside, sometimes your corpse will
be imbedded in the wall so far you can't retrieve it, even with /corpse,
and you will have to petition for a GM to come get it for you.&nbsp; As
an alternative, you can sometimes get free by consenting a bard or necro
you trust to search out and /loot your corpse or to drag your corpse free
with /corpse (their locate spell/song targets the corpse to allow the commands
to function).</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Sometimes when you do a quest that gives an item, if you don't have
your first inventory slot open you won't receive the item.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Always make sure you have an inventory slot open, preferably the first
one.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>In a dungeon with a porticullis such as Permafrost or Paw, you can get
stuck and trapped on top of it if you are under it when it closes.&nbsp;
If that happens you have to gate or call a GM.&nbsp; If you don't have
gate, you can have a high level wizard gate you out or get a high level
cleric to resurrect you, which acts as a gate.&nbsp; Yet another solution
is to /quit and relog in after 8 minutes (long enough for the server to
think you are link dead) and you should be unstuck.&nbsp; I am also told
that the U button will often raise the porticullis.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Sometimes when zoning into or out of Mistmoor, your character can fall
through the world and become trapped. This can result in a character losing
all of his or her equipment, particularly if they camp out in the "out
of bounds" area.&nbsp; There are actually several areas like this, all
next to zone borders.&nbsp; I would avoid swimming near any zone lines
since this seems to be a problem in a number of zones and, to be real safe,
try to avoid going too near the zone border in any place other than where
you supposed to zone.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Sometimes the computer doesn't register that you have left a group.&nbsp;
Various things seem to cause this.&nbsp; If this happens, someone trying
to invite you will get a message that&nbsp; you are in another group and
you will not be given the follow option.&nbsp; To get around this, you&nbsp;
have to log out and re-enter the game.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Sometimes when trying to zone, if you do so at a weird location, you
can be teleported to a different spot within the same zone.&nbsp; Many
used this as a shortcut, but most of those have been fixed now.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Sometimes if&nbsp; a door closes on you, you will get stuck in the door
until someone else comes along and opens up the door.&nbsp; Very inconvienient
in off hours and out of the way places.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Your corpse may not always be where you died.&nbsp; I am told that this
is because whenever you corpse leaves the "zone" (ie, goes out a wall,
and falls into oblivion) the game teleports it to 0,0.&nbsp; There seem
to be bugs like this in several zones.&nbsp; Sometimes when you die in
Blackburrow, your corpse is transported back to the Qeynos Hills Entrance.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Occasionally if you die on top of the temple/pyramid in Cazic-Thule, your
corpse will sometimes disappear and be somehow teleported to the bottom
of the alligator pits.&nbsp; In Solusek's Eye your corpse will sometimes
teleport to the Lavastorm zone point.&nbsp; In the necromancer tunnels
in Ak'anon, you corpse will sometimes be teleported to near the entrance
of Ak'anon from Steamfont.&nbsp; In Lower Guk, your corpse will sometimes
be teleported from the dead side to a landing on the live side zone ramp.&nbsp;
In EK, your corpse may teleport to the base of the ramp leading to Highpass.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>In Befallen, near the staircase before the Level 3 door, is a rock jutting
out from the wall. If players back into it or walk into it they get stuck.&nbsp;
You must either call a GM or log out and back in and hope it unsticks you.&nbsp;
Another solution is to /quit and relog and sometimes you will be unstuck
when you get back on.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>When moving a window (ie. a backpack window), when you click to drop
it, the click can go through to&nbsp; whatever is behind it, (ie. pick
up a ring from your finger inventory slot if you have it open).&nbsp;&nbsp;
You can also click-through when clicking on items in backpack windows.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Levitation is pretty buggy.&nbsp; Monsters in the Game have a difficult
time with the "Z-axis" and seem to&nbsp; ignore it completely.&nbsp; If
you are fighting a monster on one level and the&nbsp; monster or is transported
to another level, the monster can still attack, but you can't. This also
happens if you are levitated above the monster.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>If you type numbers and letters together in the chat window, sometimes
your numbers disappear.&nbsp; Use a space between them to make sure they
appear.&nbsp; This only seems to happen when /filter is on.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>If you enchant a second metal bar before placing the first in an inventory
slot you lose the first metal bar, even though the icon implies they are
stackable (and even though they are stackable once in your inventory).</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Large races such as barbarians often can get stuck in the bank at Ak'Anon.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>You probably realize that enemies can attack through walls and floors,
but you may not realize that they can see through them as well.&nbsp; If
you are KOS somewhere, be careful of walking too close to the shops or
you will get attacked by vengeful shopkeepers through the shop walls.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>If you happen to be inattentive and drop you money/item onto the bankers
NAME (when you have the bank open, the name above your 8 slots) the item/money
will disappear forever.&nbsp; You will not receive any message or trade
window, it just disappears.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Many of the Qeynos sewer exits are truly only exits.&nbsp; You can go
out through them, but cannot reenter.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>If you go linkdead (or otherwise lose your connection) while holding
something, that item may be destroyed when you reconnect.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>There is a bug that causes you to lose all of your extra development
stats.&nbsp;&nbsp; What causes it is unknown, and there doesn't seem to
be a fix, but I thought I would warn people about it's presence.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>In some zone pools (for example Crushbone) it is possible while attempting
to exit the deep pool for you to miss the edge and fall to your death as
if there was no water.&nbsp; The best way to avoid this death is find a
shallow spot and get out (in the CB pool, you can swim to the stream and
get out to the side or in front of the Slaver Cabin).&nbsp; When this happens,
your corpse is often transported to location 0,0 of the zone, so look for
it there.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>There's a slight bug that can freeze EQ, and possibly the whole computer.&nbsp;
They designed EQ to disable the ALT+TAB shortcut keystroke in Windows (which
swaps between programs); this was intended to stop people from using "trainer"
utilities whie in EQ.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they did NOT disable the CTRL+ESC
shortcut (which opens the Start Menu).&nbsp; A couple of times, I went
to punch ESC (to de-target a MOB I just conned) while i was holding CTRL
to sidestep back into hiding.&nbsp; The system reads this as the CTRL+ESC
command, and minimizes EQ to the taskbar while it attempts to open the
Start Menu.&nbsp; However, at this point EQ is still overriding all other
Windows functions and commands, INCLUDING the mouse.&nbsp; This leaves
you with no way to get back into EQ (can't mouse-click the button or ALT+TAB
into it).&nbsp; Only CTRL+ALT+DEL works, which lets me kill EQ, but the
system is still so messed up afterwards that I have to reboot and reconnect
to get back into EQ.&nbsp; Luckily, this key combo doesn't get used very
often in-game, but you should be aware of it since it causes several minutes
of downtime while you restart and reload.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>If you type in /loot at a corpse while meditating, your graphics get
screwy and quickkeys and some function keys no longer work.&nbsp; To get
out you should quit (/q) and restart EQ.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>If you drop an item near a vendor (or perhaps any NPC), they might pick
it up and you won't be able to get it back.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>

<b>There is a bug that sometimes kicks you completely from your guild when
you zone.&nbsp; There's not anything you can do, but it is good to be aware
of it.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Despite the fact that the graphics show barbarians as easily small enough
to enter the Kelethin buildings, they can't do so.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>There is a small cul-de-sac immediately outside the zone to the 3rd
Gate in Neriak, to the right as you face the zone tunnel from Neriak Commons.&nbsp;
If you step inside that cul-de-sac, which is created by a door frame,&nbsp;
you can be stuck there for an undetermined length of time.&nbsp; Your character
can jump and walk in place but cannot exit the cul-de-sac.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Switching between characters repeatedly often locks EQ up entirely.&nbsp;
In one instance, I had to reboot the computer.&nbsp; In another, CTRL-ALT-DEL
got me out of EQ and I was able to restart it that way.&nbsp; It can also
mess up your sound.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Mobs in the Qeynos sewers near Cubert's spawn spot jump into the water
when fleeing and swim down to some unknown spot.&nbsp; Magician pets&nbsp;
who follow them don't return; they suicide, probably after getting stuck
down there somewhere.&nbsp; Note.&nbsp; I have been told that they in fact
run towards the exit and can sometimes be found again at a dead end near
the exit.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>If a character who has a pet goes linkdead, his pet will be affected
by PC area effect spells and will turn and attack the player who cast the
spell.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>If you have ICQ turned on, you should turn it off before you play EQ
because if you get messaged the game crashes and you have to restart, which
can be pretty inconvienient in the middle of a battle.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Sometimes if you are standing in water (especially in Innothule I am
told), you can't hit the MOB.&nbsp; Everything will seem to be working,
but you will get no damage messages.&nbsp; This might be because you are
standing and the mob is swimming.&nbsp; Try to fight on dry land or completely
in the water if possible.</b></li>
