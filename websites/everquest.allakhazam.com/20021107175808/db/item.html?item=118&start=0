	   <tr><td colspan=2>I would say all the rods were fairly easy to acquire except the Lower Guk reanimated hand room.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had never been in Lower Guk before.  If you know how to get there more power to you, but if not try an /ooc.  I /ooc'd &quot;does anyone know where the reanimated hand room is?&quot;, and luckily a group came and picked me up and took me near the room.  They even cleared the room for me.  <br><br>The other place where help is needed is Lake Rath.  What I did was set my bind in Lake Rath, evac to nexus, got a druid to enduring breath me, gated back and got the rod.  <br><br>The rod in Everfrost plains is in the cave.  The entrance is under water.  You get into the water by finding holes in the ice.  It may seem like you need enduring breath but you don't (if you find a hole in the ice close to the ent), because right after you enter the cave you swim upwards getting out of the water.  <br><br>The Quenos aqua ducts one was pretty difficult until I realized that if I went to Crow's Tavern in North Quenos, there is a secret wall to enter into the Rogue Guild.  There will be lots of holes to fall through into pits below, and one of them is to the &quot;shark pit&quot; where you will find one of the rods. <br><br>The last rod which was a little tough to figure out how to aquire was the one in Neriak.  I created a dark elf to scout out the zone, since my wizzy gnome is KOS.  You will need to evac to Nektulos Forest, from the wizzy spire face the wall and head left on it.  Before you enter Invis yourself.  This is the Neriak Foreign Quarter Zone, through this you will find the Neriak Commons Zone.  Luckily, when you enter into Neriak Commons there is a river right in front of you.  Jump in, and swim until you see 4 windows in the water.  In front of those windows lies the rod.<br><br>I hope this helps!!<br><br>31 Wizard of Druzzil Ro  <br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Oct 29 20:41:31 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>My wife waited until level 46 to do this quest with a shammie friend. She had maxxed out on her 2hb with staff of the water walker which came in handy to do this quest. She decided it was time to change not only so she could put more int in the other hand but also so she could max her 1hb before she trys for her epic. And i must say it is nice having both for her she can use both depending on the circumstances. I would suggest any wizards train in both for maximum advantages of using different staffs. There are int advantages with the 1hb but enduring breath and other wonderful needs on alot of 2hb weapons. Never limit yourself to any one practice and have fun if you haven't done the quest yet....that's what this is all about. &lt;beams a smile&gt;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>First, I ported to GFay, then ran to Dagnor's Cauldron. The rod here is at the loc neg 890, neg 740, in front and to the left of the entrance to kedge keep, underwater. The easiest way to get here is to invisible and levitated till you find the coordinates then go down and get it.<br><br>Second, I went into Unrest which is off Dagnor's Cauldron. There is a small waterway on the right hand side of the zone. swim on the right hand side of the water. you will see 2 tunnels. take the smaller one on the right hand side. you have to swim in, swim up, then swim in some more. it's laying there on the bottom. As soon as I had this piece, I gated to West Commons.<br><br>Third, I ran invisible to Neriak, and went in. Unless you are Dark Elf, you have to do this quickly before your invisibility wears off. The rod is in the second zone inside Neriak, Neriak commons. After you run past the priest of discord, you will go through a gate, and onto a bridge. Jump over the left hand side of the bridge, and into the water under the bridge. The rod is on the ground in front of the windows. Then I immediately gated to N. Ro.<br><br>Fourth, I ran to oasis, and got a druid friend to help me. Before I did anything else, I bound myself at the dock area. Now, if you have levitate on, and you get in the water and page up/page down just right you will be able to see clearly underwater. I had my druid friend put on his wolf form, and get close enough to cast a DD spell on the goblins in the top of the tower (the tower is an exact replica of the spec tower) Pulling the deepwater gobs in the top of the tower does not pull the ones on the bottom. Once he had pulled them, he ran like mad for the S. Ro zone. Once the gobs were out of the way, I swam down, grabbed the rod, and gated.<br><br>Fifth, I went to lower guk. If you don't know the way, shout at the entrance to upper Guk, and more than likely someone will be willing to show you the way. Once you get to lower Guk, you need to have someone cast invisibility vs. Undead on you. Hopefully, the hand room will be camped (it usually is) I had to have someone show me how to get there cause I had never been there before. The rod is in the upper part of the room, on the right. If your video settings aren't right, the rod may blend in with the floor, and you will have a hard time seeing it. once you have that rod, gate out to North Karana.<br><br>Sixth, I went to Highhold pass. The rod there is in the water underneath the waterfall by the Tiger's Roar Inn.<br><br>Seventh, to save a little time I ported BACK to North Karana, and ran to lake Rather. Once in Lake Rathe (you will need a potion to enable you to breathe underwater. I found mine in west Freeport at Torlig's Herbs and Medicines. I can't remember which one it was, but you can right click on them to find out) go to the island directly across from the entrance, it has a large tower on it, known as the flame tower or the diving board. Underneath this island are 2 tunnel entrances. In the middle, under the island, is a tower that looks exactly like the spec and DW Gob towers in oasis. The rod is in the top of the tower on the floor. Now, I don't know if I got lucky or what, but only one of the DW Gobs that were there were ready to attack, and it was one of the ones on the bottom of the tower. So I grabbed the rod and gated to Tox forest.<br><br>Eighth, I ran/took the boat to Erud's crossing. Once there, I ran around the island till I could see the mast of a sunken boat. I cast levitate on myself, and did the swim/bob trick again till I got approximately to the coordinates of the rod (neg 1162, pos 2340) and dived for it. apparently, Verant took out the sharks, so there is no problem getting this rod, aside from the zombies on the ship, which were green to me, but still attacked me. Killed them easily. I then got back on the boat, and headed for Quenos.<br><br>Ninth, once I was in Quenos, I went to the Aqueducts. I had to have someone show me the way, because I had only been there once before, and there are things in there that are still red to me at 31. The rod here is in the middle of the shark pit. The shark was green to me at 31 and did not attack me. Once I had that piece, I hightailed it for Everfrost Peaks.<br><br>Tenth, Once in Everfrost, I went to the river. It's a long underwater swim, so once again, you need the underwater potion. First of all, I had to find the one hole in the ice, which is at pos 2420, neg 4060. I stayed on the west hand side of the river, since it forks. Once I was out of the water, and into the caves, I hugged the right hand wall till I found a building. Inside this building are 3 Icebone skeletons, which were green but still attacked. Got rid of them easily, and ran out of the caves, swam back for the hole, and the ran to Sulgar. I'm not sure of his loc, but he stands nearby 2 barbarians, and he is wearing a white robe. I asked him &quot;what is Tarton Wheel&quot; and followed the dialogue from there. Note that if you hail him, he talks about Tarton's Wheel, and this will do nothing. you have to leave off the 's. Once I got the box from him, I put all the pieces of the rod in it, hit combine, and BOOM! I had the staff.<br><br>DO NOT do this part of the quest first since the box is no rent. Once you have the staff, you can keep it, as I did, or you can turn it back into him for the runes needed for the level 49 Wizard spell, Ice Comet.<br><br>If you need the runes for Ice Comet, make sure your research is very high, as you can still fail on combining them in your lexicon, and you don't want to have to do the quest again ::grin:: it was hard enough the first time.<br><br>This whole quest took me about 5 hours of playing time. It's not too hard in retrospect, although it can look daunting at first. Good Luck!<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>guk is the hardest of the rods to get, but here is how I did it, and it worked pretty well. I had a friend start a necro (gets invis vs. undead at lvl 1) and work his way to the swamp. Bind him in grobb and yourself outside guk. I invis'd us and we ran to guk via the underwater passage. He did invis vs. undead to us, and we ran to the hand room. No need for a high lvl character to help you with this one. Have the necro jump in to distract them by taking a hit to die. Jump in right after he starts to distract them (there isn't much time to do this). Grab the rod and jump back to the water. Of course I died, but I had the rod on my corpse. Get back the same way, do a /corpse, and your golden. Check off Ena from your list. <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Dont be fooled like I was , grab a map and look for the hand room(it is in a long maze like area in guk, its not the room with the waterfall..)<br><br>Also.. the rod in the cauldron was the hardest to find.. I spent 2 hours looking for it without enduring breath...  I was releaved to find it at location: negative 890, negative 740 or so.<br><br>Its pretty dark in that area if you dont have a lightsource, grab one if you dont have one on ya..<br><br>Well all said and doen those were the hardest two.. I still managed to die 3 times in lower guk to the live frogs because I was stupid and killed them for fun once... <br><br>Well I am a rogue, so I cant use the staff, but I love my new star of eyes.. it can be used from inventory without being a wizard or a class that can be a wizard. Instant cast, so no annoying cast message, oh its so cool!, Wish the staff could have gone to good use, im probably the only one who has destroyed one.  I plan on helping our guilds wizard get his staff sometime, ill have good live froggie faction by then I hope.. it makes it so much easier..<br><br>Good luck all.<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I started this quest a few weeks ago, I was a yellow into 24. I will put this in order as how i did it but leave the numbers the same for a reference in hope that it helps <br><br><br>(7) [Geza] Highhold Pass in the water near the waterfall closest to the Tiger Inn. There are 2 waterfalls there. The rod is in front of the one closest to the inn; <br><br>This is the first one I did just have sow and invis run in jump in the water at the loc and look in the corner there it is. 1 down 9 to go <br><br>(8) [Heda] Qeynos Aqueducts, in the shark pit; <br><br>Number 2 Just invis and run in. You will need a map I entered thru the hidden entrance in North Quenos. Print a map and follow it to the pit. The orge was up when i got there and i just clicked on the rod and picked it up without getting into the water. <br><br><br>(1) [azia] On the ocean floor in Eruds Crossing past the zombie boat where the zombie sailors hang out. (location - neg 1162, pos 2340); <br><br>Number 3 I would suggest getting enduring breath for this one. For when you swim down you get drift away from the loc you started from. I finally found the rod after several attempts then died 1 second from the surface by drowning. One death and a stupid one at that. (3 hour corpse run because i was looking for my corpse on the floor when it was suspended in the water above me and just out of sight) <br><br>(9) [Izah] Neriak in the water in front of <br>the bar called "the blind fish". The bar has 4 glass windows that are underwater, and the rod spawns right in front of those windows; <br><br>Just gated to the closes gate invised ran north to entrance to zone ran in and jumped. Invis ran out but i just hid in a corner in the water recast and went swimming again. One note the windows are under water, i was looking for them above water. <br><br>(3) [caza] Lake Rath. Underneath the first island you see is an underwater tunnel leading to a stone tower. Its on the top floor of the tower. (You need enduring breath <br>for this one); <br><br>This was easy zone in swim strait out to island. when you see the platform with the avicks on them go to the other side of the island and with invis and enduring breath swim in the tunnel. I have seen post that you need wolf form to do this or other parts of this quest or you will fail. Don't listen to that never used wolf form got the rod with no death here. <br><br>(6) [Fana] Oasis of Marr in the underwater tower next to the above ground tower, on the top floor; <br><br>More swimming and alas another invis too, get enduring breath for this one too after my death getting the 3rd rod i did not take any more chances more than nessessary <br><br>(4) [Dena] Dagnor's cauldron, right outside the entrance to Kedge Keep. If you face with your back to Kedge, it is directly diagagonal left, in a corner - or you can swim straight out and down from Unrest; <br><br>I used levate here and went to the the cords and went down looked for it and there it was. Was going to go get the next one but invis ran out on the way up so i zone back to bb ran to the bank and came back to do the next <br><br><br>(10) [Jaka] Unrest in the water outside the right side of the house near where the the gnome speulunker is. Instead of going into the tunnel that leads to him, you go a little right of that entrance and there's a very short passage where you can find the rod. <br><br>Remember to swim up for this one it is on a ledge that while still under water is not down in the deep part. It is hidden in the corner with skellies swimming around as were other stuff. Nothing agro on me I just went in follow the wall to the right till i hit a building that i could not run behind then went around that building giving every mob a wide berth as i did not have invis to undead but did have regular invis then jumped in the water and swam to the cords then gated out on the ledge. <br><br>Then I took a break and went back to lake of ill omen for a 2 weeks and gained 5 lvls and started the last 2 rods 3 yellows into 29. All the ones above this i did with only food and a summoned light source so if i died I did not need to worry about corpse retrival <br><br><br>(2) [beza] In the underwater cave in the Everfrost plains. It is in the "house" all the way back and right in the cave, where 3 dry bones guard it in the center of the room; <br><br>Get enduring breath as this is a long swim to the cave. I did not use invis here and was not agro by anything in the water. once i was above water i cast invis for the bear and hugged the wall to the right until i found the rod hut. I only got agro by a ice bone skellie in the tunnel to hut once and quickly nuked him. The rod is in the hut and the 3 skellies are now all INSIDE the hut. Seeing that i medded up in a corner behind the hut and then went to the front door and slowly moved in and with each step tryed to pick up the rod. Got the rod without any agro from the 3 skellis inside the hut. back out quick ran to edge and gated out 9 down and 1 to go. <br><br><br>(5) [Ena] Lower Guk in the Reanimated hand room. This one is the only one you need a group for, unless you're brave and kamakazi it. Warning, the floor is the same color as the rod in this room and it makes it very hard to find with the hand and the dar beating on you; <br><br>I waited a day or two until friday after doing rod 9 for this one I even went to ec and then gated back to ef for mammoth hunting. Well when the hunting got bad i started my long journey to Guk at 9:30pm yesterday a friday. I gated to North ro and with sow and invis a ran all the way south to guk. <br><br>Upper guk was easy and took the same path i saw someone recently posted here via the ancient crocs to the undead side. A bit of warning when you zone in to lower via the water this route you will be under water. do not freak out like i did and just swim forward. It not a long swim so you do not need enduring breath. I got to a ledge by the bedroom and someone that was running from the lower side live pulled an undead and died ( i know cause i saw his corpse later when i started swiming again) once he was dead the ghoul came and pounded me to death (2nd death). got a rivive from someone in the bedroom and poof i was back binded myself on the same spot after looting my corpse and waited until the bedroom was under control went to the bedroom got a invis to undead ran down the hall past the ice bones (greater) and jumped down to the lower part (just past the icebone you come to a room go to the left and jump, yes take the damage for me it was 45hp) <br>then head north watch out for the pits stay in the center. i saw a post on another site that said stay out of the center i did and fell into the pit. But all is not lost after deciding not to gate back and seeing no undead down there which was good cause the invis to undead had wore off now i found a ladder and climbed back up. try to continue north and saw an aminated hand cast a spell and knew i was close saw another undead north of me did a loc and relized that the pit had taken me north of the hand room so moved back south and found hand passage bound my self right before the hand room and while the spell was being cast the hand and undead mob was pulled out not good. was able to focus enough to finish the bind and was bound right where i was going to die. At first i thought great i was going to be in a death loop but the puller pulled the 2 mobs out or the hall and when i came back i had an empty hand room ran to room swam up ran around found rod picked it up ran back into water ran to courpse looted and gated out woo woo woo woo <br><br>Forgive a spelling errors. Some notes use invis everywhere have sow and get enduring breath whenever you go into the water the extra time will reduce the stress of finding the rods if you don't have to worry about breathing. I did the first 8 naked the last 2 fully dressed. I never had wolf form and i bound myself on dry land at almost every site after the eurdin crossing death <br><br>My only question now is how do i use the Star of Eyes <br><br><br> <br><br>&nbsp;<br>Burlarr<br>Wizard 56th level<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=163336" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=163336</a></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>OK everyone this is how I completed my Staff of the Wheel quest in little less than 5 hrs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok my first stop was in Erud's crossing where I ported myself to Toxx and then jumped on the boat to Qeynos when I got to erud's Xing I jumped off the boat and swam to the island where I relocated myself and found the boat and lined myself up with the coordinates then i invised myself in case of sharks and swam over boat and straight down till I got to the 2nd coordinate and Bamm... 1 rod down 9 to go so i said well hell I am in the general vicinity of 2 more so I jumped on boat to erudin again and stayed till I got to Qeynos. I went to north qeynos and used secret ent near gates and ran mylself down into the sewers where I locate the shark pit and grabbed the rod out and ran back out...2 down 8 to go. Oh yeah and invis worked on most all these rod retrievals.  So then I ran myself to everfrost where I had a shm cast endure breath on me and I swam to cave underwater.  This one is kinda hard cause you gotta keep your eyes out for the Lich of Miragul he has a pet so shouldn't be too hard to spot just make sure you target every skele you see and be careful cause Ice bone skeles see thru your invis ad will break it.  The rod is located in the very back ina house looking like an erudite shack I just nuked all the skeles went in and grabbed the rod and gated... Boom 3 rods down I put the rods in the bank and went to my next rods.  I then gated myself to Gfay had a shm sow me and I ran to dagnor's cauldron.  When there I located the Unrest zone and ran in. I once again invised ran to the right and stayed there till I saw a pool of water I jumped in and faced south where I saw a tunnel leading underwater and swam to the back where I located the rod grabbed it and ran back outta unrest to dagnor's cauldron. Then I swam straight out and down and Boom located the 5th rod all right....gated myself again and put the other rods in bank. Now I headed to Lake Rathe. I had a druid cast wolf form on me then had shm cst endure breath and I swam to first island I saw and located the tunnel and swam all the way to the tower and rod is sitting on top of tower...boom 6.  Then I gated myself to North Ro where I ran to Oasis and asked another druid to cast wolf form on me and I swam to tower underwater and located the 7th rod.  LOL ok now here is why I was rushing...lol.  ONE HOUR TILL SERVERS COME DOWN FOR PATCH! Great got go faster I thought. So then i gated to WC and ran into kithicor not caring weither it was night or day and luckily had sow so just avoided all spawns and ran into Highkeep where I located the waterfall next to the inn and grabbed and gated myself to Nektulos forest.  I invised myself ran into neriak and thru commons and swam into water and picked up my 9th rod. Woot Well now I had about 45 mins so what do I do?...lol GO FOR IT OF COURSE!  i gated quickly to North Ro again and had sow on so ran thru Oasis South Ro into innothule swamp and into Upper Guk.  I invised myself and ran thru Upper to lower guk dead side and asked quickly for a cleric to cast invis vs undead on me and shouted if anyone ws campin Animated hand Room. LOL TALK ABOUT LUCK they were.  So I ran myself to the hand room and they pulled the spawns outwhere I then grabbed the rod and gated likea girl...LOL WOOT!!! all 10 now what? WELLL 15 MINS TILL SERVERS COME DOWN FIND A SAFE PLACE TO LOG OUT!!!!...lol ha! i wasn't about to let a patch stop me so I was bound in Halas bank I grabbed the rods Ran out into tundra located Sulgar and said "What Tarton Wheel" "I am interested" and "Give me the wheel case" I combined the rods got the staff handed him the case got the star of eyes gated myself put staff in slot and logged out now reaping my rewards with my 10 int 10 hp and 10 mana staff....lol WOOT! i hope this helps ppl out!<br><br>Teleporting Chronotrigger<br>31 Erudite Wizard<br>Prexus<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Key is to make sure the Hand room in Lower Guk is clear before that part of the quest..if not just shout out you need it cleared to do the quest and you'll only have to wait 5 minutes at most.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have just completed the Staff of the Wheel portion of the quest. Invis carries me through all portions of the quest except Lower Guk. In Eruds crossing, I brought a Druid along and used their tracking to determine the safty of the waters. I needed enduring breath for Lake Rathe, and used it for Everfrost, but don't think I needed it. None of the other swims needed it. (My swim is over 100.)<br><br>So, the hard part was Lower Guk. I used the tried and true kamakazi method: Go to lower guk via the ancient crocs entrance. It takes you to the waterfall. Wait till someone is camping the BedRoom. Go for a swim, and enter the bedroom and wiat till the BR crowd has cleared the VAmpire bats. Get an Invis to Undead, and begin the gauntlet. From the watery entrance, keep along the left wall, pass some skellies in an alcove, enter a room with a bridge, and jump. From here you can get to the "safe hallway". Follow the strange hallway to the hand room. Assume the hand and ghouls are there. It does help to find out if someone is camping the hand. If someone is, that just makes it easier. Now, facing the entrance, the rod is on the left half of the room, on the floor. You can see it if you swim up the opposite wall and turn around. Pick a line, it's critical that you know where it is to get out fast enough. When ready, (about peed my robe at this point), swim and go for it. Grab it, get it in inventory and hit the water. This is CRITICAL, get in the water! if you dont make it, getting the corpse back will be MUCH harder. When you die, repeat previous process, except this time, loot your corpse and gate out. The area under the water (no, not underwater, under the water) is safe so far as I could tell. Too far from the hand, and nothing was down there both times I visited.<br><br>Now just to enspire some debate, I dont even carry it most of the time! In the process of getting this item, I get most of the parts of the Weeping Wand, a wizard focus item. Int isn't as good, but it's focus...<br>&nbsp;<br>Ennya Orcsbane<br>1st Elder of The Tears Of Veeshan<br>Proved Slayer, Wurmslayer<br>Wizardess</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well I finally got Staff, started the quest when I was around 28 or so, and now I am 34, and its done.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just got rods when I wanted to work on quest, that is why it took so long.  I can honestly say this is a very challenging quest.  My swimming skill, for the last rod (Everfrost) was around 165, and I barely made it to the underwater cave.  I did not have endure breath for this one, but I did have sow.  I would get endure breath for them all.  Get some nice mage to summon you some water stones. <br><br>The only one that I got attacked on was the last one, in Everfrost.  I did die once doing this quest, getting the one in Unrest, but not because of anything guarding the rod.  I accidently went down the wrong tunnel, and was attacked then.  After recovering my corpse, I went back in and got rod.  Had someone show me the rod second time.<br><br>I wont go into details of how to obtain the rods, because I used two sources that were invaluable.  Allakhazam and Graffe gave me step by step advice and location of rods.  <br><br>Now I will say this, and no one has said this before.  I had a druid tell me when I got the rod in Lake Rathe.  If you are in wolf form the aqua goblins wont attack you.  I did and they did not, they coned indifferent to me - and so red they blinded me (at lvl 34).  :o)  So I would recommend doing that.  I would also recommend getting water stones, for all of them.  I would have to search around a little for some of them, it was nice not to have to worry about running out of breath.<br><br>Some of them are easy;  ok the one in Lower Gux, you ask.  Hehe  Well, I went with a lvl 48 wiz who is a friend of mine, he was doing it for the ice comet runes.  We got a guide to take us to the hand room.  I almost wet my robe I was so scared;  the thought of having to go through that to get my corpse really scared me. We swam up, and guess what no hand.  Yea  My friend grabed the rod, we ran out of room.  Now it was my turn.  Egggggh  Ok, I swam up and jumped in room.  By the way, get invisibility to undead for this one, you have to have it.  No hand, he had not respawned.  I grabed rod, and jumped out of room.  Not looking back.<br><br>My friend said that there is a chance that you might fail in your attempt to combine the rods to get staff.  I can honestly say, if that had happened, I probably would have cried.  Hehe  The thought of going back to Lower Gux - no thanks.<br><br>Well I have talked too long;  good luck, I definatly think the staff is worth it.  Now I can sell my ceremonial dagger, I carry the SoM in my other hand, and have Sarnak Sacrificial Dagger in my range slot.<br><br>Good luck all my fellow Wizzies.<br><br>Philibus Sophisticus <br>34 Wiz of Bertox<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
