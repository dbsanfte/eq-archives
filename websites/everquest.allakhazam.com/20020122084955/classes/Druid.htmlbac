<p><b>This is probably the most popular class in the game.&nbsp; You will
find plenty of druids in your wanderings.&nbsp; This is because it is probably
the best solo class.&nbsp; There are three things that druids do better
than others - travel (camouflage, spirit of wolf, and solo or group teleports),
damage shields (great for long combats), and playing with animals (sense,
charm, buff them, terrorize).&nbsp; The other great thing about a druid
is that, while they are not the master of any one thing, they are the best
class to fill in the gaps that a party has.&nbsp; Need a healer?&nbsp;
Druids are the second best (tied with Shaman) next to Clerics!&nbsp; Need
extra firepower?&nbsp; You got it - not quite as good as a wizard, magician
or necro, but still very good!&nbsp; No Shaman or Enchanter?&nbsp; Druids
have decent buffs as well.&nbsp; Druids also have the tracking skills of
a Ranger.&nbsp; Given time to meditate, they can buff you before combat,
destroy creatures during it, and heal you afterwards.&nbsp; No one else
can do that for just one cut of the experience.&nbsp; Because they have
such a wide variety of skills, Druids are one of the better solo classes
out there.&nbsp; With both SOW and teleports, they are probably the fastest
travelers in the game, letting you cover a lot of ground when you want
to.&nbsp; However, many of their best spells don't work unless they are
outdoors, making them difficult to play in a dungeon, where many of the
best items can be found.&nbsp;&nbsp; Druids are also weaker at each given
area than the equivalent specialty class. This is a good class for a person
who likes to do a little of everything, without being a master of any.&nbsp;
