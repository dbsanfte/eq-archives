	   <tr><td colspan=2>The previous poster is completely wrong. You can create a pet higher than a blue after 16.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that, but I created a pet that coned even to me at 20 or 21 (cant remember which).  But, it is VERY rare.  That was the first pet to con even to me since my early teens.  I dont know if you can ever get one that cons even after the 20's though.  I have noted that since I have been in my 20's, I have produced no green pets, though I dont know if I am just lucky or not.<br>As for the "shovel, torch, mug, broom" the poster mentions, those are what are called focus items.  They do boost your pets hit points, but don't jump out of your seat just yet, as they don't affect your pets until level 34.  <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Yes, it is possible to get level 17 pets at level 16. For some wierd reason they jump back up to being able to con yellow at 16. At 20 you can get white cons, but 95% of the time you will get blues. After level 20 all pets that you summon will be blue or green. The only exception to this is the magician epic pet. However, since it is nearly impossible to get, you will prolly be in your high 50's/level 60 by the time you get it, and then it would con blue.<br><br>One of the previous posters said that the focus items don't work on pets until level 34. That is untrue. They work on all pets under level 49. My first mage was in his 40's before the focus items even came out, so that sort of sucked, but the last magician I made had all of his focus items but the fire one at level 16, and they DO make pets that are under level 34 more powerful.<br><br>Former Addict of Everquest.<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Okay this got bumped back to the 3rd page so I am reposting it: <br><br>First off choose your race. I suggest putting 25 points into intelligence and 5 into charisma. Also, DON'T BE A HUMAN OR DARK ELF IF YOU ARE JUST STARTING THE GAME. Dark elves are evil and will get killed on sight by a lot of other races. Some people say humans level faster than every other race...well guess what..THEY DON'T. Plus humans start with the lowest intelligence and are blind in the night. Also, I wouldn't suggest being an Erudite if you are a newbie. They are nightblind and have THE WORST starting zone in the game. If you are just starting your character I suggest being a Gnome or High Elf. These races are good aligned, have infravision, and start on the continent of Faydwer...which is a MUCH more newbie oriented continent with less dangers. If you have experience with the game, be any race you want. If you don't like gnomes or high elves, at least just be one for a little bit to get used to the game if you are a newbie. Also, on a note about gnomes... Gnomes start with less than 75 wisdom. I suggest that you get a few items that get your wis to 75 becuase casters with less than 75 wis fizzle a little more than normal. Not a biggie, but remember that. When you start give your note to your guildmaster and get your newbie robe. Put one training point into piercing, evocation, abjuration, conjuration, and channeling. Scribe your two newbie spells minor shielding and Burst of Flame. Always keep yourself buffed with minor shielding - it does make a big difference at low levels. Use Burst of Flame to help kill your enemy while you melee it. get to level 4...no big problem. <br><br>Now the fun starts. At level 4 you get new spells and the meditation skill. Only put one point into meditate. It will rise very quickly. You should buy Summon food, Summon water, Flare, Summon dagger (all level 1 spells)...Summon Bandages, Burn, Gate, level 4 earth pet, level 4 water pet. At level 4 you should only buy the earth and water pets. The air and fire ones aren't very useful at these levels, however will become much more useful at higher levels (actually they become AWESOME at higher levels). Since you can summon bandages it is a good idea to summon a lot of them and practice your bind wound skill. It will allow you to heal any player, including your self up to half health. Also at these lower levels it is a VERY good idea to give your pets rusty two-handed weapons (rusty scythes, two-handed swords, and halberds). They will make your pets do MASSIVE damage and allow you to take BIG things. Now from level 4 until 8 your fighting strategy will be simple: send your pet, nuke the MOB with your damage spell (called a DD for short, for all you newbies reading this), and go in and tank for your pet if needed. Since you started out as a gnome or high-elf like I told you to (you did didn't you, hehe), you will be able to kill kobolds to get to level 6. If you are a high elf just run to steamfont...its only a 5 minute run. If you are a gnome...well steamfont is your newbie zone so you should already be there. The kobold camp has 3 kobolds that spawn at the camp and one off the side of the camp on the mountainside. To take the 3 kobolds you will need to give your pet a rusty scythe, two-handed sword, or halberd. They aren't that hard to find. Go to greater faydark and ask around for some. Or go to Felwithe, the starting city of the high elves. You will be able to find some rusty two-handers at many vendors. Kobolds will get you to level 6. Once you get to level 6 I suggest going to Butcher Block and killing dwarven skeletons at the druid ring. They are levels 5-7 and are VERY good exp. If your pet has a two hander you will do very well. The dwarven skeletons will get you to level 8. If you didn't start as a High Elf or Gnome (not recommended if you are first starting everquest), then just find stuff around your newbie zone. At levels 4-8 its not like there is a lack of things kill. IMO find a skeleton camp if you didn't start as a High Elf or gnome. They are in almost every newbie zone and will get you to level 8. <br><br>Some people when they first start out don't know how to control their pets. Here are most of the commands you will need to use to control your pet. <br><br>/pet attack - send your pet after whatever you want. <br>/pet back off - makes your pet back off the thing you are fighting. Has to be hit multiple times to work, and if your enemy attacks you, your pet will go in again. <br>/pet report health - this command makes your pet tell you how much health it has left. VERY useful command. Use it a lot in battle. Make sure your pet doesn't die. <br>/pet guard here - makes your pet stay where they are and come assist you if anything attacks you. They will return to the spot they left after killing whatever attacked you. <br>/pet get lost - if you get a lower level pet and you aren't satisfied, use this command to get rid of the pet and summon a more powerful one. <br><br>Some other things about pets. Once you get to level 8 MAKE SURE that you outdamage your pet with you DD spells. If you don't outdamage your pet then your pet will get half of the exp. from whatever you killed. From level 4-7 its fine if your pet outdamages you, and since you should be giving your lower level pets rusty two-handed weapons to make them do A LOT more damage, you probably won't be able to outdamage your pet. However once you get to level 8 make sure you take a little over half of your enemy's HP off with your own DD's so you get full exp. for the kill. <br><br>Level 8 is when magicians start to become REALLY good. At this level they get two great DD's, a damage shield, invisibility, a pet healing spell, a bunch of summoning spells, and of course your pets. The problem is that at this level spells suddenly cost a LOT for their level and you will have A LOT of spells to buy. If you have another higher level character this is no problem, but new characters will have to conserve their money. If you are low on money I suggest buying these spell first and the rest later: level 8 earth pet, Shock of Blades, Shield of Fire, Invisibility, and Staff of Tracing. These are the only spells you will need for now. The summon staff spell can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. Now to make a ton of money you are going to hunt wisps. Wisps can only be hit by magical means( ie spells or a magical weapon), so it is very important to buy your level 8 summon staff spell, because it will make your pets able to hit the wisps. <br><br>The best place to hunt wisps is on the wisp island located between Odus and Qeynos. To get to it, ride the boat from Qeynos to Odus and get off at the island the boat stops at in the middle of the ride. Be sure you brought a lot of backpacks/small containers. The strategy to kill these things will be summon an earth pet and give it a staff you summoned. Then buff the earth pet with your fire damage shield. Then send it in on the wisp and stand back and keep burning the wisp until it is dead. Tank for your pet and cast your shock of swords spell in-between the attacks of the wisp if needed. Make sure the wisp you attack is alone and there are no other ones near. Wisps WILL assist each other and at this level 2 wisps means death. Also, you will want to use your level 1 "summon dagger" spell against the wisps because it will summon a magical weapon, and if you are just starting out and don't have a higher level character, you probably won't have access to a magical weapon. Now when you loot the wisps destroy the burnt out lightstone and regular lightstone they drop. However save the Greater Light Stones. You will get one greater lightstone for about every 5 wisps you kill. When all of your backpacks and containers are totally full with Greater light stones, take them to the gypsy camp in North Karana if you are good aligned, or South Ro if you are evil, and give them to one of the ladies (I forget which lady it is exactly...just ask someone. If no one knows then just hail them all. The one you want is the one that talks about the Concordance of research.). For every greater light stone you give her you will get a good deal of exp. for this level and about 9pp. Very soon you will have enough money to buy the rest of your spells. Here are all the other level 8 spells you will want to buy: <br><br>Renew Elements - this spell will heal your pets. It is good spell during downtime if they aren't fully healed by the time your mana is full. You won't need it with your level 8 pets, but your level 12 pets that have more hp and regen slower (because of your pet buff burnout) might need to be healed sometimes. This spell is based off your Alteration magic group. This is the first alteration spell you will get. It will fizzle a lot, so practice it up. <br><br>Dimensional Pocket - this spell summons a 4-slot weightless container that makes anything you put into it weightless. Very useful, however USE WITH CAUNTION. The pocket, and everything you put in it, will disappear if you log off. Is good at higher levels when MOBS are dropped a lot of weapons that are too heavy to carry. Just summon a pocket and put them in it until you can go sell them. This spell can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Eye of Zoom - this isn't as useful a spell as it is fun. It will summon an eye than you can move around and see with. You can't have a pet out to cast this spell. Its fun to scout out an area with or scare lower level people, but it isn't really that useful. It also has a pretty short duration. <br><br>Lesser Shielding - this is an upgrade to your level 1 minor shielding spell. Always keep yourself buffed with it. <br><br>Flame Bolt - this is the other DD (direct damage) spell you get at level 8. It has a MUCH farther range than shock of swords and does more damage per hit. The downsides to it are that it takes more mana, has a slightly longer casting time, requires you to have a clear line of sight with your enemy, and will get resisted a lot by things with high fire resists. Its good for pulling things because you will be able to get 3 of them off before the monster can reach you, but generally you will want to use Shock of Swords. <br><br>If you ever suddenly feel like not making tons of money and get bored of wisps (unlikely), their are some other good spots to hunt. The first is the single siren spawn in OOT (ocean of tears). Take the boat from FP to BB. Eventually you will come to two large rocks jutting out of the water. Jump off the boat and swim to the left one. On the opposite side of the rock where you swam to is a level 12 siren. You can take her at level 8. Before you go get a bind at the docks in FP. The exp. is great, but its not quite as good as wisps, and the loot is nowhere near as good. In addition to the single spawn siren is the entire zone of steamfont. This zone has TONS of level 7-11 things...minotaurs, skeletons, pumas, plague rats, earth elementals, and even harpies! At level 8 you will be able to take all the 11 things if your pet has a weapon. I highly suggest using an earth pet if you come here. A good place to pull things is near the entrance of the minotaur cave on the wall. Ask for directions to the cave. The real danger here is the level 35 minotaur hero that will sometimes spawn and come near the mino cave. If you stay on the wall you will usually be fine. The last place to hunt from level 8-12 is in the east commons. Here you will see darkweed snakes practically carpeting the ground. Use a water pet to kill them because they have a VERY nasty poison attack, and the water pet will totally negate the effects of it. You will be able to take them fairly easy even if you don't give your water pet a rusty two-hander. With a rusty two-hander you will beat them into oblivion. <br><br>Now you will be able to get to level 12 quickly by killing wisps and turning in Greater Light Stones (or if you already had plenty of money so you went to one of my other suggested places). You will also make a ton of money (if you hunted wisps). I highly suggest buying a Stein of Mogguk with all your new money. It gives +10 to your intelligence, which gives you more mana. Also, I would buy some other +int necklaces, earrings, and rings. A new robe would be good too (do you wanna wear your newbie robe forever??) Here are the level 12 spells you will want to buy: <br><br>Burnout - This spell will make your pets regen their hp slower, but it will also make them attack better. A good pet buff spell. Always keep it on your pet. <br><br>Bind Affinity - AWESOME SPELL. This will allow you to bind yourself anywhere so that when you die, that&#8217;s where you will appear. Before you got this spell you had to have other people bind you, and you can only be bound in cities when other people cast it. <br><br>Cancel Magic - this has several uses. First off it can be used to remove any buffs your enemy has on themselves. Secondly, it can be used to remove most (but not all) DoT&#8217;s (or damage over time spells) that were cast on you by the enemy. <br><br>Ward Summoned - This is a good spell to use in lavastorm. The only problem is that there are way better places to hunt than lavastorm. Against elementals it is VERY good. It does the damage of fire bolt, and has the low resist, quick casting time, and lower mana that Shock of Steel has. However, it can only be used against summoned things. The only time you will use it is when dueling other people that have pets. <br><br>Summon Fang - This spell summons a 5/26 weapon that will hit magical creatures (hehe wisps!). If you still don't have a magical weapon at this level use this instead of your level 1 summon dagger spell to hit wisps with. You can fight wisps up to level 16, so it will still be useful. It can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Elemental Earth - Your earth pet will be the only pet you need to buy. It has massive hp and casts a root spell to keep the enemy away from you. Buffed with burnout and with its massive hp, you might get to full mana before it gets to full health. If that happens use your renew elements spell. <br><br>You also get two area effect spells at this level. The first type are rain spells. These are very good against 1-3 enemies. Against a single enemy a rain spell will hit 3 times. Against 2-3 enemies your rain will hit twice. Against 4 enemies you rain will hit once. Against more than 4 enemies your rain will only hit 4 of the enemies. The second type of AoE spells hits all enemies once. These AoE's are good against 4 or more enemies. <br><br>At level 12 there are a lot of things open to you. You can kill wisps all the way until level 16. At level 12 your pets will be to hit magical things without wielding magical weapons. Since your level 12 pets will only do 16 damage per hit (and that&#8217;s the maximum level pet), you should be giving them rusty-two handed weapons. If you can't get any two-handed weapons then just give your pet any weapon. If your pet has a weapon they will do a little more damage than normal even if the weapon doesn't make them hit for a higher maximum damage. Verant says it won&#8217;t do anything, but I don&#8217;t care. At least just give your pet a summoned weapon so they look pretty. Now if you don't want to kill wisps there are a ton of other things to do. <br><br>In Lake Rathe there is a level 15 monk called the hermit. He stands in this hut in the corner of the zone, and respawns every 5 minutes after being killed. He can get you to level 16 if you don't want to do wisps, or want to mix things up. Summon an earth pet, buff with damage shield and burnout, and then send your pet in and stand back and blast with Shock of Swords until he dies. If you don&#8217;t want to use an earth pet, try a fire pet. Since this guy is a monk, he does a lot of attacks per round, you&#8217;re your fire pet&#8217;s damage shield will help very much. Tank for pet if needed, however don't do it too much. At level 12 he will kill you quickly. Remember, make sure to outdamage your pet. He is very good exp. and will get you to level 16 pretty quick. The loot isn't nearly as good as wisps though. <br><br>Another place to hunt is in OOT (the ocean of tears), which is located between the continents of Antonica and Feydwer. You will be hunting sirens in this zone. Go to the docks in Freeport and bind yourself there. If you take the ship from Freeport to butcher block you will eventually come to two large rocks coming out of the water. Jump off the boat and swim to the rock on the right. Here you will see two level 12 sirens. Buff your water pet with burnout and your damage shield and send it in. If you bought your area effect spells this would be the time to use them (the rain based AoE works best). The sirens hit fairly hard but have low hp. After you kill the two sirens they will start spawning one at a time. Quickly kill them using your rain AoE, and make sure you spread out their spawns. That way you won't have to fight 2 at a time anymore. This spot is AMAZING exp., however like the hermit; it is not nearly as good loot as wisps. Also, be sure to give your pet a rusty two-handed sword before you engage the sirens. <br><br>The best spot to buy rusty weapons is on the boat from Freeport to butcher block. At the first stop you will arrive at sister island. Get off and go in the shop. They sell rusty halberds here. When giving to your pet, they will make your pet do 20 damage a hit. Also, it is highly suggested to use a water pet for the sirens, since you will have to kill 2 things every 5 minutes it is a better choice than the earth pet that might not be able to keep up with the quick spawns.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also on the island that sells rusty halberds are sisters that are levels 7-13. From levels 8 - 14, they actually make pretty good things to hunt. The sisters wander all over the island, and are usually easy to find. EVERY sister carries a rusty halberd, so you can kill them and give them to your pet. 95% of the sisters also have purity belts on them which can be sold for a plat to the vendors. Be careful not to pull moe than one sister while fighting here, bescuase they assist. Sisters also drop your faction with the elves, although it is easy to get it back up in crushbone.<br><br>Soon you will be level 16. All of these methods will level you fast (although I still think wisps are the best method because they give so much money). Once you get to level 16 the best place to hunt is in lake rathe, which is where the hermit was located if you went to fight him from 12-16. Before I talk about lake rathe I will tell you your new spells for level 16: <br><br>Shock of Flame - a new DD spell! At level 12 you didn't get a real DD, except for ward summoned which you probably didn't use. Sure, you got the rain spell, which can hit 3 times against a single enemy; making it mana efficient and doing good damage, but you didn&#8217;t get a real DD spell. For 70 mana this spell will start off doing 90-some damage. <br><br>See Invisible - this spell will allow you to see invisible players and pets. Since your air pet casts invisibility on itself a lot, its good to use this spell when using an air pet. <br><br>Summon Throwing Daggers - this spell will summon a bunch of throwing dagger that can be given to someone that uses throwing weapons (monks, rogues, and bards in general). This spell can only be bought in the dark elf, gnome, and erudite cities. <br><br>Heatstone - this spell will summon an item that will grant the user infravision. Is good to give to night-blind races or to use yourself if you started as an Erudite or human (Although if you are a beginner you probably did what I said and started as a gnome or high elf, which means you all ready have infravision). <br><br>Staff of Warding - summons an 8/38 staff with a couple charges of glimpse (which always you to see farther). It really doesn't have much use except to play around with the glimpse spell it comes with (or you can give it to a low level newbie...is a good weapon for a newbie). This spell can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Level 16 pets - At this level I would suggest buying all the pets. Also at this level you can not buy all the pets in your guild. The level 16 and 20 pets must be bought in OOT (the ocean of tears). The island next to Sister Island where the AC spawns is where you will find the vendor. <br><br>Shielding - An upgrade to your lesser shielding spell. keep it on at all times. The extra hp and ac can save your life if you need to tank and it&#8217;s a close battle. <br><br>Phantom Leather - this spell boots your AC and also lets your regen your HP a little faster. It is good for if you are going into a tough battle where you will probably have to tank. It takes a cat&#8217;s eye agate component to cast. <br><br>At level 16 you get the ability to start researching. Go to your guild and put one point into your researching skill and it will be maxed until level 20(there is a bug where after putting a point in at your guild it raises your skill higher then its supposed to). Of all the pure casters, magicians have it the hardest when it comes to researching. They have to combine old spells, a word, and an item to make scrolls they can use. I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about researching because it would take a LONG time to explain. So go to castersrealm.com and look at the magician research stuff. Hehe if you are a newbie first starting out, feel lucky. When I first started the game researching was nearly impossible. Since then, however, they have made it easier (although it is still fairly hard). <br><br>Okay now back to the hunting guide. At level 16 venture to Lake rathe. Here you will find a bunch of aviak guards that are level 16-20. For their level, they aren't that hard. At level 16 you will be able to take level 20 aviaks. This is also the level when you should start grouping. Almost all the aviaks in this zone are close together, and will attack you at the same time. The only time you will want to solo when hunting them is if you are at the single aviak spawn, or at the entrance to the arena zone where you can take the two aviaks one at a time. However this isn't always possible, as they are sometimes camped, so you will have to group with another person (or two other people if you want to take the 3-spawn aviaks). Aviaks are pretty good loot dropping up to 3pp and FS (fine steel) weapons which will sell for about 5pp each at the ogre vendors in the zone (don't worry even though they are ogres they sell to everyone). The aviak guards also drop words which you can use to research some of your level 16 spells (if you didn't buy them already). <br><br>Another good spot for level 16 is the zone Lake of ill Omen, located in Kunark near west Cabilis. There are a bunch of things here that will con blue to yellow for you to kill. It is a bit more dangerous here than in Lake Rathe though. <br><br>Fighting aviak guards or creatures in the Lake of Ill Omen will get you to level 20 pretty quickly. Some people will tell you that Oasis is a good zone for this level, but I totally disagree with that. It is severely overcrowded; the loot sucks, and there are specter and sand giant trains all the time. When you get to level 20 it's time for new spells! Here is the list of spells: <br><br>Bolt of Flame - this spell does MASSIVE damage and has a VERY long range too! But be careful, it has a huge taunt rate so you will usually want to use an earth or air pet when soloing because of their root/stun spells. Also you have to have a clear line of sight for it too work. <br><br>Elemental Shield - a fairly useful buff for things that cast spells. Raises your cold and fire resistances. <br><br>Spear of Warding - summons a magical spear that has a small fire and cold resist+ tacked on to it. Not all that useful. Give it to a newbie or a rogue without a magic piercing weapon. It can also be given to pet. It can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Renew Summoning - this is a very nice upgrade to your level 8 pet-only healing spell. Use it when your pet is low in HP or if your mana is full and your pet's hp isn't full. <br><br>Summon Arrows - this spell summons a bunch of magical arrows. Give them to people that use bows and don't want to spend money making or buying arrows. Fairly useful. Can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Summon Waterstone - this summons a stone with a charge of enduring breath, which makes you able to breathe under-water. Great for when you want to go to kedge keep at higher levels, or just to keep in your inventory incase you for some reason get caught under-water. It can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. <br><br>Shield of Flame - an upgrade to your level 8 damage shield. Definitely use it to buff your pet before you attack something or in a group on the tanks. <br><br>Rain of Fire - an area effect spell. This is useful when your group wants to take multiple mobs and there is no enchanter around to mezz the extras. Be careful though, it will get the monsters mad at you. It is also very good for soloing, because it will hit single mobs 3 times, making it very mana efficient. <br><br>Level 20 pets - I suggest that you buy all of the pets at this level. You can't buy them all at your guild. You have to go to the merchant in OOT on one of the islands to get the rest that aren't sold at your guild. <br><br>Now the level 20 fighting place - SOUTH KARANA!!!! This zone has TONS of stuff in it. At level 20 there are many things you can do. First off is the aviak city. The aviaks here anywhere from about levels 15-30. Get a group and kill rooks that spawn on the bottom, or go up to the penthouse. Splitpaw - right outside the dungeon of split paw there are three spires and a hill. Level 24-29 gnolls spawn here. If you are able to get in a group the exp. is pretty decent. Treants, these things are pretty good exp. and VERY good loot. They are heavily camped though, so you might have to wait to get in a group. Also treants drop your faction with druids and with Qeynos, so don't kill them if you don't want to be KOS at the druid rings or in Qeynos. Centaurs, these guys can be good exp. and drop some nice items too. The best place to hunt them is near the centaur outpost. Many will wander by the outpost. You will be able to solo any that don't con red. If you get in a group with someone that can track it is even better because sometimes the pickings get slim and having someone who can easily find more make for good exp. Also, there are a couple merchants in one of the stables at the centaur outpost. Sell there. There are also shadowed men that are in the low 20&#8217;s that you can kill. They make good target&#8217;s for your damage spells against summoned things, but you need a group, and the loot sucks very badly. <br><br>The last thing this wonderful zone offers....the hermit. In the middle of nowhere is a level 20 ranger. He is VERY good exp. Why? because he has a 3 MINUTE SPAWN. Not only that but the loot he drops isn't bad. PLUS, sometimes he drops FS two-handed weapons which you can give to your pet to make them do 24 damage a hit. The only problem is that he sits in a hut with a door that won't open. To pull him out go near the chimney of the house, have no one targeted, and say 'kill you'. After doing that a few times he will attack you through the wall and your pet will go after him. You won't be able to use your level 20 bolt spell the first time you attack him because it won't go through the wall. use your level 16 DD that will still hit him. I HIGHLY suggest that you use a water or air pet to camp him. Why? Because since he respawns every 3 minutes, your earth pet will never be able to regen in time, only your water or air pet will be able to keep up(well the fire pet could keep up too, but you don't want to use him here, dies way too fast). After you kill him the first time you won't need to say 'kill you' anymore. As soon as he spawns again just target your pet and type /assist. Then the hermit will automatically be targeted and you can pull him out of the house using your level 16 DD, and then once he teleports out of the house you can use your level 20 DD. However, if you are using a water pet and not an air pet, try to keep him in the house, pull him with your level 16 DD and then send your pet in, and then burn with caution so he stays on your water pet and doesn&#8217;t teleport out to attack you. If you are using an air pet it is fine to pull him out because the air pet will stun him and let you DD. <br><br>With everything it has to offer South Karana will be able to get you to level 30. You can easily get from level 20 to 28 just soloing the hermit. If the hermit is camped by someone else you can always do centaurs, gnolls outside of splitpaw, and aviaks. Plus once you get to level 24 you can go INSIDE spiltpaw with a group for decent exp. If you don't mind losing faction with the druids and Qeynos you can also kill treants which are a VERY good money source. Even better than the treants is the druid ring in east Karana(actually not that far away). Here there will be 3 druids (and sometimes you will get a few treants) that respawn every 3 minutes. It is WAYYYY better than the south Karana treants, but you need more people to hold it down, and its more dangerous. However, if you can get 4 casters(including you), in their mid to high 20's together, you will get AMAZING EXP. and INSANE LOOT. Of course you have to be willing to becoming KoS in Qeynos and at some of the druid rings. <br><br>Another good spot for levels 24 to 30 is the dungeon Solesk A. Get a map of the place and head to the 'frenzied' room. This spot is very nice solo exp. and loot, and there is a zone nearby if you mess up. Expect to die a couple of times though, becuase well, its a dungeon. Even if you die a few times, its still worth it. <br><br>A good spot in Kunark for level 24-30 is the forest giant mini-village located in the center of Warslick&#8217;s Woods. They are pretty good exp. and the loot is decent too. If you get really lucky they will drop a forest loop, which is worth a lot of money. This spot is a bit dangerous though, and don&#8217;t expect to get a forest loop soon. Be happy if you get a single one after 10 hours of fighting. <br><br>Once you get to level 29/30 you have a lot of options. Level 30 is the first 'hell' level so leveling to level 31 will take you a while. Also on the level 24 and 29 spells....buy ALL of them. Once you get to these levels simply buy ALL of your spells. You will be grouping more and more, and you never know when you might need a spell that would seem worthless to you if you were soloing. Also, most of the level 24 and 29 pet spells can't be bought and MUST be researched. You should be able to do all right without researching extra pets, but you should always try to get all of your pets. You should also have enough money by this level so that buying all of your spells won&#8217;t bankrupt you. When you get to level 29 ALWAYS give your pet two weapons that you are able to summon once you get to level 29. Some very good weapons to give your pets are gnoll hide lariats. They drop off of splitpaw gnolls and are cheap to buy. The sweet thing about them is that when your pet uses them, they will start proccing stun. <br><br>At level 29/30 a great zone to go to is OOT. Take the boat from Freeport to BB and get off at the first stop. On this island you will find two level 25 sisters that are near the docks and 3 dwarfs, 2 of which are level 24, and one of which is level 25. These guys are extremely good exp. Until level 34/35. Hunting the dwarf couple that spawn by the rock on one of the corners of the island will get you to level 34. The two sisters by the dock(one on the dock, one next to a tree by the dock) will get you to level 35. The dwarfs will drop your faction with dawrven NPC&#8217;s in BB, but not the guards. Killing the sisters will make you KOS in all of Faydark, but going to crushbone will give you back the faction you lost, if you care about it.<br><br>At level 34 a great Kunark zone is OT (Overthere). Here you will be able to fight tigers, sarnacks, rhino&#8217;s, and many other things. You can manage soloing here, but getting a group would be better. There are always lots of groups that are fighting here by the FM and SF zones, and in-between these zones on the wall. The loot isn&#8217;t too great, but this zone can take you to level 44. You CAN get higher than 44 here, but the exp. slows down around 44. <br><br>Also at level 34 you can also start killing Cyclops&#8217;s, Hill Giants, Sand Giants, Specters, and Griffins that don't con red(if they con yellow you still might not want to do it). They are all pretty good exp. and loot(especially the giants). It is really better to wait until level 39 to fight them if you are wanting to get exp, however you CAN kill them at 34. Also at level 34 you can start taking guards. They are level 30-35 in most places, with the best spot to hunt them being butcher block(the NPC&#8217;s, not the guards however) and steamfont(gnome guards)and rathe mountains(troll guards). All these things can level you from level 34 to 47 or 48(except the cyc&#8217;s). Overall though, a great spot for fighting these types of MOBS is Rathe mountains. This place has tons of Cyclopes&#8217; and hill giants. There is also a wizard girl in this zone that you can camp, and two troll guards that are level 35. At levels 34-38 you will only be able to take one of the guards at a time. At 39-43 you will be able to take both of them, but you won&#8217;t be able to totally keep up with both of the spawns. At levels 44-47 you will be able to take both troll guards and keep the spawns under control. The trolls guards and Cynthia are pretty heavily camped though, so don&#8217;t expect to just be able to go there and camp them. The good thing is that if they are camped there are always plenty of hill giants to kill which are good exp. and great loot. <br><br>Once you get to the 40&#8217;s the Dreadlands in Kunark is a very good spot to solo or group. Grouping is better here however, as in most Kunark zones, because lots of monsters wander around. This is a great zone and can easily take you into your low 50&#8217;s. <br><br>Now something else you will be doing a lot at this level is grouping. Starting at level 24 you should start grouping. All the soloing strategies I listed above are not the only ways to go. Grouping in Upper guk, Lower guk, Solusek A and B, Splitpaw, Mistmoore, Unrest, Karnor&#8217;s Castle, Kurn&#8217;s Keep, City of Mist, and other dungeons can work very well sometimes. Plus, once you get to your high 40's you will want to group A LOT. As a magician your role in the group will be to dish out a lot of damage via your pets, DD spells, and damage shields. Your malise spells will also be a plus if there is no shaman or enchanter around. You should start grouping as early as possibly to learn how to fight well in a group. As I said, once to get to your high-40's, grouping will become essential. It becomes a lot harder to solo. However if you do want to solo from the mid-40's to the low 50's, Seafury Cyclops's in OOT and ice giants in everfrost would be your best bet. However I wouldn't suggest that too highly considering that the exp. won't be as good as getting in a good group. Plus, before level 49 they are hard to kill, and will take a full bar of mana. <br><br>It would be too hard for me to write a guide for every single dungeon, so I am just going to give you an overview. I highly suggest grouping in dungeons now. Verant recently not only incresed the exp. for large groups, but also increased the exp. MANY dungeons give. Plus grouping is a lot of fun and soloing outdoors can get boring. <br><br>Lower Guk I a great spot at level 34+. There is a room in this zone called the &#8216;bedroom&#8217;, and it is a great spot to set up a group and pull from. It is very good exp., but be weary of trains. This dungeon is definitely a death box, and you will find that surviving in a dungeon as a magician is a much harder feat to do than other classes. In addition to the &#8216;bedroom&#8217; there are lots of other great things to do here. There is some MEGA loot to get, especially a Robe called the Shiny Metallic Robe, which is a rare drop off the ghoul magi dude. There is also a plethora of great fighter equipment here that you can sell or give to one of your twinks. Just of few things are the FBSS(a sash that gives haste); the exo axe, a nice two handed slashing weapon for a warrior; short swords of the ykkshea(the spelling is way off on that one, don&#8217;t know it exactly), which are one handed slashing weapons that proc a 75 pt DD, and many other great things. <br><br>Another dungeon I have experience in is Splitpaw. This is not as good of a dungeon as many others, but it is still a decent spot to group in and get exp. starting at level 24 and continuing up into the high 30&#8217;s. The only problem is that there usually aren&#8217;t enough people around to start groups in the higher level parts of this zone. As for magician loot the best drop is this zone is the gnoll hide tome with gives +10 int and a few other stats, but drops your strength(although your str. dropping isn&#8217;t that big of a deal). <br><br>At level 16 and up until the high 30&#8217;s one of the decent dungeons on the continent of Feydwer that you can go to is Unrest. Personally, I didn&#8217;t like it much because there were WAY too many trains, and it was even more of a deathbox than Lower Guk. However, you can do pretty well soloing lawn trash from 16-20, and this can be a great place to go if you get a good group. The only thing is good groups just don&#8217;t spawn every 3 minutes. =:-). If you can get a nice group though, you&#8217;ll have fun. There is a ton of FS weapons here that you can store in your summoned bags to sell for a lot of money. <br><br>One of my newly favoirte dungeons is Mistmoore. From level 24 until the mid 40&#8217;s, you can do great here. At level 24 to 30 you can make good exp. soloing the familiars near the entrance. The only downside is that you will be making hardly any money doing this. One of the best spots in this dungeon is the gravyard. Here you can get a small group and take the whole thing. There are 5 level 24-30 things that spawn every 15 minutes here. At level 34 you can even solo the whole thing by yourself, with some difficulty. If you do want to solo it, make sure you use an earth pet. Root is essential. The best drop in the graveyard for magicians is the sacrafical dagger. It is a 5/21 weapon that gives +5 to int. It is a common drop off of one of the rare spawns in the graveyard. This is actually a pretty small dungeon. However it is a great spot. Of course all of the dungeons on Feydwer are small. Except Kedge Keep&#8230;&#8230; <br><br>Ah yes, Kedge Keep. This zone is completely underwater and can be quite difficult to get used to. You will defiantely want the spell that summons you a waterstone here. I have only went here a few times, but there are some things I know aobut it. First of all, don&#8217;t go here if you want exp. You definitely can NOT solo here and there is almost always no one here. However, there are many great drops in this zone, so it is a great zone to raid. The best drop in this zone for the magician is the Staff of Elemenal Mastry Water. It is dropped off of the &#8216;boss&#8217; of the zone, Phingel Autotrops. When held your water pets will become much more power, even more so then when using the regular water focus item. I will talk about focus items in a little bit. <br><br><br>Nagafen&#8217;s Lair, or Solusek B as it is called, is a very good spot once you get to level 44. I definitely wouldn&#8217;t suggest going before 44 though, because if you do you will have to use your level 24 shock DD against all of the things in here. They have extremely high fire resists. There is more good fighter equipment drops in here than caster, but it is still a great spot for picking up exp. and money once you get to 44. Plus this is the only zone I know of that drops fire giants toes, which you need for your fire focus item. The only thing is that you need to get a good group that is fairly high level, since they are mildly hard. <br><br>Ah yes, focus items. Focus items are weapons that you hold. While holding them, your pets will be more powerful when you summon them. There are 4 different focus items, and each one is used when summon each kind of different pet. There is the shovel of ponz, torch of alna, broom of trilion, and stein of ullissa. Some of the spellings might be off a little bit. If you want to find out how to get these things, just check Allakhazam&#8217;s quest database. It would take me too long to go through everything you have to do. It would also be stupid since they are listed on this very site. Focus items work for all levels of pets, and when used on level 34 or high pets they will make your pets look a little bigger. Also, the fire focus item is the hardest to get. Took me a while to get fire giants toes for the quest. <br><br>There are also Staff&#8217;s of Elemental Mastery. These work just like focus items, but work even better. The water one is dropped off of the boss in Kedge Keep, the earth one is dropped off of Innoruk, and the air one is received from a quest in the plane of air. I have to idea where the fire one is dropped, and I am not even sure if it is in the game(yet). The water staff is the easiest to get and the earth is the hardest. <br><br>Also people, please try to HAVE FUN. Please don't do nothing but solo and/or kill stuff. Try adventuring(WITHOUT A MAP FROM THE INTERNET), roleplaying, and dueling. They add a lot to the game. It is just so exciting to be in a new place without knowing where you are, or fighting another player. <br><br>I think that just about wraps it up. <br><br>Former Player Of: <br>Zuranthium Spellcrafter&lt;Elitists&gt; - Level 50 Gnome Magician of The Tribunal Server. <br>Corpusnuntia Nimtathan&lt;Valorguard&gt; - Level 40 Erudite Necromancer of The Nameless Server. <br><br>P.S. &#8211; When pasted into Word Perfect this has 7,978 words.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I want to dispel some really prolific misinformation about Mage's pets and confirm some other points.<br><br>1. The beloved earth pet - the truth is that he BLOWS!&nbsp;&nbsp;You heard that right, the earth pet sux.  I know this is major heresy to conventional wisdom, but let me explain why the earth pet is actually the worst of all pets.  Sure, the EP(earth pet) has the most hp, but his agility is so bad that mobs just eat through all those extra hps.  Now you are stuck wasting time regenerating those same extra hps just to get going again.  The root sux, as it is often resisted, does no damage til very late levels.  Worst of all, the root forces a mob to continue trading blows with the EP instead of turning its back on you to run away.  Once the mob turns its back, damaging it enough to slow it down (to prevent adds) is easy.  If the mob is running toward another mob, nuke him, otherwise the pet will take him down, with no additional damage to itself.  To boot, the EP does not do as much damage as a FP(fire pet) and only *slightly* out damages a WP(water pet).  EPs are especially worthless in groups, as most pets are ignored by mobs when there are any kind of melee'ers in the group and someone else always seems to be rooting/snaring with better success.  I think people were hung up on the EP because they figured 'most hp + strength = best pet', but I can't tell you how many earth pets I have lost because a mob would continue to fight it instead of turning its back to run.  I understand people like there mobs rooted, but it isn't all that necessary if you moderate nuking with your pet's taunt.  In conclusion - Use  EP only when soloing in a dangerous zone where you really cant afford to have the mob run off to get adds.<br><br>2. The water pet - is likely the best pet in the game.  It is my favorite, especially when soloing.  It has good agility and therefore gets hit less, and thus takes less damage than a EP.  Has good strength, ac and hp plus has a small water/ice nuke which adds to the overall damage and strikes down fleeing mobs.  It is also immune to poison. Best of all, its regen rate is the fastest.  Which gets you back in the business hunting quicker.  If a mob misses an couple shots, these guys will actually heal about 1% in the middle of a battle  =).  Put a damage shield on one of these, and you'll have a watery juggernaut.  I will often just sit and med through a low blue mob with these guys.  Conclusion - the best for soloing.<br><br>3. The air pet - can be summed up in one word, "stun".  It's not a bad pet if you can get past the low hp and ac and the lowest damage.  The AP(air pet) really shines when it stuns a mob.  After all, a stunned mob cant deal out any hits.  For this reason the AP is especially good against casters which can't melee for much anyway, but the stun ruins spells.   When the mob is not stunned the AP still manages to survive do to its high agility.  The other major feature of the AP is its invisibility.  This makes it good for use in dungeons where the stupid pet's waypoint system will drag it all over the zone trying to catch up with you, dragging every mob in the zone with it.  Someone had posted this little pearl of wisdom on a message board somewhere:"There is nothing more frightening to a mage, than to be in the middle of the zone when you see the 'Taunting Attack' message, but your pet is nowhere to be seen"  Had that happen to me in Unrest.  Next thing I knew a Festering Hag had nuked me for 80% of my life.  An AP might have prevented that.  Conclusion - Use in dungeons or zones where way-pointing is a problem, and against casters.<br><br>4. The misunderstood fire pet - he not an evil guy...just misunderstood.  I actually rate the fire pet second best &lt;&lt;dozens of jaws drop to the floor&gt;&gt; of the pets.  It is true that the FP's hit points suck a big bowl of a$$, but the FP's offensive qualities will keep the mob's hp just as low.  Casting damage shields on the other pets _every fight_ is very mana consuming, mana better spent nuking.  But a FP *always* has a damage shield on, and it is better than yours.  Low blues will often take more damage off the shield than they can dish out to the pet  Plus the FP has the hardest hit of the pets.  All this combined with a nuke or two your own will cut down mobs fast (thus allow for faster leveling).  The fire pets disadvantages make it dangerous with more than one mob as you can only safely nuke one mob at a time.  FPs are hands down the best grouping pets.  In a group the top melee guy will attract most of the attention, so my pets are rarely even swung at and return with 100% hp 9 times out of 10.  Therefore, hp are not an issue, go for pure offense(unless the pet IS the tank of course).  FPs do require the most management because there hp are so low, so newbie mages may want to stick with a more robust pet.  Conclusion - group with this pet, soloing is possible, but watch the hp.<br><br><br>You may not agree with me, but don't listen to all the 'EP is the best, FP is the worst' nonsense that keeps getting recycled to all the newbies.  Try'em for yourself at different points and zones in the game.  They all the best at certain points, in certain zones.<br>Well I guess I will just wait for the flames to come in now, happy hunting.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I mainly agree with this guy. It is very true that in many places the earth pet simply sucks. Too many magicians stick to just using the earth pet. I DEFINATELY agree with part about the fire pet. It is SOOO good in lots of situations. Also, the air pet becomes very good once you get to about 24. It gets better and better as a tank as you level, and its stun gets better and better. Yes, it does dish out the least amount of damage overall, but it still does good damage.<br><br>Former Addict of Everquest.<br><br>Just remember everyone, Everquest is an awesome game. When you are playing it, continually think of how lucky you are. Everquest has left me so many good memories, and I am continually thankful that I was able to be a part of the game for the time that I played (nearly 2 years). Cherish every second that you play it, and try not to get to caught up in leveling and powergaming. It will frustrate you many times and you will got angry at it, but always remember how lucky you are to get to experience something so awesome as Everquest.<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Preach it brother! (or sister?)<br><br>I personally far prefer the air pet to water- I find that w/ malise his stuns stop runners better than the earth pet, and deal damage to boot!&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless I'm up against giants, I've always found the airpet's uber AGI (I've actually found my AP's AGI to be better than my FP's, though I may be wrong) will outweigh the EP's Hp's by at LEAST 20%.  Also, not getting hit means less mana wasted on pet heals (but I still keep RE memed).<br><br>The WP has immense application, though I've found it to be pretty specialized, there is no excuse for not having one in your spellbook (yes I met a fool mage who didn't have one a few weeks ago) SR in LGuk is so far where I use WP the most, but plenty of other spots; at level 12 I made a small fortune hunting darkweeds in ecomm with this guy.<br><br>FP:  Will always hold a special place in the hearts of Mages everywhere.  Not only is he the ULTIMATE damage machine, but he is the most closely related to our nukes; the mainstay of magician offensive(sp?) power.  Let's face it, they call us elementalists, but we are really fire-focused.  He also has the only tail of all the magician pets.  Coincidence? I think not!  We are ment for him, He is ment for us, he is the most powerful by far of mage pets, it's only a matter of knowing how to use him right.<br>Also, he keeps us warm on those long Velious trips.  I use my AP more often, but I love my FP more.  He's also got the best focus item;  honestly, the shovel is great fun, but you can't emote that you're lighting the warrior on fire with it (although if your ever in a cave somewhere, whip out the shovel for a sec and /em dug this cave with his/her own two hands!)<br><br>What is the EP? hitpoints. that's all he is, a bundle of hitpoints.  He's a good travel buddy, almost always gives me enough time to mem gate if I forgot before setting out, and buys alot of time to consider the fight and various options.  He's great for dueling tanks who will generally ignore his taunting and go straight for the caster.  But: his root NEVER sticks except on lowish blues and malise victims, he eats heal mana, he has no special skills (terrible singing voice, and can't cast clarity) he tracks dirt everywhere, and to top it all off: he smells bad!  Take a look at him once!  That's not all dirt!<br><br>If you don't agree, then fine, but also I should note that I have an actual disclaimer button for using the earthpet, noting that when the pet roots something in front of a wanderer and causes a 20-mob train(yes, EP causes trains! It takes a lot of work to keep this from happening, and sometimes in  dungeons a caster isn't up to it after a bad fight.), it was the group that wanted root: The mage said AIR!<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I actually think that the monster summoning is pretty dumb for soloing. Yeah, its cool for looks and to play around with, but its a random pet. I think the monster summoning line should have summoned a pet that actually had the same statistics of the kind of monster you summoned. Of course it would have to be about the same as normal level 34 pet, so when I say 'same' I mean in a proportional way. You wouldn't want to summon a beetle pet and have a pet with the same statistics of a level 1 beetle. And it would be unfair to summon a giant pet at level 34 that had the same stats as a giant.

In Erudin, theres a bard near the teleport to the bank area, in high keep, theres a wandering bard, and other places, so watch youself if you do this.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I am thinking of starting up on EQ and so far I have narrowed it down to a choice between a wizard or mage. I wont have a lot of time on the game (maybe an hour to 5 hours max at one time) so I am looking at a mage for the soloing ability so I dont have to spend all my game time looking for a group when I get high level. However I also favor the Wizard for its blasting ability. Any tips, advantage/disadvantages of both wizards and mages?<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Magician is very nice class.. Pack so much power and flexibility. It is great soloing class for a loner but after all, EQ is team game.. you should get into group whenever you can (to get friends build up). For pets; (my opinion) -- for everytime i say LATER level pet, that mean pass level 50 pet--<br>1. Earth pet is #1 choice to solo since root stop a mob from rushing at the magician, taunt very well, have lots of str and hp. The bad thing is it dont have agil.. It takes 85% hits enemy try to land. (at group is okay.. since it does root, and when theres a ranger on group who does snare, it will disadvantage the snare effect. Snare make enemy at 30% of its life turn around and trying to run but stand still while you beat the crap outa its back. When the pet root kick in, it will make MoB turn back on you and start fighting again.. so dont use earth pet inside a group who has snareR. ) :) On later level, earth pet Root spell will damage too :)<br>2. Air pet is the runner up. Stun a lot.. nice Agil to dodge and nice str, okay hp. Good for soloing and great for group (especially against dirty casters :)). At higher level, the stun actually does damage which make soo much effective. (On pvp server, Air pet become deadly at times. It cast invis on itself, making impression you are soft, vunerable little magician without pet. I killed some dirty caster with Air pet, some necro who think i dont have pet. Or some meleer who fool enough to think he can beat the crap outa soft magician. Or some wizard.. LOL :))<br>3. Water pet.. I put it on #3 but it does not mean it is bad. It is actually as usefull as air pet. It has Best Regen point, immune to ANY type of poison attack, cast ice based DD (good on pvp because most ppl concentrate on magic ressist.. so ice DD will kick in :)), has advanced AC (even better on fight than Air pet who has the best agil). While not as effective as Air pet when fighting casters, water pet can BACKSTAB later level which make those meleer who stupid enough to ignore pet and go straight at you forced to face back on your pet and get malised, striped enchantment, and some nasty fire based DD lol. (always use fire or ice based attack on pvp server.. most meleer goes for magic ressist on pvp which really not big a deal after you malise him/her, but fire DD always check fire ressist.. which meleer except ranger has no natural ressist on it whatsoever).<br>4. Fire pet. I think this is the most useless pet ever for magician. It is nice as alternative pet if you have a mage other than you on group who cast other type of pet. For small, get together hunting for exp group is okay.. but useless pet for big raid and serious camping group. Fire pet cast fire shield spell which always better than your fireshield spell (for example your first fireshield damage 5, but your pet has 6 or 7 damage.. self buffed spell). Even at later level, It is true that your Fire pet become somewhat "smart" and buff other pet on your group (if someone on your group is/are pet type class). But its Fire DD pretty bad since it got ressisted a lot by MoBs.<br>ALL in ALL, mage is much powerful than wizard. Wizard is group class and can be soloed if you have perfect score (perfect snare, perfect root, perfect blasts). If you as wizard mess up on first second root or snare, it will almost guarantee you to run to zone like a girl while the MoB cathcing you on its full speed (which you dont want lol :)).<br>Take care and great hunting fella magician.. or will be mage :)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>If you won't have much time to play then I would say play a magician becuase they can solo better.
