<p><b><font color="#000066">March 30, 2000:&nbsp; At the request of many
of the rogues out there, I have added a follow-up poll to the last two
on classes and grouping.&nbsp; Also, since some people were somewhat confused
on the platinum based auction having dollar signs at various places, I
went through the auction code and changed most of the places I could find
from $ to pp.&nbsp; (And believe me that wasn't easy since the $ symbol
is used as a coding symbol too).&nbsp; Although there are still a few places
with dollar signs, I think it is clear now that the bids are in platinum
pieces and not dollars.&nbsp; The auction has been up less than 24 hours
and already has almost two hundred items listed.&nbsp; That's great!&nbsp;
Don't be afraid to list or bid.&nbsp; I think this is a great way to buy
and sell items without eating into valuable hunting and questing time.
On top of that, I have a few other additions or changes:&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000066">March 29, 2000:&nbsp; I am real happy to announce
a new addition to the site:&nbsp; </font><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/auction/" TARGET="_blank">AllaKhazam's
Platinum Piece Based Everquest Auction.</a><font color="#000066">&nbsp;
I know I can't be the only one who hates to spend his time running from
zone to zone looking to sell or buy items.&nbsp; Hopefully, this will help
solve that problem.&nbsp; It should also help establish the going rate
of many items.&nbsp; The auction is similar to the Dollar based one on
One Web Place or E-bay, but not quite as sophisticated (for example, there
is no feedback section) and is based completely on Norrathian Platinum
Pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to sell an item, register, list the item
under your server, set a price and leave it open for a bid.&nbsp; It is
pretty self explanatory.&nbsp; You need to register with a valid e-mail
address to sell or buy.&nbsp; Hopefully, that will keep most people honest.&nbsp;
There are no fees involved, so feel free to list away.&nbsp; I have not
been able to test the script out at high volume, so please let me know
if you experience any difficulties.&nbsp; Enjoy.</font></b>

changed all links to other sites so that they bring up a new window, instead
of appearing in the frames.&nbsp; This should solve the problem with the
frames making the information unreadable at lower resolutions.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">March 24, 2000:&nbsp; Verant has said that
there are many quests in the game that nobody has solved, and that there
are other high level weapons and items still unfound.&nbsp; There are definitely
a number of unsolved quests out there which I know of, (and probably a
lot more I don't know about) and often groups of the the smaller quests
seem to have a common thread that makes you wonder if they don't build
into larger quests.&nbsp; Although I&nbsp; have a ton of quest information
here, I realized that I don't really have a way to share ideas and information
on the unknown ones.&nbsp; There is a lot of information that you can get
just from listening to the interaction on NPC's in the cities, but it would
be impossible for me to track much of it in any organized form.&nbsp; Thus,
I have added two features.&nbsp; First, I added a graphical question mark
next to quests that are unsolved or seem to lead further than the known
details.&nbsp; And second, I added a new forum to the forums section I
call "Quest-ions and Answers" for people to discuss possible leads on new
quests or discuss the ones that are already known.&nbsp; Hopefully, this
will prompt discussion and the sharing of information much like that which
helped lead to the solving of the fiery avenger quest.&nbsp; Actually,
I hope Verant learned something from that.&nbsp; Even non-paladins got
caught up in the excitement of finding the lost sword.&nbsp; I would hope
that they release hints of other special items to entice people to scour
the world for other quests, if they exist.&nbsp; It would add a nice additional
element to the game.</font></b>

of problems, but I think we should all give Verant some credit for creating
this amazing game that has kept us all so entertained over the past year.&nbsp;
I know for me personally it is without question the best game I have ever
played.&nbsp; To all the folks at Verant, if I could, I'd take you out
and buy you a round or two (especially with tomorrow being St Patrick's
Day) [if you're under 18, just ignore that sentence :)].&nbsp; Go on out

this was mentioned in a news update on the game last night, but I though
it was worth putting up here. Someone is sending out a bogus e-mail to
people in an attempt to steal your account.&nbsp; Here is the e-mail:</font></b>

We regret to inform you that our security systems will be shut down for
a period of 48 hours. Therefore no user will be able to log into their
account with their current password. This will become effective starting

<p><b><font color="#000066">OK First to those who received this e-mail.&nbsp;
Don't respond to it, and obviously don't change your password.&nbsp; Hang
on to it.&nbsp; If you did change your password, go immediately and change
it back.&nbsp; If it won't change back, contact Verant immediately and
tell them what happened.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">Now for the person who sent this out.&nbsp;
I hope you are reading this.&nbsp; Congratulations.&nbsp; You have won
yourself an all expense paid trip to the federal penetentiary.&nbsp; Let
me lay it out for you since you clearly are not too bright.&nbsp; You attempted
- and perhaps succeeded in some cases - to defraud hundreds of people of
something they value very highly.&nbsp; You did it by sending messages
across state lines, thus making this a federal case.&nbsp; And, you did
it through your AOL account, so they know exactly who you are and where
you live.&nbsp; In summary, you have commited a felony which can easily
result in years of jail time.&nbsp; Any one of the people you sent that
e-mail to can press charges, as can Verant and Sony, so the odds are good
that someone will.&nbsp; The FBI is a very thorough and methodical organization,
so it may take a few months for them to collect all of the e-mails, subpoena
your address from aol and formally put together a case.&nbsp; Expect them
to show up at your door in the near future.&nbsp; Look at the bright side.&nbsp;
You may be released in time to play Everquest 2.</font></b>

come in on the </font><a href="quests/Fiery_Avenger.htm">Fiery Avenger

solving it.&nbsp; Gordon also made an interesting statement on the boards
that there are other top notch weapons out there for other classes that
just aren't getting the hype of the Fiery Avenger and thus have not yet
been found.&nbsp; I personally wonder about that, but I would be interested
if anyone has stumbled across other potential high level quests.&nbsp;

<p><b><font color="#000066">March 8, 2000:&nbsp; I had to check my e-mail
archives to be sure, but this is indeed a special day.&nbsp; One year ago
today I signed up with a free webpage service and uploaded a one page Everquest
player's guide to a site I whimsically named AllaKhazam's Magical Realm.&nbsp;
I had never designed a web page before and had absolutely no idea what
I was doing, or for that matter what I was getting myself into.&nbsp; I
remember how thrilled I was when I realized a thousand people had read
my player's guide.&nbsp; Now the site runs on its own server, gets more
than 30,000 visits a day and contains well over 2,000 pages of information.&nbsp;
Magical indeed.&nbsp; I want to take the opportunity to thank all of you
for supporting the site and for continuing to submit new information, corrections
and suggestions.&nbsp; I'm going to do my best to continue to improve the
site, and there's no reason the next year can't even be better than the
last.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">OK enough of this mushy stuff.&nbsp; New information
has come in on the </font><a href="quests/Fiery_Avenger.htm">Fiery Avenger
quest</a><font color="#000066">.&nbsp; It seems likely that the Plane of
Sky is indeed the start of the quest.&nbsp; The NPC's involved were recently
put in the game and&nbsp; two of the four items you seem to need are known
to exist.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this is kind of a fun quest to solve, assuming
of course you are a level 50 or so Paladin, I have tiered the quest information.&nbsp;
I now have logs of conversations with the two NPC's involved and a background
story that seems to fit in with the quest. Since they are major spoilers,
I have put them on separate pages.&nbsp; This way you can look at the quest
description and see who you need to talk to without knowing all of the
details, or you can just read the logs and get the whole story.&nbsp; I'll
probably follow a similar format for other major quests in the future.</font></b>
