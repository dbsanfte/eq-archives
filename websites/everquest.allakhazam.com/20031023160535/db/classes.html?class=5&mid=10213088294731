I have rarely used Desease Cloud for taunt, but kept it memmed when I was backup Tank so I could brag quick agro when needed (adds or Cleric starting to take hits).  Otherwise I use Torrent of Hate and Shroud of Pain all the time, but have to be very careful I don't pull agro off Main Tanks using them both.  SO, with 2 very fast casting, low mana spells that actually give real benefits I can create more agro that I normally want.  I didn't use Shadow Vortex alot as it over-agro's both of the other debuffs I use.  Now Shadow Vortex has gone back into use, and I LOVE what it does for my AC during fights.<br><br>My advice, when you are Main Tank either Darkness or cast Shadow Vortex on pulls as the MOB is inbound.  If you are pulling as well pull with Darkness and then stop and stack all your debuffs on the MOB as you bring it back to the group.  Yopu will have no trouble at all keeping agro after that.  If you are back-up Tank and need to get something off the Chanter fast use Shadow Vortex with a Bash/Slam, stunning a MOB really upsets them for some reason.  If you keep the MOB debuffed, carefully so as not to draw agro from the Main Tank, you should be high enough on the hate list to pull it quickly to you when needed with either Shadow Vortex or Heart Flutter (which out taunted Desease Cloud in most higher level zones but is just much slower cast time).<br><br>So now Shadowknights, we must adapt and move forward.  No complaining, sulking about or self doubting, we still rule the Agro by alot, we just have to use more of our skills to do it.  Let those weak Pali's rely on a lowbie spell for agro, we will do more damage and be more useful now while still keeping the agro away from them.<br><br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 55 DE Revenant</p>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 62 DE Gravelord<br>Have Axe, will travel</td></td></tr>

I'm not sure you will ever hear a caster say that bind affinity, SoW or Gate/Port is useless and they are fairly low level spells.<br><br>Secondly, when I am in a group, my job..unless I am MT...is to keep an eye on all the caster types, especially clerics, enchanters, and wisards to make sure that nothing beats on them for any length of time.  Disease Cloud(1.5 sec. Cast/Mana 10/Recast=6 sec. + no buff counter) was a much better, less mana intensive method of taunting then the two spells you have mentioned (Torrent of Hate = 1.5 sec/Mana 60/Recast 6 sec  Shroud of Pain = 3 sec./Mana 100/Recast 6 sec.)<br><br>When I am main tank...once I have aggro, the wisards, clerics and other assundry magic types can cast with impunity (mostly) because of this fast, low mana spell.<br><br>Mana intensive spells can cause you to have to med. much more frequently and if pulls are coming quickly, you may not have the time.  And the number of buffs that you have may not be an issue in experience groups, but I'm betting you will miss the shammy or cleric buffs that Torrent and Shroud will overwrite in a raid situation.  (And from what I have read...it seems that the Torrent line of spells really don't generate that much aggro.)<br><br>Shadow Vortex is a slightly different issue...it is a good aggro gaining spell, but again mana and buff slots are an issue.  The one good thing that SV had over DC is of course DC is a DoT, making it unuseful if you want to re-mez a mob.<br><br>Darkness is a good spell as well...If it sticks, which I find to be about 2-5.<br><br>You mentioned pulling as well.  I'm thinking that if you are stoping to debuff mobs on the way in, that you are a fairly slow puller due to extended time having to med even if you are a Dark Elf.<br><br>You are correct that many of our other spells can fill in where DC left off.  SV and Heart Flutter are good choices.  However, those are both level 39 spells.  What is the level 17 SK going to use to save the life of his shammy, rogue, monk, or cleric hunting partner?  <br><br>And I sincerely doubt that you will be able to taunt off a Pally who uses those &quot;lowbie spell for agro&quot; if they don't want you too.  (Losing aggro to a Pally is very annoying...especially when you can't get it back.)<br><br>And lastly, I have no problem with dealing with adversity.  Shadowknights have been dealing with challanges since they picked up a sword.  (I still remember the 20% hybrid experience modifier)However, I do get annoyed by Verant &quot;fixing&quot; a problem, but being completely unaware that they were causing another, especially when that problem is a class defining ability.<br><br>Good hunting all...see ya in Norrath.</p>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></td></tr>

And the stopping to cast on a pull is only really useful when you are pulling with a Darkness line spell, which you don't do in high tempo groups anyway.  But in the 30's and into the low 40's I pulled this way alot and was always welcome in groups as I kept the xp rolling without adds.  But yes, it's not an everyday technique but something the low levels could use.<br><br>Next, I still have never seen Torrent of Hate over-write a Shaman buff.  Will you please tell me what buffs this over-writes.  I understand the issue when you have a full buff window, but besides then I've never seen a conflict, and I Raid with full lvl 60 Shaman buffs and Chanter buffs, usually Druid buffs instead of Cleric buffs though.  So this one I really am looking for info, help me out.<br><br>Shroud of Pain is a spell I was using post-patch in Tenumbrous Mnts at the Castle.  I was with 2 groups, we had a lvl 58 Necro pulling as she new the Castle and I don't.  When she pulled, I stood just in front of the MOB and caste Torrent of Hate and never once did the MOB pass me to chase the puller or did I have a problem keeping agro with a Ranger, Rogue and Wizard in the mix.  I did switch to 1hb and a shield, but I always do that when Main Tanking anyway, but Bash does help agro alot.<br><br>Shadow Vortex is a great taunter, and yes it takes longer to caste and more mana, but it's very effective.  I was using it to pull agro before in other groups, and it will pull MOBs to you very quick unless someone has done something absolutely stupid (Ice Commet on pull for instance).  Remember I group with a Chanter almost always, I know I can get a MOB off him if MEZ fails or breaks before he's memblured it.  Shadow Vortex is awesome at this.  AND if you SV the mezzed MOBs after memblur the Chanter can sit right next to the MOB and once mez breaks the MOB ignores them and finds you.<br><br>As for out taunting Pali's, it's not tough at the high end.  They use stun alot, but for MOBs that are immune to stun this is a limited taunt.  I use alot of spells when I fight, so for a Pali to ever get anything off me when I don't want them to is very unusual.  If I do loose agro, I can always get it back quick with SV, bash and stand INSIDE the MOB when you taunt.  Getting as close to the MOB as possible is the most effective taunter in the game.  Even if the Pali s effectively stunning, just step inside of him, bash, taunt and caste SV, when stun wears off, it will hate you more anyway.  And if all else fails HT it in the mix for another taunt (every 70 minutes).<br><br>Basically we're ok with taunt still.  Some people will have to change their tactics a bit, we will have to relook at our spell line-up, but we've still got it.  And if you're not pulling sit between MOBs so you can keep the mana coming in.<br><br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 55 DE Revenant</p>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 62 DE Gravelord<br>Have Axe, will travel</td></td></tr>

I'm sorry to have to drag this up over and over again but there is no (!) sk spell equivalent to the old Disease Cloud at the moment. One of my greatest advantages as a tank when fighting with my regular group deep in the Hole or Chardok was that I could break a mezzed and slowed mob with the chanter sitting down and I'd still have aggro. I'd do my little &quot;routine&quot; as my group mates called it, Taunt, Shadow Vortex, Disease Cloud. The time consumed in this routine is minimal, next to none. I can taunt and mez break still but to achieve the same effect we are talking double if not triple the time from before. Is this a large issue? Yes, it is.<br><br>The two zones I mentioned have a fast spawn rate and minimizing the time every kill takes is important. Imagine yourself fighting to a camp, this is usually a very mana intensive process. Now imagine &quot;doing&quot; a zone, fighting from the entrance of The Hole and down to Kindle/High Scale Kirn with one group, without pausing or medding. Not having a shaman in the group set up the chanter is also responsible for slows. My chanter has C3 and still tells me to taunt so he can sit and med down in Chardok. Maybe this doesn't apply to just sitting at a camp and killing a set number of spawns but if you want to swing down and take out Prince you need to be on the move constantly or back pops will get you. The advantage of having an sk tank was that your group speeds up it's kill rate greatly, due to fast mez breaks and damage dealers not having to be so careful of their aggro, and in my opinion this was somewhat effected by the change of disease aggro.<br><br>I don't believe in the word &quot;nerf&quot; since a fix is a fix and obviously intended. However, I do think that this is an unforseen side effect that VI didn't really think of. Life goes on though, I will /feedback this and it will probably still stay the same. There's not much one can do, I feel somewhat entitled to at least come here and give my opinion of why this was bad for the sk class.<br><br>As for Torrent of Hate having any taunt value, I think it may be on account of the zone you are in. Different mobs in different zones react differently to spells. I wont say that was the case in Tenebrous since I've never fought there myself but if you thought Torrents gave aggro you should perhaps try with some of the other spells known for their hate creating factor. Try going into CoM and stand in the pull path, no matter what the puller has done to the mob that's incoming (excepting Shadow Vortex) that mob is going to aggro on the very first thing in it's way, not follow the puller to the group. The mobs in Velketors Lab are very insensitive to spells, they simply don't give the aggro they do in Seb. Chanters usually love Velks on account of the low aggro their mezzing and slowing pulls. I think as a rule of thumb you could say that if a low aggro spell like Torrent of Hate is giving you aggro then a spell like Shadow Vortex or Disease Cloud (pre fix patch) will glue the mob to you. I base my no aggro statement on Torrent of Hate on the mobs in Arena. Just like I said, standing in camp I cast Torrent of Hate on incoming mobs that had just been tagged with an arrow or proximity aggroed and they never even looked my way. Shadow Vortex and Disease Cloud had the opposite effect though. From this I deduct that ToH is lower aggro then the two others. Even Shroud of Pain pulled aggro so ToH must be lower aggro then that too. I base it on being able to actually cast the spell on many raids where other Shrouds etc pull immediate aggro if cast early in a fight. Basically, read my other post as to what I think VI is trying to achieve with for instance ToH.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri May 17 08:54:03 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br></td></td></tr>

I have also fought into Royals in Chardok, held camps in Seb, Chardok, Velks (including Frenze which seems to be the fastest action of any Camp there on my Server) and Main Tanked in the Arena and Reavers in CoM.  So YES, I know those camps and zones, and I know how agro differs.  But I was giving a REAL example of a post patch success, and no the MOBs in Ten. Mnts. will run past you if not taunted, the Beastlord for our group kept getting in front of me but never gt agro'd on the way past.<br><br>Shadow Vortex and Heart Flutter ARE every bit as big taunting spells as Disease Cloud was, they are just slower and more mana.  I have been told on Raids prior to this not to use either spell because the Main Tank can't hold agro when I cast them.  Either of these spells will bring the instant agro you need to protect a Caster.<br><br>I don't know what to account our so very different experience with keeping agro, except that I tried not to use disease cloud all along and found other taunting spells that worked as well or better for me depending on the zone.  For example, Heart Flutter in Sireen's Grotto would cause so much agro that I was forced to FD to let the Warrior get agro back, Shadow Vortex in the same zone was much lower agro.  In Seb I've found Shadow Vortex to be the superior Taunt.  Giants absolutely hate Boil Blood, but inside Kael Arena Darkness seems to be the best taunt.  I have even found MOBs that hate lifetaps more than almost anything.  But as a rule, once you stack the debuffs on a mezzed MOB the Chanter should be safe, unless he's sitting right next to the MOB when mez breaks.  <br><br>YES you need more mana to keep agro now, but I still go OOM last in a group.<br><br>Neptunis Rex</p>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 62 DE Gravelord<br>Have Axe, will travel</td></td></tr>

Further, the number of spells that cause a ton of agro has just been drastically reduced.  =(<br><br>I think Verant generally does a decent job of thinking matters through (despite alarming silliness at times), but reducing an SKs ability to taunt is an interesting adjustment to say the least.  Did they intentionally do this?  Im not sure, but I can say that SKs as a whole are weaker, regardless of whether you change strategies or not.  And in case you haven't noticed, SKs generally arent the 1st class picked when many are forming their &quot;dream&quot; groups....<br><br>On an (marginally) unrelated note, DoTs with chanters are perfectly fine---you just have to be careful.  I DoT all the time in Sebilis or Chardok &amp; there has seldom been, if ever, any problem.  The primary trick is to do 2 things:  1) wait until MT starts clobbering a MOB (that you are /assisting if you are not the MT) and 2) let the group know that the mob is DoTed.  That's it. Seldom will you ever have a problem.  Boil Blood is a decent spell &amp; I use it all the time.<br><br>=)<br><br>Lunatic</p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

First off, it's virtually no aggro at all. You can throw it on an incoming mob that someone just tagged with an arrow and you still wont get any attention from the mob. <br><br>Secondly, it's a great buff (47+ to attack) and melees always save a buff slot for it and actually ask you to cast it if you happen to miss once(unlike Torrent of Pain which adds 12ac, that slot could be used for something much more beneficial).<br><br>Thirdly, the resistance check isn't made on mr. Giant Captain in WW is for instance 100% mr but Torrent of Hate lands on him.<br><br>And fourth and last, it seems to have a zonewide range. If you are out pulling half way across an outdoors zone or deep in some dungeon the buff will still reach your party.<br><br>So, a shadowknight spell with no aggro, a meaningful purpose, that you can land even on fully magic resistant mobs and be nowhere near your party and still have them receive the benefits of. Seems the thought is to increase the usefulness of the shadowknight as a member of high level raids in my opinion and I think it works, to a degree at least. Shadowknights need a skilled player to come to their full potential :)<br><br>Torrent of Fatigue is perhaps also a part of this thought but as of yet it is unbelievably bugged (it seems to add 20 sta to the actual stat Stamina but for some reason it drains your sta bar. Even sitting, non-active characters will get their sta bar drained in roughly 30 seconds).<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue May 14 10:31:27 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br></td></td></tr>
