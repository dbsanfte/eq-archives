<p><b><font color="#000066">April 27, 2000:&nbsp; I have another big Kunark
update for you.&nbsp; This is an all in one update since I intend to spend
tonight watching hockey (Go Flyers!).&nbsp; I've continued to add to the
zone descriptions as more
is learned about the various zones.&nbsp; The
ones listed below are ones I made significant changes to, but many of the
others have had minor changes.&nbsp; I also updated the </font><a href="zones/Level_Chart.html">Zone
Level Chart</a><font color="#000066"> with some changes and a couple of
new zones.&nbsp; I think it is pretty accurate for those zones that are
listed, but again cannot guarantee it.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, I added
a few Iksar images to the </font><a href="equipment/fashion/Fashion_Table.html">fashion
table</a><font color="#000066">.&nbsp; For the equipment section, I have
added a new icon (<img SRC="kunarkicon.gif" height=12 width=46>) to indicate
which items are from Kunark.&nbsp; This will make picking out the expansion
items easier, without having to separate them out from the regular item
tables.&nbsp; (Thanks to Aithael for sending me the icon).&nbsp; In addition,
it is worth mentioning that </font><a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/" TARGET="_blank">Illia's
Beastiary</a><font color="#000066"> has also been adding Kunark Mobs and
has several zones pretty much completed, so go check it out.&nbsp; I also

Update:&nbsp; (11:00 EST):</font><font color="#000066">&nbsp; I have a
lot of new zone and quest information.&nbsp; Things are starting to fall
into place here and gain a little cohesion (or maybe it's just sleep deprevation).&nbsp;
I added a Connections line to each Kunark zone page to list which zones
connect to that zone.&nbsp; I also replaced the
</font><a href="maps/Kunark_Zone_Connections.html">Kunark
Zone Connection
</a><font color="#000066">Map with one sent in by Toadeye
that has most of the zones listed, along with /locs of the connections.&nbsp;
Most of the Kunark zones have some updates to them to clarify what's there,
so just check them all, and the </font><a href="zones/Level_Chart.html">Zone
Level Chart</a><font color="#000066"> has been modified based upon further
information to hopefully be a little more accurate and include more of
the zones -- But I would still be cautious relying blindly upon the levels
there.&nbsp; A whole pile of new quests have been added in a number of
different zones.&nbsp; Although many are still just the beginnings without
any true conclusion, some are very interesting looking.&nbsp; Here are
the updated quest sections (I didn't list the zones since most Kunark zone
sections have updates - so just klick on Kunark to the left and explore):

<p><b><font color="#000066">Just like yesterday, I'm starting you off with
another huge Kunark equipment update and hope to follow later on with a
quest and zone update.&nbsp; Karnor's still seems to be the most popular
of the new zones, but I have noticed more items coming in from the other
zones as well.&nbsp; I added probably another 100 or so items to the database.&nbsp;

Update (11:00 EST):</font><font color="#000066">&nbsp; Well I promised
a zone and quest update, and here it is -- a big one.&nbsp; I have quite
a bit more information on the various Kunark zones, although many are still
far from complete.&nbsp; Some are still in that "I went in and everything
conned red so I got the heck out of there" stage.&nbsp; Soon larger parties
will invade them and more will become known (hint, hint).&nbsp; Clearly,
Karnor's Castle seems to be the best item zone so far, but many other high
level zones haven't really been explored.&nbsp; I seems that even the low
level Kunark zones seem to be far more rich in specialty items than the
comparable zones in the other continents, but that observation may just
be based on seeing everything coming in at once.&nbsp; I also have most
of the Kunark zones listed in the </font><a href="zones/Level_Chart.html">Zone
level chart</a><font color="#000066">.&nbsp; I want to caution everyone
that the level ranges are still preliminary and subject to change, but
I think they are at least within a level block of being correct.&nbsp;
Just be careful if you are at the low extreme of what is listed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In addition, I have a preliminary chart of </font><a href="maps/Kunark_Zone_Connections.html">Kunark
Zone Connections </a><font color="#000066">that was sent in to help navigate
the continent - be aware that it may still be a bit off.&nbsp; And finally,
I have a lot of new quests, including most of the </font><a href="quests/Q_FirionaVie.htm">Firiona
Vie Quests</a><font color="#000066"> (including the Illusion Iksar information).&nbsp;

[pant. pant].&nbsp; I managed to get away from the site and onto the game
for a few hours last night and play a new Iksar and I have to say that
from what I saw they did a great job with the new zones.&nbsp; Very impressive.&nbsp;
Verant has been loudly criticized, with some cause, for the ROK shipping
snafu, but someone should take some time to praise them for the fantastic
job they did with the expansion.&nbsp; They just took an already fabulous
game and wratcheted it up yet another notch.&nbsp; All I can say is forget

the new Iksar, look like far too much fun.</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000066">April 10, 2000:&nbsp; I'm sure we are all anxious
to check out the new expansion, which supposedly ships out tomorrow (but
probably can't be played until the 24th).&nbsp; [Hmm.&nbsp; I probably
should buy some stock in Maxwell House or Jolt Cola.]&nbsp; I anticipate
a lot of new information coming in when the expansion goes live [yeah I
definitely should buy that stock], so I will probably only concentrate
on item and quest updates for the few weeks after the release (and of course
Kunark zone info).&nbsp; I'm just saying this so that you know that information
sent in on other sections will have a little more delay than usual.&nbsp;
Also, while I will try to give credit whenever possible, it is likely that
I will get multiple submissions on new items and quests and may not be
able to credit all submitters.</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000066">April 7, 2000:&nbsp; I have quite a few updates
for you today to keep you busy through the weekend.&nbsp; Based upon your
feedback, we are working on a couple of improvements to the platinum auction
section that I think will make it a lot more practical and easier to use.&nbsp;
Some will be added soon, and others will take a while longer.&nbsp; Among
these are a buyout option so that you can basically opt to sell items for
a flat rate rather than via auction (which we hope to have done soon) and
a classified feature so that a buyer can place an ad looking to buy certain
items.</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000066">April 6, 2000:&nbsp; Important information:&nbsp;
Many people are having trouble logging in after the latest patch.&nbsp;
Verant tech support has stated that you can fix this by downloading and
installing the newest version of DirectX: 7.0a.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can get
it here:&nbsp; </font><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/homeuser/downloads/default.asp">Microsoft
DirectX d/l page</a> .</b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">Apparantly Verant has changed its mind about
scanning player's computers.&nbsp; Thus, I have taken down that poll and
put up a new one (it is interesting though that my results are a little
different than theirs).&nbsp; I'll have some updates for you later.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">April 5, 2000:&nbsp; Interesting day.&nbsp;
In&nbsp; light of Verant's new contractual language banning all sale of
Everquest items and Accounts, I have taken out my links to the cash based
auction section on One Web Place.&nbsp; This does not affect the Platinum
auction section, which is simply a convienient method of arranging the
in game sale of items and has been deemed OK by Verant.&nbsp; I apologize
to those who have used and enjoyed this feature.&nbsp; My purpose for running
this site has always been and will continue to be to provide the best overall
information and service to the entire, diverse Everquest Community.&nbsp;
I have never been too concerned with making Verant happy.&nbsp; In fact,
from the little contact I have had with them, I get the impression that
they don't like this site a whole lot, as it provides too much accurate
information to the players.&nbsp; (For example, I've been trying unsuccessfully
to contact them for months now to let me get some advance information on
Kunark so that I don't go crazy keeping up with the updates on the new
expansion).&nbsp; I want to make it clear that Verant has never contacted
me about the auction section (which has been up for about 8 months now),
and still has not asked me to take it down, even in light of the new contractual
changes.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I do not wish to endorse or condone violations
of the game contract, and thus feel an obligation to take down this section
now that it is officially banned.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">Also, I thought I would put up a poll regarding
the new policy giving Verant permission to read files in your computer.&nbsp;
In case you didn't read it elsewhere, here is the policy:</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"You hereby grant us permission to download Game-related files to</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
you. You also grant us permission to access, extract and upload</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(i) Game-related data as part of the patching process and (ii)</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
data relating to any program that we, in our reasonable discretion,</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000066">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
determine interferes with the proper operation of EverQuest."</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">This apparantly includes looking at your cookies,
temporary internet files, registration information and browser history
files.&nbsp; Not being a programmer myself, I have to say I don't totally
understand all of the implications of this policy (though I have a good
idea), so I am not taking any stance one way or another.&nbsp; I certainly
am against any hacking of the game, but am also a person who values his
privacy.&nbsp; Thus, I thought it would be interesting to do a poll.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">April 4, 2000:&nbsp; Here are a couple of pointers
on quests that have been submitted that I think many people don't realize.&nbsp;
Supposedly, the higher level quests do not bracket the key words you need
like the lower level quests.&nbsp; In fact, many of the key phrases will
not come from the NPC you are talking to, but instead from other NPC's.&nbsp;
So don't think that because there is nothing bracketed that you can't get
a quest or elicit further information. There is also a lot of interaction
between NPC's that can give you a clue as to where to find and solve quests.&nbsp;
Just standing around listening in on the conversations in town can lead
to some interesting side adventures.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">The auction section seems to be going well.&nbsp;
I've had a few suggestions on features that can improve on it and will
look into some things.&nbsp; One suggestion I have for those posting items
here is to keep your time period for bidding fairly short.&nbsp; Since
it is free to post, you can always post a minimum or reserve that you can
live with, set the time for only a few days, and if you don't get it, just
repost the item later.</font></b>
