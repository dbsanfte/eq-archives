	   <tr><td colspan=2>i see alot of folks talking about Totemic armor for shaman. I looked at this armor, and its nice to have the balanced stats, but I am a shaman and want WISDOM.<br><br>Banded Gauntlets&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>AC: +7  <br>Weight: 4.0 <br><br>Imbued Northman Ring Gauntlets (Tribunal) <br>AC: +9 Str: +1 Wis: +2 Cold Resist: +2  <br>Weight: 5.0 <br><br>Totemic Gauntlets   <br>LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM  <br>AC: +11 Int: +5 Cold Resist: +5  <br>Weight: 2.8 <br><br>I use the Gauntlets here as examples 2 points of ac are good on the totemic, but even for trade skills that int doesn't help. There are a total of 8 pieces of totemic armor only a couple of which have wisdom.  All armor slots can be filled with Imbued Northman. <br><br>13 armor slots each giving +2 wisdom is a 24 point increase to wisdom. Each piece is 2 points better than the same banded which is a nice ac boost. Northman weighs 1 more than the same banded, but it also gives 1 str, end result you are no more incumbered by it than banded and can do a bit more damage due to the added str. <br><br>Total Stats:<br>Imbued Northman Ringmail: 126 ac, 13 str, 26 wis, 26 cold. Much more focused for the shaman and a better AC. <br><br>Totemic Armor: 102 AC, 5 str, 5 sta, 5 dex, 5 agi, 5 wis, 5 int, 5 cha, 5 cold, 5 magic, 5 disease, 5 poison, 5 fire.

"Whatever.", you think. <br>Put your bigotry aside and see a life of freedom for what it is-- no more being nicey-nice to obnoxious people who pester you for SoWs and buffs.  No more being patient with idiot group members who can't handle the intricacies of group dynamics.  No more longsuffering tolerance of individuals who think they know how to run your character better than you.<br>You can reek havoc on their tiny little pinheads all the while blasting them with some well timed verbal assaults because YOU ARE A TROLL.  Noone expects you to be a good guy!  If you wanted to be sweet and lovable you should have chosen an effeminate elf paladin prancing and dancing your way through the woods spreading cheer and sunshine where 'er you go.<br>Let me say this one more time so as to leave no confusion in your lumpy question filled heads:  YOU__ARE__A__TROLL.<br><br>So go ahead, Mr. Trollman, be mean.

And soloing is easy too with pet, I can tank with him, using my Damage shield potions, regen, alacrity and fully buffed, or solo without pet using torgor's insects to pull and root and dot.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>This is my guide for begining Barbarian Shamans. I have gotten 6 different classes to between levels 10 and 15. Though this does not make me an expert, and certenly does not give me any insite into the high level game, I think it qualifies me to help newbies through the early levels. Note this is for True Newbies, though others who have never played a Barbarian Shaman my benifit from it as well. If you don't like my conclusions or suggestions say so, but don't flame, please be civil. Also this is a first, rough draft, so feel free to point out the many spelling or gramar mistakes if you wish, and any flaws you see in my logic.<br><br><br><br>Before Character Creation:<br><br>Go to <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/" target=_new>http://www.eqatlas.com/</a> and download and print the maps for everfrost and blackburrow. Also go to <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/" target=_new>http://eq.castersrealm.com/</a> and become familiar with what your spells are and what they do, and how much they cost. The maps will be a life saver to you. Blackburrow and Everfrost are very confusing Zones, Everfrost in particular as everything looks the same in the canyons. If you get lost after 4th level just gate home.<br><br><br><br>Character Creation:<br><br>Barbarian shamans have a bit of flexibulity in applying their stat points. I would reccomend putting 25 points into Wisdom, because frankly WIS is very important to a shaman, not only for mana but also for skill increases. However you *could* put 20 or less there, I just wouldn't reccomend it. That leaves you with 5 points. Casters Realm, and most other creation guides reccomend you put your remaining points in to AGL, higher agility means you avoid attacks a little better, which is important, but I think there are a few other things to think about. A shaman can wear heavy armor and will melee occasionaly, especialy at earlyer levels, so a point or two in STR couldn't hurt. DEX also helps you land blows, and learn this skill as you use it, so bringing it up to 75 is not totaly uncalled for. I personaly put 25 points in WIS, 2 points in STR, and 3 points in AGL. More becase I like nice round numbers, than any particular goal.<br><br>Should you go Agnostic or Tribunal? It's never been a question for me. The faction with the Tribunal arent too bad, and I like acting like Judge Dredd: Judge, Jury, and Exictioner, dispencing the justice of the tribunal across the land. Have fun with it.<br><br><br>The first 10 minutes:<br><br>Type /book, them memorise your spells. In the examples to follow I will assume you memorised the "minor healing" spell in slot 8 and the "burst of flame" in slot 1.<br><br>Click on the abilities button and set ability 1 (upper left) to sence heading, and ability 2 (upper right) to bind wound. Ability 3 and 4 will probably be fishing and beg.<br><br>Click on combat and set the combat loaction 7 (middle left) to slam.<br><br>Click on the socials button on the right hand side of the window. Flip over to page 2. Make the following macros:<br><br>Help!:<br>/doability 1<br>/yell<br>/g Get it off me, get it off me!<br><br>In a solo situation this will let others around you know you need help. Some will help you, such as myself, others will know to get out of the way. (especialy if you are ingaged with a vengefull.) However in a group setting it allows the others to know you are getting beat up and asks the warrior to taunt it off of you. And the /doability practices sence heading. You never need to conciously practice the skill because all the other macros include it so you paractice it just by doing what you normaly do.<br><br>Meddy:<br>/doability 1<br>/g I am gonna sit down and meditate for a bit. Let me know if I'm needed.<br>/book<br><br>This allows you to meditate, with a hot button and lets your group know whats up.<br><br>SLAM:<br>/doability 1<br>/doability 7<br><br>This allows you to slam and practice your sence heading. You might also want to put the actual slam button in your hot buttons aria so you can see when it pops.<br><br>Train:<br>/doability 1<br>/Shout I'm training %T to the guards.<br><br>or<br><br>Zone:<br>/doability 1<br>/shout I'm training %T to the zone line.<br><br>Others you may try later when you group more often, are:<br><br>OOM:<br>/doability 1<br>/g I am out of manna. ____OOM____<br><br>Heal:<br>/doability 1<br>/g Healing %T.<br>/cast 8<br><br>Slow:<br>/doability 1<br>/g Slowing %T.<br>/cast # (what ever number you have it set to.)<br><br>Root:<br>/doability 1<br>/g Rooting %T.<br>/cast #<br><br>Poison:<br>/doability 1<br>/g Poisioning %T.<br>/cast #<br><br>You get the idea. These types of hot buttons have two purposes, one is letting your group know what you are doing, so you all can work togeather well. Secondly they allow you to practice your sence heading. Other classes that get more abilities this is even more importent, but knowing which direction you are facing is always nice, especialy in EverFrost.<br><br><br><br>First 30 minutes:<br><br>Turn in your guild note to the guild mistess. She's all the way in the back. She will give you a guild tunic. It's only 2 AC so we will want to upgrade it as soon as possible, but it's a start. Talk to Cindl (in the kilt shop) and say "what mammoth hide parchment?", then got to Greta (near the kilt shop outside) and say "what ink?". Take the stuff they give you and give it to Jinkus in the shaman guild. Take what he gives you and put it in the bank. We will deal with it later. Go to Dok in Dok's Cigars. Ask him about cigars and he will eventualy give you a jar to collect honeycombs in. Give it back to him combined and he will give you an everburn candle. Not a bad light source and give a minor resist to cold attacks. Though you will just be using the jar in your bank for now to hold tiny items. Go to Waltor Felligan outside the shammy guild, tell him "I will assist in gathering fungus", he will give you a jar to collect fungus from wolly spiders in. If you fill it up and combine it, give it back to him and he will give you a 5th level spell, coins, exp, and faction. Go to Lysbith McNatt the warrior guild mistress, and tell her "I will protect the pass" she will give you a 6 slot pack to combine Ice Goblin Necklaces in. Combine it and give it back to her for faction, coins, and exp.<br><br><br><br>On to the fighting:<br><br>Equip your tunic and your club. Time to bonk some heads. Head down the ramp till you get to the monster highway. Polarbear Cubs, Decaying Skelitens, Wooly Spiderlings, Gnoll Pups, Ice Goblin Whelps, and the occasional Vengefull will walk back and forth. Heres the problem, every one of these is hostile to you. Unless they will no longer give you exp when you kill them, they will attack you if you get too close. Don't fight them out in the middle of the highway.<br><br>Stand back a little bit down the canyon twards halas and use your spell "burst of flame" to "pull" creatures to you. Beware, if there is another creature of the same type near it when you hit it, they will both come to you. You could also go right from halas and go in the next canyon down which has an Ice Goblin camp in it and pull from here. It has a wider field of view.<br><br>At first level fight decaying skelitens, at second level either stay fighting decaying skelitens or move up to goblin whelps or gnoll pups. After second level you are a match for just about anything else on a one for one basis except the Vengefulls. I still reccomend you don't start fighting Wooly Spiderlings untill 4th level or so, because though they only do it rarely they can occasionaly turn the tables on you at third.<br><br>Always wach out for the Vengefulls. Vengefull Soloist, Vengefull Lyrisyst, and one other. They look just like a Decaying Skeletin, but are way red to you untill like 9th level or so. However they are weak for their ratings, if you combine the forces of 4 or 5 newbies you could possibly hunt them for good experience. Otherwise run from them if they agro on you, shout that you are training a Vengefull to the guards, this will let everyone know to pull it off of you or to get out of the way.<br><br><br><br>Loot:<br><br>There are a lot of things that will drop off of the monsters in the newbie aria in EverFrost here is what you should do with them.<br><br>Bone Chips: Keep 'em. Put 'em in the bank. As a matter of fact buy any you see in the shops if you can afford them. They will be very usefull later on.<br><br>Ruined Bear Pelts: Sell them at first, but later they can be used to make any armor that Cindl does not give you. Combine one ruined pelt with one pattern in a sewing kit and it should give you a piece of armor if you're lucky or have high enough skill.<br><br>Low Quality Bear Pelts: Combine one of these with a silk thread in a sewing kit to get a leather padding if you are lucky or have a high enough skill.<br><br>Medium Quality Bear Pelts: Just hold on to them for now. Once you get a skinning knife (can be bought for about 5 to 10 pp) combine the knife with the pelt to get a low quality pelt and your knofe back. Then use the LQ pelt as normal.<br><br>High Quality Bear Pelts: There are rare drops but oh-so-nice. If you get one Bank it immidiately. Eventualy you may see someone advertising a need for them. Get 25 to 30 pp for each one miniumum. Otherwise hold on to them and they can be sold later.<br><br>White Polar Bear Pelts: Give them one at a time to Cindl in the kilt shop. She will give you a gold piece and a piece of tattered or patchwork armor. Sometimes she will give you a piece of rawhide instead. Not to mention she gives you a faction bonus.<br><br>Spiderling Silks: Combine 2 of these in a sewing kit to get a silk thread. Keep the thread. Also buy the silk if you find it in the shops, assuming you have the money. This is one of the componants in leather padding.<br><br>Wooly Fungus: Put it in the jar from Waltor. Combine and give it to him when filled.<br><br>Ice Goblin Necklasses: Put in pack from Lysbith untill full. Combine then return to her. Remember to tell her "I will protect the pass" again to get another pack. It's a free 6 slot back pack, great for holding bone chips once you quit brining in necklasses. Like Bone Chips and White Polarbear Skins buy them from shops if you see them.<br><br>Pcaks and Bags: From time to time, gnoll pups and Goblin Whelps. In the begining keep them all, you can't cary much without them, as time goes on keep only the 6 slot large bags and the 8 slot backpacks. Sell the rest.<br><br>Other Junk: Other things such as rusty weapons, gnoll pup scalps, spiderling eyes and legs, will drop from the newbie monsters. Just sell them.<br><br><br><br>Spells:<br><br>You should buy any spells of your own levels you can afford as you can afford them. Don't buy anything above your level yet unless you get lucky and someone buys a HQ bear pelt from you. More on this later. However practice your spell skills as much as possible. This includes summoning food and water even if it is tedious, because it increases your conjuration skill, which is used for your DoT's later. (Damage over Time)<br><br><br>After level 5:<br><br>At this point most of the stuff running around in the newbie zone is green to you, and though it may still give you experience it's not worth it except for the loot. It's time to move on. You could get a partner and camp the Gnoll guards inthe tunnel between Everfrost and Black Burrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a rather slow spawn for two people but can be a little dangerous for a single, however there is a wandering guard there that will help you with gnolls but runs away from Vengefulls, so beware is someone trains one to the zone. Or you could solo or group on the top level of black burrow.<br><br>Regardless of which one you decide to do it's time to go to Quenos. Go through the tunnel to blackburrow, bring a light. You can kill the guards on the way in or just run to the zone, but give a shout that you are training to the zone first. Once in black burrow take a left and find the zone to quenos hills. Once in quenos hills take a left and run to the quenos zone. Inside quenos find the bank, take the wanted poster out and give it to the armored guard there. Take what he gives you and put it back in the bank. After than find Voleen Bakery and tell Karn Tassen "what muffin supply" and he will give you a 10 slot box that will hold small items. Again great for holding bone chips. Put it in the bank. If you want to hunt in blackburrow I would reccomend getting bound in quenos if you can, the death run from halas to blackburrow is a real pain. If you wish to stay bound in halas make shure you have some torches in the bank. If you get bound in quenos then run back to halas and give the list from the bank to Jinkus and he gives you the Initiate Symbol of the Tribunal. If you decided to stay bound in Halas just gate back.<br><br><br><br>Initiate Symbol of the Tribunal:<br><br>LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP<br>AC: +3<br>Wis: +1<br>Mana: +3<br>Deity: The Tribunal<br>Inventory Slot: Neck<br><br>Summons: Hammer of Wrath<br>LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP<br>Damage: 6<br>Delay: 32<br>Skill: 1H Blunt<br><br><br><br>Black Burrow:<br><br>This is a dangerous zone and I died often here. So often infact that I only made it to level 6 before I decided to leave. The experience is good and you can get Patches of Gnoll Fur here, just as long as you can avoid dieing. Why this is so hard is that adds (gnolls that stroll by and decide to help out their friends) will happen about every third Gnoll you fight on the lower levels, even if you are being carefull. Otherwise trains will be flying by almost constantly, so very strong gnolls will be all over the place in large numbers. In a good group this place can be great experience, but at low levels good groups that stay togeather for long just dont seem to be too common. I reccomend hanging around and gaining level 6 here, if after that you feel you can handle the zone stay as long as you like. If you don't feel the zone is for you it's time to leave.<br><br><br><br>Gnoll Fur:<br><br>If you combine 4 patches of gnoll fur in a sewing kit you get a gnoll fur patch. (both stackable) once you combine 4 gnoll fur patches in a kit you get a gnoll fur quarter. Combine four gnoll fur quarters you get a gnoll fur bundle. Gnoll fur bundles are cloaks that can be worn by any class and any race. It gives +4AC and +5 save vs. cold. Nice for low level Int Casters, or you can use it yourself. Otherwise you can give it to Vanna MacGibbons (whom I have not found but is supposed to be in the halas bank.) and she is supposed to give you a magic dagger.<br><br><br><br>After Black Burrow:<br><br>I made the run at level 6, but you could wait untill level 9, so you can do it with Spirit of Wolf, but eather way I reccomend going to Freeport. Before you go, put anything valuable in the bank. To get there go through the zone in quenos hills (left against the wall from blackburrow or right against the wall from quenos). In western karanas hang a right and follow the wall till you hit the water. Follow the water to the left untill you zone. In north karanas continue to follow the water untill you get to the stone bridge. Continue following the water around untill you get to the wooden bridge. (beware you will have to swim around some bandits along the way.) Cross the wooden bridge. In south karanas follow the water to the right and then follow the wall to the left. Eventualy you will come to a big ravene, follow it up, be carefull around the towers as they have bandits in them. Inch around them as far away as you can, but don't fall off the wall and you will be ok. Once you zone in to highpass stay at the zone and see if someone will bind you there. If you get attacked zone back to karanas, wait a minute or two and zone back. Offer to pay a plat or two to make it worth their while and you should get a bind in no time. Make a run through highpass (you have a map right?) and then to Kithcor forest. Kithcor is DANGEROUS, period. Even walking along the left wall is not always safe, because I have seen a Decaying Knoght's Pet right up there on the wall in broad daylight. Just stay to the wall if you can and make a detour around anything hanging out on the wall. Good Luck. Once you follow the wall to the zone line you will be in west commons. In west commons make a run straight ahead from the zone. Keep along the left wall but not up on it there are orc, undead, and dervish camps there. This is a dangerous zone if you have never been here before, but if you are familiar with the zone, you can cross it with a 1st level character with little problem. Once you zone hang a right and head twards the buildings you see there. Near the buildings there will be a trail, follow it to the freeport zone line. Get a bind in freeport.<br><br><br><br>Ok, I'm in freeport, now what?:<br><br>Well you remeber those leather paddings we were making and the HQ bear pelts we were keeping? You can sell them easy in freeport or in east commons. Just send a tell that you have them and wait. Sell HQ bear pelts for 30pp. Sell a full stack of leather padding for 100pp easy. If you want you can sell them for 125pp to 150pp, but it may take a bit to find a buyer. The demand is small but significantly higher than the supply which is also very small. Once you get some cash, about 70pp to 100pp buy some armor. A smith will usualy make you banded armor at a cost of 1pp per AC. Get a full set. Then go buy a shield. I spent about 10pp on mine to get an 8AC shield.<br><br>Alternately you could head over to Kaladim first. Go to east freeport and ride the boat to the other side. Go to Kaladim by staying on the trail. Inside kaladim go to the nort zone and talk to Gunlok. Gunlok is the paladin guildmaster. (remember I said to save them) Give him four stacks of four to speed things up. He will give you Faction, an item, money, and experience. The items won't be usefull to you, so I reccomend selling them. After you give him enough bone chips to start dropping things on the ground, head over to the cleric guild you passed to get to gunloc. Sell in there. The reason is that they will use the faction that you gain from giving the chips to gunloc. It's nice because you get slightly better money for your items. I had 20 stacks of bone chips at 6th level and I got something like 30pp for selling the stuff and I got to level 9.  The cleric merchants not regard me warmly. You may ask why is this important I'll probably never go back here. The answer is simple. They sell some of the spells you need. It's nice to have a merchant that regards you warmly to buy 30pp spells from. I would reccomend using your money from selling items to purchace all the spells you can from from the clerics, then go to greater faydark to buy spells you need from the druid guild in kethlan and the enchanter guild in the high elf city. (They have serpent sight, as a barbarian, you muxst have this spell it makes things SO much easyer.)<br><br><br><br>After Freeport:<br><br>Ok, you have all the spells that you can use at this level, have a full suit of banded armor, and   a shield. Now what?<br><br>Get naked: Put all your armor, money, and stuff in the bank. Cast spirit of the wolf and run back to halas. You need to train in medditate, though this will be the last thing you will need to train for a while. Save up your points untill you find some skill that really neads a boost, or save 20 or so points to put in to alchemy when it becomes available at level 25. Buy any spells you can only get here and at Bearjumper, then gate back.<br><br>You don't have your spell skills maxed, practice them. Perhaps let people know you are buffing and will accept donations, you get a bit of money and your skills get practiced.<br><br>Once your spell skills are maxed, use your shiny new armor to solo some blues to whites (maybe yellows if you really want) to max your melee skills and get some experience. You may level a bit, and get your skills up. Then join a group. At level 10 it's easy to get a group in the dervish camps in North Ro and West Commons. Do that for a while once you get to level 13 or 14 go to the oassis of mar and fight Crocs in a group. After that, It's up to you. I don't know what to do, around level 17 or so the banded armor you have on isn't feeling so invulnerable anymore, and it's time to move on. Ask someone else, because I haven't gotten there yet.<br><br>(currently)<br>Korgish, Justicar of the Tribunal (Shaman)<br>Ayonae Ro<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Looking to see if there is an accepted rule or guideline for the casting of SoW or buffs. I have never charged for it, accepting only donations. There are some whom I have never asked for a donation, as they have helped me on the past, or gave what I thought to be an incredibly generous donation earlier.<br>     I guess my question is: Is it acceptable to NOT cast it for others? As an example, there was a level 6 monk in my zone who was always begging and pleading for SoW. I cast it for free, on several different occasions. However, one time I accidently looked at his inventory (which I normally don't like to do) and saw that he had 2 fighting batons, ability enhancing jewelry, and full cured silk armor. At 6th level. Obviously an UBER twinked character. Yet this player never once donated for spells, so I decidded to stop casting them on him, informing him of my reasons. Well, this player then proceeded to train every last thing he possibly could to me as a means of 'revenge' I guess. I finally got so tired of it that I logged off. <br>     Were my actions wrong?

Not to sound biased..but to be honest if that person trained me for such a reason I would most definatly petition him, which I have done in the past for purpose training. I know accidents happen with trains..but that sounds like a purposful train because this person has to act like a whining baby. I dont like beggars in the game I have never done as such or ever twinked. I have recieved nice items from high lvl players I guess because they are being kind or feel sorry for the little guy, but I have never asked for any items ever. Anyway enough rambling. I say if you want to sow someone do it..for donations or not. I think the only time it really is a necessity is when your in a group. The whole group should be sowed. Your group will appreciate it and will definatly invite you in again for it. <br>Well thats my 10 cps.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Am quite new to EQ, but really like the shaman class so far. The only real problem I have seen so far is the fairly useless Lore Item Cudgel. I don't understand why it doesn't continue to increase like the other class items do. The monk, necro, fighter quests all continue to increase the weapon or armor as you go along. Completing the 2nd cudgel quest doesn't even change the stats at all, just the name. Looking at its expected upgrades, I just don't see the point in trying to quest after a calss item that doesn't mprove much. What shaman in their right mind is going to keep running around with a 1hb weapon that only does 4 dam, and after the 4th upgrade, finally gets to 6? To me it just seems like an unfair set of upgrades compared to the other classes. <br><br>Please correct me if I'm wrong on this.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Is this true?<br>If I am not mistaken, I believe that a few peeps earlier on this Message board, stated that there is a Babarian merchant on a dock in Firiona Vie and another merchant in Oasis of Mar. Is this all of the locations, beside evil cities, that Narrath has to offer a "good" aligned, traveling Barbarian Shaman?

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I am always amazed when peopel say shaman can't melee.&nbsp;&nbsp;I melee when soloing and, if needed I melee in a group. Melee classes are less comon at higher lvl, and I've gone on more than one guild hunt that was only doable because I could melee.  If you want to melee as shaman you need to work to keep your skill up.<br><br>You are right, do not use your Jade Chokdais Prod, get your self a good 2hb weapon.  By the upper 30's a JCP just dosent do enough damage.  <br><br>Also use your buffs, noone has better melee buffs than a shaman.  <br><br>IMHO kiting is not the best way for a shaman to kill.  Sure you can do it, but by doing it you do not keep your melee skills up.  Your dots only do 75% of there normal damage if your target is moving.  Kitting is a limited ability anyway.  There are limited places you can do it.  <br><br>Here is how I recomend you solo your shaman.  Cast Str, agi, dex on yourself.  Pull the mob with solw, dot the mob and beat it to death.  <br><br>When you get regen and speed cast these on yourself as well.  <br><br>When you get your pet buff it with str, dex and speed.  <br><br>I've gotten a number of nice items because I could solo the mob while staying in one place.<br><br>Keep your 2hb skill maxed.  A JCP is a very nice weapon until lvl 34 or so.  A mortificators staff is as good as the JCP.  A rune wood great staff is much better than a JCP, but what about the wisdom?  A JCP and a CGS at lvl 50 will give you 100 more mana points?  What are you going to cast with 100 mana points at lvl 50?  The damage done by a good 2hb is worth more than 100 mana points<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

However, once you hit a certain point, which can vary with you play style, you are better off meditating *when you are grouped*.<br><br>The damage output by a Shaman Melee wise at higher levels is not even worth mentioning.  Sure, with a big 2h blunt you can occasionally get a solid hit in.  As long as the situation is under control, and you are topped out on mana (which, IMO should almost never happen, will explain in a second), go ahead and stand up and whack that nasty a few times.  But I am seldom anywhere near FM.<br><br>Between buffing everyone, regenning the tanks, slowing the mobs, root parking extras, emergency healing, and all of the little things a shaman should be doing, a lot of times, the only time I stand up is to buff/cannabilize/heal =)  In this situation, every 6 seconds I am standing, is one less tick of mana I get back to continue casting.<br><br>If you have the situation in hand, meleeing is fun, and can be helpful.  It is also generally VERY low on aggro for us =)  Personally, if I want damage output though, I will cast a DoT and stay out of the way.  Or, if you prefer, that is what our pet is for.<br><br>As to the merits of a 2h blunt vs 1h plus a shield, do not forget the armor class.  Just as a clarification, a JCP+CGS at 50 is 150 more mana.  I use a JCP+Shield of Falsehood.  Yes it is less wisdom, but it is more ac.  If you can crack the ac barriers of 800, 900, etc without a shield, then pull out the big 2h blunt when you decide to fight.  Otherwise go for the AC.  It really helps when you get summoned after having two slows resisted, and you have to cast a third on the same mob.  Getting Quadded for 220 on an unslowed mob can hurt, really fast =)<br><br>Both ways have their merit, and neither is wrong.  IMO, having a shield and medditating outweighs the value of our melee after about level 40.  Keeping the skills up is a good idea though.  Nothing is more embarassing than getting attacked by a low green, and having to nuke it because you can't hit it.  And a maxed defense skill is a wonderful thing to have.<br><br>Gorthin Spiritcaller<br>51 Shaman BB<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>For the most part I agree with what you are saying, as long as by grouped you mean in a full well balanced group.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even at lvl 48, I sometimes find myself in a group with only one tank.  Here is my rule for wheather to melee or not.  1 tank I melee, 2 tanks I might melee depending on what other classes are in the group and the lvl and class of the tanks.  3 tanks I do not melee.  <br><br>However with all do respect Gorthin, for I think you are one of the more enlightend spear toters, I don't think you understand the POWER of the 2HB.  Lets look at an example shaman who equiped with a CGS and a JCP has wis 175, AC 805.  Equiped with a Drakkel Icegrinder they would have Wis 160 and AC about 795.  The first has 8% more mana and 1 or 2% (sorry of the top of my head I don't know how much more actual ac you get from a +10 ac item) more ac.  However the seconed one will do 38% more damage, not including proc and str bonus.  When it is time to melee there is no way that 2% ac and 8% wis is going to match 38% more damage.  The fact is i can solo mobs with a 2hb that i can not solo with a one hand weapon and shild.  <br>You said that "the damage output by a shaman Melee wise at higher levels is not even worth mentioning", you also said that if you want damage output I will cast a dot.  From personal experance before lvl 49 there is not a dot you can cast that will consistantly out damage my Icegrinder.  You cast your dot and need to med to regain the mana used.  I could melee and do as much damage and still be FM.  I have also read that in groups most shaman will not cast the lvl 49 poision dot because of the amount of mana it uses, they also choos to cast the lower dot while grouped.  <br><br>From my expeance at higher lvls shaman can do meaningful damage meleeing, but only if they use a 2hb.  In a full, well balanced group casting a dot or meleeing with a 2hb will have about the same impact, but meding and casting is the expected behavor of a shaman.  But there are times in small groups or in unbalanced groups that it would be far better for the shaman to melee than to sit on his dark ember and watch the tank take a beating.  <br><br>The shaman is born a melee class and with each lvl becomes more and more a caster, and perhaps at some point becomes only a caster.  If this happens I don't know what lvl it happens at, but I am sure it doesn't happen before lvl 50.  Yes most of the power of the shaman comes from his spells, but the best shaman spell are for melee classes.  The shaman's magic lets him melee solo better than any other class.  <br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hey, alright, a civil discussion.&nbsp;&nbsp;I like that =)  I am glad you mentioned you vary your tactics depending on group makeup.  You would be suprised how man people do not.<br><br>I am not going to try to throw numbers out at you.  But let me point out as what I see as a couple of fallacies with yours.<br><br>The first is the magical 800 AC spot.  Learn it, love it, NEVER go below it if you can help it in anyway.  I was amazed how much of a difference damage wise I took by breaking 800 AC.  If you are 5 ac points away from cracking 800 AC, lose some wisdom (or get a shield *wink*) to break that barrier.  I do not use a shield for the mana per se.  I use it for the AC.  I do not have any hard numbers, but 795 AC vs 800 AC = approx a 20% damage difference received IMO.  It is absolutely insane how much less damage you take.<br><br>Your damage output melee wise will be higher than mine, sure.  But let me explain why I do not think it will matter.<br><br>Here is a typical setup.  Talisman for the Chanter, Cleric, main tank.  General buffs (usually stamina and strength, sometimes dex and agi) on tanks.  Sometimes speed on the tanks (if no chanter *shudder*).  Chloro the Chanter (every little bit helps) and main tanks.  Over the course of that, I have used, let's say, 60m.  We med, I Can/Chloro til around  70m to 80m, we charge in.<br><br>Fight breaks out.  I slow primary mob.  Chanter mezzes.  I slow secondary mob, chanter mezzes.  I slow tertiary mob.  I then root both additional mobs.  I sit and med.  Do an emergency heal.  Med some more.  Reroot third mob, and reslow.  Med.  We win *cheer*  I am at 45 to 50m (250 mana for a slow hurts...),sometime higher.  I proceed to canna/med.  Cleric is 60m+, so puller goes.  I slow, med.  Monster usually dies about the same time I manage to regain the slow mana.  In fact, the only time I get ahead is with C2, and chloro/canna.  Otherwise I break even.<br><br>Does that sound fairly realistic to you?  I hope so, otherwise the rest of my point won;t work =).  When am I gonna get time to melee?  As I melee, I fall further and further behind in the mana race, and that is not good.  If I fall too far behind by not managing my time wisely, I slow the group down.  And unless they are your friends, you will get booted.  Xp grind groups SUCK.  They are boring.  When you have to wait  on the Shaman to get mana back to do his job on top of it....  Or if you don't wait, and the Chanter croaks, game over.<br><br>That is why I do not melee.  Shaman are some of the most mana intensive casters over the course of a group.  Those buffs and all add up.<br><br>If you just want damage, sure, go for a 2h blunt.  Just make sure you fight the rogue for the backside of the mob =)  But if you want overall group efficiency, let your buffs and your pet do the damage for you.  It is not a matter that you can do as much damage with a weapon, it is keeping up with the mana curve.<br><br>Remember, these are my opinions, and I hope I clarified why I do not melee, at least not often.<br><br>Gorthin Spiritcaller<br>51 Shaman BB Maxed offense, pierce, and defense =)<br>Aka, I don't mind melee at all.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>In that group and with 3 mobs being pulled at a time I wouldn't melee either.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I agree Xp grind groups suck, that is why for the most part I avoid them.  <br><br>My experiance with the magical 800 AC has not been all that impressive.  I have an ac 15 shield I got off some giant in GD and a Dark Ember I use to keep my 1hb skill up.  With the Shield I am AC 811 with out it 796, or there about.  (I made the effort to get to AC 800 after reading some of your earily posts.)  Now the Dark Ember is a better melee weapon than the JCP. However I can kill mobs while using the Drakkel Icegrinder and while below 800AC that I can not kill using the Dark Ember and shild while above 800 AC. My weapons skill are nearly the same. I am willing to accept that 800 is a magical number, however My experiance indacates that the extra damage output you get from the Icegrinder more than makes up for any loss of mana or ac.  <br><br>Yes in the Xp grind groups, in groups chain pulling or pulling mutipul mobs you need to med, and there is little opertunity to melee. <br>I personaly don't spend much time in zones where this type of grouping is the norm.  And being a member of a guild that is low on tanks at the upper lvls I frequently tank on some of the guild hunts.  <br><br>For me the shaman is able to fill many roles, and shouldn't be limited to only a caster.  Yes there is a time and a place for casting and there is a time and place for melee.  The secret to sucess is knowing when to do which and being able to do both.  I have 4 or 5 items I carry with me and wear or hold to switch between melee and mana mode, or anywhere inbetween.  <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

So drops, and the likes are a reason also. I don't know about your server, but on mine you will ALWAYS find belts for sale. Going rate on the Rathe is 2pp each.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Before you condemn folks hunting in the lower lvl dungeons, ask them WHY they are hunting there.&nbsp;&nbsp;CB and Blackburrows are zones that are frequently hunted by inappropriate lvls to obtain faction.  The best way for a dark race to get Qeynos faction is to hunt in Blackburrows.  Kill kill kill gnolls (till they are quite sick of them in fact), and collect gnoll fangs.  Once they kill enough to where they are "dubious" to Qeynos guards, they go on into town to turn in the fangs for even more faction.  Highpass is another area frequently hunted by higher lvls in order to get faction with the Freeport Militia.<br><br>It's not ALWAYS about exp, but rather the faction gained by hunting in these zones.  Believe me when I say that higher lvl players hunting in these zones for faction are not there having a good time.  Faction hunting is a time-consuming pain in the behind, and boring at best.  (also mention here that players hunting for faction should select "off times" for their little ventures...times of the day when noobs aren't out in force).<br><br>Now, as for the higher lvl players who insist on taking out the noobs' mobs without good reason, bah on them.  I agree that if you don't need the faction, and if you don't get exp for it, then you should be moving on to something that does.<br><br>(I won't go into farming/loot here.  Suffice it to say, the alchemist was green to me at lvl 48, and dammit, I needed that cloak.  So I killed it)<br>&nbsp;<br>Badjur<br>54 Barbarian Shaman (Druzzil Ro)<br><br>Aepox Weeblatter<br>35 Dwarf Warrior</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Long ago when I was a true newbie I was I think level 6 then I was getting to know EverFrost, and was exploring a few places well one day it was getting dark so I decided to get back to Halas a higher level warrior came and I asked him to help me get back, the story I'm telling u now might not be accurate as the incident that occured since it was a long time ago. Well anyways while I was following him I get attacked by an Orc Mountaineer and he was unable to save me due to him not being able to find me, so I died. Well I was a newbie then and being a newbie I thought full leather armor and 1 piece of enchanted jewelry was the best. So I went looking for my corpse by myself, as I was trying to explore I found Permafrost first thing I did was enter the zone hehe a guy in there told me to get out of there and hunt in BB well he was like level 16 and I was only level 6 I started healing him and it was amazing I healed him to nearly full hp which then I realized my amazing ability to be a shaman. So taking his advice I got out of there but when I got out an Ice Giant spawned which sucks Ice Giant Hits U for 146 damage He hits u for 131 etc I died. Now knowing my way I went back to permafrost but stayed outside well a high level group was there hunting Ice Giants and I again being a newbie thought having a levitation would keep me from getting hit lol. Well the Dark Elf Mage in the group gave me a ultravision necklace and a levitate ring so I use levitate and go searching for my 1st corpse and o the shaman in the group casted Talisman on me and sow,so I went searching for my corpse WOOHHHOOOO I found it finally hehe well I tried to put it on as fast as i can and 2 leopards attack me well I run with the armor which I had on, heh keep reading, Suddenly I start running right well 1 orc and 2 leopards chase me and I thought maybe I could hide in the tower they wont know I'm there hehe I was wrong well I keep running and I hit another tower I sit camp and boom an orc hits u for 22 dmg I think, I'm getting really angry by now so I keep running with sow as I'm running u can add another 2 Orcs aggroing on me I keep running another 3 Orcs by now there are 6 orcs and 2 leopards after me hehe doesnt stop there I keep running u can keep adding orcs at that time I didnt know I was so close to a guard well I keep running suddenly 13 Orcs and 2 Leopards circle me a Orc Shaman must have rooted me. I had Talisman on so I lasted a while and I was level 6 I should have GATED I know but I was too focused on knowing to die then gating so u can guess what happened when 13 Orcs and 2 Leopards keep hitting me I eventually died.Ok this time I know I needed some help with high levels well I zone to BB and ask for help luckily a level I believe 20 warrior was in there a half elf female warrior in close to full crafted armor. She was kind enough to help me I forgot about her afterwards but n e ways as were looking for my corpse we find a warrior he was a dwarf forgot what level though and also a level 9 shaman who became a good friend. Well she casted sow on everyone and we head off looking for my corpse. I remember she asked was there any good items on it and I said yeah hehe newbie prespective. Well we hit permafrost and I'm trying to reclaim my steps I asked them if they could hunt Ice Giants lol newbie prespective again. Ok so the little dwarf tries to be brave and said Ice Giants cant beat sow so he goes and gets an Ice Giant and runs for his life luckily he was able to zone into permafrost. Well one of my corpse was where an Ice Giant spawned so I said forget about that. Well as I'm reclaiming my steps I told them the incident hehe trying to hide in the tower from the Orcs thinking they couldnt find me lol well we spotted one of my corpse yes I know I should have use location b4 I died again I was a newbie.As we move further on we find another of my corpse and of course my 3rd corpse near the Ice Giant Spawned rotted away. I thanked everyone and the shaman her name was Windz we became good friend as for the rest we sorta forgot about the incident. We said are good byes and I got back to Halas. O one more thing I gave Windz the levitate ring and she said it disappeared when she logged off I found out it was No Rent a while after. Well thats one of my stories as a newbie.<br><br>Level28 Barbarian Shaman<br>Aerodin Czaran<br>Quit EQ for about 6 months now but might be coming back.<br><br>P.S.

One major drawback is that I seem to experience a lot of lag in Firiona Vie. It's probably my antique computer that's slowing me down, so when I sight a Drachnid, even if a am running with Scale of Wolf, they catch me and Boom- I'm dead. I can't even cast gate cause they hit me so fast.<br>Any ideas?- Ohyeah, I'm working on my Totemic Armor quest right now, but I only have a few components so I'm open to suggestions.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>LOIO is a very nice zone.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are wanting to hunt here instead of trying somewhere else, here is what I would suggest.  Buy the Invisibility spell beforehand, stuff it in a backpack.  Stock up on food and water (fill a backpack or two), then make the trip to LOIO.  Bind at the FV zoneline, and stay until you hit 29.  If you find youself running out of food/water, just summon what you need.  I know it is tedious, but it will remove the need to travel back to FV.  Of course, this will require selective banking (aka avoiding heavy stuff).<br><br>You may also want to ask about a Camo/Invis from someone before you leave FV.  Most people are willing to do it if asked politely.  Taking the underground tunnel that surfaces near the Dreadlands tunnels is also a good idea, as it is closer to the Lazke zoneline.<br><br>One last general hint.  If you haven't already, turn down your clip plane.  This will help the preformence of older machines/video cards and can help avoid the lag/framerate choppiness.<br><br>Gorthin Spiritcaller<br>51 Shaman BB<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Hunt Baobob and Chanda Miller,the faction hits are with the Karana Residents,Knights of Thunder,and Qeynos Guards. <br>2. Solo or group treants in West Karana or South Karana. Good money and exp bad faction hits but it takes a long time for your faction to go down.<br>3.Tesch Mas Gnolls in South Karana Spires or in Infected Paw. Solo if u can get a spire, group if u wanna go in the dungeon.<br><br>Well there u go,I'm currently not playing EQ stopped for about 6 months now I might come back, my highest level character was a level28 barbarian shaman named Aerodin Czaran,hope the info helps hehe some shamans say level20-34 are the best times for the shaman that is if u know where to hunt.O one more thing hunting the Miller's is really fun if u ignore the faction hits. Last night in EQ was hunting Miller's<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I need people to put up really funny stories, and i have a good one.<br>I was inn Lake of ill omen and was pking with two full groups opf darkies. We owned the zone. When we were leaving, a halfling warrior ran past me, I was encumbered from carrying 40pp from pking so much. i had 3pp in copper and 4pp in silver. The warrior out ran me, even though i had SOW. He asked me if he was faster than me and i said yes. He came back and started taunting me, so i dropped the silver and copper, rooted him, dot'ed him, nuked him, then kited him like an animal. then he shouted, gave my position, and level, and since i was near the windmill i hauled it. Then i get back to FOB, i go LD, and i log back on, and a group of lighties is attacking kurns, and i log in when they are in front of me, it took them 10 minutes to kill me, in that time i took down four (two were lvl 14, one was 17, and one was 18) and seriously injured another SK before the wizzy and druid found me and nuked before i could heal.<br><br>One more, While i was Pking in LOIO, there was an enchater hitting me while i was oom, and they had a harm shield from a ranger, who was in range, but couldn't kill me because we were too close toa group of sarnak and goblins in. So a erudite shadow knight comes by, asks me for a sow, and since i couldn't kill the enchanter myself, i made a deal with him that i would sow him, if he killed the enchanter, he did so, then the ranger that was rouped with the enchanter started fighting the sk, then the sk died, so the ranger decided to make me leave by putting a sarnak knight on me. (we were next to the FM zone)So the ranger grabs a sarnak knight, is coming right for me, and he trains me and is about to zone when i rooted him. I moved along as fast as i could, but the root wore of before the ranger died. I decided to go to cabilis before anyone else came by, But the fact is, i got two lighties killed without actually fighting, and one severly beaten.<br><br>I have one more story that is actually funny, but you have to beg me to tell it. PUSBAG, I BETTER HEAR SOME STORIES.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;                 Rekron, always nice and(usually)the evil, evil, evil iksar shaman ( I do parties also :p)<br><br>&nbsp;<br>rekron, 24 iksar shaman<br>tallon zek<br>rakra, 10 iksar warrior<br>tallon zek</td></tr>
