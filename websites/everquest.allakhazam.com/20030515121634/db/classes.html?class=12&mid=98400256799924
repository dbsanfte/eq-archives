	   <tr><td colspan=2>Its hard to say the top five soloing classes. In my mind there is a top 7 to the soloing classes.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#8217;s a bit too hard to put into a top 5.<br><br>In no particular order, here are the 7 classes that I think are the best soloers:<br><br>Bards<br>Necromancers<br>Magicians<br>Enchanters<br>Druids<br>Shaman<br>Wizards<br><br>Now all of these classes start becoming good soloers at different levels and they also gain/lose power throughout the levels. Although once you get to about level 50, soloing for any class isn't very effective. Here are some more in-depth descriptions of these 7 soloing classes, and also how I rated them. The rating I gave them was based on their overall soling ability from levels 1 to 50. So just because one class can solo better than another class at a certain level, it doesn't mean that they are overall a better soloer.<br><br>1. Necromancers - This really isn't much of a surprise. Necromancers are extremely strong soloers from level 1 all the way up to 50. They simply have all the right stuff: snares, fears, pets, extremely mana efficient DoT's, very good mana regen, and several ways to escape from death. Necromancers are surpassed by a couple of other classes at certain levels and in certain situations as far as soloing goes, but overall they are simply the best at it.<br><br>2. Bards - This one might surprise a lot of people. At lower levels bards can melee well and then have very little downtime afterwards because of their healing song. At the lower-mid levels bards can kite nearly as well as a druid, and then have no downtime afterwards since their songs take no mana. Then starting at level 27 bards become VERY good soloers, because of their charm spell. It takes practice, but I have seen bards do wondrous things with it. Charm a mob and then send it after another mob, re-charming as needed. Once the mob you charmed has killed off the target, it will be at low life, and you can kite it around and kill it quickly. Once it is all said and done you have killed two things and can start right over again since you didn't need to use mana to do it.<br><br>3. Magicians - This one isn't too hard to figure out. Magicians have extremely good pets and nice direct damage spells, along with great damage shields. These abilities give a magician the power to kill things just as well as a necromancer. However, magicians have no mana regaining spells. Plus, magicians have almost no way to escape from death if their pet dies. The only two ways are gate and strafe-running, both of which can fail all too easily. However, don't let that bring you down. Magicians ARE good soloers or else I wouldn't have put them as number 3. <br><br><br>4. Enchanters - The soloing arts of the enchanter are quite different from that of the other classes. However, they can do it well if they so wish, using their wide variety of tactical approaches. The first way for the enchanter to solo is to use their pets, debuffs, and damage spells. They buff up their pet, engage an enemy using a resistance debuff, and back up and cast DD's and DoT's on the mobs. The DD's of the enchanter are mana efficient after using a form of tashan, however they have a long recast time and a huge taunt factor. The DoT's of the enchanter are very mana efficient and have a small debuff effect in them, however the DoT's enchanters get are spread out pretty far in-bewteen the levels, so they get new versions later. The pets of the enchanter are fairly weak. They can deal out decent damage, however they tank very poorly and can not be commanded like other pets. This tactic works best during the lower and mid levels. <br>     The other way of an enchanter soloing is to use their charm spells at a dual-spawn to charm one mob, and then kill the other one. After the non-charmed mob is dead, the charmed one will be at low life, so the enchanter can finish it off with a DD or two. The other way of using charm is to charm a mob that is extremely overpowered for its level, and kill tons of low blue cons with it. You need to have sow to do this however. Also, this tactic doesn't work until an enchanter gets their higher level forms of charm. The level 12 one simply doesn't work very well.  These two tactics alone aren't what make the enchanter a good soloer, however. In addition to these tactic enchanters have many ways to escape from death and good mana regening spells to cut down on downtime.<br><br>5. Druids - As yes the druids. Good direct damage spells, good damage over time spells, wonderful damage shields, roots, snares, harmony, heals, and movement increasing spells. Druids can solo quite well. At lower levels druids can buff themselves up, kill something with melee and damage spells, and then heal themselves afterwards. Once they get to the higher levels, they start using different tactics. The first, and most common, is to snare a mob, and then run around using one of their movement enhancing spells, and casting direct damage spells along the way. This tactic allows a druid to kill thing risk-free. The other tactic is rooting a mob, and then casting DoT's on it, and meditating while it is rooted. This version is a little harder, because you have to re-root the mob every so often, but it works well also. In addition to these things druids also get the harmony spell which allows them to solo entire camps by themselves.  Plus, on top of all that, druids get teleportation spells which actually makes them a little better as soloers, because they can get to new hunting spots faster.<br>     What is the downside? Well druids have no mana regen spells (except at level 60, but that doesn't really count) and the way in which the kill things is not quite as efficient as how a magician or necromancer would. This makes the druid have more downtime than the other classes listed about them. However, because of snare and sow/wolfform, they are virtually unkillable because they can just run to the zone before something can kill them. Also, another version of druid soloing is to snare 4 mobs, and then run around and cast AoE damage spells on them. While this way is very mana efficient, it takes a long time to not only get down right, but to also perform. Not to mention that it is fairly risky and incurs a HUGE downtime.<br><br>6. Shaman - Shaman are pretty good soloers. They have powerful DoT's, good de-buffs, all right DD's, heal spells, pets (at higher levels, and only weak ones), mana regen spells, and SOW. At lower levels a shaman can buff themselves up and then debuff an enemy and use DoT's and melee to kill it. If anything goes wrong they can outrun the enemy using their sow spell. This works fairly well, but it isn't nearly as good as what other classes can do. Shamans really don't become really good soloers until level 34, which is when they their first pet. Even though the pet is weak, it DOES do extra damage and lets the shaman tank less, because the pet can take some hits.      <br>     Before shaman get their pet they can use the same soloing tactics as a druid (root/DoT or kite with DD's). Shaman are not as good as a druid though because their root spell isn't nearly as good, and they don't have a snare spell to help them kite. However, at 24, they DO get a mana regen spell, although it is not as good as the ones of the necromancer or enchanter. Pretty much, before shaman get their pets, they are all right soloers. After they get their pets, they are good soloers. <br><br>7. Wizards - The last in the line of the top 7 soloers. Before level 29 a wizard can do good soloing if they have sow. With sow, their powerful direct damage spells allow them to run around and kill an enemy with a good mana efficiency. However, wizards can't cast sow, so there are sometime problems with getting it. Also, since they don't get a snare spell before level 29, it takes them more running-around time to kill an enemy. Also, wizards have no form of mana regen before level 34 and don't have many good ways to escape death.<br>    Now once wizards get to level 29 everything changes. They get a snare spell at this level which allows them to kite better, because they won&#8217;t have to run as much. Also, once wizards get their snare spell, they can start quad-kiting as druids do, except they can do it BETTER than druids because of more mana efficient area effect damage spells. Although since wizards don&#8217;t have sow, they have to get it from other classes or by buying sow potions. Sow isn&#8217;t actually a necessity for quad-kiting, but it is VERY helpful. Of course, quad-kiting is quite risky, can only be done in certain spots, and has a LOT of downtime. However, at level 34 wizards get a mana regen spell that helps out a bit. It isn&#8217;t nearly as good as the enchanter or necromancer mana regens, or even as good as the shaman mama regen, but it does help. Also, like druids wizards have teleportation spells which helps them get to new hunting spots quicker.<br><br>Everything I have written is simply my opinion, so take it as you will.  Also, just because I listed one class as a better soloer than another class, it doesn&#8217;t mean that they solo A LOT better, or that they are better soloers at EVERY level.  The ratings I gave the classes were how well they soloed OVERALL from 1 to 50.  For example, someone might say that a level 34 wizard solos better than a druid because they have a mana regen spell and a much better direct damage spell. That would be true, however think about the wizard before level 29. Druids were better soloers at those levels, so they had a higher cumulative rating. Also, please remember that these are the best soloing classes in the game. Just because I gave the necromancer a 1 rating, and the druid a 5 rating, it doesn&#8217;t mean that the necromancer is WAY better than the druid and that druid sucks at soloing. The differences in soloing levels between each rating is VERY minor. For example, even though a magician got a 3 rating, and the shaman got a 6, it doesn&#8217;t mean that the magician is some god compared to the shaman. Also take note that I have NOT played the wizard and druid classes up to a decent level, and what I wrote about them was simply what I have seen and heard about from friends. So please remember all of these important details.<br><br>I hope you enjoyed my post. If you don&#8217;t agree with me then at least you had the satisfaction of being amused by what I thought.

If you are doing that, then you are missing out on a huge part of the game. Try making friend, grouping with friends, roleplaying, dueling, and exploring an new area WITHOUT a map off of the internet. I think you will find the game much more enjoyable if you do.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>
