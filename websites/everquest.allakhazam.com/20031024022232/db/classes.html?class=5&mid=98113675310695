You will die a few times doing this, but some will prefer dying a couple of times to spending 12 levels in Cazic hunting for decayed.  I would do this at higher levels (32-35) while waiting for a group.<br><br>The Shadowknight and Solo Crusader Killing<br><br>If you are a shadowknight between the levels of 25 and 35, you are probably thinking about lizardman crusaders a lot.  They are the bane of the mid-level shadowknight's existence.  Not only are they a rare spawn, but they are fairly tough which makes soloing one a tall order.  Compounding the problem is the fact that everybody and their mother seems to be farming decayed these days.  One solution is to hunt crusaders solo, but this can be an extremely dangerous idea.<br><br>These ideas apply mostly to level 30+ shadowknights.  If you are under level 30, you won't have gather shadows or feign death and probably won't be doing much crusader hunting anyway.  The 30+ SK however, can invis and roam all over cazic searching out the crusaders.  But, what do you do if you find one?<br><br>Crusader soloing is possible for the 31+ SK.  How do I know?  Because I have done it at level 31.  First off, most guides will tell you that crusaders are level 31 to 33.  I am pretty certain that they are 30 to 33, because the first one I soloed was at 31, and conned blue to me.  Soloing crusaders is possible in a few places in cazic.  The temple floor and archon are probably the easiest.  This is because there are many places where you can sequester that crusader away from other lizards while you kill him.  Second best place is the planks.  This is a little tougher, but still possible.  The last place is the aof room, below the bubble.  This is only possible if the crusader spawns as the roamer who patrols from the green bubble to the door at the top of the ramp.  The one popular crusader spawn where this will not work, is the AOF Temple Top, above the silver guards.  There are just too many lizards there to isolate the crusader.<br><br>Most people get so caught up in thinking about the crusader's ability to harm touch that they forget about the other aspect of the shadowknight mob...spells.  I have read many posts concerning crusaders and some of them point out that crusaders don't typically cast spells other than HT.  This has not been my experience.  I have fought plenty of crusaders, and a lot of them cast spells.  This might be because I have soloed a bunch of them.  At any rate, they seem to cast fear the most often, then darkness the next most frequently.  I have even had a couple cast heat blood on me.  The point here, is that you might want to dig up some of your magic resist gear if you are planning on hunting crusaders alone.  I can say with confidence that if a crusader gets fear to stick on you, you are not going to win the fight.  You will probably have much bigger problems than the crusader if this happens.  Having said that, let's take a look at some of the soloing spots.<br><br>Spawn 1 - Temple Floor/Archon Temple<br><br>There is only real possibility for soloing crusaders here.  The roamer.  These would be the ones on the floor who run around the temple or on each level of the pyramid.  With these, it is just a matter of patience...waiting for the roamer to reach the ideal spot before you pull the trigger.  If a crusader spawns in one of the corners, you can try to FD pull to separate the two lizards.  This will usually entail taking a painful harm touch though.  The crusader that pops as one of the pairs of corner static spawns would have to be split from his cohort lizard.  This can be done with a feign pull, but you would almost certainly lose too many HP during the pull to be able to solo him once he is separated (unless you are level 40+).  It is probably a tad safer to solo on the temple levels.  This is because there are fewer spawns on each level (2-3) and less chance of having another lizard jump into the fight.<br><br>Spawn 2 - The Planks<br><br>The same principle applies here.  The crusaders will be roamers, traversing the planks from pond to pond.  Do not engage anywhere on the planks, unless you know the pond is devoid of alligators.  The alligators will aggro you if they are present.  Spend a few minutes getting to know the patrol pattern.  The best way I have found is to wait until the other lizards have headed the other way.  Then wait until the crusader enters the little tunnel between ponds.  When he gets to the tunnel, zap him.  You should have just enough time to finish him off before another lizard comes back.<br><br>Spawn 3 - AOF Room<br><br>Some people consider this part of the planks, or vice-versa, but I will treat it as a separate spawn when soloing.  Here, the candidate crusader will be in the AOF room, patrolling the area between the bubble and the room at the top of the ramp.  Set up camp in this room.  Note that there will usually be another lizard who patrols from the first pond, into the room and back.  Observe him and get his timing down.  The ideal time to strike is when this lizard has just left the room and, the crusader has reached the top of the ramp just on the other side of the door.  If things go smoothly, you will have enough time to kill the crusader or at least get him to HT range before the other patrolling lizard comes back.<br><br>The Recipe for Killing<br><br>So, I have given you an idea of what crusaders to kill, and when to strike.  Now we get to how to strike.  Keep in mind that preparations must be fast!  You won't have lots of time to fool around.  Always be invised when scouting the crusader areas.  Obviously, you will be aggroed by everything if you are not.  First, have a pet spell memmed.  Not the best pet...this takes too much mana.  A lower level pet is fine.  When you think the time is right, target the crusader, then raise the pet just out of aggro range from the crusader*.  While the pet spell is in progress, type "/pet kill", or better yet, have it hot keyed.  When the pet is up, hit "enter" or the hot key to send the pet after the crusader.  While the pet is engaging, back up as far as you can, given the circumstances, and cast engulfing darkness (just after the pet has reached the crusader!).  Hopefully this will stick.  Then cast heat blood.  By now, the pet should have taken the HT (note: sometimes the crusader will not HT the pet until he has taken a couple hits) and the crusader will be charging you.  Now, melee the crusader.  This shouldn't be too hard, just don't panic if you think you are losing the fight.  Between heat blood and darkness, you should do about 300 dmg.  When you add the dmg from HT, that should account for about half the crusaders HP.  When the crusader is about down to almost a bubble, HT him then refresh darkness to prevent him from running (or vice-versa...use your judgement!).  Try to conserve mana during the fight as you may need it to feign death if things don't go as planned.  Don't get anxious!  If a lizard shows up as the fight is ending, kill the crusader and feign death.  Wait until the interloper is gone before you loot.  If another lizard does not show up, it might be prudent to immediately invis, then look around to make sure it is safe to loot.  Remember, you have 2 minutes before anyone else can loot.<br><br>This strategy has worked for me a number of times (at least 6 solo and tandem kills).  It is not foolproof though.  For this reason, I always save HT for when I know that I have succeeded.  Why?  Because if things go wrong, and you have to feign, you may have another shot at the crusader, in which case you will definitely need HT.  If another lizard shows up, particularly a healer, abort   and feign.  There is no way you can win if a healer shows up (unless you are level 40+).  I had a crusader down to a half a bub in the room above AOF when a judicator roamed in and healed him.  I then went OOM and was killed on that occasion.<br><br>A word about feigning.  If things go badly, find a good place to feign.  Don't feign near the corners on TF or in the middle of the planks.  Ideally, you can FD somewhere where you will be relatively safe, and can keep an eye on the crusader and his health bar.  If you are going to re-engage, you can't wait too long...they regenerate HP quickly.  Also, be aware that if you do re-engage the crusader, he may HT again.<br><br>This strategy is good to employ when you can't find a group, or everyone you group with wants to roll for the decayed.  You don't need that farming cleric to defeat a crusader, and he sure as hell is not going to be able to solo one himself.  This is not something for the fainthearted, as you will die occasionally, maybe even frequently.  However, the prospect of having all the decayed to yourself is tempting.  It's hard to beat the feeling you get when you kill one of these guys solo and he drops that decayed breastplate you need!  One last note, this strategy works doubly well with two SKs working together!<br><br>Hope this helps!  If anyone has any comments or questions I am on the Rathe server.<br><br>Orthogonon Angainor<br>DESK<br>The Rathe<br><br>* Keep in mind that you will not be invised once you bring the pet up, so make sure you are out of aggro range of anything that might attack.<br></p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

Also try to get a few levels...doing this at 31 is risky.  Find your target, use every offensive spell you have except Fear and just start beating it away. Don't waste time with a pet as it takes way too long to summon one and it's worthless anyways..unless you're around 49 and 52. So there's my two cents</p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

It is sort of a paradox...you really can't defeat a crusader at 31-33 if you take the HT yourself, thus the pet is necessary.  At higher levels, when the pet is actually useful, the necessity to have the pet take the HT is less.<br><br>ortho&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>
