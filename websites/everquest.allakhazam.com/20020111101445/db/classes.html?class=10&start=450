	   <tr><td colspan=2>Tolan's Breastplate & Greaves? You must be joking. These pieces are so rare and difficult to obtain you must be extremely loaded. I can't say I completely agree with twinking but a little bit doesn't hurt.<br><br>First thing is, you don't get dual wiled until level 17 but I'd recommend the following weapons. For 1HS use a Lamentation (9/19) in your main hand and a CSS (12/24) in your off hand. There are not many twinkable 1HS weapons with a ratio of under 2 but if you really have the resources, a Swiftblade of Zek (11/18) would go nicely in your main hand and an Edge of the Nightwalker (14/25) would be ideal for your off hand. All of these items have nice stat bonuses but while the first 2 are commonly available and cost around 8K each, the latter 2 are very rare and will cost maybe 50K each. Personally, I wouldn't use the Wurmy but a really good twink weapon is the Venomous Axe of the Velium Brood, Ratio is 11/24 with some AC but it has a nice 85DD proc that starts from Lvl 1, which is a really rare feature. For a piercing weapon, the Lupine Dagger (9/18) is probably ideal.<br><br>For armor, I would go for a Sebilite Scale Tunic (AC22) and Greaves (AC16) with other pieces being Ry'Gorr and a Hero Bracer. If you want better stuff, use a Barbed Ringmail Chest (AC30) and Greaves (25AC) with Crystal Chitin Arms (AC18) & Gauntlets (20AC) and a Silver Chitin Wristband (AC15). Needless to say, the Barbed Ringmail and CC stuff goes for 10-20K a piece.<br><br>In terms of stats, it depends what type of race you start with. Wood elves have naturally high agility etc. The Hero Bracer is cheap (800pp) and gives you 9 str while a Cloak of Shadows will give you 13 dex. You also get agility and strengh buffs by the time you are lvl 30 so I wouldn't worry too much. A good weapon to get your dex up (by 20!) is the Glowing Black Sword (3K). The ratio is not great (9/22) but it looks cool and is a lot better than what most people have until maybe lvl 40 or so :P. As a twink, you also don't need to worry about the bad proc until you get to level 46.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Aye, all those you have mentioned are good.  There is also something you should have for your face slot.  I believe it's called a Platinum Ruby Veil  which has +7 Str and +7 Wis.  This is good to have.  Orc Fang Necklace is good.  <br><br>With regards to dual wield, I have the Icetooth's claws and a Dragon Horn Ykesha.  This is extremely effective with a Haste buff or the FBSS.  Plus you get the Call of Sky spell at 39 which seems to proc quite often.<br><br>Since you have a decent agility buff, and a decent str buff I would concentrate on Dex and Wis items.  Believe it or not, wisdom is very important to Rangers... they cast more than you think.<br><br>Check out the Orc Impaler quest as well.  It's a spear that goes in the ranged slot - it gives you extra stats: +3 Str, +4 Wis, +10 HP.<br>&nbsp;<br>Attilaterre Bayle<br>Ranger of 49 Seasons<br>Destiny's Revenge<br>Vazaelle<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Nice suggestions. Allow me to modify them a bit tho...<br><br>Orc Impaler is No Drop. So forget about it. Nice medium range face slot item is a Dented Brass Mask from Perma. Not hard to get, decent face stats till you can get your hands on something better. For Dual WEild, my recommendation has to go to a Wurmie/Giant Militia Combo for controlling agro and dealing nice damage. Be prepared to have STA adds to get you over 100, tho, so you can still swing in a long fight. Get a Dragon Horn for solo work tho, cause it is a nice add for damage.<br><br>I also like the Ebony Bladed Sword. Nice and quick, with a useful proc that will help you solo with your bow. Melee till root, back up and shoot arrows at it and snare, heal if needed, rinse and repeat.  At the moment I am using the current Wurm/GML combo in groups. They love me.<br><br>For 2handed, try a Runic Carver or a Crystallized Two-Handed Sword. The RC has great delay with decent damage, and the CTS does GREAT damage.<br><br>For stats, concentrate on Dex and Str, with a bit of Wis.  Dex will help your proc and Archery immensely.<br><br>Good luck!<br>&nbsp;<br>Domnall Phyrestorme<br>Dark Moon Rising<br>51 Pathfinder of Tunare / Saryrn Server</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>OK, you Shadow Step. Big Deal. With my 200 range bow and my 150 range arrows, your SS doesn't take you near far enough to be out of range of my arrows. And while you are waiting for the spell to recharge, I am running up on your snared butt with SoW.<br><br>If you want to go Invisible to try to evade me, I have see invis. So I still have a target lock and can track you, so I know exactly what direction to turn and find you.  Not to mention you just lost your best DoT, known coloquially as your Pet. The only way you can stop my tracking is if you ZONE. That is it. Because you sure as hell can't cover cover enough distance in the zone to be out of range before I am all over you like white on rice. As for your MR, BIG DEAL. I'll snare you eventually. <br><br>I can also heal myself of the damage done by your DoTs.  What have you got to heal yourself of the damage done by my DoT and arrows? Lifetap series? You have to get close enough. With you Snared and me SoW'd and firing long range arrows, I don't think so.<br><br>As for Melee, if you want to use your Cleaver, that is Fine. I will break out my Swarmcaller. You get hit, you get 42% slowed. Once you are slowed, I break out my 1-handers and proceed to cut you into little tiny pieces, cause your FBSS ain't JACK after that. On the Ratio scale, my Swarmie ain't but 4 weapons lower than your Cleaver. That includes ALL classes weapons.<br><br>OR, I will just root you, run you out of mana and loose pointy shafts of death downrange at you. My weapons may not be as hefty as yours, but I guarantee you I have more arrows than you have mana or patience to run around (snared) after me. What in Tunare's name makes you think I am gonna let you get close enough to me to use that nasty thing?<br><br>You use your strengths, and I will use mine. The bottom line is that You can't own me if I do my thing right, and the same goes for me owning you. We have our own strengths, and those differences add up to one thing.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hello all,<br><br>Now before i start another huge war, I am here to say I have both characters. I like both characters, just because of the different ways i have to play.<br><br> On the SK side i usually pull with a tap or debuff str or darkness, and begin melee then back away after taking some damage to lifetap and cast fear and my pet and I go to bashin it like crazy, after about 2 or 3 mobs i usually run out of mana and half to med to be at full performance. As for harm touch, it is a Life vs. death use only so i hardly use it unless i get adds or trained, so in a way it is useless most of the time, and it is magic based so when you get higher lvls i have had it get resisted alot. Now i love the way i look in plate armor being a human. and i am a fan of 1hs myself but practice 2hs for the SK only weapons and epic, as if i will ever get it. The few probs i have with my SK is finding mobs in large areas and having to run everywhere slowly (i hate asking for sows and such all the time). The fact that we cant heal does make for alot of downtime after battles with whites and yellows. ( when most of your spells start getting resisted). and i love duel wield which we dont get and why I use 1hs for the bash, the stun effect makes feared mobs alot easier to hit. As for the good use of haveing that pet. it does cause aot of probs when ou are trying to heal and med and a green attacks your pet to interupt it all and in most cases kills your pet as well. the usefullness of the pet is to send him in while you run in death cases before feign death or you forgot to mem it or save mana for it. In most cases I like my SK, he is supposed to be the most offensive class in the game, everything is about damage, and debuffs.<br><br>Now on to my ranger, his abilities are what make him cool to play: track, forage, sneak, hide, able to cast all the different types of spells DoT, DD, root, Snare, buffs, heal, Sow, Dam Shield, the guy gots it all, and with all hybrids they are not as good as pure casters but neither is any other hybrid. <br>He gets all the different melee off. and def. type skills: kick, duel wield, double attack, riposte, and his bow is a site to see first hand indeed. I have been at low health meding and  get attacked with my ranger and instead of running(as i would with my Sk) I snared the mob and ran back and started blasting it with arrows, I crit 3 times for about 45 each, kept up the back track and fire while trying to get as much hp and mana as possible, did a couple of heals and a damage shield and went in for the kill. ahh even if it did not work i still had sow to head for the zone. i hardly ever to go town to anymore except to train skills or buy more archery supplys to raise skills. Now about the armor thing as i mentioned above aobut plate looking cool on my SK, its just the rangers style not to wear loud and clumbersome plate sneaking up on your unsuspected prey, that makes the game a better roleplay for me, YES, it is not as good as plate with the lower ac and such but your the scout, the one who everyone follows while tracking prey and checking out mobs to pull, before you send in the army of eager warriors in to attack, Because in alot of groups i have been in, if a bad pull kills alot of group memebers the blame will fall to your side on pulling to many.<br><br>Now I dont know much of the math with the weapons, armor, caps for skils, but I put out alot more damage when playing with my warrior friend who is a 2h axe lover(this might be why). and i have seen some rogues as well and they are useless if no backstab, usually someone, me, has to keep the mob off them. now monks make great pullers with feign death and can put out some damage, but i have seen some serious health drops when they put in to much damage also,(no metal type armor at all) now on the high end when skills start caping for everyone(I have not gotten there yet and alot of people wont get there very fast anyway) it might all change, they get more hps and ac but no way to heal, or in SK case has to fight to get hp back and still is a lost cause because your getting beat up while you do it. and then no mana. <br><br>All classes have weaknesses and advantages, that is not really the point, because in some way they are all balanced with certain skills and abilities that make then useful. YOU need to find one that fits your style of play or yourself in my case, and being an evil on top of evil(as i call it) class such as an SK does not fit to my personality. I like to hunt in the swamps after trolls with my ranger much better, more purpose, excitement, hunting your prey instead of waiting for it to spawn again. hehe, just for all you other classes when you are camping orcs, goblins or whatever and have to wait in line because you cant find anything else.<br><br>Now to end this i like rangers much better than SK because of reasons i have mentioned above, but i tried to give an idea about both characters.<br><br>In short, if you want to be a ranger, get ready for a thinking game, a true type of roleplay(for me). use your skills to the max, with your lower hp and ac, start with a snare and the bow with DDs, then go in for the kill, if it is not working root and back up for more range attacks, while you heal and then go at that mob again, unless you run into some really bad luck, you will defeat that mob(I am not saying go after those ultra red ones either its suicide).<br><br>Good Hunting fellow ranger, maybe we will see each other in the swamps, but i cover my tracks very well. hehehe<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>First off, all this nonsense about Rangers sucking is making my blood boil. I can't say from personal experience that any other class is better or even worse for that matter, but it is all just personal preference on what class you would like to play. I guess when some people finally realize this, which is only wishful thinking, we will all be better off.<br><br>Secondly, and I am speaking from experience on this, Rangers rule up to at least 34 in the soloing department. Why? Well fellow Rangers, all you have to do is goto Everfrost at level 21 and begin hunting mammoths for the next 13 levels of your EQ life. Boring you may say, but no group necessary and the BEST LOOT available for anyone at that level IMO.  I made at least 3k in my time there off the tusks alone. Rangers will have the heads up on anyone else hunting them, and are basically untouchable when snare and fear animal work right off. 1 bub of mana and 1 bub of health if all goes well in a battle. At 30 it gets even better with the added spells and you can shread through the mammoths like a hot knife through butter, so even though experience isn't as good as once was, you kill at much faster rate making up for xp lost.  Also, I need to mention that EF is the best place to get HQ Bear Skins. All the newbies there sell for cheap and you can make a hefty profit from the 10 slot backpacks you make, provided you work up tailoring skill. Another 3k from those, give or take. Well worth it IMO.<br><br>Lastly, and I can't believe more Rangers don't harp on this also. The reason they can solo so effectively is because of TRACK!!! I can't imagine how it is even possible without it! I had a Rogue at 15, and there was NO WAY I could solo with him like my Ranger. And it wasn't because he was weaker then my Ranger, it was because it took me 10 times (maybe exaggerating, but not much) longer to find a MOB to fight. Not to mention that a Ranger Track sorts by distance and gives you the mob's level, allowing you to find MOB's close and within your level to fight. TRACK is terribly underrated, at least in this forum it seems, because I can tell you without it I would be completely lost. All in all, TRACK has spoiled me, I don't even like playing my Rogue now because he can't TRACK! Like my Druid friend once said...who has a 54 SK btw..."A whole new world opens up to you when you have TRACK." HEH, and he doesn't even have the Ranger's TRACK.<br><br>Remember, this was all written by a 35 Ranger who has solo'd his whole life and will continue until ABSOLUTELY NOT POSSIBLE. My Rogue has been into a few too many, HMMMM...how should I say, AWFUL Orc Groups to even want to try with my Ranger, anyway why would I with track at my disposal. :) So with that said, I have no clue on what it is like to be at 50+ or even 40, but I have heard you can solo Rangers into mid and upper 40's. By that time I have a feeling I won't be playing much more, as it as taken me a year to get to 35. I am not one of the hardcore players that play 4 or 5 hours a day. Maybe in a week I do that. Anyways, to all that say a Ranger sucks and is not worth playing, think that some do not play to get to 60 and have all the greatest weapons, but to have fun and roleplay a little. To not play a class because it will be weak and bottom of the barrel when it reaches 50, that seems awfully foolish to me. And that is if what the Ranger bashers say is true, which i don't even believe. To 35, I'd be willing to bet there is not much of a faster and profitable route then what I listed above, and you can do it all on your own time. Up to 35, I can honestly say that I feel Rangers are even par with all other classes, if not a cut above. :) I'm sure as I progress I will keep believing that, and I hope this helps all people thinking of starting a Ranger, to stick with that thought and go for it. <br><br>Just SHOWING A LITTLE LUV FOR ALL THE RANGERS.<br><br>Oh yeah, Kildiar must think this is the RANGER'S BLOW ASS Forum and not the Rangers Strategy Guide Forum. As much as he uses the word ass in his totally offbase posts, you have to worry for the man, or boy..... Do you prefer chocolate syrup or jello when you toss salad Kildiar???<br><br> <br><br> <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>*Sigh* This battle will never end. Those of you who believe with all your heart that "rangerz sux" are entitled to your opinion... as poorly grounded as it is. Rangers are a pure strategy class, and require a good player to master them. If you are impatient, inexperienced, and lack a certain amount of foolhardiness, you will most likely think rangers are not a good class. A good player will take what thier class has and make it work for him or her. A bad one will most likely post a poorly based opinion here, and go on to be another card carrying member of the I Hate Rangers Brigade. This really holds true for any class. Oh well. Your loss. Hey, everyone is entitled to play the game the way they enjoy it, right? However, you shouldn't bash people, exclude them from groups or from raids just because they play a class you don't understand and have been unable to master. <br><br>It's true that rangers have some severe disadvantages. The way I see it, that makes it all the more challenging. My first and still primary is a ranger. A half elf of all things. I've played every other class since, to at least level 20. I very much enjoy my necro. I love my bard. I adore my little gnome chanter. My monk has soloed much better than I ever expected her to. In the end, my true love is still my ranger. At each level, she was able to do far more and had much more hunting options than any class I have ever played. Where rangers have disadvantages, they make up for it tenfold in thier abilities... if you're willing to take the time to learn what a ranger is truly capable of. <br>Rangers are masters of agro control. If you take the time to practice, you will be in control of who is getting hit in your party at all times. In outdoor groups, they are excellent in strategic pulling... harmony is a very good asset to a group, and if a ranger is in charge of keeping the mobs sitting happily on thier butts or bumbling about snared, the druid has more time and mana to focus on damage and healing. Enchanters are the undisputed masters of shutdown, pre or post agro, but it's a lot easier to keep the mobs from agroing in the first place than to quiet them down once they've started attacking, and takes some of the burden off the main mezzer so they can take care of multiple targets and wandering adds. Also, rangers stand among druids, necros, and mages in thier ability to solo. Well into the mid fourties, and possibly longer. Quad kiting may be out of the question, but in the mid levels, whites, yellows and even some reds aren't a problem. The opening of Stonebrunt Mountains has given rangers a virtual paradise to play in, if you can swallow the thought of killing endangered species (Fortunatly they don't share that opinion about you). Hunting and medding in the middle of nowhere isn't a problem for a ranger.<br><br>Finally, and most importantly, for all of you who would tell me how much rangers "suck" and are a "worthless class", just remember that next time you spend hours wandering a zone looking for a rare spawn. If I had a copper for every time I get tells "can u track this 4 me plz", (even from druids and bards) I'd be a rich ranger indeed. With all due respect, druids come nowhere close to even a young ranger in the ability to locate mobs.<br><br>Good luck and good hunting to you all, no matter what class you play.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

This is why we get the Jolt and Cinder Jolt spells. Im not sure about you guys, but in MY groups, we usually have around 3 melees. But, why would a group want a Warrior as a secondary tank, when they could have a Ranger? I dont know. The Warrior has HP. We dont. The Warrior gets hit. We try not to. But, our melee is the same. So, with all I have said, is the Warrior better? Yes. But, I havent said a thing about spells.<br>We cant tank, but we give that up for spells. Not sure with other Rangers, but I find myself using DoTs, nuking between slashes, snaring, fearing the animals, buffing myself (I only use SoW, Firefist and Strength of Earth, beacause I dont count on being hit.), SoWing, healing during downtime, and if theres not someone that can buff stats, I do that.<br>Wow, if someone like that got as much HP as a paladin do you think they would be overpowered?

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I am a level 35 Ranger without alternates.  From firsthand experience, I can readily testify that up to the 40s (when our defense stops increasing) Rangers hang with all classes and are probably overpowered.  First, we tank nearly as well as a warrior (somewhat worse because we are a chainmail class and have less HP, somewhat better because we hold agro with spells).  Second, we have excellent damage.  Third, we have the ability to track, which is an early warning system, a spawn seeker, and exploration tool all rolled into one.  Finally, we bring a lot of utility to the table with our spells.  We have SoWing, snaring, healing, fearing, invis, and powerful pull spells like Harmony.  Binding, rezzing and ports are the only major spell abilities we do not have.  We even have some crowd control abilities with root.<br><br>Now as I said I do not have any direct experience with the 40+ game.  However, I have read quite a bit about it and can relate my understandings on the subject.<br><br>1.  Rangers remain damage dealers.  By design , we have sacrificed the defense and armor of warriors for spells and abilities like Track, Forage and Hide.  However our weapon caps are the same as a warrior's.  Since we can also cast spells and have the immense damage-dealing capacity of the Trueshot discipline, we are basically a lock for outdamaging warriors.  This is in spite of the warrior's ability to crit and land crippling blows.<br><br>The generally accepted table of damage dealing at these levels is:<br><br>Rogues (backstabbing):  200%<br>Monks/Rangers:  105%<br>Warriors:  100%<br>SKs/Pallies/non-BSing Rogues:  below 100%<br><br>Since SKs seem to be a popular topic here, SKs have instead sacrificed damage output for their spells and utility (FD, for example), and maintain high warrior-like defense.  It seems to me that, at least in this aspect, SKs and Pallies have it worse off in the end game than Rangers.  Quite simply, damage stacks but you only need one or two tanks so Pallies and SKs are more likely to be useless.  Moreover, for certain uber mobs you need a tank that has the Warrior defensive disciplines, which Pallies and SKs do not get.  I am not trying to claim that SKs suck or Rangers are better than SKs, however this is one aspect to consider when comparing the classes in the end game.<br><br>By the way, someone just posted SKs outdamages all the hybrids.  This is ludicrous.  It has been repeatedly shown that dual wielding handily outdamages two-handed attacks across the board.  Also, SKs have inferior caps in weapon skills and offense.  Just setting the record straight, there.<br><br>2.  Rangers become poor tanks, but they are given agro-reducers to compensate:  specifically, Jolt at 51 and Cinder Jolt at 55.  These spells are fast casts, cost a modest amount of mana, and used intelligently allow Rangers to maintain their high damage output without exposing themselves to a mob's wrath.  In this sense the Ranger is similiar to the Rogue with his Instill Doubt, and the Monk with his FD.<br><br>3.  Rangers are useful in the end game.  The big problem with Rangers for a time, that probably gave them such a bad rap, is that Jolt was broken.  It took too long to cast, and we got it at 55 instead of 51.  High damage + no evasion = lots of dead Rangers.<br><br>Now a smart Ranger who knows he is not a tank is a valuable addition to any end game group, from an XP group to an uber mob raid.  He will bring a lot of damage to the table, at least as much as a warrior...and unlike pure casters such as the wizzie, Ranger damage is melee-based and thus un-resistable.<br><br>Unique Ranger spells are easily overlooked but they bring plenty of value to a high-end Ranger.  Want a 26 AC, +4 DS buff that stacks with nearly anything?  Go find your local friendly Pathfinder and ask him for Call of the Earth.  How about a 40 ATK group buff?  A Warder can hook you up with a Call Of the Predator.  I believe Strength of Nature (+25 ATK, +75 HP) is another Ranger-only buff.<br><br>The final reason why a Ranger should be always desirable in the end-game is the weaponshield discipline.  This grants 15 seconds of immunity to melee attacks to a Warder.  This means that a guild will want all the Warders it can get, because each represents another 15 seconds of being able to tank anything essentially damage-free.<br><br>So, there is the positive side of the Ranger class in a nutshell.  Ironically, I don't even mean this to convince others to play a Ranger.  Hell, I love my Ranger, and if there are only a handful on a server I'll be quite happy with that.  Ultimately, play who you like and learn to play it well.  The classes may not be perfectly balanced, but they are balanced enough that any class can be a valuable addition to a team as well as fun to play.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

No chance to solo though cuz they cannot heal or do any form of kiteing.<br><br>Warrior: Undesputedly  the  best tankers  they get the best ac hp and chance to do melee dmg. However  i was unable to solo one past lvl 8 wich really sucks.<br><br>Wisdom Casters: for the most part  they can all kite cept for the cleric who roots+nukes they can all solo pretty well and can wear good armor (druids are the best here)<br><br>Inteligence casters: Mages and Wizzys can downright opwn an opponent by nukein him and mages get pets :).

Remember though, that you will only be able to hit for max 29 damage (until lvl 20, when your damage cap comes off.)<br><br>Bloodstained fangs (30-50pp) aren't great weapons at all, but they are cheap :) and for your level they'll do nicely.<br><br>My lvl 25 Ranger uses Ice Tooth Claws in his main hand and a Bloodstained Fang (9/32, piercing) in his off hand.  He also alternates these weapons with a Drakkel-forged Bastard Sword to keep that skill up.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>After following this thread for quite some time, I feel the need to voice my opinions on the subject of rangers.  I feel they are very underpowered and unbalanced.  I will elaborate on what makes them underpowered later in this post.  I also believe I should state that I have a level 52 ranger, so the things I say are not said out of malice or jealousy.  They are from experience.  I first started playing my ranger when the game first came out.  At that time, rangers were one of the best classes in the game.  They had the same defense as warriors, and they could wear the best armor in the game (rubicite), and use the best weapons in the game (short sword of ykesha).  In addition, they could can several versatile spells that were inaccessible to other melees.  Those were the good old days, when rangers were actually a valid class.  However, after the release of Kunark, rangers have slowly and steadily gotten the shaft, time and time again.  Let me explain my reasoning.<br><br>Issue 1) Tanking Ability<br><br>A ranger&#8217;s tanking ability is laughable.  They can&#8217;t even tank as well as a rogue, let alone a warrior.  Here are a few numbers to prove my point.<br><br>Defense<br>Warrior: 252<br>Rogue: 252<br>Ranger: 200<br>Ranger-Rogue Deficit: 52 points<br><br>Dodge<br>Warrior: 175<br>Rogue: 210<br>Ranger: 170<br>Ranger-Rogue Deficit: 40 points<br><br>Parry<br>Warrior: 230<br>Rogue: 230<br>Ranger: 220<br>Ranger-Rogue Deficit: 10 points<br><br>Riposte<br>Warrior: 225<br>Rogue: 225<br>Ranger: 150<br>Ranger-Rogue Deficit: 75 points<br><br>Raw AC granted from full suit of Kunark armor<br>(Cobalt, Mrylokar&#8217;s, and Tolan&#8217;s respectively)<br>Warrior: 220<br>Rogue: 155<br>Ranger: 155<br>Ranger-Rogue Deficit: Even<br><br>The warrior numbers are posted just as a reference, I wouldn&#8217;t expect a ranger to tank as well as a warrior, but I&#8217;m sure that these numbers clearly show how utterly horrible a ranger&#8217;s tanking ability is.  A rogue is clearly a superior tank, having a higher defense, and higher dodge/parry/riposte skill caps.  Another point that I should mention is that I am comparing them to a rogue, who isn&#8217;t even suppose to be tanking in the first place.<br>Finally, I was conducting some tests, comparing a ranger to a warrior in tanking ability.  I would attack a single monster, and drag it to a zone line.  I then just let it attack me until I was near death, and then I would zone.  I did this a number of times, and timed how long it took the creature to work me down, then averaged out the times.  I repeated this test with a warrior friend of mine, just to see the difference.  The warrior lasted 3 times longer than I did.  Meaning that the monster would have killed me 3 times over before it would have killed the warrior.  While I understand that a ranger is not supposed to be as good of a tank as a warrior, this seems ridiculous.  A ranger is little more than a speed bump as far as tanking ability is concerned.<br><br>Issue 2) Damage Output<br><br>Well, I was willing to let forget the idea of being a tank, besides, rangers have excellent damage out put right?  Not quite.  A ranger&#8217;s damage output is yet another thing which has fallen by the wayside.  While the patch some time ago raised their offensive skill caps to that of the other melees, it was of little help due to the fact that the other classes simply get better weapons/skills.  A monk or a rogue can easily surpass the damage output of a ranger.  It isn&#8217;t even a contest.  A rogue with double backstab can do unbelievable amounts of damage, as well as having a better weapon selection than a ranger.  The monk with his epic or a runed fighter&#8217;s staff easily out damages a ranger.  And actually, a monk without his epic, using just his bare fists will out damage a ranger unless the rangers has weapons of epic quality or better.  This seems sadly inadequate.  Here are a few numbers to illustrate my point.<br><br>Rogue:<br>Locustlure: 8/17 (35% atk spd decrease proc)<br>Sebilite Croaking Dirk: 10/18<br>Bloodpoint: 10/21 (80 dmg lifetap proc)<br>Ragebringer(epic): 15/25 (40% haste, 40 atk, 9 ac proc)<br><br>Monk:<br>Runed Fighter&#8217;s Staff: 19/20<br>Imbued Fighter&#8217;s Staff: 38/40<br>Fists(no epic, lvl 50): 14/28 (I think, not sure exactly)<br>Fists(epic): 9/16 (clickable 40% haste)<br><br>Ranger:<br>Lupine Dagger: 9/18 (Greater Wolf Form proc)<br>Fayguard Parrying Dagger: 9/17 (29 AE dmg proc)<br>Earthcaller: 14/24 (500dmg 20/tick dot proc)<br>Swiftwind: 13/21 (40% haste, 30 atk proc)<br><br>Issue 3) Utility<br><br>	Even after I realized that I was completely inferior in both tanking and damage dealing ability, I still had hope for my ranger.  I could still do things out of combat that those other melees couldn&#8217;t.  When they took that away from me, it was the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back so to speak.  I stripped down my ranger and sold everything off to start up a warrior.  I just couldn&#8217;t believe what has happened to rangers with the release of Kunark/Velious.  All of the ranger&#8217;s utilitarian spells, which made him a cut above the rest of the other melees are now castable by anybody with the appropriate gear!  Clickable effects on items emulate almost all of a ranger&#8217;s spells.  Here are the most glaring examples.<br><br>Spirit of Wolf:  Journeyman&#8217;s Boots/Traveler&#8217;s Boots<br>Healing/Invigor: Cobalt Breastplate<br>See Invisibility:  Bracer of the Hidden<br>Strength of Earth: Cobalt Boots<br>Invisibility: Cobalt Greaves<br>Infravision: Glowing Stone Band/Cobalt Helm<br>Chloroplast: Fungi Tunic<br>Root: Crystaline Silk Net<br><br><br>The list goes on, but I will not bore you with the details.  I might also add that all of those effects are mana free, where as the ranger has to spend mana to cast his spells.<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>Well, I just don&#8217;t know what else to say.  Rangers can&#8217;t tank as well as others, can&#8217;t deal damage as well as others, and don&#8217;t really have any unique utility to them due to new gear.  Verant has always stated that a class doesn&#8217;t have to be the best at something to be balanced, there just has to be a compelling reason to play the class.  The only problem is, there absolutely NO reason to play a ranger when they are completely and totally outclassed by the other melees.<br>	<br>	If this article keeps even one person from making a ranger, then the time I spent writing it will not be in vein.   It will keep someone from spending weeks upon weeks of played time building up a character just to have his or her hopes shattered.  Moaning mournfully as the cold, hard reality sets in upon them, that they have just wasted months of time building up a ranger.  That all of the time they spent would have been better off playing something other than what I consider to be the absolute weakest class in the game.<br><br>Pire Ashwood 52 Ranger<br>Tarew Marr<br>Born: March 16, 1999<br>Died: September 10, 2001<br>May he rest in peace...<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Good point of the numbers side of the defensive skills.  I do agree that there should be no way a rogue has that much of a differential in defensive skills.  The only thing I could see is the Rogue having a higher Dodge, and the Ranger having a higher Riposte and Parry.  Defense should cap at the same point.<br><br>As to weapons, just go pick up Primal/Priceless if you want to compare endgame weapons.  It all evens out there.  I won't compare the Epics.  Whoever designed them didn't have a clue (Ragebringer is &gt;ungodly&lt; powerful compared to how hard it is to get).<br><br>For damage output, it would be more fair to compare a monk vs a ranger.  Both are designed as "anywhere damage". Ranger, using spells, will outdamage any other melee, except for the backstabbing Rogue of course, when everyone has comparable weapons.  Look at the parsing/logs of the higher level guilds out there.  A double backstabbing Rogue will clean any melee's clock damage output wise.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>There are a few problems with some of your points.  I will reply on a point by point basis.<br><br>"As to weapons, just go pick up Primal/Priceless if you want to compare endgame weapons. It all evens out there. I won't compare the Epics. "<br><br>While it is correct that in the end, everybody will be using primal/priceless weapons, the fact remains that a primal/priceless in the hands of anybody else will do more damage.

Especially the point about a ranger using spells outdamaging any other melee with the exception of rogues.  A ranger's damaging spells will be outright resisted on any high level mob.  Once you take their damage spells out of the equation, what do they become?<br><br>"As to "Ranger's" spells being castable by "anyone" with the proper gear? Let's see.

A warrior, in my opinion, has the least utility out of any class, they are purely focused on melee.  However, with proper gear, they have the exact same utility spells as a ranger.  That was the point I was trying to make.  And as to the casting times on the items, the cobalt breastplate takes about 13 seconds to cast a 100 point heal.  A ranger takes about 3 seconds to cast a 90 point heal, but then has to med for about 30 seconds to get the mana back.  So who actually is winning this deal?  Finally, you do not have to be in an uber guild in order to get cobalt.  My warrior has a few pieces, and I am not in an uber guild.  Admittedly the breastplate and leggings might be rather difficult to come by, but I can just make due with a fungi tunic and bandages.<br><br>"Rangers need work at the HIGH END GAME. So did Rogues.

They don't do damage, they can't tank, and their utility is negated due to gear.  Please, if you see anything useful about the ranger, post it.<br><br>"*sigh* Why suddenly do these people develop the "desire" to keep others from "spending weeks and weeks" on a supposidly useless character?"<br><br>Because I would not want anybody to endure the pain I had to go through of watching their character develop, just to realize that their character is inferior in every way to the other classes.<br><br>"While this was a well written post (unlike a lot that show up here), and it had some valid points, I fail to believe anyone in the gaming community really cares what other people play.

I believe that if enough people would stop playing rangers.  That perhaps it will motivate Verant to finally examine rangers, and do something to help this poor, underpowered class.<br>And hes, I do have a vendetta against rangers.  I spent about 48 days of played time building up a ranger to level 52.  And now I realize that I just wasted my time building up the weakest class in the game.  I honestly can't see any reason to play a ranger, other than wanting to challenge of playing an inferior class.<br><br>As for possible fixes to the class.  I really don't know what can pull rangers out of the hole Verant has dug them.  Here are a few things that might help.<br><br>1) Raise defense cap to 230.<br>2) Raise dodge/parry/riposte caps.<br>3) Add some sort of self only haste spell.  This would help to bring their damage output in line with the other melees on high level encounters.<br>4) Add a new "Call of X" spell that makes their weapons proc 50 unresistable damage.<br>5) Add regeneration at level 39.  They already get chloroplast at level 55, but for some reason, they never get regeneration?  Seems weird to me.<br>6) Add strength of stone at level 39.  Again, they already get storm strength at level 53, but somehow, they never get strength of stone?<br>7) Lower jolt to level 39.  This is the level that a ranger's defense caps out.  At this level they really need to be staying out of combat, and controling their aggro.<br><br>Other than that, I don't know.  They have already given away the ranger's utility, which my favorite part of the class.  But these changes would bring a ranger up in tanking ability to just below that of a rogue, and would put them ahead of most melees in damage output.  But even with all those changes, I still don't thing I could be willing to pick up and play a ranger again.  If anybody else has some suggestions, I would like to hear them :)<br><br>Pire Ashwood 52 Ranger <br>Tarew Marr <br>Born: March 16, 1999 <br>Died: September 10, 2001 <br>May he rest in peace... <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Excellent.  I am &gt;so&lt; glad this did not turn into a flame war/733t skillz war.  Let me respond to what I see as wrong with your post =)<br><br>"While it is correct that in the end, everybody will be using primal/priceless weapons, the fact remains that a primal/priceless in the hands of anybody else will do more damage. A rogue with a priceless spear will WAY outdamage a ranger, and a warrior with critical hits will outdamage a ranger as well. "<br><br>Unless the Rogue has a higher cap on Dual wield, there is no way a &gt;&gt;non backstabbing rogue&lt;&lt; will out melee a Ranger.  They are equal, and once the Ranger does a little self buffing, he should come out ahead.  Backstab skews everything out of whack.  Even with crits, the Warrior will NOT outdamage the Ranger.  Why?  Defensive Disc.  That is the main reason a Warrior is the tank of choice (and sometimes the only choice) for high end encounters.  Losing 30%+ of your damage output will keep them from outdamaging a Ranger.<br><br>"In the end game, this simply isn't true. Especially the point about a ranger using spells outdamaging any other melee with the exception of rogues. A ranger's damaging spells will be outright resisted on any high level mob. Once you take their damage spells out of the equation, what do they become?"<br><br>But you can't take them out of the equation.  Between a Druid using Ro's, the Enchanter Tashing, and the Shaman/Magician Maloing, you can get spells to stick quite nicely.  For some reason, Calefaction is a beast to resist from what I have seen.  Yes, it has a long delay, but it is a "free" 450 damage.  If you manage to remove the spells, then sure, Rangers would be inadequate.  But in a balanced group, Ranger nukes work just fine with a little debuffing.  Everyone has resist problems (except for Lures from Wizzies), that is why Verant made debuffs.<br><br>"I was specificly things that a warrior can use against a ranger's spells, perhaps I should have made that more clear. A warrior, in my opinion, has the least utility out of any class, they are purely focused on melee. However, with proper gear, they have the exact same utility spells as a ranger. That was the point I was trying to make. And as to the casting times on the items, the cobalt breastplate takes about 13 seconds to cast a 100 point heal. A ranger takes about 3 seconds to cast a 90 point heal, but then has to med for about 30 seconds to get the mana back. So who actually is winning this deal? Finally, you do not have to be in an uber guild in order to get cobalt. My warrior has a few pieces, and I am not in an uber guild. Admittedly the breastplate and leggings might be rather difficult to come by, but I can just make due with a fungi tunic and bandages"<br><br>Like I said, Cobolt Legs and BP are the ones you need the "Uber" guild for.  Other cobolt is pricey, but common.  Noone denies Verant screwed up giving warriors spells like that.  That was one balancing feature:  They were dependent on others for magical support.  As to the Invigor right click vs casting Healing, it all depends.  In those 13 seconds, a Ranger can cure 360 damage vs 100.  Yes it eats mana, but it just depends on if you need it or not. It also ties you up for those 13 seconds to get the effect.  That can be bad. Fungi Tunic should not be warrior wearable IMO =)  But yes, with Kunark armor, Rogues and Warriors received some right click abilities they should not have gotten.  Nothing we can do about it now, though.<br><br>"Because I would not want anybody to endure the pain I had to go through of watching their character develop, just to realize that their character is inferior in every way to the other classes"<br><br>We will just have to agree to disagree here.  I do not feel Rangers are inferior in everyway.  Sure, they have some weak points, but properly played in a balanced group, they are killing machines.  VErant still claims this is a group game, so you have to gear yourself that way to get maximum results.<br><br>"1) Raise defense cap to 230. <br>2) Raise dodge/parry/riposte caps. <br>3) Add some sort of self only haste spell. This would help to bring their damage output in line with the other melees on high level encounters. <br>4) Add a new "Call of X" spell that makes their weapons proc 50 unresistable damage. <br>5) Add regeneration at level 39. They already get chloroplast at level 55, but for some reason, they never get regeneration? Seems weird to me. <br>6) Add strength of stone at level 39. Again, they already get storm strength at level 53, but somehow, they never get strength of stone? <br>7) Lower jolt to level 39. This is the level that a ranger's defense caps out. At this level they really need to be staying out of combat, and controling their aggro. "<br><br>#1 and #2) I agree with raising the defense cap to at least 225 (no higher than 240), but leave Dodge alone.  Raise parry and riposte to the cap.  Rogues got way too much, and they left the ranger behind on this.<br><br>#3)Swiftwind gives a 40% haste. And most of the time you will either have a Chanter or Shaman to Haste you.  Not to mention a Bard to stack in song haste.  I don't see this one helping any.<br><br>#4)  Call of Sky adds a 35+ a stun proc.  Call of Fire adds a 75 proc.  These are in the game.  Call of Sky is borderline unresistable.  So they kind of already have this.  And Sky procs a buttload for me.<br><br>#5) Druids get Regen at 34, so for a Ranger instead of 39, 49 would be more in line I do think.  Would be a nice bonus, but something to save the class.<br><br>#6) Almost exactly the same as #5, down to the levels =)<br><br>#7)I honestly do not think jolt needs to be lowered in level.  Everyone caps defense at 40 except for pure INT casters.  The problem is 50+, not 1-50.  Aggro control is the key.  And in this case means proper weapon selection, avoiding the taunt button, and know which spells to cast when.<br><br>Honestly, to make Rangers more in line where they should be vs Warriors and Rogues would mean a cap reduction for a lot of Rogue skills, which is not going to happen.  The best we can hope for is a cap raise to equal levels of a rogue on the defensive skills, but Verant will say it is too much, as Paladins and Sks are supposed to be the defensive Hybrids.  A moderate defense increase, along with increasing Riposte and Parry (leave Dodge alone just to appease Verant) would help a decent amount.<br><br>Personally though, I think Rangers are locked into this for the long haul.  It just takes a lot of patience, skill, and adaptability to play a Ranger and squeeze the most out of them.  Just hitting Autoattack, casting snare, and looting won't cut it for this potentially wonderful class.  Hopefully something can be found to help, and it is not a bunch of crappy underpowered spells being released in Luclin =/<br><br>Gorthin Spiritcaller<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

A monk will also outdamage a ranger due to superior weapon selection, natural haste, and flying kick.  A warrior will also outdamage a ranger with critical hits and crippling blows.  I dont really feel that it's fair to compare a warrior on defensive to a ranger.  I don't think that it's the defensive disc that makes warriors the prime choice of tanks.  It's the fact that they have the highest AC and the most HP.  Even without defensive, they would still be the best tank, defensive just puts them over the top.<br><br>"But you can't take them out of the equation.

Next to magic based, fire based is the most commonly resisted form of magic.  It is common that a class will ahve to depend on debuffs in order to operate at maximum efficiency, but seems rather harsh that rangers have to depend on debuffs in order for them to simply pull their weight.  Finally, calefaction is not a "free" 450 damage.  It costs 250 mana.  That is about 90 secs of medding just to cast 1 spell.  Considering a rogue can backstab for about that much, or a monk can do about that much in 2 or 3 rounds of combat, all mana free, I don't consider it to be all that impressive.<br><br>"Like I said, Cobolt Legs and BP are the ones you need the "Uber" guild for.

I was forced to solo through my entire career.  Occasionally I could get into a group here and there, but it was mainly because they felt pity for me, not because they needed me.  But I can't really say I blame them, why would you want a ranger, when you can take a warrior, rogue or monk.<br><br>"Personally though, I think Rangers are locked into this for the long haul.

There simply is no comparison.  As to a monk outdamaging a Ranger who is casting, that can only happen if they have a great Tank.  Monks have NO aggro management short of melee distance, weapon selection, and turning off autoattack.  A monk who goes all out will die, and quickly (so would the Ranger in that situation).  As to "natural haste", that only applies to their fists, which never improve beyond 14/26 (Human, level 60).  Anyone should have equivilent/better weapons by that point.<br><br>High end encounters require a Warrior (or multiples) with the defensive Disc.  Noone else can stand in there long enough without it to allow the Clerics to CH them multiple times over the course of a fight that can last 5+ minutes.  Only warriors can do that, which is what makes them &gt;the&lt; tanks.  In a normal xp grind group, most prefer a SK or Paladin as the primary tank, simply because Paladins and SKs can generally hold aggro better than a Warrior, and SKs get FD.  The warrior having a higher AC in most cases doesn't matter on High End Velious and Kunark encounters.  Those MOBS always hit for close to max damage regardless.  Defensive Disc is what keeps the warrior alive.<br><br>"The main problem is I have found with rangers, is that their high level nukes are all fire based (firestrike and calefaction). Next to magic based, fire based is the most commonly resisted form of magic.

Considering a rogue can backstab for about that much, or a monk can do about that much in 2 or 3 rounds of combat, all mana free, I don't consider it to be all that impressive. "<br><br>Druids have this problem as well, but they are solid nukers.  You have to know when you can nuke, and when it is best not to.  As to needing to cast these debuffs to nuke "just to pull their own weight", that is crazy.  Rangers have pure offensive melee equal (caps and weapons wise) to any other class.  If you can't nuke it, then melee it (which is where 85% of your damage should come from anyway IMO.  Overnukking combined with lots of melee damage= too much aggro).  And by "free" damage I meant you do not have to do anything special for it.  Yes, it takes mana.  But what else are you going to do with it?  Mana is there for a reason, to be USED.  If you just sit there and admire that full blue mana bar, it is a waste.  Use the mana (wisely).  And for a Monk to do that kind of damage in 2 or 3 rounds, they are going to need a high end 2h blunt weapon, dual attack each time, and hit each time.  Taking into consideration that the average melee hit ratio is about 65%, it will definately take more than 2 or three rounds to pull that off, in a consistant manner.  Hell, at level 43 with a Arbitor's, if I double attack each round for three rounds and hit on each, my low str Ranger can do 672 damage (112 max per hit or so).  But #1) I will usually not double attack three times in a row #2)I will not hit all 6 times #3)I will not hit for max damage.  That generalization would apply to all melee classes =)  It may happen once in a great while, but not consistantly.  Don't forget, that 450 damage is IN ADDITION to what the Ranger normally does melee wise.  It is not the sole source of damage.<br><br>"Well, it seems that we both agree that Verant messed up horribly when they gave away the ranger's utilitarian spells to everybody. As far as the Invigorate vs Healing goes, a ranger has never been a combat healer. They simply don't heal as fast as a mob can deal damage. Therefore, the Invigorate/Healing would be used almost exclusively during down times. Given that stipulation, I would much rather have a mana free 13 second cast heal spell"<br><br>No, Rangers are not combat healers.  We are downtime reducers, and in a blatant emergency, can combat heal if all else fails.  Granted, Rangers suck at it, but it can be done.  I would like to point out that 95% of the Warrior population won't see a Cobolt BP on the average server, so trying to say an item like that makes a Ranger obsolete is not valid IMO.  Everyone loves mana free healing, but most will see the self only regen items, and Rangers can still project their healing onto others.  *shrug*  If you have it, use it.  If not, well, then you need a Ranger (or other healing capable class) to help.  Before they made duck interrupt instant, once that Cleric started the 10 second Cheal, the Enchanter would hold his breath if there wasn't a secondary healer.  It was rare, but I have seen Rangers successfully emergency heal and pull the monster off the enchanter quicker than taunt ever could.  Like I said, it was rare, but I have seen it =)  <br><br>"The problem I see is that while rangers have numberous weak points, they don't have any strong points. It's true that this game is group oriented game, and that is the main reason I feel the ranger is underpowered. In my experiences, no group wanted a ranger. No guild wanted a ranger. I was forced to solo through my entire career. Occasionally I could get into a group here and there, but it was mainly because they felt pity for me, not because they needed me. But I can't really say I blame them, why would you want a ranger, when you can take a warrior, rogue or monk. "<br><br>A Ranger is a Hybrid, and will not have any "strong" points.  The strongest facets of the class are :Track, offensive output, flexibility.  As to no group wanting a Ranger, I NEVER have a problem finding a group.  It may take 10 minutes, but most groups actually prefer picking up a Ranger as a secondary tank over most others because of the flexibility.  I do not know what server you are on, but Bristlebane is actually quite Ranger friendly.  The reason I would want a Ranger over a Monk or Rogue can range from group balance, needing a SoWer/snarer, needing a tracker, being able to use the spell versatility, to just plain out needing someone with a taunt button.  Others can think of more, but I just woke up and am still gathering my thoughts for the day =P<br><br>I haven't given up, but Verant feels they like the classes where they are for the most part.  Maybe the Rangers will get a few more tweaks, but only Verant knows that.<br><br>Gorthin Spiritcaller<br><br><br><br> <br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
