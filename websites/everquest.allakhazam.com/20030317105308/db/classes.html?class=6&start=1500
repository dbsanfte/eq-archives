	   <tr><td colspan=2>------------------------------<br>Things we absolutely need<br>------------------------------<br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need higher defensive skills.  As it stands, a warrior friend of the same level has much better AC than me, unbuffed and without a shield.  He is wearing mostly crafted, some Indo.  I am wearing Valorium BP/Legs and Deepwater everything else.  As suggested before, 245 would be nice.<br><br>2.  Scrap Holyforge.  It's a waste of a discipline, frankly.  I would like so see a gimped version of Defensive at 60, and Sanctification at 55.  This would allow us to participate at Venril Sathir at the same level as everybody else (Sanctification <i> does</i> block his lifetap, right?).<br><br>3.  MOBs should be able to be interrupted in casting, although not stunned, with bashes and stuns.  A CHeal on Vox usually starts when she's pretty low.  Trak attempts to gate at very low health.  Usually around less than 10%, which is 3200 HP on these mobs.  Ten percent of King Tormax is 100 000 HP (supposedly).  Ouch?  Although he doesn't gate, this is just an example.<br><br>------------------------------<br>Things that would be really nice<br>------------------------------<br><br>1.  I would like to see Gorenaire and Talendor always drop Vox and Nagafen books, respectively.  That goes for the bard and warrior scales too.  I mean honestly, if you can get a team together to gank Gorenaire, you <i> deserve</i> your epic.<br><br>2.  I would like to see Superior heal at 54, and Remedy at 57 or 58.  As Druids may be getting healing upgrades, I'd like to see minor upgrades for us too.<br><br>3.  I saw somebody suggest that we be able to use the Block skill while using a shield.  I don't see this as difficult to code, as bash can only be used with a shield, by large races, or with an epic.  This might help our tanking abilities when that's what needed of us instead of damage.<br><br>4.  Divine Strength bumped to an earlier level?  The ranger buff at 50 seriously makes DS look like a marginal improvement, ten levels later.<br><br>5.  Change the Defender back to an all-or-nothing proc.  And make it stun for 2 seconds, just so we can feel special that it made a difference.<br><br>6.  Flame of Light needs a graphic and sound.<br><br>7.  The Fiery Defender should always be visible, like the ranger and shadowknight epics.  As it stands, people with particles off (read: everybody) see you swinging around your Hilt 'O Death with no blade.<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>Comments?<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Praetor</b>, 60th Crusader<br>Avatars of Discord</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I was just reading a post from another message board about this level 18 paly asking help on what weapon to buy.&nbsp;&nbsp;His problem is "I have 1k to spend but I don't know which weapon to buy". <br>I am a level 20 paladin and I have played the game honestly(I don't know about smartly though).  That means no twinks and power leveling.  At level 20, I can't recall having more than 300pp in the bank.  I have made some plats but after all the upgrade and dressing up, i cant seem to save pp that much.  I currently have BiBs for 2hs and crystal fiber for 1hs and both cost for merely a little over 100pp.  I wouldn't mind doing quests for good weapons but if I have the resources of acquiring them safely and quickly, then it would be a no-brainer, heck yah I'm gonna buy them! <br>I've also done all the easy-money stuff, GLS quests, lego pads, cb belts...etc and I know there is a lot of twinking going on of which I don't really care for that much. Even being in unrest, all that loot and go to bank does get old after a while.<br>Now, if there is a way of getting 1k at level 18 faster and without twinking, I'd be sporting me a ghoulbane and a faster 2hs weapon.  If any of you knows of a way to get that kind of cash at that level, how and where, I would very much like to hear from you.<br>Other than that, this game rules!!!<br><br>Good Journey to you all,<br>Fellow Paly<br>20th season<br>Cazic Thule server<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I sold it for 700pp in EC.  I have also been fighting in Highpass at the orc camp.  They drop loot like Bronze Weapons and Ringmail Armor which sells for 2-5pp at a vendor.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well, some people may have twinked, some just may have gotten extremely lucky with things dropping, and some may have spent over 2 weeks getting money. If you have just been playing through the levels, you should have at LEAST 300pp with the good weapons you have. Since you are lvl 20, the BIBS is a good sword for you to use, and you DO have another good 1hs. Remember, at your lvl, you will hit for a lot more than 20 or so with the BIBS. That should be good for you till about lvl 25 or so. If you do want to make some money+ leveling at your level, i suggest going to Highpass, and making a gnoll group. There are Ringmail drops here, and rawhide armor. Also, you have a chance at a great shield + a good sword if you hunt a bit here. youll prolly want to keep the sword and the shield if you get them, the shield should last through 35 or so, your *New*, hopefully 1hs sword should last you through about lvl 25, where you can sell that for a bit, and maybe buy something else. Also, if you REALLY want to be frugal, get a guide to Lguk, and shout there for someone to tell you if shin greaves drop. Those are fairly good, no drop legs, and you MIGHT be able to get Shin Guantlets while you are there. If you pick up these, you can sell your old stuff for a few pp or some good pp. If you see someone leave stuff on a corpse of something you cant kill, loot it, there will be most likely some FS weapons or something. At your level, the only real good "easy-cash" method is GLS quest. And that just SUCKS doing it. If you work hard enough though, you might be able to get up near 1kpp in about a week of 3 hours playing periods. Thats all my advice, besides, if you work towards making levels, you will probably be able to get loot along with that. Dont give up, the road is hard but the payoff is good. Last advice-SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR LATER WHEN YOU REALLY NEED IT, BELIEVE ME!<br>Zomor-bertoxx<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Wow, i had a lowly mino axe at lvl 9, you got real lucky on that. Anyways, answering your question, DEFINATLY keep the BIBS, just go to Crushbone and collect some CB belts and sell them for 1pp each. when you have maybe 30pp or so, buy a shiny brass shield(best newbie easy to obtain shield in the game), and a mino axe. then just practice both each level until they max out. This way you have more opportunities to buy great deals and actually be able to use the weapons you buy. You will be able to beat the crap out of a lvl 30 giant with a weighted axe for the opening blow, and then rip him apart after that with a faster 1hs+shield combo that you keep in store. Believe me, keep the BIBS, you will use it for a long time, and keep doing small upgrades to your armor and 1hs. It will pay off in the long run, trust me.<br>Zomor-bertoxx<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Paladins can be soloed, but equipment is your key to success. Right now, I have a paladin that just hit 35 on bristlebane (Diovan).<br><br>I think the biggest factor to me soloing better in lake of ill omen (I went there at lvl21 and had a lot of downtime) was that I was able to get my hands on a mithril 2hander (21 dmg, 28 dly with haste factored in (haste is the effect on the weapon, not from fbss or anything)). I got it at lvl25 and I've been much more effective at soloing since then. My armor is pretty good too (mostly strength boosts, but some dex/wis/etc in there). <br><br>Anyway, most of my items came from chance encounters with a couple of high level folks. If you're not as lucky, still don't give up. Save as much money as you can and first go for a better weapon (the lowest delay, highest damage you can afford). delay always makes a difference, because you want to kill the mob as quick as you can.<br><br>Get an axe of iron back (16dmg, 37dly or something like that -- been using it until lvl25). it's better than your forged blade, and you can get one for around 100pp. that's the quickest solution to your weapon problem if you don't have a lot of cash to spare.<br><br>A good way to make money is to make your way to east/west commons and collect greater lightstones off willowisps. They're rare drops, but you can sell them to people for around 5-6pp each. even better, go to oasis and you can give them to a certain gypsy (forgot the name). Not only do you get exp, but you get an item (a container, so make sure you have an open general slot), which you can sell back to the gypsy for around 7-8pp. Another thing is to collect high quality bear pelts off kodiaks. These are much more rare, but they go for 30-40pp each.<br><br>at 16...I would tell you to hunt in oasis, but that zone is overcrowded a lot of times (at least it was on bristlebane). it's kinda risky too, because everything other than crocodiles/caimans aggro on you.<br><br>a strategy you might try using (if you have root, but I don't know if you get that yet), is to root your opponent if you're running low on hp, back up a bit, and heal yourself. you could even med too until root breaks (so move back a bit and make sure nothing else will jump you). it's hard to tell when root will break (if it even holds), so always be prepared.<br><br>and ac/agi is important more than anything for armor (strength is nice for the extra damage, but it's not that noticeable unless you have over +20 extra strength). agi will help you dodge hits more; I think ac just makes successful hits do less damage (I don't see how it will help you to avoid hits if you're wearing heavy, high ac armor).<br><br>I've said a lot of crap, and I'm not sure how much of it is helpful, but I hope you got something out of it. Take care and have hope.<br><br>Diovan (Bristlebane)<br>Feresta (The Rathe)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

With LOH and your healing spells, you have the equivilent of 3x your HP in your use.  Equipment is very key.  Always get the best you can.  I am not the best equipped, but Im not that bad off.  Go for AC above stats, as AC makes the most difference.  Thats about all I can say.<br><br>Winterknight<br>lvl 37 paladin <br>Vallon Zek<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

My skill is maxed (5+5*lvl) at 80.  My strength is 102. <br><br>Max = ((102+80)/100)*20)+0<br>Max = 36<br><br>But thats funny, I usually hit for 29.  Well since I'm under level 20, I have a twink cap at 29.  I can't hit harder until I reach level 20.<br><br>I love that sword, it was a gift to me when I formed our guild.  But the damage it can do is very misleading.  Its delay is so slow, what happens if I miss.  Or if I miss twice?  When I'm in a group and we're taking on something pretty mean, that could happen.<br><br>I'm not sure if a lower damage/lower delay weapon would be better.  I usually use my lower delay weapons to work on skill level.<br>&nbsp;<br>This is the way, grasshopper.</td></tr>

Also, (not an exception) i have a lvl 19 Human Paladin that i made a while back to see what it was like to be a big person lol, anyways, i gave him my Wurmslayer for a day, he was doing maxes of like 35 dmg with it.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>While I'm sure it's true with such Uber weapons as a Wurmslayer or such a slow and virtually worthless weapon (except for that first swing) as the weighted axe, to do more than 30 pts of damage, for all practical purposes, it's not likely you will hit for over 30 when you are sub twenty.<br><br>Since the beginning of this post talks about a 19th lvl Paladin, my advice to you would be to persevere just a bit longer! You are on the brink of making an amazing discovery: double attacks at 20 and new spells at 22!&nbsp;&nbsp;So stick it out and reap the rewards! Don't give up or be too concerned until you have reached your rights of passage, had your damage cap removed, and have the opportunity to add that last name if you so desire.  And whatever you do, don't compare yourself to a Warrior. They will soon be or are out-distancing you on damage.<br><br>My personal experience was to see my damage jump from regular 29pt hits with my Axe of the Iron Back, to 35-37 points once I reached 20th lvl, almost like someone flipped a switch! It was instantaneous<br><br>However, it does make a difference on the weapon. Like my earlier post (Damage vs Speed) mentions, my Deepwater Harpoon has a damage of 18 but I rarely hit for 50pts with it. My 2-hs Practice Sword has a damage of 19 (only 1 pt more) but I routinely hit for 56 and 57 points of damage with it! Why the difference due to one single damage point difference? I have no idea....but it's true.  The Practice Sword is a bit slow for me, so I use my Harpoon as my primary 2-hs.  But it recently came in very handy while in Sol A where the low blue/high green gobs SWARM all over you! Hard to beat the Thistle Shield in those situations.<br><br>Stay true to the cause, persevere, and reap the rewards!<br><br>Kneesmasher Ayebulger<br>30th Circle of Dwarven Paladins<br>Twilight Brethren<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Kneesmasher Ayebulger<br>Dwarven Knight<br>Torvonnilous Server<br><br>"Never Mistake Kindness for Weakness"</td></tr>

Also worth checking out is the Zones by level grid located at this sight in order to get some idea of a decent place to hunt within your level.  I cannot comment exactly where to go due to the fact that I am in the same boat as you but I have posted a question earlier on this board about where a lvl 25 could hunt. <br> As for the 2HS practice sword, I personally have an Axe of the Iron Back but am currently infaturated with the Runic Carver (18damage/ 37 delay)compared to the 2 handed pratice sword (19dmg, 47 dly) it loses a damage point but gains 9 in the delay, but it doesn't have a proc.

You will probably get 1k-2k just for two levels because the drops there are so good. I also say that you might want to save up your pp, you WILL need it for later. But you could buy a Wurmslayer if you do get like 500 more pp, and sell your ghoulbane. But buy the scales and then do the quest, better deal for you. Also, if your hard for cash, you can sell the Wurmslayer you got for 5k or so, than buy the scales again for 3.5k and do the quest again, gaining you 1.5k easily!<br>Zomor-bertoxx<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I don't exactly have the stats of these charactes before me, so I don't know the comparison, but if someone would be kinda enough to reply, I'd like to know what the best idea might be as for which combination of race and Paladin.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>As a Dwarven Paladin, I will undoubtedly be slanted towards thinking Dwarven Paladins are the best! My little guy ROCKS and I love playing him. If you want to run the BEST Character/Class combination, then I would say a Dwarf is the way to go! However, you should play what you feel most comfortable and happy with, NOT what the best combination of stats is.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will not be happy with your character otherwise.  If you think an Erudite Paladin or Half-Elf Paladin is best, run one of those.<br><br>In keeping with your question, let me point out that dwarves start with an Agility stat of 70. If your agility stat is below 75, you receive a 50 pt. Armor Class deduction/penalty! So if you do start a Dwarf, make sure you put those all-important 5 points into Agility. I'd split the rest between Strength and Wisdom, skip Intelligence and Charisma all together, and if you really wanted to, throw a point or two into Dex, but that's not really necessary. With any odd points I'd throw them into Strength.  Remember, you will be looked upon as a tank, so Armor Class is king!

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Okay all you Paladins out there, I thought I would start a new thread and get everyone's opinion on the subject of damage of a weapon versus speed of a weapon. While I think we all agree that there is a subjective line, somewhere out there, where damage vs speed is a trade off! The trick is to maximize that trade-off with the right weapons. Since there are few high damage weapons with short delays, you have to make a decision eventually regarding which weapon you want to use, and there are lots to choose from.&nbsp;&nbsp;To start the ball rolling, I will begin with my current arsenal of weapons.<br><br>(1)Deepwater Harpoon: 18 damage, 40 delay, +5 wisdom, +5 stamina, weight of 13, damage per second rating: 9.25. I hit in the upper 30's to mid 40's with this weapon regularly at 30th lvl.  The Wisdom plus is nice and since it's 2-hs and kinda heavy the stamina is always a plus! No doubt about it, it is a nice well-rounded pally only weapon! It is my primary 2-hs weapon. <br><br>(2)2-handed Practice Sword: 19 damage, 47 delay, Weight 10, damage per second rating: 8.30, Procs Shield of Thistles!  I like this weapon, even though it is on the slow side, because it hits like a ton of bricks and procs the damage shield! I hit in the mid 50's with this weapon regularly, even though it is only one damage point more than the Harpoon.  I use this weapon when there is a very good chance of fighting multiple mobs where you will be getting hit from all sides. This works well with lower lvl mobs that swarm but not so well on higher ones. I will probably sell this weapon soon.<br><br>I prefer to fight 2-h slash, and I used the Axe of the Ironback for 10+ lvls and finally moved on;<br>but as we all know, there are lots of times where a BASH is necessary and 1-hs is the way to go. My current 1-hs weapon is: (and YES, that's singular):<br><br>Ghoulbane: Damage 15, Delay 34, Weight 9.5, Damage per second: 9.12, Special Proc of Dismiss Undead!  I use this weapon exclusively for my 1-hs duties.  When fighting undead, there is no equal, at least not that can be attained at my level. The Dismiss Undead Procs for 152 points at lvl 30, along with your regular slash.  I have actually had the sword proc TWICE back to back on a double attack where I did 342 pts of damage to the poor Carrion Ghoul in a single round!  I regularly hit in the mid 30's with this weapon. It is a good 1-hs weapon all around, no doubt about it, and against undead, WATCH OUT! I will keep it til I have to turn it in on my Fiery Avenger/Defender quest, whichever it is. And then I will go back and attempt to get another one! <br><br>My ultimate 1-hs, at least for the foreseeable future, is a Wurmslayer, but I can't realistically afford that yet. My ultimate 2-hs for the foreseeable future is a Mithril 2-hander but I can't afford that either! <br><br>Okay, let the discussion begin! I would like to preface the discussion by: LETS BE REALISTIC! I don't want to hear about how you got a Jade Inlaid Crescent Axe at 7th lvl and it's awesome, or how you used to use Ghoulbane while in your teens but you traded it for a Wurmslayer at 19th and are now looking for a weapon that does over 30 pts of damage since you are now 23rd level!  If you EARNED your weapons, I'd like to hear from you!  Looking forward to the discussion....<br><br>Kneesmasher Ayebulger<br>30th Circle of Dwarven Paladins<br>Twilight Brethren<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Kneesmasher Ayebulger<br>Dwarven Knight<br>Torvonnilous Server<br><br>"Never Mistake Kindness for Weakness"</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>There is post by PraetorFenix that explains this as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my take of the stuff from lvl 15 paladin.  Anyways, I already typed it by the time I noticed Praetor's post.<br><br>I read this post about max damage: <br><a href="http://eqforge.com/forums/Forum16/HTML/008833.html" target=_new>http://eqforge.com/forums/Forum16/HTML/008833.html</a><br><br>It said that max damage is: <br>MAX = [((Weapon Skill + Strength)/100) * (DMG)) + (Level Damage Bonus)] <br><br>Level Damage Bonus = (Level - 25)/3 <br><br>I didn't care as much about the formulas, but I was intersted in the relationship of strength and weapon skill and the role they played.  I find the formulas to be pretty accurate, but not right on the money. It is really geared for people lvl 30 or above.<br><br>That article suggests that one's weapon skill + strength are determining factors in damage. The weapons damage is a no brainer in its importance. <br><br>So for example a level 15 paladin like me has a Blackened Iron Bastard sword (20/48). My skill is maxed (5+5*lvl) at 80. My strength is 102. <br><br>Max = ((102+80)/100)*20)+0 <br>Max = 36 <br><br>But thats funny, I usually hit for 29. Well since I'm under level 20, I have a twink cap at 29. I can't hit harder until I reach level 20. <br><br>My 1hs is a forged long sword and my 1HB is the Shining Star.  Hmmm, lets see what do I use? The Blackened Iron Bastard sword.  The other ones work, but are used more to up weapon skill.<br><br>This is what I've been doing.  I carry around my blackend sword at all times.  If I'm working on skill level, I'll switch out my 2HS for the round shield and long sword.  But if I find my self getting in trouble, then I whip out big daddy and let him take care of business:)<br><br>I love that sword, it was a gift to me when I formed our guild. But the damage it can do is very misleading. Its delay is so slow, what happens if I miss. Or if I miss twice? Some mobs are just more agile or dexterous than other mobs.  Their level compared to mine is also a factor.  A question is, if I miss 30% of the time with the long delay two hander, will I also miss 30% of the time with a short delay weapon? <br><br>If I do, then the answer is pretty easy, I would chose whatever weapon gave me the most damage in a given time period.<br><br>I have no idea of how people determine damage per second. So I can do an easier example.  Lets use my Blackened Iron Bastard sword and my Shining Star of Light.  Using the above formula, I expect to get 11 damage max from the Shining star of Light and 29 damage max from the sword.  Lets assume that I will hit max of both and connect 70% of the time.<br><br>Since the Shining Star is twice as fast as the Blackened bastard sword, it will hit 14 times out of 20 swings, while the bastard sword hits 7 times out of 10 swings in the same time period.<br><br>Shining Star total dam = 14*11 = 154<br>Blackend Sword tot dam = 7*29 = 203<br><br>This doesn't take into account bash.  Lets say, I bash for 6, hitting 70% of the time, and bash is used once every 3 swings of the shining star, we can assume 3-4 bashes at 6dmg.  That helps some, but not enough.<br><br>I find from my experience, that my blackened sword is just better while soloing and often during grouping. Althougth the numbers I'm using does not use hits that are below max damage and assumes that the hit/miss ratio is equal, the max damage of those weapons are accurate.  So don't flame me cause of the numbers, its just speculation.<br><br>In groups I find that sometimes, the blackened sword isn't too effective.  Since groups take on bigger and badder things than soloing, I find when I miss, I'm missing big.  Sometimes 3 times in a row.  If fighting trains or longer fights, then its works good, but if the fight is short and quick, I often find that I really didn't contribute enough damage.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>This is the way, grasshopper.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Yeh, I agree with earning the Ghoulbane "the righteous way", more like "the Paladin way".&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to actually go in Upper Guk and hack and slash your way through Lord Shin and hope nobody other than Paladins are camped there, and also that he may actually drop the sword the first time you kill him who happens to be a fellow paladin.  What is up with that?  Like everyone keep saying it should be a no drop item.  <br><br>Anyway, I'm a level 19 paly who happens to have a whip for a weapon.  I'm using the Crystal Fiber for my 1 hand slash(8dmg, 26dly).  Its fast,it hits almost consistently around 16-18 and you get bash(SBS) on top on that.  I dig this weapon.  This should at least be good enough until I get ghoulbane, thats if I have enough time to spend in frogland(annoying sound) and kill a fellow paladin.<br><br>As for my 2hs weapon, I thought Blackened Iron Bastard Sword(BIBS-20dmg, 47dly) was better than my Axe of Iron Back(16dmg-37dly).  At level 16, I was hitting in the upper 20's.  The delay wasn't noticeable, so I stuck with the higher damage.  <br><br>Somehow I prefer the 1hs/shield combo, it gives me more of a paladin feel to it.  Having a shield makes it more heroeic(spelled right?) as well.  It seems like if you add up all the damages, you get more from a faster weapon.  <br><br>So that's my 2coppers and I hope to see you all in Norrath duking it out with the mobs.  Later!<br>BTW, I bought all my weapons with the money I made from every low level mobs that nobody wants to fight, just like all the non-twinkers.<br><br>Cya,<br>Level 19 Paly<br>Cazic thule<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Nice post Kneesmasher, i also used a ghoulbane at lvls 28-35. It is a good weapon, and since i was an idiot and didnt train in 2hs, i never used any 2hs weapons. Ghoulbane at your level rocks for fighting undead creatures, it procs easy, almost never resisted, has a good dps ratio, and has a great proc. Granted, that 2hs you use is a great weapon,but when you get a Wurmslayer, it will make that look like a rusty weapon. One way to get it is to sell your ghoulbane and 2h practice sword, and hopefully youve been saving up around a k or so, buy the scales used for the Wurmslayer quest. Go do the quest, get your wurmslayer, and revel in the fact of that you ripped someone off SOOOOOOOOOOOOO badly. I used to hit in the high 70's and low 80's consistently when i was lvl 36. Even a Mith2hander cant do that. Trust me, Wurmslayer is worth the price you might pay for it, it does WAYYYYYYY more damage than a Mith 2hander, besides the delay. Plus, you get bash and some more stat adjustment plus ac from a shield. Also, dont try to go get the ghoulbane the "honorable" way, because at lvl 30, you need a full group of 35's to just get that far into the dungeon if you are KoS. And hunting the Shin lord WILL make you KoS in Uguk. this means that whenever you want to go to Lguk for some cash or stuff, you will have to clear everything in your way, hence you destroy your faction with live frogs forever. Not good. Also, i think that you should keep that 2hslash up wit that weapon, when you are not the main tank, i suggest using that instead of Wurm, just for keeping skills up. What else- ah yes, i would definatly take damage over speed weapons. My reasons are if you have a dmg shielded apponent, hence almost every single thing in a non cleared dungeon, you wont get hurt that bad, but youll kill yourself with speed weapons. Also, doing more damage at once is a better taunt then doing a lot of damage over time. Back to GB, if you stick with your levels, cash will flow, and youll be able to buy more stuff. You can also do Ro at your level, its INCREDIBLE exp then, each thing for a mold turned in is a bub of exp. Than you can sell Ro for money hence being able to buy better stuff. As for 2hs, i would keep yours for now, until you can go do Soulfire. Ok, i think i went a lil overboard, but what the hay. Bomb me if ya want hehe.<br>Zomor-bertoxx<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I started tings out Focusing primary on a 1HS and Bash combo.&nbsp;&nbsp;This being my first character and on a relatively new server (it was new the day I first logged on) so Ghoulbane and Wurmslayer were not as readily available as on other servers, and I didn't have the plat for them either (still don't either :) ).<br><br>I decided in my mid-teens that a lower delay and a decent damage combo would be best for me so that I could increase my skill levels faster and maximize the time to learn several skills before the next level was upon me. (I was leveling from 15-27 at around once per day).<br><br>1) One handed slash - started out with a Fine Steel Long Sword (6dmg/28 delay- I think).  Grabbed a Minotuar Battle axe at lvl 8 (8dmg/38 delay).  And am currently using a Crystalline Blade- fogot the stats but am hitting at roughly 26 per swing.  My Shield has stayed the same during this entire time (a Shiny Brass Shield) which I plan to upgrade one of these days.  I bash with the shield constitantly at 9 hp per bash.<br><br>2) Two handed slash- I didn't start using a 2 handed sword/axe until around level 12 when a friend traded me for 3 DF belts a Giant Tree Flayer (10 damage/ 41 delay). I wasn't happy with it, all it was good for was to kill willowisps for the GLS.  I bought a Axe of the Iron Back (16dmg/37delay) at lvl 20 and am currently using it to this day.  <br><br>I try to keep those to skills maxed due to the fact that you'll never know what type of weapon will fall into your hands, and being able to use it and use it well will either make you love the weapon or hate it and sell it off.  Of course as I continue progressing in levels and accumulating more things, I plan on earning (that's right I am not going to buy) my ghoulbane and Deepwater Harpon- both of which will be attainable at around lvl 32 for me.  Until then I will still use my Crystaline blade and Axe of the Iron Back till that time.  <br>&nbsp;<br>Dadin <br>54th Cavalier<br>Honored Circle on Xev<br><br>Dwarven Thane<br>Hellwinds - Palomides </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Everyone is forgetting my favorite hunting ground and one that brough my from lvl 15 to lv 30 in 10 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lake of Ill Omen!  I love that place, still do.  It is essentail to group in there but it can also be soloed (i've done both).  If oyu in a group the best place to camp in your teens is between the River and the Goblin Ruins on the Left side of the Lake ( as your coming From Fiona Vie).  There hunt everything in sight staying clear of the Goblin Ruins (I've seen some poor puller pull every Goblin out of that spot and counted nearly 15 goblins chasing after that poor soul), however I never tried Lull in the ruins and there is invariably one behind the wall that you cannot see (reserve these till at least level 20 or so when they con white to blue- without a very strong group they will kill your entire party due to the fact that no matter how good the puller is 2 always seem to come). Hunting there usssualy consists of Iskar Muaraders, Goblin Agrressors and Battlemasters, Leseer Icebone and Charbone Skeletons (great practice for that Ward undead spell) Sabertooth Tigers and Sarnak Flunkies.  Soloing can be done at around lvl 15 safely in the area to the right of the lake (again as your coming from Fiona Vie) around the general area of the first Abandoned Tower here you can find more of the same types of mosters as listed previously but not quite as hard (make sure you con everything before they aggro on you or you attack them though- everyonce in awhile a yellow or red gets thrown in the mix).  From there move to the Windmill and the to the Sarnak Fortress or Goblin Caves (grouping of course) and then the exp will really flow.  Also a nice thing about the mosters in the area generally carry 1-2pp and change on them.  Most of the time I run around encumbered due to the fact that I have so much coin on my person yet do not want to quite fighting long enough for me to run to the bank in Foina Vie.  A word of Caution about Fiona Vie - once outside the city gates AVIOD EVERYTHING, almost all monsters in the area are lvl 35+, and there's a nasty necro floating around that I've heard is 45+.  Just keep your constantly looking for the black and red spiders and follow the river on up to the Lake of Ill Omen (SoW is helpful in this zone as well as Camo/Invisibilty.  However being a dwarve I luck out sometimes and am able to run directly under the spider avoiding an aggro by shear luck)<br>&nbsp;<br>Dadin <br>54th Cavalier<br>Honored Circle on Xev<br><br>Dwarven Thane<br>Hellwinds - Palomides </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I would suggest Crushbone, especially if you are able to play in off-hours. You are a perfect level to help her solo Legos and they should still be pretty good XP for her, not to mention Emissary's and Oracles. You also get the Lego Pads which she can turn in to Canloe Nusback in the Kaladim Warriors Guild (downstairs) and get additional experience for doing that.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pads won't help you much anymore at 19th but should still move her XP bar. If you can get a good group together for the Throne Room and hold it for a while, you can make a ton of experience!  Some of the fastest teen experience in the game that I've ever seen. The spawns are numerous and quick, with Lord Darish spawning frequently and dropping some nice loot. With two Paladins, a healer, maybe a warrior or two and perhaps a rogue or druid, you could literally make several levels in a night holding the TR camp.<br><br>The only drawback to Crushbone is it is crowded during peak times.  There's a reason for that, it's a GREAT zone.  But if you can play during off-hours, most areas will have plenty of Mobs that still give her good XP like the Taskmaster Orc near the Slaver pits.  If you tire of the Throne Room, you can move on up into the Tower and take on Royal Guards (they drop bronze weapons), Crush (for the tunic), The Prophet and even DVinn himself if you have a really good and strong group.  DVinn is tough and not for the faint of heart at sub 20's! Crush was the first Mob to ever hit me for damage in the 40's!  DVinn was the first mob to ever hit me with double attacks over 40 EACH!  If you play in the TR, you will no doubt encounter these guys anyway.  For really fast levelling, it's hard to beat but she will soon outgrow it. I still recall the first time I killed a Lego and got no experience.....it was the passing of an era!<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>Kneesmasher Ayebulger<br>30 Circle of Dwarven Paladins<br>Twilight Brethren<br>&nbsp;<br>Kneesmasher Ayebulger<br>Dwarven Knight<br>Torvonnilous Server<br><br>"Never Mistake Kindness for Weakness"</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ahhhhhh, lvl 31, lvl after old hell hehe. I hunted at FM's giant fort, until i realized that was bad exp, then i went to Unrest. Besides Unrest being my and my guild's favorite hunting/meeting place, you are now in the levels where it REALLY shines for you. Get in a ghost or alter group, invis vs undead yourself and run through the basement to the ghost room. There spawns Hags, TT's, DT's, Schroom's, Werebats, GDB's, Barbed's, and old Garanel Rucksif(ghost). after a time down here, you will hopefully have gotten a feel for the place and begin to like it. This may as well be some of the best exp and hunting in group exp for lvls 30-35. FS drops here, along with bronze armor, and good coin. Also rare drops are the jagged bands from the ghost, and the DWB's from the ghost. ( all of this being rare, is assuming the ghost doesnt pop for a little while, happens a lot) Also, once you reach lvl 34 or so, you can solo at the blood pool for incredible exp. I remember soloing here at lvl 35 at the rate of 1 bub per 1 and 1/2 hours of playing. Great fun, and when there's not a ghost group, you can invis yourself and head upstairs to camp the ghoul magi room for some cash. Also, you can meet new and good people by just Powerleveling them from like 9-15 or so. Only take s a little while, and you meet a new person, and maybe ave some fun in between. So try Unrest for good exp and loot. OH and uh, BTW Cazic Thule SUCKS for a dungeon for exp( in my experience)<br>Zomor-bertoxx<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Simply having a slugfest with a mob is boring, seeing who can deal the most damage, but with a paladin you have to think, strategize, and budget your mana.  you have to time the LoH just right so that u use it only when its ABSOLUTELY neccesary.  now that i have achieved level 30, the paladin is even more fun.  my wepon procs, i got a symbol which is just cool, healing which heals me muchos, and to top it all off the exp penalty has been removed and LoH now heals an extra 200!!! i'm having the best time on my paladin and if you can't pick a class to make, i'd choose paladin if i were you.  then again monks and necro's are pretty cool, lol.<br><br>    Hakadar Gimlikin, lvl 31 paladin of the Quellious server<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I don't know how much the Sword is worth, but there's no doubt it is a heavy hitter. Also the damage cap Dragoon talks about is the only thing in your way to HUGE damage. Reach lvl twenty and watch your damage SOAR!!&nbsp;&nbsp;But, if it truly is worth 1.5k plat or even 1k plat, I would recommend selling it, as Celt recommended. It is too slow. <br><br>At high levels you fight more casters, more mobs where speed is the key. Somewhere there is a very thin and subjective line where trade offs take place between speed and damage.  Where that line is depends on the individual, but I feel sure it is not at a delay of 54, even if it does hit like a ton of bricks. What about when you miss? You have a long time just to stand there and get pummeled! Try fighting a Carrion Ghoul in Unrest who is wielding a fine steel dagger and you'll see what I mean! <br><br>Trade it in for the big bucks if it's really worth that much, look into something with a good damage 18-19 or so, and a good speed, a delay around 40 or less is very good.  A 2-hand practice sword is also good, even though it is slow with a delay of 48.  Once you can make it proc it will throw shield of thistles on you, so at least while you stand there waiting to swing, the mobs pounding on you are taking some damage! A Deepwater Harpoon is an excellent weapon for about 400-500 plat or so, with a delay of 40, a damage of 18, +5 sta and +5 wis and it looks cool!<br>JMHO<br><br>Kneesmasher Ayebulger<br>30th Circle of Dwarven Paladins<br>Twilight Brethren<br>&nbsp;<br>Kneesmasher Ayebulger<br>Dwarven Knight<br>Torvonnilous Server<br><br>"Never Mistake Kindness for Weakness"</td></tr>

I have a Wurmslayer and can out damage many a warrior at my level.  This will change later though.<br>2.  We are a 1H class!  Later in levels people will want us due to Bash/Stun vs. casters.  Remember this!  Keep that 1HS skill up during the 20's when the 2HS skill is more useful.  You'll thank me later.<br>3.  We can solo.  Use the root/heal combo and we can have sick HP in a solo environment.  I have 1400 base.  With root/heal I can take this up to 2100 easily.  Add in LoH and I can have 3300.  At 39 I will start to regen so add another 200.  Think about 3400 HP!?!  No warrior can match that.  Also, at 45 my DW helm will give me free heals to reduce down time between combat.<br>4.  In a group use your heals between combats to help keep cleric at full mana.  The group will love you.<br>5.  If you are main tank, use Flash of Light as secondary taunt.  I can keep mobs off rogues and monks (who can out-damage me) 98% of the time.<br><br>Play a pally the right way and you'll love this class.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Gorm, I couldn't agree more!&nbsp;&nbsp;Nice post that well explains the benefits of a Paladin at a higher lvl than myself and gives some good advice to all Paladins.  The root, heal and armor combination of a Paladin is very powerful and the ability to top-off the party members by healing that last 100 pts, so the Cleric can med and regain mana, is a great plus as well.  <br><br>And I can't stress how important it is to keep ALL your combat skills up!  I know because I didn't do it and then struggled like hell to get my 1-hs and bash up when I finally got Ghoulbane. Don't just stick with 2-hs in your teens and 20's. I agree it is a more useful skill at those times, but DON'T DO IT!! You need to switch off from time to time and ensure everything is maxed.  The higher you get the more casters you encounter, the more damage they can do, and the more important it becomes to bash them and interrupt their casting!  All you have to do is go to Mistmoore and fight something from the GraveYard that heals itself over and over again during battle, and you'll see what I mean. You have the mob almost dead, miss a bash, and watch his sliver of health go back to 3/4th full where you have to re-kill him all over again! The party is counting on you to bash, stun and interrupt casting. Don't let them down by having a poor bash ability.<br><br>I would even go as far as including 1-hb and 2-hb in that category of skills to keep up.  There are some awesome uber Bashing items Paladins can use at later levels. The last thing you want to have happen when you're lvl 45 is get a chance at one of these uber items and realize your Bash skill is a TWO!!  I can't tell you how hard it is to get your skill up later in life.  Do it while you're young!  And besides, who says you always have to use Swords and Axes?  I can certainly picture my Dwarf with a BIG honkin hammer, smashing knees all across Velious!<br><br>You hit the nail right on the head when you said:<br><br>Play a pally the right way and you'll love this class. Play it the wrong way and you'll be just another person posting "Why Pally Sux"!<br><br>I think too many players want the Paladin to be a warrior, and we are not 'just' a warrior. To play him as such will only lead to disappointment as the warrior next to you outdamages you, kicks, bashes and gets Critical Hits. If you are one of those players thinking Paladins bite, perhaps you should look at how you're playing him/her?  Play him as he is intended and he is one of the best classes in the game, hands down, IMHO.<br><br>Kneesmasher Ayebulger<br>30th Circle of Dwarven Paladins<br>Twilight Brethren<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Kneesmasher Ayebulger<br>Dwarven Knight<br>Torvonnilous Server<br><br>"Never Mistake Kindness for Weakness"</td></tr>

If you can find a cleric or druid or shaman partner, I am sure they would want the shield off of the EXG anyway (its like 9 or 10 wis, You may want one yourself) and at 40 the mobs there die easy and still give good exp. after the patch and the experience increase, It is a good place to hunt with a partner. Just remember that the EXG is 100% magic resistant, so really only melee attacks and a damage shield will help against it (gonna need that partner to heal you and help beat her down when she runs) After 1 camp of like 7 hours or so (partner and I did Gabbie too for the molten cloak) We walked away with 3 shields, 1 Charred BP, 1 Cloak, Couple Mith quills (worthless btw) and like 10 or 11 melatite. Should solve your problem. <br><br>Also, If you can't get a partner to help you camp it, Sit at the zone line and auction for it for say 10pp or so. Most people would rather sell it to you than a vendor for like 8 silver or even drag it to Ebay commons (Heavy stuff) and try to auction it there.<br><br>One last thing, posts said that it is most commonly found on model MB and MC clocks, but it seems more random off of them all to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope this Helps!  <br><br>Kassoff Holyknight<br>Lvl 40 Paladin of Emarr<br>Master Smithie<br>Emarr Server<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

A Paladin will never match up to them in combat, ever!  Actually we are not even close.  But if you run a warrior, that is all you will EVER do, hack and slash. You have no options, no tricks up your sleeves (so to speak), you will never root a mob when it runs, you will never cast invisibility to undead and stroll into Unrest unhindered, you will never lay hands at the last second and turn the entire tide of what was just a second before a losing battle, you will never buff yourself, you will never cure someone's disease or poison DOT, you will never blind a mob and send it running, you will never wield The Fiery Defender.  However, you WILL be able to shell out damage like crazy and take a lot of punishment. Casters will love you to be their meat shield.<br><br>It all comes down to what expection you have.

A pali can at least cast healing spells and buff himself and get right back to fighting within a matter of minutes.  All the while that solo warrior is still sitting there wating for his hp to regenerate.  In a group setting, we are the secondary tanks who just so happen to heal the other tanks or the nukers who got aggroed upon.  Our Lay of Hands is the ace in the hole that can save your life when your soloing or the life of another when you are in a party.  I have made many freinds using that on them in the heat of battle and they are always grateful, giving me a tell when I am leaving "if you ever are looking for a party to group with I would consider it an honor for you to be in mine."

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Use training points wisely.&nbsp;&nbsp;What I did was to put only 1 point into each catagory that I had obtained (such as bash) and let the remaining points stack up by using your newly acquired skill during battle.  This way you can save up your points and place them into a skill such as Taloring, smithing, Jewlry, ect.  A word of advice that I later found out is whenever you get your first set of spells, immediatly put 1 training point into conjuration, channeling, evocation (rather the skills that magic is used for) it is very frustrating whenever you spend all your mana casting a basic cure spell and you waste mana on fizzes constantly leaving you oom and with little or no health left. Weapons wise it is easiest at your level to invest one hit point into all of them (1 handed blunt, 1 hand slash, 2 hand slash, 2 hand blunt, and hand to hand) purchase or loot yourself some cheap 1 handed blunt weapon (a splintered club cmoes to mind) and a 2handed blunt weapon (worn great staff) that have a low delay.  Interchange weapons till your skills are maxed, then resort back to your primary weapon.  Doesn't sound like fun but at Level 25+ there are some really great weapons that are out there that are blunt weapons.  I currently have my 2HS , 1HS, and Bash maxed out at all times and am working on my 1HB.  I generally carry alot of weapons on me genarally 3 at one time + a shield.<br><br>Blacksmithing is a very nice skill to have. It is very expensive to start out with, especially as a new player killing the lowly smakes and stuff.  I started blacksmithing when I had around 100pp saved up in the bank.  It may seem like your losing money left and right, but as your stats go up and your are able to make armor you can begin to make the money that you lost back up.  Blacksmithing is something that takes alot of time and becomes very tedious in the beginning as well.  I agree that Freeport is THE place to learn blacksmithing due to the fact that everything you need is right around the corner.  I agree that sharpening rusty weapons is the way to go, but if your cheap like me you wouldn't purchase them.  go out to the nwebie area and loot them (off the corpse of the moster you killed of course).  That way you gain exp, and save yourself some precious gold coin that you desperatly need for when you have to make metal bits.  Freeprt is the city I learned smithing at and it is the city that I go back to to increase my skill, you would think the Dwarven City of Kaladim would be the place for smithing (due to the fact that Dwarves are synonomous with smithing in every story that you've read) but this isn't true in Everquest.  It is possible to smith in the city but the neccesary molds and ores are spread out all over Kaladim and Butcherblock.  But now I am rambling so I'll stop now.<br>&nbsp;<br>Dadin <br>54th Cavalier<br>Honored Circle on Xev<br><br>Dwarven Thane<br>Hellwinds - Palomides </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>You are only able to invest up to 20 points in any trade skill (like blacksmithing and tailoring).&nbsp;&nbsp;For that reason, it is not very useful to invest your skill points in them when you can easily make those points through basic practice at the forge.  Just go buy a whole bunch of sharpening stones and rusty weapons.  Combine the stone and rusty weapon until you make a tarnished weapon.  Your skill will go up into the teens this way.  Once you cannot gain anymore skill in this fashion, start to make metal bits.  They require 2 pieces of small ore and 1 flask of water.  You will screw up alot at first, but you will notice your skill start to go up.  You will go past 20 by the time you master metal bits.  I've always tried to convince people that it might be more worthwhile to spend all of your skill points mastering one obscure language that nobody else knows.  There is no limit for language point investment (up to 200 anyway).<br><br>The best town to practice your smithing is freeport.  Everything you need is not too far away.  Groflah's forge in north freeport sells sharpening stones and bricks of ore.  You can buy water at a number of places.  If you are trying to make metal bits, just do it at the forge right outside of groflah's.  If you need rusty weapons to start out with, you can buy all you need from a shop in east freeport.  I forget the exact name of the shop.  The name has 'resales' in it.  Hallah's Resales.. or something like that.  It's a big sign, so you can't miss it.  Find the tanning/leather shop in east freeport.  There is an alleyway to the side of it.  Take the alleyway back until you see the rusty weapon shop.  Buy rusty daggers because they are the cheapest.  DO NOT go downstairs in this shop.  If you go down the stairs, a dog named scraps will come and whoop you unless you are something like level 20.  I was level 6 when I went down there.  I guess I should go back there now and get my revenge...  it took me 9 deaths to get my body out of harms way.  There is a forge in east freeport, next to the armor shop.  Using that is the quickest way to sharpen weapons.  If both of these forges are ever occupied, there is another forge in north freeport near the bank.  It's a pain to zone unneccesarily, but if you have to, it's there.  Just remember..  later on in your paladin's life, you will more than likely go KoS to the freeport militia.  At that point, your blacksmithing practice will come to an end (in freeport that is).  You will still be able to go to north freeport safely, but you will only be able to make metal bits at groflah's because they don't require any molds to make, like all the other items do.  I guess I should tell you that the molds can be bought at the building right next to the armor shop in east freeport.  Just look up one of the blacksmithing guides at this site, or elsewhere, to see what makes what and what skill you should be to make it.  I can't think of anything much on this subject.  I hope I was helpful.<br><br>Souldragoon Flamingheart<br>40th circle Paladin of Virtue<br>Fennin Ro<br><br>ps  If you play on Fennin, I'd be happy to help your blacksmithing out in the game.

Almost everything conns blue and white now, and fighting in a group in that zone seems no longer very feasable.  Where do I go from here?  I am contempating the trip to Freeport and hunting goblins in SolA.  Is this a good spot?<br><br>Also, concerning armor, what would be the next step up from bronze as I have almost a complete set now, I am missing a small bronze bracer and sleeves(vanbraces).  Will this be sufficient till I hit level 30 and begin aquiring Deepwater Armor and possibly Ro Armor? or should I augment it with something else?  I like the look but without my turtle helm and 2 +3str earing I wouldn't be able to wear it without being encumbered.  Mostly due to the fact that I weild a Axe of the Iron Back (primary weapon - was bought for the intention of increasing my 2hs skill which I started at lvl 19) and carry a Crystalized blade/Shiny Brass Shield combo in my primary inventory slots for use against magic caster's and also to keep my skills maxed in 1hs/bash.  It is not uncommon for me to almost double my carrying capacity (weight) in loot and coin, making the way back to the nearest city extremely slow going.  Any suggestions?<br><br>Btw, this is my first true character on Everquest and I do like the ability to melee and then heal/buff after a hard fight.  I plan on seeing my character through (Dwarve Paladian) till at least lvl 55+, I'm having loads of fun playing him and have never had any trouble getting in a group and meeting new ppl along the way.  <br>&nbsp;<br>Dadin <br>54th Cavalier<br>Honored Circle on Xev<br><br>Dwarven Thane<br>Hellwinds - Palomides </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ah, when i was lvl 25, i had just arrived in LoIO and got in a group immediatly, EXP WAS INCREDIBLE. Sarnaks are great exp, and ok loot. Personally i stayed there till 29, but you should till 27 i think. Than go to Frontier Mountains and hook up with a giant group, ok exp, GREAT LOOT. i stayed there till 32, 33 is good too. Than i went to unrest and got into a ghost group at lvl 33. INCREDIBLE EXP PLUS GREAT LOOT. also, you WILL make a lot of friends here if you go, ppl tend to saty in zone for 10+ hours in 2 or so days. Drops are FS weapons usually, Jagged bands occasionally, DWB's RARELY, words runes and cash almost always, Bronze armor sometimes. at lvl 35, i suggest staying in Unrest, but soloing at the blood pool. If you have a wurm, this isnt too risky, but with a ghoulbane, it is. GREAT EXP. Next Step, Velious or LOWER GUK. LGuk is pretty decent exp, but dangerous hehe. drops are GREAT. FS weapons, words runes, cash, RARE GOOD DROPS. first group i got into at lvl 36 was the ghoul supplier. stayed there for 4 hours, hit 37 at the end of the 3rd, got a Thick banded belt( ac 8, str+15!!!!!!, worth 10+k) at the end of the 4th. So, you may want to follow this guide or not, your choice.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>You should be able to group for mountain giants in the frontier mountains.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for upgrading your armor before getting ro..  most assuredly!  Bronze is quite heavy, and does take up weight which could be used to carry a heavier load of loot back to town.  There are a variety of peices you can purchase for relatively little (especially after selling the stuff that the mountain giants drop to vendors).  I used a charred breastplate until I got my ro one.  Serpentine bracers have about as much ac as bronze and you run faster because of the +9 agility.  Adomantite epolets are lighter and give wisdom, I believe.  Silver plated legs, lizardscale cloak, skull shaped barbute are all decent alternatives to bronze at your level.  I used to like the way bronze looked... until I started picking up all of these silver non-ro pieces.  I like silver better, now.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I took your advice and went to the Frontier Mountains and got into group killing Giants.&nbsp;&nbsp;Had a great time even though I was the lowest level in my group, I somehow managed to notdie the entire time I was there.  The loot is extremely nice there as well (averaged 3pp per loot and the occassional weapon that I picked up).  The Armor is something that I am working on still.  I completed my full set of bronze (weight allowance is now 99/109 unbuffed).  I look very good, and once I get more pp, I will start upgrading my armor as well.<br>&nbsp;<br>Dadin <br>54th Cavalier<br>Honored Circle on Xev<br><br>Dwarven Thane<br>Hellwinds - Palomides </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Sounds like the Lake has been very good to you! If you really want a challenge, you could move to Castle Mistmoore and begin fighting the dark elves and evil minions of Mayong Mistmoore!&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very challenging dungeon and one that you would need to group in to hunt effectively, but with a good group of 4+ at your lvl, you could really do some good there and easily stay hunting there for another 10+ lvls. Plus, while you are there you can gather important items for later Paladin quests, namely Mistmoore Granite needed to make Ronium for Ro Armor, and if you gain several more lvls, you could go after Xicotl himself and gain part of the Soulfire quest. Be warned though, Xicotl has LOTS and LOTS of hit points, (some say over 3000) and is a lvl 40 Shadow Knight and has a nasty harm touch!<br><br>Mistmoore is a very risky, exciting, eery feeling dungeon and one that can be most rewarding.<br><br>Kneesmasher Ayebulger<br>30th lvl Circle of Paladins<br>Twilight Brethren<br>&nbsp;<br>Kneesmasher Ayebulger<br>Dwarven Knight<br>Torvonnilous Server<br><br>"Never Mistake Kindness for Weakness"</td></tr>
