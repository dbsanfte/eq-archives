Seriously folks, every other class has been taking their crap for so long and it disgusts me.&gt;<br>Uhh... OK, it is obviously the CLASS which dictates character ingame, and not the person the character is an avatar for. Right.<br><br>&lt;Does it bother anyone else that these classes are so overplayed? Not to mention the fact that these classes are also used to level up easily to make money and then twink it to another character. I don't know but I hate these weeny classes and think that they deserve something very bad. &gt;<br>CivilChief, dear, you are missing the point while you make the point. The operative verb here, phool, is PLAY.<br><br>&lt;The people who play these classes never roleplay and generally cause problems amongst lower level characters. They are easy to suck up to and con into giving you money as a lowbie. Call it being nice but I call it being stupid. &gt;<br>Hmmm... &quot;never&quot; is such a big word. My drood, Ammanita (Ammy), tries to roleplay, but I am often pounded with &quot;What class are you?&quot; &quot;What level are you?&quot; - all too often followed by &quot;Can I get a SoW?&quot; or &quot;Can you port me to...&quot;. I spend a large portion of my ingame time helping others when and where I can. Roleplaying is not respected as it should be, so saying druids don't roleplay is stupid at best. As for being &quot;easy&quot;, well I rarely if ever give out money or twink others, but if I did, and pay attention here, It Is Mine To Dispose Of As I Will. Any part of that you don't understand? As for your calling such behavior stupid, well, that you may do. Everybody has their own internal definitions for words, and if your internal lexicon equates generosity to stupidity, well, OK.<br><br>&lt;Then there is the time that we SK's get ejected out of a group so some guy's druid &quot;friend&quot; who is only his friend cause of some cash changning hands, can join. &gt;<br>Sounds like a personal problem. Let us assume it was YOU who was ejected. From what and how you write, my money would be on - you were being a @#%^ and they wanted somebody compatible with the group, and useful (see response to Eidulon below). As for the &quot;money changning [sic] hands&quot; - no comment is possible.<br><br>&lt;. And let's think about this, do either of these classes really have any true uses at higher lvls? (Yes I'm prepared to get flamed here, but I am tired of these classes and the people who play them)Come on, shaman's buff better than druids, warriors can fight better than druids, and about rangers.. what the hell can they do? Dual wield and use some of the crappier druid spells. Oh I forgot, they have track, I guess we should all just bow down to them. &gt;<br>Hmmm... lessee, any use at higher levels? Well, I doubt that a group solely consisting of SKs could take, say, Tunare - not that MY drood would ever go up against Tunare. Be interesting to see. It is the diversity of the classes that make the game fun, and it is in diverse class grouping that makes grouping interesting, and fun. Betcha forgot about that part, fun.<br>No, don't bow down to them, but utilize their strengths to augment your weaknesses as a well-played druid or ranger would utilize your strengths to augment their weaknesses.<br><br>&lt;The point I am making is that these characters survive by the easiness of their classes so they can spread their money around to make 'friends'. &gt;<br>Nope, not a valid point at all, un-substantiable and pretty stupid in content.<br><br>&lt;Nothing makes me angrier than a weeny druid (or ranger) kiting some mob across a dang zone because they take too long killing it. Not only does it end up training to someone else when the stupid druid screws it up, but the mob's other friends show up and screw everyone else over in the zone. &gt;<br>Nope, Wrong. This is a perfectly valid and appropriate technique that is NOT Unique To Druids And Rangers. Bard Fear-Kiting comes to mind. No, what all too often happens is some idiot either doesn't pay attention to what is happening just steps in and breaks the kite instead of ASKING if help is needed, or some idiot tries to KS a MoB. Are all kites well controlled? No. Do 'innocents' die in the game? Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;BUt as a sweeping statement, very vapid, and not valid.<br><br>&lt;Well, I am finished.&gt;<br>I doubt taht very much.<br><br> &lt;I'm hoping for some allies in my argument (and war) against these two overplayed classes and I know there are many enemies out there. Sorry for the long rant&gt;<br>So, how do you _really_ feel about Druids and Rangers, huh? And, why the animosity?<br><br>Sadly, you miss the point. They are played because they are FUN. Well, my drood is, didn't like the ranger I had that much. Easy, well, yeah, sorta. But at 30 Ammy is less and less effective solo as a melee so I need to group more. And NO, this does not prove your thesis - it jsut means that the game is changing for me and I have to group more, which is one of the strengths of teh game. <br> <br><br><br><br>To quote Eidulon...<br>&lt;. <br><br>1. They can evac. Wizards can Nuke and evac. <br><br>2. They can buff. Shamans way out-buff druids, and way out-buff druids. (necros too) <br><br>3. They can heal. Clerics can way out-heal druids. &gt;<br><br>Yeah, but you get all this in ONE package. A drood makes a good backup healer, the healer to the primary healer for instance. Back up nuker too, the Planes help any summoned critter we go up against. And damage shield buffs. Melee sucks, droods get crap for weapons and armor. Yep. OK. Valid point and accepted (if not liked)limitation. But I like living by my brains rather than my brawn.<br><br>Actually, my REAL question to Civilchief ( who probably is neither), is: What the hell you doing starting this thread in a forum devoted to SKs? Talk about misplaced anger.<br><br>Hope you like walking, d00d.<br><br></p>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

Fact is that yes, dwoods way outnumber SK's and for several reasons some that you mentioned such as their ability to heal, DOT, DD, and port for plat, not to mention that they do perform so much better than SK's at soloing and can find mobs with their track so much easier, make great PLing char's etc, etc, but to hold that against them would mostly just be me admitting being envious of their abilities.<br>But like your comments my main hate for them is the number of times I have been trained by some dwood attempting to quad kite some mobs when it goes pear shape and they then &quot;sow&quot; or &quot;soc&quot; out of there and the mobs get trained onto other characters unaware, of such and then &quot;WTF&quot; whack whack whack &quot;wait please loading&quot;. Also when a mob been kited all of a sudden happens to be near me, looks down and thinks mmm BBQ Teir'Dal. I am envious of the way they have track and can find mobs in a few minutes that I can not find without running all over a zone and risking it, I hate the way I might attempt to camp Pyzin(sp) and wonder if the reason that I had no mob arrive at the ruins was because somebody with track KSed her from me. There are things that dwoods simply do better than SK's but to qoute the top of this forum &quot; the shadowknight is a complex class to develop and play correctly. &quot;<br>IMHO the dwood has more advantages than a SK when it comes to gaming for the sake of power, however some people like to play dwoods and some like I don't.<br>(Roleplay on -Yes I hate dwoods with a passion and hence do not play one, am guilded in an evil race only guild and have taken to refusing to group with a party that has a Dwood in it,(to my own disadvantage), most times- it is hard to find a group with no dwood in it :)<br><br>So whilst I agree with most things you stated and disagree with some others, at least your post wasn't a childish flame, such as those you recieved in reply.<br><br>Time to load up the Save VS Fire&nbsp;&nbsp;:)<br><br><br></p>&nbsp;<br>Miztress,&nbsp;&nbsp;Teir'Dal Knight of Innoruuk <br>I will confess that I look forward to the day when we have cleansed Norrath <br>of the koada'dal and carved their bones into little flutes for Teir'Dal children</td></tr>

If you are being realistic you know that not every Shadow Knight are role-players either, in fact, I don't think ANY class are totally role-played, there's always a bitch which says: "It's only a game, if I wanna twink I twink...get lost, losers.

Granted the HT is one of the most feared attacks on any PvP server but ask yourself, just how many PvP servers are there as aposed to those of us who play on the blue servers.<br><br>   Frankly i have played a multitude of race/class combinations and prefer the SK because it fits my more offensive style of play. I have also played a ranger and personally think they are horible till you get to the mid to late 30's, THEN they come into their own.<br><br>Second you state that SK's get the second highest HP's in the game, well here you wrongly assume that ALL SK's are trolls or ogres. I am one of the few, the proud, the Erudite SK. No i do not &quot;have the second highest HP's in the game&quot;<br><br><br>I get by because i use my unlimited mana pool and knowlege of my class to my advantage. Not some mythical advantage to my HP's.<br><br>Infact i know many rangers who have higher HP's than i on my server, and can kick everyone of their butts in the arena.<br><br>As for druids, i find a druid can be very usefull if you find one who knows what the hell they are doing. As someone said before they are a jack of all trades. They change the class hats as often as SK's change weapons, prolly more so.<br>How ever as a Melee class i do get ticked off at the majority of the druids who don't under stand IF THERE IS NO CLERIC IN GROUP DON'T NUKE YOUR MANA AWAY. Gets a bit anoying when you see the main druid healer say OOM and you are close to dieing yourself. Then they have the nerved to be pissed when you FD and watch them get their butts kicked.<br><br><br>But tiras, you need to learn that no, we are not &quot;all stupid ogres and trolls&quot; as my intelect is far superior to that which the ranger races could ever hope to attain.<br><br>&quot;Next time think before you act&quot;<br><br><br>I think thats fitting.<br><br>P.S. i miss 22% of the time. Also i get personal tells asking me to group, i never carry the LFG tag ever so popular on the FV server.<br><br><br>Talor Darkmoon<br><br>33rd season Dark Knight Of the fine city of Paineel<br>Master smith</p>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

I don't think that you should blame a druid/ranger due to you inadequacies at playing an sk. You dis rangers because you think that we are a weak class, well I would have to agree on some points we may be weak, but if you played a ranger and knew what you were talking about then you would know that a rangers utility is more than just stats. For example just last night I was in Burning Woods, I am now 46th but I was grouped with some friends 54th sk and 55th sk a 52 wizard, and another 44th wizard our cleric left the zone, did we all disband no.. I SoW'd we went to the giant fort and killed 12 giants in a row before we took a break, during that time the wizard gained agro and was down to his last bub of health, who saved em ... a ranger ... with a heal while one of the sk's gained agro again. After the fight we were down for mana but during that time I buffed the group and healed them. Sure you can say what you want about a ranger because thats your opinion, but obiviously you don't have the facts. As a person that has played both a ranger and sk to 40+ I can compare and probably know quite a bit more about what each can and can't do.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Dec&nbsp;&nbsp;4 02:59:05 2001</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Cannis 65th Ranger<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=69645" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=69645</a> <br><br></td></tr>
