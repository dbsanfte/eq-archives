</head>
<body>

<center><b><u><font size=+1>June, 2001</font></u></b></center>

<p>June 29, 2001:&nbsp; I'm repeating yesterday's request for voluntary
payments for those who don't scroll down, and because it bears repeating
and is important:&nbsp; If you can afford it, please make a voluntary payment
to cover your use of the site last month.&nbsp; Our expenses are even higher
this month because we bought an additional, dual processor server to try
to speed things up for you (it finally cleared customs and should be hooked
up next week -- whoohoo).&nbsp; Just click on this link and use Paypal,
the most trusted payment service on the web, to transfer over whatever
amount you feel is fair to cover your use of the site for the past month.&nbsp;
Or if you prefer snail mail, you can send a check to:&nbsp; Allakhazam.com,
P.O. Box 8035, Wilmington, DE 19803-0035.
<p>As many as 300,000 people use this site each month, with over 80,000
coming here every day, yet the number of people making voluntary contributions
numbers in the low hundreds.&nbsp; We generate more than 2 million page
views every day, and our bandwidth costs run close to $6,000 per month.&nbsp;
I know some of you spend a lot of time here.&nbsp; If you come here a lot,
check out the new items, read the thought for the day, post and read on
the forums, post and read comments, revamp your character's stats and use
any the other features we have developed, think about how much time and
effort goes into this and how much you enjoy using it and ask yourself
whether this is something you value.&nbsp; If it is, click here and make
a payment and let us know that you value our efforts.&nbsp; Even a small
payment really does make a difference.&nbsp; (Geeze, now I really am sounding
like PBS)
<p>OK enough sermonizing.&nbsp; Now for today's update.&nbsp; In addition
to Befallen, Cazic Thule, Velketor's Labyrinth and the Temple of Veeshan
seem to have gotten facelifts and upgrades, and some other zones have new
items and Mobs as well.&nbsp; Many of the items in Velketor's had their
stats upgraded.&nbsp; I'm correcting them as I get the new information.&nbsp;
Here are a bunch of new items for you:
<p>New Equipment:&nbsp;&nbsp; Enchanted Teir'Dal Chain Bracelet ;&nbsp;
Kelciferous' Armband of Artistry ;&nbsp; Mrylokar's Dagger of Blood ;&nbsp;
Feeliux's Cord of Velocity ;&nbsp; Pristine Studded Leather Gloves ;&nbsp;
Pristine Studded Leather Sleeves ;&nbsp; Bronze Sigil of T'Vyl ;&nbsp;
Ritualist's Gown ;&nbsp; Cast-Iron Mace ;&nbsp; Velketor's Spellbook ;&nbsp;
Wu's Fist of Mastery ;&nbsp; Breastplate of Eradication ;&nbsp; Spiked
Seahorse Hide Belt ;&nbsp; Imbued Mithril Studded Cloak (Tunare) ;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>June 28, 2001: We're coming up on the end of the month again.&nbsp;
That means it is time again to ask you to contribute by making a voluntary
payment for your use of the site.&nbsp; Our revenue is very low and our
costs are very high.&nbsp; Therefore, we need to rely upon your contributions
to keep the site up and running and continue to bring you up to date and
accurate information about the game.&nbsp; We understand that there are
people who use the site who cannot afford to pay for it, and that is why
we are trying to keep it free for everyone.&nbsp; If you can afford to
pay for it, please take a minute to consider all that you get out of the
site and what it is worth to you and make a payment accordingly.&nbsp;
Your payment is vital!&nbsp; How many of you went out and payed $20 for
the strategy guide only to find that you could find better and more accurate
information right here?&nbsp; Just because it is on the web and not sold
in stores does not make the information we provide any less valuable.&nbsp;
Making a payment is quick and easy.&nbsp; Just click on this link and use
Paypal, the most trusted payment service on the web, to transfer over whatever
amount you feel is fair to cover your use of the site for the past month.&nbsp;
Or if you prefer snail mail, you can send a check to:&nbsp; Allakhazam.com,
P.O. Box 8035, Wilmington, DE 19803-0035.
<p>The visitors to this site count in the hundreds of thousands, yet the
contributors number in the hundreds.&nbsp; Don't rely upon the other guy,
because he's relying upon you.&nbsp; Even a small payment really does make
a difference.&nbsp; Please do your part.
<p>OK on to the updates.&nbsp; I have a pile of new items that were found
in the revamped Befallen and Cazic Thule, plus the start of a new quest
series in Qeynos.
<p>New Equipment:&nbsp; Pristine Studded Leather Legs ;&nbsp; Robe of the
Primordial Ritualist ;&nbsp; Scepter of the Darkened Rite ;&nbsp; Hollowed
Koada'Dal Rib Cage ;&nbsp; Pristine Studded Leather Tunic ;&nbsp; A Guardian's
Dagger ;&nbsp; Veil of the Vortex Weaver ;&nbsp; Pristine Studded Leather
Bracer ;&nbsp; Grimy Lance ;&nbsp; A Servant's Blade ;&nbsp; Pristine Studded
Leather Boots ;&nbsp; Golden Sigil of T'Vyl ;&nbsp; Platinum Sigil of T'Vyl
;&nbsp; Investigator's Badge ;
<br>New Quests:&nbsp; Investigator's Badge No 1 ;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>June 27, 2001: For those of you who are interested, we have now opened
an Anarchy Online Site.&nbsp; On the scale of these things, the game seems
to have gotten off to a pretty good start.&nbsp; There's nothing wrong
with a little healthy competition to keep the Everquest folks hopping.&nbsp;
Other than that, just a small update today.
<p>New Equipment:&nbsp; Narandi's Lance ;&nbsp; Steelsilk Greaves ;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>June 26, 2001: I've been working all day on the Anarchy Online site
(must ... get ... site ... done), so I don't have any updates today.&nbsp;
Just a reminder that the EQ servers will be down tomorrow.&nbsp; Since
U.S. customs is still hanging onto our new server, apparantly in an attempt
to make sure we are not importing some sort of dangerous Canadian technology,
the site is bound to be excruciatingly slow tomorrow (nafta, what's that?).
<br>&nbsp;
<p>June 25, 2001:&nbsp; For those of you who have not yet read the Curt
Schilling or R.A. Salvatore interviews, I have put up links to them in
the editorial section.&nbsp; They have been scrolling down the news section
and thus have been harder to find.&nbsp; I'll continue to link future interviews
from there, and perhaps if I accumulate enough of them I'll create a separate
section for them (and I may just have another one heading your way in a
little bit).
<p>New Equipment:&nbsp; Vambraces of the Untamed ;&nbsp; Amcilla's Talisman
;&nbsp; Koada'Dal Mithril Collar (Tunare) ;&nbsp; Koada'Dal Mithril Gauntlets
(Tunare) ;&nbsp; Koada'Dal Mithril Girdle (Tunare) ;&nbsp; Koada'Dal Mithril
Paudron (Tunare) ;&nbsp; Koada'Dal Mithril Visor (Tunare) ;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>June 22, 2001: Today's update consists mostly of player-crafted items.&nbsp;
I hope everyone has a nice weekend.
<p>New Equipment:&nbsp; Glimmering War Axe ;&nbsp; Teir'Dal Adamantite
Vambraces (Innoruuk) ;&nbsp; Velium Amber Ring ;&nbsp; Velium Bloodstone
Earring ;&nbsp; Velium Carnelian Wedding Ring ;&nbsp; Velium Hematite Ring
;&nbsp; Velium Lapis Lazuli Necklace ;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>June 21, 2001: I just wanted to let you know that RPGwear has added
a couple of new T-Shirt designs and has changed around some of their prices.&nbsp;
Check out the cool new Shadowknight T-Shirt and the Minneapolis Fan Faire
shirt with the Luclin Box Art Design.&nbsp; They tell me that they are
working hard on putting together the other class designs (right now, they
only have the Druid and Shadowknight).&nbsp; Be sure to check out their
entire inventory of official EQ merchandise at this link.
<p>New Equipment:&nbsp; Face Mask of Bumblok ;&nbsp; Troubadour's Breastplate
;&nbsp; Troubadour's Helm ;&nbsp; Golden Star Chest Wraps ;&nbsp; Malevolent
Breastplate ;&nbsp; Amulet of the Storm ;&nbsp; Jaded Velium Ring ;&nbsp;
Velium Turquoise Bracelet ;&nbsp; Velium Opal Engagement Ring ;&nbsp; Velium
Onyx Bracelet ;
<br>Updated Quests:&nbsp; Bard Kael Breastplate ;&nbsp; Bard Kael Helm
;&nbsp; Monk Kael Tunic ;&nbsp; Shadowknight Kael Breastplate ;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>June 20, 2001: The quality of comments on the items has been dropping
alarmingly lately, so we've decided to do something about it.&nbsp; We
have changed it so that only registered users are allowed to post comments
on items (the other sections will still allow anyone to post).&nbsp; Once
you register, you can still post anonymously if you want, but we will know
who you are, and if you continue to post up inane and offensive comments
you will just be banned from posting.&nbsp; I really hate to do this, since
I much prefer to allow everything to be completely open, but after spending
several hours today deleting the offensive posts, I decided enough is enough.&nbsp;
As usual, a few idiots mess up things for everyone.
<p>Now for some good news.&nbsp; Thanks to your continuing voluntary payments,
we were able to purchase an additional, extra powerful, server for the
site (to go with the three we are already running on).&nbsp; It is going
to take another week or so to configure and install, but hopefully (knock
on wood) it will significantly speed things up.&nbsp; I know I can't be
the only one beating my head against the wall every time I click on a link
and have to wait for the servers to slowly grind it up for me.&nbsp; Of
course, every time we've added a new server, the traffic has just increased
to match it, but one can only hope this one will do it. :)
<p>New Equipment:&nbsp; Myga's Talisman ;
<p>June 19, 2001: I have a very nice update today -- lots of new items.&nbsp;
Hopefully, it will keep you busy for a little while.
<p>New Equipment:&nbsp;&nbsp; Gloves of Stability ;&nbsp; Choker of the
Wretched ;&nbsp; Imbued Field Plate Cloak (Rodcet Nife) ;&nbsp; Short Sword
of Yalrek ;&nbsp; Withered Leather Tunic ;&nbsp; Dabner's Stud of Introspection
;&nbsp; Gaudralek, Sword of the Sky ;&nbsp; Ancient Wurm Hide Robe ;&nbsp;
Vyemm's Left Eye ;&nbsp; Medal of Deep Thought ;&nbsp; Windraider's Belt
;&nbsp; White Lotus Headband ;&nbsp; Blood Lord's Vambraces ;
<br>Updated Quests:&nbsp; Monk Skyshrine Cap ;&nbsp; Shadowknight Skyshrine
Armplates ;
<p>Don't forget to do your shopping through our amazon.com link.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>June 18, 2001:&nbsp; I have another treat for you today.&nbsp; Many
of you probably know the works of R.A. Salvatore.&nbsp; If you don't, you
should!&nbsp; He's one of the finest science fiction/fantasy writers of
our times.&nbsp; He is also an Everquest player, and has agreed to answer
a few questions for me about Everquest and the art of writing.&nbsp; So
in the second of what I hope will be a continuing series of interviews
with celebrity Everquest players (assuming that I can track some others
down that is), I present An Interview with R.A. Salvatore.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>June 15, 2001:&nbsp; I hope those of you going to the fan faire in Minneapolis
this weekend have a great time.&nbsp; I'm not going to be at this one,
but hopefully I'll be able to make the next one, wherever that may be.&nbsp;
I have a couple of new quests in today's update.
<p>New Equipment:&nbsp; Unicorn Horn Fragments ;&nbsp; Poison Etched Wristband
;&nbsp; Blackstone Maul ;&nbsp; Koada'Dal Mithril Bracers (Tunare) ;&nbsp;
Koada'Dal Mithril Breastplate (Tunare) ;&nbsp; Koada'Dal Mithril Greaves
(Tunare) ;&nbsp; Koada'Dal Mithril Helm (Tunare) ;&nbsp; Shield of the
