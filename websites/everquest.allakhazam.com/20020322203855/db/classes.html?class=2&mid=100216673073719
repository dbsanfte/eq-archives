	   <tr><td colspan=2>BOO YA!&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, the great Tallicus is right!  I looked it up in the FAQ and found out that my little theory about the whole "scholar mystery" was correct.  User is the name given to anyone with a "karma" (average of all scores) lower than 3 and a scholar is anywhere from 3-3.5.  Then at 3.6 you become a "sage", then after a certain karma is reached you are a "guru".  I'm not sure on those numbers (actually I'm almost certain they are wrong), but you get the point.  Go to the FAQ (link at the very bottom of the page) to see the real numbers.<br>&nbsp;<br>"We are not hermits.&nbsp;&nbsp;We who would rather have a decaying corpse fighting at our side then to have you and your stench within a mile of us."  -Me on Necros...  there's a lot more but it's a sig.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>ACK! You certainly are back in business! Wow...you've almost convinced me barbs are the king. But I don't give that easily =P. First off, whatever I believe and say about races/stats for rogues, I am a complete idiot for not following my own advice. I first made a dwarf rogue cuz I wanted something better than a human but wanted him around the same area. Being the foolish newbie I was, I listened to idiots and the EQ manual's advice and put my stat points into mostly AGI and DEX. So my starting dorf rogue was 95 STR, 95 STA, 93 AGI, 107 DEX. My figuring was that DEX is the most important stat for rogues and that AGI was almost as important; so I thought I had a great well-rounded rogue with a head start in his best stat. Still believing AGI and DEX were the best stats, I proceeded to gobble up as many AGI and DEX items as I could find in auctions. I soon had 115 AGI and a very nice 147 DEX (untwinked, mind you). But my STR and STA were both only 98. Even with all these blunders, my rogue still kicks a*s over any other rogue of the same level I group with. If I had followed my preaching, I would own the world!! (or not). Anyway, you don't have to do anything to convince me STR is best for rogues; I've come to learn that and I'm trying to correct my errors and get STR items. The problem is I don't believe AGI is useful. In your calculation of barbs having 5 more points than dorfs, you include AGI. You suggest making AGI 92 just to match it with the barb's, but that's a whole 12 points wasted. What I WOULD do if I could go back and recreate Daviv (I don't wanna start another character right now...I hate newbies too much to be one again) is probably dump 15 into each STR and DEX and end up with 105 and 115. Oh, and you can't just dump all 30 points into DEX. You can put a maximum of 25 bonus points into any one stat. So I'm guessing you'd dump 25 into your barbie's DEX then 5 into STR, for 108 STR 105 DEX. In that case I'd match the dorf's STR to the barb's and put the other 12 into DEX, for 108 STR 112 DEX. I could even match the 95 STA and still have 107 DEX, just to show off. The AGI is still 12 less, but I don't worry about that. If I were going for even capability in offense and defense, I'd be all for Barbie dolls. But as it is I intend to make the best offensive melee unit possible, the dorf rogue. In the end though, 5 points (actually 7 points; in favor of the dorf) doesn't matter all that much. Just don't go DE anyone! Oh and thanks for the info on the karma. I never knew there was an FAQ before...now I've gotta thank you by rating you as Awf... I mean Excellent. ;)<br>&nbsp;<br>Daviv McD 28th Dwarf Rogue<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13233" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13233</a></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Here we go again.&nbsp;&nbsp;People always knockin' the Dark Elf Rogues.  Alright, we don't have the greatest Str but we DO have really good Dex.  Sure, I'm like you, I like to land backstabs for high damage constantly, so I put a good amount of my startin' points in Strength and the rest on Dex.  Granted, I'm no Barbarian or a Dwarf, so I did the next best thin'.  I invested in Strength items.  Fact is, they're easy to come by.  You try and tell me that Strength items are hard to come by and I'll laugh cuz you know it ain't true. Currently, my Strength with the items I just bought and the old stuff I have is around 120. I know another Genuine Dark Elf Rogue that has his Str at 171. Not bad at all.  Plus I have Ultravision, the Burnin' Rapier as a off-hand weapon, I don't have to go get the Mask of Deception, and I'm actually takin' the challenge of playin' a very difficult and fun character.  The only thin' I give to other Rogues is that their Stamina compared to DE's are godlike.  But if you're a smart Rogue you can get around that anyway. And on the subject of smarts, our Int is quite high, which helps us gain in many tradeskills as well as other Rogue skills.  And yes, Dex is the dominatin' factor but Int ALSO plays a role.  Takes me less time to max out my skills that most people. 'sides, I like bein' KoS in most places.  Makes me aware of thin's.  I find that fun.<br><br>Speakin' of fun, whatever happened to just pickin' what interests you?  On the real, I post and read these post to actually learn strategies about what I can do as a Rogue to better my abilities or how I can help other Rogues better theirs.  Instead people just knock races.  Forget that.  ANY Rogue is deadly, regardless of stats. It just gets to me. I do see where your comin' from.  And yeah the stats of Dwarves and Barbarians are great. But that doesn't mean that they automatically are better. That's like havin' a loaded gun.  Deadly in the hands of someone but if they can't aim and shoot right, guess what?  Ineffective.<br>&nbsp;<br>Formerly Ishkur D`Macbain<br>Now...Ishkur Leroux<br>Teir'Dal Dobluth<br><br>"So what if I stabbed him in the back.&nbsp;&nbsp;His back was to me!"</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>We aren't "knockin' races".&nbsp;&nbsp;We are letting the newbs know what races are better stat wise.  If you wanna say that DEs are the best rogues, fine.  I'll gladly call up the mental institute.  You do make a good point when you say that thing about the gun.  You can make a rogue (the gun) and put it into the hands of someone (the race) and if they can't aim or don't know how to shoot it, it's ineffective...  Who has the ability to aim/shoot the gun?  The person with the better stats, barbies and walking footballs...  Dwarves.  You have NO GROUND to argue that DEs are good rogues.  NONE, ZERO, ZILTCH, NADA, NILL, A NON-EXISTANT CLUMP OF MATTER!  The only thing that almost makes sense is that they are role-players.  That doesn't stand that well either.  It's kinda like saying that Canadians are more evil than Americans.  Simply not true.  Anyone can be evil and cruel.  A rogue is simply an outcast that believes that "supremeousy (I know that isn't the right spl) is important, not the way it is earned" or something like that out of the manual.  There is nothing that says that rogues are evil or that they have to be from an evil race...  Haha, no cookie for you!  Oh yeah, they changed the whole "blindness" of humans, barbies, and...  who else was blind?  Anyway, they changed it and someone thought it was a bug but then it turned out that they did it on purpose.  COOL!  No more of that "barbies are blind, hulking, idiots", now it's just "barbies are hulking idiots"...

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ok you just contradicted yourself NASTYLIKE.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's no wonder the other guys the scholar and you ain't.  First you're not knockin' races but you're knockin' races stats and you're sayin' that you'll call up the mental institute if I said that DE's are the best?  All that sounds like a complete knock to me.  Hell, just say that I suck for pickin' a Dark Elf instead of tryin' to be "subtle".  BTW, if don't matter if the gun is an AK-47 or a .45, or a .38, it's STILL DEADLY.  I DO have ground that Dark Elves are good Rogues because ANY race that can be a Rogue can be a good Rogue. I like my Dex, I like my Agility, I don't like my Strength so I WORK IT UP. Stick with your startin' stats and I'll stick with my skills and the thin's I use to correct the gaps I have and I'll get to 60 just like I'm hopin' you will.  Your definition of the Rogue is somewhat incorrect.  Refer to my post on that for further info.  It was NEVER about supremacy, merely deceit and mischief.  Supremacy is the Barbarian's outlook on Honor, no matter what the means are.  I didn't say they had to be evil.  E'en Fizzlethorpe's doctrine states that although they are deceivin', it's not necessarily meant for evil.<br><br>Last thin'.   About your Barbarians, Humans, and Erudites.  They're still blind.  The vision is improved just not as great as the others.  Nowo you CAN see your head in front of ya.  Hell, I'm glad they did that.  I still prefer infrared or ultravision but hey,to each his or her own. If you're gonna state your points about stuff, I don't mind the criticism, but hey, keep it real and don't drift off  Not meanin' to be rude but with that post I wasn't gonna take ya seriously.<br>&nbsp;<br>Formerly Ishkur D`Macbain<br>Now...Ishkur Leroux<br>Teir'Dal Dobluth<br><br>"So what if I stabbed him in the back.&nbsp;&nbsp;His back was to me!"</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I'm going to point out the obvious again...&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you looked at your karma?  Anyway, how did I contradict myself?  "Knocking" a race would be saying this, "DEs suck in every aspect of the game.  There is no reason to pick them.  They should be wiped off the face of Norrath."  I am not saying that at all.  I am saying that their starting stats suck.  Admit it man, they do.  Sure, they're cool lookin.  I would die many times over to have my Ry'gorr look like it does on a DE.  Great RPers.  In some people's perspective, yes, they are great for RPing (not in mine, but you know that already).  I think that there are reasons to pick any race out there.  I just point out the stat differences to the newbies that say, "Hey, this guy looks awsome!  He'll make a perfect rogue!".  When I made my first guy, I didn't even know the consept of stats.  I hadn't even played any of the other "MMORPGs".  Ok, no more, I am tired of arguing about this.  Srry for any missunderstandings and I will tone down the posts that just repeat.  Hope we're cool on this.  Like I said before, I agree with a lot of things you say so I won't put you on my "Hate these people for eternity" list.  I know that doesn't matter to you, but anyway.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hey it's good ol' Ishkur! I knew you'd show up eventually. I've been purposely knocking on DE's to try and get you to say something. It's not just strength that DE's lack; total up the stats any way you like and DE's come last. And like Tallicus keeps sayin' you take all your STR items to get up to what dorfs and barbs START at, and we'll take the same value of stuff and buff DEX, STR, or whatever to totally humiliate you. So what if my Dorf has only like 63 INT, not 100 or whatever the DE's have? Saying "Dex is the dominatin' factor but Int ALSO plays a role." is like talking about making a WIZ and saying "Int is the dominatin' factor but Dex ALSO plays a role." It really doesn't. All my skills are also easily maxed; especially my combat skills cuz my DEX is 156. Plus I got infravision, which was good enough for me until I took the fun and very profitable trip to LGuk to get a mask of deception. I really didn't feel like I "had to" go get myself a mask; it was like a quest that was actually more fun than most of the ones programmed in. There are a coupla points you have that I can't argue with, however. Those being that a DE rogue is a challenging character and is KOS everywhere. If that's what floats yer boat..And I want to make sure that no one reading my posts thinks that I'm trying to push ONLY my way and that you can't have fun any other way. I'm simply pointing out the best way to start. To put it your way, even a master sniper has his limitations when he's handed a water pistol.<br><br>Daviv McD &lt;Fearless Empire&gt;<br>26th Dwarf Rogue<br>Xegony<br><br>P.S.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Heh, glad that I get so much attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;I got the hint but school's been bustin' my ass. First off, you keep bringin' up numbers so much it feels like I'm in math class. Understood, other classes are gonna have more total points than us which makes us have to be cautious as to what we pick as well as what we do.  I can deal with the humiliation.  Take a Barbarian Rogue and a Dark Elf Rogue.  Just because Barbarians are bombed with Strength and such doesn't make that Rogue so efficient.  Personally it's like thinkin' with your brawn and not your brain.  I know how it is because I've been along-side those type of Rogues and they'll always prefer me.  Why?  Efficiency.  Side note, I do like to fit through the doors.<br><br>By the way, I see the analogy about the Wizard but that doesn't apply because well, Wizard's barely fight.  Intelligence is based on learnin' as well as castin' spells.  Rogue's skill takes the Rogues Dexterity in most cases and Intelligence in others and bam!  You got somethin' goin' there. And although you ain't pushin' ONLY your way, you're pretty much tellin' ev'ry Dark Elf Rogue out there that they basically are skarred.  Wrong.  Know how I see my Dark Elf Rogue?  My Dark Elf Rogue is like Doug Flutie.  Small, surrounded by overpowerin' mobs, but in spite of that fact, a winner.  If you rely on stats, that's cool.  Keep your Drew Bledsoe. But just cuz a Dark Elf is lackin' in many thin's doesn't mean it automatically sucks.  Nice post, still gonna hit ya back with it though.  <br>&nbsp;<br>Formerly Ishkur D`Macbain<br>Now...Ishkur Leroux<br>Teir'Dal Dobluth<br><br>"So what if I stabbed him in the back.&nbsp;&nbsp;His back was to me!"</td></tr>
