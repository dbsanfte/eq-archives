But I seen that there are still some peeps in need of advice for their Warriors. I am sorry but I will not likely respond to any questions you may have, so please just make best of this that you can. Read on and good luck to you on your adventures....<br><br>p.s. The stats on the chars may look a wee bit messed up (but they are in order) so you will just have to count and make sure you have the correct place for the number as for the stat. Should not be hard for the avergae Warrior mind to comprehend....:)<br><br>What it is to be a true warrior.<br> Hail and well met. I am Magamus Bloodrain, I am one of the many warriors of the &#8220;Screaming Fist&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to thee with knowledge on how to be a &#8220;true warrior&#8221;.<br><br>Lets start out with picking a race. Here is a list of the starting stats you will have if you choose to be a warrior. Notice they differ with different races. The &#8220;extra points&#8221; are there for you to ad to a stat of your choice.<br><br>                STR     STA     AGI     DEX     WIS     INT     CHA     Extra points <br>Barbarian 113      105        87       70         70       60        55          23<br>Dark Elf    70        75         90         75         83      109       60          30<br>Dwarf       100      100        75         90         83       60        45          25<br>Gnome      70         80        90         85         67        98       60           25<br>Half Elf     80         80        95         85         60        75       75           25<br>Halfling     80         85       100        90         80        67      50            25<br>Human      85         85         80        75          75       75       75            25<br>Iksar          80         80        95         85          80       75       55            25<br>Ogre         140       132       75         70          67       60       37            25<br>Troll         118       119       88         75          60       52       40            25<br>Wood Elf  75         75       100        80          80       75       75            25<br><br>Now lets take a look at what these stats are responsible for.<br><br>Strength: (STR) affects your maximum damage cap, the average damage you do and how much stuff you can carry. It also affects how fast you learn offensive skills. It also affects your &#8220;attack rating&#8221; (ATK) which is thought to help you land your attacks more often. This is a good stat for the warrior. There have been many that start a character over because they found out later that they did not have the muscles to carry plate armour, weapons and loot without being &#8220;encumbered&#8221; (going past your weight allowance) which will lower agility (AGI) and thus lower armour class (AC)  which means you will get hit more often, and take more damage when hit. So make sure you have a decent amount of strength, after all, you are a warrior right?<br><br>Stamina: (STA) affects how long you can breath under water without having to come up for air. It also affects how long you can battle for. Swinging that big arse axe of yours can tire ye out. Note: a funny thing about STA, if you jump a few times it will drop your STA bar like it aint nothing. Last but not least, it is the stat that adds hit points (HP) to your &#8220;total HP count&#8221; every time you level up.<br><br>Dexterity: (DEX) affects how hard you hit with your bows, how fast you learn weapon skills, and how often a magic weapon will process it&#8217;s effect. This also affects how often you will score critical hits (CRITS) and crippling blows (CRIPS)  (Note: &#8220;crippling blows&#8221; are pretty much &#8220;critical hits&#8221; that happen while you are in &#8220;berserker mode&#8221; which is when you reach 2 bubs of health and lower). Note: DEX has been thought to affect how often you land blows with melee weapons, but this is not so. ATK and weapon skills affect how often you land blows.<br><br><br><br>Agility: (AGI) affects how often you get hit or missed by an attack (melee) and how much damage you take when you get hit (Note: AGI ads a small bit to AC, so this is why it takes away damage directed towards you). It also affects how fast you learn defensive skills.  Since this affects if you get hit and how much damage you take it is a good stat for warriors and casters (or hybrids like a Paladin) because it will make you have a less chance of having your spells disrupted. <br><br>Intelligence: (INT) affects either the chance of raising up in a skill (such as Fletching) or the chance of making a successful attempt (actually making an item) at creating something using a skill (such as Fletching) (INT and WIS are both worth the same thing to a warrior. Nothing)<br><br>Wisdom: (WIS) affects either the chance of raising up in a skill (such as Fletching) or the chance of making a successful attempt (actually making an item) at creating something using a skill (such as Fletching) (INT and WIS are about worth the same thing to a warrior. Nothing)<br><br>Charisma: (CHA) affects how good of deals you get at vendors when buying and selling. That is it for that one. You will not care after you level up a bit because you will be selling good items to players and trashing (or giving away) the rest.<br><br>Deity: The choice of deity affects how non-playing characters (NPC&#8217;s) will view you.  In general good citizens like people who worship good gods, and vice versa.  This factors into the prices you pay at the stores, the quests you are given, and the willingness of guards to come to your rescue.  When choosing a god, think how it will affect your role- playing.  Certain class/deity combinations are killed on sight (KOS) in some towns.  A rogue who worships the goddess of love will probably face ridicule at the local thieves guild and have a hard time convincing someone to train him. On the other hand, a wizard who worships chaos will probably find few friends in the more civilized cities.  This is not an unimportant choice.<br><br>In my opinion, I think this is the order of importance on stats, but you are the one creating your character. STR, STA, AGI, DEX. If you choose a character with high STR and STA such as an ogre, troll or barbarian, then I would say this order, AGI, DEX, STR, STA.<br>Keep in mind, although we do &#8220;hack and slash&#8221; deal out damage, we are meant for taking damage (hence the word &#8220;tank&#8221; or &#8220;meatshield&#8221; which you will become familiar with) So you may want to think of what stats are most likely to keep you alive longer and also let you pound on some mobs. Also keep in mind that we warriors are not going to be the ones dishing out the most damage, so just deal with it. It is your job to keep that girly man in the dress alive so he can twiddle his thumbs and make things go BOOM.<br><br><br>Now lets take a look at what certain races have to offer you as a warrior.<br><br>Barbarian: The barbarian starts off in the city of Halas, in the frozen Northlands. <br>Barbarians (along with Ogres and Trolls) get the ability to &#8220;slam&#8221; which is the same as bash (you can stun a mob and cause it to not cast its spell and also cause it to not be able to run) but you do not need to use a shield to do so. You can &#8220;slam&#8221; while using a 2 handed or two 1 handed weapons. Slam is very important to train and keep it maxed Barbarians are also the only race that has the ability to wear large or medium armour (medium cost less to buy) Barbarians are tall and may find some trouble fitting in certain areas or through doors that were made for Dwarves, Gnomes or some types of Elfs. Barbarians do not have any special seeing ability. They do, however, look cool with their blue war paint that most of them have on. Barbarians are a good a good race.<br><br>Dark Elf: The epitome of evil, Dark elves start out in the underground city of Neriak. The dark race can see in the darkness as well as the light, and has the innate ability to hide from their foes. Being a dark race, however, has its problems. They are KOS (killed on site) to most cities in the game, hence the word &#8220;difficult&#8221; you will be prompted with when you choose this race. Dark Elfs wear medium armour. Dark Elves are an evil race.<br><br>Dwarf: (My personal choice) Dwarves start off in Kaladim, on the continent of Faydwer. At home in the mines, dwarves see very well (not as good as the Dark Elf though) at night. Dwarves also do this cool tuck and roll when they jump. Since they are small they will have no trouble fitting into tight places, but they do have trouble seeing a mob coming if a small hill is between them. Dwarves start off with their sense heading (inner compass if you will) at 50, so they are good at telling what direction they are facing. Dwarves wear small armour (the cheapest to buy) Dwarves are a good race.<br><br>Gnome: Gnomes start off in Ak'Anon, which is located at the far end of the continent of Faydwer. As a subterranean race, gnomes can see very well in the dark.  Gnomes are also the only race to get the tinkering skill, letting them make some nifty, even if mostly useless, trinkets. Gnomes are a small race so you will not find it hard to move in and out of tight places. You will, however, find it difficult to see mobs over even some of the smallest hills. Gnomes wear small armour. Gnomes are a good race (unless you choose to be a Necromancer).<br><br>Half Elf: Half elves start off in Freeport or Qeynos/Surefall. Half Elves are considered a good race.  Not quite accepted by wither race, half elves inherit traits from both of their parents.  From their elven parents, they gain infravision and thus can see well in the dark.  Yet they retain much of the hardiness of their human heritage, and are thus stronger and sturdier than most elves. Half-Elves can only wear medium sized armour.<br><br>Halfling: Halflings start out in the city of Rivervale, which probably has the nicest of all the newbie areas.  Halflings are considered a good race and are welcomed in the good cities of Norrath.  Halflings are also able to see well in the dark, and have the inate ability to hide and sneak.  Of all the races, halflings tend to level the fastest. I belive they can only wear small armour. I am a Dwarf and bigger then a hafling and I can only wear small armour myself.<br><br>Human: Humans can start either in Freeport or Qeynos/Surefall.  Humans get the most choices of classes, are one of only two races that can play a monk (the other being an Iksar), and level faster than most other races.  However, they suffer from lesser overall starting stats.  A human can  play any class except the Shaman.  Humans are considered a good race, unless they pick an evil class.  Humans cannot see the dark, and need a light source when going out at night.  Other than halflings, no other race levels as fast as a human. Humans can only wear medium armour.<br><br>Iksar: The Iksar are the only race that starts in the continent of Kunark, starting in the city of Cabilis.  The lizard people are hated by both the good and evil races in the rest of the world and have a lot of difficulty playing outside their starting continent.  Overall, they get very nice stats. The Iksar has the inate ability to forage, has infravision, and has the very nice ability to regenerate at a rate of 3 hp per tick. They a also get a bonus to swimming (100 at creation I believe) I believe they wear only medium armour,  a lot of items in the game (armour and such) can&#8217;t be wore by Iksars. So you will have to look in different places to find armour that you as an Iksar can wear.<br><br>Ogre: A powerful race, Ogres start off in the city of Oggok.  Ogres are fighters by trade and can only play a shadowknight, shaman or warrior.  They are the strongest and most naturally powerful of all the races.   Considered an evil race, Ogres are killed on sight in most cities of Norrath.  Many players who play ogres like to talk in broken speech, so be forewarned when trying to communicate with your fellow players. Ogres (along with Barbarians and Trolls) get the ability to &#8220;slam&#8221; which is the same as bash (you can stun a mob and cause it to not cast its spell and also cause it to not be able to run) but you do not need to use a shield to do so. You can &#8220;slam&#8221; while using a 2 handed or two 1 handed weapons. Slam is very important to train and keep it maxed. Ogres also have a added bonus of not being able to BE stunned by mobs (melee only) that attack them from the front. Ogres can only wear large armour.<br><br>Troll: Trolls, like Ogres, are innately powerful fighters with a high strength and stamina.  They start off in the city of Grobb, far south in Antonica. Trolls have the innate ability to regenerate damage, gaining 2 hp per tick.  As an evil race, they are killed on sight in most cities.  Like ogres, players who play trolls like to speak broken english. Trolls (along with Barbarians and Ogres) get the ability to &#8220;slam&#8221; which is the same as bash (you can stun a mob and cause it to not cast its spell and also cause it to not be able to run) but you do not need to use a shield to do so. You can &#8220;slam&#8221; while using a 2 handed or two 1 handed weapons. Slam is very important to train and keep it maxed. Trolls can only wear large armour.<br><br>Wood Elf: The wood elf is the earthier of the two-elven races, and more of a fighter than a caster of magic&#8217;s.  They start in the tree city of Kelethin over the Greater Faydark.  Because of their connection to the woods, all wood elves are able to forage for food and hide from their enemies. Wood elves also have excellent eyesight and can see in the dark. Wood elves can wear BOTH small and medium armour.<br><br>Now lets take a look at some of the abilities we get as Warriors.<br><br>Critical hits: This can start happening at level 12. This will allow you to land hits (automatically) of up to 2x your normal damage.<br><br>Crippling blows: This is a &#8220;critical hit&#8221; that happens when you are in &#8220;Berserker frenzy&#8221; see &#8220;berserker frenzy&#8221;<br><br>Berserker frenzy: When you get low on health (2 bubs or lower) you will be stronger than usual. If you happen to land a &#8220;critical hit&#8221; it will be converted into a &#8220;crippling blow&#8221; which can reward you with attacks of up to 4x your normal damage.<br><br>Magic resistance: We do not have any magical powers but we have learned to build a defense (no surprise there, we are indeed the best classJ) for magical attacks. We get 1 extra point &#8220;sv magic&#8221; every 2 levels we grow.<br><br>Now lets take a look at &#8220;disciplines&#8221; and what they do and when you get them.<br><br>Evasive: Becomes available at level &#8220;52&#8221; Duration time is 3 min and recycle (how long it takes before you can use it again) time is 15 min. Effect: The warrior is hit by his opponent less often but also will hit his target less often.<br><br>Charge: Level &#8220;53&#8221; Duration time is 14 seconds and recycle time is 30 min. Effect: When using this discipline the warrior will automatically land all attacks against his opponent.<br><br>Mighty strike: Level &#8220;54&#8221; Duration 10 seconds and recycle 60 min. Effect: When using this discipline all landed attacks will automatically be either Critical Hits or Crippling Blows.<br><br>Defensive: Level &#8220;55&#8221; Duration 3 min and recycle 15 min. Effect: The warrior will take less melee damage but also will deal less. This only affects &#8220;melee damage&#8221; nothing else.<br><br>Furious: Level &#8220;56&#8221; Duration 9 seconds and recycle 60 min. Effect: When using this discipline the warrior will automatically riposte every attack landed by the opponent.<br><br>Precision: Level &#8220;57&#8221; Duration 3 min and recycle 30 min. Effect: The warrior will have a greater chance to hit his target but will also have a greater chance of being hit.<br><br>Fell strike: Level &#8220;58&#8221; Duration 12 seconds recycle 30 min. Effect: All hits landed by the warrior will be for at least 4x the base weapons damage.<br><br>Fortitude: Level &#8220;59&#8221; Duration 8 seconds recycle 60 min. Effect: The warrior cannot be harmed by &#8220;melee&#8221; attacks. Magical attacks are not affected at all.<br><br>Aggressive: Level &#8220;60&#8221; Duration 3 min recycle 27 min. Effect: The warrior will do more damage with every blow landed but will also take more damage as well.<br>Now lets take a look at when some of our skills cap (will no longer progress as you level)<br><br> LVL	 TRAINING	 PRE-50 MAX	POST-50 MAX<br>--	Defense	210	252<br>--	Offense	210	252<br>1	1-H Blunt	 200	250<br>1	1-H Slash	200	250<br>1	2-H Blunt	200	250<br>1	2-H Slash	200	250<br>1	Archery	200	240<br>1	Kick*	149	210<br>1	Piercing	200	225<br>1	Taunt	200	200<br>1	Throwing	113	200<br>5	Bind Wound**	100	210<br>6	Bash	200	240<br>6	Dodge	140	175<br>10	Parry	200	230<br>13	Dual Wield	200	240<br>15	Double Attack	205	245<br>25	Riposte	200	225<br>35	Disarm	200	200<br>60	 Triple Attack	--	 ?<br><br>                            The &#8220;kick&#8221; skill will also be able to stun after level 55.<br>                            The &#8220;bind wound&#8221; skill (after level 60 at skill level of 201)<br>                            will heal up to 70% of your life.<br></p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>
