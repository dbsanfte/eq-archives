	   <tr><td colspan=2>I've rarely ever kited. Most of the time I am partnered, so we end up using root/nuke technique (since he is a mage). The only time I've really kited is when pulling, if I stop to DD it or DoT on its way. <br><br>Have you tried fear kiting? We can do this with animals, like lions. snare it, cast panic animal and run after it killing it. You can use befriend animal on a green kitty (last longer on greens. I had befriend last seemingly AGES on a kitty once. it was cool), snare the one you want, cast fear and tell pet to attack, DoT it with Swarm, then run after it DDing until it dies. Recast fear as needed. <br><br>Oh, one idea. I have found this incredibly useful soloing Kobolds, who hit hard for thier lvl. Cast your Stinging Swarm DoT as soon as you snare. This will do damage until it wears off. If you are snaring and not rooting, don't use Cascade of Hail, and they will end up moving out of range of the damage.<br><br>Just some ideas.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I just started a Wood Elf Druid about 2 weeks ago, she is now level 20 and parked in LOIO. I have taken her along the same journey as my Ranger. I do not know if this will help or answer your question. lvl 1-12 I did in GFay and Crushbone, I did the pixie dust quests, the batwing quest, and the Crushbone belts. at 12 I ventured over to Oasis, and was snatche dup in a group the day I arrived...fighting yellow caiman and crocs, I stayed there until level 20, returned to kelethin after getting my first port spell sin West Commons..got rest of my spells then hopped the boat to Firona Vie, Camo'd and ran to LOIO. I will stay there till about 30 or 31. there are many things you can snare kite there, or believe me if playing healer is your thing, groups will snatch you up, for fast experience all you have to do is keep em healed. From LOIO, I plan to hit Frontier Mountain till around 34...then I will be off to Rath Mountain,,,for Hill Giants, while experience is steady..it is not the best, but money can be made quickly from them , cuz we all know how expensive Druid spells are to obtain, and lets face it, if you port all day long, you are not enhancing your other skills, such as defense, offense, and weapons, alos for a twist, level 29 is a good time to venture to velious and learn how to quad kite, by taking on the Tizmarks there, start with one...and work your way up to four..will help you get out of that level 35 hell quickly...smiles....just my humble opionion, I am following my Rangers path. Hope that helped in some small way...and just wanted to say everyone seems so knowledgable on Druids, this site has helped me in figuring out some of the difference in Rangers and Druids, get use to Track it can become an invaluable tool...<br><br>Senzimil (Krystline) Druid of 20th Season/Ranger of 40th<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>On question 1, I have no clue. :)<br><br>On question 2, I personally loved Stonebrunt. If you are a caster, getting here is not so bad. If you are a druid pre-greater camo, I suggest travelling there with another caster class, since you will not be able to recast camo inside the Warrens. Unless you want to fight your way through the warrens, camo/invis is a must. <br><br>Getting there from Paineel is not difficult for goodies. There is only one place you have to worry with guards. And, unlike, say DE guards, they have a small agro radius. If you run straight out the middle of the cave and don't stop, you should be fine. Get a bind before doing it first, though. Just in case.<br><br>Because I'm mid-teen, over-crowding wasn't an issue. It looked like MOST of the younger, atleast on Quell, in the zone where early 20's. Not many teens at all. Since it is set up on Warren's loot rules, if there are only a few your lvl,&nbsp;&nbsp;you won't have alot of competition hunting mobs your lvl.<br><br>For higher lvls? I don't know. When I was on, lag wasn't too bad. I had the occassional pause, but nothing that caused death/lostkill/LD. And you have to bear in mind, I'm on dial up.<br><br>At any rate, if you are hunting Kobolds, the spawn rates are set pretty quick for the individual camps, and there are wanders that ranged from blue to red for lvl 16. <br><br>I haven't hunted anything besides Kobolds there yet. I want to get my heretic faction above KoS. I also have a secret goal of getting my faction high enough that the erudite npc's who wouldn't sell to me when I was lvl 6 will kiss by boots. ;)<br><br>Loot on the Kobolds is incredible. In one night, we ended up with 3 totems with wis and int bonus, can't remember name, and almost a full set of bamboo armor, and about 1/3 set of blue wicker armor. You can also loot weapons that sell well, even to the merchants. No silly rusted for them :)<br><br>As a druid, you ain't no Erudite, so you will be Indifferent to the kitty people. They have a cute town and are cute. If someone could tell me if our charm line will work on them. I just think it would be neat to come there in 10 lvls or so and make a pet out of one :) <br><br>Now, I won't say that the Kobolds undercon. To me an undercon is either a caster that can REALLY hurt you, like, oh, Basklisks, or something that has WAY more hit points than it should.<br><br>I'm used to orcs, so I am used to things that can hit hard. Orcs also double hit, and I think the 'bolds do too. They don't seem to have more HP than they should. And the shaman spells don't seem to hurt like they used to. :)<br><br>Still, a blue can take you down if you aren't careful. But, then, it is nice to fight a blue that isn't an easy kill for a change. <br><br>Ofcourse the greatest thing about this place for a woodelf druid:<br><br>Never seeing<br><br>an Elven Slave casts a spell.<br>on Orc Slaver feels better.<br><br>*wink*<br><br>Have fun.<br><br>Tatiyanna<br>Mommy Druid of Ravensveil<br>...<br>"Um, tell me again, why are we killing these guys?"<br>"What, NOW you ask? Like it's ever mattered before!"<br>...<br><br>&nbsp;<br>"In waking a tiger, use a very long stick." -Mao Tse-Tung. Did he go to Stonebrunt too?</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Alright, I can agree whole heartedly with point one. I can't state an opinion on point 2 because I've never had to deal with Verant directly.<br><br>I say go for it. The game is great, and the people who play it are, for the most part, great. I haven't regretted getting the game. I enjoy the interaction with people that I would otherwise never get to meet. Like, oh, my guildmate in Japan.<br><br>Things I like best about this game:<br>1. People. Like I said, you will meet all kinds of people you otherwise wouldn't. Most will be very helpful, giving buffs, binds and ports. Some even give away items they don't need any more.<br>2. Places. This is a very detailed world. I really like new zones they add because you can see where they figured out about elaborating. <br>3. Politics. Faction alliances give you a political depth to the game. If it is your style, you could probably play the game based just on getting your factions where you want them to be in each city.<br>4. Quests. There are lots of little quests that are great to do as you go along. They are basically extra xp and money for your kills. There are also some larger quests that are just great in what you get from them and while doing them. Like he said, you can replay these over and over. So, if there is a quest you really like, you can play it as often as you want.<br>5. Simplicity. You don't HAVE to purchase the expansions to play. These days, the game is inexpensive to buy. You get the trial month. blah blah blah. <br>6. GM's. My experiences with the GM's has been good. They help when they can. I've had a couple of instances where the GM's couldn't help. I've had a others where they could help, but they were back-logged and it took a while. And I've had a few where they helped almost right away. I've run into GM's doing...I have no idea what, but it was in Nek, and I was praying that it wasn't heralding an event...and they were very polite.<br>7. Events. I haven't been able to participate in one, but they happen. There are also player-formed guilds who will create their own events and raids. "newbie guilds" have started (we are one), which (not meaning to toot my own horn) I think is a good idea. <br><br>There are a few things I don't like.<br>1. People. Once in a while, you will run into someone who will totally ruin your night, or part of it. Be it rudeness, bullying, camp-stealing, or kill stealing (it won't take you long to figure out what those last two are) or people like, oh, me a couple of posts down, who were reacting to bad days (i apologize again, and most of those will too).<br>2. Response time. Sometimes the GMs are way too overloaded and there are too few of them. Response times can be really slow<br>3.<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Lag. You'll get it, and sometimes it will hurt. Sometimes servers go down. But then, this is an online game, and part of a technology that is still being perfected. Really, it doesn't happen enough to spoil my fun<br>4. Events. Okay, there are alot of events that it will be a while before I can participate. Sucks, but when I think about it, there isn't a whole lot for a lvl 50+ to do. Let them have the events. Also there are some quests that will require the expansions. Really, they don't come until sometime after lvl 20, and they aren't anything you HAVE to do. It certainly won't detract from enjoyment if you don't do them. So, get the expansions when you want. The quests will still be there.<br><br>IMO, you will enjoy this game more than you will get frustrated. Even my fiance has learned to enjoy the game, and he got really frustrated and almost quit it at first.<br><br>Experiment with classes. I suggest Druid of whatever race for first class. I like elves the most, but I just like elves and fairy-kin. You might like another race more. Druids are the easiest to start with, I think. Experiment with classes and races,though, and decide what you like.<br><br>If you are on Qeullous, then give me a /tell<br><br>Tatiyanna<br><br>&nbsp;<br>"In waking a tiger, use a very long stick." -Mao Tse-Tung.

As to why you bring in more than one mob when you pull after you harmony, you can't attack the one you harmonied first. This will break harmony on all the mobs.

Mez can be used to stop the mob in the middle of a battle (unlike harmony, which just makes the mob laugh if it is attacking you. Seriously.) I know, I did try it once to see if it would work.<br>3. If you Mez one of 2 social mobs in a camp, it will pull the unmezzed one. Harmony is AoE, so it will get the mobs immediately around whatever target harmony is cast on. Also, it is not considered aggressive, so even mobs not affected do not immediately agro.<br><br>I thought I would mention that for any who are new to druids and haven't gotten up to harmony yet, or had a chance to use it.<br><br>Tatiyanna<br>..<br>You tell the group, "I hate rangers!"<br>Svendar tells the group, "Why?"<br>You tell the group, "Because these stupid gobs are RANGERS!"<br>...<br><br>&nbsp;<br>"In waking a tiger, use a very long stick." -Mao Tse-Tung.

MAYBE THE FRIGGIN CON SYSTEM YOU SHOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD AT LEVEL 1.<br><br>Now lets say you pick a mob and click the track button... now at the bottom of your text it reads 'MoB Goober is ahead and to the left'... now lets take a wild guess where you have to go to find that mob... hmm... MAYBE AHEAD AND TO THE LEFT.<br><br>And as for your SoW, you posted this on the druid messege board offering a free SoW. Druids get SoW at 14, which you should know since you claimed to have tracking, which we get at 20. So any druid who knew how to work tracking from use would thus have to be level 20 and would already have SoW him/herself.<br><br>You know, when i read the Tweety rant were she made fun of peoples stupid questions i laughed but couldn't recall anyone on EQ who i had seen ask one. Now i have.<br><br>Now will give you begruding credit for your two honest questions in that post. <br><br>Using normal tracking the mobs at the top are USUALLY the closer ones, however it does factor in the Z axis in determining distance, and some zones are quirky, so it isn't always true and it's rarely exact, since it forms that list when you click 'track' under your abilities and in the time it takes their servor to send you the data on mobs, and figure out where the mobs are, and for oyu to pick your target of choice and click track again, many of the mobs have moved.<br><br>As for the mobs being grouped, that often means they are close to each other and spawned near one another. An example of this is the beetles in NK. They often spawn with/near each other. This is important because if you want to fight one that is high blue or above to you you need to realize it may mean he has buddies near by.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Likely the thread would have died there (after all you did answer the questions, even if you were a little rude) but she only egged the discussion on. I think BOTH of you need to lay of the posts till you can respond with what is relevant to the issue not attacks on other posters.<br><br>Now as to the person who posted it, while i do not feel he is some flawed idiot for posting here, i would like to remind him that all he had to do was type an /ooc in game and he would have received his replies. That holds true to many folks here so i'll say it again in it's own paragraph...<br><br>When you have an EQ question use an /ooc and ask it. If their is one or two folks of your class in that zone likely someone has your answer, and it's MUCH more fun having interaction to get an answer then just posting here for the cheat <br><br>(hehe WAY back in the day i learned my tracking, with my first ranger, from a level 32 Ranger... wow that was back in the day.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Wow, someone had THIER expresso this morning. And a double shot to boost.<br><br>Alright, Einstein. I'll point out what should have been obvious to you.<br><br>1. MAYBE the druid was the first and only character he's ever played, so he's not tried a Ranger and experienced how to use tracking before.<br><br>2. MAYBE he knew that alot of other players DO have multiple characters, and that MAYBE he was offering the SoW to an under 14 person who HAS played a Ranger before.<br><br>3. MAYBE he was offering the SoW to save a 14+ person on mana that it would cost them to cast SoW on themselves.<br><br>Since he's never USED Track before, he didn't realize that the colors corresponded to the cons. Before you bring up the book, MAYBE he bought the $10 CD and doesn't have the book. And not EVERYONE in the world has a printer they can print the book out on from the CD.<br><br>I would suggest going lighter on the caffine. The only reason I have a clue on how to use track is because once, a long time ago, I tried out a Ranger. And guess what! I found it to be confusing and disorienting at first. Had I been a Lvl 1 ranger asking about using Track would you be this much of a jerk? No. Why? Because I'm obviously asking about how to use a skill I've never used before.<br><br>Well, that's what he's doing here. Asking HOW to use a skill he's NEVER used before.<br><br>Gees, ya know, you were talking about criticizing the newbie basher. Newbie bashing can be bad, but this was just uncalled for.<br><br>And did you ever think that maybe he was offering the SoW because he's one of the few, the proud, the untwinked, and that was all he had to offer for the help? Hey, wow, someone who doesn't beg for handouts, even handout information.<br><br>Ok, so that is my rant. <br><br>Tatiyanna <br>Mommy Druid of Ravensveil<br><br>"Now tell me, was that civilized?

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Tee hee, that send button get's people ever time. *wink*<br><br>Alright, at the risk of repeating myself, but I don't really mind ;)<br><br>The best race for Druids, IMO, is the Wood-elf. We are just the cutest, I think. Well, we women are. I don't know if you're going to make it male or female. I will say that Female Woodelves seem to get ALOT of attention, so if you don't mind the flirting it can really pay off.<br><br>Hey! Whatdaya want?!<br><br>What to do. Well, you need wisdom, so make sure it is nice and high. Um, i think that agility and dex are your other two major traits. Maybe it was intellignence and agility. I don't remember. I am pretty sure that Agility affects your casting some how. I KNOW wisdom does, and it affects your mana. I think that intelligence affects your downtime when meditating. it also affects how quickly you learn skills.<br><br>You've created it. So, what to do? <br><br>Well, once you turn in your note, start killing things. you'll die alot. Don't lose heart. As soon as you can get that blast of fire spell thingy (not flame lick. you won't have component for it yet. But when you can buy a fire beetle eye, get the spell). <br><br>Lvl 1-2 Kill Bats and Skeles and Wasps, just be careful not that the wasps and skeles don't swarm you. Try to save your Bat Wings and Bone Chips<br><br>2-3 start taking on Orc Pawns and Pixie Tricksters and Widow Hatchlings. These can be tough, but they will be easier as you get into lvl 3. Keep saving Batwings, Bone Chips and also spiderling silks, Orc Hatchets, and Pixie Dust.<br><br>3-5 more of the same above. You'll find you can take on multiple of the bats, skeles, and wasps.<br><br>Ok. All those things that I told you to hold on to and not sell:<br><br>Batwings. You can do one of two things. If you want to make money, sell batwings 20 at a time to players for about 2plat a stack. <br>If you want experience, turn them in to Niola Impholder in the mage guild in Felwith<br><br>Bonechips. I suggest not going the money route with them right now. you'll have chances to do that later. Instead, turn them in to the head of the Clerics Guild in Felwith for xp and faction. You want to do this so you can get the Tunare quests later.<br><br>Orc Hatchet and Pixie Dust can be turned in to people at the Ranger's Guild. Again for XP and faction. Sometimes items.<br><br>Avoid the bladed weapon quest from your guild master. I have never been able to complete this quest without buying the items, and you spend more money than the quest is worth. There is no quest following it, unlike the bone chips, so it's a waste.<br><br>Every time you go to Felwith, talk to the mage by Faydark's Bane. Take the note to Jakum Webdancer in Kelethin. Easy xp and gold. Worth it, since it is a trip you are making ANYWAY<br><br>Now, onto the next lvls<br><br>At lvl 5 you start getting what are REALLY our defining spells. Don't toss away snare, though. It took me a while to learn, that spell is great.<br><br>At lvl 5-7, start finding groups for orc hill. Collect Cent Belts and bank them. Don't do anything with them yet. Just bank them. You can start grouping for orc hill as early as lvl 4, but only if you are confident in your ability and the group.<br><br>Once you hit lvl 7, you've gotten a good amount of belts saved up. Make a run to Kaladim in ButcherBlock Mountains and turn them in to Conloe in the warrior's guild for faction, xp and armor. If you've gotten the money to upgrade your armor, sell it. It all sells well to merchants. Depending on how many belts you managed to collect, you can easily send yourself up through lvl 8. If not to 9, then well on your way.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Okay, gate back home.<br><br>Find a group and go into Crushbone.<br><br>You can play in Crushbone all the way through lvl 10 if you like. <br>Stick to bridge area for a lvl or two, then move into Slaver cave (NOT PITS) area. Free slaves for faction and xp. Kill things. Be mindful of Lego's.<br><br>By lvl 10, you are probably tired of orcs and don't want to see another for a LONG time. That's fine. <br><br>You've also figured out that in alot of cases you make a good puller. There are times where you'll want a tank to pull. But if the pull requires delicacy, you are the best if an Enchanter isn't around. Save your belts. Bank them.<br><br>Now, make sure you've bought ward summoned.<br><br>lvl 10-12 group and eventually solo in Steamfont. With Treeform you can start soloing elementals and drakes. Otherwise group for them and the mino cave. Druids can get into the mino groups EASILY.<br><br>lvl 12-14 group (not too large) and take on the Nybright sisters in Lesser Faydark. They are a quest involving the Cleric Guild in Felwith and the drunkard. You can also group for Unrest. Good loot. Both are an easy way to afford your lvl 14 spells.<br><br>At 14, you can go back to Crushbone if you want and kite Lego's. There is a cave by the Lego camp that is accessible from the slaver camps. This is a good place to kite them. It is best done with a mage partner, IMO. snare him. Kit him down the cave. DD him if you want. Once he is in range of the mage, root him. Back up. let pet tank and the two of you nuke him. Beautiful. You want to do this and collect the Lego Pads when they drop. A few diligent hours will net you a backpack full some nights.<br><br>Now, those extra belts you've been collecting. If you want you can turn them in, but by now, xp is nominal. <br><br>Belts sell for 5gp - 1pl a peice. Sweet. Lego pads go for i think 2-4pl a peice. You can make LOTS of money auctioning them. And, if people accuse you of farming, target them and type /emote sticks tongue out at %t "pthbt" and then tell them that you've been saving them since lvl 8 or 9. :)<br><br>Alright, now, make sure you have Expulse summoned. Forget Steam. you are going to Lavastorm. You are hunting Lava Crawlers and fending off fire eles and sprites that agro you. I recommend a mage partner. Mages and druids work real well together because a mage comes with tank in tow.<br><br>Lava crawlers are nice xp. Lava storm is actually best if you hit it around lvl 12. But it will carry you through to 15. <br><br>Lvl 15-16. Tee hee. It is time for every lightie's favorite past time. Yes. HUNTING DARKELF GUARDS.<br><br>There is a guard at the lavastorm entrance who is easy pickings. Practice on him a while. You will do best, again, with the mage. He sometimes resists snare, but rarely resists fire and hail.<br><br>Once you've gotten used to fighting a guard, find someone in thier twenties who will split the bridge with you. Let the twenty+ person(s) take the higher conning guards. You and your friends take the lower ones. For the bridge guards, you really want to add one or two more people. <br><br>These are great because hey spawn quickly.<br><br>Once you hit lvl 16, I really suggest getting yourself over to Stone Brunt. It is a really great zone and can carry you through your 20's easily if you want. For a change of pace you can fight inside the warrens, which is great xp. also, fighting kobolds gets you erudite and hertic faction. Which means that you will soon NOT be KoS when passing through Paineel and you'll be on better terms with the Erudites (like we really care).<br><br>I suggest travelling any time withing these stages, beginning at lvl 5. If you can make it to Qeynos, which you can at lvl 5, I've done, it, get a bind and lvl up to maybe 6 and go after cubert and the dress. Turn it in to zamel and get some earrings. You probably want alteast a guide to the right spot. Getting lost here is really bad.<br><br>Alright, so that is my advice to get you where I am. <br><br>Have fun.<br><br>Tatiyanna<br>Mommy Druid of Ravensveil<br><br>&nbsp;<br>"In waking a tiger, use a very long stick." -Mao Tse-Tung.

(I suggest you go in with a goup and playing nuker/back up/main healer.) Or you could go to Highkeep, very good loot, great xp, if you can get in a group that is. <br>   You could try the new zone, Stonebrunt mountains, but snare won't work here on the named mobs. Although at 28, there are still a great many blues, whites, yellows, and reds here. You could head to Runnyeye with a group, and hunt in the lower reaches. If you hunt here, make sure to pick up a blackened alloy medallian if you don't have better for your neck. (+3 to wis and int.)<br>   Let's see, where else? You could head to Lower Guk and hunt the top levels there. Put together a good group and go hunt in Permafrost, just avoid the dragon parts. If you don't care much about your Karana and Qeynos factions, you could hunt Boabob and Chanda Miller. <br>   That's about all I could thin of right now....<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I agree with Iuladas. Don't worry about being primary casting until atleast lvl 8. That is when we get our Meditate. Your best damage spells really start at lvl 9, though I still like Invoke Lighting for a low-mana AoE spell. It has alot fewer resists than Hail does. At any rate, you don't really start doing more casting-than-fighting until about lvl 14. By then, you start doing more damage with casts than with melee and you can use snare/root and sow to kite.<br><br>Don't put more than one point in meditate. You don't need to put more in. Since you med everytime you open your spell book, you will find it going up REALLY fast. <br><br>Oh, for mana gear. Find a low level enchanter (or higher lvl) to make you a Jaded Silver Ring. It has to be enchanted. It is +5 HP and +5 mana. Good newbie item. You should be able to buy it for around 5plat from an enchanter. Or, find items to exhange for them. A lvl 8 or higher enchanter can make you the silver, and it is much more affordable than the other metals, which are made by higher lvls. <br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>"In waking a tiger, use a very long stick." -Mao Tse-Tung.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ok, This at times really chaps my hide. I have a lvl 47 Half-Elf Druid. Yes your reading it right a Half-Elf this was my first char, and i wasnt really aware of classes or races but knew i wanted to be a druid half-elves just looked better then all the other races at the time. Well first thing i got was man your dumb creating a Half-Elf they suck. Because of there wisdom being so low and other stats. That is true in a sense, but if you look at it correctly i have with my Druid pretty close to the same amount of mana that my lvl 47 Druid halfing with a base of 115 wis and item buffed of 179 well my characters base is 95 and also gear buffed at 179 we have calculated our mana and have the exact same amount of mana. The only diffference i see is that he gets his wis up there higher. Explenation i mean he has a base of 115 so if he had my items his wis would be higher but i still dont have a full suit of wis armour. So i can still get&nbsp;&nbsp;200 wis easily. Also one of my friends got grief about making a half-elf warrior because they are so called weak thats so untrue at higher lvls it doesnt matter your items and other characters spells more then make up for the low start so make what you want and dont listen to all that crap. 8) and most of all have fun 8)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Ok i have a Druid who is LvL 26 on Bertoxx.  I feel i have an easy way to get to lvl 14 pretty fast (bout 3 days playing all day).  After you hit LvL 14 LvLing up is kinda slow but you'll get there.  In order to do this you have to be bound in QEYNOS and not really care bout making money.  This works best if you have a higher LvL character and twink your Druid a little.  I sugest giving him a FS weapon, at least on peice of armor to boost wisdom, all jewerly slots filled with wisdom stuff,  50pp for spells, and a sheild.  This will run you about 250pp, which is nothing if you are LvL 26.     <br><br>1-4<br>      To get to LvL 2 the first thing you need to do is go into North Qeynos and kill them snakes and bats.  Then once you get to Lvl 2 go into killing fire bettles and Klitior bettles.  When you get to lvl 3 i suggest kill the same thing because this will work your skills up pretty nicely.  After killing thing for a little bit you'll hit 4.<br><br>5-7<br>     Now that you are LvL 4 you need to go into Qeynos hills.  There your target will be Large bats, Grey Wolfs, Brown Bears (i know your not supposed to kill animals but you want to LvL fast don't you), and Giant Rats.  This will take you to LvL 5.  Now your LvL 5, Gnoll killing time.  The Gnolls have to be the single most reason people start Half Elf druids.  You kill the gnolls by Blackburrow (dont go into BB yet).  Don't go after the Watchers yet cause the spawn in three's and could kill you quick.  You kill the gnolls and loot their fangs (note: very important to loot ALL fangs you can).  Keep killing the gnolls and looting their fangs till you hit 6.  Then when you hit 6 keep killing the gnolls and keep looting their fangs.  You can move to the watchers but i dont recamend it if your not twinked.  Keep killing the Gnolls till you hit 7.  The reason you stay and kill them till you hit 7 is to agian work on you skills and because you want lots of fangs.  <br><br>8-10<br>     By the time you hit lvl 8 from killing gnolls you should have mabey 2 stacks of Gnoll fangs.  This is where you LvL FAST.  Go into South Qeynos and go into the Warrior guild there will be a guy in there named Captain Tillin.  You give him the fangs 4 at a time.  Now watch you exp sky rocket.  With this quest you should hit about LvL 10 mabey 9 and a 3/4.  He give you some king of lightston and you can take them to the Fish and Ale.  There is a guy in the back his name is McNeal.  Give him 4 stones and you get a little exp and 4 Blackburrow Stouts.  if you dont hit lvl 10 go back out and kil more gnolls and get more fangs.<br><br>11-14<br>     These LvL's are the easiest to get to, the hardest part is finding a group to get in.  Your target for these LvL's are bandits in Western Karana.  Just get in a group and kill them.  They drop Bandit sashes you want to get as many as possible but your group will probally want them too.  Take the sashes you get and turn them into the Paladin Guild a guy named Chesguard Sweden.  He gives you a bronze weapon and pretty good exp.  Just do this till your lvl 14 and you get SoW.  <br><br>14-16<br>     For these LvLs all you need to do is go into Northern Karana and get in a group to kill Griffions and Beetles.  They are hard to bring down but with a Warrior, Cleric, Mage, and Druid (you) they will come down pretty easy.  Kill them till lvl 16<br><br>17-19<br>     After you hit 16 its time to go into Eastern Karana.  In here you want to hunt just bout everything.  I didnt really hunt in here much but i did for a little i forget the names of thing but if you get in a good group and sit at the ramp to Highpass and pull to there you'll LvL nicely.  You should do this till bout 19.<br><br>19-25<br>     After you hit 19 it's time to go to the Aviak Village in Southern Karana.  Here you'll find lots of birdies to kill.  You can find this place from heading directly south of the bridge.  Once here get ready to kill.  Once agian you have to get into a group.  You'll be here for awhile but not to long mabey 2 days tops.  Fight at the bottom of the village till you hit LvL 21.  After this it is time to go into the Penthouse.  This is right above the bird city just follow the path up.  Here you'll find Aviak Avocets (the drop a Aviak charm which is used for Crafter Armor quest) they are tough to bring down but with a full group you'll be able to do it easy.  Stay here and kill till bout LvL 23 the go to the Spires.  The spires are the bid towers outside of Splitpaw.  Your target here will be Tesch Mas Gnolls.  You can fight them till bout lvl 30 but i have only got to lvl 26.<br><br>     Well everyone i hope this guide help you some if anyone has any questions E-Mail me at Dragon3334@aol.com.  Or give me a tell on Bertoxx my name is Dracoone.<br><br>Dracoone LvL 26 Druid<br>May Karana light your path. <br> <br>  <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Go to Steamfont. Make sure you have Treeform and Ward summoned. Watch where spawns come. Find a spot where you can pull what you want and Treeform. You can pull Elementals to you. Or Drakes. Maybe harpies if they con a lvl you can handle solo.<br><br>You med faster in Treeform and get other pluses I don't remember. This is great loot and xp for this lvl.<br><br>You can also get into a group fairly easily as a druid for Mino caves. I can't even remember how many times I had people trying to pillage me out of my current group for the mino caves.<br><br>Play with steam for a couple of levels. Once you are around lvl 12, find a partner or two and play with the Nybright sisters in lesser fay for the drunkard's quest. You can also start getting into groups to take on yard trash in Unrest. Both of these are great xp. Unrest is really dangerous but once you get the hang of it, really worth it. DO NOT camp in the front. I can't stress that enough. Camp the back yard. You can avoid most trains there.<br><br>Around Lvl 12 you can also head over to Lavastorm. Again, ward summoned is great here because everything but the basks (which you want to avoid like the plague), rock dervishes, and drakes are summoned. The Lava crawlers can be taken down easily with a partner (always bring a caster like a mage) and yeild bloodstones about 1 in 3 kills. Good ratio for a jewel drop. They also sometimes drop bloodstone rings. Or was that the drakes? anyway, there is good loot.<br><br>All the zones I mentioned are GREAT xp and GREAT loot, which is always a bonus cause lvl 14 spells taint cheap.<br><br>I'd stay away from Oasis. I found it to be a phenominal waste of time. Oh, if you hit Lavastorm, find a cleric to team with and hit befallen. The first level will probably be a sleeper, but you should be able to find some stuff. It's a neat dungeon, but it is indoors, so be aware of that. <br><br>Tatiyanna<br>Mommy Druid of Ravensveil<br>&nbsp;<br>"In waking a tiger, use a very long stick." -Mao Tse-Tung.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Assuming you are a woodelf or half elf starting in Kelethin:<br><br>lvl 1-4 Okay, you have to take the time on this. Good thing, even untwinked you can hit lvl 4 in about 4 hours if you are diligent. Fight&nbsp;&nbsp;your newbie mobs. Lvl 1- bats. wasps if other wasps aren't around. At lvl 2- add orc pawns. And get brave with wasps. At lvl 3- add pixies (I suggest waiting because gaurds will not help you with them if you get in trouble) and widow hatchlings.<br><br>Tips: Ok. 1. until you can afford bags, kill mobs in stacks. That is, go after, say all bats and skeles or all bats and wasps. Drops are almost always stackable, except rare for wasps (which is sack and sells for 3g to merchant). Kill until you have full stacks or you have a rare drop and then sell. This makes it go quicker. Don't worry if you die, you don't lose xp yet. just get your corpse.<br>2. Do not sell the following to merchants if you want to make REAL money. Batwings, Bonechips, Spiderling Silks. Sell them to players instead. You can get 2-3pl, 5+pl, and 5-10pl respectively for stacks of each. spiderling silks here aren't always common drops, so they sell well to tailors and the occassional bard.<br>Don't kill wolves. YOu're a druid. Wolves like you.<br><br>If you get orc hatchets, turn them in to the ranger's guild. Same with Pixie Dust<br><br>Lvl 4-7<br><br>Group for Orc Hill. Collect as many belts as you can. If you've made good money from above suggestions, buy belts from others if you want. Once you have banked about 3 back packs worth, truck over to Kaladim. give them to Canloe Nusback and gain a lvl and some ex on the side. :)<br><br>This should get you to 7 easily.<br><br>Lvl 7-10 <br><br>Group for Crushbone. In a group, you can probably take down some red cons, especially as you approac 10. Tip for Red cons. Let caster try to cast on it. If it resists, run and yell TRAIN TO ZONE. If it doesn't resist, fight and try to keep group healed as possible. Just don't be stupid. Go after reds rarely. Also, I don't suggest them until you are around lvl 8 or 9. If you are constantly pulling reds to zone, people are going to get real annoyed with you. also, only do it with a full group and a prime healer, like a cleric.<br><br>10-12 with ward summoned and treeform, go and fight in Steamfont. You can solo eles in Treeform or group for other mobs. <br><br>12-14 find a partner or two and play with the nybright sisters in Lesser Fay. Collect all 4 necklaces, and turn them in to the Drunk in kelethin. Talk to the cleric in the paly guild in felwith first.<br><br>also, get in a full group and go play in Unrest. This is a great zone. Dangerous, but rewarding. once you get used to it, you should have little difficulty, as trains really are avoidable, since you will camp the BACK YARD. never camp front.<br><br>From 14, there are any number of things. You have SoW, so you can kite in the karanas. blah blah blah.<br><br>Important thing, I just got out out of the newbie stages.<br><br>Tip. save some of you bone chips early on and turn them in to the cleric in felwith. You want to do that so you can do the tunare series of quests later, assuming you are woodelf or a druid of tunare. all woodelves are, but i don't know if half elves are or not<br><br><br>Tatiyanna<br>&nbsp;<br>"In waking a tiger, use a very long stick." -Mao Tse-Tung.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hi, all.<br><br>I'm a lvl 11 half-elf druid on SolRo and it feels like I've been trying to get to 14 and SOW (and bind!) FOREVER!

Yeah, I want ports and all the other goodies that come with higher lvls, but 11 to 14 has become the bane of my existence. All my other chars seems to be lvling just fine, including my lvl 20 shaman.<br>I've been scouring the websites looking for tips and hints on lvling fast for 11-14, but there's so much conflicting info, I just don't know where to go. I am hoping for some place with great xp and fast lvling, but I need to keep decent loot in the equation too cause I'm POOR :) <br>I made my way to WC and hunted there for a while, but I like being amiable to wolves and bear, so there wasn't a whole lot there for me. I don't group much because I never know how much time I have and I hate to leave a group unexpectedly...especially right after I joined it!<br>Someone said I should start over and play a wood elf cause of higher starting wis, but I hate to do that when I am having such a hard time lvling now. But, that's off the track :) Sorry. <br>I have heard many times that Steamfont is great xp<br>but some say it can take u to 14 and others say only 11. I'm already 11, so I hate to get bound in Ak'Anon and then find out I need to go someplace else.<br><br>Thanks for your help :)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>OK I hope this helps I just made a druid about 2 weeks ago and made lvl 22 last night.&nbsp;&nbsp;What I did from 10-14 was kill wisps.  Kill as many wisps as possible get the greater lightstones and lightstones.  Once you get a backpack or so full of GLS and LS pay the 15pp for a port to NK and ask for a sow and camo.  Head NW to the gypsy camp and give the stones to the gypsy who gives you the quest when you hail her.  I was getting a full blue and then some for each gls and a good piece of a blue for normal lightstones.  You can sell the books from the GLS for 6-7pp each and the ls get a few silver not a big deal the EXP is important.  That got me enough money and exp to make lvl 14 and buy all of my spells.  At lvl 14 I went straight to lavastorm.  Kill even,  yellow and red flame elementals lava crawlers imps and anything else that is summoned.  I did this to lvl 18.  I made 18th in 2 days about 2-4 hours a day camping by the najena zone in case things go bad.  There seem to be a lot of spawns there to keep you busy. The loot here is OK you get bloodstones and words.  Bloodstones can get you 3 gold or so each at the druids or gypsies in the same zone.  At lvl 18 I went to NK and killed griffawns and anything else blue or even to me to make lvl 19.  At lvl 19 I got new spells and headed to EK killing Crag Spiders.  Made lvl 20 in abuot 3-4 hours.  At lvl 20 I discovered a quest in Lake Rathe that gets you over 1 full blue bubble each time.  What you do is go to the island SE of the first one from the SK zone.  There is a little gnome guy who starts the mage epic.  Hail him and start the quest.  Bind here and port to WC go find the roaming guy in the back forget his name but the quest tells you and give him the coin.  Gate back and do the same thing over and over.  I made 2 lvls in about 6 hours of doing this and maxed out tracking and my casting spells.  This quest supposedly takes you to 29th,  but I am not so sure it will be too good after 24th.  I hope this helps.  <br>Ichytharus 22nd halfling druid of Fennin Ro<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
