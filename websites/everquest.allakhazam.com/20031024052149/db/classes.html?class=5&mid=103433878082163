I'm currently level 24 with armor and swords for someone probably at level 40 or 50.  any advice for me so that I can actually play EQ and learn something.  I feel like I've cheated, and that I have no real purpose.  Then again, I'm not used to non-linear games, and this one is completely non linear.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

Many of the skills a Shadow Knight must learn in order to be effective, both solo and in a group, must be practiced over and over again.  If your equipment is allowing you to simply tank mobs without learning those lessons, then you have but one choice...Bank most of the equipment.  I know it seems counter intuitive, but doing so will accomplish two things.  First, it will help you raise your defensive skill.  Second, it will teach you a lot about how to use the spells and skills that are the bread and butter of the Shadow Knight class.  How many times have you had to Shadow Step out of a fight?  How many times have you had to Fear an additional mob and hope that you can kill the first before it comes back?  Do you know when you have overpulled for the group you are with and need to stop and die in order to save your group?  Learn these lessons and you will have begun the steps necessary to become a &quot;good&quot; shadow knight.<br><br>As far as having a purpose, I have two ideas for you.  The first is to start questing.  I don't know what race you are playing, but I think most of them have newbie quest armor.  You may not need the armor, but you might need the experience of questing for the armor.  This site is a great place to find those quests, so do a little bit of homework and out of the 2000+ quests you should be able to find a few that are interesting.<br><br>Second, I am assuming that since you have been in good gear, you have not needed to group.  Start grouping as soon a possible.  Grouping not only introduces you to new people...maybe people with a lot more experience whom you can learn from...but gives you the chance to learn to be a team player.  The grouping experience is what Everquest was built to promote.  The six or seven people I play with on a regular basis have done things that amazed me, simply because we know how to play in a group well.<br><br>Now, if you can combine questing and grouping, then you have the best the game can offer.  I have felt just as proud helping someone get a particular quest item as I have completing the quest myself.<br><br>A bit of a long post.  Sorry for being long winded.  I hope you have a great experience in the land of Norrath.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Oct 11 17:13:02 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></td></tr>

People far too often discount the impact of leveling (i.e. quests, aa abilities, etc.).  Its probably the single most important thing you can accomplish.  You can learn on the fly as far as I would be concerned.<br><br>If you dislike non-linear things, then you are sure to dislike this:  your learning curve in this game sure as heck is NOT linear.  What you learn from 50-60 is tremendously different than what you learn from 1-50.  You're only lvl 24.  I wouldnt sweat it at all.<br><br>When you get 30+, then I would start focusing on grouping, especially in OT.  OT was where I really learned how to &quot;chain&quot; pull and that lesson will be carried right through to 50 (say in DL after OT).<br><br>Post 50, however, your pulling methods will generally be vastly different.  More often than not, you are staying with the group until the mob is finished (granted, there are exceptions; note the word generally).  The zones are generally more challenging, as well as the mobs.  You seldom chain pull anymore.<br><br>Also, you then learn the importance and value of both CLR and ESPECIALLY chanters.  I thought chanters were cute and all, but definitely not necessary pre-50.  Well, 50+, there are just some zones that you cant effectively survive without one.  You can, SOMETIMES, but it isnt easy.<br><br>The list goes on and on (split-pulling is something that you will focus more on 50+ also), so I wouldnt sweat it now at all.<br><br>As far as some of the other things mentioned:<br><br>1)  Shadow Stepping out of a fight.  The teleport is random and always seems to be a major pain in the butt to be consistently effective.  If you find success, have fun, but life changes at 30 with FD, so SS only really has value after that for PvP to me. <br><br>2)  Fearing an additional mob while fear-kiting another.  I would seldom ever recommend this, as this definitely has some risk associated with it.  I would never do this in a dungeon, as your feared mob will probably bring back friends.  In an open area, you may be able to get away with this, but I have seldom ever employed this strategy.  OOM, adds, and basically the pain associated with fighting / targeting two mobs makes this a high-risk tactic.<br><br>3)  Overpulling and dying to save the group.  Post 30, this is almost NA, as you have FD.  If you overpull, FD.  We arent mindless WAR now....  =)<br><br>I agree 100% with the grouping comment.  If you want to do some of the most exciting things in this game / get the best gear out there, etc., then you are going to need some friends to do that.<br><br>Luna<br><br></p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

However, I am not sure I am of the opinion that the point of the game is to get to the +55th level.  If that is the case, then the best advice is to either get a character via EBay or two box a Shadow Knight and a Shammy.<br><br>I took the original's poster's question as &quot;I have not learned how to play my class because I am too twinked...what is the best method to get that experience?&quot;  Of course, &quot;Fearing&quot; a second Mob when you are engaged with another is risky and often fatal, Shadow Step is unpredictable and FD is a lot better method post 30th...if you have managed to sit around and cast the cold buff for and hour or so to get that skill up.  However, the benchmark of an excellent Shadow Knight is being able to use the tools at our disposal with a clear idea of how they work and get out of situations that mean death to just about any other class.  If you don't use your tools, the lessons of how to use them properly will never come.  <br><br>My point is that the idea of twinking a character and doing the ring from OT, DL, to Velk's to 60th without putting yourself into some situation that are flat dangerous and scary are going to produce Shadow Knights with the skills of those mindless Warriors you seem to distain.  (However, I think that most Warriors would not be impressed with being called mindless.)<br><br>I have not played the 55+ level game yet.  I do know the game for Shadow Knights changes dramatically at those levels.  However, I am sure that if you can't use the tools you are given to begin with that you will have serious trouble learning the higher level tools later.<br><br>I would hate to have any Shadow Knight get to the high level game and be a detriment to a raid because they didn't really understand their abilities.<br><br>A co-worker of mine once told me that there is a big difference between having 20 years of experience and having the same experience for 20 years.  I think that applies to any Shadow Knight who thinks that levels are more important than experience.<br><br>Good hunting friend...<br><br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Mon Oct 14 12:16:50 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></td></tr>

If they are having fun, no one can argue with that point.<br><br>In general, however, most people have a goal, which is probably ranked fairly high, to obtain a high level and / or get nice items.  That is the way the game is built and is one of the elements (albeit probably a strong one) that makes it so appealing to a lot of people.  This guy has a pretty decent twink.  That suggests to me that he wants to do more than solely shoot the crap with his buds in game.  I dont know for sure though.  That is just how it struck me.<br><br>If my statement above is true, I certainly would never ebay any character, to say nothing about a SK.  You have to learn how to play any character and an SK is typically viewed as a challenging class to play, as they are very self-sufficient class that can do a lot of things.<br><br>You said you would have him bank all his nice gear to, essentially, learn how to play his SK.  Im sorry, but I disagree.  The time committment is just too damn big for him not to get that experience (or &quot;tools&quot; as you put it) that he needs.  In other words, it isnt like with his present gear he is going to race to 60 without any problems.  It just doesnt work that way.  His present gear, especially when factoring in what his level will be as compared to the zones that he will be fighting in, will definitely give him substantially all the experience he needs.<br><br>Hell, you could put a lvl 30 SK in full SS armor and, while he may be leaps and bounds ahead of all the other SKs in, say, OT, he still will be learning his class and risking death.  Level caps make good sense in situations like these.<br><br>I also assumed that the smiley face =) following my derogatory comment about WAR demonstrated that I was kidding.  I do not distain WAR in any way, nor was I serious when calling them mindless.  /sigh<br><br>I also have some bad news for you and taking a SK to a raid.  We arent a extremely desired class and definitely are very expendible at raids.  About the only unique thing we bring to raids is an agro buff, which sure as hell doesnt make a monumental difference.  Furthermore, a lot of classes can do DPS equal to or greater than we can, so dont expect that the red carpet will be rolled out when heading to a raid.  Trust me, it pains me to say that, but its the truth.  I only wish Verant would give us SOMETHING unique to where raids leaders would say, &quot;Damn, I wish we had few SKs here.&quot;  At the moment, I can assure you that that is seldom, if ever, said at a raid.<br><br>Also, Im not sure that your analogy about getting 20 yrs of experience vs 20 yrs of the same experience holds water in the EQ world.  It just isnt possible to stay in the same zone doing the same thing over and over again and get to lvl 60.  <br><br>Further, with that analogy, you suggest that I believe that getting to lvl 60 is more important than experience.  That is absolutely, without question, an inaccurate assumption.  As stated above, you need to learn how to play your character and that only comes from playing him.  Your comment about banking all his gear suggests that he wouldnt get that experience.  I disagree.  He almost assuredly will, even with the gear.<br><br>Luna</p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>
