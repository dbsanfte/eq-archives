	   <tr><td colspan=2>Far far too many wizards just don't seem to know how to play in a group.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm goin to tell you how.  You are the final resort.  You are the one who gets the kill.  Whatever you do, don't feel you have to blast away at the Mob just because the fighters are hitting away at it.  Nothing is more annoying in a group than waiting around for a wizard who is oom because he spent way too much mana making an easy kill.  Also, nothing is more annoying than a wizard who constantly draws the Mob to him because he cast too early and runs around yelling for help.<br><br>When your tank brings in a Mob, do a /assist.  Then sit down and start medding.  Watch the tank's hit point meter and the Mob's hit point meter.  If the tank gets in trouble, by all means get up and blast away to save his butt (unless you have a healer who can do it far better then you can).  Otherwise, wait until the Mob gets to half damage, and then get up and blast away at it.  Snag those that run away an kill them.  A good wizard will almost always get the groups kill.   As soon as the battle is over, sit and med again.  You can go whole battles without more than a glimpse at what you are fighting.<br><br>Yes, you will indeed spend most of each battle sitting on your butt.  That's your job.  You're a wizard.  If you're party doesn't understand, get a better group.  They probably don't know how to play anyways.  Ideally, you should spend the same amount of time medding for mana as the tanks spend sitting for hp.  If the group is waiting around for you to gain mana, then you are casting too much.  If you are sitting around waiting for them to heal, cast more often.  Adjust your tactics for your particular group.  A properly played wizard can easily double a group's effectiveness.  A poorly played wizard is just a liabilllity.<br><br>Da Wiz<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

There are a few criteria for this to hold true: <br><br>1.) You are level 35+ and have sit-med. This is important because you DO need to know exactly what the tanks bring in during multiple mob pulls. Simply knowing what they are currently attacking is not enough. <br><br>2.) You are not sitting in the pull path, or in multiple mob pulls you are not sitting close enough to aggro the additional mobs. <br><br>It takes some experience to get a feeling for just how close you can sit to a mob under various conditions, but this information is important so experiment with it. <br><br>- Melee'ing is mostly a waste of time at higher levels, even if you are at full mana. This is an individual call, and you need to decide if your melee output damage is really high enough to warrant using it. I really don't recommend non-spell fighting unless you have a weapon with an effect or a weapon that can cast a spell itself, such as the Soloist Icy Wand. Things to think about before melee'ing: <br><br>1.) Swinging = aggro. You don't even have to hit the mob. Anytime you swing at a mob you build on your aggro, even if it is only a small bit. <br><br>2.) You have to get close. Distance plays a factor in aggro, and if you have casted on the mob during the fight it may attack unexpectedly if you step into melee range. Also, if you get closer to the mob than the tanks (there just isn't "melee distance", but rather degrees of melee distance) it could also turn onto you. <br><br>3.) Your melee skills suck ;). While at lower levels you may be able to significantly contribute to a battle, you will find that this becomes less and less true as your character progresses. Ask yourself, would it be better if I melee'd or should I just cast a light nuke and sit to med briefly? Most of the time you will do more damage from a safer distance by just casting a lower level nuke and then sitting to med the little mana you used up. <br><br>- If you are not at full, MEDITATE! Recently I started a new character, and I can't tell you how much I hate to see a Cleric cast a heal, and then continue to stand around watching the battle like a newbie, which perhaps they are. Of course, a few more heals later they are "OOM" because they did not sit and med when they should have. What is a real killer is when they still don't med but instead jump in and try to help my SK melee...what I needed was a heal soon, not someone adding a pitiful amount of melee damage to my own ;). Mana = life blood, if you aren't full and there is nothing urgent to do then MED! :D <br><br>- I disagree with the original poster - getting the kill isn't your job, making sure the mob doesn't get away is your job. Sometimes this translates into over-nuking the mob as it nears its death, but that is far from the ideal solution. One of the responders already covered snare, and I'd like to expand on that topic. As a mob loses hitpoints it weakens, and if it gets really low on hitpoints its movement slows to a crawl, sometimes even a stop, particularly if it is snared. Your job then, is to nuke it to death with a minimum of over-kill (within 50 damage or so) or to hurt it bad enough to bring it down to "crawl" speed. The tanks should then be merrily slashing and bashing it in the back, bringing it down before it can get far at all (meanwhile you have gone back to medding, right?) :D. In dungeons with tight corners it may be necessary to over-nuke the mob, however, as two steps may be all it needs to round the corner for friends :(. The one thing you really want to beware is nuking it hard enough to make it run, but not hard enough to slow it to a crawl. This is a very, VERY bad scenario. Luckily it is controllable with experience - know how much your nukes do, know how much it will take off the mob's life bar, and have different "sized" nukes memmed for different situation (a big nuke and a small nuke). A good wizard should be able to visualize how much his nuke will take off the mob's hitpoint bar and account for the damage that will be done by the other players before ever casting his spell. This is really important - perhaps you know this mob will run at half health, and your nuke will only bring it to 55% health, but you MUST account for the damage done by others during your casting or you may suddenly find the mob down to 45% health instead of the predicted 55%, and running like mad down the corridor to get friends :O. I speak from experience ;). <br><br>- Area Effect spells need their own thread...actually, they need several ;).

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I support the idea of nuking towards the middle of a mob's life bar rather than towards the end or beginning.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of your tanks have weapons that are procing as well as situations where some Cleric or Pali will cast a small nuke or Dot.  The thing is, trying to avoid corpse nuking, that is, thinking you are gonna get in the killing blow, only to end up frying something already dead--talk about a waste of mana!  On the other side of the situation, nuking too early leads to unnecessary resists and/or having the mob agro on you early in a combat round.  Since i don't yet have med/look ability, I usually stand, assits the primary tank while assesing the situations, including factors of what other group members are going to be able to contribute, then sit and med till I see the targeted mob's health is at about 70-80%.  Then I will add one major nuke.  If I don't get full dmg, I may add another lesser nuke--then I sit and med.  Depending on the area, particularly tight spaced dungeons, I may jump up on a mob near it's death and fry it if it is fleeing too close to places I know it's friends are waiting. Otherwise I try to avoid "Corpse Nukes" at all costs--they are just the worst waste of mana possible.<br><br>Another thought for groups is that if I see that the tanks are enganged heavily, and the healer gets agro'd, I will often throw a max nuke at that mob to get it off the healer.  The healer will usually then keep me healed while I either burn the mob, or some tank comes to pull it off me--or I just stun and root that mob and move to the other side of the battle to continue medding. If the mob returns on me, the tanks are usually in a better position by that time to taunt off me.<br><br>And yes, we need to get some AoE threads going here.  There are some awesome ones on Gaffes, but the topic is always worth keeping up, since some newer players may never find the old threads in this or other forums.<br><br><br>Kelvyn, 30th wiz, Veeshan<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have read your posts about grouping and I would like to add my 2 cp's worth.<br><br>First of all, when fighting in groups, I always have at least one or two high level spells memorized, at least one spell of a lower level, root, and Tishan's Clash.<br><br>When starting a fight with a creature yellow or red, I wait until the tanks take off anywhere from 15- 20% of the monsters health and cast my most powerful spell on it, then immediately sit down and med. During this time I watch the health of the monster, plus the health of my group members. When the monster loses about another 20- 25% of his health I cast another spell, which one really depends on how many tanks are in the group. sometimes I cast another powerful one, sometimes I cast a weaker one. In a situation where we have at least 2 tanks and a healer, i try not to cast more than twice per fight against yellows or reds. Sometimes I may need to cast more if the tanks are taking too much damage (especially if we have no healer). I never pull mobs on me using this method, and I am usually alway the only one who always has full health (this has caused a couple of people to get mad at me who didnt understand the role of the caster).<br><br>When fighting blacks (whites), or blues, or greens, I try not to use my more powerful spells, and cast a weaker one, or maybe Tishan's Clash to stun them for a little while. I usually cast at least once with a black, but hardly ever against a blue or green...unless our tanks are taking too many hits. During these fights I am always medding.<br><br>Now, these scenerios are all assuming that we are fighting one monster at a time. It gets a little tricky when fighting a mob. I only use DD attacks. I have not used AoE's since about level 8. I have just never had any use for them. They dont do as much damage to each creature as a DD, and it almost always results in pulling a mob onto myself. I have found that I can be most effective to use my most powerful spells and hit one at a time (only the ones that our tanks are fighting, and after losing 15- 20% of its health) to kill the monsters quickly, using all my mana if need be. I also may root 1 or 2 so the tanks can concentrate on one at a time. If I am sow'd and we have got way too many on us, I have been known to nuke a couple of them to draw them on to me, then run them around until our tanks have finished killing the others, then bring the monsters back or just run them to zone.<br><br>Someone posted on here saying not&nbsp;&nbsp;to fight melee. I have even heard some people say not to carry a weapon at all past a certain level. I disagree with that wholeheartedly. Now I'm not suggesting that you try to fight melee all the time like a warrior, expecting to do a lot of damage. But like it or not, melee fighting is the only way to build up your defense skills, like dodge. What I do is this....I said before that usually fighting a blue or green, I sit and med through it. Well, If I am full mana, I will get in and swing the staff around. I am certainly not expecting to do a lot of damage to the thing I am fighting. I do it mainly to pass the time (since my mana is full). But it also doesnt hurt to have your offense skills go up either. Right now my 2H Blunt skill is average. My offense is good, and my defense is very good (I am currently level 24 and carry a fine steel staff) and I fight melee better than most other casters I've ever been grouped with.<br><br> And even though these skills still may not be very important to a group, they have been extremely valuable in soloing. I cant tell you how many times I have had very close calls in a fight because I ran out of mana and had to finish the fight off with my staff. Then going back and looking at all the dodges I had done, or the misses from the monster. Also, when fighting those pesky greens that attack me even though I get no exp, I almost always fight melee through the majority of it when I can. That keeps me from wasting precious mana.<br><br>The wizard's battle skills lies in magic casting. And that should be the way you fight for the most part. But I think it's important to have some half-way decent melee skills and a good weapon for those times when you are out of mana or just want to conserve.<br><br>This is just my opinion, but it has worked for me very well. I suppose if you asked 10 different wizards what the best way to play the character is, you'd get 10 different answers.The good thing about Everquest is there is no one way you have to play your character, I dont care what it is. Just experiment and find out what works best for you. If your group doesnt like the way you are playing, drop out and find another group until you do. Now, I guess if you are constantly getting kicked out of groups because of the way you play, you might want to consider a new strategy. But the important thing is to have fun, and have fun playing it your way.<br><br>Vanderboz<br>24'th level wizzy<br>The Rathe<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
