	   <tr><td colspan=2>Innoruuk's Curse is the Shadowknight epic weapon.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its a 40/45 2HS that has the following stats:<br><br>20str, 15dex, 15int, svmagic15, svfire15, svcold15, svpoison5, svdisease5, hp60, mana40.  It also procs Soul Consumption, which is perhaps its greatest attribute, a 250 lifetap DoT over 5 ticks (30 seconds).<br><br>Some may argue, however, that the SK has 2 epic weapons.  What originally started out as IKS SK only, probably due to the terrible faction associated with IKS, which makes doing Inn Curse VERY hard to do, has been expanded to all classes. After upgrading your initial weapon like 9 times (all via quests), you can receive:<br><br>Greenmist, 18/22 1HS, ac5, str5, dex5, int10, svmagic25, svpoison5, svdisease10 &amp; it procs Greenmist.  Greenmist proc is a 120 Lifetap DoT over a WHOPPING 8 ticks (48 seconds), a str tap of 20, &amp; a ac tap of 9.<br><br>Personally, I like Inn Curse far more than Greenmist &amp; I would think it silly that any class, except for a IKS, would even go through all the hassle of getting Greenmist, as the reward doesnt seem to equal the work required to get it.  Also, 18/22 is good, but definitely NOT great &amp; the proc also seem to leave a little more to be desired....<br><br>Lunatic<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Apologies; Im an idiot that didnt read your message carefully enough.<br><br>I guess Im confused as to why you would complete Greenmist over Inn Curse, AND you are non IKS.&nbsp;&nbsp;Completing Greenmist is no simple task.  As difficult as Inn Curse?  Im not sure, but being non IKS SURE HAD TO INCREASE the difficulty of getting Greenmist immensely.<br><br>Why is that significant?  Well, lets take a closer look at Inn Curse vs Greenmist.  Since you suggested that Greenmist was better when fighting in Ssra temple (or The Grey; somewhere where you get the bane damage), so you must be referring to Greenmist doing more damage than Inn Curse when fighting Shissar.  Therefore, I will not discuss the other attributes of wielding Greenmist vs. Inn Curse &amp; will only focus on the damage aspect of it.<br><br>Inn Curse has a far greater DPS than Greenmist ever could, both on the proc &amp; off, when fighting non-Shissar.  It has a far better basic DPS, as well as far better overall potential when factoring in the damage bonus.  Further, the Inn Curse proc is FAR MORE DAMAGING then Greenmist can ever dream of, so Greenmist loses this comparo hands down.<br><br>I know what your thinking; the bane damage in Ssra temple is going to save Greenmist &amp; make it a better weapon in there.  GUESS WHAT; that is NOT true all the time.  As a matter of fact, that is NOT TRUE MOST OF THE TIME.<br><br>OFF THE PROC, Greenmist will be more damaging.  My estimates come up with about 3.5 more DPS (factoring in shield bashing damage; if a ORG or TRL was wielding Inn Curse &amp; gets slam, then the difference probably becomes more like 1.5 more DPS).<br><br>ON THE PROC, HOWEVER, Inn Curse is STILL MORE DAMAGING.  YES, even against Shissar.  What people fail to realize is how killer that proc is:  250 HP Lifetap over 30 seconds is KILLER.  That is about 8.33 more DPS once it goes off.  Also, by the time you get either of these weapons, your DEX is high enough to make them proc on a fairly regularily basis &amp; I can tell you from experience that it procs fairly regularily.<br><br>Believe me, I think that is terrible &amp; so WISH that Verant would make the lifetap proc on Greenmist A LITTLE BETTER.  As it stands, it leaves something to be desired.  Also, 18/22 is NOT that great by any stretch for an SK.  It should probably be something like 20/22 to make it more respectible.<br><br>Inn Curse is not only far more consistent a weapon than Greenmist (works great against all mobs, not only against Shissar), but its more damaging most of the time.<br><br>Therefore, to say that you are in a guild that requires you to use that weapon ONLY really makes sense if you are the MT.  Why?  You will have a ton more AC, because you can wield a shield with it, get the proc of 9 ac, and also the 5 ac from Greenmist.  Because is has little, IF ANYTHING, to do with damage output.  Greenmist loses most of the time.<br><br>Lunatic<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I know Im asking for trouble with this post, but I had a LONG discussion with a MNK in our guild last night about damage per second (&quot;DPS&quot;), duel wield &amp; delay, both hasted &amp; not hasted &amp; I felt it necessary to let people know the correct formulas so they can make their own conclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp; This post will focus on DPS aspect mostly.  I can discuss the other things in a different post if needed.<br><br>The numbers for DPS are all mathematically calculated.  There is no bias anywhere &amp; they are what they are.  However, the MNK just wanted to believe what he wanted to believe, as it is believed in mainstream play &amp;, therefore, MUST BE CORRECT.  Nothing could be further from the truth.(NOTE:  I am ONLY referring to dly/dmg; I am NOT factoring in stats, procs, etc. those of which are NOT easily quantifiable, nor measurable)<br><br>The whole converation began when, in guild chat, a member asked what weapon would be better in his OFFHAND; lammy or LSoEE.  For those of you who arent familiar with these weapons, both are 1HS, with lammy being 19dly, 9dmg, and LSoEE being 29dly, 16dmg. The formula for simple DPS is as follows:<br><br>DPS = (dmg*2+1) / (dly/10)<br><br>With the little work of a calculator, it becomes clear REALLY QUICK that LSoEE is FAR SUPERIOR to lammy in the offhand, at ANY LEVEL (lammy is NOT a good weapon at ALL; i know NOT why it is so popular).  Why is it imporatnt for me to say at ANY LEVEL?  Well, the offhand does NOT get the damage bonus that is applied when wielding a weapon in the primary hand.  Hence, in the offhand, you put YOUR BEST RATIO to get maximum damage.<br><br>In your PRIMARY hand, however, the formula becomes slightly more complex, as you now have to figure in a dmg bonus.  Again, just using a calculator, you will discover that once a character passes 49, the lammy will do more damage.  The overall weapon performance can be evaluated with the following formula:<br><br>Weapon performance = (2*weapon dmg+1+dmg bonus) / dly.<br><br>Therefore, SPD (or dly) becomes important for the primary hand, as the more hits equates to teh dmg bonus getting applied more &amp; more.  That is why at lower levels the LSoEE was doign more damage, but once a certain level was reached &amp; the damage bonus increased, the lammy passed it up.  Therefore, ratio AND speed for the primary hand is needed to max damage.  The only way to really know for the primary hand, however, is to run the numbers.<br><br>Here's an interesting fact to stump the WAR friends with.  When you start playing around with these formulas, you will quickly discover that lammy is a TERRIBLE weapon &amp; an awful purchase.  They generally sell for 3kish on my server &amp; WURM sells for about 1.5k.  Wurm is a MUCH better weapon in primary hand until 58 &amp; you can get it at a far cheaper price.  As far as the offhand, same thing.  Lammy costs far more than Centi LS or SS, yet those have better ratios &amp; will do more damage.  Tell that to most WAR &amp; they will immediately say, &quot;NO WAY!!  This is so much faster!!&quot;  Im like--no @#%^--but the damage of 9 IS AWFUL!!!  Why cant people face the facts sometimes???<br><br>Often, taunt will be cited as a reason for a spd weapon, which i dont buy for one second.  The absolute BEST taunting weapon that I have seen to date has got to be Neraldi's Lance, which is a molasses slow, 45 dly, 2HP weapon.  It does, however, have 44 dmg, so perhaps its overall damage that generates the most taunt???  Hmm<br><br>The reason that this applies to us SKs is that we still have to go through the same calculations, but we only have our primary hand to calculate. I urge you all to use the formula(s) above &amp; wield the weapon that generates the highest number.  Your efforts will be rewarded &amp; you will be armed with a far greater weapon DPS understanding than most of the players out there.<br><br>Lunatic<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>lunatic,<br><br>i won't profess to fully understand all the calcuations but i think your calculation does not consider double attack.<br><br>the lower a delay of a weapon the more chances it has to double attack in a given time span. this same principle would apply i think when considering both dual wielding and critical hits i think.<br><br>critical hits is a direct parallel i would think. the more often you swing, the better chance of crit. hit (unless dmg. has something to do with crit. hit. i really don't know for sure i've never played a warrior so i'm kind of talking out of my ... well you know).<br><br>with dual wield i thought that you only swing with the 2nd weapon if you hit with the first. so i guess that would mean again. more swings, more chance to deal extra dmg. by swinging 2nd weapon. speed would definately help there.<br><br>regardless of whether or not i have the crit. hit and dual wield thing right, your formula definately doesn't mention double attack so i don't think it tells the whole story.<br><br>to me you need to have an idea of how often you double attack vs. not double attacking. i know there is a formula for this but i don't know it. with it however, one could combine the ratio calculation you supplied with chance of double attack and come up with an idea of which is better.<br><br>i'm very curious about this i think i could figure a really good ratio that does take into account double attack if i had the following information.<br><br>1. what does delay mean exactly. does a delay of 19 mean you hit once per 1.9 seconds, or something else? i really have NO idea.<br><br>2. how do you calculate your chance to double hit. prolly based on offense + weapon skill divided by something or other. maybe dex figures in???<br><br>regardless we could set constants like say lvl 40 with dex of 80 and we could come up with fair comparisons.<br><br>if anyone has this info i'd love you to post it.<br><br>lastly. your post is very timely since i am debating buying a centi ls to replace my sporali defender blade.<br><br>17/37 vs 14/27. your formula definately helps out there since the DPS of centi is 1.07 vs the sporali's .95 . that combined with the fact that i will swing the centi more for double attack having a lower delay means the decision is a no-brainer. centi it is.. ;)<br><br>/auction WTS sporali defender blade - *chuckle*<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>i've thought further about the double attack thing and decided that even with the calculation it will be irrelevant. ratio will still rule the day.<br><br>while a lower delay weapon will have more chances to double attack and therefore more double attacks, the dmg. of those double attacks depends on the dmg. of the weapon. so ratio applies just as much to double attack as to regular attack. if double attacks always did the same dmg. regardless of the dmg. of the weapon what i said earlier would be true, but that just isn't the case. so i think lunatic is right.<br><br>so disregard my ramblings.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Haha.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasoned yourself out of it?  =)<br><br>Actually, I think that you are correct in your 2nd post.  Double attack shouldnt play a role.  For instance, let's assume that Wurm had a DPS of 12 &amp; lammy had a DPS of 10, and your character had a 50% chance to double attack.  To determine which weapon would be better, you would increase the DPS of both weapons by 50%.  As such, you would adjust the DPS numbers as follows:<br><br>Wurm = 12 + (12*50%) = 18<br><br>Lammy = 10 + (10*50%) = 16<br><br>In this example, Wurm is still better when factoring in double attack.<br><br>Since you asked, the formula to calculate the percentage to double attack is as follows:<br><br>(Skill + Level) / 500.<br><br>The result should then be converted into a percentage.  As such, a lvl 50 character with 200 double attack skill has a 50% chance to double attack.<br><br>Re: Critical hits, see logic above.<br><br>Re: Duel wielding;  No, it is NOT true that a faster delay weapon gives duel wield a better chance to succeed.  You can put a lantern in your primary hand &amp; still get substantially the same results out of your offhand.  The formula, for those interested, to duel wield is as follows:<br><br>(Skill + Level) / 600 &amp; convert to a percentage, similar to double attack.  As such, a lvl 50 character, with a skill of 200 Duel wield, has a 41.67% chance to duel wield with the offhand.<br><br>It has nothing to do at all with what you are wielding in your primary hand.<br><br>As far as I know, delay is a measurement of time, stated in terms of seconds times 10.  So, in your example, yes, dly of 19 would be 1.9 secs.<br><br>Hope this helps  =P<br><br>Lunatic<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

If I group with you its because you are of use to me and my goals.  Your goals are of little consequence to me. If we work together it is only because it is to our mutual advantage (or at least mine) Death of the weak makes room for the strong to grow stronger.  Either you will be strong or you will die.<br><br>Lorleeni<br>Human Shadow Knight of Innoruuk<br><br><br>I just love roleplay!

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hi everyone,<br>I have a 7 Iksar SK I just started today. Anyway, I somewhat twinked him and he has a MoSS and for a 2hs I got him a Fatecaller, 33/45 with 10sta. I know the MoSS is an excellent weapon, but I am wondering about my 2hs, because that Is what I plan on switching to when I hit 20. I probably have about anywhere from 1k-2k to spend on one since I bought alot of armor type equipment for him also. Please let me know on 2hs suggestions or feel free just to tell me that what I have is great. Also, I am wondering how hard I will hit with a 33/45 at Level 20? ATM, I have about 117 Str I believe and am curious if I will hit for over 100 at all with a 33/45 at 20. Any feedback greatly appreciated, excited to hear from you all ( CANNIS AND LUNATIC!). hehe. I have read these boards alot and this is my first post. So I KNOW you two guys will specifically have something to say or knowledgeable advice to give. All help is greatly appreciated. Thanks.<br><br>Xshatiz<br>7th Level Iksar SK (Cazic Thule)<br>On the Nameless<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>IKS SK?&nbsp;&nbsp;heh--decided to take the LONG ROAD (but honorable) (according to casters-realm, IKS / TRL SK are the slowest leveling race/class combo in the game!!  =P)<br><br>To be honest, with MoSS &amp; Fatecaller, I would NOT even worry about upgrading your weapon at all.  PP is something that is hard to get to the point where you can say, &quot;I have too much.&quot;  You will almost always find some armor / item that you will want to buy regardless of level &amp; there is a lot more to an SK than just a killer weapon (which you alrdy have for a character pre-50).<br><br>MoSS DPS is 13.4 &amp; Fatecaller is 14.9 (lvl bonus nor dmg cap factored into those figures mind you) &amp; those weapons will easily carry you THROUGH your 40s &amp; not be embarassed.  If you were able to get together some PP &amp; couldnt stand it, I would go for a Noct Blade, or, even better, Ebon Mace.<br><br>Keep in mind, however, that I prefer, by a small margin, 1H weapons to 2H weapons for any SK class NOT an ORG/TRL, so you can bash &amp; interrupt spell casting MOBs (ORG/TRL get slam--no other SK races get that).  Further, a 1H weapon will generally allow you to tank better as your AC will be much higher cause of the shield.<br><br>A 1H weapon, however, will have a hard time outdamaging an equivalent 2H weapon, especially if that 2H weapon is long delay, high damage (primarily due to lvl bonus).  Additionally, a 2H is generally more efficient to cast spells with (in between swings--taking advantage of slow swing time).<br><br>As far as how hard you will hit, hell, Im not sure what the silly caps are anymore; I havent had to deal with them for a long time  =P.  Over 100 at 20?  Perhaps, but probably not.  You will in your 30s i think.  I honestly cant remember anymore.  Perhaps someone else is better versed than I am at the damage caps at 20.<br><br>Lunatic<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>HEHE, I was going to tell him to DOWNGRADE his 2hs.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long run, post lvl 30, he's got the 2hs to have I absolutely agree.  But between now and lvl 30 he'll do alot better with even a Runic Carver or my preferance the Ornate Runed Blade.  Until the damage bonus really kicks in he'll do better with low delay, and it will let him learn the skill faster.<br><br>As I remember from lvl 1-20 you can't hit harder than 21 with any 1 hand weapon and harder than 31 with a 2 hand weapon.  After lvl 21 your damage will slowly go up a few points a level till lvl 30 where all caps are removed.  Only Warriors and Rogues get more damage sub 30 and that's backstabs and Critical Hits.  So with that in mind I recommend the fastest weapon you can get that will hit for your damage cap.<br><br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 55 DE Revenant<br>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 56 DE Revenant</td></tr>

One of the parsers may give you a more definative answer but over-all I wouldn't intentionally go for DEX over STR or STA unless I was close and wanted to break 100 DEX or if you were under 75 DEX.  That seem to be the breaking point for all stats, below 75 you get a penalty above 100 you see a little bit better bonus of some kind.<br><br>Otherwise level will naturally increase proc rates on your self buff taps.<br><br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 55 DE Revenant<br>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 56 DE Revenant</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I think that many share your opinion on not procing much....&nbsp;&nbsp;=)<br><br>It is primarily based on your DEX, which, as an ORG, is one of your drawbacks (you aint nimble as heck).  Probably the best way to have it proc more often is to increase your DEX, but Im not aware of anyone having a lot of luck getting that spell to proc much anyways, so I wouldnt kill myself over it.  At 55, Shroud of Death will proc far more often (&amp; for more points) &amp; you will be a lot more happy assuming that you can play him that far...<br><br>I would assume that a fast weapon will have the chance to proc more often than a slow weapon, but BABS is a decent weapon. so I would only change out if you have a decent piercing weapon. One weapon that you might want to consider is Centi Warspear.  Its really cheap on my server, has a higher DPS and is a faster weapon than BABS.  However, your dmg bonus might go down as a result of the lower delay, but if you are interested in procing (w/o a substantial loss of weapon ability) Centi might be a decent change.  Centi is 2HP by the way.  <br><br>I still recommend MoSS over most other weapons however if you can afford it.  It has a slightly smaller DPS, but you can wield a shield with it.  MoSS is probably a little more expensive though, so take your pick   =P<br><br>Lunatic<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have a high level character, and I decided to create a human sk. He is about to hit level 15 tonight (new spells)) and my question to you all is...<br>Now that I will have level 15 spells and be able to fear-kite, which armor should I use. I SOLO! I currently have a full set of crusty and a full set of sentient armor. Just in case you dont know, Crusty gives tremendous stamina and good strength, but takes a bit of dexterity away, where as Sentient armor has slightly higher AC, gives a total of about +43 more INT, and meager magic resists. Like stated above, I plan to continue just soloing with my trusty, suicidal side-kick pet. So, what should I chose...Pretty much a full se of INT, or mad stamina and great strength?? Btw I am using a Nathsar Greatsword&nbsp;&nbsp; (17/30 10str), no haste atm :P.  Thanks in advance.<br><br>Skulreaver Swiftblade<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well you might as well get both sides of this here, me and Lunatic have a slightly different perspective on Stats and gear.<br><br>First I'll say concentrate on Stamina to get over 100.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the magic number where you don't slow down attacks when your yellow bar goes away.  After that Stamina is not that important because it doesn't add that many HP's over-all.  I would instead focus on AC and in the lower levels Strength.  AC is king, it is what will mean the differance from being hit for 50 and being hit for 30, and the lower the hits the more likely you are to channel thru them and get your fear to caste.<br><br>Next for soloing, Fear-Kiting (reverse-kiting) is the way to go, and to do that you need mana.  Until lvl 30, you will probably get more mana from +mana items like moonstone rings that INT items.  But I will say when given a choice between an item with +mana and no AC and a +INT item with AC, go for the AC.  For this things like 1 Sentient Bracer is nice (good AC and +INT).  I also try to avoid Crusty armor as much as possible, I hate the loss of DEX and the AC is lower than the other Plate Armors availible.  I'd instead look for maybe 1 or 2 pieces of Crusty (Helm, Bracer maybe the legs as they have a huge STA increase but take DEX) and then get Darkforge and Sentient for the rest.  The Bracer of Scavenging is also a really good item to offset the negative DEX on Crusty.  The other stuff to look for to fill in would be spider fur for belt, neck and back for good ac/stats.<br><br>Other options will help after level 25 or so.  For example once the Damage Cap comes off and further post lvl 30 when you start seeing bigger 2hs bonuses using a 2 hand weapon while fear-kiting will result in faster kills.  Also after lvl 30 the + INT stuff generally starts giving more mana than the + mana items.<br><br>good luck.<br><br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 55 DE Revenant<br>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 56 DE Revenant</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Actually, I think that we are close to being on the same page, but perhaps I wasnt clear in my earlier message.<br><br>AC is king most of the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am 100% all about improving SK tanking &amp; high AC is probably the #1 attribute to have to improve that.  I was referring to CORE STATS only (STR/STA/INT, etc)<br><br>That said, I WOULD sacrifice STA to obtain a higher AC (as long as STA doesnt drop below 100 that is), as I do believe that the reduction in damage from a higher AC is probably greater than the additional HP that is given from a higher STA.  <br><br>His message, however, seemed to indicate that the difference between the AC was immaterial &amp; that he was choosing between INT gear vs STR/STA gear.  In that case, the decision is simple to me&amp;#8212;choose the STR/STA gear.  An exception, however, is fear-kiting, where INT might reign over STR/STA gear.<br><br>One case, however, where AC is NOT king is reverse-kiting.  In that case, AC means very little, assuming all goes well, as you arent hit that much at all.  As a matter of fact, a CLR is probably one of your worst partners (unless kiting undead) because their greatest attribute (healing) is rendered almost useless.<br><br>When referring to CORE STATISTICS, unless my character was a complete DOLT (i.e. INT of 70 or something), I would choose STA gear over INT gear every day of the week &amp; twice on Sunday.  Damage wise, an SKs spells are fairly weak &amp; it isn&amp;#8217;t until 59 (cascading darkness) that we finally get a decent DoT (you wanna talk getting agro, THAT SPELL DOES IT).  Yes, I really like Boil Blood, but that is no difference maker at all unfortunately.<br><br>In case that you doubt my opinion, let me assure you that I am not alone in my thinking&amp;#8230;..   =P<br><br>From castersrealm.com &amp; how to assign your starting points at inception of an SK character:<br><br>Stamina affects how many hit points you have, and how long you can hold your breath.  It is a very important statistic for Shadow Knights as they are often secondary tanks.  Furthermore, it is the hardest statistic to raise through items.  We would recommend putting a majority of your starting points into this.<br><br>When I first made my character, I didnt know this, nor consider this.  Now, with the experience I have obtained, I can assure you that I now agree 100%.  STA, when referring to core stats only, is KING, as it helps tanking more than any other core stat.<br><br>Lunatic<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Yes, yes, um no and ok.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes I understand and agree with your assessment for Fear Kiting, excetp that I still think AC is important as I stated for being able to channel thru hits to get fear to work.  Yes I would give up stamina for Ac as well keeping over 100.<br><br>But no, Clerics are great for fear kiting.  Let them fear (they get fear as well), let them stun and DD and with them you will get very little down time.  They can also keep the pet alive if you have a low add, letting the pet tank an add for a short time while you finish off the primary MOB.  About the only better partners I had for fear-kiting was Druids (snare/ds) and Shaman (buffs/slows), Clerics are by far better than the rest.<br><br>As for the core stats, I do not agree that Stamina is the core stat.  I know others agree with you, I will only say it is one of the core stats.  The amount of HPs you can gain from putting al your points into Stamina will still not make you a Warrior, so I perfer to concentrate in other areas and play my SK accordingly.  I started with 70 Stamina and I still tank every bit as well as the Ogre SK's I have played with.  But ok, if someone puts all their points into Stamina it wil not make them a useless SK, just slightly handicapped in the casting department.  Putting all your points into STA for an Ogre/Troll and then trying to solo alot is a bad deal, if you always plan on grouping it will help you till lvl 51 but no further.  After lvl 51 Warriors get so many more HPs per Stamina that we just can't ever get close and I'd rather have more mana for snares, debuffs and taps.  But again if you want to go Stamina OK.<br><br>I agree with you about what he should uses for fear-kiting.  But I would almost never recommend full Crusty as the AC is alot lower than Sentient.  There have been times people have said they already had it that I agree it's a good set, but to buy an entire set is not a good idea for loss of DEX and too low AC (Ry`Gorr has higher AC), the Stamina as a whole is not worth the negatives for me.  Even if he is Tanking I'd take the Sentient of 90% of the Crusty, and I think that is where we disagree.<br><br>Either way he's got enough info now to make his own choice.<br><br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 55 DE Revenant<br>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 56 DE Revenant</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I think we are splitting hairs...&nbsp;&nbsp;=)<br><br>AC important when fear-kiting?  Perhaps if the MOB is on ya, but he's probably gonna be snared anyways, so if you can't get the fear spell off, just run a little from him &amp; pop it again (note that you NOT have to be looking directly at the MOB&amp;#8212;all that is required is that he is in your line of sight from where your character stands; I frequently use this strategy for pulling).  Again though, I think we're splitting hairs and you could go either way &amp; be fine.<br><br>As far as CLR &amp; fear-kiting, certainly ANY class is going to be able to help defeat a MOB.  Too many people seem to miss that fact.  I will group with anyone--class matters not &amp; I do not discriminate (unlike many Im sad to say).  However, I would rather have just about any other class over a CLR when fear-kiting.  I believe that most all of the others classes can contribute to fear-kiting more than a CLR can, but perhaps that is just me.<br><br>As far as tanking SKs, I agree--ANY SK can tank.  one of the absolute scariest SKs I have seen is an ERU SK!!  Granted, he's in full Kael armor (of course lvl 60) &amp; has just about all of his tanking AA abilities but we'll overlook that point (haha).  I suppose, however, that I just HAVE TO BELIEVE that MORE POINTS, both core stats &amp; HP, IS SUPERIOR TO FEWER POINTS.  How can it not be??  Further, it is VERY HARD to argue that INT is superior to STR/STA/AGI/DEX for an SK and it is NOT easily quantifiable.<br><br>Re:  STA &amp; core stats:  The main concern I have over putting points in INT at inception is that I believe that items which give large amounts of direct mana are more efficient at later levels.  All races, save for TRL/ORG, have plenty of INT at inception to not have to worry about putting any points into it.  If you are a casual gamer, and were playing an ORG/TRL SK, I DEFINITELY would NOT recommend putting all points into STA at inception.  However, if you are a hard-core gamer &amp; believe that you will hit 60, sure, Id dump all my points into STA, even as an ORG/TRL, because the INT/mana producing items you will get will generally overcome any stupidity that you have an inception   =P.  Also, a high INT will (substantially) only give you a larger mana pool; it doesnt help with mana regen.  Hence, you will, theoretically, have longer down time getting your mana back. Granted, I would rather have the larger mana pool, as its safer, but it really isnt that big a deal.<br><br>Also, make no mistake about it, I think that discussing a topic like this is very good &amp; I do NOT see this as annoying.  For, as stated in Dead Poets Society, &amp;#8220;as soon as you think you understand something, you must look at it from a different point of view.&amp;#8221;  I believe that these threads do that, so I hope that people enjoy reading them.<br><br>Lunatic<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well my last point is on the Clerics again (oh by the way have I mentioned I play one of them too, hehe).&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately I only have 1 account or I'd have hot-boxed long ago and be a Gravelord and High Priest by now.  And yeh I enjoy discussing this stuff too.<br><br>The reason I perfer Clerics is their ability to fear and stun.  The only times I have ever really gotten into trouble fear-kiting was when I could not get fear to go off and was getting pounded.  So any Class that can fear while I'm getting beat is a great thing for me.  Stun also gives me a chance to get Darkness or fear off while the MOB is right on top of me.  <br><br>The only other real adavntage any other Class brings to fear-kiting is a long duration snare.  If you partner with a Druid or Ranger have them snare and you just keep them feared.  With the longer snare you save bunches of mana and really only have to fear and the MOB will die, and your fear and their snare takes almost no mana.<br><br>Just another thing to look at.<br><br>Neptunis<br>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 56 DE Revenant</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>well last night i got into a well balanced group in the Dreadlands and got myself about one yellow bub away from lvl 40.<br><br>i've often heard from many people that the 40's are not all that enjoyable an age range to be in because you're not yet an older (+50 player), so you can't get into some of the very high-end zone groups, and that they are not a lot of good places for 40's to hunt.<br><br>well anyway, i've heard many similar things in the past and there are often not true, but i'm wondering what folks here who reached 50 with their sk's did during their 40's.<br><br>i must say the one thing i noticed about even lvl 39 is that xp seems to be reduced in previously reliable zones. Dawnshroud / Overthere are terrible at lvl 39 from what i could tell. dreadlands seemed good, but i think i'll lose my mind spending 10 lvls in one zone.<br><br>the other question i have is i'm sure i really need to consider improving gear soon. i'm basically wearing my Dark Forge still. The thought of giving it up saddens me cuz it was so fun and rewarding to quest, but I know that in order to survive against higher mobs i'll need something better. my question is when?? can i wait until i'm lvl 46 and get something better from a plane.&nbsp;&nbsp;magelo profile is here. lvl is wrong but gear has not changed.<br><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=251397" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=251397</a><br><br>oh and on the xp for 40's questions, this can be either in groups or solo, i really have learned to enjoy doing both.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Killing hill giants in Rathe mountains was actually a pretty easy place for my sk to solo in during the 40's.&nbsp;&nbsp;Made some decent cash and decent exp till I got up to 47 or so.  Just make sure ya have a decent range bow so you can out pull all the annoying, quad-happy tree huggers.  Also good if you can get a shammy, chanter, or cleric partner.  <br><br>Also got some decent exp in dawnshroud peaks soloing the tribal dudes outside the ME zone in my low 40's.  Made a couple bucks selling the backpacks full of polished steel ulaks i'd collect as well.<br><br>Eastern wastes is a fear kiter's paradise.  Plenty of open room and lots of decent exp to be made there as well for a lone sk.  Get a cleric partner and maybe pick up a chanter and you move your exp bar with some serious wholesale slaughter in crystal cavers also.<br><br>As far as grouping is concerned, dreadlands exp seems to move kinda slow unless you get in a crazy over pulling group that knows what it's doing.  A good group there can spend several hours with non stop pulls and no down time.  Uusally with half a dozen mezzed mobs on stand-by and so many bodies rotting you cant see the ground.  Was always a trip.  <br><br>A pair of sk's can pretty much rock anywhere there's room to fearkite and dark blue mobs.  While one pulls, the other meds.  When the puller gets back to the camp spot with a mob, he tanks it for a lil bit while the other sk darks/fears.  Then you both proceed to sic your pets and start beating the crap out of the poor mob untill it's dead.  Then the previous puller meds while the previous medder goes hunting.  Can generally pull all night long with little down time and nice exp.<br>Add in a chanter and watch the exp fly by.  Same group can make a fortune of plat and some really nice exp in rathe mountains slaughtering hill giants.<br><br>Just a few suggestions.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I actually was one of the boring ones---&nbsp;&nbsp;=)<br><br>As OT &amp; DL, for me at least, were very easy to get a group, I probably got say, 90% of my xp from 30ish to 50ish from those zones alone.  Haha--not a lot of variety, but my goal was to level, not scout other zones, so there I stayed...<br><br>As far as armor is concerned, sure you can wait until lvl 46ish for better armor.  The next step up that I would consider, once you reach 46ish, is twofold:  1) Thurg armor (called Dark Runed--excellent AC, NOT excellent buffs---kill in Kael for armor drops (Riff house, Arena, etc), then get the annoying gems from either auction or other zones in Velious). or 2) Plane of Growth (PoG) (called Noct armor (abbreviated)--is as good as Thurg armor.  PoG is probably faster to obtain (better drop rates) and doesnt require any gems.  There are several tricks/things that you need to be aware of when doing a PoG raid however.  For instance, you will probably need some high level tanks for the Protectors of Growth that spawn every 28ish minutes (they have zone wide agro), pulling the East side of the river isnt exactly simple (ideally you want a BRD to pull--a CoHer is also highly recommended), and trying to find some CLRs willing to trash GFAY faction is NOT easy (HIE CLRs worship Tunare)--all of these are a PAIN in the arse for PoG raids, but they sure are fun when you get there.....)<br><br>As far as solo or group, I soloed a little bit in OT &amp; DL both, but found that a group was more entertaining, as the pulls were much faster.  Furthermore, I also found that being in a group was far less risky.<br><br>There is often a debate as to which is a faster way to obtain XP--solo or in a group.  Fighting solo, the xp is all yours, however, the pulls are much slower as your DPS is not going to be as good as with say 5 others.  A group would pretty much be the exact opposite.  However, a group generally is far safer than solo, so I chose a group to get most of my xp.  <br><br>The one exception to this is the WIZ or DRD who can do their ANNOYING QUAD PULLING, which clearly will level faster than any other normal tactics (WIZ AE groups another exception).  Why do I say ANNOYING?  Try fighting in Cobalt Scar or a zone where they can quad pull--the MOBs become thin really quick then you have like 5 people all running to the next MOB for the next pull.  KSing in here is common.  At least when I pull, Im only pulling one, leaving all the other MOBs there for the taking.  They pull friggin FOUR at a time, depleting the MOBs faster than we are destroying the rainforest.  Its the same annoying tactic too----snare, snare, snare, snare--run around like a wus to get them all together, then AoE their sorry arses.  It drives my nuts.  Partly because Im jealous, but also because I almost see it as arrogant or selfish--there are a lot of people looking for MOBs to kill &amp; they start wiping them out at an alarming rate--it doesnt bug me when there isnt a lot of people in the zone, but when its packed, its just annoying.  Im not sure what I would do if I was a WIZ or DRD hunting at that level, but I probably would NOT do those annoying tactics because I understand what it is like to be on the other side....<br><br>Lunatic<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Sure you can cast both clinging darkness &amp; engulfing darkness on a mob, but they will not stack--I think that engulfing will overwrite clinging.<br><br>On a marginally unrelated note, engulfing is a good snare for when you are in a group.&nbsp;&nbsp;I use it now even in SEB, Velks, etc due to the quicker casting time over dooming (4 secs vs. 2.45 secs).  If I am acting as the snarer of my group, I mem engulfing every time.  Knock on wood, I haven&amp;#8217;t had a problem yet with engulfing.<br><br>Dooming, however, is DEFENITELY the way to go when fear-kiting.  Dooming makes fear-kiting about 1000x easier because there is quite a noticeable difference between the run rate of the mob when dooming is on him (dooming is 20% better, from 40% reduction in run rate for engulfing to 60% with dooming) and it lasts twice as long (assuming no break in the snare, 2 min for engulfing vs. 4 min for dooming).  The MOB practically crawls to you (and then away when you fear him).<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br>Lunatic<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well, after another couple of weeks, I've made some more significant progress on my SK.&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 30 now, you can see my full profile at the following:<br><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=256322" target=_new>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=256322</a><br><br>At this point, I've spent quite a bit of time in High Keep, and am looking at possibly moving elsewhere for more serious loot, perhaps getting some folks to help me piece together my Darkforge set.  If you look at my profile, you'll see there's still a *LOT* of room for improvement, but plat is still a serious issue, so it's moving along a little piece at a time.  Any quick and easy recommendations would be appreciated.<br><br>Having upgraded to the Velium Short Blade (at 250pp) as recommended, I can say that this is an astounding improvement, and between it and Vamp Embrace I am now a proc'ing machine during melee.  Ah, fun!  I would highly recommend this for the mid-level character working his way up in the world.  A pity it's lore; I'd love to see a Ranger or Warrior dual-wielding these things, though there's enough other weapons that proc the same effect that it wouldn't be too difficult.<br><br>Anyway, onto my inquiries:<br><br>First question:  is 30 too low to be working on Darkforge?  Supposedly, it should be fine, and I do not think I will be doing all of the work alone, however, I'd rather not walk into some terribly unpleasant situation.<br><br>Second question:  is Wave of Enfeeblement worth using?  I can't see a dramatic improvement with it, and am not certain if it's worth having scribed.  And how about Scream of Pain?  I haven't been able to sufficiently grade the use of these yet, and wanted soome outside opinions.<br><br>Again, thank you for your help; I appreciate the dialogue and opinions on this board, it's giving me a lot to work with.<br><br>Drom<br>30 Shadow Knight  -  Quellious<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Mon Jun 17 06:07:46 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>lvl 30 is perfect for beginning darkforge with a group. i just completed a set myself about 2 months ago. when i started it was 30. by 33, i had a full set , a lot more pp , much higher weapon skills and a set of armor i wear with pride. ;)<br><br>couple tips for you.<br><br>crusaders can spawn almost anywhere in the feeroot but the best place to try and make them spawn is on the ramp of the main temple. there are 6 spots here and if you pull well you should get no more than 2 lizards per pull. crusader can spawn in any of the 6 spots and i found the rate here to be the highest.<br><br>most times when i would pass through and look to see if any were up, if one was up it was more often than not on this ramp. the two small pyramids just to the side of the main temple also tend to get the spawn pretty often but unless the crusaders spawns in one of the two bottom spots (which i never saw), pulling the crusader gets the whole damn temple.<br><br>now the lizard spiritualist i did not know about but i knoew the spawn spot in question at top of island and this area has 3 lizards but is very single pullable.<br><br>BIG TIP - if you find another SK looking for DF - partner DON'T compete. sure you take random ones at first, but once you get into it the biggest barrier is dupes. more often than not only one of you won't have the piece that drops so there is not much to argue about.<br><br>once you have all the pieces for one piece turn them in. 2 reasons for this. 1 you benefit from the armor which is really very good. 2 - you can collect those two decayed again and complete quest again. JUST REMEMBER TO GIVE FIRST PIECE TO FRIEND TO HOLD. ARMOR IS LORE. as you can guess i screwed up on that once ;) bracers by the way are not lore.<br><br>don't worry too much about trying to avoid HT. you will frustrate yourself. forget what you know about harmtouch. crusaders can cast it as a distance spell so the plan to pull and send pet in as i gets near doesn't usually work. if the crusader spawns solo at base of ramp you can send in pet but sometimes he'll hold HT just for you *shrug* always figure on taking 330 pts of dmg to open the fight. and don't send in pet against spawns at top of ramp, your pet will pull the damn gorillas in addition to the lizards and then all hell breaks loose.<br><br>you can zone to escape into the temple but be aware. you can get killed in there fast if somone if training from the other side. try and use feign instead - OHH AND REMEMBER FEIGN ONLY WORKS IF YOU TURN ATTACK OFF FIRST - THANK YOU NEPTUNIS &amp; LUNATIC<br><br>if a crusader spawns on top of one of the small temples and you have small group and want to pull there is one thing you can try but it is REALLY risky and i DO NOT RECOMMEND IT. you will get the whole temple, but here is once thing i did once that actually worked.<br><br>i cast fear on the crusader in question. if it sticks he'll run north up the middle of the island. feign immediately as the entire temple wants your head now. if you feign fast enough. the rest of the temple will go right back to their spawn points and forget about you before the fear even wears off. this often does not happen and fear wears off too soon. also sometimes you get hit before feign goes off which basically means your dead since you have 6 lizards beating on you. - LIKE I SAID RISKY.<br><br>anyway if you've gotten this far stand up and move a ways north and wait for crusader to return. if you are REALLY lucky. he'll be alone. usually he'll have picked up at least one add. sometimes a train in which case it's time to praactice those feigning skills again.<br><br>whatever you do - don't get frustrated. sometimes the spawn rate will absolutely stink. 3 hours no crusaders. sometimes you'll get 3 in 15 minutes. it's all about patience and dedication. this is a very attainable quest for patient people and the xp along the way is great.<br><br>the lizards also drop tons of fs weapons that sell well unless you're used to the money that your lvl 60 main has ;) . wish i had that problem.<br><br>if you run into questions post again. i'd love to help.<br><br>oh and yes the quests are mutliquestable as of 2 months ago. just make sure you are in a group and turn in the last piece. in my opinion the only piece that everyone seems to find rare is the breast plate. i only saw it drop once ever. this is debatable though. i've heard visor too and i saw that drop 4 or 5 times so *shrug* it's pretty darn close to random.<br><br>LAST TIP ALMOST FORGOT: lizards heal themselves like nobody's business - justicars and judicators especially. have to take out healers first and they have lot of mana. a bard sining manadrain really helps. don't get too frustrated by how hard it is to interrupt their casting just bash when you can and hack away, they do go OOM eventually. this is all the more reason to never pull more than 2 at a time.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Mon Jun 17 16:37:29 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;   firstly, yes darkforge with a group is easily possible altho u may want a higher lvl puller who can single pull the mobs..i did my darkforge when i was 40 solo no problems..but i had to use ritualist spawn as getting crusaders to spawn was hard on my own. The drops are now outside the temple and you can get the decayed as drops from either :<br>    1. The crusaders which are random spawns on any of the pyramids drop at least one piece of decayed and up to 3. The pyramids i belive are on a 15min spawn timer. I soloed them recently as 52sk and the first pyramid respawned by the time i had taken down 2 more pyramids.<br>    2. Tbe lizard spiritualist which seems to be the replacement of the old ritualist as he has the spear and drops up to 3  decayed items but is not on a 2hr timer. he does not have a random spawn position however but his  ph is a slivered (or possibly silvered) tae ew observer or any of the normal lizzy types, eg. fanatic. To get to his spawn point just follow the river from either side of the temple staying on the same side as the temple and you will see a bit of ground going slightly up with a rock there. there should be 4 (i think) spawns there, one is behind the rock and the other 3 are visible as soon as u can see this area. this is much easier with a small group since there are not as many mobs and it may well be possible to solo it altho at 30 this may be difficult.<br>    as to wave of enfeeblement... it sux except for pulling and weakening multiple mobs as Neptunis says..i dont mem this as its very rarely useful. Scream of pain stacks with shadow vortex and also shroud of hate (which are lvl39spells) altho shroud of hate is an atk buff. scream of pain and shadow vortex together are very nice as they lower ur opponents ac by around 25( not sure havent time to check it..) and buff urs which is sweet in pvp and if you are the main tank in a group, however scream of pain takes a lot of mana, i think its 100 which with shadow vortex and shroud of hate totals to 200 which is a hell of a lot for a hybrid..well im done good luck with darkforge :)<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well, with a group 30 is just about the perfect level to start Darkforge.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to solo it you'll have to wait till the upper 40's.  So go and bring friends.  The MOBs have relocated so I'm not sure exactly where or how hard it is to get to the Crusaiders.<br><br>Wave of Enfeeblement is an AE so that's it's value.  If you have a group pulling multiple MOBs one caste weakens them all, but it does have a high resist rate and of course doesn't stack with the old spell.  I'd use it if you are fighting in a group pulling more than 1 at a time.  Scream of Pain is a buff, but at that level won't show a great improvement but every little bit helps.  It also helps with agro and has low mana.  Buy it and use it.  Tactic for those 2 spells:  On Mezzed MOBs, first tell everyone YOU and ONLY YOU will break mez, then taunt, caste Scream of Pain, taunt, caste wave of enfeeblement, taunt, slash and you will get hit as long as the Chanter isn't sitting.  You should use your debuffs like this all the time to build hate before breaking mez.<br><br>Sounds like your on your way now though, keep at it.  And as you upgrade look for things like the Bloodstained Mantle which I kept a s resistance gear into my 50's, Drakehide Belt (5AC +3 DEX +10 sv magic) which has a focus effect and is also great resist gear into the 50's.  There are some good cheap items out there that will last you a long time if you just keep your eyes open for them.<br><br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 55 DE Revenant<br>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 56 DE Revenant</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>OK, i need some posting Karma so i can go piss off some rangers, so i am going to say some useful things about PvP.&nbsp;&nbsp;Feel free to call me an idiot, just as long as you rate me high.<br><br>Warriors:  These are my easiest class to kill cuz they cant cast spells or @#%^, all they can do is get in your face and attack you.  You cannot let the warrior do this.  All you really have to do is pop your DoT's on him, not engulfing unless your sure his MR is like 25 (we know how easily that gets resisted), and shadow step when he gets near.  Joust with him a little and anytime you get low on health, just shadow step and tap, shadow step and tap.  Re apply DoT's as needed.  This class will probably eat all your mana.<br><br>Rangers:  As for this very pathetic class, pretty much all you have to do is resist snare and your fightin a warrior with a DD (which sucks ass).  As for the bow, if it looks like he is gonna use it, stand behind a tree and tap him.  Arrows cant go through trees, but spells can. This is pretty much a warrior. forgot something, if the ranger does snare you and put his @#%^ty DoT's on you, use your cancel magic, he has low level spells, should only take 1 or 2 casts to get rid of either of the above.<br><br>Wizards:  I really have no idea, they always kill me.  Id assume just high resists does the trick.  Probably surprising  them helps too but really, i only have 1.7k HP and they nuke me for 700-1k.  Maybe someone can help me out on this one.<br><br>Mages:  This class is pretty easy as well.  Now I've never fought a mage with the epic pet but i have fought them.  You can do one of two things, you can  either fear the pet and watch him run off get agros, if your in an agro zone, or, darkness the pet and hope the mage is dumb enough to run after you, leaving the pet far behind.  Usually, as you play a class you get smarter, so the snare method wont work as often on high levels.  The fear way works great, except that mages get a fearless pet buff.  just try to find a way to separate the mage and his pet, find some @#%^ed up pathing in the zone and take advantage of it.  As for his nukes, if he doesnt have a pet, he should run out of mana before he can kill you if you have enough HP.  Remember, resists always help.<br><br>NecromANCER:  This is how I almost beat a necro 2 levels above me.  Get as far away as possible to still be able to cast spells. Just throw your DoT's on him and stay out of spell casting range so he cant tap you or DoT you.  Re apply DoT's as necessary.  As for the pet, spook the dead or just snare him like the mage pet.  Keeping a pumice stone on you always helps cuz if you get DoTed, you die pretty much.<br><br>Enchanters:  High levels these guys are bitches and this is another class that i dont know how to beat.  They lower my STR by 130, make my MR 23, and with my STR at 20, i cant move, so im good as dead.  At lower levels though, be sure to have yourself DoTed with disease cloud, as long as your DoTed you cant be mezzed. Pet just fear.  Need some help here with 50+ enchanters.<br><br>Paladins:  if you spotted a paladin, dont start the fight with a sword whack or anything, first use cancel magic to get rid of his buffs, and than you can run in their swingin your sword.  Thing is, your gonna have to go toe-to-toe against pallies, just remember to tap often to keep your health up and dont let them get away, otherwise they heal themselves and come back with full health.  MR helps to resist their stuns, which is a good thing, cuz they can keep you stunned for up to 18 seconds.  As for LoH, many paladins wait too long to use it, so you have to wait till just the right time to use your HT so that it should kill them, but they have enough health where they werent expecting it.  Hope you have HIGH STA cuz these guys can take a long ass time to kill.<br><br>Rogues:  A pretty bad pvp class if you dont surprise anyone,  just dont let them get their BS off and you will be fine.  with their low HP's just keep them DoTed and joust with them, they go down very quick.  Also be sure to have see invis up.<br><br>Monks:  Another bad pvp class, this is like an uber damage warrior, so just shadow step away, apply DoTs, joust a few rounds, and tap when you get one bub below full.  Not much to beatin this class cuz not much to them.<br><br>Shadow Knights:  Hopefully you wont have to fight the best PVP class in the game, but if you do, all you can do is hope your gear is better and you must out-think him.  Be sure to keep cancel magic up to cancel darkness if he lands it, but i cant say much about these guys, so maybe someone could help me out.<br><br>Druids:  these guys are up there on the pvp ranks, so your gonna have to think more than you did against the ranger.  Good things is, their DoT's are magic based so keep cancel magic up to remove those and any snares that land, if the druid cant land his DoT's or snare, that leaves his DD's only and without you bein snared, you should get some good whacks before they can get one off.  FR helps here. Also, if you can manage to snare a druid, any caster at that, you should win.<br><br>Shaman:  only ones ive fought have been 6-8 levels higher than me, so they usually win.  Maybe someone can help me out here, cuz i have no idea at all.<br><br>Cleric: truthfully, ive never fought a cleric in my life.  I always just think about its just gonna cost me all my mana, and all my STA, and he still wont be dead with those friggin heals of his.  besides, who fights clerics?<br><br>Beastlord: Probably like a mage, fear his pet, then pull the monk strategy i believe, I've never fought one of these because not to many are in rage of me.<br><br>Bard:  They are actually kinda hard.  Dont even try darkness line, unless its disease based, but put all DoT's that arent MAGIC on him.  If he starts running, DO NOT FOLLOW.  He will just start singing his gay song that hurts you and he doesnt need mana, so he can go on for hours till you die.  Just wait for him to come back, if he doesnt, talk @#%^, then he will come back.  Ive only killed one high level bard, that was because the rest ran.  This one tried to run but HT took him out before he could start haulin real ass.<br><br>Alright, hopefully this does it.  Please note that i am a level 48 Shadow Knight, so these are strategies for pre-50 classes.  Everyone i fight over 50 beats the @#%^ out of me.  Anyway, if someone could help me out with some of those classes that would help.  Also, this is on the server Vallon Zek, so i could be fightin any levels + or -8.  Also, this is pvp server, none of that blue server @#%^, so no one know when they are gettin attacked so you cant always be ready, in some cases, whoever gets first hit wins.  Whereas on blue servers, everyone has time to buff themselves and all that other bull yit, so strategies may change, like alot of cancel magic castings.<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Sun Jun 16 08:24:09 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Kildiar, The Shadow Knight Innoruuk Rejected<br><br><br><br>"Rangers suck, no argument there."</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Pretty good post. Though I usually do not duel people and I am not on a PVP server I know some ways to help.<br><br>Wizard: Like all casters they focus on INT and lack on resistances. If you get darkness and FEAR whack em from behind. I Dueled a 49 wizzie and he only had 800 HP or so. After a few whacks he was very low and I pretty much won, Thanks Cazic Thule fear lasted. Keep resisances high and never let your DOTs drop from em. You should get blasted by his first spell and take you to half HP but once fear and darkness are on your home free. Cancle Magic is always good to have memed.<br><br>Chanter: Never dueled one:)<br><br>Mages: I Disagree totally with you on mages being easy. If they have they're pets hasted your screwed trying to get your spells off. If it's any other pet besides fire you may have a chance. All I can say is keep resistances high.<br><br>SHAMEN: They are in my opinion the king of all PVP. I have a 46th shaman friend and he has beat me everytime. If your rooted your totally screwed. They blast you wiht DOTs and they're flash of light series is an SK nightmare. They're pet helps with your spell interuptions, but if you attack the pet your dead already while the shaman DOTs your ass. I have know clue how to beat them even wiht migh resistances Malise line of spells keeps em low. They have high AC and enough HP to not die as fast as casters. So GL!<br><br>Paladins/Warrior: They are quite funny esp. when they try and duel. They are the worst class I belive. They are good tanks and can deal melee damage as good as we can but, their damage spells are nothing DOT they dont get and pretty much the easyest class to beat along with warrior. Fear right off the bat. Sure they run fast but darkness em afterwards. If they resist cast in between their long delays. Pretty much fear, darkness ,DOT ,cancle magic their buffs, and whack away!<br><br>Monks: They are usually the class I come closest with at low HPs while dueling. Darkness DOTs/tap/Siphon strength/fear&nbsp;&nbsp;all that stuff will cripple a monk and in time you sal win!<br><br>Like I said I don't duel exept while selling in EC. But most classes are at the mercy to other as long at you faster than they are.<br><br> Rangers are great if they land snare. Same with Druid and Necros basically use your crap against ya haha.<br><br>Shadowknights are in the top three best soloers and keep showing them paladins how it's done!<br><br>Islude-&quot;From the south. Heh, The deep south.&quot;<br>(Overall good post Kildiar) <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>yeah pretty good post..as to Talapus' reply kildiar was talkin from pvp server point of view and so ur tactics on some of the classes wont work since we cant fear in our pvp, wont let us cast it...only bards can fear on pvp servers now which pisses me off but thats another story...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;i also play as an sk on vallon altho im 52..noticed ur 48 kil, well 49s dooming darkness and if u get dat bitch off against a caster u win hands down just make sure if they're a pet class u fear it cos the pet will beat the crap out of u at this lvl..52 pets actually quite good and fearing mage pet fer 42secs is very very handy...especially when its nuking fer 143s ( or higher with epic,165 i believe and those stuns suck)..damn things damage shield can kill pet in the time the fear lasts..<br>   as to wizards basically if they start the fight you lose unless u have mental resists..if u start, harm touch, apply one hit of weighted axe ( if ya can use it) then if they're still alive switch to another weapon and finish em..shamen i dont fight since im a darky and i dont meet too many barbarian shamans..<br>   bards are a personal most hated class to pvp against as sk..they just run out of range as soon as u start casting and they can now disintegrate ur pet instantly due to sum dumb bug..the one thing i h8 most about em is they take so long to kill u while u cant do anything except zone and they're a hell of a lot faster than u...at least till u get unholy steed they are anyway.. :)<br>   necros,  u just fear pets if poss or hope ur pet can annoy them for as long as it takes to kill the necro..if u have jboots and the necro doesnt have some form of haste u pretty much win as long as u interrupt casting or dispel DoTs..and ht em if u feel the need<br>   rangers piss me off cos they never seem to want 1 on 1s and always come with a few friends..if their snare aint working on u, u can basically out DoT them and lifetap em to make up fer dd damage.<br>   monks at 54+ as an sk i think with banshee aura u could probably straight combat em, lifetapping in between strikes but i wouldnt recommend trying it unless u know what kind of damage output the one ur fighting is capable of..they have low hp but usually high resists (at least on my server) so go for dots and lifetaps..pets a bonus but their ac pretty much makes it useless..<br>   Rogues are the class that i find the most fun to fight cos they're always twinked and know how to move to seriously confuse the phuck outta u..the best fight i ever had was when i was 51 against a 54rogue with fungi and resists high enuff to stop any 49necro dots from working (had this tested)..he was in one of the top 3 guilds on the server...basically it was a movement fight since we both had jboots and altho i hit harder for single hits he was hitting so damn kwik my eyes hurt..battle lasted about 20mins literally while we changed who was chasing who and tryin damn well to outsmart each other..couldnt cast any spells cos he was always in range to interrupt even 2.5sec casts...he won the bastard but damn fun nonetheless since i got him to 15% hp on several occasions but damn fungi screwed things up...one thing, dont even think about following them up mountains u'll seriously hurt urself while they run around laughing at u<br>  Beastlords i've never fought since i dont see many barbarians and the other races that can be beastlord are darkies.....i do play one however altho admittedly a lowbie atm..but from what i have seen the pet is easily strong enough to outcombat u so fear the b!tch and concentrate on getting into combat with the beastlord since im pretty sure he can kill u with spells faster than u can take him down..<br>  pallies, with bad resists means blindness for the whole battle and u lose but with an mr of what 60?  u dont get hit by it often and they drop like flies once u've got rid of those bastard buffs...stuns suck altho i think our lifetap and dot lines more than make up for it..life leech at 50 seriously kiks ass (2sec cast 280 lifetap..takes a lot of mana if u have low int tho (like me))<br>  sk ..well basically on a pvp server its not likely u'll both be at full hp full mana so whoever is if ur at roughly the same lvl should effectively win...ht is pretty much useless below 40 ..at 39 i hted myself and lost a whole one bubble of hp wow..but with the increase at 40+ against tanks its useful so just pray u have it up..<br>   against enchanters either have mental resists ( not something i have unfortunately) or hope u get enough time inbetween mezzes to seriously hurt em with ht and a high damage weapon since u wont get many hits in..if u start the fight as with all casters u pretty much win<br>  well thats me done, not sure why i bothered postin since im not all that confident on the matter but hey if this is useful to anyone then thats kool...constructive criticism would be appreciated cos as i realise sum of my tactics suk and yet this is still one long @$$ post<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>WEll there is no one answer for this.&nbsp;&nbsp;85sv Magic is great for a level 22, at my level even 150 sv magic does not give me complete resists all the time.<br><br>Your relative level to the Caster makes a huge difference in resists.  You will seldom resist anything cast by a Red MOB, and should almost always resists the low green MOBs with the new coding. <br><br>No other Stat affects resists, not INT, WIS, CHA, nothing but saves.  The one area people often make this mistaken assumption that a high CHA will help prevent Charm and mez, but there is no proof to this.<br><br>Keep working on resists, you'll find it come naturally as you get the higher level armors anyway.  Most Planes Armors have alot of resists so dispite their low AC (relative to Velius Quest stuff) they are still useful.  And don't forget Poison resists, that will prevent the slows, and a Slow is worse in some cases than a root.<br><br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 55 DE Revenant<br>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 56 DE Revenant</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>i am also a DE SK so i think i can help you in many respects. however, i don't know what the commoner's quarters is so there i can't help.<br><br>i'm wondering if you mean you are looking for the SK guild to turn in the note you have been given to your guild leader. if so the map of neriak's 3rd gate can be found here:<br><br><a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/neriakthirdgatemap.html" target=_new>http://www.eqatlas.com/neriakthirdgatemap.html</a><br><br>the guild with the shadowknight guild leader nezzka tolax is found in the area numbered 2 on this map. it is guarded by ghouls. nexxka tolax is in the first big room you will find in here.<br><br>as to DE SK's being a hard class to play. this is true in many respects. you are hated in almost all cities and will be KOS'd a lot of places.<br><br>however, there are plenty of ways around this and it makes playing the character more interesting i think. you will be limited as to where you can safely and conveniently travel during your early lvls , but as you progress you can either gain faction with key cities you need to get in to. or find zones that are close to ones where you can.<br><br>fyi to start you can bank / sell / and be generally safe in 3 cities - nerriak , oggok &amp; grobb. i guess also the bazaar / shadowhaven on luclin too, and thurgadin on velious. i've not done anything yet to raise faction there and i can run around just fine.<br><br>freeport is a mixed bag. you will NOT be able to sell. you can bank if you can reach the bank in north freeport which initially you will not be able to do as the guards in north freeport are paladins and will kill you on site. <br><br>the guards in east and west freeport will not kill you immediately, but don't go anywhere near the mages guild i think it is or you will be killed.<br><br>in general the only parts of freeport that it makes sense for you to go to are the tunnels where the evil classes are. even this i would avoid as on the way you can easily fall into a pool filled with drowned citizens that are instant death the first few lvls.<br><br>i would hunt near one of the big 3 cities i pointed out in your early years. nerriak sadly is the only one of these 3 where you will be able to train skills though. kind of frustrating at times.<br><br>feel free to post back with any other specific questions you have. there are a lot of smart and helpful people in this forum that know alot about being an sk. if you want to be a successful sk - read it regularly.<br><br>i know it has helped me.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu Jun 13 13:13:27 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>To me, being hated everywhere you go actually has some appeal, for a couple of reasons.<br><br>Firstly, as an IKS, ORG, TRL, DE SK (especially the IKS), you are definitely not welcome in a lot of areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as an SK, you arent going to be loved anyway, so that drawback is somewhat mitigated.  In other words, they can't hate you twice...  =)<br><br>Gnome, Human, &amp; ERU SKs are the ones truly suffering from being an SK--the other races are alrdy hated, so no big deal to me.<br><br>Additoinally, and perhaps, more humorous, is the philosophy I adopted.  I have many friends who worry a lot about faction--&quot;I CANT KILL THERE&quot; or &quot;I CANT KILL THAT&quot; are common things I hear and I chuckle all the time.<br><br>They are suffering from NOT being a dark race SK is the way that I like to look at it.  My philosophy---They hate me?  I HATE EM BACK!!  There is little to worry about killing when most hate you, so you can hunt anywhere &amp; kill most anything with a smile on your face.<br><br>Try putting together a Plane of Growth raid sometime (where armor the equivalent of Thurg armor drops, but you do NOT need to get any silly gems or turn them into anybody--you loot it, you put it on).  It seems that 1/2 the people you meet will NOT hunt there becuase they dont want to ruin Tunare/Gfay faction--ESPECIALLY the High-elf CLRs.<br><br>95% of the time, I could care less about faction.  Damaging CoV faction is really the ONLY time I have taken any measures from NOT killing a MOB (becuase I need to finish getting SS armor).<br><br>Moral of the message??  Enjoy playing a &quot;dark&quot; SK--they are hilarious &amp; you dont have to worry about a lot of other crap-ola that others do...<br><br>Lunatic<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I am willing to walk around all Norath to come my home Grobb.  Oh its ugly and thats the way I like it.  <br><br>Have you ever caressed a ugly female Troll and hear that awesome belch and foul breath she breathes from eating a Freeport Guard.  Turns me on.  <br><br>Anyway I care for nothing besides me Troll Race.  I tolerate Ogres.  Will eat a occasional Dark Elf.  But very fond of the taste of Halfing, Human, High Elf, Erudite, Wood Elf, Gnome, Dwarf.  Iskar is not so tasty, unless you let them rott a week or too.<br><br>Anyway dont be concerned about whom likes you they all can make a meal and never ever forget your ugly female trolls, OH YEAHH.  <br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>
