by the number of items continuously posted and bid upon, it is obviously
very popular.&nbsp; My personal reading of Verant's statement on the sale
of items and characters is that they are warning people that, like any
real life transaction, there is a chance of things going wrong, and, more
importantly from their perspective, they are disclaiming any responsibility
for any problems you may encounter.</font></b>

I was pretty sure right from the start was a hoax, for a variety of reasons

very nicely done quest [Verant is defintely getting better at the quests]

<p><b><font color="#000066">October 20, 1999:&nbsp; This is a quick update
because an e-mail was sent here (and also to EQ Vault, EQ'Lizer and EQ
Stratics) claiming to have the complete details of the <a href="quests/Fiery_Avenger.htm">Fiery
Avenger Quest</a>.&nbsp; I have to say that it is either accurate or an
incredibly well done, elaborate hoax.&nbsp; I am inclined to believe it
is a hoax.&nbsp; But, I can verify that most of the items he says you need
and most of the side quests he claims you have to do actually exist.&nbsp;
However, I have no idea if you actually get the Fiery Avenger in the end,
and it will take someone a huge amount of time and effort to complete it
to find out.&nbsp; Making no judgment one way or another, I am posting
it exactly as sent in for you to read and attempt if you are so inclined.&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the very least it makes for some interesting reading.&nbsp; --&nbsp;
I've gotten several e-mails on this almost uniformly agreeing that it is
a fake, so just be warned.&nbsp; I leave it to the judgment of the visitors
to decide for him or herself.&nbsp; At the very least it gets people thinking
about this quest so that maybe we can actually solve it if it exists.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">For those of you who have been wondering whether
Asheron's Call is going to be the new Everquest, you have a chance to check
it out for free.&nbsp; Microsoft is allowing people to download the beta
for free and play until this Sunday.&nbsp; You can get the download at
this link:&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b> <b><font color="#000066"><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/asheron/Install/3/W9X/EN-US/acbeta3.exe">Free
Asheron's Call Beta</a> .&nbsp; A warning for those, like me, who prefer
Netscape to Explorer.&nbsp; Bill Gates doesn't like Netscape.&nbsp; So
if you try and get on Microsoft's game using Netscape, it will just screw
around with you and ultimately fail.&nbsp; So when it launches your browser,
just copy the address, close out Netscape, and launch the address in IE.&nbsp;
I played it for about an hour last night.&nbsp; While it is hard to make
a call based upon one hour's play, I have to say I was not really impressed.&nbsp;
The graphics were kind of cheesy, the controls were choppy, the multiple
windows were annoying, and I was getting a lot of lag with only about 200
people on the server.&nbsp; It certainly didn't compare with the mind blowing
experience of entering Everquest for the first time.&nbsp; Of course, I'll
have to play it a little more to really be able to decide on it.</font></b>

images and descriptions of the new class-specific items and quests for
this update.&nbsp; Thanks to the many people who sent in item images, many
of the new items are now listed (except the Paladins, who probably have
the most complex quests of any class).&nbsp; I also have the details on

<p><b><font color="#000066">October 14, 1999:&nbsp; Whew.&nbsp; Busy day.&nbsp;
I know everyone is anxious to know what was added in the last patch, and
knowing this was coming ahead of time, I rearranged my schedule so that
I could basically spend all day sorting through my mail trying to get it
together for you.&nbsp; Thanks to all of you who sent in information about
the new items and quests.&nbsp; Without your contributions, this site could
not exist.&nbsp; I think I have most of the new quests down, and some of
the new items as well, although I still have very little information on
the paladin quests for some reason.&nbsp; I assume people will be completing
the quests over the weekend.&nbsp; If you get an item I don't yet have
listed, please send it in to me in gif or jpg format.&nbsp; Here is the
scoop.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">Be forewarned.&nbsp; Most of the new quests
are very difficult to do.&nbsp; I was pretty amused to find an e-mail from
almost every class complaining about how their class had the hardest quests.&nbsp;
They are all tough.&nbsp; In my opinion, Shamen have the most right to
complain, although I assume Verant will patch it soon so that the people
who give out the quests don't kill 2/3 of the shamen who come looking for
it.&nbsp; I do anticipate several things with this patch.&nbsp; First,
Unrest is going to be even more crowded than it already is.&nbsp; Many
of the quests have you going to Unrest several times for key items.&nbsp;
Second, this won't stop camping, just spread it out a little.&nbsp; Many
of the items are still located on single creatures that spawn in set places,
and most of the quest items are no drop.&nbsp; Third, if you are a casual
gamer who can only get on a few hours at a time, forget about getting most
of these pieces, at least at first.&nbsp; Since most of the quest items
are no drop and will be highly camped, there will either be a waiting list
like the jboots used to have or a free for all to see who gets them first.&nbsp;
I am told most of the armor pieces are no drop as well (although I have
not seen statistics for many as the quests take a while to do) so you won't
be able to buy them either.&nbsp; Fourth, Verant may finally have found
a use for the trade skills.&nbsp; Several quests require items made from
the skills, especially blacksmithing, although people are not going to
be happy about being forced to take up a trade.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">Here are the quest and armor additions by class:</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Warriors Crafted Armor has been updated so that each piece gets a stat
bonus of some sort.&nbsp; Very nice change.&nbsp; I have graphics for each
crafted item in the equipment section.&nbsp; (follow the equipment links
below).&nbsp; The quest still goes out of </font><a href="quests/Q_SKaranas.htm">Southern
Karana</a><font color="#000066">.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rogues now can get Ravenscale armor in Cazic Thule.&nbsp; There is no quest
for this.&nbsp; As far as I can tell it drops in exact correspondence with
where the pieces of Rubicite dropped.&nbsp; This armor is lore, but not
no drop.&nbsp; I have stats/images for the&nbsp;</font> <a href="equipment/head.htm">Coif</a><a href="equipment/hands.htm">Gloves</a><a href="equipment/feet.htm">Boots</a><a href="equipment/legs.htm">Leggings</a><font color="#000066">and</font><a href="equipment/chest.htm">Chestguard</a></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shamen can get Totemic Armor (I'm not completely certain of the name) through
a quest in </font><a href="quests/Q_Lake_Rathe.htm">Lake Rathe</a><font color="#000066">
at the Barbarian Fishing Village.&nbsp; Of course right now Trolls and
Ogres are Killed on Site by the Barbarians who give out the quest&nbsp;
Gotta love that one.&nbsp; I haven't seen any stats yet for the armor,
so I don't know if it is no drop.&nbsp; If you are a Shaman, you might
want to take up blacksmithing, since each piece requires the equivalent
piece of banded armor to make.&nbsp; Several of the items you need are
virtually
impossible to get due to being very rare drops on very rare spawns.&nbsp;
Good luck.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rangers can get Ivy Etched Armor from a quest in </font><a href="quests/Q_Kith.htm">Kithicor
Forest</a><font color="#000066">.&nbsp; The few screenshots I have gotten
show the armor is lore, but not no drop, but I believe those shots were
taken on the test server.&nbsp; The items you need almost all drop from
static named spawns.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Paladins can get Armor of Ro from the Paladin camp in the </font><a href="quests/Q_Rathe_Mountains.htm">Rathe
Mountains</a><font color="#000066">.&nbsp; These quests are the ones I
have the least information on at this time.&nbsp; I am pretty sure that
you must have the blacksmithing skill to accomplish this.&nbsp; And if
you want to get the full set, you will have to raise your faction with
every Paladin Guild in Norrath, because each of them controls a piece of
armor.&nbsp; The biggest part of these quests seems to be spending time
killing orcs and such to raise faction and also time to raise your smithing
skills.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shadowknights can get Darkforge armor from an undead knight who spawns
in </font><a href="quests/Q_Mist.htm">Mistmoore</a><font color="#000066">.&nbsp;
The problem is that he spawns in a place where he is readily seen and killed
by other players, so is rarely actually there.&nbsp; Most of the items
you need are in Cazic Thule, where I guess you can group up with the Rogues
camping the Ravenscale Armor.&nbsp; Also, you need to kill Freeport and
Qeynos guards for several pieces, which is sure to make you very popular
with the people in those zones.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bards, Clerics, Wizards, Enchanters, Necromancers and Magicians all have
quests for items and armor in the new </font><a href="quests/Q_Temple_Solusek.htm">Temple
of Solusek Ro</a><font color="#000066"> Zone.&nbsp; A warning.&nbsp; Do
not talk to the effrete there or the inhabitants will take a severe dislike
to you and at the least stop giving out quests if they don't simply kill
you.&nbsp; Necromancers are going to have to take up tailoring in order
to get the shadow silk you need for the quests.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Druids have had a few new quests for weapons added in the&nbsp; </font><a href="quests/Q_Rathe_Mountains.htm">Rathe
Mountains</a><font color="#000066"> , but really don't get much in this
patch.&nbsp; (Rathe is also where the new jboot quest has moved).</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Monks will have to be happy with the cured silk armor they added the last
patch that have them all suddenly taking up the arts of brewing and tailoring.&nbsp;
(Certainly nothing to complain about there).</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000066">October 13, 1999:&nbsp; Todays patch really
adds some nice features to the game.&nbsp; They've gotten some deservedly
bad press lately, but Verant deserves a lot of credit for addressing several
nagging issues and continuing to add new features to the game.&nbsp; The
trade problem is now fixed so that a player cannot swap items on you once
he has put it in the trade window.&nbsp; Kill stealing suddenly got much
more difficult, since the aggregate group damage determines who gets the
kill, not the damage done by each individual.&nbsp; And I like all of the
new quests being added.&nbsp; I'm not sure why they felt obligated to make
certain patches optional, except I guess it gives someone who is desparate
to get into the game right away the option of putting a long download off
to another night.&nbsp; I personally can't imagine choosing to not d/l
every available feature.&nbsp; I know everyone is rushing out to do the
new quests and get the new items.&nbsp; If you are planning to submit screenshots,

<p><b><font color="#000066">October 11, 1999:&nbsp; For those of you who
don't know yet, there is a big patch coming on Wednesday which will eliminate
future drops of Rubicite armor (the existing armor will not be affected),
and add a new zone called the Temple of Solusek Ro, which has many quests
to get class-specific armor to replace rubicite.&nbsp; They have been fine
tuning the Solusek zone on the test server, and I believe that I now have
most of the quests listed in the </font><a href="quests/Q_Temple_Solusek.htm">Solusek
quest section</a><font color="#000066">. I would not be surprised if some
of the details there change though and if some additional ones are still
added prior to the patch, so use the info with caution.&nbsp; I also expect
that zone to be loaded with people for the first few days, so I would suggest
you don't go there if you have a slow computer or are not a fairly high
level capable of doing the quests.&nbsp; The patch should also change the
jboots so that only lower levels can get them in Najeena and higher levels
have to do a quest, which I believe may go through Rathe Mountains.&nbsp;
I'll post more after I find out the details.</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000066">October 8, 1999:&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; The site
hit 2,000,000 visits yesterday!&nbsp; After my post about Hamek, several
people have e-mailed me that he pulled the same trick on them, and others
told me there are people on other servers doing the same thing, so be careful.&nbsp;
Also, so it is clear, I am only talking about a Hamek on the Povar server.&nbsp;
I have been told that the test server already has a fix for the trade window
exploit so that you cannot take an item out of the trade window without
cancelling the trade, so it is possible that this will be fixed as of Tuesday's
patch.</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000066">October 7, 1999:&nbsp; For those of you that
have not heard of this, there is a bug that allows a person to switch the
item in the trade screen and give you a different item than you bargained
for and saw in the window.&nbsp; I think this is an exploit and should
be a bannable offense.&nbsp; I also thinkVerant should make fixing this
a high priority because trading is an integral part of the game and once
people start to distrust the trading process, an important part of the
game will deteriorate.&nbsp; Until then, I would suggest only trading for
higher level items with higher level characters to avoid easily deleted
mules.&nbsp; Of course that is not a guarantee, but very few people would
risk ruining their main character's reputation by exploiting this bug.&nbsp;
I bring this up because of a person named Hamek who, despite his level,
exploited this bug and switched items on a person on my server (Povar).&nbsp;
It is his misfortune that she happened to be my sister, and thus one of
the few people whose word I trust enough to post this based upon her word
alone.&nbsp; If you are on Povar, it might be prudent to not trade with
this Hamek person.</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000066">October 4, 1999:&nbsp; I see a nice trend developing
in the quests in the game.&nbsp; It seems like many quests are now giving
out some nice rewards.&nbsp; There are now a number of pretty good items

the game.&nbsp; Also, there were apparantly a couple of good GM quests
