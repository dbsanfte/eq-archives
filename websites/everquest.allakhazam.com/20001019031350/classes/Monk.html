<p><b>The monk is supposed to be the best fighting class in the game in
terms of dealing out damage over time.&nbsp; In addition, Monks are able
to resist fire better than other classes, getting + 8 to fire resistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Because he can't wear heavy armor (weight is very important to a monk),
he takes more damage when hit,&nbsp; but the monk's natural quickness allows
him to avoid more hits than other fighters and hit the enemy more often.&nbsp;
A monk's weapons are his fists, as well as the magical special attacks
he gains as he advances in level (which provide some great looking animations).
Monks also get some excellent 1HB weapons, so many monks are now using
some weapons.&nbsp; Monks dish out some incredible damage, since they get
dual wield and double attack very early, resulting in many attacks per
round.&nbsp; No other tank class can match them at this.&nbsp; They also
get some useful skills such as feign death, which is a great skill for
avoiding death and pulling, mend, which heals 25% of their health, as well
as safe fall.&nbsp; If you play a monk, you will definitely fill the role
of a tank in a group.&nbsp; This is not a great solo class, but it can
be soloed with a lot of patience.&nbsp; Only Humans and Iksar can play
a Monk.</b>
