	   <tr><td colspan=2>I hope that everyone is finding what I write somewhat useful. This one is going to light alot of fires but this is from my personal experience having played my cleric for 46 levels now and seems to be pretty much standard from what i have heard from other clerics in game. I hope to clarify the role of clerics in EQ later in a clerics life. This is more geared towards new clerics of people wanting to make a cleric.<br><br>Warrior Cleric. When can we get into the mix and fight? From the early levels a Cleric can easily hold their own in combat. We have the advantage of plate armor so we can get high AC and the ability to use Blunt Weapons. No class really defines itself truely at low levels. Once We hit level 13 or so we start to really notice that we are not doing that much damage in combat compared to other classes. At level 13 meelee classes start to get dual wield and double attack which means that potentially they can do 4x the damage that we do. But, we are still called upon, at times, to engage in combat and "help out". At level 20 it becomes very noticable that we are not efficient in combat. All meelee classes have at least double attack (and dual wield if allowed by class). This means that our meelee damage output is next to none. All I can say is get used to it.<br><br>We are not meant to be combat oriented by design. You will find your weapon skills, Offense and Defense skills, all falling behind. Higher caps on weapon skills for meelee classes puts them&nbsp;&nbsp;several steps ahead and the less you find yourself in combat the slower your skills will go up. This is the way that you entire careen will go if you are going to be a truely good cleric. But, there may be some exceptions. With the proper equipemnt (Ringed Mace of Ykesha, Etheral Mist armor, Cloak of Flames, etc) a cleric could become a formidable force in combat as a support warrior and support healer. The only way this becomes efficient is if you have another cleric in your group who is going to do the healing, if you have some very nice buffs from a friendly shaman, and your group is willing to let you try. The key is to get a VERY high dexterity. Dex will let your Ykesha proc more and that is the damage you are wanting to produce. I have yet to speak to a cleric (or read about a cleric) that can do more damage with a weapon in combat than they could with their spells in combat. Nevertheless, I am slowly accumulating my Armor and Dexterity items so that I can, for an hour or a day, be combat cleric from hell and show everyone that Clerics do NOT need to be one dimensional.<br><br>Nuking Cleric- Being a nuking cleric in a group can be alot of fun and we become very efficient at it at different levels. Again, in most cases you will want to have 2 clerics in your group, but this is far from necessary. You see, the difference between a cleric and an Intelligence caster is that we can wear armor. This can make all the difference in the world. When I cast a nuke on an undead target in Lower Guk and hit them for 585dmg they will almost always turn to me. This is not a problem. We have good hitpoint buffs and AC buffs as well as good armor to wear so we can take a pounding even from the Froglok Ghoul Lord if needed. We can also use Divine Aura and Divine Barrier to "anti-taunt" if we get too much of a beating. We never need to be healed by the other cleric as we can heal ourselves. What does this mean all together? We are totally self-sufficient when casting. I never call for help, ask for a heal, run around trying to get a mob off me and pissing off the tanks.<br><br>We also have a very nice line of Stun spells. At level 49 we have 4 stun spells that we can pretty much chain cast (with about 6 seconds of medding between each spell) and keep a mob immobilized.  This is greatly helpful against casting mobs that are tearing through your group and more mana efficient than having to heal  your entire group from a area damage spell that the mob kept casting. Our non-undead Direct Damage is average as far as mana efficiency so I tend to not use a nuking cleric tactic against live mobs. It also has a recast time, unlike our undead DD, so it is not terribly useful for quickly dropping a target. Non-undead DD does work perfectly with your stun spells as the recast time will fit into the casting time of a stun. Hence Stun/nuke/stun/nuke. It is always important to keep your skills up with your most used damage spells as fizzling when you are trying to solo can easily get you killed (I will write about Soloing later)<br><br>Bottom line with nuking cleric tactics is you really need to have 2 clerics. I often nuke in a group when i am the only cleric ONLY when I am 90% mana and we are not in any real danger. I always try to keep mana at 80% if possible. But throw in your stun's. Throw in a nuke. People will NEVER complain  if they never die and you can help take a mob out quicker which means less mana spent on healing. Preventative healing is blasting a mob into the next life. IF you do get a person complaining about it in your group, explain to them how much damage you do, keep everyone informed of your mana level. If you talk to a group while you are playing then they get "a feel" for you and will quickly learn the lesson "Never Question the Cleric".<br><br>Healing Cleric- Healing. This is what you were born for. This is what you will do 90% of your time. Med/Heal/Med/Heal. Sound boring? Only if you want it to be. The thing about a cleric is that we always seem to find ourselves as leading the group. We get low on mana, the group waits. We continually monitor the health of the entire group and we keep them healthy. Its hard to be bored when you are in a fight and need to be as efficient as possible. My spell lineup is typically this... Divine Aura, Divine Barrier, Stun 1, Stun 2, Stun 3, Greater Healing, Superior Healing and Complete healing.<br><br>Know your mana pool and spell costs. Our healing spells become more efficient as we go up in levels so it pays to be as efficient as possible. Greater healing is for your casters. As a rule, heal your casters with greater healing as soon as they start to take damage and lose a bubble of health. Greater Healing takes them right back up but you should cast immediately. An enchanter will die very quickly if you do not. Keep them healthy. Superior Healing is for your hybrids. Typically they tend to have slightly less HP than a Warrior but they also take more damage than a typical warrior. I always heal my hybrids once they have lost one and a half to two bubbles of health. Superior healing will take them pretty much to full again. Naturally your spells and level will vary than mine but the concept is the same. Med between heals, keep your group informed as to how much mana you have left and work with any backup healers if you find yourself gettting really low (40% is getting low).<br><br>Know your casting times like you know your own face. This becomes the most important thing when you are using Complete Heal. Complete heal has around a 10 second casting time. Complete heal is very mana efficient with Warriors and can be efficient with hybrids if they are taking a real beating. Timing all depends on how badly the tank is being hit and how quickly they are losing health. Typically against a single target I will CH my tank when he is at 2 bubbles of health. Some people wait to see "soandso has gone bezerk". In some cases that is a good time. In no circumstances should you not heal. For example, your tank gets just to the point when you are going to heal him with CH and then the mob switches to another tank and starts beating him/her. Heal your first tank anyways. Why? You do not want to be put into a position where you must chose which is going to live or die because the 2nd tank is now low as well and something in the room spawned and is beating the crap out of your enchanter. Use superior heal or whatever you chose, but always try to keep everyone of your tanks at 50% if multiple are getting the beat down. That way you keep everyone consistently healthy.<br><br>You may wish to vary this tactic but you will find your own niche as you play and grow as a cleric. Some clerics heal everyone all the time and keep them all at full health. This is nice and "secure" but you will find yourself always low on mana and that is not good if you really have a tough fight coming. I always tell my Tanks when a Complete Heal is coming. Once your tanks know how you play they will not worry. Every warrior trusts his/her cleric until the time when the cleric fails to keep them alive. So, never let anyone die and they will fight to the last pixel of health completely confident that you will heal them. A tank that runs is a tank that dies and a group that soon dies after.<br><br>I hope that this has given some new clerics a little to look forward to. What it comes down to is knowing your skills and the skills of the group that you are in. You decide the fate of your group so chose wisely for each situation and you will excel in EQ.<br><br>ADDITIONAL NOTE- Always use Valor/Resolution on all members of your group. Those extra HP can keep an enchanter alive an additional 3-5 seconds in a bad situation.<br>&nbsp;<br>Vilaraa Innoruuk<br>45th Cycle of Pain and Devotion<br>Priestess of Pain<br>Wrath of Innoruuk</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Greetings,<br><br>I am Balamur Stoutfaith, a 38th level Dwarven Cleric on the Morell Thule server and I speak from personal experience about what Vilaraa here mentions.<br><br>Often times, if the group is working as a team, I will be at full mana and the party will be at or near full health. I spend most of my time in the "typical" healing cleric role, in that I heal and med and then heal some more. However, if all of the party is at 90% health or above and I am at 90% mana or above, I will start to do some "preventative healing". By this I mean...<br><br>1) Stuns on casters or mobs that are dishing serious damage. In a smoothly operating group, a stun timed correctly will effectively nullify that mob completely. For example, mobs that flee at low health... stun them at quarter health (depends on how fast your tanks dish damange). Your tanks will continue to pound, and by the time the mob "wakes up" it will be trying to run and not be dealing damage anymore (wouldn't suggest this w/o someone who's dedicated to root/snare).<br>2) Nukes when there is a big pull. This serves several purposes that only a big healer would understand. Druids, Shamans and other backup healers just do not understand how big of a taunt a 650+ HP heal is.<br><br> Now let's think this through. Say your puller comes back with 3 targets. Everyone assists him, and the Enchanter mez's the other 2. At this point, 2 are aggro to the enchanter and 1 to the tanks. The second I cast a heal spell, chances are very high that the 2 mez'd will shift aggro to me, and very likely the 1 being attacked already! However, if I spend a few pixels of mana to drop a 200+ damage nuke into the first one so that it drops faster... a) Your tanks took less damage because they had to fight a shorter time, b) Your tanks have more stamina for the next fight, c) NOTHING IS AGGRO TO THE HEALER (i.e. ME). A measly 200 damage into a mob will rarely ever aggro it if it already has a target. This means that when the other 2 are engaged, or break mez on their own, I can cast again without interruption from the 2 mez'd mobs pouncing me.<br><br>This system works so well I have been in a party for several hours before anyone KNEW I was nuking at all. In fact, I once had the amusement of seeing someone ask in group chat "Is this Struck by Wrath message my weapon proc'ing?". The reason a lot of people are pre-disposed to argue a Cleric is not a nuker is because they have no experience with it. And unfortunately, neither do most clerics! More than once I have had to defend the way I keep my party healthy to clerics as much as 10 levels higher than me that knew absolutely nothing about nuking because they never EVER have done it.<br><br>It all comes down to experience and knowledge. As a Cleric, I have been nuking since day 1 and have not stopped in the 38 levels I have played. I've never had a complaint, though I have gotten in a few arguments over it (ironically, almost always with other Clerics). You just have to know when it's appropriate, when it will help more than hinder, etc. But once you know how and when to use these offensive spells, they become just one more way you can keep the party alive.<br><br>Balamur Stoutfaith<br>38th Circle of Devotion<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>
