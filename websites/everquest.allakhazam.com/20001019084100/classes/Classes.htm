<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The choice of
what class to play is really one of personal preference.&nbsp;
They all have advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp; One major factor
in your choice of class is whether you plan on grouping or playing
alone.&nbsp; There are some classes that just aren't suitable
to play solo.&nbsp; Read the descriptions carefully before picking
a solo class.&nbsp; Of course, every class is fun to play in a
group, and grouping is really encouraged in the game design.&nbsp;
Therefore,&nbsp; I would suggest you choose your class based upon
how you would like to play in a group.&nbsp; This needs to fit
your personality and how you like to play within the game.&nbsp;
I see the classes in three categories (with some crossover of
categories):</B></P>

<P><B>1.&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#990000">Fighter Types</FONT> - or
tanks as they are referred to in the game - including Warriors,
Paladins, Rangers, Shadow Knights,&nbsp; Monks, and maybe Rogues.&nbsp;
Clerics, Shamen, Druids and Bards can fill this role in a pinch,
as can the pets of Necromancers and Magicians, but not very efficiently.&nbsp;
These classes see the most action.&nbsp; They are always at the
forefront of every battle, and they rarely find themselves out
of the action.&nbsp; If you like wading into every battle, shouting
bonzai, and hacking off heads and limbs, this is for you.&nbsp;
Because every party can use multiple fighters, you will never
be at a loss for a group.&nbsp; However, these classes are tougher
to solo and lack the means to travel and to extricate themselves
from tough battles that the magic classes have.&nbsp; The first
time you have to run back to town to buy stuff, you will really
envy that magic user's gate spell.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lack of the
ability to bind can also be frustrating to a tank.&nbsp; It is
also very expensive to buy equipment for most of these classes,
and heaven help you if you die somewhere where you can't retrieve
your corpse, forcing you to repurchase all of your armor all over
again.</B></P>

<P><B>2.&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#990000">Magic Support </FONT>- including
Clerics, Enchanters, Shamen, Bards, and Druids, and to some extent
Magicians and Necromancers (though they really fit the third category
better).&nbsp; These classes, while possessing some offensive
skills (especially the Shaman, Bard and Druid), are far more valuable
in how they enhance the skills of other party members.&nbsp; Most
of them are very difficult to solo (except the magician, druid
and necromancer).&nbsp; Their primary role is to buff the fighters
with enhancements and defenses and debuff the monsters to make
them easier to hit and kill, then stand back and let the fighters
do the dirty work.&nbsp; Their role in a battle is then support
by healing, charming, etc.&nbsp; They are also very useful for
traveling, healing, sneaking around and other non combat related
stuff.&nbsp; You may enjoy these classes better if you are the
type who likes to role play more than just kill and level.&nbsp;
The healers are also supposed to keep track of the hit points
of each party member and keep them from dying.&nbsp; If you chose
one of these classes, you should be happy with the fact that while
you may not be the hero that demolished the monster, you were
the one who made it possible for that hero to do his job.&nbsp;
Every party needs one or two of these classes, especially the
healers.</B></P>

<P><B>3.&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#990000">Magic Attack</FONT> - including
Wizards, Necromancers and Magicians, and to some extent Druids.&nbsp;
These classes have the ability through firepower and summoning
to quickly kill monsters when the fighters start to get low, and
most importantly, kill off the monsters who break off and run
for help before they can summon their big brothers to whoop your
butt.&nbsp; This is especially true of the wizard, who has no
crossover and really only fits into this category, yet does it
best of them all.&nbsp; Except for the wizard, These are the best
solo classes in the game.&nbsp; If you play one of these classes,
you have to be prepared to sit back and patiently bide your time
while the fighters bash at the monsters, conserving your mana
to strike where it is most effective and, for necros and magicians,
directing your pet to the most useful area.&nbsp; You should also
be prepared to spend a lot of the game staring at the inside of
your spellbook, meditating to get back spent mana.</B></P>
