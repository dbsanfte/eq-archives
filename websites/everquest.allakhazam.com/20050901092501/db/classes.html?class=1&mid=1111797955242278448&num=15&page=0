<p>Are you kidding me? <br />Knights Tanking? <br /> <br />I'm so tired of all the talk about Palies and aggro.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Personally I think at the lvl most people play now stun is almost a nonfactor.   <br />With hate procing weapons, bellow, and good weapon aggro Warriors blow Palies away for aggro.   <br /> <br />It's gotten so bad that they had to give knights a big new sword with planer stun.   <br /> <br />I was in Sol Ro the other night and we had a new Pali with us.  He and the druid were talking about how they could get aggro when ever they wanted (not sure why a durid would want aggro...).  Anyway the Pali was lvl 63 and decided he wanted to get aggro.  So the next fight he cast stun early, mob stays on me.  He cast stun again, mob still dosen't move.  Pali decides to sit down, Mob don't even look his way.   <br /> <br />Now sure enough someone will say that if a pali chain stunts he can out aggro a warrior.  Maybe so, but I've yet to see a chanin stunning pali in an exp group. Furthermore most mobs i fight are not stuned.  yes you get aggro for a stun but the mob dosen't stop attacking.  So a chain stuning pali just resluts in the mob living longer and beating on the tank longer.  <br /> <br />The truth is that Knights haven't been the perferd tank in a group setting since warriors were given bellow etc.  Sure they can do a good job tanking, but they are no longer perfered as MT in a group.  In fact most knights I've grouped with don't want to MT they are busys doing the things they are best at.  <br /> <br />As for a knight having more hps and ac...I told you not to make a woodelf warrior...</p>

<p>Several flaws in your argument WJ. <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />Personally I think at the lvl most people play now stun is almost a nonfactor. <hr size="1" /></blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Never have I heard anyone say that. In fact, my guild's RL occasionally has to remind pallies not to stun too much as thy occasionally pull aggro from him when one of them goes stun crazy (Not me of course =p). Keep in mind he as his 1.5 with an aggro aug. <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />With hate procing weapons, bellow, and good weapon aggro Warriors blow Palies away for aggro. <hr size="1" /></blockquote>  <br />ROFL! Only if the pally is significantly underquipped to the warrior. Remember, pallies can use hate procing weapons too. If a pally and a warrior are equally equipped, the paladin will generally out aggro the warrior. <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />Anyway the Pali was lvl 63 and decided he wanted to get aggro. So the next fight he cast stun early, mob stays on me. He cast stun again, mob still dosen't move. Pali decides to sit down, Mob don't even look his way. <hr size="1" /></blockquote>  <br />What was the level difference? Gear? What stuns was the paladin using? You are drawing a conclusion from little info. If warriors could out agggro knights, why are knights usually the preferred tank on TZ, especially on the RZ script? <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />yes you get aggro for a stun but the mob dosen't stop attacking. So a chain stuning pali just resluts in the mob living longer and beating on the tank longer. <hr size="1" /></blockquote>  <br />Bellow and such also dont stun the mob, so the mob is still beating on the tank, so no difference then, opther than amount of aggro most likely. <br /> <br />If both are equivlently equipped, and similarly skiled players, both tank quite well with no real preferrence. Knights still have better aggro than warrios (though the difference is not as glaring as it was for awhile). Warriors make up for this, however, by having deeper hp/ac reserves which means a cleric is going to get a lot more milage out of their heals, expecially complete heal. Also, warriors lack a dependance on mana the the knights have to deal with.</p>

Pallies couldn't generate enough hate to make a usable tank.  <br />Just using weapon aggro (no procs no casting) warriors have and still blow knights away for aggro.  That is the main reasion Pallies were given the low lvl stuns.  <br /> <br />Yes Knights can use procing weapons but they can not ues anger 3 and the like.  A warrior can have two more procs than any Knight can.  Furthermore more often than not a warrior will have procs that generate more hate.  <br /> <br />So we see that the Pallie is already significantly behind the warrior in aggro generation and has to use spells to get back into the game.   <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" /> <br />Bellow and such also dont stun the mob, so the mob is still beating on the tank, so no difference then, opther than amount of aggro most likely. <br /><hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />The differance is that inorder to mach the aggro of a warrior a Pali has to spend considerable time casting stun.  While you are casting stun you are not attacking with your weapons.  Since the warrior has to &quot;cast&quot; bellow or incite or what ever only once or twice they spend more time attacking the mob.  So the mob dies faster.   <br /> <br />Now young Knight only at the end do you learn the true power of Bellow.   <br />Even with incite i could hold aggro most of the time with just about any decent weapon.  Didn't even need ones with hate or stun procs.  With bellow i don't even loss aggro when the slower cast just after i engage the mob (assuming i pulled).   <br /> <br />So lets review <br />For weapons only aggro warriros blow pallies away <br />For proc aggro warriors blow pallies away. <br />And Palies have no answer for Bellow or incite. <br /> <br />Sure casting a lot of stuns can keep you in the game...but then the more you cast the longer the mob lives <br /> <br />[</p>

<p><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />Well as far as aggro goes pallies are significantly underequipped. <hr size="1" /></blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Not by a long shot. <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />So we see that the Pallie is already significantly behind the warrior in aggro generation and has to use spells to get back into the game.<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br />Point being? Yes we have to use spells to maintain aggro. You seem to think that is a problem or makes us weaker? Those stuns can quickly generate huge amounts of aggro. The warriors finally had to be given the Provoke line of disciplines to keep up with us. Prior to that line, unless you were a high end raiding warrior and could get things like BoC/BoW, you had significant issues. Even the warriors knew it, as they were complaining about it every chance they got. Provoke brought things back up close again (though it did not surpass what the stuns can do). <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />The differance is that inorder to mach the aggro of a warrior a Pali has to spend considerable time casting stun.<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br />Not really. The stuns used for agggro generation have only a 1.0 cast time (except Cease, which is 1.5). Most weapon delays are longer than that. Yes, we do lose some DPS, but not much. I lose maybe 5 point DPS when I am stunning compared to when I am not. Also, when stun lands, I also stop the mob from htting me. Bellow lacks that ability. <img border="0" src="/shared/smilies/yikes.gif" alt="icon"/> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />Now young Knight only at the end do you learn the true power of Bellow. <hr size="1" /></blockquote>  <br />First off, I am not young <img border="0" src="/shared/smilies/grin.gif" alt="icon"/> (67 season and over 30 in RL. And no, I am not saying by how much) <br />I am quite aware of what bellow and other prvoke discs do. Generate around 7-800 hate and can only be used once every 30 seconds. During that time I have cast about 8 stuns totaling around 3500 hate. Yes, this probably means you will have a slight advantage for about 5 seconds (until I get my second stun off) then I am in the lead on that front. <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />So lets review  <br />For weapons only aggro warriros blow pallies away <hr size="1" /></blockquote>  <br />Irrelavant, becasue no one tries to hold aggro with just melee.  <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />For proc aggro warriors blow pallies away. <hr size="1" /></blockquote>  <br />Yes, warriors have an advantage here, but again, no one tries to hold aggro with just procs. <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />And Palies have no answer for Bellow or incite<hr size="1" /></blockquote>.  <br />Yes we do. Stuns as shown above. <br />Ultimatley, whatever aggro advantage one class might have over anohter between the 3 tank classes don't mean a whole lot. I only jumped in here because your opening statement of your first response seemed to indicate that you didnt think knights were capable of tanking, which of course we do just fine. Groups lacking a tank don't just look for warriors, they look for any of the three tanks. All3 can maintain aggro just fine for tanking provided no one else in the group does anything stupid, such as over nuking. <br />Yes, in most cases if you have both a warrior and a knight in the group, the warrior plays tank. The only exception is if the knight has a signifcant advantage in gear/AAs/level/playing ability. Why? Its not aggro. Its the fact that they have a larger hp reserve which makes life easier on the healers, plus when knights tank, it often keeps them from being able to do other things they can to bolster a party. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Sat Mar 26 12:58:36 2005 by dfrnchman</span></i></p>

The warriors finally had to be given the Provoke line of disciplines to keep up with us. Prior to that line, unless you were a high end raiding warrior and could get things like BoC/BoW,<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />Just as a refresher Palies were given the low lvl stun spell so that they could hold aggro in a group.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to that Palies had a very hard time getting groups because they couldn't hold aggro.   <br />Maybe at lvl 50 450 is a huge amount of aggro, but by lvl 70 it just isn't that much.   <br /> <br />Even in the great day of pali power they were perfered as tanks not because they had more total aggro but because they had snap aggro.  The problem was poorly equiped (compaird to today) groups fighting mobs in the PoP zones.  The Pali with stun could generate enough aggro before the mob reached the group that the slower could slow and not get aggro.  Thus the surivability of the group was significently better.  An intresting aside this is also when shaman started making their come back.   <br /> <br />Frequently I group with a Pali who has some gear from Time.  He has twice the aa i do. He has a number of one handed weapons that have better ratios than my best two hander.  <br /> <br />When he is MT i often use the following combo. <br />Soulpiercer agumented with Rejvenation bone fragment, and a Sludge-Coverd Shortsword.  agumented with a 75dd.   <br />One of the weapons the Knight will use is the Blade of Disruption agumented with a yak or one of the new DoN aguments, don't really remember which.   <br />Now noone would suggest that any of my proc are high aggro.  However during a normal fight the Pali will have to cast 2 stuns to stay ahead of me on the aggro list.  I frequently steal aggro just after mez break, and if he gose too long between stuns <br />In short just to stay ahead of my weapon aggro the Pali has to cast stuns. Even when he has stronger procs.   <br />Ok so now lets say that i switch to my aggro combo with 4 proc as strong as anger III or better.  I should avg 6 proc per minute to generate that much aggro the Pali will have to cast about 8 stuns. <br /> <br />So before we even get to bellow the Pali needs to cast about 10 stuns just to keep up.   <br /> <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />I am quite aware of what bellow and other prvoke discs do. Generate around 7-800 hate and can only be used once every 30 seconds. During that time I have cast about 8 stuns totaling around 3500 hate.<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />You left out the Dot like part of Bellow.  It generates hate just like a dot, on top of the snap aggro.  If while breaking mez i fail tanut twice i break it anyway.  This is because 9 out of 10 times bellow will generate enough hate in that amount of time for me to hold aggro.   <br />FYI the dot componet of the Provoke line last for 1 minute and like you said can be recast ever 30 sec. <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />Quote:And Palies have no answer for Bellow or incite. <br />Yes we do. Stuns as shown above. <hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />No you don't as shown above you need stun just to keep up with weapons aggro and proc aggro.   <br /> <br />If you want to say that you cast stun 12 times during a 60 to 90 minute fight then you might.  But I would say that a knight casting stun that often is an exception.  <br /> <br />And as you suggested there are better uses of a Knights mana than trying to generate hate like a warrior.   <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />[/quote] <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" /><hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" /><hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br />[quote]<hr size="1" /></blockquote></p>

A group with a Warrior as MT can burn the mob down faster because the warrior generated more hate over the lenght of the fight. <br /> <br />Incite has narrowed the gab between warriors and knights in snap aggro.  It has increassed the advantage the warriors have in total hate generation.   <br /> <br />Today for a number of reason (shaman and beast replaciing chanter as the primary slowers, and better armor) snap aggro is less improtant than it was in the early PoP eara.   <br />Also for a number of reasons (ability to stack dots, monster dd etc) total hate generated is more important.   <br /> <br />Furthermore casting stun almost continously is not the best use of  Pali mana or time.   <br />Except for a very few exceptions (when snap aggro is more imprtant than total hate) Palies are infearior to Warriors as MT. And Palies generate less hate than warriors do while exp grinding. <br /> <br />You really should move behond the early PoP based view of the game you seem to be cleaning to.</p>

Which at one point in game history was a key ability.  However even during the great day of Palli power I'm willing to bet that the avg warrior developed more hate over the course of a fight than a Palli did.  In short warriors have always and will always out aggro Pallies.  (As plaied in a tipical exp group) <br /> <br />And in todays game where holding aggro means generating more hate than dubble dots and monster nukes snap aggro at the start of the fight is of very little importance.  </p>

<p>I'm and SK and I'll tell you what, I prefer Warrior's MT'ing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, I handle adds wayyy better if needed (snap poing and AoE agro).  Warrior defensive is HUGE, we cannot compete with 40% damage mitigation.  Pally's come closer to filling the mitigation gap on stunnable mobs then SK's do.  Yes, taps are huge, but doesnt do much if your getting quad'ed for 3k.  A Warrior can take that, an SK cannot. <br /> <br />Soul Guard/Shield (the SK mini mitigation discipline) are their to offset the time it takes for slow to land, but is very limited.  Warriors are designed to tank Gods, and I'm happy with that.  I still have a decent role and dont want to take away a War's main job (which is to tank the REALLY HARD STUFF).  Can and SK do that? (assign me 4 clerics and let the chain CH's begin).  Yeah yeah, I've read about the top 5% of the SK's being able to tank really hard crap too.  Gimme a couple of years and I'll be there.   <br /> <br /></p>

I think what Warrior Joe said at the beggining compared to what he followed up with, should be grouped up together.. read intirely to get a feel as to what was meant rather than the immediate responce to something that sounded offencive, but perhaps wasn't meant to. <br /> <br />Everytime I read his posts, I feel like we are talking about fighting a single mob with tons' of HP&lt; (Making for a rather long fight) rather than an experience group in a DoN zone or mission, or even Ldon for that matter. Experience group mobs generally last about a minute or two, til' dead, in which case that snap aggro can prove (in my experience) to be much better group wise (slows, nuking sooner, etc.) so I always welcome a Pally with equivalent or better gear HP/AC then my warrior.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br />However, in a long fight against mobs that last well over that first few minutes.. Mobs with 100K HP and more, (I'm level 67, Warrior Fyi), I find that a Warrior is alot more suitable for the task at hand. No doubt that an SK, or a Pally with better gear, Levels, HP/AC in this same situation would be the better choice. I have worked with lesser stat pallys, with experience groups, that I happen to be MT in, to stun a Mezzed mob before I engage. Ussually by the time the mobs fighting, I have Aggro, and the chanter or/and slower never get aggro at all. I have less problem then I did before the discs come out, and before my levels went up with aggro, but I still like to use this little trick to keep everything clean. <br /> <br />Sk's are great too, but this thread seemed more of a comparison between the Pally, and the Warrior classes.  <br /> <br />Back to the original postings in this thread. I think that WarriorJoe's intention was to make sure that everyone is aware that the Warrior is in most cases your best choice for a tank (if you happen to have the option before you).</p>

<p>Far as MT goes, I'm gonna say that they all can do a very fine job. The way a person actually plays their class has alot to do with how well they can tank as well. <br /> <br />I have had the opportunity to play with all three, at about equivalent levels/Hp, gear, etc. before. In a group experience, I have always liked the snap aggro of a pally, however I also like the FD Pet pulls of an SK when mobs are considerably tougher. Here is how I have done groups as well as Raid encounters, and sometimes both in the same zones for farming purposes and what not. <br /> <br />In SSRA, I love the SK as MT. IF you have all three classes, (Warrior, Pally, SK) In your group or raid, I love using the SK in this zone. The reason being they can single pull the mobs seeminly easily, as well as tank them without much difficulty, even solo'ing them at levels under 65. Oh, we have used all three as MT at one time or another, but I find the SK very usefull, THe fact that they can pull similarly to a Monk (With the FD Spell) and actually stay alive makes them a great advantage in places where you are fighting a bit tougher mobs.. SSRA to me now is not what it was then, but at level 50 to 60, the place is fun as heck. Similar zones and places make them a very good asset as MT.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br />Pally's are a favorite of mine, the stun for breaking mezz'd mobs just works so well at keeping the aggro where it belongs (On a tank) rather then hitting the mob with a unsuccessful taunt and the mob running at the chanter full speed ahead. Instant aggro, or at least a stun (When mobs can be stunned) Is a great benefit to any group situation, as well as certain Raid situations.  <br /> <br />Now as for the warrior... Your nuts not to take the warrior over the Other two IF they are equivalently geared, and LEVEL. HP/AC etc, can be up to 100 difference in HP and I would still want the Main tank to be the Warrior. In RAID's it's almost a given... The MT is gonna be a Warrior if they are available. <br /> <br />When Leading Raids and I have the opportunity to pick between the three classes.. I ussually set it up (Very simplyfied form) like this. The Puller (Unless of course you have an UBer monk or BARD... YES, I said BARD) I'm gonna pick the SK to pull. This will ensure him being Rampage list as well. Secondary will be the Pally (That snap aggro, got to love it, even if the stun don't work, it ussually makes the mob mad.) Sk being 3rd on the list. Why? Not because an SK can't tank as well as a Pally. It's all a matter of which class could grab aggro faster when the MT goes down. This gives the SK a chance to recoperate from the pull and also ready to take over if the Pally happens to fall. Lastly, putting the SK on the tank list last, (Main tank list not Rampage) gives me the benefit of seeing the chances of the raid succeeding or if we need to camp a cleric, and get the heck out of the zone. The sk can FD after everyone is running, or word gets out to RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!! Giving the Cleric a chance to camp and a helping hand for rezzing the dead. Sk FD Is perfect for this use. The Cleric comes back, the SK is there to ward off the trash mobs that might be around... And a successfull recovery is made. We go over what happened, evaluate what needs to change to make it work, and go do it again, or decide, we don't have enough Healing power and go to something else.  <br /> <br />There are many uses, that require a TANK Type class to do it. If you want the grit, and have the time, or resources to equip them right, the Warrior is by far a longer lasting tank, with all their abilities up to par, then the other two, but the other two are just as effective, and even more effective in the right circumstances.. I have said I prefer a Pally as a tank in DON, OOW, etc, instant zones. The reason is the snap aggro, being able to get the mobs attention even while a WIzzy nukes it or a debuffer slows it. Shadowknights I prefer in sticky situations, where the mobs probably gonna be hitting you all the way back to the party, that snare comes in very handy to ensure that these FAST as heck mobs aren't all over the puller and Snare (Engulfing Darkness Line) Also ensure's the SK gets aggro when back to camp.</p>

<p>This is a subject that i have heared many people debate about. It is in my humble opinion, that warriors are the best tanks. Even if pallys have an advantage in aggro (which i dont agree with), warriors are a much better tanking class. Im not saying knights cant tank, pallys and sk can tank no problem, and if they know what they're doing can do a great job. <br /> <br /> <br /> But warriors have much better defensive skills. i am saying this having played both a 65 warrior and 65 SK, and greatly prefer warrior as tank. while i have no hands on experience as a pally, but when playing alts, the group always seems to do better with a warrior then with a SK or a pally.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Sure a pally can stun, but with bellow,incite inc, warriors can hold aggro just as good as any other tank class.and im not trying to flame anyone or say that anyone is wrong, but i saw this post and had to throw my two cents in. <br /> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Thu May 19 22:52:35 2005 by WhackinYouHard</span></i></p>

<p>The discs, which have been around a while now, are sure useful. I don't dissagree with you at all. As a matter of fact, there are many successful groups out there that use all kinds of different methods and end up with the same results... SUCCESS!! <br /> <br />Far as the Disc's are concerned, The main thing I have noticed though, is it's not always successful.. Meaning you don't alway's get the aggro from hitting that berate/incite or whatever your using on the aggro line, right away. Most the time, yes, but not all the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br />The main thing when reading my posts about normal groups, to me it might be different to you. I am well aware that there are groups of all level 70's for example, and all compatible gear etc.. with maybe one or two in group that aren't. I picked level 70 as an example, it might be level 60 to 65, or 50 to 60, etc. For my normal groups however, it ussually consists of guildies and friends, that take advantage of the extreme level difference your allowed in a normal (not instance) Grind group. When I have a pally grouped with me, He might be level 55, to my 67 for example, the cleric may be level 68, the puller level 60, Beastie or other dps around 50's. If I'm the highest in the group, then level 45 and up is welcome to join me, if level 70 is highest, well then the lowest that can be in group would be level 47 (Unless someone even lower level wants to come just to see/experience and get a feel for the zone before they normally would be able to). In other words a normal grind group for me might be killing lt blues and greens to help other's level up while I just work on AA's,  Or they might all be RED cuz my level 70 friends want me to level up for some evil intentions.... (Just kidding if any of my friends happen to read this :-). <br /> <br />So when I use a pally to stun the mob out of a mezz even though I'm MT, I am just ensuring I get aggro before it starts going after the chanter. Some how I'm either not pushing my button's right, or I'm just not hated by the mob enough, whatever the reason, I have had problems when knocking a mob out of a mezz, hitting Taunt, and my discs and the mob ends up on the Chanter anyways... Whenever someone has been able to stun the mob first (And I start pummeling it before it is unstunned) I've had alot better success. I am sure better equipped, geared, and AA's earned on more worthy WArrior's don't have these problems, I'm speaking for myself, and for other's that may have levelled on up as I did, without getting the gear, AA's and Hate aug's that Most Warrior's are expected to have by the time they are my level (67). Actually before my level, make no mistake though, I am correcting this before moving on up any more.</p>

<p>Another thing to note here. The gear, AA's, and augments etc, didn't mean a thing till I was in my mid 50's. The groups I attended that I was actually MT, I never had problems with aggro. Seemed all you had to do back then was just say, hey, such and such is tank, and the mob new who we wanted it to stay on, LOL. It was around the mid 50's when I first experienced any type of aggro problem, and this is the time I discovered discs for the first time as well. Getting them sure helped me out alot. It's not a complete answer to all aggro issue's though.</p>
