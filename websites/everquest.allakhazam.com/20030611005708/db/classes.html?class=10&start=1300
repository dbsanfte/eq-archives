	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hello all,<br><br>Now before i start another huge war, I am here to say I have both characters. I like both characters, just because of the different ways i have to play.<br><br> On the SK side i usually pull with a tap or debuff str or darkness, and begin melee then back away after taking some damage to lifetap and cast fear and my pet and I go to bashin it like crazy, after about 2 or 3 mobs i usually run out of mana and half to med to be at full performance. As for harm touch, it is a Life vs. death use only so i hardly use it unless i get adds or trained, so in a way it is useless most of the time, and it is magic based so when you get higher lvls i have had it get resisted alot. Now i love the way i look in plate armor being a human. and i am a fan of 1hs myself but practice 2hs for the SK only weapons and epic, as if i will ever get it. The few probs i have with my SK is finding mobs in large areas and having to run everywhere slowly (i hate asking for sows and such all the time). The fact that we cant heal does make for alot of downtime after battles with whites and yellows. ( when most of your spells start getting resisted). and i love duel wield which we dont get and why I use 1hs for the bash, the stun effect makes feared mobs alot easier to hit. As for the good use of haveing that pet. it does cause aot of probs when ou are trying to heal and med and a green attacks your pet to interupt it all and in most cases kills your pet as well. the usefullness of the pet is to send him in while you run in death cases before feign death or you forgot to mem it or save mana for it. In most cases I like my SK, he is supposed to be the most offensive class in the game, everything is about damage, and debuffs.<br><br>Now on to my ranger, his abilities are what make him cool to play: track, forage, sneak, hide, able to cast all the different types of spells DoT, DD, root, Snare, buffs, heal, Sow, Dam Shield, the guy gots it all, and with all hybrids they are not as good as pure casters but neither is any other hybrid. <br>He gets all the different melee off. and def. type skills: kick, duel wield, double attack, riposte, and his bow is a site to see first hand indeed. I have been at low health meding and&nbsp;&nbsp;get attacked with my ranger and instead of running(as i would with my Sk) I snared the mob and ran back and started blasting it with arrows, I crit 3 times for about 45 each, kept up the back track and fire while trying to get as much hp and mana as possible, did a couple of heals and a damage shield and went in for the kill. ahh even if it did not work i still had sow to head for the zone. i hardly ever to go town to anymore except to train skills or buy more archery supplys to raise skills. Now about the armor thing as i mentioned above aobut plate looking cool on my SK, its just the rangers style not to wear loud and clumbersome plate sneaking up on your unsuspected prey, that makes the game a better roleplay for me, YES, it is not as good as plate with the lower ac and such but your the scout, the one who everyone follows while tracking prey and checking out mobs to pull, before you send in the army of eager warriors in to attack, Because in alot of groups i have been in, if a bad pull kills alot of group memebers the blame will fall to your side on pulling to many.<br><br>Now I dont know much of the math with the weapons, armor, caps for skils, but I put out alot more damage when playing with my warrior friend who is a 2h axe lover(this might be why). and i have seen some rogues as well and they are useless if no backstab, usually someone, me, has to keep the mob off them. now monks make great pullers with feign death and can put out some damage, but i have seen some serious health drops when they put in to much damage also,(no metal type armor at all) now on the high end when skills start caping for everyone(I have not gotten there yet and alot of people wont get there very fast anyway) it might all change, they get more hps and ac but no way to heal, or in SK case has to fight to get hp back and still is a lost cause because your getting beat up while you do it. and then no mana. <br><br>All classes have weaknesses and advantages, that is not really the point, because in some way they are all balanced with certain skills and abilities that make then useful. YOU need to find one that fits your style of play or yourself in my case, and being an evil on top of evil(as i call it) class such as an SK does not fit to my personality. I like to hunt in the swamps after trolls with my ranger much better, more purpose, excitement, hunting your prey instead of waiting for it to spawn again. hehe, just for all you other classes when you are camping orcs, goblins or whatever and have to wait in line because you cant find anything else.<br><br>Now to end this i like rangers much better than SK because of reasons i have mentioned above, but i tried to give an idea about both characters.<br><br>In short, if you want to be a ranger, get ready for a thinking game, a true type of roleplay(for me). use your skills to the max, with your lower hp and ac, start with a snare and the bow with DDs, then go in for the kill, if it is not working root and back up for more range attacks, while you heal and then go at that mob again, unless you run into some really bad luck, you will defeat that mob(I am not saying go after those ultra red ones either its suicide).<br><br>Good Hunting fellow ranger, maybe we will see each other in the swamps, but i cover my tracks very well. hehehe<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>First off, all this nonsense about Rangers sucking is making my blood boil. I can't say from personal experience that any other class is better or even worse for that matter, but it is all just personal preference on what class you would like to play. I guess when some people finally realize this, which is only wishful thinking, we will all be better off.<br><br>Secondly, and I am speaking from experience on this, Rangers rule up to at least 34 in the soloing department. Why? Well fellow Rangers, all you have to do is goto Everfrost at level 21 and begin hunting mammoths for the next 13 levels of your EQ life. Boring you may say, but no group necessary and the BEST LOOT available for anyone at that level IMO.&nbsp;&nbsp;I made at least 3k in my time there off the tusks alone. Rangers will have the heads up on anyone else hunting them, and are basically untouchable when snare and fear animal work right off. 1 bub of mana and 1 bub of health if all goes well in a battle. At 30 it gets even better with the added spells and you can shread through the mammoths like a hot knife through butter, so even though experience isn't as good as once was, you kill at much faster rate making up for xp lost.  Also, I need to mention that EF is the best place to get HQ Bear Skins. All the newbies there sell for cheap and you can make a hefty profit from the 10 slot backpacks you make, provided you work up tailoring skill. Another 3k from those, give or take. Well worth it IMO.<br><br>Lastly, and I can't believe more Rangers don't harp on this also. The reason they can solo so effectively is because of TRACK!!! I can't imagine how it is even possible without it! I had a Rogue at 15, and there was NO WAY I could solo with him like my Ranger. And it wasn't because he was weaker then my Ranger, it was because it took me 10 times (maybe exaggerating, but not much) longer to find a MOB to fight. Not to mention that a Ranger Track sorts by distance and gives you the mob's level, allowing you to find MOB's close and within your level to fight. TRACK is terribly underrated, at least in this forum it seems, because I can tell you without it I would be completely lost. All in all, TRACK has spoiled me, I don't even like playing my Rogue now because he can't TRACK! Like my Druid friend once said...who has a 54 SK btw..."A whole new world opens up to you when you have TRACK." HEH, and he doesn't even have the Ranger's TRACK.<br><br>Remember, this was all written by a 35 Ranger who has solo'd his whole life and will continue until ABSOLUTELY NOT POSSIBLE. My Rogue has been into a few too many, HMMMM...how should I say, AWFUL Orc Groups to even want to try with my Ranger, anyway why would I with track at my disposal. :) So with that said, I have no clue on what it is like to be at 50+ or even 40, but I have heard you can solo Rangers into mid and upper 40's. By that time I have a feeling I won't be playing much more, as it as taken me a year to get to 35. I am not one of the hardcore players that play 4 or 5 hours a day. Maybe in a week I do that. Anyways, to all that say a Ranger sucks and is not worth playing, think that some do not play to get to 60 and have all the greatest weapons, but to have fun and roleplay a little. To not play a class because it will be weak and bottom of the barrel when it reaches 50, that seems awfully foolish to me. And that is if what the Ranger bashers say is true, which i don't even believe. To 35, I'd be willing to bet there is not much of a faster and profitable route then what I listed above, and you can do it all on your own time. Up to 35, I can honestly say that I feel Rangers are even par with all other classes, if not a cut above. :) I'm sure as I progress I will keep believing that, and I hope this helps all people thinking of starting a Ranger, to stick with that thought and go for it. <br><br>Just SHOWING A LITTLE LUV FOR ALL THE RANGERS.<br><br>Oh yeah, Kildiar must think this is the RANGER'S BLOW ASS Forum and not the Rangers Strategy Guide Forum. As much as he uses the word ass in his totally offbase posts, you have to worry for the man, or boy..... Do you prefer chocolate syrup or jello when you toss salad Kildiar???<br><br> <br><br> <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>*Sigh* This battle will never end. Those of you who believe with all your heart that "rangerz sux" are entitled to your opinion... as poorly grounded as it is. Rangers are a pure strategy class, and require a good player to master them. If you are impatient, inexperienced, and lack a certain amount of foolhardiness, you will most likely think rangers are not a good class. A good player will take what thier class has and make it work for him or her. A bad one will most likely post a poorly based opinion here, and go on to be another card carrying member of the I Hate Rangers Brigade. This really holds true for any class. Oh well. Your loss. Hey, everyone is entitled to play the game the way they enjoy it, right? However, you shouldn't bash people, exclude them from groups or from raids just because they play a class you don't understand and have been unable to master. <br><br>It's true that rangers have some severe disadvantages. The way I see it, that makes it all the more challenging. My first and still primary is a ranger. A half elf of all things. I've played every other class since, to at least level 20. I very much enjoy my necro. I love my bard. I adore my little gnome chanter. My monk has soloed much better than I ever expected her to. In the end, my true love is still my ranger. At each level, she was able to do far more and had much more hunting options than any class I have ever played. Where rangers have disadvantages, they make up for it tenfold in thier abilities... if you're willing to take the time to learn what a ranger is truly capable of. <br>Rangers are masters of agro control. If you take the time to practice, you will be in control of who is getting hit in your party at all times. In outdoor groups, they are excellent in strategic pulling... harmony is a very good asset to a group, and if a ranger is in charge of keeping the mobs sitting happily on thier butts or bumbling about snared, the druid has more time and mana to focus on damage and healing. Enchanters are the undisputed masters of shutdown, pre or post agro, but it's a lot easier to keep the mobs from agroing in the first place than to quiet them down once they've started attacking, and takes some of the burden off the main mezzer so they can take care of multiple targets and wandering adds. Also, rangers stand among druids, necros, and mages in thier ability to solo. Well into the mid fourties, and possibly longer. Quad kiting may be out of the question, but in the mid levels, whites, yellows and even some reds aren't a problem. The opening of Stonebrunt Mountains has given rangers a virtual paradise to play in, if you can swallow the thought of killing endangered species (Fortunatly they don't share that opinion about you). Hunting and medding in the middle of nowhere isn't a problem for a ranger.<br><br>Finally, and most importantly, for all of you who would tell me how much rangers "suck" and are a "worthless class", just remember that next time you spend hours wandering a zone looking for a rare spawn. If I had a copper for every time I get tells "can u track this 4 me plz", (even from druids and bards) I'd be a rich ranger indeed. With all due respect, druids come nowhere close to even a young ranger in the ability to locate mobs.<br><br>Good luck and good hunting to you all, no matter what class you play.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Not sure with other Rangers, but I find myself using DoTs, nuking between slashes, snaring, fearing the animals, buffing myself (I only use SoW, Firefist and Strength of Earth, beacause I dont count on being hit.), SoWing, healing during downtime, and if theres not someone that can buff stats, I do that.<br>Wow, if someone like that got as much HP as a paladin do you think they would be overpowered?

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I am a level 35 Ranger without alternates.&nbsp;&nbsp;From firsthand experience, I can readily testify that up to the 40s (when our defense stops increasing) Rangers hang with all classes and are probably overpowered.  First, we tank nearly as well as a warrior (somewhat worse because we are a chainmail class and have less HP, somewhat better because we hold agro with spells).  Second, we have excellent damage.  Third, we have the ability to track, which is an early warning system, a spawn seeker, and exploration tool all rolled into one.  Finally, we bring a lot of utility to the table with our spells.  We have SoWing, snaring, healing, fearing, invis, and powerful pull spells like Harmony.  Binding, rezzing and ports are the only major spell abilities we do not have.  We even have some crowd control abilities with root.<br><br>Now as I said I do not have any direct experience with the 40+ game.  However, I have read quite a bit about it and can relate my understandings on the subject.<br><br>1.  Rangers remain damage dealers.  By design , we have sacrificed the defense and armor of warriors for spells and abilities like Track, Forage and Hide.  However our weapon caps are the same as a warrior's.  Since we can also cast spells and have the immense damage-dealing capacity of the Trueshot discipline, we are basically a lock for outdamaging warriors.  This is in spite of the warrior's ability to crit and land crippling blows.<br><br>The generally accepted table of damage dealing at these levels is:<br><br>Rogues (backstabbing):  200%<br>Monks/Rangers:  105%<br>Warriors:  100%<br>SKs/Pallies/non-BSing Rogues:  below 100%<br><br>Since SKs seem to be a popular topic here, SKs have instead sacrificed damage output for their spells and utility (FD, for example), and maintain high warrior-like defense.  It seems to me that, at least in this aspect, SKs and Pallies have it worse off in the end game than Rangers.  Quite simply, damage stacks but you only need one or two tanks so Pallies and SKs are more likely to be useless.  Moreover, for certain uber mobs you need a tank that has the Warrior defensive disciplines, which Pallies and SKs do not get.  I am not trying to claim that SKs suck or Rangers are better than SKs, however this is one aspect to consider when comparing the classes in the end game.<br><br>By the way, someone just posted SKs outdamages all the hybrids.  This is ludicrous.  It has been repeatedly shown that dual wielding handily outdamages two-handed attacks across the board.  Also, SKs have inferior caps in weapon skills and offense.  Just setting the record straight, there.<br><br>2.  Rangers become poor tanks, but they are given agro-reducers to compensate:  specifically, Jolt at 51 and Cinder Jolt at 55.  These spells are fast casts, cost a modest amount of mana, and used intelligently allow Rangers to maintain their high damage output without exposing themselves to a mob's wrath.  In this sense the Ranger is similiar to the Rogue with his Instill Doubt, and the Monk with his FD.<br><br>3.  Rangers are useful in the end game.  The big problem with Rangers for a time, that probably gave them such a bad rap, is that Jolt was broken.  It took too long to cast, and we got it at 55 instead of 51.  High damage + no evasion = lots of dead Rangers.<br><br>Now a smart Ranger who knows he is not a tank is a valuable addition to any end game group, from an XP group to an uber mob raid.  He will bring a lot of damage to the table, at least as much as a warrior...and unlike pure casters such as the wizzie, Ranger damage is melee-based and thus un-resistable.<br><br>Unique Ranger spells are easily overlooked but they bring plenty of value to a high-end Ranger.  Want a 26 AC, +4 DS buff that stacks with nearly anything?  Go find your local friendly Pathfinder and ask him for Call of the Earth.  How about a 40 ATK group buff?  A Warder can hook you up with a Call Of the Predator.  I believe Strength of Nature (+25 ATK, +75 HP) is another Ranger-only buff.<br><br>The final reason why a Ranger should be always desirable in the end-game is the weaponshield discipline.  This grants 15 seconds of immunity to melee attacks to a Warder.  This means that a guild will want all the Warders it can get, because each represents another 15 seconds of being able to tank anything essentially damage-free.<br><br>So, there is the positive side of the Ranger class in a nutshell.  Ironically, I don't even mean this to convince others to play a Ranger.  Hell, I love my Ranger, and if there are only a handful on a server I'll be quite happy with that.  Ultimately, play who you like and learn to play it well.

However they  don not do damage compareable to any other hybrid for that matter.<br><br>Shadow Knights: can hands down out damgage any other hybrid at later levels when they can fear-kite as well as any necro. however u guys need a group so that u don't die.<br><br>Bards: they do evering, and suck AT EVERTHING, sure they aer great groupers do to there haste and buff songs but there heal songs suck worse than a rangers heal spell. <br><br>Rangers: they can do decent damage until they are capped. other than bards have the best hybrid buffs and can solo very well (archery/dd/dot kite down to 1/2 health root and archery and they can melee alowwing them little downtioime cuz of healing spells and they don't take any dmg till later in the fight.<br><br>Rogue: level faster than hybrids but need a group to perform best (re: otherwise they get one backstab per fight) low hp and ac.<br><br>Monk: can probably do the most dmg at one tinme cuz of the dual weild at lvl 1 and they have awesome kicks. No chance to solo though cuz they cannot heal or do any form of kiteing.<br><br>Warrior: Undesputedly  the  best tankers  they get the best ac hp and chance to do melee dmg. However  i was unable to solo one past lvl 8 wich really sucks.<br><br>Wisdom Casters: for the most part  they can all kite cept for the cleric who roots+nukes they can all solo pretty well and can wear good armor (druids are the best here)<br><br>Inteligence casters: Mages and Wizzys can downright opwn an opponent by nukein him and mages get pets :).

Remember though, that you will only be able to hit for max 29 damage (until lvl 20, when your damage cap comes off.)<br><br>Bloodstained fangs (30-50pp) aren't great weapons at all, but they are cheap :) and for your level they'll do nicely.<br><br>My lvl 25 Ranger uses Ice Tooth Claws in his main hand and a Bloodstained Fang (9/32, piercing) in his off hand.  He also alternates these weapons with a Drakkel-forged Bastard Sword to keep that skill up.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>After following this thread for quite some time, I feel the need to voice my opinions on the subject of rangers.&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel they are very underpowered and unbalanced.  I will elaborate on what makes them underpowered later in this post.  I also believe I should state that I have a level 52 ranger, so the things I say are not said out of malice or jealousy.  They are from experience.  I first started playing my ranger when the game first came out.  At that time, rangers were one of the best classes in the game.  They had the same defense as warriors, and they could wear the best armor in the game (rubicite), and use the best weapons in the game (short sword of ykesha).  In addition, they could can several versatile spells that were inaccessible to other melees.  Those were the good old days, when rangers were actually a valid class.  However, after the release of Kunark, rangers have slowly and steadily gotten the shaft, time and time again.  Let me explain my reasoning.<br><br>Issue 1) Tanking Ability<br><br>A ranger&#8217;s tanking ability is laughable.  They can&#8217;t even tank as well as a rogue, let alone a warrior.  Here are a few numbers to prove my point.<br><br>Defense<br>Warrior: 252<br>Rogue: 252<br>Ranger: 200<br>Ranger-Rogue Deficit: 52 points<br><br>Dodge<br>Warrior: 175<br>Rogue: 210<br>Ranger: 170<br>Ranger-Rogue Deficit: 40 points<br><br>Parry<br>Warrior: 230<br>Rogue: 230<br>Ranger: 220<br>Ranger-Rogue Deficit: 10 points<br><br>Riposte<br>Warrior: 225<br>Rogue: 225<br>Ranger: 150<br>Ranger-Rogue Deficit: 75 points<br><br>Raw AC granted from full suit of Kunark armor<br>(Cobalt, Mrylokar&#8217;s, and Tolan&#8217;s respectively)<br>Warrior: 220<br>Rogue: 155<br>Ranger: 155<br>Ranger-Rogue Deficit: Even<br><br>The warrior numbers are posted just as a reference, I wouldn&#8217;t expect a ranger to tank as well as a warrior, but I&#8217;m sure that these numbers clearly show how utterly horrible a ranger&#8217;s tanking ability is.  A rogue is clearly a superior tank, having a higher defense, and higher dodge/parry/riposte skill caps.  Another point that I should mention is that I am comparing them to a rogue, who isn&#8217;t even suppose to be tanking in the first place.<br>Finally, I was conducting some tests, comparing a ranger to a warrior in tanking ability.  I would attack a single monster, and drag it to a zone line.  I then just let it attack me until I was near death, and then I would zone.  I did this a number of times, and timed how long it took the creature to work me down, then averaged out the times.  I repeated this test with a warrior friend of mine, just to see the difference.  The warrior lasted 3 times longer than I did.  Meaning that the monster would have killed me 3 times over before it would have killed the warrior.  While I understand that a ranger is not supposed to be as good of a tank as a warrior, this seems ridiculous.  A ranger is little more than a speed bump as far as tanking ability is concerned.<br><br>Issue 2) Damage Output<br><br>Well, I was willing to let forget the idea of being a tank, besides, rangers have excellent damage out put right?  Not quite.  A ranger&#8217;s damage output is yet another thing which has fallen by the wayside.  While the patch some time ago raised their offensive skill caps to that of the other melees, it was of little help due to the fact that the other classes simply get better weapons/skills.  A monk or a rogue can easily surpass the damage output of a ranger.  It isn&#8217;t even a contest.  A rogue with double backstab can do unbelievable amounts of damage, as well as having a better weapon selection than a ranger.  The monk with his epic or a runed fighter&#8217;s staff easily out damages a ranger.  And actually, a monk without his epic, using just his bare fists will out damage a ranger unless the rangers has weapons of epic quality or better.  This seems sadly inadequate.  Here are a few numbers to illustrate my point.<br><br>Rogue:<br>Locustlure: 8/17 (35% atk spd decrease proc)<br>Sebilite Croaking Dirk: 10/18<br>Bloodpoint: 10/21 (80 dmg lifetap proc)<br>Ragebringer(epic): 15/25 (40% haste, 40 atk, 9 ac proc)<br><br>Monk:<br>Runed Fighter&#8217;s Staff: 19/20<br>Imbued Fighter&#8217;s Staff: 38/40<br>Fists(no epic, lvl 50): 14/28 (I think, not sure exactly)<br>Fists(epic): 9/16 (clickable 40% haste)<br><br>Ranger:<br>Lupine Dagger: 9/18 (Greater Wolf Form proc)<br>Fayguard Parrying Dagger: 9/17 (29 AE dmg proc)<br>Earthcaller: 14/24 (500dmg 20/tick dot proc)<br>Swiftwind: 13/21 (40% haste, 30 atk proc)<br><br>Issue 3) Utility<br><br>	Even after I realized that I was completely inferior in both tanking and damage dealing ability, I still had hope for my ranger.  I could still do things out of combat that those other melees couldn&#8217;t.  When they took that away from me, it was the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back so to speak.  I stripped down my ranger and sold everything off to start up a warrior.  I just couldn&#8217;t believe what has happened to rangers with the release of Kunark/Velious.  All of the ranger&#8217;s utilitarian spells, which made him a cut above the rest of the other melees are now castable by anybody with the appropriate gear!  Clickable effects on items emulate almost all of a ranger&#8217;s spells.  Here are the most glaring examples.<br><br>Spirit of Wolf:  Journeyman&#8217;s Boots/Traveler&#8217;s Boots<br>Healing/Invigor: Cobalt Breastplate<br>See Invisibility:  Bracer of the Hidden<br>Strength of Earth: Cobalt Boots<br>Invisibility: Cobalt Greaves<br>Infravision: Glowing Stone Band/Cobalt Helm<br>Chloroplast: Fungi Tunic<br>Root: Crystaline Silk Net<br><br><br>The list goes on, but I will not bore you with the details.  I might also add that all of those effects are mana free, where as the ranger has to spend mana to cast his spells.<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>Well, I just don&#8217;t know what else to say.  Rangers can&#8217;t tank as well as others, can&#8217;t deal damage as well as others, and don&#8217;t really have any unique utility to them due to new gear.  Verant has always stated that a class doesn&#8217;t have to be the best at something to be balanced, there just has to be a compelling reason to play the class.  The only problem is, there absolutely NO reason to play a ranger when they are completely and totally outclassed by the other melees.<br>	<br>	If this article keeps even one person from making a ranger, then the time I spent writing it will not be in vein.   It will keep someone from spending weeks upon weeks of played time building up a character just to have his or her hopes shattered.  Moaning mournfully as the cold, hard reality sets in upon them, that they have just wasted months of time building up a ranger.  That all of the time they spent would have been better off playing something other than what I consider to be the absolute weakest class in the game.<br><br>Pire Ashwood 52 Ranger<br>Tarew Marr<br>Born: March 16, 1999<br>Died: September 10, 2001<br>May he rest in peace...<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Good point of the numbers side of the defensive skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do agree that there should be no way a rogue has that much of a differential in defensive skills.  The only thing I could see is the Rogue having a higher Dodge, and the Ranger having a higher Riposte and Parry.  Defense should cap at the same point.<br><br>As to weapons, just go pick up Primal/Priceless if you want to compare endgame weapons.  It all evens out there.  I won't compare the Epics.  Whoever designed them didn't have a clue (Ragebringer is &gt;ungodly&lt; powerful compared to how hard it is to get).<br><br>For damage output, it would be more fair to compare a monk vs a ranger.  Both are designed as "anywhere damage". Ranger, using spells, will outdamage any other melee, except for the backstabbing Rogue of course, when everyone has comparable weapons.  Look at the parsing/logs of the higher level guilds out there.  A double backstabbing Rogue will clean any melee's clock damage output wise.  But no backstabs= a similarily equipped Ranger can outdamage everyone else on a semi-consistant basis.  <br><br><br>"If this article keeps even one person from making a ranger, then the time I spent writing it will not be in vein. It will keep someone from spending weeks upon weeks of played time building up a character just to have his or her hopes shattered. Moaning mournfully as the cold, hard reality sets in upon them, that they have just wasted months of time building up a ranger. That all of the time they spent would have been better off playing something other than what I consider to be the absolute weakest class in the game. "<br><br>*sigh*  Why suddenly do these people develop the "desire" to keep others from "spending weeks and weeks" on a supposidly useless character?<br><br>While this was a well written post (unlike a lot that show up here), and it had some valid points, I fail to believe anyone in the gaming community really cares what other people play.  For EQ, as long as there are an adequate amount of clerics, chanters, and warriors (which are considered the core character classes for higher end encounters), why should you care?  I mean, if everyone plays a ranger which, according to you, sucks so horribly, then that means it will be easier to find a group, to get phat lewtz, and to play the game.  When there is a sudden influx of posts saying the exact same thing (although this one was written much better than the others), it just makes me think someone has a vendetta against a class.<br><br>As to "Ranger's" spells being castable by "anyone" with the proper gear?  Let's see.  Cobalt, Cobalt, Cobalt, Cobalt.  And the BP and Legs you will never see unless you belong to an "Uber" guild who monopolizes the spawns.  A lot of the stuff mentioned are laughable buff wise.  That Shaman is gonna snicker when he throws Strength on you fo +67, vs your Str of Earth for 15.  And sure, Root can be cast from some items.  But how many are you going to farm/carry?  20 uses worth?  100?  And let us not get into item casting times (anywhere from "normal" to 15 times the normal casting time).<br><br>Please, as I stated in other posts, make constructive suggestions for improvements.  Don't just say "Rangers suck, don't play them".  Pointing out weaknesses is fine, but also show ways to correct them.<br><br>Rangers need work at the HIGH END GAME.  So did Rogues.  And Warriors.  And Paladins and SKs.  All the the melee based classes (minus the monk) did/still do.  Some need to be toned down but will not (aka Warriors and Rogues).  But the ones that still need some work, specifically a Ranger, is &gt;far&lt; from a useless character.<br><br><br>Gorthin Spiritcaller<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>There are a few problems with some of your points.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will reply on a point by point basis.<br><br>"As to weapons, just go pick up Primal/Priceless if you want to compare endgame weapons. It all evens out there. I won't compare the Epics. "<br><br>While it is correct that in the end, everybody will be using primal/priceless weapons, the fact remains that a primal/priceless in the hands of anybody else will do more damage.  A rogue with a priceless spear will WAY outdamage a ranger, and a warrior with critical hits will outdamage a ranger as well.<br><br>"For damage output, it would be more fair to compare a monk vs a ranger. Both are designed as "anywhere damage". Ranger, using spells, will outdamage any other melee, except for the backstabbing Rogue of course, when everyone has comparable weapons. Look at the parsing/logs of the higher level guilds out there. A double backstabbing Rogue will clean any melee's clock damage output wise."<br><br>In the end game, this simply isn't true.  Especially the point about a ranger using spells outdamaging any other melee with the exception of rogues.  A ranger's damaging spells will be outright resisted on any high level mob.  Once you take their damage spells out of the equation, what do they become?<br><br>"As to "Ranger's" spells being castable by "anyone" with the proper gear? Let's see. Cobalt, Cobalt, Cobalt, Cobalt. And the BP and Legs you will never see unless you belong to an "Uber" guild who monopolizes the spawns. A lot of the stuff mentioned are laughable buff wise. That Shaman is gonna snicker when he throws Strength on you fo +67, vs your Str of Earth for 15. And sure, Root can be cast from some items. But how many are you going to farm/carry? 20 uses worth? 100? And let us not get into item casting times (anywhere from "normal" to 15 times the normal casting time)."<br><br>I was specificly things that a warrior can use against a ranger's spells, perhaps I should have made that more clear.  A warrior, in my opinion, has the least utility out of any class, they are purely focused on melee.  However, with proper gear, they have the exact same utility spells as a ranger.  That was the point I was trying to make.  And as to the casting times on the items, the cobalt breastplate takes about 13 seconds to cast a 100 point heal.  A ranger takes about 3 seconds to cast a 90 point heal, but then has to med for about 30 seconds to get the mana back.  So who actually is winning this deal?  Finally, you do not have to be in an uber guild in order to get cobalt.  My warrior has a few pieces, and I am not in an uber guild.  Admittedly the breastplate and leggings might be rather difficult to come by, but I can just make due with a fungi tunic and bandages.<br><br>"Rangers need work at the HIGH END GAME. So did Rogues. And Warriors. And Paladins and SKs. All the the melee based classes (minus the monk) did/still do. Some need to be toned down but will not (aka Warriors and Rogues). But the ones that still need some work, specifically a Ranger, is &gt;far&lt; from a useless character."<br><br>Well, at the high end game, I fail to see the use of a ranger.  They don't do damage, they can't tank, and their utility is negated due to gear.  Please, if you see anything useful about the ranger, post it.<br><br>"*sigh* Why suddenly do these people develop the "desire" to keep others from "spending weeks and weeks" on a supposidly useless character?"<br><br>Because I would not want anybody to endure the pain I had to go through of watching their character develop, just to realize that their character is inferior in every way to the other classes.<br><br>"While this was a well written post (unlike a lot that show up here), and it had some valid points, I fail to believe anyone in the gaming community really cares what other people play. For EQ, as long as there are an adequate amount of clerics, chanters, and warriors (which are considered the core character classes for higher end encounters), why should you care? I mean, if everyone plays a ranger which, according to you, sucks so horribly, then that means it will be easier to find a group, to get phat lewtz, and to play the game. When there is a sudden influx of posts saying the exact same thing (although this one was written much better than the others), it just makes me think someone has a vendetta against a class."<br><br>Well, I really do care about what other people play.  I believe that if enough people would stop playing rangers.  That perhaps it will motivate Verant to finally examine rangers, and do something to help this poor, underpowered class.<br>And hes, I do have a vendetta against rangers.  I spent about 48 days of played time building up a ranger to level 52.  And now I realize that I just wasted my time building up the weakest class in the game.  I honestly can't see any reason to play a ranger, other than wanting to challenge of playing an inferior class.<br><br>As for possible fixes to the class.  I really don't know what can pull rangers out of the hole Verant has dug them.  Here are a few things that might help.<br><br>1) Raise defense cap to 230.<br>2) Raise dodge/parry/riposte caps.<br>3) Add some sort of self only haste spell.  This would help to bring their damage output in line with the other melees on high level encounters.<br>4) Add a new "Call of X" spell that makes their weapons proc 50 unresistable damage.<br>5) Add regeneration at level 39.  They already get chloroplast at level 55, but for some reason, they never get regeneration?  Seems weird to me.<br>6) Add strength of stone at level 39.  Again, they already get storm strength at level 53, but somehow, they never get strength of stone?<br>7) Lower jolt to level 39.  This is the level that a ranger's defense caps out.  At this level they really need to be staying out of combat, and controling their aggro.<br><br>Other than that, I don't know.  They have already given away the ranger's utility, which my favorite part of the class.  But these changes would bring a ranger up in tanking ability to just below that of a rogue, and would put them ahead of most melees in damage output.  But even with all those changes, I still don't thing I could be willing to pick up and play a ranger again.  If anybody else has some suggestions, I would like to hear them :)<br><br>Pire Ashwood 52 Ranger <br>Tarew Marr <br>Born: March 16, 1999 <br>Died: September 10, 2001 <br>May he rest in peace... <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Excellent.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am &gt;so&lt; glad this did not turn into a flame war/733t skillz war.  Let me respond to what I see as wrong with your post =)<br><br>"While it is correct that in the end, everybody will be using primal/priceless weapons, the fact remains that a primal/priceless in the hands of anybody else will do more damage. A rogue with a priceless spear will WAY outdamage a ranger, and a warrior with critical hits will outdamage a ranger as well. "<br><br>Unless the Rogue has a higher cap on Dual wield, there is no way a &gt;&gt;non backstabbing rogue&lt;&lt; will out melee a Ranger.  They are equal, and once the Ranger does a little self buffing, he should come out ahead.  Backstab skews everything out of whack.  Even with crits, the Warrior will NOT outdamage the Ranger.  Why?  Defensive Disc.  That is the main reason a Warrior is the tank of choice (and sometimes the only choice) for high end encounters.  Losing 30%+ of your damage output will keep them from outdamaging a Ranger.<br><br>"In the end game, this simply isn't true. Especially the point about a ranger using spells outdamaging any other melee with the exception of rogues. A ranger's damaging spells will be outright resisted on any high level mob. Once you take their damage spells out of the equation, what do they become?"<br><br>But you can't take them out of the equation.  Between a Druid using Ro's, the Enchanter Tashing, and the Shaman/Magician Maloing, you can get spells to stick quite nicely.  For some reason, Calefaction is a beast to resist from what I have seen.  Yes, it has a long delay, but it is a "free" 450 damage.  If you manage to remove the spells, then sure, Rangers would be inadequate.  But in a balanced group, Ranger nukes work just fine with a little debuffing.  Everyone has resist problems (except for Lures from Wizzies), that is why Verant made debuffs.<br><br>"I was specificly things that a warrior can use against a ranger's spells, perhaps I should have made that more clear.

Other cobolt is pricey, but common.  Noone denies Verant screwed up giving warriors spells like that.  That was one balancing feature:  They were dependent on others for magical support.  As to the Invigor right click vs casting Healing, it all depends.  In those 13 seconds, a Ranger can cure 360 damage vs 100.  Yes it eats mana, but it just depends on if you need it or not. It also ties you up for those 13 seconds to get the effect.  That can be bad. Fungi Tunic should not be warrior wearable IMO =)  But yes, with Kunark armor, Rogues and Warriors received some right click abilities they should not have gotten.  Nothing we can do about it now, though.<br><br>"Because I would not want anybody to endure the pain I had to go through of watching their character develop, just to realize that their character is inferior in every way to the other classes"<br><br>We will just have to agree to disagree here.  I do not feel Rangers are inferior in everyway.  Sure, they have some weak points, but properly played in a balanced group, they are killing machines.  VErant still claims this is a group game, so you have to gear yourself that way to get maximum results.<br><br>"1) Raise defense cap to 230. <br>2) Raise dodge/parry/riposte caps. <br>3) Add some sort of self only haste spell. This would help to bring their damage output in line with the other melees on high level encounters. <br>4) Add a new "Call of X" spell that makes their weapons proc 50 unresistable damage. <br>5) Add regeneration at level 39.

At this level they really need to be staying out of combat, and controling their aggro. "<br><br>#1 and #2) I agree with raising the defense cap to at least 225 (no higher than 240), but leave Dodge alone.  Raise parry and riposte to the cap.  Rogues got way too much, and they left the ranger behind on this.<br><br>#3)Swiftwind gives a 40% haste. And most of the time you will either have a Chanter or Shaman to Haste you.  Not to mention a Bard to stack in song haste.  I don't see this one helping any.<br><br>#4)  Call of Sky adds a 35+ a stun proc.  Call of Fire adds a 75 proc.  These are in the game.  Call of Sky is borderline unresistable.  So they kind of already have this.  And Sky procs a buttload for me.<br><br>#5) Druids get Regen at 34, so for a Ranger instead of 39, 49 would be more in line I do think.  Would be a nice bonus, but something to save the class.<br><br>#6) Almost exactly the same as #5, down to the levels =)<br><br>#7)I honestly do not think jolt needs to be lowered in level.  Everyone caps defense at 40 except for pure INT casters.  The problem is 50+, not 1-50.  Aggro control is the key.  And in this case means proper weapon selection, avoiding the taunt button, and know which spells to cast when.<br><br>Honestly, to make Rangers more in line where they should be vs Warriors and Rogues would mean a cap reduction for a lot of Rogue skills, which is not going to happen.  The best we can hope for is a cap raise to equal levels of a rogue on the defensive skills, but Verant will say it is too much, as Paladins and Sks are supposed to be the defensive Hybrids.  A moderate defense increase, along with increasing Riposte and Parry (leave Dodge alone just to appease Verant) would help a decent amount.<br><br>Personally though, I think Rangers are locked into this for the long haul.  It just takes a lot of patience, skill, and adaptability to play a Ranger and squeeze the most out of them.  Just hitting Autoattack, casting snare, and looting won't cut it for this potentially wonderful class.  Hopefully something can be found to help, and it is not a bunch of crappy underpowered spells being released in Luclin =/<br><br>Gorthin Spiritcaller<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Finally, calefaction is not a "free" 450 damage.  It costs 250 mana.  That is about 90 secs of medding just to cast 1 spell.  Considering a rogue can backstab for about that much, or a monk can do about that much in 2 or 3 rounds of combat, all mana free, I don't consider it to be all that impressive.<br><br>"Like I said, Cobolt Legs and BP are the ones you need the "Uber" guild for.

It's true that this game is group oriented game, and that is the main reason I feel the ranger is underpowered.  In my experiences, no group wanted a ranger.  No guild wanted a ranger.  I was forced to solo through my entire career.  Occasionally I could get into a group here and there, but it was mainly because they felt pity for me, not because they needed me.

As to a monk outdamaging a Ranger who is casting, that can only happen if they have a great Tank.  Monks have NO aggro management short of melee distance, weapon selection, and turning off autoattack.  A monk who goes all out will die, and quickly (so would the Ranger in that situation).  As to "natural haste", that only applies to their fists, which never improve beyond 14/26 (Human, level 60).  Anyone should have equivilent/better weapons by that point.<br><br>High end encounters require a Warrior (or multiples) with the defensive Disc.  Noone else can stand in there long enough without it to allow the Clerics to CH them multiple times over the course of a fight that can last 5+ minutes.  Only warriors can do that, which is what makes them &gt;the&lt; tanks.  In a normal xp grind group, most prefer a SK or Paladin as the primary tank, simply because Paladins and SKs can generally hold aggro better than a Warrior, and SKs get FD.  The warrior having a higher AC in most cases doesn't matter on High End Velious and Kunark encounters.  Those MOBS always hit for close to max damage regardless.  Defensive Disc is what keeps the warrior alive.<br><br>"The main problem is I have found with rangers, is that their high level nukes are all fire based (firestrike and calefaction). Next to magic based, fire based is the most commonly resisted form of magic.

Considering a rogue can backstab for about that much, or a monk can do about that much in 2 or 3 rounds of combat, all mana free, I don't consider it to be all that impressive. "<br><br>Druids have this problem as well, but they are solid nukers.  You have to know when you can nuke, and when it is best not to.  As to needing to cast these debuffs to nuke "just to pull their own weight", that is crazy.  Rangers have pure offensive melee equal (caps and weapons wise) to any other class.  If you can't nuke it, then melee it (which is where 85% of your damage should come from anyway IMO.  Overnukking combined with lots of melee damage= too much aggro).  And by "free" damage I meant you do not have to do anything special for it.  Yes, it takes mana.  But what else are you going to do with it?  Mana is there for a reason, to be USED.  If you just sit there and admire that full blue mana bar, it is a waste.  Use the mana (wisely).  And for a Monk to do that kind of damage in 2 or 3 rounds, they are going to need a high end 2h blunt weapon, dual attack each time, and hit each time.  Taking into consideration that the average melee hit ratio is about 65%, it will definately take more than 2 or three rounds to pull that off, in a consistant manner.  Hell, at level 43 with a Arbitor's, if I double attack each round for three rounds and hit on each, my low str Ranger can do 672 damage (112 max per hit or so).  But #1) I will usually not double attack three times in a row #2)I will not hit all 6 times #3)I will not hit for max damage.  That generalization would apply to all melee classes =)  It may happen once in a great while, but not consistantly.  Don't forget, that 450 damage is IN ADDITION to what the Ranger normally does melee wise.  It is not the sole source of damage.<br><br>"Well, it seems that we both agree that Verant messed up horribly when they gave away the ranger's utilitarian spells to everybody. As far as the Invigorate vs Healing goes, a ranger has never been a combat healer. They simply don't heal as fast as a mob can deal damage. Therefore, the Invigorate/Healing would be used almost exclusively during down times. Given that stipulation, I would much rather have a mana free 13 second cast heal spell"<br><br>No, Rangers are not combat healers.  We are downtime reducers, and in a blatant emergency, can combat heal if all else fails.  Granted, Rangers suck at it, but it can be done.  I would like to point out that 95% of the Warrior population won't see a Cobolt BP on the average server, so trying to say an item like that makes a Ranger obsolete is not valid IMO.  Everyone loves mana free healing, but most will see the self only regen items, and Rangers can still project their healing onto others.  *shrug*  If you have it, use it.  If not, well, then you need a Ranger (or other healing capable class) to help.  Before they made duck interrupt instant, once that Cleric started the 10 second Cheal, the Enchanter would hold his breath if there wasn't a secondary healer.  It was rare, but I have seen Rangers successfully emergency heal and pull the monster off the enchanter quicker than taunt ever could.  Like I said, it was rare, but I have seen it =)  <br><br>"The problem I see is that while rangers have numberous weak points, they don't have any strong points. It's true that this game is group oriented game, and that is the main reason I feel the ranger is underpowered. In my experiences, no group wanted a ranger. No guild wanted a ranger. I was forced to solo through my entire career. Occasionally I could get into a group here and there, but it was mainly because they felt pity for me, not because they needed me. But I can't really say I blame them, why would you want a ranger, when you can take a warrior, rogue or monk. "<br><br>A Ranger is a Hybrid, and will not have any "strong" points.  The strongest facets of the class are :Track, offensive output, flexibility.  As to no group wanting a Ranger, I NEVER have a problem finding a group.  It may take 10 minutes, but most groups actually prefer picking up a Ranger as a secondary tank over most others because of the flexibility.  I do not know what server you are on, but Bristlebane is actually quite Ranger friendly.  The reason I would want a Ranger over a Monk or Rogue can range from group balance, needing a SoWer/snarer, needing a tracker, being able to use the spell versatility, to just plain out needing someone with a taunt button.  Others can think of more, but I just woke up and am still gathering my thoughts for the day =P<br><br>I haven't given up, but Verant feels they like the classes where they are for the most part.  Maybe the Rangers will get a few more tweaks, but only Verant knows that.<br><br>Gorthin Spiritcaller<br><br><br><br> <br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>alright in part this is why a ranger sucks major ass:<br>1. Your DD spells blow some major ass, at lvl 22 you get one that does 30DD, ehll if you dont melee for more than 30 dmage by the time your 22, stop playing the game.<br>2. Who cares if you rangers get a heal spell, it costs you rangers about a little more that half a mana bub and it heals you about 30hp at lvl 30.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now correct me if im wrong, but at lvl 30, you have near 900 or so HP, so what that would take you about 30 heals to get to full health which would take even more downtime then if you just let a cleric heal you once.<br>3. As for your snares, thats the only one things you rangers are good at.  Of course, an SK gets a snaring DoT, which is obviously better because it snares and does dmg.<br>4. as for your unique spells vs. an SK's.  There are 3 classes that can track so your isnt really unique anymore, and besides that, what the hel are you going to do track me to death?  As for a Shadow Knight, we get the Skill Harm Touch, which can easily win any battle for us.  I have just learned that it can do even more that 1900 dmg, somewhere in the 2500 range, including the discipline, also the discipline makes in unresistable, so casters and rogues and rangers, your @#%^ed. AS for your archery skills, maybe you do get critical hits, but anyone can train in archery, making critical hits the only thing that would save you, why would a warrior ever use a bow you may ask? When a Ranger thinks he did something smart and rooted him and starts shooting arrows at him.  The warrior can still keep you losing health and once that root wheres off, once again, rangers @#%^ed.<br>6.  Maybe your cheap ass heals are useful, but there not.  Maybe an SK's lifetap is even more useful. At lvl 30, we get a 45dmg lifetap, at 39, we get a 90dmg, at 49 a 150 or so dmg, and at 60 a 330dmg lifetap, dont forget that all of this dmg comes to our own HP decreasing our downtime while bringing some pain on the mob.<br>7.  Your epics suck, they are just like a warriors only with different procs, which according to you guys, the earth call proc gets resisted very often, therefore making the haste the only useful thing.  Now the SK epic, 40/45 with a 330DD Lifetap, that means a double hit of around 140 or so and if the proc kicks in, hell thats 330dmg that you get drained of and any dmg you may have done, gets restored by this.<br><br>So clearly, you rangers blow complete ass when compared to an SK, the only reason ppl still play your class is....i dont know why ppl play your class, maybe its because they enjoy being the underdog and never doing anything important for a change. <br>&nbsp;<br>Kildiar, The Shadow Knight Inoruuk Rejected<br><br>"A warrior's quote once said rangers suck....I agree"</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>First off I want it to be known it is obvious this person is a Troll.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to say a class "sucks", then offer constructive advice as to how they could be fixed.  Otherwise, find something else to do with your time than cluttering up this (or any for the matter) messege board with useless posts.<br><br>Secondly, this will be a long post.  Just a quick warning =)<br><br>Normally, I refrain from responding to this type of post/person, but I am getting tired of seeing this person flood the board in one of multiple login names about how bad "Rangers suck".  This person obviously has no clue about the high end game.  Oh, I am sure they will respond with "STFU n00b33, I hve a 52 dr00d, and I ownz joo with my 733t skillz!?!?!?!!?"<br><br>Do Rangers need work, &gt;&gt;&gt;AT THE HIGHER END GAME&lt;&lt;&lt; ?  Yes, although there have been some improvements.  From 1 to about 54, though, Rangers are quite balanced.  Every class needs some balancing post 54, as Verant never really expected the game to go beyong 50.  The foundation the game is built upon was not designed to handle where they have put the classes and MOBS, aka level 50+.<br><br>As to your points why "Rangers Suck", I guess I should refute them.<br><br>"1. Your DD spells blow some major ass, at lvl 22 you get one that does 30DD, ehll if you dont melee for more than 30 dmage by the time your 22, stop playing the game."<br><br>Wooo, level 22.  Yeah, what a class can do at level 22 is a major factor in whether they suck or not *rolls eyes*.  Anyway, at 22, the Ignite spell does 37 damage, 23% more than you claim.  It also takes a paltry 30 mana, and has a casting time of 2.1 seconds.  This fits nicely inbetween the swings of most weapons that non twinked/non uber twinked people would have at that level.<br><br>If you really want to compare, the SK tap at that level will do 11 hp max.  So by your logic, because at level 22 SKs can only do 11 damage max on their tap, "SKs suck".  I mean, really, if you can't do more than 11 damage by level &gt;22&lt;, come on, stop playing the game.<br><br>What you fail to mention is that at higher levels, Rangers get some downright mean DDs.  Call of flame, Calefaction, Firestrike.  Heck, even Careless lightning at 39 is quite nice for a melee first character. <br><br><br>"2.Who cares if you rangers get a heal spell, it costs you rangers about a little more that half a mana bub and it heals you about 30hp at lvl 30. Now correct me if im wrong, but at lvl 30, you have near 900 or so HP, so what that would take you about 30 heals to get to full health which would take even more downtime then if you just let a cleric heal you once"<br><br>Oh please.  30 mana at level 30 costing half a bubb?  What game have you been playing?  With around a 90 wis, that 30 mana heal costs an average level 30 Ranger 1/4 a bubb.  While at this level it is not great (29 hp healed), it can reduce downtime for the group by healing nicked members.  It can also allow that necro to keep his Hp-&gt;mana conversion spells up in between without having to try to find little stuff to tap.  As to a cleric being able to heal with one spell, how does this make Rangers suck?  Your tap at 30 will heal 45 damage.  So you would need 20 taps to heal the same 900 damage, but you also have to deal with the MOB you are tapping hitting you back.  Unless you are in a newbie zone and can tap something like a Moss Snake, in the process of "healing" the MOB is going to hit you for extra damage and make a SKs lifetaps an impractical way to heal any amount of damage.  Your tap may/should cost a little over half a bubb at 30, maybe that is where you are confused.  And yes, I have a 34 SK, so at least for this level, I know what I am talking about.  A Ranger at level 30 should be able to, or at least come close, heal himself totally in one mana bar.  Can an SK do that?  No.<br><br>"3. As for your snares, thats the only one things you rangers are good at. Of course, an SK gets a snaring DoT, which is obviously better because it snares and does dmg. "<br><br>How long have you been playing?  Let's see.  The darkness line absolutely PALES compared to snare.  Snare has a greater duration.  Snare gets resisted less.  And because snare does NOT do damage, it is more useful, in more situations.  Why?  Ever heard of enchanters Mezzing something?  Good luck trying that if your darkness them.  Snare also has a large (but nice) taunt component.  Snare is probably the #1 spell in the game for overall usefullness.  The darkness line can substitute for snare, but an SK who is having to cast Darkness three times per fight to get it to stick is not doing his job.  Your mana is better spent elsewhere.<br><br>"4. as for your unique spells vs. an SK's. There are 3 classes that can track so your isnt really unique anymore, and besides that, what the hel are you going to do track me to death? As for a Shadow Knight, we get the Skill Harm Touch, which can easily win any battle for us. I have just learned that it can do even more that 1900 dmg, somewhere in the 2500 range, including the discipline, also the discipline makes in unresistable, so casters and rogues and rangers, your @#%^ed. AS for your archery skills, maybe you do get critical hits, but anyone can train in archery, making critical hits the only thing that would save you, why would a warrior ever use a bow you may ask? When a Ranger thinks he did something smart and rooted him and starts shooting arrows at him. The warrior can still keep you losing health and once that root wheres off, once again, rangers @#%^ed."<br><br>Oh, now we are talking PvP.  PvP is so screwed up in EQ, it is not a valid grounds for any arguement, especially if a class "sucks" or not.  Anyway, any class that gets into a bow fight with a Ranger will lose.  Watch a high level Ranger use the Trueshot discipline sometime.   <br><br>"6. Maybe your cheap ass heals are useful, but there not. Maybe an SK's lifetap is even more useful. At lvl 30, we get a 45dmg lifetap, at 39, we get a 90dmg, at 49 a 150 or so dmg, and at 60 a 330dmg lifetap, dont forget that all of this dmg comes to our own HP decreasing our downtime while bringing some pain on the mob. "<br><br>You DO NOT get a new tap at 39.  However, Rangers get careless lightning (70 mana 99 damage 2.7 second casting time).  Your tap at 49 is a QUEST spell, does 280 damage max, takes 315 mana, and can only be cast once every two minutes.  At 51 is when you get your next "normal" lifetap for 75 damage.  Please, at least learn to read a spell list.  Know what our quest spell does at 49?  I assume you still can't read a spell list so I will tell you.  206 damage for 125 mana, with a recast of 18 seconds.  So in your two minutes, you can do 560 damage with your quest tap, and a Ranger can do 1236 damage with his quest spell.<br><br>"7. Your epics suck, they are just like a warriors only with different procs, which according to you guys, the earth call proc gets resisted very often, therefore making the haste the only useful thing. Now the SK epic, 40/45 with a 330DD Lifetap, that means a double hit of around 140 or so and if the proc kicks in, hell thats 330dmg that you get drained of and any dmg you may have done, gets restored by this."<br><br>Epics have NOTHING to do with how the class preforms.  With a few exceptions, Primal/priceless gear from the high end game totally blows away most Epics.  If you are basing the balance of a class on the Epic, well, I won't say it.  Epics are nice to have, but they are not all that.  And who cares about PvP. If it was balanced, then we could talk about it.  Just because a SK is generally better at it (high end especially) does not make it a better class. <br><br>"So clearly, you rangers blow complete ass when compared to an SK, the only reason ppl still play your class is....i dont know why ppl play your class, maybe its because they enjoy being the underdog and never doing anything important for a change."<br><br>People play the Ranger class because:<br><br>#1) The Rare Spawn finding kings. <br>#2) Deal buttloads of offensive damage.<br>#3) Are versatile (offense, defense, utility).<br>#4) They can be quite fun, if you learn how to play the class.  Playing a Ranger (and most classes) takes more than just hitting the autoattack and casting a spell here and there.  Sure you can do it, but a well played Ranger (or any other class) is a wonderful sight to behold.<br><br>Now, if you have constructive advice as to how to make this class more balanced, then please post it.  Otherwise, please quit clogging this board with useless posts.<br><br>Gorthin Spiritcaller<br>51 Shaman BB<br>Davall<br>43 Ranger BB<br>Chugrahk<br>34 SK BB<br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>ok, for your DD spells, use guys are wisdom caster and that means it you will have less mana that an INT caster, so our tap for 11 dmg may not be much, it costs practically no mana&nbsp;&nbsp;at all whereas those @#%^ty DD's cost you guys about 1 blue or maybe even 1.5.  <br>Obviously you have never added INT to your SK. My SK's base INT is at 117 and with my INT gear on it is around 130, that makes my 36 dmg tap, cost me about 1/4 or so of one bub of mana.  Whereas your guys heal may save downtime, it takes you a whole bar, according to you, to heal yourself full, well that means that maybe you did save the healer some mana, but now you have no mana to cast spells making you just a weak warrior for very long time, and since you will no longer have mana, that downtime you saved is now back in use.  As for our taps,  maybe they do have a long recast time, who cares they do better than your heals and thats all that matters.<br>About the darkness, enchanters only really mez when you pull more than one thing.  Now why theh lle would you ast darkness on two things, just cast it on one mez the other, and when your ready to break the mez, just darkness it.<br>Dont diss PvP just cuz rangers blow some major ass at it, and i wasnt saying that a warrior and ranger archery duel was going to be even, i was pointing out that even if you do root and arrow them to death, they can still shoot arrows back and after that root runs out, at lest you wont have full health<br>So i can tell by your respons to the epic that you do realize they suck, and taht the SK epic is much much much better, i aslo forgot to include that it has bash ability on it to interrupt caster.<br>Rangers dont deal as much offensive damage as you think they do. A monk, rogue, and warrior deal more dmg, and near the end of the game, you rangers are at the bottom of the pecking order in damage dealing.  As for rangers being a fun class to play? maybe if your blasted off your ass  and you think its fun to track things and act like a fruity flower sniffing ranger.  And i guess you do realize that a ranger unique skill, track does blow major ass and that HT is sooo much better.<br>&nbsp;<br>Kildiar, The Shadow Knight Inoruuk Rejected<br><br>"A warrior's quote once said rangers suck....I agree"</td></tr>

I also play a 43rd Ranger and from damage output of both in melee, my ranger far outdamages my Sk (sk using MoSS). As for solo ability they are both equal but as in group ability my ranger let just say I can shout for a group as a ranger and get one quick, but as Sk well unless no warrior/monk/ranger are available he might get a pick up group.&nbsp;&nbsp;I enjoy playing my Sk or I wouldnt have invested the time to get to 40th. But in raid situations Warrior is number one tank, then you get damage dealers monk/rogue/ranger and if none of those available you take an sk or pally as back up tank. <br><br>As for Sk's having better epic I think not they are probably about equal due to disparity in weapon skill.  You have to be able to hit mob for it to damage just ask uber raid guild to run a log of damage output by Ranger and Sk and you will see the damage the Sk do in melee is laughable, most of the time they miss or hit for min damage cuz offensive cap sucks for the knight classes.<br><br>So in other words Kildiar, stick to posting on a subject you actually have some knowledge about.<br><br>Cannis 43rd Ranger<br>Razer 40th Shadowknight<br>&nbsp;<br>Cannis 60th Ranger<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ok, first off there is such a thing as the return key to have coherent paragraphs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also the shift key works wonders for capitalization.  Not to mention the occasional punctuation will help get your ideas across.  Let me go through and refute what you have written, yet again.  Another somewhat long post.  This will be my last one, as I am sure that I will not get through to this Troll.<br><br>"ok, for your DD spells, use guys are wisdom caster and that means it you will have less mana that an INT caster, so our tap for 11 dmg may not be much, it costs practically no mana at all whereas those @#%^ty DD's cost you guys about 1 blue or maybe even 1.5."<br><br>A 110 int or a 110 wis generate the same amount of mana. For example, at level 10, a 110 int or wisdom generates 240 mana.  So throw that part out the window.  Now, a level 22 Wood Elf (just for an example) with a Base 85 wisdom will have 418 mana before any other considerations.  Assuming the hybrid spell penalty is 50%, that means each ignite would cost 45 mana, and that is about 1/2 of a blue bubb of mana, not one or 1.5 as you claim.  Throw that part out.  For you to nuke for 37 you have to cast the level 15 tap 4 times (for 44 damage).  4*18= 72 mana.  With the same 240 mana, that comes out to just a hair under a full bubb of mana.  This includes the fact that lifetaps no longer cost SKs extra mana. Ranger 1: Troll 0<br><br>"Obviously you have never added INT to your SK. My SK's base INT is at 117 and with my INT gear on it is around 130, that makes my 36 dmg tap, cost me about 1/4 or so of one bub of mana. "<br><br>Chugrahk.  Ogre SK level 34.  Int 130 with gear.  So at 34, we have the same mana base.  That makes this a little easier =)  Just to clarify, there is not 36 damage lifetap.  It caps at 45 damage, and starts at 39, and costs 63 mana per cast.  Using the mana calculator, at 34, with 130 int that is 952 mana.  That comes out to 15 taps per bar, or 2/3 bubb per tap.  A little simple math can fix a lot, no?<br>Ranger 2: Troll 0<br><br>"Whereas your guys heal may save downtime, it takes you a whole bar, according to you, to heal yourself full, well that means that maybe you did save the healer some mana, but now you have no mana to cast spells making you just a weak warrior for very long time, and since you will no longer have mana, that downtime you saved is now back in use. As for our taps, maybe they do have a long recast time, who cares they do better than your heals and thats all that matters."<br><br>Well, let's see.  If I have to dump a full bar of mana to heal myself (which, btw doesn't happen after level 39 with the new heal), that means the Cleric is OOM or VLOM.  Odds are I am gonna heal to a comfortable amount (read 50%), then sit and med.  I will then ask the cleric if I should continue to heal.  The reason for this is he/she may need to rebuff people.  Because I am not going to have the 200 wis/int a lot of casters do, I have comparatively less mana, so it takes less time for me to med back to 70%+.  If the cleric says keep healing, I will.  And I will still be able to med back up to a workable level before the cleric says ready.  The cleric's 1428 mana vs my 952.  That works out to by the time he meds to full, I can med a full bar +50% over again.  Math, gotta love it.  As to your taps being better than a heal, that is sutuation dependent.  That tap doesn't do anything to save/heal the enchanter who is DoT'd and the cleric is OOM.<br><br>Rangers 3:  Troll 0 <br><br>"Dont diss PvP just cuz rangers blow some major ass at it, and i wasnt saying that a warrior and ranger archery duel was going to be even, i was pointing out that even if you do root and arrow them to death, they can still shoot arrows back and after that root runs out, at lest you wont have full health "<br><br>Ask around.  Rangers are quite feared on the PvP servers.  SoW, snare, archery, and Damage shields along with some offensive spells, and the ability to heal all add up to a tough mother to kill if played right.  In an Arrow war with a Ranger, if his archery is respectable, the Ranger will always win, hands down.  Even if you do a bubble of health to me, I will have done at least that much to you, more than likely twice as much.<br><br>PvP doesn't count.  Score stays even.<br><br>"So i can tell by your respons to the epic that you do realize they suck, and taht the SK epic is much much much better, i aslo forgot to include that it has bash ability on it to interrupt caster. "<br><br>Epics do not define the class.  If they do, then Verant screwed up.  Only Ragebringer, the Click Stick, and the Magician Epic are class defining.<br><br>Score stays the same.  Epics not a valid point when deciding if a class "sucks".<br><br>"Rangers dont deal as much offensive damage as you think they do. A monk, rogue, and warrior deal more dmg, and near the end of the game, you rangers are at the bottom of the pecking order in damage dealing. As for rangers being a fun class to play? maybe if your blasted off your ass and you think its fun to track things and act like a fruity flower sniffing ranger. And i guess you do realize that a ranger unique skill, track does blow major ass and that HT is sooo much better."<br><br>Ooo where to begin?   End Game Warriors will NEVER deal more damage.  Why?  They have defensive disc going 90% of the time.  Monks normally won't.  Why?  No aggro management.  Rogues clean everyone's clocks.  Why?  Not part of this discussion.  Rangers have the Jolt line of spells to deal with Aggro, so they can unload more freely than the monk.  Warriors look for aggro, not damage output. Aggro= fast weapons+procs, even if they suck (but there are some VERY nice weapons that fit this to a T).  If you think you need to blast your arse off to have fun as a Ranger, then play a Wizzy.  Rangers are all about squeezing as much efficiency as they can from their spells, not going nuke happy.  As to Harm Touch being better...  You can use it once every 90 minutes of real time.  I can recycle track every 10 seconds.  Bet Track gets a lot more practical use.  You should have been saying that Feign Dead is the spell ability that makes SKs so awesome.  HT is just a circus trick.<br><br>Rangers 4 : Troll 0<br><br>There you go.  Some basic math clears up the falsehoods you claim make the Ranger class suck.  Please, go away.  I am not going to respond to you anymore.  Have a nice day.<br><br>Gorthin Spiritcaller <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

The SK max's out at 225. This translates into "Ranger does more damage AND hits more often." This is even with 2handed weapons.<br><br>Every Class has it's use. Rangers are a Melee version of the Wizzy. Maximum damage with Minimum agro. We agree that we will never take damage as well as an SK. We don't want to.

The Ranger is always guaging the effects of his attacks, the effects of the attacks of those around him AND the effects of the MoB on himself and his party.<br><br>I can,<br>-Heal others in a fight (AKA try to keep the cleric from dying... can you?),<br>-Let you know when a particularly rare/dangerous MoB is up from across the zone (Gorenair just doesn't like wolf form, does she?

Only problem? its 1hb, so 90% of rangers won't be able to use it, because they've done no work in 1hb.  Other examples come to mind as well: there's a Ranger only 2hb that drops in a Kunark dungeon that has a ratio of something like 31/35 or so, which is pretty nice for any weapon.<br>&nbsp;<br>Malevant Faeshadow.&nbsp;&nbsp;Outrider.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>How many times have you tried to find a group. Well when I have that trouble i switch over to my ranger. With healing to recover your down time is cut down. A warrior solo is stuck at half health most of the time and my ranger deals the same damage and is always topped off. Also with hide and camo you can safely recover your health without being pestered by stuff. The other ability that make rangers great solo is snare. The trick is if your lossing a fight snare the critters and run for zone. Sometimes I snare 3 critters at a time to get away. The final solo tool is root spell. This spells let you root one critter as you defeat the other. Then if your health is ok you take out the second one too. If not just snare and run to zone. My favorite zone for a level 30+ ranger is Crystal Caverns. The orcs don't hit hard and players will pay you serious cash for pieces and Velium. Also the drops from Herbalist, Foreman and Oracle will give you some serious cash. Also you can sell at the merchants in CC with sneak. <br><br>Good Hunting <br>Ranger of the 40th Circle <br>Marteau of 7th.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hi All!<br><br>I am a Level 10 Ranger on the Sullon Zek server.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Neutral Half Elf bound to Butcherblock, and have to train in Kelethin (Goodie Central).  Needless to say I don't go into G-Fay very often.<br><br>My setup and question is this...because the chances of me being PK'd in GFay and Kelethin greatly increases when I am there, I save up my training points.  I still have to train my lvl 10 points (sneak), and I have meditate coming up at 12.  All my skills are pretty much maxed out.  I will be dumping 1 point into sneak and one in meditate (i think you have to train meditate???).  So now my long winded question is this...after training sneak and meditate (if necessary) I will have 13 training points to assign, what should I do?  Should I dump them into forage...cause it sucks or should I save them up for lvl 15 or lvl 18 (dual wield) and 20 (dual attack)???<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Save them. Just keep practising forrage whenever the button re-sets and it will eventually go up, yes it is slow to ebggin with but things improove. Deffinately save the points for later but you might want to put a few more(but not all) into your spells.<br>Good Luck<br><br>Deudred Rainstalker <br>38 Ranger <br>Innoruk<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
