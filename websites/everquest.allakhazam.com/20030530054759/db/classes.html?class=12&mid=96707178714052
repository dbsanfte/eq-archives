	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have seen a few good magician guide posts, however I am gonna show you how to REALLY do good as a magician. This is VERY LONG:<br><br>First off choose your race. I suggest putting 25 points into intelligence and 5 into chrisma. Also, DON'T BE A HUMAN. Some people say humans level faster than every other race...well guess what..THEY DON'T. Plus humans start with the lowest intelligence and are blind in the night. If you are just starting your character I suggest being a Gnome or High Elf. When you start give your note to your guildmaster and get your newbie robe. Put one training point into piercing, evocation, abjuration, conjuration, and channeling. Scribe your two newbie spells minor shielding and Burst of Flame. Always keep your self buffed with minor shielding - it does make a big differnce at low levels. Use Burst of Flame to help kill your enemy while you melee it. get to level 4...no big problem. <br><br>Now the fun starts. At level 4 you get new spells and the meditation skill. Only put one point into medition. It will raise very fast. You should buy Summon food, Summon water, Flare, Summon dagger(all level 1 spells)...Summon Bandages, Burn, Gate, level 4 earth pet, level 4 water pet. At level 4 you should only buy the earth and water pets. The air and fire ones aren't very useful at these levels, however will become much more usefull at higher levels(especially the air pet!). Sense you can summon bandages it is a good idea to summon a lot of them and practice yuor bind bound skill. It will allow you to heal any player, including your self up to half health. Also at these lower levels it is a VERY good idea to give your pets rusty two-handed weapons (rusty scythes, two-handed swords, and halberds). They will make your pets do MASSIVE damage and allow you to take BIG things. Now from level 4 until 8 your fighting strategy will be simple: send your pet, nuke the MOB with your damage spell (called a DD for short, for all you newbies reading this), and go in and tank for a pet if needed. Since you started out as a gnome or high-elf like I told you to (you did didn't you, hehe), you will be able to kill kobolds to get to level 6. If you are a high elf just run to steamfont...its only a 5 minute run. If you are a gnome...well steamfont is your newbie zone so you should already be there. The kobold camp has 3 kobolds that spawn at the camp and one off the side of the camp on the mountain side. To take the 3 kobolds you will need to give your pet a rusty scythe, two-handed sword, or halberd. They aren't that hard to find. Go to greater faydark and ask around for some. Or go to Felwithe, the starting city of the high elves. You will be able to find some rusty two-handers at many vendors. Kobolds will get you to level 6. Once you get to level 6 I suggest going to Butcher Block and killing dwarven skelatons at the druid ring. They are levels 5-7 and are VERY good exp. If your pet has a two hander you will do very well. The dwarven skelatons will get you to level 8.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Some people when they first start out don't know how to control their pets. Here are all of the commands you will need to use to control your pet.<br><br>/pet attack - send your pet after whatever you want.<br>/pet back off - makes your pet back off the thing you are fighting. Has to be hit multiple times to work, and if your enemy attacks you yuor pet will go in again.<br>/pet report health - this command makes yourpet tell you how much health it has left. VERY usefull command. Use it a lot in battle. Make sure your pet doesn't die.<br>/pet gaurd here - makes your pet stay where they are and come assist you if anything attacks you. They will return to the spot they left after killing whatever attacked you.<br>/pet get lost - if you get a lower level pet and you aren't satisfied, use this command to get rid of the pet and summon a more powerful one. <br><br>Some other things about pets. Once you get to level 8 MAKE SURE that you outdamge your pet with you DD spells. If you don't outdamage your pet then your pet will get half of the exp. from whatever you killed. From level 4-7 its fine if your pet outdamages you, and since you should be giving your lower level pets rusty two-handed weapons to maked them do A LOT more damage, you probably won't be able to outdamge your pet. However once you get to level 8 make sure you take a little over half of your enemy's HP off with your own DD's so you get full exp. for the kill.<br><br>Level 8 is when magicians start to become REALLY good. At this level they get two great DD's, a damage shield, invisibility, a pet healing spell, a bunch of summoning spells, and of course your pets. The problem is that at this level spells suddenly cost a LOT for their level and you will have A LOT of spells to buy. If you have another higher level character this is no problem, but new characters will have to conserve their money. If you are low on money i suggest buying these spell first and the rest later: level 8 earth pet, Shock of Blades, Sheild of Fire, Invisibility, and Staff of Tracing. These are the only spells you will need for now. The summon staff spell can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. Now to make a ton of money you are going to hunt wisps. Wisps can only be hit by magician means( ie spells or a magical weapon), so it is very important to buy your level 8 summon staff spell, becuase it will make your pets able to hit the wisps. <br><br>The best place to hunt wisps is on the wisp island located between Odus and Qeynos. To get to it, ride the boat from qeynos to Odus and get off at the island the boat stops at in the middle of the ride. Be sure you brought a lot of backpacks/small containers. The strategy to kill these things will be: summon and earth pet and give it a staff you summoned. Then buff the earth pet with your fire damage shield. Then send it in on the wisp and stand back and keep burning the wisp until it is dead.  Tank for your pet and cast your shock of swords spell inbetween the attacks of the wisp if needed. Make sure the wisp you attack is along and there are no other ones near. Wisps WILL assist each other and at this level 2 wisps means death. Also, you will want to use your level 1 "summon dagger" spell against the wisps becuase it will summon a magical weapon, and if you are just starting out and don't have a higher level character, you probably won't have access to a magical weapon. Now when you loot the wisps destroy the burnt out lightstone and regular lightstone they drop. However save the Greater Light Stones. You will get one greater lightstone for about every 5 wisps you kill. When all of your backpacks and containers are totally full with Greater light stones, take them to the gypsy camp and give them to one of the ladys(I forget which lady it is exactly...just ask someone). For every greater light stone you give her you will get a good deal of exp. for this level and about 9pp. Very soon you will have enough money to buy the rest of your spells. Here are all the other level 8 spells you will want to buy:<br><br>Renew Elements - this spell will heal your pets. It is good spell during downtime if they aren't fully healed by the time your mana is full. YOu won't need it with your level 8 pets, but your level 12 pets that have more hp and regen slower(becuase of your pet buff burnout) might need to be healed sometimes. This spell is based off your Alteration magic group. This is the first alteration spell you will get. It will fizzle a lot, so practice it up.<br><br>Dimensional Pocket - this spell summons a 4-slot weightless container that makes anything you put into it weightless. Very useful, however USE WITH CAUNTION. The pocket, and everything you put in it, will dissapear if you log off. Is good at higher levels when MOBS are dropped a lot of weapons that are too heavy to carry. Just summon a pocket and put them in it until you can go sell them. This spell can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities.<br><br>Eye of Zoom - this isn't as useful a spell as it is fun. It will summon an eye than you can move around and see with. You can't have a pet out to cast this spell. Its fun to scout out an area with or scare lower level people, but it isn't really that useful.<br><br>Lesser Sheilding - this is an upgrade to your level 1 minor shielding spell. Always keep yourself buffed with it.<br><br>Flame Bolt - this is the other DD(direct damage) spell you get at level 8. It has a MUCH farther range than shock of swords and does more damage per hit. The downsides to it are that it takes more mana, has a slightly longer casting time, requires you to have a clear line of sight with your enemy, and will get resisted a lot by things with high fire resists. Its good for pulling things becuase you will be able to get 3 of them off before the monster can reach you, but generally you will want to use Shock of Swords.<br><br>Now you will be able to get to level 12 quickly by killing wisps and turning in Greater Light Stones. You will also make a ton of money. I highly suggest buying a Stein of Mogguk with all your new money. It gives +10 to your intelligence, which gives you more mana. Also, i would buy some other +int necklaces, earrings, and rings. A new robe would be good too(do you wanna wear your newbie robe forever??) Here are the level 12 spells you will want to buy:<br><br>Burnout - This spell will make your pets regen their hp slower, but it will also make them attack better. A good pet buff spell. Always keep it on your pet.<br><br>Bind Affinity - AWESOME SPELL. This will allow you to bind yourself anywhere so that when you die, thats where you will appear. Before you got this spell you had to have other people bind you, and you can only be bound in cities when other people cast it.<br><br>Cancel Magic - this has several uses. First off it can be used to remove any buffs your enemy has on themselves. Secondly, it can be used to remove most(but not all) DoT's(or damage over time spells) that were cast on you by the enemy.<br><br>Ward Summoned - This is a good spell to use in lavastorm. The only problem is that there are way better places to hunt than lavastorm. Against elemenals it is VERY good. It does the damage of fire bolt, and has the low resist, quick casting time, and lower mana that Shock of Steel has. However, it can only be used against summoned things. The only time you will use it is when dueling other people that have pets. <br><br>Summon Fang - This spell summons a 5/26 weapon that will hit magical creatures(hehe wisps!). If you still don't have a magical weapon at this level use this instead of your level 1 summon dagger spell to hit wisps with. You can fight wisps up to level 16, so it will still be usefull. It can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities.<br><br>Elemental Earth - Your earth pet will be the only pet you need to buy. It has massive hp and casts a root spell to keep the enemy away from you. Buffed with burnout and with its massive hp, you might get to full mana before it gets to full health. If that happens use your renew elements spell.<br><br>You also get two area effect spells at this level. You can buy them if you want, but you won't need them. They are almost totally useless for soloing, which is what you should be doing at lower levels.<br><br>At level 12 there are a lot of things open to you. You can kill wisps all the way until level 16. At level 12 your pets will be to hit magical things without wielding magical weapons. Since your level 12 pets will only do 16 damage per hit(and thats the maximum level pets), you should be giving them rusty-two handed weapons. If you can't get any two-handed weapons then just give your pet any weapon. If your pet has a weapon they will do a little more damage than normal even if the weapon doesn't make them hit for a higher maximum damage. Now if you don't want to kill wisps there are a ton of other things to do. <br><br>In Lake Rathe there is a level 15 monk called the hermit. He stands in this hut int he corner of the zone, and repsawns every 5 minutes after being killed. He can get you to level 16 if you don't want to do wisps, or want to mix things up. Summon an earth pet, buff with damage shield and burnout, and then send your pet in and stand back and blast with Shock of Swords until he dies. Tank for pet if needed, however don't do it too much. At level 12 he will kill you quickly. Remember, make sure to outdamage your pet. He is very good exp. and will get you to level 16 preety quick. The loot isn't nearly as good as wisps though.<br><br>Another place to hunt is in OOT(the ocean of tears), which is located between the continents of Antonica and feydwer. You will be hunting sirens in this zone. Go to the docks in freeport and bind yourself there. If you take the ship from freeport to butcher block you will eventually come to two large rocks coming out of the water. Jump off the boat and swim to the rock ont he right. Here you will see two level 12 sirens. Buff your earth pet with burnout and your damage shield and send it in. If you bought your area effect spells this would be the time to use them(in fact it is the ONLY use for them). The sirens hit fairly hard but have low hp. After you kill the two sirens they will start spawning one at a time. Kill them as soon as they spawn very quickly. That way you won't have to fight  2 at a time anymore. This spot is AMAZING exp, however like the hermit, it is not nearly as good loot as wisps. Also, be sure to give your pet a rusty two-handed sword befoe you engage the sirens. The best spot to buy rusty weapons is on the boat from freeport to butcher block. At the first stop you will arrive at sister island. Get off and go in the shop. They sell rusty halberds here. When givin to your pet, they will make your pet do 20 damage a hit.<br><br>Soon you will be level 16. All of these methods will level you fast(although I still think wisps are the best method becuase they give so much money). Once you get to level 16 the best place to hunt is in lake rathe, which is where the hermit was located if you went to fight him from 12-16. Before I talk about lake rathe I will tell you your new spells for level 16:<br><br>Shock of Flame - a new DD spell! At level 12 you didn't get a new DD, except for ward summoned which you probably didn't use. For 70 mana this spell will start off doing 91 damage and eventually raise to 97 damage. <br><br>See Invisible - this spell will allow you to see invisible players and pets. Since your air pet casts invisiblity on itself a lot, its good to use this spell when using an air pet.<br><br>Summon Throwing Daggers - this spell will summon a bunch of throwing dagger that can be given to someone that uses throwing weapons (monks, rogues, and bards in general). This spell can only be bought in the dark elf, gnome, and erudite cities.<br><br>Heatstone - this spell will summon an item that will grant the user infravision. Is good to give to night-blind races or to use yourself if you started as an Erudite or human(Although if you are a begginer you probably did what I said and started as a gnome or high elf, which means you all ready have infravision).<br><br>Staff of Warding - summons an 8/38 staff with a couple charges of glimpse(which always you to see farther). It really doesn't have much use except to play around with the glimpse spell it comes with(or you can give it to a low level newbie...is a good weapon for a newbie). This spell can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities.<br><br>Level 16 pets - At this level I would suggest buying all the pets. Also at this level you can not buy all the pets in your guild. The level 16 and 20 pets must be bought in OOT(the ocean of tears). I forget which island has the vendor that sells the pets, so ask around.<br><br>Shielding - An upgrade to your lesser shielding spell. keep it on at all times. The extra hp and ac can save your life if you need to tank and its a close battle.<br><br>Phantom Leather - this spell boots your AC and also lets your regen your HP a little faster. It is good for if you are going into a tough battle where you will probably have to tank.<br><br>At level 16 you get the ability to start researching. Go to your guild and put one point into your researching skill and it will be maxed until level 20(there is a bug where after putting a point in at your guild it raises your skill higher then its suposed to). Of all the pure casters, magicians have it the hardest when it comes to researching. They have to combine old spells, a word, and an item to make scrolls they can use. I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about researching becuase it would take a LONG time to explain. So go to castersrealm.com and look at the magician research stuff. Hehe if you are a newbie first starting out, feel lucky. When i first started the game resarching was nearly impossible. Since then, however, they have made it easier(although it is still fairly hard).<br><br>Okay Now back to the hunting guide. At level 16 venture to Lake rathe. Here you will find a bunch of aviak guards that are level 16-20. For their level, they aren't that hard. At level 16 you will be able to take level 20 aviaks. This is also the level when you should start grouping. Almost all the aviaks in this zone are close together, and will attack you at the same time. The only time you will want to solo when hunting them is if you are at the single aviak spawn, or at the entrance to the arena zone where you can take the two aviaks one at a time. However this isn't always possible, as they are sometimes camped, so you will have to group with another person(or two other people if you want to take the 3-spawn aviaks). Aviaks are pretty good loot dropping up to 3pp and FS(fine steel) weapons which will sell for about 5pp each at the ogre vendors in the zone(don't worry even though they are ogres they sell to everyone). The aviak guards also drop words which you can use to research some of your level 16 spells(if you didn't buy them already).<br><br>Fighting aviak guards will get you to level 20 pretty quickly. When you get to level 20 its time for new spells! Here is the list of spells:<br><br>Bolt of Flame - this spell does MASSIVE damage and has a VERY long range too! But be careful, it has a huge taunt rate so you will usually want to use an earth or air pet when soloing becuase of their root/stun spells. Also you have to have a clear line of sight for it too work.<br><br>Elemental Shield - a fairly useful buff for things that cast spells. Raises your cold and fire resistances.<br><br>Spear of Warding - summons a magical spear that has a small fire and cold resist+ tacked on to it. Not all that usefull. Give it to a newbie or a a rogue without a magic piercing weapon. can also be given to pet, but once you hit 29 and get your rune swords, it becomes useles to give to pets. It can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities.<br><br>Renew Summoning - this is a very nice upgrade to your level 8 pet-only healing spell. Use it when your pet is low in HP or if your mana is full and your pet's hp isn't full.<br><br>Summon Arrows - this spell summons a bunch of magical arrows. Give them to people that use bows and don't want to spend money making or buying arrows. Fairly useful. Can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities.<br><br>Summon Waterstone - this summons a stone with a charge of enduring breath, which makes you able to breathe under-water. Great for when you want to go to kedge keep at higher levels, or just to keep in your inventory incase you for some reason get caught under-water. It can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities.<br><br>Shield of Flame - an upgrade to your level 8 damage shield. Definately use it to buff yuor pet before you attack something or in a group on the tanks. <br><br>Rain of Fire - an area effect spell. Is useful when your group wants to take multiple mobs and their is no enchanter around to mezz the extras. Be careful though, it will get the monsters mad at you. It is limited in its use.<br><br>Level 20 pets - I suggest that you buy all of the pets at this level. You can't buy them all at your guild. You have to go to the merchant in OOT on one of the islands to get the rest that aren't sold at your guild.<br><br>Now the level 20 fighting place - SOUTH KARANA!!!! This zone has TONS of stuff in it. At level 20 there are many things you can do. First off is the aviak city. The aviaks here anywhere from about levels 15-30. Get a group and kill rooks that spawn on the bottom, or go up to the penthouse.  Splitpaw - right outside the dungeon of split paw there are three spires and a hill. Level 24-29 gnolls spawn here. If you are able to get in a group the exp. is pretty decent. Treants, these things are pretty good exp. and VERY good loot. They are heavily camped though, so you might have to wait to get in a group. Alsom treants drop your faction with druids and with qeynos, so don't kill them if you don't want to be KOS at the druid rings or in qeynos. Centaurs, these guys can be good exp. and drop some nice items too. The best place to hunt them is near the centaur outpost. Many will wander by the outpost. You will be able to solo any that don't con red. If you get in a group with someone that can track it is even better because sometimes the pickings get slim and having someone who can easily find more make for good exp. Also, there are a couple merchants in one of the stables at the centaur outpost. Sell there. <br><br>The last thing this wonderful zone offerrs....the hermit. In the middle of nowhere is alevel 20 ranger. He is VERY good exp. Why? becuase he has a 3 MINUTE SPAWN. Not only that but the loot he drops isn't bad. PLUS, sometimes he drops FS two-handed weapons which you can give to your pet to make them do 24 damage a hit. The only problem is that he sits in a hut with a door that won't open. To pull him out go near the chimney of the house and say 'kill you'. After doing that a few times he will attack you through the wall and your pet will go after him. You won't be able to use your level 20 bolt spell the first time you attack him becuase it won't go through the wall. use your level 16 DD that will still hit him. I HIGHLY suggest that you use a water or air pet to camp him. Why? Becuase since he repsawns every 3 minutes, your earth pet will never be able to regen in time, only your water or air pet will be able to keep up(well the fire pet could keep up too, but you don't want to use him here, dies way too fast). After you kill him the first time you won't need to say 'kill you' anymore. As soon as he spawns again just target your pet and type /assist. Then the hermit will auto maticcaly be targeted and you can pull him out of the house using your level 16 DD, and then once he teleportes out of the house you can use your level 20 DD. However, if you are using a water pet and not an air pet, try to keep him in the house, pull him with your level 16 DD and then send your pet in, and then burn with caution so he stays on your water pet and does teleport out to attack you. If you are using an air pet it is fine to pull him out becuase the air pet will stun him and let you DD.<br><br>With everything it has to offer South karana will be able to get you to level 30. You can easily get from level 20 to 27 just soloing the hermit. Then once you get to level 27 you can go into splitpaw and fighting in a group to get decent exp. If the hermit is camped by someone ele you can always do centaurs, gnolls ouside of splitpaw, and aviaks. If you don't mind losing faction with the druids and qeynos you can also kill treants which are a VERY good money source. <br><br>Once you get to level 30 you can go out and do whatever you want. Level 30 is the first 'hell' level so leveling to level 31 will take you a while. Also on the level 24 and 29 spells....buy ALL of them. Also, some of the level 24 and 29 pet spells can't be bought and MUST be researched. You should be able to get past without researching extra pets, but you might want to. Also, when you get to level 29 ALWAYS give your pet two rune swords that you are able to summon once you get to level 29. They will make your pet do a lot more damage. If you want to look at all the magician spells or how to research go to castersrealm.com . GREAT sight. Maybe I will see you on the Nameless!<br><br>Corpusnuntia/Divineshadow/Natalos/Naltec/Plantmaster/Zuranthium<br><br>Player of many characters on the Nameless server.<br><br>Give me a good rating for this one! Took me an hour to write! Also sorry about the spell/grammer mistakes. I am sure I made some, but I didn't have time to check em. *wave* <br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I just wanted to clear up a few errors and oversights in this post, since the author is toting it as the be-all and end-all newbie guide.<br><br>First off, as a magician you are specifically a pet class.&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, it is your responsibility to get to know your pets and their capabilities early on in the game.  This is the reason you're given access to all four from the very beginning.  You MUST purchase all four pets and become accustomed to them.  A mage who doesn't know his pets is a bad mage and will be recognized as such by the people he groups with.<br><br>Secondly, rusties equipped by pets do nothing more than look cool.  They do not, in any way enhance your pet's fighting skills.  Even when your pet (at level 24) becomes capable of dual-wielding, he will do the same damage with the same delay barehanded.  The only weapons that will enhance his fighting skills are weapons that process (i.e. velium weapons), and even with these only if he's been buffed for dexterity.<br><br>Thirdly, Evocation!  Evocation!  Evocation!  You must start early in always keeping this particular skill maxxed at all times.  At earlier levels, it won't mean much.  But once you become able to specialize it will make a huge difference in your effectiveness at later levels.  Although there are some who disagree, I think most mages feel that it's silly and wasteful to specialize in anything other than Evocation (there is an argument in favor of specializing in conjuration - but I personally feel it's a losing argument).  Therefore, your 'shock' spells should be used sparingly.  The 'bolt' spells are more difficult to use (because they require a clear line of sight), but will be more useful to you in the long run.  'Shock' spells are really only useful when it's impossible to get a clear line of sight (i.e. when a MOB is surrounded by tanks and you can't position yourself correctly to get a clear line of sight).  If you've specialized in evocation and have this skill maxxed, you will be incredibly powerful in your later years!<br><br>And finally, Research!  Research!  Research!  The suggestion that you might want to 'get by' without researching all your pets is nonsense.  If you plan to do anything aside from sitting in one place and killing the same thing over and over again, you'll need all your pets.  Different dungeons require different pets and different MOBs (which have different resists) require different pets.  Also, if you've ignored your research, you're gonna spend a fortune buying your higher level spells from other mages.  I personally charge 30 p for each Lvl. 20 - 29 researched spell that I sell, 50 p for each 30 - 39, and 100 p for each 40 - 49.  (This is on top of the player having to supply me with the research components.)  My justification for this is that I spend my time and effort working on my research skill - something the other mage was too lazy to do.  I should be paid well for this.  (At higher levels, most mages have come to terms with how important it is to have ALL your pets and are generally happy to pay my price.)<br><br>P. S.  NEVER rely completely on the advice of just one person!  There's more than one way to skin a cat (or a kobold...or a gnoll...or...)<br>&nbsp;<br>Dovilo Ravenstear<br>52 Mage of the Tribunal<br>Tuatha De Danann<br><br><br>Have Pet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Will Travel.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I'd disagree a bit on the character selection on this one.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bottom line is play what ever race you feel comfortable with.  In the long run stats don't really matter that much. You will pick up stat enhancing equipment and get your INT up to 200 without a lot of trouble.  The advantage of playing a human is that you get an Exp bonus.  As you get older and you (and everyone else) maxes out the INT at 200, you still get the exta Exp bonus. Might not see the benefit as much early on, but with INT maxed, the Exp bonus is a help and will let you level faster.  The night blind thing is a pain short term, but you get heatstone fairly quick and your summonded staffs are great light sources.  You won't be blind long (also ask a magi brother or sister to cast a heatstone or coldstone for you, never had someone say no and I do it for newbies now as well).  So the issue above with humans can be resolved short term. Don't aviod this race because of some short term issues.<br><br>In the short term stats do help out.  If you are really interested in stats then the Euridite is a great choice.  Has the highest intelligence by far (means you have to find less INT items long term).  The night blind stuff can be dealt with short term (I'm an Euridite magi and never found it to be much of an issue). Gnome is a good choice, less INT but good other stats.  The High Elf is more of a WIS type character.  Has the second lowest INT (long term won't matter, but we're talking short term here). Vision is good, but you can fix that in short order with the non infravision characters.<br><br>I would suggest taking your last 5 points and putting them into AGI or STR.  I don't see a lot of benefit in CHA.  It will help you with selling but 5 points doesn't do much.  Spend a level or two in BB and kill gnolls (or have an enchanter friend sell your stuff or get CHA items to help). It quickly raises your faction with the merchants of qeynos.  I am regarded warmly by all of them and get good prices.  The AGI will help you avoid getting hit and at lower levels that is a real benefit. The reality is 5 points really has little effect no matter where you put them. Putting them in STR lets you carry more stuff.  Again not a big benefit.  I'd stick with AGI on the last 5.<br><br>Cetus<br>The Nameless<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>YOU ARE COMPLETELY WRONG CETUS. Humans get NO exp. bonus over the other races that magicians can be. They level at the exact same speed. I said in my magician guide for NEWBIES to start out as high-elves or gnomes. As in characters that have never played the game before or only have one other low level character. Gnomes and High-elves are the best race for newbies becuase they are the two races that magicians can choose that have night vision and aren't evil. Also, high elves and gnomes start on the continent of Feydwer which is MUCH better for a newbie. Less danger than on all the other continents. Trust me, I know what I am talking about. Stop trying to think you know more or know better than a master magician. My guide, especially the 2nd one I wrote that added more stuff, is very good. Any newbie would be MUCH better off after reading it.<br><br>Zuranthium/Corpusnuntia/Divineshadow/Plantmaster/Sunsong/Natalos/Naltec<br><br>Player of many characters on the Nameless server.<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Zuranthium,<br><br>Your posts by and large are quite informative.&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned a great deal about the Magician Class from them.  Nothing that I hadn't ALREADY learned, from other sites, but still informative.<br><br>However, all the good guides in the world don't justify your attitude towards other posters.  In my efforts to learn more about the Magician, I've been flipping through this board, and I found some things that I think the other posters here will find interesting.<br><br>Your guide is posted at least twice here, the VERY long one.  Once under its own thread, and once in someone else's thread, about their own guide.  To me, in a clear effort to try to shut out anybody else's guide but your own.<br><br>On several occasions, you posted responses to other people's guides.  In just about every one of those replies, you disagreed very rudely with the people who wrote those guides, basically calling their opinions stupid and idiotic.  Then you would occasionaly call yourself a 'Master Magician', tell them to stop acting like they know more than you, and reference them to your own guide.<br><br>As to your 'Master Magician' status.  I recall a post where someone informed the board that you're really a Magician in your lower twenties.  Could you please, for the basis of accurately evaluating your guides, post your specific level so people will know?<br><br>All of that is for the other posters here.  I want anyone who is considering posting a guide, to be welcome to do so.  I promise them, no matter what this Zuranthium may threaten, you will have readers.<br><br>For myself, Zuranthium, I am extremely irritated by your very arrogant attitude and condescension towards other posters.  IMO, Centhat was right on the money earlier, and he owed you no apologies.  I am not going to read ANY of your posts or guides until you decide to stop lambasting anyone who tries to compete with your guides.  This isn't your board.  Stop your silly power play.  Apologize in a seperate post for your repeated insults and arrogance.  Also, stop plagiarizing other guides.  When you wrote your guide, you should have SPECIFICALLY cited the other guides used.  You did not.  You led others to believe that your guide was the fruits of your brain alone. It was not.<br><br>Werokh Mormegil/Amandil &lt;Akh Valahr&gt;<br>Dwarven Paladin/High Elf Magician<br>Cazic-Thule Server<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Calm down, it's a game.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've have read in many places that humans do get exp bonus.  I'd have to look for the sources now, but others can read eqcasters, stratics, everlore, and find the same references.<br><br>I don't want to be rude to you, but I have a different opinion than you on races.  Gnome and High-elves do get night vision.  That's great! If that is a concern for people, then they should play those races.  The point of my note was to say play the race you like best and equalize out the stats with equipment or equipment that enhances your short comings (like night vision).<br><br>I prefer the Euridite for his starting INT.  It is the primary stat and I like not having to look as much of INT equipment. Also for trade skills I like having the high INT early on so that you can get the skills up before you get INT equipment. I quickly moved him to Qeynos and got a bind there.  I agree that there are good spots in Feydwer. I also feel that Qeynos and Freeport are good spots as well.  There are a great number of mobs in the newbie area and good adjacent areas to move to.  I had a lot of fun in BB. Trains were bad but there are some great places in the dungeon that are fairly low risk and give great exp because few people move to those areas.<br><br>I've always thought of a high elf more for the WIS. In the end, once you get beyond the Euridite the other races (except human) are all pretty close on INT. So, again, if you want the night vision, then play the high elf and look for equipment to make up the INT.<br><br>Zuranthium, these boards are for everyone to express their opinions, not just you. I don't appreciate you personal attack.  I never said I knew more, just that my opinon is different.  As you get older you will learn that part of life, and your success, is how you handle other people with views that may not be the same as yours. I too have written articles on specific issues (managing magician engagement risk, solo hunting strategy, and a new article to be published soon)which have been published on the stratics website. While I may not be a master magician, I am not a newbie to the game and have put some thought into how to play it.  I'm interested in, and respect your opinions, I would ask that you give the same respect to myself and others that post on these boards.<br><br>Cetus<br>The Nameless<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
