  <P><A NAME="How to Group Properly"></A><B><I><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"
   SIZE="+1">Grouping</FONT></I> (these rules are very generic,
  and vary depending on the makeup of the group)</B></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><B>a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although you sometimes have little control
    over whom you group with, you should try to make up a balanced
    group.&nbsp; A group of 3 wizards is all attack and no defense,
    and will probably lead to 3 dead bodies.&nbsp; A good group includes
    at least one of each of the three class categories I listed above.&nbsp;
    Of course many classes, especially Bards and Druids, can handle
    a little of each role.&nbsp; A tank is an absolute necessity,
    but in a pinch the pet of a necro or magician can sometimes work.&nbsp;
    An attacking magic user such as a wizard is also important to
    kill the runners before they go get help or slam them when the
    fighter starts to hurt.&nbsp; Never turn down the addition of
    a cleric and his healing powers or a enchanter and his buffing
    powers.&nbsp; When forming a group, remember that the experience
    and gold are split between the members.&nbsp; Thus, if experience
    and gold are the only considerations, a good rule of thumb is
    to form only as big a group as is necessary to beat the monsters
    you plan on attacking.&nbsp; Of course part of the fun of grouping
    is meeting new people and hanging out, so don't turn down an
    additional body just to squeeze a little more experience out
    of the game.</B></P>
    <P><B>b.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before you start to hunt, establish the
    rules with your group.&nbsp; The group leader has a lot of responsibility
    for this.&nbsp; Leadership and party discipline can make or break
    a group.&nbsp; Determine in what order you will loot bodies and
    whether you will keep on autosplit.&nbsp; I would suggest you
    loot alphabetically and always split loot (just remember to turn
    it off before you get your corpse).&nbsp; It is the leader's
    responsibility to keep track of whose turn it is to loot.&nbsp;
    Make sure everyone knows their roles so that there is no confusion
    during the battle.&nbsp; A little talk before going out may save
    someone's life.</B></P>
    <P><B>c.&nbsp;&nbsp; A basic rule for parties is that you want
    to spend as little time sitting on your butt as possible.&nbsp;
    If you end a battle with one of the fighters way down in hit
    points or one of the magic users way down in mana, the whole
    party will have to go sit and wait for them to regenerate.&nbsp;
    Ideally, everyone should be down about the same amount so that
    the rest is needed equally by everyone.&nbsp; A fighter who stands
    in and takes all the damage while the rest of the group stays
    healthy or a wizard who blasts indiscriminately and wastes all
    his mana on a weak monster will soon find themselves having difficulty
    finding a group willing to take them. Remember that mana regenerates
    much faster than hit points, but hit points can be healed by
    a cleric or bard.</B></P>
    <P><B>d.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before you go out and start the hunt, designate
    who will take the lead.&nbsp; If you have a ranger, he should
    always take the lead since he can track the best monsters.&nbsp;
    Otherwise, it should be the group's tank.&nbsp; There are two
    basic strategies with this.&nbsp; Everyone can just follow the
    leader until he reaches an attackable creature then try and quickly
    form their places and attack, or the group can park in a defensible
    spot and send one member out as a runner to attack a creature
    and lead it back to where the rest of the party is waiting in
    ambush.&nbsp; Personally I prefer the latter strategy, but it
    does mean more time sitting around waiting for something to spawn.&nbsp;
    One point on this is that you need to follow the leader.&nbsp;
    This can't be emphasized enough.&nbsp; Most people play in first
    person mode and can't see if you are behind them.&nbsp; They
    have to assume you are following.&nbsp; If you wander off, you
    won't be there to help the others and they won't be able to come
    to your rescue when you get attacked by that mad grizzly bear.</B></P>
    <P><B>e.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fighters: Your role is to make sure that
    the monsters always attack you and stay off of the spell casters.&nbsp;
    Don't forget your taunt skill.&nbsp; Use it to keep the monsters
    attacking you.&nbsp; You should go in first and soften the monsters
    up before the spell casters administer the killing blow.&nbsp;
    Since the fighter is the least easily killed, when the fighter
    yells run, the whole party should immediately hightail it to
    safety.</B></P>
    <P><B>f.&nbsp;&nbsp; Magic Support.&nbsp; You should keep the
    whole party, especially the fighters, buffed at all times.&nbsp;
    If you think enough time has passed that your buffs may have
    worn off, remind the stupid fighters to let you know when they
    need more.&nbsp; Clerics should constantly watch the life meters
    of other party members and cast heal if they get below &frac12;.&nbsp;
    If you have a decent attack ability, when you aren't healing
    or supporting, step in and take a few whacks now and then.&nbsp;
    Just make sure you don't do so much damage that the monster turns
    on you instead of the fighter.&nbsp; Also, remember that you
    can do more damage to the rear of a monster.&nbsp; You should
    also keep and eye out for incoming monsters.&nbsp; As soon as
    you see another approaching, yell out to your group.</B></P>
    <P><B>g.&nbsp;&nbsp; Attack Magic.&nbsp; Stand back patiently
    while the battle begins.&nbsp; If you want to, go ahead and carefully
    step in and take a few whacks at the monster.&nbsp; Keep and
    eye on the life meters of the fighters and if they are getting
    worse than they give, help out by blasting the monster a few
    times.&nbsp; You don't want to attack too soon, since monsters
    have an annoying habit of going after the person doing the most
    damage, and you don't want it to focus on you.&nbsp; While it
    can be amusing to see a magic user running around in circles
    being chased by a monster while the rest of the party tries to
    hack at it, it is also self defeating (and usually bad for the
    health of the magic user).&nbsp; As soon as the monster takes
    off, cast root to stop it, or if it is really low on hit points
    just blast it down.&nbsp; You should also keep and eye out for
    incoming monsters.&nbsp; As soon as you see another approaching,
    yell out to your group</B></P>
    <P><B>h.&nbsp;&nbsp; Except for wizards and fighters, most classes
    can cross over to some extent to these three main areas.&nbsp;
    Assign out the main roles, but don't be afraid to vary if the
    fight is going badly.</B></P>
    <P><B>i.&nbsp; When someone yells run, don't hesitate to run
    to safety (hopefully you have already made note of where the
    nearest safe spot is).&nbsp; You know at least one of your party
    is no longer fighting with you, and your chances of not dying
    have dropped considerably.&nbsp; Besides, if you're playing with
    a good group, there's probably a good reason someone yelled run.&nbsp;
    Get out of there now.</B></P>

      <P><A NAME="AllaKhazam's Warrior Group Strategies"></A><B>1)&nbsp;
      Warrior.&nbsp; This is easy.&nbsp; Attack.&nbsp; Attack.&nbsp;
      Attack.&nbsp; Also, protect your spell casters.&nbsp; You should
      be the one who runs out and initiates the combat whenever possible.&nbsp;
      That way you are the one the monster focuses on from the start.&nbsp;
      Use your taunt whenever the monster decides to go after one of
      those weak mage types.&nbsp; Don't forget to use your combat
      skills.&nbsp; If your hit points are getting low, back away and
      let someone else take some damage, even a spell caster.&nbsp;
      Dying doesn't help your group any.&nbsp; Fighters of all types
      are good group leaders since they are the ones who initiate combat
      most of the time.</B></P>
      <P><A NAME="AllaKhazam's Paladin Group Strategies"></A><B>2)&nbsp;
      Paladin.&nbsp; Same as warrior for the most part, but you also
      have the ability to buff ahead of time to make the party stronger
      and heal al little after the battle.&nbsp; Save your lay hands
      for the most desperate situation.&nbsp; If someone in your group
      is about to go down, use lay hands.&nbsp; Better to lose it in
      a day than waste it.</B></P>
      <P><A NAME="AllaKhazam's Ranger Group Strategies"></A><B>3)&nbsp;
      Ranger.&nbsp; Same as warrior as far as the tank abilities.&nbsp;
      In addition, because of your tracking skill, you will probably
      be the leader when outdoors.&nbsp; Track a monster that the group
      can handle and lead it back to the group to be disposed of.&nbsp;
      Or if you prefer, track the monster and lead the group to it.&nbsp;
      If you are doing this, you should change your views so that you
      can see behind you and can be sure that everyone is actually
      following you.&nbsp; Also, keep and eye out for killer monsters
      and warn your group if they are in the area.</B></P>
      <P><A NAME="AllaKhazam's Monk Group Strategies"></A><B>4)&nbsp;
      Monk.&nbsp; Same as warrior in most respects.&nbsp; Use your
      feign death skill.&nbsp; If the group is in trouble, you should
      be the one to buy time for the rest of the party since you can
      use feign death to convince the monsters you are dead and maybe
      help the entire party survive.</B></P>
      <P><A NAME="AllaKhazam's Shadow Warrior Group Strategies"></A><B>5)&nbsp;
      Shadow Knight.&nbsp; For the most part, you are a dark warrior.&nbsp;
      However, do</B> <BR>
      <B>not forget the necromancer in you.&nbsp; Blast with a dot
      spell first then attack.. attack.. attack.. At a lower level
      (1 - 10), you have no business grouping, unless you just want
      to socialize.&nbsp; Your first dot spell comes at level 14.&nbsp;
      Treat your pet as a dot, not a tank.&nbsp; He will always be
      half your level.&nbsp; Keep the mob away from the casters and
      healers and use your harm touch whenever you feel necessary.&nbsp;
      Remember harm touch work best when mob is not attacking you.&nbsp;
      Just like Paladins use their Lay Hand to heal a group member
      to full when in trouble, use your Harm Touch to kill a mob who
      is about to kill a group member, not just for yourself.&nbsp;
      Harm Touch will come back in 24 eq hours, but the friends you
      meet may not.</B></P>
      <P><A NAME="AllaKhazam's Rogue Group Strategies"></A><B>6)&nbsp;
      Rogue.&nbsp; Unless you don't have a tank, you don't want to
      be the focus of the monster's attention.&nbsp; Instead let the
      fighter type get its attention and get behind it and backstab.&nbsp;
      Keep backstabbing.&nbsp; This is a great skill for grouping.&nbsp;
      Also, if you have the time, you might as well pick the monster's
      pocket for some extra cash.&nbsp; If you are in a situation where
      nobody in the party knows what's ahead, use your sneak skill
      to scout the area.</B></P>

      Cleric.&nbsp; You are not a tank.&nbsp; Everyone is relying on
      you to keep them alive.&nbsp; This is a big responsibility.&nbsp;
      Watch your party members' life meters and heal anyone who starts
      to get below half.&nbsp; When healing is not needed either step
      in and take a few whacks or stay back and keep and eye out for
      any new creatures so that you can warn your party.&nbsp; Prior
      to the battle, you should buff up the party to keep them strong.&nbsp;
      Also, don't forget lull if you are planning on attacking a group
      of monsters.&nbsp; Don't waste your mana.&nbsp; Your heal spells
      may be the only thing standing between the party and disaster.&nbsp;
      The ideal strategy for a group with 2 tanks and a cleric is for
      the tanks to alternate attacks, with one attacking and the other
      standing back getting healed.&nbsp; This way you can keep a full
      strength fighter on the monster at all times.</B></P>
      <P><A NAME="AllaKhazam's Shaman Group Strategies"></A><B>8)&nbsp;
      Shaman.&nbsp; Your strategy varies a lot depending upon the makeup
      of the group you are in.&nbsp; First off, cast SOW on every group
      member.&nbsp; It is the best spell in the game and will save
      your party's lives many times.&nbsp; If you have a lot of firepower
      up front, stand back and heal when needed (like a cleric), balst
      a little and make sure your fighters are buffed and ready to
      fight.&nbsp; If they get in trouble, wade in and start bashing
      or cast damage spells.&nbsp; You can dish out some decent damage.</B></P>
      <P><A NAME="AllaKhazam's Druid Group Strategies"></A><B>9)&nbsp;
      Druid. The druid's strategy really depends upon the makeup of
      the group.&nbsp; One thing you should always do is cast SOW on
      every group member.&nbsp; That alone gives your party a beter
      chance of surviving an encounter.&nbsp; You are probably the
      travel guide for the group because of your travel spells.&nbsp;
      Prior to the battle, keep the fighters buffed.&nbsp; Once a battle
      starts, cast your damage shields on the fighters so that they
      can start hurting the monsters back when they get attacked.&nbsp;
      Then your actions depend on your role.&nbsp; If you are the parties
      only healer, try to save your mana for heal spells and play it
      much like a cleric.&nbsp; If you are filling in on the wizard
      role, then by all means strike down the runners.&nbsp; Ideally,
      given time to meditate, you can buff the party before combat,
      destroy creatures during it, and heal everyone afterwards.&nbsp;

      <P><A NAME="AllaKhazam's Bard Group Strategies"></A><B>10)&nbsp;
      Bard.&nbsp; While not the greatest tank, you can certainly play
      that role.&nbsp; But you are more than that.&nbsp; Like a cleric,
      you should always watch your party's life meters.&nbsp; If everyone
      is high, either play a buff song, battle song or damage song.&nbsp;
      It really depends on what you're attacking and how you are doing.&nbsp;
      As soon as people start to drop, play the heal song.&nbsp; You
      are crucial to the groups survival, since as long as you are
      alive the group can outrun any monster.&nbsp; If the party looks
      like it is in trouble, switch to the accelerando and tell the
      party which way they should run.&nbsp; If you can keep the party
      together, you should be able to help them survive by running
      away faster than the monster can pursue.</B></P>
      <P><A NAME="AllaKhazam's Magician Group Strategies"></A><B>11)&nbsp;
      Magician.&nbsp; Let your pet do all the work for you.&nbsp; Don't
      even look for a group unless you have plenty of Malachite to
      summon pets.&nbsp; A magician without a pet is really just a
      weak wizard, and not very much help to a group.&nbsp; Remember
      that his death means nothing, and a group members means everything.&nbsp;
      Send him into the hardest places.&nbsp; Support him with spells,
      but don't let your mana lag too far behind.&nbsp; How you do
      this depends upon whether you are the only spell damage dealer
      in the group.&nbsp; You are also the group's provisioner, especially
      at low levels.&nbsp; Volunteer to stock up your group members
      with food and water.&nbsp; It doesn't cost you anything other
      than mana.&nbsp; This will make you very popular, since at lower
      levels those items cost enough money to get really annoying,
      and it's a real pain to have to go back to town just to buy more
      bread.&nbsp; Many people don't realize you can summon food and
      won't ask, so be sure to volunteer it to the group.</B></P>
      <P><A NAME="AllaKhazam's Necromancer Group Strategies"></A><B>12)&nbsp;
      Necromancer.&nbsp; Let the skeleton do the nasty work.&nbsp;
      Since your spells tend to do damage over time, if you plan on
      casting them, cast them early.&nbsp; It might be a good idea
      to cast and then immediately sit and meditate.&nbsp; You can
      never have enough mana.The necro pet is usually 1 level below
      the level of the necro. At 20th and up they have magic attacks,
      dual wield and riposte.&nbsp; The pets can be buffed and with
      the bareknuckle delay are a very good addition to a group.&nbsp;
      Necros are particularly good group members if you are fighting
      a large crit.&nbsp; Their damage over time spells at 20 will
      reach over 800 when combined and at 29th well over 1000.&nbsp;
      Combine this with the pet damage and the 95 + DD spell against
      undead and 65+ DD against live creatures and you have a damage
      dealing partner.&nbsp; Necros are also good paired.&nbsp; They
      work very well with a druid.&nbsp; One warning sent to me:&nbsp;
      When grouped with 4 or less the group needs to treat the pet
      as a player in terms of making sure damage is shared.&nbsp; The
      reason for this is (unless you are fighting blues or yellows
      in which case why be grouped ) the damage over time spells will
      direct the creature to the necro or another party member like
      the wiz if the pet dies.&nbsp; I have seen many times in smaller
      groups...pet dies group flees and dies.&nbsp; Now this is not
      to say that the pet should not die first if necessary, it definitely
      should, BUT the crit being attacked should at least be at a level
      of health that the group can finish off with a surety.</B></P>
      <P><A NAME="AllaKhazam's Enchanter Group Strategies"></A><B>13)&nbsp;
      Enchanter.&nbsp; Keep your party buffed at all times.&nbsp; Before
      the battle starts debuff the tougher monsters to make them easier
      to kill.&nbsp; One of the better spells of the enchanter is lull.&nbsp;
      If you are thinking of attacking a group of monsters, but not
      sure you can take the entire group, lull the ones you want to
      stay back and pick them off one at a time.&nbsp; With an enchanter,
      a group can take on some of the camps and survive.&nbsp; Then
      you need to assess the balance of your group and whether you
      need to blast or let your pet do the work.&nbsp; If the battle
      is going well, there is no reason not to step in and attack with
      your dagger or staff.</B></P>
      <P><A NAME="AllaKhazam's Wizard Group Strategies"></A><B>14)&nbsp;
      Wizard.&nbsp; Conserve your mana.&nbsp; Let the fighters start
      a battle and sit back and watch.&nbsp; You don't want to attack
      too soon and have the monster focus on you instead of the tank.&nbsp;
      Part of the way into the battle, you can go in and start to hit
      the monster for the little bit of damage you can do.&nbsp; It
      won't faze the monster so you are safe.&nbsp; If the fighters
      start to fade a little, blast the monster with a few spells.&nbsp;
      If it gets low, you can finish it off.&nbsp; If the battle starts
      to get desperate, blast it with all you have.&nbsp; You are the
      last resort in that case.&nbsp; If it starts to run cast root
      to stop it in its tracks or just blast it down.&nbsp; Always
      keep an eye out for incoming monsters so that you can warn your
      fighters.&nbsp; Remember you can regenerate mana about 3 times
      faster than the fighters can regen hit points, so once the party
      sits you want to have times it so that you need as much sitting
      time as the fighters.</B></P>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><B>a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule number one of soloing is to not do
    it (at least after the first 10 or so levels).</B></P>
    <P><B>b.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to solo, this is my suggestion.&nbsp;
    Find a place where there is either a zone barrier or a guard
    tower and a where you can find a number of monsters who con blue.&nbsp;
    Keep within easy running distance of safety and look for monsters
    you can handle.&nbsp; Like a deer hunter, you may find a lot
    of your time spent sitting around waiting for your prey.&nbsp;
    Change your view so that you can see if anything is sneaking
    up behind you and attack anything that cons blue (you'll quickly
    learn what you can beat).&nbsp; Unless you are completely absolutely
    convinced you are one or two strikes away from killing it, if
    your meter gets below 1/2, turn and run to safety.&nbsp; If anything
    other than the monster you are attacking starts your way, turn
    and run for safety.&nbsp; If your mana gets below 1/3, turn and
    run for safety.&nbsp; Learn to be a coward and you may actually
    live a while.&nbsp; Keep in mind that if your place of safety
    is a guard tower, you may get hit once or twice before the guards
    manage to kill the intruder, so you should run even sooner.&nbsp;
    Those who solo spend a lot of their time sitting and healing
    or meditating.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
