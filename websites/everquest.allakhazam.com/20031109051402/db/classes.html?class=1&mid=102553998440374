Sometimes taunt comes from speed...sometimes it comes from damage...don't let anyone tell you that one ALWAYS beats the other, but usually speed is better. In your teens and early twenties, use a fast weapon in offhand to work on the slow-raising dual wield and double attack...then reverse it to prepare for the damage bonus and increased need for taunt that start to show up in your late twenties. Damage bonus on one-handed weapons is calculated as:<br><br>DB = (level-25)/3<br><br>So your damage bonus at level 49 is<br><br>(49-25)/3 = 8<br><br>Two-handed weapons get much more complicated, and you won't need to use them as much, so I'll skip that discussion here. Remember to do all calculations in parentheses first. By 40ish, having a very fast weapon in your main hand will be very important...stop using that Wurmslayer or Centi Longsword. CLS in offhand is okay, but remember that the people who say ratio is all that matters in offhand are mistaken...speed there helps taunt almost as much as it does in main hand. Jade Mace is a good choice in main hand at this level...consider a Fungus Encrusted Hammer, Viik's Dark Defender, Lamentation, or Venom Axe in offhand. Don't let anybody tell you a Lammy does more damage than a Jade Mace...they're completely mad. A Jmace in main hand will outdamage a Lammy by over 5% at level 60, along with greater taunt from the speed...that's after adjusting for the paltry +6str from the Lammy. Remember, though, a Lammy is lighter and adds HP...it's kinda a tossup.<br><br>Haste is your buddy. Few weapon changes are going to add over 20% to your damage output (and taunt! don't forget taunt!) like most haste items will. If you're ~35+ and don't have a haste item, get one. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that AC and stats in one slot are going to be better for you than haste...AC is only worthwhile if you're getting hit, and a ~35+ warrior with no haste is far from maximizing his/her potential. Be careful about listening to haste percentages, because many people don't know what they are talking about. Also, there are two different ways of calculating haste...the most common one is by increase in total number of attacks. That is, if you have a FBSS equipped, you'll do about 21% more damage over time. This does not mean your weapons will be 21% faster! Some people do talk about haste in terms of lower delay, mostly because it's easier to calculate it that way...but it's not the generally accepted way, so there's no real point in using it. It just confuses people with the different numbers and leads to endless arguments.<br><br>Work on all your weapon skills, even Hand to Hand. You never know when you're going to have a use for them, and being able to use a giant hammer as well as a dagger is good for the confidence level. Nobody likes passing up a good deal because it'd take you a year to learn the skill because you didn't work on it from the beginning.<br><br>Procs are just plain complicated. They are nice and helpful, but you can't depend on them for taunt and such, unless you have a shaman giving you 200+ dexterity. Most worthwhile proc weapons don't pop until 50+, and most of them end up being fairly slow for a warrior of that level to use...again, unless you have massive dexterity to make them proc enough to overcome that problem. Another problem with procs is that they can be partially or fully resisted, just like regular spells. If you're fighting mostly yellows and reds, your procs aren't going to do much damage...however, remember that the taunt from any spell is fully applied, even if the target resists. So...if you're using a weapon for a taunt proc (like slow perhaps) and it keeps getting resisted, don't think that makes the weapon worthless. The main kinds of procs in approximate descending order of taunt value are slow, debuff, snare, stun, dot, lifetap, and dd. I haven't noticed self-buff procs to ever create any taunt, personally.<br><br>Soloing: it can be done if you follow a few guidelines. You'd better have a troll or iksar unless you like sitting on your buttocks. I'd also strongly suggest getting some kind of regen item when you can...Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate is the cheapest, usually called Iksar regen bp or some variation thereof. Bind wound is your friend- keep your skill up, and keep plenty of bandages on hand, especially when far from home. Don't try to work on raising neglected weapon skills while soloing. Always know where the nearest zone is. Pull from a distance...try to keep sow on...pull to a safe place, preferably along a zone wall. An add is likely to mess up your day. When soloing, forget taunt and go straight for maximum damage...when soloing, the damage output of your weapons far exceeds any stats, AC, HP, etc. that they might have. The reason for this is that the mob is beating on you as long as it's alive and not running...beating it down faster means you take less damage, and a weapon would have to have some monstrous AC to make up for even a small deficiency in damage output. Soloing effectively ~40+ is very difficult, because it generally requires specialized and expensive gear, such as a Fungus Covered Scale Tunic (regen), Rune Blade (procs a damage absorber), Truncheon of Doom (procs slow at 50), etc. The damage and HP of mobs at this level are so high that you're just overmatched in a slugfest. Soloing a warrior 50+ is virtually impossible.<br><br>When buying or trading for gear, go for maximum efficiency. Weapons are more important than armor...they determine 95% of your damage and taunt. Don't spend half your money on a nice +10str bracer when what you really need is to save for a better 1hs or a haste item. Also, you'll usually want to keep your money spread out...you often get better results from buying several items than from buying one nice item (again, unless it's a weapon). Before buying, be absolutely sure that you can equip the item you want...if it has a proc or click effect, find out for sure what level you need to be to use it. Remember that any unneeded value in your bag is lost efficency. For example, if you have a 30/40 2hs weapon that's worth 2k, sell it buy a Sarnak Battlehammer (warrior only 2hb), which has the same stats but is much cheaper. Then you can use the saved money for an armor upgrade or whatever. Just by using an unpopular weapon skill (you did keep your 2hb up like I told you, right?), you've saved yourself 1.5k or more, while getting the same combat performance. Then buy a BABS or something fairly cheap to keep your 2hs up, and put the extra into a needed slot, like perhaps that nice bracer ^_^ \/<br><br>There is no such thing as a set DPS. If somebody just flat says &quot;the ratio on Hammer of Breaking Stuff is 10/30, so your DPS is 10&quot;, they're mistaken. Same for talking about an &quot;average hit&quot;. These things are affected by your level, damage bonus, haste, weapon skill, strength, which hand the weapon is in, etc. As these things go up, so does your DPS or average hit. Talking about them out of context is just going to spread false info and confuse people.

I'll post more some other time.

So saying having an FBSS equipped gives you an approximate 21% more damage over time is total rubbish.&nbsp;&nbsp;You attack 21% more over time than you would without it.<br><br>You are also way out on proc's.  I agree you can't depend on them to a certain extent.  However, there are a large number of weapons that proc before 50 that are sheer brilliance in terms of agro.  Moreover, resists often cause more agro than the proc landing successfully (talk to casters about agro when some of their spells are resisted - same deal).  Your ordering of proc values is debatable also, but not by much so no biggie.  And getting your dex up high to help increase proc rate isn't as difficult as some people say. (talking from experience here)<br><br>You're also incorrect in stating that weapons are the most important piece of gear.  Sometimes they are, but not always (not even usually).  Pieces of equipment have varying degrees of importance depending upon the role of the tank.  See other posts for different tank roles.<br><br>I agree with you on the dps/average damage thing but for *general comparison* of the relative value of different weapons, ratio and damage are good indicators.  (btw, if you're interested I have a log file parser that will tell you your actual melee dps vs each creature you fought during the time you were logging)<br><br>Nice post otherwise - very much agree with keeping all weapon (and other) skills maxed</p>&nbsp;<br>"...come back here ya coward!

Damage = Taunt. Plane and simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when the damage being done by two different tanks is almost equil does the number of touches come into play.  Yes both damage and number of touches are factors in determaining who holds agro (and there are others) but damage is the major factor.  If this is not the case please explane how a wiz gets agro after touching the mob only once?  Also explane why a poision base dot will pull agro when a sickness base dot will not.  They both do damage to the mob at the same time intervel.  The only differance being the one dose considerable more damage each &quot;touch&quot;<br><br>2. DPS and Avg Hits.<br>DPS and avg hits are as real as raito.  They are methoods of compairing two diffrent weapons or sets of weapons.  <br>According to the damage calculator you use, at lvl 40 the JM will do 96% of the damage of a Wurmy.  According to dps calculations the JM will do 93% of the damage of the Wurmy.  A differance of 3%.  So it would appear that well over 90% of the damage you do is a function of the dps of the weapon (with the damage bonus calculated in).  This is more than good enough to use in comparing weapons, and in deciding if you get enough more from a considerd up grade to justify the cost.  <br>Since my dps calculation is based on avg hits, these too can be used in determaining the weapons relative effectivness.  <br><br>I used the damage calcular you linked to check a number of the statments about differant weapons I have made on this page and elsewhere.  I didn't find one that the damage calcular give a differnt result than my dps calculations.  <br><br>Other than that I thougt your post was very good.</p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

But you yourself acknowledge that more touches generate more agro if the ammount of damage done is aproximately the same. DOT spells generate an inordnant amount of agro for the damage done. Why? Because the damage is applied every second. I'm sure if you had a wizard nuking and a druid using dots doing the same amount of damage over a minuite, the mob would be all over the druid. <br>While the amount of damage done generates a substantial amount more agro than touches, if you can get almost the same amount of damage done but with twice the amount of hits in the same period of time, I'd suggest the greater number of hits. Why? Because if your the main tank, you'll do just about anything to get the extra agro. If all you want is damage output because your not the main tank, well, I'm not talking about you here.<br><br>Oh, and the one thing alot of people seem to be neglecting in their advice: while weapons are all your flash and bang, just weapons alone do not make the warrior. AC is king! Before stats and/or bonus hit points, go for higher AC. At least until you manage to get up to 1100 AC. Higher AC means less damage per hit wich means that the healer dosen't waste as much mana healing which means everyone keeps killing and not dying. It's much better for something to die faster than getting hit for less, but let's face facts: your going to get hit. Most people consider that your job. And if your AC sucks for your level YOU suck. Spend some time and try to hunt for your armor as much as possible (you'll probably want to save the cash for better weapons, good weapons are generaly cheeper than armor of the same caliber, easier to find for sale, and you need to fill 13 slots with armor, as opposed to 2 slots for weapons, and a range slot that could go either way.). At lower levels it's not that hard to find decent armor for sale at cheep prices IF you head to the right zones (i.e. where it drops, and where those people go to sell the stuff to merchants). After bronze armor though, unless your making a twink your looking at getting armor from drops and trades. <br><br>Hope this makes some sense,</p>&nbsp;<br>Meirril, Fennin Ro</td></td></tr>
