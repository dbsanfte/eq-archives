I expect to lose a few pieces but hopefully not before I take my share (hopefully more).  <br><br>Now I have decided next subject to work on is Magic Resistance (MR) currently at 40 with no drop stuff.  Got 2 goblin bracers +5 MR each and a SplitPaw Hide Mask +5 MR totalling out 40.  This still isnt enough I need higher.  <br><br>What are suggestions for Magic Resistance (preferrably no drop but dont have to be)?  Alt is 29 rogue so i can get a little stuff but not sure whats little.  Any and all suggestions wanted and needed PLEASE!!!</p>&nbsp;<br></td></td></tr>

In reality Lunatic and I will never agree on the issue of what makes the best tank.  I understand his points, I just think that his tanking theories fit with Warriors in Boss MOB situations but don't fit into the smaller pick-up groups fighting under lvl 50 MOBs.<br><br>Lunatic focus' on the CHeal and on fights requiring alot of them when he talks about needing tons of HP's to tank.  I grew up fighting with few Clerics and mostly Druids and Shaman healing me.  I was so bad in an old Guild I was in I made a PLed a Cleric to 46 so he could support the Guild on Raids.  I have learned to maximize my value while reducing the use of the healer's mana as much as possible.  It only works in some zones, I spent 6 hours at 4 spawn in Velks with me a Necro and a Chanter one day.  We had no healer at all (well Necro's heal a little) and I was Tanking, not the pet, and we all lived.  I will contend a Warrior couldn't have done that, HPs made no difference at all that day.<br><br>But Luantic has some good points, I listen to what he posts too.  Just decide which one of us is saying things that work for you each time we disagree and listen to that advice for that question.<br><br>As to Dervs, I hated them, they hit to fast to cast around.  If you can fear them they drop fast, but once they start hitting you you have to get out of range and re-fear to live.  Tanking Dervs is a no-win situation, even at lvl 50 they hurt.  For Eastern Wastes there are 2 places to solo.  First is by the bridge, pull Kodiaks and Cougars there and fear them along the base.  The other place is Ulthorks along the Norther cliff.  Find the tree next to the spawn location and park pet there.  Pull anything blue to the tree, darkness and fear, they run right towards the Drawf Cooks hut so no adds once they get feared.  I did the bridge at 32-25, 35-40 was Ulthorks.<br><br>Neptunis</p>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 62 DE Gravelord<br>Have Axe, will travel</td></td></tr>

Please share. <br><br>I was using a 14/36 2hs before 20(for the lower dly) but had saved some money to buy a dark reaver from a guildmate. The second I dinged 20 I equiped the Reaver. Wiht 95str I constantly hit for the 40s. Big upgread from 29dmg... I would bet you have an Argent defender 33/49. Wiht 180str I would also bet you'll hit for the 60s lower 70s. I was soloing the giant fort in WW since lvl 22s new spells(AWESOME EXP Ill get into that later) Once I scored my 25th lvl I noticed I would hit for the upper 50s! Usually about 49 though.&nbsp;&nbsp;So at 25 I would say yer hitting for the 80s maybe 90s wiht your strength. Thats what I hit for at 37 with 123str.(LOL)<br><br><br>I would go to OT at your level. Make your way to the WW zone and pull MOBs to it. If you get in a jam just zone. This zone is exelent for soloing. As a newbie I did not know how to Fear kite so I just Tanked and lifetaped the mobs. I would usually coem out wiht 3/4 my life left. Med to 2 bubbles of mana and pull. Wiht gose pretty quick. It's safer to fear kite however, but requires the same downtime for mana. <br><br>At 22 move to WW Giant fort. Pull the Forest Giant Greens.(think thats it) Remeber to con here lvls vary quite a bit. Also kill low lvl Evergreens. I recomend camping the eastside by Cabilis. You can pull to the empty spot inbetween the two buildings. You can tank/tap or safer and can kill Yellow evergreens by fear kiting.  Pull them with Clinging darkness(CD). This uses less mana and rarely is resisted.(engulfing(ED) for evergreens)  Pull across bridge to road on east side of fort. By then the Giant should be at the door stand o nthe thrid lump in the road and wait to cast fear until they are wihtin range. The giant contunes to run and by the time fear is done casting the giant hits the dirt rode and keeps following it. Whack at it and recast fear/CD(ED) this is very safe And I never died all 9 Levels I was there! This requires a lot of mana downtime at 22 but at about 26 you can get away with having hardly any mana. Tank/tap worked for me but its highly unsafe if you don't have sow. I ran to cab for saftey by zoneing. But ogres looks like yer SOL or just run to OT tho is a little far. I fought here til  31 Killing everything Frest greens stop giving exp about 29 so you will have to kill em to get evergreens.<br><br>When now that my first book is written Ill continue to lvl and give out my words of wisdom/acid trip.<br><br>Islude-&quot;From the south. Heh, the deep south.&quot;<br></p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

(can't use disease cloud anymore). but if you debuff each mob with scream of hate, scream of pain, siphon str. and despair. they will not like you much. usually a couple taunts will get them right on you. if not, hit them with darkness too. very mana intensive i know =( , but if you have to get one off a caster, this will usually work.<br><br>what did you kill the make yourself so liked by wood elves so quickly??<br><br>from 18 - 25 hunting. go to highhold pass right now. for the first few lvls 18 - 20. fight in an orc group near the kithicor zone. you will get great xp and raise your weapon skills. after a few lvls you will no longer be KOS to guards in high keep hold so you can bank and sell.<br><br>once you are 20 move into nearby high pass hold. get first in a goblin lookout group (first room) this is a good xp all the way to 25 when you may be able to get into a goblin warrior room camp - good xp all the way to 30. goblin camps usually require waiting but are worth it - bank in the zone, great xp, nice bronze and ringmail drops that sell well, good way to raise weapon skills.<br><br>only drawback is you will see ninja looting and you will often wait.<br><br>i'm not high enough lvl to know about planar stuff, sorry =)<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue May 28 12:47:18 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE I MADE. transfer the completed piece to a friend and turn in prices to finish. only exception to this is the bracer.<br><br>3. pieces are multi-questable. i've done several of them with partners. make sure person who wants piece turns in final pieces to knight and that you are in a group when you do it.<br><br>4. MAKE SURE TO HAIL THE KNIGHT AND FIGURE OUT WHAT PIECES HE MAKES. don't make the mistake of turning in pieces to the wrong knight. if you go through the prompts each one will tell you what pieces he does. REDO THIS EVERYTIME YOU VISIT THEM THEY CAN CHANGE POSITIONS. dont' assume the knight on the left always does such and the knight on the right others. i've even seen times when only one knight was up. take the time to go through the chat and make sure. these pieces are hard to get.<br><br>5. find a druid or bard to help you out. they can track (maybe rangers too - dunno) and this is real helpful to know when crusaders are up.<br><br>6. SPEND TIME IN FEEROOT. even if you are not in a group. hang out in feeroot and try and find one. also i got one or two pieces from people killing crusaders and shouting decayed such and such on corpse. talk to high lvls in the area, they can help out by say single pulling a crusader off the top of a temple for you so you can fight it. most people are helpful if you are friendly. you can always solo certain lizards even in the low 30's and get xp. if you want to complete a set you need to spend time in feeroot. the groups will come. not as easy as OT or highkeep but possible.<br><br>if you have any specific questions as you go along, post here. i check in regularly and would love to help out a fellow knight.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue May 28 12:08:12 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

So one hard day of labor in FV, I found myself running through LOIO. I though. &quot;hmmm lets go the the gobbie mines and test these new resistances out!&quot; I stormed in like a barrel of monkeys. Killed several warriors and got the the wichdoctors and casters and was ready to test out my new resistances. I expected to get poisoned as usual. But that I'd resist all the other spells: Spirit strike, burst of flame, drowsy ect. And... I was very disappointed! here I am about ten levels over most of these guys and only one spell was resisted!(drowsy) <br><br>Anyway I don't know whats up and if this new resistance gear is worth it or not. Help me out wht your guys/gals experiences. Thanks <br><br>Islude-&quot;From the south. Heh, the deep south.&quot;<br></p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

Even at 100 you will still not resist all spells of a type, and even at 200 you will still get hit by spells sometimes.  Remember that the Caster's level is also a factor, so while you will probably now resist most spells from green stuff, anything red to you will land their spells most times even with 100 resist.<br><br>Keep collecting the resistance gear.  At lvl 45 or so you'll want 150 sv magic and cold if you want to fight Vox, and Magic and Fire if you fight Naggy.  Even then you'll get hit with fears and their AE spells.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 55 DE Revenant</p>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 62 DE Gravelord<br>Have Axe, will travel</td></td></tr>

I believe that Verant, however, wants to make this game balanced, as fair as possible to all classes, and promotes grouping as much as possible, so I was thinking of the following steps to make SKs more desirable in groups (note that you must read ALL of the steps--you stop after the first, you will think I am smoking something...):<br><br>1)  Nerf the ratios of SK weapons.  That's right.  Tune them way down--like to the WAR level.  Ebon, MoSS, Shard of Night, whatever---lower the ratios something fierce so that even a WAR could wield them without substantially improving the damage output of a WAR.  This will serve two functions.  Firstly, it will LOWER the damage output of SKs &amp; 2) it would allow Verant to grant WAR the ability to wield ALL weapons (i.e. rid the game of the incredibly stupid logic that doesn't allow WAR to wield (substantially) ALL WEAPONS.  Clearly, this is secondary, but Im sure that it could be worked in somehow).  Additionally, it will also LOWER the damage output of an SK.<br><br>2)  Pump up an SKs HP per STA to more of a WAR level.  Im not saying make it equal, just close the gap substantially.  Its really silly to have a SK &amp; a PLD not be able to take a similar beating that a WAR can.  They are such similar classes that it doesnt really make sense to have that large of a gap.  It wasnt that way back in the original days of D&amp;D &amp; it shouldnt be here now...<br><br>3) To make up for the loss in damage per second, &amp; this is perhaps the hardest part, lower the level at which SKs get certain NEC spells.  For instance, rather than get Boil Blood at 53, say perhaps, SKs get it at 49 or something.  The earlier that SKs get better spells (particulariy damage spells), the higher the damage output of the SK.  Clearly, this part would really have to be sat down and some good thought put into it, but, at the end of the day, what we are trying to do is pattern the SK after the WAR &amp; (substantially) match the damage output of an SK vs a WAR.  They should be close.  <br><br>So, when all is said and done, SKs would be (in theory), no stronger (overall) than a WAR currently is now (save that I would suggest a change so that WAR could wield most weapons---no more silly restrictions).<br><br>A WAR would be all melee, no-frills, stand-in-your-face tough guy; would not require spells to buff himself, etc.  Just kick-your-arse tough guy.  <br><br>An SK would be able to take a similar beating, but would have to (generally) require the use of spells to produce the same damage output.<br><br>That would make a lot more sense to me, as well as increase the desirability of SKs in groups as well.  The change wouldnt have a dramatic impact on the game at all, as (in theory) what you have taken away, you have added elsewhere.<br><br>Im not sure if I have missed something--the answer is probably.  At the end of the day, however, I find it more and more frustrating that SKs (&amp; PLD) for that matter, can't take a similar beating as a WAR, which does NOT help promote equal grouping opportunities.<br><br>Anyone else think that something related to this is reasonable or am I just high &amp; people are happy with the way it is??<br><br>Lunatic</p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

I am a level 60 shadowknight, raid buffed I'm at 4800 hp's and 1300ac, my guild does the planes of course and I've done both regular ToV and NtoV. I play on a (Rathe)r old server and my guild is in no way &quot;uber&quot; or part of the top guilds there. I look at this from the end results point of view since that is the capacity it will affect me in. Everyone and their mother seems to have an sk twink, I have always played my sk as my main character and will continue to do so.<br><br>The original poster brings up a few suggestions to increase the want for sk's in exp groups. By lowering the ratio on sk weapons, increasing the hp return for our sta and giving us higher level necro spells earlier on you would produce a tank that can take close to the same amount of beating as a warrior but focuses more on spells to deal damage then melee and that groups would find more desirable.<br><br>First off I disagree with the preposition on which this whole change would be based. I used to feel that there were less demand for shadowknights in groups but through experience I've changed my view on this gradually. Intelligent and experienced players are aware of a few basic facts: sk's don't deal the same amount of damage as a warrior. You can think that with spells you can both equate and surpass a warrior damage wise but this is simply not true. The point of an exp group is for mobs to die fast. At 60 I have access to Asystole, a 690dmg dot over 60 seconds, stack this with Boil Blood (504 over 70 or 80 secs) and you'll achieve 500 to 600 dot damage before the mob is dead. This isn't even close to what the warriors outdamage you with. Admittedly, among my friends I count two of the best equipped warriors on the server but I believe I'm not lagging that far behind them quality-of-equipment-wise with my Darkmetal Falchion (27dmg, 29del), I'd say I'm a step below them on the ladder since weapons better then this generally drop in very highlevel raid zones.<br><br>So, a group in need of a tank will choose a warrior if they are lacking in damage and either an sk or a warrior if they have a monk or rogue in group already. Some people prefer the sk alternative because of the much vaunted taunting ability but there it is. Rather then a group preferring a certain class always it depends on what the current composition of a group is like. On the other hand, a group without a puller might enlist the sk for this purpose instead of tanking. So you have two openings you can fill. There are actually three, I often group with several tanks and then I focus on protecting chanters and shamans instead of taking damage since the warrior simply isn't as good at that.<br><br>On to the changes. I could get used to the idea of placing more of the sk's damage in the spell department if VI made sure those spells were in line with our mana supply, meaning that the necro spells we get would have to cost significantly less for us then for the necros. As VI so far instead have added a mana penalty that decreases with levels but is always there I don't really see this happening. Why do the spells have to be cheaper? Well already I am severly chanter dependent if it comes to MT'ing in an exp group. Higher level necro spells at the same cost that necros cast them for would mean a VERY oom shadowknight in a very few pulls if without a chanter. Since exp groups are all about fast pulls and fast kills I would thereby be rendered inefficient as a tank if I had to cast spells for the same amount of mana as a necro. Performing the role of a snarer would leave us way behind on the wanted list in favor of a ranger since snaring can be very heavy on the mana. The ranger could deal his damage and do his snares while we would have to sacrifice damage in favor of keeping everything snared.<br><br>Also, all the damage spells that matter for an sk are dots. Personally i don't like dots in exp groups, there are too many things that can go wrong with them. I used to frequent The Hole alot since the exp down there simply outdid all other zones I'd been in and you had to deal with unmezzable golems that could add on you (on a personal note, I think they ruined the Hole in the recent patch to the zone. We went down to see what had changed and my chanter reported all golems as mezzable. It takes the challenge out of it and reduces the zones difficulty substantially in my opinion. They day I as a level 53 tank along with four of my friends all around 55 or so went down and payed Kindle a visit was one of the proudest in EQ so far. Others will now be denied that same sense of accomplishment). There are not many exp zones with the unmezzable factor but a named might start in on your group or an ae mob that needs to be dispatched might show up and the need for changing targets becomes obvious. The dot prevents this. <br><br>From my perspective the changes proposed would actually result in a less desirable shadowknight, a weaker version of the warrior relying so heavily on such a commonly resisted weapon as spells and the presence of an enchanter to be able to function as an MT for an exp group. Higher level mobs will often have a complete immunity to one or all lines of spells but we were talking exp groups here. A necromancer in the group would also disable your damage output by overwriting your dots. All this for the cleric to be able to take an extra 500 hp's with her CH...I simply don't see it. You could solo better for sure but that wasn't what the poster wanted, he wanted sk's more desirable in exp groups.<br><br>Onwards in the thread...the original poster mentions that sk's can tank very well in zones like Seb, Chardok, Velks etc (zones I refer to as exp zones). I don't understand that, that is what you wanted? As for tanking the really big mobs, Neptunis is of course absolutely right. Defensive is the one attribute that makes a warrior MT instead of an sk, simple as that. I have enough ac to be at the point where mobs hit me for the same amount as the warriors and don't trail them that much in hp. However, even with 6 or 7k hp's I would be a smear on the ground if I attempted to tank Lord Vyemm or anything like that. Hell, he rispostes on me for 1k dmg! Defensive is the divider between sk and warrior tanking ability as has already been mentioned here a couple of times by now.<br><br>I like the way sk's are. I like being MT on Hate raids (yes, the second floor also), part of the pull team and sometimes ST. Sk's need an intelligent player? Yes they do, not to time a lifetap so that you survive for the Ch to go through, that could be done by a properly conditioned monkey but to effortlessly switch between all of our different roles. <br>It takes being alert to know when to step in as ST and when the situation is in hand. It takes intelligence to figure out the game mechanics that allow you to pull mobs that would kill you in 3 seconds or to single difficult named mobs in a cluster of guards. It takes an analytic mind to figure out the different ways aggro can work for you and against you. I believe sk's have a &quot;bad&quot; reputation because of the fact that there are so many players not up to the challenge that fail when asked to fill one of these roles.<br><br>However, in one aspect the sk is lacking. We don't have a disc that could be strategically used in a raid environment. Warriors of course have their defensive and damage dealers have their offensive discs. All of them have a short reuse time and can therefore be figured into a fight. Someone suggested decreasing the reuse time on Leechcurse and to this I have to say &quot;please don't VI&quot;. The disc is as I have stated before completely useless, I've tried it in every situation imaginable where it could have benefitted my purpose but alas, it remains the disc I hit if I get jumped by a higher level green at low health. Fighting in a group I've used it once when we were in a tight spot to save the cleric the trouble of healing those two bubs also. It has no strategical value at all. Granted, if I'm on a cr mission and happen upon a green melee type mob I may use it to regain some health and then quickly fd to stay that way. My one wish would be that they made for something in the AA that could have a strategical application. Instead they gave us a horse. And more damn things on the HT timer. I will still be hitting Unholy Aura and HT and thereby using up both discs and HT when I have all of my aa abilities.</p>&nbsp;<br></td></td></tr>

On the most part, i agree with this (and the other) posts. <br><br>I totally disagree with your first step though. Nerfing SK weaps isn't really necessary, as warrior's get dual wield to off-set the SKs higher ratios. Also, if VI let warriors use the MoSS (among others), they would be unstoppable. DWing MoSS and Centi LS or JBoM with a haste item would be too powerful, if there is such a thing. <br><br>All in all, SKs are fine as they are, and the changes you advise would make them alot more powerful than they are currently. They would also make the SK roughly 1/2 war and 1/2 necro, which was never VI's intention in the first place. Good solid arguments over all, but they're not going to happen, and I don't really think they are all that necessary. Not many other classes can group or solo when they want too.<br><br>Sheesh, little long-winded there, just wanted to throw in my 20 cp.<br><br>Neksnappa Bonecrusha<br>29 Troll Warrior<br>The Lords of Nature<br>The Nameless</p>&nbsp;<br></td></td></tr>

Granted, the mana cost might be higher, but who wouldnt welcome a better spell anyways, regardless of mana (in general).<br><br>What you didnt mention, however, is that the ORG SK would gain a HUGE advantage in terms of being able to tank due to his higher STA.  SKs are tanks fellas, lets not forget that.  =)<br><br>Re: lvl 60 vs lvl 1.  I COMPLETELY agree with your assessment.  Far too often people find themselves concerned with what happens at the end rather than considering what is took to get there.  For instance, in the NFL, people seem to think that a bad call at the end of the game has far more reaching effects than they did say, in the 2nd quarter.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  Every play has just as much importance to determine the outcome of a game--time holds no biases.<br><br>This, however, is somewhat different, as the journey to get to lvl 51 is FAR DIFFERENT than the journey getting from 51 to 60.  It probably takes most people more time to get to 60 from 51 than to get to 51 from 1.  Perhaps that is why most people focus on the higher levels than the lower ones.<br><br>Further, it just makes good sense; similar to business planning.  You are always budgeting for the future, always trying to guess &amp; project results &amp; courses of action.  That said, a character should do the same thing--ask yourself what you want to obtain, how you are going to get there, and what is needed to get there.  A great many people will say they want to hit lvl 60 &amp; plan accordingly.  It probably makes sense if you think about it   =)<br><br>Lunatic</p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

We lag behind our parent class significantly in Offensive skills.  If you want to increase the amount of damage a SK or Pally does in a fight, the easiest way is to just adjust our offensive skill cap.<br><br>Second, HP's are of no issue unless you have the AC to protect those HP's.  From what I have read, it seems that the average &quot;high end&quot; SK will have an AC of around 1,100 but the average Warrior of similar level will be around 1,400.  (We can talk about the &quot;Soft AC Cap&quot; if you wish at this point, but let's not if we don't have to.)  This means that the warrior not only will have more HP's than we do, but will be taking less damage everytime they get hit.  Add into this, the warrior's &quot;Defensive disipline&quot; and it would take a lot of tweaking for us to even come close to being able to tank (take damage) as well as warriors.<br><br>As far as spells, I agree with you.  The SK line of spells need to go higher into the Necro's line of spells to increase our damage output.<br><br>I could think of a few other things that would be nice.  Faster refresh time on HT...making the AAXP HTs on a different timers so you could use all of them in an hour instead of just one...a harm shield of some sort...an all-in-one debuff of AC,ATK,and Str....a haste buff/debuff that actually stacks with spells from other classes.  All of these things would be handy...and not unbalancing in my opinion.  However, the point is that I am not expecting anything like this to happen.  Verant is not going to look at hybrid issues until they have completed caster re-balancing and even then I personally don't exspect much change.<br><br>I take it as a personal challange to be a Knight of Fear.  We are what we are.  It is up to the person behind the Shadowknight to be a great player and be able to adapt to whatever situation presents itself.<br><br>Good hunting all...see you in the land of Norrath.<br></p>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></td></tr>

SKs (&amp; PLD) SHOULD be able to tank (PLEASE NOTE THIS...), not necessarily as well as, but much closer to WAR than is currently achievable.<br><br>I'm not saying that what I suggested was the way to go--only that it was an option, clearly amongst a plethora of options.<br><br>To clarify, what I was suggesting was a few changes to the SK class.  However, all changes must be done to keep the class &quot;equal&quot; to all the other classes.<br><br>Hence, take away SK weapon damage capability, yet offset that will much better tanking ability, combined with better spells (to increase damage output), and that wouuld be fine.  The avenues to achieve that, be it higher HP, much higher AC cap--whatever, is immaterial to me.  My only point is that it SHOULD BE DONE.<br><br>It shouldnt take a great player to make an SK tank good, while an average player could make a WAR tank good; that suggests that either 1) the classes are not in balance or 2) SKs tanking ablity is far below what it should be (which is probably the current status)<br><br>SKs, at least at the moment, are generally viewed as just another melee, which really doesn't do anything critical to a group.  As a result, they are not the first class sought after for groups.  I dont know about you, but that is a frustrating element to me.  <br><br>And before anyone gets any wise ideas, I can, as Im sure many others on this board can, play my SK at a very high level, so taht isnt an issue   =)<br><br>Lunatic</p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

I think we're closer than you think on AC though, since alot of the high end individual Armor items are Warrior/SK/Pali already, it's just Warriors usually get first loot rights over us.  Also when you look at AC compare the SK using a shield or at least 25AC.<br><br>I think the fact that SK's and Pali's CAN Tank at the high levels if played very well is exactly what was envisioned for our class.  I don't want it to ba a class anyone can play well, it's listed as a high difficulty character.  I appreciate what my skills and reputation have earned as far as roles within my Guild and in other groupings.  Not every SK is allowed to pull, only those who have proved themselves get to do that.  Not every SK/Pali gets listed in the MA line-up, I respect the 60 Pali in my Guild who's earned that right (usually second or 3rd in assist order) alot more than the Warriors who dispite higher AC/HPs aren't allowed to Main Tank.  As a hybred we have to earn our place in the world, as it should be.  If I wanted an easy life i would have been a Warrior, but I wanted the challenge.<br><br>I too would like to see some more improvements in our class.  The HT timer, offensive caps and discipline timers/duration could all be improved.  I'd also like to see some possibility to use AA points to learn Necro spells we don't have access to now.  If they openned it up at 55 or 59 to use 4 or 5 AA points to be able to cast an improved pet, or a better dot or even improve one of our lifetaps would be something well worth the AA points and let us EARN being better.<br><br>I still say we're ok now, but agree we could be better.

Please note that I am NOT saying that SKs/PLDs can't tank--they can.  SEB, Velks, Skyfire, Chardok, etc.--Ive tanked em all, generally with good results.  In your general XP groups, a SK/PLD can tank just fine.  That isnt my point.  <br><br>The point is that far more often than not, a WAR will be far more efficient than a SK at tanking (pretty much) solely because they can take FAR more damage &amp;, as a result of that, are more apt to get groups than any other melee class &amp; I think that that sucks.  You can't know everybody &amp; when you get into a general pick-up group, the general presumption about our class is, and will remain to be (unless changed), there.  Even in 50s, you will probably STILL hear people saying, NOW ALL WE NEED IS A TANK!!  Granted, I immediately, say, &quot;DUHHH--this person is a moron,&quot; but I shouldnt have to say that....<br><br>Further, I have YET to be on a SINGLE Vindy/Rumbl/Statue/King Tormax raid where an SK or PLD was the MT over other WARs.  If you have, you probably had a WHOLE LOTTA peeps there &amp; took him down VERY FAST because it just isn't the most risk-adverse character to have perform that task (by a material degree).  Why?  Because it is far more efficient to have the WAR stand there &amp; take the punishment.  EVEN if the person is less than highly talented player--it isn't hard to hit the attack button &amp; stand there &amp; pray that the CH rotation works well enough to keep you alive (for the most part).  It has nothing to do with damage output or anything--it's all about taking damage.<br><br>Perhaps that is where the BS notion that SKs/PLDs can't tank came from--high end raids.  I'm not sure.<br><br>What I am sure about is that you (anyone) are fooling yourself big time if you think that a SK or PLD can tank substantially as well as a WAR (all things substantially equal).  Many of the people that play this game are not stupid &amp; they also know that.  Hence, WAR are typically at the front doing their thing, while we are generally viewed as just another melee--a damage producer if you will.  Well, if I wanted that, I would have played a ROG or a RGR to begin with.<br><br>I do, however, very much enjoy playing an SK, but there are some glaring errors, this probably being the biggest by a country mile....<br><br>I am interested, however, in what exactly you mean when you say that an SK can tank &quot;if played very well.&quot;  Please define what &quot;very well&quot; means.  What &amp; the timing of our spells is what Im guessing that you are primarily referring to.  Otherwise, we are just an underpowered WAR.<br><br>To me, tanking is all about taking damage.  You want the MOB on you &amp; you need to be able to take the damage that he's gonna give you.  Now, whatever venue we get there is fine, but, at the end of the day, its ALL ABOUT HP, either having enough to stand there or having the AC to reduce the amount of damage done to you; it makes no difference to me how you get there, but its all about HP.<br><br>That being said, and the fact that the spells are what make SKs harder than WAR, lets take a look at the spells available to an SK at 55 that will aid an SK in tanking (as defined above &amp; primarily the best ones--note that I am NOT focusing on damage--I do NOT recognize that as a primary &quot;TANKING&quot; attribute):<br><br>Shroud of Pain (18 AC tap)<br>Shroud of Death (~50 procing lifetap)<br>Spirit Tap (150 lifetap)<br>Abduction of Strength (indirectly related, as it reduces MOB STR by 25, thereby reducing damage done)<br>Torrent of Hate (35 ATK debuff, again reduces damage done)<br><br>Torrent of Pain (AC tap) is available at 56, as well as a decent skin (about 230pts), but those aren&amp;#8217;t available at 55.<br><br>That&amp;#8217;s substantially it.  In a typical fight, you can generally land AoS, SoP, &amp; ToH really fast &amp; early, so those aren&amp;#8217;t really an issue.  So, from what I can see, you are primarily talking about the timing &amp; use of Spirit Tap as to what makes our class challenging to play/tank as an SK?  If Im wrong, then please do tell.  If Im not, then I am forced to disagree with you&amp;#8212;that spell isn&amp;#8217;t going to save you from much, nor is there a lot of strategy behind using it (ok&amp;#8212;there is a little as far as timing the cast, but that is a skill you learn VERY early as an SK, especially when channeling skill is low).<br><br>Verant needs to wake up &amp; smell the coffee&amp;#8212;SKs &amp; PLDs should be able to tank better than they presently do.  I dont care how they get there&amp;#8212;mine was just a silly example of how to do it.  And yes, if they made the changes I am referring to, the class would STILL be very challenging to play&amp;#8212;PERHAPS even MORESO&amp;#8230;.<br><br>Lunatic<br></p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

Our lifetaps and other spells make up for our lower HP's.  <br><br>I use the lifetaps, debuffs and FD all to either stay alive with agro or dump agro as needed in a group.  I haven't seen the &quot;Big&quot; raids going in with SK's or Pali's as the Main Tank, but I have seen them down the list to take adds or pick up when the Main dies.  Not every Warrior gets to be a Main Tank, in my Guild there are only 4 or 5 Warriors who main Tank, out of a Guild that has over 100 active accounts (not counting multiple characters on the same account).  So the fact that me as an SK isn't going to be asked to Tank Vindi is no big deal, I get asked to tank for XP groups over some of the Warriors.<br><br>So while we don't have the HP's of a Warrior, the big secret is, THAT ISN'T WHY THEY ARE BETTER TANKS!  Warriors are the only ones who Tank Vindi because they have both Defensive Discipline and Auto-Rippost Discipline.  These 2 disciplines are what make them better tanks.  So if you want to really be a Tank, ask for Defensive Discipline, not more HPs.  Give up the Leech Curse Discipline that most of you don't like and ask to get Defensive instead.  That's the ONLY WAY you will ever be asked to Tank Vindi or any of the other big guys.<br><br>The Warriors only goal in life is to be the Meat Shield of these big Raids, I have other skills that I enjoy exploring instead.  <br><br>And yes it is the careful use of lifetaps (all of them) that will keep you alive as a Main Tank when a heal is late or interupted.  We should all know by now that a Cleric heals more with a Complete Heal on a Warrior than they do on CHealing an SK, but that really doesn't matter as they can also get more use out of Celestial Cleansing with us, AND can med during the fight easier as we have better agro control.  Also they save alot of mana spot healing the rest of the group if we are tanking.  So yes a well played SK can tank just not Vindi.<br><br>But again, I'm sorry I even posted here knowing how different our views of the SK Class and HP's are.<br><br>Neptunis</p>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 62 DE Gravelord<br>Have Axe, will travel</td></td></tr>

Just because I defend a viewpoint vigorously doesnt mean that I am being an @#%^ or anything, so please, spare me the &quot;sorry I posted here&quot; bullsh*t &amp; just tell me!!  I want to hear it!!<br><br>If I am wrong, I really want to know.  Let me put it to you another way.  There is a school of thought that says as soon as you think you understand something, you must then try &amp; look at it from a different point of view.  With similar precision, that is what I am trying to----provoke intelligent debate about what is best for the class, not some heated discussion that gets everyones panties in a bundle....<br><br>With that said, you say that I subscribe to the HP=GOD philosophy &amp; you disagree with that.  Let me ask you a question then---what else is there?  If that number hits zero, there isnt much that ANY class can do, no matter WHAT their abilities.  I think you missed my point in the previous message.  HP has to be GOD, as you like to put it, because thats what its all about.  No matter what class you are, no matter what race you are, no matter how much damage you can do, that number hits zero, fight over--you lose.<br><br>Again, as previously stated, we can get there anyway we want, but an SK should be able to tank much better than we presetnly can.  If the way to get there is to increase our defensive disciplines, hell, that would be cool.  Why is that?  Because it helps save our HP.<br><br>Also, Im not saying that an SK should be able to tank Vindy.  Although it would be nice, Im not necessarily saying that SKs /PLDs should be able to do that.  All Im saying is that if Verant truly wants to make all classes desirable for groups, then they can REALLY help SKs by doing WHATEVER (increasing HP, increasing defensive caps, giving defensive disciplines, etc.) to help them SAVE THE HP.<br><br>Verant most likely believes that the classes are reasonably close in terms of &quot;in balance.&quot;  If we didn't take away the melee damage, which actually is a logical step becuase we can then let WAR wield substantially all weapons, which they should be able to anyways, then please provide some other examples of what we can &quot;take away&quot; from to give us better tanking ability.<br><br>Re: WAR being better tanks than SKs cuz of defensive and auto-riposte discipline?  Is taht what you are telling me?  Come on--you have to be kidding....<br><br>Lunatic</p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

From what I understand, an equivalently geared &amp; level WAR will have substantially more HP, as well as a higher AC, which almost by definition makes them better tanks.  Spirit Tap aint gonna make up that difference bud &amp; doing nothing but tapping to heal ourselves certainly isnt the best way for us to be tanking (heh--we would hardly even be swinging...)  And do NOT tell me you aren&amp;#8217;t getting interrupted OFTEN as MT trying to get Spirit off; the casting time sooks&amp;#8230;  =)  <br><br>Further, re: defensive discipline, WAR dont even get defensive until 55, right?  Also, i think that it is on a timer, so it isnt a constant thing that they can constantly rely on (granted, I think that the timer is 15 min intervals, which is fairly quick, but nonetheless).  Also, I believe that you are referring to the Discipline of Furious for auto-riposte&amp;#8212;correct?  If so, that is far less usable, as the duration is 9 secs, with a base re-use time of 60 min.  <br><br>I think that the perception in game doesnt factor in those disciplines at all either.  My experience has been to ask what your total HP is, as well as what you total AC is. Generally, the highest guy tanks (unless he is a DOLT, which has happened &amp; then we make a change.  TRUE DOLTS, however, are really not that common).  Again, right or wrong, that is how I frequently see it working.<br><br>I guess Im confused---why would any of us NOT want SKs to tank better???  With the exception of taunt (which took a BRUTAL blows with disease counters causing less agro), tanking MOBs is the next best thing we do.  And with our taunting ability, I think that it makes a LOT of sense to have us tank better&amp;#8230;.<br><br>Lunatic<br></p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

Yeh we could do better in the HP department, but it's only against the Big Guys that we are inadaquate to the point of not being allowed to play.<br><br>I do rely on lifetaps to balance the HP difference between me and Warriors alot.  In XP groups, with Cleric's I know I typically stay in the top 2 bubbles of health with me using lifetaps and the Cleric using Clestial Cleansing.  I also do a great deal of XP with just me and a Druid, Chloro, Superior Heal and Lifetaps keeps me alive quite well.  And if we add a warrior to that mix they stil want me to Tank for agro reasons and the Lifetap that keeps me from being so dependant on the Druids lesser heals.  <br><br>Yes I'd like more HP's, I am currently buying the extra Stamina and will soon buy the Natural Durability, Regen and every other AA Ability that adds to or regens HPs (after I get Critical Hits that is).  But, when I'm in an XP group, my HP's are within about 1k of the comperable buffed Warriors my level, and for Raids I'm above 3k with Hps and the warriors break 5k.  But my value to those that know my play style makes me far more valuable than the HP's I bring.<br><br>Discipline, yes I mean Furrious, but Auto-Rippost lets everyone understand what it does.  The Defensive is lvl 55, 15 minute reset, but for Raids they typically switch MA between pulls so that the one with Defensive up gets to be MA, we do this alot in ToV.  Defensive is just that powerful!  Furrious is a tremendous but limited discipline.  The benefit is to allow huge agro to the Main Tank without taking any damage, which defensive doesn't do (it reduces agro alot).  So basically whenever you get together 2-4 groups of people to do any Raiding, why would you take the chance of NOT having a Tank with Defensive be the Main Assist, it's on par with why would you put a Shaman healing the MA as primary healer.  When the chips go down, everyone does what they have to do, SK's jump in and Tank, Shaman heal, Rangers tank too when they are the last Melee standing and the Clerics haven't camped out yet.<br><br>I'd like to get some plus-up in Tanking, sure, but I don't want to give up Melee ability to do it.  Even if we get buffed up in defense we still will spend most Raids hitting the MOB from behind, so reducing Melee will only make us less useful 90% of the time.<br><br>Neptunis</p>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 62 DE Gravelord<br>Have Axe, will travel</td></td></tr>

I play Sk/Ranger for the fun of having spells and being able to solo when I don't feel like grouping or I wanna make some coin.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all of us think the Sk needs to tank Vindi to be complete. As I have stated before I have been tanking with my ranger and my sk with lesser AC gear has better AC than my ranger unbuffed. The excuse that we can't tank doesn't fly with me. I know some zones need tanks with better AC and defense but I am sure they don't need to have a warrior. <br><br>I was in frenzy in Velks for 4 hours and we had 57 sk tanking for 1 hour then 55 warrior took over when sk left and guess what we had to stop pulling for a min to let cleric get mana. The difference was that the Sk could life tap.<br><br>Do I think Sk's need some work, sure but nerfing our damage output is not the way to go just to get more hps. I think actually raising our damage output would be of more benefit and keeping our hps where they are. You might as well face the fact the warrior will never be replaced as the MA on boss mobs, Verant will never make a change that would allow us to move ahead of them.  We would be better off getting stuff to make us more efficient killers in PvE. <br><br>Give us better reuse time on Leechcurse (a big cry for this is being made on sk boards). Consolidate some of our debuffs into one spell so we don't have to mem an AC tap, ATT tap and Str tap leaving our slots open for proc spells, DoTs and DD. Give us a resist debuff so when we cast it gives us agro and lets rest of group land spells. Give us higher offense not too much but a small upgrade would help with our melee output. Make HT a percentage of total hps for the mob for damage rather than a hard number.<br><br>I don't think my ideas are any better than yours but deep down inside you know that you won't get your hps and weapon nerfage. Sk's will have to make a name for themselves just as Ranger's had to post Kunark and pre Luclin. I don't expect much change after PoP comes out due to them working on EQ2. I think they may make small changes but nothing that will upset the status quo till their next money maker comes out. At which time it won't matter much if Sk's will be able to tank Vindi.</p>&nbsp;<br>Cannis 65th Ranger<br></td></td></tr>

My only other weapons I have currently are a MOSS, a Sporali Defender, a Centi Warspear, and a Mithril 2H. If I sold it the proceeds would likely go to the buy a new 2hs fund.

With that in mind, just to comparo shop, see how much an Ebon Mace goes for.  If you could sell DB Rod, as you are not well trained in 2HB anyways, and get an Ebon (1HB), you'd be set all the way til mid-50s EASY.  Ebon has a dmg per sec on 16.3 and you still can hold a shield.  This is presuming, of course, that you want to improve your weapon at the moment, and are not concerned about armor....<br><br>I am a big fan of 1HB for SKs.  Many top end 1HB are SK only, which helps keep the price down, and I love the envy that I get from WAR that can't wield 1/2 the weapon that SKs can (granted, they can wield TWO though...heh).  Further, several of the BEST 1HB in the GAME (in ToV) are SK and / or SK/PLD only and they are SCARY.  In other words, do NOT ignore 1HB--it helps in mid-game and definitely can at the end game.<br><br><br>I just recently acquired a 1HP (Shard of Night, from earlier post) and have been pleasantly surprised at how fast I was able to get my skill in piercing above 200.  I have a good friend that is a chanter, so I am frequently buffed with INT &amp; SPD buffs, which make weapon training go a lot faster.  However, regardless of whether you have a chanter friend or not, you will most likely be grouping with a SHM or a ENC in your 50s anyways, so all Im saying is that it isnt your death if you dont train in all your weapon skills early on.<br><br>However, if you want to train 2HB, then you are FINE for quite some time.  15.25 dmg per sec will leave many drooling over the dmg that you do &amp; you will be fine through your 40s easy.  Further, there are a few 2HB SK weapons that are frightening, but I have seen only ONE so far (Facesmasher if memory serves--they are RARE)<br><br>Anyways, hope this helps<br><br>Lunatic</p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

But, remember this is just my opinion(all pricers are consistant wiht Brells PCs.) I would sell the FBSS for as much as you can (3k on my server) I think the haste they give is good but not as good as the AC a good belt will give ya. Anyway From what I found out you have 5k to spend. On my server(Brell) you could buy a whole set of sentinent Armor for just over 4k. It's kidna cheap on my Server so This might not do ya any good hehe. Wiht the K you have left Fill up on jewley(cougar claws, jaggedbands/hp,ac rings*exphensive) and a good 1hs(1hb) and 2hs(2hb). I think weapons are awesome but Uber weapons are unnecessary. TO practice 1hs I'd get a Sporalli defenders blade, they go for around 100pp on my server. 1hb would be a but exphensive but a MOSS sells for about 400pp on my server. 2hs I would buy a Nasthar Greatsword. They go for around 200p Low delay low dmg but, hey yer not gonna hit for much over 20 until 10 and even then you'll onyl get 30 or so and by 20 you can still use it cause of the +str. Hehe, 2hb I can't think of many cheap 2hb but maybe just use a FS one... I don't know if this helps but if it does im glad. If not... well just ignore it hehe.

He is weak in STR and STA, so Crustatian Shell Armor would be a better fit.  Also some higher AC items than both of these sets offer would be nice and for that I'd fill in with Darkforge, probably the BP and at least 1 bracer.<br><br>To start I'd recommend some faster weapons, but the MoSS is a keeper.  If you get a Ornate Runed Blade (19/30 2hs +3 sv all) and either a Centi Short Sword (12/24 +5 STR/STA) or Crystalline Short Blade (10/24) you'll be hitting for the full damage cap on all weapons but hitting faster so doing more damage till mid-20's.  I'd also strongly recommend you get a good shield, best bet being the Clay Guardian Shield (25AC +50 HPs) but cheaper versions like the Velium Round Shield will do you well till the 30's.  If you don't see a MoSS cheap get a Smoldering Brand as a good training 1hb weapon, it's fast, hits good and procs from lvl 1.<br><br>Try to eventually get a Hero Bracer for the extra STR, a Bracer of Scavenging is a nice AC +DEX bracer which usually goes cheap and Gauntlets of the Black are outstanding for AC and STR untill you get planes stuff.<br><br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 55 DE Revenant<br><br>p.s.  If you thought the DE was weak, you won't like the Gnome, they are very similar in stats and power.  You might want to try the Large Race SK, and then twink with Sentient.  Either way, good luck</p>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 62 DE Gravelord<br>Have Axe, will travel</td></td></tr>

Basically, any suggestions would be welcome for appropriate equipment that I could look out for.<br><br>Drom<br><br>Level 18 Shadow Knight<br>Last of the Dispossessed of Quellious</p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

If you get either a Velium 2h Sword for about 5pp or a Frozen 2h Sword for a little more you would then be able to kill wilowisps which is where non-twinks make their money at lvl 12-20.  Each greater lightstone will bring in 9plat once you trade them in to the gypsie in S Ro and then sell back the research box, you'll get xp too.<br><br>Other stuff you might be able to get:<br><br>Bloodstained Mantle 6AC +STR +10 sv Magic, allows you to bash those wisps since it's magic.<br><br>Straw Spun Belt 10AC belt, very nice for AC<br><br>Velium Round Shield, maybe, nice AC, sv cold and again lets you bash magic stuff.<br><br>There are a few places now where you could make some money.  First kill Skels and sell bone chips to those needy Necro's.  Next is wil-o-wisps in the commons, as already stated greater lightstones are good money, lightstones are also almost a plat per to a merchant.  If you want to work faction with Nariak, go into Nektalos Forest and turn left to the SW corner and start killing the Halfling Raiders (watch out for the deputy and the medic, both alot higher level).  Save the hats and beads they drop, they are quest stuff.  These guys drop alot of bronze weapons and the hats get turned in to give you a 2hs weapon a little bit better than fine steel.  Or if your server is like mine (I don't play pvp) you could get into a derv group in either the Commons or S Ro, as the Derves also drop alot of bronze weapons and the rings they drop are ok money too.<br><br>Maybe the new Newbie Quests for armor will give you some upgrades, check them out.  They are all Race/Class specific and I never had them available when I was that level so know nothing about them.<br><br>Just some random ideas of what you can do.  Once you get some money (100pp+) you can start looking for things like Jagged Bands, Grotesk Alloy Mask, Khobold Hide Boots (low AC but cheapest kick magic item I know) and maybe an agility neck piece to get you over 75 AGI.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 55 DE Revenant</p>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 62 DE Gravelord<br>Have Axe, will travel</td></td></tr>

However, here is the heart of the issue.<br><br>Recently, many spells that reduced speed were changed to be &quot;disease&quot; based.  On the surface, this was good idea, especially since cure disease suddenly became available (at level 22 I think) to we Shadowknights.  Meaning we could get rid of a spell that slowed us down without have to wait out the duration of the spell.<br><br>However, shamans, who have a responsiblity to slow down MOBs suddenly found themselves getting the holy crumbs kicked out of them everytime they cast a &quot;slow&quot; spell.  It seemed that Mobs really hate disease counters.  The developers at Verant, figuring that the death of a shaman, everytime they cast slow, was a bad thing, decided to SIGNIFICANTLY reduce the amount of aggro a disease counter generates.  Yahhhhhh..the shammies live to slow another day, but here comes the downside to this little story.<br><br>Shadowknights, who have played in a group, know that the very best spell for taunting an angery Mob off a magic user is a 9th level spell called Disease Cloud.  It is quick...it has low mana usage...it did not take up a buff slot and it is very very effective in taunting.  The only downside was the fact that it was a DoT, so mezzing a Mob after casting Disease cloud on it was not possible.  However, as the name implies, it is disease based and now after the series of changes previously spoken of...it is completely ineffective.<br><br>There are other spells that will do the job, but most are either difficult to land (darkness), have a long casting time, are mana intensive, use a buff slot that is overridden by an other common buff or are a combination of those.  (I'm using Heart Flutter as a substitute at the moment.)   <br><br>I have never complained (until now) about our role in the EQ world.  We are Shadowknights and we do not whine.  We are not the best tanks, damage dealers or pullers.  We do all those things well, but not as well as some other classes.  We where, until this nerf, the best class at getting and keeping aggro.  We can still do the job pretty well, but with the neutering of this one spell that job has become much harder.<br><br>I guess who I really feel for is that 18th level wisard who groups with a 20th level Shadowknight thinking that the crocs in Oasis will be thinking about the Knight and not him.  Those days are over, unless someone in development figures out that we need a spell that again has the characterists of this very useful spell.<br><br>Will I stop playing my SK over this?  I doubt it. But it will make me a lot more nervous everytime a wisard or cleric casts a spell.<br><br>Good luck and good hunting in the land of Norrath.<br><br></p>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></td></tr>

MOBs went from green to me to yellow to lvl 60's (we left those alone as well as leaving Grieg himself alone although he kept showing up).  My Guild decided to explore it, starting at 1 end and fighting through as much of the zone as we could from 1 end to the other.  We had 8 people total, 2 groups of 4, lots of Druids, 1 lvl 60 Warrior, 1 lvl 60 Wizard, 1 Cleric and just me as the other tank.  Spells in this zone have standard resists, nothing was immune (except some to changes in speed), nothing had excessive agro on any 1 spell we have as happens sometimes in other zones.  Also MOBs are normal for their agro too, you can pull MOBs past people unlike CoM for example.<br><br>Agro was never a problem, and we had a horrible time with LD all day.  When Main Tank went LD I'd just drop Heart Flutter or Shroud of Pain on the MOB and I had agro.  I always start a fight de-buffing them (Torrent of Hate and Shroud of Pain) the drop Boil Blood on the ones that were high blue and would live long enough for the dot to work.  So basically I had good agro before anything bad happened.  IF I tried to add Heart Fluter while the Tank was still fighting, I got agro'd and would have to turn off auto-attack to let Warrior take it back.  With adds I'd lead with Shroud of Pain and the Heart Flutter to ensure agro if the MOB was not going to be mezzed (we had a Bard too).  We survived several waves of MOBs like this some times (they will sometimes spawn in groups of 3-4 and respawn on the same spot quickly if you don't move, traps maybe).  <br><br>I was in no way Agro handicapped by not having Disease Cloud in my line-up.  I didn't even have to use Shadow Vortex for agro, by keeping some of the more powerful debuffs and dot's on MOBs at all times I was always high enough on the agro list that I could grab agro anytime by hitting the MOB with Shoud of Pain and the Taunt key.  I was also using a 2hs, when I switched in the Ebon Mace and SBS to take while waiting for the Warrior to get back on-line, I had an even easier time holding agro.  Oh yeh, we were moving all the time except when waiting on someone who was LD, and I never went OOM.  It's not an overly crowded zone for MOBs and we had to move to find them so it wasn't non-stop pulls, but you can keep agro still without burning all your mana (I fight at 164 INT btw so you can compare).<br><br>The change in Disease Cloud may be inconvienient, but it doesn't threaten our &quot;Class Defining&quot; ability.  So instead of complaining about the change I for 1 will continue to post the other tactics that work for me to keep agro and hope the rest of you will too so that others can learn.  And since some people will contradict my methods (as they should if they have a better idea) I'll post zone and MOB info so you have something to work with to disagree.<br><br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 55 DE REvenant</p>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 62 DE Gravelord<br>Have Axe, will travel</td></td></tr>

I have rarely used Desease Cloud for taunt, but kept it memmed when I was backup Tank so I could brag quick agro when needed (adds or Cleric starting to take hits).  Otherwise I use Torrent of Hate and Shroud of Pain all the time, but have to be very careful I don't pull agro off Main Tanks using them both.  SO, with 2 very fast casting, low mana spells that actually give real benefits I can create more agro that I normally want.  I didn't use Shadow Vortex alot as it over-agro's both of the other debuffs I use.  Now Shadow Vortex has gone back into use, and I LOVE what it does for my AC during fights.<br><br>My advice, when you are Main Tank either Darkness or cast Shadow Vortex on pulls as the MOB is inbound.  If you are pulling as well pull with Darkness and then stop and stack all your debuffs on the MOB as you bring it back to the group.  Yopu will have no trouble at all keeping agro after that.  If you are back-up Tank and need to get something off the Chanter fast use Shadow Vortex with a Bash/Slam, stunning a MOB really upsets them for some reason.  If you keep the MOB debuffed, carefully so as not to draw agro from the Main Tank, you should be high enough on the hate list to pull it quickly to you when needed with either Shadow Vortex or Heart Flutter (which out taunted Desease Cloud in most higher level zones but is just much slower cast time).<br><br>So now Shadowknights, we must adapt and move forward.  No complaining, sulking about or self doubting, we still rule the Agro by alot, we just have to use more of our skills to do it.  Let those weak Pali's rely on a lowbie spell for agro, we will do more damage and be more useful now while still keeping the agro away from them.<br><br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 55 DE Revenant</p>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 62 DE Gravelord<br>Have Axe, will travel</td></td></tr>

I'm not sure you will ever hear a caster say that bind affinity, SoW or Gate/Port is useless and they are fairly low level spells.<br><br>Secondly, when I am in a group, my job..unless I am MT...is to keep an eye on all the caster types, especially clerics, enchanters, and wisards to make sure that nothing beats on them for any length of time.  Disease Cloud(1.5 sec. Cast/Mana 10/Recast=6 sec. + no buff counter) was a much better, less mana intensive method of taunting then the two spells you have mentioned (Torrent of Hate = 1.5 sec/Mana 60/Recast 6 sec  Shroud of Pain = 3 sec./Mana 100/Recast 6 sec.)<br><br>When I am main tank...once I have aggro, the wisards, clerics and other assundry magic types can cast with impunity (mostly) because of this fast, low mana spell.<br><br>Mana intensive spells can cause you to have to med. much more frequently and if pulls are coming quickly, you may not have the time.  And the number of buffs that you have may not be an issue in experience groups, but I'm betting you will miss the shammy or cleric buffs that Torrent and Shroud will overwrite in a raid situation.  (And from what I have read...it seems that the Torrent line of spells really don't generate that much aggro.)<br><br>Shadow Vortex is a slightly different issue...it is a good aggro gaining spell, but again mana and buff slots are an issue.  The one good thing that SV had over DC is of course DC is a DoT, making it unuseful if you want to re-mez a mob.<br><br>Darkness is a good spell as well...If it sticks, which I find to be about 2-5.<br><br>You mentioned pulling as well.  I'm thinking that if you are stoping to debuff mobs on the way in, that you are a fairly slow puller due to extended time having to med even if you are a Dark Elf.<br><br>You are correct that many of our other spells can fill in where DC left off.  SV and Heart Flutter are good choices.  However, those are both level 39 spells.  What is the level 17 SK going to use to save the life of his shammy, rogue, monk, or cleric hunting partner?  <br><br>And I sincerely doubt that you will be able to taunt off a Pally who uses those &quot;lowbie spell for agro&quot; if they don't want you too.  (Losing aggro to a Pally is very annoying...especially when you can't get it back.)<br><br>And lastly, I have no problem with dealing with adversity.  Shadowknights have been dealing with challanges since they picked up a sword.  (I still remember the 20% hybrid experience modifier)However, I do get annoyed by Verant &quot;fixing&quot; a problem, but being completely unaware that they were causing another, especially when that problem is a class defining ability.<br><br>Good hunting all...see ya in Norrath.</p>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></td></tr>

And the stopping to cast on a pull is only really useful when you are pulling with a Darkness line spell, which you don't do in high tempo groups anyway.  But in the 30's and into the low 40's I pulled this way alot and was always welcome in groups as I kept the xp rolling without adds.  But yes, it's not an everyday technique but something the low levels could use.<br><br>Next, I still have never seen Torrent of Hate over-write a Shaman buff.  Will you please tell me what buffs this over-writes.  I understand the issue when you have a full buff window, but besides then I've never seen a conflict, and I Raid with full lvl 60 Shaman buffs and Chanter buffs, usually Druid buffs instead of Cleric buffs though.  So this one I really am looking for info, help me out.<br><br>Shroud of Pain is a spell I was using post-patch in Tenumbrous Mnts at the Castle.  I was with 2 groups, we had a lvl 58 Necro pulling as she new the Castle and I don't.  When she pulled, I stood just in front of the MOB and caste Torrent of Hate and never once did the MOB pass me to chase the puller or did I have a problem keeping agro with a Ranger, Rogue and Wizard in the mix.  I did switch to 1hb and a shield, but I always do that when Main Tanking anyway, but Bash does help agro alot.<br><br>Shadow Vortex is a great taunter, and yes it takes longer to caste and more mana, but it's very effective.  I was using it to pull agro before in other groups, and it will pull MOBs to you very quick unless someone has done something absolutely stupid (Ice Commet on pull for instance).  Remember I group with a Chanter almost always, I know I can get a MOB off him if MEZ fails or breaks before he's memblured it.  Shadow Vortex is awesome at this.  AND if you SV the mezzed MOBs after memblur the Chanter can sit right next to the MOB and once mez breaks the MOB ignores them and finds you.<br><br>As for out taunting Pali's, it's not tough at the high end.  They use stun alot, but for MOBs that are immune to stun this is a limited taunt.  I use alot of spells when I fight, so for a Pali to ever get anything off me when I don't want them to is very unusual.  If I do loose agro, I can always get it back quick with SV, bash and stand INSIDE the MOB when you taunt.  Getting as close to the MOB as possible is the most effective taunter in the game.  Even if the Pali s effectively stunning, just step inside of him, bash, taunt and caste SV, when stun wears off, it will hate you more anyway.  And if all else fails HT it in the mix for another taunt (every 70 minutes).<br><br>Basically we're ok with taunt still.  Some people will have to change their tactics a bit, we will have to relook at our spell line-up, but we've still got it.  And if you're not pulling sit between MOBs so you can keep the mana coming in.<br><br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 55 DE Revenant</p>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 62 DE Gravelord<br>Have Axe, will travel</td></td></tr>

I'm sorry to have to drag this up over and over again but there is no (!) sk spell equivalent to the old Disease Cloud at the moment. One of my greatest advantages as a tank when fighting with my regular group deep in the Hole or Chardok was that I could break a mezzed and slowed mob with the chanter sitting down and I'd still have aggro. I'd do my little &quot;routine&quot; as my group mates called it, Taunt, Shadow Vortex, Disease Cloud. The time consumed in this routine is minimal, next to none. I can taunt and mez break still but to achieve the same effect we are talking double if not triple the time from before. Is this a large issue? Yes, it is.<br><br>The two zones I mentioned have a fast spawn rate and minimizing the time every kill takes is important. Imagine yourself fighting to a camp, this is usually a very mana intensive process. Now imagine &quot;doing&quot; a zone, fighting from the entrance of The Hole and down to Kindle/High Scale Kirn with one group, without pausing or medding. Not having a shaman in the group set up the chanter is also responsible for slows. My chanter has C3 and still tells me to taunt so he can sit and med down in Chardok. Maybe this doesn't apply to just sitting at a camp and killing a set number of spawns but if you want to swing down and take out Prince you need to be on the move constantly or back pops will get you. The advantage of having an sk tank was that your group speeds up it's kill rate greatly, due to fast mez breaks and damage dealers not having to be so careful of their aggro, and in my opinion this was somewhat effected by the change of disease aggro.<br><br>I don't believe in the word &quot;nerf&quot; since a fix is a fix and obviously intended. However, I do think that this is an unforseen side effect that VI didn't really think of. Life goes on though, I will /feedback this and it will probably still stay the same. There's not much one can do, I feel somewhat entitled to at least come here and give my opinion of why this was bad for the sk class.<br><br>As for Torrent of Hate having any taunt value, I think it may be on account of the zone you are in. Different mobs in different zones react differently to spells. I wont say that was the case in Tenebrous since I've never fought there myself but if you thought Torrents gave aggro you should perhaps try with some of the other spells known for their hate creating factor. Try going into CoM and stand in the pull path, no matter what the puller has done to the mob that's incoming (excepting Shadow Vortex) that mob is going to aggro on the very first thing in it's way, not follow the puller to the group. The mobs in Velketors Lab are very insensitive to spells, they simply don't give the aggro they do in Seb. Chanters usually love Velks on account of the low aggro their mezzing and slowing pulls. I think as a rule of thumb you could say that if a low aggro spell like Torrent of Hate is giving you aggro then a spell like Shadow Vortex or Disease Cloud (pre fix patch) will glue the mob to you. I base my no aggro statement on Torrent of Hate on the mobs in Arena. Just like I said, standing in camp I cast Torrent of Hate on incoming mobs that had just been tagged with an arrow or proximity aggroed and they never even looked my way. Shadow Vortex and Disease Cloud had the opposite effect though. From this I deduct that ToH is lower aggro then the two others. Even Shroud of Pain pulled aggro so ToH must be lower aggro then that too. I base it on being able to actually cast the spell on many raids where other Shrouds etc pull immediate aggro if cast early in a fight. Basically, read my other post as to what I think VI is trying to achieve with for instance ToH.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri May 17 08:54:03 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br></td></td></tr>

I have also fought into Royals in Chardok, held camps in Seb, Chardok, Velks (including Frenze which seems to be the fastest action of any Camp there on my Server) and Main Tanked in the Arena and Reavers in CoM.  So YES, I know those camps and zones, and I know how agro differs.  But I was giving a REAL example of a post patch success, and no the MOBs in Ten. Mnts. will run past you if not taunted, the Beastlord for our group kept getting in front of me but never gt agro'd on the way past.<br><br>Shadow Vortex and Heart Flutter ARE every bit as big taunting spells as Disease Cloud was, they are just slower and more mana.  I have been told on Raids prior to this not to use either spell because the Main Tank can't hold agro when I cast them.  Either of these spells will bring the instant agro you need to protect a Caster.<br><br>I don't know what to account our so very different experience with keeping agro, except that I tried not to use disease cloud all along and found other taunting spells that worked as well or better for me depending on the zone.  For example, Heart Flutter in Sireen's Grotto would cause so much agro that I was forced to FD to let the Warrior get agro back, Shadow Vortex in the same zone was much lower agro.  In Seb I've found Shadow Vortex to be the superior Taunt.  Giants absolutely hate Boil Blood, but inside Kael Arena Darkness seems to be the best taunt.  I have even found MOBs that hate lifetaps more than almost anything.  But as a rule, once you stack the debuffs on a mezzed MOB the Chanter should be safe, unless he's sitting right next to the MOB when mez breaks.  <br><br>YES you need more mana to keep agro now, but I still go OOM last in a group.<br><br>Neptunis Rex</p>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 62 DE Gravelord<br>Have Axe, will travel</td></td></tr>

Those are two of the best taunting spells that SKs get, but they have definitely lost some of their umph due to disease counters causing less agro.  Im not sure what your thoughts are, but I think that sooks.  <br><br>Pretty much the sole reason we are casting these spells is for taunt ability (there are rare exceptions, but generally at 50+, you arent casting these for their primary effects) &amp; spending 4 times the mana (Shadown Vortex) for (generally) the same effect basically sooks.  Further, the number of spells that cause a ton of agro has just been drastically reduced.  =(<br><br>I think Verant generally does a decent job of thinking matters through (despite alarming silliness at times), but reducing an SKs ability to taunt is an interesting adjustment to say the least.  Did they intentionally do this?  Im not sure, but I can say that SKs as a whole are weaker, regardless of whether you change strategies or not.  And in case you haven't noticed, SKs generally arent the 1st class picked when many are forming their &quot;dream&quot; groups....<br><br>On an (marginally) unrelated note, DoTs with chanters are perfectly fine---you just have to be careful.  I DoT all the time in Sebilis or Chardok &amp; there has seldom been, if ever, any problem.  The primary trick is to do 2 things:  1) wait until MT starts clobbering a MOB (that you are /assisting if you are not the MT) and 2) let the group know that the mob is DoTed.  That's it. Seldom will you ever have a problem.  Boil Blood is a decent spell &amp; I use it all the time.<br><br>=)<br><br>Lunatic</p>&nbsp;<br> </td></td></tr>

First off, it's virtually no aggro at all. You can throw it on an incoming mob that someone just tagged with an arrow and you still wont get any attention from the mob. <br><br>Secondly, it's a great buff (47+ to attack) and melees always save a buff slot for it and actually ask you to cast it if you happen to miss once(unlike Torrent of Pain which adds 12ac, that slot could be used for something much more beneficial).<br><br>Thirdly, the resistance check isn't made on mr. Giant Captain in WW is for instance 100% mr but Torrent of Hate lands on him.<br><br>And fourth and last, it seems to have a zonewide range. If you are out pulling half way across an outdoors zone or deep in some dungeon the buff will still reach your party.<br><br>So, a shadowknight spell with no aggro, a meaningful purpose, that you can land even on fully magic resistant mobs and be nowhere near your party and still have them receive the benefits of. Seems the thought is to increase the usefulness of the shadowknight as a member of high level raids in my opinion and I think it works, to a degree at least. Shadowknights need a skilled player to come to their full potential :)<br><br>Torrent of Fatigue is perhaps also a part of this thought but as of yet it is unbelievably bugged (it seems to add 20 sta to the actual stat Stamina but for some reason it drains your sta bar. Even sitting, non-active characters will get their sta bar drained in roughly 30 seconds).<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue May 14 10:31:27 2002</em></p>&nbsp;<br></td></td></tr>

The Cromatic Boots are also nice 10AC with haste but I believe they are plate so no Iksars, but I'm not sure about that.<br><br>Definately do not trade for an FBSS, the AC does you better in my opinion.  If you want a waste slot I'd recommend looking for the Silvery Belt of Contention so you get good Haste with nice stats.  I really dislike any low AC items even with nice effects except for resists when absolutely necessary.<br><br>Either way, good luck.<br><br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 55 DE Revenant</p>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 62 DE Gravelord<br>Have Axe, will travel</td></td></tr>
