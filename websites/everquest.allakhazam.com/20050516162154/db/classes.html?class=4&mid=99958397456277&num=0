Sure it'll take more time to get him to level, but this will allow you to learn more skills and be a more complete Bard at higher levels. I highly recommend staying in newbie areas until all creatures there are green to you. Therefore you will still be increasing your skills on mobs so that you are not lacking in them at higher levels. You should max out both 1HB and 1HS skills at each level, and try for peircing. Max one out, then work on the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;And when done with that work on Peircing until you level, and keep going. The best Bard-specific weapon in the game is actually a peircing weapon (not the Singing Sword, I'm talking most damage per second).  At least try to keep Peircing up when you've maxed out those other skills.  You'll find that you'll still have time to work on it in the higher levels when it takes longer to get through a level, and you've already maxed out 1HS and 1HB.<br /><br />You also get dual weild at level 17 so abandon that shield from then on and get those skills maxed out. I had them maxed out by lvl 20 from the amount of meleeing I did. While I wasn't great as a tank I was passable because I played smart, and the amount of soloing I did helped as well.  Also doing this helped build my dodge skills, which took a little longer to go up than dual weild as I wasn't attacked near as much as I did the attacking.  Same for Offense and Defense Skills.  I generally gained another 5 skills in Offense before I gained 2 skills in Defense.  But so far by the time I'm done with each level I've maxed everything out.<br /><br />*BUILDING SINGING SKILLS*<br />These will build up on their own as you fight things and use various songs.  Even songs which may be boosted with a particular instrument can be used to build your singing skills while equipping a weapon or just not equipping that specific instrument. You'll also build your singing skills if you try to use an incomplete instrument even if your song played uses the same skill that instrument WOULD use when complete.<br /><br />*BUILDING PERCUSSION SKILLS*<br />At lvl 3 you need to already have a drum by now, either for free by doing a quest in Kelethin, or buy purchasing one, they're dirt cheap. Use that drum with the lvl 3 song Jaxon's Jig of Vigor. Play it for a few minutes after you reach a new level to build those percussion skills up. You're level 5 song Selo's Accelerando. Pretty much all the running around you do will max this skill level out on it's own. But it's nice getting it up at lvl 3 so you don't have to worry about it so much then.<br /><br />*BUILDING STRINGED SKILLS*<br />I wait to level 6 before I start working on my Stringed skills. Buy a Lute or Mandolin from a vendor and sit and play your heal song until you max out it's skill each level. Generally I spend a few minutes after each level playing this song to get it up to level max real quick.  It's not like it means a difference so much in the effectiveness of the song. But in terms of how many times you have to hit the button for the song to start playing, is somewhat important, and it insures that you are keeping your skills maxed out per level.<br /><br />*BUILDING WIND SKILLS*<br />You need to buy a legitimate Wind instrument by level 11 and use it in combination with the level 16 spell Tarew's Aquatic Ayre once you reach that level.  Start the song up and go underwater in a pond like in Halas and swim in a corner by aligning your character so he doesn't swim away.  Hit numlock and go to sleep. When you awake, if you haven't gone linkdead you will have maxed out your wind skills for that level, AND your swimming skills, and only come up short a stack of iron rataions and 2 stacks of water (less really). You really won't be using your Wind instrument so much until lvl 16, enough to build significant skills in it anyways. So that's the perfect opportunity. If you didn't feel adventurous you could at least work on those Wind skills at lvl 19 when you get your invisibility spell, which REQUIRES a Wind instrument to work. But I stress that the Ayre can be used to max out swimming skills as well, hitting two Griffenes with one Lambent stone.<br /><br />*BUILDING BRASS SKILLS*<br />When you get to lvl 18 buy another stack of iron rations and two stacks of water. Then go to a deserted section of some zone, where mobs don't pas by, and players rarely do. My choice there was a mountain ledge in East Commonlands just between the Nek Forest entrance and the Freeport zone.  I got a brass instrument (which you should have as early as possible, even if you can only use it once you reach lvl 18) and played the lvl 18 DoT the whole night while I slept. By the time I awoke I maxed out my Brass skills and didn't have to worry about misses. Same as with the Wind skills.<br /><br />*INSTRUMENTS WHICH AREN'T INSTRUMENTS*<br />Make sure you don't use the Raw Bamboo or Unfinished Brass Trumpet. Those are incomplete instruments and using them will NOT raise your wind or brass skills any.  There is no benefit to using them. I believe they are parts of a quest, or components you combine with other items, to make Bard instruments.<br /><br />*SAVING TIME*<br />One thing I did as a Bard was to buy all my spells in Erudin and Highhold Keep when I reached lvl 14. One trip to those two destinations I was able to buy all the spells I could only buy there. I made good use of the economy system in Kelethin as a Half Elf Bard by the time I got to lvl 14, when I had to make a trek to Erudin to get my spell.  I figured on my way I'd get my lvl 16 spell from High Keep.  But since I nearly 200pp I did a little research and realized I could buy all of the spells from those two locations in one trip, instead of going back to get each spell.<br /><br />I also got 50pp for buying the lvl 14 and 16 spell for someone else, so that helped offset the cost of buying the spells all at once.  Basically most of the other spells until high levels I can get at Freeport, Kelethin or Qeynos.  And what I do is buy a patch of spells when I go to one of those cities so that I don't have to keep returning.<br /><br />Currently I'm lvl 23 and have most of my spells already bought and in the bank. So I've saved a lot of time travelling by buying beforehand, and using the economy system. Just pop into any bank and pull out the next level song.  My whole rationale here is to not only save time, but to travel where I want, when I want, and not be bound to some set schedule in getting spells. I had 8 unused slots in the bank, but after buying 8 large 8-slot backpacks I had plenty of room to store my spells.<br /><br />One other thing, I carry the next level song with me so that I don't have to go to the bank JUST to get a song. So whenever I go to a bank to manage cash or deposit a number of items I make sure I have the next level of spells with me when I leave. This whole process has saved me a good amount of time, for only a half hour of research on the internet from www.eqdiva.com (spell location data), and a little thinking throughout the game as I played.<br /><br />*MAKES TEH MONEYS*<br />Also at level 23 I currently have 4 of the 7 peices of Lambent armor, thanks to a great economy system. I can't emphasize enough how important it is to find good groups, loot your share, and sell sell sell. Be on the lookout for items like bones chips, spiderlink silks, bat wings, etc to sell in stacks to higher level players that would rather drop 5pp on a stack than spend a half hour of their time hunting up one stack, and stealing kills from newbie areas. In Kelethin I was more successful than in Qeynos or Freeport because of the larger amounts of casters per zone (percentage wise).<br /><br />*CHARACTER CREATION*<br />Personally after I reached lvl 7 with my Wood Elf Bard I realized I did my character all wrong.  Focusing all my points into STR was a mistake, and the two most important stats, DEX and CHA were neglected as well as also not being the best base stats for a Bard.  So I moved all my items and money from that one, to a new Half Elf Bard that I created.  And I put most of my bonus points into DEX, and the rest into CHA, and he became a much more effective Bard because of it.  You get 25 bonus points to spend on a Bard. I spent 15 in DEX and 10 in CHA and never looked back.  Base STR is 75 and the only real negative stat I had to deal with was STA at 70, but I was able to pick up STA items in time, plus the lvl 3 STA song is good enough to regen my stamina and everyone else's in any group I join so it's no big deal.<br /><br />*TO MELEE OR NOT TO MELEE*<br />Whereas Rangers, Paladins, and Shadowknights are 3 parts fighter and 1 part caster, you are 2 parts fighter as 2 parts caster. What this means is that you should rarely tank, not commonly act as a secondary tank in full groups, and mostly fill the role as a tertiary melee fighter.  Help the Warrior and the Ranger deal damage, but make sure you buff the group first before you strike. This allows the warrior enough time to get the mob or mobs pretty focused on him, so you don't have to worry so much about taking damage, or having your spellsongs interrupted.<br /><br />I've gotten way with leaving my heal song up, or later mana song up, and grabbed a bite to eat, with no complaints from the rest of the full group.  Don't do this often, but moreso than most characters, you can leave a song running and sit back a minute to take a break and not feel so bad if there is a fight going on.<br /><br />*CONCLUSION*<br />With a little extra work, and some forethought, you can save alot of time, make a lot of money, and work on all your skills easily as you play your character.  Making you a much more effective character for your level, and making you more desireable for groups than you already are.<br /><br />Basstone, Half Elf Bard, E'Ci server, level 23 at this time of writing</p></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8"></td></tr></table>
