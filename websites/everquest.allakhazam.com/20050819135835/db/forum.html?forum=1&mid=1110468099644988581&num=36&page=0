<p>They occasionally go through periods of re-tuning and re-balancing class structures, but when they do it's to arbitrarily restrict players to following the Sony Vision and mostly ignore any useful, constructive advice or criticism that the players have. Usually, after a tuning or re-balance of this nature, there's cries from several class communities saying &quot;Huh? WTF they do that for?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>The top ten issues lists were born from the announcement that they were going to &quot;reevaluate&quot; class roles. They wanted to make it so that certain classes didn't get continually left out and so that certain classes weren't absolutely needed all of the time. Prime examples are it used to be if you were a ranger 45+, getting a group involved sexual favors and sacrificing your 1st born, but a 45 cleric could get a group in KC (where it was understood you HAD to be 50+) without blinking an eye. Maybe not a fair comparison since they're different roles, but the point still stands. <br /> <br />They've continually made changes to encourage letting &quot;the less desireables&quot; into your group. Things like an increased grouping bonus based on how many are in your group, not just that there are more then 3. Giving and/or taking away abilities and spells to/from certain classes to allow the competing classes of the same role a chance to get in groups. There have been other small changes too, but those are the big ones. I don't know if it was all an intentional part of the &quot;reevaluation&quot;, but it largely had the same effect. You don't HAVE to have a chanter to hunt in dungeons anymore, and you don't HAVE to have a cleric to have any hope of keeping your MT alive (in most day to day content at least). <br /> <br />I think this big reevaluation that they're finally getting around to doing is really going to be more inline with the &quot;class roles&quot; that they promised us long ago. They're going to say &quot;We want bards to be pullers&quot; and &quot;We want rogues to be the sustained DPS kings&quot; etc. It probably won't be much more then that. Of course, I could be wrong...</p>

<p>If you want more dps classes to get more groups, which I think is what they are talking about fixing, then increase the group size to 8 and keep the experience split the same as it is now for 5 and 6 in a group (1/5 + grouping bonus).  <br /> <br />With a current higher level group needing a tank, healer and slower mandatory for success, that leaves 3 more spots left for DPS. Depending on the particular camps requirements which vary: you may need more roles filled as well. If your tank is not an SK and your healer not a druid then you might need a puller and/or a snaring role which may require using up 1-2 of those dps spots. If your slower is not an enchanter you might need to use one of those dps spots for add control as well (if not filled by one of the other spots). In theory at a tough camp, a group could use all 6 spots for specialized roles and pure DPS classes would be shut out.  <br /> <br />I have not found it unusual to be in a group of 6 in a tough higher level zone with an essential role(s) filled from outside the group by a 2 boxing players 2nd toon, or even once a non 2 boxing player just helping out his guildies and participating in loot drops (the latter was monk puller/extra dps stayed out of grp, and did not want to raid and reduce everyones exp, just wanted in on rolls at 6 spawn in WoS).  <br /> <br />The point being that players have adapted to the group size limit by using these tactics, why not increase the group size and solve all these problems. If SOE thinks we can just form a raid to solve this then they do not understand that player have noticed a lot less experience per kill when raiding versus a group, and would not use a raid becasue of this. <br /> <br />I do not think that when SOE designed a 6 person group that they envisioned the number of specialized roles that would eventually evolve and become needed for success at higher level zone camps. The solution is to increase group max size and therefore demand for pure dps to get groups at that level. Wizards etc would be very happy. <br /></p>

<p>Probably the only classes that should be worried about nerfs are clerics and bards, I think.

<p>Read my lips:&nbsp;&nbsp;they nerf classes and they lose more players to WoW.  Class nerfs are the worst kind of nerfs possible.  Monk mitigation nerf was the biggest slap in the face to people who play monks.  Bard AOE nerf also comes to mind.  I've said it before on this board:  Don't give us something cool, take it away, break it and then give it back.  If you're going to do that, don't give it to us in the first place.  You just make people mad that way. <br /> <br />They may do it, but it would be one of the saddest moves in the history of gaming imo. <br /> <br />Another approach to class balancing is to &quot;beef up&quot; the classes that are lagging rather than &quot;nerf&quot; the ones that aren't.  I hope they go this route, but their track record doesn't suggest this will happen.  Some suggestions that come to mind?  Beef up the pally (post level 50).  Give the necro some more qualities that groups would want.  Give the Wizzie more than nuking and porting.  Improve Shammy healing (though their slow will usually get them groups).  Improve Ranger/Monk mitigation.  All of these things and many more can be done without taking away the uniqueness of each class.  I'm hoping they go this route. <br /> <br />Personally I would like to see Rangers and Druids get a pet.  Some kind of woodland creature.  No no, I meant a USEFUL pet for you druids out there.  Don't know how this would help a group, (maybe as an offtank and added DPS) but I'd like to see it anyways. <br /> <br />One good sign is that Brenlo seems to think we are going to like the changes.. I think that is good no? <br /> <br />Edit: <br /> <br />Heheh I wrote this on another thread and decided I would tack it on the bottom of this post for your amusement.  Enjoy! <br /> <br />Upcoming changes as per the class re-envisioning plan:  <br /> <br />Cleric: Clerics will now only be able to heal you if you have less than 5% health. We discovered that some players were using heals to chain heal during raids.  <br /> <br />Ranger: Now instead of 53 AA's to become a master archer you will need 453 AA's. Anyone who previously had AM3 will NOT be grandfathered in.  <br /> <br />Warrior: Warriors will now be able to mitigate at the same level as rangers.  <br /> <br />Pally: nothing, this class can't compete with warriors after level 50 so we think it is working just fine.  <br /> <br />SK/Druid: the SK and druid pet is now even more useless.  <br /> <br />Wizard: Wizard nuke spells now cost twice as much mana, increase aggro three times, and take twice as long to cast.  <br /> <br />Mages: see above Wizard and all pets after level 59 have been removed from the game. We discovered that players were using them to increase DPS.  <br /> <br />Necro: Necro pets may no longer taunt. Root type spells have been removed from the necro spell line.  <br /> <br />Monk/Bard: we think we have effectively &quot;fixed these classes&quot; but we reserve the right to incorporate new abilities with the next expansion then remove them later on.  <br /> <br />Rogue: Backstab is now a clickable disc usable once per 60 mins. Again, we felt that certain players were exploiting this ability to increase group DPS.  <br /> <br />Shaman: Slow will no longer affect mobs, it can still be used to slow the player if desired.  <br /> <br />Enchanter: Dire charm has been removed from the game. All mesmerization type spells now have a 50% chance to affect the caster. Memblur type spells have been removed from the game.  <br /> <br />Beastlords: Beastlord pet will now function at the same level as a druid pet. Beast slow and haste spells have been removed from the game. The item Bone-studded loop is no longer usable by the Beastlord Class.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Thu Mar 10 17:52:50 2005 by Sargethetachi</span></i> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Thu Mar 10 17:56:12 2005 by Sargethetachi</span></i></p>

You just make people mad that way.<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />Yeah. But it doesn't always happen that way IMO. Characters often become unitentionally more powerful (or weaker) as game content gets added to the game. Monk avoidance was not a problem until they added in newer high AC, low weight gear to the game. That combined with AC softcaps meant that in many exp group situations, monks could now tank better then any class in the game, which I don't think anyone can argue was intended or desired. The monk class's inherently higher avoidance was intended to offset the fact that they could only wear low AC gear (mitigation), with the intended result to have a character that could tank maybe as well as a ranger. Maybe. The solution was to generate a penalty for wearing high mitigation armor (high AC values) to bring that back to what it had always been. <br /> <br />The bard nerfs were also mostly due to content changes. SOE has experiemented with different &quot;kinds&quot; of mobs in different expansions. What happened is that starting in luclin (but not really hitting stride until PoP), SoE switched from mobs that had relatively even amounts of HP/AC/DPS to mobs that had lowish HP and/or AC, and very high DPS. With some mobs this was really dramatic. Huge DPS, but relatively low HPs. This made charming much more powerful then it had been before since you got a pet that dished out more damage. Swarm kiting became a hugely useful tactic simply because the mobs could kill eachother off much faster then they could before, and a well played bard could get exp off them all. AOE tactics, and kite tactics became more relatively valuable as well. <br /> <br /> <br />That's actually something that many players don't seem to get. Back in Kunark/Velious era, a &quot;solo class&quot; could solo better then a non-solo class, but not a lot better. Due to the huge discrepancy between HPs and DPS, any class that can kill without getting hit in the process has a *huge* advantage over one that can't. My paladin literally can't defeat mobs that druids and wizards can trivially quad kite simply due to the extremely high DPS rates that mobs have. They have still never really adjusted for that properly. In GoD and OoW, they shifted from raw dps to proc damage effects. Whoopie! You're still taking pretty fast damage as a tank, but for any class that doesn't have to sit there and get hit, the mobs are no tougher to kill then a Kunark era mob of the exact same level. Um... They've also increased the exp bonus for those newer mobs (to offset the fact that they do more damage I'm sure!), which is useless to melee classes who can't solo them, but basically just a huge bonus for those who can. <br /> <br />Note, that I've not pointed out a single change to a class. I'm just showing how by changing the nature of the mobs in a given expansion, you can drastically change the relative power of the classes in the game. <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />They may do it, but it would be one of the saddest moves in the history of gaming imo.<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />Totally disagree. A game that does not make an effort to keep the classes somewhat balanced will not last long. Sure. In the short term, you'll get a bunch of shortsighted people who are just pissed because their overpowered class got trimmed back to be equivalent in power to every other class, but in the long run you retain more players. It's a good thing, as long as the changes aren't truely arbitrary (as opposed to those who are directly affected claiming they are arbitrary). <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />Another approach to class balancing is to &quot;beef up&quot; the classes that are lagging rather than &quot;nerf&quot; the ones that aren't.  I hope they go this route, but their track record doesn't suggest this will happen.  Some suggestions that come to mind?  Beef up the pally (post level 50).

Improve Ranger/Monk mitigation.  All of these things and many more can be done without taking away the uniqueness of each class.  I'm hoping they go this route.<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />No. That's a bad method. While you can (and should) do occasional beef-ups of classes, your primary method of class balance should be reducing overpowered characters. <br /> <br />Picture two bowls of icecream. Your job is to put the same amount in each bowl. Inevitably, you scoop out a bit too much for one of the bowls. The &quot;smart&quot; way to balance them is to take some from one bowl and put it in another. That keeps the overall amount of icecream the same, but makes both bowls even. If you just add icecream, then anytime you make a mistake, you much keep adding more to correct it. Pretty soon, you'll have some seriously large bowls of icecream going, and *still* not evened them. Now imagine that instead of two bowls, there are 15 that need to be balanced. Additionally, instead of just icecream, you've got banannas in there and chocolate, and sprinkles, and whipped cream. Just adding more to each one will *never* result in even amounts. It's too complex with too many things to balance. Inevitably, something will be unbalanced somewhere, and we'll have to keep adding more to all the bowls to try to balance things out. <br /> <br />Even some of your suggestions don't make any sense. If you add tanking ability to monks and rangers, how exactly does that not reduce the uniqueness of the warrior class? Isn't his *only* contribution to a group his ability to tank? While I wouldn't mind having pally's beefed up, I would vastly prefer they &quot;fix&quot; paladins by changing/adding game content that is pally/melee friendly. How about putting in mobs that have *high* HPs, moderate AC and *low* dps? What a freaking concept! Mobs that wouldn't be very useful for charming, and would be difficult and time consuming to kite, but would actually be killable by melee classes! It's a miracle! We've just rebalanced soloing abilities for several classes, all without changing a single class in the game! <br /> <br />Add in a few undead mobs that match those criteria, and I'd be happy as hell. It would mean that loggin in on a slow night isn't a total waste. Right now, I *can* solo, but literally will spend like an hour getting an amount of exp that I can get in about 2 kills in a group in WoS. Tell me how that makes any sense at all... <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />Personally I would like to see Rangers and Druids get a pet.  Some kind of woodland creature.  No no, I meant a USEFUL pet for you druids out there.  Don't know how this would help a group, (maybe as an offtank and added DPS) but I'd like to see it anyways.<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />Ok. But what is that correcting? What imbalance exists in the game that must be filled by giving rangers a pet (and druid a better pet)? You say yourself that you don't know how this will help a group, but you want it anyway. Um... All it'll do is make beastlords redundant. Additionally, you've arbitrarily increased the dps of both classes for no apparent reason (ranger's aren't already one of the best melee dps, and they need more?). Druids will just be able to kill stuff that much faster (did they have a problem before?). Honestly, that addition would be huge for ranger soloing (especially fear kiting animals since that's just extra dps). It would mostly add to druids group damage (since their solo tactics don't really take advantage of a pet). Druids already do a pretty nice mix of dps and healing (and buffing, snaring, CC, etc). Do they really need *more*? <br /> <br /> <br />Class balance is not an easy issue. It's a lot easier to critisize how someone else does it then come up with realistically viable ideas yourself.</p>

<p>With the Scimitar of Mistwalker, a Pet will process. Walk with you, zone with you. <br /> <br />In battle, it provides one hit of about 150, then takes an automatic 10,000 points of damage, killing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe initially it did not take the 10,000 points of damage 'back in the day' so to say. <br /> <br />The best thing about the Scimitar was simply having the pet tag along.  A one hit pet is rather useless, but there have been occasions to use it to run down a mob, or pull or seperate a group of mobs.  Sold mine a couple months ago. <br /> <br />I understand the issues being discussed here of balance.  And I do not care. <br /> <br />I do not care - give my Ranger a Pet, and I will not ever leave this game!  Never, ever, really.  Just a pet - for my little ranger. Even a rat, though I would prefer a rabid wombat. <br /> <br />Journey far and fare well (though it will be better with a pet!) <br /></p>

<p>Rangers do not need a pet.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think rangers need their spell book revamped, especially where their DOT's and Nukes are concerned.  Give me a 1 sec cast 500 hp DD, with a 10-15 sec refresh, and I would be happy.  My ranger runs around with 100% mana almost all of the time, I wish I had a use for it.   <br /> <br />Casting level 30 druid spells at level 60 just doesn't cut it, the spells don't scale with the content. <br /> <br />Snare does scale with content as do Pally Stuns, in fact I would argue a stun increases in power along with the content.  If a pally can keep a mob stunned on a pull, until the slow lands, this mitigates huge amounts of damage, and is one of the reasons that Pallies leave SKs in the dust as far as tanking is concerned.  Lifetaps have the same problem as the rangers DD's, they don't scale witht the content.  A 300 hp LT doesn't mean anything if the mob is hiting you for 500 a swing, quadding for 2k.  A stun that avoids 2 rounds of combat, has the potential to mitigate 4k worth of damage, this is much more impressive than the 300 hp LT IMO.  If I am missing something, I am sure you will all tell me.</p>

<p>Well I think the New Sony&nbsp;&nbsp;, if you will, is a little more market oriented.  So I do not suspect radical changes. <br /> <br />As far as my Ranger is concerned, I am happy with what he has.   <br /> <br />My only complaint sbout Rangers would be for a ~Melee Class~ The weapons that are avalible suck, compared to other Melee classes,After 60 non Flagged. <br />But then Rangers get to switch to EP Bows (Only class i know that can Buy a EP weapon and not be EP Flaged) .  And High end Melee weapons are on par again once you get flagged. So not really much of a complaint. <br /> <br />I would love a Pet though, more as entertainment than anything, would take the Druid teddybear. But a &quot;Ranger Duck&quot; able to die faster than you can blink. =) It be funny for a week at least. <br /> <br /></p>

<p>I agree will Kullayen give rangers better weapons..but on making rangers have the same level nuke/dots as a druid which was said up above ... then why would you need a druid after that?

The [~Melee Class] thing in my comment is more of my dislike that we are called Melee by Sony when I would rather be Bow.

<p>Just to add a story of why people do want chages. <br />An example was posted on this topic in a rangers forum. <br />Just thought I would throw out why someone thinks classes need to be looked at. <br />Now there was a discussion that went basically like this <br />~ <br /> <br />A BL and a RNG both tanking same mobs over and over switching back. 70 RNG 400 AA's Buffed to 9k&nbsp;&nbsp;BL lvl65 7AAs buffed under 6K. <br /> <br />RNG took more DMG than BL everytime.  Prob is chain class should tank better than a leather class.  But take that to sony and the fear is instead off increasing RNG mitigation or Avoidance they may just nurf Leather class and call it balanced. lol <br /> <br />But the end result is with higher hitting Mobs the Mitigation of all Chain class has made them the worst tanks in the game even behind Leather Class. <br /> <br />Reason  <br /> **** Numbers are made up to illustrate what is happening*** <br />Mob hits for 500 lets say. <br />Chain mitigates it down to 450 while Leather takes 500 <br />Chain aviods 2 hits per 10 and Leather 3 <br />Chain then takes 3600 DMG <br />Leather Then takes 3500 DMG <br /> <br />This will increase as mobs hit harder.   <br /> <br />~ <br /> <br />No with this I understand why people want to change.  No one can say that the game was ever intended to have a leather class out tank a chain.  <br />(not also trying to say a chain class should tank) <br /> <br />But lends to the idea that chain classes are smiling and saying Yea Sony is gonna beef us up.  But my fear would be that Sony make Leather class avoid less or take more DMG.  <br /> <br />Just hope people are carefull what they ask for. <br /> <br /> <br />For me I enjoy my class, if they do something to make my Toon better Yea!!!  But if they do nothing Yea!!!!!  If they nerf something on RNG's (What I have no idea  lol) Boo!!!!  And I think that is how everyone feels. <br /> <br />I think Sony is smart enough to know that rounds of Nerfs will not help them make gamers happy.  And unhappy gamers leave and they are out $$$. <br /> <br />So cross your fingers and hope. <br /> <br /></p>

<p><blockquote><b class="sm">Friar Reinman wrote:</b><hr size="1" />Snare does scale with content as do Pally Stuns, in fact I would argue a stun increases in power along with the content.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a pally can keep a mob stunned on a pull, until the slow lands, this mitigates huge amounts of damage, and is one of the reasons that Pallies leave SKs in the dust as far as tanking is concerned.  Lifetaps have the same problem as the rangers DD's, they don't scale witht the content.  A 300 hp LT doesn't mean anything if the mob is hiting you for 500 a swing, quadding for 2k.  A stun that avoids 2 rounds of combat, has the potential to mitigate 4k worth of damage, this is much more impressive than the 300 hp LT IMO.  If I am missing something, I am sure you will all tell me.<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />You're missing something... ;) <br /> <br />First off, you're talking about &quot;rounds&quot; of combat. There are no rounds in EQ. It's a pet peeve of mine when people say that as though it has any meaning. Mob attacks have delays just like anything else. Pally stuns at the top end last 4 seconds (or alledgedly 10 seconds for the Tranquility/Serenity line, but most people actually time it at like 6 seconds). That may be a couple of swings. It may be more if we chain the stuns. And yeah, that can be a lot of damage. But stuns have their own problems. <br /> <br /> <br />Stuns don't &quot;scale&quot; because they have hard level limits on them. Your ranger's snare spell doesn't have a bit in the description that says &quot;only affects targets up to level 55&quot; in it. Pally stuns do. So your lowest level snare will still have a chance to affect any mob not flagged as unsnarable. My stuns will *not* work on a mob higher then a certain level. <br /> <br />Ok. They're still really useful, right? But they aren't as useful as they used to be. While stuns are still great, and I'm certainly not complaining, they do not &quot;get more powerful&quot; as we gain levels. They get &quot;weaker&quot; over time. Let me explain. <br /> <br />Here's the list of paladin stuns (ignoring the early interrupts), with level to use, stun time, and level effect (and a couple relevant notes) <br /> <br /><pre> Stun                         30     4/55 Holy Might                   49     6/55 <span class="sm">damage</span> Force                        52     6/55 <span class="sm">damage</span> Force of Akera               53     4/61 Quelious Word of Tranquility 54    10/61 <span class="sm">damage,knockback</span>  Force of Akilae              62     4/65 Quelious Word of Serenity    64    10/65 <span class="sm">damage,knockback</span> <b>Ancient Force of Chaos       65     4/65</b>  Force of Piety               66     4/70 Serene Command               68    10/70 <span class="sm">damage,knockback</span> <b>Ancient Force of Jeron       70     4/70</b> </pre> <br /> <br /> <br />Ok. Look at this list. I've separated it into a few sections. I also bolded the two ancient spells, since those may or may not *ever* end up in your paladin's spell list (they're on a separate line, but I'll discuss that later). <br /> <br />Here's why I talk about a loss of power. Look at the stuns in the low 50s. We get *4* in like a 5 level period. Additionally, a paladin at level 54 essentially has <b>five</b> stun spells that he can use to affect any mobs up to level 55 (one level higher then he is). Two of his stuns will even affect mobs upwards of 7 levels higher then his own level. That's not too shabby. In fact, most paladins will pick and choose which stuns to load, we have that many. This is literally the &quot;golden levels&quot; for paladin stunning. We can lock down pretty much any mob that we would be likely to ever be tanking. Coincidentally enough, 55 is *also* the cutoff level for pacify, so this is doubly golden in that we're also the best indoor pullers at about this same time period as well. <br /> <br />Ok. Let's level our paladin through the next set of stuns. As he levels from 54 to 64, he gains two more stuns, but now is much more likely to be fighting mobs that only his higher level stuns affect. He's gained 2 stuns, but lost 3 if he's fighting anything over level 55 (which he will be by level 64 in a group). Also, he's traded in some pretty effective stuns (note the durations on force and holy might) for some less effective ones. The Quellious line is nice, but it's mana expensive, has a knockback *and* a damage component. They're also much slower to cast, so they're harder to use in combat. <br /> <br />Um... And in many camps you're going to be doing at level 64/65 will have mobs higher then level 61. Golems in PoV are level 62. Everything in BoT is higher then that level. So if you're lucky you've just lost one stun. In most cases, you've lost <b>three</b> stuns, leaving you with only 2 usable stuns in many camps (one of which is less then ideal to use also!). Going from 5 stuns affecting mobs at or near your level to 2 stuns affecting mobs at or near your level is a *huge* reduction in effectiveness. <br /> <br /> <br />Post 65, the story gets even more grim IMO. There are a ton of 66+ mobs in OoW and DoN. You effectively have now been fully reduced to two stuns, and one of them is the less then desirable damage/knockback/slowcasting/mana-inefficent line. Also remember that every stun upgrade from that point on is not an &quot;extra&quot; stun, but a replacement (they grey out the cast of the lower stun in the line). So even if you are fighting level 65 or lower mobs, and would *like* to have Force of Akera and Force of Piety both loaded up, you still only get one stun. So it's not just that we lose on numbers of stuns against higher level mobs, we don't even gain more stuns to use against mobs lower then us either. <br /> <br /> <br />Our stunability never approaches the level it was back when we were in our mid 50s. Never. Sure. We're blocking more damage for each second of stun, but that's just damage scale. Everything else scales the same way. Tanks have more AC and HPs. Healers have more efficient heals. Improved focus items add even more. Mobs do more damage in direct relation to the group's abilities to slow/mitigate/heal that damage. Pally stuns don't really gain anything there. Every other class got slows that slow at a higher percentage, and nukes that do more damage, and heals that heal more damage, right? But pallys over those last 10 levels get stuns that reduce the percentage of damage a mob does over time by *less* then they did before. Would you consider a slow with a lower slow percentage an upgrade? Nope. Most wouldn't. But in the case of stuns, we're given the equivalent of a lower value &quot;slow&quot; that's an upgrade because it'll affect mobs of higher level, while the old &quot;better&quot; one didn't. Hmm... <br /> <br />The absolute best you can do at level 70 is if you have the ancient spell *and* you've spent the AAs for your AA stun (celestial stun IIRC). That brings you up to 4 stuns that affect mobs your level or lower. 2 4 second stuns. 1 &quot;10&quot; second stun, and 1 6 second stun. Contrast to the 2 4s, 2 6s, and one &quot;10&quot; that we had at level 54 (two of which affected mobs *higher* level then us!), and then realize that you had to get an ancient spell and spend AAs to get them, and it's not an increase in power at all. It's a straight relative decrease. <br /> <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong. I'm not complaining about paladin stuns. They're pretty much the only really unique and useful thing that my class gets. I'm not even that upset about the &quot;upgrade&quot; method used for stuns (I'm mostly pissed that they increased the mana cost on them when they should have decreased it or actually &quot;improved&quot; the spells in some way). I just think that many people seriously overestimate the power of those spells because they don't understand the extreme limitations placed upon them. They don't realize that stuns don't get more powerful as we level, they get less powerful. We can use fewer of them, they have shorter durations, and they cost more mana.</p>

That's a nice story. But it has absolutely zero relevance unless it's actually true! I'm sure someone posting this on a ranger's forum wouldn't maybe exagerate the relative tanking ability of BLs compared to rangers. <br /> <br />I'm only half joking here. Take the two characters you just listed and the Ranger will outtank the BL every single time. Not by a little bit but by a *huge* margin. <br /> <br />It's somewhat silly to use a fake and made up example as a reason why some might want class changes. There are plenty of *real* reasons, but BLs outtanking Rangers isn't one of them. <br /> <br />Now. If you'd been talking about the BL pet out tanking the ranger, you might have a point, but that's a totally different issue. Heck. There are times when *I* get outtanked by pets (was grouped with a level 70 mage from the top guild on my server recently and felt pretty darn useless). That's definately an issue, but again not one I think can or should be resolved by simply increasing the relative tanking ability of a half a dozen classes.</p>

<p>Heres how I see it. They have to nurf some or beef-up others in order to make some classes more appealing. Most of the classes have a 1 track mind for the most part but a few are very versatile....NURF. <br /> <br />As far as the undesirable classes, in order to make them more desirable without making them into a weak version of another class they would have to be given a distinct advantage over another class. Essentially making another class less desirable. <br /> <br />I'm seeing alot of nurfs comming up. Minor but numerous. <br /> <br />Hey. Maybe us druids will get a new pet =) Maybe it'll be a lvl 5 spiderling and we wont get it until 65 this time. /sigh =(</p>

<p> I think some of the trouble with peeps who like to solo or forced to solo ( I am one of them ) is that the higher lvl zone where you can get good exp as one poster here has already noted the mobs hit too hard / fast what have you. <br /> So you are stuck in zones with crapy exp which takes hours to even get a few blue somtimes. <br /> So you say get a group? Hmm well maybe before wow / eq2. Now you forced to try and solo unless you like to sit on your ass for hours waiting for groups. Personally I have only time for a few hours a day to play let alone try to get a group. <br /> I play a 63 Troll BL and love it , but I cant solo&nbsp;&nbsp;mobs in say BoT / most OoW zones just as and example where you might just get decent exp. <br /> <br /> So maybe there is a need to &quot;revamp&quot; some classes or &quot;revamp&quot; some mobs...maybe make mobs easier if say there is only 1 or 2 players in a group such as EQ2 has done ? I dont even know if it is possible to do this in EQ1, maybe the game cant be tuned that way as it is an old morp or maybe it can. <br />  <br /> I have played EQ2 for like 3 months and liked alot of it but I found it hard to leave my 5 years of EQ1 with 4 chars over lvl 60 and many other low lvl toons. I like EQ1 bazaar better then EQ2 ,, or did untill they changed bazaar lol. <br /> <br />  Anyway just a few thoughts from an old timer.  <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> </p>

You being a tank should have noticed, especially on slowed mobs that the damage comes in, for lack of a better word, &quot;rounds&quot;.  Is that a fair enough explanation? <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Gbaji wrote:</b><hr size="1" />Stuns don't &quot;scale&quot; because they have hard level limits on them. Your ranger's snare spell doesn't have a bit in the description that says &quot;only affects targets up to level 55&quot; in it. Pally stuns do. So your lowest level snare will still have a chance to affect any mob not flagged as unsnarable. My stuns will *not* work on a mob higher then a certain level.  <br /> <br />Ok. They're still really useful, right? But they aren't as useful as they used to be. While stuns are still great, and I'm certainly not complaining, they do not &quot;get more powerful&quot; as we gain levels. They get &quot;weaker&quot; over time. Let me explain.  <br /> <br />Here's the list of paladin stuns (ignoring the early interrupts), with level to use, stun time, and level effect (and a couple relevant notes)  <br /> <br /> <br />Stun                         30     4/55 <br />Holy Might                   49     6/55 damage <br />Force                        52     6/55 damage <br />Force of Akera               53     4/61 <br />Quelious Word of Tranquility 54    10/61 damage,knockback <br /> <br />Force of Akilae              62     4/65 <br />Quelious Word of Serenity    64    10/65 damage,knockback <br />Ancient Force of Chaos       65     4/65 <br /> <br />Force of Piety               66     4/70 <br />Serene Command               68    10/70 damage,knockback <br />Ancient Force of Jeron       70     4/70 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Ok. Look at this list. I've separated it into a few sections. I also bolded the two ancient spells, since those may or may not *ever* end up in your paladin's spell list (they're on a separate line, but I'll discuss that later).  <br /> <br />Here's why I talk about a loss of power. Look at the stuns in the low 50s. We get *4* in like a 5 level period. Additionally, a paladin at level 54 essentially has five stun spells that he can use to affect any mobs up to level 55 (one level higher then he is). Two of his stuns will even affect mobs upwards of 7 levels higher then his own level. That's not too shabby. In fact, most paladins will pick and choose which stuns to load, we have that many. This is literally the &quot;golden levels&quot; for paladin stunning. We can lock down pretty much any mob that we would be likely to ever be tanking. Coincidentally enough, 55 is *also* the cutoff level for pacify, so this is doubly golden in that we're also the best indoor pullers at about this same time period as well.  <br /> <br />Ok. Let's level our paladin through the next set of stuns. As he levels from 54 to 64, he gains two more stuns, but now is much more likely to be fighting mobs that only his higher level stuns affect. He's gained 2 stuns, but lost 3 if he's fighting anything over level 55 (which he will be by level 64 in a group). Also, he's traded in some pretty effective stuns (note the durations on force and holy might) for some less effective ones. The Quellious line is nice, but it's mana expensive, has a knockback *and* a damage component. They're also much slower to cast, so they're harder to use in combat.  <br /> <br />Um... And in many camps you're going to be doing at level 64/65 will have mobs higher then level 61. Golems in PoV are level 62. Everything in BoT is higher then that level. So if you're lucky you've just lost one stun. In most cases, you've lost three stuns, leaving you with only 2 usable stuns in many camps (one of which is less then ideal to use also!). Going from 5 stuns affecting mobs at or near your level to 2 stuns affecting mobs at or near your level is a *huge* reduction in effectiveness.  <br /> <br /> <br />Post 65, the story gets even more grim IMO. There are a ton of 66+ mobs in OoW and DoN. You effectively have now been fully reduced to two stuns, and one of them is the less then desirable damage/knockback/slowcasting/mana-inefficent line. Also remember that every stun upgrade from that point on is not an &quot;extra&quot; stun, but a replacement (they grey out the cast of the lower stun in the line). So even if you are fighting level 65 or lower mobs, and would *like* to have Force of Akera and Force of Piety both loaded up, you still only get one stun. So it's not just that we lose on numbers of stuns against higher level mobs, we don't even gain more stuns to use against mobs lower then us either.  <br /> <br /> <br />Our stunability never approaches the level it was back when we were in our mid 50s. Never. Sure. We're blocking more damage for each second of stun, but that's just damage scale. Everything else scales the same way. Tanks have more AC and HPs. Healers have more efficient heals. Improved focus items add even more. Mobs do more damage in direct relation to the group's abilities to slow/mitigate/heal that damage. Pally stuns don't really gain anything there. Every other class got slows that slow at a higher percentage, and nukes that do more damage, and heals that heal more damage, right? But pallys over those last 10 levels get stuns that reduce the percentage of damage a mob does over time by *less* then they did before. Would you consider a slow with a lower slow percentage an upgrade? Nope. Most wouldn't. But in the case of stuns, we're given the equivalent of a lower value &quot;slow&quot; that's an upgrade because it'll affect mobs of higher level, while the old &quot;better&quot; one didn't. Hmm...  <br /> <br />The absolute best you can do at level 70 is if you have the ancient spell *and* you've spent the AAs for your AA stun (celestial stun IIRC). That brings you up to 4 stuns that affect mobs your level or lower. 2 4 second stuns. 1 &quot;10&quot; second stun, and 1 6 second stun. Contrast to the 2 4s, 2 6s, and one &quot;10&quot; that we had at level 54 (two of which affected mobs *higher* level then us!), and then realize that you had to get an ancient spell and spend AAs to get them, and it's not an increase in power at all. It's a straight relative decrease.  <br /> <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong. I'm not complaining about paladin stuns. They're pretty much the only really unique and useful thing that my class gets. I'm not even that upset about the &quot;upgrade&quot; method used for stuns (I'm mostly pissed that they increased the mana cost on them when they should have decreased it or actually &quot;improved&quot; the spells in some way). I just think that many people seriously overestimate the power of those spells because they don't understand the extreme limitations placed upon them. They don't realize that stuns don't get more powerful as we level, they get less powerful. We can use fewer of them, they have shorter durations, and they cost more mana.<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />A 4 second stun mitigates/avoids proportionate amounts of  damage at level 65 then it does at level 10 and therefore it scales with content.  A 50 hp DD only really &quot;fits&quot; into one level range in the game and therefore does not scale with content.  I hope you can see the difference. <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">ctrumps wrote:</b><hr size="1" />I agree will Kullayen give rangers better weapons..but on making rangers have the same level nuke/dots as a druid which was said up above ... then why would you need a druid after that? <hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />Please quote what you are referring too, if it is to what I said below then read it again, because I never said Rangers should nuke or DoT like Druids. <br /> <br /> <br /></p>

<p><blockquote><b class="sm">Friar Reinman wrote:</b><hr size="1" />So when you are talking about &quot;swings&quot;, you are encompassing double/triple attacks, and bash/kick into a single swing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that is why people refer to it as a round.  You being a tank should have noticed, especially on slowed mobs that the damage comes in, for lack of a better word, &quot;rounds&quot;.  Is that a fair enough explanation?<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />It's still a misrepresentation. A &quot;round&quot; implies a specific time period (ie: mobX gets 3 attacks per round). No such thing exists in EQ. The rate at which each mob swings is different. So a &quot;round&quot; of swings from one mob might occur every 3 seconds, for another it might be 5 seconds, for yet another it might be every second. Then, when slowed, the rate of those swings decreases by the amount of the slow. <br /> <br />I'm just pointing out that it's incredibly misleading to talk of stopping &quot;rounds&quot; of attacks as though a &quot;round&quot; is some quantifiable quality. It's not. <br /> <br />Additionally, with regards to stuns, they don't actually prevent the attacks, they just delay them. Something that is critical to the difference between a &quot;round&quot; and just having delays on your swings. If there were actual combat rounds and I stun you for a round, you just lose your attacks that round. Next round, you start out as normal. But stuns don't prevent the delay cycle from continuing, they just prevent the swing from happening until the stun ends. The instant the stun stops, all the swings that are &quot;waiting&quot; occur simultaneously. It's one of the reasons why you'll see a paladin tank and take no damage for 10 seconds, and then get pummeled into the dust in the next 4 or 5 (which can throw off clerics who aren't aware that just because I'm not taking damage right now does *not* mean they can expect that rate of damage to continue). <br /> <br />Why is this different? If we had actual rounds, then we'd have a time period in a round when you'd attack. let's say that a round consists of 4 seconds (just to make things cleaner). Let's also say that your weapons have a &quot;delay&quot; that determines when they go off during that round. So a fast weapon might go off 1 second into the round, and a slower one would go off 3 seconds into the round. Double and tripple attacks would be managed somehow (either go off right then, or spaced out over the rest of the round after your delay has been reached). That's how round based game systems work. It's totally different then the delay based system that EQ uses. <br /> <br />The key difference is in an ability like stun. In a round based combat system, that 4 second stun would simply stun the mob for a round. So if his attacks normally went off 3 seconds into a 4 second round (delay 3), he'd just lose his attacks for the round he's stunned and start the next round over. In effect, that stun stopped him from attacking for 7 seconds since the first 4 (full round) he's stunned, and then he starts over on round 2, attacking 3 seconds into that around. With a delay based system, that doesn't happen. He'd normally attack 3 seconds after the start of combat. But because he's stunned for 4 seconds, his attack is delayed until immediately after 4 seconds ends. Then 3 seconds later he'd attack again. The point being that in a round based combat system, after 8 seconds (two rounds), the stunned mob would have gotten *one* swing 3 seconds into the second round. In a delay based system, by 8 seconds into the game, the exact same stunned mob would attack on second 4, then again on second 7, and be 1 second into his next swing on second 8. Note, that that's actually only put him one second behind what he would have been anyway if he'd not been stuned at all (non-stunned mob would have attacked on 3, then 6, then been 2 seconds into his third swing by second 8. <br /> <br />Technically, I'm ignoring something anyway. Delays accrue after swings, so the mob actually would get a swing on second 0, then 3, then 6. A stunned mob would actually be reduced significantly for that first 4 seconds assuming that the paladin drops his stun perfectly just before the mob would have started swinging (that's an artform btw!). In practice, you only recieve a significant dps reduction from mobs if you can chain 2 or more stun spells together to effectively &quot;slow&quot; the mobs overall rate of swings. Which is why this can be a problem. There are level ranges where you will only have *one* stun spell that works on the mobs you are fighting. For example, from level 66 to 68, a paladin will only have *one* 4 second stun that he can use for mobs his level (and up to 2 levels lower!). That's clearly a significant power reduction from when he was able to chain stun up to 5 stuns against mobs his level or lower back in his mid 50s. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />A 4 second stun mitigates/avoids proportionate amounts of  damage at level 65 then it does at level 10 and therefore it scales with content.  A 50 hp DD only really &quot;fits&quot; into one level range in the game and therefore does not scale with content.  I hope you can see the difference.<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />Of course I see the difference. But that's not what was compared. Someone compared snares to stuns, and implied that pally stuns somehow became *more powerful* while a snare did not. No one was talking about DD spells. <br /> <br />I never argued that a stun doesn't scale proportionately to the mobs you are stunning. Of course it does. 4 seconds of stun is relatively equal in value to 4 seconds of stun regardless of level of the mob. But can you not also see that a snare is of the same value on a level 70 mob as it is on a level 1 mob as well? And can we not also agree that a 75% slow is of just as much value on a level 70 mob as it is on a level 1 mob? Those are all &quot;proportional&quot; spells. They have an absolute effect on the mob they are cast on. <br /> <br />My issue is that there was an implication that paladin stuns got more powerful in relation to the mobs, and that's absolutely not true. The snaring ability of a ranger is just as relatively effective at level 70 as it was at level 55. The slowing ability of a shaman or chanter is just as relatively effective at level 70 as it was at level 55. But the stunning ability of a paladin is much less at level 70 then it was at level 55. It is proportionally less effective exactly because the more stuns a paladin can affect a given mob with, the greater the total effect his stuns will have. A shaman only needs to get one slow to land, and he's done. The mob's damage is reduced by X percent. A ranger only need to get one snare to land and he's done. The mobs movement is reduced by X percent. A paladin much continually chain stuns to significantly reduce the damage output of the mob. By reducing the number of stuns he's got that can affect the mobs he's hunting from 5 to 1 or 2, that significantly reduces the effectiveness of his stun spells. I'm not talking about how effective a single 4 second stun is. I'm talking about the fact that at level 55, that stun was a 6 seconds stun, and he had 5 of them. At level 66, he's got *one* 4 second stun that will affect mobs his level or higher. That's an absolutely *huge* reduction in power.</p>
