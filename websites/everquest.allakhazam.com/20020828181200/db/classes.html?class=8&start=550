	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ok, This at times really chaps my hide. I have a lvl 47 Half-Elf Druid. Yes your reading it right a Half-Elf this was my first char, and i wasnt really aware of classes or races but knew i wanted to be a druid half-elves just looked better then all the other races at the time. Well first thing i got was man your dumb creating a Half-Elf they suck. Because of there wisdom being so low and other stats. That is true in a sense, but if you look at it correctly i have with my Druid pretty close to the same amount of mana that my lvl 47 Druid halfing with a base of 115 wis and item buffed of 179 well my characters base is 95 and also gear buffed at 179 we have calculated our mana and have the exact same amount of mana. The only diffference i see is that he gets his wis up there higher. Explenation i mean he has a base of 115 so if he had my items his wis would be higher but i still dont have a full suit of wis armour. So i can still get&nbsp;&nbsp;200 wis easily. Also one of my friends got grief about making a half-elf warrior because they are so called weak thats so untrue at higher lvls it doesnt matter your items and other characters spells more then make up for the low start so make what you want and dont listen to all that crap. 8) and most of all have fun 8)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I agree with you. So many people give you crap if you don't choose your race "right". There is enough ability Items in the game to make any race good at its given class. Period.<br><br>Yes some races have perks like ultra vision or regen. Even the unstunable fronts which makes some players say makes ogres the best warriors ever. Bull! Its a game. Even more so its a role playing game. <br><br>Maybe someone made the choice to be a gnome cleric because of the uniquness. Maybe that WE warrior isn't the most efficent choice.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Ok i have a Druid who is LvL 26 on Bertoxx.  I feel i have an easy way to get to lvl 14 pretty fast (bout 3 days playing all day).  After you hit LvL 14 LvLing up is kinda slow but you'll get there.  In order to do this you have to be bound in QEYNOS and not really care bout making money.  This works best if you have a higher LvL character and twink your Druid a little.  I sugest giving him a FS weapon, at least on peice of armor to boost wisdom, all jewerly slots filled with wisdom stuff,  50pp for spells, and a sheild.  This will run you about 250pp, which is nothing if you are LvL 26.     <br><br>1-4<br>      To get to LvL 2 the first thing you need to do is go into North Qeynos and kill them snakes and bats.  Then once you get to Lvl 2 go into killing fire bettles and Klitior bettles.  When you get to lvl 3 i suggest kill the same thing because this will work your skills up pretty nicely.  After killing thing for a little bit you'll hit 4.<br><br>5-7<br>     Now that you are LvL 4 you need to go into Qeynos hills.  There your target will be Large bats, Grey Wolfs, Brown Bears (i know your not supposed to kill animals but you want to LvL fast don't you), and Giant Rats.  This will take you to LvL 5.  Now your LvL 5, Gnoll killing time.  The Gnolls have to be the single most reason people start Half Elf druids.  You kill the gnolls by Blackburrow (dont go into BB yet).  Don't go after the Watchers yet cause the spawn in three's and could kill you quick.  You kill the gnolls and loot their fangs (note: very important to loot ALL fangs you can).  Keep killing the gnolls and looting their fangs till you hit 6.  Then when you hit 6 keep killing the gnolls and keep looting their fangs.  You can move to the watchers but i dont recamend it if your not twinked.  Keep killing the Gnolls till you hit 7.  The reason you stay and kill them till you hit 7 is to agian work on you skills and because you want lots of fangs.  <br><br>8-10<br>     By the time you hit lvl 8 from killing gnolls you should have mabey 2 stacks of Gnoll fangs.  This is where you LvL FAST.  Go into South Qeynos and go into the Warrior guild there will be a guy in there named Captain Tillin.  You give him the fangs 4 at a time.  Now watch you exp sky rocket.  With this quest you should hit about LvL 10 mabey 9 and a 3/4.  He give you some king of lightston and you can take them to the Fish and Ale.  There is a guy in the back his name is McNeal.  Give him 4 stones and you get a little exp and 4 Blackburrow Stouts.  if you dont hit lvl 10 go back out and kil more gnolls and get more fangs.<br><br>11-14<br>     These LvL's are the easiest to get to, the hardest part is finding a group to get in.  Your target for these LvL's are bandits in Western Karana.  Just get in a group and kill them.  They drop Bandit sashes you want to get as many as possible but your group will probally want them too.  Take the sashes you get and turn them into the Paladin Guild a guy named Chesguard Sweden.  He gives you a bronze weapon and pretty good exp.  Just do this till your lvl 14 and you get SoW.  <br><br>14-16<br>     For these LvLs all you need to do is go into Northern Karana and get in a group to kill Griffions and Beetles.  They are hard to bring down but with a Warrior, Cleric, Mage, and Druid (you) they will come down pretty easy.  Kill them till lvl 16<br><br>17-19<br>     After you hit 16 its time to go into Eastern Karana.  In here you want to hunt just bout everything.  I didnt really hunt in here much but i did for a little i forget the names of thing but if you get in a good group and sit at the ramp to Highpass and pull to there you'll LvL nicely.  You should do this till bout 19.<br><br>19-25<br>     After you hit 19 it's time to go to the Aviak Village in Southern Karana.  Here you'll find lots of birdies to kill.  You can find this place from heading directly south of the bridge.  Once here get ready to kill.  Once agian you have to get into a group.  You'll be here for awhile but not to long mabey 2 days tops.  Fight at the bottom of the village till you hit LvL 21.  After this it is time to go into the Penthouse.  This is right above the bird city just follow the path up.  Here you'll find Aviak Avocets (the drop a Aviak charm which is used for Crafter Armor quest) they are tough to bring down but with a full group you'll be able to do it easy.  Stay here and kill till bout LvL 23 the go to the Spires.  The spires are the bid towers outside of Splitpaw.  Your target here will be Tesch Mas Gnolls.  You can fight them till bout lvl 30 but i have only got to lvl 26.<br><br>     Well everyone i hope this guide help you some if anyone has any questions E-Mail me at Dragon3334@aol.com.  Or give me a tell on Bertoxx my name is Dracoone.<br><br>Dracoone LvL 26 Druid<br>May Karana light your path. <br> <br>  <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Go to Steamfont. Make sure you have Treeform and Ward summoned. Watch where spawns come. Find a spot where you can pull what you want and Treeform. You can pull Elementals to you. Or Drakes. Maybe harpies if they con a lvl you can handle solo.<br><br>You med faster in Treeform and get other pluses I don't remember. This is great loot and xp for this lvl.<br><br>You can also get into a group fairly easily as a druid for Mino caves. I can't even remember how many times I had people trying to pillage me out of my current group for the mino caves.<br><br>Play with steam for a couple of levels. Once you are around lvl 12, find a partner or two and play with the Nybright sisters in lesser fay for the drunkard's quest. You can also start getting into groups to take on yard trash in Unrest. Both of these are great xp. Unrest is really dangerous but once you get the hang of it, really worth it. DO NOT camp in the front. I can't stress that enough. Camp the back yard. You can avoid most trains there.<br><br>Around Lvl 12 you can also head over to Lavastorm. Again, ward summoned is great here because everything but the basks (which you want to avoid like the plague), rock dervishes, and drakes are summoned. The Lava crawlers can be taken down easily with a partner (always bring a caster like a mage) and yeild bloodstones about 1 in 3 kills. Good ratio for a jewel drop. They also sometimes drop bloodstone rings. Or was that the drakes? anyway, there is good loot.<br><br>All the zones I mentioned are GREAT xp and GREAT loot, which is always a bonus cause lvl 14 spells taint cheap.<br><br>I'd stay away from Oasis. I found it to be a phenominal waste of time. Oh, if you hit Lavastorm, find a cleric to team with and hit befallen. The first level will probably be a sleeper, but you should be able to find some stuff. It's a neat dungeon, but it is indoors, so be aware of that. <br><br>Tatiyanna<br>Mommy Druid of Ravensveil<br>&nbsp;<br>"In waking a tiger, use a very long stick." -Mao Tse-Tung.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Assuming you are a woodelf or half elf starting in Kelethin:<br><br>lvl 1-4 Okay, you have to take the time on this. Good thing, even untwinked you can hit lvl 4 in about 4 hours if you are diligent. Fight&nbsp;&nbsp;your newbie mobs. Lvl 1- bats. wasps if other wasps aren't around. At lvl 2- add orc pawns. And get brave with wasps. At lvl 3- add pixies (I suggest waiting because gaurds will not help you with them if you get in trouble) and widow hatchlings.<br><br>Tips: Ok. 1. until you can afford bags, kill mobs in stacks. That is, go after, say all bats and skeles or all bats and wasps. Drops are almost always stackable, except rare for wasps (which is sack and sells for 3g to merchant). Kill until you have full stacks or you have a rare drop and then sell. This makes it go quicker. Don't worry if you die, you don't lose xp yet. just get your corpse.<br>2. Do not sell the following to merchants if you want to make REAL money. Batwings, Bonechips, Spiderling Silks. Sell them to players instead. You can get 2-3pl, 5+pl, and 5-10pl respectively for stacks of each. spiderling silks here aren't always common drops, so they sell well to tailors and the occassional bard.<br>Don't kill wolves. YOu're a druid. Wolves like you.<br><br>If you get orc hatchets, turn them in to the ranger's guild. Same with Pixie Dust<br><br>Lvl 4-7<br><br>Group for Orc Hill. Collect as many belts as you can. If you've made good money from above suggestions, buy belts from others if you want. Once you have banked about 3 back packs worth, truck over to Kaladim. give them to Canloe Nusback and gain a lvl and some ex on the side. :)<br><br>This should get you to 7 easily.<br><br>Lvl 7-10 <br><br>Group for Crushbone. In a group, you can probably take down some red cons, especially as you approac 10. Tip for Red cons. Let caster try to cast on it. If it resists, run and yell TRAIN TO ZONE. If it doesn't resist, fight and try to keep group healed as possible. Just don't be stupid. Go after reds rarely. Also, I don't suggest them until you are around lvl 8 or 9. If you are constantly pulling reds to zone, people are going to get real annoyed with you. also, only do it with a full group and a prime healer, like a cleric.<br><br>10-12 with ward summoned and treeform, go and fight in Steamfont. You can solo eles in Treeform or group for other mobs. <br><br>12-14 find a partner or two and play with the nybright sisters in Lesser Fay. Collect all 4 necklaces, and turn them in to the Drunk in kelethin. Talk to the cleric in the paly guild in felwith first.<br><br>also, get in a full group and go play in Unrest. This is a great zone. Dangerous, but rewarding. once you get used to it, you should have little difficulty, as trains really are avoidable, since you will camp the BACK YARD. never camp front.<br><br>From 14, there are any number of things. You have SoW, so you can kite in the karanas. blah blah blah.<br><br>Important thing, I just got out out of the newbie stages.<br><br>Tip. save some of you bone chips early on and turn them in to the cleric in felwith. You want to do that so you can do the tunare series of quests later, assuming you are woodelf or a druid of tunare. all woodelves are, but i don't know if half elves are or not<br><br><br>Tatiyanna<br>&nbsp;<br>"In waking a tiger, use a very long stick." -Mao Tse-Tung.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hi, all.<br><br>I'm a lvl 11 half-elf druid on SolRo and it feels like I've been trying to get to 14 and SOW (and bind!) FOREVER! No matter where I go, the xp is SLLLOOOOWWWWW. It took me a HUGELY long time to get from 10 to 11. <br>All I care about it getting to 14 and SOW. Yeah, I want ports and all the other goodies that come with higher lvls, but 11 to 14 has become the bane of my existence. All my other chars seems to be lvling just fine, including my lvl 20 shaman.<br>I've been scouring the websites looking for tips and hints on lvling fast for 11-14, but there's so much conflicting info, I just don't know where to go. I am hoping for some place with great xp and fast lvling, but I need to keep decent loot in the equation too cause I'm POOR :) <br>I made my way to WC and hunted there for a while, but I like being amiable to wolves and bear, so there wasn't a whole lot there for me. I don't group much because I never know how much time I have and I hate to leave a group unexpectedly...especially right after I joined it!<br>Someone said I should start over and play a wood elf cause of higher starting wis, but I hate to do that when I am having such a hard time lvling now. But, that's off the track :) Sorry. <br>I have heard many times that Steamfont is great xp<br>but some say it can take u to 14 and others say only 11. I'm already 11, so I hate to get bound in Ak'Anon and then find out I need to go someplace else.<br><br>Thanks for your help :)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>OK I hope this helps I just made a druid about 2 weeks ago and made lvl 22 last night.&nbsp;&nbsp;What I did from 10-14 was kill wisps.  Kill as many wisps as possible get the greater lightstones and lightstones.  Once you get a backpack or so full of GLS and LS pay the 15pp for a port to NK and ask for a sow and camo.  Head NW to the gypsy camp and give the stones to the gypsy who gives you the quest when you hail her.  I was getting a full blue and then some for each gls and a good piece of a blue for normal lightstones.  You can sell the books from the GLS for 6-7pp each and the ls get a few silver not a big deal the EXP is important.  That got me enough money and exp to make lvl 14 and buy all of my spells.  At lvl 14 I went straight to lavastorm.  Kill even,  yellow and red flame elementals lava crawlers imps and anything else that is summoned.  I did this to lvl 18.  I made 18th in 2 days about 2-4 hours a day camping by the najena zone in case things go bad.  There seem to be a lot of spawns there to keep you busy. The loot here is OK you get bloodstones and words.  Bloodstones can get you 3 gold or so each at the druids or gypsies in the same zone.  At lvl 18 I went to NK and killed griffawns and anything else blue or even to me to make lvl 19.  At lvl 19 I got new spells and headed to EK killing Crag Spiders.  Made lvl 20 in abuot 3-4 hours.  At lvl 20 I discovered a quest in Lake Rathe that gets you over 1 full blue bubble each time.  What you do is go to the island SE of the first one from the SK zone.  There is a little gnome guy who starts the mage epic.  Hail him and start the quest.  Bind here and port to WC go find the roaming guy in the back forget his name but the quest tells you and give him the coin.  Gate back and do the same thing over and over.  I made 2 lvls in about 6 hours of doing this and maxed out tracking and my casting spells.  This quest supposedly takes you to 29th,  but I am not so sure it will be too good after 24th.  I hope this helps.  <br>Ichytharus 22nd halfling druid of Fennin Ro<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I never liked whirling wind because it always seemed to have a high resist.<br><br>Root seems to let up quickly when you are nuking.<br><br>I suggest the following:<br><br>before going into battle, put up the following buffs: <br>Your highest Skin, which I think is still wood.<br>Thistlecoat<br>Strength of Earth<br><br>Now, mem the follow:<br>Gate, Thistleshield, FireFist, Snare, Root, Flame Lick, Ignite<br><br>Now, go find your mark.<br><br>Once you've found him:<br><br>Cast Snare (since it is low resist) and Root. If you root him,perfect. Now, cast Flame Lick to lower his AC and Ignite away.<br><br>If root is holding, feel free to sit down and med a little. Watch for snare and root to lift. If you are far enough away, even when root lifts, he is still moving slow from snare, and you can root him again before he gets to you.<br><br>Nuke him down to around half HP. Now, cast Thistleshield and Firefist on yourself. Go in and melee him. Don't worry that you are melee'ing a warrior. He's taking damage every time he hits you. With thistlecoat up, he is taking about 6 or 7 each time, plus what you are dealing, so you should be about on par with him. AND his AC is down.<br><br>If he runs, root him again (just like you would an npc mob). <br><br>Make sure you conserve just enough mana to gate out if his buddies come or things go badly. Gate is really much more useful if you are in a battle situation where you are solo.<br><br>You can do this either way, nuke then melee, or melee then nuke. Try both, see which you like.<br><br>Remember, Thistleshield and Firefist aren't just for Tanks. They are also to help put you on par with tanks.<br><br>Have fun!<br>&nbsp;<br>"In waking a tiger, use a very long stick." -Mao Tse-Tung. Did he go to Stonebrunt too?</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Most people are tempted to solo druids a great deal. There's nothing wrong with soloing as long as you:<br><br>Keep a speed buff on at all times<br>Keep a strength buff on at all times<br>Use Befriend animal/charm to have an animal pet. An earlier poster's advice on using snakes or cats is excellent.<br><br>However, those of you asking how to level fast? Never ever forget about grouping. However, in a group, your role can be much different! The first point, DRUIDS ARE NOT TANKS, NOR SHOULD THEY MELEE UNLESS ANOTHER HEALER IS PRESENT.<br><br>During your grouping career, unless there is a cleric present or someone else that can heal just as well as you, you should be healing, buffing and snaring, not meleeing! Never put a DD buff on yourself if you're in a group. Keep it on the tank. Keep all folks meleeing buffed with strength, and snare all the mobs. Once this is done, med and heal when necessary. <br><br>Another tactic you can take is to work with the puller. You cast Harmony on the group of mobs, then let the puller reel one in for the group. After a mob has been pulled, then snare it.<br><br>If you are not the main healer, you can nuke the mob's pants off, but still save enough mana for a damage shield on the tank. Tank if you like, but make sure you never go below 50 mana. This can be very important if a situation gets out of control as you can root mobs and keep SoW up on all group members so that everyone can get to a zone line if necessary.<br><br>The only time you should be meleeing is if you aren't needed to heal, and aren't needed to buff, i.e. there's a shaman and a cleric in the group. Then you can do just about anything you want, but frankly, most shaman are going to be better at melee than you are as they're larger races with more hp and strength. In this case, nuke.<br><br>There is nothing worse than a druid who melees the whole time when the druid is the only one in group who can heal. I've been playing EQ for about a year and a half now and these tend to be the tactics that work best in groups. Soloing a druid is pretty easy for a druid and there are a ton of guides on how to do this, but if you want exp faster, grouping is the way to go, especially since the exp plusses have been added to a group.<br><br>If you're unsure of what you should do in a group, discuss it with group members! Clear communication on what each person's role will be will almost always insure better exp for everyone and few, if any, deaths.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Dienia Tallis - Druid<br>Baila - retired Shaman<br>Sigrid - Shaman<br>Iantha - Cleric<br>Phedre - Rogue<br>Pyria - Wizard</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>To the person that started this discussion, even though you're a shammy (may have a Druid alt), I 1000% agree with some of it. +25 druids that are still meleeing every pull, sit your asses DOWN. Nothing makes the hair on my back stand straight up like grping w/ a showboating Druid. You reduce grp efficiency dramaticly by doing this crap.<br><br>When you melee, you can't med. A druid is way more effective snaring, DD'ing, healing, and DoTing. If your grp doesnt have a ranger, it's your responsibility to snare. On multi-pulls, you dont have to snare each and every one. Save your mana and snare the last one standing. Remember mobs dont run when its more than 1. If DD'ing, only DD 2 or 3 times, then med. Don't get caught up in the "Imma show my grp I can kill quick" game by mana dumping every pull. You're Oom constantly as a result of nuking too much, and the downtime because of your overexuberance slows the exp for the entire grp,i.e. them waiting 5-7 mins for you to be RFP. As a DD'er, we are average, let the true DD'er nuke the most. If you're the only healer(really shoulda gotten out of grp when the other healer left), Heal and med. Snare if grp wants, but you med and keep mana up. As a druid, if I am the only healer, I wannna be known for keeping tanks alive and keeping downtime as low as possible. It's Ok to tell the grp to give you a min to med cause we all know we cant, and never will be able to heal as good as a cleric. Can't blame you if your grp just grinded out 1/2 to 1 full yellow, you medded when not healing, kept them alive, and you're 20m. Pat yourself on the back, as others will to. That calling "OOM!" bull@#%^ every 5 mins gotta stop. Learn the character 1st, then play it. A good druid is one that conforms to the needs of the grp. Seeing to many garbage druids and its pissing me off. There are hundreds of sites for your use. Use them.<br><br>Side note. I personally dont think a druid would make a wise 1st choice of a character. Druid spells past lvl 14 are high maintainance. Think they started getting to be like 10pp per. And they only get worse after that. Buy all your new spells and a 150-250pp reciept will be in your hand. I say maybe start w/ a melee class, that way you loot more, and dont have to resort to killing bears in EC and WC to buy your spells (some of you know what Im talking about).<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hmm... anyone else think it's funny a Shaman is on giving druids advice? About not trying to melee in fights so much? Let me ask you, past level 25-30 or so, which Wis class has the worst habit of ignoring heals and jumping into melee... (glares at the barbarian shaman, but glares admitadly harder at the troll ones)<br><br>Well some of what you said is true, you showed a lack of knowledge in druids in not even mentioning our DoT's. Just a reminder to you, our DoT's stack with near all others in the game, and they're magic based, so unlike your poison and diseased base ones ours are almost unresistable do to fewer mobs having high magic resistance. Hell a mob has to be at least 5 levels Red to me for it to even have a better then 50% chance of resisting me on them.<br><br>If your a group druid popping that DoT on the Mob can be very useful. While you Med, your DoT eats away at the opponent, often for 60-80% better mana efficency then had you DD'd him.<br><br>Also the Str buff. That was for the most part pointless. We Druids are Kite masters. the measly Str bonus we get before the 30's doesn't make enough of a differance to warrent the mana that could be better used. Save it for groups on tanks. To some folks the extra damage might help their style, but to many others it doesn't make a differance. To say we must keep it up 'at all times' shows you need more experiance soloing as a Druid. That spell is definetly a personal call on the druids part and not required. May i remind you that 3 of the 4 shaman races have str in the 100+ range, while non of the druid races have it in the 80+ range w/o bonus points. May i also remind you your Str buffs are more effective and diverse then ours, so for you it may be a good tactic to have it up at all times when soloing, but not so for druids because while you may kite similiar to us, you do not kite IDENTICALLY to us.<br><br>As for your group advice... groups looking for healers should have gone to the Cleric and Shaman first... if they're using a Druid as the primary healer thats NOT a good call. We can augment any group, but since we get Regen at later levels then you, and Healing tied with you, and since Clerics DH better then all of us, any group looking for a Druid to heal should also have had the common sense to incorporate one ranger or paly in it's tank department so we can get some help healing.<br><br>In a last ditch, we're the only healer, once in a week you get stuck in group... what you said does carry relevance, but otherwise we're better used to augment the groups roles, not take them over.<br><br>I suppose the big point here is to remember what druids are. We are 2nd-3rd best in many spell catagories of the game... but never or rarely 1st in any. The best way to properly use a druid in a group is when you already have a DD and Healer and you have the Druid on for assistance, like you would an enchanter. By healing some time, DDing some time, Buffing sometime, DoTing sometime, etc we take the work load off the others and enhance the overall groups performance. Expect us to DoT like a shaman/necro, DD like a wizard etc... well you'll get whats coming to you. We're like a turbo-charger in an engine. Put us in and we'll make it all run faster... BUT you still need the engine or we'll just blow hot air.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Just to add my 2cp on damage shields, DoTs and Melee:<br><br>If I am grouped with a fighter type (ie only him and I), I cast a damage shield on the tank only when 2 or more mobs are on him. Multiple mobs on a single tank with a DS can be very mana efficient (and the tank really appreciates killing one mob only to find the other is already at 75% health).<br><br>Be careful of who you DoT when there are multiple mobs. In a larger group where tanks are 'assisting' one another, the target will tend to fall quickly so the DoT doesn't get full effect. Also, you do not want to DoT the mobs that are not being actively attacked by the fighters because, as sure as the sun will come up and a prom queen will go down, you'll piss the mob off and he'll be on you. Again, this is general advice and there are exceptions (mostly based on your group's make-up).<br><br>As to the 'to melee or not to melee' question: I personally took time to solo and melee (in between grouping) right up to 25-26 level. Yes, I totally sucked at it and a blue would smack me around like a plaything. But my combat skills (especially defence and dodge) did go up. I felt it important to get my combat skills up (defensive once in particular) as later on in life my Dots, healing and DD spells would result in a mob aggro-ing on me till the tanks could get it off. <br><br>If practicing your melee skills (between 14-25 level), buff yourself up as much as you can (ALWAYS have SoW on), pull the mob with snare and stick your strongest DoT on it, then melee it and let it beat the tar outta you. Once you have had enough, root it, back off & heal (re-DoT it if needed) then go back in for more punishment. It is slow, painful and humiliating (passing warriors will stop to watch the fiasco and start placing bets *against* you) but your melee skills will go up and that could save you down the line (see the last sentence in the paragraph above).<br><br>This has been my experience and style. It has worked well for me, find what works right for you (trying to avoid any flames). The barbarian above was correct in that we will never be tanks and that waving our club/staff/falison (sp?) at a mob (post 25th or so) tends to have pathetic results.<br><br>Silean on Luclin&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hi! I'm Tatiyanna, a 16th Season Wood Elf Druid.<br><br>Okay, here is what I know for lvling, some of it I know by not doing :( <br><br>Ok, even though you don't really care about loot for yourself personally, I would suggest building it up when you are able. While Buffs go a long way to helping newbies, being able to donate the occassional armor or plat is always a good thing. Heh heh, I know. :) Also, if you team up with a 'chanter, the two of you can pool your resources and his/her mana to make good enchanted Jewelry for newbies, with hp, mana, stats, protections...<br><br>And it so happens that the places I am going to suggest do also have good loot...<br><br>Ok, you don't care about quests, but I would suggest playing with a couple that involve mobs you are fighting.<br><br>Pixies: there are a couple of quests for pixie dust in Kelethin (rangers and rogues guilds) and you can rid the world of those pesky buggy chicks AND! get xp for killing them, as they are probably even to you or blue.<br>Bats: Save bat wings, because you'll want them come lvl 14. I would save about 75% of them. The rest I would give to Niola Impholder in Felwith, in the mage's guild. For a spell, sell it back to her, and XP. <br>Orc Pawns: Some of them drop Orc Hatchets, which you can turn in at the Ranger's guild for xp and something else, but I don't remember what.<br><br>I suggest these because it is basically extra xp on mobs you are already killing in the newbie area. The pixie dust for Rangers is also a free bag until you turn it in :)<br><br>Once you are around lvl 5, head to Orc Hill. You can get a group, or if there are enough people on the hill, solo. Fight Orc Cents and get those belts! Put them in the bank and hold on to them.<br><br>Stay around orc hill until about lvl 7. You should get some good xp here. By lvl 7, you should be able to get a group for Crushbone. Depending, you can do this at lvl 6, but only with people who are 7 or 8, and who know what they are doing.<br><br>Mid way through lvl 7, you should have a good number of Orc Belts. Hightail it to Kaladim and turn them all in until you ding lvl 9. If you don't have armor yet, you have most of the components you will need now. You will have lots of extras. Put together sets so that you have stuff to give away later, and pull some out to sell.<br><br>You should still be bound at Kelethin. Gate back and head to the guild. You are lvl 9 now. You should have enough money banked that you can buy your lvl 9 spells. Get Treeform, Ward Summoned, Light Healing, Thistle Coat, Shield of Thistles, and Ignite for sure. Sell your extra armor peices here. <br><br>You have some choices. I would hang around Crush for a little longer. You can get into groups and get good xp at Slaver Caves for a while. Free slaves for merchant faction. (this will be good, because better faction = better prices, and you can buy/sell for people who are kos or just outsiders to gfay for better than they'd do on thier own). It is also extra xp for killing orc slavers.<br><br>Around Lvl 10 or 11, go to Steamfont. If you want, you can already head there at lvl 9, depending on if you are bored with Crushbone or not.<br><br>At Steamfont, you can use Treeform and solo Elementals, drakes, etc. Use Ward Summoned on eles. It is a great spell to have. Elementals sometimes drop gems,and so do drakes. If you are inclined, save them for enchanting jewelers later. You can bank them in bags or boxes, and they are stackable.<br>You can also group here for Mino Cave,which is really great xp in this zone.<br>You can stay in steam until probably lvl 12.<br><br>Welcome to Lvl 12. I would like to introduce to you two things.<br><br>1. lesser faydark and the sister camp<br>2. dagnor's cauldron and unrest keep<br><br>Starting really at lvl 10 or 11 you can get a small group and go pick on the Nybright Sisters. Again, great xp, a fast spawning camp, and a quest that you can complete (xtra xp for killing them) in Kelethin. Save what you get to give away, but if you get the bearskin gloves, wear them. I love mine<br><br>At lvl 12, go to Unrest. This VERY dangerous zone is a great place to lvl in your teens through the 20's, dispite the dangers. Even the blue mobs give excellent xp. When you first come here, start in a large group until you are used to it, then you can get a smaller group. Camp the back yard and take out yard trash until your 20's, when you want to get into a near-full group again and start into the house.<br><br>Now, for teens, everyone says "oasis oasis oasis". I hate oasis. i really didn't find the xp to be that great, the zone was too crowded and i tended to die of stupid things because people around me were either too lagged to help or simply wouldn't help. Also, while loot isn't important, you will need money for your spells, and Oasis isn't the place to get it. Great that you can get up through 19, and probably to 24 in oasis. So, you got your lvl, how you going to get your spells, hmm?<br><br>That ends my oasis rant. Lake of Ill Omen is supposed to be really good. But, it is also VERY crowded and only accessible if you have the Kunark expansion, which some of us don't yet. ;)<br><br>Alright, you should be able to play around in Unrest until lvl 14. Now, hightail it back to Kelethin. You should have plenty of money for your spells because Unrest is just sooooo wonderful for loot. Hey, if you loot a pristine carapace, which you will, stop in Kaladim. There is a guy at the warriors guild who will make cool armor for 23gp. It is worth it, because while you can't use it (gnomes, dwarves and halflings only) you can auction it later or give it away. It is very nice armor. So, bank it. <br><br>Okay, now you have SoW, and so begins your saint whatever career. :) <br><br>We are quickly hitting my lvl of expertise, because I am only lvl 16, but I will atleast get you to where I am and on your way to the 19 and 24 marks.<br><br>Start travelling. You can get all your great travelling spells, SoW, Lev, etc. And Bind. Start Auctioning your SoWs and Binds where ever you go. This will get your name out there and people will know to come to you when they have need of buffs now and ports later. Oh, offer to give free food and water, since you can summon it. Just remind people it is norent<br><br>You want to travel. Because it does little good to dump someone somewhere and not be able to tell him how to get where he is going. If you study the maps, yeah, that is ok. But it is better to travel the zones and be able to warn and advise travellers. :) <br><br>Go to Freeport first and learn your way around. You can do Binds and SoWs at West Gate. You will get LOTS of takers.<br><br>Now, head out to East Commons. If you have a regular to partner with, drag him along. Otherwise, find someone, a tank preferably or a mage, and go to Nektulos and head to Lavastorm. Sneak past the guard with Camo.<br><br>If you have the Mage, play in Lavastorm for a while. You still get good xp on blues. Lava Crawlers are what you really want to hunt, and they are easy to take down with Expulse Summoned. I have even taken down yellows solo with it, but was oom after. You'll loot bloodstones. Save them for an enchanter, as mentioned above. Same with any other jewel that you find. Watchout for fire eles, they agro. so do sprites, and they hurt. Leave basks alone. The Shadowed Men don't wander unless pulled.<br><br>when done playing in Lava, or if you aren't with another caster, then pick on the guard outside Lava. PUll him from inside the zonecavern to avoid iron and stone guardians. He will be good xp for a while, and will vary in lvl. He hits hard so let a pet or tank tank him, and keep them buffed. They have strong resists to snare and hail, but not to fire, so I use ignite on them. Use either snare or swarm to pull them.<br><br>Once you get the hang of the guards, you can play with the ones on the bridge. I would head back out to commons and find someone to share the bridge. You take one side, they take the other. If you don't you will end up pulling the entire bridge in one pull. These guys have a HUGE agro radius and a HUGE social radius. But they are GREAT xp, drop a bronze sword every time, AND sometimes words,which you can give to caster friends for research.<br><br>If your saintly side feels bad about hunting guards in someone elses newbie zone, look at your faction hits. You are striking at the Indigo Brotherhood for making that infernal alliance with the Orcs in Gfay. :) Hee hee one of my guild's tag lines<br><br>Other places to go ehre for the teens: Befallen, which is hidden off of West Commons. the first lvl will probably be green to you, but keep going down. You'll find stuff. There is an xp bonus here. Read LVL. It is a dangerous zone, but seems to be worth it (I've not really gotten to explore it yet, but it looks wonderful from what i've seen). This is also loot heavy, but you gotta save for spells :)<br><br>In your mid-late teens you can group for HIgh Pass hold, another good place for xp. <br><br>Remember that armor? Well, head to Rivervale. You can either auction it to a halfling druid (and whatever other class can wear it) or give it to a newbie one. which ever.<br><br>Now, head out the the Karanas. You want the Karanas zone that is right out of HIghpass. Don't remember which it is. <br><br>This is a great zone to kite and charm animals. You should have befriend animal. I would suggest charming a green cat (they hit hard) and letting it tank something tougher. Greens stay charmed longer. You can give it the /pet commands. woo hoo. And it is so nice to see a cat charm amiable for a change. :)<br><br>Kite here for a little while, using SoW and snare, or fearkite animals with a panic animal and a pet. You can solo. Or group to take on Crag Spiders. Have your heal poison spell memmed. Very important. I would suggest a mage to help you with them, and use charmed cats. Griffawns (FAWNS) are good xp too. Two people with pets can take these easy and it is still good xp. <br><br>when you are ready to travel again, head to Qeynos. You can visit surefall if you need druid spells still. <br><br>There is little for you to do here at your level, but explore and get to know the land. People will want to come here, and you can give them a quick where-to-go.<br><br>Done? ok. Go to (erk, erk) Erudin. The only thing you care about here is getting to Stonebrunt Mountains. This is supposed to be like LOIO and is supposed to be great xp. It should carry you through your 20's if you want.<br><br>I suggest heading back to Dagnor's Cauldron in your late teens. You can group there for goblins. These guys are DEFINATELY great xp. Between Dag and SBM you should be able to make it through your 20's. Kite in the Karanas for a change of pace. If you have Kunark, there are supposed to be great kiting zones there too.<br><br>Ok, I hope this helps.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>"In waking a tiger, use a very long stick." -Mao Tse-Tung.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Okay, I don't normally play on pvp. I have an enchanter on, I think Rallos, for when Qell is down or I don't want to hear "but I lost my corpse" on the guild channel. <br><br>I'M KIDDING! really, on the guild channel part. I'm kidding. I'm a good guild mommy.<br><br>But, from what I've been reading on PVP's. The worst places for PVP are probably going to be Lavastorm and maybe Oasis. But I would avoid oasis anyways because it is a waste of time, and Lava is not a must. It is just a really great zone.<br><br>If you are lucky and aren't on when pvp dweebs are on, then you will be fine when on Feydwer. If you are worried about Steam, find a spawn point for what you want to hunt away from the mino caves. Few people will notice you, and you will be in Treeform.<br><br>My other tip for pvp is ALWAYS stay anonymous or in /roleplay mode. This keeps people from knowing what you are in /who queries and hunting you down. tee hee<br><br>Also, unless said druid is hunting people on pvp, someone would have to be a total dweeb or STUPID to go hunting druids. Druids can be your best friend because of SoW, Ports, and killer buffs. Everyone is always begging me for SoWs on Quell. If I as on PVP and someone killed me, then wanted SoW, I would laugh, then use the tactics I described later for pvp fighting. :)<br><br>Okay, before I get flamed for my above post. Treat PVP's like mobs with brains (making assumptions there, but hey *wink*). <br><br>Gee, i'm feeling my p's and q's.<br><br>Only stupid people, IMO, are going to pvp you in a dungeon. Unless they are high enough lvl not to be agro'd. Them, I call jerks. anyways, we all have better things to worry about in dungeons than attacking other players. Besides, you might need help from those players so DON"T ATTACK OTHERS IN A DUNGEON!!!<br><br>and, um, this was in reply to someone on tunare. Last time I was on Tunare, it wasn't PVP<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>"In waking a tiger, use a very long stick." -Mao Tse-Tung. Did he go to Stonebrunt too?</td></tr>
