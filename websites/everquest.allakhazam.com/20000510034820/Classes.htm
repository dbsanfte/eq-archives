<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The choice of what class
to play is really one of personal preference.&nbsp; They all have advantages
and disadvantages.&nbsp; One major factor in your choice of class is whether
you plan on grouping or playing alone.&nbsp; There are some classes that
just aren't suitable to play solo.&nbsp; Read the descriptions carefully
before picking a solo class.&nbsp; Of course, every class is fun to play
in a group, and grouping is really encouraged in the game design.&nbsp;
Therefore,&nbsp; I would suggest you choose your class based upon how you
would like to play in a group.&nbsp; This needs to fit your personality
and how you like to play within the game.&nbsp; I see the classes in three
categories (with some crossover of categories):</b>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><img SRC="wpn129.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" height=32 width=32 align=BOTTOM><b>&nbsp;
Fighter Types - or tanks as they are referred to in the game - including
Warriors, Paladins, Rangers, Shadow Knights,&nbsp; Monks, and maybe Rogues.&nbsp;
Clerics, Shamen, Druids and Bards can fill this role in a pinch, as can
the pets of Necromancers and Magicians, but not very efficiently.&nbsp;
These classes see the most action.&nbsp; They are always at the forefront
of every battle, and they rarely find themselves out of the action.&nbsp;
If you like wading into every battle, shouting bonzai, and hacking off
heads and limbs, this is for you.&nbsp; Because every party can use multiple
fighters, you will never be at a loss for a group.&nbsp; However, these
classes are tougher to solo and lack the means to travel and to extricate
themselves from tough battles that the magic classes have.&nbsp; The first
time you have to run back to town to buy stuff, you will really envy that
magic user's gate spell.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lack of the ability to bind can
also be frustrating to a tank.&nbsp; It is also very expensive to buy equipment
for most of these classes, and heaven help you if you die somewhere where
you can't retrieve your corpse, forcing you to repurchase all of your armor
all over again.</b>
<p><img SRC="symb005.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" height=32 width=32 align=BOTTOM><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Magic Support, including Clerics, Enchanters, Shamen, Bards, and Druids,
and to some extent Magicians and Necromancers (though they really fit the
third category better).&nbsp; These classes, while possessing some offensive
skills (especially the Shaman, Bard and Druid), are far more valuable in
how they enhance the skills of other party members.&nbsp; Most of them
are very difficult to solo (except the magician, druid and necromancer).&nbsp;
Their primary role is to buff the fighters with enhancements and defenses
and debuff the monsters to make them easier to hit and kill, then stand
back and let the fighters do the dirty work.&nbsp; Their role in a battle
is then support by healing, charming, etc.&nbsp; They are also very useful
for traveling, healing, sneaking around and other non combat related stuff.&nbsp;
You may enjoy these classes better if you are the type who likes to role
play more than just kill and level.&nbsp; The healers are also supposed
to keep track of the hit points of each party member and keep them from
dying.&nbsp; If you chose one of these classes, you should be happy with
the fact that while you may not be the hero that demolished the monster,
you were the one who made it possible for that hero to do his job.&nbsp;
Every party needs one or two of these classes, especially the healers.</b>
<p><img SRC="wpn059.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" height=32 width=32 align=BOTTOM><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Magic Attack, including Wizards, Necromancers and Magicians, and to some
extent Druids.&nbsp; These classes have the ability through firepower and
summoning to quickly kill monsters when the fighters start to get low,
and most importantly, kill off the monsters who break off and run for help
before they can summon their big brothers to whoop your butt.&nbsp; This
is especially true of the wizard, who has no crossover and really only
fits into this category, yet does it best of them all.&nbsp; Except for
the wizard, These are the best solo classes in the game.&nbsp; If you play
one of these classes, you have to be prepared to sit back and patiently
bide your time while the fighters bash at the monsters, conserving your
mana to strike where it is most effective and, for necros and magicians,
directing your pet to the most useful area.&nbsp; You should also be prepared
to spend a lot of the game staring at the inside of your spellbook, meditating
to get back spent mana.</b></blockquote>

Bard</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>Bards are almost always welcome in a group.&nbsp; However, be warned
that they do not make a great solo class.&nbsp; While they are not as good
at any particular thing as any of the specialized classes, they do a little
of everything.&nbsp; They can cast, tank and heal as circumstances dictate.&nbsp;
No other class gets the variety of spells and skills that the bard gets.&nbsp;
Bards can also cast forever since they don't use up mana when they sing.&nbsp;
Such ablilties as heal, mana regeneration, find corpse, accelerated travel
and group invisibility make a bard invaluable group members.&nbsp; While
the bard only does one thing at a time, he does it real well.&nbsp; And
a good bard is able to twist as many as three songs at a time to get multiple
effects.&nbsp; If you are a social person who likes meeting new people,
the bard may be for you.&nbsp; If you like to go off on your own a lot
or are shy about travelling with strangers, you may want to think twice
about playing a bard.&nbsp; I once saw a pretty well reasoned argument
on a message board that the most powerful group you could put together
would be 6 bards.</b>

Cleric</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>This is the most popular class in Everquest.&nbsp; Not for people
trying to play them, but for people trying to group with them.&nbsp; Clerics
rarely have difficulty finding a group.&nbsp; If you play a Cleric you
will have lots of friends, since a Cleric is an absolute must for a well
balanced party.&nbsp; AD&amp;D has ruined the reputation of Clerics.&nbsp;
They are such wimps in that game that nobody wants to play them.&nbsp;
This isn't true in Everquest.&nbsp; Sure, Clerics are most important for
their healing and curing abilities, but Clerics are pretty decent fighters,
especially at lower levels, when given the chance, and you don't want to
go after undead without one around.&nbsp; Still, a Cleric's main job is
to keep the party alive, and in a well balanced party, you will mostly
buff, heal and med.&nbsp; Clerics are able to wear full plate armor, giving
them a level of protection unmatched by other spell casters.&nbsp; Coupled
with your heal spells, you should be able to keep from dying a lot.&nbsp;
One thing you should know is that Clerics are constantly in need of money,
because they have to buy both spells and heavy armor.&nbsp; This is a class
for the person who likes to socialize and wants to be welcomed wherever
he goes.</b>

Druid</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>This is probably the most popular class in the game.&nbsp; You will
find plenty of druids in your wanderings.&nbsp; This is because it is probably
the best solo class.&nbsp; There are three things that druids do better
than others - travel (camouflage, spirit of wolf, and solo or group teleports),
damage shields (great for long combats), and playing with animals (sense,
charm, buff them, terrorize).&nbsp; The other great thing about a druid
is that, while they are not the master of any one thing, they are the best
class to fill in the gaps that a party has.&nbsp; Need a healer?&nbsp;
Druids are the second best (tied with Shaman) next to Clerics!&nbsp; Need
extra firepower?&nbsp; You got it - not quite as good as a wizard, magician
or necro, but still very good!&nbsp; No Shaman or Enchanter?&nbsp; Druids
have decent buffs as well.&nbsp; Druids also have the tracking skills of
a Ranger.&nbsp; Given time to meditate, they can buff you before combat,
destroy creatures during it, and heal you afterwards.&nbsp; No one else
can do that for just one cut of the experience.&nbsp; Because they have
such a wide variety of skills, Druids are one of the better solo classes
out there.&nbsp; With both SOW and teleports, they are probably the fastest
travelers in the game, letting you cover a lot of ground when you want
to.&nbsp; However, many of their best spells don't work unless they are
outdoors, making them difficult to play in a dungeon, where many of the
best items can be found.&nbsp;&nbsp; Druids are also weaker at each given
area than the equivalent specialty class. This is a good class for a person
who likes to do a little of everything, without being a master of any.&nbsp;

Enchanter</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>The enchanter can be soloed, with a little patiece and care, but
is more useful in a group.&nbsp; It has the weakness of a spell caster
without the attack powers many of the other classes have.&nbsp; However,
Enchanters are very valuable group members.&nbsp; At higher levels, enchanters
are considered invaluable and are probably second only to clerics in popularity
when forming a group.&nbsp; They are sort of an all around magic class,
with a little of every type of spell.&nbsp; They can buff you up to make
you worth about another level and then buff down the monsters to make them
easier to attack.&nbsp; They have some limited attack spells, and have
spells such as root and lull which can make life easier for the whole party
in battle.&nbsp; With an enchanter in the party, the group can take on
much higher level monsters and get a correspondingly higher experience
and gold return.&nbsp; An enchanter's main work includes buffing the party
and lulling unwanted combatants before the battle, and debuffing and playing
traffic cop during the battle via the wide arsenal of stun spells and charm.&nbsp;
Properly played, an enchanter can keep a group of mobs off balance while
the party picks off one at a time.&nbsp; Basically, the enchanter keeps
the party alive by keeping the extra Mobs off the group.&nbsp; In addition,
they receive a number of illusions and environmental spells, allowing the
enchanter to travel anywhere he wants and sell too just about anyone at
a good price.&nbsp; Because of this, faction is less crucial to enchanters
than other classes.&nbsp; Enchanter are also the only class that realistically
can use the jewelry making skill to make magical items.&nbsp;&nbsp; If
you like to group, and don't mind being the one giving support to the others,
this is a good class to play.</b>

Magician</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>This is a very popular solo class, and also valuable in a group.&nbsp;
Magicians are sort of a cross between a fighter and a wizard, because they
can fight with their pet elemental and stand back and cast like a wizard.&nbsp;
Thus, while not as strong as a wizard or fighter in their specialty field,
magicians are able to to do more than either one alone, and the combination
of pet and direct damage spells actually means the Magician can deal more
damage over time than either a fighter or a wizard.&nbsp; They also get
some nice buffs and damage shields.&nbsp; Because a magician basically
comes with a built in tank, it is one of the best classes to solo.&nbsp;
In fact, magician is one of the few classes that can continue to solo effectively
even at higher levels.&nbsp; If you plan on playing on your own a lot,
but still want to be a damage dealer while in a group, this is a good class
for you.</b>

Monk</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>The monk is supposed to be the best fighting class in the game in
terms of dealing out damage over time.&nbsp; In addition, Monks are able
to resist fire better than other classes, getting + 8 to fire resistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Because he can't wear heavy armor (weight is very important to a monk),
he takes more damage when hit,&nbsp; but the monk's natural quickness allows
him to avoid more hits than other fighters and hit the enemy more often.&nbsp;
A monk's weapons are his fists, as well as the magical special attacks
he gains as he advances in level (which provide some great looking animations).
Monks also get some excellent 1HB weapons, so many monks are now using
some weapons.&nbsp; Monks dish out some incredible damage, since they get
dual wield and double attack very early, resulting in many attacks per
round.&nbsp; No other tank class can match them at this.&nbsp; They also
get some useful skills such as feign death, which is a great skill for
avoiding death and pulling, mend, which heals 25% of their health, as well
as safe fall.&nbsp; If you play a monk, you will definitely fill the role
of a tank in a group.&nbsp; This is not a great solo class, but it can
be soloed with a lot of patience.&nbsp; Only Humans and Iksar can play
a
Monk.</b>

Necromancer</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>This is one of the best classes to solo.&nbsp; The combination of
a strong pet and damage over time (dot) spells makes the necromancer able
to solo creatures most other classes wouldn't think of taking on.&nbsp;
Of course, since most NPC's hate the site of you, you may find it necessary
to solo.&nbsp; You will also find that you are unable to play in certain
zones where the good NPC's will try to kill you when they see you.&nbsp;
Like the magician, the Necromancer has the combined ability to summon a
skeleton to work as a tank and then stand back and blast away, but the
necromancer's dot spells are arguably more powerful combat spells than
the mage's dd spells.&nbsp; While not as strong as a fighter or a wizard
in either specialty, the combination of skills can be pretty deadly.&nbsp;
The biggest drawback of a necromancer is that you are evil.&nbsp; In many
areas, you areKOS to the shopkeepers and can't even get a shopkeeper to
sell you food.&nbsp; Travelling is very difficult, and you can't rely upon
the guards in most places to help you out.&nbsp; Although many who play
a necromancer choose to play solo much of the time, Necromancers are very
useful in a group.&nbsp; With their pet and spells, they give the group
both a tank and a battle mage in one package.&nbsp; This is a difficult
class to play, but is a good one if you want to spend most of your time
soloing.</b>

Paladin</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>The paladin is a combination fighter and cleric, although probably
more oriented towards the fighter side.&nbsp; You get the attack abilities
of a fighter and the spell casting of a cleric. Paladins are also more
resistant to disease than other classes, gaining +8 to disease resistance.
Because they have a limited healing ability, Paladins spend a lot less
time sitting on their butt than regular fighters.&nbsp; Nevertheless, they
are really a tank with some healing ability rather than a substitute for
a cleric.&nbsp; The Lay on hands skill is like getting a get out of jail
free card.&nbsp; Once per day you can avoid almost sure death by completely
healing yourself.&nbsp; In a game where you spend a lot of time looking
for your corpse, this means a lot.&nbsp; While not quite as powerful as
a warrior, you are still pretty good at dishing out punishment and can
take a pretty good licking.&nbsp; In addition, some of the more interesting
weapons in the game can only be used by a Paladin.&nbsp; When you play
a paladin, you have to keep in mind that you are the embodyment of good.&nbsp;
This means that NPC's with an evil bent will not like you very much.&nbsp;
This can lead to some problems navigating some of the cities with a strong
evil presence such as Freeport.&nbsp; Like all of the fighter classes,
Paladins can be soloed on a limited basis, but are better playing in a
group.</b>

Ranger</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>Rangers are sort of a cross between a fighter and a druid.&nbsp;
Rangers are the best class at using a bow, and the best magic bows in the
game can only be used by a ranger.&nbsp; Also, Rangers have an innate resistance
to the elements, getting +4 to both fire and cold resistance.&nbsp; Tracking
makes this class really shine.&nbsp; This skill makes Rangers welcome in
any group hunting outdoors.&nbsp; Foraging is also a nice skill given to
Rangers.&nbsp; If you have a Ranger you can find the monsters that give
you the best experience or gold without a lot of mindless wandering, and
you can keep a look out for the ones that will kill you on sight.&nbsp;
Rangers are also pretty good fighters and can readily play the tank.&nbsp;
You can't dish out or take as much damage as a warrior, and you are somewhat
limited in your weapon and armor selection, but you can definitely hold
your own.&nbsp; Because of his druid and tracking abilities, the Ranger
is pretty good solo class.&nbsp; Tracking lets you pick your fights and
only engage the monsters you can beat, and warns you when you are getting
near something that can take you out in a hurry.&nbsp; Your spell casting
lets you slow down the foe to better attack or run.&nbsp; Your ability
with the bow gives you the chance to do damage without engaging.&nbsp;
And your fighting ability lets you fight it straight up when you need to.</b>

Rogue</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>Rogues get many unique skills not available to other classes.&nbsp;
Really, this is probably the most unique class in the game.&nbsp; In many
ways, this is why the class is not really a popular one to play, as many
people do not understand how to play, or play with, a rogue.&nbsp; The
most useful skill of a rogue is pickpocketing.&nbsp; All of the rogues
I have played with have disdained looting monster corpses since they make
so much money pick pocketing.&nbsp; Furthermore, since they are limited
in their armor selection and have no magic, they don't need to spend a
lot on armor and spells.&nbsp; Never ignore the benefits of wealth.&nbsp;
Rogues also get the sneak, hide and evade skills which make them very good
scouts and give them the ability to escape from battles where others would
die.&nbsp; Rogues are also more resistant to poison than other classes,
gaining +8 to poison resistance.&nbsp; They can make poison and poison
their weapons to do extra damage in combat.&nbsp; They also get back stab,
which is a great skill to have when grouping.&nbsp; Let the fighter start
in on the creature, get behind it and stab it hard and fast.&nbsp; With
their superior speed, backstabbing, poisoned weapons and dual wielding,
rogues can often outdamage a warrior in a battle.&nbsp; They just have
less of an ability to take damage.&nbsp; They can be soloed, but only with
a lot of difficulty, and are generally much more effective in a group,
even at lower levels. Unfortunately, many people don't know how to handle
a rogue in a group, so it is often tough to find a group willing to take
you in.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a tricky class to play since it doesn't fit
easily into any mold, but can be one of the more interesting and enjoyable
classes.</b>

Shadow Knight</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>This is a very difficult class to play.&nbsp; Shadowknights are supposed
to be the opposite of Paladins.&nbsp; They are basically a combination
of a necromancer and a warrior, leaning more towards the warrior aspects.&nbsp;
Because of the necromancer elements, they are actually a little easier
to solo than other tank classes, getting some dot spells and a pet to help
them out.&nbsp; Yet in many ways, they are also weaker.&nbsp; This class
really comes into its own at the higher levels, but can be very difficult
to get to that point.&nbsp; As with the necromancer, shadowknights are
hated by most good NPC's, and find it difficult to find places to buy and
sell things.&nbsp; It is also difficult to travel, as many NPC's will kill
you on sight.&nbsp; However, this is part of the challenge of playing an
evil class, and an element that many people enjoy.&nbsp; This is probably
one of the least played classes in the game, so it can sometimes be difficult
to find a group that knows how to use your skills.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
if you have the patience to milk it through the lower levels and are willing
to be hated by just about everything in Norrath, you may enjoy playing
this class.</b>

Shaman</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>The shaman is basically a cleric with added abilities from other
disciplines.&nbsp; He can heal, buff and do some direct damage, and in
a pinch can fill a number of different roles.&nbsp; This is a class that
can be soloed, albeit with some difficulty.&nbsp; Shamans get sow (arguably
the best spell in the game) at level 9, making them great for travelling
and exploring at lower levels.&nbsp; The shaman gets great buffs, which
along with your heal skill and dd ability makes you a pretty valuable party
member.&nbsp; Plus you have the added advantage of being able to pitch
in with a weapon and do more than token damage.&nbsp; A Shaman is always
welcome in a group because of his combination of abilities.&nbsp; Since
this is the only true spell casting class for the barbarians, trolls or
ogres, it is a pretty good choice if you are set on playing one of those
races.</b>

Warrior</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>The warrior has an inherent ability to do critical hits, so his critical
hit percentage is greater than any other class.&nbsp; While they get no
magic, the warrior has the best combination of dishing out damage while
taking a licking and still surviving.&nbsp; This makes him probably the
best pure tank class in the game.&nbsp; This is the classic hack and slash
class.&nbsp; Your high strength lets you arm yourself to the teeth and
still carry around a lot of loot when necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp; Warriors get
the highest physical attack ability of any class.&nbsp; A group will feel
much safer knowing it has a warrior up front to take the damage while it
gangs up on the monster.&nbsp; Thus, warriors usually have little trouble
finding a group.&nbsp; This is good, because it is not a great solo class.&nbsp;
The biggest problem with the warrior is the complete lack of magic.&nbsp;
You will really miss having many of the magic abilities of some of the
other classes.&nbsp; If you don't group with a healer, you will also spend
a lot of time sitting down and waiting to heal back your lost hit points.&nbsp;
You have to decide if pure straight up killing is your thing.&nbsp; If
so, this class is probably a good choice.</b>

Wizard</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>Once you get attacked you are in trouble.&nbsp; But, if you have
some nice tank taking the damage up front you can really kick some serious
butt.&nbsp; The wizard's forte is doing massive amounts of damage in a
short time.&nbsp; Wizards also get the best area of effect spells, though
these spells are very difficult to use without drawing a mob onto you.&nbsp;
Other magic classes can do more damage over the long run, but wizards can
kill something quickly when necessary.&nbsp; Wizards also get teleport
spells, which make it very easy to navigate to all corners of the world.&nbsp;
One big drawback is that wizards are the most mana reliant class in the
game, and unlike the pet classes are virtually useless when they run out
of mana.&nbsp; Wizards are fairly popular and can usually find a group,
especially at higher levels where the wizards ability to evacuate a group
in trouble makes him invaluable. The wizard is not an easy class to play.&nbsp;
Because he is all attack and no defense, he must approach a battle warily.&nbsp;
But it is really impressive when you take down that monster in one shot
that the fighters were battling for five minutes.&nbsp; Wizards can be
soloed, but only if played perfectly, and are not nearly as good at soloing
as magicians or necros.&nbsp; If you play a wizard, be prepared to spend
a lot of time staring at the inside of your spell book.</b>
