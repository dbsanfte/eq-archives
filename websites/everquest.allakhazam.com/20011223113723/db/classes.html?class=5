	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hi all, I am not a very avid EQ player.  I play maybe 8 hours a week, at the most, and my main just hit 20.  I have been playing on and off for almost two years.  Hold the laughs please :p But, I love my SK, I started a Dwarven Pally first, he was ok, then a DE war, and I really liked him.  Though, was hard to RP the DE, cuz I needed friends, so couldn't be the stuck-up I hate everyone jerk :p  But, my SK rocks... soloing yellows at 20!?! Awesome! So what if the druids can do it(not flaming here).  I don't train them around the zone.  I Clinging Darkness them, run away a bit, Syphon Strength them, sick my pet, fear them(he can take like 3 or 4 hits, then we chase him down, beating on his back. I Lifespike in between, and cling darkness when he starts to run.  Game over for him :p  Usually lose about a bub and a half, maybe two in life, and half mana.  Some down time, but fun :)  I can also RP, cuz I don't need anyone else :p I can be mean, and still survive.  My pet rocks to, he can bash, to interrupt spels, and his attacks interuppt, and he does like 10 dam per tick :p That's a decent DOT for my level :)  Wait until he levels up at 22 :)  All this is based off of my experience in Oasis, and Timorous deep.  Adds suck, that's the bad part :(  Druids rock, teamed with a druid, I can't be beaten :) But I am just of a more Toe-to-Toe guy myself.  Anyway, that's my idea, wish I had time to elaborate, but at work :p  Later all.<br><br>Morchai<br>20 Dark Elf Shadow-knight of Innoruuk.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I got a question about the hide skill. I play a Dark Elf Shadow Knight. Dark Elves get the hide skill as a natural ability and SK gets this skill at, I think, lvl 35.  Are these the same thing?  If so what skill lvl do Delfs start it with and does it ever increase before we get it at 35? Does the skill work instantly? I notice when I use it that I diseaper instantly but do others still see you for second or 2? If so I would think I would have heard of this as a way to hide/frustrate someone your fighting in PvP (just run behind a tree and hide till your ready for more).<br><br>Thanks for the help.<br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Same skill. I forget the lvl DE's get to start.  Mine never went up until I past 35th lvl.  Found boat rides to be great for raising hide skill.  You hide skill check is made boat moves and unhides you.  Just click the button whenever you can.<br>Even with the skill maxed for an SK at 75 it doesn't work very often.  When you hide you will almost always see yourself dissappear.  That doesn't mean that everybody else sees you dissappear.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Actually their are two ways to use hide:<br><br>1) Con something (anything) that does not con &quot;indifferant&quot; to you.  Try to hide.  Recheck the con, if its indifferant you have hidden successfully.  If not, click it off, wait for it to recycle and try again.<br><br>2) Summon your pet (9th+ level here obviously) and then keep trying to hide until the pet commits suicide.  Your pet will die when you have successfully hidden.<br><br>Special Note: Do not sit and meditate (or even just sit) until AFTER you know you are hidden.  Otherwise by sitting you increase the range at which mobs will aggro you, and make even so that stuff that would normally leave you alone (ie. con/green stuff) will attack.  Once you are hidden, its fine, just don't move until you are done healing/medding.<br>&nbsp;<br>Kadia Coldnight<br>Tier'dal Shadowknight<br>Saryrn Server</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I can't say that there is anywhere on a PvP server that is better than Nektulos Forest for a Dark Elf to &quot;twink&quot; himself.  I posted the post below in the Nektulos Zone list as a quick way to make a few  hundred plat.  Since you are a Dark Elf it should work better for you than it did my Ogre Shadowknight.  Just remember to keep nothing good on you and it doesn't matter if they start knocking you off.  Just get the supplies, take them to the bank and make your product and sell it there.  Hope this helps.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------<br><br>I think Nektulos is much better to level as an Ogre. Quick run to the north at level one since you have nothing to lose, get bound, and commence to making money and levels. Yep, that's right: MONEY. <br><br>I killed all the spiderlings and dawgs I could get my rusty two-hander to split open and within TWO days of about 5 hours play each I was level 6 and had made almost 200 Platinum coin. That's right, 200 Plat. Killing decaying skellies and selling the chips is a pretty good way to make money; but there is a better way. Save the chips (for when you start summoning your own pet if a Shadowknight) and make LEATHER PADDING. What is leather padding? Let me explain. <br><br>To make leather padding you have to be a pretty good tailor. Start out by placing one of your starting points at first level into Tailoring. Then, when you kill spiderlings, take the spiderling silk and put two together to make silk thread; which I think is impossible to fail at because I never once did. Make as many stacks of silk thread as you can kill the little buggers (while gaining xp). You also want to kill as many wolves (and later bears) as you can. Don't make anything out of the hides yet though; just get as many stacks as you can. <br><br>After you have gotten your tailoring up to at least a ten or so, start making silk swatches (which you can make silk armor for monks and casters later) out of regular spider silk. This should help your skill raise even higher. Once you have gotten your skill to at least a 25, whether using points at new levels or just by practice, you can start making armor pieces from the old ruined bear hides you have gathered (you can actually start sooner if you like). You can find the patterns you will need in the Ogre/Troll section of the First Gate in Neriak. You can also purchase your small sewing kit here. This way you can outfit yourself in some armor and raise your skill even higher. By the time you have killed critters enough to get to sixth level and gained about a skill of 30 at least in tailoring; it is time to make money. <br><br>You will most likely need a skinning knife; so ask around to get one. I got mine off of a Dark Elf Necro for 2 stacks of bones; but don't really know where you can get one without making it yourself (which I couldn't). You need the knife to make the hides you have WORSE (combine the knife and the hide in your sewing kit and combine). Yep, worse. What you need are as many LOW QUALITY pelts as you can get; not ruined, LOW quality. Do NOT decrease HIGH QUALITY BEAR pelts however. They are worth a good amount of platinum to people who make handmade backpacks that have 10 slots and weight reduction (which at one time sold for 80PP each on my server; but are now going for only about 50PP). I decided to keep all my High Quality Bear for myself and plan to later make several Handmade packs for myself when I get my tailoring well over 100. <br><br>Now that you have several stacks of spiderling silk and low quality pelts of any kind; it is time to make Leather Padding. All you have to do is combine a single silk thread with a single low quality pelt in your sewing kit; and viola: a piece of leather padding (I did have a few failures here, so be patient; even though each failure basically costs you 5PP). Make as many stacks of this stuff as you can for one simple reason: each stack is worth about 100 Platinum pieces. I had made two stacks by the time I reached mid-sixth level and was well on my way to a third. <br><br>After you have made all the leather padding you can; go to East Commons (unless you are on a PvP server) and auction them off. They may go quickly; unless nobody needs them at the time. People who make plate armors and such need leather padding as one of the ingredients; so it is very valuable. A very good way for low level ogres to get a good start. <br><br>I purchased an Axe of the Ironback and a full suit of Banded Armor for my Ogre Shadowknight before I reached 7th level without being twinked; and had a good bit of Platinum left for purchasing all the spells I would need for later with plenty to spare. It feels really good to be legitimate with my character; and I've went back once since then to make a quick 100 plat this way. Not to mention that casters and monks both pay a decent amount for the silk armor you can make them since your tailoring is getting better. ;-) <br><br>I hope this helps starting Ogres to make some cash; and I KNOW it works, so give it a try. Heck, even if you aren't starting out it is a good way to make money. I have a friend who plays a dwarf that went to Halas and made over 20 stacks of this stuff and is now quite well off! Not going to go to Everfrost with an Ogre though. ;-) <br><br>Good luck to you.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Dec 18 19:56:20 2001</em><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Now, on pvp servers you cant fear, so that ruled that out, but i did fear his pet.  Now, this was a twinked necro and resisted snare and everything, had Jboots and SS, all he would try to do was SS away and cast.<br>     An easy way to counter that was, whenever i saw it say &quot;Necro begins casting a spell&quot; all i had to do was SS away, and hope to get out of range.  Then i got as far as i could and put the only DoT's he couldnt resist, Heart Flutter and Heat Blood.  I was always putting these DoT's back on whenever they wore off.  I only managed to hit him twice, one for 69 and another for 107.  Now, i did lose this duel (those Necro DoT's hurt like hell), but had i had my HT up, i would have killed him.

So unless you are in a bufffest group where you need to leave off the wimpy buffs so there is room for a Celestial heal to take put it up.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>True enough.  If you were going to solo a quest, the starting level would be around 30th and maybe a little higher.  However, the Dreadscale breastplate could be easily completed by someone in there low 20's.  The Large Scropion Chition is sorta a long camp, but can be found by an Iksar Shadowknight of the 21-22nd level.  Then keep your eyes out for a bezerker's brand either at a vendor or run to OT and ask someone it you can buy one or loot one.  They are not lore so often people have mutltiples - I assume to do the &quot;Guard the Docks&quot; quest.<br><br>At 31st level I have the breastplate, gauntlets (Also an easy quest - I just can't remember the particulars) and a bracer.  The Bloodgill scales I found while &quot;roaming&quot; the lake edge :-)  The hardest part will probably coming up with the coin for the different types of gems needed to complete the quest.<br><br>Good luck, Crusader of the Greenmist.<br>&nbsp;<br>Shrikke - Knight of Fear<br>Bristlebane</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Miztress-<br><br>I have nothing against druids and do not flame them. I flame no class, only the players if they talk from their rear. It is my personal experience playing EQ and others I have conversed with that have found that druids are more needed in groups in lower levels thatn higher levels. Just like how groups almost care less for chanters b4 level 22. Once they get breeze/crack everyone loves 'em. At later levels, when the pulls are fast, fierce and deadly with adds- a chanter is almost a must- only substituted maybe by a bard and its mana/haste songs.<br>I have just come to the conclusion that a druid is a very well rounded class. A jack of all trades, but a master of none. That is the truth. It all comes down to loving and enjoying your class. That is all that really matters. Please don't get your pantyhose in a knot over this :p<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Here are a few things I have noticed using FD, and a few of my own questions I hope others can answer. First and most important, practise abjuration at level 15 with endure cold, and get it up to speed! Keep this skill maxed! If you get 15 points below your max, you are too low, start practising again.<br><br>Ok your 30th lvl now and you have one of the best spells in the game, not only will this save your life, you can handle rear guard duty when your group needs to run, and you may even live! You can also use it to break up mobs if there are too many to handle at once (I'm just now working on this, so I hope for input from more experienced players).<br><br>Feign Death is tied to two skills, Abjuration and Channeling. Abjuration will determine your success at casting, Channeling will help you to continue casting if you get interrupted.<br>You can successfully cast FD but the MOB is not fooled, if this happens you see the dreaded, Soandso has fallen to the floor, message. If this happens the MOB will continue to smack you around. <br>You can successfully cast FD but the MOB is still in the process of hitting you. If this happens the MOB believes you are dead until the attack hits. Once you take damage, they know you are faking and continue the attack. This is most apparent when the MOB is a caster, if you see them start to cast a spell after you cast your FD, get ready for some pain. The REALLY bad thing about this, is that FD takes a full 15 seconds before you can recast! <br>Once you FD the mob will drift back to their spawn point. MOBs under 35th lvl will generally forget about you after a FD. Those above will usually not forget about you, especially if they took damage (I have only seen this once so far, but I'm only 40 at the time of this posting). <br>You can FD on a MOB even if they are affected by a DOT you cast. <br>I'd like to hear how others get out of a FD, I'm ashamed to say it took me a lvl or two to find a fast way out, I use /sit off (or your sit button) to quickly get back to my feet. I haven't really tested whether your HP and mana come back at the sitting or standing rate, so if someone else wants to give some feedback I'd appreciate it.<br><br>Pulling with FD looks to be a cool new way to break up multiple MOB's. I have just started trying this, but here is what I've tried so far. If you have a large pack of MOB's, pull the entire crew to a safe spot. Feign Death on them...make sure you are facing the way you came from. The MOB starts to leave singly or in pairs. If you change your view so that you see the surrounding area, you can see how far off the other MOBs have gone. You should end up with the last one or two MOB's standing around when all the others have left far enough away that you (or your party) can attack. Just remeber that higher lvl MOBs might remember you when you come out of FD. You may need to camp or zone to clear aggro while your party takes out the MOB.<br><br>Much of this information was based on observations from others on these topics, so thanks to those who have posted on this before!<br><br>BTW don't just use endure cold as practise, Goblin shammies and wizards use cold based spells, this does have a use other then practising, spend some time in SolA =)!<br>&nbsp;<br>Daemondred Dreamslayer 41th knight of Innoruuk<br>Luclin</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I've posted about feign death in another thread, can't really recall where right now though so I'll recap some of my points. Always click of attack before fegning. Trying to fool mobs into thinking you are dead while attacking them is a doomed venture, you'll only have alot of unsucessful attempts and that usually hurts alot.<br><br>Unlike the monks our fd is a spell and it comes fully stocked with all the disadvantages of spells. First off you have a casting time and secondly you run the chance of being interrupted. Now, this leads to sort of a level dependancy in the shadowknights fd. Basically, you can probably feign up to about three blue mobs or even more in some cases but it's a game of chance trying to feign two red ones, and not with very good odds at that. Reason for this is two red mobs will hit you alot, pushing you back a good ways and increasing the chance of an interrupt in the casting. Blue mobs usually don't hit you that much and not with the same amount of movement. I have an amusing little anekdote from SG where our monks had called it a night and I was the only fd'er left in the party. We were facing two of the seahorses and wanted to split them since we weren't exactly full force ( if you've fought these creatures you know what I mean, they hit hard and fast ). Being somewhat experienced with fd at that time I offered to try and split them, knowing full well that I was basically comitting suicide. They were indeed red but I aggroed them and proceeded to trying to fd. It was really quite amusing when I woke up in Kael and scrolled up to see what the hell happened. First 4 lines were red damage lines. Then came <br><br>You begin casting... <br>You are interrupted... <br>6 red damage lines... <br>You begin casting...<br>8 red damage lines...<br>You are interrupted...<br>4 red damage lines...<br>LOADING...<br><br>The horsies split very nicely but you could've sent in a level 30 wizard and achieved the same results =) For a monk this would never have been a problem, their fd is instantanious. On the other hand I've pulled KC with no problems at all, fd splitting up to 4 blues ( what can I say, the trains in there are horrendus ). Going above a certain number of blues will also spell certain death. I'll never forget the time we were returning from ghost of Kindle in The Hole and my ivu dropped. I had about seven or eight mobs on me and I only managed to attempt to fd once since I was stunned the entire time until loading message. Same thing here, for monks it doesn't matter if there are three of eight mobs, feign is instant and I've gotten the impression that the act is stacked for monks, meaning that if you feign while stunned the actual fd will come as soon as you're unstunned. Another thing about red mobs is that you usually only have one chance of feigning due to the long recast time. If you fail and are facing two or three red mobs chances are that you're dead before that gem pops again. Pulling multiple casters is also a tricky business. Trying to time the feign becomes close to impossible if you have three fast throwing casters ( Chardok comes to mind ).<br><br>About aggro of level 35+ mobs. Yes, they will have a hard time of forgetting you after you've feigned. The chance of a wipe of the hate list is however greatly increased if the mob returns to it's spawnpoint before you stand up. Another method of loosing the aggro is waiting until you can cast again and then quickly stand up and feign a second time ( followed by additional times until your sure you're in the clear ). Every feign will increase the chance of you being removed from that hateful aggro list.<br><br>It may sound as I am disregarding feign death as a useful ability for the shadowknight but nothing could be more wrong. The shadowknight is an excellent tagger among other things. Tagging being the tactic where you feign in a predesignated spot and a monk puller brings a bunch of mobs to that spot, feigns and then you take one or two of them back to the group. Feign death will save you many times through your gaming career, running through higher level zones and picking up some aggro along the way. If you happen to overdo the main tank in a raid with an unfortunate spell all you need to do is fd and the aggro will be back on him in a flash.<br><br>To summarize:<br>Always turn off attack.<br>Pick your battles carefully, even when pulling blues it's not wise to overdo it.<br>Multiple reds means you better be damn sure you succeed in your feign.<br>Multiple casters means trouble ( most often four spells death )<br>Level 35+ aggro is tricky, mobs returning to spawn point and multiple feigns will greatly increase your chance of a successful fd.<br><br>I'm very interested in seeing if the improved feign death changes any of the above. Received at level 60 it has a one second casting time and only four seconds recast time. It may make a difference, it may not. After all, the mobs you're fighting level up too =)<br><br>Kamlatir Baresi,<br>54 Reaver, <br>The Rathe<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Sweet Tunare in the Sunshine.<br><br>OK, a reasoned and maybe reasonable reply.<br><br>&amp;lt;Am I the only one tired of druids and rangers acting so high and mighty? Seriously folks, every other class has been taking their crap for so long and it disgusts me.&amp;gt;<br>Uhh... OK, it is obviously the CLASS which dictates character ingame, and not the person the character is an avatar for. Right.<br><br>&amp;lt;Does it bother anyone else that these classes are so overplayed? Not to mention the fact that these classes are also used to level up easily to make money and then twink it to another character. I don't know but I hate these weeny classes and think that they deserve something very bad. &amp;gt;<br>CivilChief, dear, you are missing the point while you make the point. The operative verb here, phool, is PLAY.<br><br>&amp;lt;The people who play these classes never roleplay and generally cause problems amongst lower level characters. They are easy to suck up to and con into giving you money as a lowbie. Call it being nice but I call it being stupid. &amp;gt;<br>Hmmm... &quot;never&quot; is such a big word. My drood, Ammanita (Ammy), tries to roleplay, but I am often pounded with &quot;What class are you?&quot; &quot;What level are you?&quot; - all too often followed by &quot;Can I get a SoW?&quot; or &quot;Can you port me to...&quot;. I spend a large portion of my ingame time helping others when and where I can. Roleplaying is not respected as it should be, so saying druids don't roleplay is stupid at best. As for being &quot;easy&quot;, well I rarely if ever give out money or twink others, but if I did, and pay attention here, It Is Mine To Dispose Of As I Will. Any part of that you don't understand? As for your calling such behavior stupid, well, that you may do. Everybody has their own internal definitions for words, and if your internal lexicon equates generosity to stupidity, well, OK.<br><br>&amp;lt;Then there is the time that we SK's get ejected out of a group so some guy's druid &quot;friend&quot; who is only his friend cause of some cash changning hands, can join. &amp;gt;<br>Sounds like a personal problem. Let us assume it was YOU who was ejected. From what and how you write, my money would be on - you were being a @#%^ and they wanted somebody compatible with the group, and useful (see response to Eidulon below). As for the &quot;money changning [sic] hands&quot; - no comment is possible.<br><br>&amp;lt;. And let's think about this, do either of these classes really have any true uses at higher lvls? (Yes I'm prepared to get flamed here, but I am tired of these classes and the people who play them)Come on, shaman's buff better than druids, warriors can fight better than druids, and about rangers.. what the hell can they do? Dual wield and use some of the crappier druid spells. Oh I forgot, they have track, I guess we should all just bow down to them. &amp;gt;<br>Hmmm... lessee, any use at higher levels? Well, I doubt that a group solely consisting of SKs could take, say, Tunare - not that MY drood would ever go up against Tunare. Be interesting to see. It is the diversity of the classes that make the game fun, and it is in diverse class grouping that makes grouping interesting, and fun. Betcha forgot about that part, fun.<br>No, don't bow down to them, but utilize their strengths to augment your weaknesses as a well-played druid or ranger would utilize your strengths to augment their weaknesses.<br><br>&amp;lt;The point I am making is that these characters survive by the easiness of their classes so they can spread their money around to make 'friends'. &amp;gt;<br>Nope, not a valid point at all, un-substantiable and pretty stupid in content.<br><br>&amp;lt;Nothing makes me angrier than a weeny druid (or ranger) kiting some mob across a dang zone because they take too long killing it. Not only does it end up training to someone else when the stupid druid screws it up, but the mob's other friends show up and screw everyone else over in the zone. &amp;gt;<br>Nope, Wrong. This is a perfectly valid and appropriate technique that is NOT Unique To Druids And Rangers. Bard Fear-Kiting comes to mind. No, what all too often happens is some idiot either doesn't pay attention to what is happening just steps in and breaks the kite instead of ASKING if help is needed, or some idiot tries to KS a MoB. Are all kites well controlled? No. Do 'innocents' die in the game? Yes.  BUt as a sweeping statement, very vapid, and not valid.<br><br>&amp;lt;Well, I am finished.&amp;gt;<br>I doubt taht very much.<br><br> &amp;lt;I'm hoping for some allies in my argument (and war) against these two overplayed classes and I know there are many enemies out there. Sorry for the long rant&amp;gt;<br>So, how do you _really_ feel about Druids and Rangers, huh? And, why the animosity?<br><br>Sadly, you miss the point. They are played because they are FUN. Well, my drood is, didn't like the ranger I had that much. Easy, well, yeah, sorta. But at 30 Ammy is less and less effective solo as a melee so I need to group more. And NO, this does not prove your thesis - it jsut means that the game is changing for me and I have to group more, which is one of the strengths of teh game. <br> <br><br><br><br>To quote Eidulon...<br>&amp;lt;. <br><br>1. They can evac. Wizards can Nuke and evac. <br><br>2. They can buff. Shamans way out-buff druids, and way out-buff druids. (necros too) <br><br>3. They can heal. Clerics can way out-heal druids. &amp;gt;<br><br>Yeah, but you get all this in ONE package. A drood makes a good backup healer, the healer to the primary healer for instance. Back up nuker too, the Planes help any summoned critter we go up against. And damage shield buffs. Melee sucks, droods get crap for weapons and armor. Yep. OK. Valid point and accepted (if not liked)limitation. But I like living by my brains rather than my brawn.<br><br>Actually, my REAL question to Civilchief ( who probably is neither), is: What the hell you doing starting this thread in a forum devoted to SKs? Talk about misplaced anger.<br><br>Hope you like walking, d00d.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>To CivilChiefs &quot;apolagies about so many posts,&quot; well dont be, thats what the forums are for, and I actually agreed and liked what you had to say with a few exceptions of course. :) just a shame that you got flamed by others not for what you wrote but more so because you had the &quot;audacity&quot; to attack their favourite class.?<br>I also hate and loath dwoods with a passion but that is me and I don't have this reflect of my perception of other players (just their characters) :) (my RL friend plays a dwood, no helping some hehe). Fact is that yes, dwoods way outnumber SK's and for several reasons some that you mentioned such as their ability to heal, DOT, DD, and port for plat, not to mention that they do perform so much better than SK's at soloing and can find mobs with their track so much easier, make great PLing char's etc, etc, but to hold that against them would mostly just be me admitting being envious of their abilities.<br>But like your comments my main hate for them is the number of times I have been trained by some dwood attempting to quad kite some mobs when it goes pear shape and they then &quot;sow&quot; or &quot;soc&quot; out of there and the mobs get trained onto other characters unaware, of such and then &quot;WTF&quot; whack whack whack &quot;wait please loading&quot;. Also when a mob been kited all of a sudden happens to be near me, looks down and thinks mmm BBQ Teir'Dal. I am envious of the way they have track and can find mobs in a few minutes that I can not find without running all over a zone and risking it, I hate the way I might attempt to camp Pyzin(sp) and wonder if the reason that I had no mob arrive at the ruins was because somebody with track KSed her from me. There are things that dwoods simply do better than SK's but to qoute the top of this forum &quot; the shadowknight is a complex class to develop and play correctly. &quot;<br>IMHO the dwood has more advantages than a SK when it comes to gaming for the sake of power, however some people like to play dwoods and some like I don't.<br>(Roleplay on -Yes I hate dwoods with a passion and hence do not play one, am guilded in an evil race only guild and have taken to refusing to group with a party that has a Dwood in it,(to my own disadvantage), most times- it is hard to find a group with no dwood in it :)<br><br>So whilst I agree with most things you stated and disagree with some others, at least your post wasn't a childish flame, such as those you recieved in reply.<br><br>Time to load up the Save VS Fire  :)<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Miztress, Teir'Dal Shadow Knight of Innoruuk<br>Guild Disciplinarian to Innoruuk's Hatred (Torv)<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Tiras,<br><br>   To beleive our only draw back is the fact that we are hated shows you have almost NO idea of what playing an SK entails. Granted the HT is one of the most feared attacks on any PvP server but ask yourself, just how many PvP servers are there as aposed to those of us who play on the blue servers.<br><br>   Frankly i have played a multitude of race/class combinations and prefer the SK because it fits my more offensive style of play. I have also played a ranger and personally think they are horible till you get to the mid to late 30's, THEN they come into their own.<br><br>Second you state that SK's get the second highest HP's in the game, well here you wrongly assume that ALL SK's are trolls or ogres. I am one of the few, the proud, the Erudite SK. No i do not &quot;have the second highest HP's in the game&quot;<br><br><br>I get by because i use my unlimited mana pool and knowlege of my class to my advantage. Not some mythical advantage to my HP's.<br><br>Infact i know many rangers who have higher HP's than i on my server, and can kick everyone of their butts in the arena.<br><br>As for druids, i find a druid can be very usefull if you find one who knows what the hell they are doing. As someone said before they are a jack of all trades. They change the class hats as often as SK's change weapons, prolly more so.<br>How ever as a Melee class i do get ticked off at the majority of the druids who don't under stand IF THERE IS NO CLERIC IN GROUP DON'T NUKE YOUR MANA AWAY. Gets a bit anoying when you see the main druid healer say OOM and you are close to dieing yourself. Then they have the nerved to be pissed when you FD and watch them get their butts kicked.<br><br><br>But tiras, you need to learn that no, we are not &quot;all stupid ogres and trolls&quot; as my intelect is far superior to that which the ranger races could ever hope to attain.<br><br>&quot;Next time think before you act&quot;<br><br><br>I think thats fitting.<br><br>P.S. i miss 22% of the time. Also i get personal tells asking me to group, i never carry the LFG tag ever so popular on the FV server.<br><br><br>Talor Darkmoon<br><br>33rd season Dark Knight Of the fine city of Paineel<br>Master smith<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well I just gotta say I have never been thrown out of a group as a ranger or sk, if you got thrown out of a group for a group then more than likely you can't play an sk very well. I don't think that you should blame a druid/ranger due to you inadequacies at playing an sk. You dis rangers because you think that we are a weak class, well I would have to agree on some points we may be weak, but if you played a ranger and knew what you were talking about then you would know that a rangers utility is more than just stats. For example just last night I was in Burning Woods, I am now 46th but I was grouped with some friends 54th sk and 55th sk a 52 wizard, and another 44th wizard our cleric left the zone, did we all disband no.. I SoW'd we went to the giant fort and killed 12 giants in a row before we took a break, during that time the wizard gained agro and was down to his last bub of health, who saved em ... a ranger ... with a heal while one of the sk's gained agro again. After the fight we were down for mana but during that time I buffed the group and healed them. Sure you can say what you want about a ranger because thats your opinion, but obiviously you don't have the facts. As a person that has played both a ranger and sk to 40+ I can compare and probably know quite a bit more about what each can and can't do.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Dec  4 02:59:05 2001</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Cannis Skywise 47 Ranger<br>Razer Darkreaver 42st Sk<br>Jeetkundo 20th Monk<br>Mikaraz 26th Warrior</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>If you can, all weapon skills that you can practise should be done. However, the SK epic is a 2HS...if you aspire to this, you should practise on this skill for sure. You will want to keep up with at least one of the 1handers so that you can bash with shield if you are not an ogre or troll (must have for fighting casters). I personally like edge weapons better then blunt, but there are some really nice 1hb for sk's out there. As a matter of fact my best weapon right now is 1hb, Mace of Shadowed Soul, very nice! Also if you are main tank, then the 1h* and shield would be a good consideration, then switch to 2hs if you are assisting. You should also consider carring a fast (low damage) 1h* to use in tandem with your shield when fighting casters...better change at interrupting. If you are into appearance, that opens up another area, piercing. At higher levels you can start finding lances, which are 2h piercers...anybody else think it's cool for a knight to be wielding a lance, and the graphics on most are very nice. Can't wait to see it from horse back! I believe (might be wrong on this) that only SK, warr and pally can use lances.<br>&nbsp;<br>Daemondred Dreamslayer 41th knight of Innoruuk<br>Luclin</td></tr>
