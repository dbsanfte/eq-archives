Being completely evil and immoral had definite advantages.  The purpose of this document is to give some insight into the in's and out's associated with the class up to level 15.  The lower levels for Shadow Knights are particularly difficult.  The game tells you right off the bat that this is a class of the highest difficulty, especially if you are not a human or an Erudite.  Until level 9 the SK has no mana, therefore no spells.  During that time we are basically warriors with fewer hit points and fewer melee skills overall, than a real warrior.  Expect these levels to get discouraging.  They are also long, as several of the races that can become SKs carry experience penalties, making leveling a longer process.<br><br>There are many guides out there that give advice on playing an SK.  Most of these, however, cover topics such as good experience-giving mobs for a given level, or what zones provide good hunting or, character creation.  Alternatively, we would like to cover some of the more "hands on topics" such as pulling, soloing and "in-battle" tactics vs. melee and casting characters.<br><br>I will not cover character creation here.  Many other guides cover this topic well.   Your character race is a subjective matter.  I will say that if you want to cast a lot, go with a Dark Elf or Erudite.  Mana is a function of intelligence and Ogres and Trolls, while much better melee characters than the others, will lack mana.  They will have it, of course, but will be medding after every fight.  Conversely, if you want to be stronger in melee, go with a large race.<br><br>Everybody hates a shadowknight<br><br>The worst aspect of being an SK, is the fact that you are KOS in all of the regions where good races dwell.  There is a flipside to this.  Some of the better hunting grounds for lower level characters are near evil places.  The lack of binding spots and merchants for good races, tends to make for smaller crowds, especially in the far southern reaches of Antonica.  These prime outdoor hunting grounds are:  The flip side of being KOS everywhere, is that you don't have to worry as much about faction.  If you are KOS anyway, kill everything and don't worry about it.  While I won't dwell on hunting spots or specific mobs, here are a few of the good hunting grounds for SKs:<br><br>Nektulos forest, Innothule swamp, Field of Bone, Tox forest, Qeynos Hills and the Feerott for newbies.<br><br>East Commonlands for levels 7 - 11.<br><br>North Ro, South Ro,  and Lavastorm for levels 12 - 15<br><br>Oasis and Najena for levels 16 - 22<br><br>Solusek A for levels 20 - 30<br><br>Overthere (northern section) and Lake of Ill Omen for levels 20 - 26<br><br>Cazic-thule and Frontier Mountains for levels 25 - 35<br><br>Lower Guk, Solusek B  and Overthere (southern section) for levels 35 - 50<br><br>Skills. Stats and Equipment<br><br>As we are first a melee class, and second a casting class, it is vital to maintain your fighting skills.  Later, what skill you use will primarily be determined by the best weapon you have/find/are given.  So don't let your 1 HB skill, for instance, get left behind in case you find that ebon mace lying on the ground (fat chance, but you never know).  Get into the habit of rotating your weapons by class in order to keep skills up.  This includes ancillary weapon skills such as bash.  SKs who are not Ogres or Trolls need a shield for this, so try a get a decent one.<br><br>Sense heading is a frustrating skill.  It takes forever to advance in level.  One trick is to hot-key it and keep pressing it while fighting, resting, meditating, fishing, whatever.  It starts to advance more rapidly after 20 or so.  By doing this, you will continually advance and, eventually will be able to benefit from it sooner.<br><br>Put one practice point into all of the magic skills at level 9.  A few of them, you will use so much, that any more practice is a waste.  Others, abjuration in particular, can be advanced by casting endure cold on yourself when you have sufficient mana.  More on this later, when we cover feign death.<br><br>Stats and Equipment are interrelated.  Depending on your race, different stats will be crucial.  For Trolls and Ogres, intelligence is important since they naturally have high strength and stamina.  For Dark Elves, strength is important since they naturally have high intelligence.  Use common sense when selecting equipment according to your needs, strengths and weaknesses.  Also keep in mind if you are going to do the darkforge armor quest that you will be getting certain stat bonuses along with the armor, especially stamina.  Certain stats are easier to come by than others, particularly strength (e.g. bloodstained mantle) and agility (e.g. serp bracers).<br><br>Strength and Intelligence are the primary stats for any shadowknight.  These determine damage output and mana pool size respectively, so concentrate on these.   Agility determines how often you get hit, and also adds to your AC.  Stamina determines your number of hit points.  Dexterity determines how often a magic weapon with an effect procs.  AC determines how much damage you take when you are hit.  This is the most important stat along with STR and INT.  <br><br>Soloing as an SK<br><br>People like to debate over which of the classes is best for soloing.  The SK is one of the good ones.  This is because:  1) We are second only to warriors in melee.  2) We have a wide variety of spells, and not just offensive.  3) We have a pet.  Wise use of these benefits will enable you to solo effectively.  Anyone can solo a mob.  The key to successful soloing, however, is to consistently be able to take out blue cons or higher without healing for 20 minutes between engagements.  The key elements is this ability are:<br><br>1. Choice of and isolation of victim<br><br>2. Effective casting<br><br>3. How you use your pet<br><br>Choice of and isolation of victim<br><br>While it would be great to be able to solo yellow and red cons all day, the sad truth is that this is a unwise strategy.  The chance of dying is too great and, even if you win you will almost always be low on HP and mana.  Of course it is possible to defeat a red con and come away relatively unscathed, but over a number of these engagements, you will find that the number of deaths or times you are forced to run to zone far outnumber the successes.  Even black and white cons are an inefficient choice.  If you select only blues (and sometimes high greens) you will be able to solo with minimum down time, often killing 3 or 4 mobs consecutively without resting.<br><br>Once you have found the proper victim you need to use an isolation strategy.  Nothing ruins an engagement faster than another mob showing up.  Even a green mob (especially a healer) can easily turn the tables and result in your running for a zone, or worse, retrieving your corpse.  Know which mobs aggro or gang up.  It is crucial to find a spot that is out of the pathing ranges for aggro monsters. Areas close to zones are ideal spot.  As a bonus, there are usually higher level players medding or resting there who might save you if you get into trouble. <br><br>For level 9 and higher, this is where you want to plant your pet.  Use your "/pet guard here" command and your pet will stay in that spot until a creature attacks you.  At this point, you can go out scouting to find a victim.  Once you choose, shoot or cast at the mob, then run back to where your pet is.  Now you and your pet can dispose of the mob without being jumped by another mob.  One cautionary note:  make sure that your path from the pulling spot to your pet is clear of creatures.  If the pulled mob passes too close to another mob, you will most likely have two mobs to kill.  Done successfully, you should have at least 3 bubbles, more likely 4+  bubbles of health left at the end of the fight.  Usually, I go right out and find another at that point.<br><br>A good example of where this strategy will work is South Ro.  Near the wizard platform, there is a line demarcating the grassy half of Sro from the desert part.  You will notice that the higher level mobs that roam the desert, almost never cross this line in their pathing.  Plant your pet near the pyramid, then go into the desert to pull a madman, scarab, tarantula or an orc.  Run back across the line to your pet.  This virtually eliminates the chance of another mob stumbling into the fight.  I soloed levels 15 and 16 exclusively this way in 2 days.  This same strategy works just as well in southern Oasis.  Plant your pet in front of the zone to South Ro and pull to that spot.  These are examples...there are many places where you will encounter similar situations.<br><br>A couple of caveats regarding your pet.  For low level pets, make sure you pick a mob that is not invulnerable to regular weapons.  A ghoul, for instance, will take no damage if your pet does not have a magic weapon and, to equip your pet with one would not be economically feasible.   Also, make sure that you give the "/pet taunt off" command.   Your pet will attract enough unwanted attention due to his low level without him looking for it.  Finally, when facing shadowknight mobs, target the mob and use the "/pet kill" command to send your pet to pull and take the harm touch.   Obviously, you only want to use this tactic when you can safely bring up a pet (e.g. lizard crusaders on temple floor).<br><br>Effective casting when soloing<br><br>Magic spells are a crucial component to effective soloing.  Your prime objectives in effective casting are damage output and mana conservation.  Another important aspect is HP conservation.  SKs do not have healing spells per se.  We do, however, have lifetap type spells and siphon spells.  Lifetap spells (this includes lifespike, etc.) are not very mana efficient (based upon their damage/mana drain ration) so use them sparingly.  Lifespike, when used say, 4 times during a fight, will be the equivalent of being healed 44 hit points.  Post 29 SKs get lifedraw, which is more efficient, adding about 43 hp at a cost of about 65 mana.  Siphon strength is more mana efficient and adds ten strength points while weakening the mob.  This incerases your damage output and also has the ancillary effect of maintaining your agility, especially when encumbered, allowing you to take less damage.  If you get a dark reaver, this spell also stacks with the proc. Try to keep siphon strength in effect at all times.<br><br>What you use to pull is a matter of taste and the situation.  If siphon has terminated, use it.  If siphon is in effect, use disease cloud if low on mana.  Post level 14, use a darkness spell to gain more time before the fight starts.  Sometimes you want the mob to get to you fast, to avoid aggroing any spawn pops.  In this case use another spell, or if you are post 29 use heat blood.  If you are really low on mana, you can also pull with your bow.  Don't forget about it.  We will discuss pulling spells further in the grouping section.<br><br>Don't cast too many spells during one fight, unless necessary.  If you are out of mana after the fight, you will have more downtime.  On the other hand, mana regenerates faster than HP, so unless you are a troll, keep an eye on the HP and mana bars.  If you are low on HP, but high on mana, blast off a few lifetaps/lifespikes.  Another HP conserving tip is when a mob runs and is almost dead, just lifetap it a couple of times while your pet chases it.  This gives you some extra HP, as long as you are ok on mana.<br><br>Often, you will find that you get resisted often, especially right after acquiring new spells.  This is a good reason to keep a couple of the old spells memorized...they will get resisted less often.  Also, you might cast a spell that gets resisted early in the fight but will stick a few rounds later.  I have found that mobs that are low on HP, are less likely to resist (this is an observation that has not been tested).  Never cast fear without casting darkness first, unless you have a good reason.  This is especially true in dungeons.  There is no easier way of starting a train than to cast fear on a mob in Guk or Cazic-Thule.  Runners are annoying and, potentially dangerous whether they are outside or not.  If you know a mob type is a runner, make sure that darkness is in effect when you get the mob to 50 percent.  It is likely that when they reach the point of running, darkness will still be in effect, allowing you to kite them easily as they try to run away.<br><br>Harm touch should be used when needed.  I've learned not to hold back on using HT after getting killed a few times.  Use it when you overpull, or when you are in trouble with no zone to run to.  But use it.  The faster you use it, the faster it will come back.  One thing I usually do is to use it when the mob has anywhere from 80 percent to 50 percent of it's HP left.  If you wait until the mob is down to 20 percent, you won't reap the full  benefit of HT.  For instance if 20 percent of the mob's HP is 80 points and you are level 10, you wasted 20 points of potential dmg output.  In an emergency, this does not apply, but you will usually know when you are in trouble early on in a fight.  One last note...do not use HT on mobs that are known to have high magic resists or are known to be much higher level than you.  It is a magic-based direct damage spell that takes no time to cast.  If they have a high magic SV, they will resist and you will have wasted it (this is way more likely to happen on red cons).  Try to darkness them and run, instead.<br><br>A note on feign death.  This is one of the best spells you will ever get.  Make sure you have your abjuration skill maxed before you hit level 30 and get the FD spell.  If not, you will not be able to use it effectively until you raise your skill.  A good way to raise it is to cast endure cold on yourself, then right click the endure cold icon to make it go away.  Recast.  Do this over and over until you run out of mana during down time.  You can raise your abjure skill 10 points in a very short time doing this.  I will not cover the intricacies of feign death pulling...it is covered elsewhere in detail.  A couple of caveats though.  First, always remember to stop attacking before trying to feign.  Next, SOW helps enormously in getting some distance between you and the mobs before feigning.  Don't start to FD if you see a mob starting to cast on you...wait until they are finished.  Finally, try to find a safe place away from spawn points to feign.<br><br>Effective use of your pet<br><br>Many other guides give advice on pet usage.  One consistent theme for SK pets, is that they are weak.  Do not expect the pet to tank for you while you cast.  This works for necros, because they have pets that are nearly the same level as them.  Necros are also weak in melee.  An SK always melees a mob, whether you are casting or not...no exceptions (except for when you are running!).  While auto attack is on, you can try to time your casts between weapon swings.  If you melee a mob, there should be no reason why your pet should take enough damage to die.  In these situations, your pet will be able to make a contribution by contributing some damage each round.  This damage varies depending upon the pet level. Like spell damage, pet damage adds up.  Over a two minute fight, your pet can be responsible for 100-200 points damage.  If you tank for your pet, they should last for a while.  I have had pets last for 15 or 20 fights.<br><br>The fact that they are weak (about half your level) is a good reason for using the "/pet guard here" command.  If the pet is out roaming around with you, it will attract mobs that won't aggro you.  In indoor zones especially, this is a good way to start a train (it is not advisable to use a pet in dungeons).  Have the pet guard a spot and pull to him (her).  Pets can also save you.  If you overpull, when you run back past your pet and stop attacking, the mobs will typically go for him...because he will attack the mobs when they reach the guard spot.  This will give you a few seconds to vacate the premises.  And in these situations, it is recommend that you do.   <br><br>Special Situations - Fighting Casters<br><br>If you haven't already discovered, fighting against a caster can be a supreme pain, often resulting in death, low HP and mana or a quick trip through the nearest zone.  New Shadowknights often find this out the hard way, as most low level mobs are melee characters and when they do encounter a caster they are unprepared.<br><br>Several players have written PVP guides for Shadowknights and some of these contain excellent information regarding caster encounters.  This should apply to NPCs also.  A consistent theme is that a caster wants distance between you and him.  You will notice that in Cazic, the judicators and justicars like to cast on you from 50 yards away and don't come within melee range sometimes. <br><br>There are three key components to defeating a caster NPC solo.  Your pet, magic resists and having sufficient mana.   This is especially true when facing druids, wizards, rangers and any other classes that can root or snare.  There is nothing worse that being rooted, petless and out of mana.  You might as well start typing "/loc" as you will need it to find your corpse.<br><br>Lets talk about resists, first.  Common sense tells us to go for the equipment with the best/most resists.  But what about when you have to make choices between two resists?  First, consider where you are fighting.  If you are in Permafrost go for cold... fighting spiders? Poison saves...mummies?  Disease saves.  You get the picture.  Of all of these resistances, magic is probably the most important.  Why?  Because you encounter casting mobs everywhere whereas cold, fire, disease and poison are usually localized to specific pockets (e.g. desert zones where mummies roam for disease, spiders and snakes for poison, etc.) .  Just a few points of added magic SV can be the difference between you being rooted or whirled around like a rag doll, and you laughing at the mob who just wasted mana on you.  You will find, especially when being jumped by green and low blue casters that you are resisting many of their spells if you have some gear with magic SVs.  Just a quick mention of some good resist items that don't cost a fortune - runed bone fork, split-paw mask, skull shaped barbute, sarnak emblazoned tabard, guard of the marine and shiny brass shield.<br><br>What about the pet?  Pets are very good for outdoor caster fights because they give you additional choices in how to fight a caster.  Without a pet, you will almost certainly be chasing the caster (who wants distance between you and him) while being blasted by spells.  With a pet, even if you are rooted, you can cast spells at him, while your pet melees him and hopefully causes spell interrupts.  If you can, get in close along with your pet.  The combination of both of you pummeling the mob will cause more interrupts, making for a short encounter.  If you are not an ogre or troll, use 1 hand weapons with a shield to be able to bash the caster for interrupts.  This is especially useful when facing a healer.  Nothing is more aggravating than smacking a lizard judicator down to a half a bub, and having it heal back up to 4 bubs.  HT is useful in those situations if you have it.<br><br>Of course, most of these tactics are not possible if you are out of mana.  For this reason, ensure that you have sufficient mana if you know there are casters around.  One cautionary note.  It is generally unwise to go against red, yellow and ever black/white casters.  Why?  Because overall, your spells (which are lower level than a caster of the same level) will probably be resisted and, unless you have very high magic resists, their spells will do a lot of damage.  You will notice that blue mobs will seldom resist your spells, while yellows and reds will.   Occasionally though, even green casters can be a problem.  I've been taken down to a bubble by a casting mob that conned green.   This obviously depends upon your magic resist, and luck.<br><br>Grouping as an SK<br><br>The more you level, the less attractive soloing becomes.  After level 25 or so, you will suddenly find that the number of available soloing targets begins to plunge.  No problem, you will probably want to be going to Cazic to start your darkforge quests around now.  Cazic is one of the places where you really begin to develop your grouping skills.  Earlier in EC, you could get away with a mob mentality when fighting in an orc group.  Not so in cazic.  Here you will begin to find your role in a group.  As puller, as taunter and as a tank.  Nothing gives you valuable grouping experience like an overpull in the Avatar of Fear room or in the throne room.  The lizards hit hard, and cast often, not to mention the big guy.<br><br>The most important thing to learn if you want to continue being in groups, is DO NOT abandon your groupmates.  Die if you have to, but don't run when you get low and let the mobs get to the casters.  Let the casters run if you like, but shadowknights DO NOT RUN AWAY.  Your groupmates will respect you for sticking around.  They will not ask you to come back if you run.  Later, post 29 SKs have the benefit of being able to aggro the mobs away from the group and feign death, giving the others time to gate, run, invis or whatever.  Do this and you will be a hero.<br><br>Get a reputation as a good puller.  Pullers are always in demand.  The pullers job is to select the mobs and to control the flow of the group.  Always check that your casters have mana.  Don't pull if you see a "OOM" in your chat box.  Get experience in feign pulling.  You will die many times in developing this skill, but later on in Kunark and on the planes, you will be a valuable asset to a group.  Make sure that everyone is assisting you and know what mobs to take first.  Call out the mob to be on (e.g. "On inferno wiz!").  There is no faster way to have a pull go bad, than when everybody is on a different mob.  Make sure that the chanters are letting you know what mobs they are mezzing to avoid wasting mana.   As for pulling methods, use whatever fits the group and the situation.   For instance, if there is an enchanter in the group, avoid pulling with a DOT as the mob will not mez while the DOT is in effect.   If you don't have a mez capable group member, it is sometimes convenient to split the mobs using darkness on a long pull.   For instance, if there are two mobs you are pulling at a long distance, use darkness to pull.  The mob you darknessed will take a lot longer to reach the group, during which time the group can be killing the first mob to arrive.<br><br>As puller, you will be the "traffic cop" for the fight.  Everybody should be assisting you, so you must know which mobs to kill first.  Know the hierarchy of mobs in the zone you are in.  Generally, the order will be casters first, most powerful on down, then melee mobs.  This holds unless there are unmezzable mobs and you have a bard or enchanter.  In this case, kill the unmezzable mobs first.  As mentioned earlier, call out the mob that is next so that the caster's know what is going on.  In those situations where you are not pulling, make sure you are assisting the puller.  Nothing is more embarrassing than attacking a mezzed mob by accident.<br><br>Know what spells to use based upon what the group casters are casting.   If a druid or ranger is in the group, they will probably be using snare, so don't use darkness.  If there is a necromancer in the group, ask her what spells she is using, as hers will generally overwrite yours.  Don't use an AE debuff like wave of enfeeblement around mezzed mobs.  If you know the cleric is low on mana in a tough fight, help her out by lifetapping, especially when the mob is on another player (in this situation you have a "free shot") as it will taunt as well as give you some hit points.  Always remember to cast vampiric embrace so that it is in effect during the fight.  <br><br>TAUNT.  Develop this skill and have it maxed.  We are the best taunters, bar none.  Warriors are better tanks, but nobody can get a mob off a caster as fast as an SK.  Keep disease cloud memmed for a mana-cheap extra taunt that really pisses the mobs off.  This will be one of your primary roles in a group.  If you see a mob go after one of your casters, go after it and taunt like mad.  If the casters are killed, you will be next.  This is what people will expect from you.  If your casters like to run around when a mob aggros them, politely let them know that it is easier to taunt the mob off of them if they stay put and take a couple of hits.<br><br>Get to know the people if you are in a zone often.  You will discover very quickly that some people are better groupmates than others.  If somebody repeatedly does something they shouldn't do, politely bow out of the group.  If another puller won't listen to OOM requests, bow out.  If you have tanks who like to run away, bow out.  Life is too short to deal with amateurs or people who only care about themselves.  If a non-SK ninja loots that crusader, definitely bow out and never group with that person again.  Be fair about loot and people will generally be fair in return.<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>Shadowknights are the least played class in the game.  Last time I checked something like 3 percent of all characters were shadowknights.  Many of these are probably worthless twinks of darkforge farmers and shouldn't even be considered shadowknights.  On my server (the Rathe) a "/who all sha 25 40" will generally yield about 20 players in prime time.  There are several reasons for this, the primary being that it is the most difficult class to play and level.  Fine, who wants to be like everybody else anyway?  If you want an easy time, go play a halfling warrior or druid.  If you want to be the baddest of the bad, play an SK.  I will mention in closing that for those who want to play the class, that we have an obligation to uphold a certain set of standards so that people will come to respect and admire those who play the hardest class in the game.  So, please keep this in mind if you decide to become a shadowknight.<br><br>I hope to write a continuation of this guide when covering the planes, high level dungeons and velious in a few levels.  If anyone has any comments regarding the information above, look for me on the Rathe or send me an email at scotti@bangzoom.net.  See you then.<br><br>Orthogonon Angainor<br>DESK<br>The Rathe<br></p></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width="100%"><tr><td id=fs8></td><td align=right id=fs8 >14 Replies</td></tr></table></td></tr></table><tr><td>

This is wrong.  Never cast fear in an indoor zone.  You will not only probably get yourself killed, but many other people.  About the only situation i can think of where you might cast it, is when you are in danger (overpull) and you know the zone is completely empty except for you and/or your group. <br><br>Hope this helps.

Ignore the fact that multiple MOBs are pounding on your back and taunt the rest of the mob on to you, thus allowing the group to run to safety. At higher levels the group will probably pay for an exp rez and I have at times agged the entire MOB onto myself and then singlehandedly took them to the zone. <br>MAKE SURE YOUR GROUP UNDERSTANDS THIS THOUGH. I have also started agging the MOB onto me and had a well intentioned group member try to "rescue" me only to have the MOB attack the group again causing multiple deaths.<br>Communication is a good thing in group play.<br><br>When you get a pull and as you are heading back the group says "add" or "inc" this means that not only do you have mobs with you but the group is fighting a Mob. Delay your return until the group is ready. If outside, run the mob around in circles and tell the group to let you know when they are ready.<br>Keep a steady flow of pulls until the healers tell you to quit. MAKE SURE THEY KNOW THIS IS THE PLAN! As soon as you have the last kill under control and the sceondary tank can handle it let him agg the mob and go for the next pull. Less downtime waiting on the next pull = more XP<br><br>Groldar Scalereaver<br>34 Lvl ShadowKnight<br>Innoruk</p></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width="100%"><tr><td id=fs8></td><td align=right id=fs8 >0 Replies</td></tr></table></td></tr></table><tr><td class=mhback align=right><span class=mh id=fs8><a class=mh href=/db/classes.html?class=5><img src=/shared/root_thread_ico.gif border=0 alt="Up" width=17 height=11> Thread Index</a> |  <a class=mh href=/db/classes.html?class=5&post=1><img src=/shared/new_thread_ico.gif border=0 alt="New" width=17 height=11> New Subject</a> | <a class=mh href=/db/classes.html?class=5&mid=9807320693901&num=14&post=1&mid=9807320693901><img src=/shared/reply_to_thread_ico.gif border=0 alt="Reply" width=17 height=11> Reply to Thread</a></span></td></tr><tr><td><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="mform"><tr><td id="fs8">14 Posts [ <a href="/fsearch.html?base=class5">Search Forums</a> ]</nobr></td></tr></table>&nbsp;</td></tr>
