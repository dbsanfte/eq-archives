	   <tr><td colspan=2>&quot;I play a 60 Gnome Warlord.<br><br>I have a huge advantage of mobility in those REALLY tight fights, where ogres and barbarians have to get double shrunk and still seem to get stuck or complain about it more often.<br><br>If you're into tinkering you can make (or buy and use) some Gnome-Only self buff items. I use the dex/haste/invis gnome-only clickys relentlessly (our culteral armour is awsome for gnome warriors and I still use the effects at 60). No where other than warrior epic can I get a nice clicky-dex buff until mabee I start using weapons procing avatar, so gnome-only dex buffs are welcome.<br><br>In full Myrmidons and have excellent dex and cap str and dex at 255 when fully buffed(agi comes darn close (252ish), I would reccomend you dump all points into stamina, as I still cant cap that at 255 (I put all my in STR when STR was god 3 years ago).<br><br>The only drawback I had the whoel time as a gnome warrior was the lack of good armour for short races back in the kunark era. We couldnt wear Imbued Granite Spaulders from the Hole (now we have alternates which are better anyway), we couldnt use the 16ac 3str sleeves form FM (which we have better nowdays anyway, at the time 16ac was godly comparable only to cobalt), And we couldnt use a few other things which have better items availible to us now anyway (tantors tusk replaces the fact we could never use the huge axe from kunark for riposte disc's etc)<br><br>All in all it ALL comes down to what you like. At 60 the iksar may have 60more ac, the ogres may have more hp (until you're muffed to 255 the same as they are) and the ogres may be unstunnable, but I've not fought a mob yet where I've lost aggro due to stun, and the bigger mobs out there seem to stun ALOT less than general zone trash mobs anyway (not counting those that proc or ae a stun even ogres get hit by). Not to mention the 60 extra ac an iksar may have still wont mitigate the majority of those 850 quads your taking from Uber_mob003.<br><br>And besides, Gnomes are just too damn stylish.<br><br>Gnimwit Gnumbskull&quot;<br><br>&quot;What makes the best warrior is the person driving the warrior. I am in a near uber (??) guild, unbuffed I have 1203 AC, 3200+ HP and some real holes in my non-vis gear. While I would not sneeze at a 3.4% upgrade to my AC the differance does border on trivail. The regen at uber levels means even less. We just took Rhaq 1--one of easier mobs that needs rotation CH--and the other MT (since I died about 1 minute into the fight) took about 100,000 damage in 7 minutes. In the 70 ticks an Iksar would have regen (wiht full AAs to regen) something like 1600 HP. Hardly worth all the extra time Iksar have to spend xping to make up for their penelty--heck on a 5khp warrior that is not even a third of their HP. <br><br>Kailyn Longstride Warlord of the North, Unleashed<br>42nd Armswoman, Lancelot&quot;<br><br><br>Just wondering at the real validity of my class here =)<br><br>&quot;Ive seen other classes get around 4.5k hp w/o buffs, just curious if there are any DE's out there that can boast that or near it. Hell even if you don't post yer profile, im curious to see how many of us there are. I find being a DE can be tough at times hearing about thise damn higher hp counts but I just need to score me some bette gear. <br>Solanthus 55 Warrior, Darkholme&quot;<br><br>&quot;A Dark elf with 255 Stamina has exactly the same hp as an ogre with 255 stamina, and with end-game gear, that's not at all hard to do.<br><br>I do not have said end-game gear, and only have around 1250 AC and 3350 HP unbuffed, which tends to be more than sufficient for every situation I have encountered thus far.<br><br>I believe Mojak has about 4500 hp unbuffed... hopefully he can confirm it for me though ( ; <br><br>Kaldayr Malabranche -Dark Elf Warrior&quot;<br><br><br>Just some posts from uber warriors supporting that in the End Game its easy for everyone to get max stamina and strength.<br>&nbsp;<br>Cannis 54st Ranger<br>Razer 51st Sk<br>Mikaraz 37th Warrior<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Sorry--I don't interpret those messages to mean that it is EASY (yeah RIGHT) to get MAX STR &amp; STA in the &quot;end game&quot; (whatever that means) AT ALL.<br><br>For instance, <br><br>&quot;In full Myrmidons and have excellent dex and cap str and dex at 255 when fully buffed (agi comes darn close (252ish), I would reccomend you dump all points into stamina, as I still cant cap that at 255 (I put all my in STR when STR was god 3 years ago).&quot;<br><br>Perhaps it's just me, but doesnt that say that he needs to be BUFFED to reach those numbers and STILL HASNT MAXED OUT STA?!?!?!<br><br>Continuing, <br><br>&quot;All in all it ALL comes down to what you like. At 60 the iksar may have 60more ac, the ogres may have more hp (until you're muffed to 255 the same as they are) and the ogres may be unstunnable, but I've not fought a mob yet where I've lost aggro due to stun, and the bigger mobs out there seem to stun ALOT less than general zone trash mobs anyway (not counting those that proc or ae a stun even ogres get hit by). Not to mention the 60 extra ac an iksar may have still wont mitigate the majority of those 850 quads your taking from Uber_mob003.&quot;<br><br>All this is stating is that this gentlemen BELIEVES that a Gnome WAR (I presume) is as good as a IKS / ORG WAR.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me that an IKS / ORG WAR doesnt have different thoughts.  Further, the Gnome, AT THE END OF THE DAY, does NOT HAVE THE ADVANTAGES that the other races do.  All he can do is belittle the advantages of those other races.  I dont care either way---Im not biased to any one race.  The advantages ARE WHAT THEY ARE &amp; if you WANT TO MAXIMIZE YOUR character, why not have the most advantages?  You two, on the other hand, are totally biased to DEs &amp; that is just plain silly.  Shame be on both of you for not being able to analyze it unemotionally.<br><br>&quot;What makes the best warrior is the person driving the warrior. I am in a near uber (??) guild, unbuffed I have 1203 AC, 3200+ HP and some real holes in my non-vis gear. While I would not sneeze at a 3.4% upgrade to my AC the differance does border on trivail. The regen at uber levels means even less. We just took Rhaq 1--one of easier mobs that needs rotation CH--and the other MT (since I died about 1 minute into the fight) took about 100,000 damage in 7 minutes. In the 70 ticks an Iksar would have regen (wiht full AAs to regen) something like 1600 HP. Hardly worth all the extra time Iksar have to spend xping to make up for their penelty--heck on a 5khp warrior that is not even a third of their HP&quot;<br><br>This has NOTHING to do with talking about how easy it is to max out STR &amp; STA, which begs the question--WHY IS IT EVEN HERE???<br><br><br>&quot;&quot;Ive seen other classes get around 4.5k hp w/o buffs, just curious if there are any DE's out there that can boast that or near it. Hell even if you don't post yer profile, im curious to see how many of us there are. I find being a DE can be tough at times hearing about thise damn higher hp counts but I just need to score me some bette gear. <br>Solanthus 55 Warrior, Darkholme&quot; <br><br>&quot;A Dark elf with 255 Stamina has exactly the same hp as an ogre with 255 stamina, and with end-game gear, that's not at all hard to do. <br><br>I do not have said end-game gear, and only have around 1250 AC and 3350 HP unbuffed, which tends to be more than sufficient for every situation I have encountered thus far. <br><br>I believe Mojak has about 4500 hp unbuffed... hopefully he can confirm it for me though&quot;<br><br>Interesting that this guy says that its easy to get MAX STA (no mention of STR, but that's ok for now), yet the gentlemen above says otherwise.  Can you explain that?  Further, it is NOT EASY, despite what ANYONE SAYS.  Yeah right.  Like getting this END GAME gear that everyone talks about is SO EASY.  If it was so easy, then why doesnt the lvl 55 DE have it then?<br><br>Oh, I get it.  You need to be near lvl 60 (or so)to get it then?  If that's the case, that's silly also.  Basically, you are TOTALLY OUTMATCHED until you reach lvl 60 (or so), at which time, the other SUPERIOR TANKING RACES are hampered by the caps more than your NON-TANKING RACE (otherwise the NON-TANKING RACES WOULD NEVER CATCH THEM--Verant should probably fix this, but...).  Basically, UNTIL such time, your race is completely inferior.  You dont see how silly that is?!?!?!?<br><br>Lunatic<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have several 60th lvl friends which say the gear they acquired at 55th to the gear they have acquired at 60th is much better. Most good guilds give the best stuff to their highest level more frequently participating members. <br><br>Yes I am biased against anyone that says a dark elf/erudite is not as good as any other race. Obiviously if ogre/trolls were the best race choice they would all be ogre/troll warriors and there would be no ogre/troll Shadowknights because quite frankly why would anyone want to be a second rate tank by your criteria of what a tank is. I mean a ogre/troll warrior gets hps bonuses and the amount of damage is pretty good.<br><br>What I am trying to say is that your stereotypical view of what makes a tank is what perpetuates the idea that dark elf/erudites should be passed up for groups as they can't &quot;tank&quot;. I myself know that my dark elf sk makes a better tank than that rogue/monk/ranger that I am fighting with. My being able to hold agro allows them to do the damage they are capable of and the group would be using way more mana to heal if I wasn't there and its not because they don't have the hps its because I have higher AC.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Cannis 54st Ranger<br>Razer 51st Sk<br>Mikaraz 37th Warrior<br></td></tr>

There isnt any better armor than those &amp; you will prob be 60 or close to it to get it.<br><br><br>&lt;&lt;Yes I am biased against anyone that says a dark elf/erudite is not as good as any other race&gt;&gt;<br><br><br>Well you have me mixed up with someone else then because I never made this comment.<br><br><br>&lt;&lt;Obiviously if ogre/trolls were the best race choice they would all be ogre/troll warriors and there would be no ogre/troll Shadowknights because quite frankly why would anyone want to be a second rate tank by your criteria of what a tank is. I mean a ogre/troll warrior gets hps bonuses and the amount of damage is pretty good.&gt;&gt;<br><br><br>I disagree totally.  It easily could be argued that that is exactly WHY a person would want to play those races--for the challenge of it.  A great player playing a WAR is probably going to get more out of that character then a terrible player playing a ORG WAR.  Further, many people have a burning desire to be different which also might factor into the mix.  I dont know, nor do I very much care.  But I did NOT make the criteria--Verant did.  The numbers are what they are--I didnt make them up.<br><br><br>&lt;&lt;What I am trying to say is that your stereotypical view of what makes a tank is what perpetuates the idea that dark elf/erudites should be passed up for groups as they can't &quot;tank&quot;.

Please see my other post where I discuss this further.  I group with ANYONE &amp; EVERYONE, including NECs/WIZs/MAGs--they are all great.  Some FOOLS though, have a total misunderstanding that they done bring anything to the table &amp; that perception is just not right.  As a matter of fact, its just plain stupid.<br><br>What you guys are missing, however, is that a DE/ERU SK cannot tank as well as a ORG/TRL SK (all things being equal).  <br><br>If you want to bitch at someone, bitch at Verant--THEY MADE THE NUMBERS UP--I DIDNT.<br><br>Lunatic<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
