<p><b><font color="#000066">September 30, 1999:&nbsp; I am glad to see
that Verant is finally adding some zones to Odus.&nbsp; In case you haven't
read their development pages, three new zones are planned for the Erudin
area over the next few months, and the Temple of Solusek Ro is supposed
to be available as soon as October.&nbsp; This is great.&nbsp; Right now,
the entire continent is being used to either level newbie Erudites up far
enough to get them to Antonica or to go to briefly to buy spells or other
items.&nbsp; Most nights, there are barely 15 people in the whole continent.&nbsp;
I updated the zones section to reflect the future additions.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">I have been told that some people have gone
around claiming to be from this site and asking to see items in trade windows
and such.&nbsp; First of all, I am presently the only one who works on
this site, and I play on the Povar server.&nbsp; Second, when I am in the
game, I won't bother people about site-related things, because I prefer
to spend the limited time I can find to play the game actually playing.&nbsp;
The reason I put my server up top is because people do have this name on
other servers, and I don't want anyone to confuse them for me.</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000066">September 29, 1999:&nbsp; Whew.&nbsp; Big day.&nbsp;
I am introducing a new section to the site: <a href="http://auctionmall.onewebplace.com/AllaKhazam/">AllaKhazam's
Everquest Auctions</a>.&nbsp; This is launched in conjunction with
<a href="http://www.onewebplace.com/">One
Web Place</a>, a well established and reputable online anction site which
has extensive experience in running online auctions of this type.&nbsp;
Why an EQ auction site?&nbsp; Well, people have been using e-bay to buy
and sell Everquest items and accounts for months now.&nbsp; While e-bay
is an excellent general auction site, it is not geared for this type of
auction.&nbsp; An Everquest-specific auction site is better for a variety
of reasons.&nbsp; 1)&nbsp; On any given day there are usually over 1,300
EQ items for sale on e-bay, and the only way you can find the items that
match your character and server is to manually page through the whole list
and read the description of each one.&nbsp; Since AllaKhazam's site is
specifically and solely for Everquest items, you can specify server and
item type and immediately see whether there are items for sale which you
can use.&nbsp; It is also flexible to the needs of the users and can be
customized further if necessary.&nbsp; In fact, the addition of class and
race specific listings is being considered;&nbsp; 2) Because One Web Place
is a smaller and more specialized auction site than e-bay, they will be
better able to police the items put up for sale to help keep unscrupulous
folks from bidding up the price, and can be more responsive to the requests
and complaints of their customers;&nbsp; 3)&nbsp; The site will soon have
access to the Magical Realm's item image files, which has images of the
majority of the items available in the game, so that you can see exactly
what you are bidding on, and it is linked directly from the Magical Realm,
so that you can consult the equipment lists to see what you are getting
in comparison to what is available within the game;&nbsp; 4)&nbsp; It costs
less than e-bay to list an item here and, because it is smaller and EQ-specific,
you will actually get better overall service.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, in
order to get the site established, One Web Place has agreed to waive all
fees for listing items until October 15, 1999.&nbsp; So if you were thinking
of listing something on e-bay, bring it here instead, and be sure to take
advantage of the free listing period.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">Because I have added a number of new sections
over the last couple of months, I have rearranged the table of contents
frame to make it more manageable and easier to find what you are looking
for.&nbsp; Also, under the theory that you can never have too many maps,
I've gone through all of the zones and added links to the excellent maps
on <a href="http://www.everlore.com">Everlore</a>, so there is now an additional
map link in almost every zone.&nbsp; I am aware that the links to Xezol's
maps and blacksmithing guide are not working, but since I don't know if
this is permanent or just temporary, I am leaving them up for a while.&nbsp;

Don't ask me why I could get online but not connect to the update server.&nbsp;

<p><b><font color="#000066">September 14, 1999:&nbsp; Supplemental Update:&nbsp;
Several people have e-mailed me requesting that I add a chat room.&nbsp;
I was looking through the web for software when it occured to me that I
already have one.&nbsp; Doh!&nbsp; Way back when, when this site was on
xoom, I had signed up with delphi for a message forum.&nbsp; I stopped
using it when I switched to gamestats and added my own board, but it is
still there.&nbsp; The forum includes a nice chat feature which nobody
ever used back then (but hey, most people didn't use the board either).&nbsp;
Of course, probably 100 times more people use this site now than did back
then.&nbsp; So I've added a link to that chat room in the index.&nbsp;
You will have to sign up for a free delphi membership to use it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If people like it, I can try to schedule set times&nbsp; and topics for
discussions and such.&nbsp; I'll also try to stop in now and then to see
if people are really using it and answer any questions.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">Whew.&nbsp; Verant was busy yesterday (and
so was this site - almost 35,000 visits).&nbsp; I'm not going to repeat
the same patch message you saw in the game and on 20 other sites.&nbsp;
However, there were some changes made that aren't mentioned in the patch
message.&nbsp; I'm sure there are others that I don't know of, but here
is what I know:</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- There is a new monster
called a shadow man, which has been reported in West Commonlands, South
Ro, South Karanas and Kithicor.&nbsp; They are somewhere in the 20's in
level, sometimes have necro pets, and drop good cash and shadowed weapons,
which are warrior only magical versions of the normal weapons.&nbsp; I
have images for a number of them posted in the weapons section.&nbsp; They
also drop items which may be quest items, so I would presume there is at
lest one quest out there that involves these creatures.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Several items have had
changes made to them.&nbsp; The glowing Stein is now the Stein of Moggok
and actually looks like a stein instead of a lantern.&nbsp; It can be equipped
in either hand and has the following stats:&nbsp; +5 dex, +10 int, +10
hp, +25 sv disease,&nbsp; 2 charges of light healing and acts as greater
light source.&nbsp; The quest has changed too.&nbsp; The koalindl fish
and Erud's Tonic are now no drop lore items, and the honey jum costs 3
pp instead of 5 gp.&nbsp; The order of Thunder no longer has an AC of 2.&nbsp;
The box of abu-kar now only reduces weight by 10%.&nbsp; And the Flowing
Black Robe has a new appearance.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Several vendors now sell
patterns for the missing patchwork pieces.&nbsp; (I have been told of at
least one in Misty Thicket)</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- There is now a ranger
guildmaster named Morin Shadowbane located in Kithicor Forest.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- You can no longer get
Knight cards from Zenita D'Rinn, and probably can't get them from Moodoro
as well.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- There must be a new high
level quest involving collecting various spheres.&nbsp; I have been told
of two (sphere of fear, and sphere of unrest) dropped by high level mobs.&nbsp;
Keep an eye out for the quest.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Several new items have
been added.&nbsp; I have a few listed, but if you run across anything new,
please send it in.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Many more quest items
have become no drop.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">I have updated the <a href="Commands.htm">commands
page</a> to include all of the new emotes that were added yesterday.&nbsp;

there had to be a real time bomb in there.&nbsp; Alas, there's very little
there that would surprise anyone who has played the game for more than
a few weeks, and since it consistantly emphasizes that the players should
be treated with respect, it might have done Verant more good than harm
to allow its circulation.&nbsp; Instead, by throwing such a hissy fit,
they look like they have something to hide and will just make people even
more suspicious of the guides and gms, who already have a pretty thankless
job.&nbsp; Just more proof that technical genius doesn't always translate
into common sense.</font></b>
