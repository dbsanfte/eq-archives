	   <tr><td colspan=2>look here, i don't know about all these people saying they 125 WIS and are not having any trouble, if that is true, then they are either :<br><br> A. level 12 or under.<br><br> B. not doing their job.<br><br> C. Die an awful, awful, lot.<br><br> Let me see if i can make this clear to starting shamen. WIS EQUALS MANA.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;       MANA = POWER<br><br> To the poster that said they are only ever at half mana so it doesn't matter, what a bunch of BALONEY. <br><br> Yes, it DOES matter, half of 100 for example is 50, with a low WIS index, half of 200 is 100,<br>with a HIGH WIS INDEX, even at half mana it is still DOUBLE the available mana of someone with a much lower WIS index!<br><br> Your goal, is to MAX your WIS at 200, then SLOWLY back off, to max your AC as much as possible, while retaining your WIS index of 200, or as close to it as humanly possible.<br><br> This requires a diligent and arduous search for the right pieces available in the game, but yes my friend, to a Shaman, WIS is king, and 200 is<br>your goal, after 40 if you dont have it, you are in for a world of hurt.<br><br> don't sacrifice a ton of AC for it, it can be done with a combination of the right pieces, but if you dont have at least 185 WIS or so by level 40, you are simply not going to be able to keep up, whether with canna , regen , and clarity or no, your TOTAL available mana pool will be so low at say 140 WIS that yoiur spell costs will be so high that to be effective your pull rate will have to be so slow before you go oom that no one will want you after you start slowing the groups pulls down , or even worse someone dies as a result of you going oom in a fight.<br><br> 200 WIS gives you your max mana pool at any given level, and it becomes increasingly important as you get higher, and anyone here or anywhere else who try's to tell you different is pulling your chain, clueless, or both.<br><br> Yes, in some situations you can get by with a lower WIS, but not below 185 or so past 40, and thats pushing it.<br><br> You are not a melee oriented player, you are caster oriented, and its kind of hard to cast with no mana, and low WIS equals low mana pool, is that clear?<br><br> Try this, take ALL you WIS gear off, and med to FULL. Then quickly put all your WIS boost gear back on, you should notice your mana bar drop WAAAAAY down, this represents mana gain, off your boost gear, which is your then, total available mana pool.<br><br> That means thats much more you can cast before going oom. When creating a shaman, you put EVERY POINT you can inti WIS it will let you, anything else, drop in stamina for HP.<br><br> Yes, if you didnt do this, you can maybe make it, but it ain't right, and it is not OPTIMAL.<br><br> Thats the way it is, and if anybody try's to tell you different, they are either just plain out wrong or trying to cover the fact that they created their character with crappy stats and are now trying to say it doesn't matter.<br><br> It does so matter, and the further along in game you go, the more obvious it will become if your total WIS index is way low.<br><br> Not trying to be a wise guy but thats the bare facts , go to any INT based caster board and try to sell them on the premise that 150 INT is as good as 200, and they will laugh you right off the Board, and just because Shaman have some limited tanking ability  and a  pet does not <br>change the fact that their / our primary role is a caster and to be the best you can at this requires you to have the largest mana pool you can get, and the way to do that is to obviously <br>have as high a WIS as you possibly can. <br><br> I hope all this is now clear to any people wanting to start a new shaman, and to the cluless wonder that downed iksar for a starting race because they were "weak" , you have got to be kidding me, high natural AC is a great asset, and high natural regen = constant mana  after 34 when you throw a regen on and the two effects "stack", then you use canna to convert regened HP to mana.<br><br> With the new Iksar armor drops in HATE , i'd be hard pressed to justify objectively anyone starting a shaman  that WASN'T iksar based solely on starting stats, not saying you CAN'T make another race work, but it wouldn't be OPTIMAL.<br><br> i love playing both my shaman and am trying to help, i cant believe some of the misguided info put up here, plse. people learn the FACTS about your Class and its attributes and abilities BEFORE creating one and if you didnt, well ,you <br>certainly are not the first one to have made that error,but please don't post here that "it don't matter", because yes, it DOES.<br><br> It is the difference between being good, and being the best. being most of what you can be, or being all of what you can be.<br><br>                Nebulonn  <br> <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

He has the experience of playing a shammy from waaaaaaay back when this game was new, judging from his post dates, and having followed him in his exploits and commented on them extensively myself for many months, I submit to you that when he says 200 WIS is a goal, not a requirement, and that utilizing 50% of his mana pool in any given situation is the reality of shamanistic life in EQ, he knows of what he is speaking.<br>Now, if you wanna talk about high level monkeys, on the other hand, I would be willing to dispense advice as necessary...<br><br>Pusbag Infection, King of the Trolls<br>&nbsp;<br>Emperor and Shamanic High Priest of the Trolls<br>"Worship Innoruuk, you worthless cattle!"<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Yar, I'd have to concurr with both these guys on that point. We SHOULD have a high base of wisdom points (say 150-180) but by no means at all do we need 200 wis and I doubt that we'll ever get to use that much in one fight. There are some classes that need ultra-high wis/int points such as clerics and wizards because their job is strictly mana expensive and is NONSTOP casting in many situations. Shamans however are not meant to work in such a way, they assist, supervise, dot, and buff and inbetween get many a chance to throw in a few hits & regain mana/HP&nbsp;&nbsp;through regen,cannibal,etc. We're a very balanced class as shamen with great highlights and lots of character that's what makes them the class to be for me, probably the only class I can stand to play for too long. Plus hey, at least playing a shaman takes more personal strategy than say, playin a warrior or a necro. There's no clear cut way to play a shaman it's very versatile so do what works for you but remember what the shaman's purposes and strengths are.<br><br>Annoc<br>Preist of Cazic Thule <br>Innoruuk Server<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Noone has claimed at 40+ having a 125 wisdom is not a big deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;I happen to agree that 165 is the floor you should have by level 40 if at all possible.  However, your assertion that 200 wisdom is &gt;required&lt; is completely false. <br><br>*edit*<br>I believe I made the claim that I am seldom over *75m* in a group, and that it doesn't make a difference.  So I am full of it?  Whatever.  A huge mana pool is only good for three things.<br><br>#1) Camp break ins.  More mana= being able to control or recover a situation better.<br><br>#2) Soloing.  By the time you hit 40+ as a Shaman, if you are still soloing as your main means to gain xp, then be a Necromancer or Druid.  We are the spell caster equivilent of a rogue.  We can do OK by ourselves, but our effectiveness is multiplied in a group.<br><br>#3) Showing off.  Hey d00d, I have a 200 wis, +600 in mana gear, so I take 10 minutes longer to med to full than you, HAHAHAH.  *rolls eyes*<br><br>I guess I am "pulling your chain, clueless, or both".  You assertion that under 200 wis is not &gt;optimal&lt; is a joke.  Yes, it is nice to be able to swap in more Ac/hp/resist gear at higher level.  But unless you are someone who has made it to the point where all you do is raid, it is not the be all end all.  No, 150 wisdom is not as good as 200 wisdom.  Noone will argue that point.  But it is not 100%, you have to have it or you can't do your job, you SuX0r important.<br><br>I guess I should point out your optimal comment is essentially correct.  However, you use the word as if it is a requirement, not the ideal situation.<br><br>As to not being optimal if you pick a non iksar...  Whatever.  I love people who try to claim that one race/class combo is the only way to play.  It is like the Woodelf/Halfling Druid vs all the rest debate.  While they have a little more flexibility when it comes to swapping in and out gear, they start out with 5 more wisdom than a human.  Oh, no.  Human Druids have no chance of getting a 200 wisdom, they suck, don't play them.  Uh, oh, Half Elf Druids have no chance of getting a 200 wisdom, they suck, don't play them.  Built in regen is a wonderful thing, but it is not a must have item.<br><br>The only time that lower wisdom makes a difference is when you HAVE to swap equipment out for resists.  And the times this is important (read life or death) is the 55+ game.  As long as you can manage a 170ish (or higher) wisdom by level 40+, and still manage to crack the 800 AC barrier, you are absolutely fine.  Once you can raid and get the Uber gear, then worry about 200 wisdom.<br><br>And just to let you know, I run with a 185ish Wisdom at 51, and an 800+ ac as a Barbarian.  I have yet to "go oom that no one will want you after you start slowing the groups pulls down , or even worse someone dies as a result of you going oom in a fight."  How many times have you seen this?  Level 51 Shaman LFG.  What is your Wis?  185.  Oh, you Sux0r, you HAVE to have 200 wis, n00b33.<br><br>Do you even know what a shaman does at the higher level game?<br><br>#1) We token buff.  Stats are &gt;generally&lt; useless with a few exceptions.  But we buff everyone up because it makes them happy, and adds a minor amount of effectiveness. Our other buffs (speed, Tuna etc) or more important in general.  Read some of the more serious messege boards and you will see the experiments testing stats.  It is almost laughable.<br><br>#2)We slow the mob.  This is the #1 priority of a Shaman.  If we do NOTHING else in the fight, this is it.<br><br>#3) We root park.  This is more of a function of AC than wisdom...  And it only normally happens when the enchanter is either swamped with a bad pull, or you do not have an enchanter...<br><br>#4) We backup heal.  This includes regen type spells, and downtime healing.<br><br>#5) We keep the Cleric alive.  This is the #2 priority of a Shaman in a group.  Unless the Cleric has to aggro heal because of an icky situation, you Slow first, then watch the cleric's life bar.<br><br>#6) We keep the Enchanter alive.  Dead Enchanter= Dead party more often than not.<br><br>How much mana does this require?  Not a whole lot, at least not constantly.  We can get away with a lower mana pool because, when the chips are down (not buffing), we require LESS mana than just about any other class to have an impact.  We can spend less than 250 mana per fight (if specialization kicks in) for Turgur's Insects, not cast another thing, and everything is just fine.  If we can chip in with something else, great.  As any high level group will tell you,  that slow spell is the ONLY thing they want a Shaman for, it is our #1 priority.  75% slow is 1000 times more important than a 400 point nuke.<br><br>When mobs have 20k hp, nuking for 400 is just a sure way to get summoned.  Ebolt is almost a guaranteed way to get summoned also, especially after a slow spell.  Guess what, when you get summoned, that 200 wisdom does NOTHING for you.  AC and hp do.  They only reason you will live is because your slow spell keeps you alive in combination with your AC long enough for the tanks to taunt the monster off you.  Try emergency tanking a Frosticube in Icewell that quads for 220, and see how much good that 200 wisdom does for you.  And please, don't try to tell me that if you get aggroed, you aren't doing it right.  Getting aggroed is a way of life in the higher game.  Mob aggro 50+ is so screwy, you have a hard time avoiding it occasionally.  Sometimes, not matter what that warrior does, the monster just refuses to let go of you.<br><br>200 wisdom is a goal, not a requirement.  Anyone who tells you otherwise is either jerking your chain, clueless, or just trying to up the price of their wisdom gear the want to sell.  Or maybe all three.<br><br>Gorthin Spiritcaller<br>51 Shaman BB<br>188 Wisdom 800+ AC, and always did fine when his wisdom was in the 170's    <br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
