<p><b><font color="#000066">November 28, 1999:&nbsp; I hope everyone had
a nice holiday.&nbsp; Sorry about the lack of updates, but I was out of
town visiting family.&nbsp; I put about 50 new images into the <a href="equipment/fashion/Fashion_Table.html">fashion
table</a> .&nbsp; It's getting a nice variety of images.&nbsp; Feel free
to submit images for any slots or armor/robe types that are not filled.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">November 24, 1999:&nbsp; Happy Holidays.&nbsp;
I'm doing an early update for two reasons.&nbsp; The most important reason
is to announce a terrific charity drive being sponsored by Gamestats called
<a href="http://www.gamestats.com/specials/lovegames/goe99/">Games
of Encouragement</a>.&nbsp; In the spirit of the holidays, Gamestats and
its many affiliates are asking the visitors to these sites to donate games
and/or money to the Ronald McDonald House.&nbsp; For those of you who don't
know about this worthy charity, it is dedicated to providing support and
care for children with life threatening illnesses such as cancer.&nbsp;
When Gamestats told me about this charity drive, I thought it was a terrific
choice of charities, both because of the quality of the Ronald McDonald
House and because who is better suited to help out these children than
the gaming community - and more specifically in this case the Everquest
community - who, no matter what the age range, are basically children at
heart.&nbsp; The above banner will remain in place until after the Christmas
Holidays.&nbsp; Please feel free to follow the link and read more about
it and provide a donation to this wonderful organization.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">The second reason for this quick update is
to say that I have taken down the popup ad (again).&nbsp; I know.&nbsp;
I know.&nbsp; I hear the groans.&nbsp; As you may recall, I initially said
it was going up for a week for mutual evaluation to determine the exact
value of the ad and the effect on the visitors to the site.&nbsp; As it
turned out, I don't feel the final offer is enough to justify subjecting
the great visitors of this site to the ad each time they come here.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">Addendum:&nbsp; I have done another large update
of the rapidly expanding <a href="equipment/fashion/Fashion_Table.html">fashion
table</a>.&nbsp; The following sections also have new or updated information:
</font><a href="equipment/chest.htm">Chest

<p><b><font color="#000066">November 23, 1999:&nbsp; Another large update
of the<a href="equipment/fashion/Fashion_Table.html"> fashion table</a>
.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll try to get some of the other things up tomorrow.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">November 22, 1999:&nbsp; Whew.&nbsp; I'm wending
my way through the fashion submissions, so if you sent something in, be
patient.&nbsp; It may not have been rejected.&nbsp; I just might not have
gotten to it yet.&nbsp; This is another large update of the<a href="equipment/fashion/Fashion_Table.html">
fashion table</a>.&nbsp; Another reminder to only submit one armor type
for each character (let everyone get a chance), and to put it in gif or
jpg form.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, no enchanter illusions or fake dark elves.&nbsp;
I only want to list what a character looks like who can truly wear the
armor being modeled.&nbsp; Also, full suits only please.&nbsp; Finally,
please check the table to make sure the combination is not already taken
before sending in a submission.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Keep them coming.&nbsp;
There are some great shots.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">In addition to the fashion images, the following
sections have new or updated information:&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> <a href="equipment/chest.htm">Chest
Slot</a> ;&nbsp; <a href="equipment/feet.htm">Feet Slot</a> ; <a href="equipment/arm.htm">Arm
Slot</a> ;&nbsp; <a href="equipment/head.htm">Head Slot</a> ; <a href="equipment/inventory.htm">Inventory

<a href="quests/Q_Misty.htm">Misty

<p><b><font color="#000066">November 21, 1999:&nbsp; Yet another update
of the rapidly expanding
<a href="equipment/fashion/Fashion_Table.html">fashion
table</a>.&nbsp; A couple rules of thumb you should follow when sending
in pictures:&nbsp; To give everyone a chance to model, I am only taking
one armor type per character;&nbsp; take a full screen shot with no windows;&nbsp;
please don't send shots of the same character under different illusions,
especially ones of a race that can't normally wear the armor;&nbsp; make
the load size of the image as small as possible while keeping a good quality
shot.&nbsp; Remember to put in the subject line the race, gender and armor
type.&nbsp; It makes it easier to sort through the pictures.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">I also updated the following sections: </font><a href="equipment/head.htm">Head
Slot</a> ;&nbsp; <a href="equipment/feet.htm">Feet Slot</a> ; <a href="equipment/wrist.htm">Wrist
Slot</a> ; <a href="equipment/arm.htm">Arm Slot</a> ;&nbsp; <a href="quests/Q_Rathe_Mountains.htm">Rathe
Mountains Quests</a> ;&nbsp;</b> <b><a href="Skills/Smithr.htm">Blacksmith
Recipes</a></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">November 20, 1999:&nbsp; Addendum - I have
updated the fashion section again with many new images that have been sent
in.&nbsp; Remember to take your pictures in the full screen mode with no
tables open.&nbsp; Feel free to pose, cast a spell or whatever and when
you do the conversion try to make your image as low a resolution as possible
to save space but still look good.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">As I've started to put together the armor and
robe images, I realized it needed to be made for each race and gender in
order to cover all of the various looks and styles.&nbsp; I have put together
the initial section with the images that were sent in last night.&nbsp;
I called it the <a href="equipment/fashion/Fashion_Table.html">Everquest
Fashion Tables</a>, and it is coming along nicely but still has a long
ways to go to cover every armor set and robe.&nbsp; If you have a full
set of armor not covered in the table and you wish to submit a screenshot,

<p><b><font color="#000066">November 19, 1999:&nbsp; I finally worked my
way through most of my mail and am almost, but not quite, caught up again.&nbsp;
I have a large update today.&nbsp; First is a terrific article sent in
by Gern Blensten called <a href="editorial/111999_hangover.htm">Everquest
Hangover</a>.&nbsp; It is linked through the <a href="editorial/Editorials.htm">editorial
section</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, I was given a good suggestion for a new
addition to the equipment section.&nbsp; I would like to compile images
of characters wearing full suits of the various types of armor and the
various robes, so that everyone can see what they look like.&nbsp; If you
have a character who owns the full set of a type of armor or a caster robe
beyond the basic apprentice types, please take a picture, change it to
jpg or gif format (this is important as I am going to get a lot of images
and will probably just delete any bitmaps) and send it in.&nbsp; Now I
can imagine that I will get multiple submissions for some armor types,
and I only see the need to put up one of each type, so please don't be
disappointed if I choose not to use your picture.&nbsp; Also, while I may
expand this to cover weapons and such later, right now I want to concentrate
on the armor and the robes.</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000066">November 17, 1999:&nbsp; This update comes
late and is brief because I spent the last several hours reading through
all of the e-mail I recieved.&nbsp; I must say that I am humbled by all
the support that poured in.&nbsp; I wish I could have answered each e-mail,
but then I would never get around to updating the site. I realize that
I was indeed catering to the vocal minority and ignoring my instincts.&nbsp;
I know from experience that vast majority of the people who come here and
play the game are great people.&nbsp; Where else can you log onto a game,
shout for a group, link up with 5 strangers and invariably have a good
time.&nbsp; It's one of the things I love about the game.&nbsp; At the
urging of many people, I am going to put the popup ad back up.&nbsp; However,
I promise this.&nbsp; It will only be in the banner frame, so it should
only show up when you first log onto the site and will not reappear unless
you refresh the whole site.&nbsp; Also, I believe that the ad presently
leads to a bunch of high quality sites and offers, but if that content
deteriorates, I will take it down immediately.&nbsp; I will also try to
be better at forewarning everyone about major changes in the site in the
future.</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000066">November 16, 1999:&nbsp; After I removed the
popup ad yesterday, I have to say I felt little desire to work on the site
for a while.&nbsp; I didn't start this site to make money, but I enjoy
making a buck as much as the next person.&nbsp; And after spending several
hours a day working on this site since March to try to create and maintain
the best EQ resource I can, I was offered a lot of money (to put the offer
in perspective, I graduated with an advanced degree 11 years ago and the
offer was more money than I was making for my job only a few years ago
- it is also more than I make on all the other ads, etc. on the site combined)
to put up an ad that pops up when you first enter the site with a yes-no
question.&nbsp; If you click no, it disappears and if you click yes, it
opens a new window into a site with links to various legitimate site and
software offers such as Delphi Forums, Priceline.com, The Wallstreet Journal,
USA.net and even Sony.&nbsp; I got bombarded with negative e-mails.&nbsp;
Some were just nasty.&nbsp; Quite frankly if keeping the ad up would have
lost those visitors, I would have put more up.&nbsp; Others were more well
reasoned.&nbsp; Every time I make a change, I get complaints, so that doesn't
shock me (heck some people wrote to complain about the new graphics).&nbsp;
I figure that shows how much people care about the site.&nbsp; It was the
volume and anger of the responses that caused me to decide to take the
ad down.&nbsp; I personally can't see how taking an extra second to click
on a mouse should cause such angst, but while this is indeed "my" website,
I try to make it something everyone who comes here will enjoy, and this
was obviously something that bothered a lot of people.&nbsp; I will say
that people are spoiled by the internet.&nbsp; Such a great amount of information
is available for free at just the click of a button that people seem to
lose perspective on the amount of work actual people put in to put that
information up.&nbsp; There is a reason that 99% of the websites out there
are out of date and never updated.&nbsp; People sign up with xoom or geocities
or whatever and get their free site and think how cool it will be to whip
together a website.&nbsp;&nbsp; They put together a format, write up some
copy, try to make it look nice, put it up and tell all their friends to
check it out. Then after the initial thrill wears off they start to realize
that they have only done the easy part, and it sinks in how much work it
will be to keep it up and expand it.&nbsp; At that point most people just
stop, and another skeleton of a dead website joins the graveyard of the
web.&nbsp; For those who continue, the prospect of some extra revenue is
often what decides whether a person will spend an hour or two working on
the site or will instead spend that time watching TV, playing a game or
doing some other activity. Although I haven't completely ruled it out,
I doubt that I will put the pop-up ad back.&nbsp; If it just drove away
the idiots, I wouldn't hesitate to bring it back.&nbsp; From my experience
in the game, that's really a small percentage of the Everquest community,
and I could care less about catering to that type anyways.&nbsp; Too many
people whose viewpoint I respected wrote to complain as well.&nbsp; Nonetheless,
I will not rule out other forms of revenue should they come my way, and
maybe I will also take the time to step back a bit and choose to read a
book, watch tv or play the game more often.</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000066">November 14, 1999:&nbsp; Just a quick update.&nbsp;
I'm sure you noticed the new pop up ad in the beginning (assuming that
I can get it to work).&nbsp; I agree that it is a little annoying, but
it should only pop up when you initially log onto the site and they basically
made me an offer I couldn't refuse.&nbsp; This will help me do a few more
things to improve the site.&nbsp; Upcoming is a new beastiary and an Asheron's
Call affiliate.&nbsp; I figured it wouldn't be too much trouble to a group
of people forced to click through four banners every time they enter Everquest.&nbsp;
(OK.&nbsp; OK.&nbsp; I'm rationalizing here).&nbsp; We are testing each
other out a week to see how many visits the link brings, so I would encourage
you to click yes and check out their offers.&nbsp; It is a site that offers
free products and downloads, and from what I could tell they seem to have
some nice products linked.&nbsp; After a week I will decide if it will
be up permanantly.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">I put up a new poll.&nbsp; I figured that it
