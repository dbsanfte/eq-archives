I find alot of material to other areas (ww.neriak.com, www.graffe.com etc.) but no clerics beside what can be found on neriak.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>It is widely recognized by all, that the enchanter is the one to do crowd control, whenever one of those pulls goes to hell. While he surely is the best equipped to do so, a cleric can do so as well to some extent, especially outside of dungeons.<br><br>The spells to do this with are: Root, Fear, Stun, Lull and Atone (and the various upgrades thereof).<br>Lull (and its upgrades) serve of course to pull only one mob, therefore preventing the dreaded crowd squashing your group by preventing it beforehand. The others are of use, when the screaming mobs are arriving. Fear and Stun can buy your group time (for rooting them, getting a heal off, etc.), the higher froms of fear might even get them beyond their aggro rage, so that they dont return (so seen in the Lake of Ill Omen with the goblins).<br>The best tactic is to root the guys not wanted right NOW, then to Atone them, while all move away from it. If all manage to get beyond aggro, it will leave back to its post.<br>All of these will not stop a real train, but it may make a bad pull at least not fatal. <br>As an example, I had once to use Divine Aura (which de-aggros mobs a bit on you) to give myself a shot at Wave of Fear to buy the druid the time needed to evac us. At another time I managed to enstill and atone 2 drolvargs in Karnor from a pull of 4, which were simply too much at once. <br><br>The whole point is, that you, as a cleric, can do (even if only in limited form) what is necessary to save your party. If you are working as a small group, or even as a team of two, you WILL have to use these spells, so go and train thme a bit, while you have the chance. Even if not ever really needed thenafter, if you know how to do it, you can save your party now and then.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I hope that everyone is finding what I write somewhat useful. This one is going to light alot of fires but this is from my personal experience having played my cleric for 46 levels now and seems to be pretty much standard from what i have heard from other clerics in game. I hope to clarify the role of clerics in EQ later in a clerics life. This is more geared towards new clerics of people wanting to make a cleric.<br><br>Warrior Cleric. When can we get into the mix and fight? From the early levels a Cleric can easily hold their own in combat. We have the advantage of plate armor so we can get high AC and the ability to use Blunt Weapons. No class really defines itself truely at low levels. Once We hit level 13 or so we start to really notice that we are not doing that much damage in combat compared to other classes. At level 13 meelee classes start to get dual wield and double attack which means that potentially they can do 4x the damage that we do. But, we are still called upon, at times, to engage in combat and "help out". At level 20 it becomes very noticable that we are not efficient in combat. All meelee classes have at least double attack (and dual wield if allowed by class). This means that our meelee damage output is next to none. All I can say is get used to it.<br><br>We are not meant to be combat oriented by design. You will find your weapon skills, Offense and Defense skills, all falling behind. Higher caps on weapon skills for meelee classes puts them  several steps ahead and the less you find yourself in combat the slower your skills will go up. This is the way that you entire careen will go if you are going to be a truely good cleric. But, there may be some exceptions. With the proper equipemnt (Ringed Mace of Ykesha, Etheral Mist armor, Cloak of Flames, etc) a cleric could become a formidable force in combat as a support warrior and support healer. The only way this becomes efficient is if you have another cleric in your group who is going to do the healing, if you have some very nice buffs from a friendly shaman, and your group is willing to let you try. The key is to get a VERY high dexterity. Dex will let your Ykesha proc more and that is the damage you are wanting to produce. I have yet to speak to a cleric (or read about a cleric) that can do more damage with a weapon in combat than they could with their spells in combat. Nevertheless, I am slowly accumulating my Armor and Dexterity items so that I can, for an hour or a day, be combat cleric from hell and show everyone that Clerics do NOT need to be one dimensional.<br><br>Nuking Cleric- Being a nuking cleric in a group can be alot of fun and we become very efficient at it at different levels. Again, in most cases you will want to have 2 clerics in your group, but this is far from necessary. You see, the difference between a cleric and an Intelligence caster is that we can wear armor. This can make all the difference in the world. When I cast a nuke on an undead target in Lower Guk and hit them for 585dmg they will almost always turn to me. This is not a problem. We have good hitpoint buffs and AC buffs as well as good armor to wear so we can take a pounding even from the Froglok Ghoul Lord if needed. We can also use Divine Aura and Divine Barrier to "anti-taunt" if we get too much of a beating. We never need to be healed by the other cleric as we can heal ourselves. What does this mean all together? We are totally self-sufficient when casting. I never call for help, ask for a heal, run around trying to get a mob off me and pissing off the tanks.<br><br>We also have a very nice line of Stun spells. At level 49 we have 4 stun spells that we can pretty much chain cast (with about 6 seconds of medding between each spell) and keep a mob immobilized.  This is greatly helpful against casting mobs that are tearing through your group and more mana efficient than having to heal  your entire group from a area damage spell that the mob kept casting. Our non-undead Direct Damage is average as far as mana efficiency so I tend to not use a nuking cleric tactic against live mobs. It also has a recast time, unlike our undead DD, so it is not terribly useful for quickly dropping a target. Non-undead DD does work perfectly with your stun spells as the recast time will fit into the casting time of a stun. Hence Stun/nuke/stun/nuke. It is always important to keep your skills up with your most used damage spells as fizzling when you are trying to solo can easily get you killed (I will write about Soloing later)<br><br>Bottom line with nuking cleric tactics is you really need to have 2 clerics. I often nuke in a group when i am the only cleric ONLY when I am 90% mana and we are not in any real danger. I always try to keep mana at 80% if possible. But throw in your stun's. Throw in a nuke. People will NEVER complain  if they never die and you can help take a mob out quicker which means less mana spent on healing. Preventative healing is blasting a mob into the next life. IF you do get a person complaining about it in your group, explain to them how much damage you do, keep everyone informed of your mana level. If you talk to a group while you are playing then they get "a feel" for you and will quickly learn the lesson "Never Question the Cleric".<br><br>Healing Cleric- Healing. This is what you were born for. This is what you will do 90% of your time. Med/Heal/Med/Heal. Sound boring? Only if you want it to be. The thing about a cleric is that we always seem to find ourselves as leading the group. We get low on mana, the group waits. We continually monitor the health of the entire group and we keep them healthy. Its hard to be bored when you are in a fight and need to be as efficient as possible. My spell lineup is typically this... Divine Aura, Divine Barrier, Stun 1, Stun 2, Stun 3, Greater Healing, Superior Healing and Complete healing.<br><br>Know your mana pool and spell costs. Our healing spells become more efficient as we go up in levels so it pays to be as efficient as possible. Greater healing is for your casters. As a rule, heal your casters with greater healing as soon as they start to take damage and lose a bubble of health. Greater Healing takes them right back up but you should cast immediately. An enchanter will die very quickly if you do not. Keep them healthy. Superior Healing is for your hybrids. Typically they tend to have slightly less HP than a Warrior but they also take more damage than a typical warrior. I always heal my hybrids once they have lost one and a half to two bubbles of health. Superior healing will take them pretty much to full again. Naturally your spells and level will vary than mine but the concept is the same. Med between heals, keep your group informed as to how much mana you have left and work with any backup healers if you find yourself gettting really low (40% is getting low).<br><br>Know your casting times like you know your own face. This becomes the most important thing when you are using Complete Heal. Complete heal has around a 10 second casting time. Complete heal is very mana efficient with Warriors and can be efficient with hybrids if they are taking a real beating. Timing all depends on how badly the tank is being hit and how quickly they are losing health. Typically against a single target I will CH my tank when he is at 2 bubbles of health. Some people wait to see "soandso has gone bezerk". In some cases that is a good time. In no circumstances should you not heal. For example, your tank gets just to the point when you are going to heal him with CH and then the mob switches to another tank and starts beating him/her. Heal your first tank anyways. Why? You do not want to be put into a position where you must chose which is going to live or die because the 2nd tank is now low as well and something in the room spawned and is beating the crap out of your enchanter. Use superior heal or whatever you chose, but always try to keep everyone of your tanks at 50% if multiple are getting the beat down. That way you keep everyone consistently healthy.<br><br>You may wish to vary this tactic but you will find your own niche as you play and grow as a cleric. Some clerics heal everyone all the time and keep them all at full health. This is nice and "secure" but you will find yourself always low on mana and that is not good if you really have a tough fight coming. I always tell my Tanks when a Complete Heal is coming. Once your tanks know how you play they will not worry. Every warrior trusts his/her cleric until the time when the cleric fails to keep them alive. So, never let anyone die and they will fight to the last pixel of health completely confident that you will heal them. A tank that runs is a tank that dies and a group that soon dies after.<br><br>I hope that this has given some new clerics a little to look forward to. What it comes down to is knowing your skills and the skills of the group that you are in. You decide the fate of your group so chose wisely for each situation and you will excel in EQ.<br><br>ADDITIONAL NOTE- Always use Valor/Resolution on all members of your group. Those extra HP can keep an enchanter alive an additional 3-5 seconds in a bad situation.<br>&nbsp;<br>Vilaraa Innoruuk<br>45th Cycle of Pain and Devotion<br>Priestess of Pain<br>Wrath of Innoruuk</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Greetings,<br><br>I am Balamur Stoutfaith, a 38th level Dwarven Cleric on the Morell Thule server and I speak from personal experience about what Vilaraa here mentions.<br><br>Often times, if the group is working as a team, I will be at full mana and the party will be at or near full health. I spend most of my time in the "typical" healing cleric role, in that I heal and med and then heal some more. However, if all of the party is at 90% health or above and I am at 90% mana or above, I will start to do some "preventative healing". By this I mean...<br><br>1) Stuns on casters or mobs that are dishing serious damage. In a smoothly operating group, a stun timed correctly will effectively nullify that mob completely. For example, mobs that flee at low health... stun them at quarter health (depends on how fast your tanks dish damange). Your tanks will continue to pound, and by the time the mob "wakes up" it will be trying to run and not be dealing damage anymore (wouldn't suggest this w/o someone who's dedicated to root/snare).<br>2) Nukes when there is a big pull. This serves several purposes that only a big healer would understand. Druids, Shamans and other backup healers just do not understand how big of a taunt a 650+ HP heal is.<br><br> Now let's think this through. Say your puller comes back with 3 targets. Everyone assists him, and the Enchanter mez's the other 2. At this point, 2 are aggro to the enchanter and 1 to the tanks. The second I cast a heal spell, chances are very high that the 2 mez'd will shift aggro to me, and very likely the 1 being attacked already! However, if I spend a few pixels of mana to drop a 200+ damage nuke into the first one so that it drops faster... a) Your tanks took less damage because they had to fight a shorter time, b) Your tanks have more stamina for the next fight, c) NOTHING IS AGGRO TO THE HEALER (i.e. ME). A measly 200 damage into a mob will rarely ever aggro it if it already has a target. This means that when the other 2 are engaged, or break mez on their own, I can cast again without interruption from the 2 mez'd mobs pouncing me.<br><br>This system works so well I have been in a party for several hours before anyone KNEW I was nuking at all. In fact, I once had the amusement of seeing someone ask in group chat "Is this Struck by Wrath message my weapon proc'ing?". The reason a lot of people are pre-disposed to argue a Cleric is not a nuker is because they have no experience with it. And unfortunately, neither do most clerics! More than once I have had to defend the way I keep my party healthy to clerics as much as 10 levels higher than me that knew absolutely nothing about nuking because they never EVER have done it.<br><br>It all comes down to experience and knowledge. As a Cleric, I have been nuking since day 1 and have not stopped in the 38 levels I have played. I've never had a complaint, though I have gotten in a few arguments over it (ironically, almost always with other Clerics). You just have to know when it's appropriate, when it will help more than hinder, etc. But once you know how and when to use these offensive spells, they become just one more way you can keep the party alive.<br><br>Balamur Stoutfaith<br>38th Circle of Devotion<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

The orcs drop good money and money is a clerics best friend<br><br>levels 17-22 The aviak guards in Lake Rathe, again they're always camped but I never had trouble finding a group. people love clerics<br><br>levels 22-30 Lake of Ill omen and after level 24 you can start killing giants in Frontier Mountains. the Lake is faster xp but FM has much better loot for your level. And again, clerics are always broke.<br><br>That's a step by step guide to leveling. I'd suggest spending levels 18 and 19 in unrest. It's a great place to build technique and become more accustomed to your role in the group.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Here's a tip for dwarves up until level 5 or so. if you kill skellies than you save up their bone chips and go to the paladins guild. Go past the altar and there will be a lone NPC on the left wearing patchwork and chainmail (I've forgotten his name) who will talk to you about the skeleton quest. Hold down CTRL and click on your bone chips, and put one bone chip in each 'give' slot. As you reward you receive some patchwork armor, some money and almost a bar of exp! Not bad for a level2 hey? later on he gives you rusty weapons which you can sell or use. Very handy.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well, here is part 2 to my Dark Elven Cleric strategy. I would like to warn that some of the information here may have changed in a recent patch (Ruror's Faction has changed).<br><br>At level 21 I began to learn the fine art of camping and grouping. I will say that camping does not have to be a bad thing at all with the correct group of people. If you do not like the idea of camping then you are in for a rough time of things for part of your Clerics life in EQ.<br><br>Once in the 20s we find ourselves, as clerics, to be underpowered and unwanted. Other wisdom classes get better healing spells and similar buffs and have similar advantages that we do, so this time can be tough. Do not fret. It is the uneducated masses that think this way, and it is our job to let them know that we are best suited for certain tasks. Three of these abilities are the spells Calm, Holy Might and Daring. Need a spawn broken, a cleric can do it. Need a good HP and AC buff you call a cleric, need some stun action. Cleric. Add our healing abilities and it is not long before your group comes to appreciate you as a rounded member of the group and not just a heal/med player.<br><br>I spent most of my early 20s in Rathe Mountains. There are some nice undead camps there that will give you good xp.  Giant Skelletons, barbed bone and monk skelletons are nice and can give some nice loot. Our proficiency against undead can really shine here. In your early 20s you can pretty easily get into a group in South Karana killing aviaks (more of the same), but you can also hunt some of the Centaurs that roam the zone as well as get into a group killing Treants. Treants offer up exceptional loot for their level and spawn very fast (2-3 minutes) so you can get a good steady killing there. The downside is that there is almost always a list to get into the group. (more on lists later). Treants will affect your faction with Queynos, but what the hell, those humans are not much more than animals anyways. Both the Treants and Aviaks will take you to level 29 quite easily if you decide to group there and spend some time.<br><br>In your mid-20s, when you are tired of killing those damned aviaks and treants you can also group in Rathe Mountains killing cyclops and group killing gnolls near Splitpaw. You see, the beauty of being the best healer is that you will always be needed in  a real group. At 24 you got Greater Healing so you are the best healer again. Use that to your advantage. You also got new buffs as well. Make your tanks happy and keep everyone healthy. Throw in a little chain casting of your 2 stun spells and break a spawn here or there and you are showing that you are not a heal/med/heal/med machine. I also found that in your mid-20s that it may be time to go into some dungeons. Seeing all these people with magic items and neat stuff will definitely get you heading back to Grobb or Neriak to get provisions. There are 4 nice dungeons that you may want to start checking out in your mid-20s and each is unique in its own way. Upper Guk is home to the Frogloks of Guk, Soluseks Eye (sol a) is home to a clan of gnomes as well as the Solusek Goblins, Najena in Lavastorm is home to Najena and several distinct monsters and Cazic Thule is home to two Lizardman Clans.<br><br>Again, let me stress something. To truely enjoy this game you should always explore. Go places. Do things. Sitting in the same spot will get monotonous. I do encourage all clerics to go to each of these dungeons and see the world. If you do not like a place go to the next. At this point in your life (mid 20s to mid 30s) each of the 4 above dungeons will hold their own dangers and rewards.<br><br>Level 29! I bet you have been waiting for this level. I waited. I watched as I became almost completely useless in meelee combat and my Direct Damage was pitiful compared to other casters. Let me say this... Do not Give up hope on your cleric. Level 29 is your return to glory.<br>The Wrath of Innoruuk is with you now. You get some nice spells (divine barrier, wrath, AC buff, etc) and it is time to use them. At level 29 you can go toe to toe with any other caster and be effective. Other classes have caught up to you in healing power but you now have the offensive power. Someone wants to heal the group, let them. Your turn to break out of the mold. You also get your first resurrection spell (revive) which is a great tool for getting that dead tank back to his body.<br><br>At level 29 I found a few really good places to go if you are open to some risk. Hop on a boat and head on over to Kunark. The Overthere zone is ripe for you at this point. You may wish to avoid casting offensive spells here as everything in the zone will pretty much kick your butt, but you should be able to find a good group and all you need to do is keep em healed. I found a guild to join here that was up to my standards and made alot of friends (that crazy biting and drooling Dark Elf Cleric). If you have trouble here at 29, wait a few levels.<br><br>Another place that I found, if you want to get some decent money and good XP is to kill Druids. Damned tree huggers attack you anyway. East Karana has a druid ring that is just what you need. 3 druid spawn on a 4 minute spawn time. fast and efficient killing. I used this to get me through my first "hell" level and did it in no time. Be warned that killing druids will hurt your faction. level 29 is also a good time to take your first steps into Lower Guk. Lower Guk is a bit tough early on.<br><br>The thing about Lower Guk (and most dungeons as I am sure you know by now) is the Trains. Trains of monsters are a way of life in dungeons. Its how younger players learn "I better not try that again" and older players "damned trains". Lower Guk is nice as it has 2 sides. The Live side with living frogloks, and Dead Side, with Undead Frogloks. I do not need to tell you which side you should try your hand in. Dead Side is awesome. even at 29 working near the zone you get a good feel for the initial layout of the zone. you learn about trains and you learn to manage your mana down to the millisecond keeping your groups alive. You will almost always be able to find a group here and you can, if you really wanted to, stay here all the way until your low 50s in level. Your true power comes though at level 34 with Superior Healing. Nobody gets superior healing but you (except for a few classes who get it after level 50). You also get new Undead DD, hp buff, stun, etc. Other really good places to hunt during your high 20s to low 30s are Frontier Mountains, Lake of Ill Omen and Warsilks Woods. The Kunark zones will have rare spawns that can get you some decent items for your level aswell as some good experience. But beware of spell casters. They can be nasty in Kunark at that level.<br><br>From Level 34-45 the world pretty much opens up for you completely. You will start to become more set into the healing aspect of being a cleric and going into the leadership role in a group. I hear alot of people complain about this and I do not understand why. At level 35 you no longer need to meditate looking at your spellbook so you can watch the action. You learn how to time your spells better, you learn when you need to add that extra nuke into the mix, when you need to chain stun something. You learn how to work solo again with Specters and Hall wanderers in Lower guk.<br><br>The key to success and not being stereo typed is to keep everyone in your group alive. Do NOT let them die. once you have learned to do that without wasting mana and time, you can easily add your other abiliities to a fight. The Froglok Ghoul Lord goes down alot quicker after I have pumped him with 3-4 Expel Undead spells. I always keep my mana in good shape and learn to meditate at all times and learn the pace of your group. Watch everything and keep everyone informed. Keep everyone buffed. Once you earn the trust and respect of those you are fighting with then everyone starts to have more fun as they KNOW that you have them covered.<br><br>During these levels you will want to experience Solusek B and get some Runed Mithril Bracers, Lower Guk, Permafrost, several Kunark Dungeons and outdoor zones. I was not happy being a cleric until I got into the 30s and made some good friends and explored the world. Go to all the places that you want. and remember, kill everything. You are a Dark Elf Cleric Of Pain. Give it out as often as possible because you will get it. Keep everyone healthy and SHOW them some of your other abilities. You will suprise them.<br><br>NOTE- Stun spell.<br>I have spoken with several enchanters about this and it seems to work. Your level 5 spell "stun" will not break a mezmerise because it does not do damage. This is a perfect spell to help your enchanter get a mob off and cast mez. Even if the mob gets mez before your spell hits, it will not break. Try and talk to your enchanters. It can be a real life saver for them.<br><br>NOTE- camping<br>camping can suck but most people who are doing the camping (at least on my server) keep everything fair. The "play nice" rules keep everything open fairly well. The boredom of camping is doing it with a bad group. A good group that camps will not have downtime. Continual pulling and conversation make camping actually fun. Talk to your group. emote them. enjoy the time. make friends. tell stories when you are not fighting. EQ is what you make it. So make it fun.<br><br>NOTE- coming soon:<br>If this is as well received as my Dark Elf Cleric 1-20 article, I will post some of my specific strategies for different dungeons and different mobs as well as group tactics as well as solo tactics for the cleric.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Vilaraa Innoruuk<br>45th Cycle of Pain and Devotion<br>Priestess of Pain<br>Wrath of Innoruuk</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>There are 3 stages in most clerics lives involving what they equip as their primary weapon.  At low levels, a 2 hand blunt will let you deal 20ish pts of damage per swing, killing many 1-10 mobs in just a few swings.  This will let you level faster at these low levels, but is not a good overall choice for later.  <br>   After the first few levels(1-10ish) it is time to start using one hand blunt.  The reason for this is not damage dealt per swing, but amount of stat bonuses per item held.  Example: 1 hand weapon and a shield together can give you 10/30 attack speed, but also together they add +17wisdom(which is more mana)10 ac, and a few other smaller stat modifiers.  Now a 2hand blunt weapon will give you an attack of 16/40, but with only 5 wisdom, NO ac, and little other stat increases.  Considering how ineffective at melee clerics are, it is pointless to waste 2 slots on one item as you move up in levels.  <br>   At very high levels most clerics give up ALL weapons because there are non-weapon items that add better stat increases and mana than weapon choices.  Occasionally we pull out the old "beat down stick" just to have some fun, but it is at the cost of what we need most, "mana and ac."<br>    So with this in mind young clerics, I don't recommend saving money up for that expensive bashing 2 hander, instead save the cash for a good one hand weapon and shield, and do what we do best  "Keep folks Alive"<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Good comments. There are more and more good 1HB weapons appearing in the game which have +wis increases as well as other stat modifiers. Coupled with a CGS or Aegis of life they make much more sense than wielding a 2HB weapon. Use the 2HB sparingly to get skill up maybe, but as melee opportunities decrease you are better aiming for a Paw of Opolla/testement of Vanear etc than a weapon. Keep one in your bag for emergencies though =)<br><br>Usna<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The capability to stun is one of the cleric's best tools in the game.<br><br>We get our first stun very early on.  It does no damage, but will stun the target for up to 12 seconds or so.<br><br>It can be a lifesaver even at low levels.<br><br>Those pesky casting orcs and madmen?  With well-timed stuns you and/or your group will take very little spell damage.<br><br>The next stun, Holy Might, does up to 60 points of damage.  This is another extremely useful stun.  Because it costs very little mana, but packs a nice punch, it makes a perfect addition while fighting casters, but also to take out a running mob, or stop it long enough for tanks or other casters to kill it.<br>Care must be taken when grouping with bards or enchanters who use mesmerize spells because the damage from Holy Might will break mez.  Stun will not.<br><br>Each additional stun spell clerics get do more damage.  Mana efficiency can be tripled if you use stuns with care - 2 or 3 memmed at one time is perfect for a group fighting casting mobs.  Especially wizard/enchanter type mobs (i.e., the evil eyes in Beholder, any shaman or wizard mob, etc.).  Timing the stuns is the key - work with it a bit in a full group to get it down.<br><br>Especially in groups with enchanters, or pure casters who overnuke, stun can be a real lifesaver.  I frequently use it to assist the enchanter during big pulls.  The key is to stun the target of the mez before it's mezzed, if possible.  Basically, the enchanter needs time to mez the critter, and they can't do it if they're getting the tar kicked out of them.<br><br>To sum it up - <br>Stuns are perfect for casting mobs (keep in mind that giants and dragons, as well as some wurms, are not stunnable).  It keeps them from casting and saves a great deal of mana.<br>Stuns work well on running creatures, giving your group a chance to finish them off without root or snare.<br>Stuns can be an enchanter's best friend - but only Stun - the other DD/stun spells will break a mez.  Watch them carefully when casting, and duck to interrupt casting if mez takes while you're casting.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>--Salina<br>Erudite Vicar</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Of all the races of Norrath, only 7 can be clerics.  Dark elves, High elves, Humans, Dwarves, Gnomes, Erudites, and Halflings.  Each type, has there own racial abilities that add to how well the cleric can be played.  DE's have ultravision as well as hide which can be useful.  High elves have the highest wisdom for more mana, as well as infravision, making them my favorite for this class.  Humans are blind as bats but they do get an exp bonus making it easier to level.  Dwarves are probably the other best class for clerics, while they don't have as much wisdom, they make up for it in str and stamina.  Gnomes, like Dwarves, have infravison, but not too much wisdom, they make up for it in dex and agi, but those don't really come in handy.  Erudites have the second most wisdom, but like Humans, they can't see at all.  Halflings also come with the ability to hide and have infravision.<br>If you are making an evil cleric, probably you would want to pick a DE, gnomes don't really get much guild support, and most of their special quests come from Neriak anyway.  <br>Of the lighter races, High elves and Dwarves make the best clerics.  They have nice starting areas, and many quests availible to them.  They are also in a well populated area which gives them an advantage of saftey, and people to group with.<br>Erudites, aren't all that bad, with the exception of their night vision, and the completely horrid starting area.  If you are going to make an Erudite cleric, head over to Antonica from day 1 or you will have a tough time leveling.<br>Humans and gnomes, are the runts.  Halflings are slightly better, and they all have a few good bonuses, but are pretty much inferior to the other choices.<br>Gedran<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>OK, a couple of notes to add to Gedram's quality post.  As an Erudite cleric your starting area is pretty crappy, IF you are good.  If you worship Cazic-Thule and start in Paineel your starting area is actually pretty nice.  You can level here from 1-5 very quickly, with no zoning, very little risk, and almost no competetion for kills(this place is empty).  Another thing is if you start here I would recommend NOT doing any of the newbie quests.  Some of them are pretty good for low levs, but they all lower faction with the good erudites and this could give you a prob travelling through erudin(which you'll have to do).  By the way if you run through Erudin to the docks and avoid the mage guild you should be OK.<br><br>Another thing about blindness.  Human and Erudite clerics have available to them an item called a Fright Forged Helm.  It gives Deadeye(infravision and see invis) along with some nice stats( AC 11 +2str +4wis -5 char).  However it is a no-drop quest item that requires killing 2 tough rare spawns.  You probly need to be high 30's solo or 30 with a group, but the spawns are pretty rare so getting a group to wait around might be tough unless your in a guild or can bribe them.  Dont expect to get this item anytime soon, but it is a possibility and may be worth the wait and effort to be able to see.  Also note that the quest comes from Paineel, so it is no prob for evil erudites and possibly evil human clerics.  But others will probly have big faction probs.  Maybe an enchanter or bard could help you out, or maybe a wolf-form would, Im not sure.  Good Luck.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I think you're far too generalized here.  Your statement about high elves and dwarves is true in the framework that you are measuring them, but it's not strictly fair.  Following are some comments:<br><br>High Elves:  Excellent Wisdom (105), and they don't waste points on unnecessary stats like Dex (though their Int is unnecessarily high).  The only downside is their hideously poor strength, which may become a big factor later when trying to cart around bronze at low levels and Donal's at High levels.  Still, strength is not a HUGE factor.  A very good choice.<br><br>Dwarves: Good Wisdom (93), Great strength and Stamina, terrible agility.  You HAVE to put 5 points into agility with a dwarf, or you will suffer a massive AC hit because of below-average agility (75 is the break-point).  They waste a lot of points in dexterity.  Overall, though, a solid cleric.<br><br>Halflings: Above average Wisdom (90), average strength and stam, exceptional agility (which will help slightly with AC).  Wasted points in Dex.  What they lack in strength and stamina compared to dwarves they make up for with Sneak and Hide, two exceptional skills that will be invaluable throughout your career if used well.<br><br>Human: Average Wisdom (85), Good Strength.  No night vision.  There is no compelling reason to play a human cleric, but there is no reason not too.  The lower wisdom is not that much of a hindrance, especially since they have access to a couple of items the short races cannot wear (ivandyr's hoop, for instance).  I've seen plenty of well played, effective human clerics.  Human clerics of Innoruuk have access to possibly the best quest item in the game for clerics.<br><br>Erudite: Good wisdom (93), poor strength.  No night vision.  Good erudites don't have much going for them other than the sheer coolness factor (a compelling reason by itself).  Evil Erudites, though, have access to some of the best quest cleric equipment available, which more than makes up for their weaknesses (give night vision, strength, AC).<br><br>Dark Elves: Good Wisdom (93), poor strength, very good agility.  Access to (IMO) the best cleric quest item in the game.  Definitely a different experience.<br><br>Gnome: Poor Wisdom (77), poor strength, good agility, a lot of wasted Intelligence.  Has tinkering.  Gnome clerics are few and far between.  Still, there isn't any truly compelling reason NOT to play them.<br><br>From my experience, it's not the amount of Wisdom you have, it's how you use the amount you're given.  The difference between the race with the lowest wis (77) and highest wis (105) ultimately results in the ability to cast Superior heal one more time at 50th level with all else being equal.  Let me put this into perspective:  Pretend a high elf cleric has a 200 wis, and a gnome has a 172 wis.<br><br>The high elf has a total of [(200/5)+2]*50=2100 mana, meaning he can cast superior heal 8 times and have 100 mana left over.<br><br>The gnome has [(172/5)+2]*50=1820 mana, meaning he can cast superior heal 7 times and have 70 mana left over.<br><br>Quite frankly, the difference isn't that large at all.  The main objective in picking a class is choosing something you'll be happy with.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Just a question to clarify a single point in this otherwise quite enlightening post.  Mentioning having "Access to (IMO) the best cleric quest item in the game", is referring to the Regent Symbol of Innoruuk for the Engulfing Darkness spell?  I must confess that I am most anxious to prove myself worthy of this item, both for the spell and the armour and +WIS bonus.  If this was not the quest item you refer to, please educate an eager young acolyte.  *smiles*<br><br>Also, it's worth noting that we Teir'Dal also have the hide skill (as well as the toelings *wink*).  Finding a shady spot to rest *grins*, hiding, and conning even something so weak as a Fire Beetle gives us some assurance of our success, and makes meditating in the wilds a more comfortable prospect.<br><br>Avallach (9th level Priest of Innoruuk) Cazic-Thule<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Be VERY careful about the race and base stats of your cleric, they will be unchangeable, and very important later on.  <br>Strength: With my cleric, I made the mistake of not giving him enough strength.  OUCH, Clerics can wear the best armor of all the casters, unfortunately, this usually means a lot of weight.  In addition, it gives you extra power to carry loot without becoming encumbered, as well as giving more damage after lvl 20.<br>Stamina: While not important as some of the other skills, stamina partialy determines your HP's, and it also determines how long you can stay underwater, swing your blunt weapons, and jump.  It's really up to you what you want to do here.<br>Agility:  This really isn't a necessary stat for clerics.  It's good to have to help avoid hits, and it must be kept above 75 to have no AC penalty, and have more agi when you get encumbered, but don't put to many stat points into it.<br>Dexterity:  This still isn't very useful to clerics, with the exception of determining if your spells get interrupeted when your hit.(just read below that this probably is not true) So even more than before, this isn't a useful place to use up skill points.<br>Wisdom: *divine noises* This is THE MOST IMPORTANT stat for a cleric, without wisdom you have no mana, without mana you can't heal, and without heals, you might as well have been a warrior.  This determines your mana amount, plus, since this stat should be higher than your intelligence, it determines how fast you learn skills.<br>Intelligence: Amazingly, this stat isn't really all that usefull to a cleric.  In most people, it determines how fast you learn a skill, but when your Wisdom is higher it does not.  Probably, you don't want to waste your points here either.<br>Charisma: A little charisma boost never hurts, it is known to get you better prices, and is also rumored to make your buff's last longer (I can't confirm this, and I am doubting the validity of that possiblity)  It's up to you if you want to put points here.<br>Gedran<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>A few corrections:<br><br>1. Stamina- Basically accurate.  Having a high stamina is a minor help at best.  I can't think of any races that actually want to invest any starting points in it.<br><br>2. Agility- ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS have this stat at 75 or above.  If you don't you will take a substantial penalty on your armor class.  Anything above 75 adds to your AC, but in much smaller amounts.<br><br>3. Dexterity has precisely ZERO use for clerics.  Getting spells interrupted has nothing to do with your dexterity.  This was a common myth (perpetuated by the original instruction book of all things) that has since been debunked.  Also helps for weapon procs, but the difference is so small that any points put here are pretty much wasted.<br><br>4. Wisdom- agree on this big-time.  Max it out.<br><br>5. Good call on intelligence.  Never worth any extra points.<br><br>6.  Charisma- ZERO effect on buff length.  Not bad for buying/selling, but I would put points elsewhere.<br><br>IMO, you always wanna put 25 out of 30 points into Wisdom at the start, and your other 5 points where they would be needed most.  That means:<br><br>Dwarves: +5 to agility (this is VERY important)<br><br>All others: +5 to strength<br><br>This is definitely not hard and fast, and you won't be permanently screwed if you allocated points differently- it would just make your life a bit easier.  when i started my halfling cleric, the dexterity-for-interruption myth was still commonly accepeted, so I put 5 points into dex instead of strength.  The extra 5 points of strength would have been nice over my career, but it hasn't really hurt me all that much.<br><br>Puggins Fizzlefoot<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Cleric Vs. Necro:  The necro is probably the most opposite class casting wise to the cleric, therefore, most cleric spells are directly related to destroying the necro.  If you know that you will be involved in a PvP battle with a necro, try to cast your HP/AC (courage, center, etc), AC (holy armor, spirit armor) buffs which should be on anyway, as well as, resist disease, poison, fire, and, if you have it, magic.  These will give you extra resistance against the types of spells Necro's can cast.  The main danger once you get in the battle is the Necro himself( once the Necro dies his pet kills itself), not the pet.  If you must attack the pet, try rooting it, or casting a fear undead type spell, to get it off of you and take on the necro.  Casting Flash of light, which can knock out his spell casting ability, then try to get close to melee range, since you can wear better armor and interrupt his spells.  Cast a sucession of stuns, and recast of flash of light, as well as you DD If you MUST.  If you have to fight the necro pet, make sure you have Ward or Expulse Undead line of spells ready, since these, will drain Necro pet life very quickly.  Always remember to watch your mana bar and if it starts getting low, target yourself very quickly, cast a heal, and retarget your enemy.  Also remember, getting your spells off is very important, always try casting RIGHT after you are hit, or right after you stun.<br>If you have to run, know that if your health is into the last bar, you will have lost stamina and not run very fast, and always have your Divine aura memmed for that helpful 18secs of Invincibility!<br>Gedran<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hmmmm, <br><br>One wonders just how much practical PvP expertise you have.  Perhaps you mean duels, of which I have little expertise, rather than the open warfare of the Zeks of which I have ample practice (both as a cleric and necro).  Of course, your advice to have basic buffs is sound.  The resistances are nice, but many people don't seem to find time to cast them, perhaps they should find the time to have them up 100% of the time.  One important buff you left out was resist fire for the heat blood series.<br><br>As for the pet vs the necro:  a good necro will let the pet get in the first hit so you don't get the necro auto targeted.  By the time you get the pet rooted, which is a good way to deal with the pet, and begin to deal with the necro, you may well have a number of DOTs on you and you will find your movement impared.  Sure, you want to engage, melee and kill the necro, you just can't.  That pet isn't going away, it is mearly parked for a while.  Everytime the pet brakes the root, you get a new set of DOTS and a few whacks from the pet.  Time is on the necro's side.  He isn't going to stand around and go toe to toe with you, he is going to kite you like any other MOB he fights solo.  If you elect to stay around and try to win, you will die most of the time and the necro will run away the rest of the time.  Only a very green, very unlucky or very stupid necro will be beaten to death.  Of course, you can always hope that a guard or other MOB will get involved and kill the necro and/or his pet for you.<br><br>Flash of light is a great way to disrupt the necro.  However, call me a coward, but if I get the pet rooted and the necro blinded I am running or gating.  The wonderful thing about a cleric and PvP is that you are really hard to kill.  A cleric isn't good at killing other people unless he starts with a big advantage.<br><br>There are many times when you are already dead long before you realize it.  DOTs are mean that way.  Even if the pet is dead or missing, you are going to have a hard time killing the necro.  After all, he has lots of ways to run away.  (Shadow step, gate, gather shadows, darkness etc.)  <br><br>Divine aura is a lot less effective vs a necro than almost any other opponet.  When you are at 1 bubble, the DOTs on you alone might be enough to kill you.  Divine aura is not going to help with that.   Plus, Divine Aura lasts 18 seconds not 30.<br><br>Wisdom above all,<br><br>  <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I Play a Cleric on a pvp server and I would say most of this is pretty good.  You are right that a cleric  just cant deal the damage to kill somone most of the time but you can survive forever.<br><br>  Fire resist is a Must for Ignite bones at higher levels.<br><br>  What I find works much better for the pet is to either used dread of night, panic the dead, or Simply blind the pet and step back.  It will give you additional time while the pet runs back to you or got too far out of range and cant find its ways back.  <br><br>If you can get the necro blinded it is often a good idea to use DA or DB then as hopefully  if they have spell hotkeyed (which everyone should) they will then preceed to cast those dots on you while you are invulerable and not see that they are not affecting you.  Just watch out a good player will notice the buffing sound of the da and count out those 18 seconds.  <br><br>Your stuns are great too with 4 stuns at level 50 if you can get them to stick you can stop the necro from casting any spell and kill them without a problem.  It gets hard when they start draining life back.  Remember that necros now have that scream stun spell which can give them the time to cast 1 dd or dot if you dont resist it.<br><br>The other way to go would be to simply play purley defensively.  Put up your cure disease poison, nulify magic and a fast casting heal. and remove or heal anything they throw at you  try to keep them stuned out of casting the drains.  If they use 300 mana for a Eblot and you cure it with 90 mana taking less then 100 dmg they will tend to run out of mana.  Unerfed pumice are very good here too as well as antipoison potion from shaman and disease or from the spider in Kaesora. As they get lower on mana they will be in skeleform and drain their life for mana if they get confident that they dont need to worry about damage they may let it get low this is when you can pull out a retrobution and take the kill.  Becarefull if they run off as they are doing this though becaseu they can drain life back from the wildlife.  <br><br>If they run away if you plan on continuting the battle either dont let them run to refill their mana or take the time to med heal and rebuff if playing defensivly.  I once had a battle with an even con necro at 43 last 2 rl hours because i was playing defensive, my only problem is at 43 Wrath was not cutting it for the end dd and the necro resisted the stun and got out of range before I could finish her.  <br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>On a PK server such as Vallon, Tallon, or Rallos Zek, cleric spells can be a great advantage to a single pk, or a group of pk'ers.  First of all, the low lvl spell, flash of light, is one of the most useful spells both on casters, and warrior, since it blocks the player from being able to see where to go, or, unless hotkeyed, cast any spells.  The other useful spell line, is the stun spells, these can both interrupt players, and keep them inactive for a few seconds as well as, at later levels, do some DD damage.  Root can be useful in stopping people from turning and running as well.  Direct damage is not a cleric specialty unless fighting undead, such as a necro pet.  Buffs are also use full in pre battle Player vs Player fights, and will sometimes keep you from dying.<br>Gedran<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>You may hear echoed many times about how large taunts our heals are. This is true to an extent, but dealing with it is a large part of being a cleric, and it isn't insurmountable.<br><br>Hate from the primary target. This usually isn't a problem. When the puller grabs the first mob, he is typically wedged into their hatelist (some mobs that train off easily, like bats/bugs or undead, are more the exception than the rule). About the only time you'll taunt this is a few cases. If you heal just as the puller returns, before he has damaged the npc, you'll sometimes draw its aggro. If you wait for the tanks to engage the mob, even an early large heal should not frenzy it on you (as long as the tanks are taunting and such, of course). Secondly,iIf you heal a much, much lower level target with a large heal. By ratio, this has a huge taunt, so don't be surprised if when you superior heal a newbie fighting an orc pawn, the orc pawn decides to attack you. This doesn't really come up that often, but can be annoying for a newbie you decide to random help when the thing takes off at full speed from half-health. Thirdly, in very large raids (say, 18 or so melee?), with how the hatelist is limited, it is somewhat easier to go to the top of the hatelist. This can be annoying, as for relatively minor things that would never aggro under normal circumstances, you may be summoned and beaten around a bit.<br><br>Anyways, aggro from primary target is rare, if it happens ever. Sometimes clerics may make it sounds like this happens all the time- I don't think this has happened to me more than a dozen or so times in my career, mostly from the 3rd reason.<br><br>Now, the real time we get aggro'd. In multiple pulls, if the puller targets one, brings it back, and everyone sets in on the primary target. Assist is important, etc, all well in good. What happens when you heal then, of course? Well, mobs 2, 3, and 4 don't have the substantial hate that the first mob does towards the tanks. That first heal is likely to taunt all the other ones.<br><br>Fortunately, there is an awful lot you can do to deal with this. The easiest is to just work with an enchanter. Heck, in some circumstances you prefer to taunt them onto yourself with for a second, so the enchanter can get an uninterrupted mesmerization off without the resisting ones beating on him. On easier pulls, he'll taunt early by tashing the other ones to single them out with his single target mez. Help him out by timing your stuns so the targets won't interrupt his castings. If need be, drag taunted away mobs and stun/root park them away.<br><br>If not with an enchanter (or feign puller, or even bard or necro), there are a couple things you can do in multiple pulls. One is to have the puller damage each thing as he brings them back, and possibly a bit during combat. This will have the tank tanking however many things down, but give you ample time to heal and med (though be careful about taunting them to you by sitting in too close proximity to them... the more room you have to operate, the better). The problem with this method is that the tank can often, well, die on difficult pulls. Though better the tank than a total party wipeout.<br><br>Lastly, I would do root/parking. Not a replacement for an enchanter by any stretch, and I usually lean towards the tank tanking down multiple things instead to give more time for med ticks, but sometimes this is better. Don't be afraid to be decently stun heavy if you go this route (stun and holy might should do it most often), and I generally stick with immobilize. This might take some practice, but it isn't really that terrible of a solution.:)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>As you get into the range of the wonderful Atone spell, you learn to use this more and more, espcialy after casting a full heal (nothing like agroing the froglok ghoul lord). Just remember, we have spells that draw mobs, and you are going to have to deal with them in ways other than Div aura (it only lasts 17 seconds, and meanwhile, there goes your wizard) As my friends always call those spells, Minor Taunt, Lesser Taunt, Taunt, Greater Taunt, Superios Taunt, Word of Taunt, and Full Taunt. Learn how to use them to your advantage, because, sometimes you want to agro. Example, You call an evac (only pullers or the cleric should call evacs) and your druid/wizzy is getting beat on, simple solution, heal them through the nose. Suddenly, you've got his mobs, and you can hold them better then their un armored selves as they port you out. Remember, Divine Aura only saves your butt, and if that's all your trying to save, you should think twice about playing the group cleric. Div aura stops your heals, and, if any party members are left, they will be expecting heals while you can't give them. So remember, taunting can be a good thing, and don't over use your aura in groups.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Greetings,<br><br>Having the foolish notion in my Clerical head that saving EVERYONE in my party is part of my job, I occasionally find myself in the position of having to save their butts.<br><br>I can say, without a doubt, that a Cleric can save a party from almost any fate assuming a few things that are critical...<br><br>1) The party MUST listen to the Cleric and do as he or she says. Absolutely MUST. Nothing is more frustrating to a Cleric than to make a sacrifice just to have it accomplish nothing because the party ignored them.<br><br>2) As a Cleric, you have to be willing to lay down your life for your party if that is the only option.<br><br>If you have both of these going for you, here's how you can be the hero of the day.<br><br>1) Mem the AE Taunt, err... AE Heal Word of Health and whichever Divine spells you fancy.<br><br>2) Cast WoH 2 or 3 times. You should now have everythings direct attention, so tell your party to run.<br><br>3) Cast Divine as soon as you can, but NOT before your party starts to run. The reason being is that the Divine spells seem to be an ANTI-taunt, and you will immediately start losing mobs attentions.<br><br>Using this method I have stopped a train of over 30 mobs (mostly red and yellow cons) cold in it's tracks. The problem tho is the game engine will only allow a certain amount of mobs to target you. Because of this, your party NEEDs to be high- tailing it out of there so that by the time the target cycling is over the mobs that are now unable to hold you as a target will not switch to your party members. Even with that many trying their best to kill me, I still had enough time to cast the first divine spell (by then I had gone from full health to 2 bubbles!) and start following the party out, albeit making sure not to catch them. I got about half way to zone before dying, but my entire party got out totally unharmed as did a bunch of people standing at the zone.<br><br>So, just remember. A Cleric can save the party in more ways than one, and those divine spells may only effect yourself when you cast them... but can be used for so much more.<br><br>Balamur Stoutfaith<br>38th Circle Cleric<br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>VERY well said.  You have hit my playing style to the letter.  I understand about the agro factor and how many clerics complain about getting stomped on by a mob.  Well I for one don't mind agro'ing a mob if another caster (enchanter preferred) can mez or stun it away from the tank(s).  This takes some of the damage off the tank and allows you to save the mana if you're low.  <br><br>Clerics are designed to be semi-tanks so we can and usually do take a licking and keep on ticking.  &lt;g&gt;  I've been with several parties that don't understand that I CAN take a beating and still cast heals when needed.  I'm usually the reason the enchanter can mez a mob as I will stand my ground and let it beat away at me.  Most warriors will attempt to engage the mob but this ruins the mez effect because most are so used to swinging and not thinking there are others in the party with significant skills to offer during combat.<br>Lastly, we clerics still have the proverbial "ace in the hole" called Divine Aura.  If things get really stupid, it's less than a second to cast and you can haul butt or wait and most mobs will leave you be once they see they cannot hurt you anymore.  I know this spell well as it has saved my butt more times than I care to count.  <br>So I echo your sentiments about clerics and if played right, a cleric is one of the most enjoyable characters to play in this game.<br><br>Cya on Erollisi Marr,<br>GreyWolffe SilverStarr<br>25th Season Cleric<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>In my mind, there are 3 ideals for group selection which makes our job as clerics far, far easier. In order of preference these are: First, an enchanter. Crowd control, besides making fights vastly easier, safer, and more efficient also lets us play with a certainty and precision that we couldn't otherwise. If 4 things are dazzled, they won't be coming up earlier than 2 minutes from the dazzle... the exact nature of mes duration gives us a lot of room to operate. We know that we can start complete healing when the tank is at a half bubble, because there is no chance of something whapping us and interrupting a critical spell, and so on. You can come close to this without an enchanter, but in my opinion there are too many variables that can skew that. There is also slows and aug/speeds they bring to the group that further speeds up the group kill rate, but that isn't as important to us as clerics as the group as a whole (like the remaining slots of a group in a standard 6 person).<br><br>Second, a shaman. Though the slows of an enchanter are extremely helpful, the yawns of a shaman (especially turgor's) are amazing. This lightening the load off the enchanter is no small benefit as well, and I consider a shaman an asset in addition to, not a replacement for, an enchanter. Secondly, talisman and even stamina make your complete heals greatly more efficient, which can substantially speed up your kill rate even without yawns.<br><br>Thirdly, and what I consider the least important asset, but what many clerics (and I think misguidedly) consider the most important, is the quality of the tank. I feel that an ogre warrior in mostly cobalt with some indo, using a twig/jade mace and such is nice, but not a requirement. I'd much rather be in a group with a mid 40s ranger in ivy etched as the primary tank, but with a good 51st level enchanter, than I would with a solid low 50s warrior but another caster subbing for an enchanter. The swing from an enchanter, depending on what you are fighting, should never be underestimated.<br><br>All that set up said, how should you play under ideal conditions? Well, with what I consider a standard group (3 or so melee, enchanter, me, and typically a random caster... unfortunately usually not a shaman), I feel that you should put the highest symbol available on the primary tank (naltron or mazrin respectively on your level), heroism, and the highest AC buff you have (shield of words for most of us). For the secondary and so on melees, I'd go with heroism, highest ac buff (to minimize damage, is mana efficient over the duration I feel), and probably pizarn (depending on the intensity of the fighting, and how quickly we need to buff up. 3 naltrons and 3 shields itself is substantial set up time). For the enchanter, naltron/mazrin and heroism. AC buff is dicey. If you are already having mana issues from setup, then I'd have the enchanter cast his AC buff on himself and the non-tanks, follow'd by aug. Though in truly dangerous situations I'd go with the highest possible AC buff on an enchanter, in most convential grinds using the mana to do it may only result in slowing you down. For myself and other casters, heroism, nothing else. (in terms of resist spells, this all assumes we'll be fighting mostly melee. Resists as needed, of course). Unless you think that you are going to be in a dangerous enough situation that you feel the casters will die without a symbol, it just isn't worth the mana for that extra margin of safety.<br><br>After setup, complete heal should be mainline heal. Neither remedy or DL approaches its efficiency. Even on sub 50 tanks, you can frequently get 2000 points of healing or so off a CH. With a shaman, its more like 2400 or so. Post 50, it becomes even more extreme, and with clarity and slows also tremendously adding to your mana efficiency, as long as you stick to Complete Heals with full buffs up, you should be riding high on mana.<br><br>In fact, TOO high on mana often. With ideal groupping conditions, I find myself at near full mana even in large pulls (5+) when I need to spend a good deal of time keeping the enchanter alive. This in turn has the effect of letting us use our mana to further speed up the group. Starting to stagger rebuffs so there isn't a low mana rebuffing period that causes a lapse in pulling. Past that, you can even nuke at FM to speed up the kill rate a touch, or even helping the enchanter's mana on consistent large pulls by helping to put one thing down fast.<br><br>The trap to avoid is ever chain-remedying. Very few mobs even post kunark can kill a tank (even a ranger) in 10 seconds. Even if they are not slowed, as long as the target is fully buffed, you can start a CH pretty high and avoid blowing half your mana on chain-remedies or lights that will oom you. The careful thing is to make sure then that the tanks don't do a lot of switching on you, or you could start a CH on a warrior then to have the ranger immediately taunt onto himself and then _have_ to be chain-remedied after you duck-out a worthless CH.<br><br>Hope this helps,<br>Cal<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>You are right about Complete Heal being the most mana-efficient.  But I have come to hate it, even when I have a nice fat warrior with 3400 hp to use it on, and here's why:<br><br>Even with my Specialization in Alteration (heal) maxed, it takes about eight and a half seconds to cast CH.  More than once, I have begun casting, only to have things go bad.  A mob breaks mez or aggros from a side hallway and comes flying in most unexpectedly and starts beating on someone.  Usually that someone is the enchanter, who will die long before I finish the CH and recycle to get even a fast Remedy cast on him.  Or the someone is the tank; I've planned it so he gets his CH at 15 to 20% health, but his HP starts to plummet and he dies before the CH goes off.<br><br>Don't get me wrong: I still use it.  It's just that I hate it.<br><br>By the way, I have similar observations about our nuke.  It's probably mana-efficient to nuke a mob if it's pretty likely to take full damage from it.  Problem is, the nuke takes over six seconds to cast, and several more to recover from.  Meanwhile, the enchanter died. <br>&nbsp;<br>Ismena <br>60 Dragonbarbie Cleric<br>That's =Doctor= Barbie to you<br>&lt;Unity&gt; <br>Prexus</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Would like to add my favorite places to hunt (regardless of race):<br>I spent my newbie levels 1-4 in North Qeynos because of the unwise choice of Human for my cleric.  That zone is pretty good, but I think maybe Freeport ( either east or west) is better, just because the mobs are so thick, and there is neither Klicknik nor Darkpaw moseying along killing you.<br><br>I have started characters in Erudin (the forest is so sparsely populated with mobs that it took me four times as long to get out of the first three levels), Kelthin (hated it - overcamped and ill-defined newbie area), and Felwithe (good, but slow), and I strongly urge anyone to take their newbie character to West Freeport to spend your first fifteen levels there, in East Commons, and in North Ro.<br><br>Hunt in East Freeport (the bats drop wings, which you can sell to other players for a few plat per stack; the same with bone chips -- or you can make friends by giving them away) till level 3, which should take at most a couple of hours.  Then East Commons, around Inn 1.  You start with decaying skeletons, bears, beetles, and spiderlings and stay east of the hill and close to the guard at the inn until you graduate to large spiders and pumas, then skeletons and rattlesnakes close to the Ro Tunnel.  Con everything before you attack it.  After 8 or so there are scarabs and asps or, if you want to group, the orc camps.  Or you will find yourself very popular at the ruins, where there are undead, but because the spawns there can be six levels apart, it's not a very good place to hunt, in my opinion.  At 10 or so there are the derv camps in West Commons or North Ro.  They occasionally drop bronze weapons and you can have a nice bundle of loot by level 15.<br><br>If you want fast xp and almost no money, hunt the single spawn and two-spawn sirens in OOT from about 10 (need a tank at this low a level) to 16.  They hit very hard, so you should have good armor if you're going to solo them.  Do not hunt the sirens near the BB zone line, as they give bad faction.<br><br>16 to 20 I hunted Aviaks in Lake Rathetear.  It was very very good xp, when my bard partner and I could get a double spawn to ourselves, but that wasn't often.  I suspect it's less camped now than it was back then, which was in the Stone Age.  Loot is good, though nothing important drops.<br><br>Levels 18 to 23 are good at the Hermit in South Karana.  Faction hit with the Unkempt Druids.  I wouldn't advise trying to solo him at 18.<br><br>My uber-leveling friends recommend East Karana for 20 plus.  I have never been there, except to die to multiple green gorge hounds at level 30, so I couldn't say.  Just passing that along.  I spent levels 20 up to about 25 at either the hermit or under the Aviak tree.  I don't recommend the Aviak tree unless you know you can trust your puller.<br><br>My level 20 bard is hunting in Lake of Ill Omen outside the Sarnak fort.  It was great xp and I would strongly recommend it for your 20-and-up cleric.  Actually, just trot into that zone and advertise for a group; you'll be snatched up immediately by whatever group your level fits with.<br><br>I spent my late twenties in Cazic Thule, first in the courtyard and then in the Lower Throne Room.  They were hard and I died a lot.  On occasion, though, I went with my friends to the Green or Blue Pools.  Chengtao always pulled and it was very enjoyable, xp was good, loot wasn't.<br><br>30 to 34 I killed Dwarves on the Sister Isle.  Easy xp and fair cash loot and I really really wish I hadn't done it because the citizens of Kaladim hate me now, although for some reason I'm amiable to the guards and merchants.<br><br>I didn't discover the Upper Throne Room in Cazic Thule till I was 33.  The xp ran out on me after 34 or 35, I forget which.  With a good puller it's good xp, few trains, no deaths.  (That's what makes an area good for me *smirk*)  I wish I had gone there at about 28, instead of the Dwarves.  :-(<br><br>I spent a lot of time between 30 and 36 at the large temple in Cazic Thule.  Loot is good, but I died a little more than I would have liked.  Lizards seem to loathe clerics.<br><br>From level 36 to 51 I made about a level a day (exclusive of hell levels) in SolB.  Loot is great and xp is obviously awesome.  Start in the pool room, graduate to the king/priest room, then bugs and bats, then stone spider.  I'm told you can get to 60 in the stone spider room.  I wouldn't know because I'm hunting now in Karnor and Sebilis, both awful places but I like 'em.  :)<br><br>I went briefly (at about 49) with a group of 6 to hunt wurms in Burning Woods.  The xp stank.  At 53 and in a group of only 2 we hunted undead gorillas and wurms in Burning Woods and the XP was very good.  Go figure.<br><br>Welp, that's my 2 cp worth.  Hope to hear more from other clerics here.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ismena <br>60 Dragonbarbie Cleric<br>That's =Doctor= Barbie to you<br>&lt;Unity&gt; <br>Prexus</td></tr>

Also pump all points into wisdom and the rest into STR or AGI.  Careful when you heal cause sometimes when the player is real low on hp and youheal  the mob sometimes attacks you.  Also if you can heal for lets say 25hp and someone is 5hp down in health do NOT heal him yet cause if you keep wasting mana healing  that 5hp then you wont  have enough to heal when you need it most also it wastes mana if you heal their missing 5hp with a 25hp heal.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>What has been said in all the posts below is true.  Clerics are healers 1st and formost.  Many a time I've helped save people because they got into a fight and then suddenly were outgunned when 2 or 3 other things joined in.  I've helped save people that I've come across and usually they are thankful.  Even if you don't get xp you do get practice in your skills, such as alteration and the like.  The better you get at casting the less often you'll be interupted while casting and the more powerful they will get.<br><br>Yes you can go on the offensive but after a time why?  You get xp in a group weither you kill or not.  You'll live longer when you heal the group since you can do it faster for them than them waiting for it to come back. I'm only lv 2 so I really can't say what to do in the higher lvs but when I do know, I'll be back to post.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Darien Targent<br>Cleric of the Light</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>If you are deciding whether to play a cleric, you need to understand your role in EQ.  You will never be able to deal mass damage (although at 29 and 44+ you can do some DD, this is not the meat of your class).  You will never do damage in combat (if you melee with the best weapons available, you will never any appreciable damage to any mob that gives experience beyond 20th level).<br><br>What you can do as a cleric is control every fight you are in.  Clerics make the best group leaders in the game.  This is principally because they spend there EQ life medding, looking at health bars and following the flow of the combat.  Clerics also get good crowd control.  You have decent armor so you can take damage when needed (and lots of times when you would rather not).  You also have Divine Auroura - one of the best "get out of jail free" cards in the game.<br><br>Generally, your primary job will be to buff and to heal.  I always ask everyone in the group their hp after buffing - this allows me to know how many hp they have in each bar and what healing spells to have ready.<br><br>You should also be ready to Park mobs on bad pulls.  You do this by getting a mob on you away from the group (superior heal achieves this task very well).  You then cast stun to give yourself a few seconds to cast and cast root on the mob.  You then go back to the fight.  If root breaks, repeat - stun and root are very inexpensive spells and you will be able to control the extra mob until the group is ready to deal with it.  <br><br>You also have several different stun spells available to you.  Don't look at each new stun as an upgrade, but more as an additional opportunity to stop mobs from casting.  I frequently have 3 stuns ready if I think we will face casters.  Nothing speeds a fight like Stun, Stun, Stun, repeat.  Casting mobs frequently have fewer hp so one or two rounds of stuns (very mana efficient) will usually be enough for an entire fight.  <br><br>You also have 2 lines of fear spells - targetable and AoE.  Fear is wonderful if grouped with any class that can snare.  This allows fear kiting and is one of the most efficient ways to kill difficult mobs.  Just have the mob snared and cast fear - instant back shots for everyone.  It also helps in areas where mobs don't assist (not many places, but it can still help).  When facing multiple mobs, fear one that will not bring friends and he will run at top speed away.  Time the fear - when it breaks, you have about that much time before the mob will return so you know when to look for him.  Wave of fear is the Evac spell for clerics.  If you have an evacer, you wave of fear and give them time to cast.  If you don't have an evacer, you give everyone a few seconds in which to run for zone.  Stay behind and use divine aura so you are invulnerable and the mobs should all agro you initially buying your team a few more seconds - then turn tail and run for zone (or gate if you can get it off).<br><br>Clerics are difficult to play well, and often boring as well in that all you seem to do is stand - heal - sit.  But if the above sounds like your style of play - if you never want to be the damage dealer but like to be the target of all the mob attention, maybe a cleric is the class for you.<br><br>Baguette Ovenfresh<br>Cleric of the 45th Season<br>Quellious<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Excellent advice Baguette -even if your name is a bit silly =).  The AE Fear spell is probably the most underused assets a cleric has.  If you are in a situation where you know there is a good possibility of needing an evac a smart cleric will have this one memmed.  Believe me, the group will be giving you big pats on the back (and hopefully beer) when you use this to buy your druid or wizard enough time to save everyone's life.  Just remember, that your AE Fear spell has a pretty small radius so be sure to do one of the following: Get close to your evac'er if he's getting hit or wade into the center of the melee to be sure the mobs will be feared.  Ideally in this situation you'll be sitting next to the druid anyhow, keeping prepared for this possibility.<br><br>-Rook Sledgefist<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I agree, the AE Fear spell would be useful in this situation. And in all honesty I hadn't considered that.<br><br>I'm more familiar with Stunning and taunt pulling to allow time for evac. My normal routine is to stun the 1 annoying fast hitter that's on the evac caster (it never fails that there's one mob like this) and then to cast an AE Heal from the center of the party. And you thought Superior Healing was a taunt? Give THAT bad boy a try, everything comes running.<br><br>It's a good way to get yourself killed though, so you have to time it right, know how long the evac cast takes, etc. Otherwise you end up with every mob nearby pounding on you, and you cannot divine or the evac won't work on you.<br><br>I'll have to give wave of fear a try, I've never used it (for what it's worth, I jokingly refer to the Fear line of spells, such as Invoke Fear... as "Invoke Train").<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>First thing when starting a cleric is the race. The best two are the dwarf and the high elf for several reasons. The dwarf offers the best physical stats and good WIS, the high elf the best psychic stats at expense of STR. The other advantages are: both can wear small armor, and both are not KoS to many people, and they have infravision.<br>Second thing, mostly if you have been playing before, is to get a friend, who is a fighter type. With one constant partner you can not only level fast and go, where you cant go alone, you are also able to play fairly regularly and have soemone you can trust. After level 30 (in my experience), has the time come to join larger groups, but then you have the power to get around without being killed, can do a lot of things, and want to socialize and explore anyway.<br>It took me 5 hours for a level from 25 to 29, so you can get to a medium level fairly quickly with a partner. This is a good thing, if you cant play like a student, but as a worker bee like me, which amounts to 15 hours per week.<br><br>Clerics are able to do a lot of things with their spells, which is better learned with only one partner, when you have to do them. In a larger group your role as the healer is practically a given, so you will never use certain tactics, or be allowed to pull off a stunt (which is part of the fun, if you ask me). Examples, what you can do include camp-breaking, crowd control and melee (up to about 25th level). Many have forgotten, that you dont have to have the best spell to do a thing, and that there are alternative ways how to go about a problem, even if they are not as "clean" as you are used to...<br><br>Good zones for level 1 to 10 are Greater Faydark, Butcherblock and Misty Thicket (I got to 7th in BB, and moved then to Misty until 9th). From 11 to 20 there are the Karanas, the Oasis and Highpass Hold (I was from 9th to 14th in WK, then moved to Oasis till 20th). From 21 to 30 there is SK, Lake of Ill Omen, Rathe Mountains and Najena (I was till 24th mainly in SK with a few forays here and there, then switched to the Lake until 29th). After that you can go to many places, including all medium level dungeons (I went to the Frontier Mountains, did corrupt guards, raided Sol A and Lower Guk til 40th).<br><br>The best weapon to train is probably 1h blunt and forget 2h, since you will soon carry some WIS or mana item in one hand. The best armor is plate (not possible to get for real beginners), but the quest armor can be gotten from 20 on (this is mostly a cash problem). Later on (after 30), you can sacrifice AC for mana, but before that I would suggest to go with as high AC as possible, so you can double up as a fighter, if needs be.<br><br>And here is a last suggestion for you: when you get into a dungeon group, it is a very good thing to have a second cleric on the team (you will see why, once you have the opportunity :) ).<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Levels 1-20 are probably some of the easiest and also some of the worst levels that you will experience as a Dark Elven Cleric. Through changes in the game and your time available for playing, your Cleric will have to use differnet tactics.<br><br>The first thing I would tell you to do once you reach level 5 is get out of Nektulos forest immediately. Anyone playing a Dark Elf cleric will know why as you are going to extremely broke and lacking in items such as armor and your full array of spells. Many people will tell you different things and different places to go, but I will tell you what worked best for me.<br><br>Go to Innothule Swamp. You can usually find a bind in the Troll City of Grobb. From there, familiarize yourself with the layout between Guk and Grobb as you will probably spend quite a bit of time running into both. The main reason that I tell you to make the long dangerous journey to Innothule is this. Frogloks have lots of money, weapons and items. Let me explain.<br><br>Each Froglok that you kill can have copper, silver, netted armor, containers. This is perfect. Netted armor is not great for you as a cleric, but is better than nothing. Do not spend any money on bags or boxes and the Frogloks will drop them. The only problem with fighting Frogloks is that they will group against you and help each other out. so be careful when you engage them. If you run into trouble, run into Guk or near the nearest guard. You will get good XP at level 5 and can easily get to level 7-8 there with no problems at all. When you finally leave the swamp, you will have a nice little nest egg for your spells or other items you may wish to purchase. Excellent for the level you are at (and beats the hell out of fighting spiders and bears in Nektulos).<br><br>Getting to level 9 can be a little difficult on your own. Froglok experience will be slim at this point, so it is time to leave the swamp and head up to The Southern Desert of Ro. You can get excellent XP here but the risk is greater. Stay in the grassy area and out of the desert area for the early levels. Darkweed Snakes and Orcs will be your target at this point. Both are tough. The Snakes will poison you (but you are a cleric so you should be all set) and the orcs hit pretty hard (keep Divine Aura ready for bad situations). Once you hit level 9, it is time to go get your spells and train your Meditate skill if you have not done so already.<br><br>Once you have level 9 then your career as Death Bringer Begins. Now you need to start tracking down some undead to kill, notably Shrivelled Mummies. Back before the Nerf, a Cleric could Root and Nuke undead quickly and easily. Now you really have little chance of Root sticking for more than a single blast so we will use the Fear Kiting way. Keep Soothe, Ward Undead and Spook the Dead ready at all times and make sure that you have buffed yourself. Also keep Stun, Furor, DA, Root and a heal spell ready for non-undead creatures that want to interfere.<br><br>Early on I would avoid tangling with Sand Mummies, Crypt Mummies, Ghouls and run away from Bry Bone Skelletons. As you go from level 9 to 14 you will find that you can take on these other undead (with the exception of Dry Bone Skellys) and make excellent experience and some nice cash. Each of these creatures can drop Bronze weapons, Gold, Silver and Copper. Fear kiting can work well, but it is also dangerous. If a mob gets close to another mob, root him. do not let them get close enough that both will attack you. If you find yourself in a tough spot, cast divine aura and run yourself to the zone.<br><br>Using Soothe, Stun and Furor you can take Orc camps by yourself. Soothe will lower aggro long enough for you to pull out single orcs at a time. The are 4 orc camps near each other in South Ro and they, like the zone, are hardly ever camped. Soothe can fail and you will find yourself with some unfriendly orcs chasing you to the zone, but trial and error will give you a good feel for your spells and valuable usage for later in your career.<br><br>XP really will not slow down for you until you get to around 15th level. At 15th level some undead stop giving experience and Dry Bones are few and far between. By now you have tried the Derv camps and feel that it is time for a change of scenery. I agree. Time to move out to our next spot. A warning of South Ro. There is a Sand Giant/Terrorantula/ Ancient Cyclops spawn. This is usually camped, but keep your eyes and ears open for them. If you find yourself in trouble, run to the zone, but also tell others what is attacking you. Often times high level people or groups will help you out and kill the creature.<br><br>At level 15 it seems like 90% of the people will tell you to "kill crocs in oasis". This is a good way to get Experience and go broke at the same time. Crocs drop poor loot (remember nektulos? that was good compared to crocs). That and the zone will be crowded with "croc hunters". If you want to do it, go ahead. I would not. Norrath is a big place. Find a place more suited to your needs. Like Lake Rathe.<br><br>Lake Rathe undead camp next to South Karana zone. At night the ruins spawn maybe a dozen slightly spaced undead. These same undead are higher level versions of the ones you have been fighting. Skelletons can give XP again. Dry Bones will kick your Butt again. Greater Zombies will be nasty. But guess what? You have Expulse Undead and really want to try it out. You can usually find a group here to join or you can try your hand at Root and Shoot. Loot can be up to gold in cash and sometimes a piece of bronze armor. You are close to South Karana zone when you need to run and you can bind yourself anywhere so your days of long walks are over when you get stomped.<br><br>During the daytime Gnolls spawn. You can get your first magic item from them. while not powerful, there is a great satisfaction at earning your own stuff. Skull of Jhen Tra and Runed Totem Staff both drop here. There are also Aviak camps in the zone and you can usually join a group in them. Watch out for deep water goblins and sharks in the water (you should have a decent swimming skill from your time in Innothule). You can do well in this zone from 15 to about 18.<br><br>Note. There are dungeons that you can go to as well to get good XP and an occasional magic item. Befallen in West Commonlands. Najena in Lavastorm. Lavastorm itself can be lucritive at this level as well. Beholder Maze is a good place for XP but some of the monsters hit alot harder than you would think. dungeons are not good places for clerics to solo at this point as if you cast fear on something in a dungeon, you had better be prepared for a train to come back at you (alot of monsters). While I would not say against going into these places, if you want to get the best benefit of seeing the world and moving forward and making friends I suggest moving around from place to place and learning the different tactics and styles of play.<br><br>at level 18 I would suggest hunting in one of the Karana Zones. South Karana has an aviak population that you can start on the weaker onces. This can be a pain as ALOT of people usually go there. I would suggest spending little time here and moving towards North Karana. In North Karana you can find a variety of bugs and lions and stuff for you to kill. some of it will be too easy, some will be too hard. East Karana is similar as well. But the sheer variety of things to fight and kill and the different place to go make these places nice hunting grounds. The problem at this point is that you are very far away from a friendly city or bank. This can be solved fairly easily for though. High Hold Pass. Inside High Hold Pass on the west side you will find several spawn points for Gnolls. The Gnolls are fairly uncamped and offer ok XP for the level. The important thing here is that they will change your faction with High Hold and it is possible to get you faction up enough to bank and walk safely through the zone. The orcs on the eastern side will do this as well. It really pays to be in a group at this point as you will find your group killing faster and thus you will get faction quicker.. High Hold is the norther route across the continent.<br><br>I realize that this little guide is not exactly full of tactics but I wanted to put some ideas down. Many people find it hard to find good places. For me, the best part of Everquest was exploring. Learning these zones and learning your spells will make you much more valuable in the future and its a great way to meet a variety of people and make friends. I left alot out in the way of specifics, but feel free to ask questions or anything. I did not mention quests as I do not want to spoil more than I have. <br><br>I will post my Dark Elven Cleric 21-45 guide soon and maybe more specific strategy information after I have verified a few things that have been nerfed (Ruror's faction anyone?). anyways. I hope this helps someone that is new and ready to explore and experience these places for the first time, or an old hand that never played a dark elf before and cannot believe how much nektulos sucks.<br><br>Vilaraa<br>&nbsp;<br>Vilaraa Innoruuk<br>45th Cycle of Pain and Devotion<br>Priestess of Pain<br>Wrath of Innoruuk</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Offering an alternative view, I can say the the lower levels in Nektulous haven't been quite so bad for me, or some other young clerics on my server (Cazic-Thule).  The key has been choosing our opponents.  Rather than dashing off to Innothule, we stayed in Nek, and concentrated our Hate on skeletons, and Black Bears.  Stacks of bone chips (laughably easy to aquire for low level clerics) are sought by the profusion of necromancers (twinked or not) for 3-5 platinum per stack.  If Innoruuk favors you enough to have a High Quality Bear Skin come to you from a Black Bear, there is another 30plat from Master level tailors seeking to make Backpacks.<br><br>Additionally, now that we can quest in the toeling (halfling *wink*) camp in Nek for our Holy Symbol of Innoruuk, I recommend getting that before heading out.  The mana-free weakness spell it casts is PERFECT for pulling solo blues, because you're not burning mana on Furor.  The additional +1 WIS is certainly useful as well.  Myself and one other level 9 cleric (many thanks, Kurgn) were able to take toelings from the small camp easily as long as we avoided the roaming Leatherfoot Deputy.<br><br>I just purchased my level 9 spells (the worthwhile ones anyway), and still have over 10 platinum in the bank for future purchases (Did I mention having amiable merchants one zone away is also a plus? *grins*).  While it has become time for me to take myself out into a wider world, my experience to 9 in Nektulous has been a good one.  So consider hunting in our own backyard.  It might surprise you.<br><br>Avallach (9th level Priest of Innoruuk) Cazic-Thule<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
