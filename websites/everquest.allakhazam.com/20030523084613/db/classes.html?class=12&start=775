Balanced for soloing yet a very powerful add on for groups.  A caster and a tank in 1, a mage with his trusty pet can tip the balance in most battles.<br><br>Starting as a high elf, my first 5 levels were spent leveling of bats/wolves/orcs in Gfaydark and as I hit lvl 8 I ventured into crushbone until 10.<br><br>From 11-12 i killed some mermaids in OOT, they were pretty easy (lvl 12 or so) but they always spawn/train in two's so a partner is good to have.<br><br>From 12-14 I leveled quickly killing dervs in No Ro with an experienced group.<br><br>Level 15-17 kept me in Oasis fighting those crocs, dry bones, and occasional ghouls.<br><br>Level 17 is where being a mage really kicked in as my lvl 16  Fire dd really started packing a punch with no fizzle problems.  I went to OOT and started killing gargoyles which are lvl 18-20 but can be leveled of easily until lvl 23.  Each gargoyle gave 1/3 a bulb of exp from 16-19 and then only the lvl 20's gave that.  These gargoyles were extremely easy to solo with an earth pet and my 16 Fire DD, and they dropped rare eyes which I sold for 8pp on sister isle.<br>Becareful, they do train and 4 specs are on top of the island.  Gargoyle eye needed for shovel of ponz quest.<br><br>Level 20-22 I moved to the goblin isle where headhunter goblins ranged from 20-23 and racked in even more exp solo and some with a group.  Also did some griffawns in NK.<br><br>Level 22-23 brought me to south karana where I gained easy levels of non KoS aviak rooks and darters.  Also centaurs were great exp.<br><br>Level 23-24 I got easy experiene soloing great skeletons in rathe mts which were lvl 22-27 with an earth pet.<br><br>Level 24-27 kept me bouncing from Aviak harriers to split paw gnolls in south karana, and back to rathe mts.  Also did some griffennes in NK.<br><br>Level 28-29 I spent in High Keep getting easy exp in a warrior or goblin raider group which go from lvl 30-34 usually and can level you to 35 at least.<br><br>Level 29-31 spent soloing aviak avocets which ranged from 29-32.  Not to hard to kill with earth pet and shock of spikes but get sow for safety and memorize the way to the lake rathe zone.<br><br>Level 31-34 back to high keep into warrior or raider group where I got my gloves of rallos zek for the earth pet research. (South Karana and North karana drop a lot of mage research items for lvl 16-29 so does OOT.)<br><br>Level 34-39 is when i got all my focus items from Temple of Ro and got my new 270 dd and 320 bolt or so.  Went to Frontier Mountains in Kunark to solo Mountain Giants and sometimes got into a group.  MG's are great experience upto level 43 in that zone since there are 4 different types of mg's ranging from lvl 32 to 37.  They drop rare loot (forest loop around 1kpp maybe less now, and a lot of 40-50pp weapons/tunics that can be sold to vendors.)  Also sarnak knights run around, brutes, burynais, and goblins.  All give great exp.<br><br>Level 39-41 I went to overthere and soloed for quick experience, (thorny succulents, tigresses, cockatrices, rhinos, sarnaks.)<br>Watch out for tigers, they are very mean and its a close battle when soloing them.  Tiger do give the best experience in that zone for level 39-41 since tigers are lvl 37-39.<br><br>Level 41-43 spent in frontier mts (near burning woods zone) soloing MG braes, craigs, Ravenous brutes, goblins, and burynai.  Burynai cenobytes are nasty, superior healing clerics which wont stop healing themselves when less than 1/2 hp.<br><br>Level 43-44 gained in overthere with ease.<br><br>Level 44-46 gained in oasis hunting specs and sg's.  Very fun, not too hard with an earth pet and the 580 dd shock of swords.  I make 200plat every few hours and those sg's are rich!!!<br><br><br>There are other plenty of places that I might not have mentioned or have not visited but these are the ones I liked and remember the most.<br><br>Some not mentioned are:<br><br>sol a (goblins)<br>The rest of karanas (griffs/named cyclops)<br>inside split paw (gnolls)<br>inside everfrost (hunting orcs and mammoths) inside perma<br>WC (hunting druids)<br>RV (hunting some guards)<br>kaladim (hunting dock dwarves)<br>OOT (hunting sea furies).<br><br>----------------------------------------------<br>Research info<br>----------------------------------------------<br>Most components are found of mobs 5 levels higher than the spell you're trying to research.<br><br>Level 16-29 words stuff can easily be found in OOT, NKar, SKar, High Keep.<br><br>Level 29-39 words and stuff can be found in higher level zones and dungeons like upper/lower Guk or Sol a/b.  Usually zones with lvl 30-40 mobs will have them.<br><br>Level 39-44 words components can be foudn in lvl 40+ zones like dreadlands and burningwoods in Kunark.  Skyfire and some dungeons also.  <br><br>49+ components are usually in the planes.<br><br>Level 50+ spells drop in a lot of kunark lvl 45+ zones.<br><br>Most lvl 16-39 components can be bought for 1-3pp each from vendors and other pc's using the /auction command.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>Extra mage info<br>------------------------------------<br>A mage is a very balanced class; we can summon all the gear we need for battle and we usually enter battle with 6-7 bulbs of mana because of banked mana (summoned gear.)  A pet is 50% of your power, always have one out.<br><br>Soloing is the best way to get exp, but grouping doesnt hurt if hunting hard stuff.<br><br>Always give your pet sword of runes (those 40 procs that *still proc vs non summoned* that verant claimed to have patched help a lot).<br><br>Cold stones rock and so do dimensional holes/pockets to carry summoned gear or heavy stuff.<br><br>I carry 2 large sewing kits, 8 holes, can carry large items like scythes which bagpacks can't, and weight almost nothing.  I always right click to close/open them so I dont have the combine problem of losing everything inside them.<br><br>I also carry 2 large bags and I summon 2 dimensionals for very game.<br><br>Since a mages strength is very low you have to be able to compromise with your strength and carrying 3 weight bags is annoying.<br><br>I wear 4int/2str earrings and 7int/7str necklace to help with my str.  I dont bother getting 5 int earrings to lose the 2 str.  The 1 int tradoffs aren't worth the carrying ability.<br><br>Fire shield really helps lvl 34+ in the solo stage as your pet can last longer and vs more mobs.<br><br>Pets spells 39+, no longer need the heal summoned spell because they have regen.  And if your pet dies its a bad situation.<br><br>That resummon a new pet strat doesnt work too well.<br><br>Since mobs at lvl 39+ can kill your pet pretty fast and run fast, its pointless to try resummoning, its either you Win or you Run.<br><br>Get Jboots, they are a life saver.  Not as fast as sow, but faster than most mobs and easy to use.  Very easy to kite with jboots and the Win or Run strategy works great.<br><br>I carry usually 2-3 focus with me since I almost never use fire pet.<br><br>Earth pets rock solo wise or for root purposes<br>but hard to summon the highest lvl possible.<br><br>Water pets rock for kiting because easier to summon a higher lvl water pet that does more dmg and its ice DD rocks in taking down the hp of a running mob.  It also taunts pretty well if it gets a few hits off.<br><br>Air pets are easy to get high lvl with focus item,<br>fast agility, fast attacks, stun for caster type mobs, but not as usefull in most of my adventures.<br>In dungeons if they get lost, you will die anyways because no pet protection :)<br><br>Also The greatest trick for kiting, is run exactly through a mob and past your pet, its almost a gurantee that the pet will taunt the mob off you.  Try it twice and it should work with no doubt (strat borrowed from punkrop lvl 50+ mage on fennin ro).<br>------------------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;<br>Eendyar Soulseeker<br>46'th High Elf Mage <br>"Mythic Synergy"<br><a href="http://www.mythicsynergy.com" target=_new>http://www.mythicsynergy.com</a><br>Fennin Ro</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>------------------------------------<br>Pet Commands / Hot key's<br>------------------------------------<br><br>There are 5 main commands that are very important to a magician.<br><br>/pet attack - makes pet attack mob<br>/pet follow me - makes the pet follow the mage<br>/pet guard here - makes the pet guard the spot<br>/pet back off - pet backs off a mob<br>/pet health report - reports pet's health<br>(/pet report health - also works).<br><br>(Also /pet taunt will turn the pet's taunt on/off.<br>Very usefull when grouped and you dont want the pet taking all the damage from a mob.)<br><br>I usually have my hotkey's set up to handle spells and pets.<br><br>1) Best DD<br>2) Backup DD<br>3) Malise type spell.<br>4) Fire shield spell<br>5) /pet follow me<br>6) /pet attack<br><br>The reason for the pet commands is I always type in manually when i want my pet to guard or when I want its hp report.&nbsp;&nbsp;I almost never use /pet back off at lvl 39+ because every mob triple hits and that makes it impossible to get that pet off.<br><br>If a mob hits your pet, that pet will keep fighting the mob. <br><br>The dd's are hotkeyed for quick access, fire shield for quick access, and malise for de-resist quick access.<br><br>------------------------------------<br>Pet Strategy and Use<br>------------------------------------<br><br>When soloing, it is always a good idea to make the pet guard and pull a mob to your pet.  However if that is not possible then the pet should always follow close behind.  Keep an eye on your pet so its not jumped or aggroed.<br><br>The perks of /pet guard here is the pet will stay there until something hits it or you issue another command.<br><br>-Whenever your pet kills something, it goes back to the guard spot.<br>-Whenever your pet is guarding, it heals faster.<br><br>I usually press f1 to toggle between me and pet.  First time its me, second time its pet and so on.<br>Before pulling I make sure pet has burnout (every 15 min) and then I fire shield it.<br>I pull a mob to my pet, and tell the pet to attack.<br><br>Most of the battle is hotkey/keyboard base.<br><br>------------------------------------<br>When to use what pet<br>------------------------------------<br><br>EARTH - Number one pet for soloing.  Great hp and the power to root your mob.  With a rooter you can unleash your dd fury without much fear of death.  A malise spell helps before nuking so that the pet's (procs/effects) stick to the mob effectively.  This is the only way mages get a root type spell so this pet is a must for every magicians book.  Low agility keeps this pet from lasting too long vs many mobs as it takes almost every hit and usually full dmg.  25-50% chance of summoning the highest level pet with focus item.<br><br>WATER - Well balanced pet.  Second in hp to earth but has higher ac and agility to my knowledge.  Its ice proc DD is powerfull and is cast pretty often.  I think it casts more often if the mage is hit.  Great pet to kite with if you have sow or jboots.  Nice dmg dealer in a group if you need good hp and good firepower. 50-75% chance of summoning the highest level pet with focus item.<br><br>AIR - Third on the hp chain, the air pet with its highest agility does the fastest attacks and evades the most hits.  With its ability to stun its a wonderful pet vs mobs that do a lot of attacks or especially caster mobs.  Its ability to self invis gives you a stealthy ability in dungeons, duels, and pvp.  50-60% chance of summoning the highest level pet with focus item.  This pet is not bad for kiting and will mow down enemies very fast in a group.<br><br>FIRE - The lowest hp pet with a self fire shield and a strong fire DD.  Doing twice the dmg of water's DD and its hella strong fireshield, usually the dmg of the pets level.  Very usefull to clear low trash or in a group that needs an ultra fast way to kill a mob.  It makes an average kite pet but should be used by a master because bad kiting can kill this pet fast.  50% chance of summoning the highest level pet with focus item or so.  Never used fire pets that much.<br>------------------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Very often, one of the main requirements of a mage is to get the mob to stay on your pet while you are blasting it.<br><br>As you all know, this can be rather troublesome. Very often, after one or two blasts, the mob starts hitting you. Which can often result in you running around until it hits your pet.<br><br>Here are my humble observations :-<br><br>Generally, mobs will not switch to you when you initially blast them. Or in other words, blast number one does not pull it off the pet but blast number two will.<br><br>However, once your pet is down to about 50% hit points, then all your blasting will not pull it off the pet.<br><br>So the main tactic is to blast it once, let the pet fight for a while. Wait till the pet is at 50% HP. Then start hosing the mob down.<br><br>You might want to put a few pet healing spells between your blasts. Just to keep your pet alive.<br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>There are obviously many philosophies on which pet to use, and everyone seems to be saying something different!&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is that?  There are just far too many factors to boil down pet selection to just saying one or the other is better.  This is a short list of reasons I choose a particular pet, sorted by pet type.<br><br>Earth: Definitely one of the favorites, especially with the powerleveler crowd.  This is because the earth pet's high HP allows it to stand against yellows and reds longer.  Given the level difference when fighting yellows and reds, even your air pet will be taking hits much as you do when meleeing higher level creatures.  This is a situation where using a damage shield is very important, since your DD has a higher chance of being resisted by your yellow/red target.<br><br>Water: Another one of the favorites, it replaces the earth pet's root with a damage spell.  The real utility of the water pet lies in its immunity to poison, and the water pet should be used in any encounter with mobs that cast poison.  Less HP and no root means you'll need to be on your toes a bit more and flee early, but with proper judgement you have a very useful tool for killing snakes and spiders.  As usual, damage shields are a good thing to use.<br><br>Fire: Sometimes you just can't get someplace with yellow/red mobs and are forced to hunt evens and blues with the common folk.  This is the place I prefer to use the fire pet.  In the situation where your pet is within one level of the mob, the extra damage of a fire pet outweighs the extra absorption an earth pet has because it allows me to drop the mobs more quickly and get on with my hunting.  An even mob will give less XP per kill so I make up for that lack by killing in volume, and the fire pet helps me do that.<br><br>Air: My success with air has rested solely on its ability to turn invisible, however in a group situation the stun effect can be a real tank-pleaser.  Stunning the mob(s) will only decrease your tank's downtime (even if YOU are the tank) by reducing the damage output of the mob.  Another crowd-pleasing effect is that in weirdly-pathed zones where your pet goes nuts (Crushbone, for example) the invisibility factor allows a more relaxed atmosphere during downtime... unless of course you're in an area where the mobs can see invis.<br><br>I suppose to sum up, I use fire and earth depending on my prey's level.  Against poison I use water, and I hardly ever use air.  Your mileage may vary.<br>&nbsp;<br>www.yegolev.com<br>Ibaler the Valewalker<br>Gaheris</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I agree with you about the use of fire pets to kill a lot of blue cons. However that only works at low and middle levels. Once you get to higher levels blues will be all that you will be able to kill(well whites too). I totally disagree with you about your statement on air pets. You oviosly aren't a higher level magician becuase you talk about kill yellows and reds. At higher levels you WILL NOT be able to kill a red or yellow. At your best you will be able to take whites. Although I agree that at lower levels the air pet is not as usefull as the other pets. However once you get to higher levels and pets can duel-wield, their true power comes out. <br><br>Here is what I posted earlier on another spot in this forum. Rate me good =;-) .<br><br>FIRE PET: Someone said that fire pets are the best soloing pets levels 16-24. He said you can sic your fire pet on the enemy and just stand back and heal. Well guess what, you DO NOT want to do that. Why not? Becuase then your pet will take half the exp. from the kill. If you are using a pet and it outdamages you, you only get half the exp. for the kill. If you outdamage your pet you get the full exp. for the kill. Fire pets are good for fast kills or to clear out a whole bunch of green cons. Example: my guild decides to raid Splitpaw to get some of the items dropped by the higher level gnolls. We were all levels 40+. All those tesch mass gnolls conned green, so killing them we get us No exp., yet they would assist the higher levels gnolls. I bring a fire pet out and he smashes them up very quickly. I really never use a fire pet except for that. <br><br>EARTH PET: Good pet for soloing IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS. Its not always the best choice. It has massive hp, casts root, and will make full-use of your damage shields(becuase of low agility). The problem with it? It has very low AC, so it will be taking a lot of damage per hit from the things you are fighting. IT IS NOT the pet you want for taking a quick spawning thing. It has tons of hp, but after the battle and its down to about 30% hp, it definately won't be ready for the next spawn thats up in 5 minutes. You would have to spend your mana on healing it, but then thats a waste becuase then you won't have enough mana when the spawn comes up. Also DO NOT use this pet when you are grouping and there is someone in the group with snare. The root the pet casts will remove the snare and start trains. Also DO NOT use this pet when soloing things that run away WHEN OUTDOORS. If you are soloing something that runs away when it gets down to 10% health, the earth pet will root it and it will keep fighting, and your pet will keep taking more damage or possibly die. Now if you are soloing things that run away at high-speed, thats a different story. Overall, this is an excellent pet for soloing at the low levels or when the root effect is needed. <br><br>AIR PET: This is my favorite pet. They have insane amounts of agility, dexterity, and AC, plus attack faster than all the other pets AND do a stun spell. It is VERY good for when you are fighting casting mobs and IMO the best pet for grouping. They are also the best pets for kiting. Send this pet in on your enemy and then blast them until they come after you. Then just start to run away. The pet will stun the enemy while you are running, which is a HUGE taunt. Then you just stop running, blast again, run more until pet stuns, blast more, etc. until the thing is dead. You can kite well without SOW and j-boots becuase of a pathing bug. Want to know it? While running hit the numberlock button. This will make you run continusly. Then after hitting the number lock button, hold the Crtl key and one of the left or right running buttons. The effect: you will strafe WHILE running making it so most mobs won't be able to catch up with you and giving you the speed of j-boots without having them. Pretty cool huh. Also, becuase of its massive dexterity it will become a complete destoryer when you give it a couple gnoll-hide lariats or rune swords. With its haste bonus and massive-procing it will actually do MORE damage than a fire pet when grouping(since the fire pet usually won't be getting hit, and therefore wasting its damage shield, which is the main reason it does so much damage). Overall: I love this pet. It isn't as effective until the mid levels(about 20), so at lower levels you will want to use another pet. However, once you get to higher levels and it gets a haste bonus and starts stunning more, you will love it. <br><br>WATER PET: This is the completley balanced pet. It has the 2nd best hp, agility, and AC of all the pets. Also it regens it HP faster than the other pets and is completely IMMUNE to poison. I use this pet when camping a really quick spawn, fighting things that have a NASTY poison attack, or when in a pure caster group where the pets will be tanking, and they need to regen their hp quickly. If you are a poor magician at the lower levels you can just buy only this pet and still do alright. However, once you get to higher levels you WILL need to start getting other pets(and even at lower levels other pets are better in certain situations). <br><br>Zuranthium/Corpusnuntia/Sunsong/Naltec/Divineshadow<br><br>Player of many characters on the Namless.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I wouldn't say they are the 'top' pets in the game though. Other pets are better in different places(other magician pets that is, water pets are supreme to any non-magician pet).<br><br>Now, even though just buying a water pet will save you money at lower levels, it sucks to chain-research them at higher levels. It is very costly. Think of this: to get your level 49 water pet you have to buy the level 34 water pet and use it to research the 39 water pet. Then you have to use the 39 water pet to research the 44 water pet. THEN you have to use the 44 water pet to resarch the level 49 water pet.<br><br>Since you won't suceed in researching every time you will end up having to buy the level 34 water pet about 5 times. Plus you have to track down all the words/extra component for all these pets, often buying them. In the end you have spent a lot of time and money. Its the same thing(only not as bad) if you wan't your level 29 water pet.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Soloing guide for your HElf Mage (lvls 1-28)<br> Im here to post my sistem for leveling newbye caracters starting around Faydwer. This system has been proved with a Mage, Wizzy, Druid, Cleric Warrior, and finally a Pally =P. This guide is oriented to Mages, if your another class you may need to group or solo the targets a lvl or two later.<br> First thing to do, go to your guild and deliver your newbie note, mem your first spells and go out to GFay, start hunting by your newbie zone. I usually use the place to the right of the entrance to Felwithe, its delimited by the road to Keletin and 3 hills. Very few orcs roam this place so its a great place for Lvls1-3 (you'll get killed by them almost always at this levels, so dont attack them).<br> Get to that place and start killing the bats, wasp, skellys, and if your bold the wolves. Do this and you'll get to Lvl 3 in no time ( be sure to keep all the bone chips and bat wings for selling or questing).<br> At level 3 you finally can do the Pawns with no fear so kill all of them on sight (keep the hatchets for the quest in the rangers guild).<br> At lvl 4 you get your new spells so go to the guild and buy your pet and your DD spells first. Buy some malachite and go to Butcherblock Mts (BB). Here start doing the snakes that are yellow or even con to you. You'll kick some serious a%$# here with your powerful pet and new spells, althought be sure to tank for your pet a little cause hes not to strong yet (i recommend using Water till lvl 25 or so if you are soloing).<br> At lvl 5 or 6 start doing the Bats, Goblins and Dwarf skellys that room near the 2 huts and you'll get to 7 in no time.<br> When you hit 7, go to Druid ring in BB and start camping the skellys that spawn there (its a 5 spawn camp, the last one is behind a hill). You'll stay here till lvl 9 so be sure to take a little trip to Fel to buy your rank 3 spells.<br> When you hit 9 go to LFay and do the Nybright systers, you ned a group for this till vl 12 or so, but at 12 you can start pulling only 2 and killing them solo. You'll get to 15 doing this in no time. And then is the boring Croc time in Oasis of Marr.<br> Kill the Croc acording to your level solo till lvl 18 or 19 (to level real fast kill only yellow cons).<br> So now comes the easy camping time. Everybody is busy killing the Aviaks at Rathe or SKarana, but your a Mage, and you kick butt solo, so go to EKarana and start doing Gnoll Reavers and wolves there solo, you can get great exp doing this and some nice loot too.<br> When Gnolls and wolves start to get too low level for you, you can start soloing the white or yellow con Crag spiders (be sure to use water pet), i guess that us Mages and Druids are the only ppl soloing them so you'll get plenty of targets. Camp yourself near the Barbarian Village and hunt at the mountain range (be sure to keep an eye on any HG that pops around). You'll get to Lvl 28 doing this in almost no time.<br> And here is when my Hunting guide ends, the following guide will take you till lvl 50.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

This is why we mages are the most powerfull class in norrath, there is no comparison.  Wizards? No way in hell.  Monks, roques?  Forget it.  In most cases our nuking abliities will bring is to about 75% of the ability of a wizard.  Add pet damage... a lvl 51 earth pet will quad for 56 and bash for 25, thats half of what our DD will do at lvl 52.  So... are pets pretty much rule.  People talk about this pet recast crap and all that... I have yet to find a time where we need to do such a thing.  In groups its simple, we send our pet in, stand up to nuke, sit down again, rinse and repeat.  Something you will pick up over time is which pet to use and when to nuke.  But its nothing complicated.  One reason why is sorta sucks to play a mage... theres 4 other classes with can take your place in a group( htough you do it the best ).. wizards, necros, roques, druids are all nuking/damage classes.  So.. make sure you make alot of friedns at higher levels.  Um, thats about it, we solo pretty well too, just send in earth pet, damage sheld him, nuke it till its dead.  :)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>well i must agree that mages are the best damage dealing class i have to disagree that we are the "best" class. we are better then the wizard at dealing damage, but they can make more money easier then we can and will therefore probly have much better equipment at mid levels (29).<br>In my opinion enchanters are better then mages. with clarity they reduce downtime, they can take out 3 white/yellow mobs at the same time, they make the most money with jewelcraft, they are AWESOME in a group, and can solo pretty well. also think about this situation: you are walking along in SK and three harriers start hitting you. mages: they die<br>enchanters: area effect stun, area effect mez, charm one, beat another, keep the third mezed...<br>enchanters can take care of pretty much every situation.<br>mages are great soloers and will almost NEVER be KS from. in a group we are nice to have for the damage we can do and we add another tank. Necros are welcome in a group too but everything they can add to a group somebody ese can pretty much do.<br>the pet recast strategy lets you solo things they other classes could NEVER do. this strategy lets a 34 mage solo a HG. can a druid kite one? maybe if they had clarity 2. can a necro? never get fear to stick enough to kill it. mages use their "two unresistable sources of damage" and can kill things or much higher level.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Speel Lavamaster<br>magician , monk , and warrior extrodinaire.<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hey Speel i agree with you on a few points however I DON'T like the pet re-cast strategy. Here is why: first of all since you will be casting nothing but pets and damage shields you won't outdamage your pet, and thefore only get half of the exp. for the kill. Secondly, it takes a while to down a monster using this strategy, so in the time you killed that cyclop's getting half of the exp. for the kill, you could have killed 2 cylops's, getting full exp. for each kill, so in reality BETTER EXP. <br><br>Thats also why I think necros are better soloer's than magicians. Even though they sometimes can't take things that are as big, becuase of massive spell resists, they can take many small things with almost no downtime, and make exp. faster than the magician who is using the chain-pet strategy. Plus, if things get hairy the magician has one unreliable escape route - gate. Necros have shadow step, gate, brief invulnerbilty, feign death, the darkness line, root, fear, screaming terror(a MEZMERIZE SPELL GOTTEN AT LEVEL 24).<br><br>I love magicians, but I don't like the pet-recast strategy and just becuase 'magicians can take bigger monsters than any other class' that doesn't mean it is better. Bigger isn't always better you know. Just my 2cp that I know are correct, accurate, and a good tip. =:-)<br><br>Corpusnuntia, Divineshadow, Natalos, Naltec, Plantmaster, Zuranthium<br><br>Player of many characters on the Nameless server.<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

Enchanters have their good points and mages have theirs.  Enchanters excell in multi-mob fighting.  But they really stink in soloing a single mob.  an enchanter can rock a 5 spectre spawn easy, but most of the time, they are camped by 3 other groups, so you have to solo 1 at a time.  Enchanters also can survive if they need to run, with color flux, mez and so on, although ench most times dont have gate memed, because they have too many spells.  <br>Now for mage, They can solo single things with ease, it takes them like 1/3 mana and its much safer.  Ench pets suck bad, so they mostly use charm.  And if charm wears off, bam.  Magician can also clean out a low lvl dungeon EASY if you wanna farm items.  Magicians also most of the time have gate memed, so its an easy escape spell.  I still prefer magician, because most of the time, you are fighting a single mob, instead of multi.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Comparing enchanters to mages is kind of pointless.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's like comparing a cleric to a wizard.  They serve totally different purposes.  Enchanters are great group players with their crowd control abilities and their buff/debuff abilities.  They have some DD spells, but they shouldn't be relied on to nuke if you don't have to.  <br><br>I played an enchanter to 21 and a magician to 27 (so far) and whoever said an enchanter can solo pretty easily must have never played one.  The enchanter can solo, but it's a risky proposition.  Yes, they can stun, mez, or crowd control in some way, but that does little towards taking the creature down, and with all the mana it takes to do those spells, not much is left for DD.  The worst part for me was the constant resist messages I was seeing.  It was quite frustrating.  The thing that topped it off for me was running to retrieve my corpse in SK from the aviak village, getting jumped by a lion while memorizing spells and having it resist all my level 20 enchanter spells.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I am sorry but I totally disagree with this strategy. First of all if you use this strategy you won't be outdamaging your pet and won't get full exp. for the kill. Secondly it takes a long time to kill a big MOB using this strategy. For example...take a level 38 magician. In the time they can kill a level 40 thing using this strategy, they could have killed 2 level 30 things and gotten FULL exp. for each of those kills. So you will acctually be getting MORE exp. to make sure you just outdamage your pet and kill things quick.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Nothing wrong with healing into the mid 20's to upper 20's.&nbsp;&nbsp;The key is to do it the right way.  You want to heal on a water pet. It's regen is good and its better than average agility means that it doesn't get hit every time a mob swings.  Heal when your pet is superior, so high blue pet on a low blue or green mob.  In this situation your pet takes many fewer hits so the heal will give a lot of extra rounds.  In earlier levels when you can still cast yellow and black pets this strategy works great.  Turn your pet loose sit and med.  Heal once and med.  Then you go right to the next mob.  The downside is that the pet will take more exp, so it makes sense to do this in an enviroment where there is a steady stream of Mobs.  I leveled very quickly from 12 to 24 using this when it made sense.  Earth pet and nuking is also a good way to go when you have mobs that are better than your pet or there is a thin flow of the mobs so you have lots of time to heal.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Mage of the 42nd circle.<br><br>Hail Fellows, I have travelled many leagues over this plane of earth called Norrath and have battled many wonderous creatures in obtaining the status in which I write to you this day. As a youth within my earlier levels..say 5-14 I hunted a lot in lavastorm. Good quiet hunting for a Young Tier Dal. but as I grew I began my trekking into the North and South regions of the Deserts of RO. These offered many good Dervish cuttthroat camps, They are always good for slaying, and many other things of interests. Giant Spiders, Puma's and Madmen. Also I hit a very secluded and great hunting area many do not fear to tread. Rathe Mountains. I along with a friend, an Enchanter did very very well there hunting the Orc and Lizardmen camps throughout the zone. they seems to be far enough away from any giants streching thier huge legs, so we had a field day. Now I did this from 14 - 17, after 17 I hit the Skeleton camp in the rathe mounts, excellent expeirince and the undead are always good for a chuckle or 2 :), Now after twenty I found spells to be quite expensive and I began my Mage Quests from the temple of RO, these quests give excellent xp right about 20-24 so do them then and watch the bar turn orange alot. I also&nbsp;&nbsp;began hunting in OOT at the Undead Isle. great mony and XP on the Gargs, but watch what time you go. Try the Off peak hours, as during primetime it is packed and everyone kills all the gargs they can find, thus depleting the loot of eye's which sell for quite a bit. If OOT is too packed to hunt, forget it and Hit the Gnolls in Lake rathe great faction hits in Qyenos and good items, xp isnt too bad either on the late night skels. Now after 24 I was due for an Ocean voyage and Mistmoore was my newest vacation spot. AWESOME XP around the entrance pond. just stay away from the zone line unless you can handle the constant trains as they come furious and often. Now After about 24 - 32 I had hit Mistmoore and my old haunt Rathe mounts for cyclops.<br>from 34 - on up it was Kunark and overthere, Sarnaks hate the smell of me coming from the boat now. hehe this is a basic idea of where you can get good hunting experience away from the bustling crowds. Hunt well friends and remember Mages and Pets are worth theyre weight in gold. but a follish mage is Death waiting to happen. until then Keep hunting.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Good loot and xp.  Bank right beside u.  Just make sure you don't mind being in a small room for a long long time.  Waiting to get into a group can be a pain...but hey, do what I did..become a master brewer while u wait..hehe. I grouped here too.  Also, if u wanted you can get to Level 40 here, but gawd...who would want to?<br><br>35 to 36 Sol B. Kill Kobolds.  This place is great xp and good loot.  You can stay here to at least 45-48. Not sure, my highest character is L40.  I mostly grouped...heh, I solo'd a few on occasion under the right conditions.  Waiting for a group can be a major pain.  I am considering leaving for a Kunark zone to do something new.  Maybe Dreadlands, Overthere or Frontier Mountains.  Lower Guk is also an option, but LG is better for getting GREAT loot...while SolB is better xp and basic loot (coinage etc..).  The diff between SolB and LG is probably not all that great, so whatever suits your fancy.<br><br>I did all this an 15 days played time.  Not to mention I am a master brewer, master smith and master baker.  I think that's not too bad...not the best, but definately not the worst =).<br><br>Cheers, <br><br>Beep.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have seen a few good magician guide posts, however I am gonna show you how to REALLY do good as a magician. This is VERY LONG:<br><br>First off choose your race. I suggest putting 25 points into intelligence and 5 into chrisma. Also, DON'T BE A HUMAN. Some people say humans level faster than every other race...well guess what..THEY DON'T. Plus humans start with the lowest intelligence and are blind in the night. If you are just starting your character I suggest being a Gnome or High Elf. When you start give your note to your guildmaster and get your newbie robe. Put one training point into piercing, evocation, abjuration, conjuration, and channeling. Scribe your two newbie spells minor shielding and Burst of Flame. Always keep your self buffed with minor shielding - it does make a big differnce at low levels. Use Burst of Flame to help kill your enemy while you melee it. get to level 4...no big problem. <br><br>Now the fun starts. At level 4 you get new spells and the meditation skill. Only put one point into medition. It will raise very fast. You should buy Summon food, Summon water, Flare, Summon dagger(all level 1 spells)...Summon Bandages, Burn, Gate, level 4 earth pet, level 4 water pet. At level 4 you should only buy the earth and water pets. The air and fire ones aren't very useful at these levels, however will become much more usefull at higher levels(especially the air pet!). Sense you can summon bandages it is a good idea to summon a lot of them and practice yuor bind bound skill. It will allow you to heal any player, including your self up to half health. Also at these lower levels it is a VERY good idea to give your pets rusty two-handed weapons (rusty scythes, two-handed swords, and halberds). They will make your pets do MASSIVE damage and allow you to take BIG things. Now from level 4 until 8 your fighting strategy will be simple: send your pet, nuke the MOB with your damage spell (called a DD for short, for all you newbies reading this), and go in and tank for a pet if needed. Since you started out as a gnome or high-elf like I told you to (you did didn't you, hehe), you will be able to kill kobolds to get to level 6. If you are a high elf just run to steamfont...its only a 5 minute run. If you are a gnome...well steamfont is your newbie zone so you should already be there. The kobold camp has 3 kobolds that spawn at the camp and one off the side of the camp on the mountain side. To take the 3 kobolds you will need to give your pet a rusty scythe, two-handed sword, or halberd. They aren't that hard to find. Go to greater faydark and ask around for some. Or go to Felwithe, the starting city of the high elves. You will be able to find some rusty two-handers at many vendors. Kobolds will get you to level 6. Once you get to level 6 I suggest going to Butcher Block and killing dwarven skelatons at the druid ring. They are levels 5-7 and are VERY good exp. If your pet has a two hander you will do very well. The dwarven skelatons will get you to level 8.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Some people when they first start out don't know how to control their pets. Here are all of the commands you will need to use to control your pet.<br><br>/pet attack - send your pet after whatever you want.<br>/pet back off - makes your pet back off the thing you are fighting. Has to be hit multiple times to work, and if your enemy attacks you yuor pet will go in again.<br>/pet report health - this command makes yourpet tell you how much health it has left. VERY usefull command. Use it a lot in battle. Make sure your pet doesn't die.<br>/pet gaurd here - makes your pet stay where they are and come assist you if anything attacks you. They will return to the spot they left after killing whatever attacked you.<br>/pet get lost - if you get a lower level pet and you aren't satisfied, use this command to get rid of the pet and summon a more powerful one. <br><br>Some other things about pets. Once you get to level 8 MAKE SURE that you outdamge your pet with you DD spells. If you don't outdamage your pet then your pet will get half of the exp. from whatever you killed. From level 4-7 its fine if your pet outdamages you, and since you should be giving your lower level pets rusty two-handed weapons to maked them do A LOT more damage, you probably won't be able to outdamge your pet. However once you get to level 8 make sure you take a little over half of your enemy's HP off with your own DD's so you get full exp. for the kill.<br><br>Level 8 is when magicians start to become REALLY good. At this level they get two great DD's, a damage shield, invisibility, a pet healing spell, a bunch of summoning spells, and of course your pets. The problem is that at this level spells suddenly cost a LOT for their level and you will have A LOT of spells to buy. If you have another higher level character this is no problem, but new characters will have to conserve their money. If you are low on money i suggest buying these spell first and the rest later: level 8 earth pet, Shock of Blades, Sheild of Fire, Invisibility, and Staff of Tracing. These are the only spells you will need for now. The summon staff spell can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities. Now to make a ton of money you are going to hunt wisps. Wisps can only be hit by magician means( ie spells or a magical weapon), so it is very important to buy your level 8 summon staff spell, becuase it will make your pets able to hit the wisps. <br><br>The best place to hunt wisps is on the wisp island located between Odus and Qeynos. To get to it, ride the boat from qeynos to Odus and get off at the island the boat stops at in the middle of the ride. Be sure you brought a lot of backpacks/small containers. The strategy to kill these things will be: summon and earth pet and give it a staff you summoned. Then buff the earth pet with your fire damage shield. Then send it in on the wisp and stand back and keep burning the wisp until it is dead.  Tank for your pet and cast your shock of swords spell inbetween the attacks of the wisp if needed. Make sure the wisp you attack is along and there are no other ones near. Wisps WILL assist each other and at this level 2 wisps means death. Also, you will want to use your level 1 "summon dagger" spell against the wisps becuase it will summon a magical weapon, and if you are just starting out and don't have a higher level character, you probably won't have access to a magical weapon. Now when you loot the wisps destroy the burnt out lightstone and regular lightstone they drop. However save the Greater Light Stones. You will get one greater lightstone for about every 5 wisps you kill. When all of your backpacks and containers are totally full with Greater light stones, take them to the gypsy camp and give them to one of the ladys(I forget which lady it is exactly...just ask someone). For every greater light stone you give her you will get a good deal of exp. for this level and about 9pp. Very soon you will have enough money to buy the rest of your spells. Here are all the other level 8 spells you will want to buy:<br><br>Renew Elements - this spell will heal your pets. It is good spell during downtime if they aren't fully healed by the time your mana is full. YOu won't need it with your level 8 pets, but your level 12 pets that have more hp and regen slower(becuase of your pet buff burnout) might need to be healed sometimes. This spell is based off your Alteration magic group. This is the first alteration spell you will get. It will fizzle a lot, so practice it up.<br><br>Dimensional Pocket - this spell summons a 4-slot weightless container that makes anything you put into it weightless. Very useful, however USE WITH CAUNTION. The pocket, and everything you put in it, will dissapear if you log off. Is good at higher levels when MOBS are dropped a lot of weapons that are too heavy to carry. Just summon a pocket and put them in it until you can go sell them. This spell can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities.<br><br>Eye of Zoom - this isn't as useful a spell as it is fun. It will summon an eye than you can move around and see with. You can't have a pet out to cast this spell. Its fun to scout out an area with or scare lower level people, but it isn't really that useful.<br><br>Lesser Sheilding - this is an upgrade to your level 1 minor shielding spell. Always keep yourself buffed with it.<br><br>Flame Bolt - this is the other DD(direct damage) spell you get at level 8. It has a MUCH farther range than shock of swords and does more damage per hit. The downsides to it are that it takes more mana, has a slightly longer casting time, requires you to have a clear line of sight with your enemy, and will get resisted a lot by things with high fire resists. Its good for pulling things becuase you will be able to get 3 of them off before the monster can reach you, but generally you will want to use Shock of Swords.<br><br>Now you will be able to get to level 12 quickly by killing wisps and turning in Greater Light Stones. You will also make a ton of money. I highly suggest buying a Stein of Mogguk with all your new money. It gives +10 to your intelligence, which gives you more mana. Also, i would buy some other +int necklaces, earrings, and rings. A new robe would be good too(do you wanna wear your newbie robe forever??) Here are the level 12 spells you will want to buy:<br><br>Burnout - This spell will make your pets regen their hp slower, but it will also make them attack better. A good pet buff spell. Always keep it on your pet.<br><br>Bind Affinity - AWESOME SPELL. This will allow you to bind yourself anywhere so that when you die, thats where you will appear. Before you got this spell you had to have other people bind you, and you can only be bound in cities when other people cast it.<br><br>Cancel Magic - this has several uses. First off it can be used to remove any buffs your enemy has on themselves. Secondly, it can be used to remove most(but not all) DoT's(or damage over time spells) that were cast on you by the enemy.<br><br>Ward Summoned - This is a good spell to use in lavastorm. The only problem is that there are way better places to hunt than lavastorm. Against elemenals it is VERY good. It does the damage of fire bolt, and has the low resist, quick casting time, and lower mana that Shock of Steel has. However, it can only be used against summoned things. The only time you will use it is when dueling other people that have pets. <br><br>Summon Fang - This spell summons a 5/26 weapon that will hit magical creatures(hehe wisps!). If you still don't have a magical weapon at this level use this instead of your level 1 summon dagger spell to hit wisps with. You can fight wisps up to level 16, so it will still be usefull. It can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities.<br><br>Elemental Earth - Your earth pet will be the only pet you need to buy. It has massive hp and casts a root spell to keep the enemy away from you. Buffed with burnout and with its massive hp, you might get to full mana before it gets to full health. If that happens use your renew elements spell.<br><br>You also get two area effect spells at this level. You can buy them if you want, but you won't need them. They are almost totally useless for soloing, which is what you should be doing at lower levels.<br><br>At level 12 there are a lot of things open to you. You can kill wisps all the way until level 16. At level 12 your pets will be to hit magical things without wielding magical weapons. Since your level 12 pets will only do 16 damage per hit(and thats the maximum level pets), you should be giving them rusty-two handed weapons. If you can't get any two-handed weapons then just give your pet any weapon. If your pet has a weapon they will do a little more damage than normal even if the weapon doesn't make them hit for a higher maximum damage. Now if you don't want to kill wisps there are a ton of other things to do. <br><br>In Lake Rathe there is a level 15 monk called the hermit. He stands in this hut int he corner of the zone, and repsawns every 5 minutes after being killed. He can get you to level 16 if you don't want to do wisps, or want to mix things up. Summon an earth pet, buff with damage shield and burnout, and then send your pet in and stand back and blast with Shock of Swords until he dies. Tank for pet if needed, however don't do it too much. At level 12 he will kill you quickly. Remember, make sure to outdamage your pet. He is very good exp. and will get you to level 16 preety quick. The loot isn't nearly as good as wisps though.<br><br>Another place to hunt is in OOT(the ocean of tears), which is located between the continents of Antonica and feydwer. You will be hunting sirens in this zone. Go to the docks in freeport and bind yourself there. If you take the ship from freeport to butcher block you will eventually come to two large rocks coming out of the water. Jump off the boat and swim to the rock ont he right. Here you will see two level 12 sirens. Buff your earth pet with burnout and your damage shield and send it in. If you bought your area effect spells this would be the time to use them(in fact it is the ONLY use for them). The sirens hit fairly hard but have low hp. After you kill the two sirens they will start spawning one at a time. Kill them as soon as they spawn very quickly. That way you won't have to fight  2 at a time anymore. This spot is AMAZING exp, however like the hermit, it is not nearly as good loot as wisps. Also, be sure to give your pet a rusty two-handed sword befoe you engage the sirens. The best spot to buy rusty weapons is on the boat from freeport to butcher block. At the first stop you will arrive at sister island. Get off and go in the shop. They sell rusty halberds here. When givin to your pet, they will make your pet do 20 damage a hit.<br><br>Soon you will be level 16. All of these methods will level you fast(although I still think wisps are the best method becuase they give so much money). Once you get to level 16 the best place to hunt is in lake rathe, which is where the hermit was located if you went to fight him from 12-16. Before I talk about lake rathe I will tell you your new spells for level 16:<br><br>Shock of Flame - a new DD spell! At level 12 you didn't get a new DD, except for ward summoned which you probably didn't use. For 70 mana this spell will start off doing 91 damage and eventually raise to 97 damage. <br><br>See Invisible - this spell will allow you to see invisible players and pets. Since your air pet casts invisiblity on itself a lot, its good to use this spell when using an air pet.<br><br>Summon Throwing Daggers - this spell will summon a bunch of throwing dagger that can be given to someone that uses throwing weapons (monks, rogues, and bards in general). This spell can only be bought in the dark elf, gnome, and erudite cities.<br><br>Heatstone - this spell will summon an item that will grant the user infravision. Is good to give to night-blind races or to use yourself if you started as an Erudite or human(Although if you are a begginer you probably did what I said and started as a gnome or high elf, which means you all ready have infravision).<br><br>Staff of Warding - summons an 8/38 staff with a couple charges of glimpse(which always you to see farther). It really doesn't have much use except to play around with the glimpse spell it comes with(or you can give it to a low level newbie...is a good weapon for a newbie). This spell can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities.<br><br>Level 16 pets - At this level I would suggest buying all the pets. Also at this level you can not buy all the pets in your guild. The level 16 and 20 pets must be bought in OOT(the ocean of tears). I forget which island has the vendor that sells the pets, so ask around.<br><br>Shielding - An upgrade to your lesser shielding spell. keep it on at all times. The extra hp and ac can save your life if you need to tank and its a close battle.<br><br>Phantom Leather - this spell boots your AC and also lets your regen your HP a little faster. It is good for if you are going into a tough battle where you will probably have to tank.<br><br>At level 16 you get the ability to start researching. Go to your guild and put one point into your researching skill and it will be maxed until level 20(there is a bug where after putting a point in at your guild it raises your skill higher then its suposed to). Of all the pure casters, magicians have it the hardest when it comes to researching. They have to combine old spells, a word, and an item to make scrolls they can use. I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about researching becuase it would take a LONG time to explain. So go to castersrealm.com and look at the magician research stuff. Hehe if you are a newbie first starting out, feel lucky. When i first started the game resarching was nearly impossible. Since then, however, they have made it easier(although it is still fairly hard).<br><br>Okay Now back to the hunting guide. At level 16 venture to Lake rathe. Here you will find a bunch of aviak guards that are level 16-20. For their level, they aren't that hard. At level 16 you will be able to take level 20 aviaks. This is also the level when you should start grouping. Almost all the aviaks in this zone are close together, and will attack you at the same time. The only time you will want to solo when hunting them is if you are at the single aviak spawn, or at the entrance to the arena zone where you can take the two aviaks one at a time. However this isn't always possible, as they are sometimes camped, so you will have to group with another person(or two other people if you want to take the 3-spawn aviaks). Aviaks are pretty good loot dropping up to 3pp and FS(fine steel) weapons which will sell for about 5pp each at the ogre vendors in the zone(don't worry even though they are ogres they sell to everyone). The aviak guards also drop words which you can use to research some of your level 16 spells(if you didn't buy them already).<br><br>Fighting aviak guards will get you to level 20 pretty quickly. When you get to level 20 its time for new spells! Here is the list of spells:<br><br>Bolt of Flame - this spell does MASSIVE damage and has a VERY long range too! But be careful, it has a huge taunt rate so you will usually want to use an earth or air pet when soloing becuase of their root/stun spells. Also you have to have a clear line of sight for it too work.<br><br>Elemental Shield - a fairly useful buff for things that cast spells. Raises your cold and fire resistances.<br><br>Spear of Warding - summons a magical spear that has a small fire and cold resist+ tacked on to it. Not all that usefull. Give it to a newbie or a a rogue without a magic piercing weapon. can also be given to pet, but once you hit 29 and get your rune swords, it becomes useles to give to pets. It can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities.<br><br>Renew Summoning - this is a very nice upgrade to your level 8 pet-only healing spell. Use it when your pet is low in HP or if your mana is full and your pet's hp isn't full.<br><br>Summon Arrows - this spell summons a bunch of magical arrows. Give them to people that use bows and don't want to spend money making or buying arrows. Fairly useful. Can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities.<br><br>Summon Waterstone - this summons a stone with a charge of enduring breath, which makes you able to breathe under-water. Great for when you want to go to kedge keep at higher levels, or just to keep in your inventory incase you for some reason get caught under-water. It can only be bought in the erudite, dark elf, and gnome cities.<br><br>Shield of Flame - an upgrade to your level 8 damage shield. Definately use it to buff yuor pet before you attack something or in a group on the tanks. <br><br>Rain of Fire - an area effect spell. Is useful when your group wants to take multiple mobs and their is no enchanter around to mezz the extras. Be careful though, it will get the monsters mad at you. It is limited in its use.<br><br>Level 20 pets - I suggest that you buy all of the pets at this level. You can't buy them all at your guild. You have to go to the merchant in OOT on one of the islands to get the rest that aren't sold at your guild.<br><br>Now the level 20 fighting place - SOUTH KARANA!!!! This zone has TONS of stuff in it. At level 20 there are many things you can do. First off is the aviak city. The aviaks here anywhere from about levels 15-30. Get a group and kill rooks that spawn on the bottom, or go up to the penthouse.  Splitpaw - right outside the dungeon of split paw there are three spires and a hill. Level 24-29 gnolls spawn here. If you are able to get in a group the exp. is pretty decent. Treants, these things are pretty good exp. and VERY good loot. They are heavily camped though, so you might have to wait to get in a group. Alsom treants drop your faction with druids and with qeynos, so don't kill them if you don't want to be KOS at the druid rings or in qeynos. Centaurs, these guys can be good exp. and drop some nice items too. The best place to hunt them is near the centaur outpost. Many will wander by the outpost. You will be able to solo any that don't con red. If you get in a group with someone that can track it is even better because sometimes the pickings get slim and having someone who can easily find more make for good exp. Also, there are a couple merchants in one of the stables at the centaur outpost. Sell there. <br><br>The last thing this wonderful zone offerrs....the hermit. In the middle of nowhere is alevel 20 ranger. He is VERY good exp. Why? becuase he has a 3 MINUTE SPAWN. Not only that but the loot he drops isn't bad. PLUS, sometimes he drops FS two-handed weapons which you can give to your pet to make them do 24 damage a hit. The only problem is that he sits in a hut with a door that won't open. To pull him out go near the chimney of the house and say 'kill you'. After doing that a few times he will attack you through the wall and your pet will go after him. You won't be able to use your level 20 bolt spell the first time you attack him becuase it won't go through the wall. use your level 16 DD that will still hit him. I HIGHLY suggest that you use a water or air pet to camp him. Why? Becuase since he repsawns every 3 minutes, your earth pet will never be able to regen in time, only your water or air pet will be able to keep up(well the fire pet could keep up too, but you don't want to use him here, dies way too fast). After you kill him the first time you won't need to say 'kill you' anymore. As soon as he spawns again just target your pet and type /assist. Then the hermit will auto maticcaly be targeted and you can pull him out of the house using your level 16 DD, and then once he teleportes out of the house you can use your level 20 DD. However, if you are using a water pet and not an air pet, try to keep him in the house, pull him with your level 16 DD and then send your pet in, and then burn with caution so he stays on your water pet and does teleport out to attack you. If you are using an air pet it is fine to pull him out becuase the air pet will stun him and let you DD.<br><br>With everything it has to offer South karana will be able to get you to level 30. You can easily get from level 20 to 27 just soloing the hermit. Then once you get to level 27 you can go into splitpaw and fighting in a group to get decent exp. If the hermit is camped by someone ele you can always do centaurs, gnolls ouside of splitpaw, and aviaks. If you don't mind losing faction with the druids and qeynos you can also kill treants which are a VERY good money source. <br><br>Once you get to level 30 you can go out and do whatever you want. Level 30 is the first 'hell' level so leveling to level 31 will take you a while. Also on the level 24 and 29 spells....buy ALL of them. Also, some of the level 24 and 29 pet spells can't be bought and MUST be researched. You should be able to get past without researching extra pets, but you might want to. Also, when you get to level 29 ALWAYS give your pet two rune swords that you are able to summon once you get to level 29. They will make your pet do a lot more damage. If you want to look at all the magician spells or how to research go to castersrealm.com . GREAT sight. Maybe I will see you on the Nameless!<br><br>Corpusnuntia/Divineshadow/Natalos/Naltec/Plantmaster/Zuranthium<br><br>Player of many characters on the Nameless server.<br><br>Give me a good rating for this one! Took me an hour to write! Also sorry about the spell/grammer mistakes. I am sure I made some, but I didn't have time to check em. *wave* <br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I just wanted to clear up a few errors and oversights in this post, since the author is toting it as the be-all and end-all newbie guide.<br><br>First off, as a magician you are specifically a pet class.&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, it is your responsibility to get to know your pets and their capabilities early on in the game.  This is the reason you're given access to all four from the very beginning.  You MUST purchase all four pets and become accustomed to them.  A mage who doesn't know his pets is a bad mage and will be recognized as such by the people he groups with.<br><br>Secondly, rusties equipped by pets do nothing more than look cool.  They do not, in any way enhance your pet's fighting skills.  Even when your pet (at level 24) becomes capable of dual-wielding, he will do the same damage with the same delay barehanded.  The only weapons that will enhance his fighting skills are weapons that process (i.e. velium weapons), and even with these only if he's been buffed for dexterity.<br><br>Thirdly, Evocation!  Evocation!  Evocation!  You must start early in always keeping this particular skill maxxed at all times.  At earlier levels, it won't mean much.  But once you become able to specialize it will make a huge difference in your effectiveness at later levels.  Although there are some who disagree, I think most mages feel that it's silly and wasteful to specialize in anything other than Evocation (there is an argument in favor of specializing in conjuration - but I personally feel it's a losing argument).  Therefore, your 'shock' spells should be used sparingly.  The 'bolt' spells are more difficult to use (because they require a clear line of sight), but will be more useful to you in the long run.  'Shock' spells are really only useful when it's impossible to get a clear line of sight (i.e. when a MOB is surrounded by tanks and you can't position yourself correctly to get a clear line of sight).  If you've specialized in evocation and have this skill maxxed, you will be incredibly powerful in your later years!<br><br>And finally, Research!  Research!  Research!  The suggestion that you might want to 'get by' without researching all your pets is nonsense.  If you plan to do anything aside from sitting in one place and killing the same thing over and over again, you'll need all your pets.  Different dungeons require different pets and different MOBs (which have different resists) require different pets.  Also, if you've ignored your research, you're gonna spend a fortune buying your higher level spells from other mages.  I personally charge 30 p for each Lvl. 20 - 29 researched spell that I sell, 50 p for each 30 - 39, and 100 p for each 40 - 49.  (This is on top of the player having to supply me with the research components.)  My justification for this is that I spend my time and effort working on my research skill - something the other mage was too lazy to do.  I should be paid well for this.  (At higher levels, most mages have come to terms with how important it is to have ALL your pets and are generally happy to pay my price.)<br><br>P. S.  NEVER rely completely on the advice of just one person!  There's more than one way to skin a cat (or a kobold...or a gnoll...or...)<br>&nbsp;<br>Dovilo Ravenstear<br>52 Mage of the Tribunal<br>Tuatha De Danann<br><br><br>Have Pet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Will Travel.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I'd disagree a bit on the character selection on this one.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bottom line is play what ever race you feel comfortable with.  In the long run stats don't really matter that much. You will pick up stat enhancing equipment and get your INT up to 200 without a lot of trouble.  The advantage of playing a human is that you get an Exp bonus.  As you get older and you (and everyone else) maxes out the INT at 200, you still get the exta Exp bonus. Might not see the benefit as much early on, but with INT maxed, the Exp bonus is a help and will let you level faster.  The night blind thing is a pain short term, but you get heatstone fairly quick and your summonded staffs are great light sources.  You won't be blind long (also ask a magi brother or sister to cast a heatstone or coldstone for you, never had someone say no and I do it for newbies now as well).  So the issue above with humans can be resolved short term. Don't aviod this race because of some short term issues.<br><br>In the short term stats do help out.  If you are really interested in stats then the Euridite is a great choice.  Has the highest intelligence by far (means you have to find less INT items long term).  The night blind stuff can be dealt with short term (I'm an Euridite magi and never found it to be much of an issue). Gnome is a good choice, less INT but good other stats.  The High Elf is more of a WIS type character.  Has the second lowest INT (long term won't matter, but we're talking short term here). Vision is good, but you can fix that in short order with the non infravision characters.<br><br>I would suggest taking your last 5 points and putting them into AGI or STR.  I don't see a lot of benefit in CHA.  It will help you with selling but 5 points doesn't do much.  Spend a level or two in BB and kill gnolls (or have an enchanter friend sell your stuff or get CHA items to help). It quickly raises your faction with the merchants of qeynos.  I am regarded warmly by all of them and get good prices.  The AGI will help you avoid getting hit and at lower levels that is a real benefit. The reality is 5 points really has little effect no matter where you put them. Putting them in STR lets you carry more stuff.  Again not a big benefit.  I'd stick with AGI on the last 5.<br><br>Cetus<br>The Nameless<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>YOU ARE COMPLETELY WRONG CETUS. Humans get NO exp. bonus over the other races that magicians can be. They level at the exact same speed. I said in my magician guide for NEWBIES to start out as high-elves or gnomes. As in characters that have never played the game before or only have one other low level character. Gnomes and High-elves are the best race for newbies becuase they are the two races that magicians can choose that have night vision and aren't evil. Also, high elves and gnomes start on the continent of Feydwer which is MUCH better for a newbie. Less danger than on all the other continents. Trust me, I know what I am talking about. Stop trying to think you know more or know better than a master magician. My guide, especially the 2nd one I wrote that added more stuff, is very good.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Zuranthium,<br><br>Your posts by and large are quite informative.&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned a great deal about the Magician Class from them.  Nothing that I hadn't ALREADY learned, from other sites, but still informative.<br><br>However, all the good guides in the world don't justify your attitude towards other posters.  In my efforts to learn more about the Magician, I've been flipping through this board, and I found some things that I think the other posters here will find interesting.<br><br>Your guide is posted at least twice here, the VERY long one.  Once under its own thread, and once in someone else's thread, about their own guide.  To me, in a clear effort to try to shut out anybody else's guide but your own.<br><br>On several occasions, you posted responses to other people's guides.  In just about every one of those replies, you disagreed very rudely with the people who wrote those guides, basically calling their opinions stupid and idiotic.  Then you would occasionaly call yourself a 'Master Magician', tell them to stop acting like they know more than you, and reference them to your own guide.<br><br>As to your 'Master Magician' status.  I recall a post where someone informed the board that you're really a Magician in your lower twenties.  Could you please, for the basis of accurately evaluating your guides, post your specific level so people will know?<br><br>All of that is for the other posters here.  I want anyone who is considering posting a guide, to be welcome to do so.  I promise them, no matter what this Zuranthium may threaten, you will have readers.<br><br>For myself, Zuranthium, I am extremely irritated by your very arrogant attitude and condescension towards other posters.  IMO, Centhat was right on the money earlier, and he owed you no apologies.  I am not going to read ANY of your posts or guides until you decide to stop lambasting anyone who tries to compete with your guides.  This isn't your board.  Stop your silly power play.  Apologize in a seperate post for your repeated insults and arrogance.  Also, stop plagiarizing other guides.  When you wrote your guide, you should have SPECIFICALLY cited the other guides used.  You did not.  You led others to believe that your guide was the fruits of your brain alone. It was not.<br><br>Werokh Mormegil/Amandil &lt;Akh Valahr&gt;<br>Dwarven Paladin/High Elf Magician<br>Cazic-Thule Server<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Calm down, it's a game.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've have read in many places that humans do get exp bonus.  I'd have to look for the sources now, but others can read eqcasters, stratics, everlore, and find the same references.<br><br>I don't want to be rude to you, but I have a different opinion than you on races.  Gnome and High-elves do get night vision.  That's great! If that is a concern for people, then they should play those races.  The point of my note was to say play the race you like best and equalize out the stats with equipment or equipment that enhances your short comings (like night vision).<br><br>I prefer the Euridite for his starting INT.  It is the primary stat and I like not having to look as much of INT equipment. Also for trade skills I like having the high INT early on so that you can get the skills up before you get INT equipment. I quickly moved him to Qeynos and got a bind there.  I agree that there are good spots in Feydwer. I also feel that Qeynos and Freeport are good spots as well.  There are a great number of mobs in the newbie area and good adjacent areas to move to.  I had a lot of fun in BB. Trains were bad but there are some great places in the dungeon that are fairly low risk and give great exp because few people move to those areas.<br><br>I've always thought of a high elf more for the WIS. In the end, once you get beyond the Euridite the other races (except human) are all pretty close on INT. So, again, if you want the night vision, then play the high elf and look for equipment to make up the INT.<br><br>Zuranthium, these boards are for everyone to express their opinions, not just you. I don't appreciate you personal attack.  I never said I knew more, just that my opinon is different.  As you get older you will learn that part of life, and your success, is how you handle other people with views that may not be the same as yours. I too have written articles on specific issues (managing magician engagement risk, solo hunting strategy, and a new article to be published soon)which have been published on the stratics website. While I may not be a master magician, I am not a newbie to the game and have put some thought into how to play it.  I'm interested in, and respect your opinions, I would ask that you give the same respect to myself and others that post on these boards.<br><br>Cetus<br>The Nameless<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hello all!<br><br>I am Naeluuven a 15th level mage on the Xegony server (i had a 20th mage but i deleted him)<br><br>Ok this guide will be about soloing from lvl 4 to 16 =)<br><br>Now first thing you must do is get yourself over to steamfont mountains,(make sure to be stocked up on malachite!)once there, you need to find the first kobold camp,say that its camped,and get ready for some fun! (if it is camped you can take the one on the hill or the spiderlings and clockworks)First make sure you bought bandages the water pet spell (or earth pet,i prefer water but earth isnt bad either)your ae spell,summon food/drink,and a nuke (if you cant offored these spells i suggest the food/water, a pet,fire flux,and invis)<br><br>Time to fight!!!<br>now after you have food and drink,a good pet,and are shielded with full mana (fm for short,) get ready to bust up some kobolds,<br>First strategy for kobolds is to always take out the con yellow or the shaman ALWAYS focus on these(its also a good idea to be bound in akanon right where you zone in,its a blind spot for the npcs there)now once you have nuked put your pet into the fray,now once he is at 70 hp join him with the ae ready and keep doing this till all the kobolds are dead,rest,repeat till your lvl 7 (note at lvl 6 let other people join and say they can have what cons green to you). now at lvl 7 solo by the mino caves or windmills (try to not to fight the rats and big colckworks, AND STAY AWAY FROM THE SKELETONS!!!!)once you get lvl 8 mem invis,(you did buy that from neriak right =))cast it, and head home! (refresh invis whene needed)you should have gotten a fair amount of cash from those drakes and kobolds,so once home buy a water pet,your new nukes,dmg shield if you get one at 8 (i forgot hehe) and a summon weapon spell, and gate back to Akanon.<br><br>Ahhh new nukes how wonderful,use shock of blades instead of the fire based one (forgot name)it has a faster casting time for less mana and is resisted less,go to east/west commons and kill spiders and stuff that cons black/yellow/blue.<br><br>Once you get lvl 10 go to freeport get a bind at the docks,get on the boat and once you zone into oot (ocean of tears)you will see an island with a dock, and a penenusela that looks like florida,jump off at the penenusela and summon a pet,kill sisters till lvl 12 gate back to fp and head home.<br><br>Get your spells,and head to the desert of northern ro for some dervs,bind at the tunnel,facing the desert,and get in a camp 5 or wall camp group (dorns camp may also work but its dangerous he can be indifferent one second and thene bs you for 120 the other)once you get lvl 14 from dervs (the exp comes quik, trust me)head to oasis and kill dw caimens,regular crocs and caimens and giant spiders/madmen (you can also do the orc camp 1,you can get there by heading along the beach keeping the ocean to your left heading from north ro)till you get lvl 16,go home to get your spells and i think by now you can fnd a place to hunt on your own.<br><br>Notes:<br>Bind at the far end of the docks in oasis.<br><br>Make sure to get 3 back packs and the dimensional pocket spell before going to sister island,fill the pockets with halberds and the packs with belts/words/runes.<br><br>You can sell to Pardor the blessed in commons (hes in the middle hut on the left facing west commons).<br><br>Work on tailoring as soon as possible,you can make raw silk to wear, sell or both with the spider silks off giant spiders.<br><br>Sorry that i didnt go up to 20 i will add that once im there, again,and theres a certain spawn i camp from 16-20 that i didnt want to give away till i am done with it,i will probebly add it once i get there.<br><br>Have fun,<br>Naeluuven 15th mage of the Xegony server.<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ahh...Magicians...the masters of summoning. Most important thing to remember is ALWAYS have a pet up before you engage in combat. As far as i'm concerned a magician IS his or her pet (moreso at higher lvls then lower) and if you lose your pet in combat you are pretty well done with as you have no way to crowd control. No root, stuns, fear, nada.<br><br>If you are soloing the most effective pet is definately Earth as he can withstand much more damage than any of the other pets and has the ability to root. Start by buffing your pet with Burnout and a Damage Shield - pull the mob with Malise/Malisement/Malosi - send your pet in for combat - give your pet a bit of time to create an aggro and root the mob then blast to your hearts content. The mob will want to start pounding on you from chain blasting but because he is being rooted by your pet he is unable to get to you. Malise helps a great deal in having your pet successfully root the mob as is lowers Magic Resist (along with poison, fire, and cold).<br><br>Group strategy, however, is much different. Your main goal is to maximize damage while allowing the tank(s) to keep the mob aggro'd on them. You can do this by waiting a while before you start to blast....this will give the tank the time s/he needs to taunt the mob well enough so that it will stay on him. Once you have given the tank some time to taunt you may start blasting. However one important thing to remember is to space your blasts apart for the same reason you gave the tank time in the beginning of battle, to keep the mob on him. Pet selection for groups is also different as the majority of group you will have someone who can Snare or Darkness the mobs. You therefore do not want an earth pet as his root will break the snare or darkness which is better than root. When a mob is snared or darknessed they will stop all movement and melee combat when they get low enough health, however if they are rooted they stop all movement but continue to melee no matter how low they are on health. Your best pet therefore is probably your Fire Pet as he has a self damage shield and delivers a decent DD spell to help down the mobs faster.<br><br>For those that may be wondering, the reason it is so important to keep the mob on the tank is because he will have much higher Armor Class and Hit Points than you. Because he has high AC he will get hit much less often and when he does get hit it will be for less damage which saves the healers (the backbone of a group) mana. Also, because you have much fewer HP's your health bar will drop alot faster than the tanks which creates alot of stress for the healer as he will end up having to chain heal. Chain healing is a VERY bad thing as it creates a very large aggro on the healer. The mobs can potentially swarm the healer making it nearly impossible for him to cast, therefore resulting in no more heals...<br><br>Theres my two copper....enjoy<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I like to give my air pet a gnoll hide whip in his main and a dagger of dropping in his off. This gives him a double stun and the dagger weakens the mob which is a nice taunt. <br>Air pet is monk based so he has the highest AC of them all and even though hitpoints aren't as high as the earth pet he get hit much less often so he lives longer.<br>Basically if you let your pet die you are in BIG trouble while soloing.
