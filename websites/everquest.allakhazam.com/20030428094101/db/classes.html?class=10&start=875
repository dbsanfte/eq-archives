	   <tr><td colspan=2>I know a lot of people hate dying. Lord knows I do and I hate looking for a rezz or hunting my body down, but my friends and I sat down the other night and were laughing over our most memorable death we have had on EQ. So for all here to share in the experience what was your most memorable death?<br><br>Mine was when I was checking out a new zone Stonebrunt Mtns opened up and myself and 2 friends (a level 53 Shaman and 55 Warrior) decided to go check out this place. Well everything conned blue and higher to me and the other two a lot of green cons. We started out normal just running around checking things out. Then I hear those famous last words. &quot;So you guy's WANNA HAVE SOME FUN.&quot; I am thinking sure why not I am always up for fun and I am secure in my level. Well we went after a named mob in the zone that we say. Con: RED what would you like your TOMBSTONE to SAY. Maybe I should have taken the hint, but hey it is all in fun. Well Dax my warrior buddy starts hacking at it and I am shooting arrows and the occasional spell at it. Major resists. Well our Shammy went LD just as we get 3 adds. Hmmmm where is this going. I see over group chat Hey I am getting low on health from the Warrior. I am trying to heal but they are hitting him hard. Next thing I know I got major aggro and the Warrior dies. So with SoW on I am running like a little girl yelling HELP at the top of my lungs. I find the zone wall and think hmmmmm lets follow the zone wall and I will find the zone. Wrong I ended up falling one moment I am running the next I see those dreaded words LOADING PLEASE WAIT.......... Fell for 1,000 pts of damage. Well we decided after that lets head over to GFaydark. I needed the Ivy Rune off of the browny there and we did not want to die agian. Wrong we forgot the golden rule KNOCK on WOOD when you say this. We got the Rune and so did my wife for her Ranger. Then we got hit by 5 brownie scouts. I hear RUN over group chat. Well would have been nice to run if I was not rooted to the forest floor. I get stunned 3 times and during one of my turns in the circle I was doing I see my buddy Dax go down. Not cool when the tank that is level 55 goes down. Who was next. Yep you guessed it your fav Ranger Rauvin. I yelled over at the wife RUN NOW. She bolted and I died. Then the Shammie got it sqaure in the eyes. We all end up back at our bind points. So who is still alive I ask. My wife sitting across from me is typing and I can hear her say I am and I have no clue were I am. Over group chat we all see &quot;me&quot; in small letters and the following &quot;I am still alive and hiding, I have no clue where I am and I need help...DAX GEA RAUV I am going to kill you guys if you do not come get NOW.......<br><br>Well that was two death in one night, but I will never forget either one. Too look back on it now....I was pissed at the time, but now I cannot keep from laughing about it all.<br><br>I hope you all enjoyed my rambling and I hope you can share some of your memorable moments here on this BBS like forum.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Dec 21 03:45:00 2001</em><br>&nbsp;<br>May Karana Bless You All,<br><br>Rauvin Darkfeather<br>Protector of the Great Storm and Follower of Karana</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Awesome idea for a thread Rauvin. It deserved the excellent I gave it !<br><br>My most memorable death? Gee there's been so many. Okay, frontier mountains lev 33. Group DISBANDED on a bad pull of giants from the fortress, ran and left while a Chanter and I tried to keep some order. Well it was a losing battle. So being half dead, I decided to just run my buns off as far away from the chanter as possible, maybe try and save him. And my sow was still good. At least that part of the plan worked. I managed to outdistance the initial sg's, but dropped right into a pile of wanderers, who popped me a few times. So, on I ran very low on health. Still making distance though. Ran right into some wandering goblins. They popped my a few times, but I got away, just barely above one bub health I ran a few mins til I knew I was safe ( new to the zone I had no idea where the zone locs were ). I sat and camped out succesfully = ). Right after that I re-entered the world. Right next to a wandering casting goblin, He popped me, I ran, got some distance. Hitting my /loc hot key all the while becuase I was SO lost in this zone. &quot; Goblin soandso casts a spell on you &quot; dropped dead. &quot; Loading Please wait &quot; Which immediately goes to the server login screen ( yup got bumped from the server&nbsp;&nbsp;). BEFORE I could write down the loc of my actual death. Frustrated I went to bed. The next day I searched what must have been ALMOST been the entire zone, no luck, and no luck finding a necro or anyone who had stumbled across my corpse. On the search goes. Finally I give in and petition ( not thinking it would do any good, but, hey I DID use LOC before I died, not my fault I got bumped from the server ). I found a really cool one who hooked me up and waited by my corpse while I tracked her down. While looting, I got aggrod and was forced to run and camp out again. Re-entered the world started looting again, got aggrod, died. No prob I now had loc of corpse, bid my good day to the gm and started out again. Looted corpse, aggrod, died. 6th time is a charm right. Yup I finally looted and moved on. Needless to say it was a rough beginning to my Kunark experience. ( not to mention spiders killed me 3 times near FV and that named lizard caster looking thing nabbed me once ). Thank goodness for the overthere = ). That's my worst death<br><br>Montye<br>&nbsp;<br>True, cities have banks, but alas, I have no money. So why leave the comforts of the wild?</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I've got a couple to add to the mix.<br><br>The first was right after I'd gotten sixth level.&nbsp;&nbsp;Things were going well, I was about to get spells and I was getting about a blue and a half per level in exp.  I could still beat on a yellow and expect to come out on top.<br><br>Enter the undead ruins in Qeynos Hills.  They have some dreadbone skeletons that 90% of the characters in EQ would laugh at.  I was not yet at the point where I could laugh at them.  <br><br>I see three people trying a fighting withdrawl aginst these things, so being the helpful ranger that I am I jump in and start beating on them despite their red cons.  One by one my new found fellows fall before the dreadbones.  I'm the last on left and die, right over my newbie bind spot.  <br><br>LOADING PLEASE WAIT<br>A dreadbone skeleton hits YOU<br>A dreadbone skeleton hits YOU<br>A dreadbone Skeleton hits YOU<br>LOADING PLEASE WAIT<br>A dreadbone skeleton hits YOU<br>A dreadbone skeleton hits YOU<br>A dreadbone Skeleton hits YOU<br>LOADING PLEASE WAIT<br>A dreadbone skeleton hits YOU<br>A dreadbone skeleton hits YOU<br>A dreadbone Skeleton hits YOU<br>LOADING PLEASE WAIT<br>A dreadbone skeleton hits YOU<br>A dreadbone skeleton hits YOU<br>A dreadbone Skeleton hits YOU<br>LOADING PLEASE WAIT<br><br>It's fortunate for me that some kind soul noticed the slaughter of my continuing respawning self and managed to get the guards over to where I was so they could kill the skellies.  Not only was this the largest number of deaths in a row in EQ history it also put me from a couple of blues to 7th back down to just above 5th level.  Needless to say I was REALLY pissed and made it's my lifes work to get high enough to wipe out the entire ruins for an entire game day.  It took me about a week to get there.<br><br>The other memoral death was while I was in Kael Drakkel.  It wasn't during a raid, or a run to WL; I had managed to get the named dragon's tail from EW and was looking for Gleed to turn it in to get my Bow of the Huntsman.  Well I had spent four days killing dwarfs and tracking wolves in GD to get to dubious with the Kromrif; and due to many guild hunts in Skyshrine for guardian and sentry equipment I was warmly to the Kromzek.  <br><br>There is, however, a third faction I'd managed to neglect.  <br><br>I'd managed to track down Gleed and targeted the giant that I belived to be him.  I walk into the room he's in and WHAM!  I suddenly have four giants on me and die in about three quarters of a second.  <br><br>LOADING PLEASE WAIT<br><br>I'm bound in Kael, which is good because it means I don't have far to run naked.  So I manage to memorize spells, zone out to SOW and Camo myself, zone back and and start to where I belive my corpse is; beneath the feet of the supposedly benovelent giant who has my bow.  <br><br>About ten seconds into heading over camo drops.  I figure I didn't need it to get that far so I'd scout arround and see what killed me.  I'm standing on the bridge looking things over, my corpse is where I can see it, but out of range for pulling.  I con the nearby giants and manage to find the one who attacked me.  King Tormax faction makes an instant and ugly impression upon me.  Ready to Attack.  Not pretty.  I use my paltry sneak and hide skill to get close enough to grab my corpse and begin to drag it away from the killer giant.<br><br>Anyone who's spent some time in Kael knows that dragging a KOS corpse is a fast way to a faster death.  I hear the agro tag line of this giant and begin to run for it.  Unfortunitly I'm on a slippery bridge and can't get in purchase.  My corpse falls off the bridge down among the dire wolves below, and I follow it hoping that somehow pathing will save me.  I was wrong.  Four giants fall on top of me, bashing, kicking, stabbing, slashing and biting the entire time.  Now as I'm dying I manage to look up through the blood and brain tissue dripping down my face and see who standing before me raising a mace.  Gleed.  The giant I belived to be in the room across the bridge; he was standing below the bridge I'd twice crossed and twice died crossing, down among the dire wolves who now had two Ratslayer corpses to nibble on.  <br><br>LOADING PLEASE WAIT<br><br>I re-mem, re-buff, re-zone, re-sow, re-camo, re-zone, and re-head for my corpse.  I get there, cammo has, of course, dropped.  I see my corpse in the pit, and fortunitly the giants have all gone back to their spawn spots.  I loot my corpse, clean up my naked corpse and look up to see Gleed grinning at me warmly.  'You bastard,' I think to myself as I walk up to him to collect my bow.  I give him the tail, get the bow and am overjoyed.  Two deaths are worth the amazing piece of equipment I now posess.  <br><br>Here comes the memorable part.  I con Gleed.  He's a nice cheery blue, with no other giants arround and all the wolves milling about at the end of the pit they seem to enjoy so much.  I figure, 'What the hell, you only live thrice,' and let fly at him with my new, uber, procing bow.  What do I see as my arrow connects and he turns to come after me?<br><br>Your will is not sufficent to command this weapon.<br><br>So I'm running to the zone line with a bunch of giants after me, and I almost make it.  Almost.  <br><br>So there it is, hope you enjoy it, and learn from it.   Gleed is under the bridge, not across it.  He shoulda been a troll.<br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Great thread, here's my favorite death. One of the Ivy quests for my lvl 30 ranger required killing Slaythe the Slayer in Lower Guk, a live Froglok. I had been on a tear with my Ivy quests and figured I could continue my luck in Guk. <br><br>Not having been anywhere near Guk before, I decided I would wander there myself and get advice from those people camping the zone. When I get to Upper Guk the Frogloks conned indifferent to me, nice. So I am wandering around Upper Guk when I come across a 34 Warrior girl and ask her to lead me to Lower Guk. She does, but when I zone in, it is not the green cons from above but lots of yellow and reds. That would require lots of backup, so I decided to head home and wait for guild.<br><br>Just as I am leaving the warrior is mobbed and I decide to do the friendly thing and heal. Oh no, she kills the thing and I take a faction hit. Now I know getting out is going to be more painful.<br><br>I zone into Upper Guk and 95% of my track is green. So i start walking, and no froglok gives me a second look. But this tunnel isn't looking very familiar, and I proceed to walk into a room where there is a light blue con. He decides to play the hero, and his 2 green friends join in. <br><br>I have no idea why but I decide to evacuate even though they could barely hit me. I mean, I can find the way out or even a zone back into Lower Guk, right? So I just start running, with Sow I am twice as fast as these guys. But now, everything is aggroing me. With my speed and since they were mostly green, I honestly ran for like 5 minutes and picked up no less than 40 Forgloks. I was running so crazy I would double back and see frogloks I had aggroed earlier who had already given up on me.<br><br>Well, I finally ended up in a room full of casters and committed to a battle royale of me versus Upper Guk. Not pretty. The extraction of my corpse was another adventure, but all in all it was by far the most memorable death.<br><br>Moseby<br>Ranger of the 39th Season<br>Kindred Spirit Guardians<br>Druzzil Ro<br>&nbsp;<br>Moseby Dirtysouth<br>50 Ranger<br>Druzzil Ro<br>Kindred Spirit Guardians</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Great idea for a thread Rauvin!<br><br>Hmmm, my most memorable death. I must admit, their are plenty to choose from. So here's a small sampling.<br><br>It's my first day in the game ever, and Lashara is a level 1 naked wood elf wandering around the Faydark. I had never played the game before, and my boyfriend was on the way to come help me get accustomed. He send me a tell. &quot;Just go down the lift to the newbie garden and hunt there. I'll be there in a few minutes.&quot; Newbie garden? Where's that? So I head down the lift and wander around for a bit. Suddenly...<br>An orc centurion hits YOU for 8 points of damage.<br>An orc centurion hits YOU for 3 points of damage.<br>I start running. I don't know where I'm going, but I'm running to get there. My first death, lying naked in the Greater Faydark with 4 cents beating on me, and without a CLUE as to where I died.<br>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br><br>-- <br><br>I'm about 12th level, and hunting somewhere in the Commons. A lion attacks me, and I was soloing. He cons yellow to me, but seeing as I was too far from the zone to run, I attack the lion. Five minutes later, the lion is laying dead at my feet. No without a lot of work, mind you. I am completely out of mana and have a total of around 6 hit points to my name. Whew! I said, and sat down in my safe spot to rest and recuperate. Suddenly....YOU have been hit for 3 points of damage! I look up from my book and there's the measly goblin who is so green to me it isn't funny, smashing on me because I am sitting in his seat. Under normal conditions I would have healed myself, but remember I am out of mana. I get the goblin down to half health before:<br>A goblin hits YOU for 6 points of damage!<br>YOU die!<br>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT....<br><br>Grrrrrr.<br>--<br><br>About 16 levels after this (level 28), Lashara is huting in the Frontier Mountains. Or she was. Being over-encumbered, and out of arrows, she decides to make the long, and dangerous trek bck to the city of Firiona Vie. All goes well until she actually enters the FV zone. It is twilight, the time of day when the drachnids are most abundant. Our ranger casts Camo on herself (SoW was still up) and starts running along the bank of the river, conning each mob to make sure it can't see her. And then, about halfway to FV....<br><br>&quot;You feel yourself starting to appear.&quot;<br><br>The words that poured out of my mouth at that point are not found in any dictionary. Two seconds later I am no longer invisible, and about 20 drachnids have their attention focused solely on me. I start to run.<br>At the end of the river, by the big Iksar statue, I see an Iksar standing there. Wishing to warn of him the huge string of trouble following me, and perhaps enlist some help, I do a /yell. As I run by, I notice his name is Vekis. And then....<br><br>Vekis begins to cast a spell.<br>You have been hit by non-melee for 665 points of damage!<br>He was a level 56 NPC Iksar Necromancer.<br><br>By now, I am in big sh*t. But with SoW on I am starting to outdistance the drachnids and they haven't rooted me. I run past the guards to the bridge, and breathe a sigh of relief. I am safe.<br><br>WRONG.<br><br>Pain and suffering tries to strike YOU, but misses!<br>YOU die!<br>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br><br>In my terrfied flight across the map, one of the drachnids has poisoned me. It worked out pretty well for him, I guess. I was pissed.<br><br>And those my friends, are my 3 most memorable deaths.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lashara Dyran<br>Keeper of the wolves<br>Ranger of the 54th path<br>Lanys T'Vyl<br>"I just find the paths.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Mine was in Crushbone around level 15.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was grouping in the throne room when someone pulled a tower train consisting of Crush, D'Vinn and their cronies.  We were already in wild melee with all the legos and whatnot in the throne room.  Bam, Bam, Bam - three group memebrs die and everyone starts to run.  I ran striaght for the window and jumped right out.  Problem was I was sowed and not too used to the speed yet.  I ran straight at the moat and fell in.  The huge train followed the others to the zone, so I was safe for a moment.  Well, my swimming was already pretty good, but I couldn't get up that damn ladder.  I kept getting to the top and falling back in.  Soon I see the other two groups members died before they reached the zone, so, of course the entire gang of orcs is heading back to take care of me along with everthing else they pick up along the way.  D'vinn was the first to jump in the water with me.  I began to swim.  Being sowed and a pretty good swimmer, I began to out pace him.<br><br>The problem was I was also aggroing evrything along the topside of the moat.  By now the rest of the train had jumped in the moat.  I knew I was going to die when I got back to the ladder in front (I swam all the way around), so I took a great screen shot of me with about 30 orcs and D'vinn swimming after me.  Too bad I lost that picture, it was a classic.  LOADING......<br><br>When I got back I jumped in to retrieve my corpse.  There were a million tells going around and /ooc and group talk and I wasn't paying attention to my air meter.  LOADING......two corpses.  Same spot.  <br><br>I waited awhile and went back again.  Jumped in and began looting the first corpse.  For some bizarre reason Crush was still swimming in the moat and proceeding to beat on me.  Once again I couldn't get up the ladder.  LOADING......three corpses.  Same spot.<br><br>The good thing was the next time I went back D'Vinn's corpse was laying on the path.  Nobody was around, and I looted it.  Dragoon Dirk!  WOOT.  First half decent drop I got in EQ.  Looted my three corpses and I lived to fight another day.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ironhom Hammerforge<br>Paladin of Kaladim<br>Chivalric Order<br><br><br><br><br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ok, you all are gonna find this one funny as hell. I was in EW in guild chat tellin em whats going on as I am pulling and fear kiting Tundra Wooly Mammoths, one kill from making 47th lvl. <br><br>I shoot a lone mammoth and run back to coastline and sow drops. Well not paying attention I snare myself. I don't worry cuz I can snare and fear the mammoth. The only problem now is that the fear is being resisted 4 times in a row. Finally fear sticks and Im tearing up the mammoth but the third time the fear is resisted 4 times again. I am backing up and as you know the coastline in EW is cliff I fall for a total of 374dmg. As I climb my way up that mammoth is tearing me up for another 280dmg. I get back up and fear the mammoth by this time my health is below half with damage from falling and fear being resisted but I have mammoth below 1 bub so I say self we can come out on top. Well fear is resisted 2 times again. I am thinking damn I better run and sow myself. So I get distance back and SoW well as SoW lands his snare breaks and bam I get hit and stunned fall off the cliff again hehe Im below 1 bub of health.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I get fear off low on mana from dots and fearing cant cast heal. So I think to myself I should be able to kill it. I start tearing up as it breaks fear early and bam LOADING PLEASE WAIT comes up. As you know 46th is after a hell level.  Well you lose a ton of experience during that level. <br><br>While in Thurgadin I get a cool cleric that says drag ya corpse to GD zone and I will rez hehe 100pp later Im back killing not just one more tundra mammoth but end up having to kill 2 to get 47th finally.  My guild was laughing their butts off cuz despite myself I made 47th.<br>&nbsp;<br>Cannis 60th Ranger<br></td></tr>

THANK YOU ALL.....<br><br>Alas the whole reason I came up with this post is due to a friend ((Daxargen)) asking me what my most memorable death was due to my level. Trust me I have had may and every time I die I am pretty upset, but find the humor in it when it is brought up later on. Had another one happen to my cleric friend today.<br><br>We were hunting in Dawnshroud Peaks. I was playing my wifes Ranger and we were trying to level. Her to 33, the cleric to 32. Well we got him to DING to 32 and killed a white con to be safe. We went back into the little building to zone back over to Netherbian Liar. He and I were both OOM. Well someone decided not to yell or shout out that he was pulling three of those nasty little shrooms through to the zone. All I saw was Oh crap and I went LD. He got nailed by all three of em and lost a whole yellow bubble of health. He was laughing about it when I called him. He told me that is the 10th time that he has gotten level 32 and lost it. Guess level 30,35,40,45,50,55 are not the only h*ll levels......<br><br>Thank you all for reading this post and making me and my wife chuckle at some of your most memorable deaths...<br>&nbsp;<br>May Karana Bless You All,<br><br>Rauvin Darkfeather<br>Protector of the Great Storm and Follower of Karana</td></tr>

I have been offered Ubra Gear from them and they have tried to hook me up with that cool sword that is 1 HS and does 12 to 13 damage and only delays for 26, but I am a roleplayer at heart and love to quest for my gear. So without further ado.<br><br>Do you or are you twinked at this time and what are your thoughts on twinking?<br><br>Now my thoughts are I would rather have my guild or friends that I can group with go get that Ubra item cuz it is more memorable for me. If given the chance I say no whenever someone tries to give me an ubra weapon or hook me up with a lot of cool gear. To me it takes away from the game.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>No, I am not twinked, and very proud of it. Like you, I have turned down weapons and armor that I did not earn.<br>My problem with twinking is not when someone twinks a warrior, for example, but when they twink a class that takes an additional amount of skill, that's when things go downhill fast. <br><br>For example, take your typical twinked, PL'd ranger. A ranger's role changes drastically at least twice in the character's lifetime from 1 to 60. As Cannis mentioned when twinked, your character's skills will suffer, making your character a paper tiger...they will look tough, but their skills will not be able to live up to the look. Just as important, is that the person behind the keyboard's skills will not have had time to grow with the demands of the class.<br><br>A ranger who has not learned how to root-park, pull, gain and shed aggro, or kite properly is a ranger who will let his group down when those skills are required. It is those rangers who give all rangers a bad name.<br><br>That being said, not all twinks are unfamiliar with the class, or are not uber-twinks who did not have to learn to survive.<br><br><br>The following has nothing to do with being a ranger on Everquest:<br><br>As far as your addendum or how we should rate people, Rauvin, if someone expresses their opinion, that is their right. If that opinion contains bad advice, then I will rate it accordingly, that is my right. <br>It is a free country, but this board is a benign dictatorship. You and I signed away our American right to free speech when we joined the site, and agreed to follow Allakhazam's rules.<br>The purpose of this board is to &quot;Post your strategies on how to best play and develop the Ranger&quot;. People come here for advice, if that advice is flawed, or even worse, downright wrong, it is our duty to rate that mis-information poorly, so others who are looking for advice are not misled.<br>Sorry for the redirect, but I think it needed to be said with all the talk about &quot;ratings&quot; around here lately.<br><br>V<br>&nbsp;<br>True satisfaction can only be gained through the hunt.</td></tr>

I found after soloing most of the time from 15th till 24th level hurt me more as I did not truly know the what a ranger should or should not do in group. After 8 levels spent in groups I learned through trial and error what to do and not to do.<br>As for my progression from 32-47th I learn that role from message boards like this one, Rangers Glade and other high level Rangers I know and through personal experience. <br><br>For those soloing rangers out there remember to group because at higher levels in order to achieve the worthwhile rewards you will need groups to do it. Building friendships is what makes this game really worthwhile in my opinion and working well in groups is the most important skill you can develop.<br>&nbsp;<br>Cannis 60th Ranger<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Grouping seems to be the meat and potatoes of EverQuest. And getting a good group is essential to your non-frustrated, fast leveling, enjoyment of Everquest. So how does a ranger make him/herself appealing to groups? We aren't great healers, or tanks, and we certainly can't mez the mob. And most people consider us the accessory class, once you have tank, healer and crowd control? So how does the group seeking ranger make sure that s/he gets picked to go into that fifth or sixth slot? Simple. You be the best group member you can be. And here's how.<br><br>1. Offer to pull. Outside of the monk, you are the best puller your group can have. Have Harmony and Snare up. Harmony first, then Snare. If you have SoW on, run backwards to your group firing arrows at the mob all the way. Stop. Flame lick. Stop. Attack. Wait til the mob is at 1/4 health. Rinse. Repeat. And here's a hint. Use 3rd person view from behind with the camera panned about halfway back. That way, while running backwards, you can still see where you're going and any incomming adds. You'll have eyes in the back of your head! (Literally).<br>2. Know your buffs. Druids get almost every buff you can offer. EXCEPT Feet Like Cat. This is an AGI boost that helps everyone get hit less. Make sure it's on everybody. Shamans get it too, but they may be reserving their gems for other spells. Offer it. Chances are, people will want it. If you don't have a druid, keep Skin and a Damage Shield on the tanking members. And make sure everyone has STR on (chanter STR is best, but shaman's and druids have their own strength spells so ask first to save mana - yours OR theirs).<br>3. Keep good tabs on your aggro. You want to be lower than the warriors on the aggro list, but above the rogues and the casters. And know how to get your aggro up quickly if the mob turns on someone you want him to leave alone. Flame lick and Snare are major aggro uppers. Taunt works well if paired with poor faction.<br>4. Know how to use /assist. You -should- be the main puller, but if for some reason you aren't, keep your target on whoever's pulling and macro a key for /assist. What this does: It makes you auto-attack whatever the puller is attacking when you press the button. This makes life much easier for enchanters who are trying their hardest to mez one of the mobs, and can't find one that someone in the group isn't beating on. (Very frustrating).<br>5. Appreciate your healers!!!! You'd be very suprised how often healers get left out of the loot cycle because they're so busy staring at their spell books and making sure they have enough mana to save your ass when things turn ugly. If you notice your healer seems to be getting the short end of the stick, send him/her a tell and offer to loot for him/her and split on a regular basis. They -do- appreciate it! Remember, without your healer, you are quite seriously DEAD MEAT.<br>6. Use root. Got an add? Use root. Caster getting beaten on? Use root. Someone's running around in circles and everyone else is trying to yank to mob off him or her because that member is dying? Use root. Need to make some aggro fast? Use root. Need a head start while you run for the hills? Use root. Looking to break the chanter's mez on that last mob? Use root. Any questions?<br>7. In group tell, when you join and when any other group member joins, state plainly to the group. &quot;If you are a caster and something aggros on you....scream!&quot; And when it happens.....cause it will... drop EVERYTHING and see number 6. Use root and aggro that mob!<br>8. Remember that your death proves nothing. If you are getting smashed around, back off and let someone else take a little bit of the heat. Even a caster if need be. If the whole group is going down, you should be among the first to die. However, in a fight that could go either way, you are more useful to your group alive, maybe healing and firing off arrows, than as a smear on the turf. Remember that.<br>9. Maintain a positive attitude and a good outlook, and be helpful whereever you can. If something went terribly wrong and you died, instead of freaking out and screaming at your group, offer to bring them food and water from the local city. The right outlook can make all the difference. <br><br>And finally, something I highly recommend to everyone.<br><br>Start at least one character of every class, and play that class til level 10. If you don't have time for every class, try a cleric, a bard and an enchanter as top priority. Understanding the role that a class plays in a group is crucial to appreciating them as a group member. Maybe it seems that the cleric is whining about not getting enough loot, but until you've played a cleric, you don't realize how often they get left out. Maybe you don't understand why the enchanter keeps screaming &quot;Use /assist you bunch of morons!&quot; Play one til level 8 and you will understand. Bards just seem to work differently than any other class (and I've played them all) and that's why I recommend playing them too.<br><br>Good grouping, rangers!<br>&nbsp;<br>Lashara Dyran<br>Keeper of the wolves<br>Ranger of the 54th path<br>Lanys T'Vyl<br>"I just find the paths.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Cannis;<br><br>Here's why I disagree. First of all I write all my posts for people 30 or under, because I've never experienced 30+ so I can't speak. These people do not have SoW (unless they get it from someone else, and even then some mobs run insanely fast) so kiting multiple adds sets you up for a world of hurt. I find it much more efficient to root an add before it hits the party. That way he can't hurt anybody, and if you do have a chanter, he'll have an easier time putting a mez/charm on the thing.<br><br>On the snare pulling and why I recommend it. Well, firstly, I do mostly short pulls from smaller camps. I don't pull for very long distances. So the time difference between snare vs. no snare is minimal. Secondly, I find if you time your pulls right, the group never notices how long you take to get a mob to them because you're already luring the next one in by the time they've finished the first. And lastly, I have never had a group complain about my pulling methods, so I don't think they -hate- it. The bonus of being able to run backwards and fire arrows at the mob during your pull is two-fold. One, you are doing damage. (Always good). Secondly, you are continually working your Archery skill, which can be a bugger to get up. Never had a problem with the tank not being able to taunt him off me. In fact, the only problem I -have- encountered with snare pulling is the increased risk of a wandering mob aggro-ing because of wandering into your slower moving prey.<br><br>Other than that, it's all been gravy.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lashara Dyran<br>Keeper of the wolves<br>Ranger of the 54th path<br>Lanys T'Vyl<br>"I just find the paths.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ok I understand where your coming from now but I was going by your level. You have SoW so there is no need to snare pull once you have SoW. I hunted in Frontier Mountain, Overthere, Eastern Wastes and Dreadlands from 28th-45th respectively, these all being outdoor zones so I was designated puller. I found that the faster you pull the more the group wanted you. I would leave to pull at 1 bub from the mobs death to get another but if you have 4 groups in area pullin mobs tend to thin out quickly along with ks that can occur from a long pull.&nbsp;&nbsp;So my point is that snare is not a good way to pull post 30. You will be pulling from distances in those zones.<br><br>Once you get in Overthere, Dreadlands group you will find what the group demands of a chain puller.  As far as tank pulling agro you will find as I did that takes a while for the tank to build up enough agro to keep the mob off you its not so bad at lower levels but at higher levels pulling mob agro off you will get harder for tanks.  (CoM comes to mind here 49sk 51 monk and 45 rogue and me 42 ranger...Ranger gets beat down harmony/snare pulling...CH for Ranger CH for Ranger CH for ranger) I am of the belief that you form your habits early, I use to snare at beginnings or middle of fights and have moved to end of fight due to damage inflicted on me till tank could build agro.<br><br>Trust me on this one, your world is going to change radically over the next few levels. This where the techniques of agro control start to come into play.<br><br>As for kiting multiple adds I was assuming outdoor scenario with no enchanter and assuming more than one add. For 1-2 adds ghetto mez is perfectly viable way to take care of them its just when you have more than that I found kiting away from group is best for me, easy to do with SoW (practice archery) you can keep agro at will (flamelick/snare)and if things go bad the group can escape. The point being is that your group lives even if you do not, making ranger look like hero...therefore increasing our public image...which leads to /ooc Group looking for Ranger levels 30-35.<br><br>If I came across as attacking your post I apologize I sometimes don't state things in the most diplomatic way. I will try to do better in the future.<br>&nbsp;<br>Cannis 60th Ranger<br></td></tr>

I dislike Dark Elves when I am playing Rauvin, but I love playing my other Dark Elf characters. As for Rauvin I try to get good faction with all that I can and if your a D&amp;D addict I play him more choatic good then anything else. I love being the Pathfinder and finding new zones that no one is in late at night/ early morning and killing stuff. <br><br>Hope this helps you out Natric.<br>&nbsp;<br>May Karana Bless You All,<br><br>Rauvin Darkfeather<br>Protector of the Great Storm and Follower of Karana</td></tr>

Please do to him what I do to people in real life when they make fun of my problem and the way I talk and call me a retard.  I ignore them completely.  When I ignore them they cease to exist for me.  Even if they hit me and beat on me, I still ignore them.  They call me names and call me a coward, but they eventually do go away and most of them do not bother me again.  If you all ignore this person he has no power.  Post the things you normally post and let him continue his ranting stuff in a vacuum all by himself.  Nobody like to be ignored and I know this from my real life so it will work for you like it works for me.  He can rate my posts down too.  I can't care less because he can't do anything to me from his keyboard that's half as bad as real life people  already do to me everyday of my life.  Even my father called me a retard and said that I do stupid things, so he can't say anything to hurt me any more than that.  Haha.  I can laugh about it now because I'm already through crying about it.  I can take a joke now.  Just do whatever you guys want to do here and let him have his say.  Nothing he says changes the truth that you already know, does it?  Anyway, peace be upon you all.  I hope that my suggestion helps you all as much as the information you guys put here is helping me even though I may still not make a ranger it has been good reading anyway.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I am either playing one or the other anymore. Wormsloe good on you to do some research friend. Druids and Rangers are very unique in the EQ world nothing liek AD&amp;D or even D&amp;D ones, but alas I can say this I enjoy playing Rauvin and he is definetly the type of character you really have to work at.<br><br>So whichever you pick young friend and newbie to EQ make sure you enjoy the character to the fullest extent.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>You're right, but I think you're misunderstood me because I'm not bitter about being in my wheelchair.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm being real about that  What makes me sometimes angry is why I'm in this wheelchair and that is because I was stupid and at somewhere I wasn't supposed to be at in the first place.  That was at a party when I should've been in bed because I snuck out of my house to go to a party and we were smoking dope...marijuana, you know... and one of my friends made a joke about something but when I turned around to see what his joke was the gun he was joking with went off in my head in the back of my skull so I am paralyzed and I can still think and type with one hand and two good  right hand fingers like this but I can't talk like I used to.  People think I am a retard and I laugh real hard at funny stuff that other people just smile about and I can't just smile like them because I can't control myself when that happens.  I'm not bitter but I wanted TheShadowKinghtGod to know that his life is pretty good and he doesn't need to pick on other people like he does all the time when all I wanted for him was for him to do is find a friend somewhere to talk to so he would have some peace in his life instead of always coming here messing with people.  I think I said more than I wanted to say but I wanted you to know that I'll take what you said to heart like you said.  When I decide if I'll make a Ranger I'll be a champion for people who need help even Shadow Knights like TheShadowKnightGod I think and I think I will be a good Ranger if I do because I have learned alot of things about being a Ranger from all of you here like Cannis, Vindicarre, Mugali, and especially Lashara, too.  If I'm a Ranger I'll be quiet because I can't type fast but the game I think won't be different for me because the characters are a fantasyland things and we're all the same in there, right?  Just so you know I only rated you &quot;Good&quot; because you were misunderstanding me even if you didn't know it.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

But If you're like me and hate to turn loose of all that plat, may I suugest some &quot;Free&quot; ones that may work nicely?

Stats are 14ac 6 str 5 wis 5 cold 5 dis and 4wt. Check the link below for more info on these. The quest says level 45, but The earlier parts can be completed by about a 35ish player...but you will need a few 45 or better friends to take down the giant at the end of the quest. My self and druid wife got these and the quest is easy till the end. The darned Broodmother is like on a 12 hour spawn and bloodwolves are hard to come by (you can buy the Bloodwolf harness) and use a acid from Crystal Caverns in place of the Queen Drachnia Septre. <br><br><br>Check this site <a href="http://www.angelflame.com/ranger/kromrif.html" target=_new>http://www.angelflame.com/ranger/kromrif.html</a><br><br>Angel has a great Ranger site. Check it out and it's sure to be bookmarked as one of your favorites real soon as she has a lot of other Ranger quests outlined there too.<br><br>And if you really want to spend all that 12k you got laying around, just buy me a Tolans Bracer, because you'll still have all of it available after you finish the legs quest =)<br><br><br>Later<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Qzet Forestmyst<br>Warder of 60 scars<br>Proud Leader of the<br>Shroud Of Honor Guild<br>Fennin Ro<br>www.shroudofhonor.com<br>"Beauty is in the eye of the Swordholder"</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ok Tiras, first of all just because you get a bad rating doesnt mean others dont respect you anymore. Wether you are a scholar or not doesn't make your posts any better or worse.<br>Second, i wish you wouldnt take everything so personal. it's probably frustrating to see your rating go down but you dont have to start flaming us for it. Look at it this way: if you were a newbie ranger looking for some advice and you have to scroll trough half a page of peeps complaining because their rating went down would you look any further or would you give those post a good rating? this just scares (maybe talented) people away.<br>only thing that really sucks is if those flamers get your postingkarma down so you have to login under a different e-mail.<br><br>By the way, yes EQ is a Role Playing Game but that doesnt mean you have to hate all SKs.just depends on what role you play as a ranger. Evil races hate good races but nobody ever said Rangers are supposed to hate SKs. <br>anyway its not because they play an SK that they arent nice peeps outside EQ. If you want to attack somebody for playing an SK( or twinking,...) do it in EQ not on a strategy forum!<br>(Im an untwinked Ranger, only character. hope i live up to your high standarts)<br><br>Trash all my posts if you want,only 12, not much work.<br><br>To all other peeps: sorry about the long post full of useless info, please read on. lots of other good posts coming up.<br><br>Natric Silverstar<br>lvl 21 Woodelf Ranger<br>Antonius Bayle Server<br> <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well I have just acquired Swarmcaller, I was in Hate and let me tell you I didn't want agro, while up there. Pre Jolt levels 2hand weapons skills allow you to do damage without worry of pulling agro. Plus its a great feeling seeing that my damage output wasn't that far off from what I would do with dual wielding, I had some hits in the 120 range and personal high of 128 plus call of sky proc.&nbsp;&nbsp;Typically I was doubling for 140+ range.<br><br>As for the answer for the original poster, you will be heading into hell level soon thats when I found time to max all my weaponskills sans hth. Here is a good weapon suggestions for working 2hs and 2hb, pick up a Nathsar Greatsword fast 2hs and the Abandoned Orc Shovel for 2hb in Lake Rathe.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>It is never too late to learn any of your melee skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;Figuring out when to do it is the tricky part.  Carry each weapon class on you at all times (try to find the best DMG/SPEED combination you can) and swap out weapons when you can.  What I mean by when you can is determined by the situation.  If your on a massive raid or dungeon group, ask before you reduce your dmg capabilities that could affect your group.  In solid groups, you will find the opportunity.  As for why anyone would use a 2h weapon. AGRO!  Determine in your group who has the max HPs/AC ratio and of course they will the Main Tank (MT, It will rarely be you.)   Then do what you do best, pull according to exp ranking and then expect, no, demand the MT take the agro.  Now arises the problem.  When I 1HS, if it takes a good while before the agro is off, meaning I use up a lot of the healers mana to keep me alive.  When this becomes a recurring problem, switch to your 2HS/HB, you will still deal out comparable damage and, due to the delay time, reduce your agro and save mana in the long run.  Once again explain yourself at the start.  But if your still young, there are some good points mentioned above, but do yourself a favor and keep EVERYTHING maxed per lvl.<br><br>Marabelle the Ranger<br><br>E'Ci, Stop on By!<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Marabelle, The Sexy Rangerette!<br>Ssrena, Legionaire-Goddess of Cabilis!<br>Ssonia, Sexy Scaled Mystic of Cabilis</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ayrien,<br><br>To be blunt, no, you haven't missed the boat. I found that I did the same thing as you, at 29th level I started to listen to all the possibilities out there for 2hb (Woodsman's Staff, Nature's Wrath for ex.) that are underused beacuse no one trains in 2hb. Those weapons will out damage most people dual weilding!<br>So, I decided to take advantage of my hell level when I hit 30,and ran to Lake Rathe and picked up the sacred Abandoned Orc Shovel from the Orc camp there. It is free, and quick. Then I ran to Everfrost and fear kited Mammys using the shovel...it'll be slow killing, but with a quick 2hb weapon like the AOS, your skill will increase quickly.<br>On the other side of the 2 hander fence, the 2hs weapons out there are wonderful as well...Swarmcaller has been mentioned, and now that VI has increased the damage bonus on 2h weapons, you will see very nice hits that will outdamage your dual weilding until the late 30's.<br>Take advantage of another hell level (35) and swing away with your new 2hander.<br><br>A final thought, when you are dual weilding two decent weapons at higher levels, sometimes you gain too much aggro, and need to pull it back a notch...a nice twh hander will allow you to lose some aggro, and still do respectable damage.<br>&nbsp;<br>True satisfaction can only be gained through the hunt.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well here's whats up in my world. I trained my 1hs and pierce to the max and kept it up (im 48th now) and discovered theres some very nice weapons in the 2hs and 2hb fields as well. Right now Im using a Swarmcaller 2hs- stats like 29-40 I think and around level 45 it procs Tagars insects, a 29th level shammy spell that slows the attacker by roughly 40% when this baby goes off the enemy basically throws up its hands and says &quot;Ok....Kill Me&quot; I use this ALMOST exclusively now because of it's great proc. Really the only time I use my Wurm/Green Jade Broadsword combo is when I and my 51st level druid wife are hunting together when I need to put out a lot of damage quickly. Not to say that the Swarmcaller doesnt do a lot of damage because I hit consistently in the 80's with it and have hit a few times in the mid 120's and occasionally in the 100 pt range too but when grouping it's a great blade because you arent damaging more than the Main Tank (usually). (Str 160-180 depinding on buffs)<br><br>I would suggest you AT LEAST work on-1hs ,pierce, 2hs and 2hb, you'll find lots of different situations when you start getting to the higher levels that you'll find a need for a variety of weapons.<br><br>If we Rangers were a single faceted class...like tanks...we could get by with just 1 main weapon skill...and crush our way to victory time and time again. But....we are a support class with many different skills to bring to a group. So bring skills in as many weapon classes as you can and you will be more valuable to your group and able to adapt to the different situations you will face. So just grab the fastest weapon you can get your hand on and whack away and build those skills.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Tue Dec 18 16:38:06 2001</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Qzet Forestmyst<br>Warder of 60 scars<br>Proud Leader of the<br>Shroud Of Honor Guild<br>Fennin Ro<br>www.shroudofhonor.com<br>"Beauty is in the eye of the Swordholder"</td></tr>

Maybe someone has a grudge, but so what, just keep posting on-topic posts that add to the board. If you let yourself slip into making this a personal chat room, it could be ugly, because it takes away from the meaning of the board, and some die-hards out there WILL lower those posts, while others who would normally rate your posts well stop paying attention...and the moron does his usual thing...voila your rating goes down.<br><br>So, once again, chin-up and keep up the good strategy posts.<br><br>I apologize for the length and rambling, but that's my 2cp.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>True satisfaction can only be gained through the hunt.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I just read the interview of Brad McQuaid by Allakhazam.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the follow up posters mentioned their concern with Epics not being a test of someone's skill, but the skill of their guild.  I agree with that even though I've never been a part of any Epic yet... well, I did see a page that a the Enchanter needs, but anyway... there are several ways to look at this:<br><br>EverQuest isn't really designed to be a 100% solo game if you want the finer things, damn near impossible since most of them are no drop and can't be bought.  Epics don't really take all of the skills of a class into account when going after them.  All that's important is that the mobs are dead and the pieces are collected... until the next member of that class comes along.  To take down the mobs you need atleast a group.<br><br>I'd rather not rally the planar/velious armored guild members that 95% of already have epics and go porting around to get every piece.  Instead, I would like to be the way my class of choice is played... Ranger, Blade, and Bow stalking through forests, swimming in lakes, climbing mountains, and hunting... waiting... watching for the rarest of mobs and ground spawns that a Ranger in Epic range can solo and collect.  Tracking, Foraging, Fletching for months (decades in game) to get what I'm after.<br><br>But...<br><br>Back to the EQ Group-to-Get-the-Finest-Gear mentality.  Look at what you have... a small army of friends putting forth everything that they have so 1, not all, can benefit.  Both sound great to me.<br><br>What do you guys think about the way Epics are acheived?<br>&nbsp;<br>Blizzardeus Stormrayge<br>56th Epic Pathfinder of Karana<br>Rallos Zek - Temerity<br>www.temerityrz.org<br>Rangers Lead the Way!</td></tr>

I have noticed some guilds are set up for helping out their members with Epic weapons and some are set up for Raid's on the Planes and new zones. My guild unfortunately is a roleplaying guild first and foremost. Right now we have 30 players in the guild with most of their characters in the guild. So I am sure when it finally comes down to me getting my epic weapon (Swiftwind and Earthcaller) it will come down to me and my friends and the skill we have in getting the items. I believe that this is cool cuz then you and your friends can enjoy all the different things. I do not like the fact that we have to fight ubra mobs to get these items. Make it more like a quest so we can all enjoy it on a personal basis.<br><br>I do like the fact that Mr. McQuaid said that he likes playing Hybrids and Rangers in particular. I have this qeustion if he likes us so much then why are so not like the normal Rangers in most Roleplaying games??<br>&nbsp;<br>May Karana Bless You All,<br><br>Rauvin Darkfeather<br>Protector of the Great Storm and Follower of Karana</td></tr>

I want to hear from rangers who have done this, thats why I posted the question here.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ironhom Hammerforge<br>Paladin of Kaladim<br>Chivalric Order<br><br><br><br><br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I personally have helped do the wurm slayer quest 6 or 7 times.&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting the A scale and G scale are easy enough for a solid group in the mid 40's to 50 range.  The hardest part of the named wurm's is Azz's PH &lt;Gullerback&gt;  He pops several times in a row and you need to kill him each time to open it up for Azz to show.  We have killed Gullerback 6 times within an hour and no Azz.  Then we have killed him once and Azz is up.  Best place to setup is at the Fort and pull giants and keep tracking.  When one of the wurms or it's PH is on track tell the group and go pull it.  They usualy are a long pull.  I have tracking of 200 and can track most of the zone from the fort.  Setting up at dead hill limits my ability to find Azz.  He seems to spawn closer to the Chardok zone than my track will go.  Have to kill Entalon to get Glyton to pop.  All the wurm's hit in the 110 range and are pretty magic resistant.  They are slow as molassis though. They have a ton of hp's.  Gullerback hits a little harder and hits fast.  His lvl 52 version &lt;i think&gt; can summon.  Although he drops the tattered mantle a lot if not all the time.  A nice shoulder piece for the tanks helping you.  <br>The Z scale is easy enough.  Just get a darkie friend to go to OT and hand in the 2 carnelians to get the tektite from the Gargoyle named the same.  Then head to Temple Ro and give Lord Z the tektite and a Peridot for your Z scale.  Scales can be traded and are lore.<br>Then comes the fun part of turning in the scales to Fuzzim's.  He will not stand still, so you have to chase him while trying to turn in.  Also he will reject a trade if he starts to fight a mob.  I have had varying amounts of luck getting Sir Hobble to spawn, but hailing the Barbarian broad in the building with the brew barrel and then killing the Goblin Battlemaster that roams near the LoIO  and DL zone will definately speed up the process.  Longest it has taken me to get him to show was about an hour RL and I have got him in 5 minutes on 3 different ocassions.  Good luck with your quest!<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Alright, whatshisname wins.&nbsp;&nbsp;I log on this morning, post on why I like LOIO and some different areas to try there, and post is trashed.  Many other ranger posts are trashed.  At least we all did get together and bury whatshisnames rating so much that he doesn't appear anymore.  Although, you can switch your options to Never Filter and lower them further if you havent already.  This post will get trashed.  A RL friend who was rating my posts up (lol) said he cant keep up with it.  By the way, he started playing EQ because of the early ranger forum.  This should be trashed, since it has little to do with rangers.

Well if all of you do not know what we got hooked up with let me list some of the things under my re: <br><br>Hawk Eye, Falcon Eye, Eagle Eye: All Archery buffs increase distance and damage, plus the endless quiver when we get to level 51 and up. All I have to say is that it is about time. Right now I am using the Call of Sky effect on my weapons makes your weapons porc Call of Sky (knock back and 35 plus damage) hitting with this is very nice and I have had a blast using it up in Luclin. Well to all I have to agree with the Sage that started this post. All of you who post to this forum with good advice and help I salute each and everyone of you.
