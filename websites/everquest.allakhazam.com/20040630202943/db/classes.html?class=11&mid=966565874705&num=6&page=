You are the final resort.  You are the one who gets the kill.  Whatever you do, don't feel you have to blast away at the Mob just because the fighters are hitting away at it.  Nothing is more annoying in a group than waiting around for a wizard who is oom because he spent way too much mana making an easy kill.  Also, nothing is more annoying than a wizard who constantly draws the Mob to him because he cast too early and runs around yelling for help.<br><br>When your tank brings in a Mob, do a /assist.  Then sit down and start medding.  Watch the tank's hit point meter and the Mob's hit point meter.  If the tank gets in trouble, by all means get up and blast away to save his butt (unless you have a healer who can do it far better then you can).  Otherwise, wait until the Mob gets to half damage, and then get up and blast away at it.  Snag those that run away an kill them.  A good wizard will almost always get the groups kill.   As soon as the battle is over, sit and med again.  You can go whole battles without more than a glimpse at what you are fighting.<br><br>Yes, you will indeed spend most of each battle sitting on your butt.  That's your job.  You're a wizard.  If you're party doesn't understand, get a better group.  They probably don't know how to play anyways.  Ideally, you should spend the same amount of time medding for mana as the tanks spend sitting for hp.  If the group is waiting around for you to gain mana, then you are casting too much.  If you are sitting around waiting for them to heal, cast more often.  Adjust your tactics for your particular group.  A properly played wizard can easily double a group's effectiveness.  A poorly played wizard is just a liabilllity.<br><br>Da Wiz</p></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width="100%"><tr><td id=fs8></td><td align=right id=fs8 >6 Replies</td></tr></table></td></tr></table><tr><td>

There are a few criteria for this to hold true:<br><br>1.) You are level 35+ and have sit-med. This is important because you DO need to know exactly what the tanks bring in during multiple mob pulls. Simply knowing what they are currently attacking is not enough.<br><br>2.) You are not sitting in the pull path, or in multiple mob pulls you are not sitting close enough to aggro the additional mobs.<br><br>It takes some experience to get a feeling for just how close you can sit to a mob under various conditions, but this information is important so experiment with it. <br><br>- Melee'ing is mostly a waste of time at higher levels, even if you are at full mana. This is an individual call, and you need to decide if your melee output damage is really high enough to warrant using it. I really don't recommend non-spell fighting unless you have a weapon with an effect or a weapon that can cast a spell itself, such as the Soloist Icy Wand. Things to think about before melee'ing:<br><br>1.) Swinging = aggro. You don't even have to hit the mob. Anytime you swing at a mob you build on your aggro, even if it is only a small bit.<br><br>2.) You have to get close. Distance plays a factor in aggro, and if you have casted on the mob during the fight it may attack unexpectedly if you step into melee range. Also, if you get closer to the mob than the tanks (there just isn't "melee distance", but rather degrees of melee distance) it could also turn onto you.<br><br>3.) Your melee skills suck ;). While at lower levels you may be able to significantly contribute to a battle, you will find that this becomes less and less true as your character progresses. Ask yourself, would it be better if I melee'd or should I just cast a light nuke and sit to med briefly? Most of the time you will do more damage from a safer distance by just casting a lower level nuke and then sitting to med the little mana you used up.<br><br>- If you are not at full, MEDITATE! Recently I started a new character, and I can't tell you how much I hate to see a Cleric cast a heal, and then continue to stand around watching the battle like a newbie, which perhaps they are. Of course, a few more heals later they are "OOM" because they did not sit and med when they should have. What is a real killer is when they still don't med but instead jump in and try to help my SK melee...what I needed was a heal soon, not someone adding a pitiful amount of melee damage to my own ;). Mana = life blood, if you aren't full and there is nothing urgent to do then MED! :D<br><br>- I disagree with the original poster - getting the kill isn't your job, making sure the mob doesn't get away is your job. Sometimes this translates into over-nuking the mob as it nears its death, but that is far from the ideal solution. One of the responders already covered snare, and I'd like to expand on that topic. As a mob loses hitpoints it weakens, and if it gets really low on hitpoints its movement slows to a crawl, sometimes even a stop, particularly if it is snared. Your job then, is to nuke it to death with a minimum of over-kill (within 50 damage or so) or to hurt it bad enough to bring it down to "crawl" speed. The tanks should then be merrily slashing and bashing it in the back, bringing it down before it can get far at all (meanwhile you have gone back to medding, right?) :D. In dungeons with tight corners it may be necessary to over-nuke the mob, however, as two steps may be all it needs to round the corner for friends :(. The one thing you really want to beware is nuking it hard enough to make it run, but not hard enough to slow it to a crawl. This is a very, VERY bad scenario. Luckily it is controllable with experience - know how much your nukes do, know how much it will take off the mob's life bar, and have different "sized" nukes memmed for different situation (a big nuke and a small nuke). A good wizard should be able to visualize how much his nuke will take off the mob's hitpoint bar and account for the damage that will be done by the other players before ever casting his spell. This is really important - perhaps you know this mob will run at half health, and your nuke will only bring it to 55% health, but you MUST account for the damage done by others during your casting or you may suddenly find the mob down to 45% health instead of the predicted 55%, and running like mad down the corridor to get friends :O. I speak from experience ;).<br><br>- Area Effect spells need their own thread...actually, they need several ;).
