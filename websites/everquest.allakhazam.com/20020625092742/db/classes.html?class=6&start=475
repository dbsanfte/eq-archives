	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hello Everybody, to summorize this post, it will hopefully be a long one, it will be about making cash for the first 20 levels or your EQ Life, this will work for almost any class(tanks preferably-bards best), but may require some traveling from where you are. I am writing this guide to help all of you young players out there who want that nice weapon of so bad, but can't figure out how to get it with minimal work. Well, i have played every single class to level 10 at least, and needless to say, this WORKS. So, here it is, your referencial guide on the DO's and DONT's of making money-Part 1.<br><br>Section 1. Starting Zones.<br> Ok this is about starting zones in my opinion. These will be ranked from 1-3, 1 being the best in terms of cash flow from there. THESE ARE ZONES THAT ARE REALLY FROM 1-5 WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS.<br><br>1. Paineel.-In my experience, this is crazy cash flow if you know how to do it. I started out here just hunting Decaying Skellies and gathering all my bone chips. You may not get to sell em here, but if you do, People from the Hole will gladly pay 10pp per stack! I made about 250pp in levels 1-5 here. Unparalled in cash for those levels.<br><br>2. EverFrost.-INCREDIBLE place to begin for cash making. Plenty of Skellies around for bone Chips-even though they only sell 3pp a stack here. Polar Bears of any type drop HQ Bear Pelts uncommonly but they sell for 30pp a pop. At leve; 10 from hunting just Skellies and Bears i had about 250pp and i bought a weapon worth 100pp for my shammy.<br><br>3. Greater Faydark.-Incredible place to start out in. You can get to 9 just hunting Orcs here with a TON of cash making involved. Even though i recommend going to ButcherBlock first and gathering up exp in there till 6 where you can hunt Orc Centaurions for their belts which sell for 1pp each. If you do this till level 9 you should have about 300pp from belts alone.<br><br>Section 2. Starting Suggestions of Money Making(1-5).<br> First off, if are not KoS in these starting places, i suggest you make the journey over to one of them and hunt there till you feel you have outgrown the zone. Without Further Adue-how to make money levels 1-5.<br><br>1. Kill every single Decaying Skeleton you can find. Save their bone chips and DO NOT sell them to the merchants. Save them up until you see someone auctioning to buy them. Charge 3-6pp per stack unless a high lvl necro or other class is buying them, then ask them if they wouldnt mind paying 1-3pp extra per stack. <br><br>2. If your Zone has bears that are killable at earlier levels, Kill every single bear you can find-green or not. If they drop LQ/MQ pelts, sell them to merchants. If they drop HQ Bear pelts, save those up until someone wants to buy em, then sell those to them for 30pp per pelt.<br><br>3. Find Skellies with Weapons. Besides killing every skelly you find, if they have a weapon loot it and sell it to those merchants. Some weapons go for 2 gold. Those add up.<br><br>4. Kill Bats. Save up their batwings and sell them to people who wanna buy them. 2pp per stack is the norm.<br><br>5. Kill EVERYTHING that moves and loot EVERYTHING. sell stuff that wont sell to other people to merchants. This is an ok way that is somewhat quick and nets you the most exp, but not as much cash.<br><br>Section 3. How to make money. (9-15)<br> In this section i will tell you the secrets of making money that will supply you with your equip to level 30 in most cases.<br><br>1. MOVE TO EAST COMMONS, or EVERFROST. These are 2 of the safest, BEST places for cash at these levels.<br><br>2. THE Money Making guide. First off, you need to know how to play your character to survive this, as it will be trying your skills and will teach you how to play efficiently. Thta said, the first thing you should do if make your way out to the tunnel and ask for a SoW, and some hp buffs. Usually a nice neighboorhood druid will come around around and buff you extremely well. Then what you wanna do is go over to Orc 1. DO NOT GET IN A GROUP HERE. <br> Ok, what you do is run around and find either a black bear, a Young Kodiak that doesnt con red, or a willowisp that doesnt con red. To kill wisps, you need a magical weapon. If you are a tank class and have some pp, buy either an Axe of the Iron Back(2hs) for 30pp or something like a PGT(1hs)for 50pp-100pp. Anyways with buffs you should be able to take these down. Save every single Greater Lightstone you get for further use. If you happen to get a HQ bear Pelt, sell it for 30pp. At any rate, you should get around 2 bear pelts at level 9 since the YKs con high yellow-red and give loads of exp, and about 4-6 every level after. At 10 you should be able to take down YKs and Wisps very easily really, and you should get a good amount of money for these. Also, if you want more GLSs or just more things to kill with a bit higher risk, go over to West Commons-ill explain later. You should hunt in East Commons until 12 and by then you should have amassed around 600pp if you do this right and don't spend anything which is highly doubtable. Anyways at levels 11/12-15 you should most definatly hunt in West Commons. The area you want to go to is from the tollbooth to the Inn where the tonsmiths are. I nicknamed this spot Wisp Highway. Almost every Wisp in the zone comes through this area which means that your exp should be movin and your backpacks should be filling up with GLSs. Also, be careful since the guards at the booth wont kill Wisps so dont get more than 2 on you unless you are around level 14. YKs and Black Bears sometimes wander through here which makes getting money on the spot a little bit easier but you are not getting as much since Wisps are your primary exp source atm. At 15 some Wisps are starting to green out along with YKs. Time to move on out. This is gonna be why you saved your GLSs, and youll thank me too.(Note on EverFrost-Just do everything here cept just kill Polar Bears and Mammoth Calves or whatever cons near your level.)<br><br>Section 4. How to Make Money.(15-20)<br>Well, pack up your backpacks full of Greater Lightstones and head on down to Oasis of Marr. Many people critisize this zone for being overused and frankly, it is. But who cares when this is crazy exp and some of the best money for these levels too. First off, go over to the Gypsy camp and head on over to Synthia or some gypsy named like that. Pay one person some pp to hold a bag for a bit for you at the Gypsy camp. Then turn in the Greater Lightstones one by one to her, each time getting a container which sells for 7-10pp to her. keep doing this and then ask for your bag back from the dude and keep doing this with all your GLSs. After doing this run back to your bank in FP or wherever you bank, and turn in your money. I made 800pp just off of Wisp hunting in 6 levels using this strategy. Then either head on over to HighPass and get in an Orc or Gnoll group for nice loots and ok exp, or go back to Oasis and get in Orc Highway groups over there. Either way you should get a fair amount of money in those 5 levels-around 400pp really. HighPass is better for loot, Oasis is for exp. Either way you can still make your way into level 20 with MUNDO plat for your level.<br><br>Section 5. Alternative Money Making.(Smithing)<br> One more way which you should do if you are a tank, is start smithing at level 20. Use all of your money on smithing and you should be making banded and maybe a couple of peices of Fine Plate Armor. Not too bad considering some FP peices sell for 100pp normally. You can lose all of your money on smithing just to gain it back from FP armor, plus you can supply yourself with money without hunting and armor for a long time to come.<br><br>And now i come to an end of writing this post as a guide as many people have asked on boards like this one how to get money to buy nice stuff early on. Thank you all for reading this through and i hope it helps.<br><br>Zomor Soulsaver<br>Champions of Brell-51st Season<br>"Thunder is impressive, but Lightning gets the job done."<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Greetings fellow Paladins,<br><br>The news we have been waiting for is now posted on Everquest.com in the Developer's Corner.&nbsp;&nbsp;It appers that the Knight classes stand to benefit more than any other classes by the new MELEE CHANGES that have been on the test server for a while.<br><br>Just a quick summary:<br><br>Paladins stand to improve their melee damage output by approximately 50% over former levels. We were at "about" 50% of a warrior's damage. We will not be at "about" 75% of a warrior's damage!<br><br>There are also significant upgrades to 2-hs weapons. Since those are Paladin mainstays, we should benefit from the 2-hs damage increases as well.  <br><br>We also get a TAUNT upgrade AND get moved to the Warrior's Damage Table.<br><br>It's all very interesting. I have included specific parts from the official post that are applicable to Paladins. The overall post is lengthy.<br><br>***********************************************<br><br>Hello all, <br><br>It's been a while since I stopped by the corner to chat with everyone. Today I'm pleased to announce the specifics of the combat system enhancements mentioned last week. The changes described in the document below represent weeks of work by the team to define and quantify the issues facing players, particularly those level 51 and above. Suffice it to say that through the use of our new, highly robust combat simulation engine we've found a number of problems present that we're happy to address. <br><br>It is very important to that everyone know that these changes came about through a complete team effort, though special thanks goes out to our newest game designer, Rich Waters, who helped to pull them together and authored much of the document below. <br><br>Enjoy the read! <br><br>Gordon Wrinn<br>Associate Producer<br>EverQuest Live and Expansions<br>Sony Online Entertainment <br><br>----------SNIP---------- <br><br>ABOUT THE CHANGES IN GENERAL--- <br><br>It is very important to us that our players understand our goals when making these changes. First and foremost, our goal is NOT to make any particular high-level encounter easier, nor the game easier as a whole. Our goal is that the group makeup at those high-level encounters become more diverse, with more classes, ideally all of them, feeling that they can contribute meaningfully to most encounters. Obviously there will always be some encounters where a particular classes utility should be greatly negated, but those should be the exception and included as a matter of story, rather than the rule. <br><br>MELEE SYSTEM CHANGES--- <br><br>After extensive research, testing, and evaluation we have completed the melee portion of our class balancing. To be clear, these changes apply just to the combat aspect of melee classes. <br>Here are the results of our melee combat balancing, and the solutions we are including in this patch. <br><br>Two-Handed Weapons- <br><br>We are making changes to two-handed weapons to increase their damage output and desirability. As many of you know, two-handed weapons are not doing comparable damage to dual wielded single-handed weapons. This problem really manifests itself in the high end game. Before level 50, two-handed weapons perform fairly well. The following two-handed weapon change applies to characters level 51 and higher. <br><br>Two-handed weapons currently receive a damage bonus based on the delay of the weapon. Slower weapons swing less often, but hit harder when they connect. We have increased this damage bonus significantly over what it used to be. This increase in the damage bonus improves the damage potential of all existing two-handed weapons. Up through epic level weapons, the damage bonus alone makes two-handers a very viable choice for melee classes. <br><br>Along with the damage bonus enhancement, certain post-epic quality two-handers are being upgraded. The quality of these weapons did not improve enough when compared to the difficulty of encounters, and the rate at which one-handed weapons improved. These retroactive two-handed weapon upgrades are included in this patch. <br><br>To help you in selecting which two-handed weapons you want to use, we are giving a new piece of information when you inspect a two-handed weapon...the Damage Bonus. This damage bonus is the number of extra damage points that are added to each hit, based on the weapon delay. <br><br>*Please note- when combined with the damage bonus change, only the very highest quality weapons needed a stat improvement as well. <br><br>SPECIFIC CLASS CHANGES-<br><br><b>-Paladins and Shadowknights-</b> <br><br>The Knight classes receive some of the biggest benefits from this melee balancing. Our evaluation of knights showed that in many cases they were doing just over half the damage of a similarly equipped warrior. This is simply not enough damage to make them highly desirable in group and raid situations. The changes we are implementing put knights at a bit over three-quarters of the damage potential of a ranger or a warrior. This represents a significant upgrade from their current status, without threatening the desirability of the ranger or warrior classes. <br><br>The first thing we did was to move knights to the same damage tables as warriors. This damage table is now shared by all melee classes, except the monk who is on the higher tables described above. By placing knights on this table, they will now hit harder with the same weapons than they did previously. <br><br>The second change that greatly benefits knight classes is the upgrade to two-handed weapons. While this isn't a knight only upgrade, as the premier users of two-handed weapons it has a profound effect on their damage potential. The two-handed weapon upgrade is discussed in more detail in the previous section. <br><br>For knights that prefer to use a weapon and shield combo, we plan to go through existing weapons available in the game and upgrade them in cases where they are not doing enough damage. These upgrades, as well as any new weapons we may add, will begin to be seen in game in the near future. One thing to note- a knight using a two-handed weapon will do more damage than a knight with weapon and shield of similar quality. <br><br>The final change we are making to knights is the increase of their Taunt skill cap. This increase begins at level 51, increasing a few points each level until it caps at 220 skill. Taunt still follows all the previous rules with regard to taunting things above your level. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I normally play SK's but I decided to change a bit.. So I packed up my Harm touch... and went looking for a new race... and a new class. I liked the hybrid aspect so I decided I would be my opposite, a paladin. At first I chose a human.. just because coming from a AD&D backround other races cannot become paladins. I hated her. She wasn't a tank like the SK and she moved in levels so slow. So I packed up my lay hands and was going to move on.., but I stumbled upon an idea. I quickly dove into create character, and began my work on my new Paladine. I created a char to be remembered. An erudite Paladine. I knew it would be tough, but he has so much personality. They all say he can't hack it. Well.. soloing at te warrens He is now lvl 7... in two 4 hour gaming sessions. He is 7. He gains his 2hs rather well too. So any of you who think about making an Erudite, go for it. they are fun, and they gain well...

	   <tr><td colspan=2>In response to this dudes hopefully RPing post, i would like to point out why paladins are THE best dueling tank class on par with monks.<br><br>1.Root-if you try to kite us, we can root you and catch up to you and commence the beating.<br>2.Healing-If you get us down past 50% hp by Kiting(VERY unlikely), we can just stop running and heal ourselves back to full.<br>3.Flash of Light-if you can't see, you can't do ANYTHING cept run around, basically our best Dueling spell.<br>4.Stuns-with new SoL spells out, we will have 3 stuns at level 30. Those are for interruption then Holy Might at 51 for stun with damage.<br>5.Cancel Magic-we can cancel your sticky DoT spells easily. And debuff you of your own buffs whatever they might be.<br>6.DW Helm-Post 45, we can heal ourselves without mana consupmtion.<br>7.Bash-We can stun you with bash and interrupt your spells in close range combat too if using a 1hander.<br>8.Lay On Hands-You know, life saver, better than your HT too, since your HT will prolly only do like 45% damage too us, we win in special skills category.<br>9.YOUR PETS SUCK-they will never be able to hit us if we are the same level as you.<br>10.Face the Facts, SKs need to be higher level than paladins to get the job done. We can do everything you cant-no offense intended.<br><br>There is the truth about paladins really 35+ in Dueling. Hope this helps you Paladins having trouble with the neighboorhood SK.<br><br>Zomor Soulsaver<br>Champion of Brell-51st season<br>"Thunder is impressive, but Lightning gets the job done."<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hello. I just wanted to say, first of all, paladins ARE melee fighters. This is the problem with today's people. Most have been brainwashed into believing that they are "hybrids" and not "tanks." Well, you see, that is the POINT of a paladin. Paladins (and I'm not saying they do the most dmg) are THE tankers. So they may not be "melee fighters," but they sure as heck ARE "fighters." Us pallys are MEANT to be BUILT as a TANK rather than a "caster." They may be able to cast spells, but that doesn't mean that's something to build on. Paladins may be built as strong as warriors and as tough as them if only they follow the way of a warrior. Then they must believe that they're spell casting is an extra and almost pretend like they CAN'T give themselves more wis and such. IMO, we ARE the tanks of EQ.... When was the last time that group pulled a train and the WARRIOR stuck in there, got everything on him, then headed to zone and LIVED EVERY TIME! You've never seen that. Pallys (thanks to Lay Hands) are group savers. They're the ones that are meant to stay behind and take the dmg for the group. Paladins are excellent at soloing fyi also. Better than warriors, and sadly im not too sure about rangers or SK's. All you gotta do is pretend you are a warrior, go in there, fight till yer low on health, Root that bugger, back up and heal. And, if it happens to be that one hard guy and u just can't get him rooted... LAY HANDS!!! Ok, the other thing I wanted to add, is that I'm a 33 pally, and I have leveled up NO slower at all than my 34 druid. In fact, my 26 enchanter seems to be the "slow" leveler. Paladins do not seem to have an "exp restriction" whatsoever no matter what anyone says. Young paladins should not be discouraged by this statement that we gain exp slower. Because if it's true which i'm not sure... you DON'T notice it. If in fact it's true that u've never seen a dwarf pally, I suggest you change servers, cause if everyone's that dumb to make any other race paladin, you do NOT wanna be grouped with the people on that server. Those are the people who end up getting to 30 and deleting their pally. The majority of the higher level pallys ARE dwarfs, because only as a dwarf can one realize the true power of a pally. <br><br>Btw... what makes you think Freeport and Qeynos are the main paladin guilds? In my opinion, they're no different or WORSE than the kaladim pally guild. I love that place. Ok well if there's anything you would like to say in response to this, please respond.... I would love to argue about pallys!

Don't get discouraged when that warrior you're grouped with is showing off his wurmslayer at level 9! But without you, he would be dogmeat! (this "note" is pointing out the 'Lay Hands!'")<br>~Paladins are the ones who shorten that downtime. Can a warrior heal himself to save the cleric some mana? And can the ranger you see take near as much dmg? (plus rangers cant heal as well for a while)<br>~Dual weild... ok, it's a nice ability... but your DOUBLE ATTACK is also almost as nice. Especially when you raise it so high it happens like every time! (Kind of like dual weilding a 2HS weapon)<br>~Ok, Shadowknights may be able to tank as well, but in a group, shadowknights are not near as good. (Although I've never been a Shadowknight... they DO seem the best tanking class next to paladins... in fact it could be hard for me to argue why paladins are better than them... although i KNOW I'd win=)<br>~Plus, I know this will be a while... but what TANKING class gets that 90% ressurection again?<br>~Wow... rangers can sow!!! (sarcastically said) Who NEEDS to cast sow? It's a nice thing, but between groups and the million other people that play... honestly it's not exactly hard to get one.<br><br>I'm sure there's MANY more points i missed, but that next time that darn warrior or ranger in particular show off their stuff, and their dual weild, and all that crap... Don't be disappointed with who you are. If you DO get disappointed, you do not have the heart to be a paladin.<br><br>Ok, now, to help some of you out with "what to buy!"<br><br>1. from levels 1-20<br>~I REALLY suggest getting the following items!<br>~Axe of the Iron Back 50pp(dmg 20 dly 32 magical 2HS)... buy this from other players of course.... Many People seem to sell these, but your BEST chance would be North Freeport)<br>~BANDED armor! (you do not NECESSARILY need bronze... it's rather expensive and weighs a lot)<br>This stuff goes for 1pp per AC (buy from other players, not from NPCS!!!!<br>~If u happen to strike a gold mine... silver OR platinum ruby veils (and if you're REALLLYYY rich a velium ruby veil) are nice. These items give:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;  4str,4wis=Silver<br>    7str,7wis=Platinum<br>    8str,8wis=Velium<br>~Another item if you're closer to 20 and rich that's nice costs 150pp or so depending on server is a "Skull Shaped Barbute." This helmet is excellent.<br>~So if you are not RICH... get banded armor... and if somehow you can get 50pp, get that axe.<br>~Ok, once you hit 20... axe of the iron back is still fine, but your damage cap has now came off.<br>IF possible, there are some really nice sword upgrades such as BABS or Mith 2-Hander you may wanna try to get... (range:500pp-1500pp) <br><br>Ok, now, im sure your wondering (if yer a newb) how do I get this money?!<br>~levels 1-7= Go to basically ANY newbie zone.... there are many places to go, but personally, I stayed in Butcherblock Mountains. If you hunt there... Fight the regular stuff out front until lev 4.... Then you can group for gobs or other stuff by the Crossroads till 5/6.... Once you hit 5 or 6 tho, GO TO THE DRUID RING! There are about 5 skellys at the camp there, and you can fight one WITHOUT any of the others aggroing! It's excellent exp and you get BONE CHIPS which sell like hotcakes in that zone. On top of that, there are many high level druids that gate to Butcherblock druid ring, and they will UBER buff you if you're fighting there normally without you even asking. <br>~Once you hit about 7 at those skellys, it's probably about time to move. I suggest getting on that boat, ride to Antonica, run from Freeport to EC to WC, through kithicor, through RIvervale (city of the halflings) and over to Misty THicket. There is an orc camp there. This orc camp is not normally camped, and there are 2 orcs at this camp. If you are still lv 7, you will need to group to fight these, but at 9/10 u can solo them until 12. The reason i suggest this camp is because the orcs there drop Deathfist Belts which can be turned in in Freeport for GREAT exp!!! Or sold for 2-3pp EACH!!!!! This is a good way to make money and ok exp. Once you hit 11/12 and are sick of that place... go turn in your deathfist belts and head over to WC. In WC, hunt Willowisps until 12/13 for exp and GREATER LIGHTSTONES! You can turn these in out in NK for like 9pp.... Another good way to make some money!<br>~At level 12/13/14... head over to Oasis of Marr. There, group at ORC ALLEY! This is UNBELIEVABLE exp! just watch out for Sand Giants! Fight there till lv 17-19 and then head over to one of two places. Lake of Ill Omen (if you do not get disconnected a lot and great exp) or Highhold pass (if you get disconnected a lot and want ok exp and great loot). If u want to know more, respond to this post. I don't wanna type what I don't have to. <br><br>Ok, well, that's it folks... and I hope this helps some newbie. If you have any questions, just respond to this post.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>okie dokey) hiya, first of all, at yer level, u cant really fight anything for a decent magical weapon.... Your best bet is to buy an "Axe of the Iron Back." This is a dmg 16 dly 32 magical 2HS weapon that is just AWESOME! It used to go for 100pp, but on Drinal at least... it goes for 40-50pp (normally 50). GET THIS WEAPON!!! (and then if u get a lot of money, get a better weapon at lv 20 when your dmg cap comes off.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Secondly, these people asking whether or not they should upgrade to Fine Steel armor at lv 12 are most likely twinked. At lv 12 though, you may want to put money aside for banded armor. (Bronze is a bit better, but really expensive... plus it weighs a lot) Banded will cost you 1pp per AC. Btw, once you reach level 16 or so... you can hunt the orcs in Highhold Pass (off of Kithicor Forest on the continent of Antonica)... these orcs drop Ringmail armor in which weighs about the same as banded, but has a little less AC. Although not as good as banded, if you have no money, you can wear this instead. Plus, it sells to vendors for 1-2pp each piece and they're fairly common drops.<br>      Lastly, I am not a blacksmith so I can't help you too much although I can advise one thing. If you have a caster (whether they have high wis or int) I suggest you use them for smithing instead. Wisdom dictates when doing a trade skill how much you fail/succeed, where INT controls how fast your skill rises. A paladin has OK wisdom, but not exactly enough to be that successful at smithing. It is possible, and if you want go ahead and do this. I am just <br>suggesting this will cost you more money. I have HEARD tho, that Freeport (again on Antonica and city of the humans along with Qeynos) is a GREAT place to start smithing. I cannot guarantee this is true, but most likely it is. Freeport is a great place for people to begin a skill. Also btw, u may wanna consider taking up Fletching. This is the skill of making bows and arrows. These arrows will become useful to you, it's not too expensive of a skill to learn, and they can sell pretty well when you reach a higher level.<br><br>Well that's my 2 platinum and I hope it helps cause it sure took me a while to type. <br><br>Gfuais Palais &lt;The Elderblood&gt;<br>Dwarven Paladin of the 33rd season<br>Drinal Server<br><br>aka<br><br>Uaieo Aieou &lt;The Elderblood&gt;<br>High Elven Enchanter of the 26th season<br>Drinal Server<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I currently have both a DwarvenMace and a Broadsword.  Both Skills were maxxed out at L11.  I just made L12, so have not had a chance to max them both at 12.  My questions is if anyone knows where a L12 paladin can solo to get some magical weapons (near to Freeport area would be best as I am currently in North Ro).  If  need to buy them, I only have 50Plat.<br><br>2.  I am also currently wearing only Leather Armor and see many discussions here about other Paladins around my level asking if they should be upgrading to Fine Steel armor.  My question on this topic is where does a low-level paladin get the money to purchase (or where does he find) Fine Steel Plate Armor.  I have looked at the shops in Kaladim and all the prices are around 200-300 Plat per piece.<br><br>3.  I have chosen to pursue Blacksmithing as a Trade skill and would like some advice on when I should start working on that skill.<br><br><br>Trystam<br>L12 Dwarven Paladin<br>Charter Member:  Chaos Engine Guild<br>Innoruuk Server<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>If you are currently sporting leather armour, then a good upgrade is to "/auction WTB Banded Armour, size small" It should sell for 1pp per ac, is player made & will serve you very well as you upgrade from banded to bronze(which is dropped off critters), then fs plate (which is again player made)and then finally around level 30+ you will be picking up ( from killing critters like the undead knight in unrest, some magical armour like Bloodstained Mantle or bp) or buying it in /auction mode. <br>I always keep auction open, in case i see a good weapon or piece of armour that is an upgrade for me, that i can afford.<br>I think i went from leather to ringmail or chainmail, then when i learned about banded i regretted getting the mail. Banded is cheaper , lighter & higher ac .<br>High level smiths do not like to make banded arfmour, for young players because it is not profitable & takes a lot of time. Unless you befreind a high level smith , or your guild has a few. <br>Work your smithy skill, when you have lots of excess plat. If you find yourself with lots of time & little cash. you can still work it up the hard way, just check out the guidlines that are available. There are a few really good ones that tell you the cheap way to raise skill that takes tons of time, and the fast way to skill up that takes lots of plat. Good luck. I stopped smithing at skill 180 because the i just lost too much plat making fs plate, altho there was a time that I made a small fortune at it. (I changed my armour & stats & my fail rate increased substatially)<br>Player made fs plate generally sells for 10pp per ac for 1 sheet items. Aface plate is say 60pp , 2 sheet items sell for 130pp + And 3 sheet items sell for 200pp+. I used to sell fs plate bp for 250pp, legs 225pp cloak 225pp.<br>With my current armour configuration, I have failed 15 out the last 18 attempts at making 2 & 3 sheet items, so naturally i am not doing much smithing these days. I will again some day as I have 3 earthen tempers in the bank & i really want to make some dwarven cultural armor some day!<br>Hope this was helpful & answered some of your questions!<br>Torsk Holynite, Ad Gloriam<br>Dwarf Paladin of the 50th Season<br>Lanys T'Vyl<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

You can pick up a mostly full suit of Banded or Bronze armor for what cash you have.  I suggest that for a good while, until your 30s possibly in Bronze.  At that point you can invest in fine plate, or if you have high level friends you could possibly head to Icewell Keep to get some extra Royal Velium Frosted Armor.  Fine plate can be bought from player blacksmiths with over 175 skill.<br><br>3. You may have the spare cash to start smithing anywhere from level 20 to level 35.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Dear All,<br><br>Some info on damage for discussion / dismissal:<br><br>Strength effects three main areas; the load one may carry without being encumbered, the ATK (or attack) rating and finally the 'range' or 'bandwidth' of damage inflicted on a successful hit.<br><br>ATK consists of three things: STR, Offense and a weapon skill. Since Offense and the cap (or peak) for weapon skill is directly related to level, you can summarise this by saying 'level is a great determinant of success in combat'. But then we all knew that already! :-)<br><br>Thus, in order to hit a mob, a calculation based on a characters ATK vs a mobs AC is performed.<br><br>However, when selecting equipment, for your early stages of life (levels 1 - 30) you should focus on AC, STR then hps. Past 30th and one should begin to consider AC, hps then STR as those you group with are able to cast better STR buffs.<br><br>Post 46, and every raid-worthy paladin should start picking up resist gear. A dragon who wants to hit you, WILL hit you no matter your AC. However, having that 150 resist fire will protect you from that terrible 500dmg AoE spell...<br><br>Other stats have less of an impact, but are still important nonetheless. AGI should ALWAYS and MUST be over 75. Having an AGI of 100 is ideal but not essential. If your AGI drops below 75 you will notice a massive deficiency of AC. NEVER let your AGI go below 75. AGI is also the key stat for improvement of defensive combat skills (eg Dodge, Parry)<br><br>DEX is a well-discussed topic. As far as tests have proven, DEX is a direct factor of causing critical hits, improvement of offensive combat skills (incl. riposte, disarm, bash, kick) and the rate of weapon 'proc'.<br><br>STA is well-disputed also. Having STA over 100 will negate any effect of your 'yellow stamina bar' if it fades to nothing. STA directly impacts hps, although at low levels the effect is minimised. Young pallies are encouraged to go for +hp gear, rather than +STA gear until around level 30. One observation not often noticed by many, is that having a high STA effects how likely you're stunned by a physical Bash / Slam from a mob.<br><br>Melee classes receive a damage bonus based on level.<br><br>This can be calculated approximately using this formula for characters up to 50:<br><br>(character level - 25) / 3 <br><br>and rounded down<br><br>Thus, a 31st level char will receive a bonus of 2 damage with every hit that connects.<br><br>A 50th level char will receive a bonus of 8 damage per hit that connects.<br><br>As you can see, the lower the delay of a weapon, the more damage you will inflict. This is why dual-wielding classes with low delay weapons, often take the Taunt and favour using the 1H-type weapons at later levels.<br><br>Of course pallys have great agro-management tools, in the form of Stuns, Roots, undead Fears and even Flash of Light.<br><br>The upcoming melee changes on Test feature an increased minimum damage for 2H weapons. Currently, 2H weapons receive a damage bonus based on their delay. It's suspected that this is 1 point for every 2 delay past 30, although this is unconfirmed.<br><br>Good luck with your travels, friends.<br><br>Leolus<br>Paladin of Quellious<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>As my addition for those who haven't read it, here's a post I made about a year ago regarding specific damage calculations.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a few days this will all mean nothing and I get to recalculate everything, but for today's info:<br><br><br><br>Most younger paladins, and a lot of people still believe that damage/delay is the way to calculate weapon efficiency.  Not only is this 100% <b>wrong</b>, it is extremely misleading to people of other classes who will claim, "ur class roxX0rz cuz u have firey avengur."<br><br>The purpose of this post is to dispel any of those myths about damage calculation, so we can figure out exactly how we do damage.<br><br>Be forewarned that below level 27 or 28, these formulae are extremely inaccurate.  They are also slightly off at strength higher than 200-ish.<br><br>Get out your math degrees and enjoy :)<br><br>First, before you can calculate anything, you need to know two very simple formulae.  They are the forumlae to figure out the level bonus for one-handed and two-handed weapons.  These bonuses are the same for <b>every weapon of the same type at the same level</b>.  The damage bonus you get on that rusty short sword is the same one you're getting on that Halycon Broadsword.  The faster your weapon, the more often this damage is applied.  This is why Fiery Avenger is <b>not</b> the best weapon in the game (extremely long delay, thus the damage bonus gets applied less often).<br><br>This is how we calculate the level bonus:<br><br><i>1hLevelBonus = (Level - 25)/3<br><br>2hLevelBonus = (Level - 25)/1.80</i><br><br>Next, I'll show you how to calculate maximum damage.  This is one of the more complex formulae out there, so...  Be glad.<br><br><i>Maximum = ((WeaponSkill + Strength) / 100) * (WeaponDamage + LevelBonus)</i><br><br>Just a quick note, WeaponDamage is the damage number listed on the weapon.  This would be 33 for Fiery Avenger, 15 for Ghoulbane, or 6 for a Polished Granite Tomahawk.<br><br>This all seems pretty straightforward, right?  Now I need to explain something else.  Through lots of log parsing, a lot of us have found that there is a certain number (that we call the Magic Number) that you will hit for around 40 to 45 percent of the time, <b>totally disregarding strength</b>.  That's right.  Strength doesn't do jack to your damage other than maybe 0.5% more damage overall.  It only increases the amount of numbers that you'll hit, and it doesn't mean that you'll hit for those numbers a lot.  I'll debate this further down the road however in different posts should people wish to try and shoot down these claims. :)<br><br>To calculate the Magic Number (somtimes just called MN), you use this formula:<br><br><i>MagicNumber = 2*WeaponDamage + LevelBonus</i><br><br>This is the same for both one-handed and two-handed weapons, except for that you use the 1hLevelBonus I listed above for one-handers and the 2hLevelBonus for two-handers.<br><br>And now, we come down to minimum damage.  This is calculated in two different ways for one-handers and two-handers.<br><br>For one-handers, you calculate minimum damage like this:<br><br><i>Minimum = 1 + 1hLevelBonus</i><br><br>For two-handers, you calculate it like this:<br><br><i>Minimum = 3 + 2hLevelBonus</i><br><br>Are we catching up?  Pick your weapon that you use currently, and one that your friend uses currently.  Figure out everything about them that I've listed already, and then do the next section which I so lovingly title:<br><br><b>So how does this all fit into figuring out damage per second</b>?<br><br>It's another big old formula.  I'm getting tired of typing at this point, so I'll just give it to you:<br><br><i>AverageDamage = (0.45 * Minimum) + (0.45 * MagicNumber) + (0.1 * Maximum)</i><br><br>Okay, so now you've got your average damage per swing figured out.  Great!  Only one thing...  this doesn't let you compare weapons because they have different delays!<br><br>To calculate what I'm getting at (Damage/Second), we need just <b>two</b> more formulae to finish this up (are you getting excited too?).<br><br>The first we need is the Double Attack Formula.  It is calculated as this for <b>paladins</b>.  I am not sure if it will work for warriors, rangers, etc.  I'll probabally test it out someday.<br><br>Here is how we calculate Double Attack:<br><br><i>DoubleAttack% = (Skill + Level)/500</i><br><br>If I'm not mistaken, Double Attack caps off at 200 for all hybrids and warriors (not for monks and Rogues, those high-skill bastards), and increases at 5 skill points for every level (plus five for level one).  Would you like an extra formula for this?  <i>(Level + 1) * 5</i><br><br>For the final calculation, we'll assume that accuracy is 45-55% against even cons.<br><br>Damage Per Second is calculated as follows:<br><br><i>DPS = Accuracy% * (AverageDamage/(Delay/10)) *(1 + DoubleAttack%)</i><br><br>As far as I am concerned, this is as accurate as it gets.  If I wasn't so tired of typing this up, I'd post some sort of ending.  But I am, so have fun with your damage formulae, and don't make your head explode kids!<br><br>*Note:  These formulae will not work for weapons wielded in the offhand.  As this is a paladin board, dual wield predictions are excluded from this discussion.<br><br><i>(Edit 11/14/2000:  These formulae are slightly off for two handed weapons with delay lower than 28, and any weapon with a delay higher than 40.  Bear this in mind.)<br><br>(Edit: 06/28/2001:  These formulae don't apply post-50.  Doh!)<br><br>(Edit 09/12/2001:  Changed accuracy to more closely reflect our attack rating.)<br><br>(Edit 10/04/2001:  I have yet to find a reliable method of predicting damage with the Avatar buff up.  It appears to simply skew the damage more towards the max than the min, but it is quite a bit more complex than that.  Therefore if you have a Primal weapon or a good shaman friend, these formulae will again not be 100 percent accurate.)</i><br>&nbsp;<br><b>Praetor</b>, 60th Crusader<br>Avatars of Discord</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The wierd thing is that this uncommon drop (Mith 2hs)off the frog king is going from 600pp-1.2k on my server, depending on who is selling & how desperate they are for cash. <br>The common drop off the frog King is the froggy crown which sells for 1.5k-2k on my server.<br>Tells me that the server is predominantley filled with peeps 46+ that really need the crown for higher lvl raids for the resis. ie. Naggy & Vox raids etc. And that we have an abnormal volume of monkeys that are looking to upgrade to the crown for their Uber head gear.<br>I often see 2-3 peeps advertising in EC , looking to buy a froggy crown!<br>Torsk Holynite, Ad Gloriam<br>Dwarf Paladin of the 50th Season<br>Lanys T'Vyl<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>
