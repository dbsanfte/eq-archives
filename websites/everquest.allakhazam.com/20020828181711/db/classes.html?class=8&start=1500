Alot of high levels are very grateful for this type of service, especially if you're willing to come find them because they're KoS in the city. You can do pretty well doing that - and while it won't make you wealthy, it will definitely help you get some better equipment. <br>My stronget advice to you, though - is level like crazy. Try to change your focus (at least for now) from getting stuff to getting xp. Money comes ALOT more easily in the mid 20s than it ever will in the teens. Trust me, your level will make an enormous difference. At lvl 24 solo forest giants in Warsliks woods and at level 27 group in crypt of Dalnir. You'll be pretty set pretty quickly.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>At 26, I don't think you're quite ready to take on giants solo just yet (forest giants in Warsilik's Wood might be an option, but I've no experience there at all). <br><br>I want to present a few options to you:<br><br>1) Named gnolls in EK- at the foot of the ramp from HHP, follow the zone wall to the left. Among the rocks there, you'll see a band of Mucktail Gnolls. All are named, and seem to be level 22 to 26. There is also a Chief, who will give you xp up to 30. Loot is very poor, save for the gnoll scalps that will earn you decent coin and hard-to-get faction when you give them to Captain Orben in HHP. Warning: the gnolls are Shaman, so be prepared to be on the receiving end of spells. Root is the worst of them, but they also cast minor disease and poison DoTs.<br><br>2) Griffennes (and maybe Scythe Beetles) in NK- griffennes are kinda scarce, but are great xp when found. You can offer the feather they drop to any shaman you might find to make a new friend (Totemic Armor quest item). Scythe Beetles are the top of the beetle food chain in NK, and they might still give you xp. Loot will be mediocre at best ('fennes drop up to about 1pp or so).<br><br>3) Tesch Mas Gnolls at the Split Paw spires in SK- personal favorite. I started doing these at 26 and am still doing them at 35! At 26, they'll be anywhere from black (even) to maybe red to you, but they are soloable IF you get snare (later, ensnare) to stick. Try to stay at maximum spell range from them and toss a snare- if it sticks, great; if not, retreat a sec and toss it again. If it doesn't stick the second time, I'd suggest zoning into Split Paw (cave opening in the middle of the three spires). Depending on how much mana you have, you might have to resort to DoT-run-nuke-run-med-repeat to kill them, but you CAN do it (These guys have about 850 hp and they hit you for up to 61)- just be patient and careful. Loot is exceptional for these guys- fine steel weapons, up to 3.5 pp in coin, and the occasional gnoll hide lariat (procs stun) or Split Paw armor pieces (the gloves are +2 WIS and +3 DEX- great for wis casters or monks). Downsides are that its heavily camped even during off-hours and KSing is frequent. These guys will keep you in loot and xp into your mid-30s- I can solo up to three now at 35, though 2 are much more manageable.<br><br>4) Aviaks at their city in SK- going up the pecking order (sorry- couldn't resist the pun) are darters, rooks and harriers. All are easily soloable. I'd suggest avoiding the avocets until you get your spells at 29. They resist spells too frequently to justify the risk. The only real dangers you have here are pulling a second one as you kite your initial target, and being trained by someone else that lost control of their pull. Aviaks will swarm if they see you killing another bird, and we're talking about MoBs that hit for anywhere from the mid-20s (darters) to 70 (avocets)- don't risk melee. Run to Lake Rathe zone (almost due south of the aviak city) if you get trained. Loot can be very good- harriers drop up to a plat plus in coin and the occasional gem or Rune/Word.<br><br>(Also in SK are centaurs. They'll fall in your level range, but are dang hard to kite because they have arrows. Soon as you sit to med, they pop you with an arrow and screw you up. I've not found them worth the effort.)<br><br>5) Various NPCs around Norrath. Most druids eventually resort to killing NPCs. Either they don't worry about faction OR they know how to offset it. Bards and 'dorfs' (dwarves) tend to be the targets of this slaughter. Let me offer a couple suggestions here.<br><br>5a)Bards- Cordelia Minister at the wizzy spires in NK is your target at level 26. She'll get you decent xp for a couple more levels. Pull her nort- away from the spires. The guards at stone bridge WILL jump in to help her, and you don't want that. Vahlen Nostrolo (level 30 or 31) in SK was the next target up the bard ladder, but he has a new very high level bard that spawns with him, and his life expectancy has increased quite a bit of late. There is also a bard at the Butcherblock Docks that falls into this level range, and the guards won't jump in to help her. To offset faction loss, read up on the Watch Report quest in South Qeynos. Try to get faction to amiable before hunting them and don't let it fall past indifferent (you'll be surprised how many kills it'll take to lower faction-they're very forgiving).<br><br>5b) Dwarves. I have two guards that are personal favorites. Just south from the Butcherblock Docks is a ruined tower with a wall around it, home to an evil high elf merchant (think this is the guy that will sell to iksar) and his two personal dward guards Gonin and Kyte (also known as Goner and Kyted). These guys are around level 28 or so with around 750 hp. hit for mid-50s), and spawn together just outside the south wall. You will need to harmonize them before pulling, then get one of them and kite it down near the water. Xp is terrific, but loot is pretty sad. Also, they're on a spawn timer of like 20 minutes, so are not a time-efficient camp. I would generally do these guys if I ported to BB on my way somewhere else. Faction loss here is with the dwarf rogues' guild (Miners 248 or some such). You will NOT lose faction with the other dwarven guards hereabouts by killing these two. The danger with that is the rogues guild in Kaladim is located right next to the bank, and the bank is well within the aggro radius of the dwarven rogues, so banking in Kaladim will not be an option after too many kills. You can offset the faction loss here by killing the Butcherblock Bandits (Peg Leg and his camp- all very green to you at level 26) which spawn a short run to the NE of the dwarven guards. Very simple solution.<br><br>I hope that you'll find this of some help, and good luck! <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Not knowing what race you are, I can only offer suggestions based on the possible druid starting races.<br><br>First off, soloing will be fairly difficult until you get SoW at 14. Wherever you choose to fight, your first spell should be to damage shield yourself- you'll have to melee alot, so be prepared. Next, snare your target, then DoT him with Flame Lick before DD'ing him with your lightning spell.<br><br>If a wood elf, Orc Hill just north of Kelethin is your best bet for now, though xp will be a bit slow at level 10. Crushbone is a more attractive destination, but remember that you'll be just above orc pawns on the food chain, and trains of reds will be frequent. If you can get into a group down by the slavers' huts or perhaps on Trainer Hill, you'll do very well. If determined to solo, look for the centurions near the zone so you can escape from the trains. Butcherblock is a good alternative, but stay near the zone or the various dwarven guard outposts.<br><br>If playing a halfling, Misty Thicket can be your home until your mid-teens. At 10, hunt scarabs and spders near the gate in the Wall. Plenty of deputies are around to bail you out if you get in over your head. Closer to 14, you can do the goblin or orc camps, pulling with harmony. Or get a partner and do them now- tank or caster with pet is your best bet as a partner. I consider Misty Thicket to be the best newbie zone in the game, so milk it for all its worth.<br><br>If you chose a human in Qeynos, Blackburrow with a group is the best bet I can offer. Trains here are murderous, so soloing is impractical. If soloing is your choice, hunt spiders and such near the guard towers in West Karana. Stay near the Qeynos Hills end of the zone, because werewolves and hill giants do wander the zone.<br><br>If you chose a human in Freeport, hunt sand scarabs and giant spiders (maybe still orc raiders too) in the Desert of North Ro. NRo is vastly preferable to the Commons due to less characters camping it (an exception to this might be the orc camp in West Commons- its generally not camped- though you'll have to contend with giants and griffons that wander the zone. Again, you'd need a group here rather than attempt to solo it). If you choose NRo, stay near the sand-grass border rather than venture too far out into the desert. There's a guard nearby that will help you out if you can make it back to him. Should you choose to group rather than solo, there are three Dervish Cutthroat camps here that offer really good xp at levels up to 15 or so- derv camp three (along the east wall almost to the Oasis of Marr zone) will most likely be your first camp.<br><br>I did try to gently nudge you toward grouping rather than soloing. Once you get to 14 and get SoW, soloing will be much easier and the possibilities for hunting will grow exponentially. Until that time, grouping is a much safer alternative. Either way, you made a great choice picking a druid, and you'll have much enjoyment playing one.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Amongst others, to be sure. You can probably still get away with it if you're kiting werewolves, but in my experience - those guys are quick.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Here's the deal - I'm a level 30 druid on Bertox, and I have recently discovered a way to make really good money. For the past few evenings I've made between 700-900pp per evening (about 5 hours of play a night). I've gotten some really nice equipment as a result such as a chrysoberyl talisman, a plat ruby veil (finally) and last night I got a knobbed warclub (thats around 4k in stuff). The only problem with this little racket I have going is that I'm not getting any xp because I'm too busy collecting goods and making trades. <br>Naturally, at this point I'm fantasizing about the GE boots I want, and the RM bracers etc. This would take about 3 weeks of play just to get those items - and in 3 weeks, I could be fully decked-out, or I could be level 34 - 35. My WIS is 180, and the rest of the stuff I have is above my level - so it's not a NEED per se, but what druid doesn't fantasize about running around in the very best badass equipment?<br>Anyway, if I have to summarize this into a question - Am I better off getting better equipment now and leveling faster later, or leveling up and camping the stuff in about 10 or 15 levels? <br>By the way, I'm not farming - I'm collecting lore items that have been left to decay, then porting and selling them for less than they're worth. Your input is appreciated ) - thanks<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I'm the guy that originally wrote this post, and here's what I was up to:<br><br>I had bound myself in Warsliks woods to camp the forest loop. Well, Grachnist the Destroyer spawns in Warsliks, and alot of hi-lev's camp him for the totem or the earring, but he drops iskar scaled gloves EVERY TIME (10 AC, 3 str, 3 dex - no druids, but all other melee and hybrid). These gloves are lore, so whoever is camping the earring can only take one pair - subsequent pairs are left to rot. I would collect the gloves - port to WC and sell the gloves for between 150 and 200pp, then gate back and collect another pair - rinse and repeat. I've pulled in about 1k in a single evening using this method. People would clear out the entire gob camp to make him spawn - and at times he would spawn 2 or 3 times at once. I was forced to sell the gloves for as low as 80pp just to get rid of them sometimes because another pair was sitting there, rotting. But Grach is nerfed into a rare spawn now, and the market (on my server) is saturated for iskar scaled gloves. Oh well, it was fun while it lasted - and if you see a lvl 31 druid running around in full chitin with crazy equip, send him a tell - I'd love to hear from you :)<br><br>Maxxroach Windrunner<br>Druid of 31 Moons<br>Bertox <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The new ability to med with a single key has provided a new strategy. Notice that while you med, the mana increases by ticks. Between ticks (5-6seconds) nothing happens. So between ticks you can do something. Anything look, run, heal, track, check persona. Just get medding again before 5 seconds is up. <br><br>I use this as follows. I have "Spells" as a hotkey (number 4), and Heal as a hotkey (number 2). After a kill, I will med immediately, then when I have enough mana, I watch the "ticks" immediately after a tick, Ill hit 4, then 2, I heal, and immediately hit 4 again. Just after I sit, I get the next tick.<br><br>If you want to get somewhere dont run and get there then med. Start by medding when the tick occurs hit spells, run for 4 seconds then hit spells again. Keep doing this until you get to where you were going and you have lost no med time.<br><br>This is the greatest time saver of all time!<br><br>If Verant stop this, ill quit the game.<br><br>Dubrave<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

What you are doing is fooling the client into thinking you're medding more than you are.  However the server knows your mana and will reset it when you cast your first spell.  This is why if you use your method and then cast something like snare it will appear as if snare took a bub of mana.  What's happening is that the client is being updated by the server with your real mana % instead of the tricked out mana % it thinks it has.  The point is that the server is the thing that sets what mana you have and it's always going to know where you're at regardless of what you do to the client.<br><br>.anonymous.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Sit down, and med.  This is useful.<br><br>If you manage to get mobs that have "low" hps (Dorfs, birdies), then AE kiting is the way to go.  Why kill 1 mob with 3 bubs of mana when you can kill 4 mobs with 4 bubs of mana?<br><br>It's easy to do too.  Find a couple of mobs ripe for the plucking.  Ensnare 'em all, run around in circles till they're all running side by side.  Target the one in the middle, and AE, AE, AE.  Don't let 'em catch ya tho, cuz they'll hit ya, stun ya, and by the time you're unstunned, you'll be down 600 + hps.<br><br>My 2 cents on the soloing druid<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

SoW is nice out doors.<br>20-35 We can still fill the role of primary healer, keep those dmg shields up, snare them mobs.<br><br>35+ We are a vital utility class.   We are the masters of none, really, but we have a lot to offer groups.<br> <br>#1  Ensnare.  Most important spell in the game, esp in dungeons.  Save your groups.<br>#2  Dmg Shields.  I've heard mages have better than us.  I'm not sure.  The can't snare or emergency evac tho.  And they can't back up heal as well.<br>#3  Back up healing.  Clerics do the healing.  But who heals the cleric?  Us.  We're also useful when clerics LOM or OOM.<br>#4  Dmg to Mobs.  We're not wizzies, mages for DDs, and we're not Shamans or Necros for DoTs, however ours do do a decent ammount of damage, and can be useful.  Usually other jobs keep me so busy tho, don't have mana for these.<br>#5  Animal charming.  Upper/lower Bugs.   Sonic bats are great pets.  Ya don't have to fight as many mobs, and ya can have a mob fight for you.<br>#6  Emergency Evacs.  For when Ensnare is resisted (after casting it the entire fight), or when you forget to snare the scarab in sebilis, and tanks chase it, bringing back 6 fogloks and a gloem with 'em.  Also useful on bad pulls.<br>#7  Buffs.  Skin like XXX, Strenghts, and regens  (esp group regens) are nice.   <br><br><br>There are posts about what makes a good druid and what makes a poor druid.  Oldone hits it REALLY well.  There are a variety of things a druid can do in the group, and you've got to set your priorities in order to make effecient use of your mana.   <br><br>Keeping the mobs snared, and the dmg shileds/regen up usually take up most of my time.  If i find myself bored, and high on mana, i start DoTing mobs at the beginning of fights.    Finding myself high on mana at end of fights, I DD mobs.  I usually try to keep a bub or two in reserve for when the cleric will say "LOM" during a lengthy fight, or when the leader says that critical word "EVAC" when the ENC and CLE are LOM, and there are more nasties comming.<br><br>My two cents on the Grouping Druid.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I've read some of these posts, and I've noticed that a couple have mentioned how there are so many druids, yet so few good ones. I'm no druid, I can't tell you the best way to use your array of spells, or how effective you are at melee. But I do want to stress, beyond belief, the importance of being a /good/ druid, and a few thoughts on what makes a druid 'good'.<br><br>First of all, you're a powerful soloing class. But don't forget the importance of groups in the game. You can get to level 60 without them, but you aren't going to planes or Veeshan's Peak on your own if you want to survive. And the practice you get joining groups in easier areas is invaluable later on, when groups can't afford any mistakes. You don't have time to learn after you're ported into Hate, you must know beforehand.<br><br>Also, avoid the Kewl Dr00d/Phat Lewt mentality. I know that I would rather have an empty space in my group than risk my neck for someone who I can't trust at my back. Most of the people I group with feel the same way.<br><br>Third, don't kite Spectres through the docks in Oasis. At least on Tribunal, there is almost always a druid doing this, and it causes more unneccessary deaths than any other single action I've ever seen purposefully done. If you want to kite spectres, fine, but kiting them through a known resting spot for people 20 levels lower is just plain wrong.<br><br>Use your common sense. There are probably a million things to avoid that I havn't covered, but most of them are plain courtesy things. Druids are a powerful class, and make excellent groupmates, but only if you can stand out from the bad reputation that so many who have come before you have created.<br><br>Cryselle Silverwynd<br>46 Wizardess<br>Tribunal<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

We can slow our enemies down, and pelt them with spells till they die. People talk about the things that druids aren't quite as capeable of, and theres always another class that can cast better, or heal better - but there is no class as well rounded as druids. We can do it all. Find another class that can complete the stein of moggok quest in less time without help (in wolfy form). And talk about an asset to your guild - I took some time last night and collected quest items for a member of my guild - it would have taken him days to do this. It took me just over an hour. If anyone needs help - you can be there in a matter of minutes. Because I'm bound in Kunark - at level 30, I can pretty much get to anywhere in Norrath in less than a half hour - with few exceptions. I have several areas that I like to camp for loot and xp - and they span the Norrathian globe - if a place is overcamped, I just port out to somewhere else. We are completely self sufficient - we don't even have to rely on a pet to keep us from getting waxed. And we can deal out a fair amount of damage. In a duel, we are the bane of the melee player. Just root and shoot, then hide and med if you need to - track if they run, harmony guards if they run for cover.<br>And for the record, we also happen to be among the fastest leveling classes in the game. If you start a druid, you won't look back.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have been playing a Druid on the Fennin Ro Server for about 3 weeks now. Im level 14 now. The first 3 levels are a bit slow, just like any level really. But once you hit 4th and get the harmony spell and Graping Roots spell you can go to town killing things. <br><br>For soloing you can do something like this, Find a yellow creature Root it, and start casting Burst of Fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;Get it to half HP's approx 3/4 mana and then pound it to death.  Careful though, you can do this all the way thorugh 8th level. At 9th you have to find the right creatures, ones that dont always hit for over 20 and you can hit. I find willowwisps the best for this..  After you hit 10th or 11th you have the HP's to go for whites and yellows agian.<br><br>Within a group, you can root it, then wait for the casters in your group to beat it down or de-buff it. Then just go in and pound the .... out of the mob. The key with a druid is Dont just tank, if you got a nice weapon do it, but use your spells too. You dont have the HP's in your later levels before getting new HP buffs (Skin like XXXXX) to take things that are yellow or white often. <br><br>Comparing it to a Ranger, I think the druid is better personally. You can make a druid much like a ranger with the exception of what weapons and armor it wears. Just up the stamina of the druid instead of everything else so you get more HP's. With a Ranger you Have to do that as the ranger is a pure tank for the first 9 levels. Then starts getting druid spells. Light Heal at level 9 is great to keep you alive, but its not going to heal you all the way, and it takes forever. <br><br>The big thing for the ranger is it IS a Tank with some druid spells. Harder to solo since it can't kite worth a diddly squat until upper teens and doesnt have spells to back it up. Cant say much for groups, I have personally never been in a group with a Ranger and have not grouped with mine which I ended up deleting after not playing it for months. Rangers however are a good Class, especially now that they have as much mana as any other class via Wis, and bows are doing more damage. <br><br>Chayraine Druid 14, Fennin Ro<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>OK...let me see if I can answer your questions seriatim:<br><br>1) A druid's role depends upon where he is fighting. Indoors, his job should be to damage shield the tanks (at least the primary tank), keep the AC buffs (Skin Like...) on at least the primary tank, snare or ensnare the MoB (no runners!), and act as the backup healer. Toss in the occasional DoT or nuke&nbsp;&nbsp;if you have the mana to spare- ours are pretty good too, though not in the class of a wizzie or magi. Finally, you eventually get the Succor line of spells that can evac your whole group when things go bad.<br>Outdoors, the most important thing might just be to keep your group SoWed.  Past that, you have alot of options. Basics are the same as those duties listed above. Plus, you can kite MoBs (my favorite technique is listed below in a reply to a  post called "Getting beat on while in a group"). You can also charm an animal that might wander by to help you and your group out.<br><br>2) If you have to rely on a druid to tank, you are in deep doo-doo. We can't handle that role at higher levels (anything past 20 really). We don't have the armor class (with reinforced leather so rare, most druids are still in patchwork unless they have stat-boosting stuff. I know I am at 34), so we get beat on hard and fast. We don't have the hitpoints (maybe half what a warrior of comparable level has). We don't have high STR and high-damage weapons (for the most part, you'll use one handed bash or slash weapons and put a WIS enhancing item in your off hand). About the only time I ever melee is to finish off a MoB that Ive kited to within an inch of its life or if I am grouped and the MoB is about gone. You just can't trade your 20 point hits for their 60 plus point hits for very long.<br><br>3) and 4) You better believe that your spells are very effective at killing. Ditto that you can solo after 20. Druids are the second best soloing class in the game, coming right after Necros and slightly ahead of Magicians. One of the great things about Druids is their ability to solo very effectively. With most classes, it's group or camp; not so the druid- you can choose to solo for awhile and keep an eye out for the exact group you want to join rather than just take whatever is offerred out of desperation (I've been on both sides of this I assure you). As far as soloing, it is at 19 that we really begin to shine. One huge fear playing solo is the dreaded corpse recovery run; with a druid, no matter wheere you're bound, its a quick teleport to a nearby Ruins and then a speedy SoW enhanced run to your body. Once you perfect your kiting technique, MoBs will fall even if it takes awhile (and cyclops, giants and the like certainly DO take awhile- but they'll fall). As far as the utility nature of some of your spells, all the better. Group Teleports will put money in your pocket to pay for spells and equipment upgrades- not that many classes can make money this readily (jewelry-makers and alchemists aside).<br>5) Race- I happened to choose a halfling because I prefer the halfling newbie zone (Misty Thicket) to the wood elf one (Greater Faydark). I think MT is less-crowded, has a better progression of difficulty of MoBs, more level-appropriate MoBs, and plenty of guards to run to when you get over your head. As far as stats go, its pretty much even except for INT and CHA, both of which are higher for an elf than a halfling. The INT difference comes into play when attempting to gain skill points. The CHA comes into play when buying/selling to merchants and also when using your Charm Animals line of spells. Wood Elf is the way to go if you plan to be a Charming Druid (so to speak).<br><br>I hope that you'll follow your instincts and choose a druid- yu'll enjoy it. Yes, there are plenty of us around- but all-too-few good ones. Avoind the kEwL dOOd syndrome that seems to affect so many of us and make us proud!<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Here is my next installment to these boards, from yours truly, Zuranthium. <br><br>CAUTION, IF YOU DON'T LIKE TO KNOW THE INNER WORKINGS OF EVERQUEST THEN DON'T READ THIS. YOU MAY COME OUT KNOWING SOME THINGS YOU DIDN'T WANT TO. DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU. <br><br>This post will tell exactly how exp. in everquest works. Lets start out with the leveling formula. <br><br>The exp. needed to gain a level is: level * level * level * race * class * level multiplier <br><br>Here are the values for the races: <br><br>Troll:120, Iksar:120, Ogre:115, Barbarian:105, Wood Elf:100, High Elf:100, Erudite:100, Gnome:100, Half Elf:100, Dark Elf:100, Dwarf:100, Human:100, Halfling:95 . <br><br>Sorry guys, humans don't level faster than all the other races, contrary to popular belief. Halflings do by a minor amount. <br><br>Now here are the values for the classes: <br><br>Ranger:14, Shadowknight:14, Paladin:14, Bard:14, Monk:12, Enchanter:11, Necromancer:11, Magician:11, Wizard:11, Cleric:10, Shaman:10, Druid:10, Rogue:9.05, Warrior:9 . <br><br>As it turns out the hybirds(yes, bards...) take longer to level than the other classes. Warriors and rogues take the least exp. to level. <br><br>Finally, the last number to the formula, here are the level multipliers: <br><br>Levels 1-29: 1.0 , Levels 30-34: 1.1, Levels 35-39: 1.2, Levels 40-44: 1.3, Levels 45-49: 1.4 .....once you get to level 50 almost every level is a hell level and the multiplier steadily rises. <br><br>The 'hell' levels are caused by the sudden change in exp. needed to level at the first level of the level multiplier changes( ie 30, 35, 40, etc.). <br><br>So, lets have an example. We will use a Human Cleric. <br><br>At level 1 the cleric starts with no exp. and needs a total of 1 * 1 * 1 * 100 * 10 * 1 exp. to level, for a total of 1000 exp. and a difference of 1000 exp. <br><br>At level the the cleric starts with 1000 exp. he gained from level 1 and now needs 2 * 2 * 2 * 100 * 10 * 1 exp. to level, for a total of 8000 exp., and a difference of 7000 exp. <br><br>Now lets jump ahead some. At level 10 the cleric starts the level with 729,000 exp. from level 9 ( 9 * 9 * 9 * 100 * 10 * 1). At level 10 the cleric will need a total of 10 * 10 * 10 * 100 * 10 * 1 exp. to level....or 1,000,000 exp. Since he had already gained 729,000 exp. from previous levels, he needs to gain 271,000 exp. to get to level 11 ( 1,000,000 - 729,000 = 271,000 ). <br><br>At it contiues like this for a while until level 30, the first hell level. At level 29 the cleric needed to gain 2,437,000 exp. to level. Now at level 30 they need 30 * 30 * 30 * 100 * 10* 1.1 exp. to level...for a total of 29,700,000 exp. Since they already made 24,383,000 exp. from previous levels (29 * 29 * 29 * 100 * 10 * 1 = 24,389,000), they need to gain 5,317,000 exp. to level ( 29,700,000 - 24,383,000 = 5,317,000). <br><br>Now we will move on to how much exp. the creatures of the game give per kill. Every creature in the game gives level * level * type, of exp. per kill. <br><br>There are many type of creatures in the game....the type multiplier ranges anywhere from 75 to 110. There are 4 major types of creatures: <br><br>Newbie(levels 1-4): 100-110, Low(levels 5-6): 100, Outdoors(levels 7+): 75, Dungeon(any levels): 80. <br><br>If the mob casts or is overly powerful for its level, or is magical, then the type multiplier of that creature usually goes up some. So, the average level 1 mob gives 1 * 1 * 100 exp. per kill, for a total of 100 exp. That level 1 cleric would need to kill 10 level one things to advance to level 2. Knowing that, you can now calculate how many kills you need to level, or about how much exp. you would be able to earn over a period of time(3 hours for example). <br><br>Calculation group exp. isn't that hard. When in a group, the exp. for every kill is divided evenly between the the group members. There is no extra group exp. bonus. If anyone in the group is too low for the group, they will still be taking a share of exp. away from the group, however they will not gain it. If a group has a wide range of levels, but they are still all within the grouping level limit, a few odd things can occur. First of all if someone in the group kills something that cons blue to them, but green to another person int he group, they will have to share the exp. with the person(people) that conned it green, even though that higher level person won't get exp. for the kill. It will simply be wasted. <br><br>At higher levels green cons will still give exp. If they are one level green then they will give half the exp. that they normally would upon being killed. If they are two levels green they will give one quarter the exp. that they normally would. Anything that is 3 levels green or lower won't give any exp. <br><br>One of the last things is pets. While in groups pets will take absolutely NO exp. away from the group. No matter how many of them there are, they simply won't take any exp. away from the group. <br><br>In soloing situations it is a bit different. When soloing, the pet will take half of the exp. away from every kill IF they outdamage their master. If the person who is using the pet outdamages the pet with their spells, then the pet will take NO exp. away from the kill. That is why it is always very important to outdamage your pet if you are soloing. If you don't then you will lose a bunch of exp. that isn't going anywhere. <br><br>I think that about wraps it up. If you have any questions e-mail me at tim_gerber@yahoo.com , or just do a RE to this post. Hope you enjoyed it. use the information wisely. <br><br>Corpusnuntia/Divineshadow/Zuranthium/Plantmaster/naltec/Natalos/Sunsong <br><br>Player of many characters on the Nameless server. <br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Truth to tell, Minyan, Rathe Mountains is where I intend to go once I hit 34. I'm not sure that you can solo a hill giant at 34, but I know you can team with another class and do so. That new DoT makes a difference.<br><br>I am not very familiar with the Kunark zones, so I can't bring much to the discussion about them, other than many of them are designed for characters in the mid-30s and up. I hunted Dreadlands a couple times with my low 30s paladin and a friend who had a mid-30s druid. Pretty much everything there was yellow or red to us, save for the yeti. The yeti were easy kills, but the zone had quite a few wandering nasties like drachnids that wanted to jump in and were aggro to everyone. Drachnids have VERY serious poison and hit about as hard as a cyclops. I think they're also casters- at least some of them are. The point of this is that I just didn't enjoy my time in Kunark at all.<br><br>As far as the 'old' zones:<br><br> You can still get xp and great loot from the gnolls in SK up to 36. <br><br>If giants and griffons are more your speed, I'd suggest NK, as you rarely have to deal with more than a single giant/griff at a time, and nothing else will aggro on you at that level.<br><br> Sand giants (and the elusive Ancient Cyclops) in South Ro are also a good choice- you can port directly into the zone (as you can in NK as well) and they aren't camped nearly as much here as they are in Oasis. <br><br>Speaking of Oasis, sand giants and spectres are on the menu there. Tough to get a single spectre pull here, though, so grouping might be a better idea. <br><br>I think there is a single spectre in the Innothule Swamp that is soloable, though I prefer not to take on casters- tough to kite them if they keep Fearing you (makes you wonder who is kiting whom). <br><br>Unrest and Trainmore, err...Mistmoor, are also possibilites. Unrest is a personal favorite for several reasons, not the least among them is that it is considered an outdoor zone (SoW and wolf form work here!), as well as the fact that the Undead and their friends (terrors and werebats) WILL NOT aggro a druid in wolf form! The only things that will be higher level than you are the Dwarven Ghost and the gnome necro (don't mess with him- he is nasty. Makes Meldrath positively huggable). i know that it is possible to pull a single MoB at a time and kite it without others joining in- I've seen it done alot. If the zone has anyone at all in it, I guarantee that one person will be a high-level druid camping the Ghost for Dwarven Work Boots (800-1200pp). The Ghost still gives xp at level 50 (so says a buddy of mine). Mistmoor is another matter. I read somewhere that the Undead here would not aggo on you in wolf form either. I found it not to be true- even greens jumped me as I headed toward the house and I had a real nice train to zone. If you can get a good group, the loot is outstanding and the xp constant all the way to low 40s.<br><br>Finally, i know that the Guks fall into this level range, though I have never hunted in either. With the notable exception of Unrest, I prefer to hunt the Great Outdoors- it's where we druids shine.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>34 is a tuff level to tell ya about..&nbsp;&nbsp;You're too high for just 'bout anywhere, and just barely too low for the low level groups in guk/sol b.  IMHO.   I'd say at 34, stick to an upper zig/lower zig group in CT, or get out and explore kunark for yourself.    I was in Upper Zig in Cazic Thule when I was 34, and i'd go and kite cyclopses in Mnts of Rathe when i couldn't get a group.  AT 35, pack up your bags and gate to Lavastorm.  Go into Sol B and hit tiger.<br><br>Nice thing 'bout groups is that there is *almost* always a cleric.    This takes the main healing job away from us, which i think is nice.   Doing backup heals, dmg sheilds, snaring (VERY IMPORTANT in Tiger), and the dots.  (Fire based Dots/DDs Don't work on Greater Kobolds) I was able to go from level 35 to 44 in a resonalby short time, I had fun, and I made some friends.  If you're a halfling, there are some GREAT barrels to sit and stand on, so you get a better view of the battle, and if you get a good group going, all you just gotta sit back, keep the dmgshields/regen up, snare every mob, and grab a beer.<br><br>Cristoban<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Later on in the game, there are often 2 kinds of druids -- those that get eaten alive when a monster starts beating on them, and those who can take several hits from even quite powerful monsters.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>It is very important to devote a good amount of time from level 37 to level 40 to get the skill because if you fail to, it gets much much harder later on.<br><br>With my original druid I did pretty much the whole time at shakrn meadowgreen.  Nowadays Frontier Mountains provides a very nice porcupining area for building your defense skill.<br><br>Now you might be saying, I am level 33 right now and my defense is already 30 points behind.  Wellp there is a fairly easy way to build defense when caught at this juncture.  Simply go to South Karana and pick out a centaur charger.  Now kite it without casting any dots on it.  It will follow you and all the while it will be shooting arrows at you.  This will let you gain defense without a whole lot of danger.  If you go a while without getting any defense gains, kill it and pick a different charger(I do not know why but some monsters seem to be better at giving skill ups than others).<br><br>Naked AC with 200 defense is 550 with 100 agil.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I just wanted to post a little message on what to do around level 25-30 without Kunark.<br>First off I am going to assume u already know what kiting is and how to do it... at level 25 there are 2 good options. South Karana is VERY good experiance, and its not to hard to get a group if u want one. Try heading to the Aviak City (commonly known as KFC) and soloing aviak darters/egrets. these are good exp until 26 when u should look into killing rooks. Also at lvl 25 u can get a group and fight Tesch Mas Gnolls outside the Infected Paw zone, a little harder to get a group here since the gnolls hit very hard and most groups would call for a cleric or shaman to heal (not a druid) but great exp none the less, and looting FS is always good =)<br>Now the Tesch Mas Gnolls are fine experience until level 30 so i wont talk about them much anymore... DON'T EVER SOLO THEM! IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE AS A DRUID!!!! Now back to the guide, try soloing aviak rooks/harriers when u reach level 27 and avocets at 28 but now the experience is getting quite dull. This is the time to expand your horizons and try new areas. Ocean Of Tears is very good if u want to risk soloing dwarves on Sisterhood Island (they can pose problems at lvl 28) Best thing to do would be get a partner at lvl 28-30 but at level 30 the best thing u can do is solo them, they give out MAD EXP even at the hell level! Well I hope this helps a little bit.<br><br>Lolin Woodchipper<br>Master Druid of Cazic-Thule<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Not a bad post at all as far as locations to hunt. I've never done any hunting in OOT at all, so anything you know about that zone is welcome news to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me put out a few corrections though.<br><br>At level 25, you really should be kiting/soloing rooks and harriers rather than darters and egrets. Darters will give rather slow xp at 25, and I'd think egrets little or none.  Always use Wolf Form, pick out a target birdie, then snare/creeping crud/careless lightning until dead. With a decent WIS, you'll rarely go into your last bub of mana (still plenty to gate out if a second birdie jumps you). I think I started doing rooks at 24 and harriers at 25 or maybe 26. I was doing Avos at 29 pretty easily, and I can still get xp off harriers at 33.<br><br>As far as the Gnolls, you are right that they do hit hard, though not so hard as an Avocet and, in fact, not any harder really than a harrier. the one thing that sets the gnolls apart from the aviaks is loot- much better items drop reguarly from them (the only advantage that the aviaks have is that the avos occasionally drop black pearls and aviak charms for Crafted armor quests), items such as the fine steel weapons you mentioned, but also Split Paw gloves (+3 dex +2 wis) and, with the new quest in South Qeynos, even the Scrolls can be turned in for faction and coin (up to 4pp!).<br><br>The big points of contention with your post are concering the tesch Mas Gnolls.  You certainly CAN solo these guys, starting at level 29 with your new DD (Combust) and Ensnare. TM Gnolls have somewhere around 800 hit points- you can take them down with 5 casts of Combust (around 600 mana I think total, including Ensnare) if they do not resist at all. I noticed that they did indeed resist at least a portion of damage quite often at level 29. That's why I said use ENSNARE rather than snare. Ensanre lasts dang near forever (about 10 minutes actually), so you can ensnare/combust/run far ahead and med (I call this technique Long Distance Kiting) then repeat as often as you need to. The gnollie will stay ensnared, trust me. I can, at level 33, solo kite two of these guys at once without running totally out of mana or resorting to this long distance kiting, and have even done three at once a couple of times by doing LD Kiting (not advisable though- take forever!). Also, they give terrific XP all the way into 33 (I finally noticed a bit of a slowdown at 32), and a shaman friend of mine told me that they finally went green to her at level 36, though she does occasionally get xp from them even now! These guys can give you 6 levels of experience with relative ease. Also, at Level 29, you get Greater Healing, which makes you as good as any healing class until PCs hit level 34, when Clerics get Superior Healing (I think thats the spell). I can often fill the healing role in a group at these levels (29-33) if necessary.<br><br>A couple of other options in SK around 30 are cyclops and the bard, Vhalen Nostrolo. Cyclops are around Level 30-33; Vhalen is 32. Of these two options, I'd pick Vhalen. He has many fewer hit points than a clops does (I think clops have around 1200 or so), and doesn't hit quite as hard. Faction is a concern here, but if you manage your faction hits carefully (try never to fall below apprehensive- really try to keep it indifferent), he can provide excellent xp all the way to level 37 or so and decnet coin and loot (up to 4pp in coin and a flute that sells for 2pp). To offset faction loss, check out Alla's Quest Database under South Qeynos and look up the watch report quest. It's easy, quick and very effective.  <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Okay when you are outdoors and want to get away from a MOB thats attacking you, you usually do what? RUN. However, most of the time you will die becuase the thing attacking you can run faster or just as fast. Here comes the trick that will save your life hundreds of times over when outdoors. While running hit the number lock button. This will make you run forward without holding the forward button. Then hold the CTRL key and one of the sideways moving buttons(lef or right). The effect? You will strafe WHILE running, making you move FASTER than most MOBS. <br><br>If you don't have sow or aren't a bard, this will save you A LOT. It even helps if you DO have sow, becuase then you will be able to run faster than MOBS with sow speed. If you are able to cast sow and it runs out right when you are about to run away, this trick will save your life. <br><br>Please give me some good ratings for this one. I just saved your life many times, no matter what kind of character you play. BTW, try not to spread it around too much. If everyone finds out Verant will fix it (YIKES). <br><br>Corpusnuntia/Divineshadow/Zuranthium/Plantmaster/Naltec/Natalos/Sunsong <br><br>Player of many characters on the Nameless server. <br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>At level 30 I might be one of the few druids out there who is still tanking.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do this to keep my defense, offense, and weapon skills maxed, not because I like pain. (I seem to get a lot of practice with bind wounds too.)  I don't do this while grouped, only soloing on low blues. My reasoning is that more ac is always a good thing, and that there is nothing more pathetic than going oom and not being able to finish a snared kite because your weapon skill is too low. I spend the first bub or two of each level maxing out those skills.  Easiest place to do this is probably SK, where the Aviaks have a well defined level range and its easy to pick the one you want.  Rooks still give xp, and don't hit so hard anymore, perfect for skill building up to 30.  <br><br>Now in a good group you will rarely, if ever, call on these skills, but it sure nice to have them when needed.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>You raised a good point, Rianne.<br><br>It is indeed worth keeping your melee skills maxxed out, preferably in 1hs, 1hb and 2hb (if you're going to skip one, skip 2hb- wisdom-adding item should be caried in off-hand at all times) for the very reason you stated. In addition, some MoBs, notably the gnolls outside Paw, will, in essence, give up when taken down to about a half-bub of health and just stand there waiting to die.&nbsp;&nbsp;This happens only if they are snared/ensnared, BTW. Yes, you could nuke em again to kill, but its also a great time to work on your weapon skills with little or no risk to yourself. So go for it- it'll take longer, but you're a better rounded character with those melee skills up.<br><br>Also, I tend to practice weapon skills in a group. I ask if folks mind me going melee and caution them that I'll mete out very low damage as opposed to my nukes/DoTs. I also remind them that this saves mana for healing and buffs. If they don't mind, then I wade in occasionally; if they do, no worries- I still do my job ensnaring/dotting/healing. This tactic also allows you to practice melee skills in a reduced-threat situation- always the best time.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I'll be honest....I camped a series of bards for a significant portion of this level range. From what I remember, I started with Misty Storyswapper in West Karana (as you enter WK from QH, hang a left exiting the pass and you'll see three buildings- the bard is there. Misty's level is around 19 to 22, she hits for up to 42 I think, and loot is coin, the occasional Word/Rune and a mandolin each time. After xp slows for her, you can move on to either Cordelai Minister (at the wiz spires in NK) or the bard in Nek Forest (as you zone into NF from EC, hang a left exiting the pass and he's dead ahead). Both of these are around 21st to 26th level and hit pretty hard (low 50s); neither drops anything save coin and very rarely Words/Runes. <br><br>Two cautions here:<br><br>1) Guards- at no time did any of the guards assist Misty in WK as i camped her. I did however have a guard help Cordelia Minister in NK a couple of times when I tried to pull her from a spot close to the bridge. The bard in Nektulos presents a unique problem, as the dark Elf guards do occasionally wander close to his spawn point. If you do not yet have wolf form, they WILL aggro on you, thus giving you not only the bard but an angry guard to handle. Also, even more rarely, I was forced to zone as a Corporal or even a Dragoon happend to wander too close and jump in. I think I remember that, once I got wolf form, the guards would leave me alone.<br><br>2) Faction- yes, you will eventually harm your faction with the various organizations friendly to the League of Antonican Bards (notably Priests of Marr, Knights of Truth and Qeynos Guards). Faction can be rasied with the PoM, KoT and QG easily by killing Deathfist Orcs (PoM and KoT) and Splitpaw Gnolls, bandits, etc (QG). The Bard faction is a bit trickier, as I know of no creatures that, when killed, rasie Bard faction save those in Mistmoor. MM might prove a bit tough at the low 20s. However, there is a quick and simple quest that you can do in South Qeynos to raise (Watch Reports quest- see Alla's Quest Database for details) PROVIDED you do not let faction fall below high apprehensive. Remember to /con the bard each time you prepare to fight him/her to see what faction level you are. Try not to let faction fall below indifferent if at all possible or you'll have to do the Going Postal quests, which are very time consuming (even with teleport). If you start camping the various bards with at least an amiable /con to them, you will be absolutely amazed at how many times you can kill them without falling below indifferent.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well, if you plan on soloing mostly, try South Karana, but not in the typical hunting areas right around Paw or the Av City. Aviak rooks and harriers wander between these two areas, and even over toward the Hermit. Use tracking to find one alone, check the area around it for other wanderers, then pull away and kite until dead. <br><br>If you don't mind really lousy loot, the Muktail Gnolls in EK come to mind as a decent spot. These guys spawn along the rocky wall just to the left of the foot of the ramp from HHP. You surely won't get rich off these guys, but the xp is pretty good all the way up to 30. Caution: they are casters- shaman-type. Most of them are level 22-26 or so, but the Chief seems to be about 28.&nbsp;&nbsp;The big advantage here is that they are almost never camped, probably due to that poor loot. <br><br>If faction hits don't bother you, there are a couple of Bards that deserve your attention at these levels. I do not remember the first one's name, but it is a male bard just inside the Nek forest zone. You'll find him a short distance to the left as you exit the chasm from EC to NF. He can be kited pretty easily in that area. I believe this guy is around level 22 to 25 or so. Rarely, a DE guard will come all the way to this spot, but as I always fought in Wolf Form, I don't think I was ever bothered by one. The second bard is good ole Cordelia Minister located at the Wiz Spires in North Karana. She is around level 24-27 or so, and gives OK xp up to level 29-30. Caution: I have had the guards jump in to help her if I pulled her along the riverbank too near the bridge. Better idea here is make your pull either North (up the path between the Spires) or maybe West (Away at right angles to the bridge). Remember too that there is a very easy quest to do in South Qeynos called the Watch Reports that will repair faction with the Bards *IF* you do not let your faction fall below Indifferent to them. Get the quest details in the Quest database here on Alla's.<br><br>One last suggestion: www.eqnecro.com has a wonderful hunting guide organized by level and with xp/loot/saftey ratings for each spawn. Well worth checking out.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Their level ranges are from mid teens to about 27, you can kite them along the trails because they have low magic resist, PLUS they have a rare drop - the forest loop (worth about 1,000 - 1,300pp). They're a constant spawn, and you'll level quickly. Usually, Warsliks isn't heavily camped because its tough to get to - so print out a few maps from eqatlas, and keep that SoW fresh. You can bind yourself there, port to sell and gate back. I'm lvl 27 now, but I'm sticking with giants until I hit level 29 or until I get another Loop. (already got one).<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Good call, especially if Indoors.<br><br>If outdoors and grouped, let me suggest an alternative. <br><br>GET THE MOB'S ATTENTION AND HOLD IT!<br><br>No,I haven't lost my mind (OK...bets are on both sides of that one). If you, the Druid, pulled the MoB by Ensnare/Snare, DD it a couple of times so that it will single you out for special attention. Back away from the MoB at a leisurely pace, making sure that it futilely pursues you. The tanks in your group should NOT taunt, but rather proceed to wail away on the back of the MoB as it doggedly attempts to kill it's tormentor. You might have to nuke it again occasionally, as a good smack by a tank or caster might divert its attention, but this tactic generally results in a dead mob, several virtually undamaged tanks, and only the downtime necessary for the Druid to regain a couple bubs of mana. If you really want a Utopian experience, get into a group with TWO druids and have them take turns pulling and then medding. Virtually NO downtime then!<br><br>Personal experience: my 34 pally and his 38 druid buddy regularly kill griffons/hill giants/sand giants using this tactic. If we can persuade another tank to join us, we can average a kill every 3-5 minutes or so, with about 2 minutes downtime between fights for medding. Call it 8 kills per hour, netting around 200pp loot and a bit less than a&nbsp;&nbsp;bub or so xp for each. My 31 Druid introduced this tactic to many groups in SK at the gnolls, and all are astounded at the benefits of taking little damage and putting MoBs down quickly. <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
