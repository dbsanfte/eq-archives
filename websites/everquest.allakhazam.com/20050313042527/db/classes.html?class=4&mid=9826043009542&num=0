I promise you it will be a tale filled with adventure and wonder. So rest and have some Dwarven Ale while my music and story unfold. <br><br>Now I know many do not believe in the Legend of the User. But sometimes I am effected by strange dreams that lead me to believe there is a destiny that comes not from our Gods but from what is best described as the User or one who controls our journey and our quests. The first of these strange dreams came to me as a youthful Bard of only ten songs when I dreamt of a journey into the Lower regions of Guk. There were powerful beings there that could crush me and have me for dinner like a clove of forest garlic. I carried off a quest that few would venture to try at such an early age and was awarded a Mask of Deception in the morning when I awoke - but that is a tale for another time and a different fire. <br><br>I was dining with friends and a few adventurers that I had just met that afternoon. I told them of the shiny ancient coins that I had found through my travels and of a quest that was known to many Bards. I speak of the search for a golden tambourine that was once owned by a great conductor named Nostrolo. This instrument was sought after because it had magical properties that exceeded even the mighty war drums from Mistmoore Castle. I knew not if the stories were true but I did like holding the coins and showed them to my companions by the fire. One of the strangers I had met was a small Dwarf that practiced the art of healing named Renew. This mighty healer had even brought back a fallen comrade from the far reaches of the Loading Zone into which many of us have fallen into while in fierce battles. There are many tales I have heard about this Loading place but I wander from the track of this tale.... <br><br>There is a coin, he told me, that legend holds to be lost in a land called the Emerald Jungle. It was dropped there by some poor soul that fled from a hoard of monsters that are so tremendous that I shuddered as he described them. It was a powerful tale that I could never repeat properly but I tell you now that a Bard of over 40 songs does not quake over small and trivial things. He told me that this coin was one that everyone sought but because the land where it was dropped was so hostile and filled with dense forest that only a master of forage could retrieve this lost coin. It had been attempted by many and there were many that failed. One of the other travelers mentioned that there is a race of Lizard men that might find this coin as they were born with the ability to forage that many would never see. I listened carefully as this wondrous coin might make my collection complete and the strange land from where it came might be an adventure I would embark on one day. The night grew long and the brandies we were sharing made my head nod into sleep. I began the dream quest that you will now hear me speak of. <br><br>My spirit awoke feeling very odd and the surroundings were very dark and strange. I was totally lost and confused by this place and there in front of me was a being that looked a little like the lizards of Ferrott where I am known to wander. He spoke to me in a series of hisses and snapping of his long tongue but somehow I understood his meanings. I asked him in the same strange language what I was to do in this place and he told me I was just hatched and that I was born to a destiny and purpose he then told me I was an Iskar. I looked into the stream and was shocked to see a reflection that was both terrible and yet beautiful at the same time. I was a handsome looking lizard too. It was indeed a wondrous sight to behold. I spoke my name and it sounded like Kah Ching in this strange tongue. I then remembered the lost coin of the Emerald Forest. I asked my companion about a land of dense jungle where monsters roamed and he told me there was such a place not too far from this city where I was safe and guarded by Iskar Troopers. He said I would need to be much more experienced before I should even think about a journey to this place. I insisted that my destiny seemed linked to this land and that I was compelled to go there in spite of the dangers. He described to me the cliffs I must follow and that I must stay close to its edge and to avoid the Field of Bone by keeping well to the right of it. He said eventually I might find the pass that leads into the Emerald Forest. He also said he doubted I could even make this journey without losing my life. I struck out with only a few biscuits and some drink wearing the garbs of a young Nercomancer and armed only with a dagger that was given me moments after at my birth, errrr hatching that is. <br><br>I found this place called Emerald Jungle and it indeed was filled with many strange smells and sounds. The screeches of beasts were loud as if they were very close of perhaps very large. I was filled with great terror here so I called out to see if there were any in this land that might group with me. I could hear the laughter of the few warriors there and the yelled back to me that I was far too young for this place and that they had no time to hatchling sit one so weak as I. They said I should return when I was with fifty or more seasons. I began to forage about and was amazed at the ease that I was able to bring forth many good things to eat and there was plentiful water to be gathered too. I certainly would not be starving to death in this rich and plentiful land while I searched for the ancient coin I had dreamed about in a now faraway camp. <br><br>A long time of searching passed when a bard of some thirty songs ventured by me. He sang of his search for a lost coin that he needed. It was the same old stories I had heard about this legend as a bard in another place. I offered him some foraged food and told him of this dream I found myself in and that I believed I was destined to find this coin. He promised me riches far beyond what I could imagine should I present him with this lost coin. I told him that I felt my purpose was to provide this coin for my other self as a bard and that my User was directing me to this place for this purpose. He showed me many valuable things that he claimed were gifts from his User that he called Twinker. This was the first time I had heard of a being that had a named User. He said he understood my quest but had doubt that it would be fulfilled. At that very moment I uncovered a coin from under a stone. I was shocked as my experience so far had been one of failure, of doubt and disbelief but there was no doubt about this coin being real. I showed this to the bard and he too was amazed. He vowed he would return in a dream state as an Iskar and find a coin of his own. He then departed and I was once again alone in the thick dark jungle. <br><br>Now greed is a funny thing but I thought of what a young Iskar might do with the vast riches the "Bard with the User named Twinker" might give me. I wondered if somehow I might find yet another coin that might be bartered away for some treasure. It is a terrible thing to have this greed in such a young being that needs so many things. My life as a bard had been one of hard work and the things I possessed were either earned or gifts from people I had become friends with. I continued my search however and tried to duplicate my actions from before hoping that whatever magical thing I had done would be repeated and I would be very famous as a young Iskar with two fabulous lost coins. I searched and searched and was beginning to be filled with doubt that anyone could be so lucky as to find two things that are so highly valued. <br><br>The bard returned and asked me for the coin again. He was not happy that I had this coin that he desired and he asked again to see it and he would show me some things that I might find more useful. Now I have already told you that this bard had tempted me but after long pondering I had decided that it was far better if he earned his coin like I had. It was at that moment that I uncovered the second coin. I believe now after thinking back on this strange dream that the trick to finding this coin was to resist the temptation of leaving your quest and your deep felt destiny. I didn't offer this second coin to him as I knew he would be angry at my decision to not share this treasure with him. I thought instead that this second coin might be better used to give to another bard that had honor instead of wealth. I felt good about this decision as I made my way back to my hatch site in the city of Lizards. <br><br>Now I see from your faces that you have doubts about this tale. I must admit that even now I am filled with wonder if it even happened at all. But my destiny now is to venture forth to this faraway land and claim the coins that my spirit self has foraged there. I am certain that this is going to happen as I remember the sound the second coin made as I dropped it into my purse. It sounded like Kah Ching which was the name I had while on this dream quest. <br><br>So be brave like the young Iskar my friends when you have a dream like this and find yourself in a dangerous new place. Trust in your user to teach you what your true destiny might be. Any other lessons you might learn along the way you might give back to your user. Now pour me another cup as this tale has made me dry. <br><br>Love and Bardsong to all, <br>Tinkle LilBelle <br>Brambled Bard and teller of tales <br>www.brambledmoon.com</p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br />Tinkle LilBelle<br>Brambled Bard<br><a href="http://www.brambledmoon.com" target="akztarg">http://www.brambledmoon.com</a></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8"></td><td align="right" id="fs8" >0 Replies</td></tr></table>
