	   <tr><td colspan=2>Heh--Those were just a few ideas off the top of my head bud.&nbsp;&nbsp;=).  <br><br>All I'm saying is that SKs, whether it be mostly HP related, AC cap, whatever, cannot tank nearly as good as a WAR can, and, to me at least, think that is very wrong.  SKs (&amp; PLD) SHOULD be able to tank (PLEASE NOTE THIS...), not necessarily as well as, but much closer to WAR than is currently achievable.<br><br>I'm not saying that what I suggested was the way to go--only that it was an option, clearly amongst a plethora of options.<br><br>To clarify, what I was suggesting was a few changes to the SK class.  However, all changes must be done to keep the class &quot;equal&quot; to all the other classes.<br><br>Hence, take away SK weapon damage capability, yet offset that will much better tanking ability, combined with better spells (to increase damage output), and that wouuld be fine.  The avenues to achieve that, be it higher HP, much higher AC cap--whatever, is immaterial to me.  My only point is that it SHOULD BE DONE.<br><br>It shouldnt take a great player to make an SK tank good, while an average player could make a WAR tank good; that suggests that either 1) the classes are not in balance or 2) SKs tanking ablity is far below what it should be (which is probably the current status)<br><br>SKs, at least at the moment, are generally viewed as just another melee, which really doesn't do anything critical to a group.  As a result, they are not the first class sought after for groups.  I dont know about you, but that is a frustrating element to me.  <br><br>And before anyone gets any wise ideas, I can, as Im sure many others on this board can, play my SK at a very high level, so taht isnt an issue   =)<br><br>Lunatic<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I understand what your saying, ans see your point about ballance.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I'm not willing to give up damage skills to get more HPs.<br><br>Yes we'd have to give up something to get more HPs, and yes we'd need some higher AC items as well.  I think we're closer than you think on AC though, since alot of the high end individual Armor items are Warrior/SK/Pali already, it's just Warriors usually get first loot rights over us.  Also when you look at AC compare the SK using a shield or at least 25AC.<br><br>I think the fact that SK's and Pali's CAN Tank at the high levels if played very well is exactly what was envisioned for our class.  I don't want it to ba a class anyone can play well, it's listed as a high difficulty character.  I appreciate what my skills and reputation have earned as far as roles within my Guild and in other groupings.  Not every SK is allowed to pull, only those who have proved themselves get to do that.  Not every SK/Pali gets listed in the MA line-up, I respect the 60 Pali in my Guild who's earned that right (usually second or 3rd in assist order) alot more than the Warriors who dispite higher AC/HPs aren't allowed to Main Tank.  As a hybred we have to earn our place in the world, as it should be.  If I wanted an easy life i would have been a Warrior, but I wanted the challenge.<br><br>I too would like to see some more improvements in our class.  The HT timer, offensive caps and discipline timers/duration could all be improved.  I'd also like to see some possibility to use AA points to learn Necro spells we don't have access to now.  If they openned it up at 55 or 59 to use 4 or 5 AA points to be able to cast an improved pet, or a better dot or even improve one of our lifetaps would be something well worth the AA points and let us EARN being better.<br><br>I still say we're ok now, but agree we could be better.  I just don't agree that giving up melee damage is worth getting more HP's.<br><br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 55 DE Revenant<br>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 56 DE Revenant</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Sorry, I must be missing something.&nbsp;&nbsp;=)<br><br>What I am suggesting would still leave the SK class FAR more challenging that a WAR would ever be; I dont see that as an issue at all.<br><br>A WAR should be able to be the best tank class in the game, but the gap between WARs and SKs/PLDs should NOT be as great as it is.  Please note that I am NOT saying that SKs/PLDs can't tank--they can.  SEB, Velks, Skyfire, Chardok, etc.--Ive tanked em all, generally with good results.  In your general XP groups, a SK/PLD can tank just fine.  That isnt my point.  <br><br>The point is that far more often than not, a WAR will be far more efficient than a SK at tanking (pretty much) solely because they can take FAR more damage &amp;, as a result of that, are more apt to get groups than any other melee class &amp; I think that that sucks.  You can't know everybody &amp; when you get into a general pick-up group, the general presumption about our class is, and will remain to be (unless changed), there.  Even in 50s, you will probably STILL hear people saying, NOW ALL WE NEED IS A TANK!!  Granted, I immediately, say, &quot;DUHHH--this person is a moron,&quot; but I shouldnt have to say that....<br><br>Further, I have YET to be on a SINGLE Vindy/Rumbl/Statue/King Tormax raid where an SK or PLD was the MT over other WARs.  If you have, you probably had a WHOLE LOTTA peeps there &amp; took him down VERY FAST because it just isn't the most risk-adverse character to have perform that task (by a material degree).  Why?  Because it is far more efficient to have the WAR stand there &amp; take the punishment.  EVEN if the person is less than highly talented player--it isn't hard to hit the attack button &amp; stand there &amp; pray that the CH rotation works well enough to keep you alive (for the most part).  It has nothing to do with damage output or anything--it's all about taking damage.<br><br>Perhaps that is where the BS notion that SKs/PLDs can't tank came from--high end raids.  I'm not sure.<br><br>What I am sure about is that you (anyone) are fooling yourself big time if you think that a SK or PLD can tank substantially as well as a WAR (all things substantially equal).  Many of the people that play this game are not stupid &amp; they also know that.  Hence, WAR are typically at the front doing their thing, while we are generally viewed as just another melee--a damage producer if you will.  Well, if I wanted that, I would have played a ROG or a RGR to begin with.<br><br>I do, however, very much enjoy playing an SK, but there are some glaring errors, this probably being the biggest by a country mile....<br><br>I am interested, however, in what exactly you mean when you say that an SK can tank &quot;if played very well.&quot;  Please define what &quot;very well&quot; means.  What &amp; the timing of our spells is what Im guessing that you are primarily referring to.  Otherwise, we are just an underpowered WAR.<br><br>To me, tanking is all about taking damage.  You want the MOB on you &amp; you need to be able to take the damage that he's gonna give you.  Now, whatever venue we get there is fine, but, at the end of the day, its ALL ABOUT HP, either having enough to stand there or having the AC to reduce the amount of damage done to you; it makes no difference to me how you get there, but its all about HP.<br><br>That being said, and the fact that the spells are what make SKs harder than WAR, lets take a look at the spells available to an SK at 55 that will aid an SK in tanking (as defined above &amp; primarily the best ones--note that I am NOT focusing on damage--I do NOT recognize that as a primary &quot;TANKING&quot; attribute):<br><br>Shroud of Pain (18 AC tap)<br>Shroud of Death (~50 procing lifetap)<br>Spirit Tap (150 lifetap)<br>Abduction of Strength (indirectly related, as it reduces MOB STR by 25, thereby reducing damage done)<br>Torrent of Hate (35 ATK debuff, again reduces damage done)<br><br>Torrent of Pain (AC tap) is available at 56, as well as a decent skin (about 230pts), but those aren&amp;#8217;t available at 55.<br><br>That&amp;#8217;s substantially it.  In a typical fight, you can generally land AoS, SoP, &amp; ToH really fast &amp; early, so those aren&amp;#8217;t really an issue.  So, from what I can see, you are primarily talking about the timing &amp; use of Spirit Tap as to what makes our class challenging to play/tank as an SK?  If Im wrong, then please do tell.  If Im not, then I am forced to disagree with you&amp;#8212;that spell isn&amp;#8217;t going to save you from much, nor is there a lot of strategy behind using it (ok&amp;#8212;there is a little as far as timing the cast, but that is a skill you learn VERY early as an SK, especially when channeling skill is low).<br><br>Verant needs to wake up &amp; smell the coffee&amp;#8212;SKs &amp; PLDs should be able to tank better than they presently do.  I dont care how they get there&amp;#8212;mine was just a silly example of how to do it.  And yes, if they made the changes I am referring to, the class would STILL be very challenging to play&amp;#8212;PERHAPS even MORESO&amp;#8230;.<br><br>Lunatic<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I'm sorry, I should have know not to post here.&nbsp;&nbsp;You follow the HP=GOD STAT philisophy which I don't subscribe too.  Our lifetaps and other spells make up for our lower HP's.  <br><br>I use the lifetaps, debuffs and FD all to either stay alive with agro or dump agro as needed in a group.  I haven't seen the &quot;Big&quot; raids going in with SK's or Pali's as the Main Tank, but I have seen them down the list to take adds or pick up when the Main dies.  Not every Warrior gets to be a Main Tank, in my Guild there are only 4 or 5 Warriors who main Tank, out of a Guild that has over 100 active accounts (not counting multiple characters on the same account).  So the fact that me as an SK isn't going to be asked to Tank Vindi is no big deal, I get asked to tank for XP groups over some of the Warriors.<br><br>So while we don't have the HP's of a Warrior, the big secret is, THAT ISN'T WHY THEY ARE BETTER TANKS!  Warriors are the only ones who Tank Vindi because they have both Defensive Discipline and Auto-Rippost Discipline.  These 2 disciplines are what make them better tanks.  So if you want to really be a Tank, ask for Defensive Discipline, not more HPs.  Give up the Leech Curse Discipline that most of you don't like and ask to get Defensive instead.  That's the ONLY WAY you will ever be asked to Tank Vindi or any of the other big guys.<br><br>The Warriors only goal in life is to be the Meat Shield of these big Raids, I have other skills that I enjoy exploring instead.  <br><br>And yes it is the careful use of lifetaps (all of them) that will keep you alive as a Main Tank when a heal is late or interupted.  We should all know by now that a Cleric heals more with a Complete Heal on a Warrior than they do on CHealing an SK, but that really doesn't matter as they can also get more use out of Celestial Cleansing with us, AND can med during the fight easier as we have better agro control.  Also they save alot of mana spot healing the rest of the group if we are tanking.  So yes a well played SK can tank just not Vindi.<br><br>But again, I'm sorry I even posted here knowing how different our views of the SK Class and HP's are.<br><br>Neptunis<br>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 56 DE Revenant</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I know not why I am your kryptonite.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me make this very clear--I enjoy hearing the opinions of others that take this silly game as seriously as I do.  Just because I defend a viewpoint vigorously doesnt mean that I am being an @#%^ or anything, so please, spare me the &quot;sorry I posted here&quot; bullsh*t &amp; just tell me!!  I want to hear it!!<br><br>If I am wrong, I really want to know.  Let me put it to you another way.  There is a school of thought that says as soon as you think you understand something, you must then try &amp; look at it from a different point of view.  With similar precision, that is what I am trying to----provoke intelligent debate about what is best for the class, not some heated discussion that gets everyones panties in a bundle....<br><br>With that said, you say that I subscribe to the HP=GOD philosophy &amp; you disagree with that.  Let me ask you a question then---what else is there?  If that number hits zero, there isnt much that ANY class can do, no matter WHAT their abilities.  I think you missed my point in the previous message.  HP has to be GOD, as you like to put it, because thats what its all about.  No matter what class you are, no matter what race you are, no matter how much damage you can do, that number hits zero, fight over--you lose.<br><br>Again, as previously stated, we can get there anyway we want, but an SK should be able to tank much better than we presetnly can.  If the way to get there is to increase our defensive disciplines, hell, that would be cool.  Why is that?  Because it helps save our HP.<br><br>Also, Im not saying that an SK should be able to tank Vindy.  Although it would be nice, Im not necessarily saying that SKs /PLDs should be able to do that.  All Im saying is that if Verant truly wants to make all classes desirable for groups, then they can REALLY help SKs by doing WHATEVER (increasing HP, increasing defensive caps, giving defensive disciplines, etc.) to help them SAVE THE HP.<br><br>Verant most likely believes that the classes are reasonably close in terms of &quot;in balance.&quot;  If we didn't take away the melee damage, which actually is a logical step becuase we can then let WAR wield substantially all weapons, which they should be able to anyways, then please provide some other examples of what we can &quot;take away&quot; from to give us better tanking ability.<br><br>Re: WAR being better tanks than SKs cuz of defensive and auto-riposte discipline?  Is taht what you are telling me?  Come on--you have to be kidding....<br><br>Lunatic<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>LOL--Yeah---Damn Vindy hits VERY hard....<br><br>Re: WAR tanking--wouldnt it be better to say that the defensive discipline adds to the tanking ability of a WAR?&nbsp;&nbsp;WAR are probably much better tanks than SKs even without this ability.  From what I understand, an equivalently geared &amp; level WAR will have substantially more HP, as well as a higher AC, which almost by definition makes them better tanks.  Spirit Tap aint gonna make up that difference bud &amp; doing nothing but tapping to heal ourselves certainly isnt the best way for us to be tanking (heh--we would hardly even be swinging...)  And do NOT tell me you aren&amp;#8217;t getting interrupted OFTEN as MT trying to get Spirit off; the casting time sooks&amp;#8230;  =)  <br><br>Further, re: defensive discipline, WAR dont even get defensive until 55, right?  Also, i think that it is on a timer, so it isnt a constant thing that they can constantly rely on (granted, I think that the timer is 15 min intervals, which is fairly quick, but nonetheless).  Also, I believe that you are referring to the Discipline of Furious for auto-riposte&amp;#8212;correct?  If so, that is far less usable, as the duration is 9 secs, with a base re-use time of 60 min.  <br><br>I think that the perception in game doesnt factor in those disciplines at all either.  My experience has been to ask what your total HP is, as well as what you total AC is. Generally, the highest guy tanks (unless he is a DOLT, which has happened &amp; then we make a change.  TRUE DOLTS, however, are really not that common).  Again, right or wrong, that is how I frequently see it working.<br><br>I guess Im confused---why would any of us NOT want SKs to tank better???  With the exception of taunt (which took a BRUTAL blows with disease counters causing less agro), tanking MOBs is the next best thing we do.  And with our taunting ability, I think that it makes a LOT of sense to have us tank better&amp;#8230;.<br><br>Lunatic<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ok you lost me again, I thought we WERE talking about Boss MOBs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I thought we've already agreed that SK's make great tanks for XP groups.  Yeh we could do better in the HP department, but it's only against the Big Guys that we are inadaquate to the point of not being allowed to play.<br><br>I do rely on lifetaps to balance the HP difference between me and Warriors alot.  In XP groups, with Cleric's I know I typically stay in the top 2 bubbles of health with me using lifetaps and the Cleric using Clestial Cleansing.  I also do a great deal of XP with just me and a Druid, Chloro, Superior Heal and Lifetaps keeps me alive quite well.  And if we add a warrior to that mix they stil want me to Tank for agro reasons and the Lifetap that keeps me from being so dependant on the Druids lesser heals.  <br><br>Yes I'd like more HP's, I am currently buying the extra Stamina and will soon buy the Natural Durability, Regen and every other AA Ability that adds to or regens HPs (after I get Critical Hits that is).  But, when I'm in an XP group, my HP's are within about 1k of the comperable buffed Warriors my level, and for Raids I'm above 3k with Hps and the warriors break 5k.  But my value to those that know my play style makes me far more valuable than the HP's I bring.<br><br>Discipline, yes I mean Furrious, but Auto-Rippost lets everyone understand what it does.  The Defensive is lvl 55, 15 minute reset, but for Raids they typically switch MA between pulls so that the one with Defensive up gets to be MA, we do this alot in ToV.  Defensive is just that powerful!  Furrious is a tremendous but limited discipline.  The benefit is to allow huge agro to the Main Tank without taking any damage, which defensive doesn't do (it reduces agro alot).  So basically whenever you get together 2-4 groups of people to do any Raiding, why would you take the chance of NOT having a Tank with Defensive be the Main Assist, it's on par with why would you put a Shaman healing the MA as primary healer.  When the chips go down, everyone does what they have to do, SK's jump in and Tank, Shaman heal, Rangers tank too when they are the last Melee standing and the Clerics haven't camped out yet.<br><br>I'd like to get some plus-up in Tanking, sure, but I don't want to give up Melee ability to do it.  Even if we get buffed up in defense we still will spend most Raids hitting the MOB from behind, so reducing Melee will only make us less useful 90% of the time.<br><br>Neptunis<br>&nbsp;<br>Neptunis Rex<br>lvl 56 DE Revenant</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I could careless about tanking Vindi, if I wanted to tank Vindi I would have been a warrior. I play Sk/Ranger for the fun of having spells and being able to solo when I don't feel like grouping or I wanna make some coin.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all of us think the Sk needs to tank Vindi to be complete. As I have stated before I have been tanking with my ranger and my sk with lesser AC gear has better AC than my ranger unbuffed. The excuse that we can't tank doesn't fly with me. I know some zones need tanks with better AC and defense but I am sure they don't need to have a warrior. <br><br>I was in frenzy in Velks for 4 hours and we had 57 sk tanking for 1 hour then 55 warrior took over when sk left and guess what we had to stop pulling for a min to let cleric get mana. The difference was that the Sk could life tap.<br><br>Do I think Sk's need some work, sure but nerfing our damage output is not the way to go just to get more hps. I think actually raising our damage output would be of more benefit and keeping our hps where they are. You might as well face the fact the warrior will never be replaced as the MA on boss mobs, Verant will never make a change that would allow us to move ahead of them.  We would be better off getting stuff to make us more efficient killers in PvE. <br><br>Give us better reuse time on Leechcurse (a big cry for this is being made on sk boards). Consolidate some of our debuffs into one spell so we don't have to mem an AC tap, ATT tap and Str tap leaving our slots open for proc spells, DoTs and DD. Give us a resist debuff so when we cast it gives us agro and lets rest of group land spells. Give us higher offense not too much but a small upgrade would help with our melee output. Make HT a percentage of total hps for the mob for damage rather than a hard number.<br><br>I don't think my ideas are any better than yours but deep down inside you know that you won't get your hps and weapon nerfage. Sk's will have to make a name for themselves just as Ranger's had to post Kunark and pre Luclin. I don't expect much change after PoP comes out due to them working on EQ2. I think they may make small changes but nothing that will upset the status quo till their next money maker comes out. At which time it won't matter much if Sk's will be able to tank Vindi.<br>&nbsp;<br>Cannis 51st Ranger<br>Razer 50th Sk<br>Jeetkundo 20th Monk<br>Mikaraz 30th Warrior<br></td></tr>
