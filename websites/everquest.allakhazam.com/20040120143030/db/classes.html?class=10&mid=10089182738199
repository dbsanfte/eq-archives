Lord knows I do and I hate looking for a rezz or hunting my body down, but my friends and I sat down the other night and were laughing over our most memorable death we have had on EQ. So for all here to share in the experience what was your most memorable death?<br><br>Mine was when I was checking out a new zone Stonebrunt Mtns opened up and myself and 2 friends (a level 53 Shaman and 55 Warrior) decided to go check out this place. Well everything conned blue and higher to me and the other two a lot of green cons. We started out normal just running around checking things out. Then I hear those famous last words. &quot;So you guy's WANNA HAVE SOME FUN.&quot; I am thinking sure why not I am always up for fun and I am secure in my level. Well we went after a named mob in the zone that we say. Con: RED what would you like your TOMBSTONE to SAY. Maybe I should have taken the hint, but hey it is all in fun. Well Dax my warrior buddy starts hacking at it and I am shooting arrows and the occasional spell at it. Major resists. Well our Shammy went LD just as we get 3 adds. Hmmmm where is this going. I see over group chat Hey I am getting low on health from the Warrior. I am trying to heal but they are hitting him hard. Next thing I know I got major aggro and the Warrior dies. So with SoW on I am running like a little girl yelling HELP at the top of my lungs. I find the zone wall and think hmmmmm lets follow the zone wall and I will find the zone. Wrong I ended up falling one moment I am running the next I see those dreaded words LOADING PLEASE WAIT.......... Fell for 1,000 pts of damage. Well we decided after that lets head over to GFaydark. I needed the Ivy Rune off of the browny there and we did not want to die agian. Wrong we forgot the golden rule KNOCK on WOOD when you say this. We got the Rune and so did my wife for her Ranger. Then we got hit by 5 brownie scouts. I hear RUN over group chat. Well would have been nice to run if I was not rooted to the forest floor. I get stunned 3 times and during one of my turns in the circle I was doing I see my buddy Dax go down. Not cool when the tank that is level 55 goes down. Who was next. Yep you guessed it your fav Ranger Rauvin. I yelled over at the wife RUN NOW. She bolted and I died. Then the Shammie got it sqaure in the eyes. We all end up back at our bind points. So who is still alive I ask. My wife sitting across from me is typing and I can hear her say I am and I have no clue were I am. Over group chat we all see &quot;me&quot; in small letters and the following &quot;I am still alive and hiding, I have no clue where I am and I need help...DAX GEA RAUV I am going to kill you guys if you do not come get NOW.......<br><br>Well that was two death in one night, but I will never forget either one. Too look back on it now....I was pissed at the time, but now I cannot keep from laughing about it all.<br><br>I hope you all enjoyed my rambling and I hope you can share some of your memorable moments here on this BBS like forum.<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Dec 21 03:45:00 2001</em></p>&nbsp;<br>May Karana Bless You All,<br><br>Rauvin Darkfeather<br>Protector of the Great Storm and Follower of Karana</td></tr>

It deserved the excellent I gave it !<br><br>My most memorable death? Gee there's been so many. Okay, frontier mountains lev 33. Group DISBANDED on a bad pull of giants from the fortress, ran and left while a Chanter and I tried to keep some order. Well it was a losing battle. So being half dead, I decided to just run my buns off as far away from the chanter as possible, maybe try and save him. And my sow was still good. At least that part of the plan worked. I managed to outdistance the initial sg's, but dropped right into a pile of wanderers, who popped me a few times. So, on I ran very low on health. Still making distance though. Ran right into some wandering goblins. They popped my a few times, but I got away, just barely above one bub health I ran a few mins til I knew I was safe ( new to the zone I had no idea where the zone locs were ). I sat and camped out succesfully = ). Right after that I re-entered the world. Right next to a wandering casting goblin, He popped me, I ran, got some distance. Hitting my /loc hot key all the while becuase I was SO lost in this zone. &quot; Goblin soandso casts a spell on you &quot; dropped dead. &quot; Loading Please wait &quot; Which immediately goes to the server login screen ( yup got bumped from the server&nbsp;&nbsp;). BEFORE I could write down the loc of my actual death. Frustrated I went to bed. The next day I searched what must have been ALMOST been the entire zone, no luck, and no luck finding a necro or anyone who had stumbled across my corpse. On the search goes. Finally I give in and petition ( not thinking it would do any good, but, hey I DID use LOC before I died, not my fault I got bumped from the server ). I found a really cool one who hooked me up and waited by my corpse while I tracked her down. While looting, I got aggrod and was forced to run and camp out again. Re-entered the world started looting again, got aggrod, died. No prob I now had loc of corpse, bid my good day to the gm and started out again. Looted corpse, aggrod, died. 6th time is a charm right. Yup I finally looted and moved on. Needless to say it was a rough beginning to my Kunark experience. ( not to mention spiders killed me 3 times near FV and that named lizard caster looking thing nabbed me once ). Thank goodness for the overthere = ). That's my worst death<br><br>Montye</p>&nbsp;<br>True, cities have banks, but alas, I have no money. So why leave the comforts of the wild?</td></tr>

I could still beat on a yellow and expect to come out on top.<br><br>Enter the undead ruins in Qeynos Hills.  They have some dreadbone skeletons that 90% of the characters in EQ would laugh at.  I was not yet at the point where I could laugh at them.  <br><br>I see three people trying a fighting withdrawl aginst these things, so being the helpful ranger that I am I jump in and start beating on them despite their red cons.

Not only was this the largest number of deaths in a row in EQ history it also put me from a couple of blues to 7th back down to just above 5th level.  Needless to say I was REALLY pissed and made it's my lifes work to get high enough to wipe out the entire ruins for an entire game day.  It took me about a week to get there.<br><br>The other memoral death was while I was in Kael Drakkel.  It wasn't during a raid, or a run to WL; I had managed to get the named dragon's tail from EW and was looking for Gleed to turn it in to get my Bow of the Huntsman.  Well I had spent four days killing dwarfs and tracking wolves in GD to get to dubious with the Kromrif; and due to many guild hunts in Skyshrine for guardian and sentry equipment I was warmly to the Kromzek.  <br><br>There is, however, a third faction I'd managed to neglect.  <br><br>I'd managed to track down Gleed and targeted the giant that I belived to be him.  I walk into the room he's in and WHAM!  I suddenly have four giants on me and die in about three quarters of a second.  <br><br>LOADING PLEASE WAIT<br><br>I'm bound in Kael, which is good because it means I don't have far to run naked.  So I manage to memorize spells, zone out to SOW and Camo myself, zone back and and start to where I belive my corpse is; beneath the feet of the supposedly benovelent giant who has my bow.  <br><br>About ten seconds into heading over camo drops.  I figure I didn't need it to get that far so I'd scout arround and see what killed me.  I'm standing on the bridge looking things over, my corpse is where I can see it, but out of range for pulling.  I con the nearby giants and manage to find the one who attacked me.  King Tormax faction makes an instant and ugly impression upon me.  Ready to Attack.  Not pretty.  I use my paltry sneak and hide skill to get close enough to grab my corpse and begin to drag it away from the killer giant.<br><br>Anyone who's spent some time in Kael knows that dragging a KOS corpse is a fast way to a faster death.  I hear the agro tag line of this giant and begin to run for it.  Unfortunitly I'm on a slippery bridge and can't get in purchase.  My corpse falls off the bridge down among the dire wolves below, and I follow it hoping that somehow pathing will save me.  I was wrong.  Four giants fall on top of me, bashing, kicking, stabbing, slashing and biting the entire time.  Now as I'm dying I manage to look up through the blood and brain tissue dripping down my face and see who standing before me raising a mace.  Gleed.  The giant I belived to be in the room across the bridge; he was standing below the bridge I'd twice crossed and twice died crossing, down among the dire wolves who now had two Ratslayer corpses to nibble on.  <br><br>LOADING PLEASE WAIT<br><br>I re-mem, re-buff, re-zone, re-sow, re-camo, re-zone, and re-head for my corpse.  I get there, cammo has, of course, dropped.  I see my corpse in the pit, and fortunitly the giants have all gone back to their spawn spots.  I loot my corpse, clean up my naked corpse and look up to see Gleed grinning at me warmly.  'You bastard,' I think to myself as I walk up to him to collect my bow.  I give him the tail, get the bow and am overjoyed.  Two deaths are worth the amazing piece of equipment I now posess.  <br><br>Here comes the memorable part.  I con Gleed.  He's a nice cheery blue, with no other giants arround and all the wolves milling about at the end of the pit they seem to enjoy so much.  I figure, 'What the hell, you only live thrice,' and let fly at him with my new, uber, procing bow.  What do I see as my arrow connects and he turns to come after me?<br><br>Your will is not sufficent to command this weapon.<br><br>So I'm running to the zone line with a bunch of giants after me, and I almost make it.  Almost.  <br><br>So there it is, hope you enjoy it, and learn from it.   Gleed is under the bridge, not across it.  He shoulda been a troll.<br></p>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

One of the Ivy quests for my lvl 30 ranger required killing Slaythe the Slayer in Lower Guk, a live Froglok. I had been on a tear with my Ivy quests and figured I could continue my luck in Guk. <br><br>Not having been anywhere near Guk before, I decided I would wander there myself and get advice from those people camping the zone. When I get to Upper Guk the Frogloks conned indifferent to me, nice. So I am wandering around Upper Guk when I come across a 34 Warrior girl and ask her to lead me to Lower Guk. She does, but when I zone in, it is not the green cons from above but lots of yellow and reds. That would require lots of backup, so I decided to head home and wait for guild.<br><br>Just as I am leaving the warrior is mobbed and I decide to do the friendly thing and heal. Oh no, she kills the thing and I take a faction hit. Now I know getting out is going to be more painful.<br><br>I zone into Upper Guk and 95% of my track is green. So i start walking, and no froglok gives me a second look. But this tunnel isn't looking very familiar, and I proceed to walk into a room where there is a light blue con. He decides to play the hero, and his 2 green friends join in. <br><br>I have no idea why but I decide to evacuate even though they could barely hit me. I mean, I can find the way out or even a zone back into Lower Guk, right? So I just start running, with Sow I am twice as fast as these guys. But now, everything is aggroing me. With my speed and since they were mostly green, I honestly ran for like 5 minutes and picked up no less than 40 Forgloks. I was running so crazy I would double back and see frogloks I had aggroed earlier who had already given up on me.<br><br>Well, I finally ended up in a room full of casters and committed to a battle royale of me versus Upper Guk. Not pretty. The extraction of my corpse was another adventure, but all in all it was by far the most memorable death.<br><br>Moseby<br>Ranger of the 39th Season<br>Kindred Spirit Guardians<br>Druzzil Ro</p>&nbsp;<br>Moseby Dirtysouth<br>50 Ranger<br>Druzzil Ro<br>Kindred Spirit Guardians</td></tr>

I must admit, their are plenty to choose from. So here's a small sampling.<br><br>It's my first day in the game ever, and Lashara is a level 1 naked wood elf wandering around the Faydark. I had never played the game before, and my boyfriend was on the way to come help me get accustomed. He send me a tell. &quot;Just go down the lift to the newbie garden and hunt there. I'll be there in a few minutes.&quot; Newbie garden? Where's that? So I head down the lift and wander around for a bit. Suddenly...<br>An orc centurion hits YOU for 8 points of damage.<br>An orc centurion hits YOU for 3 points of damage.<br>I start running. I don't know where I'm going, but I'm running to get there. My first death, lying naked in the Greater Faydark with 4 cents beating on me, and without a CLUE as to where I died.<br>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br><br>-- <br><br>I'm about 12th level, and hunting somewhere in the Commons. A lion attacks me, and I was soloing. He cons yellow to me, but seeing as I was too far from the zone to run, I attack the lion. Five minutes later, the lion is laying dead at my feet. No without a lot of work, mind you. I am completely out of mana and have a total of around 6 hit points to my name. Whew! I said, and sat down in my safe spot to rest and recuperate. Suddenly....YOU have been hit for 3 points of damage! I look up from my book and there's the measly goblin who is so green to me it isn't funny, smashing on me because I am sitting in his seat. Under normal conditions I would have healed myself, but remember I am out of mana. I get the goblin down to half health before:<br>A goblin hits YOU for 6 points of damage!<br>YOU die!<br>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT....<br><br>Grrrrrr.<br>--<br><br>About 16 levels after this (level 28), Lashara is huting in the Frontier Mountains. Or she was. Being over-encumbered, and out of arrows, she decides to make the long, and dangerous trek bck to the city of Firiona Vie. All goes well until she actually enters the FV zone. It is twilight, the time of day when the drachnids are most abundant. Our ranger casts Camo on herself (SoW was still up) and starts running along the bank of the river, conning each mob to make sure it can't see her. And then, about halfway to FV....<br><br>&quot;You feel yourself starting to appear.&quot;<br><br>The words that poured out of my mouth at that point are not found in any dictionary. Two seconds later I am no longer invisible, and about 20 drachnids have their attention focused solely on me. I start to run.<br>At the end of the river, by the big Iksar statue, I see an Iksar standing there. Wishing to warn of him the huge string of trouble following me, and perhaps enlist some help, I do a /yell. As I run by, I notice his name is Vekis. And then....<br><br>Vekis begins to cast a spell.<br>You have been hit by non-melee for 665 points of damage!<br>He was a level 56 NPC Iksar Necromancer.<br><br>By now, I am in big sh*t. But with SoW on I am starting to outdistance the drachnids and they haven't rooted me. I run past the guards to the bridge, and breathe a sigh of relief. I am safe.<br><br>WRONG.<br><br>Pain and suffering tries to strike YOU, but misses!<br>YOU die!<br>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br><br>In my terrfied flight across the map, one of the drachnids has poisoned me. It worked out pretty well for him, I guess. I was pissed.<br><br>And those my friends, are my 3 most memorable deaths.</p>&nbsp;<br>Lashara Dyran<br>Keeper of the Wolves<br>Forest Stalker of Lanys T'Vyl<br></td></tr>

We were already in wild melee with all the legos and whatnot in the throne room.  Bam, Bam, Bam - three group memebrs die and everyone starts to run.  I ran striaght for the window and jumped right out.  Problem was I was sowed and not too used to the speed yet.  I ran straight at the moat and fell in.  The huge train followed the others to the zone, so I was safe for a moment.  Well, my swimming was already pretty good, but I couldn't get up that damn ladder.  I kept getting to the top and falling back in.  Soon I see the other two groups members died before they reached the zone, so, of course the entire gang of orcs is heading back to take care of me along with everthing else they pick up along the way.  D'vinn was the first to jump in the water with me.  I began to swim.  Being sowed and a pretty good swimmer, I began to out pace him.<br><br>The problem was I was also aggroing evrything along the topside of the moat.  By now the rest of the train had jumped in the moat.  I knew I was going to die when I got back to the ladder in front (I swam all the way around), so I took a great screen shot of me with about 30 orcs and D'vinn swimming after me.  Too bad I lost that picture, it was a classic.  LOADING......<br><br>When I got back I jumped in to retrieve my corpse.  There were a million tells going around and /ooc and group talk and I wasn't paying attention to my air meter.  LOADING......two corpses.  Same spot.  <br><br>I waited awhile and went back again.  Jumped in and began looting the first corpse.  For some bizarre reason Crush was still swimming in the moat and proceeding to beat on me.  Once again I couldn't get up the ladder.  LOADING......three corpses.  Same spot.<br><br>The good thing was the next time I went back D'Vinn's corpse was laying on the path.  Nobody was around, and I looted it.  Dragoon Dirk!  WOOT.  First half decent drop I got in EQ.  Looted my three corpses and I lived to fight another day.</p>&nbsp;<br>Ironhom Hammerforge<br>Paladin of Kaladim<br>Chivalric Order<br><br><br><br><br></td></tr>

I was in EW in guild chat tellin em whats going on as I am pulling and fear kiting Tundra Wooly Mammoths, one kill from making 47th lvl. <br><br>I shoot a lone mammoth and run back to coastline and sow drops. Well not paying attention I snare myself. I don't worry cuz I can snare and fear the mammoth. The only problem now is that the fear is being resisted 4 times in a row. Finally fear sticks and Im tearing up the mammoth but the third time the fear is resisted 4 times again. I am backing up and as you know the coastline in EW is cliff I fall for a total of 374dmg. As I climb my way up that mammoth is tearing me up for another 280dmg. I get back up and fear the mammoth by this time my health is below half with damage from falling and fear being resisted but I have mammoth below 1 bub so I say self we can come out on top. Well fear is resisted 2 times again. I am thinking damn I better run and sow myself. So I get distance back and SoW well as SoW lands his snare breaks and bam I get hit and stunned fall off the cliff again hehe Im below 1 bub of health.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I get fear off low on mana from dots and fearing cant cast heal. So I think to myself I should be able to kill it. I start tearing up as it breaks fear early and bam LOADING PLEASE WAIT comes up. As you know 46th is after a hell level.  Well you lose a ton of experience during that level. <br><br>While in Thurgadin I get a cool cleric that says drag ya corpse to GD zone and I will rez hehe 100pp later Im back killing not just one more tundra mammoth but end up having to kill 2 to get 47th finally.

I am so happy I finally made Sage status and it is all due to you guys liking some of my posts. THANK YOU ALL.....<br><br>Alas the whole reason I came up with this post is due to a friend ((Daxargen)) asking me what my most memorable death was due to my level. Trust me I have had may and every time I die I am pretty upset, but find the humor in it when it is brought up later on. Had another one happen to my cleric friend today.<br><br>We were hunting in Dawnshroud Peaks. I was playing my wifes Ranger and we were trying to level. Her to 33, the cleric to 32. Well we got him to DING to 32 and killed a white con to be safe. We went back into the little building to zone back over to Netherbian Liar. He and I were both OOM. Well someone decided not to yell or shout out that he was pulling three of those nasty little shrooms through to the zone. All I saw was Oh crap and I went LD. He got nailed by all three of em and lost a whole yellow bubble of health. He was laughing about it when I called him. He told me that is the 10th time that he has gotten level 32 and lost it. Guess level 30,35,40,45,50,55 are not the only h*ll levels......<br><br>Thank you all for reading this post and making me and my wife chuckle at some of your most memorable deaths...</p>&nbsp;<br>May Karana Bless You All,<br><br>Rauvin Darkfeather<br>Protector of the Great Storm and Follower of Karana</td></tr>
