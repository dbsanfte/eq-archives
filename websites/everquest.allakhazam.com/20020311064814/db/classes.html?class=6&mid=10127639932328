	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hello all, this is a quick and dirty guide on agro and how to hold it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Properly done, a paladin can hold agro better than most any other class.<br><br>First of all, what is it?  Each mob has an 'agro list' or a 'hate list' if you like.  Whoever is at the top of that list is who the mob will attack first, or who the mob will turn to if they advance to the top of the list.  Part of this process of who gets to the top is intuitive and part of it isn't.  For example, let's say you're beating on a mob and then you notice there's another mob in the corner healing the guy you're attacking.  In a lot of cases you're going to engage the healer mob to get him out of the way.  The healer mob just went to the top of your personal 'agro list' and therefore you attack it.  <br><br>Mobs operate in a similar fashion.  If the cleric heals players too quickly, what happens?  The mob goes after him.  If a nuker casts spells too fast, what happens?  Mob goes after the caster.<br><br>In a typical well run group you have a guy called the 'main tank' who is often times also the 'main puller'.  A lot of players mistakenly think this guy just rounds up a bad guy or two and starts to hit it.  His job is a lot more important than that.  His job is to hold agro.  His job is to keep that mob pissed off at him so that the mob never gets it into its head to go after the cleric or nukers.  <br><br>As you might imagine, since this guy is holding the agro he's taking all the hits, and therefore all the damage.  This is why you want someone in there who can take it.  They need to have the AC and the hitpoints to last through the fight.  Also, a high AC and hitpoint player results in better mana efficiency for your casters.  Sure, maybe some Ranger is running around in a ton of hit point gear and somehow has as many hitpoints as you or the warrior, but that Ranger is going to get hit a lot more often.  Therefore the cleric has to heal more often and is oom more often.  To this same end, if you play a paladin you want to focus on AC and hitpoints.  Don't stuff half your inventory with wis items with low AC or resist gear.  You're a warrior class first and foremost.  That stuff has its place but shouldn't be part of your day to day equipment.<br><br>In holding agro there are a few factors.  Damage is of course one of them.  Taunting and spell casting are others.  There are also a few tricks to control agro, such as a monk FD and CotH, that I won't go into here.  <br><br>Generally speaking, faster hitting weapons hold agro better.  Even if the weapon ratio is the same, a faster hitting sword keeps the mob on you.  It's important to know this because paladins often carry 2hs weapons these days, which are generally slower.  If a monk is in your group he's going to hit a lot faster than you and you'll have to work extra hard to hold agro.  Additionally, you should think about haste items sooner rather than later as they will help you hold agro better.<br><br>If you're the main tank you should be mashing the taunt button at all times, whether there's one mob or five.  Agro is very dynamic.  After your group gets into a pulling routine the casters get a sense of the agro.  They get a 'feel' for how well you can hold it and thus how quickly or not they can cast.  If you think to yourself, 'well there's only one mob, no need to taunt', then the casters may overdo it and get agro'd.  <br><br>The worst case of this that I've witnessed was while playing with a shaman as main healer.  He was canabalizing like crazy as we were chain pulling so he was down to about 40% health.  The tank pulled a single and didn't taunt the mob.  Shortly into the fight the shaman healed the tank, which normally would have been okay.  But because the MT hadn't built up enough agro the mob went after the shaman.  Since the shaman was low on hit points at the time he got killed before we could taunt the mob off.  The shaman didn't do anything wrong because he was under the assumption that the tank was holding agro.  The tank is entirely to blame.  The lesson here is not only to stay on that taunt button but to be consistent in your pulls, your agro maintenance, etc.<br><br>Finally there's spells.  This is where paladins can really take control of the situation.  Flash of Light is a very powerful taunting spell.  If the mob you're engaging is within melee range then the mob will not run (i.e. like a fear spell).  You'll build up a ton of agro though.  Be careful with it, however.  <br><br>As every cleric or nuker should know the absolute worst thing to do when a mob comes after them is run.  This is true in most cases even if sow'd.  The best thing he can do is set up a social to tell the rest of the group that he's been agro'd and take a couple hits while the group pulls the mob off.  If your cleric stands still when agro'd then flash of light will pull the mob right off.  If the cleric is running around like a nut, then fol'ing the mob will have the fear affect and you can expect a train.  There are some other caveats with this spell but it is extremely powerful in controlling agro and its uses should be explored.  <br><br>A lot of people refuse to use FoL because they're afraid of the 'fear' factor and causing a train.  It does take some intelligence and discretion to use this spell but the results are definately worth it and far outweigh the rare problem it may cause.<br><br>Next there's stuns.  These are also great for controlling agro.  Let's take the running cleric situation described above.  Your best recourse is the level 30 stun spell.  It is relatively quick casting and (unless resisted) will hault the mob for two seconds, which is more than enough time for the cleric to get out of range while you engage it and regain agro.  You can also hold agro with this stun as well as the others, but the trick here is to mix your stuns up with flash of light.  <br><br>What you don't want to fall into the habit of doing is chain stunning to hold agro.  This eats a lot of mana and since you're casting constantly you're not swinging your weapon and therefore you're losing agro from damage output.  'Feel' the mobs out.  Hit taunt, then cast FoL and then taunt again after that.  Now just hit taunt through the rest of the fight.  Did the mob ever turn away from you?  If so, mix in a stun and another FoL during the fight.  Eventually you'll find a safe threshold and you can hold agro while doing as much damage as possible while using as little mana as possible.<br><br>Holding agro also means being proactive and making sure the group is coordinated.  Here's an example:  I was playing in a group with a wizard and as I was pulling the mob to the group this wizard would cast a powerful DD spell before it reached us.  Let's do the math here.  I smack the mob for say 50 hitpoints and then run back to the group with the mob on my heals.  Then the wizard casts a 250 hitpoint DD.  Where do you think the mob is going next?  That's right!  He's going to claw through that tissue paper that wizards call armor.  Now if that wizard had let the melees get a few swings, taunts and spells in to hold agro he could have nuked safely.<br><br>Here's another example.  I was playing with a group that included a monk and a shadow knight.  SK spells generate a ton of agro as well, particularly their lifetaps.  So there I am taunting, spelling, etc. to hold agro and this SK keeps casting away.  What resulted was we split the agro.  Since the monk was hitting faster and outdamaging us, that meant he moved to the top of the agro list.  <br><br>As main tank you should be aware of what you're groupmates are doing.  Are the casters nuking too fast?  Is the cleric healing too early into the fight?  Is another melee taunting the mob?  <br><br>If you see this stuff you need to speak up because in the end you're only one person.  If that wizard is super trigger happy the mob will go after him, gauranteed.  If the cleric is passing out heals like business cards at an Insurance convention, expect trouble.  <br><br>The last bit regarding tanking and agro is caster mobs.  You should start with Taunt, FoL and then taunt again to build up some agro initially but after that you want to hold off on casting spells because you will need to interupt the mob's spells with your stuns.  So at that point you're only building agro with taunt and damage for the most part.  This is a typical recipe for disaster as the casters will rarely distinguish this and nuke away as they always do.  DD casting mobs can simply be overpowered, but healing mobs are where the problems arise.  <br><br>First of all, you as the paladin want to watch for when the mob starts to heal and hit it with your stuns.  The mob is ussually at 30-50% health at this point.  The key is to keep the mob from healing until it reaches the 'run' stage.  It's at 30-50% when the casters should let them have it as well.  By holding off on the nukes until this time the casters avoid agro and have enough mana to get the job done.  There is nothing worse than having casters be oom while four melees beat on a healing mob only to have that mob just heal itself over and over.  <br><br>That's all I can think of at the moment.  I hope this helps a few people out there have more fun playing EQ.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>This is a great post, but does contain one massive (and common) misconception: Taunt does NOTHING if the mob is already focused on the taunter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Taunt does NOT add aggro in the traditional sense.  What Taunt does, if successful, is moves the taunter to the top of the hate list, just above the current highest target.  So, while a successful Taunt will always draw the mob's attention to the taunter, continued Taunts do NOT add further hate.<br><br>In the example given with the shaman, what most likely happened is one of two things: either the main tank had missed the mob an unusually high number of times (thereby building up less than normal aggro), OR the shaman just plain cast a little too soon.<br><br>The moral here is, if the mob is on you, don't waste your Taunt skill.  The last thing you want is for the mob to turn on a caster, while you sit and wait for Taunt to refresh.<br><br>EDIT TO CLARIFY:<br>Abashi posted this on Verant's Gameplay Forum  in April 2000:<br>&quot;The skill level associated with taunt interacts with your level to determine how likely the taunt is to be successful. It does not control the level of success. A successful taunt will always make the creature shift to you, assuming that it can be taunted (Yes, some creatures are untauntable). <br>Taunt makes a creature hate you just a little bit more than it hates the next guy on the list. In other words, multiple successful taunts, or taunting a creature that is already attacking you doesn't do anything extra. <br><br>I hope that clears up how Taunt works. &quot;<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Feb 15 01:55:08 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Nice post Jcasetnl,<br><br>Here's a couple of other issues to consider regarding aggro.<br><br>Proximity Aggro: Several spells set up a Prxomity Aggro scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example: Root. When a mob is rooted it operates on Proximity Aggro. Whoever is closest usually gets hit. When the mob is rooted, if you are MT, get right up in the mob's face.  You will get most if not all the hits that way.<br><br>Max Melee Range: Proximity to the mob makes a difference whether rooted or not. At the bigger raids like Vindicator, Halls of Testing, Dragons, Boss Mobs, etc. it is proper to stay at Max Melee Range. Max Melee Range is the farthest away from the mob you can be...and still hit it.  This naturally changes from mob to mob. Some mobs have small ranges, others have very BIG ranges.<br><br>Example:  Halls of Testing in the Temple of Veeshan.  The Wurms that are pulled there have HUGE Max Melee Ranges. You can practically stand all the way across the room and still hit the mob due to it's size.  As a general rule, the bigger the mob, the bigger their Range. Likewise, the Drakes that are pulled there have tiny ranges. Everyone has to crowd around the mob to be able to hit it. If you are in a situation where Aggro Control is critical to success: Big Mob Raids, Dragon Raids, Vindicator Raids, Golems in Fear, etc. etc. get in the habit of staying as far away as possible while still hitting. This will help the MT keep aggro since he/she is the only one in the mob's face.<br><br>Weapon Procs: Many weapon procs can draw HUGE aggro.  If you are not the Main Tank and Aggro Control is an issue, you may want to put up that big Proc weapon and go with something that doesn't draw as much Aggro.  Rangers tend to be bad about this. Not only are they dual wielding and hitting fast, they are doing lots of damage AND may be wielding one or TWO proc weapons.  It can be very hard to get the mob off of these guys, but since they don't have the armor, they tend to DIE! RANGE DOWN!!  Don't be afraid to ask them to change weapons.<br><br>Aggro Control with Attacks: On the big raids, aggro control is crucial to success. For the most part, NO ONE is supposed to get hit except the MT, if all goes as planned. If you are on a raid like this, and you draw aggro, turn off attack.  That's right...I said Turn Off Attack. You shouldn't have aggro and you need to get aggro back to where it belongs ASAP. Turn off attack and let the MT take control back.<br><br>Sitting:  Sitting is a big aggro for certain mobs. When mobs are pulled, often times they will IMMEDIATELY go to the caster, cleric, paladin, ranger, whatever who is sitting down, when brought back to the group.  Get used to standing up when the mob is being pulled. Once it's there, and aggro is established, then sit if you need to.<br><br>You can also use this to your advantage in worst case situations. For example, the Ranger has aggro, he's getting torn apart, he's about to die, everyone is OOM or LOM...what can you do? Try sitting down.  Sit down RIGHT next to the mob.  Chances are, he will turn and hit you. The downside, they tend to hit for MAX when you are sitting so expect a good blow or two, but if absolutely necessary, give it a shot. It works sometimes.<br><br>As you continue to level, Aggro control becomes VERY VERY important. Keeping one MT alive is not so hard with a few good clerics, even if he's getting hit for 600 pts a pop!  Practice these things off and on so you're not the Aggro NOOB like I was when you get invited to the big raid!<br><br>Kneesmasher Ayebulger<br>Dwarven Knight<br>Torvonnilous Server<br><br>&quot;Never Mistake Kindness for Weakness&quot;<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>
