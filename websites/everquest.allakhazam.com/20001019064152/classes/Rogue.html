<p><b>Rogues get many unique skills not available to other classes.&nbsp;
Really, this is probably the most unique class in the game.&nbsp; In many
ways, this is why the class is not really a popular one to play, as many
people do not understand how to play, or play with, a rogue.&nbsp; The
most useful skill of a rogue is pickpocketing.&nbsp; All of the rogues
I have played with have disdained looting monster corpses since they make
so much money pick pocketing.&nbsp; Furthermore, since they are limited
in their armor selection and have no magic, they don't need to spend a
lot on armor and spells.&nbsp; Never ignore the benefits of wealth.&nbsp;
Rogues also get the sneak, hide and evade skills which make them very good
scouts and give them the ability to escape from battles where others would
die.&nbsp; Rogues are also more resistant to poison than other classes,
gaining +8 to poison resistance.&nbsp; They can make poison and poison
their weapons to do extra damage in combat.&nbsp; They also get back stab,
which is a great skill to have when grouping.&nbsp; Let the fighter start
in on the creature, get behind it and stab it hard and fast.&nbsp; With
their superior speed, backstabbing, poisoned weapons and dual wielding,
rogues can often outdamage a warrior in a battle.&nbsp; They just have
less of an ability to take damage.&nbsp; They can be soloed, but only with
a lot of difficulty, and are generally much more effective in a group,
even at lower levels. Unfortunately, many people don't know how to handle
a rogue in a group, so it is often tough to find a group willing to take
you in.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a tricky class to play since it doesn't fit
easily into any mold, but can be one of the more interesting and enjoyable
classes.</b><b></b>
