<font color="#000000"></font>
<p><br><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><b><font color="#000000">A little note before we go any further. This
is how I choose to equip and level Adaster. This isn't how you have to
do it. I just wanted to share with people the pros and con's of being a
Dark Elf Shadow Knight. I spent a lot of time on the Internet compiling
data. Most of what I have read is either out of date or just plain wrong.
Two sights that I highly recommend are <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq">http://www.gameznet.com/eq</a>
and
<a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com">http://everquest.allakhazam.com</a>.
J.C. Smiths Shadow Knight guide rocks its hands down the best guide I have
read to date. The only thing I disagree with J.C. is Dark Elf's make the
best Shadow Knight's and we are way prettier then Trolls:-). Allakazams
web page is the 800-ton gorilla of EQ web sites. If you have a question
I guarantee one of these sights has the answer.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Having played a Wizard, Druid, and Enchanter.
I decided it was time to take a stab at melee class. I considered a straight
Warrior, but decided against because I tend to solo. So that left me with
Rogue, Shadow Knight, Paladin, Ranger or Monk. I had no interest in being
a Ranger because it was to close to playing a Druid. I have never had an
interest in playing a Monk. Now with that being said. These last few months
I have had the opportunity to group with a Monk. Monk's rock when it comes
to Melee. Rogue's where still hosed when I started Adaster. So that left
me with two choices. The classic battle good versus evil, Paladin or Shadow
Knight. Paladins, do gooders, get good grades in school. Listens to country
music. Goes to church on Sunday. They think Wild Turkey is something you
hunt. They always help old ladies. Shadow Knights, evil mean creatures.
Skip school to hang out in pool halls. Listen to rock and roll. They know
Wild Turkey is something you drink. So hung over on Sunday they make their
Gnome neighbors mow their yard. Rather push an old lady in front of a bus
then help her on it. I chose a Shadow Knight. What can I say I'm evil baby!</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Having chose a class, now I had to choose a
race. Your choices are Dark Elf, Erudite, Iksar, Human, Ogre and Troll.
Now at the time I started Adaster, Erudite and Iksar where not choices
you could make. I decided against Human because they are as blind as a
bat at night. It was hard not to choose Ogre or Troll because the starting
STR is so high. But giving the fact the Shadow Knight's get a hybrid penalty
hit on experience. And Troll and Ogre take a penalty hit for race I decided
to go with a Dark Elf. I pumped 10 into STR, I put 5 into STA, 5 into Dex.
Looking back I should have pumped it all into STR. But hindsight is 20-20.
Adaster's naked stats are STR 80 STA 75 AGI 90 DEX 80 WIS 83 CHA 65 I hit
enter and on February 26<sup>th</sup> 2000 Adaster was born. As you can
see the biggest disadvantage to playing a Dark Elf Shadow Knight is you're
a 98-pound Weakling.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Your first mission in life is to find your
Shadow Knight guild master. This is no easy feat. Its about as far away
in the Neriak Foreign Quarter as you can go. First off before you head
to your guild master re-map your attack key. I moved mine to the forward
slash on my number pad. If not it will only be a matter of time before
you hit A and end up getting your head pounded in my someone 50 levels
higher then you.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Ok now you're in the Shadow Knight guild. Give
your note to your guild master. He tells you what a stud you are. You're
feeling food. Now its time to go kick some monster butt.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Head to Nektulos Forrest the Dark Elf newbie
ground. Start killing typical newbie monsters. Moss snakes, fire beetles,
decaying skeletons, spiderlings, black wolves, shadow wolves, black bears,
skeletons, large spiders, tree snakes. Keep killing until your level 5.
Once you hit level 5 its time to head to Innothule Swamp.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Now I know plenty of you are saying why not
East Commons or Lavastorm. The number of mobs in the swamp is unreal. You
can't move without running into a mob its kill, kill kill, level, level
and level in the swamp. In Lavastorm you have Fire Elementals that jump
you while you're trying to rest. In Commons where bears and skeletons are
harassing you all the time. No in the swamp choose a nice quite zone wall
and rest there all day if you like. And you can buy and sell in Grobb.
Stay in the swamp killing until you hit level 9 and then head back to Neriak.
Remember while you're in Neriak put a point into Bash. You picked this
skill up at level six.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Now that you're back in Neriak you need to
buy your level 9 spells.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Disease Cloud</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000">This spell will disease your opponent and
does a small amount of damage initially as well. This is also a great spell
for taunting a mob. It does very little damage but its great for taunting
a mob of your healer or a trigger-happy mage. This spell is in my first
spell slot.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Lifetap</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Cast this spell on the mob it will take 5 hit
points from the mob and give them to you.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Invisibility to Undead</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">This spell renders you invisible to undead
mobs. Great spell and a must if you're in Befallen. And much later in Unrest
and Lower Guk.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Locate Corpse</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000">This spell will point you in the direction
of the nearest corpse. Must people don't know Shadow Knights have this
spell. So if you see someone /ooc for a Bard or Necro give them a tell
and tell them you can locate corpses also.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Leering Corpse</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000">This spell will summon a level 3-5 skeletal
pet. You also need two bone chips. Now a lot of people will tell you your
pet is useless. But I have also heard Druids tell me thorns are useless.
It just isn't true folks. But after spending some time experimenting the
other day I was shocked at the results I got using a pet Vs not using a
pet. I will go into more detail about pets a little later. I highly recommend
using a pet at every level. The only time I would recommend not using a
pet is if you're in a dungeon and mobs are going to aggo it. For now think
of your pet as a DoT. He won't do an enormous amount of damage, but he
will do damage over time.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Sense Undead</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000">This spell will point you in the direction
of the nearest undead monster. Kind of a useless spell.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Siphon Strength</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000">Takes 10 Str from the mobs and gives it to
you. This spell I still use its in my second spell slot.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Now your &frac34; Warrior and &frac14; Necromancer.
You're still a 98-pound weakling with mouse for a pet. Hang in their things
will start looking up. From level 9 until level 20 is one of the hardest
for a Shadow Knight. Get prepared to die a lot. This is your training camp
so to speak. Tying to take a mob that cons even to you. Soloing will got
you more experience faster. I strongly encourage you to spend at least
half your playing time in a group. The higher level you get the harder
it is to solo mobs. If you spend your first 30 levels soloing your not
going to have a clue how to be a tank in a group. It's important to understand
your role as a tank in a group. The other important thing is to understand
how different group make up determine how you play a Shadow Knight. A classic
example is being in Cazic-Thule in a group with out a Druid or Ranger.
It becomes your job to cast Engulfing Darkness to snare the mob. If you
don't your not gonna live in Cazic long or any other dungeon for that matter.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">From 9 to level 20 there are some pretty important
milestones you will hit. Level 10 you get Dodge. Level 12 you get meditate.
You regain you mana back at a faster rate when you meditate. Now this is
extremely important for a Dark Elf Shadow Knight. Remember we gave up STR
and faster hit point regeneration for higher mana. You will be noticing
a big difference at the rate your mana comes back when you meditate. Level
17 we get Parry. At level 20 three big things happen. First is the damage
cap Verent put on us is lifted. Now your damage is determined by the weapon
you have and your strength and level. You will see a big difference in
the amount of damage you do. Second it you get Double Attack at 20. Third
is you get to choose your last name.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">At level 15 you get your second rank of spells.
You can buy them in Freeport, Ogguk, Grobb, or Neriak. There are a couple
of really nice ones here that let you reverse kite mobs. I will get to
reverse kiting in a few.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Lifespike</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Lifetap self only take 11 hit points from the
mob and gives them to you. An ok spell.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Bonewalk</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000">This spell will summon a level 7-9 skeletal
pet. A key player in the reverse kiting technique.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Clinging Darkness</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000">This is duration of time spell that causes
damage over time. And works similar to a snare spell. Another very important
step in reverse kiting.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Endure Cold</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000">This spell adds to the targets resistance
to cold. Comes in handy if your fighting mobs that can cast cold base spells.
It will reduce the amount of damage you take. And you can cast it on other
party members to help with buffing.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Fear</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000">Fear will cause your opponent to turn and
run away at full speed making it hard to attack at a dead run. However
if you cast Clinging Darkness first your mob is slowed, then cast fear.
Your mob will walk away allowing you to hit the mob from behind. The mob
takes more damage with his back turned to you. You pet is beating the crap
out of the mob. And the best part of all is YOUR not getting hit. AKA reverse
kiting.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Mend bones</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000">This spell allows you to heal your pet. A
useless spell. Your pet is such a wienie very seldom does it ever survive
a battle. And even if it does your so beat up the pet is a full health
way before you.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Numb the dead</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Numb the dead is an undead calming spell. By
casting this spell on undead beings you will cause them not to attack players
they would normally attack. It cost's a bone chip and can fail resulting
in you training yourself. However if there is no one else in your group
with this ability it can help you pull. I can't tell you how many times
I died in Unrest when this spell fails.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Shadow Step</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000">This spell is a quick casting random mini
teleportation spell that will teleport you a short distance away from your
current location. Use it to escape from a mob. Key words here RANDOM, meaning
it can teleport you into an even worse situation. NEVER use this in a dungeon.
It will make matter worse almost every time. The worst is no clue where
your corpse is. It is very useful in dueling another player though.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">From level 15 to level 22 you can have a blast
in soloing Gators in Oasis, Griffawns in North Karana. Gnolls and Gnoll
Reavers in East Karana. You can master your reverse kiting technique. A
couple of thing about reverse kiting. First off, it won't work in a dungeon.
The mob will bring back to many friends. The secret to soloing with a Shadow
Knight is not to take damage. You don't have anyway to heal yourself. So
master reverse kiting and find yourself able to solo a couple of blue mobs
before you have to rest.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Bind wound is another very important skill
to max early. It will allow you to bandage yourself back to half health.
If there is no healer to heal you this can save your life many times over.
And even if there is a healer bind wound yourself back to half health to
save your healer mana. Spend the money on bandages and keep bind wound
maxed. Don't throw your copper and silver on the ground. It's like throwing
Band-Aids on the ground.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Weapons skills such as 1hs, 2hs, bash, 1hb
keep maxed out. Keep a weapon of each class even if it's a rusty one. When
you level switch though each weapon until your skill goes up 5 and then
switch to the new weapon. Now early on it will be hard to do because you
will level faster then you can max your skills but don't worry just keep
at it. There are some really cool weapons coming out of Kunark for Shadow
Knights. And if you don't keep your skills maxed it is very hard to make
them up later.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Once you hit 22 it's time to head to Cazic-Thule
and start on your Darkforge Armor Quests. Cazic-Thule will be your new
home for the next ten levels. Do not go to Cazic thinking your gonna get
your Darkforge Armor in a day or so. The only thing that drops Decaying
Armor is Lizard Crusaders. To give you an idea if you spend a full 8-hour
day in Cazic you might see 4-5 Crusaders. It won't do a whole lot of good
to /ooc looking for Decaying Armor. The zone is full of SK's and people
twinking SK's so very seldom will you get any help this way. That being
said. When your group forms let them know what pieces of Decaying Armor
you need. If you're the only SK in the group you should be able to loot
anything you need. But say something right up front. I can't tell you how
many times I have had group member's loot Decaying Armor because they want
to do the quest and sell the armor. If you tell your group up front what
you need most will be more then happy to help. A nice bonus to doing the
DF Armor Quest is almost a half of bubble experience for each piece you
turn into the Undead Knights in the Temple of Solusk Ro. The follow is
a list of components you need for each piece.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Darkforge Helm: Requires one decaying, one
decaying visor, two Freeport Militia Helms.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Darkforge Breastplate: Requires decaying breastplate,
decaying mail, and two enchanted bars of platinum.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Darkforge Bracers: Requires left and right
decaying bracer, broken Minotaur Lord Horn (Steamfront Mino Caves)*Note
you have to do this quest twice. You only get one bracer each time you
do the quest. Also the Minotaur Lord conned even to me at 29 and was beating
the crap out of a level 30+ group.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Darkforge Vambraces: Requires decaying vambraces
left and right, Qeynos Kite Shield. Qeynos Guards drop these. Easiest place
to get one is guard Fredrick at the Wizard Portal in North Karana. He is
level 27-32 depending on the spawn.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Darkforge Gauntlets: Requires left and right
decaying gauntlet and one bar enchanted platinum.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Darkforge Greaves: Requires left and right
decaying greaves and two Melatite. (Melatite comes from the clockwork gnomes
in Sol A)</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Darkforge Boots: Requires left and right decaying
boots and two faerie dusts. (Faeries are in Greater Faydark. The dust you
need is white not yellow.) Be very careful here. There are roaming level
45 guards here. Any evil race will be KOS here.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">At 22 you get your third ring of spells they
are as listed. You are becoming a formidable tank now. This coupled with
the increase in hybrid mana pools makes you a one SK wrecking ball</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Convoke Shadow</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Summons a skeleton pet. Level 11-13</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Dark Empathy</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Single target crappy heals that you can't use
on yourself. It takes hit points away from you and gives them to another
player.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Deadeye</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Self Only See Invisible, Infravision a very
good spell if you're not a Dark Elf because it also gives you Infravision
the ability to see better at night. The rub is its self only. If you are
a Dark Elf you will still use the see invis portion of this spell. I'm
sure our Human Shadow Knight brothers love this spell.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Engulfing Darkness</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Upgrade to Clinging Darkness does about 110
damage over time and has a snare effect. Very useful spell. It does get
resisted a fair amount of times. A must in reverse kiting.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Spook the Dead</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Undead Fear spell very mana efficient. If your
fighting undead this spell rocks combined with Engulfing Darkness, your
pet and Ward Undead. Lasts anywhere from 3-18 seconds.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Vampiric Embrace</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Works like a proc on a weapon it randomly goes
off doing 15 damage at level 30. I cast this before every battle. It takes
15 hit points from the mob and gives them to you. Last about two minutes.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Ward Undead</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Direct Damage Undead only spell. A must in
Befallen, Unrest or anytime your fighting undead mobs.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">From levels 22 to 29 you don't pick up any
additional skills. If you stay in Cazic-Thule from 22-30 you should just
about have all your Darkforge Armor. Some other great places to hunt are
Lake of Ill Omen in Kunark, Warslick Woods, Upper Guk, Unrest, and Sol
A.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">When you hit 30 you pick up Riposte. And you
also your 4<sup>th</sup> ranked spells.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Endure Disease</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000">This spell will increase your resistance to
disease. Used much in the same way as Endure Cold. Has a use in certain
circumstances.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Feign Death</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000">This spell allows you to play dead. It's important
to understand when to use this spell. If a mob is casting on you wait until
it's done before you feign death. Also try and cast it if the mobs are
not hitting you.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Gather Shadows</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000">Gather Shadows is an invisibility spell that
can only be cast on you. I can't tell you how easy this spell makes your
life. You can travel anywhere you want now. The rub is its self only. But
you are one of the few classes that have invisibility and invisibility
to undead. Very useful indeed in lower guk.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Heat Blood</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000">This is a damage over time spell that does
about 170 damage. It can be stacked with clinging darkness. Together a
very lethal combination of spells. Reverse kiting just got easier.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Restless Bones</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000">Restless bones will summon a level 16ish pet.
Reverse kiting just got easier.</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000000">Wave of Enfeeblement</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000">Wave of Enfeeblement is an area effect weaken
spell. I have a hard time finding a use for this spell.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Lifedraw</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Takes 42-45 damage from the mob and gives it
to you. Very nice spell!</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000000">Life after 30 with a Shadow Knight gets much
easier. I have to admit I almost couldn't get Adaster to 20. Shadow Knight's
level slow. I really didn't enjoy playing Adaster until the high teens.
Now though as we embark though our 30's playing him is a blast. This coupled
with Verant doubling hybrid mana pools and I'm having the time of my life
right now. My plan as of right now is to hang in Cazic-Thule until level
32. From there head to the Bedroom in Lower Guk. Then from there head to
Sol B Tiger Room until I hit 45. And when I get bored checking out the
dungeons in Kunark.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">I spend a lot of cash on buying sow potions.
I recommend investing in Invis Potions until you hit level 30. Some nasty
deaths have come after going link dead in Cazic or Guk and nobody is around
to invis you.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">More on Shadow Knight Pets</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">By J.C. Smith</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Some players will tell you that a Shadow Knight
pet is useless. This simply isn't true. A Shadow Knights pet may be low
level in comparison to that Shadow Knight. This is true. A pet does damage
though. It may not be a lot of damage but it is extra damage during the
course of a battle. When you take into consideration the amount of damage
that your pet does compared to the amount of mana it took to summon him
then you will find it to be very efficient when compared to other spells.
A pet can also be used to save you a few seconds when fleeing the battle
scene. Those couple of seconds could save your life. One thing that should
be noted is that your pet will not make a very good tank. You should not
allow him to absorb very much damage or he will die. One thing you should
always do when summoning a pet is use the /pet notaunt command. This will
prevent him from taunting and being killed.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Other useful pet commands include:</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">/pet follow me - This will inform your pet
to follow you.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000">/pet guard here - This is a very useful command
when fetching or when pulling to a particular location. Your pet will assist
you in any battles which take place near him. After the battle is over
he will return to the spot that you told him to guard.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000">/pet attack - This command will order your
pet to attack whoever or whatever you have targeted.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000">/pet report health - This command will cause
your pet to tell you what percentage of his total hit points he currently
has.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000">/pet sit down - This command will tell your
pet to sit where he is currently located. I have not found this to increase
healing time in any way so I would recommend using /pet guard here instead
or else you will have to issue this command after every battle.</font></b>
