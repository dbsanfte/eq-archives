<p><b>Once you get attacked you are in trouble.&nbsp; But, if you have
some nice tank taking the damage up front you can really kick some serious
butt.&nbsp; The wizard's forte is doing massive amounts of damage in a
short time.&nbsp; Wizards also get the best area of effect spells, though
these spells are very difficult to use without drawing a mob onto you.&nbsp;
Other magic classes can do more damage over the long run, but wizards can
kill something quickly when necessary.&nbsp; Wizards also get teleport
spells, which make it very easy to navigate to all corners of the world.&nbsp;
One big drawback is that wizards are the most mana reliant class in the
game, and unlike the pet classes are virtually useless when they run out
of mana.&nbsp; Wizards are fairly popular and can usually find a group,
especially at higher levels where the wizards ability to evacuate a group
in trouble makes him invaluable. The wizard is not an easy class to play.&nbsp;
Because he is all attack and no defense, he must approach a battle warily.&nbsp;
But it is really impressive when you take down that monster in one shot
that the fighters were battling for five minutes.&nbsp; Wizards can be
soloed, but only if played perfectly, and are not nearly as good at soloing
as magicians or necros.&nbsp; If you play a wizard, be prepared to spend
a lot of time staring at the inside of your spell book.</b>
