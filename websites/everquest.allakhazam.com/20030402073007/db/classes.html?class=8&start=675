	   <tr><td colspan=2>At level 13 consider joining derv groups in NRo (derv 3 preferbly, slighly higher level dervs), or Croc groups in Oasis.<br><br>Once you hit 15 or so join Orc groups in oasis. Orc highway gives good xp till your high teens and AWESOME loot. Rawhide armor, bronze weapons, and gold to plat in cash. In an average group you can make 20-30pp in two hours or so, in a group of twinks who let you loot all (my frined had this happen) you can make upwards of 60pp in that same time span.<br><br>Once you hit 14-15 a good place if you like soloing is lavastorm. Sit inside the hallway to Najena and you can actually tank some of the stuff to work your combat skills (it'll be one of oyur last chances to do it), or kite along the N-S wall. Just watch out on the run through the Nek to get there, DE's don't like you, and the pirhanna in the lake you gotta cross are mean if you have low swimming. Camo is a must.<br><br>Truth be told their are alot of excellant places to hunt both group and solo at your level. I highly recommend checking out EQatlas, a subsite of this one, and looking at their zone by level chart. Pick one you'll have fun in! You have alot of options.<br><br>As a final note you can also consider the warrens. Even with stonebrunt open it's not too crowded, and the prince side (to your right when you enter from painell zone) is right around the 14+ level. Heck when i was 18 or so i'd solo the pitfighters carefully (so i'd only get them) and while only being slightly twinked over my level (MAYBE mid 20's gear) i could usually kill both for good xp, molars for erudin or painell faction, and pti fighter hand and ankle wraps that'd sell for 5-10pp to monks. Not to mention the weapon i'd sometimes get that'd sell for 2-5pp to vendors.<br><br>Hope all this helps.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>/em sits down and attempts to bandage back her level.<br><br>So, I have to hold a guild meeting. It was non-formal, so ofcourse, only a few people are able to make it. :) I'm thinking that since we are all 4 in Gfay, why not hunt something here. I had scouted the Shadow Men in Lfay a few nights ago, and they were Yellow to me.<br><br>(Those of you experienced are probably seeing my error here, right?)<br><br>Surely 4 of us, all right around the same level (I had just made 22) should be able to take a yellow con and it's pet one at a time.<br><br>(This is an easy assumption to make. I was still high on the fact that the dark elf priestess, whose wandering was apparently activated by a DE hunter in Lfay, I saw him take down 3 DE's single handedly, had happened upon me, and did not kill me in one hit, as Red Cons so often did. Surely if a Red Con couldn't kill me in one hit, I should be able to survive a Yellow long enough for the group to finish it off.)<br><br>Now, I was smart. Everyone present had a magical weapons and I had my Expulse summoned spell up. Two Pallys, so one could tank, and the other heal. And the Rogue could backstab. What better tactic can you get?<br><br>We *should* have been able to handle it<br><br>Should, being the operative word.<br><br>Well, I camo us to the Obelisk and we set up camp. Then, I go to pull. They are close together, so I pick out the highest Con and cast Harmony.<br><br>I see the pink Aura.<br><br>All is well. I call out "Ready?"<br><br>I get affirmatives back.<br><br>So, I cast and call "Incoming"<br><br>The first thing that happens is I see:<br><br>You have lost control of your body.<br><br>I type: "Dang it!"<br><br>I then see:<br><br>A Shadowed Man casts a spell.<br>You take 176 points of damage<br>You are slain by a Shadowed Man.<br><br>Ok, that did not go well. Then, I see the rest of my group, will full Health bars. Now, I had bound them all at the wizard spires. I myself was bound at the entrance to Lfay in Gfay. But I didn't see them wander by. Ofcourse, the plan was if things went bad they were to high-tail it to the Steamfont zone.<br><br>One of them, I would find out, had almost made it. The two Pally, in game husband and wife, died one on top of the other. How Shakespearian.<br><br>heh heh. It seems that my Harmony did not work as well as it was supposed to.<br><br>Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.<br><br>So, my lesson for the day? Be very careful of what you pull.<br><br>Now, does anyone know how you sucessfully pull one of these devils?<br><br>Tatiyanna<br>&nbsp;<br>"In waking a tiger, use a very long stick." -Mao Tse-Tung.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>If you can kill a HG at 31, that's great. However, HG xp is nerfed to start with, and secondly, if gaining levels is the goal, LOW blues are the best xp, by far.<br><br>My druid is 54 now. I started 54 yesterday, and should be halfway done by the end of today. That's one of the BIG hell levels. Where am I soloing? DL. That's right, DL!<br><br>Here's why it works. All mob xp is based on mob level squared. The xp multiplier and zone multiplier will be the same for mobs in the same zone, so rule those out. Now, at 54, a L42+ mob is still blue to me. This includes all ravishings, and some ragers, petrifiers, brutes, recluse, widows, and steeps.<br><br>A L42 mob takes me the following spells to kill: snare, root, ro's fiery sundering, 52 dot, 53 dot, and (free) dot from arms, for a total of 785 mana. 42 squared is 1764. (This number is then multiplied by some other numbers, but since comparing mobs in same zone, common factors can be ruled out.) So, call this 1764 the xp factor. So 785 mana for a 1764 xp factor. So divide the xp_factor/mana_cost and you get 2.25. The higher this number, the more xp you get per bubble of mana medded. Now, take a L45 ravishing in the same zone. These take the following spells to kill: snare, root, ro's fiery sundering, 52 dot, 53 dot, arms dot, 53 dot, arms dot, for a total of 1135 mana for an xp_factor of 45 squared, which is 2025. 2025/1135 is 1.78. So, clearly, the L42 mobs produce more xp per unit of time than the L45 mobs. Now, I *could* kill L50 mobs. I killed one when I was 51, mainly using my arms, and it took all my mana (and tons of arm dots), and 30 minutes, so obviously THAT is horrible xp, two mobs per hour. At 54 I could kill more L50 mobs per hour, but it still would not compare to the xp gained from killing massive quantities of L42 mobs.<br><br>So, it should be obvious that the very lowest possible blues you can kill are THE best xp, at least at levels &gt;30 or so. A druid friend of mine, who was 53 when I was 46, was killing upper 40s mobs in BW. By the time he hit 54, I also hit 54, and now I have MORE xp than him. Simply by killing LOW blue mobs I caught up SEVEN LEVELS, over about two or three weeks. Granted, I did play more than him too, but still, the main reason I caught up so easily was that he was killing high blues, while I was killing much more efficient low blues.<br><br>The math is really incontrovertable, as my xp bar shows me after each hour. If there are enough low blues to kill, it is quite hard to come close to that xp with any group in any zone, at least reliably. I'm not saying that soloing should always be your only course; it shouldn't. I am just attempting to point out that if gaining levels is the goal, and you wish to solo to do it, then the most time efficient way possible is by killing low blues. So many make the mistake of killing the TOUGHEST mobs they possibly can, when this produces quite inferior xp over any period of time.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hail<br><br>From my extensive experience i have decided to share with you what i know, and hopefully make your lives a bit easier (Yes I'm bored because the servers are acting crazy so i can't play)<br><br>I started at lvl 1 with NOTHING,only the things you get when you start a char,so i was totally untwinked and you don't need to be super uber to use these strategies.<br><br>Lvl 1-9<br><br>Well not much I can say here, hunt in your local newbie area, If you are lucky a bored higher lvl may give you a Pwrlvl, but not likely. Just grind through these early lvls<br><br>Lvl 9-16<br><br>I like going to places way before i actually should, at this lvl its good to go to Oasis of Marr,find a partner and kill stuff, caimans,madmen etc. However be careful as there are many high lvl creatures here e.g Sand Giants,Specs. This is GREAT xp till lvl 16, if you are a twink you can solo here<br><br>Lvl 16-20<br><br>These are very fun lvls, there is one place that stands head and shoulders above the rest, LAKE RATHETEAR. It is fanctastic xp,get a few peeps (always alot here) and start fighting, you will hit 20 in no time<br>P.S If you are camping the flame tower,WATCH OUT for Webclaw Murkwave,nukes for 170 and will kill you very fast,always pull away from ramp as he spawns at the bottom<br><br>Also you can head to lavastorm mountains and kite elementals, however unless you have high wis don't do this<br><br>Lvl 20-26<br><br>A few options here, the best of which is Lake of Ill omen. Find a group at the sarnak fortress,its CRAZY xp,at 25 ish it may slow down a bit and I tended toward soloing at this lvl. Also you can try the Goblin Tower near the fort.<br><br>(May try SolA but its mostly deserted)<br><br>Lvl 26-30<br><br>2 Great options here<br><br>1) Go to the Frontier Mountains and find a giant fort group, great xp and loot,bind OUTSIDE the fort against the wall and you will be finem these guys hit hard so look out.<br><br>2)Paw, in the heart of South Karana is Paw,the Gnoll-infested dungeon. This place has a significant xp bonus and if you get a group down here, the&nbsp;&nbsp;xp will roll in.<br><br>Lvl 30-34<br><br>Overthere,pretty much no other choice,good xp and loot is ok,not very pleasant lvls, OT can get VERY boring, but bear with it.<br><br>P.S WATCH OUT for the goons,they are 50+ Dark elf guards that come out at night and will smack you silly within seconds, they also run MUCH faster than SoW and Wolf form, I myself have fallen many times to their rusty blades.None of them see invis as I recall(Not even General)<br><br>Lvl 34-36/37<br><br>You can stay in OT but i just got SOOO bored,i found a great QUAD kiting spot,at 34 you get a spell:lightning strike,hits 4 mobs for 170 ish damage. Now go to Butherblock Mountains and head to the Gfay ent, turn around and head down the path to X-roads,turn right and keep going untill you reach a pass,take the right road,there is a camp with 4 goblin spawns,they are easy to kill,snare each one and run around in a big circle to round 'em up,the cast 'till dead.<br><br>Lvl 36/7 to 40<br><br>Go to WK and run to the very opposite from the NK zone,you will track 2 guards near the barb village,the one is 34 ish i think and the other is 38 ish,kill them both,good xp but there is a bonus,they drop GUARD BRACELETS,these can be handed into the captain at the NK/SK zoneline, this camp is hardly ever claimed and is fantastic xp.<br><br>Lvl 40-46<br><br>2 Options here<br><br>1) Go to Dreadlands and get a group,very slow xp and I never really liked it<br><br>2) Nagafen's lair AKA SolB, this place is GREAT xp,get a group preferably at Rare Hall(RH),great loot here too. Spawn includes Kobold Priest,Champ and King, ALWAYS PULL THO THE CHAMP ROOM. Otherwise you will get a &gt;HUGE&lt; train.<br><br>Lvl 46-49<br><br>1) Stay in SolB killing bats and bugs or:<br><br>2)Go to KC and get a group (Remember i said i liked getting to places earlier than I should)<br>Great loot/xp<br><br>Lvl 49-51<br>Go to Timorious Deep and quad kite Spiroc's,this is FANTASTIC XP,you can make 49-51 in 2 nights if you really try.You get an upgrade to your lightning Strike spell,hits for 477,birds will drop very quickly<br><br>Lvl 51-53<br><br>Well this is as far as I can take you,if you like grouping go to Old Sebilis(Go early in the morning 'cos this place is PACKED later on)<br><br>If you like to solo go quad kite Wyverns in Cobalt Scar or if you are very brave the Raptors in TD.<br><br>This has been a quick guide, not very in depth, but i hope this helps some of you to get over those "Where do I hunt"-blues.<br><br>Tuvine Skydancer<br>53rd Wanderer of Tunare<br>Fennin Ro<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Greetings my fellow druids from StoneBrunt Mountains.<br><br>Have I mentioned yet that I like this zone? <br><br>Alright, today's topic is playing healer. <br><br>Ok, first thing that you find is that until we get Light Healing, our role as a healer really kind of bites. Minor healing heals fine when you are fighting in the newbie zone, but move onto slightly harder-hitting mobs and you want to laugh everytime you heal and the tank's bar still goes down.<br><br>Alright, playing healer requires 2 things. The ability to heal your group and keep your group alive. For a Druid, we can do this wonderfully.<br><br>By healing, I mean two things. One, is healing your tanks after battle so that they will be ready to go. The second is being ready to heal poisons or disease. I have noticed that casting mobs will often cast disease spells (I've had Kobold Shamans turn from the tank to me JUST to cast disease on me, then turn back to fight the tank). Spiders and snakes, ofcourse, have poison, and some caster mobs will cast poison aswell.<br><br>By keeping your group alive, I mean having the ability to protect your group from damage and to heal them if they get too low during battle.<br><br>From lvl 9 to 18, we are good at the former, and one half of the latter. We can heal people well after battle and cure all ailments. We can also protect against many things as we go. Cold, Fire,&nbsp;&nbsp;etc. Also our skin line of spells. But depending on how hard your tank is getting hit, it can be hard to heal him significantly in battle. At lvl 19, though, our role as healer significantly improves. <br><br>The tip to in-battle healing is to know how much HP your particular spell heals, how much mana it costs, and how long it takes to cast. Then, you have to be aware of how much damage a mob is dealing per tick. You can do this easily by making sure that your filter is set so that you can see sucessful hits from npc's and players. This is always a good filter to have up if you are in a group because it also ALWAYS tells you who is getting hit by what (good if adds come up behind your nuker and your nuker is not in your current line-of-sight)<br><br>When you have light healing, you want to heal your tanks up fairly soon. When they are down only a bubble or two. Basically, keep them at full. This is because you will have difficulty raising that bar, and a tanks performance goes down if his health gets too low. Also, if you have to evac, the tank moves slower if his health is too low. Can't escape if you are crawling.<br><br>At Healing, I can wait until the tanks drop just below half before I start healing. Ofcourse if ONE hit from the mob does that to our tank, we should probably run. Generally by the time you have healing (at 19) your tanks can take a good bit of damage. <br><br>The healer should be willing and able to buff, and make sure that buffs stay up. If you have other buffing classes in the group, if they haven't already done so, ask them to buff people. Make sure you don't over-lap buffs too. Sometimes one buff replaces another (not always for the better) so be mindful of what is being cast and what it does. <br>Shamans have the same buffs as druids, but they get them sooner than we do. They also get a few more that we don't. If I am grouped with a shaman, I defer to them on buffs (especially if I am still primary healer or nuke/assisting nuke) and just follow them along helping buff to conserve both of our mana.<br>If you have Pallys and Clerics in the group, make sure to ask them to share buffs as well. Usually they do. I've never seen an Enchanter lax on giving buffs. <br>If you want to be real efficient, have the buffers buff you first with the various buffs that will be cast around. As your buffs fade, you can start calling off the buff that needs to be re-cast. You can even take notes of who cast them. This will save your buffers having to ask who needs what cast because everyone is asking for different buffs at once. On the same token, buffers can buff themselves first, then the group. The effect is the same, and is really just dependent on managemet style.<br>As a rule, I spread buffs around like so. Everyone gets the Skin buff tanks, casters, pets, animations, and me. My mage friend never insists on skin, but I usually end up casting on him anyways. Sometimes, it depends on how often he's being agro'd. Enchanters ALWAYS get skin because they will ALWAYS get agro'd. Thier best spells are major taunts.<br>Melee'rs get the STR buff. That includes the mage/necro pet. I've seen where people don't buff the pets, and I think that is a major mistake. If the pet has the agro, if the pet dies, then the master gets the agro, and they are usually pretty high on the hate list at that point, being that I think they replace thier pet on it. I've also been known to heal pets, especially if the pet is the only tank at the time. If i see the pet getting alot of hits, I check its health.<br>Tanks also get Invigor if I've got it up in a slot. STA is real important for tanks, but this is one of my under-utilized spells. <br>Everyone gets SoW.<br>Two people get the Damage Sheild. The tank, and anyone who carries a significant agro from the mob (usually the enchanter) or anyone that gets added on.<br>The tank gets sheilded as soon as the pull is called. If the mob agro's secondar melee'rs for more than 2 hits, they get shielded. If the Caster/Enchanter gets agro'd by anything, they immediately get shielded and healed if necessary. If I have to, I will pull the mob off of them with melee, because chances are thier AC is alot lower than mine.<br>(note: even if I am not healing, I always keep tanks etal DS'd. I think of it as a second dot, and a very efficient one too)<br>As a rule, if the Shaman wants to play primary healer, I let them. If we have a Cleric in the group, they are always primary healer. This is especially true if Mobs are particularly tough. Unless we do not have someone to nuke, I play back up healer and keep those damage shields and buffs up. And, as I said, be ready for the cures. You can cast them mid-battle. Sometimes, you have to, because some of the poisons do some nasty damage per tick.<br><br>Don't be afraid to sit and med in the battle. I do quite often. Just don't go afk mid battle. <br><br>Pay attention to mana expenditure. I can go a while without having to med sometimes. Sometimes I burn through mana quickly. If my healing duties are light, though, then I usually find out if the nuker has his dot up. If he doesn't, or only one, if I have the mana to spare, I sometimes cast my DoT on the mob. It doesn't hurt so long as it isn't taking mana you need.<br><br>The other thing that I always do, even as primary healer, is snare. Remember that lvl 1 spell? It takes almost no mana, really. even when I seem to be oom, i usually have enough to cast it. I cast on the main mob and any and all adds and agro's. <br><br>I discovered by accident that this spell doesn't break mezz when I accidentally snared a mezzed mob (I am guessing it was mezzed because it wasn't moving. Before you take my word for it, though, test this out with an Enchanter and make very sure that it doesn't break mezz). A snared mezzed mob can buy an enchanter precious few seconds when mezz breaks. It also saves the chanter from having to root the mob after mezzing, which can save mana for other important things, like mezzing the rest of the mobs that just added, or charming an add so that it fights too.<br><br>Alright, so those are my tips on how to play healer and still get to flex your other talents a bit.<br><br>Good journey to you<br><br>Tatiyanna<br><br>&nbsp;<br>"In waking a tiger, use a very long stick." -Mao Tse-Tung.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Greetings. Okay, my lowbie thought of the day. I want to share with you my experiences with Tree Form in one collected post.<br><br>From what I have seen, this is one of the most underutilized spells we have for low to mid lvls. That is a shame, because depending on situation and strategy, it can be very useful.<br><br>Treeform is not JUST an illusion. IME, this spell gives a mild hp regen and a minor mana regen, atleast, I do recover mana faster in this form. Rocks stacked with breeze/clarity. I THINK it lowers agro on you, but I'm not 100% on that. I know that Kobolds still scowled at me. I was also attacked by 3 leopards, but given that it was 3 at once, I think someone trained them over me (probably not realizing I was not a real tree). I do seem to recall this form being suggested for elemental hunting in SF to lower agro's, but I can't remember for sure...<br><br>The downside to the spell is that you are stationary.<br><br>When is this useful, then?<br><br>Stationary Pulling: <br><br>If you are camped at a spawn-point or path, or at a camp that you can far-pull, then this is a good spell to have up. You can snare/root mobs to keep them from wandering too far away. and you have the health boost when it comes time to melee with the mob (assuming it does). Ideally, you could clear a spawn and loot at will. Your downtime is lessened slightly, so it helps.<br><br>You can do this solo or grouped.<br><br>Group Healer/Nuker/Backup:<br><br>Anything that makes you more mana-efficient is good, right? If you aren't the puller, make sure the puller knows to bring mobs within range of you, so that you can do whatever your duty is. Snaring/rooting mobs makes sure everyone stays together, and if you get agro'd, you have the slight boost, which makes it less painful.<br><br>The only time this backfired was fighting Sarnaks in LoIO. Ofcourse, I was in a group that most were 2-3 lvls above me, and most everything conned red to me. So, I was destined to get chewed up if I got a bad agro (I did. Agro'd by 3 when ALL hell broke loose). I died (it was almost a TPW anyway), but I learned my lesson. I still used Treeform, but next time I got a bad agro, I broke treeform and high-tailed it when RUN was called. <br><br>When You Must Tank:<br><br>As much as I say that druids AREN'T tanks, there will be times when you will want or need to tank. Want will come when you can afford to, and need when you have to.<br><br>I love partnering with a Mage and/or Enchanter because the pets give extra melee'r and the combo just rocks. Very complimentary. The downside is that if the pet does too much damage, then it saps some of the XP. Also, if the pet casts too weak (or a mob with lower hp was charmed) then pet tanking means that pet might die, and you have to pull an angry mob off of someone (you if it was your animal pet). Watching a pet's health means keeping it targeted, which means you aren't doing other things.<br><br>Treeform makes Tanking workable for a class that, as a rule, doesn't. You cast your damage sheild on yourself, and when mob closes in, snare it (if you didn't pull with snare) and melee. Watch it beat itself up on your spines while your buffs and treeform minimize damage to you. This is even better when your shield is adding AC (which I think it does at Barb and up?) This is good when you are in a small group and haven't gathered a Tank to you yet.<br><br>As I said, Treeform works best for stationary/distance pulling, or if someone else is pulling. <br><br>You can do move-pulling and still do this. <br><br>Snare your mob and root it. DoT and DD as normal. Re-root as needed. (save just enough mana...) before Root breaks final time, Cast Treeform on yourself and then cast your damage shield. You should have plenty of time since the mob will still be snared. Then melee with the boost. If something wandering adds, you have your boost, so you can finish off, then decide if you want to run or fight the add. Since root-nuke wears down mana, you'll need to med after anyway, and you will med faster in Treeform, so...<br><br>Alright, so for all those shouts I hear asking what good this spell is...<br><br>Have fun.<br><br>Hey, anyone else have good uses I haven't mentioned? These are just from experience.<br><br>Tatiyanna<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>"In waking a tiger, use a very long stick." -Mao Tse-Tung. Did he go to Stonebrunt too?</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>There's not really much reason for concern.&nbsp;&nbsp;My level 14 druid just did exactly what you're talking about, with no problem whatsoever.  I will admit the trip wasn't overly daunting to me because I've done it so many times with my ranger, but even he had to do it the first time (and yes, he was plenty scared that first time).<br><br>Now I'm assuming you have bought both your Camo and SoW spells, because those are the keys. I'll also assume you have bind affinity for resetting yourself if you get lost.  If you don't have all 3, you should stay where you are and get enough money to buy them first.<br><br>Assuming you're coming from Rivervale, the steps are:<br><br>1) Bind yourself in Rivervale near the Kithicor Forest zone.<br><br>2) Enter Kithicor during daylight hours. Cast SoW and Camo on yourself at the zone edge.<br><br>3) Run the short distance to the Highhold pass zone, and enter. <br><br>4) Go through Highhold Pass, using a map if you have one, otherwise use Sense Heading or /loc to keep yourself going North as best you can. It's a twisting, turning zone with lots of East/West paths, but going generally North should get you through. If you get hopelessly lost and a shout for assistance doesn't help, Gate back to Rivervale and try again. Only the entrance area (orcs) and exit area (gnolls) are dangerous, but neither of those mobs can see through camo.<br><br>5) Enter East Karana. It's a long run along the mountain ledges (and one switchover from the right side to the left side of the canyon), but you will eventually come down to the flatlands, where a path picks up. There is some high level stuff here, but again, nothing that can see through camo to the best of my knowledge.<br><br>6) Follow the path through EK until you hit a fork. You should be able to see a bridge down the left fork, which leads to North Karana.  Halfway across the bridge you'll hit the NK zone.<br><br>7) Enter NK. You've now arrived at your destination, but I'd advise following the path off the bridge to the gypsy camp (the only place in the zone where non-casters can be bound) and take the left path (Southwest). Follow this until you pass through the Wizard spires and come to the stone bridge.  Inside the bridge tower is where I would recommend you bind yourself.  This puts guards around you on either side, which is comforting when you pop back to life naked, weaponless, and with no spells memmed. My ranger was forced to bind at the gypsy camp, and was killed more than once in this sorry condition. There are guards at the tower on the hill next to the gypsy camp, but they are often too overworked to help you out.<br><br>The stone bridge also marks the entrance to South Karana - a nice place to visit but a little dicey for a level 14. The whole Western side of the NK zone is an entrance to West Karana.<br><br>As a level 14, NK, WK, (and EK with a little caution) are good places to roam. NK also requires some caution mostly because the giffawns (and their kin) and lions will both aggro.<br><br>Once you've come this far, an occassional (VERY LONG) run through WK for a visit to Qeynos and Surefall Glade helps keeps thing interesting. Besides, a visit to Qeynos with a Gate back to NK can make you feel real powerful :). Also, be sure to play some with Treeform in the Karanas - it can be a lot of fun.<br><br>One last note - plently of will-o-wisps in NK (some in WK and maybe  EK). You can do the Greater Lightstone quest with one of the female gypsies in the camp (Synthan or Myrsilla (sp?). Can't remember which one's NK, and which one is Oasis). This will help fund your lvl 19 spells.<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br>Ayudante<br>14th season WE druid<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ok, there have been a few threads about what to buy for new druid with XXXplat, or what items to obtain with your current character for your new druid. <br><br>Actions that seem to be what is commonly called Twinking.<br><br>Ok. Well, talk of twinking ALWAYS seems to draw flames. Well, rather than draw flames, I wanted to find out from ya'll. Why do you twink? How far do you go with it? Do you just do a minor boost, or go all out extravagant? When is it twinking and when is it getting a leg-up?<br><br>Well, my thoughts:<br><br>Ok, Tati isn't twinked. How could I twink her? She was my first character. I've been given items here and there by nice people. I've gotten money before too. I love it. I think it is kind, and it really helps out. I appreciate these things because I know I can't get them on my own. But it isn't twinking, IMO. <br><br>For my other characters, I've had guild mates hand off a couple of things to them. That was really nice. My necro has a pretty rogue. I've funneled a couple of things to characters before too. Items once or twice (a thing or two) and funds for my chanter, since she's a jeweler.<br><br>I can't do anything extravagant, so I couldn't twink if I wanted to.<br><br>For me, I wouldn't want to twink too much. Part of the fun is going through what you need to, quests and such, for some items. Items that frequently drop I sometimes pass on to my characters or to guildies. But at lvl 20, again, nothing extravagant. But I wouldn't do quests to get chanter-only item with my druid to pass off to my chanter. I'd rather do the quests with the 'chanter. An example<br><br>Ofcourse, that is just me. And it would probably depend on what I was hunting. I wanted the INT earrings for my chanter from the Lucia dress quest. I got one, but hunting qubert is boring and was getting annoying. I have thought about doing it with my druid so I can just nuke the little slime cube. Get off a little steam on the matter and get my earring.<br><br>So, what I am saying, is that many of us twink. Sometimes big, and sometimes small. Well, I just said where I will and won't twink.<br><br>What about you?<br><br>How does this fit into druid discussion? Well, we are talking about building a new character, and why you would pass along some things, or why you wouldn't, etc.<br><br>So chat.<br><br>Tat<br>&nbsp;<br>"In waking a tiger, use a very long stick." -Mao Tse-Tung.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I was thinking about this. <br><br>Ok. I second the buying a nice weapon. You don't have to do anything fancy. Infact, quest for the fancy. It's more fun. You can do the Screaming Mace Quest soon in Crushbone. That will yeild you a magical weapon (which you won't need until around lvl 10 anyway) and it seems to be a decent lowbie weapon.<br>I would make sure you have 1hb and 1hs to fight with. Choose one a buy a deluxe weapon. Make the other just an average weapon, but something you can practice on. Our epic is a Scimitar, so you want your 1hs practiced up lvl to lvl.<br>Ok. So, buy the weapon. One nice, one simple<br>Next, buy leather armor. Yes, there is better. But leather really will do you just fine for a long time. It will save you money. Buying the better stuff can be REALLY expensive, depending on how much better you buy. If you really want, you can get someone to make you studded armor. It will be a little more expensive. But, really, Leather is all you need. A full suit of it isn't that expensive, either. Buy it from the merchant just off the Newbie Lift (a platform to the left, I think)<br>Next, if you haven't yet, buy all your spells through lvl 5.<br><br>You still have LOTS of money left. There are always jewelers. You want to buy a couple of peices of jewelry. Go with the silver. You will probably be buying from another lowbie, since enchanters get necessary spell at lvl 8.<br><br>Buy a Silver Cat's Eye necklace (ups cha, which means lower prices when buying and higher when selling to merchants). Buy a Silver Jaded Ring (has HP and Mana), and the silver wisdom ring (I think it is Silver Jasper). There are also bracelets and earrings you can buy. The Silver Bloodstone ups Sta, which can be good. I think one of the bracelets ups dex. I can't remember which ups agility. I think it is a ring, though. And you want the mana and wis rings. If you want, get a poison resist ring. Switch it out for your wisdom ring when you are hunting spiders.<br><br>The silver jewelry isn't that expensive. Most of it lists for 5-10pl. But realistically, I sell most of my rings for a couple of plat, and the higher end for around 5pl. You are probably looking at spending 50 or 60 pl total on starting stat jewelry. <br><br>Okay, that is Tatiyanna's shopping list. Bank the rest of your money for when you have to buy spells or are ready to upgrade.<br><br>Now, hunting.<br><br>I would suggest at your lvl, finish out the newbie area. At lvl 5, start hunting around Orc Hill. Collect and save orc belts. Bank them. When you have 2 backpacks, jog to Kaladim and turn them in. You can wait longer if you want. You can also buy them from players for about 5g to 1pl a peice if you want. These things will get you through the lvls fast. Just make sure you don't speed past your skills.<br><br>When you hit lvl 7, I suggest Crushbone if you are staying in Faydwer. Hunt here through lvl 10, turning in belts and pads when you have enough to make the trip worth your while.<br><br>If there is a group around lvl 12 hunting Crush and the Warlord, offer your services as a healer/buffer (you will have shield of Thistles at this point) and do this until you can complete the Screaming Mace quest. It can take a while. You need the War Lord, and he is an uncommon spawn with a rare drop. But, the mace is a magical weapon, which will let you hunt things like wisps. It will also make my lvl 10 suggestion easier. Otherwise, if you can afford it (and you probably still can) see if you can buy a screaming mace or some other magical weapon from a player. I lucked out and a very nice person gave me mine. If you luck out too, then cool.<br><br>Alright. If you did the screaming mace quest, the xp was probably slow. THat is ok. At this point, don't continue to hunt CB. <br><br>Head over to Steamfont. Make sure you have your Ward Summoned spell and Treeform. Go there and observe the paths of the Elementals. Find a good pull spot and treeform. This form as a mild regen for hp and mana (well, atleast I think it does for mana. I'm always more mana efficient in this form). You can pull Elementals. You can do this even without a magical weapon. Keep eles rooted and use ONLY Ward Summoned on them. This spell does around 40-45 damage to them. It's the only spell you need for them. If you root them away from you, you can med if you mana gets low, then hit them again when root breaks. Think of it as tree kiting. Just be careful and choose eles carefully. They do add.<br><br>Groups are good in Steam. You can usually get into a group easily to hunt either minos or just about anything in the mino caves. <br><br>Oh, back to lvls 5-10. Around lvl 7, you can group for Chess Board in BB, bandits, or gobbies. Chess is good xp at that lvl, but poor loot. At lvl 4, you can practice fear kiting there if you want, but the xp isn't any better there, really, than finishing the newbie zone in gfay.<br><br>Ok, I hope this was helpful<br><br>Tatiyanna <br>21st Druidess of Tunare<br>Matron of Ravens Veil <br>Quellious Server<br>&nbsp;<br>"In waking a tiger, use a very long stick." -Mao Tse-Tung.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>There is LOTS nice about them.<br><br>Everyone loves the Teleports. You'll start getting self ports at 19. This means you can pretty much choose where you want to be bound cause CR's will be alot easier. For a few days I stayed bound in Firiona Vie so I could hunt LoIO at will. Now I'm back to staying bound in Stonebrunt so I can hunt it at will. Die? No prob. TP to the zone closest to where I died, sow, str, camo and run.<br><br>These aren't the only thing great, though.<br><br>Ok. Wolves and bears don't agro you, unless they are freaky ones in the karanas. As a rule, I hunt no animal that is amiable to me. All others are fair game. Zones that are heavy in bear and wolf traffic, this is good because it lessens the number of agro's<br><br>Snare. Enough said. <br><br>Grasping roots tends to have a short duration but it does damage as it roots.<br><br>At like, 14, we start charming animals (or is it 9?). Befriend animal has a short duration, but used carefully on greens is great practice for later longer lasting spells. Befriended animals also make good dots for tough mobs. Just be careful that it doesn't turn mid-battle and be ready to run if it gets nasty.<br><br>Spirit of the Wolf is also a great spell. Druids have great buffs. IMO, the three sweet buffers are Druids, Shamans, and Enchanters. <br><br>Because druids are so varied, we are ALWAYS welcome in a group. Stonebrunt is the only zone I have had problems grouping, but that lessened as I neared 20. Lake of Ill Omen, no problem grouping. <br><br>In groups, we serve best as either a healer or a nuker. It means down time, but our DoT is a good spell, snare is still useful as all get out to me at 20. Careless lightning is a great DD and has a really good damage vs. mana ratio for me. For Adds, provided no add has been mezzed, we also have a great AoE - Cascade of Hail.<br><br>We do good as primary healer. For nuker you should only be primary nuke if there is no mage or wizzie available. They do have better nuking spells.<br><br>You should ALWAYS cast your damage sheilds on tanks. I actually DS anyone who gets agro'd. Starting at Barbs, I beleive AC is added, which helps immensely.<br><br>At 20, I do little melee unless I am solo. I do almost none grouped unless I have to. I will melee if I am OOM and need to pull a mob off of someone so they don't die (or because our chanter/nuker/other healer has gotten agro'd). If i have mana and someone who shouldn't melee gets agro'd, I cast my DS on them, and heal them as needed until the tank clears them.<br><br>Tree form is another sweet thing about being a druid. I have alot of people ask what this is good for. That is just so sad. Ok. Tree form is great if you are solo'ing and can camp along a mob's movement route, or at it's spawn point. Tree form lessens agro's cause, well, you look like a tree. It doesn't prevent adds, though. <br><br>Also, you get a little bit of regen in treeform. AND you recover mana a little faster.<br><br>In groups, if we are stationary with a puller, I treeform and make sure they pull within range. I am much more mana efficient this way. Especially if I get clarity. And the regen is nice if the mob realizes I'm the healer/nuker. Some mobs are very smart and will go after healers (gotta love ai's).<br><br>There is a regen spell later. aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh mmmmmmmmmm. Wolf form. Which means NO WORRIES ABOUT BROWNIES EVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Druids are so very versitile. You can solo if you want by "kiting". I'm still learning this, but the basic idea is to be able to damage a mob from afar without getting hurt yourself. <br>You cast SoW on yourself, then Snare mob, keep it just out of range by moving, and dot it. Then damage spells. If you are low on mana, root it and med a moment. make sure you are a good ways off. when root breaks you should have enough mana to either damage sheild yourself and melee it or finish it off with DD's. Places like the Karanas, I hear, are best for this.<br>You can "fear kite" animals. Again, SoW yourself. Cast snare on mob. Then fear/terrorize animal. Then follow it, casting dot and DD's on it. If you need to, med. Root it first, incase fear lets up. Then finish it off same as above. <br>I have tried fear kiting with a befriended animal and died horribly. I think with care and practice and being close to zone I should be able to do it. I just need to work at it.<br><br>Hmm, I only scratched the surface.<br><br>Have fun making your druid.<br><br>Tatiyanna<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>"In waking a tiger, use a very long stick." -Mao Tse-Tung.

This is so that me and someone else with a damage shield don't cast same spell on same person. Same with heals and snares, blah blah blah.<br><br>So, it's not uncommon for me to get relegated to back up whatever in a group at my lvl. I don't mind. It's relaxing. The group works and whomever I am backing up knows that they have back up. As I get better, I know that I will be able to prevent TPW in even the worst situations because I will be able to help keep people alive long enough for an evac to go off.<br><br>I'm almost always grouped with atleast one friend. I figure that even the most anti-social of us should have a few friends by lvl 40+, right? So, if you really want a group, you should be able to find one. Even if you make one yourself, which being a control freak I prefer to do.<br><br>Hey, I'm a fair control freak.<br><br>If people don't need you, they won't need you no matter what lvl or class you are. I've seen enchanters ask for ever and a day for a group. AN ENCHANTER! Hello, I snag them up as quicly as I can if I've got an opening. <br><br>And there won't ALWAYS be wizzies and shammies taking up every group. And I've fought indoors. I'm not completely useless. But, yeah, you are probably looking at needing to get friends together to do indoors after a while. No big.<br><br>Ofcourse, your warning about the downside of our class also shows one of the strengths. If we can't find a group, we can solo REALLY well. If you get lonely, just befriend an animal. Nothing boosts the ego like a pet. So, there is no turning off the game in frustration if you can't find a group. Solo it.<br><br>I do.<br><br>Tatiyanna<br><br><br>Good journey<br>&nbsp;<br>"In waking a tiger, use a very long stick." -Mao Tse-Tung. Did he go to Stonebrunt too?</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Actually 40 isn't that bad, compared to 45 & 51+..but still it's not easy. I would actually suggest multiple kiting in Dreadlands. Find 2-5 of the same tipe of creature (cockatrice, drolvarg, spiders etc.), but watch out for some spiders, don't wanna get rooted while kiting, keep them snared, don't mind the DoT or anything, if you have enough mana keep dmg shield and HP buffer on you, and of course SoW, use Avalance, Earthquake, whatever AoE spell that most fits you, and that can be up to half an orange per 2 1/2 bubs of mana (depending on WIS and getting resisted, etc). Got through 40 in a matter of hours..very nice. Only a suggestion, but I'd advice it. Hope this helps.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bulvi the Assassin<br>60 Rogue of Vallon Zek</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>To my fellow druids.<br><br>I was watching over the shoulder of my friend playing the other day in various NRo and Oasis groups and i noticed something.<br><br>On both occasions the druid (in one case druids) in his group were NOT casting the thornshield line on their groups tanks (my friend and some big ogre). Note that a magician was not present in either party.<br><br>I had my friend ask them to do it and both gave the same resposne 'it's not worth the mana, doesn't do enough damage'<br><br>(sigh) now i know most newbies out there aren't that naive but for the few that are, and the few who just didn't think about it, let me put this into number.<br><br>Say a mob lasts, owww, 20 ticks. Now he'll likely hit your tank 15-16 of those 20 ticks.<br><br>Lets say your damage shield is at only 4dmg. Thats 15x4 for only 40 mana. Thats 60 dmg for 40 or so mana. That is an AWESOME dmg to mana ratio for a level 9 spell.<br><br>That is on top of the fact that because it lasts 2 minutes or so at level 9 it can likely be used on a second pull if your chain pulling. That means it now does 120 dmg for 40 mana or so.<br><br>Mind you also that it produces no agg on you beyond that of casting a weak buff on the tank, so when extra mobs come along they don't add on you as if you'd actually cast a 120 dmg DD or DoT spell.<br><br>For these reasons it is imperative that you buy this line of spell if you plan on grouping. In many groups past 14 the group brings you in for only 3 reasons... SOW, Alt Healer, and Thorn Shield.<br><br>As a last note a quick thought on this. i was in OT the other day with my level 29 self. Casted my level 29 dmg shield on the tank.<br><br>Thanks to the speed mobs attack it hit our tank something like 25-30 time in the fight coutning doubles and bashes (we had a high level wiz so the mobs tended not to last as long)<br><br>now thats 25x9 or so damage i believe. That means my spell did 225 dmg for only 80 mana. The level 29 one lasts about 4 minutes. In OT that means 3-4 pulls.<br><br>So by level 29 this line allows me to do a total of (3x225) or (675) dmg for only 80 mana. As far as i know NO other spell line we posses can produce that kind of mana to damage ratio with virtually NO agg to us.<br><br>Well that wraps this lesson up kiddies. From level 9 up in groups, unless a mage is present (their line doesn't last as long but does more damage so most tanks want that on them instead), use that thorn spell to your hearts content. It drops the mobs faster for less mana which saves everyone mana and health which lets you pull faster and level higher.<br><br>ZNF<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Another thing. Around lvl 14 I began tapering off my melee'ing. I often made the mistake of not casting my DS on tanks (just usually forgot about it) but I worked at it, and now I DS all meleer's and anyone else who gets agro'd.<br>At lvl 19, I got the next in line. I love this spell. It does great damage. I melee with a velium morning star (which doesn't proc at my lvl). Half the time, the damage on the shield is comperable to what I would be doing if I was meleeing, better if the mob is good, since it will hit more times than I will. So, it's like I'm meleeing along side the tank for around 7 damage a tick. <br>This gives me valuable med time when I'm in a group. I've not had anyone complain when I sit down mid battle. I just DS, snare the mob, then sit and watch heal bars if I'm healer. If we have a better healer, or another healer and no other nuke, then once DS and snare is up, I recover mana is I need to and DoT and DD mobs. <br>I love this line of spells. If I have to melee, I cast it on myself too for the AC boost and extra damage and go in.<br>I can't begin to count the value of this spell. When buying my 19 spells, I was tight on money. This was the first spell I bought to make sure I had it.<br><br>Tatiyanna<br><br>"Melee?
