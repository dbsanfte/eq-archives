All 3 times were just as an AoE or other Debuff went off. Symptoms were: Lag-o-meter bouncing down to about 93%, most mobs and players were unable to be seen, /gu /rs /g were all not responing (though, the player made channels worked fine), and spells would not finish (you'd be locked if you tried to cast).<br><br>Eventually the whole gang would get disconnected and punted to character select. Upon relog, most people would be rolled back quite a bit, sometimes 10-20 minutes before the crash.<br><br>This crashed us during the cleric epic 1.5 event in WL, the RZ Script in Tactics (crashed on fake RZ), and the Blackened Dryad (druid 1.5) in WL.<br><br>We have since gone to a policy of having everyone keep 2 open buff slots. Since then we have done RZ Script, Agnarr Event, and Sol Ro tower minis without any problems.<br><br>Mileage, of course, may vary, but this has worked quite well for us (0 crashes since we started it). It can't hurt to try that and see if it works for you.</p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br /><span class="sm">~WoW~<br><a href="HTTP://wow.allakhazam.com/profile.html?81141" target="akztarg">Cafeen</a> - Troll Hunter<br>&lt;<a href="HTTP://thefoot.guildwizard.com" target="akztarg">The Foot Clan</a>&gt;<br>Deathwing (PvP)<br><br>~EQ~<br><b><a href="HTTP://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=892149" target="akztarg">Stubbed Toez</a></b> - Overlord of Brell<br><b><a href="HTTP://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=283557" target="akztarg">Cafeen</a></b>- Tier'Dal Coercer<br>Member of &lt;<a href="HTTP://www.deluclin.com" target="akztarg">Descending Essence</a>&gt;<br>Luclin Server</span class="sm"></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8">Posting from the couch</td></tr></table>

This is a common occurance. The most common was when my guild was in Tower of Sol Ro and the entire raid went LD. Each of us could move but everyone else was frozen. Spells would cast and casting timer would reset but spells wouldn't never actually went off. We were frozen like this for about 3 minutes before we were disconnected. It was like playing the game but not being connected. Weirdest LD I have ever encountered. I petitoned it like a good little SOE player even though I didn't expect anything. I was somewhat surprised That I actually got a response. Only took a week. I was slightly annoyed to say the least when I read the response to my petition which clearly stated that the ENTIRE raid LD'd at exactly the same time.<br><br>The response went something like this: We are sorry about your connection issue but our records show that the zone never experianced any interuptions their for we are unable to compensate you for your loss of XP.<br><br>I guess that our entire raid had a connection issue at the same time. Or at least thats what SOE is trying to say. Unfortunatly this isnt the first time this has happened and the fact that they refuse to acknowledge it in any way shape or form leads me to believe they will continue to ignore it until they have no choice but to acknowledge it.<br><br>The only way this can be done is that when someone experiences a zone crash or &quot;burp&quot; as they are commonly known it must be petitioned immediatly and by everyone who experianced it. Don't be demanding just simply notify them of the issue.<br><br>It can't be ignored forever.</p></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8"></td></tr></table>

I was directed to e-mail SOE CS. The following is the e-mail I have sent them:<br><br>To Whom it May Concern:<br><br>I am Kaludram Aderlas, guildleader (GL) of Shadow Congress on Druzzil Ro. Shadow Congress is one of the oldest guilds on Druzzil Ro, and I am one of the longest term guildleaders on the server. We, both myself and my guild, are well known on Druzzil Ro, and I consider us a fixture of the server community. We, myself and my guild have had about enough at this point and are looking for not only an apology, but CS rezzes, experience restoration, and an ongoing dialogue to convince us the issues we have experienced over the last week are going to be resolved in the near future. As such, GM Carlto directed me to send an e-mail concerning these matters.<br><br>The issues are as follows:<br><br>- on Monday, March 7, at approximately 9 pm EST we reached the Tallon Zek (TZ) portion of the Rallos Zek the Warlord (RZtW) script. At 7% hp remaining TZ disappeared, reappearing at the zone-line (ZL) according to several witnesses, and the zone began to crash. After several minutes of waiting I gave the order for everyone to /q out since /camp was impossible. For several minutes the zone was &quot;unavailable&quot;. When we came back many of us were in a completely different location, whilst others were in the corner we had attempted to lay Tallon Zek from. Either way full repops were present and numerous deaths occurred. At that time I asked folks to petition this issue since it was quite clear we were entitled to CS rezzes. Our evening had been ruined, and most people logged in a very disappointed frame of mind.<br><br>- eventually some petitions were answered, and some members of the raid the previous evening were given CS rezzes, but some were informed it was &quot;too late&quot; and CS rezzes could not be offered. Several of us were also informed that I, being the GL and raidleader, should be the only one to petition in the future to speed the response time and the actions we took were improper with regards to all of us petitioning, and should not be repeated.<br><br>- Thursday, March 10, at approximately 8:45 pm EST we engaged the &quot;fake&quot; RZtW on the second floor of Tactics as part of the RZtW script. At approximately 48% hp lag again assailed us, RZtW disappeared, again appearing at ZL according to many witnesses, and the zone began to crash. After several minutes I again ordered the raid to /q since /camp was impossible. Again, the zone was &quot;unavailable&quot; for several minutes. Upon returning there were again repops, and people died. I asked folks NOT to petition, as I was directed, since I was told my own petition would be answered faster.<br><br>- Thursday, March 10, at approximately 10:30 pm EST I log after having NO CS assistance.<br><br>- Friday, March 11, after more than 12 hours in the petition queue my petition is finally responded to with no indication we will receive CS rezzes or proper attention. Instead I am directed to contact this e-mail address.<br><br>Our desires for resolution are as follows:<br><br>- a simple apology for these issues in an expansion that is over two years old<br><br>- CS rezzes at a convenient time for us, this evening between 7 and 8 pm EST would be perfect<br><br>- experience restoral for those that can no longer be CS rezzed<br><br>- an ongoing dialogue between myself and a member of either SOE CS or SOE Dev about the steps being taken to rectify these issues in a timely fashion<br><br>Where is SC at this point? We are very disappointed in the lack of support and concern given to us by SOE CS. This comes following two attempts in the last 8 days with a broken Marshal Histent script (part of the ranger epic 1.5). I have several members considering leaving EQ despite our past loyalty and work within this game due to these issues. The bugs with the RZtW script are preventing approximately 1/3 of our raid force from progressing in the Elemental Planes which is preventing the guild's progress as a whole into Time (we have already succeeded against Fennin Ro, and were working recruiting forces to defeat Coirnav). We cannot progress without those members still need RZtW for EP access, and we do not wish to progress without these people. If we cannot progress with them, due to bugs within EQ, the next logical step is to move. This is, obviously, something we do not wish to do, but if both SOE CS and SOE Dev aren't giving these issues proper attention we see little choice.<br><br>For your information we are working on a plan to prevent our departure to your competitors which involves more aggressive actions on our parts. We, my guild and I, are aware we have other avenues to explore to make our disappointment over the lack of service we have received thus far be known. As a courtesy I am informing you that a continued unacceptable level of customer support will result in some, if not all, of the following:<br><br>- contact of the California Department of Consumer Affairs at https://www.dca.ca.gov/dca/secure/gencomplaint.htm<br><br>- contact of the respective credit card companies of members paying by credit to inform them we have not received the services we paid for<br><br>- contact of the San Diego Better Business Bureau at <a href="http://complaint.bbb.org/(orqvbbeaavqgmc45ohjpvjef" target="akztarg">http://complaint.bbb.org/(orqvbbeaavqgmc45ohjpvjef</a>)/Default.aspx<br><br>As you can probably tell you have many unhappy, but well-informed, customers seeking resolution by the most expedient, fair, and mutually painless means possible at this point. Please work with us to resolve these issues before our displeasure over these issues becomes exacerbated by further lackluster attention by SOE CS.<br><br>Thank you for your assistance in this matter.</p></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8"></td></tr></table>

I would probably get demoted, lose pay and get restriction, but I'm in the Marine Corps. We don't exactly work like your typical computer game company. If we did though, and I had to sift through thousands of line of code, trying to find the one little (or several linked) typo(s) that was(were) screwing up the game, I would probably have a bit of leeway. We're not talking about putting a two stroke engine together here, we're talking about a LOT of code, which can be annoying to look at to say the least, that was probably compiled by several people. If someone other then you (hell, even you in a lot of cases) writes code without appending clear and concise notes, it can be hell on earth to figure out where something went wrong.</p><br /><span class="sm">----------------------------</span><br /><a href="HTTP://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1006062&resize=true" target="akztarg">Jiggidyjay</a> - <span class="sm">Mr Ranger</span class="sm"><br><a href="HTTP://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1003866&resize=true" target="akztarg">Zingin Ansinging</a> - <span class="sm">Mr Bard of <a href="HTTP://firestormers.com/viewnews.php" target="akztarg">The Firestormers</a></span class="sm"><br><a href="HTTP://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1006061&resize=true" target="akztarg">Zolotaya</a> - <span class="sm">Ms Necro</span class="sm"><br><a href="HTTP://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1189723" target="akztarg">Zeibis</a> - <span class="sm">Monk</span class="sm"></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8">Posting from the Oval Office.</td></tr></table>

The age of the expansion content is irrelevant. It's not a broken or poorly coded script that's causing problems. You're getting zone crashes. Those are server based. You are aware there are whole layers of &quot;stuff&quot; between the actual content and your computer, right? Servers crash. Networks go down. This has nothing to do with the age of the content on those servers. Stop implying that because it's from an older expansion that it should be immune to the normal network/server crashes that can occur anywhere.<br><br>Um... Also. You ask for a &quot;simple appology&quot;, but then later say that an appology isn't enough. If all you want to do is whine about stuff, why don't you say so and save everyone a lot of time and trouble?<br><br><blockquote><b id="fs8">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />- CS rezzes at a convenient time for us, this evening between 7 and 8 pm EST would be perfect<hr size="1" /></blockquote><br><br>Ah yes. Let's just demand that we get exactly what we want.<br><br>Look. You are presumably an experienced raiding guild right? Freaking summon and rez your dead. Takes 5 minutes. Cost you a couple Kpp tops. That's pocket change in terms of raiding expenses. Anyone in a raiding guild expects lots of lots of deaths. It's part of the deal. And yeah. Sometimes zones crash.<br><br><blockquote><b id="fs8">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />- experience restoral for those that can no longer be CS rezzed<hr size="1" /></blockquote><br><br>Um? what do you think a CS rez is? Look. They aren't going to expend that much time and trouble so you can get a 100% rez instead of the 96% rezzes you could have trivially provided for everyone on your raid force already. Exp restoring generally means actually rolling your character back to a backup. That's probably not what you really want to have happen.<br><br>I'm not sure why you make a distinction between a &quot;CS rez&quot; and a &quot;experience restoral&quot;. From your perspective, they're both just recoving the exp you lost dying. Um... Is it really such a big deal to get that 10th of a blue of exp back that you lost? Go kill one mob in WoS. Problem solved! I just don't get this one...<br><br><blockquote><b id="fs8">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />- an ongoing dialogue between myself and a member of either SOE CS or SOE Dev about the steps being taken to rectify these issues in a timely fashion<hr size="1" /></blockquote><br><br>In other words, you want to be &quot;special&quot; as though you are the only ones affected by the current server stability problems they've been having.<br><br>Want to be involved? Post *useful* information on the official SOE boards. There's you dialogue right there. What exactly do you think makes you so special that they're going to open up a &quot;special&quot; dialogue just with you, when there are 500,000 other customers who are being affected by the same problem? That's what those boards exist for. You're just going to have to go through that process just like everyone else. You are not a unique snowflake...<br><br><br><br>That's all I really had to say. I just have to laugh when people get all huffy and puffed chest like this. Look. You are just one more of thousands of other people. You aren't special. You may think you are, but from SOE's perspective, you're just one more account. Don't like that? Feel free to go play another game. Guess what? You're just going to be one more account to them too. That's because (drumroll) *that's what you are*! Or do you think that your amazingly valuable $13 a month entitles you to special treatment? Get over yourselves. You're just another face in the crowd...</p></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8">Posting from San Diego, CA</td></tr></table>

Think about it. Your guild consists of how many people compared to the tens of thousands that play EQ and EQ2? Do you really think they care about a couple hundred people at most?<br><br>Instead of making demands try being polite and courtious. It usually works better.<br><br>As far as reporting them to the BBB please tell me this was a joke. You are being provided with a service and that service is being provided according to the BBB standards. The only way you would remotely have a chance with this route of action is if ALL of the EQ servers were shut down for an extended period of time and SOE had absolutely no explination for it. The first question you would be asked is whether or not the game is playable in any way and the answer to that is YES. Just because an occasional zone goes down now and then does not constitute a lack of service.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I'm just as pissed about these problems as any other person but you have to realize what kind of service were talking about here. Fixing this isn't as easy as going in and pressing a button. Were dealing with computer code here. I'm talking about BILLIONS+ of 0's and 1's and the problem could be as little as having a 1 in place of a 0. Let's do the math.<br><br>A 0 or a 1 = a BIT.<br>8 BITS = a BITE.<br>1024 BITES = 1 KILOBITE.<br>1024 KILOBITES = 1 MEGABITE.<br>1024 MEGABITES = 1 GIGABITE.<br>1 GIGABITE = 8,589,934,592 BITS.<br>The EQ Client on my PC is 3.44 gig. Imagine how much info is on the EQ servers. Not to mention EQ's priority are bugs and hacks that affect game integrity and manipuability. As much as I hate to say it this problem falls in the minor catagory.<br><br>Nothing is perfect. Especially when it comes to computers. Chances are this problem will never be solved but if its brought to SOE's attention by enough people it will earn serious attention from SOE.<br><br><blockquote><b id="fs8">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />Sending in 200+ petitions a day that say nothing more then &quot;We crashed&quot; does NOT speed up the process, it just keeps people busy that are actually investigating the problem.<hr size="1" /></blockquote><br><br>Exactly. If you want to be a help the petition needs to have as much detail about what was going on at the time of the crash as possible. I probably should have said that in my previous post but I was just posting a simple message and I was a little tired. My mistake.<br><br>Until this problem gets serious attention I would at the very least like an &quot;in-game&quot; acknowledgment of the problem.<br><br>One more time. BE POLITE. When someone DEMANDS something of me they are usually the last person who will get my attention. Think of how many people petition something every day. Demanding service at YOUR CONVENIANCE will usually result you in getting service AFTER everyone else and when the GM gets around to it. Not to mention an empty threat will usually get you no service at all.</p></td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="mform2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td id="fs8"></td></tr></table>
