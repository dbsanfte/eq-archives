<p>Yes the Mission system looks good.</p>

<p>I am very annoyed the Entrance area of Guildhalls isnt avaialable to anyone and not just those that purchase this expansion. POK population will be split fairly badly by this.</p>

<p>I agree that more needs to be done about the population issue, /lfg in other expansions will be pretty hard after half the players move to DON and there are no newbies moving up through older content.</p>

<p>I quit EQ1 around 6 months ago and I'm not goign to go back for this or any other expansion for 1 simple reason:  Finding groups became impossible, finding a stable guild became impossible, and just about all my pals left the game.</p>

<p>The game requires a large population per server to play proerly and the numbers required for this are just not there.  Why would anyone in their right mind ewaste more time on the game if there is hardly anyone left to play with?<br />

<p>A fair number of servers actually appear to have good pop although timezones can be an issue even on them. so its situational, but yes its a problem on many servers.</p>

<p>Why can't they just make the new map system available to everyone instead of expansion buyers only? The same could even be said of the other new features. I believe expansions should expand the game, as in adding new levels, AAs, spells and zones. I don't like the idea of trying sell expansions by adding features that make life easier for people and should be added for everyone. Yes I know this is the way they have done it for a long time and eventually some of those features are available to everyone, like a year later, but it's still rubs me the wrong way.</p>

<p>"This drudges up the new question of the year: How can Everquest attract new players?"</p>

<p>This is hardly a "new question" as people have been talking about this for a long time. The answer is it can't unless they completely overhauled the entire game, which they aren't going to do because they already did it, aka Everquest 2. The real question is "how can Everquest attract some of the old players who quit to come back, or keep more people from quitting?" Making a quality expansion can help. It remains to be seen whether DoN will be quality or not when it actually goes live, not based on what it is in beta. Adding new features and making them available to everyone could also help. Lowering the price of an EQ subscription could help, and I think is in reality the best way to bring people back. Otherwise there really is no reason to return to EQ because so much of what is in EQ now can be gotten in other games and with better graphics/sound. The fact is the newer games are much more user friendly, do a good job of appealing to a wider audience of players, plus are just plain more modern.</p>

<p>I do not plan on returning to EQ because of this expansion but I will find it interesting to see comments from everyone on whether it is good or not. It seems with OOW that SoE had gotten their act together and delayed it to make it a quality expansion so maybe that's a sign of something positive.<br />

<p>"I quit EQ1 around 6 months ago and I'm not goign to go back for this or any other expansion for 1 simple reason: Finding groups became impossible, finding a stable guild became impossible, and just about all my pals left the game."</p>

<p>This is why I am excited about the Mission system, the guild bulletin boards, and the guild hall.  The easiest time I had finding groups was when LDON came out.  Groups formed quickly and got into the action quickly.  When they broke up after an adventure, it wasn't tough getting into another group.  The large amount of short duration single group missions will hopefully help people find groups.</p>

<p>With the guild hall, most people will want to be guilded.  This is the first in-game feature that specifically targets guilds.  It offers many unique features to those who are guilded.  The "Looking for Guild" and "Guild Looking for Players" helps connect the right people to the right guild without having to use word of mouth or message forums that many players do not see or use.  Hopefully these features help rebuild guilds back to their former state.</p>

<p>Lastly, Robert Pfister stated pretty clearly in his last EQ State of the Game note that should this expansion not help increase the population, they will consider consolidating servers.  The recent Zek consolidation seems to have gone well and considering the rule-set change, people weren't all expected to be happy.  Consolidating these four servers brought over 400 people to Knowledge on the first few nights.</p>

<p>We'll have to see over the next few weeks, but I can't think of much more SOE could do to help bring players back to the game beyond what this expansion offers.  It looks really good.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Wombat at February 11, 2005 09:15 AM</strong></p>
<p>LDON's groups werent quick to form, it took typically an hour to get started, once we got going we could do several back to back if no one left.</p>

<p>If someone left it could take a while to replace the healer/slower etc. As a Paladin once my Pacify became useless gettin a group outside my guild became more difficult, as a Cleric I doubt you would have had problem Loral.</p>

<p>Of course these issues were the same with any groups regardless of LDON or not.</p>

<p>Whats left of my Guild is having the vital classes cherry picked by whats left of the raiding guilds in my timezone, if the Missions require balanced groups then we are out of luck.</p>

<p>People who want to be Guilded already are. They may wish to swap Guilds, and thats another matter. POK pop will plummet with those with the expansion in Guildhalls, no more MGB's and social interaction or at least whats left of it.</p>

<p>There are good aspects to this expansion if lag and frequent patches dont destroy playability, the last thing they need is to drive people away with an undertested expansion. This isnt OoW they RUSHED this in without much testing.</p>

<p>Population issues is making it difficult for my Guild to play in OoW, the same issues will make it difficult in DoN.</p>

<p>I am glad they are considerring server mergers after DoN, this is the first ray of hope I have seen in a while.</p>

<p>PS a lot of people are hanging back deciding on whether to renew their accounts, this will split the population between those within DON and those without. This has always happened with expansions, it just matters more now.</p>

<p>My Guild will have to do conventional CR's for people who cant access the alter, since Sony made the very stupid decision to limit the Guild atrium to DON holders only. so no bet benefit to us of the altar existing.</p>

<p>Didn't buy OOW, not buying DON. Fix enchanters because I'm not spending $30 to stand in the guild lobby casting c3 for hire because my class is less useful in an adventure than a zerker's DPS.  For that matter, fix the population issue by drawing new players into the game. Server consolidation is just a stopgap.  </p>

<p>You can't draw new players in without revamping  content that was designed seven years ago. No one buying an MMORPG for the first time is going to be impressed by 2D trees, polygonal hills, and obvious texture boundries.</p>

<p>Like I said yesterday.  If only they had half the balls & brains of the SWG design team, they might come up with something.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Teremar at February 11, 2005 12:30 PM</strong></p>
<p>It appears that SOE has made a business decision to focus on reducing the number of subscribers it loses from EQ, not trying to gain new subscribers. Perhaps they don't want to compete with EQ2, perhaps they just don't think they could bring in many people no matter what they did. I think it's a reasonable decision, though naturally EQ players would prefer that SOE put unlimited resources into the game and do everything.</p>

<p>Given that reality, what SOE needs to hear most is what will keep current players playing. In other words, forget about those hypthetical new players and tell them what you yourself want! (Don't be short-sighted though--you might just get it.)</p>

<p>DoN sounds like a good expansion. Maybe as much fun as WoW. Of course "as much as" won't get people to come back, but if it keeps people from leaving that will be a significant achievement.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by <a href="mailto&#58;taylorA&#64;cmaaccess&#46;com">Barabasxev</a> at February 11, 2005 01:41 PM</strong></p>
<p>I agree with the above, they need to draw old players back to the game, the problem i see is, there not going to be able to do this by adding a new expantion, with better gear and spell i think they need to shake it up a bit, and add duel classing to the game, your 2nd class, could have a  cap at 50th level, granted a few things would have to be reworked one of which complete heal ( for this, it should be made into a line of slow casting high healing spells, so the one you get at 39th might be a 9sec cast 4k heal, but the one at 70th could be a 9sec cast 12k heal).</p>

<p>I really dont see how thos could imbalance the game ether, lets say, my 70th necro duel classed as a warrior, each level i make i gain the difference between the 2 classes in HP,mana, and attk, i could ofcourse duel weild and use swords, what keeps this in check is, there's nothing I could use as a 50th warrior, thats as good as the gear i have now, my hp's and AC would both go up a couple hundred.</p>

<p>At level 70 you become a transendant, meaning, by this point in the game youve killed gods, perhaps learnt some from them, and are no longer bound by the rules of mortal men, this would allow you to duel cass a class not normally allowed to your race, ( exceptions being an SK could not duel as a paladin, or ogre as a monk).</p>

<p>This would open up sooo many doors for new fun, a warrior that dueled as a cleric, could then halfass solo once he reaches 50th, a mage that duels as a shaman or necro, could solo better also.</p>

<p>Also, and i think this would help the game moreso than anything else, would to ether boost group size, or change the amount of xp in small raids (7-9 people) theres nothing worse than logging in and not able to get an xp group, as it stands now, a 6man group will net 20X the xp of a 7man raid, they could code this in a way where events ment for 6 people would still only allow 6 people into the event.</p>

<p>I still want a new server with just the base game, Ruins of Kunark, and Scars of Velious...</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by The Perculator at February 11, 2005 02:30 PM</strong></p>
<p>Well, what Baraba has described sounds too much like a different game, though it does sound fun.  When I hear questions about bringing in new players I find myself thinking of two things: 1. how I could really use some nachos right now and 2. what brought me into the game.  The later is rather difficult.  I started playing once Kunark started.  It was a lot of fun, but it was expensive for me at the time and I didn't know anyone else who played.  I then quit and came back a little before Luclin.  I now knew of some people that did play and that helped a lot.  But what kept me going were the changes being made.  I think the lower end game has not been "revamped" like some of the more high level content.   However, it's now easier than ever to get a character to the 40s and 50s where you can go to so many fun places including new expansions.  </p>

<p>Heck, I still love making toons and taking them to 30 or so, just to see other newbie zones and how others in the past have started their characters.  With a few more bells and whistles, like graphics, communication, and movement improvements, I think that eq will still be bringing in more people to play.  I still have a blast playing and I'm sure if others give it a try, they'll see the same.  SOE will advertise a few months free or something and flash a lot of new neato and rad graphics and get some people in the game.  On our side, we can also help this along by grabbing these people, getting to know them, and helping them understand the game. (and keep them away from the "I'm retired, this game suxxors, u lamo." type people)    I still don't understand them and prolly never will.  If I do ever stop playing, I'm sure not going to waste my time complaining about a game I don't play and poking fun at those who still do.  There are too many nachos out there for that.  </p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Thran at February 11, 2005 02:33 PM</strong></p>
<p>I am very surprised to see such negative comments. This expansion seem to me a direct response to many wants and needs. I do agree LDoN really braught the server togther with uber guilded people grouping with bazaar built casual players. I hope this expansion will do the same. Server consolidation is probably inevitable as popluations decline. EQ 1 has been here for 6 years, how many other MMorpgs can or ever came this far. none, so kudos to the EQ team. I have been playing for 6 years and I have seen people complain since day one and sya they are leaving for everything from Asherons call to most recently Worlds of warcraft. The bottom line is if EQ keep improving people will stay. I have some suggestions for server mergers. <br />
Distribute the levels more evenly. It wont do any good to have 95% of the population over 60. I know this wil upset people who plan on powerleveling their characters with their 70 druid, but so what poweveling take away from the game experience anyway. It might be prudent to create servers and move peopel accordingly by their level. Suchs as a newby servers where initial population is 1-20, middle class 21- 40,<br />
, higher end 41- 70. The main reason that i do not play my lower level characters is ( at least on my server) there are rarely any players lfg from 1- 50 and 50- 65 isnt not that much better. right now the game seems to be race ( powerlevel, grind) to 65 and then play from 65- 70 to get loot and flags etc.. It also may be prudent to set up those servers to accomodate the levels. if 99% of the active players are over 60 , lets put some content that they can have fun with in the old newby levels. maybe just a mob or two. LDON and the new epic fights broaugh people back to older zones such as oasis who hadnt been there in maybe years. putting a a few level 60-70 mobs in some of the older zones would help possibly. <br />
Another idea I had was a Group making tool. One in which when you logged you coudl enter a queu under a a archytype ( such as tank,DPS, healer or utility) and wait till a full group was assembled. this woudl be in reverse of how it is done now and would allow some of the less desrable classes a chance to get groups easier as well. You could put it in POK and then give a mission when group becomes full.    </p>

<p>Loral said, 'Many contend that the game already has an abundance of low level zones. However, zones alone aren't appealing enough to show the potential EQ now offers to higher level players. The rewards in lower-level content become quickly outdated by newer, more powerful, and cheaper gear available in the bazaar.'</p>

<p><br />
This is a primary factor in the drive for players to advance to the 'end game' as fast as possible, to shorten the time spent on 'obsolete' content (items/zones/whatever).</p>

<p>This is a PLAYER PROBLEM, not a game problem.</p>

<p>If players focused more on the journey than the destination, they would probably be more happy.</p>

<p>Of course the players that do that now are so few, they are (or were) stuck in the situation of insufficient support to actually use alot of the content designed for them. (meaning low populations at the low/mid levels)<br />
</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Redcloud at February 11, 2005 04:39 PM</strong></p>
<p>The current only viable option they'd have is a common low level server till maybe 60 and then branch out to whichever server they wish. For new players. For alts people will do whatever they want anyway.</p>

<p>Concerning what Barabasxev mentioned about duel classing that is how it works in Final Fantasy XI and to tell the truth I wouldn't want to see that copied in EQ or any game for that matter. I wasn't impressed with FFXI at all and found the game to be too constricting, slow and with a horrible UI. It's like the devs there had in mind a certain way they want people to play the game and designed it in such a way to make sure people only play that way, like control freaks. I wouldn't copy much of anything from FFXI into EQ.</p>

<p>I disagree that the new expansion won't bring back people to EQ because it seems people have always returned to check out the new expansions. Although I have a feeling it will be less this time some will return. The question is how long will they stay back and the answer probably is not long. The problem is the newer games just look and play so much better that when people come back to EQ it will look bad by comparison if they have bene playing a newer game in recent months. There really is nothing that can be done about this because time has passed EQ by. If you read Smedly's letter that was posted today it seems he also is admitting EQ's better days are behind and they are more concerned with the future with new games. His letter can be seen here:<br />

<p>Thank you SoE! You listened to what the players asked for and make the adjustments we wanted. This makes 2 fantastic expansions in a row and I am impressed. So much enjoyment, simply months and months of fun for the cost of one expansion $24.99 (download) is the same price as one tank of gas for your automobile.</p>

<p>This game is priceless!</p>

<p>Was that sarcasm? Or are you serious? I guess with all the rampant SOE hate around, I find it hard to believe anyone other than me could be that happy with an expansion.</p>

<p>I am very happy with the mission system, among other things.</p>

<p>One other thing I quite liked that I forgot to mention, is quests can be found in unexpected places.</p>

<p>I was fighting random trash mobs in Broodlands, and a spider I killed dropped an item called Coin of [some dragon]. I forgot the name, unfortunately. Well, I looted it, since I had no reason not to. However, the item did not appear in my inventory. Instead, a little window like the ones in the tutorial popped up and told me about [aforementioned dragon] and her journey. (I don't know if there was a voice or not, as I had my sound off at the time. People sleeping a room or two away.) It then asked if I wished to follow in the footsteps of said dragon, retracing her journey or something to that effect. When I said yes, a new quest was added to my task window. I thought it was pretty cool. Unfortunately, I promptly got wasted, lost my level and decided to re-betabuff, so I don't know how the story ends, but I thought it was a pretty cool way to start a quest. A nice change from:<br />
You say, "Hail, Quest_NPC_653"<br />
Quest_NPC_653 says, "Hello, Maitreya. Would you like to help me with a [dragon problem]."<br />
You say, "What dragon problem?"<br />
Quest_NPC_653 says, "You are not über enough. Come back when you've pwned a few more gnoll pups."</p>

<p>Well, maybe it usually doesn't go quite like that.</p>
