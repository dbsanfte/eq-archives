   <font class="ArticleText"><B>Tann:</B> You've played EQ, UO, and AO. Any other games?<p><B>Beryl:</B> Meridian 59 and AC, too. I like the genre...lol.<p><B>Tann:</B> Could you touch on each game, highlight its strengths and weaknesses, and relate those to DAoC?<p><B>Beryl:</B> Sure. Starting with oldest to newest, 59 was the first graphic MUD I played, other than being an RPG, has almost nothing in common with DAoC.  It was a great game for it's time, the only place where lots of folks came regularly and got together to kill things and each other.  Its graphics were dated and things we expect from newer games weren't there, but hey, it was first.<p>UO was nuts when it first started, thousands of people logged on it the first day, killing the servers.  As things settled down, the game became playable but was always morphing into a newer version.  Entire wipes of player status occurred as they reinvented how players should interact in game terms.  The game didn't really promote group adventures and player killing was normal part of play with few safe zones at all.  The trade system in the game grew to be one of the best parts of the game.  DAoC is doing a very similar trade system, refining it a little, but it has a similar feel.  If DAoC gets vendors in the game for players to use, they'll have the best system yet for tradeskills.<p>AC and EQ shared tons of similar parts, the graphics were good, world physics were good, a sophisticated chat system to get together and group for adventures.  I think the only serious divergence they had was AC tended toward building large guilds, with the most advanced system for guild recruitment, where you paid for being in a guild but reaped benefits as well.  EQ never got that detailed, but they were up and running first.  Since EQ's and AC's biggest achievement was getting lots of folks together, it should be noted that this was one of it's biggest downfalls.  Casual gamers were completely put off by the end game.  Unless you belonged to a large guild, you had little hope of fighting the dragons and gods in the game for the really great gear in the game.  <p>DAoC takes the guild approach similar to AC but without the hierarchy being so rigid.  There are tons of features in the guild makeup in DAoC and you can set ranks and titles, payment fees, even what level of information guildmembers can see in their guild chat window.  It's very cool.<p>The graphics of DAoC are similar to both EQ and AC as well, with the exceptions of spell effects, which are the best seen so far in a online game. I think the only game out there right now that does something better than DAoC is AO. The mission generator in AO is really a good idea as there is so much potential there to tweak the game. DAoC has taken a more conventional approach to quests and even though there are multiple endings for the players, it's still &quot;Go see Fred to get his FedEx thing and take it to Bob.&quot;<p><B>Tann:</B> These games as they've been released, at least the successful ones, had substantial and noticeable &quot;leaps&quot; in technology.  UO was a vast improvement over Meridian, and introduced never-before-seen technology, and EQ managed to do the same when it was released. Even AC managed to make advancements to the genre as it incorporated &quot;on the fly&quot; technology; content could be added at any time.  What new technologies has Camelot got in store for us?  What is the great next leap that will move the genre forward?<p><B>Beryl:</B> I don't think Camelot is so much revolutionary as it is evolutionary, and to some degree it's not even that.  Most of the gameplay is just like all the other games.  Even the highly touted &quot;realm vs. realm&quot; combat is really just a specialized version of UO's chaos vs. order wars.  The one really nice new feature they did was the incorporation of fighting styles.  These are combat abilities that players can use in melee to really give them something to do besides stand there and swat back and forth with the critters.<p><B>Tann:</B> High - End game for Camelot will focus completely on PvP and realm defense and attack, but I see some real logistical problems.  The broadcast channel that exists is not supposed to be in release, so how will players coordinate defense and attack?  Is high-level success once more going to be delegated to uber guilds, and those that aren't part of these type of guilds watching from news sites as events unfold on their server?<p><B>Beryl:</B> I actually mentioned this same thing on the beta boards.  I really think they'll have to go back to allow some type of broadcast in the RvR (realm vs. realm) areas.  They really have a nice chat setup and it looks like it would be fairly simple to add another layer to the chat program specifically for RvR.  It would just be it's own tab and you could switch to it when you got into the frontier zones.<p><B>Tann:</B> Guilds exist in games like UO, EQ, and AC for specific reasons, like-minded players can join together toward common goals.  But I don't see any reason for guilds in Camelot.  Each realm, if you will, is already created to be the ultimate guild.  There won't be any uber encounters that require more than an eight-person team, and realm defense is the responsibility of everyone.  Wouldn't it make for a tighter, more cohesive realm and foster a tighter community if Camelot worked from the premise that each realm is a guild, and each person was important?  That high-level players should spend as much time helping lower-level players get skills and levels to make sure their realm is as powerful as possible?<p><B>Beryl:</B> Absolutely.  I spend a lot of my time yakking on gamer forums about DAoC now that the NDA has been lifted, and the most common myth I have to dispel is the PvP aspects of the game.  Players have gotten used to thinking that if the guy standing next to them got to kill Foozle first then they were going to get ahead and ultimately be more uber.  Nothing could be further from the truth in DAoC.  While the end game will be all about PKing the other realms, everything leading up to that point should be about cooperation.  The guy you tried to KS that bear from back at level 10 is going to be the same guy who's supposed to be watching your back at 50.  Players are just going to have to reinvent how they level up.  Getting to 50 first in your realm won't mean anything if you don't have a couple dozen other players hitting 50 right away.  You can't fight the other realm solo.  As far as the guilds go, I think lots of guilds will form, simply because players like to hang out with their friends.  In UO there was almost no reason to be in a guild, but there were hundreds on each server.  The big difference in DAoC will again be rethinking how guilds are supposed to work.  Uber guilds, and you and I both know this well, try and slash each others throats in EQ.  It's become the norm.  In DAoC, guild leaders will have to plan attacks and defenses if they want to succeed. No doubt it will be interesting to watch how it works out.<p><B>Tann:</B> Camelot's version of the uber encounter is going to be realm defense and attack.  With three realms and possibly thousands of players on a server, how much stress testing has been done for these encounters?  I'm pointing specifically to games like EQ; you get 60+ players in a zone all with a common goal, attacking and defending, and things start to bog down, players start to go linkdead, and as players die and cast spells polygon count increases and there are times when it's almost impossible to move, let alone participate.<p><B>Beryl:</B> I'm not sure how they do it, but DAoC seems to work well with 800 people in the same zone.  Since there are no zones in the outdoor areas, you have hundreds of folks in the same zone constantly, but somehow the game doesn't turn into a slideshow.  I haven't seen hundreds in the RvR yet, although that would be really fun, since they are doing beta like the real game and making everyone level up, so in the RvR I've never seen more than a 40 people.  I don't expect it to be any worse than the normal areas of the outdoor areas. <p><B>Tann:</B> You've been in DAoC beta since phase 2. Could you walk us through the phases, and explain at least from your perspective the milestone or event that heralded the progression from one phase to the next?  Exactly how different is phase 4 from phase 2, and how close is phase 4, content wise, going to be to final release?<p><B>Beryl:</B> Well, phase two was like a week for me, so I can't really say what changed to make it phase three, but I do know that's when Albion went live, so that was probably it.  Most of three was spent getting RvR started up and balancing Albion against Midgard.  Phase four was the introduction of guilds to the game.  Phase four, of course, will eventually be identical to the release version, and it seems to be tracking well.  Two weeks ago I was pretty skeptical about Oct 16 going live, but they have been burying us in content.  New dungeons, siege weapons, the actual RvR frontier areas all added in the last week.  Seems to be a patch per day adding new areas to the game.  All but two tradeskills are in, we are still missing some dungeons, stealth classes are still due, and gameworld physics aren't in, probably since they affect stealth classes mostly.  By and large, beta 4 is quickly becoming the release version.<p><B>Tann:</B> Could you give us a history of the chars you play and talk about that big dirty word &quot;game balance&quot;?  Are the classes balanced, or are we going to be watching as classes are nerfed in the future?  And if DAoC is forcing players to level naturally, how much fine tuning can they really have done to make sure classes between realms are balanced, that siege skills and weapons work as intended, and that the game isn't going to ship with an entire area of game that hasn't really been tested?<p><B>Beryl:</B> I play anything that doesn't move out of reach.  I've played Midgard thanes, skalds, and spirit masters; Albion wizards, clerics, friars, mercenaries, and minstrels; Hiberian eldritch, blademasters, druids, heroes, and now a bard.  At first, my wizards were so overpowered it was crazy.  Even the eldritch started out off the scale, capable of taking red critters out with a little work.  My melee classes were all dead on, soloing blues well and the occasional yellow which would be a tough fight.  They took the casters down a notch, but they can still solo yellows consistently.  The recent fix for this was the lowering of the max exp per kill so that, while killing a yellow con critter will get you more exp, it's not twice what a blue was, which it used to be.  So killing yellows, who take a lot more power to kill, isn't really worth it.  As far as testing it all goes, we still have about a month, if they get the stealth classes to us in the next week of two, we'll give them a good once-over.  If they come later than that, well....<p><B>Tann:</B> You haven't been completely happy about all aspects of DAoC. In a message you posted you said, &quot;Heh if they don't stop hiring Verant burnouts to make key parts of DAoC it'll never get done. I swear they are lifting the EQ quest system and we know how much that is =P&quot;  Twofold question here, how responsive has Camelot staff been to player concerns, and give us a rundown on the areas you're not happy with, and how you'd like to see them advance?<p><B>Beryl:</B> Dev team support of the beta testers has been really good in some areas and kind of slow in others.  The slowdown really seemed to come when Beta 4 rolled around.  In beta 3 almost anything we suggested showed up in the next patch or two, was just amazing.  In beta 4, I really think they got too much input or the team leaders just lost it.  Some spell icons and effects where broken over a month ago and they still haven't been fixed.  Kind of hard to balance a class when some of their defensive spells don't work.  The quest system and dungeons are my biggest complaint; they are right out of EQ and there is so much opportunity they are missing here.  In traditional RPGs a big role was held by those stealth classes.  They led their groups into dangerous areas, looking for traps, secret doors, and ambushes.  In a game like EQ they are totally worthless.  Who needs detect traps when you can just print out the map and see where you need to avoid?  It would be a lot more challenging and fun to have quests and dungeons created on the fly like the AO mission generator.  Since the dungeon or quest hasn't been seen before, you don't know what to expect, greatly enhancing the experience.  I mean, the toughest dungeons in EQ are about as scary and intimidating as walking through the outdoor regions. DAoC could have been better.<p><B>Tann:</B> I've spoken to &quot;powergamers&quot; who aren't happy with Camelot.  They consider it a casual player's game, with no real skill involved in leveling. Because it is so easy, there is no reason to feel a sense of accomplishment when you do. Is Camelot geared more towards the casual player, or are there aspects that will manage to draw the powergamers in?<p><B>Beryl:</B> I expect powergamers will be disappointed in DAoC in some aspects.  Powergamers love being first--it's an ego thing.  Being first gets you little in DAoC, you'll just get to sit around waiting for the rest to catch up.  The more social powergamers will really like DAoC.  Where as a lone-wolf powergamer will be bored to death at 50, the first guild to get to 50 is going to be the first out into the RvR area and score a lot of fast realm points.  So an uber guild, we'll say FoH for instance, coming to DAoC will love being first in RvR and be the guys to beat to regain your realm's relics.  If you can stand to share the glory with your friends, you'll love DAoC. If you are into doing your own thing, you probably won't be happy.  As far as casual gamers go, the game is perfect for them.  They can take all the time they need to level up and when they get to the RvR area, they can get help for the veteran power gamers.<p><B>Tann:</B> How much will the loss of a relic actually effect a realm?  I mean, is there any real compelling reason to get it back other than status?<p><B>Beryl:</B> Yes, losing relics adversely affects your realm and increases the other realm's effectiveness.  They haven't set the relics in stone yet, but some ideas are more power, quickness, and endurance.  Lose your relic and the whole realm loses a couple points of power, while the realm who took the relic gains a couple points.  That and the realm points.  Capturing relics gains you realm points, which can be used to gain favors from your land, i.e. uber weapon, armor, or whatever.  Again, realm points and relics aren't in yet, so we don't really know what the effects are and what you can buy with the points, these are just some things being worked out.<p><B>Tann:</B> Release day for these games hasn't always run the smoothest for this genre--UO and EQ had some real problems.  Camelot recently added a lot of players to help stress test, and it has created real issues of lag.  Patches crawl when downloading, and it's a nightmare moving in towns. How confident are you that Camelot's release isn't going to be another case of not anticipating demand and a series of headaches for gamers?<p><B>Beryl:</B> I'm 100% confident that on release day Camelot will crawl like a drunken spider, but that's the way things go.  I was just looking at the beta server and it had 1200 people playing.  That's about one third of the planned target load.  Hard to anticipate how many customers you will have on opening day and how many resources you can talk the suits into giving without cashflow coming in.  So, they always go conservative and always get snowed.  I'll be out and about on opening day, game freak that I am.<p><B>Tann:</B> In every game there are aspects of anti-social behavior: kill stealing, player killing, ninja looting, etc.  Do you think Camelot has the tools in place to combat these aspects of game play?<p><B>Beryl:</B> This is one of their best aspects of the game and I alluded to it up above.  The guys you level up with are on your team.  You make a bad name for yourself on the way up with anti-social behavior, there's no end game for you.  You can't fight the other realms solo.  If everyone in your realm hates you, you can't join the other realm, you have no place to go.  So you have to work with your realm mates, building the best war machine possible for the coming onslaught.  Aside from that morality aspect, there are hardwired blocks to most anti-social behavior.  If anyone helps in the killing of a mob, the exp is shared by those players, so you can't KS.  Loot is automatically distributed by the game, so you can't ninja your groups kills.  Only players who killed something can loot it, so you can't ninja others kills.  You can't kill anyone in your realm, only in the other, so you can't get PKed unless you're in an area where that's the whole point of being there.  Other types of abuse, like verbal assaults, can be handled by the on-site customer support folks.<p><B>Tann:</B> Do you think Camelot has the content and resources to compete with the EQ juggernaut?  Look into the future, a year from now. Who's going to be at the top of the MMORPG hill?<p><B>Beryl:</B> DAoC has lots of reasons why it should empty out EQ servers and a few why it won't.  The game is fundamentally a better all-around game than EQ.  The end game in DAoC is more accessible and challenging than EQ as well.  Where DAoC has liabilities is in it's rehash of old ways of doing things.  Up until you get to the RvR in Camelot, you get a real sense of been there, done that.  You kill mobs to gain levels so you can kill bigger mobs.  You do quests which revolve around two concepts: deliveries and assassinations.  I have come to the conclusion that people who write fantasy quests for online games have never read fantasy books.  How exciting would Conan be if he spent his time killing badgers so he could retrieve a lucky rabbit's foot for a forgetful leprechaun so that he'll give Conan a jug that he can take back to a merchant in town who will thank him with a pair of magic booties?  It boggles my mind how these companies get away with the obvious child abuse of hiring eight-year-olds to design their quests.  Ok, enough digressing.  I think about this time next year there won't be any new MMORPGs coming out. They will be waiting out the release of Star Wars Online.  I mean really, who's not going to want to play SWO at release?  Between now and then, AC2 is coming out.  I don't expect AC2 to draw off a lot of EQ or DAoC folks, but it will maintain the Microsoft franchise.  DAoC will definitely draw off a lot of EQ, perhaps a third, simply because it's new and won't require a blood oath from some uber guild to enjoy the end game.</font>
