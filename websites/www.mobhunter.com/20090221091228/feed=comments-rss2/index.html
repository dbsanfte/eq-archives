		<description>I have to agree that i think this is an Andy Kaufman style prank...although, given the very serious history of the Phoenix family (cults, drug over dose, abuse, etc.) I think Joaquin is going to be able to play the crazy card for a long time in this gag.  

I hate to admit it, but I can't wait to see what he does next.  Andy Kaufman said: 

"Pure entertainment is not an egotistical lady singing boring songs onstage for two hours and people in tuxes clapping whether they like it or not. It`s the real performers on the street who can hold people`s attention and keep them from walking away. "

I hope this turns out to be a joke (so I won't feel bad about laughing at a crazy young guy), but either way I'm not going to be able to keep my eyes off this train wreck.</description>

		<description>Thanks for the new link, cgoodno.

If it turns out to be a hoax, then the question becomes whether Letterman was in on it. If he was, then both he and Phoenix deserve Emmys for that appearance, because it was spectacular.</description>

		<description>New link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXpYk7WGN5Y

Now, as far as I'm concerned, the only difference is that Leno doesn't actively get people who are obviously going through some mental/social/personal changes and isn't really there.  I don't like the uneasiness of it all and would rather not publicize the family member who's not all there.</description>

		<description>Steve -

According to your own original write-up about the panel, there were complaints.  That's also occurred with other 38 Studios presentations thus far.  However, this seemed to catch you off guard.  I was trying to explain to you why those complaints occur.  

Look at it this way:  NYCC runs a limited number of days, and attendees can only attend a limited number of sessions.  Most attendees make some hard choices about which panels they do and don't want to see.  If they pick the 38 Studios session, they are missing out on others that occur at that same time.  They sacrificed time to listen to you, and by the time they realize you guys are only talking about your inner corporate policies or studio process, it's too late to attend another session at that hour.  

If the session had been advertised as "38 Studios Discusses Their Own Corporate Policy, Studio Process, Managerial Techniques, and Business Model", do you think anyone would have attended?  In my experience, 38 promotes these things with a vague "come and learn more about our company and the development of our upcoming MMO, Copernicus".  (38's press releases about this panel do exactly that in this case, too.)  When they get there, only the first half of that turns out to be true.

In a sense, you are correct, no one is forced to listen.  However, 38 kept them from attending another, presumably more interesting session at NYCC, and instead presented them a session on internal policy.  Some folks are going to complain, Steve.  That's not what they came to see.    

Consider this journalist's take on it; 

"38 Studios set up a panel after two years of development on their self-proclaimed masterpiece to describe to us a business model....However, we didn’t come to Comic Con to hear a business model. We showed up in hopes that we would find out something about this game that is supposed to change gaming."(Link:  http://www.thatvideogameblog.com/2009/02/08/38-studios-fails-to-deliver-at-nycc/) 

Obviously, he wasn't happy, and pointed out that not only did people attend the hour-long session, they lined up an hour prior to attend.  That's not considerate of their time, bro. 

I hope you can see what I'm trying to say.  This kind of thing just doesn't come across well, IMO.</description>

		<description>I think Phoenix is either 1) totally friggin' bonkers or 2) playing an elaborate joke on everyone.

Either way, Letterman was fantastic and if it was a joke he played it up like a pro.

		<description>Pig - If you attended the panel and didn't find it useful, that's your prerogative. However, plenty of folks did, and this time around we actually said a fair amount about our art style and our production philosophies.

Based on the kind words I received from many attending, I don't think we were disrespectful toward anyone. As for their time, well, the doors at the back of the room were unlocked and there were plenty of other cool things going on for them to check out.

I find it rather odd to imply that we're wasting your time by talking when you're not being forced to listen.</description>
