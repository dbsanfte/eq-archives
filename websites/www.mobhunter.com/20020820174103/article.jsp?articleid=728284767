   <font class="ArticleText"><BIG>Twin Cities Invaded</BIG><p>On Thursday Kohath and I had lunch at the Mall of America and then headed down to the first floor just outside Camp Snoopy (the mall's indoor amusement park) to pay a visit to the <a href="http://eqinvasion.station.sony.com/index.jsp">EQ Invasion Tour</a>. To be honest, our expectations weren't all that high. We knew it was a trailer that had a few computers on it demoing a scaled-down version of EverQuest, plus some free stickers and CDs and such. Actually, though, we (or at least I, since Kohath bailed early) had a pretty good time there.<p>Finding the trailer was harder than it should have been, as it was stuck behind an escalator and an elevator, which made spotting it rather difficult. Once there, we were greeted by the four-man team that runs the EQ Invasion Tour. Two of the guys were promotions people hired for the job, while the other two were actual SOE employees: Saiphos the Elfslayer, who was head GM on Veeshan before the cross-server GM team idea was implemented, and Auric, who was a message board moderator and a member of the dev team for Luclin.<p>The trailer drew a good number of visitors. A lot were long-time EverQuest junkies (including a father and son who had driven 100 miles to attend), but many of the people had never seen the game before and gave it a try on some of the stations set up for playing. The scaled-down EQ on the trailer's severs had about nine zones on it. I ran from Qeynos to Everfrost, but my attempt to zone into Permafrost was foiled because the zone wasn't included. So much for my efforts to entertain the crowd with a look at Vox.<p>Saiphos and Auric were great guys, and we ended up chatting for several hours. During this time many other EQ players came by for conversation. Let me tell you, nothing brought my ego back down to a normal size faster than chatting with someone who has been playing the game for years and seeing the blank look in their eyes when I said I wrote for a site called Mobhunter. (See, Kohath, that's why Mennix interviewed me, so kiss off.)<p><TABLE><TR><TD><A HREF="http://www.linkdead.com/invasion/inv1.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/invasion/inv1s.jpg" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD><A HREF="http://www.linkdead.com/invasion/inv2.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/invasion/inv2s.jpg" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD><A HREF="http://www.linkdead.com/invasion/inv3.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/invasion/inv3s.jpg" BORDER=0></A></TD></TR><TR><TD><I>Kohath, bag in hand, checks out the table of free stuff.</I></TD><TD><I>Saiphos talks to a visitor as Tyra Banks checks him out.</I></TD><TD><I>Auric (blonde guy in grey t-shirt) attracts a crowd.</I></TD></TR></TABLE><p>One of the computers was running a continuous movie showing previews of Planes of Power and EverQuest 2. Both were older demos from the E3 era, but they were still kind of neat to see. The PoP demo showed a lot of fight scenes with various gods and monsters, while the EQ2 demo panned around some scenery and showed off that big dragon.<p><TABLE><TR><TD><A HREF="http://www.linkdead.com/invasion/inv4.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/invasion/inv4s.jpg" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD><A HREF="http://www.linkdead.com/invasion/inv5.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/invasion/inv5s.jpg" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD><A HREF="http://www.linkdead.com/invasion/inv6.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/invasion/inv6s.jpg" BORDER=0></A></TD></TR><TR><TD><I>A wide variety of facial expressions promises to make EQ2 rather lively.</I></TD><TD><I>A shadowknight fights some rotting ogre guy in Planes of Power.</I></TD><TD><I>Poor redheaded dude is about to lose his head to the Tribunal.</I></TD></TR></TABLE><p>Did I learn any inside scoops and secrets of the upcoming expansion and sequel? Not really. In fact, I was giving these guys the skinny on a lot of recent news, because they've been on the road for two months now. Saiphos did provide interesting stories about the FoH crowd on Veeshan (Furor is actually a 14-year-old girl with a bed-wetting problem) and Auric told stories of his days sharing a cube with Absor (turns out Alan goes through 3-4 buckets of fried chicken every day and frequently cries himself into a deep sleep at his desk).<p>Okay, so maybe they didn't say that stuff. But it was fun to chat with them get a picture of what their jobs are like, and meeting other players was cool. I feel a bit bad for Saiphos and Auric, as they still have about five weeks left of the tour before they head home. These guys are out on the road the whole time, driving their truck across the country and staying in hotels along the way. I didn't ask them if they ever washed those EQ t-shirts they wore, and I didn't want to get close enough to find out.<p>Anyway, I'd recommend going to the EQ Invasion if it comes to your area. If you just stand around and swipe the free stickers it won't be much fun, but if you take the initiative and talk to a few people then you might find yourself having a great time. If you see Saiphos and Auric, tell them Moorgard says hello.<p>By the way, they did let me know that the New York stop is going to be a special one, with product giveaways and a mini-FanFaire feel to it. Definitely check that one out if you can.<p><BIG>Cap-n-Crunch</BIG><p>Oh, the hubub over a mana cap. There is one, there isn't one... it's this, it's that. Rich Waters finally <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000647.html">cleared the air</a> on Dev Corner:<p><B>The mana cap has been a big topic lately, so I'd like to take a minute to address it. Mana caps have been in EverQuest since the game was released. They haven't been changed, made more restrictive, or added at a later date in order to keep casters down. The mana cap as it is now has been there since you created your character, and only recently become a topic of concern for players. <p>Most things in EverQuest have a point of diminishing returns - a point where adding more of a resource yields little or no improvement. This is most obvious in your basic stats, where you can easily see that after your strength score hits 255 it does you no good to put on more strength enhancing gear. These kinds of caps aren't intended to cause you distress, and in many ways they can help support a well balanced game system.<p>While we have an appreciation for the benefits that stat caps can bring to a system, we're also willing to look at things like this with an objective eye. The mana cap on worn items has been in since release, and hasn't come up before as an issue that players felt overly limited by. With all the attention focused on the cap in recent days, the dev team looked it over and we agree - there's no reason to place an artificial cap on mana enhancing items.<p>On test server now, we've changed the rule so that players get full value from all mana increasing worn items. We expect this will go live with the next patch.</B><p>Further, Rich added a P.S. to his comments:<p><B>This change just affects + Mana items. We didn't change the way a players mana is calculated from intelligence or wisdom, and we're happy with how that part of the system works.</B><p>Now casters can be happy--or at least move on to the next topic that they're unhappy about.<p>Removal of the mana cap is a good thing. I'd scream if I reached a HP cap, so I can see where casters are coming from (even though most would never reach said cap anyway, but I digress).<p><BIG>Things Just Don't Stack Up</BIG><p>Notice in the new UI how when you have stackable items on your cursor, and click on another stack of the same thing to combine them, the stack ends up on your mouse pointer instead of in your inventory? I did, too. Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000648.html">says</a>:<p><B>That was a bug. It's supposed to stack those items into inventory, not onto the cursor. It should be fixed now on Test, and should go Live with the next patch.</B><p>Sounds like next patch is going to be a doosy! I wish to echo Kohath's comments from yesterday that the <B>/camp desktop</B> bug needs to be fixed pronto. Having to press the escape key over and over to quit EQ is costing precious seconds of my life that I'll never get back. Snap to it, Verant!<p><BIG>Just Stay Out of Acrylia. Seriously.</BIG><p>In the Velious expansion you had a choice of three paths to take: giant, dragon, or dwarf. Each path had rewards--sure, not all balanced with the risk involved, but each faction had compelling reasons for choosing it.<p>Similarly, Shadows of Luclin has three end-game paths. You can kill the Emperor in Ssra Temple and complete the key quest to Vex Thal; do the key quest to High Inquisitor Seru's room and waste him; or finish the key quest in the Acrylia Caverns zone and visit the inner areas there. (Notice the pattern of long key quests no matter which way you go.)<p>But while farming Vex Thal is extremely rewarding, and Seru drops some very nice items, nobody much takes the third path. Maybe that's because a guild called <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fringofvalor44669frm33">Ring of Valor</a> did so, only to find the drops in AC are ridiculously sub-par considering the effort needed to get people there. Not only that, but Verant eventually removed a mob called the chieftan that was needed to get to the boss mob.<p>It was announced when the chieftan was removed that a fix was in the works, but Absor told <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/">Casters Realm</a> that changes to the inner part of Acrylia Caverns will not be happening anytime soon:<p><B>Inner Acrylia is not really on the time line right now. We're aware of the concerns that some players have about the zone, but we've got a full plate right now <p>I'm sorry, we just won't have time to think about looking into Inner Acrylia for a while yet.</B><p>Well, that sucks for Ring of Valor or any other guild that invested the considerable amount of time needed to get those keys. Add in the buggy, boring, and bloated Ring of Fire event and you have absolutely zero reason to visit the Acrylia Caverns zone ever again. Oh, except to get your Luclin shard. Yip-frikkin-pee.<p><BIG>The Prologue Rolls on</BIG><p>Nathan Pearce's tribe of Web goons has updated the <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/power/prologue.jsp">Planes of Power</a> site yet again, adding another chapter to the unfolding story that explains how 500,000 people will be invading the homes of the gods this October.<p>I can't really tell what the story is about yet, but if it ends with me getting phat loot, I'll be happy.<p><BIG>In Closing...</BIG><p>I find I must use this space to make a non-EverQuest comment on something that has been eating away at me all week.<p>YOU STUPID PEOPLE WHO VOTED TO KEEP RJ HELTON INSTEAD OF THE GORGEOUS AND TALENTED <A HREF="http://idolonfox.msn.com/contestants/ind/christina_christian/default.asp">CHRISTINA CHRISTIAN</A> CAN DIE IN A FIRE! WHAT THE @#$% WERE YOU THINKING??? CHRISTINA HAS MORE TALENT IN HER (perfect, enthralling) LITTLE TOE THAN RJ HAS IN HIS WHOLE $%&amp;*ING BODY! I HATE EVERYONE WHO VOTED FOR RJ AND I HOPE YOU DIE, DIE, DIE!!!<p>Okay, I feel a little better.<p>Hey RJ--you're next, loser!</font>
