<h2>Comments: After Omens</h2>

<p>The problem that I see so far with the OoW armor is that it has very low AC.  A helmet with 120HP but only 27AC is essentially useless to a Warrior.  Unless there is some OoW armor hiding out there somewhere that I am not aware of, the tank classes will still need to do the old Elemental-->Time grind to get the necessary AC to be able to tank in GoD.</p>

<p>I used to love playing EQ but most of my friends have stopped and so will I, here are some of the resons. </p>

<p>The way I see it, is that the problem with OOW, is that the causale player has been completly screwed and lied to.<br />
(here I am thinking about the task system witch promished (gold and green woods) a danish expresion and deliverd broken trash.<br />
Hence many of them (the causaul players will stop playing EQ) there simply is nothing for them to do at 65.</p>

<p>Another big problem is that there is no new blood in EQ only twinks from borred Ubers with no life.</p>

<p>EQ is dying and what will be left are the sad remains of people who devotet there entire life to this game, hopefully not many.</p>

<p>SOE prepare to melt the servers in the near future, that might help EQ surviveanother year.  </p>

<p>Last but not least for me ranger has been screwed again.<br />
For me this was the last time, after 4 years of playing I am going to sell my Ranger to some clueless Noob on Ebay and hope he will help bring the doom to EQ even faster, so we can get good MMORPG that evolves not stagnate.</p>

<p>We all know this to be truth just need to be statet here.<br />

<p>I've sat around and chatted with mostly RL friends in EQ and they all agree from casual to uber it's time to pull up anchor and head on out.</p>

<p>OoW is a nice last hurrah at least i will give them that much.</p>

<p>Not all casual players are 65! I consider myself a casual player and my highest char is now only 48. I do have many alts in the 40s but even so there is no need to assume everyone is 65. </p>

<p>It was pointed out at the summit by Loral this summer that the largest number of players are in the sub 55 range! </p>

<p>I spent my play session last night rolling a new char and exploring the tutorial which I have never done. Wonderful system but it needs to be seriously looked at a bit more. I went in with some totally newbie friends who had played it before and got so confused they skipped most of the tutorial! I played with them and walked them through and it was great.</p>

<p>Once the task system in Omens gets tweaked I think it will suit the casual player admirably.</p>

<p>I for one hate the timer on LDON. It makes it feel way to rushed. Rarely will a group take the time to do chests, even after compeletion. I would not like to see expeditions get timers either or at least make them optional.</p>

<p>I have not yet done any expeditions myself. I still need to get 2 of my hydra up past 45 before I can attempt it. I am hoping it will fun like LDON without the time pressure. The respawns seem odd to me but once I am in it I might appreciate them better.</p>

<p>This has to be the best expansion for the casual player in a long time.  I have done more, enjoyed more than I have since my early LDON days.</p>

<p>Casual players have begged for an alternate upgrade path from raiding.  This expansion offers that in spades.  For the first time in a long time, I've been able to upgrade 4-5 pieces of my gear without having to spend megahours repeating the same old tired missions.  Not only that, but I've only explored a portion of the zones that are available to me.</p>

<p>Casual players asked that not all zones be locked up.  With this expansion, only one zone is locked.  Everyone is free to group in almost every single zone provided.  That provides everyone with more freedom to do more things.   If you are 65 and cannot find anything to do in this expansion, then you are correct.  You should leave the game.<br />

<p>I keep hearing that most players are sub 55 but I wonder if those are little or non-played alts.  I mean I have 3 characters over 60 that i play regularly and I have three level 1s that were on all the time(I wasn't playing).  </p>

<p>but I have over 30 characters... all but my three main characters are under 55, but they are not indicative of what I play... look in any under 40 exp zone, and you will see there are almost no players at those levels.  I think that statistic means nothign unless those under 55s have been played more than an hour in the last week, and I bet the vast majority have not(outside of baz mules)</p>

<p>I get sick of hearing people say most TOONS are under 40.  It may be true, but anyone who plays the game, sees that most PLAYERS are bumping top end.</p>

<p>The majority of players under 50 statistic includes active players and excludes bazaar mules.  The majority of active characters are under level 50.  I don't know exactly what defines "active" but probably logging on once a week counts.</p>

<p>This does not mean, however, that they play the most amount of time.  I bet the most amount of time online goes to 65+ characters.  However, time online or not, we all pay the same price.</p>

<p>I heard another unattributable statistic that 85% of EQ players are not level 65 raiders.  Again, I have few details on the statistic.</p>

<p>Statistics alone don't tell us what Everquest needs.  What it does tell me, however, is that the bulk of players don't need high-end raid content.  They need features that help them play the game.  They need features that help EQ fit into their busy lives.  They need features that help players under 50 find a group, find a place to hunt, and find an easy way out when they have to go.</p>

<p>The features I agree with the most are the features that affect players of all levels such as the task system, the chat channels, the LFG tool, the tribute changes, the augment swapping changes, the LDON item returns, progressive equipment systems like the LDON point system, and instanced content with scaling level ranges.</p>

<p>The features I do not agree with include flagging solutions that only support high-end raiding guilds, raid flags that lead to single-group hunting zones (like Fire), the instancing of the Plane of Time (high development time for a two-year old zone), focus solutions that only support high-end raiding equipment, and large power gaps in equipment between raiders and single-group hunters.</p>

<p>For Everquest to continue to grow they need to get more players who only have a few hours a week to play.  Mini-games, improved task systems, enhanced LDON-style dungeons, better grouping tools, and an easier interface to learn all help bring new players in.</p>

<p>Everquest cannot survive by only supporting the upper 15% of the player population.  They need to bring new players in.</p>

<p>SOE does a good job of implementing solutions that affect the majority of players and I expect to see more in the future.  They know their business far better than I.</p>

<p>I just wanted to be able to progress again as a non-raider. OoW does that--though I am worried that the nerf bat will hit the drop rates soon. Still, it's exciting to be getting upgrades off of mobs.</p>

<p>Exciting enough for the moment to overshadow the fact that the zones appear to be tactically pretty boring. WoS is described as the new BoT, but tactically it's the new DL. And I hated DL.</p>

<p>These days if I've got nothing to mez I'm used to charming, but I'd feel guilty exposing my group to the risks of charm just because it's fun for me given the nerfed rewards. So instead I just hope for an incompetent puller.</p>

<p>Maybe in a few weeks I'll have found the zones that are fun for me to play in (my friends will tell you I just refuse to play in a lot of boring zones these days). Or maybe in a few weeks I'll be really missing LDoN.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Bahlzaq at September 29, 2004 03:16 PM</strong></p>
<p>I wasn't arguing with you at all loral, but I will say that a LOT of the fols I know who consider themselves "non-raiders" still raid, now whether that is choice or lack of options, I will leave up to the individual to decide.  I am not arguing that EQ doesn't need to be fun throughout, but it is ultimately a leveling treadmill, and I think SOE has done a remarkable job at continuing the treadmill past the top end.  I ultimately think things like TLC and required levels should have been put in from the start and AA never should have come into the game, and instead people should have continued to "level on up." to 100 or beyond.</p>

<p>It is hard to balance because they NEED to keep both camps happy as long as possible.  You and I may disagree on when to drop off the top end and say "This guy will play non stop I will never be able to make a game engaging for him and a "casual""</p>

<p>I will also say that I think there is plenty in the game already for folks below 55... I know that is a tired thing to hear, but OT is no less fun now than three years ago...  If you try to lump "casuals" with "slowpokes" still trying to play to 50 then that is crazy.  I am not saying taking your time is bad... but the game is about grinding through levels... If you don't want a game about that, then I don't see how you could be happy with EQ.  </p>

<p>I think even if there is a camp of players who have been playing long enough to be tired of the current under 55 content, but still plan to be under 55 for some time, they will be impossible to design for.  What could they be looking for?</p>

<p>I see new under 55 content as mostly benefitting retreads, and although generalizations suck, I think the majority of retreads, wouldn't retread if they didn't want to conquer the treadmill again, and they will burn through that content anyway.</p>

<p>I now and always have considered myself a casual, and I think more under 55 content is a true waste of time.  I am not saying I represent everyone, but I honestly can't imagine who would be looking for this new under 55 content...</p>

<p>Here is my take on Omens of War:</p>

<p>From a graphics and sound perspective, I believe the expansion was very well done.  I am very happy with the look, feel, and overall atmosphere of the expansion.  That said, I have some guildmates who are having serious video problems since Omens went live - to the point where they can't play.  Obviously this is very frustrating for them and I hope that SOEs tech support team can find and fix the issues quickly.</p>

<p>On content:  Most of the zones are set up very well for what would seem to be their intended level ranges.  I especially like how some zones, like the causeway, get tougher the further into them you go.  This allows folks to move deeper in for more challenge and more rewards.</p>

<p>The new epic quests which have been added are, at least from what I have seen and read, very epic.  They bring back the feel of the original in that this is something that transcends the simple act of accumulating gear and experience.</p>

<p>However, I have some problems with the content in Omens. First, the instanced expeditions are too thin.  Most players are using them simply as a way to farm experience and a few loot drops.  There needs to be more to them - either some purpose to you being in that area, or more named mobs and loot.  Something to keep folks from clearing them up to one particular room and then sitting there working on spell runes or whatever particular piece of gear they were after.  I don't necessarily think a timer is a good idea - these zones are huge and a timer would unfairly limit less powerful groups.  However, I do think that there should be much more scripting involved.</p>

<p>Second, it is extremely difficult for players to get involved in the storyline of Omens.  The factions only halfway make sense.  I think that people -should- have to pay attention to factions, but they should also be able to actually get involved in the storyline from day 1, rather than having to kill tons of things to raise a faction that may or may not make a difference in the end.  As most players simply ignore faction until someone has posted a powerful quest item on the web, this really only penalizes people who want to explore for the sake of learning.</p>

<p>Finally, while i do very much like the new epic quests, their release has reminded me of what I hate most about EQ - and that is the tendency of most players to focus solely on the levels and the loot and not on the story or the world itself.  People don't go to zones to see somewhere new, they go because it's "better experience" or has a piece of loot they want.  They will happily destroy their faction in their hometown to get an item with better stats from an opposing faction's quest.  To give you an example, the other day some friends and I were in Kaesora getting Xalgoz fangs for the Charasis Key quest.  A group of 66+ players zoned in, and quite politely asked us which epic we were working on that we needed to get into Charasis.  When we told them we just wanted to go there to see the place and find its secrets, they tried (again very politely) to tell us that we were wasting our time.  This to me exemplifies what is very wrong with EQ - the loot mentality that it instills in its players is the same one that eventually burns most players out on the game.</p>

<p>On itemization - This could have been done better.  There are some nice upgrades in Omens, to be sure.  However, there seem to be two classes of gear there - either extremely nice to the point that people fight over it, or okay but not really much better than what people already had.  This lack of a middle ground really hurts - it means that certain mobs and zones get camped to death while others go untouched.</p>

<p>Likewise, the spell runes are better than GoD, but still frustrating to many people.  Along with many of the nice-but-not-awesome items, I think these should probably be changed to rare drops from any mob in their zones, rather than rare drops from named mobs only.</p>

<p>The biggest problem I see with itemization is that the class requirements on many items don't seem to make sense.  I've been seeing a lot of gear that's listed for all hybrid classes, for example.  Since I'm a hybrid, that's great, but if I as a paladin can wear a piece of armor, shouldn't a warrior be able to wear it?  Or a cleric?  Sometimes I really wonder if the people who do itemization for new zones and expansions at SOE really take into account anything that's gone before them in the game.</p>

<p>On difficulty:  I have mixed feelings on this.  I am happy with the challenge level of many encounters - especially some of the encounters I have had deeper in the Omens zones where you really had to pay attention to how the mobs were fighting and come up with a good set of tactics to defeat it.  I also like how you have to pay attention to the environment in some places.  Ideally, I think the challenge of any area should be at least partially (30%) determined by the environment - narrow walkways, water, etc.</p>

<p>However, you could cut the hp of most Omens mobs by 1/3 or even 1/2 and the fights would still be difficult.  As it stands, most encounters basically degenerate into hitting auto-attack and waiting 5 minutes.  While I understand the need for making the mobs tough enough to keep players from clearing out the zone, this is a little extreme.  It's especially glaring when you have a minimal group or one that's low on damage-dealing classes, where individual fights can take nearly ten minutes to complete.  This ultimately just becomes boring.  Longer fights do not generally make for harder fights.</p>

<p>Getting to places isn't very hard once you learn the way there, but it's dangerous enough to keep you on your toes.  I do think that every expansion since at least Legacy of Ykesha has been forcing players to become more and more dependant on invisibility potions, and that's a bad thing.</p>

<p>Overall I think Omens is a good expansion, worth the money, and is much more solid and available than its predecessor, but I also think that it could use a good bit of tweaking and rebalancing.  Then again, the whole game could use that in my view.  There have been so many mistakes made, and so many bandaids applied over the past few years, that it seems impossible that one expansion cold really fix much of anything.</p>

<p>@ scott</p>

<p>I find it laughably ironic that a self admited 'hydra' player would consider himself the least bit 'casual'.</p>

<p>I guess it goes back to the recent article about the terminolgy surrounding the game we play and how many terms mean comopletely different things to different people.</p>

<p>Anyone who continues to pay 5x the normal price of the game a month (5+ accounts) would not be considered casual any more than a person who pays for 1 account but plays 20 hours a day, if you asked any non-eq player on the street.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Horzek at September 29, 2004 06:20 PM</strong></p>
<p>I am already liking one thing about the new Omens and that is the opportunity to get my new spells.  I have spent a few hours there, enough to complete level 66 and a bubble into 67 and I have had the chance to roll on 4 rune drops so far.  Compared to GoD where I spent a lot of time and a pretty fair amount of names killed for only 2 rune drops of which one had to rott and I see a good improvement.</p>

<p>The primary zone I have fought in so far has been Wall of Slaughter which has been pretty neat as far as the mobs go.  The down side is all the rune drops are on Names and there are constant trains there.  At least twice now we were fighting a named and a train was pulled over us.  As the cleric who is concentrating on the tank, when the train comes I am beaten down in a matter of a second or two.  It is sad that people feel it necessary to train folks who have had the good fortune to find themselves a named.</p>

<p>It is for this reason I would like to see the rune drops come from random zone mobs and not necessarily from the names.  There is no point in keeping folks from realising their class potential like this.</p>

<p>Next on my list is the requirement for invis potions all the dang time.  If I am going to have to keep a bunch of invis potions, how about letting me stack them?  Right now I find that keeping 6 or so potions is about right for a trip or two and then I have to go restock.  This does not include the times I have to to naked corpse runs  with a quick stop at the bank for cash and more potions.  I guess at least I dont have to keep buying peris all the time so there is some good from this.</p>

<p>I thought the abilty to make runes dropable and tradeable was neat but now that I am seeing folks selling runes for 100k-200k Im afraid I am beginning to wonder.  That greedy geek that will deny a spell to his group cleric so he can turn around and sell it in pok is just apalling to me.</p>

<p>Hopefully I can yet get that spell or two I need and enough uberness so I can go back and play in GoD again.  I still want to get into KT one day.<br />

<p>The rune sale prices are a function of supply and demand more than anything.  They -should- drop somewhat from where they are now, they're just that high because they're really new and there are a ton of people leveling all of a sudden and wanting them.</p>

<p>You can compare this to the prices for PoP spells - depending on the parchment required, PoP spells all tend to fall into the same general price range in the bazaar.</p>

<p>I do definitely agree that the runes should be random from any mob in the zone though.  As it stands right now, I avoid Wall of Slaughter because it really lives up to its name - and most of it is caused by players, not the mobs.<br />
</p>

<p>I saw rune prices drop from 140 to 80k in three days.  It will take time but as supply goes up and demand goes down we will see the price stabilize at a reasonable level.  I hunted for four hours and we received five runes so they aren't that uncommon.</p>

<p>In a couple of months, expect them to go for under 10k.</p>

<p>"The majority of players under 50 statistic includes active players and excludes bazaar mules. The majority of active characters are under level 50. I don't know exactly what defines "active" but probably logging on once a week counts.</p>

<p>This does not mean, however, that they play the most amount of time. I bet the most amount of time online goes to 65+ characters. However, time online or not, we all pay the same price.<br />
"</p>

<p>Great point. One of the things that seems to escape people with higher playtimes is that not everyone will play the game very often. I've seen a lot of informal posts where people try to track player counts with /who all 30 40, and they tend to focus on the number of players returned, not the names of the players themselves. The raw numbers at any given time are a bit low for those mid level players, but you'll notice a lot of variance in the names of characters logging in from that level range. /who all 65, or /who all 70 will yield the same names, night in, and night out.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people would still like to see LDoN get a boost in terms of equipment. With SOE implementing the option for a partial refund of adventure points when you sell back existing gear, there will be people who don't want to see the system abandoned after SOE had stated they will be making additions to it. The obvious exception would be if new LDoN style adventures in higher level zones would work off of the same point structure (something tells me this will come in the form of the next expansion though.)</p>

<p>Adding new LDoN Zones for higher levels with new faction requirements, but using the existing point system so people can get some value back trading in gear might be the best way to go.</p>

<p>More quests for gear would be a nice addition as well. Something tells me the Task system could eventually serve as a pretty nice way to replace the older quest system.</p>

<p>"I find it laughably ironic that a self admited 'hydra' player would consider himself the least bit 'casual'."</p>

<p>Mostly I consider myself casual because of the amount of time I put into the game. I may play it 10 hours a week.</p>

<p>I mostly play a hydra so that when I do play I am not waiting on groups and also so that my gameplay is more than sitting in a camp waiting for the puller to return. </p>

<p>Yes I have delved deep into the game and learned many of its nuances, but currently I do not put allot of time into the game. Ergo my "casual" stance.<br />

<p>10 Hours per week x 6 accounts = 60 hours per week. Not too casual.</p>

<p>Moe, Ximix has a point.  Those 10 hours/week Scott plays on 6 boxes doesn't sound casual by any stretch of the imagination (except Scott's).</p>

<p>LDoN is dead.  The incentive to grind points for items there is dying.  They need to add a level 70 High Difficulty setting, or the Wayfarer Camps will be ghost towns just like every other old expansion's content.</p>

<p>Oh and they destroyed charm in Omens.  Charm was overpowered in PoP, but what they did to charm in Omens was pretty demented and wrong.</p>

<p>I think many of the zones were rushed. SOE just can't seem to figure out a way to make mob populations realistic. For example there are only 2 zones that have any animal life at all in Omens: Dranik's Scar and Wall of Slaughter. It is very unrealistic to have outdoor zones with zero animal life. Some zones have a mob population density that is excessive. Dranik's Scar looks like rush hour in Manhattan. Ruined City of Dranik is yet another terrible zone with mobs occupying every square inch of real estate like so many bowling pins. I long for the day that zones were handcrafed and mobs were placed with some semblance of meaning--unlike Omens.</p>

<p>Another problem is there are almost no undead nor summoned mobs to speak of despite the fact that many classes get new anti-summoned and anti-undead spells. From a believability point of view these spells are supposed to be "magic" from Kuaa. Why then would those that practice magic in Kuaa create anti-summoned spells when there are zero summoned mob in their lands? Also how convenient that the currency of Kuaa is plat and gold despite being in another universe. Good job making this unreleastic SOE.</p>

<p>Another problem is where are the DC pets in this expansion? Only the newbie zone has them and for all intents and purposes makes them useless for high level players. At least in PoP the devs ensured that most zones had mobs that could be Dire Charmed. Sadly the current Dev Team *hates* charm in every way shape or form. Even Advanced Dire Charm which is listed in the Omens PDF manual that is in your EverQuest directory was removed from the expansion.</p>

<p>Lastly, where is this "war" that is supposed to be ravaging Omens? Where are the massive battles going on? Why aren't the subjegated Dragorn fighting back against the Muramite Legion? Where is the innovation of Omens? Once you get past the Peter Jackson LOTR inspired scenery and eye candy, it's all the same old stuff but with a few new NPC models. The online gaming genre has not been advanced on iota with Omens. It's the same old song and dance--just levels and more loot.</p>

<p>I'd say that at least 70% of my guild or more is poised and ready to migrate to World of Warcraft once it's released at the end of this year. SOE has shown us that all they care about is the money and that releasing a quality, well tuned, innovative expansion is beyond them.</p>

<p>Are there any "events" in OoW like there were in Luclin and Velious? Stuff like those crazy owlbears fighting the wolves, and the giants warring with the dragons and dwarves?</p>

<p>It is that sorta thing that I miss. I want to somehow feel as though I've participated in something, even if just for a little while. I have zero motivation to follow the storyline in OoW. Heck, I don't even know what the storyline is supposed to be in OoW. You certainly can't derive that from the game content itself - you have to get it from the lore section on the website. Just that alone makes me think this was just a "throw 'em some more zones and levels until we can get EQ2 out" thing. Yeah, no black helicopters hovering over my house. =)</p>

<p>I have no comments for the task system, save to say I don't think they were really designed for those level 50+. I think they were added on quite late in the cycle and rushed.</p>

<p>I guess I am not being particularly objective. I have issues with SOE churning out thoughtless expansions that more/less trivialize previous content, especially when the previous content had issues that still haven't been addressed. </p>

<p>Dragorns fighting Muramites? Are you kidding? They seem to get along just fine. How many zones have them standing right next to each other, each peacefully minding their own business? I think we Norrathians have been tragically misinformed about the politics of Kuaa.</p>

<p>IMO what defines a casual player is their ability to commit enough RL time to the game to participate in raiding guilds (or those who just dont like that play style).</p>

<p>I 3 box almost all of the time.  Most of the players in my Guild are multi-boxers and ALL are considered casual.   We all have lives, kids, jobs, etc... that keep us from being able to attend raids on set play schedules.</p>

<p>Much like Scott, the reason I multi-box is so I dont spend a lot of time LFG, or having to beg for help to get something done.  This need is not driven by being anti-social.  Its driven by the fact that the amount of RL time I can commit to EQ is too limited to get anything done otherwise.</p>

<p>Sitting on my @$$ for 2-4 hours mindlessly following a raid leaders instructions so I can build up enough DKP to get some uber item is NOT my idea of a fun game.     All of my characters are level 65, and have very high-end bazaar gear and some ornate.  I have done (with my Guild) all of the alternate access PoP quests just for the charm stats and AA's.     </p>

<p>We are pretty much at a standstill in terms of character progerssion at this point, as there are no upgrades attainable by people with our playstyle that will allow us to play in GoD or the higher end OoW zones where we can get real gear upgrades.</p>

<p>We havnt spent a lot of time in OoW zones like bloodfields and causeway yet.  It remains to be seen if there are adequate drops in those zones to allow us to bridge the gap.</p>

<p>Thats fine if you are a casual guild, but realize if you are a raiding guild and like to do things with 40+ people WoW will not have content for you. </p>

<p>Really for larger raiding type guilds in a non PvP environment, eq is still pretty much it.</p>

<p>That is the most asinine and baseless comment I've read in a while. And I read a lot of baseless comments.</p>

<p>Midgen--</p>

<p>As a fellow non-raider (I take the game quite seriously when I can play, thanks) and in similar gear, I'm finding OoW to be a veritable candyland of upgrades. SOE is either waiting to get out the nerf bat or has decided to bridge the gap between what non-raiders have and what they need in the higher end with a vengeance.</p>

<p>Magicians have been complaining for a long time about a lack of Summoned creatures in EQ. Druids and Necros have traditionally had much better luck in finding Animals and Undead creatures to play with. Unfortunately, instead of appeasing the mages with more summoned content, it appears that they decided to hurt everyone and really scale back the number of "special" creatures in the game.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by SP at October  5, 2004 12:20 PM</strong></p>
<p>As far as "special" creatures goes... it requires you to hit a command people rarely think about when making mobs. If you'd remember back to GoD and PoP, there were several undead and animal mobs that were not flagged as such. Several weeks later, those flags became viable.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how many animal looking creatures are in Omens, but if any of them might be animals, it could change any patch now for the better...</p>

<p>I believe that EQ is unfixable. To me, there seriously is nothing left for them to do to improve the game from what it was, unless they want to revert expansions or something. I think that most people just aren't happy with what EQ now is anymore. It has evolved into something that most people don't want, and what that is isn't really something that easy to explain.</p>

<p>But, I can tell you what I think people want. People want a simple interface again, a game where you can play for hours with friends and not have to worry about drops, a game where the items aren't 200hp each with 20 wis and 20 to every other stat, a game where you can login for an hour and log out, and feel like to accomplished something, a game with some kind of actual lore, and follows a story line, a game with simple outdoor, nature, and even cave (or dungeon) environments. Does OoW do this?</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Dade at October 30, 2004 02:51 PM</strong></p>
<p>Merwenn, you made one mistake, that is what YOU want.  If you think you have a finger on the pulse of EQ players and their needs more than SOE you're sorely mistaken.  Many of you imply that SOE just exists in a vacumm.  They don't.  They read these same boards, ask us questions, and see EQ being played from perspectives none of us players could ever hope to.  I think they know better what people are asking for that you do.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Naxy at November 18, 2004 04:30 PM</strong></p>
<p>Merwenn, that is exactly what I am looking for as well. As a cleric in a raid guild there is nothing and then nothing to do if you don't have 2 hours or so, if the guild isn't raiding. And no, I am not gonna spend hours and hours to tradeskill only to make stuff that is of no use to me. /sigh</p>

<p>ok i have been read the posts and i see only 2 sides the ppl who play in raiding guilds and the ppl who just want to group and have fun im not saying that raiding isnt fun cuz it must be ppl still do it.  i have been playing since the begging of 2001 and i have 2 accounts and 3 lvl 65+ chars they are all solo capable classes IE mage necro and bst the fact that everyone is talking about loot and raids is fine but what about ppl like me i like to log on for an hour and log off.  lfg is a long and boring part of the game so i broke down and built myself another comp so i can just log on and play but with all the new expanstions this is getting harder and harder due to the amount of hps and damage these mobs due.  back in the day mages and necros were useless in groups so we made our living solo now we cant im not saying i dont like to group cuz i do and ill let anyone join me while im on but now it seems we cant do anything by ourselves any more it either takes a high lvl group or a raiding guild to accomplish anything any more. just my thought and i dont plan on leaving eq i love the feel of it and this is after playing UO trying CoH and soon to try WoW.</p>
