   <font class="ArticleText"><BIG>For an Extra $30 a Month, Your Level 12 Beastlord Can Become a Legend</BIG><p>We all thought Luclin would be the last big dose of EverQuest news for a few months.<p>Boy, were we wrong.<p>Almost out of the blue comes <a href="http://legends.everquest.station.sony.com/showcase/home.jsp">EverQuest Legends</a>, which basically lets you move to a new kind of server. This server has more GMs, more events, more items, and fewer people. It also gives you all kinds of Web-based character services, such as your own home page, the ability to track your items, an ultra cool mapping feature, and more.<p>The price is $40 a month--yes, four times the standard monthly fee.<p>Never has a Verant announcement resulted in so many e-mails and AIM windows opening at once. Friends and readers alike have inundated me with information and opinions on this sure-to-be controversial service.<p>I'm going to review the facts a bit more before I launch into a huge diatribe on the subject. Truth be told, I don't know what to think quite yet. Take the guided tour via the link above, and read some of <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000480.html">Absor's comments</a> on the already substantial reader feedback. Message boards are already <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessage?topicID=2702.topic">on fire</a> over it, and will continue to be so. Expect an editorial on the whole Legends thing in a couple days.<p>Real quickly though... do I think Verant is crazy for doing this? In a way. But it's also going to make them a ridiculous amount of money, and more people than you ever imagined will move to a Legends server.<p><BIG>Ester the Less-ter?</BIG><p>After being buried under inches of dust for months now, a new <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000089.html">post</a> surfaced today on the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&amp;forum=Quality+Assurance+-+Testing&amp;number=2&amp;DaysPrune=20&amp;LastLogin=">Quality Assurance - Testing</a> forum. What's that? You didn't <I>know</I> there was a Q &amp; A forum? Well, it has been ages since it was used. What's more, instead of good ol' Ester the Tester making the post, it was a new face named Trueno:<p><B>Greetings Citizens of Norrath ! I'd like to welcome you all once again to this board. Going forward this board will be used more frequently to communicate known bugs, their status, and even to collect information regarding bugs. I look forward to hearing from you all.<p>Regards,<p>Trueno Trollslayer<br>QA Manager</B><p>Not sure who the new guy is, but his last name is &quot;Trollslayer,&quot; so he can't be all bad. Trolls suck. Anyway, looks like we have another forum to keep an eye on.<p><BIG>That Which Verant Hath Joined Together Is Now Put Asunder</BIG><p>When Luclin was released--wow, nearly two months ago!--the formerly separate live patch program and the Test server patch program were joined into one blissful little entity. Well, it seems this mixed marriage was an uneasy one, as Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000478.html">announced</a> that divorce papers have been filed:<p><B>We are going to split the Test patcher and the Live patcher back into two separate programs.<p>This means that in order to access the Test Server you will need to run TestEverQuest.exe, which you will find in your EverQuest directory. To play on the Live Servers just start EverQuest as you always have.<p>There are a few advantages to separating the two patchers. Splitting them up makes it a little easier, as a player, to be sure that you are headed to the right server when you double click the icon. It's also a little more intuitive for those that want to run the game in two directories.<p>Using two directories for EverQuest does use up a lot of hard drive space. However, for those with enough space that play regularly on both Test and on Live servers, this is a safer and faster way to work. Using the same directory means that each time you change servers (Live to Test or Test to Live) you will have to patch. The data on the Test Server is very rarely the same as that on Live servers.<p>And for us internally it makes it easier to test new patchers. It gives us one more step for testing. Now we can push a patcher to the Test Server and try it out there after internal testing and before it goes to the Live servers.<p>In any case, we've decided to move back to the old way. Starting on Monday, February 5th, 2002 you will need to run TestEverQuest.exe to patch and play on the Test server, and Everquest.exe to patch and play on the Live servers.</B><p>That's all very well and good, except that February 5th is a Tuesday. How do I know? Because my birthday is the 6th! Verant better get me something nice...<p><BIG>UPGRADE! UPGRADE NOW!!!</BIG><p>As if you haven't spent enough money on your PC to play Luclin, nVidia has just <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2002/01/31/technology/column_gaming/">announced</a> their next next-generation chip: the GeForce 4. Seeing as how Luclin isn't even taking advantage of most of what the GeForce 3 has to offer, only the hardcore need rush out to upgrade when the cards actually hit the market. Spend your money on a processor or memory upgrade instead.<p>Unless you want to buy me one for my birthday, of course!<p><BIG>More Non-Fisticuffs from FanFaire</BIG><p>Casters Realm continues with their FanFaire coverage by providing transcripts to the panel discussion on <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4074">tradeskills</a> and <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4073">the future of EverQuest</a>.<p>Honestly, I've never been a tradeskills kind of guy--to me they're a necessary evil. But a lot of people enjoy them immensely, despite the long hours of tedious work collecting obscure components. One tidbit in particular caught my eye in this discussion, though, when someone asked about enchanted items:<p><B>The problem with making a good system of enchantment is that you don't want to cross-class too much so that Warriors are using awesome Wizard spells.&nbsp; But Lawrence Poe and I worked out a pretty good system for getting enchantments into the game for enchanters, so we are still playing with the idea.</B><p>Before anyone goes and gets their hopes up, please remember that enchanting items was something listed as an original feature of EverQuest, but it got lost in beta. At least the fact that two of EQ's designers are actively working on this issue should give us guarded optimism that we'll see it someday.<p>The EverQuest Future panel was conducted by Abashi himself. This one had a lot of juicy details, so go read it.<p>Some favorite highlights:<p><B>They [Droga and Nurga revamps] are done.&nbsp; But we are running those in internal testing.&nbsp; We are really sick of putting out broken or incomplete content due to pushing stuff out so fast. So we are trying to minimize these problems and hence Droga/Nurga are really getting a work over in testing.&nbsp; They will be out soon though.</B><p>Wow, that comment about broken/incomplete content is a biggie. Does he mean that there has been a lessening of the &quot;deliver on time or else&quot; pressure on the team? Or does he just mean that revamps don't fall under the same constraints as a full expansion? In any case, we at Mobhunter will be holding Abashi to his word on this one. If the Nurga/Droga thing sucks, we'll be linking to this page early and often.<p><B>When we populated PoM we did it all in a very very fast fashion.&nbsp; We are definitely going to go and put that zone back together.&nbsp; It was the last on the list when we did Velious and only just made it in as it was.&nbsp; It's a really nice zone visually though and we will shortly be going back and populating it in a more thorough fashion... Basically Bristlebane's a bastard.&nbsp; No, seriosuly,&nbsp; we'll be looking at PoM when we get back.</B><p>If you're a monk from Triton, this news will probably make you happy.<p><B>Well what was happening before was we were sending out the whole image to the Umbra client and it tries to split half the work between the GPU and CPU.&nbsp; Umbra works now.&nbsp; It had problems when we first used it and we have fixed that now.&nbsp; There are still some old zones which are not compatible with umbra though, and in the next build of the engine Umbra will be automatically disabled.&nbsp; But with the new dll on test there shouldn't be anything more than 4 - 5% slowdown in any zone from using Umbra.</B><p>Umbra works now on Test because it only causes a 4-5% slowdown? Uh, wasn't Umbra supposed to make the game <I>faster?</I> If the goal all along was for Umbra to turn our frame rates to crap, then don't touch it; Umbra is Working As Intended (TM).<p><B>The epics have been outclassed now.&nbsp; We had to put in better weapons to keep the higher end game compelling.&nbsp; For the epic weapons we do have plans for being able to use them in upgraded epic quests, but they are just discussions at the moment.</B><p>In other words, don't hold your breath for these quests to be implemented.<p><B>The basic problem with CotH is that you can get a mage and a corpse or two and boom move an unlimited number of people through a zone by-passing content which we want people to have to do.<p>In all honesty it was a bad spell that we probably shouldn't have put in.&nbsp; Just because it trivializes so much content.&nbsp; If you had seen some of the areas where dungeons are totally based on a CoH train now, or where people duel and drag corpses and CoH and that really isn't the way we'd like to see it done.&nbsp; The real good thing about the spell is obviously it can get friends who show up late to the area so they can play.&nbsp; So one thing I would like to look into, and I am happy to hear suggestions, is to make it so that you can do that good side without moving entire guilds.&nbsp; One obvious suggestion is adding a 15 minute recast to CoH.&nbsp; But it's all speculatory on any changes in that area at this time.</B><p>As if we haven't had enough <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000476.html">mage issues</a> lately, here we go again. Do I need to point you to the discussion thread on The Magician's Tower? <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessage?topicID=3636.topic">Fine</a>. You can probably guess a lot of the content. Phrases like &quot;death of the class&quot; are being batted around already.<p>Much as I enjoy giving casters a hard time, I am forced to agree--to a point. While Call of the Hero was never intended to be a class-defining spell, in many ways it has become one of the mage's key roles on a raid. I refuse to give in to the &quot;it's the only reason we're useful&quot; argument, though--if you're thinking of springing that one on me, go elsewhere.<p>A 15-minute timer on the spell does seem quite excessive. If the idea behind the change is to prevent an entire raid force from moving past certain content, then a 5-7 minute delay would work just as well, while letting stragglers join the raid party at a reasonable rate. This is assuming, of course, that such a change would only happen in zones that CotH is already disabled--I'd hate to see the spell itself changed totally.<p>The key here, of course, is that Abashi was merely <B>speculating</B> about changing the spell. I have absolute confidence that, even as he was boarding the plane to head home after FanFaire, he thought to himself &quot;You know, I probably shouldn't have speculated aloud about changing Call of the Hero. If mages see that in print, I'll never hear the end of it.&quot; This introspection was no doubt followed by a long period of banging his head against the fold-down tray table.<p>Hang in there, mages. Writing your death sentence before the fact is usually a self-fulfilling prophecy. Don't let potential changes to a single spell define who you are as an EverQuest player.<p><BIG>Tuning the Ring--Again</BIG><p>When Steve Burke--EverQuest content guru--<a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=2037785539">discussed</a> changes to his Ring of Fire event, he asked for player feedback on ways to make the quest better. Well, one of my guildmates did so, and got the following reply back:<p><B>I will be making adjustments to the event sooner rather than later. The changes I plan to make are:<p>- Ramp up the difficulty of the waves sooner, reducing the boredom<br>- Place better quality treasure on 4th boss, perhaps making him more challenging<br>- Slowing the rate at which the mobs spawn between 4th and 5th waves a bit<br>- Allowiing 5th boss to drop two items</B><p>These changes would be brilliant. They'd make the Ring more interesting and challenging than it was initially, while still making the reaching of the fifth boss a worthy challenge. If these modifications go live, expect the improved risk vs. reward ratio to attract guilds to this event once again. And, after all, that was the goal in the first place.<p>Okay, enough EQ news. Go watch a SuperBowl pre-game show or something.</font>
