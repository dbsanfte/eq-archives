   <font class="ArticleText">Ever since a sexy wood elf turned me on to the <a href="http://www.tweak3d.net/">Tweak3D</a> site, I've been doing a lot of reading about system performance. While you Quake-obsessed folks out there probably had your systems nicely tuned and ready for Luclin, those of us who have been playing nothing much besides EverQuest for the past few years--sad as that may be--were caught off guard by the sudden demands of this expansion.<p>In an effort to turn your machine into a finely tuned gaming monster, here are a few more system enhancements you can try. Except for the first couple, these tips are intended for Windows 98SE/ME users. If you have Windows XP, take a look at <a href="http://www.tweak3d.net/tweak/winxp/">this page</a> for some tips of your own.<p><B>Use Texture Caching</B> - I should have added this one to my list yesterday, but it slipped through the cracks. The <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000430.html">patch</a> on December 13 introduced a new option called Texture Caching. Here's what it does:<p><B>In an effort to improve loading and zoning times, we've added the ability to cache textures to your hard drive. One of the things that your computer is doing when you load up the game or change zones is building textures and putting them into RAM on your computer. Each time you log in or zone the game has to create the textures you need and put them into RAM for use during gameplay.<p>This, obviously, takes a little time.<p>We have added an option that allows you to save that information to your hard drive rather than creating it each time you log in or zone.</B><p>The only downside is that you need a lot of free hard drive space--about 1.5 gigs, to be precise. But assuming you have that much space, the decrease in zoning time is well worth it. Add the line <B>TextureCache=TRUE</B> to your eqclient.ini file to activate this feature.<p><B>Defrag Your Hard Drive</B> - Again, something I should have listed yesterday. When data is written to your hard drive, Windows tries to keep files in continuous streams of data, but at the same time it tries to use up all the empty space it finds as it goes along. Thus, what happens over time is that files get broken up into segments all over the drive, causing the drive to take longer to access this data. Defragmentation re-sorts the files on your hard drive, putting files together and speeding up drive access. This is a good thing to do periodically even if you don't play EverQuest.<p>Windows has a defrag utility built in (click on the Tools tab in the drive's Properties), and software like Norton Utilities includes additional functionality that is well worth the investment. With a game that gets patched as much as EQ does, defragging regularly is a necessity.<p><B>Turn on DMA</B> - If your hard drive supports DMA mode (most current models do, but check your spec sheets to be sure), activating this feature can speed up your performance. Here's <a href="http://www.tweak3d.net/tweak/harddrive/">why</a>:<p><B>DMA is one of the biggest tweaks you can do for your Hard Drive and Memory subsystems, because it allows the computer to circumvent the CPU when loading data into memory from the hard drive. Before continuing with these tweaks, however, be forewarned that enabling DMA on a drive that doesn't support it is very dangerous, so unless you are SURE that DMA is supported, forego these tweaks. It should be pointed out that just about all 5400 and 7200-rpm hard drives, and even many lower speed drives, support DMA.</B><p>To see whether DMA is enabled on your hard drive, right-click on the My Computer icon and select Properties. Click the Device Manager tab, then click the + sign next to Disk Drives. Select your hard drive and click Properties. You will see a check box labeled DMA.<p>If DMA isn't enabled and you check the box to turn it on, Windows will give you a warning message--even if your system supports DMA. If you're sure you're in the clear, just ignore it and keep on going.<p><B>DMA Buffer Size</B> - After making the above change, you need to add yet another line to your system.ini file in the [386Enh]section: <B>DMABufferSize=64</B>. Here's <a href="http://www.tweak3d.net/tweak/quickspeed/2.shtml">why</a>:<p><B>This setting will tell the computer to reserve a buffer in system memory for DMA. If you are using any DMA enabled pieces of hardware on your system at all, it is advisable that you set this equal to 64 Kb (the line would read DMABufferSize=64). This setting goes under the [386Enh] header.</B><p>Basically, DMA mode reduces the work your CPU has to do when talking to the hard drive. Since your processor is quite busy with the graphics end of Luclin, I'm sure it will thank you for lightening its load.<p><B>Set Your AGP Mode Properly</B> - Most of today's video cards operate in AGP 4x mode, while those of a year or two ago often run in 2x mode. Make sure your system is set up to take advantage of the highest AGP setting you can muster.<p>Once you determine the best mode your motherboard and graphics card support, enter your system's BIOS and find the setting for AGP mode, set it properly, and save the changes.<p>You would think this would be enough to make your system happy, but your video driver may have its own ideas. It turns out that your video card driver might just be playing it safe and putting your card back into 1x mode. This is especially likely in the case of VIA motherboard chipsets and GeForce cards.<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.geforcefaq.com/faq.html#index">GeForce FAQ</a> and <a href="http://www.tweak3d.net/tweak/geforce/">Tweak3D guide</a> for help with this and many other issues concerning TNT/GeForce cards.<p><B>AGP Aperture Revisited</B> - As <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=241276766">previously stated</a>, this BIOS option is supposed to be set at 1/4 to 1/2 of your system memory. For anyone with 512 megs of RAM or more, I officially recommend bumping this setting up to 256. I've been running with this setting for a couple days now and have had nothing but positive results.<p><B>Optimize Your Broadband Connection</B> - Just because you have a cable modem or ADSL, don't assume that you're getting the best performance possible. For instance, my sexy wood elf friend helped me to discover that the network card in my PC was actually in half-duplex mode rather than full-duplex mode. While this was never a problem in the game before, it could be a significant issue considering the increased amount of data that Luclin seems to be transmitting. To find out what mode your card is in, you might have to run a diagnostic utility from your driver diskette like I did. Consult your card maker's Web site for details.<p>Not to be outdone, the folks at Tweak3D also have some <a href="http://www.tweak3d.net/tweak/cable/">broadband optimizations</a> for you. While these are less likely to produce night-and-day differences than some system settings, they are worthy of undertaking nonetheless. What's nice is that these tweaks often come in neat little packages that can easily be patched into your Registry without you having to muck around in there yourself. If, like me, you've had tons of inexplicable packet loss and linkdeath since Luclin came out, these tweaks might offer some relief.<p><BIG>My Results</BIG><p>Two nights ago, I made the DMA changes above, made sure Windows was using AGP 4x mode, and changed my AGP aperture from 128 to 256. I have no idea which of these changes had the biggest impact, but suddenly my loading time and zoning times have literally been cut by half or more. That annoying screen before the character menu--the one with all the cute little jokes as it shows your loading progrees--is only up for about a minute now. Zoning is as good or better than it was pre-Luclin. In the Old World, zoning takes seconds, and the only really bad zones are Luclin cities that are bogged down by a jillion NPC textures.<p>So, am I happy with Luclin yet? Generally, yes. However, I don't think it's right that so much of the onus for getting the game to function properly was placed upon the user. People with systems that meet or exceed the recommended specs should have gotten great performance out of the box--period. The fact that it has taken a dozen patches and a dozen system tweaks to finally be happy with the game is inexcusable.<p>Many people have asked why Verant decided to make such a technological leap with Luclin. After all, players would have been happy with just another content expansion. Then Verant could have saved the fancy graphics for EverQuest 2, or whatever it's going to be called. My latest paranoid suspicion? That <I>Shadows of Luclin is nothing more than the beta test for Star Wars Galaxies.</I> Think about that one for a while, conspiracy buffs.<p>Mobhunter isn't done with you in 2001 just yet. Look for a blockbuster of an article to be posted before the MH staff slips into a drunken stupor.<br></font>
