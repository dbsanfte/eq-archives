   <font class="ArticleText">I realize it's been awhile and there has in fact been stuff to talk about but I've been extremely busy lately and unable to find the time to write anything up. I'll try to get to everything of recent note this time around as the release date of the next expansion closes in..<p>First off, there's a tiny <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=60580" target="_new">Q&amp;A</a> with two of the designers working on the Gates expansion. While there isn't necessarily a lot of real new information, it's still more interesting to me than the usual Q&amp;As you see on the big sites that are basically ads and it reveals that for the most part, the people behind the expansions are not robots, atleast completely. By the way, doesn't Alan look pissed in that picture? I'm afraid to ridicule his angry box kicking guy...<p>In similar news, on the 3rd of this month there was a GoD chat. You can find the transcript <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=60634" target="_new">here.</a> I'm going to go through and point out the key things, and comment a bit, because that's my job here.<p><strong>There will be a small amount of flags earned through the storyline but nothing as in depth as Planes of Power. The flags are directly related to the storyline but are a lot more forgiving than they were in the Planes of Power.</strong><p>Most players will be atleast somewhat happy to hear this although I suspect a lot hate flags entirely, both the casual people who were locked out of relatively basic zones for awhile, and the higher level people who are forced to go back to those zones repeatedly. I would be curious to know how they are more forgiving than planes of power.<p><strong>Another segment of the melee system is going to be going live with the next patch...There's further additions to the melee system planned for the near future.</strong><p>I hate to take the cliche position here but it's just a tiny bit absurd the way things have gone down with the melee changes. It's almost been a year since they originally talked about them, or more accurately put them on their 'Upcoming updates' page. They were supposed to be done in mid December but all we got was endurance and warriors got one skill. While I can appreaciate the fact that openings were scrapped, it just seems like development of it ceased entirely to get the new expansion out the door.<p><strong>Everyone will gain access to some of the new features, like Leadership Abilities and the Tribute system. The content is geared for 55+ characters, with quite a bit of it aimed at level 65.</strong><p>While I know some of you dislike the thought of a content being geared for high level people but I don't believe it is something you can even debate at this point and it's not a question of casual versus hardcore people, since a lot of the level 65 people are casual players, in fact the <a
href="http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=29397.topic"
target="_new">majority</a> of players are level 65, and at this point it makes sense to provide them with a variety of content since it's not as if a level 40 person has too few places at this point to hunt.<p><strong>We have provided functionality to add and remove group or raid members after the instance zone has started up to a point.</strong><p>While obviously an improvement over the wayy LDON was, it still bugs me that they put in barriers like this. One of the worst parts of LDON was having to turn people away when you went to raid, and I personally dislike any barrier that prevents players being able to play together or making things overly annoying. The net effect of not letting people join in after a certain point is the same, if a guild starts a raid at 7 PM EST, and someone who works gets home at 9 PM EST, it'll be the same thing, sorry but the game will not allow you to join your friends, go solo if you're a class that can manage that.<p><strong>You can gain xp at a much faster rate nowadays than you could when PoP was released. The increased group bonus, higher zone mods and availability of high level NPCs all mean you can gain AA's much faster now. The higher costs reflect that.</strong><p>One of the major concerns about the upcoming expansion is the extreme cost of the AA abilities. <a href="http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=29416.topic" target="_new">Across</a> a <a href="http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5505" target="_new">wide</a> <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=44008.topic" target="_new">variety</a> of boards, the rumor has been and it's pretty much confirmed at this point that while any given class might only get 6-8 skills, to get them all will amount to hundreds of AA points. It's very true that experience comes much faster now than it did. I came into the planes of power with perhaps 60 AA points, which covered the things I really needed as a warrior. I gained around 200 points through the planes and lost dungeon expansion, and I had only recently felt that feeling of being <em>done</em> with what I needed. <p>Despite the fact they come faster, I'm still not a fan of the way in which they are doing it, and not because I feel that overall things cost too much, it's more a matter of the way the players perceive things. An example is the skill Ambidexterity which costs 9 points. I actually never got this skill, and one of the reasons was the outright point cost of it. Saving up 9 or more points, even if there is almost nothing else you care to get, is just a pain and it can kill your drive to do so. Now if the same skill had been split into 3 levels, at 3 points each, I would have probably cruised right through it, as it's just something in your head. I know in my case, I would much rather have 10 levels at 4 points each, than 5 levels that end up equalling 40 total points, with the net effect for my character being the same.<p>Also, while I know that very high level people can get AA points extremely fast if they choose to, what about the average casual playing level 65. I guess they already are <em>behind</em> as it goes with existing AA points and that trend will likely continue into the next expansions.<p><em>Will GoD instanced zones be timed?</em><p><strong>For all intense and purposes, no.</strong><p>I seriously wonder why theres the entire first half of that sentance there.<p><strong>Every ten minutes favor points will be deducted from your favor pool. Different tribute buffs require different favor costs. Your buffs will last as long as you have favor points to pay for them.</strong><p>This in reference to the Tribute system, which you can find a bit more information about <a href="http://eq.stratics.com/content/features/god/tribute.php" target="_new">here</a>. It seems like an interesting way to get items and money out of the games economy.<p>Lastly in case you didn't get the memo, it's time to upgrade to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=141d5f9e-07c1-462a-baef-5eab5c851cf5&amp;DisplayLang=en" target="_new">DirectX 9</a>! You can read a bit about things <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/engine_upgrade_notice.jsp" target="_new">here</a> on Sonys site. Basically it's in preparation for the improved graphics engine they say in a month or two. Even though I doubt I will be playing much if at all then, it will still be interesting to see how they manage it all. The reason I say that is the engine is only part of the equation and for things to actually look better, they would at the very least, require higher resolution textures for things, if not completely redone zones. One time in the past they did update the textures in the game, but that was shipped out on the Luclin CDs. I am very afraid for the dialup users out there!<p><big>I thought you said T&amp;A not Q&amp;A!</big><p>Moving on a tad to EverQuest 2, theres <a href="http://eq2vault.ign.com/?dir=features/qanda&amp;content=asksoe14" target="_new">this</a> Q&amp;A with Moorgard. Probably the most interesting bit is that now any race can be any class. People may have issues with that, but he makes the point well in that it being open in that way allows you to create your own character.<p>As I mentioned around a month ago, I sent off questions to a Sony marketing guy, who was then supposed to send them to Moorgard, who would send answers to the marketing guy, and who would then send them to me. I spent some time coming up with questions that I felt were more involved than what you might typically find, to try and get specifics to questions I had. Prior to any of this I had talked to Moorgard and he gave me some indicator of things I shouldn't say. For example, I could not ask a question that made any other Sony product look bad, or even state that something was less than a smash hit.<p>After going over my questions I was sure they were suitable for corporate consumption and I still felt like I was asking decent questions so I sent them off to some marketing guy. Minutes later Moorgard tells me that the aforementioned marketing guy asked him why I was so hostile which surprised me, but he told me that he would answer the questions. Obviously at this point it's clear he isn't, or can't, so I'm going to put up my questions and then I'm going to give my own answers that I'm just going to make up. Please note that at this point the ANSWERS will be hostile, but keep in mind, that I'm not being negative just for no reason, Ok, you got me, I am.<p><b><em>Prior to it's release, many people who played EverQuest hoped or were under the impression that SWG would effectively be EverQuest in space, having the same basic gameplay, in a radically different setting. Some players, including myself were  dissappointed when it became clear that was not the case. <p>A lot of players, again, myself included, are afraid that EverQuest 2 will in essence be Star Wars Galaxies in Norrath. The reasons for that belief are a variety of things said about the nature of the game and the fact that if EQ2 is simply more and prettier EQ, what would be the point of having both, they would end up competing with each other.<p>I personally have not played Star Wars Galaxies, and I really have no idea if you have either, so to get to the actual question, explain the philosphy behind EverQuest 2, what it inherits from EQ, and what seperates it also.</em></b><p><strong>Coray:</strong> Get it right, Star Wars Galaxies was a complete and utter dissappointment, but as far as computer games and the Star Wars License goes, it pretty much fits right in with all the other horrific attempts at mass market geek success, with one notable <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/products/swkotor/" target="_new">exception</a>. The philosphy behind EQ2 is that graphics can replace fun. If your character has fancy shadows, you probably won't notice that the game isn't much fun, now will you? And that oddly enough is also what it takes from EverQuest, it isn't much fun!<p><b><em>An issue I've brought up with EverQuest in the past is the lack of quality Quests. A large reason is probably not for lack of wanting them, or for trying but more because the game itself has no actual quest system to keep track of things, and a common tactic designers use is obscurity to slow players down.<p>In a number of other games, current and future, they feature full quest systems or journals, which give details and allow quests to have significant rewards because they can only be done a single time. <p>The question therefore is, what, if any, quest system does EverQuest 2 have, and could you explain and possibly run through a real example quest to give me an idea of how it might work.</em></b><p><strong>Coray: </strong>Quests? Who said anything about quests?<p><b><em>An issue I have yet to bring up about EverQuest in an article is the development and current nature of the high end content of the game. <p>I would like to know the general approach the team is taking in regards to this area. About the sole specific information I can find is that there is an enforced limit of 24 people.<p>As you might know, one of the sole ways that EverQuest high end content has scaled in supposed difficulty, is by increasing mob damage output, which logically forces players to have larger forces comprised of a high percentage of a single class, clerics.<p>How does the team intend to have encounters which scale in difficulty, but do not necessarily feed into a min/max requirement where some classes might be excluded? For example, if you're limited to 24 people, does every class offer something compelling enough to warrant them getting a spot, or are raids so general that any 24 people SHOULD be able to win if they use good tactics?</em></b><p><strong>Coray: </strong>The enforced limit is there because we have been able to run approximately 24 characters in the same square mile, on NECs <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/question54.htm" target="_new">Earth Simulator</a> computer, so we set that as the limit. As far as class types, while initially only a quarter of your raid will have to be clerics, before too long every member of the raid will be a cleric and anyone who isn't a cleric will be unable to contribute anything to the raid, and thus be excluded entirely.<p><b><em>How are mobs balanced versus players? To clarify this, in EverQuest, a level 30 NPC, is significantly stronger than a level 30 player, and would kill that player barring some tactic such as kiting. The scale is such that for many people it is impossible to solo anything which would give experience. I believe this was done originally to encourage or force grouping and it works, but is not the ideal solution.<p>I'm curious if ALL classes will be able to solo effectively for experience, but at the same time encouraging grouping via experience bonuses?</em></b><p><strong>Coray: </strong>No, not all classes will be able to solo effectively, or really I should say NO ONE will be able to solo effectively.<p><b><em>As an extension to the last question, a major problem originally with EverQuest that has gotten better over time, was downtime. I still remember sitting in Oasis, where I would kill one crocodile, and then sit and read the Lord of the Rings for 10 minutes while I healed. <p>I recently began playing Dark Age of Camelot a bit, and I was surprised to find that not only could I solo things at or even now above my own level, but even as a pure melee character, I would heal extremely fast and be ready to fight again very quickly. The same thing applies to mana (power) in that game.<p>Is there going to be significant downtime for solo or grouped characters and what, in the broader sense is the view on this issue?</em></b><p><strong>Coray: </strong>In EverQuest 2, we really wanted to raise the bar on realism, and as such, after combat, members of your group are likely suffering from severe wounds, including but not limited to lacerations, both minor and severe, compound fractures with textures and bump mapping that have to be seen to be believed, and erectile dysfunction. These wounds take time to heal, and no fancy magic or <em>sitting down</em> is really going to help you <em>get it up</em> or walk around on your leg when your femur is sticking out of it at a funny angle. After 4-8 weeks of laying on the ground nearly unconscious (4-8 weeks of continuous online time I should say), theres a good chance you will have regained the strength to begin to crawl in search of help. That is all assuming your wounds didn't become infected and kill your character outright, but that only happens half of the time.<p>Thanks to Coray for answering the questions I sent!<p><big>Wow I'm surprised!</big><p>In other news, there was a recent WoW developers <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/wow/fansitechat-040205.shtml" target="_new">chat</a>, and it doesn't really reveal much about the gameplay which is afterall what matters most. Another interesting thing just to show I'm fair here in being negative is <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/WoW_General_Board/b19789/63916661/?34" target="_new">this post</a>, which says that Blizzard received 400,000 applications for the beta test. For some reason that seems to be a lot lower than I would have expected but I guess it illustrates really how there really are a lot of people who play games who don't read sites or keep up with things.<p><big>Goodbye and Goodluck</big><p>You knew it was coming, some of you prayed for it to come faster and I hate to dissappoint.  While I still periodically play EverQuest, it is a fact that I don't have much interest in the game itself, it's the people I have met in the game that brings me back if only for a few hours a week.<p>And despite what you think, my interest in the game itself has little effect on what I write here.  Anyone who knows me, knows the way I am, and I've been railing the game for years all while playing it and still enjoying it.  At some point I stopped enjoying it and it's time to move on, that isn't really an indicator of the game itself despite my perceived negativity or sarcasm.  <p>I want to wish all the Mobhunter readers well, continue to play the game and have fun, and good luck.</font>
