<h1 class="article_title">Spring 2006 Summit and Fan Faire Final Report</h1>
<p>by Loral on April 11, 2006</p>

<p>We return from the towers of the south, leatherbound notebooks laden with rumors and gossip. Today we summarize the knowledge captured at the April 2006 Everquest Community Summit and Fan Faire.</p>

<h2>The Twelfth Expansion</h2>

<p>During the first Everquest Summit panel, SOE revealed some details on the yet-unnamed twelfth Everquest expansion.  This expansion will focus on all levels from level 1 to the max level, likely level 75 - a level cap increase over the current level 70. The expansion will attempt to bring new players to the game by offering entire new lines of content and progression from the very first levels all the way through to the end.</p>

<p>The twelfth expansion will include quests and missions for all levels and will mostly focus on large zones over the smaller instanced missions of expansions like Dragons of Norrath and Depths of Darkhollow. With this focus on larger un-instanced zones, there will be more base content than the last few expansions but with no lack of quests. The intent with this focus is to get more players playing together in the same area rather than separating players out into groups of six and isolating them from other groups.</p>

<p>This expansion will include a full copy of the base Everquest game so with this single purchase alone, a player can begin the game at level one and progress all the way to level 75. The intent of the progression in this new expansion is to even allow this player a chance to reach the highest power and most challenging content of high-end raids. All of this resides in a single package.</p>

<p>The new expansion will also include a new starting city, although no details were available.</p>

<p>This expansion will also include new high-end raid content at and above the current high-end raid zones of Deathknell and Demiplane of Blood. Players of all levels will likely have new hunting areas available to them, regardless of their level.</p>

<p>As mentioned, the new expansion will likely increase the level cap to level 75. This will give high-end players a reason to hunt regularly for experience and will also increase the base power level of all high-end players above current level 70 limits. Content once inaccessible except by those in raid gear will become easier as players increase their base power by leveling to 75.</p>

<p>The expansion will also likely include new sets of Alternate Advancement points to further increase a high-level players power. Because of the abundance of high experience rewarding zones and the ease at which AAs can be earned at higher levels, the costs for these new abilities will likely be higher than previous expansions. One can remember the backlash against the high cost of AAs in Gate of Discord, but Norrath was a different place back then and with AAs coming at nearly one every fifteen minutes in instanced hunting zones like the Nest and the Hive, players will have little lack of places to earn them.</p>

<h2>The Progression Server</h2>

<p>For the past few months and even years, some players have asked SOE to return them to the older world of Everquest, a world without the Plane of Knowledge and without instances, a world where the economy wasn't flooded with powerful items for low costs. SOE answered this request with a new upcoming "Progression" server.</p>

<p>This server will begin with all expansions disabled. Only the base game will be active, although any changes to the base game such as zone revamps and class changes will stay in place thus making this a "progression" server and not a "classic" server. As groups of players activate certain triggers, such as killing boss mobs in the old world, each expansion will become unlocked. For example, supposing that Nagafen and Vox are the trigger mobs for opening up Kunark, when groups of players kill these two dragons, Kunark will be unlocked.  When they kill Venril Sather and Trakanon, Velious may become unlocked.</p>

<p>SOE hopes that this server will give players a new starting ground on even territory. No character transfers will be allowed. Players will earn the low-end items earned seven years ago and be forced to defeat encounters with much lower power than currently available on normal Everquest servers with all eleven current expansions.</p>

<p>It is not yet known whether this server will be popular or not. Even the developers within SOE differ as to how this new server should operate. Will players play in a game with limited transportation and long corpse recoveries? Will veteran players ignore their high-powered characters on normal servers for lower powered characters who fight for days to earn lower powered rewards? Only time will tell.</p>

<h2>The Death Penalty</h2>

<p>Currently, players who die leave behind corpses wearing all of the character's gear. Resurrections and corpse recovery vendors in the Guild Lobby can help players recover their equipment, but newer players who do not understand these systems or have access to clerics able to resurrect have a harder time with corpse recovery than high end raiders who simply wait for a resurrection or spend a very small percentage of their money for a corpse summon.</p>

<p>SOE plans to look further into this system and possibly develop a new way to handle death in Everquest. Possible changes include optional respawning with full equipment but leaving behind a naked corpse that must still be resurrected for experience, or waiting on a respawn to let a group or raid member resurrect a player without forcing a zone. Details of a new death system are still unknown but expect more information soon.</p>

<h2>Downtime</h2>

<p>In relation to other current MMOs, Everquest has a large problem with player downtime. Characters who run out of mana or endurance at all levels of the game often have to sit for long periods of time to recuperate. Current games like Everquest 2 and World of Warcraft include a "combat state" system that understands when a player is in or out of combat.</p>

<p>SOE plans to build such a "combat state" system in Everquest. With this system in place, the game could see when a player has left combat and increase that character's regeneration of hitpoints, mana, and endurance to reduce the downtime a player faces when hunting at all levels of play.</p>

<h2>Other Topics</h2>

<p>SOE revealed more news of note and items of interest throughout the four day event. </p>

<p>With Rytan's departure as the spell guru, Prathun, the SOE designer known for designing high-end raid content, will take over spell development.  Oshran, the designer behind Arcstone and the 70 spell missions in Depths of Darkhollow, will focus on new alternate advancement abilities as Rashere focuses on the overall design of Everquest.</p>

<p>Lead programmer Jamey Ryan is working on a dynamic reward system that will help solve the problem of players focusing on only the most rewarding content for experience or shards. As players focus their attention on one particular piece of content, the rewards will lower while the rewards on unused content will increase. This will help push players to try a variety of content rather than focus on only the most rewarding content for the lowest effort.</p>

<p>SOE revealed a new more traditional revamp to Nektulos Forest. Many complained that the existing revamp of Nektulos was too rigid in design, looking more like a movie prop than a forest. The new Nektulos follows the philosophy that a zone revamp should look much like the original. It includes real trees and the same general layout as the original Nektulos zone.</p>

<p>SOE sees the introduction of destructible objects, traps, and auras as the beginning of a more dynamic and interactive world in Everquest. Like the features released in previous expansions, expect to see these features used to create more dynamic and interactive environments, quests, and storylines.</p>

<p>The performance problems found in Elddar forest are due to strange effects of trees. SOE plans to look into these problems and perhaps fix them with a programming change.</p>

<p>Spell Research will likely be further improved to include spells from older expansions such as LDON and Omens of War.</p>

<p>The EQ Players website will likely include many more features. These features include guild roster lists in XML, a better system for guild websites and guild websites for EQ Live, and a new skinnable character page. Other more ambitious efforts were described as well but are likely to come out later as these features require in-game development and further discussions between the EQ Players developers and the EQ Live team.</p>

<p>Throughout the long weekend I sat with many of Everquest's current designers and programmers. They stayed up late and talked openly with their fans about all aspects of the game from large topics such as the new upcoming expansion to small ones such as spell balance between druids and wizards. Once again it was clear how much the SOE development team cares about their game. The Everquest development team continues to make bold and sometimes dangerous moves as it evolves over the years. The mission system, instancing, monster missions, spirit shrouds, the upcoming Progression server, and a new expansion built for players of all levels, all show how far the design team is willing to go to keep this venerable game fresh in the minds of both new and old players.</p>

<p>We have many new adventures ahead of us.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see how one expansion will allow people to go from 1-75 in just the new expansion zones. If by "base" you mean original EQ (+ PoK I guess) there will need to be an awful lot of items dropping to gear people up properly through their levels.  Itemization in the old world zones doesn't come close to offset the dps mobs hit for in later expansions.  If that's the case, it could be quite interesting and might even bring other players into the game.  If it's a situation where they expect people to twink out in  bazaar gear just to play their levels, I don't see many new people staying.</p>

<p>It is good they're shying away from instances. I mean, really, instances were brought in to alleviate the content blocking at the highest levels. i.e. When one guild, possibly with a time zone advantage, would kill or spoil the event so that others couldn't continue progression.  This type of design was never needed elsewhere and only made the game world barren.  </p>

<p>The progression server I think will do fine.  No, I don't see new people coming in to play. I also don't see a lot of veteran players quitting their high level toons to start over either.  There will certainly be a huge kick off. I'm reminded of the 250+ level 1 Frogloks I met in Gukta when Ykesa came out. Once the honeymoon is over, the sever will stablize though.</p>

<p>It's not a classic server, and in that regard, will eventually become just another server over time. However, it does give a purpose to playing. A game world that will truly evolve, even if you know the outcome.  I personally think there are more than enough people who would like to the chance to participate in this to make it function.<br />

<p>If they are following the example of other games, like WoW and EQ2, they will be adding rare drops that are very good, and a lot of missions that will award the necessary equipment to gear up people.</p>

<p>This equipment will also most likely be no drop, if they don’t want to automatically mess up the entire economy.</p>

<p>I also bet advancement will be mainly based around missioning instead of just pure kill xp.<br />

<p>If the new server includes the tutorial, I assume exit will be to the proper starting city?  That would be a big improvement over starting the game in POK.  We learned our basic class skills in our home cities and newbie areas with others of our class and race ... think N Ro, Everfrost, FOB and Quenos Hills. Running around POK doing little quests doesn't offer the same training and bonding with other players.</p>

<p>It also sounds like the boats won't return.  They had their problems but were an exciting part of the game and very beautiful to look at... especially the boat that docked in FV. The shouts of BOAT COMING were part of the character of play in E Fport.  </p>

<p>I also wonder if factions will once again be important ....  </p>

<p>I for one am excited about the progresion server and I will probly start all over with some of my friends that have moved on or whatnot we all miss the days sittin in turkey town playing. As for the downtime yes I would ineed like to see that revamped(mabey its just cause I am impatient). The new expansion I am not too too interested because atm I am too far behind to start again on my old toons just hope to start fresh on a fresh server</p>

<p>All though this sounds good on paper, and the intention behind it is a noble one, I'm cynical towards its implementation. Personally, I see this likely backfiring on SoE in an unexpected way. As it is now, players simply repeat missions such as the Creator, or the Thurgadin monster missions, and so on -- beyond these key missions, it's difficult to group. Introduce lower awards the more one does a mission, it runs the risk of introducting a new element to deciding on groups - multiple players having completed different sets of missions opting out of grouping together on the basis of not getting enough experience.</p>

<p>Further, there's a reason missions such as the Creator are so popular. The other ones are simply not worth the time and or risk involved. Having played through DoN's mission arcs, most of them frankly just aren't that enjoyable beyond the first run. They take upwards of three to four times longer to complete than a Creator mission yet offer only marginal increases in awards. Why sit through a 4 hour mission to receive 11 more crystals than a 15 minute creator run? Why risk a wipe in that four hours that completelty negates a crystal award.</p>

<p>Instead of punshing people for doing missions over and over, give incentives to do other missions. Having these missions give less of an award is a mistake - increase the risk vs reward on the unused missions. Frankly, even if this happened, some of these DoN/DoDH/PoR tasks are so poorly written and implemented I wouldn't do them for a 4x exp bonus mod.</p>

<p>It sounded like one of the benefits to a dynamic system is that player behaviors don't lie. If the rewards tune automatically, and people are continually avoiding the high reward mission, or are still running the low reward mission, its a pretty clear signal to the devs as to which missions really need to be tuned further.</p>

<p>Rashere noted that they technically follow this approach now, obviously though, they have to wait for a patch and then analyze the results, make another change, etc. Without the dynamic system though, it seems to me like people still find the little RvR niche and stick with it until the next round of changes get made. The dynamic reward system will help get people moving through additional events of similar difficulty, as opposed to simply running one theme all the time.</p>

<p>The difference being right now that new players that want to play DoN are fairly limited to something like Creator because everyone figured that's the easiest way to get crystals and won't do any other.  While I'm sure there are missions that are out of whack, there have to be at least SOME missions besides Creator that give decent reward for time and risk.</p>

<p>The best example I can think of is MMs.  It was very obvious to see which MM everyone had figured out they could get the most out of.  While there were other MMs where the experience was also good and the mission wasn't particularly hard, people flocked to the one MM where they got the most bang for their buck.  This is the mentality that I think they want to steer people away from, the "I've learned this and am going to grind the hell out of it and not be available to do ANYTHING else in game."</p>

<p>Personally, I still prefer the giving the extra exp to first timers of an event because it gives someone trying to get a group together some leveraging room and still allows those that want to grind the ability to grind.  But if what Naladini says is true, then maybe the dynamic way will work fine.  Remember, you don't have to do ALL the missions.  People will just have to find the five easiest instead of the one easiest.<br />

<p>
<p>Just keep in mind, I'm putting my own little spin and interpretation on some of those comments.</p>

<p>For the concept to be truely valuable, it more than likely needs to be applied in a situation where all of the missions are supposed to be equal in terms of time and reward. (LDoN and DoN are decent examples)</p>

<p>MM's aren't really perfect in this regard, in that they're not all supposed to take the same amount of time to complete. The rewards were tuned based on how long they were actually taking to complete. </p>

<p>If you have an uneven time duration for the missions, it will skew the numbers considerably if you're talking dynamic awards, because some people will gravitate towards shorter missions solely because they don't take as long to complete.<br />
</p>
</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: <a href="mailto&#58;wolfkinder001&#64;sbcglobal&#46;net">Wolfkinder</a> on April 14, 2006 03:13 PM</strong></p>
<p>
<p>/agree</p>

<p>My comment on MMs was solely the fact that, at least for awhile, everyone gravitated towards the EASIEST MM with the most exp.  There may be 5 or 6 that were not difficult, but you always saw HUGE groups of people at one specific MM.  If that MM or Creator mission is so much easier than everything else in game, than they do prolly need to be nerfed or more content needs to be brought to that level.  Personally, I feel like everyone figures out where they get the most, and then that particular mission/instance/zone gets all the attention.  They need to fix this.  It's really a boring game when there's so much content and yet everyone is too concerned about grinding in the ONE easiest place.</p>

<p>Thus, extra exp for trying new things or a dynamic mission system that takes away exp for doing the same thing constantly -- really, it's about making it worthwhile to try different things.  I would never suggest people need to do the worst missions.  But I'm sure besides Creator there's got to be other DoN missions that can be done in a reasonable amount of time.</p>

<p>I still prefer getting a reward to trying something new as opposed to "punishing" someone who likes to grind.  I think Everquest should be about exploration and trying new and different things, and people who have that playstyle should be rewarded for it.  Just makes sense to me.  Why get the best reward in game for repeating things over and over ad nauseum as right now people do with Creator or certain MMs:(   But that's just an opinion....</p>

<p>Oh, yeah, add to that the more difficult Omens runes.  Seems like a better way of making these things would be to get no drop items out of a series of zones that are difficult but not extremely rare.  This sitting in one zone for months at a time like people do is just not immersive to a good game, IMHO.  And, no, I'm not doing them.  But some of my friends, they have very valid complaints on this.  Come on, developers.  You got all this great stuff, this wonderful buffet of content, and everyone's piled up eating the McNuggets in the corner.  Bad game design that we really need to get away from.  Again, just a humble opinion....<br />

<p>
<p>Well, you can blame instances for this problem.  If this perfect spot wasn't in an instance you would have 1 or 2 groups there and everyone else would need to move someplace else. Perhaps while doing so, find another area that happens to be just as good.</p>

<p>In a place like Karnors or Velks, there were premium spots and ok spots.  People waiting to join groups, people popping in an out. Always lots of chatter and generally a good time by all.  Now everyone sits in their single group, isolated instance, and tries to see how many times they can finish it to get as many AA's (or whatever) per hour as possible.<br />
