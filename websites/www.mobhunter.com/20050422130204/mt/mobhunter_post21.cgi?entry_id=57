<h2>Comments: The Reign of Zorillius</h2>

<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Tuppet at April 19, 2005 01:09 AM</strong></p>
<p>Fun?  I want to play the latest expansion - explore new lands, quests, items, new features (i.e. guild hall, tribute).  I came in after LDON but before GoD.  I liked LDoN but I felt ripped off by buying GoD because... except for 3 zones and tribute - I haven't used it.  This is because I didn't have the gear necessary to survive GoD zones.  Wish I would've known that before I bought it!  </p>

<p>OK.  How do I get the gear to play in GoD?  Through Time?  ugh - that's a lot of 'successful' raids (flags).  I was unable to even come close to getting the flags necessary to get time (before 85/15).  </p>

<p>Omens was a little better - as I was able to survive in the early zones.  but again, I don't have the gear necessary for these zones.  So you bet that I'm not going into a zone where it takes 5 seconds to get killed!</p>

<p>I busted my butt getting my toons levelled and geared.  however, I can only go so far and the raid/non-raid gap seems huge to me by now.  +300/300 vs my +80/80 </p>

<p>How am I supposed to compete with the new content when I can't even reach Time gear, which was 5(?) expansions ago?!  That's a lot to ask a player to go through before being able to play the latest expansion - which come out every 6 months...</p>

<p>New expansion zones are where most(taking a guess) players go when it's released.  as a player, I feel kinda 'left out' since the expansions weren't 'meant for me' and that is not fun.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>There are ways you can still upgrade your armor, Lost dungeons of Norrath groups, Dragons of Norrath Single Group missions both offer upgrades for people with +80/+80 Mana/HP gear.. </p>

<p>and with Dragons of norrath crystals being tradeable it makes getting better gear even easier  for non raiders.. the key to getting to that 300/300 gear is continual upgradeing.. you dont go from +50HP/Mana gear to +300HP/Mana gear overnight. </p>

<p>as you upgrade peices you can take on tougher mobs.. and those tougher mobs drop better stuff.. and the process continues.. you just need to find the right path..</p>

<p>Hopefully sony can provide more paths for progression thru the difficult parts.. such as those who find themselves at level 70 and are still in +80HP/Mana or worst gear.<br />

<p>The change to the 85/15 rule was a good one, but it still does not address the casual player. I am level 61, and in need of better equipment to continue in the game. I typically group with a 62 cleric and a 62 Pally, and we have trouble taking on Dark Blue mobs consistantly. The problem is equipment. </p>

<p>Being able to access the Time level gear would solve our problems, but getting a Guild to let us piggyback is not easy, and then we all have one problem in common. Time. Not the zone, the real life element of time. I do not have 5 to 8 hours to play the game, on any day of the week. I usually play between 1 and 3 hours a day, maybe 4 hours on the weekends. The raids for Time access, and the ones to get the gear, take more time than that. LDoN missions could upgrade me a bit, but not much, and the time:reward ratio is not good. </p>

<p>I agree that the gap is a more critical issue than Sony seems to think it is, and it really needs to be addressed. </p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Teremar at April 19, 2005 09:35 AM</strong></p>
<p>I think Time should have been instanced a long time ago, but then I've never understood having a PvP component (racing for content) in a PvE game. Will this fix all of EQ's problems? Hardly. But SOE has lots of experience with instancing now, so this should not be a difficult task. And I presume it will be purely a programming task, not needing any designer or artist time. So unless the designers have lots of new systems worked out and the bottleneck is getting them implemented in code, instancing Time will have very little effect on the broader issues like class re-envisioning.</p>

<p>One of which is cleric dependance. Looking for a group is not fun. And if the major reason groups don't form is because they can't find the cleric they need, then fixing cleric dependance will make the game more fun. Except perhaps for the clerics, who do not have such troubles getting groups. SOE had better tread carefully here, but there have been some great ideas on the cleric boards for making clerics less one-dimensional. SOE should do that.</p>

<p>Sadly this is one area where WoW learned nothing from EQ. Groups are constantly stymied for lack of a healer. Here's hoping SOE can come up with something good so Blizzard can copy it.</p>

<p>And since you're trying WoW, Loral, let me give you my "Beginning WoW for EQ players" lecture.</p>

<p>1) You can solo, but you'll have more fun if you don't. Go out of your way to find groups and make friends.</p>

<p>2) The first 15 levels or so are more of a newbie tutorial. It gets harder. Don't judge until you've done your first instanced dungeon.</p>

<p>3) In instances, fighting multiple mobs is the norm and there's no CC class. You can't just assist--do your part to keep the mobs off the healer. Everyone is CC.</p>

<p>And if you want to try a Role-Playing server, Silver Hand is nice and stable now. I'm guessing you wouldn't want any twink gear (not that twinking is all that effective in WoW anyway) but I'd be happy to send you some nice big bags. I hate the thought of anyone trying to get along with those awful six-slot bags you get in the newbie zones!</p>

<p>"There are ways you can still upgrade your armor, Lost dungeons of Norrath groups, Dragons of Norrath Single Group missions both offer upgrades for people with +80/+80 Mana/HP gear.."</p>

<p>Agree that LDoN is a good place to get upgrades.  but LDoN addies aren't being used as much as they once were.  There is a percentage of people that already got their points and upgraded their adv stone and moved on, let's say to DoN.  I think this is the biggest flaw with the LDoN route - lack of participants make this route less practical.</p>

<p>I liked LDoN but I think the number of points you get at lower levels is too restricted.  as stated by  mac173 "reward ratio is not good."  trying to get 1492 points for multiple slots will still take a long time - since you can't just crank out the points yourself - u need a group...<br />
(maybe make ldon points into a currency like DoN crystals?  just a crazy idea but thought I'd throw it out there.)</p>

<p>"you dont go from +50HP/Mana gear to +300HP/Mana gear overnight." -Armarant</p>

<p>I'm not looking for instant gratification on gear.  One, I was pointing out that the newer content is beyond what I'm capable of.  Two, I'm having a hard time trying to bridge the cap so I can leap-frog into newer zones/content.  </p>

<p>This gap started around level 65.  I think I "over-levelled" my toon to where my level is not reflective of my power - because of gear/aa deficiencies.  I found myself struggling in newer content like GoD/Omens - constantly OoM.<br />
</p>

<p>That's a lot of talk about gear when the topic should be fun don't you think?</p>

<p>Stating that MPG, RS are ONLY doable with Time gear is a fallacy. Augmented DoN gear, one groupable Omens/DoN gear go a long way into allowing non raiders to gear up. MPG single group trials group is close to top end Time gear. Everything BUT Quarm gear has lesser stats that MPG single group drops (or close).</p>

<p>The gap is wide not because people can't get gear elsewhere but because there's a HUGE gap in time commitment between casuals and hard core raids. Casual raiders won't equip any faster than a solid group of non-raiders going through Omens and DoN.</p>

<p>Gear accretion works in favor of long standing players and no matter what is done for casual gamers unless you spoonfeed them with items, they just won't play enough to keep up. </p>

<p>The game should be fun regardless. Not by bending the game backwards to fit a 5 h/week player into a  20 h/week player shoe or vice versa (both will be unhappy).</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Tuppet at April 19, 2005 11:12 AM</strong></p>
<p>ok more fun:<br />
1. easier way to locate and keep track of quests?</p>

<p>2. quest rewards are questionable, i.e. experience and loot.  is there a way to increase exp reward without creating a way to abuse the quest?</p>

<p>3. revamps - lavastorm upgrade was nice.  and OMG FV got taken over?!  what to do... (dynamic environment)</p>

<p>4. GM Events/major quests, like those 1-month quests - The Kidnapping of Firiona Vie.</p>

<p>5. What about a dynamic environment/zone?<br />
DoN has Ebon/Radiant crystals.  Would it be possible to set up events dependent on the turn-in of these crystals?  like if Evil faction was getting more crystals, they would start to take over a larger part of a zone(s).  perhaps to simulate a larger force - spawn major baddies, like dragons.  or even provide vendor discounts to those with greater faction.  </p>

<p>rewards/missions/events are just examples.  but it would be cool if the world somehow changed based on LDoN/DoN type missions.  "I" helped accomplished "something" instead of I killed Quarm and all I got was this lousy bp.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Teremar at April 19, 2005 12:29 PM</strong></p>
<p>The trick is, how do you make a game both 5 hour/week people and 20 hour/week people can play? Especially in the long run--after three years that's about 750 total hours played vs. 3000. Or to put it in practical terms, how do you create an expansion both groups will buy? For a while there were essentially two separate games, but that just doesn't work.</p>

<p>I think the solution has to be making player power not be a linear function of time played. For example, expansion #9 can have a way for people to get the same kind of gear people got in expansion #4, but in 1/4 the time. That way the gap in power doesn't continue to grow, making it impossible to design content for both groups. There's still a gap, but it is fixed in size.</p>

<p>Of course historically the problem has been that EQ's progression was non-linear, but in the wrong direction. Playing more allowed you to raid, which allowed much better progression than non-raiding even per hour spent. It seems like SOE has been working to fix that, and that's good.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by <a href="mailto&#58;loral&#64;loralcirclight&#46;com">Loral</a> at April 19, 2005 01:17 PM</strong></p>
<p>The new quest system they've added in Dragons is very nice.  Its a mix of the task system and the mission system but with basically the same features of other quest systems in EQ2 and WoW.  It tells you where to go, who to talk to, and what is left to accomplish it.  The quest rewards in Dragons of Norrath was usually on the order of an AA's worth of experience at level 70.</p>

<p>SOE plans to use this further as they improve systems like this.  I'd like to see progressive quest tracking (several quests that work together towards an end-goal) and equipment rewards.</p>

<p>Revamps are also a good idea but one has to consider the cost to totally rebuild a zone compared to its use.  One problem right now is that zones below a certain level never see near the use they do at level 65 to 70 just based on the age of the game.  I think making zones useful to all players of all levels though LDON-like scaling is one way but there's no real good solution.  Right now, hotzones are the best way.</p>

<p>However, it is clear from Craig's note that SOE is looking at revamping old world zones and revitalizing the newbie game.  Thats a good thing.</p>

<p>As far as the 5 / 20 hour thing, I think one key is diminishing returns.  All players should make the most progress within their first five hour a week play session.  Each hour after doesn't offer rewards quite as good.  This doesn't punish those who play a long time, it just slows down the extreme jumps that we often see.</p>

<p>In order to compete with WoW and EQ2, however, EQ1 needs to ensure that those total 20 hours are more fun than the first hour of WoW or EQ2. I'm enjoying the WoW newbie game so far and its already cut a tad-bit into my EQ time simply because I like the look of the game and I'm enjoying the quests.  Last night, however, my guild told me I was going to have to wait 45 minutes for a mob to spawn and I quit.  I camped Ragefire for five days straight once, but I'll never do anything like that again.</p>

<p>It's a real difficult balance these days and I don't think there is any one clear answer.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Stylx at April 19, 2005 02:04 PM</strong></p>
<p>yes... thats it Loral.. come over to the dark side!</p>

<p><br />
(The quests get better, and often times more fun as you continue to advance. There are a few areas of "Not quite so fun collection quests", but for the most part, at any level you can do some pretty unique quests.)</p>

<p>I've only played Horde, but i'm on my second char to 60. Second time around was twice as fun as the first time!</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Kubb at April 19, 2005 02:42 PM</strong></p>
<p>The way WoW appears to handle the casual/hardcore disparity is by making the equipment from raids only slightly better than what casuals can get as opposed to 400% better as is the case in EQ. This allows raiders to get better equipment but not to the point that content becomes trivial to them but overly difficult for casual players.</p>

<p>On the other hand, EverQuest started out this way too and it wasn't really until Luclin/PoP that things spiralled out of control.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by <a href="mailto&#58;mac173173&#64;yahoo&#46;com">mac173</a> at April 19, 2005 02:43 PM</strong></p>

<p>I think that will work as one element of a solution, but there needs to be a multifaceted approach to the problem. </p>

<p>The Plane of Time was a very difficult and arduous task for many players in EQ. Guilds have spent a ton of time getting people flagged, and then the major raids themselves. For their effort, they were rewarded with the best gear in the game. However, it is no longer the best gear, and those uber Guilds and people have moved on to more advanced content. Its time to unlock Time. Keeping any nonraiding players out of the content that is several expansions back AND impeding their progress to that new content is counterproductive. This is keeping many players from enjoying the available content in the new expansions, and is also limiting the players available to group with in those zones. I know that a lot of the veterans of the original PoP progression will not like it, and will be very vocal about it, but they represent the minority of players. The majority of players want a chance to progress as well. Not as fast, not as well, but advance. I have been playing casualy for over 4 years, and my main is level 61. My biggest problem now is, I cannot get better gear unless I move onto the new zones, but I cannot move to those zones until I get better gear. I need Time gear to move forward. I am not alone. Lets move the game forward, instead of holding it back. </p>

<p>Even if you made time an open, unlocked zone, you would not even be able to get passed phase 1 without (at least) 30ish to 40ish (probly more until everyone is familiar with it).</p>

<p>Yea, I guess you could farm phase 1 with one group (more likely still need at least 2 groups and probly 3 per portal), but heck same or better loot drops in mpg/rs.</p>

<p>So, while 'open raiding' would be an option for an 'unlocked time', your still having to commit the time required to successfully progress thru time, and you can't really do that very effectively playing 1-2 hours a night, nor for single or even double group hunters.<br />
</p>

<p>Two notes on the psychology of solutions proposed:</p>

<p>1) Reducing the xp you get after you've been online for a while will have players up in arms. Giving you a bonus for the first few hours of play will not, even though the end result is the same. Blizzard learned this when they proposed the first in beta and then "caved" and implemented the second. No need for SOE to repeat that mistake.</p>

<p>Note however, that a level cap and the fact that the AA's you haven't bought yet become steadily less useful as you buy the best ones available means EQ essentially has diminishing returns on xp. The problem is gear progression, not xp.</p>

<p>2) Those who conquered the Plane of Time are FIERCELY proud of their achievement. Even the proposal to open it will have them up in arms. Far better to create new zones with gear comparable to Time but no similar time sinks. This smooths out gear progression without devaluing their accomplishment.</p>

<p>On the other hand I've heard more than one Time raider say they'd never do it again--much like Loral and Ragefire. I've heard this even more from EQ vets now playing WoW: I think changing games even once makes you really think about the value of in-game accomplishments and what you really want out of a game. I find I'm much more willing to say "This isn't fun, so I'm just not going to do it" than I ever was in EQ. </p>

<p>I think there's a niche for games that are based on accomplishment more than making every moment "fun." But I suspect it's going to be a much smaller audience than most companies will want. I'm not part of that audience, but I do hope Sigil can stay true to their "Vision" even when Microsoft figures out Vanguard is never going to be the next WoW. Clearly SOE does not intend for EQ to only appeal to that audience, and that will continue to frustrate some people (Hi Redcloud!).</p>

<p>Time is 30 months old. If people wanted to make pick up raids for time, more power to them. Yet Quarm and time in general has some hard to replace drops that sadly god/omens/don hardly provided. </p>

<p>If time gets fully instanced, I wouldn't be shocked if it were opened.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by TraxxusFV at April 19, 2005 06:18 PM</strong></p>
<p>What's fun about EQ?  It's actually a very interesting question when you really consider it. When you look at the day to day mundane activities you may be involved in, each on their own really can't be described as fun.</p>

<p>Tradskilling: Spending hours and hours farming and gathering supplies, then sitting by yourself and click, click, click, until you see those magic words "you have gotten better at x (300)". It's certainly an accomplishment, but fun?</p>

<p>Exp grinding: Trying to squeeze the maximum number of kills into the amount of time you have to hunt. No time for chit-chat, just pull...kill, pull...kill. In itself grinding sucks, but the people you're with can provide some real entertainment.</p>

<p>Dungeon Crawling: Okay, dungeon crawling with a good group is fun.</p>

<p>Raiding: depending on your class, and the target, raiding involves a greatly varying degree of activity. IMO raids are hours of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror. But is it fun? Again, as with grinding, the amount of fun you have really depends on the people you're with.</p>

<p>Quests: Completing a quest is satisfying, but I've yet to find one that's actually fun.</p>

<p>Gear: Getting upgrades gives a definite warm fuzzy feeling, but the next day, it's back to the grind to find your next piece.</p>

<p>What I really enjoy about EQ is that it provids a totally foreign environment in which to interect with other people.</p>

<p>An easier question to answer about EQ, is what's not fun.<br />
1- Being passed over for a group isn't fun<br />
2- Getting a great ability, then having it nerfed into a pg.50 bookmark isn't fun<br />
2a- Finding out a nerfed ability is going to be nerfed again isn't fun.<br />
3- Having the Devs ignore well thought out feedback isn't fun.<br />
3a- Watching respected members of your class communtiy turn on each other because the devs are ignoring well thought out feedback isn't fun.<br />
4- Getting a raid mob to 40% only to have the zone crash isn't fun.<br />
5- Having a mob that's six levels below you resist root 6 times in a row when you're on crowd control...definitely not fun.<br />
6- Camping a spawn point for hours, and hours, and hours for a piece of equipment isn't fun.<br />
7- Having some l33t haxor gank your spawn by using showEQ and macroquest isn't fun.<br />
8- Trying to acquire rare spells with marginal effects...not fun<br />
9- Being below level 60 and buying a new expansion with advertised content for 36-70, then discovering there's only content for 60-70 isn't fun.<br />
10- Did I say being ignored by the devs isn't fun? I figure I should say it twice.</p>

<p>Ok so they make Time instant.  So what, I still will not be able to go there or actually want to, or by the time I get to Time I will be more interested in better more fun stuff.  </p>

<p>I never have figured PoP, or justified the psychology of it.  Why do I want to go and kill the person I worship.  Hmm Sounds like one of those crime shows with the psychopath on a killing spree.  </p>

<p>No I want adventures and fun that are riskie, that I can tell stories about.  I want content that makes me desire to go on and on to find out how I rescued, or became the hero, or survived unsurmountable odds to come out on top.  </p>

<p>I do not want to be one of the sheep in a "zerg" raid on a mob that I really know nothing about other than it is a stepping stone to another object.</p>

<p>What makes EQ fun? Almost anything you can DO! However, what those of us (I'm a non-raider) with a mix of Ornate, OoW and prior bazaar loot can do is limited. What's not fun is putting together a group that could handle an average 63 LDoN of two Necros, an enchanter, a mage, a cleric and me (63 Ranger) and discovering that there's no way on Norrath's green earth that you can do a DoN mission. No plate tank, rez city. So we all got individual Stillmoon tasks and went there.  Another nightmare, as the mobs heal, gate, etc. and you're constantly dealing with 3 mobs in camp with the stupid high resists of mobs a dozen levels higher than them.  In the end my 5 hours of play time had about 90 minutes of what I'd call fun and 3.5 hours of waiting for rezzes, waiting for other members to get/recover from rezzes.  </p>

<p>So, how can I improve my gear so that I can tank in DoN? 120K per Bazu Flame armor piece in the bazaar, 15 LDoNs per 1492 piece (which nobody does any more), or OoW armor from zones I'm not high enough level to get invites too yet. It's started getting better on the OoW zones, as I've hit 65AAs and as long as I'm not the puller I can stay alive long enough to get experience.</p>

<p>Unless I go solo in PoP tier 1, Luclin, or earlier, I'm dependent on having a plate tank and a healer to access content that I pay for and I need to be able to survive in other content that I pay for. </p>

<p>While DoN on the face of it looks like a great idea, SoE made the social agro ranges, even between different 'species' of mobs so huge it's sick.  If you're not invis going to an instance, expect to be swarmed by 3 mobs that agro 6 or more other mobs from outside your clip plane. </p>

<p>The only reason EQ is still fun for me and lures me back to it far too often is that I've come to accept it will take a long time to access new content or great groups or the kindness of strangers that need Ranger DPS. My guild is great and we have fun crawling Howling Stones, most of us have master keys, or making a run through Droga. Eventually we'll do enough LDoN's, which we still do because it's one of the few places we can get good experience with our gear and something more, that I'll get my LDoN 1492 chest piece. I just do these things and enjoy them and wait for Bazu Flame armor to become common enough to afford it. Eventually I'll get lucky enough to be asked to a group that kills a WoS named that drops my Tier 1 no drop piece for OoW armor.  Eventually all of that happens, and as long as I don't let it get me down that it will be at least a year before I see Time, much less Qvic or MPG, and remember there are 100s of other zones to do stuff in, I'm OK.  </p>

<p>Could SoE improve on this? Absolutely.  They could put a task in the game that has 120 steps that can be accomplished by any solo/3 or 4 friends player in 1-4 hours per step (depending on how much help) with a 150HP piece of armor at the end, or, even better a 75HP or 35 resist augment that can stay with you a while. Heck, send me to every zone in the game if you have to!</p>

<p>GoD and PoP it was flags that kept people out of zones, now it's equipment. So, I can go buy plat (which I would NEVER do, and neither should anybody else) or I can just enjoy what I can do and realize that eventually I'll have 200AAs, level 70, better gear and trouble finding a group outside of guild as everybody has moved on to the next 3 expansions :). </p>

<p>So, having fun in EQ is about attitude, and having the attitude that hanging with friends killing stuff is fun, will keep you from being frustrated that you don't have the latest and greatest gear.  This game has content for all levels and eventually all content will be trivialized.  My guild took down Trakanon with 11 people. Yeah, we had an uber Berzerker to tank, but that just emphasizes how eventually, everything becomes doable.  Just enjoy what you can do, save your plat, be willing to try new things, and the game will come to you!</p>

<p>I'm still having fun in EQ, but I can see the end of my time playing the game. </p>

<p>Once I get my characters up to the point where I have to dedicate large blocks of free time to raiding or LDoN missions to get the gear to stay alive in the zones of the new expansions, I'll find something else to do with my time and money.</p>

<p>While groups are fun, most pickup groups I've been in lately have been exercises in finding the zoneline....or a rez. Seems that most of the people who know how to play have moved on to the high-payoff zones. So I spend a lot of time soloing or hunting with a partner.</p>

<p>EQ isn't very friendly to soloists, and if one of the partners isn't a good healer, it chews up duos pretty fast as well.</p>

<p> Tradeskills are diverting, but not when they get broken with the new updates. Being social with friends is enjoyable, until they get a group above your level and have to drop the chatter. </p>

<p>Sure, I could plug myself in and grind like a demented monkey to gain the levels / AAs / gear that would let me keep playing, but I have this thing I call a life, so I'm not going to do that. </p>

<p>When I leave a game that I no longer enjoy, that's one more account down on the way to the next server merger. Sony needs to give me something I can enjoy, without selling my soul to raid the Planes.</p>

<p>The dependance over a warrior can be a problem. </p>

<p>The interdependency is not. It's a strength of EQ.</p>

<p>300HP drops don't fall in ANYONE lap like that. The time and effort involved by FIFTY people to get ONE drop far exceeds what a single group is willing to put up with. Again people indulge in self-pity and berate what they don't like, can't do, don't know, aren't up to.</p>

<p>Not all single groupers are self-serving, ignorant and unskilled but it would reflect the bias and berating of raiding in their mouth.</p>

<p>DoN is a grouper expansion.</p>

<p>Fully augmented DoN gear is equivalent to raid gear.</p>

<p>Augmented DoN gear gives access to all groupable content...</p>

<p>I think people need to re-examine a few things.  Number one, whats the point of having raid content in general if people that dont' raid can go and do everything you can do.  Also the whole complaint about GoD being closed off to everyone except for 3 zones really is rather amusing.  In a smattering of planes of power ornate and finer ldon armor ( especially with some augs), a balanced group of lvl 65 80+ well spent aa adventurers can go to the vast majority of the single group zones of GoD. Qinimi, riwwi, Barindu, some of ferubi, and the sewer trials.  After spending some time there they would be ready for vxed certainly.  The first half or so of tipt wouldn't be incredibly difficult. So much of what I read from people is that they die when they go there.  </p>

<p>And to the people who say DoN is too hard because mobs heal, gate, and have alot of casters.  Well thats really not something new. Go to sebilis with a group of level 50's in gear that you only farmed from sol b and lower guk.  People that are used to the lazy mindless grinds of easy single pulls in wide open outdoor zones will have trouble with DoN missions at first.  But dying a few times and learning from those deaths helps alot.  </p>

<p>Also to the people that say people who don't raid dont' have access to nice gear should try out some tradeskills, or find their class forums and ask questions of people there for tips on single groupable gear for people of their level.  There are lots of wisened old guys waiting for a chance to share their wisdom there.  You might have to put up with some smart alec remarks and such, but if you yourself are respectful and polite most times they will be too.</p>

<p>Also the upcoming server merges should increase the pool of folks doing pick up groups so it will be easier to find cheaper gear in the bazaar, more folks to group with etc.</p>

<p>One thing i think that would help casual folks alot more is to increase the tribute given for many items. Tribute is a great way for folks to get some increases to their stats, especially for haste, flowing thought, ac, and attack.</p>

<p>Most of the needed focii are all on DoN vendor for a minimal fraction of the effort once needed to get those in raid, then on ornate (cost/timewise).</p>

<p>Focii, anger, stuns, gear, weapons are all available on DoN merchants and it's NOT that hard to succeed in DoN content. Mobs don't hit that hard at all, nothing close to GoD or upper Omens.</p>

<p>And you can easily complete them with tribute as mentionned above.</p>
