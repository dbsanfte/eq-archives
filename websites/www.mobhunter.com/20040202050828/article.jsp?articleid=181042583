   <font class="ArticleText">My original plan was to wait until the patches had stopped to put up any commentary about them, and well, it's entirely possible at this point that, I would never be able to update again, so we're going to assume that it will be atleast a few days before the next one and run with it.<p>I know some of you think I am always negative, so I'm going to say that I'm absolutely positive, that it has been a very long time since such a buggy patch has been moved to the live servers and they have been unable to fix it.<p>I would probably say that it was moved before it was really ready simply because of the upcoming holidays and the fact they said they the melee enhancements would go in on the 16th. They delayed it two days but still ended up going with what they had.<p>At first things seemed fine, but stability rapidly went downhill, and that's been the story ever since, with servers being taken down atleast once a day, and crashing twice a day atleast in the case of my own server. The first thing blamed was the Casino in Shadowhaven, which was very popular atleast as far as putting money into it, it was less popular on the, getting anything worthwhile out of it side.<p><strong>** Shadowhaven Casino goes on vacation **</strong><p><strong>We're sorry to have to say this, but the new casino has become too popular. The huge number of players gambling at the casino is causing issues with the servers, and has been responsible for a few zone crashes. Unfortunately, this means that we have had to remove the casino NPCs until after the New Year arrives.</strong><p>That of course was not quite accurate since there were never really a <em>huge</em> number, atleast in the reports I've seen, I knew better than to go spend my money. It's up for debate if they just thought that was what it was, or if the Casino was a one shot deal designed to simply suck out a large block of cash before players realized you could spend hundreds of thousands of platinum and get nothing. It's highly unlikely that it would have retained it's luster more than a few days with the rate at which golden tickets were being awarded.<p>Anyways, after the initial patch patch, the exact same problems persisted which consisted of escalating zone lag, inability to reconnect to the servers after being dropped, and at some point, the servers just collapsing. Say what you want about me being negative but this is the sort of patch and crashing that can quickly make positive people, cynics.<p><big>As if it never happened!</big><p>Prior to the patch going live, I did not go to the test server to see any of the melee changes, because it would be pretty pointless to play a level 25 warrior to try things. Now, between crashes and patches, I have gotten a lot of hands on time with the changes so I feel like it's time to comment, and unfortunately my comments are going to be negative, although I will make them constructive!<p>The problem as I see it, is that the linking of disciplines to endurance, actually adds extra restrictions on them, which means there are and will likely be a lot of times when you are unable to use them not because of the timers they run on, but because you are out of endurance. Previously, every discipline a melee character had, used a single timer, but each discipline made you unable to use another for a variable amount of time. So if I used one discipline it might be 25 minutes, but if I used another it might only be 7:30. That meant that each class pretty much used one or two disciplines, such as defensive, evasive for warriors, since you had to be ready as often as possible to use them, because the game is all but designed around them.<p>Now, the disciplines are split into four groups, each group uses a common timer, which means you can sit on the defensive related disciplines if you are a warrior, and use an offensive discipline, without worrying. The issue is that each discipline drains endurance, with offensive ones, devouring it, and the regeneration rate is relatively slow in relation to using disciplines. So instead of it being as simple as 4 groups of disciplines each on its own timer, and you're free to use others, for warriors in particular that freedom is very hampered by the fact you need to maintain some amount of endurance for emergency discipline use. For monks and warriors it's less of an issue because of the nature of the classes and their disciplines. It's perfectly fine that a rogue loses half his endurance to use Duelist, but as a warrior, I can really use it no more than I would have before, just to conserve endurance.<p>The next bit that warriors gained was the Provoke line of abilities. These are a scaling line of abilities that add a direct amount of hate, and then some hate over time. Now, I should say here that I actually play two warriors, my main character is a 65 troll warrior, who is a time level, ok geared, high AA character. In addition, I have and play a 62 froglok warrior on the same account and server, who has relatively average gear. I've played both in a variety of situations since the patch.<p>The opinion of some warriors from the Steel Warrior boards is that the line is better than nothing, and I guess they are right, in that it isn't nothing, but it's not exactly game altering and doesn't really give warriors a great new advantage. Honestly, I have never really understood the problems warriors have had with controlling agro, because I have never really had a problem with it. The line as it is now, I don't see helping those types since it does next to nothing in many cases.<p>One case where I had high hopes for the ability, and this is where I feel warriors could really use some help is when I pull a variety of NPCs to my guild, to have the ability for warriors to use the ability as things are entering our camp, to be split up. One of the most dangerous things is to have 3-15 things all focused entirely on one person, even a well equipped warrior can do nothing. Unfortunately, the line does next to nothing in this situation, as I've used it on things, only to have them run past me to someone who shot an arrow at them. Paladins still will be the preferred method with stuns and root.<p>As far as it's general agro increasing abilities, it's not really that great there either, since if you believe that 1 hate = 1 damage, which is debatable to begin with, but let's go with that, it comes out to adding an effective 18 hate/damage per second, which I doubt will really alter the consistancy which some warriors are able to maintain an NPCs focus.<p>All of that is not to say it's entirely useless as I have found a few specific circumstances where you are able to use it and note some effect. Most notably if someone, like a wizard, is summoned, using Incite or Berate can many times return focus to the warrior. The problem of course is taunt would work also most of the time. Last but not least, my froglok uses it to pull, because he doesn't carry arrows around.<p>The board isn't up but a warrior on the boards suggested a good change to the line which would be to put far more of the hate in the initial hit, and then do less over time or have it last less than a minute. The net to hate is the same it's just organized in such a way where it's useful in the cases where I feel it's the most needed.<p>Then, the last thing to consider is the provoke line uses endurance, and if used too much, can end up draining you completely.  On top of that and the discipline issues, we have yet to see the opening/special move system in it's final state, which also will drain endurance.  At this point unless an opening/special move provides serious benefits or very minimal endurance costs, they will not be as useful to warriors who must maintain a certain level of endurance for discipline use.<p><big>In other news</big><p>Lastly I will end with a few tidbits from around Norrath. First off the Fallen server had it's name changed to Discord. Sony gave a reason but it's a lot more likely that it had to do with a seemingly text based MUD <a href="http://www.play.net/dr/fallen/" target="_new">having a server</a> by the name, which also just happened to be a fairly unrestricted PvP server. Also, there have been reports of a variety of issues, on top of the fact that EQ PvP is pretty bad and unbalanced. I think at this point, it could have been interesting, but some things just weren't ironed out and it's a contest of who can come up with the most imaginable way to generate points with the least risk.<p>Sony is also trying to <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=60135" target="_new">get people</a> to do a specific LDON raid by claiming Curt Shilling is impressed by the incredible challenge presented within the Everfrost Synarcana raid. I thought this raid had already been completed, but I'm not certain. I doubt Curt Shilling has any idea about LDON raids, or their problems and I doubt this will change much in that regard. It's an interesting idea, but that's about the extent of what I think. I guess it's just not enough to get me to bother or care, but good luck to anyone who does.<p>Lastly, we have another <a href="http://championsofnorrath.station.sony.com/calendar.jsp" target="_new">special offer</a> by Sony if you pre-order their I assume upcoming Champions of Norrath game. A nice <em>Babes of Norrath</em> calendar for all those people who just are too lazy to search for real life pornography. If anyone actually orders the game because of the calendar, they are a sad sad individual. I do have to say though that from my quick glance at the games vital information, it does look interesting to me. It looks and sounds like a diablo clone, as in an action orientated character development game. Unfortunately, it's not coming out for PC, so as it turns out, I can't care that much.<p>That's all for this time around, there is a bit more to talk about, including who owns your rusty long sword, you, or Sony and what the Chinese have to say about that, but that will have to wait til after the holidays. Have a happy whatever you celebrate, even if it's just celebrating a day off.<br></font>
