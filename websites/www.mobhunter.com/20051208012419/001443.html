<h1 class="article_title">Interview with Prathun on Everquest Raids</h1>
<p>by Loral on December 05, 2005</p>

<p>On my first guild summit nearly two years ago I met a designer and bent his ear as I bent so many with my gushing praise for LDON and my desires for an LDON 2.  The kind man nodded and smiled enthusiastically, mentioning their own feelings with the release of LDON and their own desires for a system like that in the future (what became today's mission system). Little did I know I was speaking to the legendary Prathun, Johnathan Caraker, the main raid designer for Everquest since the days of Gates of Discord.</p>

<p>Prathun is the most experienced raid designer in the Massive Online Gaming industry.  His Everquest resume includes most of the Epic 1.5 and 2.0 raids, all of the single group and raid trials of the Muramite Proving Grounds, all of the dragon raids in Dragons of Norrath, the design of Dreadspire, and all of the raid encounters in the current peak of high-end raiding, the Demiplane of Blood.</p>

<p>Today we give you a Mobhunter exclusive interview with Prathun on the past, present, and future of raid content in Everquest.</p>

<p>Loral: What sort of decisions go into the design of a raid encounter?</p>

<p>Prathun: It might be easier to ask, "What decisions don't go into the design of raid encounters?"  We have choices to make about the lore behind the task, its complexity, the intended difficulty, loot rewards, involvement with the expansion progression, and intended time investment.  </p>

<p>While risk and reward decisions are obviously crucial to the creation of a well-balanced raid, lore is an often underestimated aspect of the design.  A well-developed character with history and roots in the story of EverQuest is more interesting to pit players against than an entity no one has heard of.</p>

<p>Loral: How have you seen raids and raid design change over the years?</p>

<p>Prathun: I've seen raid design come a long way since original EverQuest.  Looking back at the early years of the game, encounters were typically a single mob with a few spell abilities attached.  As our scripting language has matured, it's opened up the opportunity to mold some truly unique and interesting events.  Raid mobs can change their attributes over the course of the fight, react to the strategies of the players, and even exhibit artificial intelligence that feels almost human.  </p>

<p>The Proving Ground Trial of Corruption is a good example of the latter.  It pits the raid against NPCs that mimic the behavior of player characters:  the warriors can call out for assists, clerics heal those in need, wizards who root players then back away to nuke them, and monks with the ability to feign and mend themselves when brought to low health.</p>

<p>Loral: How have raiders changed in their attitudes and feedback towards raids?  How do raiders today compare to the raiders of five years ago?</p>

<p>Prathun: Experience has taught raiders how to deal with the basics of positioning, healing, and adds, so it wouldn't be possible for me to get away with the same kinds of raids that existed five years ago.  A big NPC that hits hard and has a few damage AEs isn't going to present any interesting challenge to current raiding organizations.  They've all "been there, done that" and could complete that kind of raid blindfolded.  </p>

<p>As for the attitudes and feedback part of the question - they haven't changed a bit. :)</p>

<p>Loral: There has been a recent trend since Omens to require more from each individual member of a raid.  This has spawned both positive and negative feedback.  How do you see this new style of raid design evolving in the future?</p>

<p>Prathun: Oddly enough, I would classify a fun raid versus a poorly designed one by that criteria:  does everyone on the raid have something to do?  Do all participants have a meaningful role in the event, a reason for being there, and an opportunity to affect the outcome?  I want to make sure that everyone at a raid is playing the game, not semi-afk waiting for the chance to bid on loot, so you can expect to see more raids that require attention from all attendees in the future. </p>

<p>The traditional means of accomplishing this goal is to present challenges that play to all classes' strengths.  I try to give offtanks something to offtank, crowd controllers mobs to mesmerize or charm, curing classes debuff spells to cure, and so on.  The other means of accomplishing the goal is to present generic tasks that are critical to the success of the raid but can be completed by any class.  Examples would be having to kite a cursebearer in Inktu`Ta, responding to a gaze from Mata Muram, or being in charge of the moon relic when facing Vule.</p>

<p>Loral: How do you decide what power level to design raids for in a new expansion?  When is it appropriate for Anguish or Demiplane of Blood content as opposed to Elemental or Time level content?</p>

<p>Prathun: While there's always been some overlap between expansions, we try to raise the bar and introduce new challenges every expansion, especially when the players gain a significant increase in power via levels, AAs, spells, or gear.  The power level decisions touch on raid design, itemization, and expansion progression, so they're hashed out by several key people early in the design process.  The intended difficulty of a raid is set in stone long before I ever sit down and start brainstorming the mechanics behind it.</p>

<p>Loral: Raid balancing and retuning seems common these days.  Can you explain the problems with tuning raid content before and after the release of an expansion?  Why do we always see such radical shifts in raid balance after release?</p>

<p>Prathun: We've discovered that it is near impossible to emulate the circumstances of a Live server environment on Beta.  Guilds perform differently when real loot is on the line, have better turnouts on Live than Beta, and they'll conjure up unconventional strategies that aren't attempted when a developer is watching over their shoulder.  Beta testing has been invaluable for testing the concept of a raid and ferreting out functionality bugs, but it hasn't been 100% effective in hitting the difficulty bullseye.  </p>

<p>I am fairly content with how the Demi-Plane of Blood has turned out.  While it has seen tuning changes and will certainly see more in the future, they won't be the dreaded 'radical shifts'.</p>

<p>Loral: How do you determine the number of players a raid should require?  How does this effect the design and testing of a raid?</p>

<p>Prathun: Generally speaking, the higher the difficulty level of the encounter, the more players it will require, the more complex the design, and the harder it will be to test.  Our established player count for end-game raids is 48-54, eight to nine groups.  </p>

<p>A large part of the difficulty of these end-game fights is in maintaining a roster of well-geared and reliable players that are available to tackle the encounters on a regular basis.  This doesn't translate well to single-group content.  There's no fair way to approximate the coordination of organizing a Demi-Plane raid and apply that same challenge and reward to six people. As for testing, a small event can often be tested by a hodgepodge of assorted players on the Beta server, but a full guild is needed to put an end-game raid to the test.  Anything less is a waste of time.</p>

<p>Loral: You mention tying high-end raids to the roots of Everquest history but few of the high-end raid targets are known by anyone other than those who activly raid against them.  How do you plan to bring more of the lore of high-end encounters to the rest of the players?  For example, in Depths, most any players can see the transformation of Emperor Draygun to a lich in the excellent monster mission "Fall of Illsalin".  Do you plan to continue this sort of trend?</p>

<p>Prathun: Absolutely.  I'm a big fan of introducing the antagonists early and often, and there are many ways to accomplish this.  Tirranun stormed through Lavastorm and screamed at the mortals for daring to trespass in his domain when Dragons of Norrath launched.  The major players in Velious were described in stories that were featured in the game's instruction manual.  Gorenaire and The Cragbeast Queen were figured prominently in areas where anyone could see them.  </p>

<p>The raid encounters in the Demi-Plane of Blood are described by the inhabitants of Dreadspire - you can hear the Wailing Sisters crying near the guest rooms, and the watch often catches a glimpse of Zi-Thuuli off in the distance.  The best way to bring the lore to the players is by letting them experience it firsthand, as in the Fall of Illsalin monster mission you mentioned.  To Oshran's credit, that mission arc was an amazing bit of storytelling.</p>

<p>Loral: What sorts of things can we expect to see in the future of Everquest's raid content?</p>

<p>Prathun: Without revealing too much, I'd like to point out that there's going to be some familiar faces from EverQuest history making an appearance in the near future!</p>

<p>Loral: Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with us.</p>

<p>Prathun: Thank you for the opportunity!</p>

<p>I have to agree that Everquest's raids have continued to improve over the years and remain one of EQ1s most compelling aspects.</p>

<p>It's for this reason I find it really wierd that Everquest has NEVER been marketed as a raiding game. WoW blew the market wide open to the mainstream, most MMOers know what a raid is now. So advertise it guys. </p>

<p>SOE have an excellent game with excellent raid content - stop calling EQ "classic" and do some videos and stuff of "current generation" raid content.<br />

<p>Tolaren, you're right - EQ is strong in raids, that's PvE raids.<br />
It's what makes players return from other games.</p>

<p>Raiding is the main reason I came back after playing EQ2 and WoW and not being satisfied by either.  Though it's unlikely I'll be raiding as much as I used to. Other reasons include nostalgia, the quality of Depths of Darkhollow; the regular group missions are great. The merged servers are teeming with life, at least AB is.</p>

<p>One thing, if you're reading this Loral, is you haven't written anything about the rumours of a Station Exchange being rolled out to EQ. Back in the old days, you could be sure that Moorgard would pick such a juicy topic to get people's tongues wagging. At least that's what he would have done before he turned to the Dark Side.</p>

<p>Back when EQ2 was still on the drawing boards i read many people commenting & discussing in which direction they planned to take eq1 & eq2 after the release of eq2 & consequently the other mmo's that have since gone live (WoW for example)</p>

<p>I have seen that since PoP that EQ has developed a very strong raiding game & for me full credit to Prathun & his team for the Imaginative raid encounters they have developed & I hope continue to develop, i tried eq2 for a short time & wow too & i think they are very much catering to the more casual end of the market for people who have less time to play, EQ1 cater's much better to the player who chooses to spend more time on MMo's with a solid amunt of group content, vast amounts of general stuff to do & what I see as some of the very best raid level stuff on the market, keep up the good work.</p>

<p>"Everquest has NEVER been marketed as a raiding game."</p>

<p>People like me would blow a gasket of it was advertised as a raiding game.  It's a lot more than just a raiding game at the moment but there are a few heavy voices that still argue that SOE has put too much focus on raiding at the high end already.  I'm not one of those, but I think those voices would get a lot louder if it looked like SOE said the path of EQ is the path of a raider.</p>

<p>In reading Prathun's EQ resume, I realized I've never done any of it. :P  The last raids I participated in were pre-EP PoP.</p>

<p>Interesting interview anyway.  It's good to see some of the more interesting aspects of raid encounters slowly make their way into single group encounters (MPG trials, some DoD missions, etc.), even if those still seem to be aimed at single groups consisting primarily of raiders.  </p>

<p>"In reading Prathun's EQ resume, I realized I've never done any of it."</p>

<p>Actually, one of the things I talked about at all three summits was about finding more ways to get Prathun's talent out in front of more people.  I have it on good authority that we may see a Prathun-enabled monster mission and I expect we will see more, though I have no such data to support the statement.</p>

<p>However, as talented as Prathun is, there are some very talented people who do the missions such as the Jarzarrad the Prophet missions.  I hope to do a mission-centric interview in the future =).</p>

<p>I am all for raids where everyone has a role.  I also like raids that are more than just "Corner the big mob and keep a CH chain on the tank".  However the recent trend towards highly scripted raids is becoming extreme.</p>

<p>Queen Sendaii is an example.  It takes us more than ninety minutes of nonstop fighting to beat this encounter.  There are no significant breaks, and no bringing in replacements if someone needs to leave or goes LD.</p>

<p>Here are the steps involved:<br />
1) Twelve spiders spawn.  A random number of them can be mezzed (usually about 3).  The rest need to be tanked and killed.  Some of them mez players.  This wave is timed, so if you are good you can have a minute or so to recover.  if you are slow then you still have spiders up when...</p>

<p>2) Twelve drachnids spawn.  Again, three or four can be mezzed.  Some charm, some mez, and some "evade" by warping away.  Again, you need to OT while your raid kills them.  I hope you have this wave cleared before...</p>

<p>3) Queen Sendaii wakes up and starts wandering around the room, spawning adds.  There are six total, but each splits into two, and each of THOSE splits into three.  The originals need to be tanked, although the splits can be mezzed.  While you are killing these 54 trash mobs, the Queen herself is wandering around the room casting short range AEs, so roughly every 90 seconds your whole raid needs to run to the other side of the room.  You have about 45 minutes to clear these 54 adds, which is when...</p>

<p>4) Queen Sendaii wakes up and you can tank her.  She has a directional AE (like Rikukkin), meaning that if she looks left, everyone needs to move to her right side because the left side gets nuked.  Of course she is meleeing and you need a CH chain on the tank.</p>

<p>5) When she is at 70%, she splits into 4 identical mobs.  Only one is casting the directional AE, so that is the real Queen.  You have to take the three fake ones to exactly 60% while you take the main one to 40%.  If you are off by more than a percent or two, the fake one splits and you have to take THOSE splits to 60%.  If you have the percentages correct, she recombines into a single again.  Remember that you are doing this while dodging her AEs.</p>

<p>6) When she gets to 25% she starts spawning adds.  LOTS of adds.  The longer she is alive, the more she spawns.  We've had more than 40 adds alive before we managed to kill her.  If you manage to burn her to 0% and don't die to all the adds, you win.</p>

<p>You basically need a degree in systems analysis to manage this thing.  It makes Vishimtar look like Lady Vox in comparison.  And I don't even want to talk about the evil that are tasks that lock as soon as someone zones in.</p>

<p>"And I don't even want to talk about the evil that are tasks that lock as soon as someone zones in."</p>

<p>That is one of the MOST FRUSTRATING things about leading/managing some of these raids.</p>

<p>Vish does it upon engage.</p>

<p>Queen does it when you zone in.</p>

<p>While other raids do NOT lock until you win or get passed certain points.</p>

<p>There is no consistency.</p>

<p>They all need to lock at approximately the same time or point of no return in the event.</p>

<p>I'd like Prathun to actually consider the people who play the game when designing encounters. EQ has gone from adventure and laughs, to military style "do it because it has to be done or we'll lose our spot as top guild."</p>

<p>The above poster was right on par with Queen Sendaii. It's not a fun encounter, it's not enjoyable, the third wave is long and drawn-out. After you get through the hour long "assist the MA or get booted" phase, you're still prime to lose the fight. As a raid leader, I feel my guild members are becoming bored with long and satisfaction-less encounters such as Queen Sendaii. I thought Emperor Draygun was bad clocking in at over an hour, but Sendaii took the cake. If I could say anything to Praythun, and have him listen, I would ask him to move away from his "script for the sake of" fetish, and get back to what's fun.</p>

<p>Losing encounters over and over again is not fun. It's an emotional drain. Having to spend 2+ hours in a single dreary zone fighting the same SCRIPT is not fun. People don't enjoy this encounter. There's a reason for that (well several) starting with its length.</p>

<p>If I could recommend a fix for Sendaii, it would be three-fold: First, the adds in wave three need to be dropped in number. After the first pop, there's really no more challenge, it's just repetitive mundane with a dash of movement. Unfun. Secondly, the encounter should become EASIER the further you progress, not harder. The adds at 25% are just a frustration. If you get her to 25%, you should be able to just finish the encounter. Not have to be punished (and it is punishment) through an hour and a half of waves, and then have to leave the encounter to the chance of the burn at the end. And thirdly, there needs to be a “halfway marker.” Do you remember Sonic the Hedgehog for the Sega Genesis? Those little light posts you flip over when you’re at half level that allow you to come back to that point when you die, something like this needs to be implemented into long fights. Think about the people playing, that’s 54 (assuming there’s no afk list outside) people who are drinking soda, sitting hunched over in their chairs, some with kids, some just home from work in need of food, for TWO hours without a single break. That’s not “fun,” that’s called “a job.” Now, unless you plan to start paying EQ players, you might want to think in breaks. Putting Sendaii in her own room would have this effect. Get past the waves, and any point that you die on from there on out, you can recover and start again from the halfway marker. Not reset the whole mess of work and go again. This would allow people to feel the fight is still recoverable, and give raid leaders a chance to go over the strat, check their buffs, give any needed afk time, and the like. Remember that *people* play EQ, not computers, marines, or navy seals.</p>

<p>Also, people become invested in their guilds and in their characters. Making them into script puppets doesn't make them feel happy, it makes them annoyed. I don't know why any developer would want to make people annoyed, but Sendaii does just that.</p>

<p>Maybe SoE should listen to their customers, and not "go it alone" as it were. I'm sick of having to reach further and further down into the barrel to pull up new people who don't utterly hate the game, to show up and raid the unfun encounters of DoDh.</p>

<p>Rebut me all you want, but I have hundreds of people I talk to from various servers who feel the same way.<br />

<p>I have to agree.   Right now Prathun is about as popular as [I'm sure you can find a less insulting metaphor - Loral].  </p>

<p>Sendaii is frankly insulting.  Ridiculously long and unfun and frustrating.  </p>

<p>I can appreciate the difficulty in tuning a challenging raid, but it should be an easy given that a constant 90 minute repetition-fest that you have to start from scratch at any wipe is NOT A GOOD IDEA.  </p>

<p>EQ for me lately is a burden I deal with to hang out with old friends.... Sendaii is the worst encounter design since original Corniav.</p>

<p>It doesn't have to be advertised specifically as a raiding game, just to let older EQ1ers who quit long ago, or newer WoWers who are bored of WoW raids that EQ1 has plenty to offer them.</p>

<p>100% agree.</p>

<p>A raid has to be FUN. A raid has to be reasonnably SHORT. A raid has to be class skill based, not emote based.</p>

<p>Snaring people is NOT fun. 1hour + raids are not fun. Getting to a raid zone-in in more than 10 minutes isn't. Raids locking at zone-in rather than at kill, isn't.</p>

<p>There are many things that can aggravate people without being tied to the boss kill itself.</p>

<p>That said, I'm not saying everything is black. I never grew bored when clearing Anguish although we did for a solid year. Yet I was bored after a month of DoD.</p>

<p>Newbies should start with WoW. Learn the basics there. Then play EQ for raids and advertise EQ as THE raiding game. Group and tradeskill is found also elsewhere and possibly better. While EQ could market on the shoulder of Prathun's work.</p>

<p>That is, if it can step back from pure military discipline and 7 days and 5 hours raid routine to make it enjoyable. And bring back some fun factor.</p>

<p>"1hour + raids are not fun."</p>

<p>Going to corrent this quote...</p>

<p>1 hour+ raid EVENTS to kill ONE EVENT, are not fun.</p>

<p>Multihour raids, like anguish, time, and even tacvi (/gag) are (or can be) fun.</p>

<p>The key differences between say Queen Sendaii.. and Ture, Hanvar and AMV combined? You can take all 3 anguish bosses at your LEISURE and when your ready to, NINE loots (not including epics/runes) vs 3 (not including flags) for queen. In the same or less amount of time.</p>

<p>Having recently beat Queen a couple times, I have to say this encounter is not necessarily about skill, its about execution and endurance.</p>

<p>It's sad when people die intentionally just so they can get up to take a bio break or get a drink or bite to eat.</p>

<p>BTW, Vule is not much more fun than queen either.</p>

<p>I hope demiplane will be funner than the crap that came before it, but somehow the thought of being snared/dotted/etc for hours at a time for the next few weeks is not something to look forward to.</p>

<p>I have to disagree with the above posters who say Queen Sendaii is not fun, I absolutely loved this encounter, Its fast frentic & requires great co-ordination from everyone, nobody can sit there afk & let the rest of their guildies carry their ass through you are involved or you lose.</p>

<p>I appreciate some people find some encounters overly long, or overly frustrating, but not everyone is of the same mind, some LIKE hard stuff, some LIKE to be challenged by difficult encounters.</p>

<p>I have to agree that sendaii is a pain. after countless days of butting our heads on her, we are showing wear and stress in our guild. and the only way we can really go up is going thru sendaii</p>

<p>and the only way to get thru sendaii is with luck. not strategy, not skill. pure luck.</p>

<p>I'm coming to the point where I think you need a separate team of content developers for raiders and non-raiders. In recent weeks we've had both WoW devs and EQ devs talk about how they the things they do to make raids challenging don't translate to single groups. And it's true.</p>

<p>But the implication seems to be "And thus there's no way to make challenging single group content." No, the real implication is "We don't know how to make challenging single group content."</p>

<p>Today's raids are challenging because Prathun and people like him have spent years figuring out how to make them challenging. They've thought hard, worked hard, pushed the technology available to them to its limits, and like it or not the results are clearly their best effort.</p>

<p>If that kind of passion had been put into single group content from the beginning, I'd still be playing EQ. But single group content never got past the "big NPC that hits hard and has a few damage AEs" stage, at least not while I was playing.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what really challenging single group content would look like either. It will take years to develop, just like raid content did. It's like asking someone during the Velious era to propose the Sendaii encounter. WoW took some very good steps forward with single group encounters like Archeadus or the Zul'Farrak Pyramid. But now with Tigole and Furor making new content, the creativity seems to be going into raid encounters, just like EQ.</p>

<p>And that's the trouble: we all know how polarized players are over raider/non-raider issues. Does anyone really think that devs are immune? I'm sure they try to be impartial, but it takes passion and a love for the game to make good content. I just don't think raider devs have that passion for the game non-raiders play.</p>

<p>I think the original WoW devs had it--and that's why Blizzard sitting on 4 million accounts now. But an awful lot of us non-raiders are just holding on, hoping the new single group content promised in the expansion brings back the magic we felt the first time we fought through the Deadmines. "Wow! A story! Scripted encounters! Bosses that require planning and tactics! [okay, not much, but we're talking about the WoW equivalent of Crushbone here] AND I'M NOT IN A RAID!"</p>

<p>I agree with Teremar, challenging single group content would be alot harder than raid content. At least with a raid you know roughly the abilities of the toons that will be thrown at it. With a group it could be anyone with a huge set of possible different abilities. This is why I think we will see more MM's to fill this kind of role cause it is the easy way for the designers to define the abilities of the group and then to design an event around that definition. However as long as MM's do not become the norm for building group challanges things will get better. </p>

<p>Neither is true and they proved it in DOD.  The single group missions in DOD are excellent and very challenging.  The same is true for a lot of the DON single group missions and the MPG single group trials in Omens.  There is a lot of excellent single group challenge and I expect we will see more.</p>

<p>I'm also not sure I agree with Prathun's statement about it.  The Seeker is a raid-like event for a group of six and people like it a lot.  It's hard, the reward is good, and it gives a single group all the feel of a raid.  The same is true with the 70-5 mission in the Demiplane of Shadow.  That's the most fun I've had with a group in EQ.</p>

<p>DoN and DoD do sound like an improvement (I suspect in reaction to WoW's single group content, and there's nothing wrong with that). But I have yet to hear a raider say "Wow, that is hard. If you non-raiders can pull that off, you deserve some pretty good gear."</p>

<p>What are you guys on about? No challenging group content - it's all around you - are you blind!? Lol</p>

<p>Just off the top of my head I can think of places like Vxed, Tipt, Kod'Taz Trials, MPG trials (ok some were easy), and recently certain DoDH missions?</p>

<p>People said those things were TOO challenging, so they nerfed them a bit, or improved the rewards, but they're still pretty challenging for your average non-raider guy. <br />

<p>""Wow, that is hard. If you non-raiders can pull that off, you deserve some pretty good gear.""</p>

<p>I hear it a lot and I saw it a lot on the boards.  The single group content in Dreadspire is extremely challenging and the gear rewards from the high-end DoD missions is Qvic level 200+ hp mana gear.</p>

<p>WoW's single group stuff is lagging behind EQ.  While WoW has a popular and well-developed solo game, their group game focuses on just joining with people to complete solo quests.  There are no group quests - quests given to the entire party at once and completed regardless of who picks it up.</p>

<p>The other day in WoW I went into Gnomergoria with a group.  Members in our group, including me, ended up making mad dashes during combat to finish up our own individual quests.  I had the same thing in Stranglethorn.  I was grouped with three others and all of us were at different parts in our quests so we just ran around finishing off each person's individual quests instead of all working together on a single quest.  This is WoW's biggest disadvantage and one of EQ's greatest strengths.</p>

<p>This isn't anything EQ does better at all about this - every quest in EQ requires each person to collect the drops.  I've said this over and over - how much better would the VT key quest have been if there were group drops where each person in the group would have received the drop at the same time if they had the quest and were on it - the same has carried on to the DoN tasks where adding 3 more people to your group who need map pieces actually makes your quest take longer!</p>

<p>They should really make the change of allowing quest drops to drop for multiple people at once so there is incentive to work together on quests.<br />

<p>Well, sounds like there may have been even more improvement than I thought. But are those fun and challenging encouters the rule or the exception? Do non-raiders spend the bulk of their time doing them, or is grinding still the norm? (Serious questions, not having played those expansions.)</p>

<p>I didn't consider Vxed and Tipt "challenging" in the good sense though, even as an enchanter. "Charm break--must recast charm spell within a second or die" didn't require much more thought than Mata Muram's emotes. Kod'Taz and MPG trials were well beyond my reach so I can't comment.</p>

<p>But as for your criticisms of WoW Loral I don't see any substantial difference between "Quests the group gets as a whole" and "Quests individuals get themselves but need the help of a group to complete." Sounds like your Gnomeregan group was a bunch of uncoordinated newbies (which is not surprising at that level--they tend to start coming together at about 40-45, though these days you're likely to get all alt groups that are good at much lower levels). A good instance group will start by finding out what quests everyone is trying to finish and plan the run accordingly. For those who prefer playing in groups, like me, the dropped loot and xp make repeating instances even after the quests are done a very viable way to progress. WoW instances are LDoN done right in my book, and the vast improvement in creativity and just plain fun outweighs any issues with the incentive structure.</p>

<p>By the way, Stranglethorn Vale IS solo content with the option to form groups, not group content. I suggested it earlier as a way to tide you over until you get to the mid to upper 30's and instance groups become easier to find. Once you can get into Scarlet Monastery groups you can level from there to 60 entirely in various instances.</p>

<p>I wish people would understand what a huge line of BS that is and what a profoundly negative impact it has on the game.</p>
