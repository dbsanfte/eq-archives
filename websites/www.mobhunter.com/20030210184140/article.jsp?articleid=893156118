   <font class="ArticleText"><BIG>The Bard, the Bald, and the Bearded</BIG><p>Zee patch, she is big today, my friends:<p><b>January 28, 2003  3:00 am<br>------------------------------<p>** Gameplay and User Interface **<p>- Further optimizations to reduce bandwidth and 'lag'.  It is difficult to describe the value of this change, but it should show a noticeable improvement for many.  We've also resolved many of the hit point update and movement issues that occurred recently.<br>- Made an improvement to the animation code that may reduce the slight delays that can occur when a new player enters a zone.<br>- Spells on spell book pages 33 to 50 can now be deleted for those who were having troubles.<br>- Corrected a bug that could cause a crash if a character tried to purchase an item or close the merchant window just as he was leaving the trading range of that merchant.<br>- Players should no longer get out of range message when trying to target a player on a horse just because the horse has moved a little (but is still in range).<br>- Corrected an issue in Fungus Grove that was allowing some ranged attacks to land unnoticed by NPCs.<p>** Spells **<p>- Lull, Soothe, Calm, Pacify, Harmony, Calm Animal, and Rest the Dead should no longer give the: &quot;Your spell did not take hold,&quot; message.<br>- Bard Songs with a &quot;Rune&quot; component should be working properly.<br>- Sha's Advantage and Savagery are now available on vendors in the Plane of Knowledge.<br>- Illusion spells used with Luclin models should now show the appropriate hair.<br>- Infusion of spirit should no longer overwrite Speed of Vallon.<br>- Sense Summoned will now sense elementals of most types.<br>- Eye of Zomm and Stalking Probe cast from a horse will now be able to look up and down.<br>- Call of Rizlona now has casting text for the person that procs this spell.<p>** Alternate Advancement **<p>- Monk discipline Resistance should increase resistances properly now.<br>- The Shaman AA ability Spirit Call should now finish casting if you regain concentration after interruption.<br>- Corrected a problem where right-clicking on an AA hotkey would highlight the wrong ability on the list in the window.<br>- There will now be a confirmation window available when spending AA points.  There is a new selection in the Options menu called Fast AA Purchase for toggling this confirmation.<p>** Items **<p>- Spirit of Snow and Spirit of Flame will be dropping more frequently now.<br>- Merchant's Crate of Supplies will now fit into containers that can hold giant-sized items.<br>- Removed Paladin and Ranger from the list of characters that could use the Hateful Balanced Zweihander.  It is only usable by worshippers of Innoruuk, and was never meant to be used by these classes.<br>- The Resplendent War Maul now has a more appropriate inventory icon.<br>- Crypt Master's Conjuring Stone is now more valuable to NPC vendors, and they will not sell it as cheaply as they did in the past.<p>** Quests **<p>- Killing Kazen Fecae is no longer a viable path to the completion of the Necromancer Epic quest.<br>- Tibrinn Ember now gives a faction modifier for the completion of his quest.<br>- Hanns Krieghor will no longer grant faction increases just by talking to him.<br>- There are now a few Iksar in the Plane of Knowledge that are interested in your Iksar racial armor.<p>** Bazaar **<p>- Corrected a bug in the Bazaar that caused price changes made by traders to only affect one stack of the same item.<br>- Target Group Buff and the AA ability Mass Group Buff can no longer be used with levitate spells to push traders out of their stalls in the Bazaar.<p>** NPCs **<p>- The specters and shades in Velketor should no longer be dropping cloth armor.<br>- Centi Dators should no longer spawn inside walls.<br>- Oozing Flesh in the Tower of Frozen Shadow should no longer drop Sabretooth hides.  It was determined that these creatures are too slow to catch a Sabretooth, and that they do not have the ability to skin them nor the desire to wear (or eat) their hides.<br>- Elder Spiritualist Grawleh will now respond properly to hails.<br>- Fittorin Bladespur will now respond properly to hails.<br>- A Frost Giant Sentry will now respond properly to hails.<br>- Tanik Greskil will now respond properly to hails.<br>- Kozyn Gigglephizz will now respond properly to hails.<br>- Pit Guard Retaj will now respond properly to &quot;What grunts?&quot;<br>- Lendel Deeppockets now knows how to spell &quot;rogue&quot;.<br>- Corrected text for Arinna Trueblade, she now tells you how to make armbands instead of helmets.<br>- Prime Patriarch Vuzx should be less likely to leave his usual spot.<br>- Gindlin Toxfodder should be less likely to be out of his usual spot.<br>- Deputies Budo and Drebo should no longer get stuck under the floorboards of their tower.<br>- The River Source in the Warrens can no longer be attacked.<br>- Moved Mignar Mi`Draskch a little bit so that newly created enchanters would not try to appear on top of him.<br>- Lorekeeper Zorik is now properly described as a female in text referring to her.<br>- Peras Glickon will now tell you that he sells food and drink (which he does) instead of spell components (which he does not).<br>- Fantoal Geabaran should now offer the inventory for sale that he claims to have.<br>- Old Gourdhead should no longer be disliked by the other natives of Misty Thicket (fixed a faction bug).<br>- The Muglwump will show up less frequently now.<br>- Dark Huntress in Mistmoore will now use the correct model and is on the correct faction.<br>- Corrected the models for elementals in the Plane of Earth.<br>- NPCs in the &quot;pit&quot; area of Plane of Tactics will now respawn properly.<br>- Removed Sarnak Slaves from Nurga, since they had no models there to use and looked like the base model human (Doug).<p>** Character Appearance **<p>- The bald head can now be selected during character creation by clicking the left arrow button (was only available by clicking the right arrow).<br>- Beard color selection now works for dark elf male, high elf male, half elf male, and dwarf female during the creation of new characters.  Note:  Dwarf female only has one style of beard.<br>- The ability to pick a wode is now available at character creation for Barbarians.<br>- Choosing the &quot;random&quot; button at character creation will now randomly choose a face rather than always using the initial selection.<br>- Changing from a male to a female character or from a bald character (such as Iksar) to one that should have hair will no longer make the new character appear to be bald.<p>** Miscellaneous **<p>- Intelligence and Wisdom should now update properly after character becomes drunk/consumes alcohol.<br>- Fixed a number of doors in Freeport that were opening incorrectly.</b><p>Not a bad list of stuff. Some long-standing bugs have finally been addressed, and other game improvements make this a worthwhile patch. Getting rid of the hiccup when someone enters a zone sure would be nice, but that's been an elusive problem for a while now.<p>We were foolishly hopeful that the further changes to reduce bandwidth usage wouldn't cause problems like last patch, but sadly this is not the case. After a long downtime, players are reporting crashes <B>every time they zone.</B> Expect another patch any minute now, but until then we can keep examining the one that's already on the table.<p>Many folks should be happy that Pacify/Lull-type spells are supposedly fixed. That bug was a drag for pullers and explorers who relied upon these spells.<p>There were a number of issues addressed in regards to character models. Beard color is now an option for elven types, and dwarven females finally get their beards back--not that anyone has the female dwarf model activated anyway. Barbs will be pleased to pick their facepaint at character select. I'm sure that will be a woad off their minds.<p>Sorry about that, but I had to point out Verant's typo somehow.<p>Hey, whataya know? Sha's Advantage and Savagery can at last be purchased. People can finally stop complaining about their absence.<p>So overall it was a good patch with a ton of fixes (assuming a follow-up fixes the crashing issues). My only qualm is that some of these things should have been handled years ago. I mean, doors in Freeport? I presume they mean the bank door, for instance, which opened inward and perpetually trapped players. Why couldn't they have fixed this back when people actually used that zone? And why take over a year to fix some of the basic functionality of the Luclin models like beard color? Word is that (wonder of wonders!) a tan bridle now actually summons... drum roll, please... <I>a tan horse!</I> Hey, I'm all for new content, but bugs and design flaws need to be addressed in older content a lot sooner. Whatever happened to that poll we all took about whether we preferred new content or fixes to old stuff?<p>Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go find a new spot to farm cloth armor since they nerfed my spectres in ToFS. Damn you, Verant!<p><BIG>No, We Haven't Forgotten</BIG><p>The EQ team posted a <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=53816">status report</a> yesterday to let us know what sort of issues they are working on and to reassure us that they do indeed read all the whining on the various class boards:<p><B>We wanted to give you an update on some of the things we've been working on lately. We've been following the various class and server boards, and looking for pressing issues. While this isn't the complete list, here are some of the topics currently being reviewed - <p>- PoP planar flags and how they are acquired. We're experimenting with some ideas that let people accompany their raids to the deeper planes without having all previous flags. Our goal is to allow a player to participate in raids and guild events, even if the player wasn't able to acquire a previous flag. This would not grant them a flag for that zone, but would give them access to it while on the raid. We're looking at several options, but our current version in testing allows a raid to bring along a small group of people without the necessary flags, if the raid has most of it's members flagged for an event or plane. <p>- PoP zone access quests. We're looking at the difficulty of the quests for individual access to the various planes. Our goal is to make it reasonable to gain access to later planes by doing the quests, without making it trivial or unbalancing when compared to the raid-gained planar access methods. <p>- We're looking at the state of Charm spells, and may make adjustments so that the cost and risk associated with charming high-level pets is balanced with the power of the spell. <p>- We're continuing to evaluate the drop rates of PoP spell parchments to see if any further adjustments are needed. <p>- We're reviewing the tanking ability of the various melee and hybrid classes to be sure each class is competitively balanced with the others. The main factors we're considering are the ability to take damage, deal damage, and the additional abilities of each class. The goal with this review is to find any issues where melee classes are not &quot;bringing enough to the party&quot; when comparing their package of abilities. We're paying particular attention to the avoidance-focused classes such as the monk, to be sure things end up where they should. <p>- We're going back through priest classes to find any major balance issues. Currently we're focusing on healing, secondary abilities, and the value of each class in different situations. <p>- Shields and blocking. We're reviewing the impact of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield. We'd like increase the value of shields, and make it a worthwhile choice for players who might normally dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon. We're working on balancing this against classes which use shields by default, and therefore wouldn't be making any trade-offs to equip a shield. <p>- Lull spells. We're watching the impact of recent changes to be sure these spells remain useful, but are not over-powered. <p>- Riposte and Enrage on planar mobs. We're looking at alternatives to make these abilities less punishing on common planar monsters. <p>- Tradeskills. We're reviewing the current recipe line-up for any gaps in skill progression, and items that aren't appropriately rewarding for their difficulty. <p>Thanks for playing, <p>The EverQuest Team</B><p>Well, I'm a little upset. I had an editorial in the works to talk about some of the problems that have arisen out of the PoP expansion, but now it seems a lot of these are under the microscope already. Guess you get the capsulized version instead.<p>Flagging wasn't a bad idea, and is better in many ways than doing key quests like we saw in previous expansions. However, the flaws in the system make it even more bothersome at times. The necessity of killing the same tedious mobs over and over again to flag people has turned recruiting for many guilds into a major hassle. Do you really want to kill Grummus every time a new member joins your ranks? How do you properly evaluate an applicant unless they have the flags to attend raids with you?<p>The solution proposed above sounds pretty good. As long as a clear majority of the players on a raid have a flag for a particular zone, even those without flags can come along for the ride. The only question is a matter of quantity. If this system only required say 51% of the raid force to have a given flag, it would pretty much encourage some people never to even attempt to get flagged. Lazy players could just save themselves the hassle of attending the boring flag raids and ride on the coattails of their guildmates to attend the fun stuff. I'd say the percentage should be more like 90% of your raid force has to have the flag. That way applicants and new recruits can come along for the fun, but players will still be encouraged to keep up with their flags.<p>I'm of a mixed mind on how many key quests there should be for deeper PoP zones. Granted, the majority of the planar content should not be the exclusive playground of the uberguilds. But at the same time, I don't think I ever want to see unguilded characters running around the elemental planes with an LFG tag on. But in any case, balancing key quests with the raid forces required to obtain flags is a tricky matter, and if it isn't handled properly you can rest assured there will be much uberscreaming going on.<p>Melee balance is a major issue right now, as the very design of PoP has put pure melees at a huge disadvantage in terms of desirability. Is this mere melee whining? No, it's a result of the paradigm shift that PoP brought about.<p>Let's review. Starting with Velious and continuing through Luclin, mobs got more and more hitpoints as a countermeasure to increases in player power. Since new weapons and spells elevated damage output tremendously, boss mobs were given a jillion hitpoints to compensate. The culmination of this is boss encounters in Ssra Temple, Seru, and Vex Thal where casters nuke and nuke and nuke, healers heal and heal and heal, and melee types hit the autoattack button and go watch reruns of <I>Dynasty.</I><p>The designers of PoP looked for a way to avoid the snooze fest of a fight like the Emperor, so they went the other direction. Many PoP mobs possess a fraction of the hitpoints of their Luclin cousins, but have many times the damage output. This makes for faster-paced fights where you want to waste a mob quickly before he lands another quad-2K round on your tank. Many of us applauded this change and were grateful for the freshness of some of these encounters.<p>But what we didn't realize until later was the effect this would have on class balance, especially in terms of mana versus melee. A short-duration fight favors mana users. Why? Take nukers, for example. A wizard is designed to do extreme amounts of damage in a short period of time. In previous expansions, this ability was balanced by the fact that wizards would run out of mana on long fights, and would have to use mod rods, meditate, or beg necros for their mana in order to keep doing damage. With the shorter fights of PoP, nukers can go all out in a short period of time, doing an absurdly higher percentage of total damage than most melee can.<p>Part of the problem is also the very design of pure melee classes. Monks, rogues, warriors, and even most hybrids can be seen as sort of walking DoT spells. In most cases they don't do a ton of damage real fast, but over time their DPS really adds up on a mob like Aten Ha Ra. But in a fight that lasts only a few minutes, pure melees simply don't have the time to be an effective part of the equation.<p>So why not just boost the power of melees to compensate? Well, then there's the catch-22 of all that old content which would become horribly unbalanced in favor of melees over casters.<p>The core issue, you see, is that pure melee abilities aren't tied to anything like a mana bar--and they should be. The original idea of the stamina bar was (I think--it's been so long since it meant anything) that when you ran out of stamina your combat skills and certain other abilities would lessen. This is a concept that should never have been abandoned. Melees should be able to output high amounts of damage while they have stamina, and then should either have to rest (a la medding) or see their damage output drop dramatically. By handcuffing high damage to a downside, you can much more easily balance the effects of increasing player power. This is what--until PoP, anyway--kept casters somewhat in check despite the flow of ever more powerful nukes. The lesson should have been applied to melee as well.<p>It's probably far too late in EQ's lifespan to see a fundamental change like this--although we've said that before and have been proven wrong--but hopefully other games can latch onto this idea and make use of it. Imagine if a monk or rogue could triple their damage output in short bursts, but doing so would require some kind of downtime between fights (and I'm not talking about some crappy ten-second discipline here). It would make for a more interesting game, and would necessitate much more strategy than simply moving behind a mob, hitting autoattack, and going AFK.<p>Hmm, looks like I managed to turn this into an editorial anyway.<p>At any rate, pure melees currently aren't, in the EQ team's words, bringing enough to the party. Aside from tanks, who are still needed to hold aggro while the nukers do all the damage, melee types don't feel the love these days. One of the few exceptions to this is the rogue's new invis ability, which is so much more useful than any other melee skill obtained with PoP that it's staggering. But with the warrior's continuing aggro deficiencies and the fact that monks are mitigating about as well as a wet paper sack, pure melees are sleeping in the doghouse most nights. At least rangers can do absurd archery damage sometimes and paladins get crits for thousands of points against undead. Other melee-oriented classes need at least that kind of situational usefulness too.<p>This sort of leads into other issues mentioned in the team's letter, such as charm spells in PoP. When an enchanter (or--in some circumstances--a druid, necro, etc.) charms a mob with a ton of hitpoints that hits for 600+ a pop, melee players tend to feel a bit, um, undersized. On the other hand, charming classes <I>should</I> be able to pull off neat tricks like that for limited periods of time, as long as they don't step on the core roles of other classes. So what could counterbalance this? Maybe cut the damage output of a charmed mob in half, or make it so Complete Heal can't land on an NPC. While we don't want to see the ability to charm become useless, greater balance is clearly required.<p>Changes to the way riposte and enrage work on planar mobs would be interesting. When MobX's max hit is 2500, you really, <I>really</I> don't want your pets or fragile melee classes taking ripostes, or to have a lag spike hit just at enrage kicks in and see half your raid die in the space of half a second. The trick is that limiting ripostes runs the risk of making tanking too easy... plus there's the nicety of enrage being a sort of Darwinian filter for lazy folks who don't pay attention to mob health levels. Ah well, can't have your cake and eat it too, I guess.<p>In any case, the issues before the Dev Team are weighty ones, and addressing them properly is crucial to the future of the game. Too many classes have been marginalized a bit too much lately, and some rather major changes are required to set things right.<p>Until then, I'll keep watching those rascally Carringtons. Ah, the 80s were glorious, weren't they?</font>
