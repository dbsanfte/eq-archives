   <font class="ArticleText"><BIG>It's Just Not Faire</BIG><p>Over on Monkly-Business, Kurrlee is reporting some <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=21093.topic">details</a> on this past weekend's FanFaire in Dallas. Among the notable notes:<p>- The new Luclin character models will not be having their appearance or animations changed<p>- The Bazaar works, but they have elected to create an interface for it rather than releasing it with cumbersome &quot;/&quot; commands<p>- There is no plan to reduce downtime any further<p>- Nurga and Droga revamps have been tested internally for over two weeks now (no word on when they will be moved to Test server)<p>- They are considering changing more epics to have some of the spawns be triggered<p>- Additional steps are in the works for epic weapon quests to bring the results more in line with current high-end gear<p>- The number of developers working on EQ has doubled (compared to what, I don't know)<p>- Items that raise skills don't have any effect if the skill in question is at 252<p>- Besides adding a raid channel, they are looking into ways to add raid experience, as well as ways to increase exp for those who move around in a dungeon rather than sitting in a single spot camping<p>Sounds like there was a lot of good info at FanFaire (read the original thread for even more). Zone revamps are good, more developers is good, and an additional step to the epics should be interesting. Thumbs down on not fixing some of the character animations, however. Let's hope they at least add a bunch that are currently missing.<p>Not all was fun and games in Dallas, however. Apparently some folks thought they were playing <a href="http://www.lineage-us.com/">Lineage</a> and went on a real-life PK attempt. While the story is mired in he-said she-said bullshit, it seems a member of Fires of Heaven clashed with a few players from the Tallon Zek server. Bloodiness ensued. Read all the <a href="http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735generaldiscussion.showMessageRange?topicID=27608.topic&amp;start=251&amp;stop=263">flames</a> if you want to, but mostly it's all just <a href="http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735generaldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=27618.topic">pathetic</a> and sad.<p><BIG>For a Good Time Call...</BIG><p>Ever wonder why items get the stats they do? Well, the now-departed Kendrick let his secret <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessageRange?topicID=9530.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=25">slip</a> over at The Safehouse.<p>Take <a href="http://darkhorizon.angrybunni.org/images/screenshots/daen/jencuir.GIF">Jenniy's Two-tone Cuirass</a>, for instance. Besides 60 AC and 5 to all saves, it has 8 STR, 6 DEX, 7 STA, 5 CHA, 30 WIS, and 9 INT. You don't have to be that guy from <I>A Beautiful Mind</I> to put the numbers together: 8, 6, 7, 5, 30, 9... 867-5309--the song made famous in the 80s by Tommy Tutone. Suddenly the name of the item makes sense, no?<p>While Kendrick hasn't confirmed it, we hear the stats on primal weapons add up to the amount of money SoE has made off its subscribers... no firm word on how many zeros you have to tack on to the end, however.<p>In another thread, Kendrick showed a less playful side and <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=21801.topic&amp;index=269">responded</a> to criticism levelled against him both by the player base and, to a certain extent, by his former employer:<p><b>Lets get some facts out here, now that I am at liberty to talk a bit.<p>I can tell you for a fact I had nothing to do with Rangers getting, or not getting, Triple Attack.<p>I can tell you for a fact that I almost got fired for trying to explain some of the reasoning behind the initial tuning pass put up on test several months ago. After that post, I was taken entirely out of the loop on that issue. Entirely.<p>I can tell you for a fact that the perception that I coddled rogues kept me from doing anything substantial for the class the entire time I worked there, warranted or not. <p>I can tell you for a fact that I had nothing to do with that whole Mrylokar's Dagger thing, other than to make a smartass remark about it in the Back Alley. That remark wasn't even aimed at the players, but rather a good-natured little jab at the folks that made and placed it, who gave ME a hard time about overpowered items and rogue favoritism. I just thought it was funny.<p>And finally, I can tell you for a fact that while I was known for playing a rogue, I wasn't a rogue-centric designer, I was a PLAYER-centric designer, who preferred to make most of his public postings on a board he was familiar with, and a board that had a good signal-to-noise ratio. That preference to post here may have been a mistake in hindsight, in terms of what perception it created. But that's all it was, a preference on where I posted, not on what class I favored.</b><p>While some of the zones Kendrick designed have had a few, uh, glitches over the years, he's obviously a guy who cares a lot about the game and those who play it. Maybe--just maybe--the guy is finally due a little slack.<p><BIG>Perhaps the Ring Needed to Be Resized</BIG><p>It seems that the Ring of Fire quest in the Acrylia Caverns has been hit by the <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=12111.topic">nerf bat</a>. Here's a brief description for those of you who don't know how the Ring works. There is a small circle of torches in Acrylia. As long as someone remains standing in the circle, waves of skeletons spawn. Every so often, a boss mob spawns, and the next wave of skeletons gets progressively harder. Once you get up to the fifth boss, you start seeing some very nice loot indeed.<p>Well, it seems Verant has decided that the quest was too easy. Now, starting after the fourth boss, the skeletons all AoE heal each other. This obviously makes things much more difficult, and really puts the quest out of reach of most guilds. Granted, killing the fifth boss was not easy to begin with, but honestly, unless the loot on boss four was upped, this quest just rose several notches from its already impressive spot in the pain-in-the-ass rankings.<p>Granted, some of the drops were way too good for the risk involved, but those of you who have suffered through the Ring of Fire know how god-awful boring the thing actually is. After spending two hours cooped up in a tiny lagfest of a room, we're due some nice drops. Doesn't look like this is going to be the case anymore.<p>Ring of Fire-type quests are a great idea. But in this case, I think the nerf bat has smacked down a bit too hard, and may have killed one of the more noteworthy content additions to Luclin.<p><BIG>I Was Actually Looking for the Tower of Frozen Pizza</BIG><p>Speaking of noteworthy content, Muse over at EQ Atlas has added new maps for <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/velious/towerfrozenshadow.html">The Tower of Frozen Shadow</a>. This is a very, very cool zone in Velious, and one of the few puzzle-type zones in that expansion not intended exclusively for high-level players. Now that you have nice maps to guide you, there's no excuse for not checking this place out. It's <a href="http://www.konstruktiv.net/kitty_02.html">freaky</a>, but it's cool.<p><BIG>Godzilla Never Needed Gloves, Anyway</BIG><p>Monks panicked recently (now there's a shocker!) when it was <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=20988.topic">discovered</a> post-patch that Brother Zephyl--one of the quest givers for the monk's Robe of the Lost Circle--no longer dropped said quest robe every time he gets killed. Why is this a concern? Well, this robe is a major hurdle in the monk's epic quest, and some Iksars (as well as slothful humans) prefer to snuff poor Brother Zephyl rather than do this part of the quest due to the extensive faction work involved.<p>So why is the above thread ten pages long? Besides the expected Iksar monk bitching, you have human monks who are voicing support for the change, since being able to kill this monk for his quest result is seen by some players as a cheap way to bypass a crucial step in getting the epic. After all, Iksar faction woes were supposed to be a balancing factor for their higher AC, night vision, and regen.<p>Whatever your stance, it's not really worth getting into a tizzy over. It seems the issue was <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=21093.topic">raised</a> at FanFaire, and Verant claims the robes were not meant to be removed from the drop table. In fact, an Iksar-only portion may be added to the epic quest, as Iksars were not intended to do human monk quests.<p>Hey, that's only what some monks have been asking for since the quest was put into the game. I guess epic quests, like fine wine, just take years to ferment.<p><BIG>Signs and Portents</BIG><p>We <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-2101121781">reported</a> the other day that Brad McQuaid's new company is called Sigil Games Online, Inc. I pondered where the name came from (the definition of &quot;sigil&quot; is a seal or a signet, often a symbol of power in astrology or magic), and one of our readers offered some first-hand insight:<p><b>Brad aka Aradune was for years, guilded on Sojourn an old dikumud in a guild called Crimson Sigil :)  was proud to call him a guildie too, still am :P</b><p>Mystery solved, thanks once again to a Mobhunter reader. While company names related to the mystical are all well and good, we're hoping Brad isn't planning to go too far into it and release <I>Harry Potter Online</I> or something equally <a href="http://entertainment.yahoo.com/entnews/wwn/20020116/101119320009.html">absurd</a>.</font>
