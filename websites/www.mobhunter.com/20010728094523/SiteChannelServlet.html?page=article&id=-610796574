<p><b>You having to ask that question is more telling than any answer you will
get.
<p>How may of the question and answer threads are pure fake? Come on admit it
you post threads containing nothing but Verant created "players" don't you?</b>

<p>Ok, you made me laugh. That's good.

<p>There isn't any reason for me to post fake comments or questions. For example, on this topic alone we've received nearly 300 comments so far. Not one of them was made up by folks within the company. I find it pretty amusing that you would think we'd have the time or desire to invent players and send comments in.

<p>Oh, and PLEASE don't send your responses to this thread directly to my company e-mail. Yes, if you do I'll get them to the right people and into the right places, but it's a lot easier for me if you just reply using the form. Thanks.

<p>Here are some non-fake responses to our question from Friday:


<p><b>I really enjoyed the Staff of the Wheel quest. The book that you recieve at the begining has a riddle in it with hints to the locations of 10 rods to collect. These are then placed into a container and combined to recieve a reward. This quest is perfect for wizards as I see them. We use our teleportation abilities to travel all over the world and aquire these rods. Some places we must go are VERY dangerous, so we must be stealthy and use our invisibility spells. The quest doesn't include mindless camping of a mob for a rare drop. In fact, ideally, it can be done without killing anything. It is not, however, easy because of this. I needed the help of several characters to aquire some of the rods. From summoned waterstones from my mage friend, to protection of higher lvl characters, i could not have done the quest without assistance. My favorite quests are challenging to complete, that involve a puzzle of some sort (like the riddles with locations of rods), are difficult to do alone, and have a reward equal to the risk (the staff of the wheel is a very nice item for a wizard below lvl 50, and can be used in the Ice Comet quest later). Good job, whoever created the Staff of the Wheel quest.

<p>Hi, thanks for the opportunity to provide some feedback.

<p>Great quests are those which possess elements of Norrath's faction politics and history, are either short and challenging or multi-stepped and easier steps. Great quests are very specific for a class, gender, religion and race. That is, the reward incorporates these elements and the story which unfolds in the quest tell a story related to this. 

<p>Generic quests are not nearly as immersive. Ones which put someone in a struggle to "change the world" or "make a difference", which are very specific to race/relition/class/gender give one a reward beyond an item.

<p>Another element in great quests is well, the reward. The item doesn't necessarily have to be all powerful. It does, however, need to be specific to one's class and powerful not against all creatures, but specific ones. For example, a ranger weapon which procs only against servants of Rallos Zek, or against giants would be superb. It is like the ghoulbane, it gives the wielder a better identity for the hard work finishing the quest.

<p>I hope this is concise enough to make sense. I don't do all the quests, though I've done many. 

<p>Thanks,<br>

Kurt Hausheer

<p>p.s. Great quests also support 4 team play like we have on Vallon Zek. More identity that way.

<p>Alan, 

<p>The level 49 Paladin quest spell, Divine Might, is an awesome quest. It made me travel to, and explore many places I would have never gone otherwise. It didn't require hours of camping or repetitive placeholder killing. It made sense from a roleplaying perspective. And best of all I was able to do the whole quest solo with the exception of Kedge Keep and the final battle. KK was frustrating but fun. It took careful planning and some creative tactics to get in there! The final battle was great! My guild loved killing that skeleton! 
Although we might argue that the spell it'self could have been better, I doubt there's a Paladin anywhere who didn't enjoy that quest. 

<p>Other good Paladin quests are Soulfire (good RPing), Shield of the Silent Watch (the lottery idea is fun!) and Fiery Defender 

<p>BAD Paladin quests are Fiery Avenger (dragon drop problems) Ro armor (faction issues) and Aegis of Life (long campfest) 

<p>Thank you, <br>

<p>A quest that I really enjoyed doing for the first time was the Nitrates Quest in Surefall/WK. Then the follow up quest for that one that leads back to Surefall, then all over Qeynos to complete. It was fun the way that the quests were interrelated to one another and you get a sense of these NPC's actually having some purpose in the game, besides just standing there.

<p>1. Story line. Where it doesn't sound just thrown together. It gives you a "feeling" that you are affecting the world around you or you are doing something for a purpose.

<p>2. Recognizable characters. This one I feel you should do more of. The high profile NPCs should give more quests. So when you talk to people about it or someone asks what you're doing, you say, "Oh I'm helping Dain get his old book." Using that as an example. It helps identifying with other NPCs in the game.

<p>3. Difficulty of completion. Don't make quests where people bottleneck on. Make them so certain parts and/or trade skills require you to go forward. Using the Coldain ring quest for example. I am currently working on the 9th ring. Hunting in Sirens Grotto for the (what I consider the hardest step) Runed Shell makes it so not everyone can obtain one and making the quest require high end trade skills with poison making and brewing. What makes this part enjoyable is not sitting in one spot camping for a quest bit. It is a test of skill, not of endurance and fighting off others from your "camp spot." A bad example of that is turning out to be the Scout in WW. Read the Safehouse for the gripes on that one.

<p>A good quest would involve: <br>
1. Cheese <br>
2. A wheelbarrow <br>
3. 7 bixies <br>
4. axle grease <br>
You should consider it.
</b>
<p>Wow! It's like you were in our last meeting! How did you know about that quest? 

<p>------

<p><b>In the time that I've played EQ, I'mve completed a number of different quests. The ones that I prefer the most seem to involve a bit of travel. One quest with traveling that sticks out in my mind is the first leg of the Bard Epic quest which involves running around the continent and ending up with an item that doesn't mean much to anyone but a bard I spent an evening with a friend and we did this quest and enjoyed every minute of it (neither of us being bards). Simillarly, the bard mail quest is great although I wish it were a bit more focused in the way of a goal at the end (if there ever is one). The faction and coin are nice but if worked on a little, it could be even better.

<p>In my mind, a quest is something that keeps you busy, entertains your imagination, and has a good outcome (not necisarrily a good reward). If part of a quest is traveling to find some specific person standing continents away and then turning around because the quest giver forgot to give you something, that's entertaining (slightly annoying) and keeps you busy.

<p>The bone talisman quest in Kerra Ridge kept me facinated for the longest time. Struggling to find the right component can be fun as well. As such, I think more quests where the identify spell MUST be used in some form would be a good thing.

<p>By no means are these the best quests in the game, they are some that were the most enjoyable for me though.

<p>------

<p>I'll try and keep this general.

<p>Things I like ...

<p>Random rewards add something to a quest, I think. It adds an extra level of excitement to the final step if you aren't sure what trinket you will be rewarded with. Wouldn't want them *all* to be random of course.

<p>Long quests with interesting rewards along the way (eg Shaman epic) are better than do a whole bunch of stuff before you see anything for it.

<p>Some things I don't like ...

<p>Quests with random rewards that includes the change to get nothing at all (eg relating to a brownie in Rivervale or a bug-collector nearby).

<p>Quests with undue amount of travel involved (couple of Ranger quests involving Lesser Faydark in this category). We aren't all dr00ds & wizzies. Any of the simpler quests that requires you to move between continents more than twice is a bit much, especially if theyre for melee based chars.

<p>Finally a suggestion ...

<p>I like the idea of quests that could be solved multiple ways. Maybe get some puzzle solving happening. eg Rather than kill mob A give dropped item B to NPC C, there might be an option to get mob A to give you item B if you performed tasks E-Z for him (sorry bout alphabet soup - hope you understand the suggestion!).

<p>There are a couple of EQ quests that come *close* to this, personally I would welcome less slaughter and more thought (some days anyway).

<p>Kaled DaVros – Innoruuk</b>

<p>These last two show a trend that I've seen. Some people really like a lot of travel in their quests, others don't. I just wanted to point that out, since I can't really post all 300+ messages…

<p>------

<p><b>I wanted to submit some feedback about what makes a great quest:

<p>1) "Bite sized chunks" - When a quest is broken up into small bite sized pieces, it makes it more fun to do the quest, because you can get the people you need together for about an hour or so and do just that one piece. The sense of accomplishment in achieving each piece helps keep people motived to continue.

<p>2) Different group sizes - Variety in the group size needed to do each piece the quest, assuming it is broken down as listed above. Some parts should be doable solo, some doable with 2 or 3, and some with a full group. For those particularly great rewards, multiple groups should be required, but it should be remembered that not everyone is part of an uber-guild, and this may limit involvement of casual players.

<p>3) "Interim Rewards" - Awarding fixed or random nice items when a certain milestone in the quest achieved is great. This is particularly nice when other people who are helping the quester can get the reward. (Example - Doing the ring quest for our wizard, we had to kill Warden Burke. Our shaman got a very nice Frost Giant femur during this, which was unexpected, and made him very happy. Now he's very willing to help others with their quests.)

<p>4) Lack of "Static Spawns" in the quest - Having quest items be random common or uncommon drops off certain TYPES of creatures really seems to work well. (Example - getting small pieces of velium from the orc miners in Crystal Caverns, or meat from tundra kodiaks) When this isn't done, you end up with people "camping" for quest pieces, and this gets boring. 

<p>One thing that I dont like about quests:

<p>5) "Foraging" - I have done 3 quests now that required a rare foraged item. In every case, I had to get our high level ranger to sit for up to 3 hours in a zone and click the forage button. This is certainly not an entertaining way to play Everquest. (A better way to do this is have the items be rare ground spawns like the yew leaves in Wakening Lands.)

<p>Anyway, that's my comments! Keep up the great work, we have really enjoyed some of these quests.

<p>------

<p>Kendrick makes a great quest. 

<p>No wait, the question was What? not Who? 

<p>All kidding aside... 

<p>Quests that start off as something you can get into alone, and develop into larger things as your progress. Players like to know what they are getting into before they decide to drag 23 of their friends into it. 

<p>Intermediate rewards that give small hints as to what is to come, or even text that maybe speaks of what you are questing for, basically to aid in my first point. No one wants to start a quest, take 24 people to kill 15 things, then find out that it isn't really something they want in the first place. If an NPC spoke about the reward in a fantasy type of way, that would elude to the nature of the item, without spoiling it, it would help things a great deal. 

<p>Quests that take dramatic turns further letting you choose who's side you are really on, a la Ragebringer/High Elf Mask. 

<p>Quests that require the use of the class they were designed for, or at least make the task completed much easier with the class the quest was designed for. A quest for a wizard item shouldn't have an encounter that is resistant to lure spells. I would go even as far to say that the encounter should be prone to lure spells. People like being an integral part of completing a quest designed for them. 

<p>Be creative with time sinks. Avoid artificial time sinks at all costs. 10 2 hour steps is infinitely better than 1 10 hour step. yes, not everyone can have everything, but they should not be punished for wanting to take the time out to accomplish something in smaller intervals. the ring/shawl quests have does this better than any. 

<p>There's a few to chew on, I'm tired, so forgive me for not being as thorough as I would like to be 8)

<p>Ok, so maybe Kendrick wrote that last one… 

<p>I'm sorry that I can't just post all of your responses. Some I couldn't post because they contained just a little too much information. I don't want this to be a spoiler thread. I tried to grab the more representative responses and post those.

<p>The fact that we already have over 300 responses makes it pretty clear that questing is something that interests you, and that you all have some pretty strong ideas about it. Some of your desires conflict, but that's ok because we can make several kinds of quests. For example there are quests that require a lot of travel and those that do not.

<p>The team is reading your comments, so keep them coming. I'll post more later this week.

<p>Thanks.
