Unfortunately, Friday's child wasn't exactly loving and giving to everybody.<p>Paladins are irate over an <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=16698.topic">unmentioned nerf</a> of their Lay on Hands ability that showed up Thursday and didn't get fixed on Friday. One poster seems to have a good idea what happened:<p><B>The formula for LH from levels 1-40 is (32L + 1) where L is your level. The formula for 41-60 USED to be (1281 + (76 *(L-40))). It looks like they broke the 41+ formula and we are ALL getting the 32L+1 formula. <p>The person who is 53 got a 1697 which happens to be 32 * 53 + 1. <br>The person who is 57 got a 1825 which happens to be 32 * 57 + 1. <br>A level 60 person would get 32*60+1 = 1921.</B><p>It seems highly unlikely that this change would be intentional, especially without a warning in the patch message. Then again, bards <I>did</I> have their ability to stack illusions taken away without so much as a word. Conspiracy theorists have found new cannon fodder, but paladins just want an explanation--and more importantly, their LoH ability returned to what it was.<p>Speaking of conspiracies, I'd like to know <B>why I lost seven hitpoints</B> after Thursday's patch. Sure, seven hitpoints doesn't sound like a lot once you're beyond level two, but I earned all seven of those hitpoints, damn it, and I want them back! Other players are reporting similar HP losses.<p>Is there a connection to the paladin issue? Maybe. Those missing hitpoints clearly indicate that some formula somewhere that has a part in calculating our total hitpoints was changed. Obviously the formula that calculates how much LoH should heal was also changed. One has to wonder how many other underlying formulae were modified. It might be that more subtle aftereffects won't be known until odd data starts to turn up in log parsing.<p>Well, <a href="http://pub105.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessage?topicID=15173.topic">at least bards were fixed</a>, right? Uh, no. Some of the bard issues were indeed corrected, but others still exist. The life of a musician clearly remains a challenging one.<p><BIG>Cornering the Market--Literally</BIG><p>EverQuest players around the world--well, outside the US, anyway--are <a href="http://forumsuk.ubi.com/messages/message_view-topic.asp?name=everquest_general&amp;id=zzzwr">very upset</a> about how the Planes of Power expansion is being distributed. Not only is the software slated to ship much later than the US release (December 13 as opposed to around October 22), but the word is that the version of PoP folks get will only work on localized servers.<p>To understand this, you need to know a bit of background. EverQuest is distributed in many places outside the US by <a href="http://www.ubi.com/US">Ubi Soft</a>. This makes sense, and is a common practice in the video game world. However, the SOE-Ubi Soft relationship is more complex than most. Not only is Ubi Soft distributing the game globally, they will also be hosting servers localized in many different countries and will be maintaining the customer service staff for them. So for instance, when <a href="http://www.ubi.com/UK/Articles/Everquest+-+Chinese+Market.htm">EQ goes to China</a> next year, it will be Ubi Soft, not Verant, running the machines.<p>Okay, that seems reasonable. In fact, hosting servers in non-English speaking countries allows Ubi Soft to hire native speakers of those languages and provide much better customer service than Verant ever could. Sounds like a win-win scenario, right?<p>Well, it would be, except that Ubi Soft has apparently come up with a new strategy. When it launches its localized servers in Europe soon, Ubi Soft will be selling something called <a href="http://www.eqloft.com/fullpost.php?languesite=uk&amp;id=1559">EverQuest Renaissance</a>, a version of EQ designed to work with those servers in order to provide non-English text support. And it makes sense that those localized servers would have specialized software needs.<p>However, the Planes of Power expansion that Ubi Soft ships will be designed to work <B>only</B> on localized servers. Why is this an issue? Because many, many players around the world have developed characters and built relationships on existing servers maintained by Verant. The localized version of Planes of Power will not work on these servers, and so players around the world will have to seek out the US version of the expansion--which isn't officially available for export due to the distribution agreement between SOE and Ubi Soft.<p>No one should be forced to move their characters or start new ones on a different server just to play an expansion. While most players will be able to rely on friends in the US to help them obtain copies of PoP, they shouldn't be forced into this position.<p>So is Ubi Soft doing all this just to lock their share of the EQ market and force non-US players to use their servers? Or is there some technical issue with the way foreign language support works that requires special versions of the EQ client and any game expansions? Not knowing how the code works, it's impossible for us to say. After all, Macintosh users will be in the same situation when they are able to buy EQ--they will be allowed to play solely on Mac-only servers. Of course, in theory there has to be some technical solution that would allow all players everywhere to exist on the same servers, but the only question is whether that solution would be at all economically feasible.<p>So far there is no official response from Ubi Soft on the matter, and poor GM Tartharon is taking all the heat in the thread on Ubi's boards. But clearly Ubi Soft needs to address the player base and offer an explanation for this decision, and should give serious thought to the idea of making the regular US release of PoP available to those customers who want to continue playing regular EQ on existing US servers.<p><BIG>In Case You Missed It</BIG><p>In a late addition to my last update, I just sort of tacked on a link to a <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showMessage?topicID=1047.topic">screenshot showing the Planar Advancement menu</a> for the paladin class. It seems genuine enough, so it's worth a second look.<p>Notice that the costs of Planar Power and Planar Durability are two and three points each, respectively. If you look back at the <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=234821473">list of PoP skills</a>, you'll see that PP lets you raise your stat caps by five points and is trainable twice per level from 61-65, while PD raises your maximum hitpoints by 5% and can be trained once per level. Hopefully the cost for each training point doesn't increase like current AA skills do, but even so that amounts to a minimum of 20 points to max PP and 15 points to max PD. Add in the amount of exp required to get the levels themselves, plus any additional skills that the player wants to buy, and people are facing a long road of exp camps ahead of them.<p>We better hope that Planes of Power offers a lot of good high-level exp spots in addition to raids, or else places like CT and Umbral Plains are going to overflow with more players than they already are.<p>And by the way, where is that long-promised raid experience?<p><BIG>Pink Hearts, Yellow Moons, Orange Stars...</BIG><p>A guildmate named Croco who still uses the old user interface was having a big problem with the new particle effects. He didn't have any way to turn them off via the Options window, and the /showspelleffects off command didn't work for him.<p>Finally he found a solution that I'll pass along to those of you with the same problem. In your eqclient.ini file, look for the line that reads:<p>SpellParticleOpacity=<p>Set the value to zero and you're set--the new particles won't appear in either interface.<p><BIG>Um... Okay, You Can Play for Free Now</BIG><p>A while back we reported that Asheron's Call 2 was entering beta, and subscribers to GameSpy's premium content would be allowed to sign up for it. That whole beta program lasted about a day before the plug was pulled.<p>Well, it seems that the AC2 team is back at it, and now GameSpy is letting you <a href="http://www.gamespydaily.com/news/fullstory.asp?id=4076">download the beta</a> again--this time without requiring you to be a subscriber.<p>We're glad GameSpy and Microsoft learned their lesson. After all, just because we pay to beta test Verant's software doesn't mean we're going to do the same for them.<p>Hey, did I just take a cheap shot at Verant? Well, it seems like the only way to close out a bleak week of bad patches and sour news all around. Hopefully we'll be back on the VAK bus next week. But once again, for the record:<p><B><I>I WANT MY MISSING HITPOINTS BACK!</I></B>
