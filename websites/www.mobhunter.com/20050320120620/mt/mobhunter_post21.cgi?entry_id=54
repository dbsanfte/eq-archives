<p>1? Huge yes.</p>

<p>3,5? Yes.</p>

<p>2,4? Given unlimited resources, sure, these would be nice. But the resources needed to do them are exactly the resources that need to be focused on #1.   </p>

<p>Nice suggestions, but I think the MMO market is starting to shift, and I'm hoping EQ will follow and effectively return to its roots. Groups in a MMO should happen while you play. You shouldn't have to group in order to play or advance.</p>

<p>If SOE can follow that mantra, people will return in droves. :)<br />

<p>I think there is a danger in focusing too much on solo play instead of finding more effective ways for people to find a group and go on a hunt. There needs to be ways to offer better grouping options instead of just caving in and offering better solo content.</p>

<p>Here's a question, what are people's reasons for soloing?  These are some that I know of off hand:</p>

<p>- I'm not sure when I will be logging off so I don't want to commit to a group.<br />
- I am going afk a lot because of a real life commitment.<br />
- I don't like the inconsistancy in groups, some are great and some suck.<br />
- I play at weird times or I don't play very often so pickup groups are my only option and I don't like pickup groups.</p>

<p>Some of these are pretty hard to work with, like the first and second, but the other two people just need to get over and go into the pickup group.</p>

<p>Dragons of Norrath supports pick up groups very well.  There is no commitment or dependency beyond completing the mission.  Every member gets crystals when they win.  The reward is given to everyone at the same time.  There is no random loot to distribute to people you don't know.</p>

<p>This is something other games could learn from, especially EQ2 (the only other MMOG I play regularly now).  Focusing too much on solo play will lead to 500,000 players in a big chat room playing their own single-player game.</p>

<p>These games are social by design and relying on other people is part of the strengh.  Focus too much on soloing and it becomes a problem.</p>

<p>I'll probably write a deep-thinking Caster's Realm article about this soon.</p>

<p>So here is an exercise:</p>

<p>1.  Come up with reasons that people solo.</p>

<p>2.  Think of ways that group content, design, or dynamics can change to work within that reason.</p>

<p>Here's a simple one to start:</p>

<p>Reason: People won't be online long enough to get a good group.</p>

<p>Grouping solution:  Offer faster methods to enter a group, have a useful hunt, and leave the group without guilt in under an hour.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by <a href="mailto&#58;solo&#64;yahoo&#46;com">solo</a> at March 19, 2005 10:26 AM</strong></p>
<p>" will lead to 500,000 players in a big chat room playing their own single-player game"</p>

<p>Forcing a player to group with 5 others to play a game just leads to 500,000 players in a big chat room with 6 people playing thier own game.</p>

<p>In the end ... not really much of a difference. Just an additional burden (and quite a large one) of finding 5 other people to play a game.</p>

<p>The "Solo" experience is so misunderstood. I am not sure why. Perhaps the we must have "grouping" people have some real life issues.</p>

<p>Just last night I logged on and was soloing in Western Plaguelands. A cry comes out from 2 players a Mage has ganked them and is camping thier corpse's. Well no one responds. Basically because the mage probably will move on in a few minutes. Why bother. </p>

<p>Well the Mage doesn't move on. So 4 additional Horde show up (who were all soloing ... doing thier thing) and make short work of the Mage. The players recover thier corpse's and everybody moves on. This is the experience the soloist desires. To "group" when they wish, to play the game when they wish. Its quite simple.</p>

<p>Constantly players will shout ... doing such and such quest ... looking for more. You group if you want ... you don't group if you don't want. Its a good thing.</p>

<p>It's a tough balancing act, this whole solo vs. group thing. Every game team has to address it, especially in the face of increased competition in the marketplace.</p>

<p><br />
Grouping is at the heart of this genre. People didn't play PnP or MUDs alone; they did it with friends, and that's what made them special. EverQuest grew out of a social experience: get together with a bunch of friends, fight big scary monsters, and become a hero.</p>

<p><br />
Developing right alongside MMOs has been the single-player adventure game. Heck, playing Ultima is what drew me to UO and then EQ in the first place. I came to feel that MMOs were a richer experience because I had to rely on other people to realize my full potential. I came to love raiding in a big guild, taking out legendary creatures fighting alongside my allies.</p>

<p><br />
But the genre has changed. Games like CoH and WoW have merged the MMO with the single-player (SPO?) experience. Whether or not you feel this is ultimately good for gaming, there's no denying it has been successful.</p>

<p><br />
So in the face of these new challenges and changes, every game team needs to take a look at its goals. Contrary to what some would think, guys wearing suits and dark sunglasses don't show up at the SOE offices to hand us mysterious mandates to rake in X amount of dollars this fiscal year. This kind of competition actually gives us a certain freedom, in that we are instead encouraged to do whatever we think will make the game better. And trust me, when you have a whole team of people who want to make a better game being cheered on by our bosses to do exactly that, the customer will be the ultimate winner.</p>

<p>Nice comments so far.</p>

<p>I can't really speak for all people who like to solo, because there are a  lot of different reasons for doing so.</p>

<p>What I always enjoyed about EQ was I could wander into a zone of my choosing and either begin killing npc's, or group up with others who are killing npc's. As EverQuest has grown in number of zones, and shrunk in number of players, it has become much more difficult to play this way. To me, this is a shame. Its fun to be able to log in and seek out adventure, grouping when possible and necessary, but being able to adventure and explore at your own pace as well.</p>

<p>LFG tools are nice, but they ruin both the freedom and immersion of playing a RPG-style game, in that you have to find a group before you decide where you really want to go.</p>

<p>The excercise for me is:</p>

<p>I want to log in and explore a zone or work on a quest. Maybe a DPoC (low level pet focus item) would be nice for my magician. Zone in to NRO. Oh, so sorry, no one goes to LDoN zones any more, no points for joo. Now I can sit around for a while, use LFG, send some tells, and beg a few people to come down and form enough of a group to get an adventure going. OR the game could be modified so people can work on what they want, when they want to work on it.</p>

<p>I think SOE has done very well in the past couple of expansions taking the focus off of raiding and putting some real advancement possibilities back in the game for single-group play. Previously, if you wanted to do really well in a group or solo environment, you had to raid to obtain the gear to do so. OoW and DoN have changed the game to allow players to advance their characters, for grouping, by grouping.</p>

<p>Now, I think they should start looking at ways to allow people who want to adventure solo, a means of advancing and improving their characters while soloing.</p>

<p>The example that WoW should provide is that its possible to have a game engineered to allow soloing to the highest level, to also allow grouping and raiding for those who want to pursue that path.</p>

<p>IIRC, the Evil Agenda's purpose was to help attract new players. To me, moving away from "forced grouping" is a very strong way to accomplish this. <br />

<p>PS. It should be noted, that despite my position as a vocal soloist, I have no singing ability what-so-ever.</p>

<p>I used to play a troll on prexus.  I played four years.  I went to fan fare.  I had fun. Just wanted say good by where I could post for free.<br />
I bought an Xbox and I am having fun.  I have been told by friends that Wow is fun.  I am not going to spend my money on an other MMopg again for a long while.  I think Verant had good ideals.<br />
You know the rank system in Halo 2 is neat. VOIP is good, in Halo 2.  If I play a game again NOT  A SONY game.  If I play a mmopg again it must have VOIP, IM and an active friends list. IF I ever play again it must be very peer to peer friendly with the Verant like company just giving an arcade like access to entertainment.<br />
Good bye all good people of Norrath.</p>

<p>I've heard this one before: playing WoW is completely anti-social since everyone can solo. Sounds like the same thing is said about EQ2.</p>

<p>Well, I can't speak for EQ2, but in WoW it's really up to you. You CAN solo from 1-60. But once you hit about level 20 (which doesn't take long) you can also spend all your time in groups. Just head for an instanced dungeon appropriate for your level. Yes, there might not always be a group waiting for you, but it's no worse than when I was playing EQ (and from what I hear a lot better than today).</p>

<p>In EQ, if I didn't have time to group, I wouldn't play. Period. In WoW I have a choice. I can play solo, and there is plenty of fun content I can enjoy. Or I can play in a group. Personally I enjoy groups more spend most of my time in them. But I appreciate the choice.</p>

<p>Now that does mean that there are people playing WoW who probably would have quit EQ. And some of them aren't much fun to be around when they do decide to group. I anticipate it will be less of an issue as all the MMORPG newbies hopefully learn what's expected of them. But I'm not willing to say grouping should be enforced just so we drive out the jerks more quickly.</p>

<p>So I heartily endorse making soloing viable in EQ. It's not going to be easy. And I'm not sure it ought to be a high priority--people play EQ today to group or raid and the top priority should be making groups and raids fun. But it's worth pursuing.</p>

<p>Why do people solo? Just like real life.</p>

<p>There are some times where I want to get a big group of friends together and do something big.</p>

<p>There are some times where I want to get a few friends together and just hang out.</p>

<p>There are some times where I just want to chill by myself.</p>

<p>Putting this into EQ context:</p>

<p>#1 is raiding<br />
#2 is grouping<br />
#3 is soloing</p>

<p>By nature I don't usually put much effort into meeting new people. I wouldn't say "antisocial", just not extroverted. In game, just like real life, I tend to chill with my friends, if they aren't on I hang out by myself. If I'm in a group with friends and some new people join in that's totally groovy, and at the end of it I might have a few more friends than I started with. The thought of *having* to find five more people that I don't know to hang out with for two hours isn't exactly desirable. I'd rather farm velium in Velks.</p>

<p>Which brings me to another reason to Solo -</p>

<p>My main is a smith. I'm at the point in my career where I need velium in insane quantities. At my level (60, with only marginal gear) the only place I seem to be able to solo effectively, get more velium *AND* get reasonable XP is Velks. Occasionally a guildie will come by and hang out there with me, but most of them are drawn to higher XP zones or places with better loot. Velks itself isn't very crowded, and the few people that ARE there are usually competing for the same stuff, so for me it works better to solo it.</p>

<p>I know I was dissing tradeskills a few months ago in EQ2, but the more I use the new system the more I realize what the designers were going for. There are a few aspects of it that truly annoy me, but one thing I really like is that farming basic tradeskill components never seems to require fighting grey (eq2's green equivalent) mobs (except for tailoring, where it's an *option* but not required - you can get pelts from "critter" nodes as well as mobs).</p>

<p>If (like what I'm doing) you keep your tradeskill level roughly comparable to your adventure level (I didn't like it to start, but now I think it's bloody brilliant having artisan levels) then the harvesting nodes are guarded by creatures of roughly your ability to fight (within a few levels of you).</p>

<p>If your tradeskill level is significantly lower than your adventurer level, you still have to be in grey mob zones to harvest but you don't have to kill endless streams of no-xp mobs - you just run around the zone, harvest to your hearts' content, and leave the mobs to the newbies that need something to kill because they won't attack you and you don't need to kill them.</p>

<p>If your tradeskill level is significantly higher than your adventurer level, you still don't have to kill mobs (who would undoubtably turn you into a bloody smear) although you have to be cautious about how and where you harvest.</p>

<p>Or you can buy raw materials from other PCs.</p>

<p>However you do it, it's extremely soloable. And if you keep your levels more even, you can group for XP and harvest on the side without driving all your friends/groupmates nuts.</p>

<p>That's the kind of options I wish we'd had in EQ1.</p>

<p>Soloing in EQ2 (maybe I'm not doing it right) sucks. XP is slow, it's somewhat monotonous. Grouping is WAY better. *BUT* - you *CAN* solo, and if you do, you *CAN* advance whilst soloing. In EQ1 any mob that was worth any XP at all in the higher levels would likely turn you into bits of goo (depending on your class, but I played a melee). Sometimes you're working on a quest and you have to kill a mob no one else cares about, sometimes you just have one of the other reasons to not group - so what? You can advance anyways. Grouping is definitely the preferred method, but at least you CAN play differently.</p>

<p>I think the coolest "solo" option (intended or not as a solo option) is that not all the quests involve killing. I play a ranger and god bless Hunt. I have several quests in my journal that are of the "find x in y" variety, where "x" is some object in the environment. I spent two hours in hunt mode exploring stormhold, only died once when something saw through my hunt, and basically had a groovy time using my class's abilities to solve a quest that would have required a ton of time and a full group to do the "conventional" way. More of that, please.</p>

<p>Give classes with stealth missions where they can USE it to avoid enemies, assassinate the bad guy and sneak out. Give healers missions where they have to actually - gasp - heal something. High wizard fizban is captured and unconscious deep in orc territory... take your druid, camo up, help the guy out and let HIM wipe out the orcs that captured him. Granted, not quite as cool as unleashing the slayage yourself, but at least you got to do the sneaking around and healing bits (and any idiot can chain cast nukes anyways).</p>

<p>Why is it that the original rogue epic can be done in three kills (supposedly they're the assassins?) and the druid epic has something like 17 major kills (not counting placeholders and things in the way)? The rogue epic is actually better done than most, since it has pickpocket and some sneaking components (if you do hate that way instead of the fighting) but the point is there.</p>

<p>Rescue missions would be teh cool if you could actually group with the NPC - find him, invite to group then evac. Not sexy in a normal manner of speaking, but it opens up an interesting tactic.</p>

<p>EQ2 doesn't QUITE have it down. But it seems like they've got the right IDEA, and maybe that'll turn into something. Here's hoping EQ1 gets the same clue - Not all missions NEED to involve the thwacky sticks.</p>

<p>As a last thing - I'd imagine that a lot of mmorpg players are also tabletop players so are probably familiar with what I'm about to say. Even if you're only an mmorpg player you still might.</p>

<p>For the tabletoppers - How many stories do you REALLY remember as being COOL (and therefore you relate to other, presumably equally geeky, gamers) that involved you being more uber than the bad dude and beating him down before he beat you down? I'm not talking an encounter where you had to do something cool to win, I'm talking a straight conventional dicerolling fight to the death.</p>

<p>My answer: none. Your mileage may vary, but I've never heard anyone say "I beat the f#$% out of that goblin. He was swinging for 5, I was swinging for 50, three rounds of dice and it was over".</p>

<p>The STORY is what's important to most people. The ability for a few measly seconds to simply be *cool*. I remember running terrified at level 1 through kithicor to try to make it from freeport to qeynos. I remember having bodies deep inside Kael, getting a sow and an invisy and hoping for the best as I ran in to drag my buddies' corpses out. I remember long raids in Kedge trying to make sure to watch out for AFKers losing EB. I remember hunting forever for my corpse in Blackburrow. I remember being seen in qeynos as a Dark Elf and having newbies go "wow... why aren't the guards killing you?? you must be a badass...". And of course I remember the first time I met people from my future Guild, Guild initiations, Guild weddings, and the recent disbanding of the Guild since everyone had left for EQ2.</p>

<p>Who gives a damn about the mobs? No one plays these games to roll dice and watch mobs die. That's what Quake and Halo are for.</p>

<p>EQ needs to get back to the story, the wow factor, the things that make players go "I remember this time when..."</p>

<p>I remember this time when EQ was fun. It was a while back, I'm hoping it happens again.</p>
