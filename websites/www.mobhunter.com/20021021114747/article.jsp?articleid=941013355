   <font class="ArticleText"><I>And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see. And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.</I> Revelation 6: 7-8<p>Four big changes. Some are saying it's the end of the world.<p>At first glance, you might agree. Four classes are due to receive significant changes in the October 16 patch that will alter their current and future gameplay. Changes that, according to the Dev Team, are necessary to restore balance to the game and make encounters in Planes of Power and future expansions more bearable.<p>So who's right?<p>You don't have to look very hard to find the public outcry. I'd link the threads for you, but you can't miss them if you go to any of the four affected class boards. People are threatening to quit or move to a different class over these changes. The names of every known Verant employee are being cursed, and Absor is being called a liar yet again.<p>But on the flip side, there is clearly a lot of support for these changes. Sure, it's easy to point out the smugness of Furor and the FoH squad saying &quot;I told you so,&quot; but it goes much deeper than that. Many players--both at the end game and nowhere near it--are seeing this virtual pressing of the reset button on four classes as something that was vital and necessary to the game.<p>So again, who's right?<p>The only way to decide for yourself is to clearly examine the issues as they relate both to the four affected classes and to the game as a whole. So let's look at these changes one by one.<p><I>1. The Change to Manaburn</I><p>Manaburn is a wizard AA skill that allows the caster to transfer all his existing mana into one hugely powerful blast about once every 2.5 hours. Damage from this skill can easily be 10K plus, often into the high teens or beyond with a critical hit. Wizards are supposed to be the ultimate short-term damage dealer, and this skill certainly delivers on that potential.<p>The problem that arose pretty quickly after the ability became common, of course, was that wizards started working together to wipe out old-world mobs that have a limit of 32K hitpoints. Suddenly Kunark dragons were being farmed for loot by a handful of manaburners, denying whole guilds access to epic pieces and natural game progression. What's more, a strong team of manaburners could take out Velious mobs like Sontalak, selling off keys to Sleeper's Tomb for the right price.<p>Even if you're part of the &quot;so what?&quot; crowd that doesn't care about such &quot;trivial&quot; mobs, the undeniable problem that manaburn created was that every boss-level encounter in the game had to be designed with the assumption that there would be a team of manaburning wizards on hand to do massive damage to the mob in a short period of time. Thus the target's hitpoints had to be made inexorably high to counteract the ability of manaburn to trivialize the encounter. This made encounters of 20-30 minutes or more the norm in Luclin, and it was looking like there was no way to avoid more of the same in Planes of Power.<p>So the decision was made to change manaburn such that it could no longer be chain cast on mobs. The one-minute delay before manaburn can be cast on a target again does nothing to alter the power of the individual wizard; it only changes the way wizards &quot;stack,&quot; if you will. Aside from requiring an organized attack order, this change would really have no impact on a guild with say five manaburn wizards fighting a mob that takes ten minutes to kill. Just have your wizards time their attacks and you're pretty much set.<p>True, the manaburn squads that relied upon lots of instant damage to kill a mob are basically done for. You won't find many players crying over their graves, however. This change to manaburn won't have a major impact on most guilds, unless they happen to have twenty manaburning wizards on board. Overall, it's a pretty fair compromise.<p><I>2. The Modification of Mod Rods</I><p>Rod of Mystical Transvergence is a level 56 magician spell that summons a three-charge rod that trades 300 hitpoints for 220 mana with each use. The intent was to minimize the time required for a caster to regain mana, and in that respect the spell was an undeniable success. Providing this excellent source of mana gave mages an unquestionably important role on raids, even if many of them complained and resented what they saw as a subservient role.<p>But a problem began to arise with the way mod rods were being used. Instead of something that was summoned once in a while to help out a fellow caster, the mod rod became a crutch. Teams of mages would chain summon stacks and stacks of mod rods, leaving them on the ground for clerics and wizards to gobble up like candy. Combine a mage, a cleric, and a shaman who can cast torpor, and you have--without exaggeration--virtually unlimited mana. Once again, encounters had to be designed around the assumption that a raid force would consist of a complete-heal rotation with access to a limitless supply of mod rods, and that became a large factor in the way mobs were tuned.<p>The new mod rods will be no-drop, will give 360 mana for 450 hitpoints, and will only be usable once per minute. This will dramatically slow down the rate at which casters can regen mana, and as such will require changes to several Luclin high-end encounters. This would likely include the Emperor in Ssra, Lord Seru, the Burrower in the Deep, the &quot;Ring of Vulak,&quot; and perhaps some others (it's unlikely that Avatar of War or other Velious encounters would change, since these mobs existed before this spell was put into the game).<p>While retuning existing mobs will be tricky and will no doubt involve some trial and error, the real benefit of this change will be that future encounters in Planes of Power and beyond won't need to include fights that amount to enormous snoozefests. I don't know of anyone who likes a half-hour fight with one mob, but clearly the future was going to be full of encounters that lasted even longer. A smaller mana pool will require shorter fights that depend more upon skill, which has long been the stated goal of the PoP developers. Let's hope they can pull that off, or this change will really be for naught.<p>There is another good reason for the mod rod change, though. This single summoned item had become more than just a crutch; it had essentially become a replacement for most high-end gear in the game. Sure, fifteen points of flowing thought were handy for a caster, but they were inconsequential next to the power of the mod rod. EverQuest's high end is designed as a series of progressing encounters. Meaning, you go from killing Naggy and Vox to Venril Sathir and Trakanon; then through Dain/Tormax/Yelinak; then through Sleeper's Tomb; then Temple of Veeshan, Tunare, and the AoW; then on to the bosses of Luclin and ultimately to Vex Thal. Mod rods were allowing guilds to skip the gearing-up phase of their development in such a way that they could bypass whole sections of that progression and jump ahead. The new limitations to mod rods will make mana pools and flowing thought <I>mean something</I> again, and that's a good thing for guilds who have put the time and effort into gearing up their members.<p>Will this change limit the effectiveness of some guilds? Almost certainly, at least for the ones that fit into the scenario described above. But what impact will it have on mages? Are they nerfed? Useless? Just low-grade wizards with pets?<p>Mages have long felt somewhat disenfranchised in the high-end game. Like necros, they resented being seen as nothing more than a source of mana for other classes. This change does impact the mage's ability to solo, and that is unfortunate. It doesn't, however, decrease the effectiveness of their damage-dealing abilities. While mages may not be as flashy as a wizard in terms of huge damage numbers, they are very effective in doing damage over time. Some mages are looking for some form of compensation for losing mod rods as they exist today, but their personal strengths aren't being affected at all, really. Out of the four changes, this one may be the hardest for many to swallow, but it just might be the one that saves the future of the game.<p><I>3. The Limit Placed on Complete Heal</I><p>Complete Healing is a level 39 cleric spell that has, since its inception, healed players just as the name implies. However, the reality is that CH has always had a cap of healing 10,000 hitpoints--it's just that nobody in the game currently has that many, so CH essentially healed any player to full.<p>However, it doesn't take a math wiz to figure out that the Planes of Power expansion will propel melee classes into new heights of hitpoints. While warriors with 10,000 hitpoints won't be common, they will exist, and 7,500 hitpoints won't be nearly as rare as it is today. If you were to take a tank with even 9,000 hitpoints and allow CH to heal for 10K max, that means that CH cycles could be stretched out to require fewer heals over the course of a fight, making high-end mobs that much easier. Once again, future encounters would have to be designed with that level of healing in mind.<p>The change to CH caps the spell at healing 7,500 hitpoints. In other words, it's not a nerf in the strictest sense, because the spell will continue to function every bit as well as it does today--and of course anyone with 7,500 hitpoints or less would never know the difference anyway. It's just that the spell won't grow to heal the maximum that some melee classes will be reaching in PoP, which is okay. The Dev Team message hints at new kinds of healing spells, but whether that means a true CH is in the works or not will remain to be seen. But of the four changes, I'd say this one feels the least like a nerf. More than anything, it freezes the healing aspect of the game--at least for a while.<p><I>4. Lowering Monk Defensive Abilities</I><p>The monk class has seen its share of ups and downs. Back before any expansions were released, monks had a fairly unique place in the food chain. Sure, their uber Fear armor was an 11AC tunic while warriors got a 35AC breastplate, but low-AC armor was made up for by having higher defensive skill caps. Plus, monks were the only class with Block, which is by far the most useful damage-avoidance skill. Then Ruins of Kunark came along and destroyed class balance completely by raising the skill caps of pure melee classes pretty much to maximum across the board. In terms of equipment, warriors got high AC Cobalt armor, and monks got... nothing. No Kunark class armor at all, apart from some low-level junk in Dalnir. Aside from the Fungi Tunic--which inexplicably had the highest AC of any monk-usable BP--monks didn't get much in Kunark that they could look at as their own. Thus began the standard of what I once referred to as &quot;the all/all monk.&quot; With relatively low damage output and a sudden dependence upon weapons, this was a dark time for the class.<p>When Velious rolled out, quest armors again established a relative balance, with most of the monk-only armor having much lower AC than plate or chain classes. However, Velious was chock full of low-weight and high-AC all/all items, particularly in the high-end game. Monks that made it through north ToV and killed mobs like the Avatar of War found themselves wearing 60AC pants and 45AC hats, with total armor class values rivaling that of any plate wearer. Luclin gear only compounded this trend, and ultimately monks were able to avoid punishment better than--and mitigate damage as well as--any plate class, aside from a defensive warrior. Monks became an excellent choice for taking rampage damage on raids and were a better option for experience groups than other melee classes.<p>The monk's defensive superiority, combined with high damage output, caused many in the warrior community to cry foul. Warriors are a one-trick pony, and their place in the universe was threatened by a new breed of monks with nearly 7,000 hitpoints at the very peak of the game. With Planes of Power skills and equipment that would boost monks to 8,000 hitpoints or more, suddenly the number of encounters that would absolutely require a warrior would begin to diminish.<p>Verant's answer is to change the way monk defensive abilities work. While not altering their equipment selection, monks will become more susceptible to taking damage. Unlike the hard numbers that were defined with the other changes, no specific percentages were provided by Verant, which of course makes monks nervous. Will it cripple the class's role as pullers? Will it make soloing impossible? Will exp groups shy away from monks in an effort to conserve precious mana? These are the questions that fill monks with dread. So while warriors rejoice, monks have no solid idea of what's coming.<p><I>Conclusion</I><p>We have yet to see how these four changes will affect the game when they go live. Knee-jerk reactions have been running rampant, and EQ message boards are filled with posts from players who are threatening to quit without even knowing how the change will affect their day-to-day playing.<p>Ultimately, all these changes are healthy for the game. They reduce the need for long encounters with high-hitpoint mobs, make game progression and equipment choice important, and restore some of the balance between the classes. There is definitely a cost involved--in this case, at the expense of four classes in particular. However, once players learn to adapt, the game will be healthier and more fun overall.<p>In simple terms, you win an encounter by having more hitpoints at the end than the mob does. When it comes right down to it, mana is what gives you hitpoints. Mod rods and 10,000 HP heals make obtaining and conserving mana trivial, and that's just not good for the game. Neither is a too-powerful melee class or nuking teams that incinerate content.<p>It's a shame that Verant didn't realize all this sooner. Let's hope that with Planes of Power and beyond, such lessons will be learned <B>before</B> players are once again forced to pay the price.</font>
