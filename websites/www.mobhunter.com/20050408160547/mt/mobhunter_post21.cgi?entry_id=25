<p>am very glad that you did this</p>

<p>not only does the site look nicer, but those crappy old adverts for Luclin spec graphic cards have gone....</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by <a href="mailto&#58;invisibill1&#64;yahoo&#46;com">bill</a> at July 31, 2004 10:00 PM</strong></p>
<p>The site looks much better like this, good job!</p>

<p>Much cleaner and makes the articles easier to read.</p>

<p>Although I do miss the PoP ad (it was one of those things you depend on to never change), this new layout is definitely cleaner and easier to read. =)</p>

<p>It's really nice looking, but if I might make some suggestions...</p>

<p>1. Definitely need to either make e-mail addresses optional, or obfuscate them in some way.  No one wants to be hit by spam harvesters.</p>

<p>2. On the main page, you might distinguish the author and date of the article a bit more (old Mobhunter is pretty easy to distinguish these).</p>

<p>3. Provide a link to browse older articles at the bottom?</p>

<p>That's all I can think of now.  Looks good though.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by <a href="mailto&#58;loral&#64;loralciriclight&#46;com">Loral</a> at August  1, 2004 12:44 AM</strong></p>
<p>I &lt;strong&gt;ed the author and dates.  I removed the requirement for an email address.  I'm not sure about the older articles yet, we'll have to see how it scales.  I wanted it as easy as possible to navigate.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by <a href="mailto&#58;joel&#64;joel&#46;com">Joel</a> at August  1, 2004 02:33 AM</strong></p>
<p>You should point the Beastlord link to the better board.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Brue at August  1, 2004 05:29 PM</strong></p>
<p>So there is no more logging in?</p>

<p>i'm trying to picture how anyone is going to follow the comments list when it gets really long like it has in the past.</p>

<p>http://www.mobhunter.com/article-messages.jsp?articleid=-1058382549</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Mahon at August  1, 2004 11:08 PM</strong></p>
<p>Yeah this way could make for a very very long page.  However I like the rest of the new format very well. Grats!</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Vikken at August  2, 2004 06:17 AM</strong></p>
<p>Very nice, I like the simple layout. Only one link column on the right makes the site look much more professional. It'd be cool if you added a popup for adding comments or a simple comment edit box at the bottom of the article, instead of a whole page like it is now.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by <a target="_blank" title="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=103260" href="http://mobhunter.com/mt/mobhunter_post21.cgi?__mode=red;id=15">Pomaikai</a> at August  2, 2004 10:21 AM</strong></p>
<p>So glad you got rid of having to log in.  I can't seem to remember my PW, and the email it to me function has been broken since I can't remember when.</p>

<p>The new layout is great, and it looks pretty simple to keep up with article replies.  There does need to be some sort of easy way to distinguish between posts.  Possibly alternating a light background highlight, or using a dark line between posts.  Just makes it easier to see where one post ends and the next begins.  Spell check would also be mighty handy as well...  Looks like a mighty good start to me!<br />
</p>

<p>Nice clean look, but as others have commented, alternating the background shade of posts would make it a bit easier to ready.</p>

<p>Also, with no 'threaded view', everything will become a large incoherent mess with a large amount of posts..<br />
</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by <a target="_blank" title="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=844132" href="http://mobhunter.com/mt/mobhunter_post21.cgi?__mode=red;id=17">Teremar</a> at August  2, 2004 01:27 PM</strong></p>
<p>I like the look, but I think the lack of threads is a major mistake. Many articles have had more than one conversation going at a time and the flat view will make them impossible to sort out.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Ryland at August  2, 2004 03:07 PM</strong></p>
<p>On the links section make it so when a user clicks on a link that it pops up a new browser window, so a user can keep the mobhunter page open without having to hit the back button to come back to the site.</p>

<p>"You should point the Beastlord link to the better board."</p>

<p>They are linking to the better board, beastlords.org.</p>

<p>BTW, the Cleric link returns 404.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by  at August  2, 2004 08:12 PM</strong></p>
<p>Looks good.  I like the new comments scheme but would it be possible to use a slightly different font/color for the 'Posted by'  line?<br />
</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by  at August  2, 2004 08:25 PM</strong></p>
<p>Whoops the comment above was meant for the page where I'm typing in this comment now.  It will make it easier to find posts that we want to quote.  On the main page the Posted By... is a different font and looks great.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Anonymous at August  3, 2004 06:32 AM</strong></p>
<p>Looks Great , however i would coniser keeping the old Mobhunter.com graphic with the mob in the scopes ,  it to me anyway was a great part of the site's charicter  and uniqueness .</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by <a href="mailto&#58;loral&#64;loralciriclight&#46;com">Loral</a> at August  3, 2004 10:08 AM</strong></p>
<p>I made a few changes recently:</p>

<p>- Due to popular demand, crosshair mobbo is back.  I added the logo back to the new version.</p>

<p>- I tweaked the comment page with strongs for posted-by and dates and moved the form up top.</p>

<p>- The comment form no longer requires an email.  We may move to a registration system if needed.</p>

<p>- The links now appear on both the homepage and on the article page.</p>

<p>- The non-playerauctions beastlord site is now linked.  I checked the cleric link and it looks ok.</p>

<p>Keep the feedback coming!</p>

<p>How are people supposed to fight with Coray in this comment format? :P</p>

<p>I like the new layout, very well done :)</p>

<p>Awesome! Up to date links! And is that a berserker link I see? Woot.</p>

<p>This looks great...however, from an look and feel perspective, as well as maybe a usability one, you might want to consider tucking the start of a comment right up next to the posted line, and then having a blank line between the end of the comment and the beginning of the next.  Might look a little cleaner that way.</p>

<p>Great work!</p>

<p>I like it a lot</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Wreak Havvoc at August  9, 2004 09:57 PM</strong></p>
<p>Much better :) less cluttered, i like it alot. </p>

<p>The comments could be flat but in a sorta tiered format, so people can follow discussions easily</p>
