<p>Wow - so many things broken that had to be fixed - why wait so long to fix so many things and let players play in a broken world????</p>

<p>And wizards get ignored yet again, what else is new?  Take that Rune of Zephyr and cram it where the sun on't shine, SOE!</p>

<p>Wizards... the SKs feel your pain...but don't care cuz we didn't get even an update to our Top Ten list.  You guys can cram the Runes up there...we're going to use Paladins.  Yea, fix the stuff that affects everyone... now pay attention to some the classes that have been beggin for help.</p>

<p>1. No mention of how SOE sees group roles, where they are envisioning each class fitting, and how they are broadly looking at making sure each class retains equal desirability to groups when they need someone to fill a role.  As mandatory as grouping is in EQ, this is seriously overdue at least in terms of a broad vision statement.</p>

<p>2. No mention of revamping older newbie content, of revitalizing the low level game in ways so people want to play through the low levels and not just grind to 65/70 or whatever.</p>

<p>3. No discussion of the impact of AAs (especially lots of AAs) in content design or how that should affect the "con" of mobs.  One encouner can be snooze easy for player_01, and imposible for player_02, by virtue of AAs at least in part.</p>

<p>4. No discussion of the impact of unconstrained-by-level gear on the low-level game and how it has seriously unbalanced it and left it a wasteland along with its overly static nature.</p>

<p>5. No discussion of removing the need to sit to gain the benefits of meditation so that casters and hybrids aren't so reliant on mounts and/or high levels of stacked mana regeneration to remain effective.  Such a change would allow groups to effectively "crawl" through zones.</p>

<p>6. No discussion of how or what kind of vision they have for revamping the exisitng and incredibly empty zones in the game.</p>

<p>Its good that bug fixes are going in, but bug fixes are not the big issue.  Bug fixes are nice but don't really matter much to the guy LFG at level 10 with no other newbies to group with.  </p>

<p>Given SOEs uncommunicative nature (my one real and serious criticism, the rest devolves from that) its hard to know if the team at EQ1 gets it or not.  I think the team at EQ2 does, at least in part, although in fairness it is too early to tell for sure how things will go.</p>

<p>Wow.  There haven't been this many bug fixes in an EQ1 patch in....well, in a really long time.</p>

<p>I am 100% in agreement with Katahn though.  Bug fixes are important, and work to resolve those issues should continue.  But after so long, the biggest problems facing the game aren't bugs, or stability.....but the impact that 5 years of expansions, power inflation, and item and feature adds without regard to any sort of player/encounter balance for previous content.</p>

<p>What EQ1 needs in order to stay competitive is a complete, top-to-bottom redesign.  Every zone, every spell, every mob, every quest, every item should be looked at, evaluated, rebalanced, and changed appropriately so that it all fits together properly into a smooth, compelling gameplay experience.  Too much of the game has been trivialized by the expansion process and flaws in the game's original design.  If they want to keep the game healthy, that's what needs to change most of all.</p>
