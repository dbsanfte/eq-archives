				<div class="entry">
					<p>On the whole, 2010 was a fantastic year for new music. A lot of my favorite bands released albums, and a whole crop of new artists showed up with awesome material.</p>
<p>It was a struggle for me to name a single Album of the Year; for the first time since I&#8217;ve been doing this feature, any entry in the &#8220;Gotta Have It&#8221; category could easily have earned the distinction. So please, consider every album in that group a required purchase.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s list comes with a brand new feature: an iTunes playlist showcasing some of my favorite tracks of the year. In addition to picking standout tracks, I tried to create a nice flow from one to another. Let me know what you think.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The <em>Cataclysm </em>trailer and news of the 4.0 patch lured me into resubscribing to WoW a couple days ago. After two lunch hours re-familiarizing myself with the game, I was actually enjoying myself and digging the interface improvements.</p>
<p>This morning, I received an email saying my Battle.net account password had been changed. After resetting the password and logging in, my characters were naked. A petition to a GM followed, and this evening I got mail that my items had been restored&#8211;though my account was now locked.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve added the iPhone authenticator to my account, and I probably have to wait until next week for my account to be unfrozen. So it goes.</p>
<p>Without the ability to log into WoW tonight as planned, I had time to ponder the lousy life of the account hacker. I tried to picture the poor sap who logged into my characters, only to find them wearing crap gear with very little gold to their names. I mean, I only have one level 80, and he&#8217;s got mediocre instance gear&#8211;maybe a piece or two of heroic anything. My next highest is a level 70 with raid gear from <em>Burning Crusade</em>. How demoralizing it must be working in a basement somewhere, having to strip characters like this of their pitiful equipment.</p>
<p>There is room in my heart for sympathy. So long as I get my account back soon, that is.

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The <a title="The scandal! The infamy!" href="http://ealouse.wordpress.com/2010/10/12/hello-world/" target="_blank">EA Louse blog</a> is all the rage these days, and I&#8217;m sure anyone who visits this site will have encountered many observations on its content already. I can neither confirm nor deny the author&#8217;s assertions, though of course over the years I&#8217;ve heard my share of stories about the dark secrets of various game projects. It&#8217;s a small industry, after all.</p>
<p>This phenomenon&#8211;disgruntled employees <a title="More scandal!" href="http://icefrogtruth.blogspot.com/2010/10/truth.html" target="_blank">venting anonymously</a> for all the world to see&#8211;is hardly new or unique. Any time an MMO or its developer hasn&#8217;t lived up to expectations, someone on the inside has leaked &#8220;the real story.&#8221; You can easily find similar posts by former employees of SOE, Sigil, Cryptic, Origin, and many other dev houses. And of course the fans and watchers of the industry pounce upon these posts and eagerly debate their merits, often with a hearty dose of &#8220;I told you so.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thing is, while there&#8217;s a certain amount of irresistible <em>schadenfreude</em> to be gleaned from these tales, one must keep in mind that they&#8217;re often written from a finite perspective. The average employee at a game development house is usually no more privy to the reasons behind the high-level decisions being made than employees in any other industry. There is no shortage of rumors and speculation&#8211;some more rooted in facts than others&#8211;but often enough bits of truth make their way into the mix to seem plausible and even likely.</p>
<p>Assuming that EA Louse believes everything he wrote to be the truth (which is a mighty big assumption to make, but let&#8217;s do so for the sake of argument), that does not mean that everything he wrote is <em>factual</em>. Another person on the same team may agree with some points and disagree with others; that doesn&#8217;t mean this person would be a lair, it just means that their experience and knowledge led them to a different perspective on what the truth is.</p>
<p>Again, I write this post neither to agree nor disagree with EA Louse&#8217;s post. Rather, I write to point out that everyone who posts on the Internet&#8211;me, you, EA Louse, <a title="A rebuttal from Kratos himself" href="http://criminalcrackdown.blogspot.com/2010/10/my-response-to-ea-louse.html" target="_blank">David Jaffe</a>, Perez Hilton, and any other goofball with a blog&#8211;does so from a certain perspective and with some kind of motivation or agenda. We mustn&#8217;t take for granted that truth is an absolute, even if it fills us with delight to believe so (there&#8217;s that old <em>schadenfreude</em> thing again). This is why honest post mortems are so difficult to come by; many of those involved are busy either covering their asses or looking to blame others for mistakes they themselves could have helped to avoid had they put the same degree of passion into fixing problems that they did complaining about them.</p>
<p>No doubt many other perspectives will be forthcoming in the days ahead (some have already been expressed in the copious comments section of the EA Louse blog), but no matter what is said, the objective facts of the situation will probably never be known to the public. Nor should they; even in our gossip-drenched culture, I hope we can collectively realize that it isn&#8217;t our right to know the details of what goes on behind a company&#8217;s closed doors any more than we&#8217;re entitled to know what Brad and Angelina ate for breakfast this morning. The Internet has done funny things to our perspective, to be sure.</p>
<p>That said&#8230; yeah, I got a kick out of reading it, too. I&#8217;m only human, after all.

					<p>I have not given up on blogging, despite all appearances to the contrary. It&#8217;s just that, well, I&#8217;ve been busy.</p>
<p>Lots of great stuff going on at work. As you may have heard, we announced our <a title="There shall be a... oh, you know" href="http://reckoningthegame.com/" target="_blank">first product</a> and have been talking about it at various shows. I know many of you are anxious for more news on the MMO, but our promotional efforts are focused on the RPG right now. All good things to those who wait.</p>
<p>If it counts for anything, I have started (or thought about starting) several articles over the past few months, but never finished writing them for one reason or another. So for your own amusement, please pretend that you read timely, thought-provoking, and highly entertaining posts on the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are used video game sales a blight upon the industry?</li>
<li>The subscription MMO isn&#8217;t going anywhere</li>
<li>&#8220;Truth, Lies, and Frogloks: A Cautionary Tale&#8221;</li>
<li>Please buy me an iPad</li>
</ul>
<p>That last one isn&#8217;t really an article; I&#8217;d just love for someone to buy me an iPad.</p>
<p>But honestly, you should really be grateful that you&#8217;re getting a break from my ramblings. You&#8217;ll probably be sick of me again soon enough.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I&#8217;ll be <a title="Damn, I am sexy" href="https://www.cmpevents.com/GDAU10/a.asp?option=G&amp;V=3&amp;id=610243" target="_blank">on a panel at GDC Online</a> next month talking about transmedia stories. Looking forward to it!

					<p>I&#8217;m sure by now you&#8217;ve heard about Blizzard&#8217;s RealID system, and have seen <a title="Lum provides all the links you need" href="http://brokentoys.org/2010/07/07/realid-scare-mongering-from-a-lot-of-people-with-funny-names/" target="_blank">many of the opinions against the upcoming change</a> to WoW&#8217;s forums.</p>
<p>I think the move is lousy too, for most of the same reasons others have stated. I think ultimately the change is dangerous, both to the customers and to the health of the community. And I say this as someone whose &#8220;real ID&#8221; has been a matter of public record for a number of years now.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s another aspect to this I&#8217;d like to talk about which I haven&#8217;t seen discussed so far.</p>
<p>My instinct is that this change will peel away yet another layer of the magic of MMOs: that of being able to pretend you&#8217;re someone else. Sure, anonymity can empower jerks to act like even bigger jerks, but the illusion of the avatar also does great things. It allows disabled gamers to ignore their physical limitations; it allows the meek to act with confidence; it allows the person with an average job and an average life to become a legend.</p>
<p>The danger of connecting MMOs too closely with real life is that it takes away the game&#8217;s function as a vehicle of escape, perhaps even limiting the potential of the game to inspire the imagination. That&#8217;s a heavy price to pay for cutting down on forum spam.</p>
<p>Of course the message boards are technically separate from the game itself, but they represent a big part of the MMO experience for a sizable number of players. That connection is being impacted by the RealID change, which means yet another aspect of the classic MMO experience is being lost&#8211;if you&#8217;re a WoW player, at least.</p>
<p>Now, let me pontificate to MMO developers for a minute.</p>
<p>From personal experience, I know that keeping a gaming forum as useful and troll-free as possible is a huge pain in the ass. Guess what? It&#8217;s also the price you pay for coming to the dance. I don&#8217;t care how big your community is or how many posts you have to moderate&#8211;hire the freaking staff to do the job right. I understand the motive of wanting to create a cleaner environment for your posters, but don&#8217;t take the positive experience away from the good folks in the name of shutting up the asshats.</p>
<p>There is a certain charm in the forum hero known only by a clever handle. The MMOs of tomorrow need to hold onto all the charm they can, not let it slip away&#8211;regardless of the motive.</p>

				<h2><a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=601" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Internalizing the Myth">Internalizing the Myth</a></h2>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>I spent the entire weekend angry that the new <em>Clash of the Titans</em> was so horrible. This was one of the seminal films of my youth, a tale that had nurtured my love for heroic fantasy, and it was utterly ruined by an almost unwatchable farce of a remake.</p>
<p>Monday at work I must have vented my frustration a half-dozen times. At one point, I even proclaimed that I would have been happy if only the film makers had reshot the original script and added updated special effects.</p>
<p>After fuming for a while, I realized I hadn&#8217;t seen the original film in many years. So over lunch I fired up Netflix and bounded over to my instant queue, where I had the old <em>Clash of the Titans</em> waiting for me.</p>
<p>By the time I was 30 minutes in, I realized how utterly wrong I had been. If the original script were shot today, moviegoers would laugh themselves out of the theater. It was bad. Really bad.</p>
<p>So why did I have such fond memories of this film from when I was a kid? While I&#8217;d like to think my tastes in film are more discerning now than when I was a boy, it couldn&#8217;t just be the ignorance of youth. Because despite the movie&#8217;s terrible dialogue and overwrought acting, I had one thing right: the movie told a really good story.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;d done was internalize the myth. I&#8217;d taken what was great and resonant about the story and hung onto it, discarding all the nonsense that sticks out like a sore thumb when watching the film today.</p>
<p>We do the same thing with so many aspects of life, including MMOs. Many of us look back on our days in Ultima Online, EverQuest, Asheron&#8217;s Call, and other early online games through the haze of selective memory. We internalize the myths that matter: the long camps that netted a coveted item, the fight to survive a Mistmoore train, your raid wiping and recovering in the wee hours of the morning. These tales are as vivid and vital today as they were when first experienced, and serve as the foundation for countless reminiscences with old friends.</p>
<p>But when I go back to EverQuest to check out the latest expansion or run through a familiar area, the game is virtually unplayable to me. The interface feels archaic, a huge impediment that actually gets in the way of my fun. Yet despite many evolutions over the years, it&#8217;s largely the exact same interface I spent countless hours interacting with.</p>
<p>Interfaces aren&#8217;t memorable. Dialogue and quests fade away.  The myths we internalize are rooted in the heroics of social interaction and the drama of emotional investment. If you can make a game&#8211;or movie, or book, or comic&#8211;with an experience that genuinely moves the audience, you can make something memorable. Because by doing so, you will have touched he myths that lie at the heart of all of us.

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Today I, as well as a throng of coworkers, descended upon the first incarnation of PAX East. Though there wasn&#8217;t an official 38 Studios presence (no booth or big announcements this year&#8211;sorry!), our execs were nice enough to give the team the day off to attend opening day of the festivities.</p>
<p>First off, it&#8217;s great to have a major fan-centric gaming event in Boston. The fact that the show sold out for all three days is a testament to how many rabid gamers we have on this side of the country. No question that a show like this was long overdue.</p>
<p>The organizers certainly seemed to have learned a lot from the original PAX in terms of keeping things running smoothly. Though the entrance was a massive choke point (more about this later), once inside things ran like clockwork. It was fast and easy to pick up my badge, and grabbing goodie bags and program guides was a snap. Most of the lower level is a maze-like queue that winds its way toward the second floor, but despite a crowd the line was flowing briskly.</p>
<p>There are some weak points I hope improve next time around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Need a better facility &#8211; The Hynes Convention Center is not a great venue. The entryway was a massive bottleneck compared to more modern facilities. The cement floors and drab walls gave off a prison vibe. It just wasn&#8217;t a pleasant place (although easy access to a decent food court is a plus).</li>
<li>Industry support felt tentative &#8211; The expo floor wasn&#8217;t exactly brimming with exciting booths. Local studio Turbine had a nice area, and a few others (like Realtime Worlds, who showed off APB) did as well. But overall it felt like many big-name publishers had little more than a token presence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps the show&#8217;s proximity to E3 precluded many companies from committing resources, or maybe they just wanted to see how the first year of the show went. Either way, I hope there is more of a big-name presence next year&#8211;and I hope it takes place in a location that better shows all that Boston has to offer.</p>
<p>Overall the arrival of PAX East is a huge boon to gamers and developers alike. I&#8217;m confident the show will be a huge success and will only get better in the years to come.

					<p>On Tuesday, March 23, I&#8217;ll be speaking at the <a title="i r a brainiac" href="http://conferences.computer.org/vr/2010/" target="_blank">IEEE Virtual Reality 2010 Conference</a>, taking place in nearby Waltham, MA. The panel is titled &#8220;<a title="so outclassed" href="http://conferences.computer.org/vr/2010/program/panels.html#des" target="_blank">Design for Experience?!</a>&#8221; and if you look at the list of speakers, I am clearly the dumbest guy in the room. I can only assume they had some quota of locals that needed to be filled.</p>
<p>My contribution has the uncharacteristically academic title &#8220;Memorable Experiences in Virtual Worlds.&#8221; Don&#8217;t worry&#8211;I&#8217;m not going all Raphtastic on ya. I&#8217;m building upon the basic premise of my talk with Owlchick last year at GDC Austin, where we asserted that the player&#8217;s stories are more compelling than those made by game designers.</p>
<p>Why does this fit a virtual reality conference? The panel is all about designing user experiences, and I submit that currently the most accessible form of virtual reality is found in massively multiplayer online games. Now I just have to convince the audience of that fact.

					<p>I began researching netbooks&#8211;small laptops aimed mostly at Web browsing&#8211;several months ago. I do a fair bit of traveling, and while I love my current machine, lugging the 17&#8243; beast through airports has never been what I would call a treat. Not to mention the fact that a large notebook is completely useless on a coach airliner. Thus, I used practicality as justification for spending some cash on a truly portable machine.</p>
<p>What follows is a non-scientific recap of what drove my purchase decision and how I ended up with the Alienware M11x. <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=588#more-588" class="more-link">Continue Reading &raquo;</a>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The hot industry trend is evangelizing social games. Many took up this habit fairly recently, playing catch-up at shows like DICE last week. The Kosters of the world have been atop their social soapboxes for years.</p>
<p>The aspect I find interesting is that a number of, shall we say, <em>developers of a certain age</em> (such as Richard Garriott) are moving from big-budget studios to the social realm.</p>
<p>In addition to smelling all the dollars in the water, I posit that there is another element at work here. The relative simplicity of web and mobile development is reminiscent in many ways of the first big era of console and home computer games. A few guys in a room can build a game from start to finish and make ridiculous money doing so. Old guys like Lord British find themselves back in their comfort zone.</p>
<p>You tend to see these folks in blogs and interviews touting statistics and trends which support their theories, which is only natural; developers tend to write and give presentations that promote their world view. This is why you have to study developer blogs with a watchful eye, because you should assume they will frame facts in a way that supports their assertions.</p>
<p>For example, I tend to write about big-budget MMOs because that&#8217;s the kind of game I enjoy working on and playing. I certainly enjoy playing Peggle, but I don&#8217;t see myself ever taking a job to design such a game. I&#8217;d probably end up making a version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_%28video_game%29">Breakout</a> where each brick spits out a quest when you hit it and you use your paddle to catch falling pieces of epic loot. In other words, I&#8217;d sink my career.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t begrudge anyone making or playing social games, though; it&#8217;s not my cup of tea, but I see no need to get snotty about it. I think social gaming is performing a valuable service to the industry by pressing a virtual reset button. While big-budget games and giant publishers continue to drive hardware evolution, ubiquitous platforms like Facebook and the iPhone will once again allow lean-and-mean development that proves you don&#8217;t need top-end graphics to make a fun game.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the more developers that jump on this trend, the more garbage consumers will be served. And, inevitably, social game development will balloon out of control and become just as muddy and expensive as the current generation of console games.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s okay&#8211;a new industry reset button will come along soon enough. Game design is, ultimately, about pattern recognition.
