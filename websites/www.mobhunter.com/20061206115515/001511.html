<h1 class="article_title">Everquest's Two Year Outlook</h1>
<p>by Loral on December 03, 2006</p>

<p>With the release of the Serpent's Spine behind us, now is the perfect time to step back and consider the possible future of Everquest. This article will attempt to predict what changes we will see in Everquest over the next two years.</p>

<p>Let us start with the easy ones.  SOE will likely release four expansions between now and December 2008. These will likely include both large expansions with lots of open content and smaller expansions with more focused instanced content. The release schedule will likely continue every six months.</p>

<p>Expansion releases will continue as long as SOE sees a profit from their development and release. Because the associated costs for distribution are so low, expect to see SOE continue to release expansions for download only. Retail boxes will likely focus exclusively on compilation packs and be released in early spring.</p>

<p>The fall 2008 expansion will likely include another level increase to level 80 including all of the associated spells and AAs. Expect to see a continuation of the spell system found in TSS in the future.</p>

<p>It would appear, based on this last year's release schedules, that SOE plans to push EQ2 to new players with retail boxes released during the holidays. EQ releases will focus on keeping existing players interested in continuing their subscriptions.</p>

<p>The Serpent's Spine was SOE's attempt to bring in new players into the game but, without a retail package, it is unlikely to have accomplished this goal. I would not expect to see another low-level expansion within the next two years.</p>

<p>Everquest's population will continue to fall. Without bringing in new players, old players, however much SOE attempts to either keep them or bing them back, will still leave and some will leave for good. The attrition will not happen in great numbers all at once. The fall will be slight and steady over a trend of bumps and dives as expansions are released.</p>

<p>Another server migration may occur later within the next two year period depending on how far the population dips.</p>

<p>Everquest will not end over the next two years. This is easily predicted as we watch SOE's support for Everquest Online Adventures - a game with a far smaller population. Throughout its life, SOE has never attempted to migrate EQOA players to another game, nor have they shut the game down. With a very small population of players, SOE continues to keep EQOA alive.</p>

<p>EQOA is our canary in the cave. We can watch it and see how long SOE is willing to keep a low population game alive. As long as it survives, EQ is more than safe.</p>

<p>Do not expect Everquest to make any radical changes to characters, combat, or any other aspect of the actual game outside of what we already understand. SOE learned what can happen when it makes radical changes to a game's core system with the combat changes in Star Wars Galaxies. There will be no class mergers, no removal of classes, no migrations of classes, and no huge change to combat.</p>

<p>SOE will not attempt to merge EQ with EQ2. This rumor seems to keep popping up but when one really considers what it would take, one understand that it just won't happen. There is no way to migrate EQ characters into EQ2. They are too far different and nothing would be gained in the process.</p>

<p>With Blizzard's recent announcement that it plans to focus raids at a maximum of 25 players and with Everquest 2 continuing to focus at no more than 26 players, Everquest clearly has the market cornered on large-scale 54 person raids. Expect SOE to continue to cultivate these large raid encounters over the next two years and likely indefinitely.</p>

<p>With EQ2 and WOW also including a lot of solo content, expect Everquest to continue focusing content around six-person groups. While more solo options may become available in small amounts, do not expect a drastic leap in solo content such as great improvements in solo ability or in solo instances. Solo content will likely focus around single-person quests.</p>

<p>I do not expect SOE to return to the days of heavily flagged content such as that found in Planes of Power or Gates of Discord. End-zones will continue to require some sort of quest, task, or series of raids to enter, but SOE understands how it segments their market to flag entire sets of zones as they did in the past. I do not expect them to make that mistake again.</p>

<p>Over the past two years, SOE has included some radical changes in Everquest's features. Monster missions and spirit shrouds were two of these features. I do not expect to see SOE stepping out that far again in the next two years. With a clear focus on keeping existing players and bringing back retired players, EQ will focus its content and features around those that made it successful over the past seven years.</p>

<p>Now for some wild predictions:</p>

<p>Sometime over the next two years, SOE will release a rebuild of Plane of Knowledge. They will finally accept that this is the most popular city in Norrath and will always continue to be so no matter how many rebuilds of Freeport or new cities of Crescent Reach they create. SOE will attempt to bring the culture of old cities to the neighborhoods of Knowledge.</p>

<p>SOE will look for ways to make it easier for low and mid-level players to reach the raiding game. This may include things such as new reward systems for pickup-raid friendly content or ways to increase player power more quickly than traditional hunting and grinding. With a clear focus on and market advantage of high-end raid content, SOE will look for ways to open up this strength to more players.</p>

<p>SOE will not attempt to reduce downtime any further than they have. With WOW cornering the market on short-term MMO gaming, EQ will continue to focus on gaming in two to four hour sessions.</p>

<p>SOE is unlikely to close the equipment gap between raiders and non-raiders although hopefully they will attempt to reduce this gap and make it easier to tune high-end content for both sets of players. More likely, however, SOE will try to show non-raiders the advantages of raiding and make it easier for them to join in.</p>

<p>And now my final prediction: SOE will return to Kunark! With the old popularity of this expansion, SOE will release a "Ruins of Kunark 2" expansion that takes us back into the world of the Iksar and the Ring of Scale. Whether this is a LDON-style expansion or a larger TSS style expansion, I couldn't say. Perhaps SOE will combine two sequals into one and create Lost Dugeons of Norrath 2: The Dungeons of Kunark.</p>

<p>So there are my predictions for the next two years. However it turns out, I look forward to seeing the future unfold.</p>

<p>I think that "more of the same" is probably a safe bet, & continued expansion of the game using an already existing zone but "revamped" to include access points to new zones, possibly using existing lore as a starting point.</p>

<p>I would love to see another "LDoN style" expansion & this might be what is needed in order for them to revisit the existing LDoN content, review it, revamp it, & have this & the newer expansion mesh in terms of updated points, task & experience systems.</p>

<p>I also hope to see more of the "hot zone" style revamps whereby they add new features, mobs, mechanics & itemisation to existing zones.</p>

<p>Itemisation in general needs a review, hugely time consuming so i wont hold my breath on that one.</p>

<p>Hmmmm....  the outlook on an influx of new players to EQ seems grim.  New players have been a rich source of recruits for family style guilds. Some stay in the family guilds others learn the ropes of eq and move on to raiding guilds.<br />
SOE trying to get us all raiding is well and good but without a radical change to raiding I am not sure how that will happen.  I would think that a lot of those who want to raid have taken that road by now.  If you have played for several years and havent been interested in heavy raiding before what will change that now?</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: <a href="mailto&#58;Corwyhn&#64;lionsoftheheart&#46;com">Corwyhn</a> on December  4, 2006 09:50 AM</strong></p>
<p>Hmmm... I see another problem here.  The game with the shrinking playerbase is the one staking out the raids with the largest player requirements.  Seems to me if you are the game whose player base is shrinking you may not want to invest your future in LARGE raids.</p>

<p>Some might thing the answer is consolidation of guilds.  This has been happening over and over. Why wont it continue.  Part of the problem is that EQ is a social game too.  In the old days guilds disolved because of poor leadership or lack of commitment to running a guild etc... these days it is just because their player base has faded away.  They eventually break up and join another guild but each time that happens it tears up the social side of the game.</p>

<p>I think one of the problems EQ faces is that the devs or those that call the shots are not able to picture all of the factors that make EQ what it is.</p>

<p>They dont seem interested in closing the raid/group gear gap partly becasue raiders feel they should have better gear. Now if that is because they think only those that did the work should get the gear thats one thing.  If they like to feel superior because they have better gear and that is why they raid then what happens when all that is left in the game is raiders?  Who are they going to be better then?</p>

<p>If SOE can't manage EQ what will give them the ability to manage EQ2?</p>

<p>Not crazy about warcraft, If Sigils game is successful I have no doubt the deal with soe to provide servers and customer support will change to full ownership.  That leaves me out there looking.  And I am coming to realize its not so much looking for a game as for the way the game will be managed by whatever company runs it.</p>

<p>If SOE is smart they will finally realize that for eq to continue to be a cash cow far into the future they need to keep a super healty group game as well as support their large raiding.  And large raiding needs something there for players who know their stuff BUT are just not interested in the type of raiding playstyle currently required.  Give us some easier just for fun raids that we can do to bring us closer to raid gear.  I really think we need three or four tiers concentrated on.  Solo game, Group game, easy raid game, dedicated raid game.</p>

<p>The easy raid game will be great for open raids and large family guild raids AND provide a transition to the dedicated raid game to some extent.  The easy raid game will also hopefully draw in a lot more group gamers which will help close the gear gap between the various groups. That will let group content be better tuned to everyone.</p>

<p>You aren't serious, are you?  </p>

<p>I cannot understand why SOE spent one cent redoing the old zones.  It certainly isn't a visual improvement and no one goes there in any case ... zero players and I mean ZERO.  </p>

<p>The one exception is Nek Forest (which was done not once, but twice and looks a little better) and even then, why did they bother?  It's an unused newbie zone with all the mystery & danger of good vs evil now gone from the game. </p>

<p>Let's have them spend the money on content.  NO ONE PLAYS A GAME BECAUSE IT LOOKS GOOD  if the content is boring or non existant.</p>

I do think the traditional step after a level cap increase is an Item point-system / instanced expansion. Hopefully that takes a step towards closing the gear gap a bit further, and the spell distribution system is continued in its happily open format.</p>

<p>Personally, long term I'd like to see a continued focus on introducing more 30 minute options into EQ. Finding a way to actually work PvP into the regular game would be a fun new wrinkle as well. EQ definitely has the instancing technology to handle this, its just a question of cutting through the hodgepoge of PvP code that's been cobbled together over the years.</p>

<p>One other thing to remember, if SOE isn't focused on drawing new players to EQ1, then they'll have to accept the fact that their current players will start to age, and have fewer long blocks of playtime available. If the goal is to keep the current subscribers entertained, then that will be a shift that needs to occur. Downtime isn't so much the issue, its going to be much more about how long various encounters are designed to last.<br />

<p>It was already mooted before the last expansion, that quests would be introduced that rewarded the player with some basic AA’s (run 3, defensive etc), I think we will see that appear, a further attempt by SoE, so they will claim to get new players in, but without a box sale version it will be half hearted, unless they push a compilation box set out the following spring.</p>

<p>Loral mentioned that SoE will try to get non raiders to jump to raiding. I disagree, as TSS even the ‘smaller’ encounters seem to be geared to 30, and the reward is one drop. I don’t think this is the way to go. A mob dropping one loot, should be geared more to 2-3 groups. Just the time taken to move 30-40 people, have all in place, the lost rezzed, buffed, the LD, waited for, just doesn’t make it worth it.<br />

I think the outlook is pretty on par.  Basically "don't expect anything really new" sums it up.</p>

<p>And that's as it should be.  EQ at this point is a legacy product in the same vein as Ultima Online, or Diablo 2.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: <a href="mailto&#58;Corwyhn&#64;lionsoftheheart&#46;com">Corwyhn</a> on December  5, 2006 07:56 AM</strong></p>
<p>As far as zone revamps go to some extent I agreet that they do not really do much for players AT LEAST AS THEY HAVE BEEN DONE IN THE PAST.  The way soe does zone revamps needs to change.  Zone revamps in general should re-level zones for a higher range including reitemization.  For city zones to be used again we need more high level zones close by.</p>

<p>Right now a lot of the old expansion zones are just dead leaves and branches on the EQ tree.  Some say leave them there they arent hurting anything.  But as they become more and more of the tree they are pulling it down.  Cut away some of the dead wood and let something new grow in its place.  Revamp zones but dont just revamp the graphics.  Give us storyline changes, higher level mobs and reitemization.</p>

<p>We need more zones at the higher end as the EQ population becomes older and more and more of us have a preponderane of very high level toons.   This in no way hurts any new players we might get because we have far more low level zones then needed. It could also be argued that with the tutorial available the real starting level is whatever the tutorial maxes out at.  Or we could just say level 10.  In effect level 10 becomes the new level 1.</p>

<p>SOE has to look at the reality of the situation. If they are not going to market aggressively for new players then zone revamps have to be more then making the zone pretty.  In essence they have to become new zones.  But the whole idea of using the revamps to advance storylines is so cool.   <br />

<p>Another bone I would like to throw out there for people to chew on a bit is player marketing of EQ.  If SOE doesn't seem to be marketing the game in such a way as to garner new players is there anything that we as players can do to get new people into the game?  Assuming we want that I guess.  For me, one thing new players bring to the game is that Christmas morning feeling.  Christmas isnt the same unless you have some little ones getting all excited about their presents.  Those of us that have been around a while do end up becoming a bit jaded.  Its nice to experience that awe and wonder even if its done vicariously through newbies. </p>

<p>I don't think that TSS was targetted at the right audience, it really did seem that a huge amount of work went into TSS & a lot of the background changes that accompnied it were all "groundwork" for a future push for "new" players.</p>

<p>TSS was aimed at former players.</p>

<p>I hope they now focus on getting new players, TSS did indeed bring some former players back...& in a large part caused some older players to just quit over its flagging system, I don't think it was as big a sucess as hoped for.</p>

<p>Next few expansions, & the direction of the company should try & focus on garnering a fresh audience, allowing them to progress up to a point, by themselves, then encouraging transition into the raiding game, by way of better designed group content, & having more "casual friendly" raiding scenarios, pitched somewhere between the hardest group content & raid content from a year or so ago, the time-gap between raid level gear & group/casual raiding gear, is something that will need tweaking of course, if they with to retain the usefulness of older raiding content, then lowering the difficulty/time required/amount of flags needed in order for casual raiders to access it should be considered.</p>

<p>skuz check this out: this is the time of ps3,360,Wii,wow, vanguard....etc....and you are a young potential gamer. so you do some reasearch on games. you get to eq. you check on some sites. you go to some chatrooms for more info.  and ask some current eq players about eq. potential noobie to mayhap be pwned by skuz one days asks" so why should i come to eq?" skuz replies " cause it has the most roxXorz end game raiding."potential says" well how do i get to the end game raiding so i can be 733t?" skuz says" well you will need level 75 and about 1000 aa atleast.you will need to find people to backflag you up to current content.your best bet is to get PL up with the level and aa and then guild hop for the back flagging.then apply to us and we may take you or we may not." potential" hmmm that sounds like alot of bs.i was just really wanting to play a video game and be entertained." skuz" roflz......you have no idea...errr i mean come on,its fun.i promise." so the potential new customer things to himself" hmmmmm on the one hand i can give up my life and try to get on this 733t old game eq! but on the other hand i can keep my life and just play some video games to have a little fun when i want to...." thats a tough decision. yeah eq will be back on the rise soon surely......</p>

<p>How to save EQ from itself? Simple ... harness the power of the Moss Snake. Yes the all powerful Moss Snake. </p>

<p>How can the Moss Snake accomplish this. Well the Moss Snake can do anything even save EQ. Just allow the Moss Snake access to all zones and dungeons (come on you know you want to).</p>

<p>Anytime a player kills a Moss Snake he will gain a level and a really nice piece of loot.<br />
A gain in level occurs up to the starting level of the latest expansion. When that level is reached then its back to the counting sand grains with a toothpick routine.</p>

<p>However the Moss Snake is not done with you yet. Continue to kill the Moss Snake and now you will get 1 AA point (and you still get a really nice piece of loot to boot).</p>

<p>Now a newbie can come into the game. Become an expert Moss Snake hunter. In no time at all he will be geared and leveled enough to actually enjoy a majority of EQ's content.</p>

<p>You can even have specialized Moss Snakes. Like a Moss_Snake_Tailor. Everytime you kill one of them you get a skill point in tailoring.</p>

<p>Fear the Moss Snake or it will kick you. (didn't they fix that, morons, best part of the game).</p>
