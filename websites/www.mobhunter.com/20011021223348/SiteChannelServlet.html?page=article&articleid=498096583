<I>[Editor's Note: The subject of the interview, &quot; Anon Beta Tester,&quot; requested his identity be withheld to avoid any possible repercussions from breaching the non-disclosure agreement that beta testers must sign. ABT has played EQ since the game's release, and has been through a variety of characters, including a level 60 shaman. ABT has extensive experience with the &quot;end game&quot; of EverQuest.]</I><p><B>Tann: Why the love affair with Camelot?  You've played it what, 5 days?  And you've already decided it's the next best thing?</B><p>Anon Beta Tester: It was just that much fun for me<br>Anon Beta Tester: I can be a master armor smith and be known for making good armor<br>Anon Beta Tester: That alone is enough for me really<br>Anon Beta Tester: that's fun<br>Anon Beta Tester: I don't need help<br>Anon Beta Tester: I can do it alone<p><B>Tann: You can be a master blacksmith in EQ.</B><p>ABT: Has zero value in EQ<br>ABT: I am a master Blacksmith<br>ABT: and its worthless<br>ABT: In DaoC the best armor in game is player made<br>ABT: not only that, I can save people money by selling it cheaper then stores<br>ABT: I like the combat<p><B>Tann: Camelot seems a lot more like UO than EQ, at least from what I've heard so far, would you agree with that?</B><p>ABT: Yes I would<br>ABT: I played UO for 2 years and loved it<br>ABT: but UO had some major issues<br>ABT: PKs being one<br>ABT: and a dev team that had their head up their ass<br>ABT: I like the diversity<br>ABT: You make a shaman<br>ABT: I make a shaman<br>ABT: At level 50 we could be totally different<br>ABT: That goes for any class<br>ABT: Your specialization choices determine what you end up like, but at the same time both characters will still be good<br>ABT: The people in your realm are your allies<br>ABT: You are not competing to fight that uber dragon like in EQ<p><B>Tann: It seems though the high end game is going to completely focus on PvP.  Once you reach 50, invading and defending realms will be your only choice.  There doesn't seem to be the uber mob.  And even if there was one, what would it matter?  Like you mentioned, player-made items are the best in game.</B><p>ABT: I don't want uber mobs<br>ABT: What could be more fun then being a champion of your realm?<p><B>Tann: But isn't that part of what created the sense of community in EQ?  Joining your friends and guildmates for a common goal?</B><p>ABT: The goal in EQ became tedious, when you MUST kill X mob to equip 60 other people<br>ABT: When killing an Uber mob becomes nothing more then camping<br>ABT: Take klandicar or sontalak<br>ABT: Once you get it down, you spend hours getting ready for a 5 min fight that will get 1 person 1 Sleeper's key<br>ABT: a key to another zone that will require more camping<br>ABT: In DAoC an 8-man group makes a difference<br>ABT: In EQ a single group is useless, unless you want to farm crap gear all day<p><B>Tann: The downtime in Camelot doesn't seem to exist (at least at early levels), and it can have a real effect on players that have limited playtime.  You won't spend 40 minutes of the 2 hours you have to play gaining mana.  Does it get progressively worse, or is it consistent?</B><p>ABT: With a shaman I found zero downtime, I'd say the most I ever sat down to regain mana was about 30 seconds<br>ABT: even at lvl 10 soloing I have almost no downtime at all<br>ABT: Grouped it can be different depending on how many healers you have<br>ABT: But again I'm talking having to rest for 30 seconds every 5 to 6 kills<br>ABT: with 2 shamans we never stopped fighting unless we died<br>ABT: My groups were 6 melee and 2 healers<br>ABT: Secondly healer class's can heal<br>ABT: not like EQ where the only good healer is a cleric<p><B>Tann: You can solo to level 50, but this has its drawbacks, too. I know I keep coming back to this sense of community feeling, but I think it's one of EQ's strongest features.  You came to trust and rely on people that you grouped with, partly because you needed them to succeed.  I don't see any compelling reason to group in Camelot.</B><p>ABT: I'd say the compelling reason is fun, while I can solo there are things I can't fight if not grouped. Some mobs are linked or call for help. I had some very fun large battles with the group I joined and they even sent me tells the next day to join up again. I think it offers paths for both the solo and the group person.<br>ABT: Besides with the group bonus there is no way you could level as fast solo<p><B>Tann: Do you see any reason for guilds to exist?  Guilds here seem like they too will follow the UO path.  They may be nice, will probably be used to collect dues to rent property, but they aren't needed for logistics for uber encounters.</B><p>ABT: Well the common goal of a realm is to defeat the other realms. I think it would be nice to know the best heroes of the realm are in your guild, or the best tradesman, armor smiths etc.<br>ABT: It's about recognition<br>ABT: In EQ that's done by guilds and loot<br>ABT: People become well know for their accomplishments<br>ABT: In DaoC I see it being no different, being guilded will have its advantages<p><B>Tann: But your not really defending your realm, are you?  Players can't actually enter an opposing realm. They simply get access to territory that is considered &quot;wild.&quot;</B><p>ABT: True, but its my understanding that later on there will be goals to achieve, and you will get realm points which at some point will be an advantage. I don't think anyone can really say for sure what will happen there.<br>ABT: I think each realm may get a territory of the PvP areas to protect<br>ABT: All speculation at this point<p><B>Tann: Address the realm issue.  You have three realms to choose from so when coming into the game, you're bound to lose friends because of the constraints imposed.  Players will either be forced to play a class they aren't really interested in to be with friends, or watch as that friendship dissolves because of the inability to communicate and the need to defend/invade that person's realm.</B><p>ABT: That's a choice you have to make, yes. Every realm has some variant of each class. I think enough to make anyone happy. If we are talking real life friends, yeah, this can be an issue, but I don't see it as such. My friends will become those I choose to play with. You could always choose to play the same realm as your friends on one server and play a different realm on another server<br>ABT: For all I know, none of my EQ gaming friends will even play DAoC, so Its not something I see as a problem<br>ABT: besides I want to beat the snot out of a few people I know from EQ =P<p><B>Tann: Comment on the graphics.  I wasn't really impressed.  NPCs and PCs seemed to have a washed-out look; there isn't the crispness/details of EQ.</B><p>ABT: I would disagree, personally I find the graphics much more realistic. In DAoC I felt as if I belonged in the land I was in.  Though I've only been in Hybernia once and much prefer the Norse realm of Midgard<p><B>Tann: Do you have skeletons there?</B><p>ABT: Yes at night in some places<br>ABT: Skeletons are not some of the best done I'd agree<br>ABT: I really like the trees<br>ABT: I always hated the EQ trees<p><B>Tann: Do you like the chat system?  I do like that they split the garbage from actual text messages, but sending and saying messages doesn't seem as unobtrusive as EQ.</B><p>ABT: The chat system still needs a little work, you cant send tells to people who are in the PvP area or the main city unless you are also in those locations<br>ABT: I do like the way chat is split though<br>ABT: you also can't tell if those people are online<br>ABT: So for example<br>ABT: If I'm in the main city making armor<br>ABT: and you logon<br>ABT: and try to do a /who on me<br>ABT: I won't show up if your not in the zone with me<br>ABT: I don't like that<br>ABT: Hopefully it will change<br>ABT: I love the spell bar<br>ABT: having so many spots for spells is nice<p><B>Tann: I like the fact that you can macro up to 64 spells, and don't have to pick and choose what you need to mem. But spell selection seems to be skimpy, there are 4 or 6 lines you can learn, and each line is basically an upgrade of the same spell.</B><p>ABT: Yes it's a more generalized format<br>ABT: You become more powerful and get stronger spells. But then think about how many spells EQ gives you and how many of them are useless<br>ABT: regardless of the name, most of my EQ spells are just upgrades of previous spells<p><B>Tann: Are there banks in game?</B><p>ABT: Not that I know of, but I have yet to see a reason for one<br>ABT: Money has no weight<p><B>Tann: You don't see a need to stock pile supplies or crafted gear you plan on selling?</B><p>ABT: Items are level based so there are way too many options to really carry stuff with you<br>ABT: You can only make stuff in town anyway<br>ABT: Or the main city I mean<p><B>Tann: So a level 50 player couldn't craft something for a level 5 player?</B><p>ABT: No, I can craft any level I want but I'd have to make something for his level<br>ABT: He wouldn't want my very best item<p><B>Tann: How do you determine what level the item you create will be?  Explain how crafting works.</B><p>ABT: ok well I'm not sure how it will work to sell to lower levels<br>ABT: When you buy an item you target it and it will be a color denoting if you should use it<br>ABT: typically orange is the highest color you will want to wear<br>ABT: I'd probably get to know what range items were in after a while from experience<br>ABT: or I could have the person check a vendor and I could make the equivalent<br>ABT: It will take a bit of skill and experience to perfect the method<br>ABT: Crafting in and of itself is much easier<br>ABT: In EQ you had to constantly combine single items<br>ABT: into many containers<br>ABT: In DAoC there are no containers<br>ABT: You must be at a forge and have it targeted but you don't place items into it<p><B>Tann: Do crafted items have information stamped on them?  The level of item, who created, how durable?</B><p>ABT: Yes, it has values, off the top of my head here armor has defense rating, absorption percentage, quality, and 2 other stats I cant remember, plus any magical enhancements it might have<br>ABT: Weapons have damage, speed, quality, durability, and condition<br>ABT: Every item has a condition that goes down over time<br>ABT: and durability goes down when an item is repaired<br>ABT: Eventually the item goes to zero and becomes worthless, but a smith can break an item down into useable metal<p><B>Tann: How are they magically enhanced?</B><p>ABT: You can go to an NPC enchanter and have it enhanced<br>ABT: supposedly a PC enchanter will have this ability as well<br>ABT: also later on we are supposed to be able to make magical items by using rare material we find out in the wild<br>ABT: My thoughts are like how ya need a blue diamond for resist jewelry<br>ABT: maybe something like that<br>ABT: But its too early to know<p><B>Tann: Do you think most crafts people will wind up defaulting to enchanters for ease then?</B><p>ABT: Well not all classes can be every tradeskill<br>ABT: how that will work out in final I don't know<br>ABT: But it's a possibility<br>ABT: I guess if an enchanter can be an armorsmith that would be a good choice<br>ABT: I think most enchantments will be via special materials<p><B>Tann: Has a system been put in place to sell crafted items, or is it going to be like EQ where you spam what you want to sell?</B><p>ABT: There is no system yet and broadcasts only work in your specific area, also they have said the broadcast channel is a beta tool and will not go into final. You are raising a valid point, how will people know who to buy from? But I also agree I don't want broadcasts--that's just annoying.<br>ABT: Right now if you go to the forge and ask, odds are someone will be able to make what you need<br>ABT: but I have no idea how it will be handled<br>ABT: Also<br>ABT: they have said tradeskills will not be 100% at release<br>ABT: They plan to have a team work full time on them after the release<br>ABT: and as much as Id like a full game when I start, I have yet to see an MMORPG that was fully implemented from day 1<p><B>Tann: Do you honestly think they'll make the October deadline for release?</B><p>ABT: I think so, because regardless of what they say, Christmas is coming up and missing that would be a financial mistake. However I have faith that if they really have major issues unresolved it will get postponed. Right now I think it will still get released on time<br>ABT: I mean it's 1 month away. if they knew it couldn't be done I would hope they would know this by now<p><B>Tann: I know Hybernia is bare bones, and only one realm has any dungeons.  Doesn't that suggest a lot of content needs to make it in?</B><p>ABT: Well it could, but who knows how they see it, if you can make Albion work right, could you just cut &amp; paste stuff into the other 2 realms? Is their a hidden internal beta we cant see? etc. The PR person said no date is set in stone and made no comment as to a on time or late release.<p><B>Tann: Is there any in-game help available?   A guide /GM staff of any kind at the moment?</B><p>ABT: you can type /appeal<br>ABT: but help is majorly limited in beta<br>ABT: and only works between certain hours<br>ABT: after release it will be 24/7<br>ABT: But remember this stuff is beta, and the specifics may change<p>
