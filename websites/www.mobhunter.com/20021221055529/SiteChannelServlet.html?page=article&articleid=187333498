Slow News Day went away today, leaving so much goo on the sidewalk that authorities couldn't even draw a chalk outline around the body. For background, you can read Eldin's ugly <a href="http://slownewsday.net/story.php?story=112">story</a> that signaled the final end, and Shepherd's <a href="http://slownewsday.net/story.php?story=113">reply</a>. That will get you pretty much up to date.<p>I spoke with Snowspinner, one of the writers from LtM/SND at length today, and I got his synopsis of what has been happening. Please note the source is <I>not</I> Eldin or Lum; if I spoke to one of them, I'm sure I'd get a slightly different  perspective. But Snowspinner seems to have little to gain by being disingenuous, so I'm passing this account on to you.<p>I'm not going to post everything I was told. Honestly, I don't want Mobhunter to be ground zero for a he said/she said fight between the parties involved. But because this is news that affects the EQ player community--significantly, I think--I'm going with this story. Any of the parties involved that wishes equal time to voice another viewpoint should feel free to <a href="mailto:moorgard@mobhunter.com">contact me</a>.<p>It's a tale of egos, hot tempers, mismanagement, and rash decisions. Lost in there somewhere is a lot of good writing and, I'm sure, some pretty nice people. Try to keep that in mind as you read this.<p>Here goes:<p><B>Basically, we initially lost the LtM domain name because of some bad stuff that made Lum decide he needed to distance himself from the site. Myschyf declined leadership of the site, and said that the money was all being donated to charity and the site was closing. Eldin stepped in and took conmmand of the site, and the posters all decided he should get the money. And so he did. Hence the birth of Slow News Day.</B><p>Myschyf stayed on as an occasional contributor, mostly to help the newer contributors out. This would turn out to be a bumpy road. Also, Eldin was supposed to change the backend of the SND site so that it didn't use Lum's code. He didn't.<p><B>Eldin hired a bunch of writers for SND. Poppin, Shepherd, Pika, Teirlap, Illisium, and re-hired me. Later, he added Firefly and Roark to the stable, and gave Soulflame updater status. A bunch of these writers royally pissed off some of the old school updaters like Arc and Mys, and for about a month these two kept bouncing on and off of the site. They'd be hired, fired, hired again, quit, hired again etc. Usually messily.</B><p>At this point in the story, enter Coke, a message board poster who had been banned from LtM but given a second chance at SND. He posted some negative comments about Tweety, Mythic's customer relations person, because Coke felt Tweety was slagging Fires of Heaven for not liking DAoC. Lum didn't like what Coke had written.<p><B>There was an uproar around Coke. Basically, Coke pissed Lum off big-time. And Lum asked Eldin to delete his board accounts. Eldin responded by banning Coke instead, figuring that would solve the problem. This wound up getting (erroneously) filtered around to some of us believing Eldin banned Coke on Lum's request, which wasn't what happened at all. Coke got unbanned, and Lum got pissed and deleted the grimoire, since he was the one who had written it. The grimoire being our news program.<p>About two minutes later, he put it back, realizing that this was a shitty thing to do, and just asked Eldin to change it and the forums to something he hadn't written, because he wanted to distance himself from the site. The other thing that pissed Lum off was that he found out that some admins had advocated interviewing Coke for the front page.<p>As this was happening, Eldin left for England. Mys asked Soulflame to be put in charge instead of her. He did this, but didn't tell anyone but Soulflame about it.<p>One night, Mys had dinner with Lum, and mentioned that Illisium was planning an &quot;expose&quot; on Mythic's customer service. Lum filtered this up to Mark Jacobs, who was pissed. Mostly, Mys was irritated at Illisium's lack of research in his stories, and the idea that he was going to do an &quot;expose&quot; into something that was already a matter of public record.<p>Jacobs got irritated at Illisium, and sent him a snippy e-mail. Illisium got really offended that stuff he had said over the admin listserv had been told to Mythic. Eventually it came out that Mys had done it. She would have been removed, except that she was already planning on quitting. She was only staying around because no one had told her Soulflame was in charge of the site instead of her. So Mys quit for good.<p>At pretty much the exact same time, Arc is researching a story about the decline of EA. Mr. Poppinfresh sent out an e-mail on the admin list asking if Arc minded if he did an update on Battletech's troubles. Arc said he would, but Poppin hadn't actually waited for a response. So Poppin shitcanned a week of research Arc had done. Arc blew up, and told Eldin that he would not work with Poppin anymore. Eldin said Poppin was staying, so Arc left for good as well.<p>Two days pass, and we hire Roark, who immediately updates with the update from hell. The thread from hell ensues, and degenerates into a flame war between Mythic, the site, and the former admins. The fact that Lum had demanded we change the backend of the site is made public, as are a couple of other things in here. It gets messy as all hell.<p>Roark was actually a poster called Mr. Galt, from an old gaming site The Corporation. Poppinfresh ran this site. Tweety also wrote for Corporation, which is where Roark knew her. Roark consciously and actively hid who he was from the other admins, Mark Jacobs, Tweety, and everyone else. Roark, it should also be noted, knows Lum, Mys, Tweety, and everyone else, as has Pop. They've both been down to DC and met them all. So there really was something to hide there.<p>Eventually, everyone calms down. Lum still wants us to change the backend, but he's not trying to kill the site anymore. Mys and Arc forgive Eldin, and Eldin does that graceful &quot;Upon Moving On&quot; update. All is peaceful for a few days.<p>Then Roark posts another update. Roark is quickly humiliated by posters who show him three or four Vault posts that addressed his problems with the update. He whines about how Tweety didn't answer his e-mail in a day, and posts part of a private e-mail Tweety had sent him a while back to the forums. Tweety gets pissed.<p>Eldin defends Roark on the forums. Then Mark Jacobs posts his &quot;I'm leaving SND and telling Mythic to stay away as well&quot; post. Eldin responds to it with the frontpage update you saw this morning. The posters turn against Eldin en masse, and tell him he's a cock. Shepherd posts to the front page telling Eldin he's a cock. Everyone pretty much agrees on this. Tweety and Lum mock the site on the forums.<p>Finally, Eldin pulls the plug and goes offline.<p>After this, we realized he hadn't deleted the whole site, and that the forums were still up. In the midst of people saying their goodbyes, Pander and Pyroraven started grief-banning. Pander banned me, ReturnedFire, and someone else, while PyroRaven banned DanSTC, and changed the subject in the #lummies IRC channel to &quot;PyroRaven has banned the Username 'DanSTC'. The Reason for this ban was: If the very last thing i do on these boards is ban you then so be it. AHHHHHHHH HAHAHAHAHAH&quot;. The grief-bans were overturned, and everyone's admin status was wiped, I'd assume by someone who accessed the base administrator account on the forums, i.e. Arc, Mys, or Lum. The forums lasted about an hour after that, it looks like, before they went down.<p>Basically, there was just a pileup of bad problems. Eldin hiring writers without experience, ego battles between Eldin and Mark Jacobs, Updaters being cutthroat towards another, overreactions all around, etc.</B><p>A long and sordid tale, to be sure. You now probably know more than you wanted to, unless you were a diehard who was there as it all went down.<p>As for the current status of the players in our little drama:<p>- Eldin is MIA.<p>- Arcadian has his own <a href="http://www.arcadiandelsol.com/">site</a>.<p>- GBob will have a site called <a href="http://www.player2player.net/">Player2Player</a>.<p>- Mys will have a site, but the URL is unknown at this time.<p>There will probably be more sites that spring up out of this, though whether any can capture the glory of the original Lum the Mad remains to be seen. We'll be watching.<p>Also possibly out of action is EQ'Lizer, which has been down for two days now. They've had ongoing financial woes, so we're hoping this is just a temporary glitch. If anyone knows any details, please let us know.
