<h2>Comments: The Focus and the Flip Flop</h2>

<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by first post at September  3, 2004 02:57 PM</strong></p>

<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Teremar at September  3, 2004 04:43 PM</strong></p>
<p>My #1 one concern is whether I'll be able to play in OoW. Reports are making me optimistic about this.</p>

<p>My #2 concern is, after playing in OoW, will there be any point in playing anywhere else? Obviously level 70 is the big problem, but this solution to focus items is another nail in the coffin.</p>

<p>Unless 66-70 are way different from 60-65, going from 60 to 70 will take far less time than gearing up to any significant degree. So by the time people start thinking about trying to get to VT or Time, they'll already be level 70, and the focus items they can get there will be less effective than what they can get in OoW, probably relatively easily. So for casters a major part of the motivation for going VT or Time is gone.</p>

<p>Now I miss good old Seb. I've outgrown it, but other people still pass through the stage where Seb is a great place to play. But if SOE isn't careful, no one will ever want to use the raid content of Luclin and possibly even PoP. Up-and-coming guilds will skip it completely.</p>

<p>EQ's big claim to fame compared to other MMORPGs is its vast content. But all that content doesn't do any good if SOE makes it pointless to use it.</p>

<p>wow I almost agree with Loral en toto</p>

<p>Teramar makes a good point. Many guilds made the leap to VT after 65 became the standard high level, and the items they got there were useful because SOE upped the level the focuses that dropped there affected spells. Making OOW with L70 as the new standard high level will invalidate a lot of old content that people who get L70 in OOW have probably never got to and would still like to. Especially Plane of Time. Many more guilds are going to be capable of making the jump to Time after they level up to 70 but if the gear there has focus effects on it that are essentially useless to them, why would they want to bother going? It seems short sighted to invalidate content that people might want to see for a large portion of said people. The melee in their guilds will still want to get time items for the effects they have but the casters aren't going to want much of it at all, other than ft items.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by <a href="mailto&#58;nope&#64;unhuh&#46;com">John Clark</a> at September  3, 2004 07:41 PM</strong></p>
<p>Why is it that a 45% focus that becomes a 22.5% is suddenly "useless".  Why would I skip Time to go to OOW, when the mobs in OOW are scaled for 70s as opposed to Time for 65s, and the focuses I get in OOW are only "slightly" better than the Time focuses after mitigation.</p>

<p>Does anyone actually know that OOW focuses are going to be 45%?  If they're smart, they'll make em 30%, so they're better than Time focuses after mitigation, but not much more so.  That gives them room for the next expansion.</p>

<p>People won't skip Time because of this (there's other reasons).  It'll still be part of the progression of guilds much like PoP still is, and even NToV (on CT, there's still 4-5 guilds on the NToV rotation).  Guilds will do things they're capable of, until they're capable of bigger things, that's what progression IS.  Time will be "easier" than OOW (hopefully), so people will gear up in it, then move on.  Will they skip Gates?  Possibly, but people skip other expansions too.  It's not the end of the world.  Heck, some people skip time to get to Gates now, since the focuses are the same or better and you can gear up from Elemental to get started in Gates.</p>

<p>Would have been so much better had SOE released the initial info that all focus IVs, etc. would stop working at 65, then caved in with the current system as "the compromise".  People just have to bitch.</p>

<p>Also, btw, it's vague in the way he says it, but these focus mitigations only affect spells of the higher levels, NOT all your spells once you hit that level.  Level 65 spells will still receive full effect of Focus IVs.  I know you mostly use your new spells at higher levels (if you can find them), but it was stated unclearly, and shouldn't have been.</p>

<p>The worst  thing about Velious is that it made Western Wastes and the Plane of Mischief so very had to get to.  The worst thing about Luclin is that it made The emperor and VT so very very hard to get to.  and The abominable thing about PoP is that it instituionalized that horrible error.  And the execrable thing about GoD is that it has continued the ridiculous practice.  Lower Guk and Chardok were NOT overloaded with level 20's or whatever wandering in in 1999 and 2000 and that was because they couldn't make it.  In much the same way that a large percentage of real life pioneers did not make it.</p>

<p>The idea we have been shown on "progression" is 95% of the content is for 5% of the players.  I do not believe this is due to maliciousness, but it is true.  Read some of the comments by irate teenagers saying "now that anyone can get to Plane of Time".  </p>

<p>Loral, I think your comments are probably more balanced than mine because my frustration is immense. And yes, I am cancelling a minimum of two of my accounts when OOW comes out.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by <a target="_blank" title="http://claws.guildportal.com" href="http://mobhunter.com/mt/mobhunter_post21.cgi?__mode=red;id=120">Talaen</a> at September  4, 2004 10:42 AM</strong></p>
<p>From everything I've been reading and hearing, I have to agree with Loral - it seems like Omens and Gates were released in backwards order.</p>

<p>Personally I like what I'm hearing about Omens.  I especially liked in the dev chat where someone compared it to Velious.  To me, Velious was a pretty fair split between open single-group content and keyed raid-level content when it released.  Sure, now, years later, a lot of that keyed content is single-group, but at the time you normally weren't hunting in Western Wastes or definitely not NToV with one group.</p>

<p>I'd say that when Velious released it was about a 50/50 split between single-group and raid content, and it seems like Omens is going to be even more focused on being accessible to single groups as well, more like an 80/20 split.</p>

<p>Anyway, my primary characters are all melees so I really can't comment on focus items.  But as I lead a guild and as that guild is working its way up the low end of the raid ladder, progression is something I can talk about.</p>

<p>I think Teremar has a valid concern - none of my guild members are elemental geared yet we already hunt in single groups in low-end Gates zones for exp and occasional drops.  We do this because they are more challenging and less crowded than the Planes and because we can pull it off even with no planar equipment in most cases.  In terms of raid progression, I think it's very possible that if we keep going up the ladder we will end up skipping Time and possibly even the Elementals, especially if the raid requirement for Omens drops down to something more manageable like 4-6 groups.  None of us really want to have to become a huge impersonal guild just to see things.  In fact, most of my guild members are burnouts from raiding guilds who really prefer a smaller, more tightly-knit group.  If I were an SOE producer, making my earlier content essentially obsolete is something I would be very concerned about, and I would have my live team looking at addressing the bad things about older zones so that they are still desirable once the new expansion has been out for a few months.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Teremar at September  4, 2004 01:30 PM</strong></p>
<p>I'm assuming that level 5 focus effects will be introduced a lot like the level 4 focus effects were. In other words, not all that hard to get. If they made them drop only in areas that required Time gear to survive, that would be different.</p>

<p>So suppose I get a piece of the OoW equivalent of Ceramic, or maybe Ornate, with an important level 5 focus effect (but lame stats). This has two effects:</p>

<p>1) I am now completely uninterested in the equivalent level 4 focus effect. In evaluating items I will completely ignore the focus effect and only look at the other stats.</p>

<p>2) I now cannot replace that item with anything pre-OoW without reducing my effectiveness. A few percentage points on a focus effect is more important to me as a caster than the best stats (which will only be a few percent of my total hp/mana anyway).</p>

<p>Worthless is relative--a level 4 focus effect is not worthless by itself, but it is if I have the same effect at level 5.</p>

<p>Ironically, making the level 5 effects available via tribute would probably help. Yes, that makes the level 4 effects "worthless" immediately. But it also means I can replace an entry-level OoW focus effect item with something from Time without losing effectiveness.</p>

<p>while it may be true that the path of progression will be OoW->GoD at some point, i imagine that when the highest end OoW zones come out those will be the very top of the end-game.  so if the content progression is actually :<br />
PoP -> Mid-OoW -> GoD -> End-OoW</p>

<p>then the question of whether level 5 foci ruins gear progression is whether people will be getting level 5 foci in Mid-OoW content that has a high percentage (not just L5 foci at all, but premium percentage versions) than that in GoD.  my feeling is that they will not be getting Foci at the part of OoW that is pre-GoD that has the same percentages as they will get in GoD endgame, therefore endgame GoD gear will still be more desirable than midgame OoW gear.  i'm basing this on the fact that you do not get foci equivalent to VT in mid PoP, or any LDoN, or early GoD.  you typically have to have moved three or more expansions down the road to have midgame gear in new content outstrip endgame gear in old content other than a few exceptional pieces (e.g. LDoN augmentable weapons and one or two pieces of ornate per set).</p>

<p>Just as pointless as first post. (see above)</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by svenalo at September  5, 2004 08:28 PM</strong></p>
<p>The real problem with this is that it makes all the nukes and whatnot not worth getting if you have the 45% focii from GoD (and probably even the 40% ones) and the nukes from level 65. Why? Take the level 68 mage nuke Blade Strike which does 100 or so more dmg for 10 more mana than the Rock of Taelosia spell (its the upgrade). Which Rock I will get full mana reduction, full damage focus...if I go for the new spell I will do less damage at the cost of more mana overall. Who in their right mind would use the new spell? And just about every one is the same kind of thing...</p>

<p>They should cap all focus effects at level 65, all of them, including OoW focuses.  At level 70, everything works at 50%.</p>

<p>Then you do increasingly-difficult quests in OOW to increase the maximum level of the focus.  Maybe six hours running around doing small errands to bump it up to 66, you have to kill a near-endgame godlike mob to get it up to 70.  This would compel the GoD-equipped folks to venture into OoW, but they won't have to destroy all their hard-won GoD/Time gear.</p>

<p>This was the last straw for me.</p>

<p>The 6 accounts I paid for were cancelled 8/30/2004 and I do not plan to return to EQ if Level IV Foci items and tribute don't work until level 70.</p>

<p>Sadly, I'm all out of steam and patience and hope.</p>

<p>Good Luck, Flip Floppers everywhere.</p>

<p>I to am canceling my entire eq live.  My entire family play's and we are very tired of expantion after expantion after expantion.  We have been playing for 4.5 years and we are sick of the way to difficult progression.  I feel they have killed the fun from eq when you port around without druids and wizzards.  Then make the zones so difficult to get keyed or flagged that you need 50 peeps to bumrush the mobs.  Sick is what it is and all 6 accounts will be done as soon as I hit post here.  I also have watched many friends quit for similar reasons.  Sony has actualy pushed me away from the On-line gaming scene.  Bye all enjoy the new expansion hope it works out for you all.</p>

<p>You and your entire family played a single game for 4.5 years and you think the company did a BAD job?  I can't imagine how long you'd play if they were good at it.</p>

<p>Providing 5 years of progression that meets everyone's idea of "hard" or easy" is no small task.</p>

<p>No, Because sony made most of the worth having gear in the game No Drop.</p>

<p>=( My account is canceled as well, but mainly because I quit a high end guild and now I have nothing to do, since I cannot progress in gear or zones on my own past this point.</p>

<p>Time, KT access. Full Time/Elem gear. Icon of the Alter. Now i can't go further, nor can I even find upgrades to my gear. I've gotten all of the AA's that are "needed" for my class (bit less than 300AA). There is no room in EQ for people like me, that Quit the high end and try to mesh in the lower tier. Had a lot of fun soloing BoT as a cleric melee style, or doing everything up to Elem as the main tank... but that didnt' last a whole lot of time.</p>

<p>High end focus effects were changed on Lucy to affect spells above level 65 without losing effectiveness.  Time foci now work normally on spells up to level 67.  Discordant (from Muramite armor) works on spells up to level 68.  I also heard that the reduction in effectiveness was changed to 5% per level, down from 10%.  I have no way to verify that, as I can't interpret that deep in the spell data.</p>

<p>Still, the bump is heartening for those of us who burned a lot of DKP on GoD items only to learn that they were going to be useless.  Now, my 45% damage focus will work on spells up to level 68, and even level 70 spells will receive 40.5%.</p>

<p>For those who will say "But what about those of us without access to Time/GoD focuses?" -- well, the same thing happened when poP came out, but worse.  Those of us without VT access saw our focuses become totally useless.  I used level 60 spells for ages after PoP came out because I didn't have the focuses.   At least this time your old focus items will still work, instead of totally conking out like they did in PoP.</p>

<p>Unless there are single-group items in Omens to help bridge the gap, this only creates a larger gap between raiding and non-raiding 65s.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, my houshold is split on this issue.  We are not elementally equipped but just grinding to level 70 my cause some accounts to be cancelled.  </p>

<p>My opinion on the focus effect issue is that I think that there are a lot of people out there that don't have these items and so don't see the issue with the scaling.  I personally am worried about my 8th shawl more than anything else.  It is the only item that I own (with a special effect) that could be affected.  </p>

<p>I have all the level 4 focus effects.  If I have to find the Level 5 ones to use my new spells then so be it.  IMHO SOE's job is to make new content interesting and challenging, not easy.  SOE's job is to make cooler gear.  Sometimes this means making older gear obsolete, no matter how difficult is was to get initially.</p>

<p>Anyway just my 2 cents.</p>

<p>Orwell is good. However, I would have gone for a variation of the Sugarhill Gang:</p>

<p>I think I'd be less upset about the focus effects if not for the fact that half my blasted focus items that are now semi-useful are no drop.  This means those ornate silk boots I spent 18k on will now be outdated, but impossible to sell to recoup some of the money spent.  The cool ranged item from the KoS raid is going to be one more thing rotting in the bank eventually.  If any of the new focuses are droppable, I think we can assume the prices are going to be far beyond what a lot of players can afford for a few years at least.  I'm not whining (I hope), it's just a bit depressing seeing 6 months of work go down the drain.  Going from a decently geared casual to a pathetic substitute for a high end caster is going to sting.  My stuff, for those who care (or are bored) ;)  http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=905161</p>

<p>Official flip flop:</p>

<p>Rytan - The scaling of the focus effects past 65 will effect all of the existing foci, although generally the higher end focus items have a higher max level then the lower tier focus effects. Generally the Elemental and time foci are capped at level 67, and the high end gates foci are capped at level 68. </p>

<p>So Elemental, Time, and GoD effects get a higher cap than normal focus 4 items.  Depending on the gear that we see in Omens this could either be good or bad.  Only time will tell.</p>
