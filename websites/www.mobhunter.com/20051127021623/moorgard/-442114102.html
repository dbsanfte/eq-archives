I mean, I think they totally just changed the logo or something and straight out pirated that game. and so I say &quot;way to copy Zelda, you dicks!&quot; they got all nervous and freaked out with the denials. but I was like &quot;hahahahaha U R so busted!&quot; and I laughed my ass off for like five minutes. god that was funny!<p>so after I /pwned the EQOR (EQ Online Ripoff) team, the regular EQ guys came in. leading the way was Smed himself, and he saw me and was like &quot;hey who let him in here?&quot; and he started yelling at the nice PR lady that had invited me, so I was all up in his face and was like &quot;yo, back off, dude, or I will PvP you!&quot; that freaked Smed out and he screamed out &quot;Rich, help me dammit!&quot; now this is when it got scary.<p>in comes this massive dude, looking all like the ogres in Tactics and shit, and it turns out this is Rich Waters. so I'm all like &quot;no way, don't touch me, I will evade you!&quot; and he chases me a while, but I'm glad to say he got tired out cuz I move like a ninja and he does not.<p>so I'm feeling pretty good about myself when all of a sudden somebody hurls a keyboard at me and it hits me upside the head, which makes me go &quot;hey WTF????&quot; and I see this crazy old man in the corner start cackling, and he's like &quot;hahaha! up yours Moorgard, that's for dissing armor dyes!&quot; and I was like &quot;ABSOR YOU DICK!&quot; but that damn keyboard hurt my head so I couldn't chase after him just then. I still plan to teach him a lesson tho.<p>anyway then Scott Hartsman comes in and is like &quot;so do you have questions, mr. mobhunter guy?&quot; and I'm all like &quot;hell yeah I got questions. how about this one: WHEN ARE YOU GONNA FIX THE GODDAM GAME????&quot; and he was like &quot;bahaha, it's as fixed as you'll ever see it.&quot; and I'm like &quot;dude, that is so wrong! what about us monks that you screwed over?&quot; and he's like &quot;dude, that's the first class we finally got right! well second I guess, cuz we got necros almost where we want em again after another nerf or two.&quot; that really pissed me off, and I said &quot;Scott Hartsman, you are a DICK!&quot; and he was all like &quot;whatever, l4m3r, u truly suck.&quot; what sucks is that I couldn't come up with a good response for that.<p>meanwhile some gomer is snapping pictures and talking all kinds of shit, and I was like &quot;dude what is your deal?&quot; And he was like &quot;I am Nathan Pearce the web guy, and I want to show the world how you just got /pwned.&quot; and I was all like &quot;dude, you and I both know that all those hidden links in your newsletters are just there on accident&quot; and he got all quiet and shit, which means I was right. as if there's any doubt about that.<p>so then the door opens and all those guys start cowering in the corner, and I'm all like &quot;uh oh WTF?&quot; this dude with crazy hair comes in and starts freaking out at me, and he's all &quot;what the bloody hell do you think you're doing?&quot; and I was like &quot;OMG who are you?&quot; and he was all &quot;I am Rod Humble, guv-nah&quot; and I was like &quot;OMG U R FRENCH! no wonder spawn times are so messed up!&quot; which explains a lot, cuz this euro dude is out to get us hard working americans.<p>so anyway, here's a summary of what I found out this weekend:<p>eqoa = lame<br>eq = lame<br>swg = gonna be lame<br>eq2 = gonna be hella lame<br>planetside = the /pwn cuz I can PvP ur aZZ<p>as my final act of rebellion I stole a package of copy paper on my way out, cuz ain't no way I'm letting those dicks get away with taking my $13 a month without anything to show for it. the whole weekend confirms what I said all along, that SOE just stands for SCREW OUR ENDUSERS, or something close to that. (sorry, I thought of a kewler one last night but I got wasted and forgot it.)<p>anyway that's what happened to me while I got you the REAL TRUTH about what goes on at SOE. I'm pretty sure I caught a glimpse of Brad McQuaid chained up in a little cell there, but the cops didn't believe me when I told them. sorry, Brad, I tried. peace.
