   <font class="ArticleText"><BIG>Class Balance?</BIG><p>This of course has been an issue since day one and it's a<br>complicated one, more than most people seem to understand. A lot of people simplify things to such a degree or try to relate apples and oranges, such as one classes solo abilities versus another classes grouping abilities.<p>One of the biggest issues is that it is virtually impossible to tell when classes are really in balance. You can process the pure numbers of classes in different situations, but it's still not a perfect indicator and there are a lot of things that are subjective to the people in charge. In essence, players will complain regardless of the reality of things.<br> <br>For awhile now, the pure melee types have all been up in arms about balance. Each of them of course has extremely varied opinions on what is wrong with themselves and others, but I'm going to use warriors as a reference to illustrate some points about how balance should or shouldn't be achieved, prior to us going into the subject of what should be changed.<p>A common warrior complaint is that over time, there has been a major reduction in the number of warrior specific items compared to items that are usable by all of the plate classes. In essence, at any given level the equipment available to a warrior is virtually the same as the equipment available to a paladin, shadowknight or even a bard. <p>There is a reason for this, and it's a good solid one. It is that it removes a variable from the balance equation. To simplify things far more than they are if you had two factors, class abilities and class equipment, you would have to balance out both whereas if you remove equipment from the equation, you are left with one aspect of balance.<p>Further, unless you really go off on itemization you end up in a situation where class balance is based on the items people may, or may not have. This also applies to a lot of possible AA skill solutions since it creates a situation that almost creates two sub classes, those who have AA skill x, and those who don't.<p>Of course it should go without saying that equipment on the broader scale does affect balance a lot.<p>Another equipment related complaint recently is that because so many things are used by so many classes, the pure melees as the only people without a useful mana pool get less use out of each item comparitively. For example, if an item is plate classes only and has 50 hitpoints and mana, a warrior only gains the 50 hitpoints while every other plate class also gains 50 mana. This also applies to wisdom and intelligence which aren't useful for pure melee types. This is sort of nit-picking in my opinion since while it's true, it's not really a factor in the balance of the classes.<p>As I mentioned a bit above, the classes perform differently in different situations and so a major factor in balance is usefulness in these different areas. These would include solo, group and raid abilities. This is a complex area but quite simply, you have to be careful how you use these different areas in balance because you do not want one class that is only good when soloing and another that requires a fullscale raid to be of any use.<p>Further I think it's bad form for any one of these areas to outright require any class or an unbalanced amount of any one class, but that's a completely seperate rant really, because that is far from the way EQ is.<p>This particular area is extremely subjective since it's extremely difficult to measure overall contribution to any of these scenarios and it ends up coming down to player perceptions in many cases as to what class performs better in what situation. The best way to approach it is simply with judgement and asking, what does this class bring to this situation? And further, is it possible to alter their abilities in this situation, without altering the balance of classes?<p>So for example, it is generally accepted warriors cannot solo or I would describe it more that it is extremely impractical for them to solo. There is no real solution that would allow warriors to solo at this point that would ONLY affect a warriors abilities to solo. Any change that is made affects either other classes such as reduced NPC hitpoints or hit damage, or it affects other situations such as if you increased warrior defensive/offensive capabilities.<p>There are facets of this area, usefulness in different situations which are a lot clearer than others. One I will touch on later is versatility and scalability of some classes.<p>But, let's step off of that track for a few minutes and look at some thoughts and specifics about the pure melee classes and Everquest class balance in general.<p><strong>Rogues -</strong> It seems like the main rogue beef is the fact that over time their damage has not kept pace with that of some of the casting classes, namely wizards. I don't regularly parse fights and I don't have parses handy but it is true. The main reason I believe is because of modern day mana regeneration. In the old days, a rogues DPS was considered fixed, they did x DPS every second during a fight. A wizard however would only cast one or two spells on an NPC during an experience group situation, and while overall they may have come out with higher DPS than a rogue, the nature of the damage was different and it was still relatively close.<p>These days with Flowing Thought, horses, KEI everywhere, Potn/Botn, and even beastlord mana regen spells, a wizard can virtually chain cast spells, and their DPS increases significantly as a result. This affects all areas of the game since these things are fairly common and you have to remember that in this situation, the size of their mana pool is almost irrelevant, it's all about how fast they get it back.<p>The solutions to this are not easy to come by, partially because of something I talked about above, balancing classes based on items. You see there is one item in particular that wizards can get that allows them to do significantly more damage than those without. Even without said item, the balance is probably not quite right but throw in the item and it is way off. While everyone has their viewpoint I dislike scaling things down, which means altering wizards or their ability to do the damage they do.<p>It's tough to go the other way also, increasing player power. While rogues are not the baseline class used to balance damage output, if you change them, to keep the other classes at the appropriate level, you have to change all melee classes. This would at the same time affect the DPS every class can do, assuming they can't already chain cast indefinitely without aggro, because warriors would produce more hate, and on and on. Overnight, experience groups would be getting experience significantly faster, raid mobs of all sorts would be dying faster and easier, on and on. <p>Things aren't as easy in almost any case as simply making one minor change and everything magically is balanced. Increasing rogue DPS sounds easy on paper, but in reality, that instantly means you have to rescale and increase all the other melee classes, which might mean you have to rebalance every single encounter, and which probably also means you need to rebalance virtually all of their weapon choices.<p><strong>Monks -</strong> As has been mentioned, the three pure melee classes at the moment are fairly well balanced against each other offensively. Damage parses I have done and seen, indicate that between each other things are balanced.<p>The problem for monks is that virtually all they offer is their damage output, and it is inferior to rogues. At different points in time they have offered different things or their abilities were more useful. Feign death still has uses, but a variety of other classes and game changes mean that you pretty much do not need it in any case. Things such as lulls being improved, and bards gaining a number of powerful abilities, along with increased player understanding of pulling issues, means that just about anyone can pull, and that some classes do it much better thank monks.<p>The solutions here again are not easy. The absolutely easiest solution would be to make monks do equivilent damage to rogues, and simply say that their defensive and utility abilities are what seperates the classes. This would only require a relatively small rebalance of the classes under them as far as melee output goes.<p>That of course would be a serious cop out. I'll go into some ideas that would be useful for all melee classes next with warriors.<p><strong>Warriors -</strong> My own class. Contrary to what a lot of my class thinks I don't think things are as bad as they want to believe. Things aren't perfect either, so let's see what is really the problem.<p>The main issue for warriors is our curse, which we have had to carry with us since the Kunark expansion. I mean of course the two disciplines, evasive and defensive. For those who don't know, these two disciplines reduce damage taken, while also reducing damage output. They last 3 minutes, and recycle in between 4:30-7:30 after fading.<p>The problem with these disciplines is that the entire game since Velious has been designed around their existance. These disciplines have become virtually the sole difference between a warriors ability to take damage and the plate hybrids abilities. Warriors in many cases do not take damage any differently than an equivilently equipped plate hybrid, unless they are in the middle of one of these disciplines.<p>In much the same way I said above that you can't balance things off of a piece of equipment or AA skills, it was an extremely poor decision to balance so much of the game around these disciplines. <p>This all however is probably easier to fix than some of the other issues I addressed previously, although still has wide ranging effects on the game.<p>First, you remove both disciplines as they exist today. In their place, warriors gain a larger class bonus to defensive abilities such that they take 15% less damage than they do now, at all times. Over time this is not much less than a warrior would take on average if they used evasive every opportunity.<p>Next, you give warriors a discipline similar to stone stance that monks get. A fast recycle very short duration discipline which lowers damage taken significantly. This allows the warrior to use his brain and skill to avoid some things which would be deadly otherwise. An example of this is at the start of a big fight, using this ability would give some time for the appropriate debuffs to be applied so that the warrior survives the initial onslaught.<p>Then, you need to alter a few higher level encounters with this all in mind. In many cases no changes would really have to be made since it's generally accepted that you need to be able to keep warriors up indefinitely even beyond when disciplines fade.<p>The next issue for warriors is the one of taunt. Now this is an issue where I disagree with a lot of people, simply because I find taunt to generally work as expected and work sufficiently. For anyone who does not know, Taunt is an either or check at the moment, meaning either it succeeds and the NPC turns to you, or it fails and nothing happens. It works slightly more than it fails, I believe around 60% of the time against non <em>uber</em> things.<p>I'm not keen on changing this much but one change that makes sense is to allow taunt to add hate, either way. An example would be succeed or fail, when you taunt, you would gain your skill level in taunt amount of hate (230 at 65 for warriors). This gives you a chance to gain an NPCs attention even if you failed and allows you to build hate better when its already attacking you.<p><BIG>Overall melee balance</BIG><p>All of those thoughts deal with the basic issues with the pure melee classes but there are some balance issues that extend beyond the scope of these three.<p>A fundemental issue with melee at the moment is the dual wield vs two handed weaapon one. Back in the day it was generally accepted that two handed weapons were for paladins and shadowknights while others used dual wield. The reason was that dual wield weapons virtually always outdamaged equivilent level two handed weapons, and obviously you gained more stats.<p>The problem now with that concept is that the balance has shifted. You need a serious set of dual wielded weapons to beat an equivilent two handed weapon damage wise, and while statistics can still be a factor, many times you're only losing 1% total stats or less by using a two handed weapon. The final issue with dual wield vs two handed weapons is the riposte one. Prior to the planes of power almost no one gave this a second thought since generally speaking things just were not as deadly as they are these days.<p>Now, with NPCs hitting sometimes for close to a thousand damage in experience group situations, and upwards of four times that much on raids, a single extra riposte against you, can kill you. Using dual wielded weapons, you are almost twice as likely to be riposted, so you end up taking more damage and in the case of many mobs, the last thing you need is to take another hit for 2-4k damage.<p>So looking at the complete picture, you have dual wield which does at best equivilent damage, at the same time it increases the damage you take, and the statistical bonuses generally amount to a less than 2% boost to critical stats. Exactly why would anyone use dual wield again?<p>The solutions to this one are tougher to come by. I mentioned how things used to be and you can't go back and make two handed weapons suck again. So you have to examine dual wielding. <p>One of the foundations of balance is that things don't have to be the same but there has to be a reason and a situation to choose one over the other. In the case of weapon setups, the end goal is for dual wield to be a elevated on the offensive side, but remain weaker on the defensive side, while generally leaving two handed weapons where they are.<p>An across the board 10-20% increase in damage done by dual wieldable weapons would be a start, either by changing the items themselves or messing with any tables that affect their damage done.<p>Next 10% increase in statistics, namely hitpoints and armor class. This goes somewhat of the way towards bridging the defensive gap that exists and would still exist, but it would not be an equal tradeoff for taking so many extra ripostes.<p>Again the goal is to balance out the offensive and defensive sides of these weapon setups and while ripostes aren't a big factor for every class, they are still a factor and there are always times when say a rogue or a monk will take a riposte as a mob moves around.<p><BIG>Class Contributions and Versatility</BIG><p>The final subject on balance is versatility and utility. I've talked about this before in different articles but the issue here is that not all classes scale as well as others.<p>For example, if you have one rogue, that is 200 DPS let's say, and you add another rogue, the new rogue in no way affects the first rogue, so they each can do their 200 DPS. <p>To tell how a given class scales you have to look at what they are best at and see if they affect each other and to what degree. Virtually all classes scale fairly well. While some like shaman may not scale infinitely on their primary raid job, but they still scale on a broad basis.<p>One class I can think of however does not scale well with itself, and that is warriors. The reason is that a warriors primary role is to take melee damage, again use the above discussed disciplines. In most cases, one warrior is taking damage and the idea plan for an encounter is for that one warrior to not die. A significant number of fights rest almost entirely on the principle of keeping a single warrior alive.<p>This leaves all the other warriors falling back on their damage output which is modest at best. They bring very little to a raid or even experience group situation when not tanking, and as mentioned above, generally speaking even then without disciplines they don't bring much that a paladin can't.<p>The solutions for this issue are tougher to come by, especially within the framework the game has. The best idea I have come up with is to give pure melee classes extra abilities. I believe EQOA for the ps2 uses something similar but I don't know the details and am just going to make things up.<p>Virtually all pure melee characters have equipment with +mana, and also +int/wis, and some even have lots of flowing thought that is not used. The idea here is to give these pure melee classes mana, and abilities which consume that mana and bring value to a party or a raid. Now, since we don't want to rebalance the entire game, the contribution any one pure melee can bring will be relatively minor, but it will still exist.<p>We create two forms of abilities, one is similar to a bard song in that over time it drains the users mana, in exchange for a group based effect. The other is a a one time mana <em>charge</em> that provides some instant effect. In general, I'd say the effects should last at best 2-3 minutes if left on by the average person, obviously longer for the better equipped.<p><b>Attack/Haste -</b> Stackable (not with bard v3 haste, or itself) haste and attack. +20 attack, +5% v3 haste.<p><b>Shielding -</b> 5% shielding for the group, stackable with the new spells. For those who don't know what i'm talking about, shielding reduces the damage bonus that NPCs get. Generally speaking in the case of experience mobs, 5% shielding equates to lowering damage by 1-3 damage per swing, and on the highest mobs by at most 50 damage per swing.<p><b>Absorb -</b> Would let a warrior absorb a certain amount of damage that anyone in the group takes up to a maximum amount, perhaps scaling with level up to at most a thousand at level 65. This would trade a large block of mana and then any damage done to the group would go to the warrior. <p><b>Stealth -</b> Probably more of a rogue or monk ability, it would lower the hate that everyone in the group generates by around 5%.<p><b>Defense -</b> Increased AC for group members, again stackable with other spells of this nature. Scaling to perhaps 25 AC at the highest level, which is at most 1% damage reduction over time.<br> <br>There are a lot more things you could do with it, and while these sorts of things wouldn't necessarily make warriors as stackable as other classes, or alter the balance of the game much, they would provide some versatility and contribution above what they can do now.<p><BIG>In Conclusion</BIG><p>Despite the length of this article and all the areas I touched on, I want to make it clear that I feel that for the most part things are balanced out ok, but the pure melee classes are like a cake, a cake that is in the pan ready to be made and to have it's icing applied. There are a lot of issues that need to be tweaked and fixed admittedly but everyone needs to understand the depth to which all of these things affect the game. It's literaly a row of dominos and if you mess with one, you need to mess with a lot of things, including things most players don't think about.<p>Hopefully soon, Absor and friends reveal their vision for the future of melee and class balance, and then we can follow this article up with not only my thoughts, but yours. As always, feel free to comment and suggest issues and solutions that you see.</font>
