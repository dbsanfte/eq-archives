   <font class="ArticleText"><I>[Editor's note: The initial posting of this interview, as well as press releases sent out to various other sites to publicize it, referred to Townsend as a &quot;he.&quot; In fact, Townsend is a female. In defense of such a sexist assumption, I can only say that her name brought a picture of legendary songwriter/guitarist Pete Townsend to mind, which affected my selection of pronouns. Our apologies to Townsend, and we promise to be certain of gender in future interviews. --Moorgard]</I> <p>There are certain milestones--firsts in EQ--that happen, and no matter what server they occur on, they are soon discussed and debated everywhere. Recently <a href="http://www.cestusdei.org/">Cestus Dei</a> and <a href="http://foh.noows.com/">Fires of Heaven</a> completed one of these milestones by defeating Tunare in the Plane of Growth. Townsend, guild leader of Cestus Dei was kind enough to agree to an interview to discuss this accomplishment.<p><B>Tann</B>: Could you explain the relationship between your two guilds?<p><B>Townsend</B>: Furor, the leader of Fires of Heaven, has described us their sister guild. It is really the perfect way to describe the relationship. Two independent guilds, with very similar philosophies and play styles, but different personalities.<p><B>Tann</B>: Inter-guild politics on servers can get ugly. Verant has fostered this by forcing guilds to &quot;race&quot; and &quot;compete&quot; for spawns. Was this your first attempt at a joint raid, or have your guilds practiced this before?<p><B>Townsend</B>: You must have missed Furor's memo about our guilds clearing the ToV North Wing Dragons first =) Our guilds started working together in April on what ended up being a two month campaign to clear the North Wing Dragons. That task was a huge undertaking, and FoH started inviting us along to help. Cestus Dei was basically the second Giant Faction guild on Veeshan to seriously hunt in ToV, and that is what got us noticed. <p><B>Tann</B>: How much planning/strategy was involved pre-fight? <p><B>Townsend</B>: To be perfectly honest, I can not answer that question. I do know that the raid came together over basically 2 days, but I do not know how much prep Furor put into the strategy. <p><B>Tann</B>: I'm assuming this wasn't a spur-of-the-moment event. The time invested in clearing the zone was twelve hours, how did you keep members motivated and logged in this long? Was clearing done in stages with members taking &quot;shifts&quot;?<p><B>Townsend</B>: The total raid took around 13 hours, but who is counting.... We took advantage of CD being mostly East Coast, and FoH being mostly West Coast. We are able to start clearing the plane bright and early on Saturday with a very good CD force and more FoH than I have ever seen up that early. Krurk (FoH) ran the raid, until later in the day when Furor took over. The motivation was easy really, we knew that we were going to do the impossible. Our guilds both basically exist to &quot;See shit dead&quot; and we wanted to see Tunare dead. <p><B>Tann</B>: The logistics for communication and designation of roles for people had to be a nightmare. Guilds have a history with their members, they know the strengths and weaknesses of each of their members. How were you able to merge this &quot;personal&quot; information gleaned over time effectively?<p><B>Townsend</B>: Fires of Heaven is the most talented guild playing the game on any server, they have their shit together, and have been at this a long time. Cestus Dei never tried to emulate FoH directly, but ended up on the same path when I refused to get in pissing matches with lesser guilds over VS, Trak, and other contested mobs. CD grew up fast in Velious and we have a damn talented guild because of it. Working together was easy, CD people had been on enough raids to know that you listen to the raid leader. Furor told me directly when there were issues with CD people not being in sync and let me handle it our way. <p><B>Tann</B>: Perhaps the biggest reason guilds don't &quot;cooperate&quot; more on &quot;uber&quot; mobs is one of ego. Guilds like to think their tactics are unique and their players the best. Was ego a consideration when deciding/planning this raid, and what kind of effect did it play on the actual raid?<p><B>Townsend</B>: Egos in both guilds have always been lurking in the shadows, but have never really caused a problem between the two guilds. When we work with FoH we are their on their raid, and our people know it. I know that on their guildchat they bitch about some of our players at times, and I won't lie and say that we don't sometimes do the same. However, since we stay professional and leave any important communication between Furor/Krurk &amp; <B>Townsend</B>/Apostate we get to make shit dead. <p><B>Tann</B>: The loot dropped was nothing spectacular, do you think it's &quot;placeholder&quot; loot, and that Verant in reality didn't expect Tunare to be killed?<p><B>Townsend</B>: We all know that North ToV loot sucked and that Velious was poorly itemized across the board. Kael armor and North ToV loot got upgraded. Personally, I think that even when they did those upgrades no one said &quot;Gee, we should check how our loot on other unkilled things stacks up.&quot; For the number of man-hours that went into this kill, something better should have dropped, but the loot isn't why we went after her. <p><B>Tann</B>: Even with particle effects off, and server filter on, lag is an issue for guilds when doing mobs like Dain, how many people were actually involved in the Tunare bashing, and was lag an issue at all?<p><B>Townsend</B>: The force was basically 69 people with a few of those being non-kos. The zone ended up with 83 people by the time you count all the spectators and spies from other guilds coming to see how we did it - laugh - We had some big names in attendance. The lag was much less than ToV with 120+ people, so for this kill I would say it didn't figure in much at all. Most of FoH/CD have pretty good connections / systems, and those that take precautions. <p><B>Tann</B>: Verant has made changes to certain classes all in the name of &quot;vision.&quot; Hate list and mage CoH come too mind. Did these changes effect tactics at all?<p><B>Townsend</B>: As Verant changes stuff, both guilds adapt. Though the recent CoH change didn't really effect either of us since we neither of us bothers with CoH pulling.... <p><B>Tann</B>: The killing of Tunare, AoW, waking the Sleeper might be considered &quot;end game&quot; by some players. Would you agree with that?<p><B>Townsend</B>: I guess you could call them the Velious end game mobs, but how can you have an &quot;end game&quot; with an expansion on the way? Never mind the fact that it looks like the Sleeper script seems to be still broken... <p><B>Tann</B>: Are there any plans to try your luck with AoW or Sleeper? And if so will you wait a bit in the hopes Verant actually devises a decent loot table for these mobs?<p><B>Townsend</B>: Did I mention we like to see shit dead? <p><B>Tann</B>: FoH has had a reputation for being one of the best guilds on any server almost from the start, have there ever been any issues of &quot;playing in their shadow?&quot;<p><B>Townsend</B>: FoH is the most talented guild on any server. They have more &quot;firsts&quot; to their name than anyone else. Internally, we had a lot of people concerned that we would merge with them, lose our identity or lose members to them. After it became clear that was not going to happen, things went smoothly. Externally, people have called us their Zergs, which I find funny as hell, but has upset some of our members. CD stays off the message boards for the most part, because arguing with trolls on message boards is a waste of time. Anyone that has been on these runs knows that it takes a hell of a lot more than an few extra warm bodies to kill these mobs. Personally, after I got over the awe of working with FoH, I was just able to enjoy the honor. Furor, and FoH, have really treated us like a sister guild, always giving us credit, and a fair shot at loot. It is really nice that we have these new friends that now even join us on CD runs when we are not out making big shit dead. <p><B>Tann</B>: Could you discuss the actual strategy and logistics involved for defeating Tunare? Was this a straight out &quot;zerg&quot; rush, fighting done in waves, CR rushing?<p><B>Townsend</B>: I'm not going to tell you the strategy, the &quot;hint book&quot; mentality that plagues this game cheapens what we and others have done. I will tell you that it was done with skill and strategy without using Zerg tactics, or other such cheese. <p><B>Tann</B>: This has been an amazing week for EQ. AoW, Tunare, 4th Warder all killed, Sleeper awake. Was there a full moon? Something in the water that coordinated these major accomplishments? :) <p><B>Townsend</B>: I would be lying if I didn't say I was surprised and a touch disappointed. That said there are still challenges, and things not figured out yet<p>Stay tuned, these guilds aren't ready to retire yet!<br></font>
