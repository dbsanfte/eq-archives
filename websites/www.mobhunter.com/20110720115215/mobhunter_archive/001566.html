<h1 class="article_title">Living Legacy: What it Does and What it Doesn't</h1>
<p>by Loral on June 08, 2008</p>

<p>First, a disclaimer. I haven't played Everquest in about seven months. I logged in long enough to look at the freebie gift items described below, say hello to my guild, and leave again. I spend most of my time recently playing D&D (expect a D&D 4e review in the next month. I know its not a MMO but you'll just have to suffer through), writing up D&D adventures for my weekly group, and editing my novel (*snoot*), Seven Swords. However, with the attention spent on Living Legacy and my own lack of recent articles, I thought a few words were in order.</p>

<p>Living Legacy is Sony's promotion targeted at bringing veteran players back into EQ. Now that SOE releases Everquest expansions every year instead of every six months, the company likely believes something must be done in between expansions to keep player numbers from dwindling as recently released content becomes old and new content is still far away.</p>

<p>Living Legacy offers a few promotions in a single package. First, all past accounts are reactivated for about six weeks. Second, Secrets of Faydwer is activated for all accounts throughout the six-week promotion and those that choose to keep paying. Third, in-game rewards are given to players to help power up characters to the current baseline. Fourth, new limited-time raids are released with a competitive ranking and reward structure.</p>

<p>Let me cut straight to my problem with this promotion. The people they target left Everquest for some reason and this promotion does not fix these reasons. It wasn't armor power or the cost of the expansion or the lack of raids that pushed many players over to World of Warcraft; it was the lack of entertaining battles and encounters and a feeling of helplessness when it comes to progression.</p>

<p>Everquest's basic structure hasn't changed over the past few years. Aside from instances for groups and raids, much of the game is similar to the way it was nine years ago. The graphics have improved. The characters have grown in power. The items are much stronger than they were. Yet much of the actual gameplay is the same.</p>

<p>Many players left to try something new and found it with other games including World of Warcraft. WoW suffers from its own problems but it offers a few new styles of gameplay at its core that Everquest never embraced: soloing to the maximum level, gear resets with each new expansion, and smaller raids.</p>

<p>A free six week trial to return to Everquest will bring a lot of players back to look around and talk about the old days. People will enjoy spending some free time in the new expansion looking around at all the new places to hunt, beautiful scenery, and big powerful mobs. Some may even enjoy the new armor, although it seems a bit underpowered. The competitive raid program seems to bring the worst part of World of Warcraft, battlegrounds, to Everquest. It would be best to leave that feature alone. Yet with all of these attempts, little in EQ has changed.</p>

<p>Beyond gameplay, character leveling and itemization limits players returning to Everquest. There are so many required alternate abilities that players lagging behind will find themselves either leveling up too far too fast without shoring up their power with AAs or will give up before ever reaching the level of their friends. Some lower level veteran players will also find it impossible to find a group to level up to the same level as their friends.</p>

<p>Itemization also limits returning players. The new gear rewarded for this promotion is limited to three armor pieces and a weapon. Some of these rewards might be duplicates. The power on this gear, unaugmented, is low. Granted, it has augment slots that make it significantly higher, but if players have to hunt for augments to make the gear worth while, they might as well be hunting for the gear itself. It is too little, too late for most people.</p>

<p>In business there is a term called "Barrier to Entry" defining the difficulties of getting customers to your product. For the purpose of this article, "Barrier to Return" is probably more effective. In order to take down barriers to return, what would SOE need to do? Let's look at some radical possibilities:</p>

<p>1. Reward required AA trees at certain levels to shore up characters as they level. Currently it is too easy to level up to the mid 70s or even to 80 without earning any AAs. Higher level characters aren't effective without baseline sets of AAs. By rewarding AAs from 5 levels ago when you reach the next plateau, characters will be shored up and the barrier to return is reduced. Players no longer feel the insurmountable requirement to get 300 AAs on top of 20 levels. The top tier of AAs would still require earning regular AAs but, in a couple of years, players will acquire them when they hit level 85. Every five levels from 65 to 80 players earn their core AAs (determined by the developers) that were available five levels previous.</p>

<p>2. Offer a default set of gear at certain levels. Like the AA sets above, making certain default gear available at certain levels either through quests or vendors would help ensure that players can get to a default baseline power level without having to go to content from five years ago and grinding by themselves. Between this solution and the AA solution, SOE could determine new power tiers for characters and develop content based on these. These tiers of gear should be reset every time there is a new expansion to remove itemization barriers for returning players. Being twinked by your old friends shouldn't be the way you gear up.</p>

<p>3. Let returning players create new classes at any level between 1 and 70. Current MMOs, Everquest and Warcraft included, focus too much on leveling and itemization instead of grouping, adventuring, and campaigning. The content can be the drive, not the lewts. For Everquest, default higher level characters would have the minimum baseline AAs and Gear required to hunt at that level but just about anyone who leveled up manually would be a lot more rounded out. That should help the "but I worked so hard to get here" mentality that destroys game design progress and is largely responsible for the current state of EQ.</p>

<p>Living Legacy is an interesting concept and is likely to bring some players back to EQ. Unfortunately it isn't quite radical enough and largely focuses on free offerings to try to bring players back. Without establishing new character baselines or changing the way the game is played, players are likely to leave for the same reason they left in the first place. At this time, other games are just more fun.</p>

<p>Why do I find it funny for someone who hasn't played EQ in 7 months to be complaining about how the game hasn't changed?</p>

<p>Saying that EQ is the same as it was 9 years ago is a statement that is contradicted by your own articles.</p>

<p>Yes, EQ has a certain style of play.  Most games do.  If you don't like it, then don't expect it to change (if you don't think it has changed, I personally do believe it has).  And yes, I do believe WoW is fun for more people than EQ is, but that's not the real reason less people have quit EQ.  It's because the game is old now. Young gamers are just not going to pick up a 9 year old MMO to play.  For those who use to play, they just got older, priorities changed, they lost friends/guilds in the game, and just decided to move on.</p>

<p>Loral you have been a great and encouraging figure in the EQ community for many years now, but I think it's time to quit posting about EQ.  Without firsthand experience, you need to hand this site over to someone else like Moorgard did to you, or find other games (like DnD) to post about.</p>

<p>Thank you for your years of service.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Redhenna on June  9, 2008 04:16 AM</strong></p>
<p>Hmm, cannot leave this topic alone.  I got to disagree with a bunch of the stuff you wrote Loral.</p>

<p>"Let me cut straight to my problem with this promotion. The people they target left Everquest for some reason and this promotion does not fix these reasons. It wasn't armor power or the cost of the expansion or the lack of raids that pushed many players over to World of Warcraft; it was the lack of entertaining battles and encounters and a feeling of helplessness when it comes to progression."</p>

<p>I don't believe most people left EQ for those reasons to be honest, or at least not entirely for those reasons.  I believe that most people just have a hard time staying interested in one game for years on end.  EQ is what, 9, 10 years old now?  I think burnout is probably the biggest reason people move onto new games, at least in part.  if that is the case, this promotion is perfect, as people who are no longer burnt out on EQ have a chance to get readicted.  Most will not, but just from looking around and talking to people who are on, it seems like a whole lot of people are goofing around in EQ who have not, due to this promotion.  If even 5 % stay, that is a significant gain.</p>

<p>"Yet much of the actual gameplay is the same."</p>

<p>You say that as if somehow it could change significantly.  It cannot.  SoE's first priority has to be it's core playerbase.  Changing the game significantly will only alienate that core, not bring in new people.  Look at what NGE did to SWG.  SoE cannot repeat that mistake.  EQ's core gameplay is not going to change, nor should it.  Would you honestly risk killing your cash cow game on a chance you might gain some subscribers?</p>

<p>"1. Reward required AA trees at certain levels to shore up characters as they level. Currently it is too easy to level up to the mid 70s or even to 80 without earning any AAs."</p>

<p>While this has not been done, SoE has made AA's easier to gain at lower AA counts.  It is now significantly easier to gain your core AA's, and if I remember right, it is now easier to gain AA's as well at lower levels.  I think that is a fine way to do it.</p>

<p>"2. Offer a default set of gear at certain levels."</p>

<p>I am less sure of this, but I beleive that is what has been done with cultural armor.</p>

<p>"3. Let returning players create new classes at any level between 1 and 70. "</p>

<p>While an interesting idea, I think it would be overkill.  With hotzones, LoD, exp potions, increased AA rate for lower AA counts, that should make it fairly easy to get to a point where players have a reasonable chance at success.</p>

<p>------------------</p>

<p>Now, from what I have seen while goofing around back in EQ due to this promotion, there are some things that could be done, without disrupting the game for the current playerbase.</p>

<p>1:  Redo the camera controlls.  F9 has to go, and an easier, more intuitive, less clunky camera system implemented.  After playing just about any other game, going back to EQ it feels like you are almost fighting the camera controll.  You should never have to think about how to make the camera work, it should be natural.  More than anything else, this was incredibly agrivating to me this last week, and others I have talked to reported a similar gripe.</p>

<p>2:  New player models, and new player animations.  My first night back, I went and soloed a few mobs to ding 76(I was 4 % away from 76...must have raided and took a few deaths my last night playing, as I usually kept myself right at 99 %).  Watching myself kinda half hearedly poke at mobs with my Vish stick was disheartening.  The falling for damage animation was brutally bad.  If EQ is to get new players, and bring plaers back, this needs to be fixed.</p>

<p>3:  Do more to help returning players get on their feet, without giving away the farm. The armor pack was absolute junk.  No clues are given that I could see as to what are the hotzones.  With changes to the skill system(not sure what was done, but something) casters are finding their skills are way below max, resulting in massive fizzling.  Trying to solo my mage was at first a complete nogo, since I could not consistantly cast my spells.  Fizzling out half a mana bar trying to heal my pet is not fun.</p>

<p>4:  Less clunky interface/controll.  Just to give an example, in EQ2, you do not need to con every mob to find out if they see invis.  Move mouse over mob, if mobs name has red around it, it sees invis and will agro.  This is not "dumbed down", it is simply less tedious.  You get the same information, require the same amount of situational awareness, you jut have to right click or hit "c" alot less.</p>

<p>My big problem with EQ so far is not that it is a bad game(though it has not solved the problems that, in addition to burnout, propelled me to leave), it's that it is a fight to play after games that have modernized their controll scheme.  It felt like I was fighting the game engine more than the mobs.</p>

<p>yes, but what is often forgotten is that Sony got to its current core base in EQ by systematically changing and alienating people away from the game.</p>

<p>PoP hurt groupers tremendously and so did Gates of discord, even though they have been doing much in terms of repairing the grouping aspect of everquest since then many people who have left cannot be easily persuaded that there wont be another PoP or GoD in the future of EQ.</p>

<p>and those who left EQ due to not having enough time in a day to devote to actively looking or forming groups this promotion probably wont change their mind since the majority of the content in the promotion is aimed at groupers and raiders, and from experience soloing up the new defiant armor can take a very long time.</p>

<p><br />
Red, you hit on a couple of my key things EQ needs to do to modernize itself and appeal to today's gamers.</p>

<p>1) Complete revamp of the UI (combine, consolidate, eliminate windows.)</p>

<p>2) New character models (both for the look and the improved performance.)</p>

<p>3) Quest Journal (make it like EQ2, which has the best journal I've seen to date.)</p>

<p>Loral, I cannot agree with your points.  Free AAs, Free Gear, and Level 70 character from creation.  Isn't the player expected to do anything for themselves?  Why not just warp every one to level 80 with 500 AAs, and remove the bothersome issue of having to level at all (note sarcasm.)  I can see making things easier, that's no problem, but they should have to put in some play time to get there.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Armarant on June  9, 2008 05:22 PM</strong></p>
<p>I agree that there should be some work involved, there should not be a instant 70 button. there is a big job in front of sony though when it comes to that.</p>

<p>1) level 50~80 should be made more soloable without the need to use bazaar to buy gear.</p>

<p>2) A partial interface redo is needed. they have proven they can do a sleek modern interface in EQ when they integrated Legends of norrath into the game. (Mini Maps, Better Quest Interface, replace all the ugly item icons)</p>

<p>3) Monster Cons for soloable mobs. there are mobs that are now considered raid mobs why not mobs that are considered solo mobs.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Joop Weide on June  9, 2008 05:31 PM</strong></p>
<p>I came back to look around. Tried my lvl 61 Wiz and found it hard to play, no clue what to do. Dont get me wrong I loved EQ, I spend a lot of time doing the raids up to the PoP release. The extra 10 levels were too much for me. WoW turned out to be a much better fit for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>Then I tried a new toon, in one of the new areas. Almost got killed by a lvl 1 rat. I know, it is me, but if you want me back, I have to find some way to actually get me back into the game. This isnt helping.</p>

<p>I really dont mind the graphics. Its a shock to be honest, but I have an imaginative mind so I can live with the graphics. But there should be a tutorial island or something to learn me the game again.</p>

<p>I tried to shackle four mobs and kite them, as I remember I used to do, but it was all too difficult. So I'll leave EQ on my drive and wait for the next free come back action in 2009 to see if there is any change of coming back.</p>

<p>There is... it's called the tutorial.  You can start there and do your first ~10 levels in the gloomingdeep mines before you enter Norrath proper.</p>

<p>At the character select screen, there is a button to enter the tutorial if you're level 10 or below.  Try that instead.  It helps you learn what to do, and you run thru a few quests and stuff.  Plus you get a nice charm to boot.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Ghost of Zek on June  9, 2008 08:29 PM</strong></p>
<p>Loral,</p>

<p>I think the biggest issue here is your missing the mark by 100% on what the promotion does and can do.</p>

<p>1) This promotion does not appear to be oriented at making EQ a "market force".  It does appear to be oriented toward people who used ot play, but for what ever reasons, left.  Potentially years and years ago.</p>

<p>2) This promotion is not about *blam!* instantly being into the thick of bleeding edge content.  It does appear to be a way to log in, and poke around a little.</p>

<p>Your post appears to be oriented to the idea that SOE should pave the way for anyone/everyone to instantly be "engaged" in the "current game".  When it appears based on way too many of the forums posts that fewer and fewer people are in the "current game".  More and more of the EQ base is not maxed level, or maxed AAs.</p>

<p>I stopped playing EQ, and paying SOE Feb 2007.  I went so far as to spell out the reasons why I quit in a letter to the CEO of SOE and Sony.</p>

<p>Since Feb 2007, there have been several changes made to the game, none of which sight unseen, would ever cause me to pay SOE soe much as $1 to try out.</p>

<p>What the current promotion does do, and does so very well, is it allows someone like myself, who has very specific game issues that caused him/her to leave, to log in, re-orient himself in the game (read that as re-learn to play) and then see for themselves if the issues are "fixed", "improved", or "still craptastic".</p>

<p>While I'm certainly not going to recommend to anyone that they flock to EQ and re-up thier accounts, and re-up paying SOE, at this point.  I can say that I owe it to myself to at least look, and investigate, and see hands on, if issues that caused me to leave, have been made better.</p>

<p>Frankly I'm surprised that you appear so closed to the idea of trying hands on.</p>

<p>In closing, I just wanted to comment on your remarks regarding MMO's being focued on leveling/advancement, vs., the social aspects.  I see your playing a pen/pencil and paper RPG again.  I'm guessing your seeing friends, new and old, in person, sitting around a table, brain storming ideas for campaigns, writing up new adventures, etc., your fully immersed in the amazing creative process of a good RPG group.  No MMO will ever out-do, or compare to that.  MMO's are at best a substitute for the real hands on RPGs for people that cannot find the time, or the poeple, to have a good RPG group.  Simply put, there's no comparrison, and unless someone comes up with a completely virtual reality (ala the Matrix), there never will be.</p>

<p>That said, I look forward to your review on AD&D 4e, and do hope that you either re-concider actually doing some solid hands on game play testing, or you consider the idea of posting a review by a returning playing that had wracked up some hands on testing hours.</p>

<p>On that note I'm off to re-read the level 65-70 spell descriptions for Shaman again, how did I ever manage to forget what Malo did?  lol</p>

<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Loral on June  9, 2008 08:38 PM</strong></p>
<p>That's a good idea, Zek.</p>

<p>I will open this up to all of the readers here. In a month email me a short article, under 1000 words, describing your return to Everquest based on this promotion. If it's well written, I'll post it.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Coray on June 10, 2008 12:34 AM</strong></p>
<p>I returned oh a month and a half ago, prior to this promotion, and I can comment about the state of the game, as someone who used to be hardcore but now plays just a bit.</p>

<p>Your comments about AAs is uninformed, they are absolutely trivial to get with the recent changes.  Even poorly geared you can pretty easily get 5 an hour, and I imagine the hardcore types could probably rack up close to 100 a day.</p>

<p>Free gear is pretty much what each new expansion brings, SoF is candyland for returning players as it's trivial to get lots of nice upgrades.  The first time I stepped foot into SoF, my group got like 5 upgrades.  With the new armor plus stupid cheap sof items you can be equipped in a matter of days.  Then of course even higher level stuff is now more attuenable, so you can camp it or buy it.</p>

<p>Auto level 70, eh again, getting to level 70 is trivial.</p>

<p>The game is easier to get into than ever, except perhaps the reduced server populations may make it harder to get groups.</p>

<p>The game still has issues.  Group to raid balance is probably the worst it has ever been despite the nice items available.  While it may appear that the gap has narrowed, in reality if you compare the best raid gear to the best group gear, you're talking a gap of probably 60% in many areas.</p>

<p>The game has changed and the idea now is to pull one thing, fight and kill it then another.  Everything hits so hard that it's not a smart move to get more than one, and as such it's trivial to pull singles all day long with the current things pull classes have.  </p>

<p>What that ends up doing, single mobs that hit ridiculously hard, is to make what a group can do entirely dependant on their tanks gear.  Everyone else dies so quick their gear almost does not factor in.  This makes the game a bit more boring than the old days, although the quicker progression keeps it as interesting.</p>

<p>The game is still not for everyone, I suspect most casual players would find it frustrating to find groups, so while I can 4 box and make progress in a short amount of time, most people cannot and I think that has been and will continue to be one of the biggest issues.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: pootersox on June 10, 2008 10:05 AM</strong></p>
<p>I'm in a raiding guild that just finished AG (except Lethar II) and is working through Frostcrypt. That gives you folks who still play a sense of our gear and AA levels.</p>

<p>Several old friends have returned recently.  One was gone 4 1/2 years.  He has gotten his rogue 9 levels while getting his shaman 7 levels and his warrior 8 levels.  He joined a "having fun" guild so he could get groups, and when tanks were scarce convinced a new friend of his to join the same guild and tank.  I think he (and his new friend) are both planning to come to my guild when they've attained sufficient levels and AA.</p>

<p>A former guild officer who retired b/c of RL issues 18 months ago took advantage of the offer; he seems to be enjoying himself once again.  We've heard from a couple of other folks who may well do the same thing.  And I'm seeing familiar (and missed) old faces around the Guild Lobby now.</p>

<p>I've talked to other folks who have simply logged on to say hello and found that sufficient; the bug did not bite them again.</p>

<p>I think that this is the smartest move SOE has made in terms of player population in years!</p>

<p>First, they made it much easier to level up, to get needed AAs, and to get gear that is at least entry-to-raiding level.</p>

<p>Then they came up with this enticement: no need to spend a cent!  Just come play in Norrath and the planes for 6 weeks or so!  We'll give you all the expansions!  We'll give you NPCs in PoK who will explain to you what you've forgotten!  We'll put info all over our official site for you to check stuff out!</p>

<p>Will most of the folks who pop on to look around again stay? Probably not.  Will some? Definitely!  Will this approach bring more people back than just about any other approach you can think of? For sure.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Plast on June 10, 2008 12:47 PM</strong></p>
<p>What would it take for me to come back? (probably too late to bother since I play DAoC and WoW and will try WAR in the fall)</p>

<p>I would need a full suit of armor(not 3 pieces of random armor)and a weapon that allows me to join any non ideal group and play some of the latest content and still see rewards from group play that would improve my gear allowing me to become viable for tougher bosses and raid content. I am very willing to work for my rewards but got very tired of falling farther and farther behind with each expansion. </p>

<p>I would need to be able to get all my spells through group content in a reasonable amount of time. </p>

<p>I would need to be able to get 100 AAs a week playing a few nights of 3-4 hours. (thus 10+ AAs per hour for the earlier AAs- or start me off with a catch up 500AAs)</p>

<p>Solo content in the latest zones for both my Pally and my Druid which results in good AA flow and gear upgrades.</p>

<p>Does this promotion look like it will do this? I doubt it. Oh - did I mention that I would need to see the benefits on both my mains at least- not just one per account? Maybe it could be for any level 50+ character.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Aarkan on June 10, 2008 02:30 PM</strong></p>
<p>This is an extremely angry article and it's kind of upsetting for me. I would have much rather you say "EQ is long past me, I don't really have a comment on this." than your angry, uncharacteristic rant. Also the Living Legacy promotion doesn't just effect EQ but EQ2 as well and the latter has me back hook line and sinker after a good run with WoW.</p>

<p>Regardless, what this promotion says to me is "Norrath is here to stay and we want you all to be a part of it."</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Jyve on June 10, 2008 11:34 PM</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, wish you'd actually played it for a short time before coming out with the 'here's what you need todo to save EQ' post that we see every day in the vet forums.<br />
XP gain rate is HUGELY increased.<br />
Gear is, if anything,too easy to get.</p>

<p>It's never been easier to get a group, play the game, enjoy it having fun.  If you can't put in more time playing the game than it probably took to write the article, then I'm afraid it does destroy your credibility somewhat.</p>

<p>Sorry that this'll come across badly, but we see these posts daily and this is nothing new, especially from someone not even playing the game.</p>

<p>Login, hang around a hotzone and see for yourself.</p>

<p>I've left my alts of various levels in the level appropriate hotzones and have groups (with different players) within a minute or so of logging in.  I don't use /lfg, I run up, see if there's a spot, and offer my services.  If full, move to next group.  <br />
TBH, this has been my method since I started playing and it's worked well for me so far, just seems really easy to get a group, even without having a known good rep on a baby alt or being overly twinked.<br />
I've never understood people who put on LFG in the guildhall, go AFK, then moan they never get groups.  Oh, must admit, all alts in level appropriate guilds too so I've got a fall back just in case.<br />
From watching zones like Nadox/BoT/even Riwwi(that one surprised me tbh), there's a healthy and constant stream of people logging in, yelling LFG and getting a group pretty quick.</p>

<p>"It's never been easier to get a group, play the game, enjoy it having fun."</p>

<p>This is actually the hardest time to find a group unless your a raider or personally know other people in the game.</p>

<p>just because its easier does not mean they should be resting, plenty of people who left feel the same way as Loral and do not want to play a game that requires their life as payment to be able to do anything in game.</p>

<p>and its really only enjoyable if you know the people your grouping with or have enough money to spend on trinkets from Legends of Norrath.</p>

<p>I will try(no promises) to get time this weekend to log into EQ, and do an experiment, seeing how long it takes to put together a pickup group.  Again, no promises, but I will try.</p>

<p>Here's my two cents for what it's worth.  Fascinating reading y'all's posts, btw.  =) </p>

<p>Some of us left EQ simply because the graphics requirements exceeded our video capabilities, and we couldn't afford to upgrade our notebooks every six-twelve months.</p>

<p>After switching to Mac, I discovered to my delight the EQ download is free, so I tried it again.  Unfortunately, SoE doesn't really cater to Macs (boo-hoo!) as there's only one server limited to  PoK and below, and no tutorial.  But I digress...</p>

<p>Obviously I don't have access to Living Legacy on my server (that I know of), but I caught the gist from reading the posts.  Kudos for trying to get people back, and cheers for creating a classic, period.  However...</p>

<p>IMHO, the underlying issue w/ EQ is that grouping is mandatory if you want to get anything good.  There are many casual gamers who love to play, but don't have the time to do raids, or wait for 72-hour spawn mobs to pop.  Soloing is the main style of play for them; they just want to escape RL for a while.  Also, four hours to reach lvl 2 w/ a melee?  Frustrating to say the least, esp when I can be lvl 10+ in the same amount of time on EQoA, which has some smoother game mechanics, imo.  What makes some of the other MMO's appealing is that grouping is optional, not mandatory.</p>

<p>The second issue is that at some point early on, possibly when Sony took over, EQ began to cater to  high lvl players and really left the casual gamer in the dust.  That's fine if that's what the devs want to do, but it does limit the customer base a bit.  Hence, the migration to other games that focus more on individual developmental journeys rather than uber gear, twinking, and power-leveling.</p>

<p>Honestly, if they want a way to keep people around, the characters need to be more customizable and the world needs to evolve, something like real life.  For instance, make Elder Scrolls into an MMO.  Perfect example of completely customized chars; you're not locked into a set of rules defining what you can do based on what class you choose at the beginning.  The char may change as the world around changes, simply by honing different skills.  Yes, I realize EQ has skills, but what skills a char has is still defined by their class.  I believe this is part of why people get bored and leave.  Then again, if EQ copied ES, it wouldn't be EQ, would it?  =)</p>

<p>Realistically, EQ is not going away.  It's a classic, and as such will always have historical/nostalgic value.  If SoE made the soloing a bit easier, and the mob spawn/loot drops more frequent, they could pick up more of the casual gamer customer base, but I really don't foresee that happening.</p>

<p>So, until I can afford my uber desktop (sigh), I guess I'll just have to be content w/ EQoA, and maybe even try WoW.  Good hunting, all!</p>

<p>4 hours to be level 2 as a melee?</p>

<p>Uhm, if you play the tutorial, you get level 2 by the time you even reach the adventure area and hail the NPCs.  Total time, probably about 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Maybe the Mac version does not have the tutorial, but the PC version does. :)</p>

<p>For returning players, there are simply too many AAs that were originally put in place to slow people down or address for quirks in the interface.  Many of these should be eliminated and refunded outright or addressed through simple quests from your GM . Some examples:</p>

<p>Battle Ready. 5AAs for extra bandoleer slot. Players should not have to pay AAs because of user interface design. Possible to just do this manually, but why make it harder on players? Shouldn't EQ have easiest interface without having to buy AAs?</p>

<p>Energetic Attunement. 5AAs to raise max regen from worn items 1 per level. The ability to take advantage of an item should not be dependent upon AAs. Many items already done by level, players dont need 2 barriers.</p>

<p>Mystical Attuning. 5AAs to increase maximum number of buffs. If a player can get the buff, let them have it.</p>

<p>Quick Draw. 5AAs for extra potion slots. Once again, a person can manually do this without the AA, so why not make just make the interface easier?</p>

<p>Enhanced Agression. 5AAs to increase worn attack. Great, another timesink to take advantage of an item. When are players going to be able to take true advantage of gear? After they spend 800AAs on the must-haves?</p>

<p>Mastery of the Past. 3AAs to decrease fizzle rate on lower level spells. Turn this into quests with your GM based on your level. Cast x spell y times and get this ability.</p>

<p>Mnemonic Retention: 3/6 AAs for additional spell slots. Why not just give a player more spell slots at higher levels? This just limits a players capability and is an inconvenience.</p>

<p>Instrument Mastery/Singing Mastery: Once again, more AAs to be able to fully utilize a recently acquired item. If these are such great AAs, where is the one that limits AC on an item or weapon speed? On second thought - forget I even wrote that and eliminate both these AAs.</p>

<p>Remember:<br />
AAs that elminate barriers - become barriers themselves.</p>

<p>I’m going to start t his by disagreeing with Loral on his first point: “It wasn't armor power or the cost of the expansion or the lack of raids that pushed many players over to World of Warcraft; it was the lack of entertaining battles and encounters and a feeling of helplessness when it comes to progression.”</p>

<p>There are many reasons people left EQ, as varied and personal as there are people that left, and the longer the player has been away, the more likely at least one change will make them enjoy things better this time around. </p>

<p>I can think of two huge changes that may change the minds of loads of players:<br />
- Corpse Summoning via Guild Hall<br />
- Out of Combat regeneration encouraging soloing and cutting downtime.</p>

<p>As Redhenna stated, I think this is more aimed to the people that at some point were burned out. Them and the ones that quit WAY long ago.</p>

<p>I often hear the “catch up race” every time I read this site when referring to returning players. I really don’t think you have to think about it as much as you should about “enjoying your trip to max level”</p>

<p>Sure, this is something that I don’t think has been addressed, but a simple line of quests that can take you from 1 to Max Level solo (even if slowly) would do the trick nicely. Make it linear enough that players don’t get “lost” and non-linear enough that players can skip stages if they out-level them due to grouping. Give the player AAs and gear as reward for completing mini-arcs.</p>

<p>Now here are the reasons why I wont stick around:</p>

<p>----No sense of direction.----<br />
As noted above, when I first jump in I need some form of direction. A solo quest that slowly takes me on a journey to max level would do perfectly fine. The first few levels have a neat new tutorial; we just need that experience extended all the way to max level.</p>

<p>----I poke you with my spear!----<br />
I don’t mind the player models as much as the horrid animations. The new half dragon race was cool looking, but even they have animations that almost do an epic attempt at intentionally disappoint me. In the worst case, grab those amazing motion captured skeletal animations from EQ2 and adapt them into EQ1. That alone would have me reconsider giving the game more than 2 reluctant days at playing.</p>

<p>----Picasso?----<br />
The graphics improvements for some mobs and revamped zones are nice. However it have come to a disturbing experience due to two different issues. First, you have entirely revamped zones like Freeport that have new skeleton and rats but still host the original guards. That’s very disturbing on it’s own.</p>

<p>Then we have that most of the graphical updates have been made within various years of expansions. As expected, every new expansion tends to do it’s best at wowing players with even cooler visuals. Result is that some common entities look way better than others, and you just know that the other ones won’t be replaced again. Watching at a LDON Orc by the side of a “no clue when” specter was disappointing, even if not to the degree of the Freeport guard. At least when redoing common mobs, they should stick to a graphical standard that should not be exceeded.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Closing:<br />
This promotion wont get me back to EQ, but it did get me back into EQ2, there may be others that saw past what bothered me and decided to stay.<br />

<p>In addition with my post, I want to share an annoying/funny story.</p>

<p>I am a Bard; I have the mask that allows me to cast Dark Elf illusion on myself. It was a bit of a hobby of mine to wonder around Neriak, and I was curious if it was on the list of revamped zones so I went there. Now, I do remember that illusions faded with zoning so once in I recast my illusion. Everyone is dubious, since I follow Erolissis Mar, and rare guards are KoS. I  bump into one and have to run away. As soon as I rezone into the new Nektulus Forest I realize something: the zone is now too close to the guard, no longer does it twist turns. The guards standing outside see me and kill me on the spot before I can even attempt to run.</p>

<p>This is how I got introduced to the new corpse-summoning feature. Thankfully, I had most of my money on the bank.<br />

<p>Long time EQer from way back. I stopped playing EQ in 05, they are right.. i left because it was burned out and tired. Played WoW till a few months ago and retired that game.. again.. raiding BT / HJ gets boring and tiring.. need something new.. or something different. I went back to a old fallback, AO, I had so much fun playing a old familiar friend.Played some AoC but now i see this promotion.. going to walk around check out how EQ has changed in the last 3 or so years. Games just get old and people want something different.. thats why most people leave.. as for WoW.. I HATE THAT GAME. I enjoy a sense of accomplishment.. EQ used to provide that.. u work hard u get something to show for it... WoW used to do that. they recently stopped. Removing attunments, giving people higher lvl gear by running low lvl instances aka badges, minor gear resets every big patch and full gear resets every xpac... i feel as if i work for nothing.. but a title over my name.. I looked at another posting.. about that.. how Blizz is doing it right.. i disagree... i like progression.. blizz wants the "casual" player.. to win out. they want to give everyone equal chances.. in doing so.. they have the people that work super hard behind.. i hope that EQ maintains its old mythos.. and keeps true to awarding its players.</p>

<p>The big problem with EQ is that it is now all about equipment, augs and levels and nothing about having fun with friends, and adventuring. </p>
