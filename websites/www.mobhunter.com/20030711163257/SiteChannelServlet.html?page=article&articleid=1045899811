It all started on Saturday, when <a href="http://eqconquest.inet.net.nz/index.php">Conquest</a>, a guild on Lanys went to Sleeper's Tomb.<p>It was a hazy blueish day in Sleeper's Tomb, and Conquest was killing the warders.  There are 4 warders, and they are tough enough that killing them is a major accomplishment.  <p>Well, Conquest worked their way through the first two warders and <a href="http://eqconquest.inet.net.nz/index.php#newsitem991549702,99522,">killed the third</a>.  Lewtz were phat and spirits were high, and there was one warder to go.<p>Conquest attacked Ventani, the 4th warder.  As the fighting raged, <a href="http://eqconquest.inet.net.nz/sleepers/sleeper01.jpg">Kerafyrm woke up</a> and slaughtered Conquest, and Ventani.<p><hr size=0 width="95%" align=center><p>Sounds like a pretty straightforward EQ story so far.  But then the problems started.<p>You see, the awakening of The Sleeper is supposed to be a big deal.  Here's my understanding of the story:<p>The Sleeper was, apparently, encased in a bubble by either The Ring of Scale or the Claws of Veeshan (it's a little hazy).<p>Rumor has it that different colored dragons are forbidden to get together.  The Sleeper was imprisoned due to a violation of this taboo.<p>The awakening of the Sleeper signals the end of this restriction.  Nagafen's banishment is ended, and he is finally free to marry the Lady Vox.  <a href="http://eqconquest.inet.net.nz/img/news/naggy.jpg">Nagafen reportedly said &quot;Ha! The Ring and Claws are doomed!  The Sleeper has been awakened, what a glorious day!  Lady Vox, I will see you soon, our long delayed nuptials can now proceed!&quot;</a> when the Sleeper woke.<p>Other dragons said other things.  <a href="http://pub49.ezboard.com/fconquesteqfrm1.showMessage?topicID=288.topic">Jaled Dar's shade said &quot;HAHAHAHA!  Those fools believed me!  Revenge is mine, and destruction is visited upon the world!  Ware The Sleeper, fools, for he is AWAKE!&quot;</a>  Most dragons spend most of their time dead, and no one was in Permafrost to hear what Vox had to say, so the other quotes are missing.<p>So then destruction is rained down upon the land of Norrath, except...<p><hr size=0 width="95%" align=center><p>Except Verant didn't finish the Sleeper's script.  Instead of turning into a cool dragon, the sleeper appears <a href="http://eqconquest.inet.net.nz/img/news/st5.JPG">the default mob graphic, a standard male human</a>.<p>The destruction doesn't happen.  Nothing much happens.  It's not done.  No one is supposed to be tough enough to wake the sleeper yet.  So if you do, Verant gets mad.<p><hr size=0 width="95%" align=center><p>The first time, Abashi followed Fires of Heaven on their sleeper raid, and the Great Cleric Nerf was the result.<p>This time, GM Valdemar came to sleepers and shouted &quot;Everyone that is in this zone, has a corpse in this zone, or was involved in the invasion of this zone is receiving a warning for Exploitation.&quot;  Conquest members were suspended.  There was <a href="http://lumthemad.net/story.php?story=2064">talk of bannings and the guild being disbanded</a>.<p>The ultimate result remains to be determined.<p><hr size=0 width="95%" align=center><p>Adding to this, Conquest muddied the waters by posting <a href="http://eqconquest.inet.net.nz/index.php#newsitem990987427,30485,">faked (or at least mislabeled) screenshots</a> on their <a href="http://eqconquest.inet.net.nz/">home page</a>. They claimed to have killed the the sleeper.  They did not.  This was a joke from last week.<p>They also posted a <a href="http://downloads.eqconquest.inet.net.nz/downloads/Sleepers1.zip">cool sleepers video</a>.<p><hr size=0 width="95%" align=center><p><b>Update:</b><p>The Conquest guild apparently <b>did</b> get disbanded and warned for exploiting.  Here's more info on what Conquest did.  <p>1. They kept their clerics out of range of the warder's AoE.  AoEs tend to be 2-dimensional, and if you're below the plane of the mob, the AoEs tend to miss you.  This is well-known, and has been discussed and used as a tactic to kill mobs as common as the drakes in lavastorm.<p>2. Ressurection effects could not be dispelled or overwritten by the warders AoE.  Therefore, characters suffering from ressurection effects were immune.<p>3. Call of Hero clears aggro.  They used it for this purpose.<p>4. Ressurection clears aggro.  They used this too.<p>Conquest talks about it <a href="http://pub49.ezboard.com/fconquesteqfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=293.topic&amp;start=36&amp;stop=36">here</a>.<p>Be warned: some of these tactics may or may not be exploits.  Only Verant decides what is an exploit and what isn't.  And it is Verant's policy not to communicate about exploits.  So there's no way to find out whether you're exploiting until you get banned -- and even then, you might not find out.<p>Players are justifiably upset.  Read <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=25017.topic">here</a> and <a href="http://lumthemad.net/forums/showflat.php?Board=comments&amp;Number=14692&amp;sb=5&amp;o=7">here</a> and <a href="http://www.noows.com/article.php?sid=222">here</a>.<p>Also, more on the Sleeper's story <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?threadid=26068">here</a>.<p><b>More:</b><p>The warders have reportedly been perma-killed by the GMs on all the servers now.  Also, Lanys was reportedly down for a while recently, presumably to undo the awakening after-effects.<p><hr size=0 width="95%" align=center><p>The moral of the story is to leave the sleeper alone until Verant is done with the script.  This will probably be after Permafrost is redone, and it may have to wait until next summer, when all the critical bugs are worked out of Shadows of Luclin.<p><hr size=0 width="95%" align=center><p><b>Update: Then, Brad McQuaid said:<p>On June 4th, 2001, SOE banned and/or suspended 28 players belonging to the guild Conquest. Plainly put, they were cheating, we observed them cheating, they knew they were cheating, they admitted they were cheating, and they got caught.<p>While SOE does not want to spoil the game by releasing full details of the cheats to all players, basically the 28 Conquest players were (among other things) purposely using world geometry, aspects of the hate list, the &quot;z&quot; coordinate and its nullification of NPC's ability to summon, and multiple atmospheres (e.g. water/land) to arrange dragon-type encounters so they could attack without getting hit back for the vast majority of the time that it took to kill the monster. In short, what they did was carefully orchestrate 100,000+ hps encounters so that, for 75% or more of the time that it took to kill the encounter, the monster got beaten on and was not able to fight back.<p>In addition, SOE staff observed various members of the guild discussing the cheating -- these comments include:<p>&quot;we're useing [sic] massive amounts of exploits and u send a gm down here?&quot;<p>&quot;Any lead GM shows up, this show is over.&quot;<p>&quot;yeah, this is the most impressive Itz-guyversploit [sic] to date&quot;<p>&quot;every guild exploits these&quot;<p>The EverQuest Rules of Conduct state, among other things: <p>&quot;You will not exploit any bug in EverQuest and you will not communicate the existence of any such exploitable bug (bugs that grant the user unnatural or unintended benefits in game), either directly or through public posting, to any other user of EverQuest. You will promptly report any such bug via the in-game <code>/bug</code> command or via the <a href="mailto:eqtesting@verant.com">eqtesting@verant.com</a> email address.&quot;<p>&quot;Disciplinary issues involving guilds will also be addressed on a broader basis. Guilds whose members habitually violate any of the Rules of Conduct . . . may be disbanded.&quot;<p>As a result of this unfortunate incident, (i) most of the participants were suspended for one week, (ii) a few, who had received previous warnings or suspensions, were banned, and (iii) this guild has been disbanded.<p>SOE regrets having to take these measures, but SOE is committed to protecting the health and viability of the game and of the EverQuest community. We'd also like to correct a few related misconceptions regarding this event: (i) Conquest did not complete the encounter - SOE staff inadvertently spawned the Sleeper during its efforts to stop the cheating, (ii) the &quot;human figures&quot; in some screenshots are a result of the screenshot taker not patching, and (iii) the zone is complete and working -- once SOE has patched fixes to these exploits we encourage players to wake the Sleeper.<p>We appreciate everyone's emails with regards to questions and we do hope this will assist everyone in an understanding of the situation.<p>-The EverQuest Customer Service Team</b><p><hr size=0 width="95%" align=center><p>Hmmm.  I wonder what happend to:<p><b>It is our policy not to discuss disciplinary actions taken on players with other players. These actions are considered confidential and we only will communicate directly to those players involved in the incident.<p>I am sorry that we will not be able to answer question on this issue. Please communicate to other members of the guild that unless they were directly involved in the incident they will receive this same response.<p>Michelle Butler<br>EverQuest Customer Service Manager<br>Sony Online Entertainment</b><p><hr size=0 width="95%" align=center><p>Oh.  <a href="http://lumthemad.net/forums/showthreaded.php?Cat=&amp;Board=comments&amp;Number=15746&amp;page=0&amp;view=collapsed&amp;sb=5&amp;o=7">This</a> from the Lum forums:<p><b>Severian: Your point in general is valid: we've always been clear as to what our policy is regarding commenting on bannings/suspensions and the like. Going forward, however, we are changing this policy: we will continue to respect customer (and former customer) privacy to the extent that we'll not talk about specific individual's, their names, character names, private communications between them and us, etc. <p>If, however, an event like this one (multiple bannings/suspensions) comes under the public eye, we will (at our descretion) post a general statement regarding this issue such that it's at the very least 'our word against their's' as opposed to 'their word against silence'. <p>-Brad</b><br>
