<h1 class="article_title">Omens of War Review</h1>
<p>by Loral on September 20, 2004</p>

<p>Last week SOE released Everquest's eighth expansion in five years, Omens of War.  There is no way to fully review an expansion after only one week, so consider this the first of at least two reviews of the expansion.  In later weeks we will discuss whether the expansion filled in all of the gaps it intended to fill.  For now we focus on what we know so far.  Omens of War is a very strong expansion and well worth $30.</p>

<p>Omens includes a lot of new, useful, and fun zones to hunt in.  There are eight over-land zones starting at level 45 and quickly reaching into level 65 and 70.  There are three sets of instanced expeditions, the sewers, catacombs, and hollows.  One locked zone awaits the arrival of big fancy people, and a set of Justice-like instanced group and raid trials await the corpses of level 70s.</p>

<p>The zones in this expansion look great.  The wide open wastelands of the Wall of Slaughter stretch to the crushed walls of the Dragorn keeps. Ancient bridges cross the canyons of the Ruins of Dranik.  All of these zones resemble lands at war, with scorched earth and skies of smoke.</p>

<p>Unlike Planes of Power, the better hunting zones of Omens are unlocked.  The instanced expeditions guarentee that any player above 45 can find a place to earn good experience with little competition.</p>

<p>Omens has only one locked zone and none are expected to see it right away.  Already we see treasures coming from the furthest reaches of the Muramite Provingrounds (sic) and Riftseeker's Sanctum.  Flags prevented this sort of  gold rush in Planes of Power and Gates of Discord, but the advantages of unflagged zones outweigh the disadvantages.</p>

<p>It is no surprise that characters began reaching level 70 two days after release.  Characters have been at level 65 for a long time and not being at the top level seems unnatural.  Many seek to reach that top end not because they want it but because they feel they deserve to have it.</p>

<p>More troubling is where they go to get it.  Instead of joining five friends and exploring these new lands, fast-track hunters head to the Plane of Fire. Message threads string across the net with discussions of the Plane of Fire and the experience within.  Some report waiting in lines to kite at the tables, the single best place to earn experience in the game.  If ever a place needed to be modified to increase the risk vs reward, that is it.</p>

<p>The alternate advanced abilities in Omens appear far more useful than the ones we saw in Gates.  Most continue the progression of previous AAs such as critical damage increases, healing increases, and stat increases.  Some offer a lot of utility such as a ninth spell-gem and five more buff slots.  For 25 AA points, one can up their mana regeneration cap from 15 to 20.  Each class has a few unique and interesting abilities as well.</p>

<p>The shiny loot of Omens appears to fill in the power gap between level 65 single-group hunters and high-end professional raiders.  We now reached a point where a character can level from 1 to 70, gear up with bazaar, Ornate, and LDON loot, and then earn gear in the high-end of Omens without ever needing to raid to get better gear.  Raiding always offers greater rewards, as it should, but single-group progression now has a bridge deep into Gates of Discord and the high-end of Omens of War without requiring raiding.</p>

<p>The task system improved a lot since the early days of beta.  Tasks break up into a set of four sub-tasks involving exploration of places best left alone, shady meetings with Wayfarer agents, collecting four shiny things, and killing ten evildoers.  Tasks range from level 5 to level 65 with more tasks on the way in coming weeks.  Their difficulty varies but I completed two or three different ones by myself at level 65, not bad for a weak and pasty cleric.</p>

<p>The greatest improvement to the task system is the scaling reward.  While some classes solo much better than others, players earn rewards based on class.  Clerics, paladins, and warriors who generally have more trouble hunting alone receive a higher reward than necromancers, bards, and wizards who can complete tasks much faster.  The rewards of the task system make it useful without ruining the rewards of grouping.  Triggered beasts and events locked for the triggering player would add a lot of excitement to the tasks.  Perhaps that is a feature we will see later on.</p>

<p>The graphics in Omens are astounding.  Detailed carvings and erosion on walls look good enough to run a hand over.  Torchlight shines on the scaly skin of a Dragorn as it rushes down a hallway.  Red eyes shine bright from the six eyes of a Chimera.  Moonlight shines off of the water over the Abysmal Seas.  Breath frosts out of the mouths of the hunters of Halas.  Everquest's look improved much in the last five years and its visuals never cease to amaze me.</p>

<p>The lack of description and options for graphic performance makes these new graphics inconsistent from user to user.  A new "advanced" tab in display options offers shadows, reflective waters, pixel shader 1.0, pixel shader 2.0, vertex shaders, reflective waters, and a few other options.  It doesn't include Hardware TnL (don't ask me what it stands for) and Vsync, the option that tells the game not to run faster than your monitor can display. Vsync may be the most important feature to make Everquest look solid on faster machines and the only way to enable it is to put a "Vsync=1" variable under "Defaults" in one's eqclient.ini file.</p>

<p>Everquest needs a better interface for display settings with better auto-detection, a simple slider bar or check box for the features to enable.  Most important are descriptions of what each feature does and what types of systems should enable it.  Few people know what a pixel shader 2.0 is and no one should need to.</p>

<p>In the mean time, players must work hard to understand all of the available settings and figure out which they should use.</p>

<p>SOE released a lot of smaller features in Omens as well.  The voice macro system lets tanks shout "Heal me, dolt!" when my eyes stray over to my Tivo too much.  Guild tributes let officers donate junky gear so other members can have an extra point of mana regen.  Custom titles ensure you can pick the title you liked the best.  I always preferred Venerable to Exarch.</p>

<p>Omens is a great expansion.  Excellent unflagged and unrestricted zones, new levels and AAs, new shiny loot for both single-group hunters and raiders, top-notch graphics, and a lot of fun new features make Omens one of the best Everquest expansions.  It takes time to find all of the nooks and crannies in such a game, no one can write a complete review after only one week of play, but so far Omens is a lot of fun.</p>

<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Naladini on September 21, 2004 01:36 AM</strong></p>
<p>I'm fairly positive about the expansion on the whole, but would like to balance out (aka nitpick) a few points in your article if you don't mind.</p>

<p>You missed a pretty big negative, the decision to make level 69-70 spells NO DROP is a pretty poor one IMHO. It reeks of the attitude that "casters don't need all of their spells".<br />
This is something that will need to change, but it may take a month or two before enough non-raiding casters reach those levels for voices to be heard.</p>

<p>I still struggle with trying to figure out what prompted this decision. Has there not been enough discussion about SOE ignoring higher level non-raiding players? Is Sony finally admitting that if you're going to reach the top level of the game, you have to raid to improve yourself?</p>

<p>As for tasks, at level 63, I seem to be getting many of the same tasks people have been writing about at level 65+. These are not easiliy soloable, and involve some hard to reach places and conflicting factions (droga vs. chardok). I do have hope that the system will be tuned in the near future, but as I've said before, I believe the task system will serve as a fast levelling conduit for lower level players, with the rewards unfortunately dropping off at higher levels to promote grouping.</p>

<p>The other thing missing in this expansion would be some real creativity in terms of spell and AA design. From what I've seen for the Magician class, lots of basic upgrades (based on PoP spells, not GoD), but nothing with real imagination, despite many fine suggestions being made over the months leading up to the expansion. I'd expect many classes are in the same boat on this topic. Another minor gripe would be the number of class specific AA's that all seem to be upgrades of abilities from previous expansions. Disappointing that there is no "new" ability with no pre-requisite, at least from the perspective of a player with only 12 aa points ;)</p>

<p>You're definitely right though, it will take more time to judge this expansion on a whole, especially since there is always some fine tuning within a month or so of release.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by:  on September 21, 2004 05:03 AM</strong></p>
<p>I've heard that the "no locked zones" is wreaking havoc already, along with some really fast respawn timers...  From what I heard, about 350 people got together on the Eci server to take down Cipheron, grats zerg force on 200hp items every ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Loral on September 21, 2004 07:06 AM</strong></p>
<p>No-drop 69-70 spell only become a problem if they are not dropped by single-group mobs in open zones.  I see no problem with requiring people to hunt for high level spells as long as options are available to single-group hunters. It was very difficult for players to get level 65 spells in Planes of Power because they were either dropping in locked zones or off of raid-level boss mobs.  If non-raiders aren't able to get 69 to 70 spells I will definitely bring it up.</p>

<p>The best thing we can do with the task system is send detailed feedback on the difficulty of the tasks.  Again, a wide gap between raiders and non-raiders makes balancing tasks a bit difficult.  Send feedback and we can hope the existing tasks get balanced while new tasks get added.</p>

<p>I can't speak for all classes but I like the cleric AAs.  There are quite a few upgrades to previous AAs and a few unique ones I look forward to.  I don't know enough about other class AAs to speak to them.  I don't expect to see classes branching out in whole new directions this late in the game, however.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Redcloud on September 21, 2004 07:46 AM</strong></p>
<p>Aquiring 5 or 6 spells x 5 from mobs with the rampant mob stealing, training occuring in WoS or the likes is a major PITA at the moment.</p>

<p>SoE should have made 3 from merchants per level available directly and 2 or 3 dropped. That many runes for so many people at the same time is looking for trouble and seeking interplayer frictions.</p>

<p>Bad move.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Teremar on September 21, 2004 11:50 AM</strong></p>
<p>I'm rather surprised you're giving SOE a pass on the task system Loral. This was billed as the great solution for the time-limited player. So far it looks like nothing of the sort, and a few tweaks won't fix it.</p>

<p>I've got to admit I have yet to try it--I just barely bought OoW. But I had some hopes for the system and read a lot about it, and what I read is what led me to not try it my first night.</p>

<p>Tasks are supposed to give people something to do when they can only play for a short period, but people are reporting that they take 2-3 hours. Much of that is just getting enough of the right kind of mob to spawn, so it's not reducible.</p>

<p>They're supposed to be soloable, but most people are having great difficulty soloing them if they succeed at all. The best results seem to come from forming groups of people trying to do the same task. Raid gear helps a lot, of course.</p>

<p>They're supposed to be doable by all classes, but people are finding that abilities like track, invis, SoW, and gate make a huge difference in your ability to do them with reasonable risk and in a reasonable amount of time. In general the classes that solo well in other content have a huge advantage in doing tasks.</p>

<p>A particular no-brainer is the zones they use. There simply shouldn't be any tasks that tell you to go to Sleeper's Tomb or Veeshan's Peak. Even Droga is dubious; its one-way nature makes it pretty scary for classes without invis or gate. But that's the easiest thing to fix.</p>

<p>Now maybe I'm missing something here, please say so if I am. But it seems to me that unless SOE comes up with a whole new set of fundamentally different tasks, they won't help the time-limited player at all. If you can do a task, you can go solo or find a group (and doing so is a better option, which should not change).</p>

<p>The task system is in grave danger of being a complete waste of developer time. And the time-limited player still has nothing--it seems to me that Loral's evil agenda has been frustrated again.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Tobalus Turbulent on September 21, 2004 12:04 PM</strong></p>
<p>I really disagree with your comments regarding the task system. I played Star Wars Galaxies a lot when it first came out and was expecting something like that. Instead of something that non-soloing classes could do, the first level of the task for each character at each level i tried (16-41) was scout something out (doable if you have scouting abilities eg invis, sow, not so good for a cleric, but my druid was fine, as was my necro. The next step was "kill 10 red mobs" ... my necro character was assigned drixies, which don't tend to be found alone, my druid and cleric were assigned drachnids, which really are a group effort (casters that see invis, and used to slaughter the newbies as they ran towards LOIO).</p>

<p>The 59 druid, despite being told by each taskmaster "try someone else", never found one. I believe the last taskmaster is in overthere. The ones in the dreadlands were a nightmare, as my track has limited range, "find" pointed straight out the ground, and it's a huge zone. With see invis monsters. </p>

<p>On the other hand, he got a bit of xp fighting his way to a taskmaster who turned out to be next to KC, which would you think have been a useful bit of information to actually tell people, ie, he's next to karnor's castle, the place on your maps, in eq atlas, that you probably grinded for years if you are an old hand. Unfortunately the only thing the taskmasters in DL say is "sorry nothing for you". </p>

<p>I haven't bothered on the tasks because i can only do them by powerlevelling using my second account, which by definition means they are broken, or by grouping, which is directly not what was advertised as required, and in general, if you couldn't solo before, you won't be able to do these tasks now. </p>

<p>On the other hand, I have talked to quite a few of the post 66 crowd who find them easy and a great way of getting xp on top of what they were doing anyway, so if you are in that category, this is a great expansion, but if you are a time limited player, yet again you have been ignored.</p>

<p>And don't tell me ldon was more than a small step in the right direction. Post 65, there are lots of ppl lfg, but i routinely see nobody lfg at my level ranges for all but my druid, and if noone wants to join you, you have no ldon, no fast track to the levels where groups can be found.</p>

<p>Maybe it's because I'm on rodcet nife but i'm serious about this. An hour to organise a half hour ldon is not unusual and one time i just asked someone to join for a few minutes and 2 boxed mmc with my cleric and warrior which actually worked really well. Admittedly that was a normal and the warr was 27, and we both had temp. 2 boxing is not a lot of fun for me, however, it's hard work, and while i love the disciplines etc, they do mean you should be focused on one character at a time. Without 3 accounts a lot of lower level people don't do ldon, they grind in pc to 25 or 30, do marus or highkeep, then DSP, etc, and ldon's get passed over as not worth it. I can only speak for   my server and i hope they get used more on morden rasp or whatever.</p>

<p>It's 2 am sydney time. Not sure of the time in your neck of the woods. Checked my 42 shm. # lfg = 0. # lfp = 0.</p>

<p>Checked 16 rogue; lfg = 1 , lfp = 0</p>

<p>59 druid: 6 lfg, 0 lfp.</p>

<p>Now remember how at the convention SOE said most players were 30-50...</p>

<p>G'day. If you are an Oz player on Roc Nife its prolly very tough for you. My guild recently got a new member from that server and he said it was dead in Oz primetime.</p>

<p>Suggest you move servers or level up a character where theres a decent Oz guild for your playstyle.</p>

<p>I must say that the Task system is no where near what they had advertised it as. I am a 65 Druid and the first task was easy enough but took around 4 hours to do. Because I went to Mistmoore to kill something and if you have 30 people camping the same Mobs the odds of catching one are slim. The second Task requires going deep into Droga to kill Mobs that aren't always up and randomly pop all over the zone. Even @ 65 I had camped an area for an hour or so and had a wanderer attack me and bring a few friends who eventually brought a few more because trying to keep them all rooted long enough to kill them didn't work out. Eventually they got the Best of me and I went down. There is no way this is something to kill time while waiting for a group and the reward is worthless. If I have time to kill I can go elsewhere get more money and exp in a far shorter time. In the Four hours it took to do my very first task which earned me 116pp and maybe 1/4th of a yellow, I could have earned 1-2kpp and gotten at least a full yellow Bubble of exp to boot. As for the rest of the Expansion I gave up trying it out and went back to Trade-Skilling unless involved in a guild Raid. I Just don't have time to sit around getting no exp looking for a group and then waiting for it to get together and off and running. I have waited over 2 hours in a group because without a Slower you need a full fledged Cleric in all the 65+ zones, even LDoN. I think when WoW comes Sony can Kiss my Arse. It is way more player friendly and doesn't at this point cater to huge powerfull guilds and place priority on grouping or having certain classes. Eq will be dead after WoW and EQ2 come out anyway. Now Flame away :)</p>

<p>I don't give SOE a free pass on the task system but I can only test it as I can.  I was able to do 65 tasks in both Skyfire and Droga.  I was able to do them in about two hours, but the lack of a timer lets me do them when I wish and sit on them if I have to camp or I get a group.  I found that duoing the tasks makes them a LOT easier.  I hunted with a monk and we finished off the Droga task in short order.</p>

<p>When you get a task that requires you to go into a locked zone or ends up being too hard, send feedback.</p>

<p>"I have waited over 2 hours in a group because without a Slower you need a full fledged Cleric in all the 65+ zones, even LDoN."</p>

<p>Yes.  If you want to group well you will need either an enchanter or a beastlord or a shaman or or a bard or a cleric.  That doesn't sound like a bottleneck to me.  All successful groups need four things:  Healing, Crowd Control, Tanking, and Damage.   None of these are exclusive to one class.  Any one of at least three classes can fill the spots.</p>

<p>SOE can improve the task system a lot.  I would like to see instanced encounters locked to the triggering player, group, or raid.  Scripted events offer a lot of advantages.  The current task system has a lot to offer but it won't solve all of the world's woes when it comes to soloing.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Blamfoozle on September 21, 2004 02:56 PM</strong></p>
<p>Torbalus, that last Taskmaster is the Iksar vendor near "the mud pit". His name starts with "Klok", as all Iksar vendors should.</p>

<p>I agree that the Task system has been quite a disappointment - it was bad in beta (and I /feedbacked it) and it was the same then as it is now.</p>

<p>I agree with Loral on much of the rest of what he said though, I'm enjoying Omens quite a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Loral on September 21, 2004 03:08 PM</strong></p>
<p>The task system is not the same as it was in Beta.  In Beta, the tasks had a time limit between 60 and 90 minutes.  If you camped, you failed the task.  There were 65 tasks in the Planes that were far too hard and often required access to locked areas.</p>

<p>About a week before release I tested it again.  The timers were removed.  People could camp out in the middle and start it up again later.  The tasks in PoP were shut off and 65s were refocused to the Dreadlands / Overthere tasks.</p>

<p>The task system is never meant to take the place of grouping, although it does allow for a pair of characters to get together and finish off tasks.  If you want the task system to improve, send detailed feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Naladini on September 21, 2004 03:56 PM</strong></p>
<p>The important thing to remember is that we need to be fair about the task system. It was a huge undertaking for SOE, and they worked very hard to release it for all levels at the time of the OoW launch (original statements said the system would be live for level 50 at launch). There were a few of us "louder" casual type players that made a big deal of extending the system @ launch, and I'm happy to see they were able to get it done. </p>

<p>Allow some time for tuning on this and hopefully things will get a lot better. They seem to have decided to err on the side of caution and less reward, which is probably better than what happened with the Tribute system when it went live with GoD. </p>

<p>Personally, I'm hoping that the task system will evolve to be more like the systems in other games, where there is a Significant XP Reward for completing the task successfully, with less dependence on killing X number of mobs to account for the majority of experience gained.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Teremar on September 21, 2004 04:15 PM</strong></p>
<p>I don't understand what the task system is for then.  I thought it was for people who play in short sessions and thus don't have time to group.</p>

<p>I'm glad you can do part of it in one session, log off, and do the rest later. But if you need even one other person to help you do it, that really limits what you can do in 30-60 minutes.</p>

<p>I guess if you've got a friend you want to play with for a couple hours but don't want to bother with the rest of a group a task could be good, though I wouldn't call a lack of opportunities in such situations one of EQ's top problems.</p>

<p>Just to round things out: I'm very pleased OoW is allowing non-raiders to progress again (which is why I bought it), but I'm worried about access to 69-70 spells. We'll have to see where they actually drop. And I'm really miffed about the massive charm nerf. Yes, something had to be done, but what they did is so bad they might as well have flagged everything in OoW immune to charm. But that's another topic...</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Abakar on September 21, 2004 05:29 PM</strong></p>
<p>Well I hope they fix the tasks soon I was so damn excited that my 65 Cleric could do something ALONE for once and get EXP... What a joke. I talk to the taskmaster in Kaladim he say's he can't help try these taskmasters so off I go to dread lands. Ok here is my task to do alone. Did I say alone??? Talk to so and so, ok done. Oh by the way go to Sky fire Mountains She says to me. ALL Clerics remember SF and hours of hunting shards . KILL (10) Sky ash Drakes. What?? Ok I'm 65 should be easy kill 10 green mobs cool.  Wrong answer!! One how do I find them?? After about 45 mins I found one, it was light blue. OK I think great I'll get about 2% AA also nice. So I cast Tar nation Boom 330 damage and he is immune to the stun portion of this spell. Damn immune to stuns!! Ok I'll root and nuke. Immune to changes in his run speed!! Ok I'll melee him. OK I'm all off sudden at 30% health and my buffs are gone, forgot about those pesky chromadacs that dispel. So there's only one thing to do...RUN AWAY. So much for my simple task. I was hoping for run here get this do this brew that cook this kill mob X get EXP. But as it stands now without help I can't do a task. OH the expected reward 106 pp and exp it says. A LDON adventure will take less time and yield more reward.</p>

<p>While I agree OOW is worth 30 dollars and a vast improvement over Gates (for my playstyle anyway).  I think you are suger coating the failure of the task system. It is obviously broken.  Saying you can use non standard group to do them is silly. Where they not intened as something someone cousd do SOLO while LFG?</p>

<p><br />
Anyone that bought the expansion primarily for task got ripped I would think.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Solistic on September 21, 2004 06:51 PM</strong></p>
<p>I have now completed 8 tasks (solo'd and duo’d) on a level 12 Beast Lord, level 29 Rogue, level 52 Monk, and level 65 Cleric. Most of them I did in the couple of hours I have before I leave for work, and most of them were on my level 12 and 29 toons. My hand my down armor and weapons are in the class of gnome skin, and acrylia reinforced, so my lower level toons are not twinked.  <br />
I had a blast doing them, I have died a few times, and but what the heck, I would run back get my body and continue on.  I have duo’d a couple, found it really helps on the higher leveled tasks.</p>

<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Beewell on September 22, 2004 08:18 AM</strong></p>
<p>65 cleric (now 66) tried the task system. Took a no time limit task which I was able to complete over several days...working on it when I was unable to find a group. Several scouting steps which involved nothing more then invis potion and one kill ten old wurms step. Soloing ten old wurms (mostly lb) was not easy..but it was doable. Avoiding the adds just meant I had to run a few times. All in all gave me something to do when group was not avail. Perhaps trying several different tasks or changing the expectation that the task can be completed in one play session might make them more enjoyable for you!! For my money is nice to have something to work on when I can't find a group!!!</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Cmgrn on September 22, 2004 10:46 AM</strong></p>
<p>THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH for commenting on the lack of information to help people with their graphics settings. When I started playing I just played. Now I constantly wonder if the problems I experience are due to a graphics setting I dont know about or would even understand if I did. Sometimes the moon is a purple glowing ball. Sometimes I have lag in an apparently empty zone. Sometimes my FIND path is a wispy line of sparkles that lead nowhere and constantly fade away if I move too fast. SOE knows my computer better than I do. I wish they would do an optimal settings for the game based on your computer or at least have a PDF explaining how to set the options in a simple (jr high/high school level) way to help you understand how the options will/can affect the game. At the moment, everytime I start the game I get a window telling me to upgrade my Nvidia driver to 6177 (i think) BUT at Nvidia it says that is for a XP/2000 machine and I have a 98 machine and have installed the latest Nvidia version for MY machine (6176 i think). A knowledgeable friend says DO NOT try to install 6177, the XP/2000 driver, just to keep up with what the SOE message says I need. Soooo, I really appreciate that you pointed out that the display options need more user friendly attention or maybe auto adjusting. I only hope SOE, in their march for better graphics, can take time to help educate us players/payers better because I want to play a game not become a graphics expert. Thanx.</p>

<p>As far as the task system goes, I don't think it's a total failure, but it leaves a lot to be desired.</p>

<p>From what I've been able to tell, the degree of difficulty involved in completing a task is not only dependant on your class, but also on the location you get.  For example, as a paladin, I can (barely) solo tasks in Chardok and Skyfire, but Droga is out of the question.  Now, I'm level 63, with 44 AAs, and I consider myself to have about average gear - no ornate or anything like that, and certainly no real raid gear.</p>

<p>So I suppose that tasks are very soloable for most any class - if you're in, say, a Tier 3/Elemental raiding guild, or if you bought a bunch of platinum to spend at the bazaar.</p>

<p>For most average players, let alone casual ones, the tasks simply can not be done solo in any reasonable amount of time.  I have a friend who's a 65 rogue - and where I was struggling with tasks, he simply couldn't kill the mobs.  To finish his task, we had to team up and duo it.</p>

<p>I like tasks, but they are not solo content for most people, and that is a problem.  Basically all that tasks have accomplished is to give a small, unbalanced group that would have trouble with an LDON something to do instead.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the expansion, I am enjoying it.  It feels more balanced than Gates which is good - it's still challenging, but not sadistically so.  One complaint I hear a lot of now though is that the exp in Gates zones (which are harder) is worse than the exp in Omens zones.  I think now that Omens is out and the level cap has been raised, Gates needs to get its exp retuned for the post-65 folks.</p>

<p>I think there are a lot of places for improvement in Omens, but overall I think it has brought a lot to the game, and apart from the possible impact of the new epics (which have ungodly stats), there doesn't seem to be much here which will unbalance things more than they already were.  Loral's got a good point that in a lot of ways this lets non-raiders catch up some in terms of gear, and that helps quite a bit for evening things out.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Horzek on September 22, 2004 04:16 PM</strong></p>
<p>Like Loral and as a fellow Cleric I find I like the new AA skills quite a lot.  I only had 9 points saved up and put them into the new spell slot, better healing, and the ability to crit on my HoT.  That HoT crit is a neat one btw.  The only real problem with it is that you cant really tell how much it is healing for.  I whipped out my mana stone and began to tap with it until I fell unconcious and then when I woke up I gave the HoT a try.  I was healed from barely concious to full health, 5200 hps at the time just as the hot finally wore off.  I have to like that.  For a low aggro spell it seems to be second only to CH in mana efficiency now.  I should mention I have extended duration out to 60%.</p>

<p>  The other thing I really like is that I can now stop buying peris all the time.  I know that inspite of donations and even pimping HoV in PoK from time to time I have spent thousands on peris.  No more.. </p>

<p>  On the other hand, I have foune a new way to  spend all my money.  INVIS potions.  WE clerics really really need some form of invis.  I have spend half my evening in GoD just running back and forth to get to my corpses in Barindu because invis breaks and I get killed again and again.  No doubt some developer somewhere thinks getting clerics killed is funny because many of the OOW zones are extremely bad on the necessity of keeping invis up at all times.  I think I may have to bind myself by the potion vendor.</p>

<p>  I do like the ability to get spells in OOW much better than I did in the GoD zones.  Its been 6 months now in GoD and I finally got my first spell.  I dont have any OOW spells yet but in only two or three days there in the WoS zone I have been able to at least roll on a couple spell drops.  Much better in my book.  The game is just not much fun if you can not get your class defining spells.  I can hardly wait for the new cleric hp buff spell.. /drools</p>

<p>We are a small guild ( older aged mature players ), hunt as a group, and spend many hours playing eq.  The first while we were having a lot of fun exploring and killing some ph's to get the named to pop.  We got a few nice drops and some spell runes.  However after the patch we have killed the ph's time and time again only to find the Named to have become so rare we hesitate to go there now.  In one instance we killed ph's 17 times with no Named showing up.  In one cave we have killed the ph for 6 hours now ( 20 mins spawn time ) with no Named showing up.  As ussual nice drops to start the expansion, then patch and nerf the hell out of the drops.</p>

<p>Since the patch we have fought steady and got only 2 spell runes and  2 repeats of a mask.</p>

<p>Wall of Slaughter is worse than some old zones for trains wiping out groups camping an area.</p>

<p>Although OoW has many many nice features it maintains a mentality by some of the Devs that only large raiding guilds will have access to better gear etc.  Nice stuff for small guilds and groups will be rare drops.</p>

     Contrary to many of the postings I have seen thus far I must give applaud the developers for the new task system.  This system was designed for me as I can only play for only a couple hours at a time. Tasks are split in to low, med, and hard.  Risk vs. Reward.  I always choose the least difficult.  What I enjoy about this system is that I know exactly where I need to go and what I need to do. Unlike many obscure quests. The task interface is great is states the zone in which I need to go.  Oh and I can use the FIND button to find the NPC's giving out the Tasks, Great! I have one 'beef' about this system. Lets say I have a task with three parts. The first task requires me to kill 10 creatures.  This is very time consuming if I need to solo (which I have) Takes about 2 hours with (virtue/C3) and then I need to log off..I'm out of time, but I don't get any satisfaction by completing that part of the task because the only experience I receive is from my killings and the corpse's loot.  This is to say I would like receiving some exp/platinum for completing the first part of the task before I have to log off.  To complete a full task takes me at least 2 days. Please for a more satisfying experience provide some benefit for completing the subtasks within the overall whole tasks to provide a sense of a good hard days work :).  Again I love the task ease of use and I’ll continue using it.  <br />
P.S<br />
 I hated normal quests the last quest I did was in 1999 for the short sword or morin. Nuff said.</p>

<p>the risk versus reward in fire is fine. yes its the best XP in the game, no people shouldnt be waiting in lines.  there is plenty of alternative and to do it as well as folks did do it you need the best GoD gear.  those are the folks who dod 70 in 1 day.  the same geared folks who did 65 in one day when PoP came out. they had full VT gear and ssra weaponry.  its fine.</p>

<p>"Omens is a great expansion. Excellent unflagged and unrestricted zones, new levels and AAs, new shiny loot for both single-group hunters and raiders, top-notch graphics, and a lot of fun new features make Omens one of the best Everquest expansions."</p>

<p>This kind of enthusiasm sounds like it was concocted at Sony's promotion and marketing department. Omens *needed* to be a fantastic expansion in order to continue to make EverQuest viable. I do not think that Omens will turn out to be the masterpiece that you claim it is.</p>

<p>Please Loral, less sucking up to SOE and more unbiased reporting on EQ news. I wonder how long you would keep your priviledge status as a EverQuest Community Representative with access to SOE's private boards if you had posted a negative review of Omens?</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Frankie on September 23, 2004 06:19 PM</strong></p>
<p>As I suspected SOE is already pointing to this "glowing" review of Omens on their official website. Nice to know that Loral and Mobhunter are now part of the pro-SOE family of EQ websites.</p>

<p>Prediction: It will only be a matter of time before Loral will be employed at SOE following in the footsteps of the last sellout Moorgard.</p>

<p>I would not give glowing comments if I did not feel they were deserved.  When I find problems with the game I discuss them here and send feedback to SOE.  Some get fixed, some do not.</p>

<p>Considering the general negative feedback other Summit folks give SOE, I don't think I would be kicked out of the circle for criticism.</p>

<p>I always believe in addressing specific problems in as objective a manner as one can.  Others, including quite a few posters to these articles, would rather paint the whole picture black over a few specific detailed problems.</p>

<p>Which question are you more likely to want to work with:</p>

<p>"Omens is a waste of money.  SOE proved once again that it only caters to the ubers by placing level 69 and 70 runes on high-end ubermobs.  Any day now I'm going over to WoW."</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>"69 and 70 spells seem to drop only off of raid-level mobs.  High level non-raiders should have greater access to these spells.  Please add 69 and 70 runes to single-group accessible mobs."</p>

<p>Note, I don't know if this is true.  I haven't heard where 69 and 70 spells drop but I hear whispers that they already do drop off of single-group mobs.</p>

<p>Specific and positive feedback is far more effective than the constant draining negativity a lot of people seem to fester in.</p>

<p>I wrote a glowing review because I think Omens of War is the best expansion since Everquest's release.  I wouldn't write it if I didn't think it was true.  As problems begin to surface, you can bet that I will mention them.  What I won't do is cry and moan and wail about a game I pay for every month.  If I felt that way, I'd quit.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by:  on September 23, 2004 11:27 PM</strong></p>
<p>"Vsync may be the most important feature to make Everquest look solid on faster machines and the only way to enable it is to put a "Vsync=1" variable under "Defaults" in one's eqclient.ini file."</p>

<p>Just curious, how does Vsync make the game "look solid" on faster machines? What's that mean?</p>

<p>You can also force Vsync on in your video driver setup too.</p>

<p>Why not just make the core spells tradeable like it was in the many "classic" expansions that many of us were asking for when they went back to the drawing board with Omens?</p>

<p>Single groupable mobs does not go far enough IMHO. Tradeable spells (or runes) is the answer.</p>

<p>Gear, mana, mana regen, foci, etc. are what will set the players apart. Limiting access to core spells is flat out wrong, unless they are labelled as ancient.</p>

<p>Vsync will prevent tearing on the screen. </p>

<p>You can also get the same effect by setting the max frame rate on the display options to any number that is lower than your current refresh rate.</p>

<p>I too am enjoying OOW and primarily appreciate the task system. I play a hydra of 5 chars and am using it to level up my 2 lowest chars a bit. </p>

<p>I think Omens is one of the top 4 expansions.  However I do think the review does fail to mention some serious problems with it.</p>

<p>First of all there was a very serious experience loss bug with resurrections. Several of my guild members would get a 96% res, loot their corpses and then notice they didn't get their experience back.  It took several days for SOE to acknowledge the problem and put a warning in the /motd.   To SOE's credit once acknowledged they did get this problem fixed fairly quickly.</p>

<p>Another bug that still exists is that Beastlords have been noticing their characters missing from their character select screens.  To date two Beastlords in my guild still do not have their characters back.</p>

<p>Yet another problem is that a lot of people are having trouble with getting their graphics cards to work.  Some people with Win 98/Me are being told to download Nvidia 61.77 drivers but those drivers do not exist for their O/S.  The last I was able to check, Nvidia was only up to 61.76 for the Win 95/98/Me line.</p>

<p>On the subject of level 69 and 70 runes.  I can report that one cleric in my guild got a Glowing (Level 70) off a one grouped named in Proving Grounds.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Scott Adams on September 24, 2004 07:08 PM</strong></p>
<p>Phred,</p>

<p>Many folks seemed surprised that I like to play more than one character at a time. As I have explained many times on TNZ I do it for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>1) I have limited playtime and do not like to wait for a group. </p>

<p>2) I enjoy the challenge of being able to run more than one character at a time</p>

<p>3) I love having all the utility spells and being able to help out others as I play.</p>

<p>4) I enjoy the constant flow of playing mutiple chars and not having to be sitting and waiting to do something. Call me ADHD :)</p>

<p>I am also not anto-scocial, I frequently fill my 6th team slot with old friends and new ones. I normally will drop a camp to go help someone that needs it. </p>

<p>If I did not think this game was enjoyable and reasonable priced I would not play it.</p>

<p>I am sorry you think me sick. I am an AESK and like to build my chars, explore the worlds and help others while not doing anything to rile others. For me a co-operative carebear game like EQ is wonderful. I tend to be the ultimate carebear :)</p>

<p>I am very happy to see OOW come out with things aimed at the 20-65 non raiding casual players. Hopefully this will continue in future expansions. All in all I was very happy with OOW, much more so than G0D which had very little for me to use.</p>

<p>I have always appreciated Mobhunter's balanced and well thought out reviews, critisism and comments. The current editor seems to have taken over the spirit and pen of Moorgard. Wonderful!</p>

<p>I'd 5box if i had the money and the gear, but I'm not really sure how it's even possible. I 2 box with my druid and monk, and it's a lot of hard work. It doesn't help being in sydney, so that the lag makes autofollow impossible... I use one pc and EQW, so maybe it would work with a bunch of pc's and a really nifty controller/s, I don't know. Maybe if you had a macroing program to get the tank to taunt / bash / kick in it's cycle, and could focus on the caster's instead??</p>

<p>If others want to group with me I tend to one box, but I have had people who wanted to group regardless, which was great as I would love "inspect buffs" and i can't 2 box leadership points. If I was more effective 2boxing, i don't see why anyone would have a problem grouping with me, and i don't see why anyone would have a problem grouping with someone who has demonstrated the ability to five box..  and i can't see how having someone else 5boxing detracts from someone else's game, especially as a lot of it is now instanced, and it's about the only way you could do some of those tasks in oow anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Inyen on September 25, 2004 07:18 AM</strong></p>
<p>I have read this post with interest.</p>

<p>I for for do like the OOW expansions, but as for lvl 65 to 70 in 2 days, I for one would like to know how it was done, considering the XP is very, very slow after 65. I myself gained about 12% in for hours wiht a full group in Wall of Slaughter.</p>

<p>Yes it will take a while before it settles down, with about 20 to 30 updates, this is typical due to the lack of diversity it would seem when SoE beta test.</p>

<p>The graphics in the OOW zones are great, and the new water and pixel shaders do cause a lot of people a lot of lag problems, as it seems that OOW is really designed for the High End machine and games, I just hope that EQ2 will not be aimed that way.</p>

<p>The new epics have very little or no information from SoE, apart from the little sketches they drew, and then not all were present for the release.</p>

<p>SoE really needs to have a wider variety of people and systems for future testing of software. I even seen on the EQ forum that people dont even believe that they do any beta testing.</p>

<p>I would also like to see SoE drop some of teh flags on the PoP zones, as unless you are in a raiding guild, or someone gets you flag, you are not going to get the Uber armour.</p>

<p>We'll just have to wait and see if SoE will finally start to listen to it's customers, because up until now, they have been doing very little of it.</p>

<p>First person to level 70 was a rogue on Xev done in 21.5 hours after servers came up. The entire group reached 70 shortly after all done in Plane of Fire.</p>

<p>However, the group that did this had at least 3 bots outside of group the entire time.</p>

<p>Well I know whole Walkthrough for sk epic 1.5. And it is quite disapointing ( not the epic, but how you get it). Basically, each step is fight( except one step). mobs hit from 1k to 2k. And how is it average player doable??? I cant kill with my gear "Murkglider breeder" w/o at least 3 groups. Besides, i'm not talking how hard it is to find people willing to help. Basically, You will not see epic unless you are in guild and your guids has at least 40 people. Oh, btw I'd rather camp some ground spawn item that has respawn time 3 days, then look for groups to kill some mob that hits for 1.5k; at least this would be soloable and as hard to get as a fight.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Loral on September 25, 2004 02:50 PM</strong></p>
<p>Omens hasn't been out two weeks yet.  It's too early to gauge the difficulty of Epic 1.5s.  I don't plan on starting mine until I am level 70 with a few more AAs and spells under my belt.  At that point, 1000 point hitting mobs will be like the 600 hitting mobs now.</p>

<p>It was a year and a half after Kunark before I got my epic.  I am prepared to wait until the power of myself and my friends grows.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Siriln on September 26, 2004 10:11 AM</strong></p>
<p>Uhh, not completely sure of the facts involved, but the first person on Erollisi Marr to 70 was a rogue in a Time/GoD guild (one of the top ones on the server - not getting into the argument about who's better than whom...) and he was at 70 in 17.5 hours. *shrug* Needless to say, the Time guilds all XPed at the Tables in Fire almost continously for about a week when OoW came out.  I think they're all in WoS now.</p>

<p>Our guild had two lvl 70 characters within the first two days of the expansion going live. They were at the tables in Fire the entire time. I managed to do it in a week. I was pretty evenly split between Kod`Taz and Plane of Earth for most of it, with one night in Muramite Proving Grounds and the last 60% was done at the tables in Fire. I was one of the folks that was dismayed to hear the level cap was being raised, so I worked hard to get those levels done as quickly as possible in order to not have to worry about them keeping me out of anything.</p>

<p>All that being said, I have enjoyed Omens far more than I have Gates. Omens looks good, plays well, and is just all around more "fun" for me than Gates has been so far. I am in a raiding guild, and I hope that we decide to pass on what we have left to do in Gates (up to Uqua at the moment) and instead look at Omens as our battleground.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by:  on September 27, 2004 02:05 PM</strong></p>
<p>with the obsolete focii effects, why would anyone bother with gates that they already haven't wasted time on..</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by:  on September 27, 2004 02:47 PM</strong></p>
<p>Because of mostly/partially effective focii effects and quarm++ gear off of relatively easy mobs that spawn rapidly.</p>

<p>Aside from that, what does a melee char, care about focii effects? a 220+Hp arm slot item is still a 220+hp arm slot item.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Adam Gilberd on September 27, 2004 03:53 PM</strong></p>
<p>I'm having a great time with the expansion so far.</p>

<p>Positives: <br />
1. Almost no flagging requirements<br />
2. Upgrade gear accessible to non-EP geared single groups<br />
3. Graphics.  Not shadows per se (nice fine point), but more fundamentally the zones and mobs themselves are solid.<br />
4. Spells.  An improvement over PoP (getting duplicates) and GoD (when will I ever see no drop items when I can't get a group there).  OoW 69-70 spells are the exception here.<br />
5. Epic 1.5/2.0.  As a Paladin, and despite some complaints about our focus/clicky, I will definitely be pursuing 1.5.  The level of epic interest among 65+ players I know has been huge.</p>

<p>Room for improvement:<br />
1. Experience (at least in Wall of Slaughter) moves too slow relative to PoF tables, and Vxed/Tipt.  With infrequent access to those zones, I'll take 4-5(?) times as long to hit 70 vs. a player playing those zones.<br />
2. Spell drop frequency.  None off trash, that I've seen.  Intermittent (not always) on named mobs who are tough to tag with 40 in zone.  Plus, I'm now rolling with monks (and I assume other melee) who need for their disciplines.  Played 8-10 hrs in WoS, where I leveled all of 66.  Rolled on three spells, lost all of them.  <br />
3. Travel issues.  Porting to zone is good, but would be even better to have an option to get further than Dranik's Scar via a PoD.  Invis, like w/ GoD, is a must.  Major improvement here would be stackable invis potions.  With no click/spell invis, I'm often carrying two bags full of potions...</p>

<p>"I fully admit to being an EQ Phanboi" This was posted by Loral in the last article comments section (scroll to the bottom). This pretty much explains all the articles on this website and the practically "SOE can do no wrong" attitude. Before someone nitpicks my comment, yes I know Loral does occasionally criticise SOE on some minor issues, but frequently ignores or glosses over major issues and makes excuses for SOE.

<p>Gee, you got me.  I like the game.  Good job sniffing out the clues.  I wouldn't call a post I made a day ago on this very website a Grudge report special.  If I didn't like Everquest, I wouldn't play it and I wouldn't write about it.</p>

<p>Nice little attempt at sarcasm but you know you could at least try to be objective about the game instead of glossing everything over. This website is more fluff than anything else. Really what use are reviews written by someone who tries their hardest to avoid saying much bad?</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: SP on September 28, 2004 11:06 AM</strong></p>
<p>Loral, <br />
I believe the point that is trying to be made is, people used to like to read this news site because it had a truly objective opinion. </p>

<p>Then Moorguard started to write 99% mostly positive reviews of EQ stuff, and then he got a job at Sony.</p>

<p>Coray was 99% negative on sony material, so once again, objectivity right out the window.</p>

<p>Now we're back to 99% positive pro-sony propaganda, except this time, it is so extreme as to turn off anyone who doesn't agree with you.</p>

<p>I'd like to add, that the sole exception where you do not use Sony Propaganda, is with your Agenda to bring the "Casual Crowd" to power in EQ again. This holy crusade of yours is the only point in which you flaunt your greater knowledge of the MMORPG world to Sony (with five easy steps to a million subscribers no less).</p>

<p>Objectivity and Authenticity is the key to a good news/review site. Of course, if you’re looking for a job at Sony, then by all means proceed as planned. Not quite sure lightning will strike twice in one spot, but you never know.</p>

<p>Objectivity is overrated in a review.  You only need to be objective about the facts.  The essence of a review is subjective.  I think how Loral writes is fine, but it would be interesting to see a counterpoint to his positivity, although I think that is likely seen in the rabid fan response.  I will say it is always interesting to see what crowd resorts to attacking the messenger instead of the message first.  I guess we know what side that has always been around these parts.</p>

<p>Also, I think making fun of a guy paying for 5 accounts makes you look not only stupid but also unsuccessful to the point of jealousy.  If EQ to him is worth 2 grand a year then WTF do you care?... by pointing out the "vast" amounts of money he is giving SOE(not near the expense of my 2 season football tickets per year BTW) You only look like a bumpkin, or a child, or possibly some sort of super-bumpkin-childlike-man.</p>

<p>who is more stupid a man paying 50 dollars a month to do something he loves or a man paying 10 to do something he hates??  </p>

<p>Oh well, good luck on the continued success at making the bitter and stupid appear bitter and stupid.</p>

<p>Back again, I have now increased my completed tasks on my little Beast Lord, to 10. She has gone from level 10 to 17 using Tasks.  I have been working on them during the 40 minutes I have before work in the morning.  I enjoy the game and this is a way that I can still play and feel like I have accomplished something.  I have earned enough from looting and task exp. that I have added a  Nathsar bracer, and a pair of  Coterie General Boots. I sometimes get Skin of nature and Sow but otherwise I use my own buffs.   </p>

<p>It has been exciting doing these tasks, I have had to run to the zone line many times, and I have died few times.  I gone to some interesting zones that I have not looked at in a long time. The whole point of the game to me is to have fun, excitement, and adventure.  Not xp grinding day after day just so I can get higher and higher. I love running from zone to zone, finding new places, if I come across something mean and bigger than me, I run.  </p>

<p>Planes of Power I have always felt like I was fighting in a container, you move from one container, back to start and then to the next.  In G. o D. I felt that way a little.  In Omen of Wars I broke out my level 56 Bard and ran everywhere, just looking, (well actually just a lot of places)  I felt like I my bard was level 15 again trying to run across Norath again.  </p>

<p>I am hoping that OoW will bring back that feeling of hair rising on the back of my neck.</p>

Oh it will, more than likely from deadly trains and other rukus from inconsiderate players.</p>

<p>I don't really wish to sit here and defend myself but if I was to write only SOE propaganda, would I leave an open message forum on it?  Why wouldn't I only post my editorials and perhaps a few well-selected positive comments to post?</p>

<p>Let me dispell some myths.</p>

<p>First, I am not trying to get a job with SOE.  Second, SOE only saw two of my Mobhunter articles before I posted them.  Of these two articles, the Omens preview and the post-summit article, SOE gave me no change or feedback.  I sent them to SOE for fact-checks and to make sure I did not violate the Beta non-disclosure Agreement.  SOE sees every other article the same time you folks do.  SOE does not tell me what to write and I never wrote anything I did not believe or agree with.</p>

<p>I have my views of the game.  I try to look at the game with a wide lense and I write about the topics I feel matter most.  I don't gloss over problems that I believe affect the whole game, but I'm not going to poke and prod every bug that SOE is already working on and will probably get fixed by the time I get my article posted.</p>

<p>Instead of worrying about my (unadmitted) objectivity, why not talk about the details of the problems we see.  Discuss the large problems EQ faces in detail and offer up possible solutions to these problems (other than quit and play City of Heroes).</p>

<p>Instead of painting with broad strokes about my character, why not discuss the details of the game?</p>

<p>Are you angry about the level 66 - 70 people losing their level?  Is Riftseekers inaccessible for level 70 non-raiders?  Are task still too hard even after we send feedback?  Is two weeks too soon for someone to already be in Anguish?  Are we tired of not hearing more about the new models?</p>

<p>How can people find groups easier?  What can we do to convince people to get out of Wall of Slaughter and explore Ruined City of Dranik?  Should new items be added to LDON or should it be left alone?</p>

<p>There are so many more interesting topics than just whether Loral is seeking a job with SOE or not.  I'm not here to talk about me, I'm here to talk about Everquest.  So lets talk about Everquest.</p>

<p>If you have topics you want to discuss and think they're relevant to the majority of Everquest players, please email me loral@loralciriclight.com.</p>

<p>And yes.  If you really hate the game that much, get your friends' email addresses and stop paying $12 for something you hate.  EZboard and AIM are free.</p>

<p>You all are being pretty unfair to Loral here. Think on this: If he were really in Sony's pocket, (or was trying to be), do you think he'd be letting all of us make our (more negative)comments? I'd have to say that, between his article, and the user opinions posted after, we all can get a pretty general idea on what this expansion is like. That's what we came here for. Isn't it?</p>

<p>Leave the poor guy alone, he did good, and that's that.</p>

<p>Whoever posted as Phred further up insulting Scott Adams was not me, former registered poster named Phred on mobhunter, but some chickenshit hiding behind the poor authentication on this new board to pose as me.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Karadun on October  1, 2004 09:22 AM</strong></p>
<p>Hey Phred, why would anyone want to pose as you? You are nobody anymore then anyone else on this board is. Hell we don't even know if "Scott Adams" above is really "the" Scott Adams do we?</p>

<p>I love how many people that play EQ think they are so important where as in real life your ability to play EQ is thought of as well as that Fantasy Footbal geek in the new Best Buy commercial. Don't go getting all full of yourself, you really don't matter at all nor do your EQ acomplishments.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Phred on October  2, 2004 09:16 AM</strong></p>
<p>Thank's for the enlightening information but as I did get some email from people bitching me out for making a post I didn't make I wanted to clarify it to the people that do know me. If you don't that's your tough luck.</p>
