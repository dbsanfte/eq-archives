			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have started and abandoned several posts over the past few weeks. I knew I needed to write something&#8230; but what story did I want to tell? An angry tirade about being screwed over? A scathing tell-all about what really happened inside 38? A self-pitying plea for a job? So many emotions inside me, a turbid swirl screaming for an outlet.</p>
<p>So this is what I&#8217;ve come up with.</p>
<p><span id="more-703"></span></p>
<p>It has been nearly a month since all of this began. Try to picture that; a month ago, everything seemed fine. Over the past 30 days, so many rugs have been pulled out from under me and my colleagues that I&#8217;ve lost count of the threads. We&#8217;ve lost our income, our insurance, our camaraderie. It&#8217;s been one slap in the face after another, and 38&#8242;s bankruptcy keeps finding new ways to hurt us all; just yesterday, we found out that our 401K funds are frozen for an indeterminate amount of time. I have no doubt that things will get more painful before they get better.</p>
<p>Emotions? Had &#8216;em all. Screaming rage, blinding tears, pity for myself, pity for others, defiance, numbness, fear. To an outsider, I can see how some of this might seem silly. It&#8217;s just a video game, right? People lose their jobs all the time&#8211;suck it up and find another one.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s just not that simple. I&#8217;ve spent nearly six years of my life building this company and working on this game. I&#8217;ve forged some very deep, personal bonds with the people I&#8217;ve worked with. Over this time, my life has changed in profound ways. I&#8217;ve seen my child come into this world. I nearly lost her and my wife in a fatal car crash. I&#8217;ve held my mother in my arms as she lay dying. And through all those things, I&#8217;ve been helped and comforted by Curt Schilling and my teammates at 38.</p>
<p>Work was tough and the pressure relentless, but so, so joyous as well. I got to work hands-on with R. A. Salvatore, taking the framework of a world he created and building it into something huge, ambitious, and wonderful. I watched amazing artists undertake the most startling transformation of concept paintings into game assets that I&#8217;ve ever seen. Stories born as mere fragments of ideas were coming to life all around me in a studio full of people who embraced their role as storytellers.  It was immensely gratifying.</p>
<p>And then it was gone. The poultice ripped away, a mortal wound left to fester. The grief is very real; this may sound melodramatic to those of you on the outside, but this experience feels much like the death of a dear friend. I&#8217;ve said before that shipping a game after years of work makes you feel like you&#8217;ve been through a war, and the people you fought alongside are the only ones who really know what you&#8217;ve been through. In this case, to work six years on a dream and have it almost come to life, only to lose it suddenly, is a very real psychological trauma. Despite the dozens of articles written on the demise of 38, the only people who really understand are the ones who make up this now fractured fraternity that was once a great team.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been hard to find the time necessary to process it all. As soon as the downward spiral began, we were plunged into a frantic period of resume building, job fairs, phone calls, and unemployment filings. The week of E3 was the first stretch where things got quiet&#8211;disturbingly quiet. For me, not yet having secured a new job, that&#8217;s when the anxiety really took hold.</p>
<p>Even after growing numb to the headlines and news broadcasts, little stings come along with clever ways to hurt me. I still find myself looking at my phone for new email. It used to be that pretty much any hour of the day or night, there was something to read: a bug report, a piece of art to approve, some copy to review, a silly thread on our miscellaneous list, or a NSFW link from a cohort. The absence of that 38 mailbox aches like a phantom limb.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still angry about lots of things (did I mention being screwed out of thousands of dollars?), and I still get so very sad when I think of all that could have been. But mostly I&#8217;ve reached acceptance. Not an acceptance of being at peace&#8211;I don&#8217;t think I can ever be at peace with what happened&#8211;but more an acceptance of resignation, the realization that things are so utterly fucked up as to be completely beyond my control. There&#8217;s simply nothing I can do to save the company, to save the story of Amalur, to recover anything that I&#8217;ve lost. All I can do at this point is to look out for my brothers and sisters, the comrades I&#8217;ve been in the trenches with for all these years. I can try to help them however I can, even as I scramble to find my own landing place. Because if there&#8217;s one truth I&#8217;ve learned over all my years of work, across the many careers I&#8217;ve undertaken, it&#8217;s that the connections you make with good people end up being the greatest treasure.</p>
<p>I have lost something that I deeply loved. I&#8217;m constantly surrounded by reminders of that loss, both in the abstract sense, in stories online and in the media, and by the literal presence of boxes surrounding the desk where I write this post, boxes filled with the books, toys, and bric-a-brac that used to decorate my office at One Empire Plaza. The body doesn&#8217;t feel cold yet, but I have to bury it and move on.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s what I must do. I have to let go. That doesn&#8217;t mean the emotions won&#8217;t be there&#8211;those demons will swirl around inside me for a long, long time. But I have to look forward, to restore belief in my talents and abilities, to focus on building a new future. To be sure, it won&#8217;t be the future I planned six years ago&#8211;that dream is gone. But it will be something good, something new to love, something new to believe in. Because I&#8217;ve learned a private truth, a truth I probably tried to deny for a long time: I&#8217;m a person who needs to believe in something bigger than myself.</p>
<p>Despite all the pain, this lesson is a positive I can carry with me for the rest of my days. And that&#8217;s a tangible blessing, a gift to help me smile through the tears.</p>
<p>Goodbye, 38. Goodbye, Amalur. I have loved you more dearly than I can ever say. And I will let you go.</p>

We haven&#8217;t talked much about it, but given all that&#8217;s been said about us in the last few days, we wanted to answer the best way we knew how.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s very easy for game designers to come up with lofty, complex ideas. This is especially true for people who take a support role on one project and suddenly find themselves in charge of something on another title; they get the impulse to put their stamp on everything, to show the world how clever they are by embroiling players in complex plots and multi-layered gameplay.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the best thing you can do is take a step back and simplify things.</p>
<p>Every night at dinner, I get asked by my toddler, &#8220;Daddy, what did you do at work today?&#8221; My answers vary, but often I mention how I looked at pictures of monsters (character art review), saw some fantastic place (environment art review), read a story about some great battle (narrative review), and so forth. Occasionally I even get to talk about something I wrote myself! If I say I looked at a monster, I&#8217;m asked &#8220;Was he good or bad?&#8221; If I say bad, I&#8217;m asked &#8220;What does he want to get?&#8221; And I usually give a little story about that creature&#8217;s motivations.</p>
<p>After this ritual had been going on a while, it suddenly struck me how incredibly useful this was to me as a storyteller and designer. If I can&#8217;t boil the plots and motivations of our characters down into simple terms that a child can understand, we&#8217;ve probably over-designed the experience&#8211;which means grown-up players won&#8217;t get it, either.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say stories and gameplay have to be written like an episode of Dora the Explorer. The nuances and depth should be there for those who want to delve into them. But at the base level, the primary motivations of your characters and storylines need to be clear and obvious. Otherwise, all the fancy dialogue and pretty graphics won&#8217;t matter, because the drama of your game won&#8217;t resonate with the audience.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a title="The scandal! The infamy!" href="http://ealouse.wordpress.com/2010/10/12/hello-world/" target="_blank">EA Louse blog</a> is all the rage these days, and I&#8217;m sure anyone who visits this site will have encountered many observations on its content already. I can neither confirm nor deny the author&#8217;s assertions, though of course over the years I&#8217;ve heard my share of stories about the dark secrets of various game projects. It&#8217;s a small industry, after all.</p>
<p>This phenomenon&#8211;disgruntled employees <a title="More scandal!" href="http://icefrogtruth.blogspot.com/2010/10/truth.html" target="_blank">venting anonymously</a> for all the world to see&#8211;is hardly new or unique. Any time an MMO or its developer hasn&#8217;t lived up to expectations, someone on the inside has leaked &#8220;the real story.&#8221; You can easily find similar posts by former employees of SOE, Sigil, Cryptic, Origin, and many other dev houses. And of course the fans and watchers of the industry pounce upon these posts and eagerly debate their merits, often with a hearty dose of &#8220;I told you so.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thing is, while there&#8217;s a certain amount of irresistible <em>schadenfreude</em> to be gleaned from these tales, one must keep in mind that they&#8217;re often written from a finite perspective. The average employee at a game development house is usually no more privy to the reasons behind the high-level decisions being made than employees in any other industry. There is no shortage of rumors and speculation&#8211;some more rooted in facts than others&#8211;but often enough bits of truth make their way into the mix to seem plausible and even likely.</p>
<p>Assuming that EA Louse believes everything he wrote to be the truth (which is a mighty big assumption to make, but let&#8217;s do so for the sake of argument), that does not mean that everything he wrote is <em>factual</em>. Another person on the same team may agree with some points and disagree with others; that doesn&#8217;t mean this person would be a lair, it just means that their experience and knowledge led them to a different perspective on what the truth is.</p>
<p>Again, I write this post neither to agree nor disagree with EA Louse&#8217;s post. Rather, I write to point out that everyone who posts on the Internet&#8211;me, you, EA Louse, <a title="A rebuttal from Kratos himself" href="http://criminalcrackdown.blogspot.com/2010/10/my-response-to-ea-louse.html" target="_blank">David Jaffe</a>, Perez Hilton, and any other goofball with a blog&#8211;does so from a certain perspective and with some kind of motivation or agenda. We mustn&#8217;t take for granted that truth is an absolute, even if it fills us with delight to believe so (there&#8217;s that old <em>schadenfreude</em> thing again). This is why honest post mortems are so difficult to come by; many of those involved are busy either covering their asses or looking to blame others for mistakes they themselves could have helped to avoid had they put the same degree of passion into fixing problems that they did complaining about them.</p>
<p>No doubt many other perspectives will be forthcoming in the days ahead (some have already been expressed in the copious comments section of the EA Louse blog), but no matter what is said, the objective facts of the situation will probably never be known to the public. Nor should they; even in our gossip-drenched culture, I hope we can collectively realize that it isn&#8217;t our right to know the details of what goes on behind a company&#8217;s closed doors any more than we&#8217;re entitled to know what Brad and Angelina ate for breakfast this morning. The Internet has done funny things to our perspective, to be sure.</p>
<p>That said&#8230; yeah, I got a kick out of reading it, too. I&#8217;m only human, after all.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have not given up on blogging, despite all appearances to the contrary. It&#8217;s just that, well, I&#8217;ve been busy.</p>
<p>Lots of great stuff going on at work. As you may have heard, we announced our <a title="There shall be a... oh, you know" href="http://reckoningthegame.com/" target="_blank">first product</a> and have been talking about it at various shows. I know many of you are anxious for more news on the MMO, but our promotional efforts are focused on the RPG right now. All good things to those who wait.</p>
<p>If it counts for anything, I have started (or thought about starting) several articles over the past few months, but never finished writing them for one reason or another. So for your own amusement, please pretend that you read timely, thought-provoking, and highly entertaining posts on the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are used video game sales a blight upon the industry?</li>
<li>The subscription MMO isn&#8217;t going anywhere</li>
<li>&#8220;Truth, Lies, and Frogloks: A Cautionary Tale&#8221;</li>
<li>Please buy me an iPad</li>
</ul>
<p>That last one isn&#8217;t really an article; I&#8217;d just love for someone to buy me an iPad.</p>
<p>But honestly, you should really be grateful that you&#8217;re getting a break from my ramblings. You&#8217;ll probably be sick of me again soon enough.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I&#8217;ll be <a title="Damn, I am sexy" href="https://www.cmpevents.com/GDAU10/a.asp?option=G&amp;V=3&amp;id=610243" target="_blank">on a panel at GDC Online</a> next month talking about transmedia stories. Looking forward to it!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m sure by now you&#8217;ve heard about Blizzard&#8217;s RealID system, and have seen <a title="Lum provides all the links you need" href="http://brokentoys.org/2010/07/07/realid-scare-mongering-from-a-lot-of-people-with-funny-names/" target="_blank">many of the opinions against the upcoming change</a> to WoW&#8217;s forums.</p>
<p>I think the move is lousy too, for most of the same reasons others have stated. I think ultimately the change is dangerous, both to the customers and to the health of the community. And I say this as someone whose &#8220;real ID&#8221; has been a matter of public record for a number of years now.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s another aspect to this I&#8217;d like to talk about which I haven&#8217;t seen discussed so far.</p>
<p>My instinct is that this change will peel away yet another layer of the magic of MMOs: that of being able to pretend you&#8217;re someone else. Sure, anonymity can empower jerks to act like even bigger jerks, but the illusion of the avatar also does great things. It allows disabled gamers to ignore their physical limitations; it allows the meek to act with confidence; it allows the person with an average job and an average life to become a legend.</p>
<p>The danger of connecting MMOs too closely with real life is that it takes away the game&#8217;s function as a vehicle of escape, perhaps even limiting the potential of the game to inspire the imagination. That&#8217;s a heavy price to pay for cutting down on forum spam.</p>
<p>Of course the message boards are technically separate from the game itself, but they represent a big part of the MMO experience for a sizable number of players. That connection is being impacted by the RealID change, which means yet another aspect of the classic MMO experience is being lost&#8211;if you&#8217;re a WoW player, at least.</p>
<p>Now, let me pontificate to MMO developers for a minute.</p>
<p>From personal experience, I know that keeping a gaming forum as useful and troll-free as possible is a huge pain in the ass. Guess what? It&#8217;s also the price you pay for coming to the dance. I don&#8217;t care how big your community is or how many posts you have to moderate&#8211;hire the freaking staff to do the job right. I understand the motive of wanting to create a cleaner environment for your posters, but don&#8217;t take the positive experience away from the good folks in the name of shutting up the asshats.</p>
<p>There is a certain charm in the forum hero known only by a clever handle. The MMOs of tomorrow need to hold onto all the charm they can, not let it slip away&#8211;regardless of the motive.</p>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">
<div dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">My instinct is that it will  peel away yet another layer of the magic of MMOs&#8211;that of being able to  pretend you&#8217;re someone else. Sure, anonymity can empower jerks to act  like even bigger jerks, but the existence of the avatar also does great  things. It allows disabled gamers to ignore their physical limitations;  it allows the meek to act with confidence; it allows the person with an  average job and an average life to become a legend.</span></div>

		<description><![CDATA[What does the original Clash of the Titans have to do with classic MMOs? Find out in this compelling post.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent the entire weekend angry that the new <em>Clash of the Titans</em> was so horrible. This was one of the seminal films of my youth, a tale that had nurtured my love for heroic fantasy, and it was utterly ruined by an almost unwatchable farce of a remake.</p>
<p>Monday at work I must have vented my frustration a half-dozen times. At one point, I even proclaimed that I would have been happy if only the film makers had reshot the original script and added updated special effects.</p>
<p>After fuming for a while, I realized I hadn&#8217;t seen the original film in many years. So over lunch I fired up Netflix and bounded over to my instant queue, where I had the old <em>Clash of the Titans</em> waiting for me.</p>
<p>By the time I was 30 minutes in, I realized how utterly wrong I had been. If the original script were shot today, moviegoers would laugh themselves out of the theater. It was bad. Really bad.</p>
<p>So why did I have such fond memories of this film from when I was a kid? While I&#8217;d like to think my tastes in film are more discerning now than when I was a boy, it couldn&#8217;t just be the ignorance of youth. Because despite the movie&#8217;s terrible dialogue and overwrought acting, I had one thing right: the movie told a really good story.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;d done was internalize the myth. I&#8217;d taken what was great and resonant about the story and hung onto it, discarding all the nonsense that sticks out like a sore thumb when watching the film today.</p>
<p>We do the same thing with so many aspects of life, including MMOs. Many of us look back on our days in Ultima Online, EverQuest, Asheron&#8217;s Call, and other early online games through the haze of selective memory. We internalize the myths that matter: the long camps that netted a coveted item, the fight to survive a Mistmoore train, your raid wiping and recovering in the wee hours of the morning. These tales are as vivid and vital today as they were when first experienced, and serve as the foundation for countless reminiscences with old friends.</p>
<p>But when I go back to EverQuest to check out the latest expansion or run through a familiar area, the game is virtually unplayable to me. The interface feels archaic, a huge impediment that actually gets in the way of my fun. Yet despite many evolutions over the years, it&#8217;s largely the exact same interface I spent countless hours interacting with.</p>
<p>Interfaces aren&#8217;t memorable. Dialogue and quests fade away.  The myths we internalize are rooted in the heroics of social interaction and the drama of emotional investment. If you can make a game&#8211;or movie, or book, or comic&#8211;with an experience that genuinely moves the audience, you can make something memorable. Because by doing so, you will have touched he myths that lie at the heart of all of us.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, March 23, I&#8217;ll be speaking at the <a title="i r a brainiac" href="http://conferences.computer.org/vr/2010/" target="_blank">IEEE Virtual Reality 2010 Conference</a>, taking place in nearby Waltham, MA. The panel is titled &#8220;<a title="so outclassed" href="http://conferences.computer.org/vr/2010/program/panels.html#des" target="_blank">Design for Experience?!</a>&#8221; and if you look at the list of speakers, I am clearly the dumbest guy in the room. I can only assume they had some quota of locals that needed to be filled.</p>
<p>My contribution has the uncharacteristically academic title &#8220;Memorable Experiences in Virtual Worlds.&#8221; Don&#8217;t worry&#8211;I&#8217;m not going all Raphtastic on ya. I&#8217;m building upon the basic premise of my talk with Owlchick last year at GDC Austin, where we asserted that the player&#8217;s stories are more compelling than those made by game designers.</p>
<p>Why does this fit a virtual reality conference? The panel is all about designing user experiences, and I submit that currently the most accessible form of virtual reality is found in massively multiplayer online games. Now I just have to convince the audience of that fact.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The hot industry trend is evangelizing social games. Many took up this habit fairly recently, playing catch-up at shows like DICE last week. The Kosters of the world have been atop their social soapboxes for years.</p>
<p>The aspect I find interesting is that a number of, shall we say, <em>developers of a certain age</em> (such as Richard Garriott) are moving from big-budget studios to the social realm.</p>
<p>In addition to smelling all the dollars in the water, I posit that there is another element at work here. The relative simplicity of web and mobile development is reminiscent in many ways of the first big era of console and home computer games. A few guys in a room can build a game from start to finish and make ridiculous money doing so. Old guys like Lord British find themselves back in their comfort zone.</p>
<p>You tend to see these folks in blogs and interviews touting statistics and trends which support their theories, which is only natural; developers tend to write and give presentations that promote their world view. This is why you have to study developer blogs with a watchful eye, because you should assume they will frame facts in a way that supports their assertions.</p>
<p>For example, I tend to write about big-budget MMOs because that&#8217;s the kind of game I enjoy working on and playing. I certainly enjoy playing Peggle, but I don&#8217;t see myself ever taking a job to design such a game. I&#8217;d probably end up making a version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_%28video_game%29">Breakout</a> where each brick spits out a quest when you hit it and you use your paddle to catch falling pieces of epic loot. In other words, I&#8217;d sink my career.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t begrudge anyone making or playing social games, though; it&#8217;s not my cup of tea, but I see no need to get snotty about it. I think social gaming is performing a valuable service to the industry by pressing a virtual reset button. While big-budget games and giant publishers continue to drive hardware evolution, ubiquitous platforms like Facebook and the iPhone will once again allow lean-and-mean development that proves you don&#8217;t need top-end graphics to make a fun game.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the more developers that jump on this trend, the more garbage consumers will be served. And, inevitably, social game development will balloon out of control and become just as muddy and expensive as the current generation of console games.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s okay&#8211;a new industry reset button will come along soon enough. Game design is, ultimately, about pattern recognition.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Pro-found" href="http://www.mmorpg.com/showFeature.cfm/feature/3982/Scott-Jennings-Legendary-Failures-of-Legend-Part-Two.html" target="_blank">Truer words have never been spoken</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to go out on a limb here, and assert that setting a realistic scope is one of the most difficult challenges an MMO producer will face.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Lum understates his point. He shouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Scope is a balancing act. When making an MMO that seeks to evolve the genre in some way (assuming you want to do that, of course), you need to figure out how much of the New &amp; Sexy you really need. But more than that, you need to question your assumptions about The Must Haves to be sure you&#8217;re not wasting time building expensive features just because that silly Warcraft game added them four years in.</p>
<p>How do you do this? You have to be brutally honest with yourself about the core vision of your game. This core vision is not a 10,000 page document&#8211;I&#8217;ve seen much-vaunted 10,000 page design documents, and they&#8217;re utter jokes. You need a list of four or five bullet points that describe the foundation of what your game is, and you use those four or five things as razors to evaluate every feature you consider putting into your game.</p>
<p>If a feature can&#8217;t stand up to your razors, you change it or cut it. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the feature in question is your greatest stroke of genius ever, or the most perfect example of design or art or code or music anyone has ever experienced. If it doesn&#8217;t advance the core vision of your game, it needs to change or go away.</p>
<p>Check out the director&#8217;s commentary on deleted scenes of your favorite DVD and you&#8217;re likely to hear how a certain scene was the director&#8217;s absolute favorite thing he ever shot, but ultimately he realized that it worked against the film and had to go. It&#8217;s painful to murder your darlings, but discipline is necessary in any art form.</p>
<p>Scott is right about something else, too: Nobody is ever going to give a developer an award for thoughtful scoping. But if you have the force of will to trim your game down to the purest core of what it can be, and you have the resources to polish that core so that it is excellent and fun, you will succeed and become very rich in the process.</p>
