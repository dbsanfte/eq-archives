<html><head><title>My One Good Ball</title></head><body><h1>My One Good Ball</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2003-07-16</p>With the arrival of Planes of Power, melee classes came upon a new type of weapon. Scattered about the elemental planes are some cute little trinkets that all share a rather unique characteristic: they proc short-lived pets in the shape of your class' epic. The paladin weapon looks really cool and drops in Fire, the shadowknight version drops in Water, the beastlord weapon is also in Fire, and warrior, ranger, and rogue ones drop in places I neither know nor care about. The monk version drops in Earth, which is really all that's important to me.<p>The weapons drop from minor named spawns that are rare and sometimes triggered. Rare spawns are a staple of the EQ universe, but the pet weapons are uber-rare drops from these named. I mean, I've helped paladins and SKs camp their silly swords a ton of times, and after an awful lot of named kills, we always end up with the booby prize instead. I didn't even try for the monk pet weapon, both because its <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=22877">stats</a> are fairly weak and due to the fact that getting people to camp the area it drops is a hassle. So I figured I could live without it, no big deal.<p>Well, wouldn't you just know that the sucker happened to drop on one of our guild raids, and sure enough there was little actual demand for the thing other than for the novelty value, so yours truly ended up with it. And yes, I knew going in what it looked like when equipped, but I just had to see how it could possibly be true.<p>See, paladins get a kick-ass looking weapon. The beastlord one is kinda cool. I presume that pretty much all the other melee pet weapons are at least decent looking if not spectacular.<p>Me, I get a volleyball. Hey, don't take my word for it. Check out these sexy pics:<p><TABLE><TR><TD><A HREF="http://www.linkdead.com/images/moorball1.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/images/moorball1s.jpg" BORDER=0></a></td><TD><A HREF="http://www.linkdead.com/images/moorball2.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/images/moorball2s.jpg" BORDER=0></a></td><TD><A HREF="http://www.linkdead.com/images/moorball3.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/images/moorball3s.jpg" BORDER=0></a></td></tr></table><p>Now, to be absolutely correct, my weapon (known officially as Earthen Fist) is more of a tetherball than a volleyball. It floats above and in front of the hand in which it's equipped, moving in an arcing motion along with it. It's as if there's an invisible chain attaching it to my wrist, which is why you see it hovering around me in the pictures above.<p>Now admittedly, this is kind of a fun toy. My guildmates get a kick out of it on raids. And I think it's cool to see messages like this:<p><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/images/mpetkill.jpg" BORDER=0><p>But then, it nearly breaks my heart to see messages like this:<p><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/images/mpetdies.jpg" BORDER=0><p>If that doesn't prove Blazzax is overpowered, I frankly don't know what does!<p>So yeah, my new pet weapon is nifty. The pet even does a fair amount of damage (someone in my guild saw my precious get up to 30 DPS at one point, though I haven't confirmed it for myself because you apparently have to turn on others hits to see the damage your pet does and I think that's silly). Then what's the problem?<p><H2>Um, hello? It's a giant floating sphere!</h2><p>How exactly does a monk weapon come out looking like an oversized cue ball? Considering there are seemingly 1,842 monk weapons that look like some variation of a glowing fist, how does this one in particular take on the appearance of a volleyball? Fix it, please, so I can stop listening to guildmates telling me it's my serve and asking what the score is.<p>Now, let's look at the particulars of this weapon. Its ratio is 17/20 with 100HP. Those are exactly the same pertinent stats as the <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=26809">ulak</a> dropped by that the pansy known as the Creator in Ssra Temple. And it's <I>worse</i> than the <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=27315">17/19 weapon</a> that drops off the Cursed in the same zone. That's one whole expansion (plus an extension) ago, and you don't need a jillion flags to get either weapon. Yet Earthen fist has the same or worse ratio and it's an ultra-rare drop from a minor named? Give me a break.<p>Even <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=26739">Battle Fists</a>, which drop from one of those wussy Zek boys in Tactics, are 18/20, and getting into that zone nowadays requires a single flag. Battle Fists are farmable by non-uber guilds quite easily, and while the proc sucks, at least the ratio is nice.<p>So again, why would a weapon that drops once in a blue moon in the freaking Plane of Earth have a worse ratio than the weapons above? And why does it have only 100 hitpoints?<p>Melee weapon itemization in PoP is lacking--monk weapons most of all (hey, this is a self-serving editorial, remember). While my Earthen Fist shouldn't be equal to stuff dropped by elemental gods or the named in Plane of Time, it should be clearly better than old Luclin weapons and easy-to-obtain PoP junk. Risk versus reward, and all that.<p>But hey, this isn't just about me. Feel free to improve the warrior and rogue pet weapons, too. But sorry, the hybrids will get no love from me today due to the 9,437 weapon choices that each of those classes have.<p>Most of all, please fix my floating white ball. Please. If I get called Gabrielle Reece one more time, you'll really see some screaming.
