   <font class="ArticleText"><BIG>Casters Get the Spotlight</BIG><p>Absor's discussion of pet issues <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000590.html">continues</a> with a clarification about pets and mezzed critters:<p><B>With the new changes, pets will not attack a mezzed NPC, no matter how much you beg, plead or cajole. You'll have to break the mez by some other means first.</B><p>But news that affects all types of casters has begun to flood in. A new batch of <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4322">focus effects</a> has shown up on Test server, geared towards all caster classes and all levels of the game. Unlike previous focus items, which were mostly summoned by mages, these &quot;new&quot; focus items are not new at all. That is, focus effects have been added to many older items in game. As Rich Waters <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4324">told</a> Casters Realm:<p><B>This patch has a large selection of focus effects added to existing items. This is the first round of non-summoned focus items, and the goal is to get a decent amount of them into the hands of players without creating a bottleneck camp for new items. This round of focus items includes over 150 items with focus effects being added retroactively, and should provide a good foundation for moving forward with new focus items in the future. <p>Additional focus effects and items will be added in the next round, specifically to higher end content as we create more specialized effects to use on these items.</B><p>The folks over at Graffe's Wizard board have a partial <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=17056.topic">list</a> of the old loot that has been upgraded on <a href="http://pub21.ezboard.com/feqtestregistryfrm14.showMessage?topicID=547.topic">Test server</a>:<p><B>Sarnak Arcane Fetish - Improved Healing II<br>Batskull Earring - Reagent Conservation I<br>Polished Bone Bracelet - Affliction Efficiency I<br>Bracelet of Woven Grass - Spell Haste I<br>Golden Efreeti Boots - Enchancement Haste II<br>Damask Robe - Extended Enhancement I<br>Green Silken Drape - Affliction Haste II<br>Moonstone Ring - Extended Range II<br>Runed Mithril Bracers - Reagent Conservation III<br>Azure Sleeves - Improved Damage I<br>Ring of Goblin Lords - Affliction Haste I<br>Turtle Shell Helm - Improved Healing I<br>Chipped Bone Bracelet - Affliction Efficiency II<br>Savant's Cap - Reagent Conservation II<br>Cougar Claw Earring - Extended Range III<br>Platinum armband - Mana Preservation I<br>Impskin gloves - Affliction Effectiancey I<br>Book of Obulus - Summon Haste I<br>Black Alloy Medallion - Mana Preservation II <br>Chrysoberyl Talisman - Affliction Haste II<br>Polished Bone Hoop - Mana Preservation I</B><p>At first glance, many casters will groan at the notion of carrying around bags full of old gear just to use when casting a certain spell. Level limits have been placed on item effects, however, that should largely prevent this from happening. Level one focus effects will only work on spells up to Level 20, level two focus effects will only work on spells up to Level 44, and level three focus effects will work on all spells up to Level 60.<p>So all these changes mean that casters are getting balanced... right? I'm not so sure.<p><BIG>Sounds Like a Nice Place for an Editorial</BIG><p>When you look back at melee balancing, you'll see it didn't quite work the same way. In that massive patch we had boosts to monks, rangers, paladins, shadowknights, and bards, while rogues and warriors were mostly left as is. That is, the &quot;balancing&quot; of melee classes consisted of changing the power of melee classes relative to one another. Along with that, some items were changed, too. For instance, monks suddenly had a lot of weapons with really insane ratios at their disposal, which again affected balance between the melee classes.<p>One of the issues that rose out of melee balancing was the increase in overall offensive power that resulted from the changes. Some mobs were altered to compensate for this, but the majority were left as is, thus effectively making them easier to kill.<p>When mage-summoned focus items were added a while back, it had the net effect of increasing caster power and effectiveness across the board. Few if any mobs were adjusted to compensate for this, and again, mobs were made easier to kill--by a considerable margin, in fact. The focus items were later nerfed to control their effectiveness with certain major spells (like complete heal), but in many ways the shark had already been jumped. Player power increased with no corresponding increase in mob power.<p>Now we are about to have focus items that affect every level of player--especially the lower-level ones with tomorrow's patch. Interestingly, when melee were balanced it was stated that the lower-level game was fine and didn't need much adjustment; it was the level 50+ game that saw the big changes. Apparently that's not the case with casters, however.<p>Before you start in with the &quot;stupid melee, you wouldn't understand&quot; comments (though I realize I'm probably too late), what I'm concerned with here is <I>game</I> balance, not class balance. While the level one focus effects seem relatively minor, they <I>are</I> going to have an impact on the low-end game. Granted, the low end of EQ has been mostly trivialized anyway, so level one focus effects will only add to that a bit. But what about the level two effects? Mid-level mobs will suddenly be dying a lot faster to casters who will be seeing their abilities increase rather significantly, while mid-level melees find themselves in the same boat they've been in for some time.<p>In other words, this feels like MUDflation again to me. Player power is increasing with no compensatory increase in mob power--unless tomorrow's patch includes some surprises that haven't been mentioned yet.<p>And we haven't even begun the <B>real</B> caster balancing act yet--balancing the classes in relation to each other. That feat is most certainly going to see some classes gain even more in spell effectiveness, which will only increase the power of players yet again.<p>Perhaps the only part of the game that might truly be balanced in terms of players vs. mobs will be Planes of Power when it arrives--and that's still four and a half months away. If caster balancing is really finished by then, will the entire existing content have been trivialized? Or will it be re-tuned in some way to prevent this?<p>Hey, don't get me wrong. I want every class to be happy, and I like to see casters getting a boost. I just don't want it to be at the expense of the game as a whole. Neither does Verant, of course, so let's hope they have an ace up their sleeve that's going to make me out to be a huge worry wart.<p>Hey, at least n00b casters will be as twinkable as melee now, right? Okay, let the flaming commence.<p><BIG>Support Times, They Are a'Changin'</BIG><p>Absor wanted folks to know about some <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000591.html">upcoming changes</a> to EQ's technical support service:<p><B>New Support Hours<br>Beginning on Monday, June 3rd, Customer Support Phone hours and Live Chat will be changing to better serve our customers.<p>Customer Service for Telephone Support will be open from 9:00am to 6:00pm Pacific Time (858) 537-0898 (Monday through Friday).<p><a href="http://www2.station.sony.com/en/instantchat.jsp">Customer Service for Live Chat</a> will be open from 9:00 am to 9:00pm Pacific Time (Monday through Friday).<p>In addition, solutions to most common issues can be found in our Station Knowledge Base and if you still can not find the answer to your question, please email us accounts@soe.sony.com.<p>Technical Help forum closing<p>In order to better serve the EverQuest community, the Technical Help forum is being closed and players with technical issues our encouraged to contact us through our new chat help. This feature is available from Monday through Friday between 9am and 9pm pacific. Many players have taken advantage of this new feature that enables them to get help from our technical support people without having to make a long distance call or wait for response to email inquiries. You can log on to the new chat through this link: <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/tech_support.jsp">http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/tech_support.jsp</a>.<p>We are able to reach more players much faster through chat and your technical issues will be handle more efficiently.</B><p>The chat system is kind of neat, though I haven't had to actually use it for anything just yet, so I can't comment on how effective it is. The Technical Support forum was of limited usefulness for official interaction, but it did help you figure out if the problem you were having was something just with your machine or if it was more widespread. In that regard, it will be a shame to see it go.<p><BIG>Euro Feedback Needed</BIG><p>Ubi Soft, the company that handles EQ in Europe, wants feedback from players across the pond. Check out this <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=44385">EQ Live page</a> for a link to the survey.<p>No witty comments here, sorry. Some news is too dry to make anything out of, even for my sick sense of humor.<p>What are you doing still reading this? Flame me, already. Jeesh!</font>
