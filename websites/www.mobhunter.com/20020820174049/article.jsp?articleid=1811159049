   <font class="ArticleText"><BIG>Just the Facts, Ma'am</BIG><p>Scott Hartsman sent us an e-mail of a <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=19251.topic&amp;start=37&amp;stop=37">post</a> he made on Graffe's Wizard board to help curb some of the misinformation that has shown up regarding things that were heard (or mis-heard) at FanFaire:<p><B>Evening/Morning/Something, folks. :)<p>Alan was kind enough to pull together a list of Fan Faire threads, and I wanted to clear up a few things that seem to be propagating as our answers that might be a little bit off.<p><I>- Someone asked about the status of caster balancing and the Dev team said they were pretty much done with that, though we might see a few tweaks.</I><p>This answer may have came from one of two places - Ryan's answer in the Developers/Producers panel was specifically addressing &quot;sweeping changes&quot; with respect to INT casters alone.<p>He ventured a guess that the largest of the changes may have already happened at this point, but he definitely didn't say that he was positive. <p>He also included that more tweaks would be coming over time, and that caster balance in general was far from over, and was more of an ongoing process.<p>My personal answer, from a few assorted conversations with people, was that when I get to play my wizard these days, I feel much more valuable and balanced than I ever have in the past, and that I wouldn't at all be disappointed if my class stayed the way it was for a while.<p>The official answer remains the same: Caster Balance is definitely not over. Not by a longshot.<p><I>- The stat cap on items will not be increased past 127. In other words, +125 items in Vex Thal and PoP are as high as we're going to see.</I><p>Not sure how this answer got interpreted this way -- Might have been background noise in the room.<p>Pretty sure this was a question to me, and my answer was something to the effect of, &quot;There's no way that we're going to talk about system changes for PoP that we may or may not make.&quot;<p>...which leads rather conveniently into the next one...<p><I>- Not a word on PoP or EQ2 at all. No demos or anything, which surprised me. When asked, Gallenite said they were gonna build it first and THEN talk about it. Novel idea!<p>------------------------------------<p>- They also wont be showing any PoP stuff at GenCon either,</I><p>Again -- this one was also addressing a PoP game system question.  If it's not done, we're not talking about it. :)<p>That said, we did show and talk about some parts of PoP in May at E3, and will again do so this week in Milwaukee (where I'm actually typing this from a hotel room right now) at GenCon.<p>What we won't be addressing are game system or advancement specifics.  The team would unanimously like to have those solid before we get into any details on them.   <p>Avoiding foot-in-mouth syndrome is something we're really trying for.   When we have the ability, we'd rather underpromise and overdeliver from here on out.<p>That looks like most of it from this thread - Might add more answers as this post makes the rounds of the FF boards.<p>We can't thank you enough for helping to make this Fan Faire another amazing success.  It was easily the most fun since....well...the last one. ;)<p>Take care, <p>- Scott</B><p>It really wouldn't be a bad idea for Absor and company to do this after every FanFaire, as it really does help control the amount of hooey that leaks onto the Net. While posting transcripts from all the official Verant discussion panels is great, there is an awful lot of information that gets spread around behind the scenes. People get drunk at a party and overhear part of what a Verant staffer is saying and all of a sudden that becomes gospel. For instance, a rumor is going around that so-and-so said the level cap will be raised to 75 with Planes of Power. I'm pretty sure Gallenite would manaburn the entrails of any employee who blabbed anything like that, even if it was true.<p>Not talking about products until they are done is probably a good thing. It takes some pressure off the team and...<p>Hey, waitaminute--that's a lousy idea! What the hell are sites like Mobhunter supposed to report? Somebody at GenCon better peek at the PoP booth and sneak us some juicy rumors. If nothing else, you'll keep Absor busy compiling lists of outrageous claims to refute.<p><BIG>It's on Your Shoulders</BIG><p>Speaking of Alan, he <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=19251.topic&amp;start=44&amp;stop=44">posted</a> in the same thread Hartsman did, this time concerning the Coldain shawl quest. This popular line of quests recently had an 8th step added to it, and fans are clamoring for a 9th and 10th. Here's the scoop from Absor:<p><B>I'm glad you liked them.<p>But, well, after a god comes by and hands you the last item in your quest... there isn't too much further you should expect the quest to go.<p>Sorry folks. We're glad you liked the quests, but there aren't any plans to add to that series. It had a definite end, and we reached it.<p>We'll just have to make new cool stuff for you in PoP.</B><p>If you ask me, it's all the fault of those lazy Coldain. No wonder they're all so damned ugly.<p><BIG>Mana from Heaven</BIG><p>Over on the Fires of Heaven message board, an interesting <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2252&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=1">thread</a> has surfaced that seems to indicate a hard cap on how much mana a caster can have:<p><B>For a while now some friends of mine and I have theorized that there is a mana softcap - that is, a limit or &quot;cap&quot; on mana given from items. We all are pretty sure there is a cap of some sort. For a while now, Rombus has been saying it's around 5000, while others claim it's much lower. With the advent of percentages in the new UI, we're able to narrow down this cap a bit more. In fact this is really when it started bugging me, because while raid buffed it took me 13% mana to try to cast GSS (540 mana) with a manapool of 4520, it also took Sorceresa 13% to try and cast GSS as well with a mana pool of 4210. It seems to me that it should have shown a greater percentage to try and cast GSS for someone with a smaller mana pool. So I started to run some &quot;tests&quot;. The mana numbers used here are from Magelo. <p>Full mana, zero buffs, standing up I removed 300 mana worth of items, dropping me to 4220 or +1370 in items. I then put those items back on, and my mana bar stayed at 100%. My UI shows my mana bar percentage, so I can tell if it drops at all when +mana items are added. I removed 600 mana worth of items, dropping me to 3920, and my mana bar dropped to 92%. <p>Full mana, zero buffs, standing up Sorceresa removed 300 mana worth of items, dropping her to 3910. She then put those items back on, and her mana bar dropped to 92%. Even adding 5 mana she saw it drop from 100% to 99%. <p>Bottom line? There seems to be a cap on how much mana items can give you. Neuro tinkered with this a bit, and found it to be exactly +1400 or 4250 total mana. Is this accurate? If not, what are we seeing there? And of what significance is this?</B><p>The thread includes lots of complaining and name calling, but also some pretty solid number crunching. After much testing and playing around with items, another poster came to the following conclusion:<p><B>At lvl 60, +mana from items is most definately capped at approx 1390. My next goal will be to refine this further and see if I can get the exact amount settled, but for now, I'm guessing 1390. <p>This cap is not dependant on your current int. or any +mana buffs. It is seperate unto itself. <p>I did another test, and int change from 253 to 255 shows a mana increase, so int is most definately adding mana all the way to 255, just in case people thought it cut off at 250 or 252. <p>I'm not sure how the 1390 figure is generated. It doesn't divide into 60 well, but 1390 - 10 does. I will soon be testing +mana at various levels, to see if I can find a pattern.</B><p>People have known about soft caps on stats like resists and AC for a while now--meaning you can raise the numbers themselves, but you don't get any actual return by doing so. It has been long assumed that hitpoints and mana were exceptions, because they are such foundational parts of a character. And hitpoints are clearly designed this way, because your HP total keeps going up the more +HP gear you add.<p>The apparent fact that mana doesn't work the same way is quite a blow to casters, and in fact renders some gear useless at the high end of the game. If a caster is at his mana cap anyway, adding another +mana item is useless. Better for them to get a +HP item instead. But guess what--that means casters will be wanting some of those precious all/all items that melee drool over.<p>True, this isn't the end of the world for casters. The vast majority of the EQ population will never reach the cap anyway, though this does not negate the arguments that posters in the FoH thread have. But it is also a fact that, for all intents and purposes, hitpoints = mana thanks to things like mod rods and certain class-specific spells. While the base mana pool might not be able to increase, the overall availability of mana still goes up as long as HP can increase.<p>Will this &quot;design limitation&quot; be addressed in other forms in the Planes of Power? Seems that Verant is unlikely to answer that, both because they don't want to talk about the specifics of PoP and because they've always shied away from discussing the details of numbers and formulae. In other words, it's probably going to be a case of wait and see.<p>In the meantime, looks like I'll be arm wrestling casters for my precious melee drops. You wimps had better start bulking up.</font>
