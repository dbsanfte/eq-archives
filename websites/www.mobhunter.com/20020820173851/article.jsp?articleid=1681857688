   <font class="ArticleText"><BIG>It's a Roleplaying Thing</BIG><p>This weekend was GenCon, the huge roleplaying festival that takes place annually in Wisconsin (a state which I am not from). Verant was in attendance, and GameSpot <a href="http://gamespot.com/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,6023274,00.html">filed a report</a> on some interesting Planes of Power info:<p><B>Characters will face a linear adventure by going from plane to plane solving each major quest, though to prevent overcrowding, several of the major quests will consist of multiple parts that can be completed in any order so that players won't all bottleneck at a single quest. In addition, some of the expansion's quests will feature &quot;virtual areas,&quot; which will essentially be duplicate versions of the areas you will need to explore and conquer to complete your quests.<p>Though we had seen several of the game's zones previously at E3 2002, we were able to see the newly implemented Plane of Innovation at Gen Con. Innovation will be a plane of tinkerers--in fact, player characters that have studied the tinkering trade skill should be able to find a few extra quests to perform. The plane itself will be characterized by animated fixtures in the backgrounds--mechanical arms and pistons constantly in motion on bookshelves and walls and ceilings. The plane will be divided into two areas: the factory, at which all new technology is developed, and the junkyard, where obsolete technology is dumped. Unfortunately for players, much of the plane's obsolete technology is in the form of huge, mechanized monsters, like the junkbeast, a grotesque metallic creature made entirely from simple parts, like cogs and wheels, with a rusty, bloodstained bear trap for a head. <p>We also got a look at the Plane of Justice, an interstellar prison for some of the universe's worst criminals, held prisoner by the divine Tribunal (a trio of three gods of justice and a selectable religion choice for player characters). The Tribunal consists of three gigantic black-robed figures that preside over the prison, and depending on your character's alignment, you may actually find yourself at odds with the deities, since some of the plane's criminals may charge your characters with helping them escape as part of a quest. To move on from the Plane of Justice, you will have to duel and defeat the Seventh Hammer, a giant robed figure not unlike the Tribunal, who wields a huge ivory mallet inscribed with the sign of the Tribunal--a set of scales--on the head.</B><p>Hopefully the anti-bottleneck plans work out, though that will be a tough sell to jaded players who are choking on some of the Luclin key quests. The linear progression ideas sound cool, and the details on the planes are neat. Ultimately PoP will be judged on the accessibility and completeness of its content, and since it's aimed at high-level folks, the critics will be out in force. I have a feeling Verant knows this, but it's worth mentioning anyway.<p>Get this one right, fellas!<p><BIG>Not Your Punching Bag Anymore</BIG><p>For nearly as long as EverQuest has been around, people have used their logs to parse damage output. Whether it was to see which weapon combo worked best or to judge the effectiveness of a particular skill, attacking an NPC for a finite amount of time and analyzing the results has long been a staple of gauging melee effectiveness.<p>A favorite target of parsers lately has been the soulbinders--low-level NPCs with a ton of hitpoints that let you beat on them for long periods of time without risking death. In fact, mages used them to prove there is a haste cap on their pets, the existence of which means that some of their high-level pet buffs are rendered largely ineffective.<p>However, a change just got made to soulbinders that has <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=6079.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=25">upset the mages</a>, as soulbinders will no longer be usable as a parsing tool. Rich Waters stopped by the mage board and responded with an explanation:<p><B>There are a couple of good reasons why we changed the Soul Binders to make them non-combatable NPCs. The first reason is that we put them in to help out people who were waiting unreasonable amounts of time to find someone to bind them. We didn't put them in for people to attack in the middle of towns as a testing dummy that didn't fight back or call for help.<p>The more important reason though is that it was causing a lot of inaccurate information to crop up from the parsing going on. Not that all parsing was inaccurate, but a significant amount of posts are drawing conclusions that don't match other people's parses, and don't match what's really happening in game. I think that the dev team has made a lot of improvements with giving accurate information and feedback to the player base, and acknowledging problems as they come up. We're not trying to keep people from parsing or logging at all - if we didn't want you to be able to parse damage effectively, we'd just stop logging damage in your log files instead of removing the ability to fight defenseless soul binders. <p>Here's the problem - soul binders are low-level NPCs with non-standard stats including their hit points, defensive skills, and armor class. Because of the large level and skill difference between the soul binders and the people who are parsing against them, the conclusions of the parsings are very skewed. There are a very large amount of variables that go into resolving combat in EverQuest, and they don't all scale evenly. The relative damage difference between a ranger and a paladin is different when fighting a soul binder instead of fighting a blue experience giving monster, or a boss monster on a raid. The relative performance of pets varies just as much.<p>In addition to the problem listed above, there's another problem - there's a lot of difference in the stats, gear, and buffs of the players parsing against soul binders. I follow the posts about the combat system on various boards quite carefully, and often repeat the same situations that people post their results from. I get letters each day from many people with all sorts of contradictory conclusions - rogues writing in to say they parsed on a soul binder and shadow knights outdamaged them, shadow knights writing in to say that their parses show they do half the damage of paladins when fighting a soul binder. Even little things like parsing for different lengths of time will skew the results in favor of someone. People parse themselves versus a soul binder, and then compare their damage output with someone else who parsed a totally different way against a soul binder, and then get upset that the conclusions are wacky.<p>Certainly there are many people who make the effort to test in a controlled environment, and do get more valid results out of parsings. It remains true in that case though, that people are only establishing the relative power of high-level characters fighting a weird level one monster. That doesn't translate accurately into those same characters performance in an experience group.<p>There is still a tremendous amount of knowledge to be gained by parsing, and removing the ability to do so against soul binders won't hurt it at all. Parse your logs from fighting monsters you'd normally fight in an experience group, that's a lot more meaningful value to be analyzing. Important findings such as the pet delay bug that Cyricus turned up could have been found just as easily by parsing in an experience group - many of the excellent parsing programs available now include an analysis of apparent delay of the combatants, and a few fights with and without pet haste buffs would have illustrated the problem just as well. Contrary to popular belief, we appreciate it when players bring flaws in the system to our attention. I'm glad that the pet haste bug was discovered, and glad of the opportunity to fix it. There's no value in trying to hide problems when we could be fixing them instead.<p>We don't want to limit your ability to learn about the game through observing it, soul binders just weren't giving an accurate portrayal for many people. When things get fixed, such as the pet haste bug, we'll include it in the patch message, and you'll clearly be able to observe it in any normal fights you do. We're not out to get you and make you mad. We're as interested as any of our players in maintaining and improving the health of EverQuest so that people can enjoy playing it for a long time to come.</B><p>Experienced parsers know very well that which NPC you test on has a huge impact on the results you get. Still, there's no denying that parsing is much easier on a stationary target that doesn't hit back versus doing it on a level 65 boss mob that will waste you in no time if it decides that you've earned its attention.<p>Evil Verant conspiracy or honest attempt to remedy skewed testing results? You'll draw your own conclusions regardless of what I say. There are still plenty of valid targets to parse with almost as easily as the soulbinders, so the game hasn't been ruined for those who love parsing.<p>Another day, another something to complain about, I guess.<p><BIG>It's a Small Moon After All</BIG><p>Busy-boy Rich also stopped over at the druid board to <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=28124.topic">let them know</a> that new port spells will be added to make travel around Luclin easier:<p><B>Thought you'd be interested to know that we're adding in Luclin ports and putting them on Test server this weekend. These spells will be available to both druids and wizards as convenient vendor sold scrolls. <p>We've added a Nexus port for druids, and ports to Dawnshroud, Twilight Sea, and Grimling Forest for wizards and druids. This should help cut the travel time to the remote areas of Luclin, and it's something that a lot of players have been asking for.</B><p>This resulted in many hugs and marriage proposals for Rich, which leads me to believe that this change was made solely to increase the amount of wood elf cyber he gets.<p>Despite questionable roleplay reasons for making this change, you'll be hard pressed to find anyone who won't be grateful for it. Druids clearly benefit, but also raid setup times on Luclin will be much, much shorter. And I guess wizards will be happy because they won't have to cast quite so many translocate spells on poor helpless melee types.<p>This is all another part of Verant's ongoing efforts to shrink the world. Remember when Brad McQuaid used to say things like how Permafrost was hard to get to for a reason? The thinking has clearly changed since those days. Planes of Power is being designed with easier raid setups in mind, with graveyards for your corpse and safe rooms for buffing and preparation. The city-to-city teleport system in the Plane of Knowledge should really make travel to just about anywhere fast and easy.<p>I still remember when running from Freeport to Qeynos was a death-defying, all-day affair. Oh, how times have changed.<p><BIG>Phat Lewtz R Us</BIG><p>So you want that cloak of flames or key to Sleeper's Tomb but you don't have the means to get one yourself? No problem--if you're on the Rathe server, anyway.<p>Thanks to the wonders of manaburn, you too can obtain these high-level items for just a few mere platinum pieces. The <a href="http://www.geocities.com/mana_burner/">Manaburn Sindicate</a> [sic] makes all this possible!<p>As long as you have 80K for that CoF or 50K for your epic piece, you can hire a gang of wizards to come wipe out certain former ubermobs and collect your loot.<p>Whether this list is real or if the misspelling of &quot;syndicate&quot; is an intentional pun, I cannot say. Maybe it's all just an attempt to get manaburn nerfed. If real, it joins ebay auctions and Uber U in the ranks of tasteless player schemes.<p>Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go PL my wizard alt. There's money to be made!!!</font>
