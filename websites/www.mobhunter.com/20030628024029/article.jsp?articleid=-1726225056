   <font class="ArticleText"><I>Editor's Note: It should be made clear that Scott Hartsman is a technical guy, not a content guy. As such, it wouldn't do us any good to ask him what kind of mobs we'll see in Planes of Power or whether we'll find Lower Guk in EQ2. Our questions, therefore, mostly deal with game mechanics and code.</I><p>Mobhunter: First, let's get to know you a bit.<p><B>Hartsman: I'm originally from Milwaukee, where I spent most of my life, but was driven out of town by an angry mob after it was discovered that I don't drink beer. (Which was probably best for everyone involved -- While I do like going home to visit, the charm of having to be proficient in the use of shovels and ice scrapers was wearing thin.)  Predictably, I ended up in Southern California.</B><p>How long have you worked for Verant/SOE? Were you hired as Technical Director, or have you moved around within the company?<p><B>I've been here since October, 2001. I was originally hired to join the Sovereign team, but as Luclin's development was coming to a close, due to a fair bit of experience with EQ from the other side of the fence, I was asked to slide over and lend a hand. Like most things related to EQ, this course of events inevitably developed a life of its own, and turned into something a little bit...less temporary.</B><p>In a nutshell, what are your job responsibilities? <p><B>Hmmm. Truthfully, I'm not certain that they'd fit in a nutshell. Definitely not anything like a pistachio or a macadamia. A coconut, maybe. But then again, I've never been really clear on whether or not those are nuts in the traditional sense...<p>My responsibilities actually scatter themselves pretty thoroughly all over the place. The short version would be to say that I'm the one presently in charge of the codebase that is EverQuest. The longer version would be the one that talked about things like playing a part in reorganizing our development so we can have separate teams working on EverQuest: Live, EverQuest: The New Interface, EverQuest: The Planes of Power, and EverQuest: The Localized Versions (Starting with Korean), prioritizing and assigning out the changes to the EQ code, reviewing designs for new systems and changes to existing ones, and occasionally (albeit rarely) designing a new system or two myself. <p>Not to digress too far again, but the first time you see Fippy Darkpaw shout in a language you can't understand, it's just extremely cool in a very odd way...</B><p>What is the typical day (if there is such a thing) like for you?<p><B>That depends a lot. Are we talking about Patch Day? Let's assume not, 'cause those are anything but typical... I generally wander in sometime between 8 and 9, in dire need of coffee. The past few weeks have been full of Planes of Power updates, Live updates, and much coordination work in making sure that our Korean beta (hosted by NCSoft) goes as smoothly as we'd like.  With so much going on, the days go by extremely fast. Much Email is written, many conversations are had about how we can improve our systems, much debating is done about the order in which we want to get things implemented, and much prioritizing is done about the fixes that we'd all like to make sure get into the game.<p>The conversations vary wildly in any given day -- They could be anything from talking with designers about gameplay/balance/systems improvements, to a system to handle grammar rules in different languages, to entirely new gameplay systems, to how we could improve the tools to help the designers put content into the game easier... You name it.  Anything's fair game.<p>At some point in the day, depending on which day of the week it is, I'll end up either in a Coder meeting, CS Policy meeting, Operations meeting, a Status meeting, or potentially a meeting to determine whether or not we need to have a meeting. (But those have donuts, so it's all right.) ...and then before you know it, it's 9 or 10 at night, and it's time to sneak out early!<p>Occasionally, I do still get to write some code, like the system behind focus items, the recent pet changes (Rich gets all the credit on this one - I just did the code), or the de-hell-level-ification.  Most of the really cool things, though (like the EQ Channel Server) are done by the armada of amazingly dedicated coders that I have the privilege of working with. Some of them are behind the scenes optimizations, others are huge projects that we've kept close to our chest for the past months, some of which will be revealed soon enough... (Is that obscure enough?)</B><p>How many members are on the EQ Live Team? <p><B>There are 46, with two or three slots open on the <a href="http://www.soe.sony.com">SOE Employment page</a>. (Employment link at the bottom.)</B><p>How has this number changed, and how does it compare to the size of other teams (PoP, PS2, EQ2)? <p><B>When I originally arrived, I think it was about 10 smaller than it is now. As I understand it, EverQuest is the largest game product team in the company. I haven't personally walked around other departments doing headcounts, but I've seen our team picture next to others'. I'm pretty sure that we could take most of them in a fair fight.</B><p>How do you respond to claims that Verant is downsizing the Live Team in favor of developing only new products?<p><B>Considering that the team's size has grown about 20% in the last 7 months, my response would likely begin by politely asking the claimant to doublecheck their math. :)<p>(And I don't mean that we're all gaining weight, either. We don't all work out as much as we should, but really, there's no call for being mean. We have feelings too.)</B><p>Is the Luclin engine &quot;done&quot;? I'm not talking about the Bazaar or the new interface; I mean the underlying code. Is the current speed of the engine about the maximum that we're going to see?<p><B>Yes and no. This is an online game, which by definition is never &quot;done,&quot; as we all probably know already. That said, you never know when someone's going to stumble upon another thing that speeds up performance. Occasionally, one of the coders will find something, tweak it, and discover another half frame a second. We tend to not announce those, though.<br> <br>What you likely won't see is more large improvements, such as the ones made over the initial months after Luclin's release, where zoning time (for many people) went from 90 seconds to 20 or faster, and the maximum amount of memory used went down by a hundred or so megabytes.  The game is very playable for the vast majority of people, and we're definitely happy about that.</B><p>Shortly after launch, Verant announced a deal with Intel that was supposed to mean optimizations for the Pentium 4 chip in the Luclin code. Do these actually exist? What do these &quot;optimizations&quot; provide? Could you really notice a difference if you had comparable P4 and Athlon systems running the same video card side by side?<p><B>Oh, they absolutely do exist. The optimizations, which were done by some good folks at Intel, mostly focused on speeding up rendering of the environments, using some of the new instructions available in the P4. Our engine has always had separate code paths for different processors. Adding a new code path for the P4 wasn't particularly traumatic, and there's no penalty for not having one.<p>As for the Athlon comparison -- The optimizations weren't focused on making one chip perform better than another -- they were about making one chip perform better than it did a week earlier.</B><p>One long-standing complaint of EQ players is the pathing of the monsters. Can you explain how pathing works, and how it can go bad? Can we ever look forward to a redesign of pathing in EQ, or will we have to wait for future Verant products?<p><B>If I had to give a definitive answer, I'd have to say... &quot;It's magic!&quot; ..and then you'd probably look at me funny. I don't want to launch into a full-on explanation of how our pathing works, other than to say that pathing is an attribute of the zone, not the individual NPC. The thing that makes a mob path badly is that generally it has faulty information on the shortest distance between point A and point B.<p>A better system could make up for that sort of thing, and we'd love to make tweaks like that, but it's hard without breaking the whole thing in new and exciting ways. We definitely recognize it as an area that's ripe for improvement. I wouldn't rule it out as something we'd really like to look at.<p>The hard part is to make a better system that would take all of the existing pathing work into account. (It wouldn't do us much good to write a system that would cause every zone in the game to need to be repathed - That would be an even more immense undertaking.) I sincerely hope we have the time to improve this at some point.</B><p>Any updates on how the new interface is coming along? Can you tell us any more about what features it will have? Is there any updated ETA on the Bazaar interface?<p><B>The new interface impresses me more and more every passing day -- As do the people who've worked so incredibly hard on it. :)  We have five developers and two artists who, over the past months, have had the immense task of transforming EverQuest into something that most of us familiar with the game could have only imagined that we'd see, and harder yet, making it do so in multiple languages.<p>We're pretty much right on track from our last words on the subject -- It's already being used in internal testing, and is looking extremely good for a summer release.<p>The Pet Control window is looking good. The new buff icons are amazing. (Goodbye, 5 shields, 4 arms, 3 yellow moons, 2 blue diamonds, and a purple horseshoe.) Even something as simple as Character Select is a thing to behold.<p>The Bazaar will be released either with the new UI, or in the weeks thereafter, depending on when it clears testing. What we're aiming for is a release where people see this show up on test for the first time and think, &quot;Wow. This could go live today.&quot; If we've done that, then we've done our job.<p>To a lot of us, it's about restoring the faith. We know that the details matter, and we're trying to address as many of them as possible before anyone outside the company sees it.</B><p>Besides general bug fixing, does Verant have a long-term plan to build robustness into the zones? Is this something we'll be likely to see in Everquest, or will we have to look to future Verant games for crash-proof zones?<p><B>Actually, yes. We have a new system in place that gives our designers a new level of data-error detection. Ideally, we hope to have many of these issues covered long before they ever see a live server, from here on out. However, we're still not done making major structural changes. Unfortunately, many times when we make those, it takes 43 servers full of people to find them.<p>One of those changes being the new grouping logic that's on Test Server right now. The system should be mostly invisible to people - It works identical to the old one. However, once the kinks are ironed out of it, the group bugs of today should become a thing of the past, as people begin to notice their new ability to reassign group leadership, and having group leadership automatically transfer when the leader exits or goes Linkdead.</B><p>Will my EverQuest character ever cast a shadow or see himself in a mirror? Or will he have to wait for EQ2?<p><B>Some form of shadowing might be within the realm of possibility, but I don't know that I would count much on reflections - At least not unless we upped the minimum system requirement to something a lot heftier than it is today, which we're definitely not aiming to do at the moment.</B><p>Some people question whether you guys test changes well enough. Can you go over the testing procedures you use for changes to the game? Do you use any kind of automated regression testing?<p><B>Well, I don't want to overstep and get into our recently expanded testing department's methodologies, but I can tell you what development's part of it is. Our focus is making sure that testing has all of the information that they need. In a game with the size and complexity of EQ, it's impossible to know for certain what side effect any change may have. Changes are tested first by the developer, then the testing department, then the test server players. We catch the vast majority of bugs before they go live. (If you'd like to hear about a recent scare, ask a test server cleric how we accidentally made their heals Line-of-sight for half a day.)<p>Many of the problems that we see, though, don't show up until there is a load from a real server. That's one of the current hurdles -- Artificial load just isn't the same as real people. People are infinitely more ingenious.<p>There are definitely some standard regressions that occur, though. For example, due to the way Bards were implemented, pretty much any change to the stacking code, magic system, or spell filtering requires a full regression of every bardic ability. (Can they sing? Can they stop singing? Can they sing again? Can they twist? Can they proc? Can they click? Can they sing after they click? Can they click if they proc while they're singing if they've twisted since then?...and on and on.) <p>The problem is the sheer number of combinations of events that really can't be automated. When someone discovers a new combination, it's usually fairly obvious. (...by the fact that Absor's Email box fills up, and he comes looking for the nearest coder. Don't let that quiet, shy demeanor of his fool you, either. Mess with his bards, and he gets downright vicious.)</B><p>Patching EQ sometimes takes many hours. What's going on for all that time? Is there an initiative to shorten these times for EQ, or for future products?<p><B>Honestly, the majority of it involved propagating a world full of EverQuest data to 1,200 computers and the patchers.<p>There was, in fact, recently an initiative to do just that. The two most recent patches showed the results. In both patches, we refreshed every piece of data on every EQ server. That process used to take 12 hours, and it can now be done in four or less. While the first of the two patches was definitely somewhat traumatic, the second of the two went extremely well, and we only see it improving from here out.<p>I wouldn't want to speak for the other game teams in the company, other than to say: From the folks that I've spoken with about this, I'm certain they've aimed to make systems that will be more efficient from the get go.</B><br> <br>I know you guys are concerned about the integrity of the game client, but are we ever going to be allowed to play Everquest in a window or at least Alt-Tab out to the desktop? So many workarounds for this exist that it seems almost pointless to keep fighting it.<p><B>To me, at least, it's more than just integrity -- It's also about immersion.<p>I'm certain that I could be branded a technology heretic for saying this, but I personally have no desire to play any type of immersive game in a window. To me, that just feels wrong. Whether I'm playing EQ, Dungeon Siege, Baldur's Gate 2, CounterStrike, or pretty much anything other than Solitaire and Minesweeper, the last thing I want to see or hear is something other than the environment I'm playing in.<p>That said, there are definitely valid arguments on both sides for allowing the option, and I'm sure we both know them backward and forward already. Our biggest concern remains in that we have a huge game world, full of many intricate systems. Unlike some other online games, we've never had to have an universal rollback due to a malicious attack. We value the integrity of the game world above all else. Hypothetically speaking, one person could ruin the day for 430,000+ others. Anything that increases the potential for a universe-shattering event such as that is something that we have no choice but to take seriously.</B><p>If DirectX support becomes <a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/top_news_item.cfm?NewsID=4522">available for the Mac</a>, what are the chances that Verant would consider a Macintosh port of EverQuest?<p><B>We consider all kinds of things, all the time. :) Personally, I'd enjoy seeing EQ on everything from Mac, to Linux, to my cell phone, and perhaps even my gas grill. (It's got a little window in the front.)<p>Again, though, it's all a matter of how many developers can work with the same source code at a single time without slowing the others down. I'd rather get the backlog of items that people are expecting, done, before we talk about the potential for new, major technology pieces.</B><p>Can you give us any further scoop on Planes of Power or EQ2? Come on, you know you want to!<br> <br><B>Nothing other than that I'm really looking forward to getting the chance to play both of them. :)</B><p>I really didn't expect to get a response to that last one, but I had to try! Thanks to Scott Hartsman for (finally) answering our questions.</font>
