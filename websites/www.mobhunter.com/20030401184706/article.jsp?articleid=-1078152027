   <font class="ArticleText"><BIG>The Mark of Kane</big><p>The Kane Bayle server has been around for about a year now. Located in Amsterdam, it was one of the first non-US-based servers. While the pros and cons of localization are still debated, in most ways the technique seems to be working out.<p>But all is not rosy in the city of legal drugs and live sex shows. Zone crashes are preventing some players from enjoying game content. In the words of Greldon Silverhand, a player on Kane Bayle:<p><B>Vex Thal on Kane Bayle crashes constantly, making it impossible to raid there without GM help every crash. We've spent as a guild countless man hours to access that zone, and so far had to deal with 3 or 4 crashes at least every VT raid... Bastion of Thunder crashes, Vex Thal crashes, Plane of Fire crashes, Seru all crash several times a day. It's time to fix this problem...<p>We have not exploited the crashes to our advantage. We've cleared VT once per week, which is its natural repop timer. Given that the zone crashes several times a day, we could have farmed blob and diabos several times a day - and maybe that is what the management thinks - but it is not the case.</b><p>Anyone who has spent time in VT knows what a long, arduous process it is to clear this zone. Due to the way VT is set up, there is virtually no way a raid could survive the zone crashing and coming back up with all the mobs alive--a wipeout and reclearing is pretty much a guarantee. According to Greldon, the only intervention that GMs will do in such a situation is to provide rezes at the zone line. His guild has lost a lot of loot--and a ton of time--due to these crashes. And as you can see, multiple zones are affected.<p>The problem might be because zone sharing is set up differently on the Kane Bayle server compared to the American variety. As you probably know, an EverQuest server is actually a collection of machines, each of which runs a given number of zones. SOE attempts to balance the load on each machine by having low-population zones running along with high-usage ones. It might be that Kane Bayle wasn't configured properly, and so VT and the other zones listed above are sharing space with some high-traffic zone that causes machine instability.<p>Of course, there could be other issues that are causing the problem, but regardless of what is making it happen, the players on Kane Bayle deserve a fix. While it might just be the upper-tier guilds affected now, sooner or later the problem will impact more and more people. Hopefully help is on the way soon.<p><BIG>A Chant, a Rant, or a Sycophant?</big><p>What's the topic on evereyone's lips these days? Charm spells. On the one hand you have classes without the ability to charm complaining how overpowered the ability has become since Planes of Power. On the other hand you have charm classes screaming that a nerf at this point would ruin the game for them.<p>The Dev Team has been tinkering with rebalancing charms for a while now. Over on the enchanter boards, a <a href="http://forums.crgaming.com/eqbb/viewtopic.php?t=84588&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0">long, bloody thread</a> starts off with a look at the current state of charms on Test:<p><B>- The resist modifier of CoD [Command of Druzzil] is 0 now.<p>- The charmer will get 50% of the agro generated by the pet. It was first changed to 100% but that was determined to be too much.<p>- Charmed pets now take a percentage of the exp. It's apparently on a sliding scale, based on the total percentage of damage the pet does.</b><p>According to sources on Test server, the aggro change will not be going live, but the other two will. The significant impact of these (and potentially other) changes on the game might be the reason for the patch being delayed until after FanFaire is over. With such a high potential for post-patch problems, it makes sense to wait until the entire team is back... and sober.<p>What precipitated these changes? After all, charmed mobs have been a part of the game for a very long time now. Using charmed giants against the Avatar of War might have been the first time widespread attention was brought to the ability, making some question whether it was overpowered. But such situations were mostly handled on a case-by-case basis, and meanwhile the power of charm was increased through spells and AA abilities from expansion to expansion.<p>The current hubbub over charm spells really surfaced after PoP came out. Enchanters, druids, and necros were given powerful new charm abilities, which allowed them to control mobs that hit for 500 damage or more with each swing. Suddenly entire groups were being outdamaged by soloers with uber pets, and charm classes found that soloing involved little risk while providing massive amounts of experience. Though some adjustments have been made to the ability, by and large it has remained an extremely effective means of getting ungodly amounts of exp.<p>Players without the ability to charm mobs--especially melee types--are crying foul. While most classes have seen their ability to solo all but vanish after level 60, chanters, druids, and necros have seen their solo skills go through the roof. Enchanters have the greatest number of zones and mobs to choose from, druids can charm animals in quite a few places, and perhaps nobody in game churns out more damage than a necro in the back of Crypt of Decay. Non-charm classes who are utterly dependent upon a balanced group to obtain reasonable amounts of experience are balking at the rate soloers with a charmed pet can obtain it.<p>Charmers, however, claim that changes to the ability will take away any sense of fun they have. Enchanters don't want to be reduced to buff slaves, druids don't want to be limited to backup healing, and necros refuse to resume the role of mana battery. Take away charm and you take away the fun, they say. Besides, how is letting some folks solo ruining the game for other players? Can't people live and let live?<p>Granted, charm spells are a part of the game. It's built into the very fabric of the enchanter class, and has become increasingly important to druids and necros. The ability to charm should be preserved in the game--just not at the expense of balance and fairness.<p>Seriously, it seems almost beyond belief that anyone could look at the state of charm spells today and not see the system as horribly broken. Soloing is a valid style of play in EQ--in fact, it should be expanded so that every class can do it, at least a little bit. But anytime one class can solo and, by doing so, gain significantly more experience than an entire group can muster in the same time period, the game is out of balance. And it needs to be fixed.<p>Like it or not, EverQuest is a game built around grouping. While soloing should definitely be an option, grouping should always have bigger payoffs. (This is a good time to point out that the exp bonus for grouping should be raised significantly, by the way.)<p>So do the changes currently on Test provide the answer? Only after we see their impact on gameplay on the live servers will we really come close to an answer, but they do seem to be on the right track. Making charms easier to resist and more likely to break is an obvious means of balance, as it makes soloing less attractive due to increased risk. This would retain the charming of mobs in groups and on raids as a viable tool, since the caster has backup in case things go badly. Aggro changes are the stickiest part of the equation, which may be the reason this change is the least likely to go live. While a lot of mobs should probably be smart enough to figure out that it's better to kill the owner of the pet before the pet itself, for gameplay reasons the charmer needs a certain degree of safety.<p>The most logical change to charms is, it seems to me, the modification to experience gained. If a pet is significantly outdamaging players, the use of that pet should drastically affect the amount of exp to be gained. The trick, of course, is balancing it out so that the pet owner prefers grouping, and that the group will want to put forth its best effort rather than sitting back and letting a pet do all the work.<p>Complaints about these changes are <a href="http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=30777.topic">widespread</a>. A frequent comment we see when a long-standing ability is modified/fixed/changed is the old &quot;it's been this way so long, it's unfair to change it&quot; line. Monks said the same thing when their overpowered mitigation abilities were nerfed, and we're seeing it again here. You know, that reminds me of a story...<p>I worked in this office building that had one of those candy machines where you punch in the number of the thing you want, the spiral arm turns, and your selection falls to the slot below. One day we discovered that although the Baby Ruth slot was marked as 60 cents, you only had to put in 30 cents to get the candy bar. Naturally, most of us started buying Baby Ruth bars, taking advantage of the misprogrammed vending machine. After a few weeks the problem was eventually fixed, and candy in that slot ended up costing the correct amount.<p>Now, please tell me which argument would have convinced the vending machine owner to change the Baby Ruth slot back to 30 cents:<p>&quot;It doesn't matter if it was a mistake. You left the price that way for so long, it's unfair to change it now.&quot;<p>&quot;If you don't leave the price broken, I will quit buying candy from you at all.&quot;<p>&quot;Buying Baby Ruths for 30 cents was the only thing that made coming to work fun for me. You've spoiled that fun by upping the price, so I don't see why I should even come to work anymore.&quot;<p>&quot;I spent a whole month saving up a penny a day in the hopes that I could one day buy a Baby Ruth for 30 cents. Now, just when I finally have enough money to buy one, you nerf my ability to do so. That sucks!&quot;<p>&quot;How does the fact that I can get Baby Ruths for 30 cents hurt anybody else? If other people don't get them for 30 cents, that shouldn't affect my ability to do so.&quot;<p>It's just a hunch, but I don't really think the vending machine people would have bought into any of those reasons. Clearly the vending machine was broken, and they fixed it. My friends and I were happy that we got Baby Ruths for 30 cents for as long as we did, but there was no way we could realistically expect it to go on forever. Whether it took them two days, two weeks, or two years to do so, correcting the mistake was necessary for the health of the company.<p>The change to charm spells is the same way. Some people have used the imbalance to rack up an amazing amount of experience. Well, good for them. But that doesn't mean the game should remain so completely imbalanced. Problems have to be addressed, no matter how long they've existed in game.<p>Look, I don't want to ruin anyone's fun--and whether you believe it or not, neither does the Dev Team. But without balance and fairness, the game can't stay healthy. If a few classes are overpowered, it makes the game less fun for the other classes, and those people will want to quit. A relatively level playing field is absolutely essential for keeping EQ alive, and one of the greatest factors for determining how even the field is lies in how much experience different classes can accumulate in a given period of time.<p>However, I'm not absolving SOE of their culpability here. When designing mobs and spells in Planes of Power, they really should have anticipated the impact that charmed pets would have on the game. No team of designers can ever anticipate every play style an entire player population can come up with, but charm spells are such an integral part of the game that this situation should have been addressed during the expansion's design phase.<p>Nerfing should be the last resort of the developers, and in this case it probably is. Efforts to tune the ability haven't accomplished a lot, and as in the case of manaburn, only a drastic change can accomplish the necessary result. And yes, the change <I>is</i> necessary for the health of the game, much as some folks want to deny that. One of the chief principles of our writing here at Mobhunter has always been that the game is about more than the perspectives of one player or group of players; the Big Picture view is essential for understanding the game decisions that the designers make. Once again, this kind of thinking is required.<p>Looking at it globally, not locally, the changes to charm are both much needed and long overdue. While it's too bad that the fun of some players has to suffer, that doesn't make the change any less necessary.</font>
