<p><b>Hello,

<p>Can you please direct me to the location of zone / dungeon experience bonuses list on the EQ website. If there isn't one, could you please give me a listing or possibly have a listing placed in the EQ_manual in everyone's eq directory. I'm sure other players would benefit from this information as well.

<p>I realize that underutilized zones and dungeons recieve an experience bonus to entice players to go to zones / dungeons with poor loot, poor access for melee binding, poor pathing, etc. I'd like to hunt for experience and so would benefit from knowing which underutilized zones / dungeons give the most experience.

<p>Thanks in advance.</b>

<p>Sure. Actually, the best place to find the recent increases are on the web site. Head to EverQuest.com and look under the Producer's Letter. There's an archive at the top. Choose the Producer's Letter from January 14th, 2001.

<p>I'll copy the relevant part here. After all, we want people using these zones, it won't hurt to remind everyone that we've recently increased the experience gain for them.

<p>In this case, we decided that the most appropriate action for several underutilized dungeons would be to increase the ZEM; that is, increase the amount of experience that everyone gets when adventuring in the zone. 

<p>As of the next patch, you will receive additional experience (per kill) in the following zones:<br>
- Droga increased by 12% <br>
- Nurga increased by 12% <br>
- Solusek's Eye (SolA) increased by 13% <br>
- Najena increased by 13% <br>
- Befallen increased by 13% <br>
- Paw increased by 13% <br>
- Permafrost increased by 13% <br>
- Kaesora increased by 18% <br>
- Qeynos Catacombs increased by 20% <br>
- Runnyeye increased by 20% <br>
- Kerra Ridge increased by 20% <br>
- The Hole increased by 25% <br>

<p>Hope that helps.


<p><b>I'd like to comment on the changes made to the experience system on January 17th. I think that overall the changes were very good. The method used to "remove" the experience penalty for those classes that had them (and were sharing them with their groups) works well... mostly.

<p>The reason for having the experience sharing in groups the way that it had been since launch, as I understand it, was so that friends grouping together could stay together regardless of the classes they were playing. Well I must say, that system worked wonderfully. I play in a group with 5 RL friends. We started our characters together and do not play for experience unless we are playing together. Some of us do some trading or trade skills outside of the group. We play once a week for about 2.5 hours a session. We have been doing so for more than 20 months. We've stayed together easily through that time, advancing at the same pace, until recently. We have a warrior in our group who has started to outpace the rest of us. Due to the frequency of our playing (and several missed sessions) it has taken a few months to really see the difference. Since the experience bonus for warriors and rogues was not accounted for at the same time the experience penalty was for hybrids and intellegence based casters, groups of friends that play together can no longer stay together.

<p>The idea of having a system that allows a group of friends like us to do what we are doing was a great one that apparently became pretty obvious during the beta testing. The changes to the experience system breaks that for any groups that have warriors or rogues in them, especially once the warrior's or rogue's level exceeds the rest of the group. They then start taking a larger percentage of the experience before class modifiers are applied.

<p>Is there anything that can be done about this? Do you have suggestions for dealing with it?

<p>I figured I may as well tackle these issues together, since they are both relatively old issues about experience.

<p>Actually, we looked at this very carefully. No matter what class or race combination you choose, if you play together at all times, characters will never gain a gap wide enough that they can't gain experience together. In fact, I think I remember that the widest possible gap was about two levels by the time they reach 60th level. But that was a while back, and it might have been three levels. But even at the extreme characters that play together will always be within experience range for grouping. And with the way experience is divided now, there is a slight advantage to the lower level group members that helps to prevent separation.

<p>I'm not sure what is happening with your warrior.
