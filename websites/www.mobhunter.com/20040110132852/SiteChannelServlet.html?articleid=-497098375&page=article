<BIG>Gone to Earth</BIG><p>Yesterday we were treated to a new .dll file and a tiny patch message:<p><B>** Plane of Earth **<p>We have made some changes to the Earth-Infused Crystal.  If you have one of these crystals, you need to talk to Muzzrap Dirtdigger in the Plane of Tranquility.  He will help you to obtain what you need.</B><p>People have been anticipating that something would be happening to Plane of Earth B for a while now. In case you haven't been keeping up on the various uberguild message boards, the Rathe Council in PoEB is the last of the elemental gods to evade death at the hands of players--presumably being the final stop before entrance to Plane of Time is gained. The Council is made up of twelve seemingly unsplittable mobs, half of which are unmezable, and so far nobody has come up with a strategy to beat them. Well, kinda, but more on that later.<p>So what is this patch change all about?<p>Entrance to PoEB is gained by defeating a series of ring events in Plane of Earth within a given time frame. Doing so spawns a final mob that has to be killed to obtain a key. Until the patch, one key allowed an entire raid force to enter PoEB. Post-patch, instead of a key that lets a single person shuffle his or her guild into the next zone, the PoE boss drops up to three key parts that summon six keys usable only by individuals. In other words, now instead of an entire guild entering PoEB after defeating the ring event once, a maximum of 18 people can gain access per kill.<p>There have been timesinks for endgame zones before--Veeshan's Peak, Sleeper's Tomb, Vex Thal... all these required nasty camps and/or repetitive killing to get a guild inside. We thought PoP was supposed to eliminate this kind of timesink, but it appears more and more that such things are inevitable.<p>So why is this situation any different? Well, a few reasons. First, the final PoE mob <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=702f5d88137c281b398e124de4b807b6&amp;threadid=6637">doesn't drop key parts every time</a>--it can drop a big fat zero. Second, the ring events needed to spawn the boss mob are horrendously buggy. Arlos, a monk in Legacy of Steel, <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=38561.topic&amp;start=22&amp;stop=22">explained it</a> well:<p><B>First, in order to get the key, you have to have several ring events ALL work PERFECTLY. We all know what EQ ring events are like, yes? Buggier than an anthill. Then, you have to get to a final mob. First, you have to hope that he even SPAWNS, even if all the other rings worked right. Then, you have to hope when you go do him that he doesn't path to under the world (which he will do unless you are INCREDIBLY careful, we had this happen once). Then, on top of that, he doesn't even always drop the key parts! He used to drop 1-3 of them (ie, 6-18 in current incanration), however, someone killed him today, post change, and he dropped *ZERO*. Oh, and these are not short rings. Fastest I've heard of anyone doing this, start to finish, is on the order of 7+ hours.<p>So, lets review. You have to have several rings not get blown/broken by other guilds who are already in elementals. Then, you have to have all those rings work PERFECTLY. Then, the mob has to spawn properly. Then, you have to get to him in a short amount of time, and hope he actually paths, instead of just falling under the world. Then, he has to actually drop key parts, and apparently as of today, he dropped NONE. (nor did the bosses of the rings). Now remember, these rings at best respawn only in a matter of days, and in several cases, they have been bugged for WEEKS. I know on the Rathe, at least 1 ring was down, broken, wouldn't respawn, period, for 3+ weeks, and the GMs would NOT repop the zone to fix it.</B><p>So it's not a matter of a guild defeating a ring event X number or times to flag Y number of players; even if everything in the buggy PoE zone worked perfectly, it could still take weeks to get enough keys to allow a guild to enter PoEB due to the random nature of the drops. Instead of just relying upon their level of skill, players now have to depend an awful lot on luck--and EQ's dubious random number generator.<p>But one question still remains unanswered: Why was this change necessary? Two answers come to mind.<p>The first, most obvious choice is that the Plane of Time isn't finished yet and SOE needed a way to keep players out until the zone is done. History provides plenty of precedent for this, dating all the way back to the arrival of Plane of Fear. Consistently through each expansion, the endgame zone hasn't been &quot;done&quot; until multiple guilds have gained access to it and forced developers to make it playable. So despite reports that devs at the Vegas FanFaire clearly stated that Time is ready to go, a lot of players simply don't believe it.<p>Never having been inside Time myself (aside from <a href="http://www.eqzoneviewer.com/">staring at the walls</a>), I can't say whether it's done or not. However, it seems like SOE already has a pretty effective way to keep players out of Time if that's their goal--the Rathe Council. Sure, they could simply tone down the Council and make it beatable by players, which would shift the timesink from a nasty encounter to this key business. But perhaps that's not the reason for the patch.<p>See, one guild with PoEB access got a bright idea of how to add damage output to their raid and have a shot against the Rathe Council. They invited other players flagged for the elemental planes to join them, and brought a force of 200 or so into PoEB and took on the Council. While the army lost, it would only be a matter of time before a zerg force somewhere would be able to pull it off. The patch renders this tactic impracticle due to the time required to key 200 players for the zone.<p>While the easy response is simply to scream &quot;SOE is just screwing players because Time isn't done yet,&quot; you do kind of have to admit that there was a real reason for the change to the PoEB key. But before you jump down my throat for defending the patch, let me make something clear.<p><B>The way the PoEB key works now is unfair to players.</B> In order to make it fair, some things have to change:<p>1) <I>The rings in PoE have to work.</I> No bugs, no mobs despawning, no pathing under the world. The events need to work. Period.<p>2) <I>The key event shouldn't take 7+ hours to complete.</I> Yes, getting to PoEB should require dedication, but it isn't the final zone in the game; several hours is fair, but the current length of time isn't.<p>3) <I>Keys should drop every time.</I> Even if a guild got 18 keys per successful ring completion, it would take them four kills to key a raid force of 72. Make the event only triggerable once a week if you must, which would mean a typical guild would take at least a month to get enough keys. Given the number of guilds already in the elemental planes, that month is a generous estimate at best. Considering the numbers, 18 keys per kill is the minimum that should drop. Hey, killing the Emperor in Vex Thal gives you 40 key parts each time.<p>4) <I>The Rathe Council has to be beatable by a raid of 72 people.</I> I find it suspect that the very best guilds in EverQuest have spent this long trying to kill the Council without success. Yes, access to Plane of Time should be damn hard to get--but it needs to be within the realm of possibility.<p>If all those conditions are met, then the change to the PoEB key is fair. I don't know about you, but I think 200-person zerg armies are beyond cheesy, and I certainly don't want to see them used as a cheap means of beating tough content. But the fairness has to go both ways--encounters must be winnable through legitimate means or the game is simply no fun. Clearly SOE has to do their part and fix the encounters leading up to the key drop. Then it's up to the players to do what they do best and reveal what Plane of Time has to offer.<p><BIG>The Lords of Flatbush</BIG><p>As you probably know by now, the EverQuest franchise has spawned yet another offspring: <a href="http://lordsofeverquest.station.sony.com/">Lords of EverQuest</a>, a real-time strategy game that includes some familiar faces.<p>Leading up to the official announcement was another one of SOE Web design guru Nathan Pearce's trademark <a href="http://lordsofeverquest.station.sony.com/newsview.jsp?story=55229">teaser campaigns</a> that used the everquest.com site to tantalize players with mysterious pictures. Unlike previous efforts, however, this one included references to certain people in the EQ online community, including yours truly.<p>I have to admit, it was a lot of fun to see the speculation flying around the Net as to what my involvement might be. My name doesn't get tossed around that much outside of this site--not <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=38473.topic">often</a>, anyway. So I kept my mouth shut, despite the fact that I was as much in the dark as anyone else.<p>In any case, RTS games aren't my cup of tea, and I was a little disappointed that the first Iksar picture wasn't a teaser for an upcoming EQ expansion. Instead, we have EQ turning into Warcraft while Warcraft is turning into EQ. Oh well, the next expansion should turn up soon enough. <p>Next time they use my name I'm going to have to ask for royalties...<p><BIG>Coup Coup Ca-Choo</BIG><p>Where, oh where have the warriors gone? Take a look at the <a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior">Steel Warrior board</a> and all you'll see are locked threads. Has the lack of a real taunt skill finally driven our tin-plated friends over the brink?<p>Fear not--warriors have neither burned out nor faded away. They just packed up and moved to a <a href="http://steelwarrior.xwarzone.com/">new board</a> that is no longer tied to the purse strings of EZBoard. Seems the old board's owner has been MIA for while, and the best way to ensure the community's future was to move on. Good luck at the new digs, and tanks for the memories.<p>Now I have yet another @#$%^&amp;* message board to sign up for. Yippee.<p><BIG>Must Be Their Spring Break, Too</BIG><p>You may recall a few patches ago when it was announced that alternate entry quests for several Planes of Power zones were changed to allow for easier access to places like Crypt of Decay and Halls of Honor. Well, that was all very well and good, it seems, until the quest mobs recently <a href="http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=6467.topic">went missing</a> entirely. One poster wrote:<p><B>According to the GM, the key mobs have been intentionally perma-killed (he mentioned something about these quests being further changed but didn't go into any specifics) and will be restored in the next patch (which is not even scheduled), so it might be quite some time before we can resume our regular questing.</B><p>Perhaps the key mobs are partying it up in Cancun or something. Expect to see Grimor Plaguebringer and his pals show up on the next <I>Mobs Gone Wild</I> video.<p><BIG>Not <I>Just</I> for Geeks, Anyway</BIG><p>While the usual trend in the media is to characterize EQ players as obsessive and sometimes suicidal freaks who lose touch with reality, a glimmer of positive press has surfaced over on the BBC's site.<p>A recent <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/nottinghamshire/2939175.stm">article</a> about a psychologist's study of online gaming reveals that (gasp!) EverQuest isn't the most unhealthy thing you can do with your time. Among the study's findings:<p><B>- Over 60% of players were older than 19. <p>- About 85% of players were male. <p>- Fifteen percent of people play for more than 50 hours a week. <p>- A &quot;significant minority&quot; (15%) adopt a character gender opposite to their own.</B><p>Only 15%? Darn, so much for steamy mangina action. <p>That's about all the news I have for you today. Things have been a little quiet since <a href="http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13013">Absor was replaced</a> by a new guy. Expect to see &quot;The PoEB key is working as intended&quot; scrolling at the bottom of your screens real soon now.
