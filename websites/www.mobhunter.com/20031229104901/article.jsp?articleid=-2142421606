   <font class="ArticleText">Going to touch on a whole lot of topics from a lot of<br>different games. We'll start off with EverQuest since that is that I play and what most readers play.<p>I've touched on it a bunch recently but I'm going to editorialize here for a minute about all the major exploits occuring, or atleast becoming well known. I use the term major exploits in the sense that these are not just minor bugs being abused in the game world itself, such as if you make 2 gold by doing some tradeskill combine and do that a thousand times. <p>I'm talking pretty much about hacks. These have existed for a long time in different forms, and it's only recently that their abuse has become blatant and we might see some fixes.<p>I use the term might because of the nature of the problem which goes to the very core of the game. This may get technical but I'll try to keep it as simple as I can. <p>There are a few ways you can make a multiplayer game. The ideal method is you have the server which controls and checks everything it is told by the various people playing. The game they run, the client, acts basically as a conduit for your input to go to the server, be verified, and then for all the necessary information required to display the game to be returned by the server and displayed. So in this case, if you move, your game tells the server you want to move to location x, y, z, the server verifies that this is in fact possible and valid, and returns to your game, the location where you actually are. Everything that occurs in the game, is handled by the server and the various game clients just interpret what it tells them.<p>Then you have the method EQ uses, which is that the client controls a lot of what it is doing, and is mostly receiving information from the server about other people. The problem with that is that if your client tells the server you're at position x, y, z, and it's halfway across the zone, the server just goes, whatever and you're there. In the past there were speed hacks, which likely amounted to altering one tiny spot in EQs memory area, and magically you could go bard speed or even faster because the server didn't bother to check if you were going 500 miles an hour, it just always goes yep that's ok.<p>Now there are and likely have been a whole number of other client side memory hacks that work in the same manner. For example, you could change the name displayed in your chat messages to whoever you wanted because it is controlled on the client. Find the memory location and change it and suddenly you can have it go &quot;Absor shouts 'LOL'&quot; if you want. What's worse is I'm not sure GMs and support people can even tell the difference, so how do you figure out who to ban when someone could be talking as Quarm in a zone with 150 people?<p>And besides hacks, the way this is setup has been the root cause of many bugs in the game, most notably the Heal-&gt;Death bugs. The reason is the CLIENT can actually kill you, if it believes you are dead, the server just buys that and you die, even if the server should know better. They pretty much cover this up with what I can only imagine to be hacks of their own, but it still exists and this contributes to one of the other reported player hacks, where you can use this to gate your character to their bind spot and not actually have to die.<p>The reason Sony did it the way they did is two fold, first, the game is very responsive. When you move, your character moves because it does not wait for verification from the server. It is more visibly resistant to ping time and packet loss because of this. Further, if you require the servers to check everything, that would probably mean you would require more expensive servers which costs more money.<p>What can be done about this? Unfortunately, the current EQLive team has to deal with extremely bad decisions made by people years ago who probably don't even work for them anymore. Honestly, anything other than moving everything off the client and to the server, would be a bandaid fix, and chances are doing that, would take an immense amount of work. It would almost be easier to rewrite both from scratch and it is hard to believe that would occur although with the next expansion we're supposed to get a new graphics engine, its possible they could be reworking the communication as well.<p><big>A plea from the homeless</big><p>In other game news, a few weeks ago I messed around on a few free UO shards and it was interesting although I quickly recalled why I left the game after being demolished by player killers. The free servers like that are an interesting topic in that atleast the few I played on, had a good number of players, no lag, and had everything that I remember from UO when I played it, yet people still pay EA to play the real thing, which admittedly I even debated because I could atleast avoid the socially inept.<p>But, I don't bring you news of that, apparently sometime in 2001 EA shut off house decay and it's actually been off since then because after awhile they realized if they enabled it, a lot of houses would decay at once and that could very well crash the servers. Anyways they seem to have been working on this for a long time and they have posted what might be the final <a href="http://www.uo.com/cgi-bin/newstools.pl?Article=8081" target="_new">bit of news</a> about it. Basically if you have a house on an inactive account you can re-activate it and save the house or something.<p>Another interesting part of that is that when a house decays in UO, all of the items in it fall to the ground. People wait outside of nearly decayed houses for this to occur because people are packrats and you can get tons of stuff by doing so. With so many houses slated to rot because they are on inactive accounts, patient people could get a lot of nice things and a lot of gold from it, not to mention that a lot of real estate, one of UOs bigger problems back in the day, should be freed up for other peoples houses.<p><big>The game with no name</big><p>More news about a different game? I've touched on Sigil who is comprised of a number of people who worked on the original EverQuest and the first expansions, and the fact that no one knows much if anything about their game. Continuing with their announcing who they've hired rather than announcing what they have been working on for like the last 2 years we have <a href="http://www.sigilgames.com/000091.php" target="_new">this</a> announcement which says they've hired 4 artists. I don't know any of them really but from the sounds of it they are all well known types in the fantasy art area, which atleast gives some hint as to what type of game it is going to be.<p>Also its way late but corresponds to their recent hiring of Tom King who has done a lot of quality user interface work, is the fact they hired the guy who wrote the current EverQuest user interface, which is, other than the fact it needs to be updated so much, pretty much the best user interface of any online game and is one of EverQuests best features. Also interesting to note is that it appears as if Woody Hearn who does GUComics got a chance to <a href="http://www.gucomics.com/archives/view.php?cdate=20031211" target="_new">visit Sigil</a> as he thanks them in his own unique way. I'm not going to say what I'm thinking other than to say that Woody must be <a href="http://www.gucomics.com/archives/view.php?cdate=20031212" target="_new">a machine</a> because his comics are extremely well done and he puts out 5 a week. <p><big>So when can I start?</big><p>And onto another game. This time, <a href="http://www.gucomics.com/archives/view.php?cdate=20031209" target="_new">WoW</a> whos site has been updated with a <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/wow/townhall/dungeons.shtml" target="_new">bit of information</a> about the dungeons in the Blizzard MMORPG due out whenever they feel like it.<p>Overall it's a relatively boring and non-descript update, however it features a number of pictures, one of which illustrates an interesting feature. Basically it seems as if instead of simple no-drop items like EQ has, they will have items that only become no-drop, after they are equipped. So you can get nice things in a group or on a raid, and trade them to people who need them more.<p><big>Back Home</big><p>Finally, heading back to where we started with EverQuest, we have continued interaction by the EQLive team on a variety of messageboards. I talked about this recently in how over time it became just Absor and that was if the gods blessed your messageboard and it was still about the same odds as winning the lottery to have him post, and it was pretty much 100% chance that if he posted, it was to inform you that your class was due for a <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessage?topicID=18479.topic" target="_new">nerfing</a>.<p>Above and beyond their discussion about the upcoming melee changes, you have been able to find them in a variety of threads, giving real, concrete answers which I think has caused a widespread state of shock. Even I was shocked to see Rytan and Kavhok answering real questions with real answers not community manager doubletalk or 'We'll look into it'. Here's a good example where Rytan <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessage?topicID=18485.topic" target="_new">explains</a> the pluses and minuses for bards in the upcoming patch. He just tells it like it is, you get screwed here, we fixed this, we made this better, and I just wanted you to know.<p>Hopefully, this continues and the initial freaking out that is going on, on a few messageboards wears down. It's great that they post, but it causes people to post completely stupid topics addressed to them. For whatever reason, it just feels different to have the people who are actually working on something, be the ones commenting about it. These aren't politicians trying to not say the wrong thing, they know the answers and they don't make a big deal out of giving the players some answers and information.<p><big>*Update!*</big><p>While roaming around looking for information on the patch reportedly due tomorrow, I found <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=42932.topic" target="_new">this post</a> by Kavhok detailing how the main aspect expected to be patched in, is not going to make it.<p><b>The opening system and abilities associated with it will not be going live on Tuesday. Feedback from here, other boards, emails, and players on the Test server, as well as our own testing, indicate that the system needs more work. We'll continue to post here as we make changes.</b><p>The complaint a lot of people had about the abilities is that hybrids don't have to wait for openings to use their abilities and it seemed somewhat redundant to have to wait for openings, have individual opening timers, AND have an endurance bar.  The simplest solution would be to simply let people use whatever they want, whenever they want, with the restriction being on your endurance, and not waiting on an opening.<p>Further he details that the monk lull line is not going live.  I'm not sure if the warrior provoke line is also being postponed since the boards are down, but it seemed like warriors were happier with their stuff more than monks.<p>Overall, I dunno how I feel.  I thought it was an interesting way to do it, and I was looking forward to it, and now it's difficult to say when we'll see anything.<p><big>No really, I didn't mean it!</big><p>In a bit scarier news for some of us we have <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2003/12/12/sims_online_newspaper/index.html" target="_new">this story</a> (viewing an ad probably required), which details an occurance in the Sims Online where basically a person who runs a website about a particular area of the game, <i>Alphaville</i>, appears to have been banned because of critical commentary about the makers of the game, Maxis and EA.<p>I don't play the game, never have and I don't read the site but it does not appear that he was involved really in anything that would generally warrant being banned from the game, he actually seems to contribute to the community.<p>Of course, they don't need a reason to ban anyone, and even if they are banning him to censor him, that's something they can certainly do.  The question is really, is that a smart thing to do, and why bother, it's unlikely that anything he said or for example that I might say, pushes people away from the game, even when negative.  <p>What's next, banning people who post anything negative on any messageboards?</font>
