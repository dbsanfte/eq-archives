				<div class="entry">
					<p>I wanted to post a few points of clarification about the Copernicus (Kingdoms of Amalur) teaser that was recently <a title="leaky pants" href="http://kotaku.com/5924410/the-trailer-you-werent-supposed-to-see-for-a-game-youll-never-play" target="_blank">leaked to Kotaku</a>. After we released the environment fly-through video in the last days of 38 Studios, there were a lot of misconceptions about what the video was intended to be, and I don&#8217;t want the same fate to befall this piece.</p>
<ul>
<li>This teaser video was a work in progress, from the illustrations to the game footage to the audio. It was a rough cut to get the pacing right; pretty much every asset would have been reworked or replaced by the time it went final. In fact, there were some tweaks to the script that had been made, but we never got around to recording the updated read-through.</li>
<li>The finished teaser was intended to be released at the time of the MMO&#8217;s announcement. It likely would have been accompanied by a video of gameplay footage, or possibly with a live hands-on demo depending on when and where it was first revealed.</li>
<li>The logo at the end was based upon the <a title="it's Wikipedia, so it must be right" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros" target="_blank">ouroboros</a>, an ancient symbol of the cyclical nature of the universe. This symbol has great significance to the story of Amalur, a world trapped in an unending cycle of creation and destruction. And yes, we had this symbol before the Elder Scrolls Online announced using a similar logo (that&#8217;s what you get for basing your IP on classic themes).</li>
<li>The illustrated style showcased in the teaser was something you would have seen throughout the game. Our cinematics team was packed with amazing illustrators, and we were using animation like this to introduce our races and tell little bits of history you&#8217;d encounter as you traveled through Amalur.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seeing this video posted online gives me a mix of emotions. On the one hand, I love this teaser and am very proud of the work it represents. On the other hand, it makes me sad to be faced once more by what could have been.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wanted to get these points across because it would be unfair to the cinematics or audio teams for anyone seeing this to think it represented a final version of a trailer. Even though it&#8217;s really cool, it would have been spectacular by the time we were done with it. I wish you could see it with the same context we did on the inside of the studio, through the eyes of a passionate team that wanted to make something really special.</p>
<p>I still miss that world something fierce.

<p>I&#8217;ve had reporters and others ask me about how this situation has affected my feelings toward Curt. That&#8217;s an intensely personal question, but today&#8217;s events have moved me to answer it in broad terms&#8211;and I&#8217;d rather do it on my own blog than in someone else&#8217;s story.</p>

					<p>I have started and abandoned several posts over the past few weeks. I knew I needed to write something&#8230; but what story did I want to tell? An angry tirade about being screwed over? A scathing tell-all about what really happened inside 38? A self-pitying plea for a job? So many emotions inside me, a turbid swirl screaming for an outlet.</p>
<p>So this is what I&#8217;ve come up with.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>As of today, everyone at 38 Studios Providence and Baltimore has been laid off.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very sad end to nearly six years of great work. Despite the odds, I believed in the dream we all shared. I believed with all my heart.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure the public will ever know the beauty of what we built&#8230; that&#8217;s maybe the hardest part of it all. We snuck out a pretty, but dated, environment fly-through and a few key images, but there is so much more that would take your breath away. I truly hope you get to see it, in some form.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what will happen to Amalur. It will no doubt be tied up in various legal proceedings for some time, both game assets and the intellectual property as a whole.</p>
<p>As people lay blame and the commentators turn a heartbreaking situation into the latest industry punchline, some will probably portray the team as a bunch of screw-ups who couldn&#8217;t ship a game. The story has so, so much more to it than that. In short order, you will start hearing truths, half-truths, and lies, as well as things that are true from a certain perspective. In the end, perspectives are what makes up history&#8230; real truth lies in the midst of it somewhere.</p>
<p>Perhaps someday I&#8217;ll talk more about my perspective&#8230; but not today.</p>
<p>Today, I mourn for what almost was. Because believe it or not, we came <em>so close </em>to pulling it off.</p>
<p>On to the next dream.

<p>Why is this cool? Well, it&#8217;s like being paid to play demos for two of the best games of 2012. It&#8217;s also cool because of the thought and attention put into this idea. The details were lovingly nurtured, down to the symbols that appear on the armor. There&#8217;s a story in everything.</p>
<p>Reckoning is the gateway to <a title="The one true world." href="http://www.amalur.com/" target="_blank">Amalur</a>, the setting for our upcoming MMO as well. I&#8217;m proud to have worked on these games, and can&#8217;t wait until they&#8217;re in players hands!</p>
<p>The time draws near&#8230;

					<p>This is a big freaking list. Either I&#8217;m getting worse at narrowing down my choices for favorite albums, or maybe it really was just that good a year. There were a ton of releases I really liked, with an exciting blend of new talent along with reliable veterans making some of their best records in ages.</p>
<p>The downside of this phenomenon is that it takes me a hell of a long time to write this annual music post, and I&#8217;m inherently lazy. But man, there&#8217;s some music here I just really have to talk about. So here we go.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I&#8217;d imagine most people still aware that this blog exists realize that I have been working for 38 Studios for the last five years (yeah, it&#8217;s been that long!). We&#8217;ve been very quiet about the specifics of what we&#8217;re doing, other than that we set out to make an MMO, acquired an excellent RPG team, relocated to Providence, and are set to release <a title="Best. RPG. Ever." href="http://reckoning.amalur.com/" target="_blank">Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning</a> in February. So all in all, an eventful half-decade.</p>
<p>All the while we&#8217;ve continued the labor of love that is our MMO, though we remain quiet about it. We&#8217;re going to remain so for a bit longer, but we&#8217;ve started to take the wrapper off more and more of the world behind the games. The deepest dive into the lore of the world comes in the form of our new <a title="Sweet baby!" href="http://www.amalur.com" target="_blank">Amalur.com website</a>.</p>
<p>This is a big deal to me, as I&#8217;m personally curating the writing as we take the mounds of internal documentation and fashion it for an outside audience. Our artists and web designers are doing some beautiful work, and the site will be evolving and expanding *a lot* over time. The first content drop is over 16,000 words, but we&#8217;ve barely scratched the surface of the material we&#8217;ve got to share.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting about the Amalur.com project is that the site isn&#8217;t made to promote a specific product. Rather, it&#8217;s a gateway to exploring a deeper history than any single title could portray. If we do our jobs right, Amalur.com will help reinforce the connections between products within a single consistent universe.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy it.

					<p>Don&#8217;t get around much anymore&#8211;in blog posts, I mean. But hey, as long as I can stay ahead of <a title="Lazier than I am!" href="http://www.hartsman.com/" target="_blank">Hartsman</a> (who, as a big-money executive, does no actual work and thus lacks any excuse for not blogging), I figure I&#8217;m doing okay.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m headed down to New York Comic Con this week for a panel scheduled on Friday at 1:30 pm called <a title="Come one, come all" href="http://nycc11.mapyourshow.com/5_0/sessions/sessiondetails.cfm?ScheduledSessionID=1BAFC8" target="_blank">Creating a World Worth Saving</a>. I&#8217;ll be joining our own Creator of Worlds, R.A. Salvatore, plus Andrew Auseon and Ian Frazier from the <a title="Hey, you can preorder it" href="http://www.reckoning.com" target="_blank">Reckoning</a> team. We&#8217;ll talk both theory and practice of how you develop a world meant to span a whole ecosystem of products, and in specific about how we used those principles to craft the narrative of the RPG.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still <em>slightly </em>too early to reveal hard facts about our MMO, but I&#8217;ll sneak some storyline tidbits in there. Until our PR guy tackles me and drags me from the stage, that is.
