   <font class="ArticleText"><BIG>Introduction</BIG><p>Despite the name, Everquest has never entirely been about quests. In fact in the scheme of all roleplaying games, it's quests are some of the worst that I can recall. Text based games in the 80s had better quests, and single player games now, put Everquest and most MMORPGs to shame.<p>Today we're going to look at why that is, and look at some of the ways developers of recent and future MMORPGs have approached it, and I of course will detail what I think.<p>First off why there is little to no Quest in Everquest. The reason for this is simple, and it's that despite the name, Quests were and always have been an afterthought for the developers. There is no real quest system in Everquest, just simple keywords, and they are forced to use other items to signify where you are in the quest.<p>Further, on top of lacking a quest system, they approach quests by making them as vague as possible, meaning that if you go to a zone and find a new quest, the chances of you hitting a wall at some point is extremely high. Virtually any quest of any substance is solved by pooling information on messageboards, and you will virtually never have the satisfaction of solving a quest yourself without help from numerous other people, who themselves may have just stumbled on the answer.<p>The reason they do that is because of the simple nature of the system in Everquest and because of spoilers. The vagueness is what makes quests take as long as they do to solve and become widely known. Even though many of these same quests may require you to spend significant amounts of time farming various drops, that is not enough, and they in many cases don't even tell you what you have to do or where to do it.<p>Also I do not classify the lost dungeons as quests, because you know what to do and there are just a few types and are always the same.<p>For the most part, other MMORPGs have taken similar approaches or not even touched quests. Ultima Online for example opened with virtually nothing even close, and then later had things similar to the LDON quests although even simpler. I haven't kept track of UO but I can't imagine it got much better. In many cases instead of quests, the focus of some games is supposed to be fighting other players as in Shadowbane or DAOC which I think has started to go away from the PvP focus it had and moved more towards atleast a balance. AO featured a LDON style (or you could say ldon featured an ao style..) adventure system which let you have your own area to complete it. SWG feature similar style stuff and again tends to try to take the world/faction approach to this sort of thing and to create sides and use that as a basis for interaction.<p>The main issues with all those are the same, virtually no depth and a backwards approach to quests. <p><BIG>Next Generation games</BIG><p>The next generation games it's difficult to say so far, but here's my early take on what they've said or what their websites say.<p><strong>WoW</strong> - This game may be taking the route that some others have as I noted in that it features PvP between different sides as a cornerstone. Quests do exist and they claim that they will add new quests every month, which is of course what everyone claims until they actually ship the game. In their <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/wow/faq/" target="_new">FAQ</a> I was able to find a single question in the gameplay section about quests...<p><b>Will there be very large or continued quests that take a lot of steps to fully complete </b><p><strong>Heck yeah! There will be &quot;small&quot; multipart quests, which you might be able to finish in several days, and epic &quot;life quests&quot; that will span your entire adventuring career. </strong><p>That is of course extremely brief which is an ongoing theme here about the future games, there is virtually no mention or discussion about quests. And it's not just the developers dodging the question in all cases, but that I don't even see players asking when I go to the messageboards which combined with the success of many of these games who are lacking in them, makes me wonder if they are even a factor. By the way, I noticed Blizzard looking for a <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/jobopp/wow-community-manager.shtml" target="_new">Community Manager</a>, only then I noticed these two things...<p><strong>Excellent written and verbal communication skills</strong><p>That excludes me, however...<p><strong>Language ability in Korean is a plus, but not required.</strong><p><p align="center"><strong><img
src="http://www.mobhunter.com/images/articles/kor.gif"
width="142" height="26"></strong><p><p align="left">Moving on...<p><strong>EverQuest 2</strong> - Once again, it appears the focus is decidedly not on quests, and more on a faction system of sorts. As far as I can tell, they are taking the same or similar approach as EQ1. There is a huge thread detailing all of <a href="http://www.everquest-2.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=5993" target="_new">Moorgards posts</a> on the EQ2 messageboards that is split into different sections and while there may be dozens of posts about other subjects, there is a single one on quests. Also note, I e-mailed Moorgard asking for any additional information, the only game I did that for mind you, and got no response back.<p><strong>If all quests are completely obvious, it takes away depth from the game. Personally, I like it when there are players to a game that don't get discovered for a long time. It's fun to come across some mysterious quest that others might not know about--it gives you a feeling of accomplishment and uniqueness. But sometimes that depth is aided by the existence of spoiler sites, because otherwise a lot of players would never find that really cool content. </strong><p>That of course, is exactly what is <strong>wrong</strong> with Everquests quests. Elsewhere I was able to find out more information, including that it has a Quest Log, and removes the need to guess keywords or phrases. Both of those things are good, but again the comment above is unfortunate and you should start to bookmark spoiler sites in advance, because it seems like the quests themselves are going to have the same fundamental issues as EQ.<p><strong>UXO</strong> - This is a game I haven't really touched on much here mostly because I didn't know a lot about it and didn't really go out looking. For those who don't know UxO is Ultima X: Odyssey, which is Origins next generation MMORPG game. I still don't really know a lot about the specific nature of the game however I saw their website and some specifics of their <a href="http://uxo.ea.com/feature_adventure.html" target="_new">adventure/quest system</a>. Right off the bat you get the distinct impression unlike looking at the other games out now and coming out in the future that it is a prominent feature of the game and not an afterthought.<p>First off, it uses the old Ultima virtue system, and it claims to tailor quests to the virtue you are following...<p><strong>For example, if you are one who seeks Justice, you may come across the body of a slain innocent and be given the opportunity to avenge his death. Similarly, if you're seeking Compassion, you may be asked to help rescue a kidnapped priestess. Moreover, most quests have multiple branches, allowing for a variety of outcomes and opportunities for you to gain points in more than one Virtue. The Odyssey Adventure System also dynamically customizes the quest to suit you or your party's level by adjusting the length, difficulty, and number of different tasks assigned in each quest.</strong><p>Ok, you had me at dynamic quests, multiple branches and outcomes, and adjusting difficulty, but go on...<p><strong>To keep track of your quest you'll locate the quest gem on your character portrait -- it points in the direction of the next objective and is updated automatically as your quest unfolds. </strong><p>Quests with direction, figuratively and literally?<p><strong>At launch, the game is slated to feature more than 200 unique quests, lasting from 30 minutes to 8 hours. </strong><p>200 quests doesn't sound like a lot, and it's tough to say how it will work out in that regards but the main point I wanted to focus on was that they lasted different amounts of time, including obviously involved ones lasting up to 8 hours. That hopefully isn't in a row, but just total.<p>I key on the UXO system mostly because it follows the way I wish Everquest would have taken. The game itself, who knows, it sounds a bit different than any of the others, which might be a good thing, or a bad thing. <p><BIG>The rules</BIG><p>Now after going over the next generation I'll detail the way Quests should be done, using EQ as the basis although the basic rules apply everywhere. Those rules are:<p><strong>Quests have multiple steps</strong> - Probably around half or more of Everquests <em>quests</em> are single step delivery type of quests, where you gain zero satisfaction from doing them. Virtually all quests should have multiple steps.<p><strong>Quests have multiple solutions</strong> - This wouldn't have to apply to every step, but most steps where possible, would have multiple ways the player could solve it. An example of a game where this is done well would be the Fallout games. Any given quest step in these games might have 2-5 different solutions, which in turn have consequences of their own (I'll get to that). In the case of Everquest, say you had to get an item from an NPC. You could just kill the NPC, which would have consequences even if it's just faction, and the quest might branch because of that, or you could do a subquest for the NPC, or you could if you have a rogue in your group, steal it.<p><strong>Quests have direction</strong> - There can and should be parts that are almost puzzle like in nature, but at all points in time, the player should have some idea of where to go and what they have to do next. The challenge should be in accomplishing the goal and not finding out what the goal is.<p><strong>Quests can branch</strong> - While not every quest would have to feature this, there would be times when a quest could fork one of two or more directions based on the actions the player or players take.<p><strong>Quests are not just for soloing</strong> - Everquest is a group game and there should therefore be quests for groups, and single solo players and for larger groups of people.<p><strong>Quests have consequences</strong> - The word consequences sounds ominous but I mean both good and bad consequnces. One common one in a quest system could be unlocking of other quests, or faction bonuses and adjustments. Similarly a bad consequence could be negative faction or worse. Quests would affect the game world and not just for your character. An example of this can already be found in Everquest where you can rescue slaves in droga (or nurga?) and then they reappear in their home town and give quests to anyone. That isn't exactly what I'd envision, but it's a step in the right direction. Further, no quest would ever have negative consequences for other players in a PvE game, so no average player doable quest would block off npcs or other quests for other players. Negative consequences on a per person basis is ok, meaning if you do something wrong like murder an NPC, you will personally face consequences but others will not.<p><strong>Quests have rewards</strong> - Rewards in a game like Everquest come in many forms. There is of course the very tangible loot and platinum rewards, or experience rewards and those are good. In a good quest system however, as I mentioned above, quests could unlock other quests, or unfold into larger quests. Further, many quests would have unique rewards that would encourage players to do them. <p><BIG>The (distant?) future</BIG><p>I've talked a bit about some of the upcoming games and what I can tell about how they approach it, and things don't necessarily look that great in this area. It's difficult to explain exactly why there is such a gap between the nature of single player RPG quests and MMORPG quests but one factor has to be the way designers seem to approach MMORPGs.<p>In many cases it seems that the focus is squarely on creating a <em>world</em>, which in of itself is not bad, but at the expense of fun, it becomes a problem. In a single player game, the goal of the designers is simply to entertain and engage the player, and the world that is inherently created from that is more of an afterthought than the focus. Oddly enough, virtually every single player roleplaying game released since the dark ages of the Commodore 64 have had more engaging quests and storylines than MMORPGs to date, and the trend for the most part looks to continue as game after game seems much happier about your ability to log on and sit around and do tradeskills to level up, than about your ability to go out and kill stuff. There is a reason that tradeskills don't really exist in single player games, and that reason is they aren't really that much fun.<p>As usual I'm curious to know what others think, so go ahead and post your thoughts on the past, present and future of quests and interactivity in MMORPGs.<br></font>
