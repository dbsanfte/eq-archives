   <font class="ArticleText"><BIG>Fan Faire, more like Drunk Faire am I right?</BIG><p>First off let's go over some of the recent happenings in the world of Everquest. While anything of note is hard to come by, even with the recent Fan Faire, and it being a few weeks since the lost dungeons were found, there have been a few things said, and a few things not said recently I feel the need to touch on.<p>It's hard to find any real information from the Fan Faire as in real, direct answers. Some reports indicate that the atmosphere was more <em>angry</em> than previous ones, player wise, in particular pure melee types. In fact people have reported that the Sony people refused to answer any questions regarding pure melee and/or the balance of the classes other than to say they are working on it. I have a lot to say about class balance, and contrary to what you might think, I'm not one who feels they are that out of balance, but I'll go into all that another time, other than to say that Warriors are really making me sad lately at how whiny they've become. It pains me to say it but we went from the best class, community wise, as in it was rare to see a complaint, to where the warrior board literally has 2 entire forums dedicated to complaining and all the other forums are filled with it. <p>That isn't to say some improvements couldn't be made to fix the problems that do exist with the melee classes, in particular warriors and monks, but that things aren't as bad as some seem to think. Hopefully we get some well thought out solutions to the actual problems, which are the 'stackability' of warriors, and the utility of monks. For warriors a major issue is simply that it doesn't make sense to have more than x number, the rest are virtual dead weight for example on raids. After 2 warriors or whatever, you'd be a lot better off having more rogues. The issue for monks is that they do less damage than rogues, but what else do they really bring to the table, again, you'd be better having maybe one monk for pulling if that, and the rest would be more efficient if they were rogues.<p>Let's point out some of the other information that has trickled out from the Fan Faire, this is mostly taken from <a href="http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=18880.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=20"
target="_new">this post</a> from the paladin messageboards which features guest appearances by Scott Hartsman, and Absor himself, along with an odd cavalcade of paladin complaining.<p><strong>LDoN hard missions at 65 are receiving a points boost to 105, which should be on test now and should go live next patch. According to SOE logging, hard missions only take 10 minutes longer than normal missions ON AVERAGE.</strong><p>I think using time to complete them is not the best way to do it. While time should always be a factor, there is also risk, and difficulty which on <em>high risk</em> adventures, is obviously higher, upwards of three times. The reason things are skewed time wise is that the people doing hard adventures, are the people who can do them and have the gear to do so. I tend to try to only do high risk adventures simply because it's less boring and I'd say that right now it's about equivilent point wise for time spent to normal adventures, but again the risk is vastly different. Overall though 105 points would be fine and that will if it gets implemented be a great change.<p><strong>LDoN adventurues are dropping too much cash loot. They are aware of this and it will most likely be altered soon. So farm while you can.</strong><p>I have no idea what to make of that one since it doesn't seem that way at all to me, in fact you routinely get cloth armor items and black pearls even on high risk level 65 adventures. At most you get 5 platinum per mob, which doesn't exactly compare to the upwards of 20 you might get in the revamped droga.<p><strong>Next FF is RUMORED to be in Vegas again (and if they have their way the March one will be in Vegas from now on) and looks to be a HUGE party as it will be the 5th anniversary of EQ.</strong><p>This makes sense and is a good thing, that it's in Vegas atleast. The main reason is that it's generally easier and cheaper to get good deals to go to Vegas because it's a huge tourist spot, and it seems to lend itself to what apparently goes on at Fan Faire, which is lots of alcohol consumption, right Moorgard?<p><BIG>What?</BIG><p>Moving on, theres <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=41727.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=20"
target="_new">word</a> of a graphics engine upgrade for EQ. This is sort of surprising for a few reasons. First, I guess it doesn't make a lot of sense to upgrade Everquests graphics, which will cause it to more directly compete with EQ2, whos major feature in my eyes was an improved graphics engine. There are pictures in the November issue of CGM magazine for those who want to check it out for themselves, but here are my thoughts.<p>I suppose I'm concerned first of all that it will go down similar to the Luclin upgrade, which even after being improved significantly from the time of release, hurt the game in a lot of areas. To this day I still do not use Luclin models and most people I know, do not have them all enabled because they don't really look right, and they are absolute resource hogs. That all affects the game negatively because it means we as players get less armor textures so we all pretty much look the same, except for dyes of course.<p>A full on revamp of the engine could go either way really. One of the issues with the luclin upgrade was the fact it was tacked on, hacked in, and you could do things one way or the other, so really neither way was that great. In essence I'm saying that it has to be ground up, and it almost has to be mandatory.<p>My final thought is that I guess I wonder why?, why even bother. Just about everyone accepts the way EQ looks and the way the old zones are, it seems sort of like a waste of a number of peoples time to go back and retrofit an upgraded graphics engine to the game. For those not technical enough to know, a few things have to occur for a good upgrade. First off, from what I've seen, they are doing completely new geometry which means the zones completely redone, and then a basic requirement of that and of the upgrade is all new textures, for everything. Those things are just the start since you'd probably want to redo all the models, and all the textures for them as well since luclin models suck, and old models are old.<p>So it all comes down to who the heck is doing all this and why aren't they doing other things, I'd much rather have completely new zones than have so many useless zones look better, but that's just me.<p><BIG>Bugged Collection quests?</BIG><p>Next up we look at collection quests with the lost dungeons. It seems like every player has their favorite type but almost universally, players dislike collection quests where you are sent to collect 20-30 drops. Absor has taken note of the barrage of collection quest hatred threads and is <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?threadid=29126" target="_new">requesting feedback</a> on these missions, specific information that lets them track down the issue.<p>What I've noticed and it seems other players have, is that there seems to be a huge difference between a collect 20 adventure and a collect 30 adventure, and not the way you would think, as it's a lot easier generally to finish the 30 one in a decent amount of time. My thoughts on the feedback is that I can solve collection quests right here and its a blanket solution. The problem with the quests is best illustrated by comparing them to slaughter missions. I know Furor has <a href="http://fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=09a74839ca30dfd2327397f0a8b7b00a&amp;threadid=8995&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=6" target="_new">already explained</a> some of this but bear with me. In slaughter missions you're tasked with killing 50-60 creatures to complete them.<p>Using those numbers as a baseline, one would expect a collect 30 to have around a 50% drop rate, and a collect 20 to have atleast a 33% drop rate. Unfortunately though it seems like each collection adventure was actually NOT setup this way and the end result is that two different collect 25 adventures, seem to have very different drop rates on the needed item. Sometimes you'll get through a collection mission in a normal amount of time, but other times, even if you're very well equipped and destroying the dungeon, the drops will be few and far between.<p>This is one time where using a script would be a good thing for consistancy sake, and if you used one, fix it so it can do math properly. One other very annoying thing lately is getting to the <em>fork</em> that exists in most of the lost dungeon zones, and the assassination or rescue target still not being up. This I believe is a byproduct of some of the adventures being actually fixed in beta, but it's time to review it so that by the time you get to the fork, things are good to go. Nothing sucks worse than having to guess in a high risk adventure when the boss/rescue target isn't up when you get there and then later after clearing a ton of mobs and being short on time, having the mob spawn the other direction.<p>That's about it this time around, word on the street, not on the Everquest Live website is that the next patch is October 8th, so we'll have to see what we get there. <p><BIG>** UPDATE **</BIG><p>This was added to the developers corner today, as has been rumored, changes are coming to combat the degree to which players could improve the lost dungeon items...<p><b>Augmentation changes for Update - PLEASE READ<br>As of our update on October 8th, the Broken Chunk of Coal, Cracked Ruby, and Charred Pebble will no longer be valid augmentations.  If you had these augmentations bonded to an item, you will find them on your cursor.  You can take those items to Dible Hedledrap in South Ro and he will restore your adventure points.<p>IMPORTANT NOTE:  You MUST have some open inventory space to hold these items!  Also, if you zone with those items on your cursor, they will disappear.  So when you log in before the update, make sure you have some free space in your inventory.  And when you log in after the update, make certain to get those items off your cursor and into your inventory.<p>This change is happening due to an issue with some of the new LDoN items.  These three augmentations will be replaced with three similar augmentations that fit into slot 7.  Along with that, pre-LDoN items that were given slot type 1 will now have slot type 7.<p>Essentially, this will mean no change for those with these augmentations in their pre-LDoN items.  It will, however, restrict the use of multiples of these augmentations on LDoN items.  We apologize for the changes, but these items needed to be more restricted to help maintain game balance.<p>Alan</b><p>The reason for the changes are as Alan says to prevent players from creating items which are pretty much out of balance even though they required an inordinate amount of work.  For example you can create very high hitpoint breastplates very close to the level of the ones found in the plane of time.<p>These changes will remove that ability but preserve the ability of players to add these augmentations to their other, non lost dungeon items since they will change to the type 7 slot.</font>
