<h1 class="article_title">The Rise of Ro and the Fall of Stormhammer</h1>
<p>by Loral on March 06, 2006</p>

<p>Once again we find ourselves with a new unknown corner of the world to explore.  While many originally labeled Prophecy of Ro the "Ykesha" expansion, anyone to reasonably do so now clearly doesn't see what it contains.  Besides increased bank space, the expansion is no comparison to the mid-level mini-expansion, Legacy of Ykesha.</p>

<p>Prophecy of Ro contains a wide range of raid targets, many of them in open zones.  SOme claim that these high-end targets, like the three dragons of Relic, drop gear far more powerful than they should.  Veteran raiders of Demiplane of Blood were quick to jump on this topic, claiming that the high-end rewards from open-zone mobs removed any reason for them to hunt in Demiplane of Blood.</p>

<p>Back about the time the single-group gear in Depths of Darkhollow received an upgrade, the raiders began to bring forward similar complaints about the raiding gear in Demiplane of Blood.  Initially SOE responded to the complaints about high-end raid targets leading to the Demiplane by saying that flagging mobs generally don't have the gear to which a raiding guild would upgrade.  The real upgraded gear was in the Demiplane of Blood itself.</p>

<p>This wasn't the case.  The raid gear they received in Demiplane of Blood was an upgrade to previous Omens and Dragons high-end raid gear but not powerful enough to motivate raiders to use their votes, DKP points, or other loot distribution credit to purchase this equipment.</p>

<p>Likely the cause for this feeling came from the fact that few items were tuned to specific classes.  Unlike the class armor in Anguish, the armor dropping in Depths was tuned for a wide range of classes.  It would not likely have the same dedicated power for any one class that a class-specific piece contains.</p>

<p>Now, high-end raiders complain that the gear dropping in open zones is too close to this gear they didn't like already.  They don't like the gear they receive in Demiplane but they don't want others to have anything close.</p>

<p>That is obviously a biased and simplistic view of the problem, but there are important points to consider.  This gear is not as good as Demiplane gear.  This gear drops on non-instanced raid targets.  Few guilds below Anguish level will have the ability to defeat these mobs and receive these items.  While a guild can have a dedicated shot at clearing their own versions of Tacvi, Anguish, the Dragons of Norrath, and Demiplane of Blood without any worry that someone else will take these areas, other guilds will compete for the static mobs in Arcstone, Relic, Devastation, and Stronghold of Rage.  Guilds will not be able to gear up on these mobs as effectivly as instanced raid zones.  Also, once guilds begin to enter Deathknell, they will receive even higher-end rewards in a dedicated instanced zone.  As always, the paths to glory shift in new directions.</p>

<p>SOE recently scheduled a town hall to discuss how best to change the Test server.  Likely they do not wish to alienate the community that now resides on the test server but also want to change the test server into a server that is actually able to test new content.  The test server, like any of the specialized servers, goes through the process of losing so many players that it becomes nearly deserted but those who do stay fight tooth and nail to maintain their community as much as they can.</p>

<p>The town hall is now scheduled for 5pm PST on 8 March 2006.</p>

<p>The changing communities on specialized servers is not a new topic in recent days.  A while back I said that I would discuss the closing of Stormhammer and some posters have requested it.  While it is now somewhat old news, it still is an important topic for the future of other specialized servers.</p>

<p>At the September 2005 Everquest summit, the attendees had a chance to walk through the SOE operations center.  On one board they had all of the existing players on each of the servers.  Most of the numbers were close to the others except for three: Zek, Firiona Vie, and Stormhammer.  While Zek and Firiona Vie had roughly half the number of players of other main servers at that specific slice of time, Stormhammer had under 10%.</p>

<p>At the Summer 2005 Las Vegas Fan Faire I had lunch with some community representatives who played on Stormhammer and talked about the situation.  For them, nearly four months after the release of Dragons of Norrath, the Nest had yet to be opened.  While GMs worked with players to schedule server-wide raiding events, the power could not be mustered to defeat high-end raid targets.  Grouping was very hard at the high-end and grouping at lower levels was all but impossible.</p>

<p>While the community members I talked with had some ideas to re-invigorate the server's numbers, it was clear to me that there would be little SOE could reasonably do to increase the server's population.  There was only one clear answer.  Close the server.</p>

<p>On the first of February 2006, SOE closed Stormhammer.  Characters were allowed to move to any server of their choice except, perhaps, Firiona Vie.</p>

<p>One of the louder complaints came from those who used Stormhammer as a way to farm characters from one server to another.  When the announcement went live in mid January, all transfers back to Stormhammer were shut down.  Some players had characters on other live servers they intended to move to Stormhammer and then to another server.  Now, doing so costs $75.</p>

<p>I never expected Stormhammer's costs to allow players to use Stormhammer as a stable of characters to move wherever they wished whenever they wished.  While I never like to see any community crumble, I have a hard time sympathizing with those who didn't get a chance to shuffle characters around one last time.  That isn't a community problem.</p>

<p>The closing of Stormhammer was sad for many involved, but it was clear it had to happen.  Stormhammer ran for months with far fewer players than any other server.  Because of its specialized nature and higher price tag, any sort of server merger was out of the question, although Stormhammer players voted not to have Stormhammer turned into a normal server and merged with another.</p>

<p>Like Test and Stormhammer, all specialized servers will one day face this same choice.  Firiona Vie and Zek cannot hold their numbers forever and because of their specialized rules, they cannot simply be merged with other existing servers.  I expect we will hear more about these servers within a year.</p>

<p>Last week Ryan Barker, Rytan the Spell Tzar of Everquest, <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&message.id=194433">announced he was moving</a> to a secret project (likely SOE's competition to <a href="http://www.sanriotown.com/onlinegame/index.php?s=introduction">Hello Kitty Online World</a>).  I met Rytan at the first Everquest summit and again at many of the fan faires.  One thing was made very clear to every player who ever approached him to complain about a spell: Ryan knew his subject.  Never have I seen someone able to so clearly describe the relationships and details of so complicated a system.  While often the target of recklass hate, Ryan always faced his critics with even temperment and dry British-style humor.  He will be missed.</p>

<p>At great personal risk to himself, my friend Nanyea from Caster's Realm posted the <a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=10354">checklist for access to Theater of Blood</a>.  The checklist outlines the seven to eight missions one must undertake to gain access to the newest Plane of Fear style high-end hunting and reward zone.  The items from this zone have also begin to filter out through Lucy and Caster's Realms's new monster database.</p>

<p>Last week I had the great privilege of <a href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/news_article.vm?id=50096">being in the EQ Players community spotlight</a>.  This gave me the chance to talk about why I enjoy this game as much as I do and even gave me a bit of room to stretch out my own evil agenda a little bit more. I give thanks to Kytherea for the opportunity.</p>

<p>Having only one week in Prophecy of Ro, it is too early to give a full review of the expansion.  I will likely write a full review once we have a wider view of how this expansion changes Everquest.</p>

<p>hey loral. sounds like they had to shut down a server not being used. on the subject of that new expansion all my buddies that still play eq claim its not doing well at all.a guy i know that works at one of those video game chain stores says that the pre-release sells and release sells were not good. is that true ....not sure if you have any inside info on that.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Naladini on March  6, 2006 01:49 AM</strong></p>
<p>While there were people who "farmed" characters around from various servers, the character transfer issue hit a lot of "regular" people for other reasons as well, I wouldn't dismiss the concern as quickly as you did in that article.</p>

<p>Notably, since Stormhammer was closing, players had a choice of what server they wanted to move to, and many opted to move with their friends as opposed to returning to their original server. Back on their original server, they might have had alts of varying levels, who were essentially cut off from this new option. People had also wound up moving their lower levels back to other servers over the years, mainly because the low level population on SH was much much lower than what you'd ever expect to see on an EverQuest server. </p>

<p>The premise behind Legends was a great one: an environment where events and live interaction with chracter-actors would dominate gameplay. This is much more entertaining than standard scripted raid events or grinding dungeon missions tied to point systems, yet the delivery is much more difficult as well. The GM's at SOE are a talented and creative group of people who really did make the Legends experience worthwhile. </p>

<p>I'm hoping that a premium service will still be considered for future projects. If the launch of such a service can be coordinated in a way so as to not alienate most of the players (as legends did with removing events and server gm's from the regular servers), it will stand a much better chance of succeeding.</p>

<p>The challenge, as always, will be in providing maintenance and new features as the game evolves. Not building the service, then leaving the majority of issues to CS to try and resolve on their own. Maintaining a strong connection between development and CS would be an important key in the potential success of these projects. </p>

<p>The other challenge, common in MMO's, is managing the community in a way that changes to the premium service are accepted by the community rather than bitterly, bitterly, resented. I'm not sure if this challenge is beatable though, as we've all seen the reactions from MMO players over the years to various forms of change. People tend to get upset if they have any issues outstanding and an issue unrelated to their own gets addressed first. (see any casual vs. hardcore, grouping vs. raiding discussion for examples of this in action.) </p>

<p>Why do you justify Zajeer concerning demi-plane, Loral?</p>

<p>POP managed to give multiclass gear that was great.</p>

<p>It has been done and it is possible. If someone doesn't want to or can't for some reason, that's an entirely other issue.</p>

<p>"Now, high-end raiders complain that the gear dropping in open zones is too close to this gear they didn't like already. They don't like the gear they receive in Demiplane but they don't want others to have anything close."</p>

<p>This is a complete misunderstand of the issue.  What the DPoB raiders are saying(and I agree with them), is that the risk vs reward is way out of whack for many PoR raids.  It's not that they don't want them(in fact, some are so good that even raiders in DPoB are going to want them), its that gear that is substantially better than Anguish gear, that 30 Anguish raiders can farm from an instince zone every 3 days, that does not require the guild to flag for anything.  This is broken.  Understand that again, 30 Anguish geared raiders(actually, a number of apps included too, so not all even anguish geared), with little effort, and trivial difficulty, can obtain 340 hp nice gear, and can do that every 3 days, without competition.  Relic dragons are a seperate, but similar problem, as are a few other encounters.  Your comments on this, bith as quoted above and not quoted, suggest that you are not entirely understanding the issue.  Also understand that as a non DPoB raider(yet, soon tho I hope), I have to agree, the loot is too good for the ease of access and the difficulty of the encounter.</p>

<p>only one I can think of off hand would be the corruption of ro instance. but even that is not as easy as it sounds. it requires a key and a raid force of 54.</p>

<p>from what I have been reading most of these encounters will be getting a difficulty retune in the coming patch on the 14th, this will make them more difficult.</p>

<p>To be honest, it's about time Stormhammer closed down -- I'm sorry you lost your community but from my perspective premium servers are a mistake. Yes, I understand the counter-arugments, I've heard them all. It won't change the basic fact that you're paying for freebies, regardless of how neglected Stormhammer became, there's still plenty of you running around with lolipops, titles, player named items, and illusions (such as the troll one I've seen) without actually having earned any of them. You earned it in the context of your community, which is fine if you stayed there like Firona Vie - the problem is you've had the option to bring back these items to a normal server. </p>

<p>I hope the trend of premium services is gone once and for all after this mess. I hated the idea when it was introduced, and I hated it to this day. Once again, I'm sorry you guys lost your home, but that's just how it goes.</p>

<p>As for Prophecy of Ro - While it's a step forward from the days of Velious/Luclin/Pop, it's a step back as well. This expansion demonstrates to me that the Everquest community is simply aging -- the biggest group of players cannot keep up with this absurd rate these expansions are released, nor contend with the poorly introduced ideas behind advancement. As a raider, irritated but content with this expansion due -- the irritation stems from mudflation, the contention from a healthy dose of new raid content. However, as someone who also groups frequently out of my guild, this expansion is already a disaster. People are still jammed up on their spell missions from DoDH with no resolusion in sight. Assuming they ever complete them, it'll be a repeat here 6 months down the road when a new expansion is released.</p>

<p>The 'features' of this expansion are insulting with the exception of auras. Quite weak. All around, I'm not impressed and will not pre-order any expansions for Everquest again. I'll wait a few weeks as to avoid going through the bugs I have with this one (hi Saga Skins quest.)</p>

<p>On a final note, over all this expansion just isn't FUN (That's right Absor, especially your creations.) SoE needs to start asking once more "Is this fun?" when designing their missions/raids/zones instead of hiding behind the veil of a vision. This expansion is a step back.</p>

<p>Happy hunting.</p>

<p>It does require a person to have done a fairly easy group of single group tasks, but only one person needs to have it done to get the raid, and it certainly does not require 54, as we have done it, Anguish geared, with 30.  Could probably do it with 24 with the right mix of classes.</p>

<p>Face it, anyone playing EQ especially a raider has to buy every expansion. Saying you're going to wait three weeks isn't facing facts.  You'll get it asap because your guild is there and if you don't get in the zones in the first week or two you'll miss out on all that "accidental" uber loot and insane exp that's far too easy to come by until they fix the content.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Aethn on March  6, 2006 08:47 PM</strong></p>
<p>>>> For them, nearly four months after the release of Dragons of Norrath, the Nest had yet to be opened. While GMs worked with players to schedule server-wide raiding events, the power could not be mustered to defeat high-end raid targets. Grouping was very hard at the high-end and grouping at lower levels was all but impossible. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>

<p>This is pretty much a mirror image on Test Server right now.  i would wager we have even less then Stormhammer's 10% population.  Maybe 3-5% if lucky.  A look at EQPlayers.com shows Test only has about 300 active lvl 70 chars, many of them alts and bots, so more likely only 100-150 actual lvl 70 players.  Level 65-70 is under 500, again half being bots / alts of one person.</p>

<p>As for the Nest example, it was so dire on Test, the DEV team just ended up killing the script manually to open the Nest there, although the content has yet to even be used once.</p>

<p>Right now Test Server is in a severe state.  We cant progress due to lack of numbers, and we cant Test current targets due to numbers and NO flags or keys to access zones.</p>

<p>I know aqlot of you guys will chime in and say "Tough titty, you chose to play there so if you dont like it start over on a Live Server".  One big problem, this isnt like other MMO's or diablo or something.  Many of the last few players who have not quit over frustration have been building these characters for 7 years now.  7 years of EXP, AA's and Gear that cant be replaced on live servers unless they commit hundreds even thousands of hours of playtime to rebuild.</p>

<p>It would be like me asking you guys to abandon your level 70 + 1250 AA character and start over on Test Server, you just wont do it.</p>

<p>They need to either find some huge incentive to boost population fulltime by 500% or more, or just let us MOVE off Test to a live server and wipe the server and redo it in a /betabuff format for Testing at the moment patches like most other companies do.</p>

<p>I mean, moving us off would be best, we dont lose our hard work, and we get to keep ouor chars we have indentified ourselves with for over half a decade now.  Besides, the best geared players on Test Server right now, are just barely better then Live Server players were 3 years ago.  No joke, im serious, so its not likeyour moving super toons to lives with 1500 AA's.  Average Test player has less then 400 AA's at best.</p>

<p>Move us, wipe the server, start on a clean slate with a real format that will prmot Testing of proper content levels, ie Current zones.</p>

<p>Oh please. You knew you were on a Test server when you created your characters and you knew they would never be moved to a Live Server. Deal with the consequences of your decision.  Frankly, I don't know why anyone would volunteer to debug pre-release coding free of charge.  All you do is put hard working programmers/testers out of work.<br />

<p>I would not be opposed to allowing test server moves, ONLY if all plat is wiped and a thorough audit of items/inventory is done to each toon.</p>

<p>Given the low population, it should not be a huge issue to individually inspect each toon.</p>

<p>Limiting moves to level 70 toons also might be a good idea.<br />

<p>This has to be the funniest quote ever in the history of MMO's.  You obviously dont have a grasp on how Test Servers work for MMO's.  ROFL, putting people out of work because I play on Test Server, thats rich.  I think I would direct my anger towards outsourced QA and CS jobs to India and Pakistan before you make such an assinine comment again.<br />

<p>This wont be an issue, there has never been an economy on Test Server.  No one has money worth a mention.  After 7 years, I think the most anyone on that server MIGHT have is 300,000 pp.  I bet if you pooled all the money for every lvl 60-70 active on Test into one pile, it would be less cash then is a Current lives Server has on charcters standing on POK at any given time.</p>

<p>As for moving only lvl 70's.  That would be a gross unfair deal.  There are lvl 50's that played on Test for 7 years also that are just as entitled to some benefit as any level 70 would.</p>

<p>You guys really need to understand here, Test has no one left.  I mean no matter that they do it will only affect about 500 active people, period.  Thats the population of a Bazaar and POK zone at any given time on a Live Server.  No matter what happens the impact would be unnoticable to live server.</p>

<p>I would tend to think there would be alot more then 300k plat. Test has seen some exploits that never made it to live servers plat wise. and people on test have been saveing up their plat for years because there is nothing in the bazaar to spend it on most of the time as you said.</p>

<p>but they would need to pretty much remake every character to port them to live if they wanted to. because of how the test characters are made since they include debug data.</p>

<p>but as I said before they need to stop treating test like a production server to get the most use out of it.</p>

<p>Horzak, do you realize that one of the biggest, if not the single main reason Everquest is having the worst patches in the history of this game is directly due to a improper Testing platform (ie test Server).  Do you enjoy having a patch, then having the game broken so badly it requires 2-3 more patches over teh next day or two to fix.  Or having 10 and 15 hour patches since the first patch was bad?  Or maybe you enjoyed seeing thousands of payes rolled back in january due to a horrible patch?</p>

<p>This is 110% related toteh fact that Test Server can not test this game.  Its 3-4 years behind teh current content in terms of raiding and flags/keys.  Even if we had the bodies to man the raids, we still dont have access to over 50% of the endgame.</p>

<p>No Texvu, no Tacvi, no Tier 4 DON, no Tier 5 DON, no vish, no MPG raid 3, 4, 5 or 6, no Anguish, no Demiplane, no Dreadspire, no nothing beyond Qvic from nearly 3 years ago.  This means no one single encounter beyond Qvic and MPG 1 or 2 has EVER BEEN TESTED on a legitamte basis on he Test Server.</p>

<p>Why do you think SOe's 6 month patch record has been a black eye to teh companies image?  why do you think Penny Arcade started this huge feud with Smedley over untested and imcomplete content being released.</p>

<p>Its clear and in simple black and white ... nothing considered endgame or progression has been properly Tested on the Test Server in the past 36+ months, nothing.</p>

<p>I dont know what your issue is, maybe you just like burying your ignorant head in the sand and ignoring the real issue here.  But I am pretty sure the lions share of the EQ Liver Server community does not share your narrow focus.  I am failry positive they would like a proper Test Server no matter what it takes so they dont need to endure something like the January rollback ever again.</p>

<p>No amount of Kripsy Kreme donuts will help SOE's image if they keep producing bad patches time and time again.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Redhenna on March  8, 2006 05:47 AM</strong></p>
<p>Aethn makes a good point.  If test server does not work, then something needs to happen to fix it, and currently, Test server is not working.  What Test needs, at least to my thinking, is more people.  If that is what Test needs, SoE's chore is to find ways to draw people to Test, to encourage people to play there.  It's in all of our best interest.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: siferion on March  8, 2006 06:10 AM</strong></p>
<p>I think one thing that'd really help the test server is to fix that testbuff command. It sets you up for lvl25 last i checked. That's nowhere near the target audience for mainstream content nowadays. Perhaps setting the testbuff stuff to lvl70 with major aa's and don merchant level gear would help alot. At least then new players on test would have what's needed to start right into the game and not spend a few months to a year getting to the small end-game of test.</p>

<p>Or at least implement a feature for new content testing that equips/buffs/aa/lvl the character for the intended audience of the zone. Could work using the shroud system fairly well.</p>

<p><strong>Comment Posted by: FVPLayer on March  8, 2006 10:48 AM</strong></p>
<p>One thing I don't see mentioned regarding the population of Firiona Vie is that there is a 1 character per account limit.  If the numbers SOE was touting for the other bluebie servers was the total number of characters and not the total number of actual accounts, I'd say FV is in pretty good shape in comparison.  I know my 2 Xegony accounts had 12 characters spread among 2 accounts... and even if everyone has 2 toons per account (which is probably pretty low) that still means FV has the same number of accounts as any normal server, if not a lot more.</p>

<p>Allow moves to test and give people a subscription discount if their account is active on test. <br />

<p>"Or maybe you enjoyed seeing thousands of payes rolled back in january due to a horrible patch?"</p>

<p>This incident had nothing to do with poor testing. It was due to corrupted data that no amount of testing could have discovered.</p>

<p>"No Texvu, no Tacvi, no Tier 4 DON, no Tier 5 DON, no vish, no MPG raid 3, 4, 5 or 6, no Anguish, no Demiplane, no Dreadspire, no nothing beyond Qvic from nearly 3 years ago. This means no one single encounter beyond Qvic and MPG 1 or 2 has EVER BEEN TESTED on a legitamte basis on he Test Server."</p>

<p>This is true, but to be fair, Test server isn't meant to test these things, that's what the beta server is for.</p>

<p>This is analagous to saying any changes made to automobiles shouldn't be tested at testing centers, but should instead be brought back to the development center.</p>

<p>The fact your perception is that way proves how flawed the current *TEST* center methodology is. What do you think the point of the server is?</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Maitreya on March  8, 2006 06:26 PM</strong></p>
<p>For testing non-expansion specific patches, obviously. All of the items the person I quoted mentioned were raids from specific expansions which were all tested during beta. Test server is for things like tweaks to spells or features changes, such as the new wizard manaburn or the shared bank. Those were not tied to an expansion, so were tested on Test, not Beta.</p>

<p>Some ideas to encourage people playing on Test Server:</p>

<p>1) Free subscription if you play ONLY on the Test server (ie: do not create or play toons on any Live servers)</p>

<p>2) $1 /month discount on subscription fee for every X# of hours (up to a maximum of 5X) you actively play on Test server in addition to whatever Live server you are on, where "actively play" is defined in some verifiable manner and is not merely logged in and sitting afk in PoK.  So say X = 24 hours (not necessarily consecutive), and someone plays a total of 120 hours in one month (5X), then they could get $5 off that month's (or actually, next month's) subscription fee</p>

<p>3) free eqplayers service (again dependant on a minimum # of actively played hours on the Test server)</p>

<p>4) additional betabuff command for generating level 50 characters...?</p>

<p>5) being able to copy over your toons from Live and earning "beta tokens" on Test server that can translate to rewards on your Live toon....sufficiently tuned so things dont get overpowering</p>

<p>6) all Veteran rewards available on Test toons regardless of subscription time.</p>

<p>etc</p>

<p>pick on or more of the above, mix well, and see if it helps boost Test server population....</p>

<p>the changes I would like to see come to test would be</p>

<p>1) better patch notes for test, so people know what to test.</p>

<p>2) Testing days.. these would be days that developers tell the community to test certain content and focus on it, there could be a added benifit or reward for testing this content in the form of a claim item. (1 double experience potion or 1 random illusion potion or something else that is expendable)</p>

<p>3) new forums opened specifically for people on test. you would have to have a player on test to comment in these forums</p>

<p>4) a better roadmap to the future, so players on test can comment on where the game is going. and give suggestions that might help the developers improve things. (Druid stances have been in the books since early last year. yet to be implemented)</p>

<p>5) better access to spells perhaps there could be a test only vendor that sells spells for Test tokens.. these would drop off mobs of equivilant level to the spell your going for 60+ and cost a set amount.</p>

<p>6) (Better)/limited access to locked zones that have changes (like veeshans peak) perhaps for the weekend that its first opened they could unlock the zone for all of test and encourage people to go in and test it. then lock it back up after the weekend is over.</p>

<p>I of course have more I could think of. but this i s what I thought of at the moment.</p>

It sounds like the best way to handle this is to move players off of test and give players some incentive to copy their play character over to Test and actually test stuff.<br />
--------------------<br />
That's how any other company is handling testing.<br />
SOE should /movelog all those poeple, who played their chars up on test to a server of their own decision.<br />
And start a new Test, similar to Beta, where people who want to test get copied to.</p>

<p>The way it is now, Test is just another production server with it's own ruleset (like FV or Zek).<br />

It has a lot to do with SOE not doing what they're paid for. It shows severe failures in Change Management and Quality Assurance!<br />
It was not "corrupted data" - it was sloppy execution.</p>

<p>There are too many people who get money for nothing(c), especially in management!<br />

<p>Loral,</p>

<p>While admittedly I've personally given up any hope of seeing SOE's bad habits change.  Rather I expect that much like entropy they are here to stay and we'll only see them become worse.  Not that I'll quit playing.  EQ to me is much like a comfy pair of old house slippers, I play it because, well, I've been playing it for so long.</p>

<p>Anyway, you seem to have some connections with SOE, and you appear to go to the fan faires a lot.  And it may be that that SOE even listens to you.  Personally, based on the way you review thier new expansions each time with rave applause I have this nagging voice that tells me they pay you for your time.  But that aside.</p>

<p>Where was I?  Oh, you seem to have some enthusiasm for the game still.  i.e. you seem to rightly or wrongly beleive that things can and will get better.</p>

<p>So... Why not suggest the following;</p>

<p>1) Do a clean wipe of Test.<br />
2) Assign a specific forum or forums that only Test account players can access.<br />
3) Assign a specific forum mod to the Test forums.<br />
4) Create a web based tool that allows people to copy one "live" character from a live server to the Test server.  Re-use of the tool will over write your "Test" copy.<br />
5) Have Test log the amount of exp gained on Test<br />
6) Have an NPC on the Live servers that allow you to cash in your Test exp for DoN crystals, LDoN points, or even Tomes/spells/runes.</p>

<p>Problem solved.</p>

<p>You will have a reason for people to go in and test.<br />
You will have characters in Test that reflect the characters on the live server(s).<br />
You will remove the issue(s) of the Test player base being non-compatible with the normal servers.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Simkine on March 10, 2006 01:29 PM</strong></p>
<p>It comes down to what role Test is suppose to fill.  As someone said, right it's just another prod server.</p>

<p>Depending on SOE's changement management process (laugh), Test might be better used as the first "guinea pig" prod server before patches move to the main servers.</p>

<p>In the release management cycle for code changes, once they are approved out of dev, they need to go to some sort of QA system. I don't think this should be the public Test server. This stuff can be validated internally using tools better at analyzing code than player avatars can.</p>

<p>So, once they are QA approved and pretty much ready for prime-time, they should be moved to Test where they can get actual play simulations and see the affects (provided the population is large enough).  After a certain amount of time, and any "patches that fix the patch" roll up, SOE should have a much less disruptive patch pushed to the live servers.</p>

<p>In the case of new expansions, Test might be able to host these provided regular patches are not going on that conflict because once the Test server gets the new expansion code, it will not be able to reflect patch changes aimed at the live servers.</p>

<p>The reward for being on Test is access to all new expansions - very lucrative if you ask me and they would probably end up having to limit the number of people wanting to go there.  The downside is that you get more outages.<br />

SOE doesn't get it!<br />
The current "Test-Server" is nothing more than a very low population server with it's own ruleset. There's a community that objects any changes to their paradise, i.e. copying chars from other servers to do actual testing.<br />
SOE will never get any new people to this server, nobody will never level a char up from 1 to 70 with dozens of keys and flags and try to get all those raid drops again.</p>

<p>SOE has only one option if they want actual testing:<br />
1) Rename Test to an other name (it is a production server)<br />
2) Start a new Test where chars are copyed to - so there will be real testing going on.<br />
Anything other is a failure.</p>

<p>Or to say the truth: SOE doesn't care about the game and the customers - as long as those pay...<br />

<p>For ages test has been nothing but a bunch of head up the a** elitest loosers. They feel anyone that is not part of their community from the beginning of time is not worth spit.</p>

<p>The entire server should be wiped and let people betabuf toons to what level they want to test what ever part they want but they need monthly wipes at the least.</p>

<p>If you remember test from ages ago, you were always warned that you could have your toon wiped at any time. Hell I have toons on there that have been at level 25 for 4 years with no wipe.</p>

<p>The server needs to be for TESTING not for PLAYING. Of course when you are several years behind the times in content then it makes testing a bit difficult, know what I mean.</p>

---</p>

<p>Copying is largly disliked because people think it will drive others off the server.. the people who do no testing to begin with.</p>

<p>OMG.. ted who did not /bug anything in the past year is leaving test server.. thats a crime!</p>

<p>in the end it will be the loudest voice that wins as usual. and thats the people on test who are set in their ways and dont want test to become a test server. I think in the end it would be better off of sony to fold test into the production servers perhaps as a special rule set server (no transfers allowed). and create a new test server where they can finally get down to testing.<br />

<p>I have played since velious was coming out. I loved it, and have watched alot of changes. Not as many changes as those who started when EQ did, but still alot has changed in 5 years. It has been made easier in alot of ways, and after speding 30 bucks a pop for every expansion, you can get 10 expansions now for 30 bucks and get started, no corpse runs til after 10 levels etc.<br />
I have helped teach others to play in groups and basic raid techniques, and have been in guilds that raided or didn't raid depending on the ways of the people in them. I have not had access to uber guilds, and my highest is 62. I have charcters on a number of servers. I like them all so I never really worked one character up to high end, I spent too much time spreading it around. I now have all the expansions as I have said, and as an average player in EQ who spends alot of hours in this world, I still hadn't done alot past velioous, and there is still things in velious to see. Luclin was a lag nightmare, but over time I have upgraded my equipment and now it doesnt have the draw it did when it came out so it is only a fast exp zone to go to on your way up. I have done little in PoP, have not done all areas in LDoN, havent done any in DoN and just keep adding to my expansions cause they are out and am hoping to one day be able to get into it more. I like tradeskills and that has changed over the years, and it always seems I am behind o I havent made any real money with that except to farm and make leather padding LOL. I have already moved one account from Terris Thule to Druzzil after the server merge. Was sad to play after most of my friends left for EQ2 and WoW and CoH etc a couple years ago, so I started a charachter on FV and when offered a free move I went to Druzzil with the main account and made new friends. Now again I am in a guild that is growing in hopes of raiding and hasnt gotten far along. I have helped folks grow in levels to watch them pass by and move on to other guilds or wherever to help themselves, when the thought of helping folks along was to also help the guil;d grow. people get impatient and move on intead of sticking it out and making a more powerful guild to go and do things most times. So whatever is happening with drops in new expansions is still beyond me in alot of ways. I am lost in freeport now as well LOL, but it is going to be interesting learning my way around again. I miss learning,like I did,way back when Lake of Ill Omen was over crowded. Having a 40 minute corpse run from Halas cause I forgot to rebind and had to run continents and take boats, and learned how important binding close to a hunting area was. now people are anywhere in miutes mostly and hunting, this is nice, but I feel something missing in it. Heck I just miss being able to take a boat ride :( I have not tried other games, and have stuck it out cause I love this game. I just wish they werent making it for just the uber folks to get more and do more and helped us average folks have time to learn what is what in places before the next expansion makes the last one vacant.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: sdfsdf on March 15, 2006 12:17 PM</strong></p>
<p>While I did/do not like the enforced wait of the boats, I did/do enjoy the peace and quiet beauty (with the minor element of danger) of the boat ride itself. /nod<br />

<p>Questions:</p>

<p>What happened to Vet awards?</p>

<p>Is the reward for the scavenger hunt really some DUMB sparkler?</p>

<p>Is it insane to announce a double exp bonus and then move it a day later?</p>

<p>I'm confused</p>

<p>as far as I know they are still going over what the new veteran reward should be. I would expect to hear something by next month at latest.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Glormane on March 23, 2006 10:47 AM</strong></p>
<p>I read over some of the log from the meeting of SoE with the Test Server community. Sadly my opinions of the questions and concerns were not those testing the content in any different a manner as to those on a conventional server. <br />
It is my opinion that Sony if it wants to test all aspects of EQ content then they will need to ‘reimburse’ the testers. This could be done in the following ways;<br />
1.	Employer professional testers to form a guild on a special server and be employed to test all aspects of content, some solo play, some raid encounters, with differing levels of characters. Reports would need to be made on each ‘assignment’ given. Each tester would be employees of Sony, and would I think need to number at least 80.</p>

<p>2.	Employ a smaller number of testers to join the existing test server and form guilds with the existing test server population and gear and organise them so that they can raid new content.</p>

<p>3.	Start a new server offering free membership to people participating, if they complete a ‘task’ say once a week. The task could be as simple as soloing  mobs in a specific zone. They would however be transported to a new character with the attibutes and level that SoE wishes to test. A player can choose more complex tasks maybe, a group scenario, with other players logging in, the incentives offered by SoE could be to award the player with a beneficial item on their main character. A 10 charge no fail invisibity potion would be nice for some. A DA potion may come in handy for others, you get the idea. This idea can be extended to raids as well, with the person joining a raid with other players, again the reward should be such that it gives a greater incentive to the player to take part.</p>

<p>Whichever way you cut it the population on the test server are not professional testers, they aren’t even testers for a hobby, they are just another set of players, who plays infrequently (or at least infrequently in large enough numbers to progress through the game) and maybe enjoys the quietness of the server or the special rules enjoyed there.<br />
