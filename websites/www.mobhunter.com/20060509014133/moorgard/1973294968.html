Stuff</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-01-29</p><BIG>It Was Fixed--Fixed, I Tell You!</BIG><p>A nice Verant fellow by the name of Steve Burke--EverQuest's lead content designer--passed on the following <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000474.html">response</a> to the claims that the Ring of Fire had been <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=1958081702">nerfed</a> in the last patch:<p><B>After the fourth boss the mobs that spawned were level 2, this was a result of a bug, and fixing it brought the mobs up to the appropriate level. There is a chance that a healer will spawn, but there are none that can cast AE heals.</B><p>Mr. Burke is correct. It always seemed odd that the skeletons that spawned after the fourth boss conned green. At the risk of using an Abashi-ism, the Ring of Fire is now working as intended.<p><BIG>A Ragefire in Harlem</BIG><p>Absor tackled more <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000465.html">questions</a> on the recent Ragefire fixes... er, make that semi-fixes:<p><B>The second Zordak is indeed broken. We'll have him fixed as soon as we can.</B><p>There was a server-wide announcement last night that Skyfire was being brought down for a patch, so the spawn is hopefully fixed.<p>In trying to suggest a further change to the quest, one cleric brings up a very interesting notion:<p><B><I>perfect solution: make the container not lootable by anyone who does not have the pearl.</I><p>Perfect, except for the fact that it can't be done. There isn't a way to link looting to items in the inventory with the current game system. Nobody knows what the future holds, but right now we can't do things like this.</B><p>What's so interesting about this idea? Well, if you think about it, making the ability to loot of one item dependent upon the possession of another would be a great benefit to the quest system in general. What better way is there to ensure a player does a quest in the order intended? Of course, such a system would put a great onus on the creators to make sure the quest is working as intended (there's that cursed phrase again!). On the other hand, they wouldn't have to worry about so many variations in the quests or the way players do them, since there would only be one possible way to complete them.<p>Something to think about for future games, at the very least. Hey Brad, are you out there???<p><BIG>Well, Maybe 3.2 Is Okay</BIG><p>While <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000467.html">mentioning</a> that <B>/w all GUILD</B> works to get a list of your own guildmates, Absor answers a player's lament that the Odus Scion and the Velious Scion have to be roommates. The player complained that while waiting to travel to Odus, you can't go afk for a quick beer anymore because you might come back and find yourself wurm food in Great Divide:<p><B>No, we don't have any plans to rebuild the zone to accommodate another spire. Honestly, and as someone pointed out, you really shouldn't be getting a beer when you're about to get ported to the Great Divide... That's just not a wise idea.</B><p>From personal experience, I can also say that stripping naked and covering yourself in grape jelly while waiting for the Odus Scion is also a bad idea, as you find yourself both sticky and distracted. Verant, cut those portal times down, please!<p><BIG>Coffee Houses and Suicide</BIG><p>Alan also busted loose on the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000471.html">location</a> of the next FanFaire:<p><B>Well, the next Fan Faire is scheduled for Seattle. If you want to lobby for the location of the one after that you should head over to the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/eq-fanfaire/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi">Fan Faire message boards</a> and give a shout out to Cindy... Me, I want Vegas...</B><p>My chances of convincing Kohath and Csenicier to make the trek out to the home of grunge are almost nil. Everyone, please bug Cindy to have another midwestern FanFaire so that the Mobhunter staff can attend. Methinks Chicago would be a nice central location. Get to work, my minions!<p><BIG>Today on &quot;Caster Rant Live&quot;: Mages</BIG><p>For some reason I can't quite fathom, Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000476.html">addressed</a> some mage issues. Alan, don't you know by now that caster threads are nothing but an evil trap? Run! Run!<p>This thread is really long, and if you're a mage you've probably <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessage?topicID=3575.topic">discussed it</a> at length already. At the risk of destroying context, I'll just throw a few of Absor's more interesting quotes at you.<p>On Abashi's FanFaire comment that Call of the Hero was probably a bad idea:<p><B>Well, based on the fact that Magicians don't like it when we disable the use of the spell in a few zones, and the fact that allowing the spell to work in those zones invalidates the whole risk/reward concept in the zone, I can certainly understand how the existence of this spell could be seen as troublesome.<p>However, we are not prepared to allow this one spell to prevent us from implementing interesting content. As I've said before, we'd rather disable one spell in a few zones than never explore content that that spell would invalidate.</B><p>Then why was the spell introduced?<p><B>This was the desired use of this spell, to let members of your raid join late. Sadly, that isn't the only use for the spell.</B><p>Frenzied Burnout--it's not just for frogloks anymore!<p><B>Frenzied Burnout is bugged. The explosion isn't working properly. We're trying to fix that.</B><p>Why didn't melee balancing bring mage pets up to par?<p><B>We didn't really forget pets when we did the melee balancing. Pets have to be evaluated in conjunction with the caster and his spells. Evaluating pets will go hand in hand with the caster balancing that we're undertaking.</B><p>Absor, why are you so mean to poor mages? And why can't these delicate mages solo better at level 60?<p><B>Well, let me start by apologizing for sounding rough. It's just that I get frustrated when I get a bunch of commentary that is vague and angry. Obviously there are issues that folks want to talk about, but I can't address unspecific anger.<p>As for Mages and their solo ability, they are indeed one of the best solo classes. Up until 50 they can be considered among the top 3. After 50 perhaps they fall more toward the middle of the pack.<p>If you look at the life of the class, this places them pretty much third or fourth in over all solo ability, by my estimation. I know that it's tempting to only look at the end game, especially when you're playing it. But the life of the character is more than that. <p>And if I seem like I'm rattling your cages a bit, maybe I am.<p>I really need you folks to be more precise and less emotional when sending in comments. It makes it much easier for me to present your ideas to the team.</B><p>Precise? Less emotional? You're talking to EverQuest players, after all. Hoping for reason and logic is like asking the roosters at a cock fight to be more polite.<p>
