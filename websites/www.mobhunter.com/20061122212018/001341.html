<h1 class="article_title">The Focus and the Flip Flop</h1>
<p>by Loral on September 03, 2004</p>

<p>In case you live in Paw, the great Foci debate spread across every Everquest related forum on the entire web.  This <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=63311">official notice</a> declares that all foci will begin scaling at a rate of 10% per spell level after the level cap of the foci.  This means Spell Haste 4, a 15% reduction in casting time up to level 65, will drop to 13.5% at level 66, 11% at level 67, and so on until it reaches 7.5% at level 70.</p>

<p>This has most high-end raiders in a fury.  They spent months working through very difficult encounters in Gates of Discord where foci of 45% on some items will drop to 22.5% at level 70.  Some call this the worst nerf ever even though it's not a nerf but an enhancement.  SOE made a far better decision than letting the items cut off at 65 as they were advertised to do.</p>

<p>Originally, I agreed with the change.  First and foremost, it helps all spellcasting players below level 65 which is the most important subject of this change.  Most spend their time on this topic discussing 65+ gear, however.  I remember the dark days where Focus 3 items stopped working at all.  I expected my 65 gear would stop in much the same way.  This was a good change in my mind.  Others, however, felt sure that their high-end items would last forever (note: no item ever lasts forever.  One should always want to upgrade eventually.) and became quite horribly vexed when they learned they would eventually desire to upgrade.</p>

<p>The summit forums, where yours truly gets all manner of uberfruit tossed at him on a daily basis, was no exception to this.  In one of our dozens of heated messages I was called an uber / casual "flip flopper".  We will get back to this in a moment.  I spent much time considering this Foci situation.</p>

<p>What becomes clearer to me the more I test Omens and the more I think about Gates is that the two expansions seem to have come out in the wrong order.</p>

<p>Imagine if Omens came out four months ago with open zones, elemental level raid content, a lot of single-group content with equipment progression above LDON / Ornate, and most importantly level 70.  Those who finished Time and LDON raids head into the more difficult Omens content (more difficult because they have no Gates gear) while they level up to 70 and acquire that content.</p>

<p>Then Gates comes along.  The content is a lot harder.  Much more of the expansion is locked but even single-groupers have an easier time with the sewers and mountain trials.  Single group people are able to defeat the Ikkinz trials without raid gear.  The people who made it through Omens now hit that super-hard content (scaled for level 70 Omens gear) at Qvic and above and earn that super high quality loot.</p>

<p>Things seem a lot smoother in that obviously simplified theory.  There is a larger bridge between the single group hunters of LDON and the Planes to the single-group content in Gates.  The raiding guilds have smoother progression to the high-end raid content and the rewards for that gear fits their level better.</p>

<p>If you can't tell, I began to cave.  Perhaps being called a "flip flopper" finally did it.  I must have laughed for hours about the use of such a politically motivated word in a discussion about Massive Online Gaming.  I am a great fan of the use, reuse, and misuse of words as society changes.  George Orwell's 1946 essay <a href="http://mikeshea.net/orwell">Politics and the English Language</a> shows how the word "Fascist" got so misused that it became all but meaningless back in the 40s.  Geoff Nunberg's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1586482343/qid=1093987266/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-0239897-5576631?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Going Nucular (sic)</a> talks about how the connotation of words like Plastic and Caucasian get horribly misused as our perceptions and politics change.  It wasn't until I was called a flip flopper that I really understood what they meant.  But I digress...</p>

<p>Very few people have high end Gates of Discord armor (don't scream yet, read on).  In a year or two, the flip flop of Gates and Omens (see, I used it again!) won't matter.  People will travel through the content in the most reasonable way, probably Omens to Gates.  For them, it makes little sense to have high-end Gates items, items that will be more difficult for them to acquire even at level 70 not work on spells up to level 70.</p>

<p>While I will not use my vast powers of the active voice ("Increase high-end Gates gear foci limits from 65 to 70"), I will say that it makes sense that high-end Gates gear scales to level 70.  More importantly, it will make more sense in a year when new players won't remember whether or not Gates came out before Omens.  In a year, with focus gear scaling to 70, Gates will be the clear line of equipment progression for raiders.  Without gear scaling to 70, the high-end Gates zones will see little use.</p>

<p>However, there is another side to this, a side that is not apparent yet to those who scream about their gear becoming "worthless".  If your foci gear scales to level 70, you will most likely not see equipment progression in Omens since your gear was really meant (in my own theory above) to be acquired after Omens.  You will spend your days tearing through raid content in Omens and in a month you will hit the high-end of Omens and realize there is nothing left.  Unlike everyone else, current high-end raiders will have already torn through Gates like a drag line in a strip mine and they will realize there is no more coal to mine.</p>

<p>Then they may quit and that is what SOE wishes to prevent.</p>

<p>Let me conclude this essay on semantics, politics, itemology, and marketing by saying that increasing the level limit to level 70 on high-end GoD items makes sense.  No other foci should get a free pass.  All other Foci from Time, the Elements, and any equipment in GoD with Time or Elemental effects should scale as the original plan intended.</p>

<p>My #1 one concern is whether I'll be able to play in OoW. Reports are making me optimistic about this.</p>

<p>My #2 concern is, after playing in OoW, will there be any point in playing anywhere else? Obviously level 70 is the big problem, but this solution to focus items is another nail in the coffin.</p>

<p>Unless 66-70 are way different from 60-65, going from 60 to 70 will take far less time than gearing up to any significant degree. So by the time people start thinking about trying to get to VT or Time, they'll already be level 70, and the focus items they can get there will be less effective than what they can get in OoW, probably relatively easily. So for casters a major part of the motivation for going VT or Time is gone.</p>

<p>Now I miss good old Seb. I've outgrown it, but other people still pass through the stage where Seb is a great place to play. But if SOE isn't careful, no one will ever want to use the raid content of Luclin and possibly even PoP. Up-and-coming guilds will skip it completely.</p>

<p>EQ's big claim to fame compared to other MMORPGs is its vast content. But all that content doesn't do any good if SOE makes it pointless to use it.</p>

<p>Teramar makes a good point. Many guilds made the leap to VT after 65 became the standard high level, and the items they got there were useful because SOE upped the level the focuses that dropped there affected spells. Making OOW with L70 as the new standard high level will invalidate a lot of old content that people who get L70 in OOW have probably never got to and would still like to. Especially Plane of Time. Many more guilds are going to be capable of making the jump to Time after they level up to 70 but if the gear there has focus effects on it that are essentially useless to them, why would they want to bother going? It seems short sighted to invalidate content that people might want to see for a large portion of said people. The melee in their guilds will still want to get time items for the effects they have but the casters aren't going to want much of it at all, other than ft items.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: <a href="mailto&#58;nope&#64;unhuh&#46;com">John Clark</a> on September  3, 2004 07:41 PM</strong></p>
<p>Why is it that a 45% focus that becomes a 22.5% is suddenly "useless".  Why would I skip Time to go to OOW, when the mobs in OOW are scaled for 70s as opposed to Time for 65s, and the focuses I get in OOW are only "slightly" better than the Time focuses after mitigation.</p>

<p>Does anyone actually know that OOW focuses are going to be 45%?  If they're smart, they'll make em 30%, so they're better than Time focuses after mitigation, but not much more so.  That gives them room for the next expansion.</p>

<p>People won't skip Time because of this (there's other reasons).  It'll still be part of the progression of guilds much like PoP still is, and even NToV (on CT, there's still 4-5 guilds on the NToV rotation).  Guilds will do things they're capable of, until they're capable of bigger things, that's what progression IS.  Time will be "easier" than OOW (hopefully), so people will gear up in it, then move on.  Will they skip Gates?  Possibly, but people skip other expansions too.  It's not the end of the world.  Heck, some people skip time to get to Gates now, since the focuses are the same or better and you can gear up from Elemental to get started in Gates.</p>

<p>Would have been so much better had SOE released the initial info that all focus IVs, etc. would stop working at 65, then caved in with the current system as "the compromise".  People just have to bitch.</p>

<p>Also, btw, it's vague in the way he says it, but these focus mitigations only affect spells of the higher levels, NOT all your spells once you hit that level.  Level 65 spells will still receive full effect of Focus IVs.  I know you mostly use your new spells at higher levels (if you can find them), but it was stated unclearly, and shouldn't have been.</p>

<p>The worst  thing about Velious is that it made Western Wastes and the Plane of Mischief so very had to get to.  The worst thing about Luclin is that it made The emperor and VT so very very hard to get to.  and The abominable thing about PoP is that it instituionalized that horrible error.  And the execrable thing about GoD is that it has continued the ridiculous practice.  Lower Guk and Chardok were NOT overloaded with level 20's or whatever wandering in in 1999 and 2000 and that was because they couldn't make it.  In much the same way that a large percentage of real life pioneers did not make it.</p>

<p>The idea we have been shown on "progression" is 95% of the content is for 5% of the players.  I do not believe this is due to maliciousness, but it is true.  Read some of the comments by irate teenagers saying "now that anyone can get to Plane of Time".  </p>

<p>Loral, I think your comments are probably more balanced than mine because my frustration is immense. And yes, I am cancelling a minimum of two of my accounts when OOW comes out.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: <a target="_blank" title="http://claws.guildportal.com" href="http://mikeshea.net/mt/mikepost.cgi?__mode=red;id=2281">Talaen</a> on September  4, 2004 10:42 AM</strong></p>
<p>From everything I've been reading and hearing, I have to agree with Loral - it seems like Omens and Gates were released in backwards order.</p>

<p>Personally I like what I'm hearing about Omens.  I especially liked in the dev chat where someone compared it to Velious.  To me, Velious was a pretty fair split between open single-group content and keyed raid-level content when it released.  Sure, now, years later, a lot of that keyed content is single-group, but at the time you normally weren't hunting in Western Wastes or definitely not NToV with one group.</p>

<p>I'd say that when Velious released it was about a 50/50 split between single-group and raid content, and it seems like Omens is going to be even more focused on being accessible to single groups as well, more like an 80/20 split.</p>

<p>Anyway, my primary characters are all melees so I really can't comment on focus items.  But as I lead a guild and as that guild is working its way up the low end of the raid ladder, progression is something I can talk about.</p>

<p>I think Teremar has a valid concern - none of my guild members are elemental geared yet we already hunt in single groups in low-end Gates zones for exp and occasional drops.  We do this because they are more challenging and less crowded than the Planes and because we can pull it off even with no planar equipment in most cases.  In terms of raid progression, I think it's very possible that if we keep going up the ladder we will end up skipping Time and possibly even the Elementals, especially if the raid requirement for Omens drops down to something more manageable like 4-6 groups.  None of us really want to have to become a huge impersonal guild just to see things.  In fact, most of my guild members are burnouts from raiding guilds who really prefer a smaller, more tightly-knit group.  If I were an SOE producer, making my earlier content essentially obsolete is something I would be very concerned about, and I would have my live team looking at addressing the bad things about older zones so that they are still desirable once the new expansion has been out for a few months.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Teremar on September  4, 2004 01:30 PM</strong></p>
<p>I'm assuming that level 5 focus effects will be introduced a lot like the level 4 focus effects were. In other words, not all that hard to get. If they made them drop only in areas that required Time gear to survive, that would be different.</p>

<p>So suppose I get a piece of the OoW equivalent of Ceramic, or maybe Ornate, with an important level 5 focus effect (but lame stats). This has two effects:</p>

<p>1) I am now completely uninterested in the equivalent level 4 focus effect. In evaluating items I will completely ignore the focus effect and only look at the other stats.</p>

<p>2) I now cannot replace that item with anything pre-OoW without reducing my effectiveness. A few percentage points on a focus effect is more important to me as a caster than the best stats (which will only be a few percent of my total hp/mana anyway).</p>

<p>Worthless is relative--a level 4 focus effect is not worthless by itself, but it is if I have the same effect at level 5.</p>

<p>Ironically, making the level 5 effects available via tribute would probably help. Yes, that makes the level 4 effects "worthless" immediately. But it also means I can replace an entry-level OoW focus effect item with something from Time without losing effectiveness.</p>

<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Brazzo on September  5, 2004 10:57 AM</strong></p>
<p>while it may be true that the path of progression will be OoW->GoD at some point, i imagine that when the highest end OoW zones come out those will be the very top of the end-game.  so if the content progression is actually :<br />
PoP -> Mid-OoW -> GoD -> End-OoW</p>

<p>then the question of whether level 5 foci ruins gear progression is whether people will be getting level 5 foci in Mid-OoW content that has a high percentage (not just L5 foci at all, but premium percentage versions) than that in GoD.  my feeling is that they will not be getting Foci at the part of OoW that is pre-GoD that has the same percentages as they will get in GoD endgame, therefore endgame GoD gear will still be more desirable than midgame OoW gear.  i'm basing this on the fact that you do not get foci equivalent to VT in mid PoP, or any LDoN, or early GoD.  you typically have to have moved three or more expansions down the road to have midgame gear in new content outstrip endgame gear in old content other than a few exceptional pieces (e.g. LDoN augmentable weapons and one or two pieces of ornate per set).</p>

<p><strong>Comment Posted by: svenalo on September  5, 2004 08:28 PM</strong></p>
<p>The real problem with this is that it makes all the nukes and whatnot not worth getting if you have the 45% focii from GoD (and probably even the 40% ones) and the nukes from level 65. Why? Take the level 68 mage nuke Blade Strike which does 100 or so more dmg for 10 more mana than the Rock of Taelosia spell (its the upgrade). Which Rock I will get full mana reduction, full damage focus...if I go for the new spell I will do less damage at the cost of more mana overall. Who in their right mind would use the new spell? And just about every one is the same kind of thing...</p>

<p>They should cap all focus effects at level 65, all of them, including OoW focuses.  At level 70, everything works at 50%.</p>

<p>Then you do increasingly-difficult quests in OOW to increase the maximum level of the focus.  Maybe six hours running around doing small errands to bump it up to 66, you have to kill a near-endgame godlike mob to get it up to 70.  This would compel the GoD-equipped folks to venture into OoW, but they won't have to destroy all their hard-won GoD/Time gear.</p>

<p>I to am canceling my entire eq live.  My entire family play's and we are very tired of expantion after expantion after expantion.  We have been playing for 4.5 years and we are sick of the way to difficult progression.  I feel they have killed the fun from eq when you port around without druids and wizzards.  Then make the zones so difficult to get keyed or flagged that you need 50 peeps to bumrush the mobs.  Sick is what it is and all 6 accounts will be done as soon as I hit post here.  I also have watched many friends quit for similar reasons.  Sony has actualy pushed me away from the On-line gaming scene.  Bye all enjoy the new expansion hope it works out for you all.</p>

<p>No, Because sony made most of the worth having gear in the game No Drop.</p>

<p>=( My account is canceled as well, but mainly because I quit a high end guild and now I have nothing to do, since I cannot progress in gear or zones on my own past this point.</p>

<p>Time, KT access. Full Time/Elem gear. Icon of the Alter. Now i can't go further, nor can I even find upgrades to my gear. I've gotten all of the AA's that are "needed" for my class (bit less than 300AA). There is no room in EQ for people like me, that Quit the high end and try to mesh in the lower tier. Had a lot of fun soloing BoT as a cleric melee style, or doing everything up to Elem as the main tank... but that didnt' last a whole lot of time.</p>

<p>High end focus effects were changed on Lucy to affect spells above level 65 without losing effectiveness.  Time foci now work normally on spells up to level 67.  Discordant (from Muramite armor) works on spells up to level 68.  I also heard that the reduction in effectiveness was changed to 5% per level, down from 10%.  I have no way to verify that, as I can't interpret that deep in the spell data.</p>

<p>Still, the bump is heartening for those of us who burned a lot of DKP on GoD items only to learn that they were going to be useless.  Now, my 45% damage focus will work on spells up to level 68, and even level 70 spells will receive 40.5%.</p>

<p>For those who will say "But what about those of us without access to Time/GoD focuses?" -- well, the same thing happened when poP came out, but worse.  Those of us without VT access saw our focuses become totally useless.  I used level 60 spells for ages after PoP came out because I didn't have the focuses.   At least this time your old focus items will still work, instead of totally conking out like they did in PoP.</p>

<p>Unless there are single-group items in Omens to help bridge the gap, this only creates a larger gap between raiding and non-raiding 65s.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: Rebeneaux Glittergold on September  7, 2004 11:39 PM</strong></p>
<p>Interestingly enough, my houshold is split on this issue.  We are not elementally equipped but just grinding to level 70 my cause some accounts to be cancelled.  </p>

<p>My opinion on the focus effect issue is that I think that there are a lot of people out there that don't have these items and so don't see the issue with the scaling.  I personally am worried about my 8th shawl more than anything else.  It is the only item that I own (with a special effect) that could be affected.  </p>

<p>I have all the level 4 focus effects.  If I have to find the Level 5 ones to use my new spells then so be it.  IMHO SOE's job is to make new content interesting and challenging, not easy.  SOE's job is to make cooler gear.  Sometimes this means making older gear obsolete, no matter how difficult is was to get initially.</p>

<p>Anyway just my 2 cents.</p>

<p>I think I'd be less upset about the focus effects if not for the fact that half my blasted focus items that are now semi-useful are no drop.  This means those ornate silk boots I spent 18k on will now be outdated, but impossible to sell to recoup some of the money spent.  The cool ranged item from the KoS raid is going to be one more thing rotting in the bank eventually.  If any of the new focuses are droppable, I think we can assume the prices are going to be far beyond what a lot of players can afford for a few years at least.  I'm not whining (I hope), it's just a bit depressing seeing 6 months of work go down the drain.  Going from a decently geared casual to a pathetic substitute for a high end caster is going to sting.

<p>Official flip flop:</p>

<p>Rytan - The scaling of the focus effects past 65 will effect all of the existing foci, although generally the higher end focus items have a higher max level then the lower tier focus effects. Generally the Elemental and time foci are capped at level 67, and the high end gates foci are capped at level 68. </p>

<p>So Elemental, Time, and GoD effects get a higher cap than normal focus 4 items.  Depending on the gear that we see in Omens this could either be good or bad.  Only time will tell.</p>
