<h1 class="article_title">Everquest's Two Year Outlook</h1>
<p>by Loral on December 03, 2006</p>

<p>With the release of the Serpent's Spine behind us, now is the perfect time to step back and consider the possible future of Everquest. This article will attempt to predict what changes we will see in Everquest over the next two years.</p>

<p>Let us start with the easy ones.  SOE will likely release four expansions between now and December 2008. These will likely include both large expansions with lots of open content and smaller expansions with more focused instanced content. The release schedule will likely continue every six months.</p>

<p>Expansion releases will continue as long as SOE sees a profit from their development and release. Because the associated costs for distribution are so low, expect to see SOE continue to release expansions for download only. Retail boxes will likely focus exclusively on compilation packs and be released in early spring.</p>

<p>The fall 2008 expansion will likely include another level increase to level 80 including all of the associated spells and AAs. Expect to see a continuation of the spell system found in TSS in the future.</p>

<p>It would appear, based on this last year's release schedules, that SOE plans to push EQ2 to new players with retail boxes released during the holidays. EQ releases will focus on keeping existing players interested in continuing their subscriptions.</p>

<p>The Serpent's Spine was SOE's attempt to bring in new players into the game but, without a retail package, it is unlikely to have accomplished this goal. I would not expect to see another low-level expansion within the next two years.</p>

<p>Everquest's population will continue to fall. Without bringing in new players, old players, however much SOE attempts to either keep them or bing them back, will still leave and some will leave for good. The attrition will not happen in great numbers all at once. The fall will be slight and steady over a trend of bumps and dives as expansions are released.</p>

<p>Another server migration may occur later within the next two year period depending on how far the population dips.</p>

<p>Everquest will not end over the next two years. This is easily predicted as we watch SOE's support for Everquest Online Adventures - a game with a far smaller population. Throughout its life, SOE has never attempted to migrate EQOA players to another game, nor have they shut the game down. With a very small population of players, SOE continues to keep EQOA alive.</p>

<p>EQOA is our canary in the cave. We can watch it and see how long SOE is willing to keep a low population game alive. As long as it survives, EQ is more than safe.</p>

<p>Do not expect Everquest to make any radical changes to characters, combat, or any other aspect of the actual game outside of what we already understand. SOE learned what can happen when it makes radical changes to a game's core system with the combat changes in Star Wars Galaxies. There will be no class mergers, no removal of classes, no migrations of classes, and no huge change to combat.</p>

<p>SOE will not attempt to merge EQ with EQ2. This rumor seems to keep popping up but when one really considers what it would take, one understand that it just won't happen. There is no way to migrate EQ characters into EQ2. They are too far different and nothing would be gained in the process.</p>

<p>With Blizzard's recent announcement that it plans to focus raids at a maximum of 25 players and with Everquest 2 continuing to focus at no more than 26 players, Everquest clearly has the market cornered on large-scale 54 person raids. Expect SOE to continue to cultivate these large raid encounters over the next two years and likely indefinitely.</p>

<p>With EQ2 and WOW also including a lot of solo content, expect Everquest to continue focusing content around six-person groups. While more solo options may become available in small amounts, do not expect a drastic leap in solo content such as great improvements in solo ability or in solo instances. Solo content will likely focus around single-person quests.</p>

<p>I do not expect SOE to return to the days of heavily flagged content such as that found in Planes of Power or Gates of Discord. End-zones will continue to require some sort of quest, task, or series of raids to enter, but SOE understands how it segments their market to flag entire sets of zones as they did in the past. I do not expect them to make that mistake again.</p>

<p>Over the past two years, SOE has included some radical changes in Everquest's features. Monster missions and spirit shrouds were two of these features. I do not expect to see SOE stepping out that far again in the next two years. With a clear focus on keeping existing players and bringing back retired players, EQ will focus its content and features around those that made it successful over the past seven years.</p>

<p>Now for some wild predictions:</p>

<p>Sometime over the next two years, SOE will release a rebuild of Plane of Knowledge. They will finally accept that this is the most popular city in Norrath and will always continue to be so no matter how many rebuilds of Freeport or new cities of Crescent Reach they create. SOE will attempt to bring the culture of old cities to the neighborhoods of Knowledge.</p>

<p>SOE will look for ways to make it easier for low and mid-level players to reach the raiding game. This may include things such as new reward systems for pickup-raid friendly content or ways to increase player power more quickly than traditional hunting and grinding. With a clear focus on and market advantage of high-end raid content, SOE will look for ways to open up this strength to more players.</p>

<p>SOE will not attempt to reduce downtime any further than they have. With WOW cornering the market on short-term MMO gaming, EQ will continue to focus on gaming in two to four hour sessions.</p>

<p>SOE is unlikely to close the equipment gap between raiders and non-raiders although hopefully they will attempt to reduce this gap and make it easier to tune high-end content for both sets of players. More likely, however, SOE will try to show non-raiders the advantages of raiding and make it easier for them to join in.</p>

<p>And now my final prediction: SOE will return to Kunark! With the old popularity of this expansion, SOE will release a "Ruins of Kunark 2" expansion that takes us back into the world of the Iksar and the Ring of Scale. Whether this is a LDON-style expansion or a larger TSS style expansion, I couldn't say. Perhaps SOE will combine two sequals into one and create Lost Dugeons of Norrath 2: The Dungeons of Kunark.</p>

<p>So there are my predictions for the next two years. However it turns out, I look forward to seeing the future unfold.</p>

<p>I think that "more of the same" is probably a safe bet, & continued expansion of the game using an already existing zone but "revamped" to include access points to new zones, possibly using existing lore as a starting point.</p>

<p>I would love to see another "LDoN style" expansion & this might be what is needed in order for them to revisit the existing LDoN content, review it, revamp it, & have this & the newer expansion mesh in terms of updated points, task & experience systems.</p>

<p>I also hope to see more of the "hot zone" style revamps whereby they add new features, mobs, mechanics & itemisation to existing zones.</p>

<p>Itemisation in general needs a review, hugely time consuming so i wont hold my breath on that one.</p>

<p>Hmmmm....  the outlook on an influx of new players to EQ seems grim.  New players have been a rich source of recruits for family style guilds. Some stay in the family guilds others learn the ropes of eq and move on to raiding guilds.<br />
SOE trying to get us all raiding is well and good but without a radical change to raiding I am not sure how that will happen.  I would think that a lot of those who want to raid have taken that road by now.  If you have played for several years and havent been interested in heavy raiding before what will change that now?</p>
<p><strong>Comment Posted by: <a href="mailto&#58;Corwyhn&#64;lionsoftheheart&#46;com">Corwyhn</a> on December  4, 2006 09:50 AM</strong></p>
<p>Hmmm... I see another problem here.  The game with the shrinking playerbase is the one staking out the raids with the largest player requirements.  Seems to me if you are the game whose player base is shrinking you may not want to invest your future in LARGE raids.</p>

<p>Some might thing the answer is consolidation of guilds.  This has been happening over and over. Why wont it continue.  Part of the problem is that EQ is a social game too.  In the old days guilds disolved because of poor leadership or lack of commitment to running a guild etc... these days it is just because their player base has faded away.  They eventually break up and join another guild but each time that happens it tears up the social side of the game.</p>

<p>I think one of the problems EQ faces is that the devs or those that call the shots are not able to picture all of the factors that make EQ what it is.</p>

<p>They dont seem interested in closing the raid/group gear gap partly becasue raiders feel they should have better gear. Now if that is because they think only those that did the work should get the gear thats one thing.  If they like to feel superior because they have better gear and that is why they raid then what happens when all that is left in the game is raiders?  Who are they going to be better then?</p>

<p>If SOE can't manage EQ what will give them the ability to manage EQ2?</p>

<p>Not crazy about warcraft, If Sigils game is successful I have no doubt the deal with soe to provide servers and customer support will change to full ownership.  That leaves me out there looking.  And I am coming to realize its not so much looking for a game as for the way the game will be managed by whatever company runs it.</p>

<p>If SOE is smart they will finally realize that for eq to continue to be a cash cow far into the future they need to keep a super healty group game as well as support their large raiding.  And large raiding needs something there for players who know their stuff BUT are just not interested in the type of raiding playstyle currently required.  Give us some easier just for fun raids that we can do to bring us closer to raid gear.  I really think we need three or four tiers concentrated on.  Solo game, Group game, easy raid game, dedicated raid game.</p>

<p>The easy raid game will be great for open raids and large family guild raids AND provide a transition to the dedicated raid game to some extent.  The easy raid game will also hopefully draw in a lot more group gamers which will help close the gear gap between the various groups. That will let group content be better tuned to everyone.</p>

<p>You aren't serious, are you?  </p>

<p>I cannot understand why SOE spent one cent redoing the old zones.  It certainly isn't a visual improvement and no one goes there in any case ... zero players and I mean ZERO.  </p>

<p>The one exception is Nek Forest (which was done not once, but twice and looks a little better) and even then, why did they bother?  It's an unused newbie zone with all the mystery & danger of good vs evil now gone from the game. </p>

<p>Let's have them spend the money on content.  NO ONE PLAYS A GAME BECAUSE IT LOOKS GOOD  if the content is boring or non existant.</p>

I do think the traditional step after a level cap increase is an Item point-system / instanced expansion. Hopefully that takes a step towards closing the gear gap a bit further, and the spell distribution system is continued in its happily open format.</p>

<p>Personally, long term I'd like to see a continued focus on introducing more 30 minute options into EQ. Finding a way to actually work PvP into the regular game would be a fun new wrinkle as well. EQ definitely has the instancing technology to handle this, its just a question of cutting through the hodgepoge of PvP code that's been cobbled together over the years.</p>

<p>One other thing to remember, if SOE isn't focused on drawing new players to EQ1, then they'll have to accept the fact that their current players will start to age, and have fewer long blocks of playtime available. If the goal is to keep the current subscribers entertained, then that will be a shift that needs to occur. Downtime isn't so much the issue, its going to be much more about how long various encounters are designed to last.<br />

<p>It was already mooted before the last expansion, that quests would be introduced that rewarded the player with some basic AA’s (run 3, defensive etc), I think we will see that appear, a further attempt by SoE, so they will claim to get new players in, but without a box sale version it will be half hearted, unless they push a compilation box set out the following spring.</p>

<p>Loral mentioned that SoE will try to get non raiders to jump to raiding. I disagree, as TSS even the ‘smaller’ encounters seem to be geared to 30, and the reward is one drop. I don’t think this is the way to go. A mob dropping one loot, should be geared more to 2-3 groups. Just the time taken to move 30-40 people, have all in place, the lost rezzed, buffed, the LD, waited for, just doesn’t make it worth it.<br />

I think the outlook is pretty on par.  Basically "don't expect anything really new" sums it up.</p>

<p>And that's as it should be.  EQ at this point is a legacy product in the same vein as Ultima Online, or Diablo 2.</p>

<p>As far as zone revamps go to some extent I agreet that they do not really do much for players AT LEAST AS THEY HAVE BEEN DONE IN THE PAST.  The way soe does zone revamps needs to change.  Zone revamps in general should re-level zones for a higher range including reitemization.  For city zones to be used again we need more high level zones close by.</p>

<p>Right now a lot of the old expansion zones are just dead leaves and branches on the EQ tree.  Some say leave them there they arent hurting anything.  But as they become more and more of the tree they are pulling it down.  Cut away some of the dead wood and let something new grow in its place.  Revamp zones but dont just revamp the graphics.  Give us storyline changes, higher level mobs and reitemization.</p>

<p>We need more zones at the higher end as the EQ population becomes older and more and more of us have a preponderane of very high level toons.   This in no way hurts any new players we might get because we have far more low level zones then needed. It could also be argued that with the tutorial available the real starting level is whatever the tutorial maxes out at.  Or we could just say level 10.  In effect level 10 becomes the new level 1.</p>

<p>SOE has to look at the reality of the situation. If they are not going to market aggressively for new players then zone revamps have to be more then making the zone pretty.  In essence they have to become new zones.  But the whole idea of using the revamps to advance storylines is so cool.   <br />

<p>Another bone I would like to throw out there for people to chew on a bit is player marketing of EQ.  If SOE doesn't seem to be marketing the game in such a way as to garner new players is there anything that we as players can do to get new people into the game?  Assuming we want that I guess.  For me, one thing new players bring to the game is that Christmas morning feeling.  Christmas isnt the same unless you have some little ones getting all excited about their presents.  Those of us that have been around a while do end up becoming a bit jaded.  Its nice to experience that awe and wonder even if its done vicariously through newbies. </p>

<p>I don't think that TSS was targetted at the right audience, it really did seem that a huge amount of work went into TSS & a lot of the background changes that accompnied it were all "groundwork" for a future push for "new" players.</p>

<p>TSS was aimed at former players.</p>

<p>I hope they now focus on getting new players, TSS did indeed bring some former players back...& in a large part caused some older players to just quit over its flagging system, I don't think it was as big a sucess as hoped for.</p>

<p>Next few expansions, & the direction of the company should try & focus on garnering a fresh audience, allowing them to progress up to a point, by themselves, then encouraging transition into the raiding game, by way of better designed group content, & having more "casual friendly" raiding scenarios, pitched somewhere between the hardest group content & raid content from a year or so ago, the time-gap between raid level gear & group/casual raiding gear, is something that will need tweaking of course, if they with to retain the usefulness of older raiding content, then lowering the difficulty/time required/amount of flags needed in order for casual raiders to access it should be considered.</p>

<p>skuz check this out: this is the time of ps3,360,Wii,wow, vanguard....etc....and you are a young potential gamer. so you do some reasearch on games. you get to eq. you check on some sites. you go to some chatrooms for more info.  and ask some current eq players about eq. potential noobie to mayhap be pwned by skuz one days asks" so why should i come to eq?" skuz replies " cause it has the most roxXorz end game raiding."potential says" well how do i get to the end game raiding so i can be 733t?" skuz says" well you will need level 75 and about 1000 aa atleast.you will need to find people to backflag you up to current content.your best bet is to get PL up with the level and aa and then guild hop for the back flagging.then apply to us and we may take you or we may not." potential" hmmm that sounds like alot of bs.i was just really wanting to play a video game and be entertained." skuz" roflz......you have no idea...errr i mean come on,its fun.i promise." so the potential new customer things to himself" hmmmmm on the one hand i can give up my life and try to get on this 733t old game eq! but on the other hand i can keep my life and just play some video games to have a little fun when i want to...." thats a tough decision. yeah eq will be back on the rise soon surely......</p>

<p>How to save EQ from itself? Simple ... harness the power of the Moss Snake. Yes the all powerful Moss Snake. </p>

<p>How can the Moss Snake accomplish this. Well the Moss Snake can do anything even save EQ. Just allow the Moss Snake access to all zones and dungeons (come on you know you want to).</p>

<p>Anytime a player kills a Moss Snake he will gain a level and a really nice piece of loot.<br />
A gain in level occurs up to the starting level of the latest expansion. When that level is reached then its back to the counting sand grains with a toothpick routine.</p>

<p>However the Moss Snake is not done with you yet. Continue to kill the Moss Snake and now you will get 1 AA point (and you still get a really nice piece of loot to boot).</p>

<p>Now a newbie can come into the game. Become an expert Moss Snake hunter. In no time at all he will be geared and leveled enough to actually enjoy a majority of EQ's content.</p>

<p>You can even have specialized Moss Snakes. Like a Moss_Snake_Tailor. Everytime you kill one of them you get a skill point in tailoring.</p>

<p>Fear the Moss Snake or it will kick you. (didn't they fix that, morons, best part of the game).</p>

Well, for sure your scenario will apply to people only interested in quick-fix instant gratification style videogames, but i'd happily lay odds there are a good deal of people looking for something more substantial, & of those there will be a majority that enjoy the game as a non-hardcore raider & a few that decide to challenge themselves further, max out their character & want to still progress beyond groups & casual raiding.</p>

<p>The beauty of eq is it has such a depth & variety & can accommodate a huge variety of playstyles, for those looking for 10 minutes of solo fun WoW pretty much fits the bill, for those looking for something with true breadth & depth there is eq, the only "weak point" of eq is the fact that due to it being an old game there are so few new players to meet, group up with, & there is not much of a solo game in eq to compensate for that.<br />

<p>"& there is not much of a solo game in eq to compensate for that."</p>

<p>/gems - just kidding.</p>

<p>There is a lot of solo content in EQ.  It is usually all about grinding, lots of grinding.  To make grinding easier, some turn to writing their own macros to do the grinding for them.  The number of people who use 3rd party software are easy to spot and often do not care who knows.  Is that fair? - maybe or maybe not.  In a world of maturing players that get better jobs, play more intelligently and begin starting families, the pressure is to either catch up or quit.  People do turn to quick fixes and also take the time to learn how to play "with 3rd party" software.</p>

<p>SoE faces the issue that they have to choose between stopping 3rd party software that cuts out the time sinks or to allow it to continue to foster the continued growth of an even larger playerbase that "expects" to use 3rd party software in order to do the most mundane tasks.</p>

<p>It is a sad situation that divides the playerbase a group of cheaters, and the other into a group of players who cannot legitemately catch up to their peers.</p>

<p>Should SoE implement a full featured map?<br />
Should SoE implement scripting?<br />
Should SoE remove the mechanizms that permit one to /warp, /fade, etc. even if it permanently breaks the abilities of some classes?</p>

<p>Those are all some tough questions.  Banning all the current users who play with 3rd party tools would break the bank, and most who do use them would not play if forced to go back to basic EQ.</p>

<p>SoE will make things more challenging, but will it be at a cost to creating an even greater gulf between two sets of players? - Only time will tell.</p>

<p>I think we will see a continued decline of hard core 6 day a week raiding guilds, and the rise of "casual" part time raiding guilds that raid 3-4 days a week.  RL is taking over and i have migrated to one of these part-time guilds.  </p>

<p>Smart GL's will see this altenative as a means of holding folks that want to progress but don't want to be married to the game anymore.  This will help extend the playing life of existing raiders.  Heavy raiding will be limited to a guild or two on the server but most will contimue to decrease raiding scheduals to accomidate the addicted raider that just can't raid as much as they used too.  Guilds like this will see thier fair share of "family" type players since these guilds cater to the more family non-har core raider.  This pattern is already gaining steam.</p>

<p>A prediction that VI realizes that expansions are not purchased because the majority of the player base is several expansions behind in content.  The realization the pace must be sped up that brings excitement to the base of players:</p>

<p>#1 Opening up older end-zones by removing flag/key requirements.  Seb/ST/VT/PoP/GoD.</p>

<p>#2 Areas where people WANT to congregate for a fast pickup group. EQ is too fragmented now and heyday had great zones with 70+ people in them. Where is that zone today?</p>

<p>#3 Increased drop rates on older content bosses. Many guilds at lower levels don't use DKP, have more part-time players, and do not raid 7 days a week. = It takes longer to gear up. More drops will help close multi-expansion gap and create some excitement.</p>

<p>#4 EQ excels at large raids and should take advantage of this. Next expansion featuring an enormous castle where pickup groups are outside and raid forces work to storm the keep. Include tunnels, dungeons, kitchens, etc.  Could drive numbers like a constant GM event if done right.</p>

<p>#5 All new expansion zones will be targetted near old world content making everything more tight and minimizing travel & grouping time.</p>

<p>Brewall</p>

<p></p>

<p>#2 With large raid forces at VI's core strength</p>

<p>Honestly, I wish they would work on a all new release of EQ. Call it EQ3 or EQ Heritage or EQ Legends. Whatever you do, make it a true sequel to EQ.</p>

<p>Launch the original game, with imporved graphics, character models and quest interface. Add in a few new zones and quest that never made it into the original.</p>

<p>Roll out the expansions like Kunark and Velious and PoP and correct the mistakes of the past.</p>

<p>That is what I would like.</p>

<p>"A prediction that VI realizes that expansions are not purchased because the majority of the player base is several expansions behind in content."</p>

<p>I'm not sure that's true.</p>

<p>Knowledge is that place and that's one of the reasons I hope SOE rebuilds it.</p>

<p>"#3 Increased drop rates on older content bosses. Many guilds at lower levels don't use DKP, have more part-time players, and do not raid 7 days a week. = It takes longer to gear up. More drops will help close multi-expansion gap and create some excitement."</p>

<p>I think SOE would rather just make new content and offer rewards on the new stuff than rework old content.</p>

<p>"Next expansion featuring an enormous castle where pickup groups are outside and raid forces work to storm the keep. Include tunnels, dungeons, kitchens, etc."</p>

<p>This is an excellent excellent idea. An entire expansion built around a huge castle or keep and each zone is one part of the castle. I love it.</p>

<p>This last part is the problem. Game companies want you to go through all of their content, not just the high-end stuff. This is why they didn't do any transfers to EQ2 (one of the reasons). They want everyone to start over again instead of jumping into a brand new game at level 75.</p>

<p>I think SOE will make a new EQ MMO but I think its going to be a PS3 game. We'll see.<br />

<p>EQ is dying a slow death because as you have pointed out, they no longer bring in new blood.</p>

<p>The thing EQ still has going for it is name recognition, that and a very large fan base that could still take comfort in roaming a land that many knew and loved, at one time or another.</p>

<p>However this resource is limited and to let it just wither away would be a shame. EQ2 was not a sequel. It only had only familiar names tossed in here and there.</p>

<p>Think how great it would be to roam an expanded Crushbone, same basic layout as now, but with new tunnels, and an expanded castle.</p>

<p>Stats that we all understand on our equipment, albit with some small improvements. Many quest that we are familiar with, but others that are new. I mean even the zone revamps could be used.</p>

<p>Also, I didnt expand on my thought earlier about equipment, or a bonus for original EQ participants. I was not suggesting that they should shut down EQ but rather they could issue something that is directly related to a character on you station account. So for instance, say I quit at lvl 65, maybe I get attributes, or an augment that I chose when rolling my character that would benefit me forever. Sooo...</p>

<p>For instance 1 point for every 10 lvls accrued on your highest lvl character on the account. No bonus for AA. </p>

<p>Then when rolling your character you can chose how to use them.</p>

<p>Maybe 7 points would buy you innate enduring breath, or mana regen. Or 1 point could raise your stat cap permenantly. It would allow a tiny bit of uniqueness and it would be a carrot to keep people playing.</p>

<p>I dont know why I even posting this. I think we all know it will never happen, but for me, I cant think of anything I would like more than a true sequel to EQ, and expansions I could really look forward to. It would be so great to see stats I was familiar with, basic map layouts that I know. Named mobs that bring back memories. </p>

<p>Trash the old quest interface and make it friendly for noobies and update character models and graphics and I really think a ton of people would return home to EQ, and certainly many new people would be introduced to the game that had more magic than anything released since.</p>

<p>Yeah, I've always been pretty disappointed that aside from mistmoore, they've pretty much left Fadwyer alone when it came to revamps. There are several potential zones left on the original cloth map that never got added (eg. the Wayunder lake, for a long overdue underwater zone), and a few tweaks to CB would be quite cool.</p>

<p>Somehow I'd wager that EQ2's product roadmap had something to do with that. Even though the two games have different timelines, SOE tries not to have the two games overlap with new content.</p>

<p>That's probably also why the Plane of Sky never got its badly needed revamp, an EQ2 expansion got in the way.</p>

<p>On the upside though, it could be surmised that EQ1 got its PvP revamp a few years ago because EQ2 wasn't able to get PvP finished up in time for launch.</p>

<p>It would just be nice if EQ1 didn't seem to be playing second fiddle. It still has many good things going for it. The most frustrating aspect of being a fan of the original game, is seeing how much attention gets showered publicly on other products. Its part of life, of course, but then again, so is disappointment. :)</p>

<p>Realistically, I don't doubt that SOE will have an EQ related title in the works for the PS3, though my hope is that it doesn't replace a potential sequel on the PC platform. EQOA was able to co-exist in its own little piece of the timeline, the same could be true of the PS3.</p>

<p>EQ is dying because of the lack of a progression path on itemization improvement. Once a causal player has reached the  bazaar "limit" on "no drop" equipment, he is essentially at a dead end.<br />
To join a raiding guild and maybe get subsequent improvement in itemization, with considerable time commitment I might add, you can't be a casual player. The raiding guilds have evolved to a point where if you dont have at least 200- 300 AA's and be somewhere at or near the top level,forget even applying to the guild.<br />
This structual development in EQ has evolved primarily because of the Sony no drop policy. There is a very large gap between bazaar items and no drop items resulting from large raids.<br />
Any neebie starts out as a casual player. One look  at what it would take to get to the high end of the game. i.e. having good equipment, spells and armour turns off any new entrants into the game. The avid dedicated player now inhabiting the high end of the game is an aging population. And any Iowa Curve (time life- depletion- "depreciation", depopulation also called population death) analysis will show that a population with no new entrants ,  depending soley on an alleged "core" will eventually shut down the game.</p>

<p>"EQ is dying because of the lack of a progression path on itemization improvement." </p>

<p>There is no lack of itemization improvement.  Every single expansion has expanded and enhanced itemization in the game for raiders, non-raiders, and casual players.</p>

<p><br />
"Once a causal player has reached the bazaar "limit" on "no drop" equipment, he is essentially at a dead end."</p>

<p>Bazaar purchasable gear is nice and all, but there is better gear out there that is one groupable and nodrop.  Some of it is soloable, depending on your class.</p>

<p><br />
"To join a raiding guild and maybe get subsequent improvement in itemization, with considerable time commitment I might add, you can't be a casual player. The raiding guilds have evolved to a point where if you dont have at least 200- 300 AA's and be somewhere at or near the top level,forget even applying to the guild."</p>

<p>Not all raiding guilds are the same or have the same requirements for entry, just as not all players are the same.</p>

<p>Our guild, which raids three nights a week, does not require any AAs to join.  You do however have to be level 70, which I suppose is "near the top level."  There are many other guilds similar to ours, that accept lower level members.  There are also a lot of family guilds that raid.  I was in one for years.</p>

<p><br />
"This structual development in EQ has evolved primarily because of the Sony no drop policy. There is a very large gap between bazaar items and no drop items resulting from large raids."</p>

<p>Yes, this is true.  However, I would like to point out the irony of your entire position.  You claimed in the first statement that there was a lack of progression, but making everything tradable would eliminate progression all together.  The only thing that would stop anyone from having the best gear in the game would be money.</p>

<p>You can't have it both ways.  No drop items are tied to progression, for without them, there is no such thing.</p>

<p>If you got rid of no drop items, the same people who raid, those "with considerable time commitment," would have all the best items in the game, and you would be left complaining about how much everything costs and how unfair that is to causal players.</p>

<p><br />
"Any neebie starts out as a casual player. One look at what it would take to get to the high end of the game. i.e. having good equipment, spells and armour turns off any new entrants into the game."</p>

<p>I think that this is an unfair depiction of all 'neebies.'  Don't you think that there is anyone that will join the game in order to enjoy the increadible volume of content that is not found only in the last 2-3 zones in the game?  There is so much to enjoy in the game without ever having the best gear or getting in a raiding guild that it is silly.  </p>

<p>In everything you said in your post, this is the only thing I can agree with.  The emphasis should be placed on the word "eventually."  Eventually, the game will decline and shut down unless it gets new blood.  I'll go a step further and say that eventually, the game will shut down regardless.  It won't happen tomorrow, it probably won't happen next year.  It might not even happen for another five years, but eventually, it will shut down.  In the meantime, I plan on enjoying it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you have to have three people to get most missions.  A friend of mine groups with people that are afk in the guild hall and solos missions.  If you can find a single player that is not busy for a while, you can do the same.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind, I'm about as casual a player as you'll find, but I'd have to say this statement is entirely backwards.</p>

<p>Once a raider has reached near-peak gear, if something happens that would alter their playtime and force them into a solo / single group situation, they will see very few obtainable improvements for their gear for several years. </p>

<p>"Eventually"-- You agree with my Iowa Curve conclusion!!! Do you know what  an Iowa curve represents? If so, have you published or filed Iowa Curves Studies or positions in any jurisdictions. By jurisdictions ;I mean FCC, FERC,  NRC, Judicial, State regulatory Commissions et all. I have filed em in most if not all above or have had my studies adopted in such. I can say to you "Eventually" is not a long term conclusion but one that may be in months but not more than 24-30 months. <br />
A look at the present demographics and examples of MIA's in big guilds I have joined indicates the aging population is becoming more rapidly deminished. If I did a complete Iowa curve study and matched the  empirical statistics I have observed with a corresponding Iowa Curve ( there are 24 Iowa curves) I think EQ is not gonna be around more than 24-30 months. My Iowa Curve agrument rebutts all your conclusions in disagreement with my posting but thanks. If I went as far to statistically correlate this declining population with Sony's greedy no drop policy I think I would find a strong correlation. In my opinion, Sony's greedy policy changes after taking over from  Verant but is the reason EQ is going down the tubes. Sony knows this and is the reason they started up EQ2.Sony is just milking EQ till the very end.</p>

<p>golfertwo,</p>

<p>It has been over 30 years since I took my college lessons on population decay and statistics, and I have not used such awesome tools as the Iowa whatchumacallit, so I will humbly accede [[watch the sarcasm, lets focus on the topic -- Loral]] in the use such analysis tool in order to ascertain the demise of an aging game like Everquest.  Surely under such obvious analytical prowess and statistical proof, we should all cede to your assertion that EQ is doomed.</p>

<p>I have but one question for you.  If for some unexplained reason, the game were to say, manage to survive for longer than you think possible, can I quote you when some yoyo makes such a claim three years from now? </p>

<p>You’ll have to excuse me.  I need to get to enjoying the game before it evaporates.</p>

<p>As with any idae like "no Drop" there are those who are for and those that are against.</p>

<p>Me, I love it. It means as a casual I can still find single group upgrade that I can attain myself. If all items were no drop I would have bought a whole heap of raid stuff and then then only upgrades for me wuold be really high end raid items that I maybe couldn't afford. But once I do that what's the incentive for me to keep playing the game, "I don't Raid". So what would happen is everyone would buy the best gear they could afford, be uber for 2 weeks, get bored and then leave.</p>

<p>Personally I would remove attunable gear from the game as well. I would like to see tradeskilled items being better instead. It is a shame TSS has wiped out the value on DON armor to a large extent. It would have been nice to find some way to extend it instead.</p>

<p>Keisa,<br />
Iowa curves where developed less than 30 years ago by two or three Professors at U of Iowa. Iowa curves were developed primarily to do depreciation studies on regulated state and federal electric,  sewer & water and Telephony asset survival lives so that an accurate annual depreciation expense and  "reserve" (i.e accumulated depreciation reserve) could be built into regulated rates and balance sheets. Iowa curve were and are  prolly not taught as a university "Population decay"  course, whatever that means, nor a rigourous statistical course that I know of but these professors periodically hold seminar "classes' two or three times a year in Kalamazo and Grand Rapids Michigan. Iowa curves can be fitted to any population that has "deaths" be it retired or salvaged equip or even people. A death in EQ would be somebody leaving the game, the curve could be found and fitted based on the life span survival of peeps in game and when their subsequent death occurs. So I doubt your college courses came even close to what Iowa curves represent. As an "expert witness" all the way thru courts such as the 8th Circuit , I made a statement in response to your agreement on the word you thought was safe-- that word being-- "eventually"--- well you fell, on your own accord, into that mistake, - the ole adage dont agree with something you know nothing about or ask a question you dont know the answer to , I believe, is the reason for your rather empty reply regarding my alleged "superior intellect". There is no need for name calling but an Iowa curve could be set up to determine the Life of EQ, I didnt do any alleged "analysis", believe me finding an accurate Iowa curve fit requires a lot of data over a time period of at least 5 years -- I just have observed the thinning out of the population over the last 7 years and based on my experience of doing a LOT of Iowa curve analysis on plotted and record kept data have deduced the reasons for , what I consider, a rather steep population decline combined with the lack of any new entrants to the game. One telling fact that is not a statistic. It is that Wal- Mart no longer carries any EQ software , at least where I live. If EQ lasts 3 years or more I will probably be a pleasently surprised "yoyo" but then you know  the make of  a yoyo much better than I. </p>

<p>anyone who has ever read my posts knows i dont like everquest. i predict eq will last another 4-5 years but what will happen is that soe will decided to end it, not the decline in players. i think there will be some mass exodus in the next few months. one thing some of you never seem to touch on is the operateing cost of eq. i see where some of you compare eq life with that of the game uo. i'd be willing to say i believe it costs more money to run eq then it does uo. soe dosent spend money on advertising eq, fixing many of the problems with eq that have been there for years, and now they are only offering eq as a digital download. seeing a eq package on a shelf in electronic stores and department stores was most likely the last real advertisement for eq and now it seems many places dont even stock eq any longer. is eq like a suffering old cow left out in the pasture just waiting for the devs/soe to put it out of misery?</p>

<p>Ldon MkII would be awesome.  Based in Kunark? Even better. Would give them the excuse to start the revamps that we're seeing spreading from the Freeport area.</p>

<p>Predictions<br />
Following the pattern of ldon/dod missions and having a normal/harder/raid structure (no cursor loot), Ldon MkII will have many people enjoying the content whilst the boards moan that it wasn't the best expansion, Velious was, and why can't we have that again even though SoS /was/ Velious MkII, just without the opposing factions (that was the whole reason Velious felt so big and interesting).  <br />
One of the expansions before LDoN MkII, electric bugaloo, will be the LoY/Pirates of Norrath expansion that'll be the link between Antonica and Kunark.<br />
Server mergers will occur and x-server instancing/grouping will be implemented at the same time.<br />
Bards will start to be broken every patch like they used to be as Bard code is changed.<br />

<p>Just my quick thoughts on some of the things said so far on this thread;</p>

<p>1) Prior to the "graphical updates", most all zone lines in the game where visually consistant.  Not all, but most.  That is to say, if you where standing at the zone line, and took a step and zoned, the graphics blended well enough that other than the loading please wait, visually you appeared to have taken just one step.</p>

<p>Now, however, the zone lines mesh poorly going from revamped zone to revamped zone.  Simple as that.  The result is even less of a sense of immersion than before, with absolutely no excuse for it.  They just did the graphics for Freeport, there's no reason that zoning to the commonlands should be so visually jarring.</p>

<p>2) Time vs. reward vs. quality product.  Generally speaking I think we can all agree the SOE are for the most part fairly imaginative.  The last 7 expansions have seen one new bright boy idea after another.  Only we seem to see that they never liked any of the bright boy ideas enough to carry them forward.  Actually one could say EQ has become a proving ground for bright boy ideas with no attempt what so ever to have any kind of unified theme.  That said, they appear to not have a clear idea as to what the "future" of the game is.  Further they appear to lack any in house tool traking the status of all the work done up to date.</p>

<p>For example;<br />
Anyone who has attempted to do all the quests in the "new" Freeport has come across examples of quests that are either incomplete, or otherwise broken.<br />
This is work completed in the last 24 months on thier part.  Thier track record is worse the older the content in question (any one remember the Shakey scarecrow issue?).</p>

<p>Simply put, it is easier for a poorly managed group of inventive people to churn out "new" stuff that mostly works.  Than for that same group to try to figure out how fix what they apparently couldn't get right in the first place.  Much less stuff that likely pre-dates most of the existing staff and certainly predates the current lead designer.</p>

<p>3) Market issues.  The MMO market is no longer a niche market.  It is mainstream.  Added to that, the PC game market is not longer "just geeks", it too is mainstream.</p>

<p>The average consumer is willing to put up with a lot.  They are however not willing to continue to poor money into things that just don't work.  Not when equivallent working products are available.</p>

<p>Like it or not, new MMO's are being released with a far smaller number of user obvious screw ups, bugs, incomplete content and crud.  These new MMO's present consistant immersive worlds with unified tools and themes.  The content is by and large issue free from the point of view of the average user.  The newer MMO's by and large have an active developer base that is doing thier best to make thier games error free, with no indication that they concider any content/issue too old to matter.</p>

<p>Now ask yourself.  If you'd never played EQ before, and you where told you had a choice;  Game A offerend the largest "potential" amount of content of any game ever made, however large portions of the content was broken, unused, and appeared abandoned by the game developers.  Game A also was had multiple often conflicting game mechanics, was visually non-immersive, and had an online forum where some of the most rabid game fans had been given moderator ability to shut down any ability to make complaints.</p>

<p>Games B, C, and D, have one forth the content, where visually immersive, had active users in all areas of content, had forums that where moderated but not by rapid fans, and an active developer base who's work task was the live game, not 'yet another expansion at the expense of the past expansions...'</p>

<p><br />
Lastly, don't for a minute think SOE isn't aware of these points.  They know what thier target audience is; it's existing players, the more devoted the better, the more dependant, the better.  The ideal SOE EQ player is a raider who raids as often as possible, and has years emotionally invested in his or her character(s).  These are the staple for the remaining life span of EQ, as EQ itself is not a good product for new players.  It's buggy, has 6+ years of content that is broken, so much so that the Dev's apparently do not know all that is broken or incomplete.  SOE has made the choice to market to the one audience it knows it can keep.  Those who are addicted to EQ.</p>

<p>The net result. Don't expect any radical changes.  Don't expect anything like sweeping fixes of long outstanding bugs, broken quests, missing NPCs, etc.</p>

<p>You can however expect an ever growing level of gear mudflation, level increases, and new mechanics designed to give the upper 2% of the player base ever more power.<br />

<p>golfertwo,</p>

<p>I can agree with your conclusions (in whole or part) without doing analysis or knowing the specifics of how you arrived at those conclusions.  Surely, you had to know that.  You just wanted to pick a fight with someone, and I took your bait.  My poking fun at your tool was a result of your blustering and trying to bulldoze me.  It didn't work, and it won't work, so give over.</p>

<p>I'm sure your tool is very nice, and I want to assure you that it is not the tool I question.  In my experience, I have learned that analysis is only as good as the data available and the biases and expertise of the people performing the analysis.  </p>

<p>I am specifically questioning your data collection process, being as the only ones who have accurate data are SOE, and to my knowledge they aren't distributing that data to anyone.  You claim to have a lot of data collected over five years.  What does "a lot of data" mean?  How did you collect that data?  Where is the repository?  How did you verify it's pedigree?  Please, don't tell me you are extrapolating from the one website we all know and love.  </p>

<p>What specific data, besides the fact that the game isn't sold by Wal-mart, did feed into your curve? You claim you observed the thinning out of the game over 7 years.  I find that hard to believe, since EQ was growing for most of the 7 years.  Where is the thinning?  POK?  Bazaar?  Your guild?  Crushbone?  </p>

<p>You really don't have to answer all of these questions.  I'm really not trying to attack you.  I'm just saying I don't trust your data or your analysis and don't agree with all your conclusions.  You are unlikely to convince me you are correct.  </p>

<p>You think the game is dieing.  I think it will be around for a few years.  One of us is right and the other is wrong.  Big whoop.  You could have left it at that after your first post.</p>

<p>So, what you actually said was...</p>

<p>You could have done this analysis, which you did not, and since the rest of us are too ignorant to comprehend the tools you might have used to prove your case, we should not dispute your claims.  That's an amazing stance, proof by absence of evidence.</p>

<p>Let me throw something into the works here. Everyone is assuming the EQ is digital Download only from now on. This may not be the case. I recently went to my local Sydney comp store and saw a nice new box compilation of Star wars Galaxies which I thought had died. None of the expansion for it have been avaliable for years in Australia. It may be the SOE does a similar release with EQ, The last box we saw down here was GoD.</p>

<p>I think they may still come out with boxed compilation packs every year or so but I think new expansions will likely be download only from now on.</p>

<p>To anyone trying to predict when EQ finally ends, the problem with making any real prediction is that you have to do so based on guesses about the future, and about the actions of a company you cannot really predict.  If, for example, SoE makes a sudden media compaign to draw new players into EQ, it might extend the lifespan quite a bit.</p>

<p>Also, if you look at MMO's older than EQ(UO for example) shows a potential for a very long lifespan.  We can suspect, based on UO, that the slow loss of players will peter out, and that EQ will at some point reach a somehwat level population.  If that population is high enough to be profitable, EQ could last for a very long time.</p>

<p>Simply put, there is too much we do not know to make any realistic predictions about how long EQ will be around.  If I had to guess, I would guess that we will soon hit a point where the population is pretty stable, and that EQ will be around for quite some time...but that is all it is, a guess.</p>

<p>More STUFF that makes no sense:</p>

<p>I explored Stone Hive .. a new, low level TSS zone tonight.  It's very beautiful. Interesting looking bumble bee mobs and plants.  Clever HIVE with nooks, cranies, a spiral staircase and an elevator. Lots of encounters that would be terrific fun for a small group.</p>

<p>AND completly empty.  </p>

<p>It's easy to get to from the Draakin city, but guess what.  Almost all the drops are lore/quest/no drop.  And since there are no merchants (unlike say LOIO which had a place to sell even if limited), ya gotta run back to the city every time your bags are full (think half an hour minimum here).</p>

<p>It's pitiful that SOE will put such care and creativity into a new zone and then make it so unattactive (from a loot/exp point) that no one will play there. There are some quests but I guess they are not enough to entice anyone.</p>

<p>GO FIGURE.</p>

<p>Just a FYI there is at lease one merchant in Stone Hive, the Enchanter spell merchant is in one of the mazes.</p>
