   <font class="ArticleText"><BIG>Night of the Living Patch</BIG><p><B>March 19th, 3:00 am<br>------------------------------<p>We wanted to start by letting everyone know how grateful we are for all of the suggestions for improvements that we've received both in EMail and on the various class and server boards.  We appreciate all the help you've provided us.<p>** Changes for Low Level Characters **<p>- Characters no longer lose experience for death below level 11<br>- Characters now begin first level with a stack of 20 food and drink<br>- Items no longer appear on a corpse if you are below level 10, they reappear with the character<br>- When a character &quot;dings&quot; level 10 you will be informed that your items will now be on your corpse<br>- Characters will no longer appear with a Tome of Discord. They must get one from the Priest of Discord<br>- New resurrection, evacuate and corpse summoning spells have been added at lower levels<br>- We've moved the newbie bind points closer to where characters first start out, not outside in their newbie areas<br>- Halflings and Gnomes have new classes available to them:  Halfling Rangers and Paladins as well as Gnome ShadowKnights and Paladins.  All of the necessary NPCs and items should be available for these new classes<p>** Alternate Advancement Abilities **<p>- Divine Stun is now an activated ability on a 30 second reuse timer with a chance to interrupt NPCs up to level 60<br>- Most targeting issues with Alternate Advancement abilities should be fixed<br>- Rampage should now consider all viable targets, including PvP targets<br>- Metabolism should be working properly now <br>- Scribble Notes should reduce memorization times to an even greater extent than it did before<p>** Spells/Songs **<p>- Fixed a bard lockup bug that would occur randomly with during cast time<br>- Fixed a song bug that was causing songs to be stuck on, triggered by contact proc buffs procs (such as Boon of the Garou)<br>- The new Cleric and Paladin Resurrection line of spells are now available on vendors<br>- The new corpse summoning spell is now available on vendors, as are the appropriate coffins<br>- The new Evacuate spells are now available on vendors<br>- Memory Blur, Mind Wipe, Blanket of Forgetfulness, Memory Flux, Glamour of Kintaz and Rapture have been given a greater chance of clearing the 'hate list'<br>- Glamour of Kintaz and Rapture also have longer durations<br>- Egress and Abscond have a reduced mana cost and a lesser chance to fizzle<br>- Judgement has been improved to make it a better upgrade from the previous spell in the spell line<br>- Shaman group buff spells (Tumultuous Strength and the Talisman spells - Cat, Brute, Rhino, and Raptor) have been improved to be more in line with the single target versions of those spells.<br>- Added a new line of spells for Magicians that summons focus items<br>- /pet get lost will now kill the buff as well as the familiar<br>- Marzin's Mark now stack with Protection of the Glades<br>- Improved the way that Abolish Disease/Poison and Counteract Disease/Poison work<br>- Fixed it so that whenever a player loses the chance to click on a resurrection dialogue box (such as entering the inventory screen), the game will react as if the user had clicked &quot;no&quot;.  This should prevent cases where the player can not be resurrected unless they logged out <br>- &quot;Sense&quot; spells should now work while on a horse<br>- Shield of Auras effect has had a stacking issue with Clarity fixed and the component removed<br>- Skin of Shadow has had its night only restriction removed<br>- Demi Lich is now a level 56 spell<br>- Arch Lich has been improved<br>- Translocate spells no longer require that the target be grouped with the caster.  Also, the dialog box for this spell will remain longer<br>- Added Sicken and Tainted Breath to a merchant in Shar Vahl<br>- Levitation spells now check to see if you have a second Levitation type spell when it wears off before hurling you to the ground<br>- Eye of Tallon has a longer duration<br>- Spell memorization speed should now take +Meditate% skill items into account <br>- Bard song memorization time should now be faster and is affected by attributes <p>** Zones **<p>- Changed safe spot in Kedge Keep to actually be a safe spot<br>- The Beastlord trainer in Firiona Vie is now more friendly to Beastlords of all types<br>- Vyzh`dra the Cursed has been adjusted to help balance the risk versus reward associated with the encounter<p>** Items **<p>- Sleeper's Tomb Key is now Soulbound<br>- Wand of Casual Blessings is not longer usable by Half-Elves, and is usable by Dark Elves and Gnomes.  It also now looks like a staff and not a bag<br>- Corrected some of the Velious quest helm graphics.  All helms of this type are no longer displaying a graphic (as intended) and the 'customized' plate helms should all now have graphics (also as intended)<br>- Custom Malevolent Crown should now be the same color as the rest of the armor set<br>- The Beastlord Epic item has been changed to be more in line with other epic items<br>- Grimling Tribal Headdress is now a &quot;head&quot; item and should be equippable<br>- Thexian Loop has had its Haste increased<br>- Headband of Many Visions now grants Deadeye instead of See Invisible<br>- Shield of the Swamp should now have a graphic<br>- Shield of Auras should now have a graphic<p>** Combat **<p>- Pets are now more likely to avoid NPC ripostes<br>- Wizards now have an inherent chance to score a critical blast with their damage spells after 11th level.  This ability does not lessen the chance of scoring a critical hit with Alternate Experience abilities that grant criticals<p>** Client/Interface **<p>- Added /dopropertinting command.  This command allows you to turn on and off the &quot;DoProperTinting&quot; option in the eqclient.ini file.  Activating this command should correct most tinting issues (such as armor tint also tinting the character's skin).  But if it causes issues you can toggle it off by using /dopropertinting off<br>- Added /chat commands, that allow players to create their own chat channels.  Please read the eqmanual_supplement.doc in your EverQuest directory for more information<br>- Added /hitsmode command.  This command allows you to more finely control how you see hits, including seeing them in a window other than your chat window.  Please see the eqmanual_supplement.doc for more details<br>- Added /clearhits to clear the current hits in the M2-M5 modes of the /hitsmode command.  Again, please see the eqmanual_supplement for more information<br>- Added /showgrass command.  This toggles the radial flora (Luclin only) on and off<br>- Added options in the Options screen (under Chat Filter) for filtering out Melee and Spell criticals.  Options are All/Me/Off.  These can also be activated using the /filter command, and will affect critical hit, critical blast, exceptional heal, and crippling blow messages<br>- Changed /filter to allow you to toggle the various chat filter settings (still also lets you toggle the badwords filter)<br>- Changed /channel to allow you to set your default chat channel. It also now saves this setting in the INI file<br>- Changed the /targetgroupbuff command to be 'persistent'.  The state of the switch will be stored in the eqclient.ini file and will be remembered when you log out or zone<br>- Fixed the double messages received when &quot;Soandso's song ends&quot;<br>- Mend should be working properly.  &quot;Can not use Mend for x seconds&quot; can still appear, but you now should be able to use mend at the appropriate time<br>- Fixed bug in the client that caused a &quot;You are out of Ammo message&quot; even when you still had ammo<br>- Messages should no longer be lost while you are zoning<br>- Corpses that are made to appear at the &quot;safe spot&quot; of a zone for any reason can now be moved using /corpse as long as the person using the command has /consent for that corpse<br>- Added &quot;AllLuclinPcModelsOff&quot; line to the eqclient.ini file which, if set to TRUE, will skip the loading of all of the Luclin PC models (except the Vah Shir, which always gets loaded no matter what this is set to).  This should allow players to set the loading of each race and sex individually for their normal game play, but then quickly turn all models off for a raid or other such circumstances<br>- Added /rtarget function (can be used as /rt).  This function targets the last character to send you a /tell.  It follows all of the rules for /target<br>- Messages sent to you while you are zoning should be saved and sent to you when you reach the other side of the zone.  Messages should no longer be lost while zoning (unless zoning takes more than about 10 minutes for any reason)<br>- You should be able to keep typing whatever you were in the middle of typing when you zoned... but it might not be processed till you're in the new zone<br>- If someone is on your ignore list and they do a /random, you shouldn't see it anymore<p>** Pathing **<p>- Corrected some pathing in Ak'Anon that was preventing some NPCs from reaching certain areas<br>- Corrected some pathing issues in Acrylia Caverns<br>- Corrected a problem with the entrance from Hollowshade Moor into Paludal Caverns that was preventing Beastlord Warders from entering the zone<p>** Miscellaneous **<p>- Many cases where characters would stab themselves with their weapons when sitting should have been eliminated <br>- Player characters no longer broadcast their location when they are stationary.  This should reduce the resources used and improve gameplay<br>- Fixed a problem that was causing some users to see blocky, unblended terrain where terrain types meet<br>- Critical hit messages from spells now take into account PvP damage calculations.  The actual damage was calculated correctly, it was just displaying wrong on the critical message<br>- Fixed canoes, they should move forward and backwards normally again<br>- We have been working to prevent characters from being stuck in the game after link death in such a way that prevents the player from logging back in.  Players should be able to log back in no more than 5 minutes after going link dead in all situations <br>- Added Sharvahl as a &quot;home zone&quot; for Vahshir when taking PvP racial faction hits into account <br>- We have fixed the ATI flashing problem that some players with certain cards were having when inventory window was up</B><p>Well, there you have it. Besides all the Test server changes we've been talking about the last few days, there were some unexpected goodies tossed into the mix. See the last few stories for detailed thoughts on most of this stuff, but we'll just say again briefly how cool most of these changes are.<p>The low-level game is now much improved, and the learning curve for new players will be much kinder. This is an area where competition has certainly inspired improvement. After all, which several alternative games in the marketplace (and more on the way), it becomes increasingly important to win gamers right off the bat and keep them coming back for more. Making the first ten levels a relative breeze should be enough time to get new folks hooked.<p>With the addition of radial flora and proper armor tinting, most of the promise of the Luclin engine has been realized. Yes, yes, there is still the Bazaar we are all waiting for, plus the new user interface. Once those hurdles are cleared, though, we'll finally have a very complete game.<p>&quot;Complete&quot; being a relative term, of course, because...<p><BIG>Move Over, Velious</BIG><p>Is the next EverQuest expansion about to be announced this Friday? Over at the Safehouse, <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=22881.topic">clues</a> are surfacing. Let's follow the trail of evidence, just like those folks on <I>C.S.I...</I><p>1. In the first <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/eqlive/indev.jsp">State of the Game</a> message, in the part that talks about upcoming high-level content, a hidden link turned up in the phrase &quot;begun a great task&quot; that leads to an interesting Web site called <a href="http://www.planesofpower.com/">Planes of Power</a>. Um, that's a cool picture.<p>2. Nathan Pearce, Director of Web Presence for SoE, <a href="http://www.deepfriedcomics.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3572">posted a photo</a> of his office, <I>supposedly</I> to show a /GU comic he put on his door. On one of the three monitors on his desk, Nathan was displaying a picture of the same guy from the Planes of Power site. When asked about it, he said &quot;You'll find out on Friday.&quot;<p>3. Some new <a href="http://www.keithparkinson.com/">Keith Parkinson</a> (the guy who does the box art for EQ) artwork is making the rounds. One <a href="http://www.keithparkinson.com/new/pics/POPcover_sm.jpg">picture</a> in particular catches the eye. Notice the name of the picture: it screams &quot;Planes of Power cover.&quot;<p>The evidence is pretty clear. This expansion, aimed at high-level folks, will center around a collection of new planes--culminating, perhaps, in the Plane of Power itself (Rallos Zek's stomping ground). Hey, we've been saying since Luclin came out that Verant pretty much <I>had</I> to do another expansion of high-end content.<p>You'll have to decide for yourself whether news on this expansion truly leaked out by accident, or whether the whole thing--including Pearce's office photo--was just one big setup cleverly designed to get us worked into a lather. If it really is the case, then kudos to Verant for being genuinely sneaky bastards.<p>Should Verant be working on another expansion when the last one still has so many--uh--lingering issues? Well, I'd expect the answer you would get from them is &quot;there are two entirely different teams handling those assignments.&quot; And honestly, high-level content is very much needed at this juncture in the game. So while the Luclin engine and vast amounts of old content are in need of tuning, the need for new loot to farm overpowers us all.<p>Let's toss around some numbers, just for the heck of it. Say the PoP expansion clocks in at 15 zones. Around half of these will be actually desirable/fun/have worthwhile drops, so let's say there's 7 really cool new zones. Ideally, these new zones should have enough content to keep even the uberest of uberguilds busy for a whole day or two--think NToV on steroids. Why should this be a goal? Because on servers that have 5-6 NToV-capable guilds already, zone rotations are a nightmare, and there is still plenty of racing for the good spawns. While some high-end Luclin encounters are nicely done, clearly that expansion was for the low- to mid-level player. The ubers need room to spread out and not get in each other's way, and hopefully PoP will accomplish that.<p>Just please, take it easy on the Ring of Fires this time around, give us a break on keyed zones, and don't make fights that are ridiculously unwinnable. Other than that, Verant, knock our socks off.<p>The clock is ticking closer to Friday...<p><BIG>Don't Horse Around with the GM</BIG><p>I have been getting e-mail after e-mail asking that we mention this story, so I'll finally relent. (The original link is <a href="http://www.conard.net/pictures/eq/banned/banned.htm">here</a>, by the way, though the site is currently exceeding its bandwidth limitations.)<p>It seems that during one of those recent melee matches in the Arena, a paladin named Hwedung used his holy steed and was <a href="http://pub63.ezboard.com/fbrellrantsfrm2.showMessage?topicID=3251.topic">threatened with a banning</a>. Turns out GM Kriggan, the person in charge of the whole thing, didn't have horse models on (and didn't know how fast the pally/SK horse is), which made him think that the pally had illegally modified his run speed. A huge debate ensued, and eventually Hwedung proved that he was right, even though the GM made the old &quot;well you might be right, but we aren't saying we believe you&quot; response.<p>Some people are making this out to be the worst example of GM abuse ever. Sorry, I've seen worse. Honestly, while the GM was clearly wrong and jumped to a stupid conclusion, it didn't really seem that malicious. Would I have been pissed if this had happened to me? Oh yeah. And I certainly can't blame Hwedung for being righteously angry and threatening to quit the game--I'd be tempted to do so in his shoes, too. But many of the people making such an uproar about this situation are just using it to advance their own agendas. Thanks, but we'll pass on that bandwagon.<p>Hopefully Kriggan makes amends, Hwedung doesn't quit, and everybody learns a lesson from this. You may now all flame me for taking Verant's side and/or not having the proper sympathy for abused players.<p><BIG>More Maps, Man</BIG><p>Muse over at <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com">EQ Atlas</a> has finished his collection of outdoor maps with <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/velious/westernwastes.html">Western Wastes</a>, <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/maidenseye.html">Maidens Eye</a>, and <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/umbralplains.html">Umbral Planes</a>. Nice job. Now get busy mapping the Planes of Power for us...</font>
