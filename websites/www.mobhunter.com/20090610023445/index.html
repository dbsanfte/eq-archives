					<p>I was recently interviewed for an <a title="Hamma time!" href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/69328" target="_blank">article on IP creation</a> by Cody at Ten Ton Hammer. Along with several other developers, I discuss the fun and challenges of building an IP from the ground up as opposed to licensing an existing property.</p>
<p>This was one of the better interviews I&#8217;ve done, in part because I could talk freely about this subject without detailing anything about the game I&#8217;m working on. Though it&#8217;s not as clear when one game is the sole face of an intellectual property, IP development is distinct from game development. The goal is to build something that can live across a number of mediums and feel like it was crafted solely for whatever incarnation you&#8217;re experiencing.</p>
<p>When it works, you don&#8217;t notice it. When it doesn&#8217;t, you&#8217;re left with a movie that doesn&#8217;t feel like the game, a game that doesn&#8217;t feel like the movie, a movie that doesn&#8217;t feel like the book, and so on. Examples of the latter are much more common than examples of the former.</p>

					<p>I recently bought the first season of Star Trek (The Original Series, of course) on Blu-Ray. It&#8217;s very cool, because you can switch between watching the episodes with the original special effects or the nicely redone versions they syndicated a couple years back. Unlike most revisions to classic shows, the updated effects took nothing away from the episodes and were handled very tastefully.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t buy a lot of series on DVD, but the original Trek is definitely worth the purchase. This spiffy set makes me wish another of my favorite science fiction shows would receive the same treatment: Babylon 5.</p>
<p>B5 is perhaps the best written show of its kind, groundbreaking in that it was plotted out as a complete story intended to run five seasons. Its themes and characters hold up exceptionally well, but its special effects look horribly dated. If it&#8217;s hard for me, a die-hard fan, to stomach the ancient Amiga-era CGI, it would no doubt be tough for a modern audience used to the glorious effects of Battlestar Galactica to get past them.</p>
<p>Releasing a remastered Blu-Ray and DVD of Babylon 5 with new CGI would allow the show to stand the test of time and catch on with a new audience. Is it likely to happen? Who knows. Though the show always struggled in the ratings, it has sold extremely well on DVD and prompted Warner Brothers to fund further TV movies and DVD projects (including a couple attempts at follow-up shows). In fact, Warners keeps flirting with the idea of a theatrical film, though it&#8217;s still uncertain as to whether it will happen. If B5 does make it to the big screen, reviving the franchise with a remastered DVD set would be a natural promotion for a movie.</p>
<p>So while I won&#8217;t hold my breath for B5 being revamped, I can look forward to seasons 2 and 3 (yes, even 3) of Trek to grace my LCD screen. And that&#8217;s not a bad thing at all.</p>

					<p>I get emotional over Star Trek.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, our fuzzy old TV could catch about six stations: the three networks, PBS, a local independent, and maybe a UHF channel or two. Although the local station ran blocks of monster/horror movies on the weekends, there wasn&#8217;t much else on the airwaves for a skinny nerd to call his own.</p>
<p>The glorious exception was reruns of Trek&#8211;The Original Series, which at the time was The Only Series. I devoured those episodes, watching them again and again. I cried every time Captain Kirk had to let Edith die in order to save the timeline, and cheered every time he beat the Gorn. Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, and all the rest were a lifeline to me. No other fictional world before or since has had such a profound impact on my life, shaping my imagination and giving me an ideal to strive for.</p>
<p>When I was older I embraced the movies, TNG, DS9, and to a lesser extent the other shows. Though there was plenty of mediocre moments in those hundreds of hours of Trek, there were also some profoundly moving experiences. No matter how many times I&#8217;ve seen The Wrath of Khan, those scenes between Kirk and Spock leave me a blubbering mess. Shatner&#8217;s acting takes plenty of well-deserved knocks, but when he chokes on his words as he eulogizes Spock, I think it&#8217;s one of the most touching moments on film.</p>
<p>So when I heard plans to relaunch the franchise with a new cast taking on the classic roles of the original Trek, I was more than skeptical.</p>
<p>Happily, my fears were put to rest in the first five minutes of the film. It&#8217;s wonderful; go see it. It&#8217;s not just a great Trek film (possibly&#8230; <em>possibly</em>&#8230; the best of them all), it&#8217;s a great movie. I loved it.</p>

					<p>Cuppy raises what she assumes will be controversial questions about game design bloggers: <strong><a title="Oh no you di'n't!" href="http://www.cuppycake.org/?p=729" target="_blank">Do they know what they&#8217;re talking about? Are they even good designers?</a></strong></p>
<p>Where&#8217;s the controversy? The answer to both questions is <strong>&#8220;Play it safe and assume not.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Which makes you wonder whether I know what I&#8217;m talking about or if I&#8217;m a good designer. And the answer to this question is that <strong>you have no way of knowing</strong>. But we&#8217;ll get to that in a minute.</p>
<p>To Cuppy&#8217;s first point, I think the proof that game designer blogs lack relevance is that 100% of them could vanish from the Internet today and the actual practice of game design would not change one bit. <strong>Not one iota!</strong></p>
<p>In case you don&#8217;t believe me and would rather hear from someone more famous who makes games and blogs, <a title="You just knew he would" href="http://www.cuppycake.org/?p=729#comment-8563230" target="_blank">Raph responded</a> with the following observations:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. There didn&#8217;t use to be so many professional designers blogging. It&#8217;s a relatively recent phenomenon.<br />
2. Even today, most designers DON&#8217;T think in terms of design theory, psychology, emotions, etc. It&#8217;s even more recent than blogging.<br />
3. There are a lot of designers who make good games of a given sort, but can&#8217;t make great ones.<br />
4. There are a lot of designers who make good games of a given sort, but it&#8217;s the only sort they can make.<br />
5. There are a lot of designers who can talk about theory but can&#8217;t develop new theory.<br />
6. There are a lot of designers who talk about theory but can&#8217;t apply it.<br />
7. There are a lot of great designers who don&#8217;t know how to express what they do.<br />
8. There are a lot of good academics and yes, other designers, who can express what great designers do in language that others can understand.<br />
9. There are a lot of really terrible game design blogs. But there are also lots of really good ones. A lot of the good ones are not by &#8220;professional game designers.&#8221;<br />
10. Often, because of points 3-8, it can be very hard to tell a good game design blog from a bad one.<br />
11. Experience is often worth listening to, even when it&#8217;s wrong.</p>
<p>By the way, I can&#8217;t think of very many truly &#8220;famous&#8221; game designers in game design circles who DO blog.</p></blockquote>
<p>All of those points have truth to them, but that last line is perhaps the most telling. There is something to be said for the old chestnut that if you are good at what you do, you don&#8217;t need to <em>tell </em>people that you&#8217;re good at what you do. That is to say, good designers just shut up and let their work do the talking.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s get back to Cuppy&#8217;s second question and my response to it. For the most part, you have no way of judging whether or not I know what the hell I&#8217;m talking about for a couple reasons. One is that <strong>talking about theory is one thing, but implementation is quite another</strong>. That&#8217;s why incredibly smart and articulate people can fail at actually having to make games, and why some people are more famous for what they say than for actually producing quality work. It&#8217;s also a reason why many players can write blogs that are every bit as thoughtful and compelling as people in the industry&#8211;because blogging doesn&#8217;t have the accountability of meeting deadlines and budgets.</p>
<p>Another reason is that, despite the many articles I&#8217;ve written and all the interviews I&#8217;ve given, <strong>you probably don&#8217;t </strong><strong>actually </strong><strong>know what I do for a living</strong>. Nor are you likely to know what specific content or systems any game designer who blogs has actually created. You know what projects we have been attached to and can read the credits to see what titles we were given, but those things tell you almost nothing about what we actually did and whether or not it sucked.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t just make it hard to know which blogs to trust, but also to tell whether someone&#8217;s resume is worth the paper it&#8217;s printed on. There are an awful lot of terrible designers out there with game credits on their resumes who hurt the projects they worked on far more than they helped them. And these kinds of folks are sometimes willing to take credit for good work that they didn&#8217;t even do in order to land a job.</p>
<p>So unless you can point to exactly which zones a designer mapped, which quests he implemented, which dungeon he populated, which dialogue he wrote, which raid he itemized, or other specific details, you&#8217;re pretty much guessing if he&#8217;s just a good salesman or if he actually knows what he&#8217;s doing.</p>
<p>Despite all this, I do believe there is value (even sheer entertainment) in reading blogs of people making games. Just don&#8217;t take their theories for granted&#8211;pay attention to what happens when they actually have to deliver the goods.</p>
<p>Except for this blog, of course, which you can trust implicitly. But you knew that already!</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>There&#8217;s a pretty good <a title="Ten tons seems excessive" href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/66885" target="_blank">article over on Ten Ton Hammer</a> offering a look at the current state of beta testing. As many others have noted, not much testing goes on in the public stages of MMO betas, and the article offers a variety of perspectives from both developers and players.</p>
<p>My old comrade Scott Hartsman chimes in with a voluminous set of observations (without me around to edit him, Scott will just talk forever!) on how a big-budget game can manage to make it into beta and be lacking in the fun department:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re a AAA game with 3-4 years of time and money invested, enough  money to support a large team having worked on it for that long.  Games like  this frequently need to go for years before enough pieces come together before  you can start making decisions about what&#8217;s fun and what isn&#8217;t.</em></p>
<p><em>By the  time beta begins, you&#8217;ve made decision after decision that have compounded on  each other.  Your assumptions&#8217; assumptions&#8217; have assumptions about what your  game is.  The whole product, systems, content, operations, marketing, PR,  community ramp, you name it &#8212; is built upon them.  Changing core assumptions  about the product itself is unlikely to be possible without significant delays,  costing progressively more money per month.  (Remember, the months toward the  end of the dev cycle are the most expensive ones by far.)</em></p>
<p><em>The game is,  for the most part, what it is.  You&#8217;re capable of making shifts, but the more  complex the game, the more minor the shifts you can make with any confidence.   If assumptions that you made years ago turn out to be wrong, you&#8217;re left to  scramble, or in most cases, do your best to ameliorate the now-certain  fallout.</em></p>
<p><em>If you haven&#8217;t verified your gameplay at the point of having a  beta, you&#8217;ve already left your fate to chance.  (This is, of course, all  presuming that your game has passed the technical bar in terms of stability,  which is all too often not the case.  And, again, is another flaw with the  launch-big-or-die model.)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The guy from <a title="Knock knock, it's the lawyers from Uglydolls" href="http://www.ohai.com/" target="_blank">ohai</a> speaks true. If you start out with mediocre core gameplay and pile tons of mediocre decisions on top of it, soon you&#8217;ll find yourself in a plate of spaghetti and weaksauce you won&#8217;t be able to escape (how&#8217;s that for mixing metaphors?). For instance, if the act of killing enemies over and over is the centerpiece of your gameplay, then you better make damn sure basic combat feels interesting and cool because otherwise nothing will be able to detract attention from the suckiness.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, I recently had a happy beta experience and felt I should share. I installed the Chinese open beta for <a title="Tower? I hope there's a mage in it" href="http://www.aiononline.com/us/" target="_blank">Aion</a> after finding instructions on how to apply an English-language patch. Considering the hoops jumped through to get the client running in English, I expected a train wreck and was hoping I could at least get a feel for the visuals and gameplay. Instead, I found myself pleasantly surprised that the language stuff worked and the game played smoothly. Though the experience wasn&#8217;t perfect, there was a thoughtful layer of polish to the UI and other elements of the game that I found refreshing. After not expecting much more than a grindfest, I&#8217;m now looking forward to the US version.</p>
<p>So beta&#8211;or live preview, or whatever you choose to call it&#8211;still has the potential to positively influence the market toward your game, so long as you when you lift your skirt what you reveal to the world is solid (ugh, that metaphor is simply uncomfortable).</p>
<p>Look, every shipped triple-A MMO is going to have bugs. These games simply have too many systems and too much content to test every possible use case before launch, and everyone from Blizzard on down spends the first few months after a major release fixing things. And players will accept that, as long as you&#8217;re up front about the issues and the core gameplay experience is rich and enjoyable enough to mitigate the bugs until they&#8217;re stomped out.</p>
<p>But public perception based on that first public showing has a measurable impact on your game&#8217;s ultimate fate.  Now more than ever, major signs of weakness are going to haunt your sales potential for eternity, and even the greatest patches can only do so much to fix that lingering initial perception.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Have you ever actually browsed your junk email folder? Sure, there&#8217;s nasty virus-laden stuff you need to watch out for, but some spammers are including a wealth of inspired writing in their messages that a student of modern poetry can&#8217;t help but find captivating.</p>
<p>Check out this gem, found in a message entitled &#8220;Restore your organs ability and productivity now&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>but let me tell you thats not how it will really go i imagine most kids will want to stay home and play computer games but their moms will make them come and so theyll grudgingly put on a some church pants and skirts so i was wondering if you could help me know how to bring the romance back into our modern life its not really that important no matter the dress or the menu we just want the kids to come to feel the spirit of the temple but its like you said anne when you dont use your imagination to make life beautiful how much you miss what an adventure it is</p></blockquote>
<p>Marvelous! This passage has a stream-of-consciousness quality to it that I admire. I knew many would-be poets at university who had no hope of matching such majesty.</p>
<p>Later in the same email, the author shifts focus to a new subject framed in the context of modern life:</p>
<blockquote><p>breakfast i always have two eggs and salsa always i dont really get sick of it and it would really stink if i did because theres not a lot out there for breakfast actually when you are at your ideal weight and ovulating regularly you can have any kind of whole grain hot cereal without a problem you know steel cut oats etc i am not quite there yet berries and grapes are pretty low on the glycemic index and i have those too oh and i love cottage cheese with fruit grant and i listened and danced to his music on valentines day</p></blockquote>
<p>Fascinating! As an audience, we are enthralled by the narrator&#8217;s candor on her eating and ovulation habits. Yet it is the hint of romance at the end of the passage which truly captivates us, leaving us to wonder as to the identity of &#8220;grant&#8221; and the mysterious composer of the music to which our protagonist danced.</p>
<p>This modern epic draws to a close with yet another slice-of-life observation:</p>
<blockquote><p>do you have to be obsessed with yarn and needles and hooks like i am to think that is the most inviting little space youve ever seen when cate is too scared to go downstairs penny will go with her and everything is all right she lets cate dress her up for weddings or try to ride her or pull her by the tail almost daily and even knowing the torture she will soon endure she gets so excited when cate gets home from school</p></blockquote>
<p>Using yarn and needles as metaphors for our fear of institutions such as weddings and school is beyond brilliant. You&#8217;d be hard-pressed to find social commentary of this caliber among today&#8217;s published so-called poets.</p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;ll realize that a wealth of reading wonder awaits in your junk folder. It is perhaps the ultimate irony that beauty and thought of this quality is being relegated to the trash bins of modern culture. The future of our society is alive and well, not within the cold walls of the classroom, but inside the nurturing womb of the spam filter.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Lum posted articles about two GDC talks, one by <a title="A force of nature" href="http://www.brokentoys.org/2009/03/26/barnett-does-gdc-gdc-survives-the-experience/" target="_blank">Mythic&#8217;s Paul Barnett</a> and the other by <a title="He really did write the worst quest ever" href="http://www.brokentoys.org/2009/03/27/jeff-kaplan-does-gdc-explains-how-not-to-write-quests/" target="_blank">Blizzard&#8217;s Jeff Kaplan</a>. While the articles themselves are interesting, I found the comments sections even more enlightening.</p>
<p>In the former, you have a number of commenters saying what a blowhard Paul is, some of them implying that WAR&#8217;s subscriber numbers are an indicator that Mr. B doesn&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s talking about.</p>
<p>In the latter, you have a number of commenters saying what a blowhard Jeff is, some of them implying that despite WoW&#8217;s success it&#8217;s clear that Mr. K doesn&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s talking about.</p>
<p>Which to me is yet another amusing example of Why Devs Can&#8217;t Possibly Win. Because if you fall below some community-perceived bar of success then you are a clueless failure, and if you&#8217;re above that bar you&#8217;re out of touch and too afraid of losing profit to innovate.</p>
<p>Despite the occasional exaggeration or bluster, neither of these guys is trying to put himself atop a mountain proclaiming he has the answer to the mysteries of the universe. Ultimately, they state their opinions and observations in public forums because people ask them to. As attending or reading such presentations is an entirely optional undertaking, I find it odd that some folks seem to get angry that these guys are even allowed to speak.</p>
<p>From the <a title="Raph will think it's funny I call him mighty" href="http://www.raphkoster.com/" target="_blank">mighty</a> <a title="I could also have said &quot;blowhards&quot;" href="http://terranova.blogs.com/" target="_blank">intellectuals</a> to the <a title="The lowest of the low" href="http://www.mobhunter.com/" target="_blank">lowly bloggers</a>, we&#8217;re all just trying to inspire discussion about what works and what doesn&#8217;t so that those of us lucky enough to work in the industry can keep doing this for a living and hopefully get better at our craft. If there&#8217;s any value to be had in GDC and its ilk, it&#8217;s that. Sometimes you just have to look past a lot of bullshit to find it.</p>
