<h2>Comments: November News Roundup</h2>

<p>New gate spells for all caster/priests? Yep great, it costs a mage plat to make a tailsman of return at 62? and you want a 20th level spell to replace it for all classes? </p>

<p>While i agree that some type of resonable gate for any class should be in game, dont you think that would be a bit of F-You to mages that had to wait till 62 to get the ability (not even going to talk about the cost).</p>

<p>Just my annoying Gnome 2 coppers</p>

<p>Cross Game chat is nice, I wonder how it will affect the migration to EQ2 since people will be able to still be in touch without needing to change game to do so.<br />
As some people (that can't be accused to be one-sided fanatic raiders) have pointed out on a previous thread, single-group hunters may be harshly impacted due to the lack of guild to rely on for grouping when the on-line population drops. </p>

<p>The class distribution for the holy trinity is not perfect at all times by a large margin. The less people around, the less chances to cover tanking, healing, support for pick-up groups. Even if better loot could be achievable by those who still play it won't make up for the lack of population as far as one could tell.</p>

<p>About "It is also a good time to open your doors a little bit and let some typical non-raiders into your raids."<br />
This pretty much sound like a contradiction. </p>

<p>Non raiders aren't for a reason: Either they don't have the time or they don't enjoy it. In both cases it doesn't make much sense to forcefeed single-group hunters that play 90 minutes chunks into organizations that raid 4 to 6 hours a day. <br />
After getting twinked and flagged, they may very well quit or get bored or do whatever else they enjoy doing but certainly not raiding on the long run.<br />
This isn't about guilds being too selective on recruit material but the lack of time investment or interest from a part of the playerbase. Not all aspects of the game appeal in the same way to everyone. By now, we should be pretty much be aware of that.<br />
What can happen is that guild may accept less geared, less flagged, less skilled players that may catch up more easily with the new flagging quests that are to be put in. It's in fact quite a pity that it isn't ready yet. It may be too late for some and the worst period is now, not in a month when people may be already gone to EQ2 or WoW.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Teremar at November 11, 2004 12:43 PM</strong></p>
<p>Redcloud is right--my emphatically non-raiding guild is down to about one third the numbers we would normally have had online a couple of weeks ago. We never were a big guild, and for the last couple nights we haven't even been able to put together a "standard" group most of the time. And yes, it's frustrating.</p>

<p>We lost a few people to EQ2, but I think it's the WoW open beta that's really killing us right now. If people end up liking it our guild may be in serious trouble.</p>

<p>We'll see--I finished the download this morning.</p>

<p>Loral's comment on opening the doors to non-raiders isn't totally off-base. I enjoy an occasional raid, say every week or two, and if I'm free to do it of course. So if I got a tell from someone in a raiding guild asking if I wanted to tag along on something there's a good chance I'd accept. Whether that would really benefit the raiding guild is another matter.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by <a target="_blank" title="http://claws.guildportal.com" href="http://mobhunter.com/mt/mobhunter_post21.cgi?__mode=red;id=717">Talaen</a> at November 11, 2004 01:02 PM</strong></p>
<p>Redcloud hit the nail on the head, I think.  Guilds that raid now won't get any benefit from guilding true non-raiders.</p>

<p>Like I said in my comments on the previous article, I think it's going to hit the mid-range raiding guilds worst of all.  The high-end guilds either have the numbers or the passion to still be able to do it.  Sure, things are going to be bumpy, but they'll continue - recruit to replace those they lost, and go on.  Since a lot of players aspire to join these guilds, they won't really have to accept "lesser" quality players - they might just have to do a little more backflagging.</p>

<p>The problem is that the folks in the middle - or the raiding guilds that aren't high-end yet - are going to be hit from both sides.  They're losing people to other games, and they're also going to be losing people to the high-end guilds.  That's why I predict that quite a few of them will end up merging in order to survive, or folding entirely.</p>

<p>Omens is still too new to break the perception that flagged raids, and the gear they drop, are required for raiding guilds.  Until people stop evaluating encounters in terms of whether they require "elemental" gear or not, the majority of players are going to still feel that they have to raid high-end PoP.  So I don't think we'll see people shrugging these raids off anytime soon, even if there is at least a slight chance for alternative gear now.  It will probably be at least another two expansions before flagged raiding becomes a niche again, like it was before PoP.</p>

<p>The single-group folks are hit the worst by EQ2.  Again Redcloud hit the nail on the head - it doesn't matter how many rangers, druids, mages, wizards, rogues, and so on are still in EQ1 looking for single groups for whatever reason.  They can't do much of anything if they don't have the clerics, tanks, and slowers there to back them up.  The imbalance of population between "required" classes vs. "dps" classes has always been the bane of the single-group player, especially those without a guild or large group of friends to fall back on.</p>

<p>Loral, I'm really surprised that you haven't mentioned anything that's on test in this article, as there are several things there, like the new /autofire command, which are going to affect the game for many people.  As you're fond of pointing out, the game isn't all about raiding, and people would probably like to know about core gameplay changes and content additions.  If the problem is simply the time it takes to gather information (you have a real job and a life like eveyrone else), perhaps you might want to look into a couple of additional writers for this site to improve coverage.</p>

<p>I'll withhold judgement on the new spells until we know what they really are, but it seems a silly way to implement a gate ability across the board.  Why not just make it an all-class discipline/skill, it would be easier.  Everyone has access to that interface.</p>

<p>On CastersRealm, I'm happy to see more activity around the site and I'm glad Gemdiver is working on getting the spell lists and such back up to date.  However, I'm find the articles/news that's getting posted to be relatively useless to me.  Nothing against the writers, but most of the things that are posted seem more based in opinion than fact, and many of them don't go into near enough detail IMO.  I'd rather see fewer postings and have the ones that do go up be more meaningful and detailed.</p>

<p>I read through the raid guide and it's helpful, but it seems more like a summary of "best practices" than an actual guide.  I think it will help new raid leaders out somewhat though.  For comparison, here is a document that I originally wrote 4 years ago.  Parts of it got reposted in quite a few places, including on EQDruids.com for a while.</p>

<p>http://www.guildportal.com/ContentControls/Support/InfoSectionViewer.aspx?GuildID=13279&GuildInfoSectionID=14400</p>

<p>It says most of the same things, but from a raid member perspective.  There's a companion document on the site for raid leaders.  There used to be a third document that covered detailed strategies like CH/Rune loops, etc., but I pulled that because they change so often.  I try to update the docs every six months or so - they're actually due for an update now.</p>

<p>"If I had to guess, and it is probably wishful thinking on my part, I would say they could summon a single-charge, no-rent gate device usable by typical non-gaters. If it isn't, well, it should be."</p>

<p>Are you kidding me?  There are already so many alternate port options out there, another one is completely unnecessary.</p>

<p>Not to mention it steps on the toes of Mages who already summon a 1-shot gate talisman anyways<br />

<p>Loral never said to GUILD the non-raiders into a raiding guild.  That would indeed be silly. As was pointed out earlier, they are non-raiders for a reason.</p>

<p>However, there is no reason that you couldn't invite a non-raider along on a raid.  If your raiding guild wants to do some content but you find yourselves short on some critical class (or even just short on raw numbers), maybe you could invite some "non-raider" guests along.</p>

<p>Now, of course there will be things to keep in mind.  Non-raiders may be considerably underequipped compared to your guild members. I say "may" because frankly there are many opportunities for non-raiders to acquire quite good equipment nowadays, and even in an uber raiding guild you have new players and underquipped folks.  Nevertheless, a guest is likely to require more heals during an AE mob, for example.  </p>

<p>Also, you have to be very clear about loot rules.  If it is a flagging raid then that would seem to be sufficient reward, but make it clear to your guest what the rules are.  In fact, you should make sure that there is someone keeping the guest informed about all goings on (who to ask for buffs, when you need to shrink, when to move), since many times orders are given in a private channel or even in guild.</p>

<p>It can be more trouble than it is worth, but it is also a good way to meet people, maybe even recruit some into your guild.  And at the very least you now have a chance to do some event that you didn't have the numbers for.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by <a target="_blank" title="http://claws.guildportal.com" href="http://mobhunter.com/mt/mobhunter_post21.cgi?__mode=red;id=720">Talaen</a> at November 11, 2004 03:10 PM</strong></p>
<p>Quesci,</p>

<p>Very good point about how to bring "pickups" along on your raids without incident.  We do this all the time to fill out our raiding parties for low-end stuff, and it's very true that explaining loot rules up front, and then making sure that the pickup folks know exactly what's going on, helps quite a bit.</p>

<p>Normally what I try to do is put any pickups I have with an experienced group leader.  That's not always possible, but it's the goal.</p>

<p>Now my problem with your statement.  MOST raiding guilds I know really don't like taking pickups - especially higher-end ones.  I can understand why too.  The efficiency of a raiding party is determined more by how well they mesh together than by anyone's individual stats.  The minute you start taking pickups, you've probably just dropped your raid's efficiency by half, because you have to stop more often to explain things, to heal, to rebuff, or whatever.  Now instead of having a group that's fought together and knows how to react, you have at least a portion of your raid which is more or less an unruly mob.</p>

<p>A lot of folks in raiding guilds are there because they want to raid efficiently - they want to get in, get the job done, and get out with the loot, flags, etc.  This lets them not only take on bigger and harder things, it also keeps them from having to spend 8 hours on a raid that should only have taken 3.</p>

<p>Every so often a raid leader comes around who really does a good job with pickup raids, but they are few and far between in my experience.  The Nameless, as old as it is, has maybe only had about a dozen in all the years I've been raiding there.  And doing pickups all the time is such a high-stress proposition that most of them burn out on it after a while.</p>

<p>Which server are you playing on loral? I was hoping to get as many of the old players together on an. Bayle so I could actually interact with them.</p>

<p>I'm nostalgic for the maker of www.eqatlas.com though. He did great work and his site really pulled me into the game. I guess people come and go. Sites like this one and http://www.eqtraders.com/ really make the everquest community more than a slashfest with added chatroom (tm).</p>

<p>I'm still waiting for my eq2 to be delivered (argh). In the meantime, did you notice they'd increased the droprate on spiderling silks? I dunno, I leave the game, and they finally fix something that had bugged me ever since they introduced the newbie armour quests and the droprate had changed (presumably to allow for the newbie ingredients).</p>

<p>I just hope they don't re-work the epics using flagging so that someone can solo them if they are persistent enough. That would just be rubbing it in ;-)</p>

<p>The unofficial EQ2 ANZAC server is Najena for those who wish to know. For ANZAC players server chat is ANZAC channel.</p>

<p>My Guild has had to abandon some raid nights due to WoW and EQ2 betas. We are down to half attendance but are keeping numbers from really crashing by absorbing other off peak players from other servers and collapsed Guilds on our server.</p>

<p>Players are getting on and logging soon afterwards due to no slower/tank/healer LFG in guild or elsewhere. Having 4-5 DPS looking for a critical class isnt uncommon. </p>

<p>There's one thing missing in Omens. Contrary to many previous expansion, there isn't a new armor set per class for groupers or raiders. SoE didn't foster nor provided the hype and interest that those armor created in the previous expansions. I think it lacks very much in that department since it doesn't set new goals for both populations within the game.</p>

<p>If anything, Omens has just new gear with bloated stats. There is an Omens armor but by far not in the shape nor form of ornate or EP armor the way we knew it and that alone detracts a lot to the activity around any new expansion. I hope that SoE will learn from it and think of that for the next one.</p>

<p>It's not against the principle of questing the armor as it is done in Omens but just that it isn't an entire viable path for guilds or groupers which in turn still doesn't rid them entirely of the necessity of older flags, like Time or Qvic. PoF/PoH, Kunark, Velious and POP did so, LDON to a lesser extent, GoD failed to do for many, Omens isn't quite there yet either.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Quesci at November 12, 2004 11:51 AM</strong></p>
<p>Redcloud,</p>

<p>There are two tiers of quested armor sets for each class.  There is information about them here:</p>

<p>The current level 62 magician spell for producing a gate talisman was so poorly made an implementation as to boggle the imagination.  Summoning a no rent item that has one charge and still requires a alchemy-produced reagent that costs almost as much as a single dose alchemy made gate potion made no sense.  Why bother with two inventory slots on a no rent item when one could just use a marginally more expensive gate potion readily purchased in the bazaar with up to 10 doses for a single slot and none of the no-rent worries?</p>

<p>Honestly I hope this does go in, the ability to get to and from places of adventure and safe places to camp (bank/sell/bind/train, etc.) is excessive, particularly when combined with the ineffectiveness of invisibility and/or levitate in certain zones.  But if it does go in the gate talisman conjured item needs to lose its reagent and quite possibly come in more options.</p>

<p>What I would like to see (or would have loved as an alternative to the Plane of Knowledge), was something like the wayfarer camps seeded throughout expansions/continents that provided places to bind, buy, sell, and bank.  Add in a "for hire" translocator who would charge for the convenience provided (and make a handy cash sink) and you've got a nice way for adventurers to stay in the field longer and warrant travelling farther away from central commerce points.</p>

<p>Perhaps the gnomish pirates establish a base of operations in the West Wastes of Velious for instance.  Along with them came a gnomish wizard with an eye towards making a bit of coin by providing binding and translocating services.  The pirate base attracts a couple of shady merchants, and if not a bank perhaps a "money changer" who for a fee will turn low value coins into higher denominations.</p>

<p>Adventurers would have everything they need to support a longer time in the field.  Access to binding, vendors, a bank/moneychanger to deal with excessive amounts of lower value coins, and even a way to and from.  One might even see Dragon Necropolis used as a dungeon and place for adventure. ;)</p>

<p>Yes, Redcloud, I made the same mistake in not thinking there were class armors.  There are two tiers of class armor, one for non-raiders and one for raiders.  Five of the seven pieces of the non-raider armor can be won in single-group hunts.  The stats are elemental quality with focus 5 effects.  The greaves and breastplate pieces of these armors come from 18 person "events" (SOE's term for smaller raids).  This set of armor is meant to be like the Kunark and Velious armor sets.</p>

<p>The raid armor is an upgrade of Qvic armor with around 250 to 300 hitpoints and mana and some very nice effects.  This armor comes from Anguish, I believe.</p>

<p>The hardest part about this armor is even getting the faction to get it.  You need Dragorn Loyalist faction which requires the killing of many thousands of Muramites.</p>

<p>I got limited confirmation that the level 20 spell is NOT a gate-type potion.  That was a real shot in the dark for me, but I still don't know what it is.  I plan to log into the test server tonight to find out.  I have a feeling it will be pretty mundane.</p>

<p>Ok it was mentioned that the non raiding guilds might be hit hardest.  I do not see it that way. I am leader of one, our membership has increase by at least 6 mains in the last 2 weeks.  Most of the people in our guild are sticking around for one or more of the following reasons:</p>

<p>1. their computer equipment can not play the new games</p>

<p>2. they have spent so much time on their characters, they do not want to give them up</p>

<p>3. they know that they will get groups easly if they stay in the guild where their friends are</p>

<p>4. they are hoping that zones will finally be clear enough to enjoy, when a lot of other people leave.</p>

<p>Yes when some of us log on, we get "tells" asking either to join them or join us.  Usually we have a full group of guildies with in half an hour of logging on, if not then non guildie friends but that has always been the way and it has not changed.  </p>

<p>I have also heard the rumor that serveral higher, not highest, raiding guilds are going over to a paticular server on EQ2 in force, in hopes of taking over the controlling spots on that server.  Just like when guilds move from one server to a new server hoping to be top dawg on that server.  <br />
 <br />
I am looking forward to see what EQ1 will be like in a couple months.</p>

<p>Ahhhh I have room to stretch</p>

<p>More News that somehow got missed:</p>

<p>The top two remaining raiding Guilds (Township Rebellion and Precision Strike) on Stormhammer have decided to leave the Legends Service.</p>

<p>Loral, any chance you might be able to write an article on the Legends Service and what might be planned for the future? I'm guessing that SOE's response might help indicate what kind of future staffing is planned for the EQ1 game as a whole for the next few months.<br />

<p>If you are looking for unbiased, objective news about EverQuest then you have come to the wrong place. Mobhunter may as well be owned by SOE as it's nothing more then another fluff site with propaganda "everthing's fine(tm)" type news. As long as the news is beneficial to SOE and EverQuest it is fit for Loral to post here.</p>

<p>SOE is now in the process of basically buying the influence of most of the major EQ and class related sites with all expense paid trips to Fan Faire and god knows what else. I exposed this questionable practice on the Druid's Grove with a post I made:</p>

<p>http://thedruidsgrove.org/forums/showthread.php?t=10127</p>

<p>Further examples of SOE controlling content on so-called other EQ news sites like the Vault is also discussed in detail at Gezak's website:</p>

<p>The number of websites where you can find honest news about EQ that is not controlled by someone that feels beholden to SOE has dwindled. For the record I'd like to know if SOE paid for any of your expenses Loral for the Fan Faire and I'd like to know if you attended the VIP only lunch with the EQ Devs in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mobhunter used to be a great website with fascinating news articles and opinion. Now it's just another propaganda outlet for SOE. Notice that the first postive review for Omens of War came from this website and was promptly touted by SOE on their "news". Loral bless his heart obviously loves EQ will like a brave captain go down with his ship. </p>

<p>I cancelled my 2 EQ accounts last week as my guild has moved lock stock and barrel to World of Warcraft. I wash my hands of the continuing debacle that is EverQuest and the callous, inept conduct of a company like SOE.<br />

Farewell Norrath!</p>

<p>SOE waived my fan faire registration fee and paid for a room.  I paid for the flight (which came out to quite a bit more).  Different community reps had different pieces paid for.  No one that I know of got paid to come out there.  Our gifty bag didn't come with solid gold Everquest tie-pins; we got the same gift bags that everyone at the fan faire got.  I did not attend a Summit only lunch but I did have a few opportunities to sit with Brenlo and the devs to talk about the game.</p>

<p>Mobhunter is a free site with no advertisement.  I write for free and Kohath hosts the site for free as they did with Moorgard.</p>

<p>Mobhunter isn't a news site, it's an editorial site.  That's the way it was with Moorgard and the way it was for Coray.  The articles always slanted to the opinions of the writer.  No where have I ever claimed to be an objective writer.  I try to keep my focus wide and cover topics that matter to the largest amount of the Everquest community, but I am obviously far from objective.</p>

<p>I love Everquest.  If I didn't, I wouldn't write an article a week for it.  I wouldn't have written over fifty chapters of bad fan fiction. I wouldn't have 340 hours of played time.  I feel sorry for people who spent  all of this time playing and then leave having hated the game.  Time is the only commodity we can never get back and there is no greater loss than to waste it on something we don't enjoy.</p>

<p>I am not trying to get a job with SOE and I'm not doing this for a free t-shirt and keyboard.  I do this because Everquest gave me a great source of entertainment and friendship for the last five years and I want to help it continue to do so.</p>

<p>I read your thread over on the Druid's Grove, Wolfshead, and I read back through some of your other postings.  It saddened me to see that while you often had some great thoughts and positive feedback, you instead chose to make something out of nothing simply to get attention.  I hope WoW gives you what you seek.</p>
