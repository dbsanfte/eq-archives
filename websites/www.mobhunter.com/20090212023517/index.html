					<p>I&#8217;m back from NYCC and had a great time. The panel on 38 Studios went well, even though there have been a few complaints about us not talking about the game&#8211;this despite the <em>very first slide</em> and the panel intro making extremely clear that <em>we would not be talking about the game</em>. Most people attending understood what we were trying to accomplish, and our discussion of studio process and answers to the fan questions actually hinted at quite a lot of what we&#8217;re doing, if you knew what to listen for.</p>
<p>NYCC is great. It is smaller than the San Diego version, but in a good way. The crowds are still huge but you can actually make your way down the aisles reasonably well and interesting things can stand out rather than get lost in the crowd. I would recommend the show to everyone, but then NYCC will keep growing in size and soon it will be just as unruly as SDCC.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t see as many costume tragedies as last year. Sure, there were a few Slave Leias that shouldn&#8217;t have left the house, but on the whole there were few attrocities. The best costume was one I saw on Sunday: a young woman bravely dressed as Poison Ivy wearing only some carefully placed leaf appliques and a flesh-colored thong. I don&#8217;t think she had an ounce of fat on her body, and needless to say she drew quite a crowd.</p>
<p>Not that I was leering, mind you.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>This weekend I&#8217;m headed back to the Big Apple with several 38 Studios cohorts to take part in a <a title="hells yeah" href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/62128" target="_blank">panel discussion</a> at <a title="NYCC" href="http://www.nycomiccon.com/App/homepage.cfm?moduleid=2577&amp;appname=100453" target="_blank">New York Comic Con</a>. The theme of the panel is &#8220;MMO Development: Year Two.&#8221; It&#8217;s a follow-up to last year&#8217;s panel in which we talked about, uh, year one of the studio.</p>
<p>So this raises the question of exactly why we&#8217;re travelling to the heart of Yankee country when we&#8217;ve made clear that we&#8217;re not going to unveil the details of Copernicus this year. Well, first of all, Ten Ton Hammer asked us to do it and we like those guys. Second, it gives the MMOG fan a peek behind the curtains at how development works. Finally, its Comic Con! We&#8217;re geeks at heart and love to soak it all in.</p>
<p>If you happen to be attending the show and would like to say hello, our panel starts at 1:45pm on Saturday. I&#8217;ll be wearing my <a title="You know you want to see it" href="http://the-adventurers-club.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/adam_hughes_power_girl3_1.jpg" target="_blank">Power Girl</a> costume.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Lum recently made <a title="It really is hard" href="http://www.brokentoys.org/2009/02/03/fixing-mmos-is-hard/" target="_blank">the best quote about game design I&#8217;ve heard in a long time</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Game design, in many ways, is convincing players that they won a struggle against imposing odds. It does not mean actually creating imposing odds.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Scott&#8217;s responses to #2 and #5 in particular are spot on. I admit I sometimes build dev rage when browsing some of the more <a title="At least I didn't say &quot;inbred&quot;" href="http://www.f13.net/" target="_blank">insular</a>, <a title="Yes, I said you, FoH" href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/mmorpg-general-discussion/" target="_blank">entrenched</a> message boards because they tend to be hangouts for posters who are personally tired of some of the characteristics of Diku-derived MMOGs. These folks proclaim, in no uncertain terms, that designers are either lazy or unimaginative for implementing things like level-based systems and launching games with fairly predictable AI for common mobs.</p>
<p>Game design is about making choices, and it&#8217;s next to impossible to explain to people why you make certain decisions if they&#8217;ve already predetermined in their minds not only why you&#8217;ve made them but that the choices you made are poor ones. Choices like the one between levels and skill-based systems aren&#8217;t inherently right or wrong; it comes down to how well they are executed.</p>
<p>All this is not to say that we shouldn&#8217;t strive for new ideas and drive the MMO genre to the frontiers of gaming. But at the same time, there&#8217;s plenty of opportunity left to use familiar, proven systems to lead players somewhere startlingly epic and amazing.</p>

Maybe I&#8217;m just used to gamers and geeks being misunderstood and stereotyped by the mainstream media, but I actually found the piece funny and charming.</p>
<p>Yeah it would have been more fair to compare gamers to other social groups that share a unique jargon (the military, cheerleaders, musicians, scrapbookers, or, you know, <em>every other freaking social group in the world</em>), but at least the reporter wasn&#8217;t attempting to create a deep investigative piece here.</p>

					<p>Over on the SOE blog, my friend Tracy posted her <a title="Clearly her memory is failing" href="http://gamersinreallife.wordpress.com/2009/01/20/writers-cramp/" target="_blank">hazy recollection</a> of how she and I began working together.</p>
<p>She insists that the soda story is true, though I cannot verify it. Honestly, until I was told that a designer named Tracy would be sharing an office with me, I always assumed she was part of the cleaning crew.</p>
<p>As for her reference to throwing an owl at my eye, that is <em>absolutely </em>true. It happened shortly after I&#8217;d dropped three grand on lasik surgery, and so immediately following the incident I began plotting my revenge. But eventually her manic charm wore me down and I decided we could be friends instead.</p>
<p>Everything she says about what a joy I am to work with&#8211;also true.</p>
<p>Tracy references an upcoming book for which she and I collaborated on a chapter, but I&#8217;ll wait to pimp that until it actually exists and you can add to my $.001 royalties by purchasing a copy.</p>
<p>Anyway, I thought I&#8217;d post the song she references, as I still think it&#8217;s a classic.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;ve long ago lost the ego to think that I can tell you what the &#8220;best&#8221; music of any given year is. Music is far too personal a thing for one blogger to tell you what is good and what isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>What I can do, however, is list my favorite music of the year. Hopefully what I write will be descriptive enough to encourage you to buy (as in pay cash money for) some of these albums, whether physical or digital copies. I don&#8217;t need to remind you that the music business is in dire straits as it seeks to reinvent itself, and the one thing we don&#8217;t want to see happen is that it becomes economically impossible for great artists to make a living doing what they do best. So please, buy some of this stuff. Albums listed after the break.</p>
