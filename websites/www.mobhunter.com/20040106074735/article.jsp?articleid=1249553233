   <font class="ArticleText">Today, we're going to examine a recent and continuing series of articles about MMOGs, and go off into an examination of some issues and directions things are going or should go. Here is <a
href="http://www.gamespy.com/amdmmog/week2/index.shtml" target="_new">a link</a> to the second of the articles, which picks things up at the UO/EQ stage of the genre. Let's dive right in, starting on the second page of that link, so follow along.<p><strong>Roper, who personally admits to falling head-first into Ultima Online and EverQuest before getting completely hooked on Dark Ages of Camelot, occasionally wonders why game developers have consistently chosen EverQuest as the model for their online games while ignoring Ultima Online. &quot;Maybe UO's early launch difficulties compared to EQ discouraged people, but who knows? It's just one of those things. Why did VHS get chosen over Beta?&quot; </strong><p>This is referring to Bill Roper who once was with Blizzard, involved with the Diablo projects and has since left to form his own company. The problem with Ultima Online was the developers seemed to have no long term vision as far as the content and depth was concerned. At the stage where I left the game, you could easily create a maxed out player for general use in a matter of days, but then what? You had nothing to really look forward to if you were just an average player, no goals, nothing to strive towards.<p>With Everquest, it follows the pattern of most traditional RPGs in that things are tough and requires a significant amount of time and effort to advance, but virtually at all times you can see the advancement paying off, and there is always a preverbial carrot in front of you, that next mob, that higher risk encounter, that better loot.<p>I haven't played a lot of the other games to be honest, but it's clear that other developers don't get that fact, or are reluctant to just give in to the way that Everquest did it. Smedly himself comments on this very fact...<p><strong>&quot;I read the reviews of </strong><strong><i>Star Wars Galaxies</i></strong><strong>,&quot; John Smedley indicates by way of example. &quot;The complaints I see indicate that maybe we went too much in the sandbox direction. People don't just want to be placed in a world and told to have fun. Some people want a little bit of direction in terms of what they can do.&quot;</strong><p>While he's not quite right on the mark as far as the exact issue, it shows some understanding of the overall issues with most of the MMORPGs released, that they essentially have no depth or direction for players. Prior to it's beta/release, virtually everyone thought that SWG would have been insanely successful because we all believed that it would be Everquest in space. You bring in people with the license and then the fundemental aspects of the gameplay hook them. Of course since it's not really like EQ, the story is vastly different.<p>All of that doesn't mean that every game has to be Everquest in <em>Genre/Location</em>, but there are lessons to be learned from everquest that it seems many developers, including Sony can't recognize.<p><strong>&quot;We had this dragon Nagafen ... a real tough challenge that was designed to be taken down by 20 people. But the first group that tackled the dragon was 50 adventurers strong, and they destroyed Nagafen in five minutes.&quot; This early deviation from the plan shook up EQ's design staff. </strong><p>For every developer out there, THIS is the start of a<br>fundemental design <em>flaw</em> in Everquest, so take notes. I believe I've mentioned before about the <em>zerg race</em> that seemed to be escalating between players and Sony for awhile, but this quote indicatse that it started long before even I thought it did. In essence what this all is, is that over time, developers see some players bringing excessive forces to do things, and then they design things around those forces. At one time, more than 36 people was considered a lot, then it was anything over 45, then 50, then 60. What happens is everyone has to compensate. The people who did things with lower numbers have to grow and chances are the people who needed 50 to do nagafen before, would need 75 or more, and over time, that sort of thing gets out of hand. It's pretty ridiculous that raids are all but expected to contain 72 people at the highest levels now. Just think about that for a minute, 72 actual people working together? It's a miracle anything gets done, but that doesn't all the sudden make it right.<p><strong>Part of this predicament is the fact that the very medium that created MMORPGs -- the Internet -- has also created an environment where players can solve a difficult quest and then immediately go online and post a full walkthrough for other players.</strong><p>Continuing in the problem area this is something I agree with completely. Of course I've used spoilers and read boards where they exist and all that, but they still serve to take something away from the game. That thing of course is discovery. It's difficult though to come up with a solution to this problem since randomness is only good for so much. They talk about how the lost dungeon expansion solves some of this by being random, but that's about the most absurd thing I've heard. There is nothing of value TO spoil in the lost dungeons, which I suppose is one approach. In reality like I said in a traditional game like Everquest, it is difficult to have quality content such as involved quests and encounters, and not have spoilers.<p>Finally in the article in the series, they discuss what some people claim is missing from online games, and they claim humanity.<p><strong>Sony Online believes it can begin to address these problems by imbuing more life and realism into its AI driven NPCs. &quot;Look at how pathetic NPCs are in today's games, including ours own,&quot; John Smedley exclaims. &quot;They're retarded. We can do so much better.&quot; <p>Smedley and Trost believe that EverQuest 2 will begin to address these shortcomings in a variety of ways. For starters, NPCs will approach the player and speak to them or offer quests. And they'll have long memories. &quot;If you piss off a shopkeeper, they'll complain about you to the authorities, and you'd better not come near that shop again.&quot; <p>Interestingly, Smedley indicates that Star Wars Galaxies incorporated more human elements into its NPC behaviors, although few gamers have noticed it. &quot;If you go into a cantina and chat, when you leave, the bartender will start floating bits of your conversation to other people.&quot; </strong><p>Anyone besides me see the problem with these statements. While I agree that NPCs are <em>retarded</em>, I doubt for the most part that anyone even cares, because if it hasn't occured to anyone, there are actual other people playing these games. Then after talking about Everquest 2 and NPCs, they say that they had already done some things in SWG, but pretty much no one notices. <p>Then we have continued story of the interaction of players,<br>and again, the dense nature of some developers.<p><strong>Another example of player impact occurred in the original Asheron's Call, and caught developers totally off guard. A crystal held the soul of the demon Bael'Zharon, and the storyline was to evolve where the crystal would be destroyed by evil players and the demon would be released, leading to the next episode of the story. This happened as expected on all servers except one. On the server dubbed Thistledown, a band of good players rallied around the crystal, setting up 24-hour watches to fight off all evil characters. The longer it lasted, the more acclaim the defenders received. It got to the point that the new storyline could not continue. The developers finally had to intervene with high-level characters to destroy the defenders so the crystal could be broken and the story could continue. Even in defeat, though, the players showed they could have a strong impact beyond what was ever envisioned by the developers.</strong><p>Like I said above, I haven't really played most of these other games, so I'm just basing my comments off of what this paragraph contains. My issue is that, again this is how not to do things. It says that it's an example of player impact, when in fact the players work and investment meant nothing, the outcome was already decided, and what did they get for it? They had developers come down with god characters and slaughter them all just so that they could move the story along the way they wanted it to. <p>The issue is that to many developers they see player impact as something that inconveniences them. Nagafen being taken down by 50 people? Oh no my baby has been killed, I better give it twice as many hitpoints! Good players participating in a quest and succeeding when you <em>need</em> them to fail? Sounds like a great time to lay waste to them!<p>In reality, player impact would be players you know, actually having an impact on the game world, and not just the developer egos.<p>Now that I've recapped all of that, what do I think is the future?<p>Increased interactivity and actual community. Interactivity would include all the things that make a game fun. It can mean things such as the above mentioned better NPCs, along with the games world feeling more alive. Further and far more importantly, the idea would be to bring a single player game feel to a multiple player game.<p>Some of you groan about if I wanted to play a single player game, I'd play one that wouldn't cost me 13$ or more a month, but the idea is not that there would be a large online game full of people doing single player game things, but that the interactivity of a single player game and the depth would exist for not only single players, but also groups, and guilds.<p>Using concepts I've just pretty much made up, in the fantasy context this could be things such as a quest log that allows a group of players to experience a lengthy involved quest, similar to what might find in a single player RPG. This would take these players to many different locations, doing a variety of things, all for a purpose. <p>Then, again on the player impact part, player actions would actually impact the world. Some quests might be outright solved or open/unlock other quests for other people, and not in a detrimental way ala the Sleeper in Everquest. <p>That of course goes into the increase community. A fundemental flaw in EQ is that it has actually discouraged players forming any real community since its inception. Sleepers tomb is one example where by a set of players could for a time, virtually remove an entire zones worth of content and while some people even myself can appreaciate an event that changes the games world, the fact is it's a game, and it's meant to be fun for everyone, there is no reason that changes have to be so negative.<p>Another example, that was added in during the early days of the planes of power and is admittedly a non issue these days was with the trials in the plane of justice. Just about everyone realized that one trial was a lot more straightforward and thus easier, and everyone wanted to get into the plane of valor. That's all fine and good, but the Designers saw that players were basically going one group after the other into the executioner trial, and probably felt a bit annoyed that people were doing that, and wanted to slow them down. In response to that, and an even smaller issue that could have had other solutions (of people leaving corpses around after winning and others being able to get the marks), they made it so that if a group of players succeeded, the trial was not usable for 30 minutes.<p>On the surface you might wonder what the issue is with that, and it's simple and applies to far more than just the trial. It created a situation in which, players hoped that others players would fail. As I said, this applies to just about everywhere in the game other than the lost dungeons, and that is probably one of the better features of the expansion although to accomplish that, it pretty much has to segregate everyone into their own little area to do so.<p>As such I'm skeptical if that really is the best approach. The best I can say is that the gameplay of future games needs to be done in such a way that where there isn't a situation in which the game encourages players to be at odds unless it fits within the games world (pvp obviously). Many developers appear to want to take more complicated approaches such as the way EQ2 has been described as far as player councils and what not, and to say the least I have my doubts because of the way things have been described. I'm more a fan of giving players all the tools and letting them run with it than having a framework that players simply fill in, in sort of the way that UO had some tools, houses, and from that, it evolved to have some player communities, both good and bad which fit the context of the game.<p>There is a lot more to discuss about the genre, and I could go on all day long, but I'd be interested in what you think and where you think things should go.<br></font>
