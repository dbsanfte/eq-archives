<p>To Quote like the first paragraph of that link:</p>

<p>"To be clear, all we are doing is facilitating these transactions. We are NOT in the business of selling virtual goods ourselves."</p>

<p>I only post that, because while in the topic, you say 'broker,' in the link, the statement reads that they are selling items themselves.  Just a clarification :p</p>

<p>While I wholeheartedly do not support this change in policy, I will say that I do trust SOE more than I do a third party.</p>

<p>They have made it painly clear that this will be a truly optional service, and not all servers will be Station Exchange enabled. No doubt the player population is largely against this change, myself included. But as long as its optional (opt-in) I don't have a problem with its existence. Those that want to buy and sell items will always do so whether this service exists or not, but as long as I can continue playing on a server where it's not allowed, then let people waste their money.</p>

<p>I do not like the precedent this sets.</p>

<p>I have always been against buying and selling items and game money for real-world $$$ and adamantly against trading characters in any form.</p>

<p>I do think, however, that it's been proven that people are going to do this.  I sincerely HOPE that SOE's aims in this are to regulate the practice and to confine it to "niche" servers instead of it being everywhere and underground.</p>

<p>So in that sense, I hope SOE puts IGE out of business.<br />

<p>On one hand I consider that within the last few years the expansion of computing into India, China, and other low-development high-population nations has opened an enormous supply of labor. They are willing to try anything to make a buck they can do remotely. Combine this with a vague distaste for the general practice of plat farming and general attitude of N.I.M.B.Y. Therefore I think this will be a flop.</p>

<p>On the other hand I look back to EverQuest's $40 a month server, wonder that people are willing to spend quite a lot on their entertainment, and then consider the frugal reasoner that considers his time being turned back into money after tiring of the character and game. Therefore I think it will be wildly successful.</p>

<p>I am one of those who finds the buying/selling of account & items & plat "sleazy."  BUT... there apparently is a demand for these services, so SOE would be crazy NOT to do this.  <br />
(1) They will get a small 'fee' from every transaction, so they will be making more revenue...and denying it to outside auction agencies.  <br />
(2) this will reduce a lot of their 'fraud' complaints that take up a lot of Customer Service resources to investigate, and <br />
(3) At the same time, this protects the players from the afore-mentioned fraud by ensuring a secure means of exchange.</p>

<p>I find this appalling.  I will not be playing EQ2.  If this goes to EQ, I will not be playing EQ.</p>

<p>I work anywhere from 50-70 hours a week.  I have very little time for gaming, but still squeeze in EQ when I can.  This lack of time means I cannot / do not raid, and that large portions of the game are closed off to me.</p>

<p>And I still think the idea is horrible, and it will have a large, negative impact on any game it is implemented for.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Xyldarran at April 20, 2005 03:01 AM</strong></p>
<p>Come off of it.</p>

<p>Do you guys think this is a new thing?  The buying and selling of items/money/characters?  Do you really think no one has ever done this before?  I could post a million websites where this is going on this very momment.</p>

<p>The fact is as long as these games exist there will be people selling items/money/characters.  No matter what SoE or blizzard or whoever does this will be a common occurance. Sony has been fighting it for years, but now they realize it's not something they can stop, like dowloading MP3s on the internet.  There will always be a way to do it.</p>

<p>So Sony decides to do it themselves.  Bravo.  Now we have a controlled way of doing it.  Sony will be making more money which can be used towards the game (unlikely I know, but still possible) and the GMs won't have to deal with petitions regarding these things anymore.  That = more free GM time.</p>

<p>The people who have never buy will still never buy, and the people who are willing to buy will still be the people willing to buy.  the fact that you assume this will change your gameplay at all is a sign of ignorance.  You've obviously never heard of Yantis.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Yantis at April 20, 2005 03:06 AM</strong></p>
<p>This is a very bad idea and probably spells the end of EQ2.  They should rethink this and abandon their plans immediately before it ruins the game.<br />
</p>

<p>"I worry for the result to the social bonding of players in this game." </p>

<p>Are SoE financial results THAT bad or everquest 2 population so much declining to decide something like this?</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Kubb at April 20, 2005 08:57 AM</strong></p>
<p>I don't think it will impact current players; they may have some quit but probably not many.</p>

<p>On the other hand this makes EQ2 look bad to new players. Why would I play EQ2 where someone with more money than me will have better stuff than I can get when I can play any of the other MMORPGs where at least theoretically things are more fair.</p>

<p>Yes there are these sorts of things in other games too but none are officially sanctioned and therein lies the difference.</p>

<p>Smedley is a businessman who cares nothing for games except how they can make him money. Good on him but I don't want to parttake of the games he puts out.</p>

<p>Shameless plug.  I got quoted in the Wired online article on the topic:</p>

<p>http://www.wired.com/news/games/0,2101,67280,00.html</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by <a href="mailto&#58;bcaton&#64;bigpond&#46;com">Eski</a> at April 20, 2005 10:22 AM</strong></p>
<p>I'm wary of this because they said they wouldn't do it, then they said they might if people wanted it (what was the vote result?), then they say they will do it but not allow transfers from buy-your-way-to-godhood servers to normal ones.... </p>

<p>What's the probability of them changing that last rule? It's in the way of short term profit!</p>

<p>Other things that worry me: </p>

<p>There's already been one killing over money for goods bought from a MMOG... when real money is concerned, people can get vicious fast. People have rarely killed over chess. Poker on the other hand...</p>

<p>I can see that if the market is really as gigantic as $200 000 000 per year (where did they get that figure from?), then criminals would get involved. I hope that SOE has thought about this and has talked to the law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Teremar at April 20, 2005 10:43 AM</strong></p>
<p>I don't see how "just" allowing players to sell to each other is better than SOE creating and selling the items themselves.</p>

<p>The sad reality is that MMORPG farming is a profitable business in some countries, and the Station Exchange servers are going to be a farmer's paradise. A lot of EQ players may not have seen professional farmers in action (I hadn't until I started playing WoW), but these operations buy accounts and have people playing them 24 hours/day, in shifts, solely to sell what they get for cash. The end result is a flow into the game of cash, items, and high-level characters that simply would not be there otherwise, as surely as if SOE were just making them themselves.</p>

<p>But the difference is you have to live with the farmers. I'm not saying they're bad people--I'm sure most of us would play differently if our paychecks were on the line. But their paychecks are. Thus they monopolize the most profitable content, and are often quite aggressive in defending it. If they're leveling up new characters to sell that means they'll be doing it in newbie zones as well. It doesn't help that they often don't know English, so the negative feedback they get from other players means nothing to them.</p>

<p>A very unpleasant side effect of those negative interactions is that you end up with a culture among the players that tolerates racism. Not that there's ever any excuse for racism, but it's what happens. I'm sure the harassment they get doesn't make the farmers feel any better about Americans either.</p>

<p>The only redeeming factor in SOE's new policy is that you have to choose to be on a server that allows buying and selling. Part of me is thinking that the people who provide the demand for farmed items deserve to deal with the side effects of how they are supplied.</p>

<p>EQ2 is dead... lol.  Anyhow, if they want to facilitate the buying/selling of virtual stuffs, are they going to have to adjust the EULA?  Dunno.  I always thought it'd be neat to buy a toon (not that I could afford one).  It's not like I'm going to miss all the fun stuff I went through with my main, it's more... wow, this is kinda fun playing a *anything but a cleric* hehe.  Then if it's cool and I start up another toon, maybe I'll do that one? </p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by  at April 20, 2005 10:57 AM</strong></p>
<p>It is a huge mistake. It was my impression that the reason SoE has never aggressively pushed against the plat farmers and account sellers is because they never wanted to end up with the lawsuit as to whether virtual items had monetary value.</p>

<p>Now, they are effectively monetizing those same virtual items. Besides the debilitating effects on the game from legitimizing what is effectively cheating (advancing in a game through external jiggering) now they will have the problem of having effectively admitted that in game items have external monetary value. So bannings, LDs, outages etc. which cause a loss have now caused a monetary loss. They're going to regret this.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Teremar at April 20, 2005 11:29 AM</strong></p>
<p>So much for EQ2...but what about the MMORPG industry as a whole?</p>

<p>The IGE comments in the Wired article are right on that this is a great thing for them. I kept hoping that some company would finally have the guts to sue them. But now if anyone does, and it comes time for the game company to explain how trading in-game stuff for RL cash hurts their game and thus their bottom line, IGE will just point to EQ2 and say "See, SOE doesn't think it hurts their game at all." And obviously it helps legitimize the practice when a major player in the industry endorses it.</p>

<p>The saddest part for me personally is that Blizzard did not categorically rule out doing something similar. They're "waiting to see what happens."</p>

<p>And there's my main hope. If the exchange servers tank, then everyone will see that trading in-game accomplishments for cash hurts an MMORPG.</p>

<p>So here's hoping the farmers are absolutely insufferable, and that the buyers get an empty feeling from everything they accomplish with their bought characters and gear.</p>

<p>Loral always seems to keep a level head about things! Read so many overexcited responses to this. But if SOE is admitting to 40 percent of their customer complaints turn out to be about this (and since everybody has to lie about it that is only the ones they figured out) Just think if they could free up half of that for wofking honest tickets!! Happening anyhow so I say why not. Put em on their server and leave us alone LOL</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by <a href="mailto&#58;tantrikMT&#64;yahoo&#46;com">Tantrik</a> at April 20, 2005 12:19 PM</strong></p>
<p>For the life of me I can't figure out why people think this is a bad idea.  Like it's been pointed out, they are not producing the items out of thin air.  The items that go up for trading will have been obtained through the games play mechanics.  </p>

<p>Another point to think about.  It seems people think that the direct influence of RL money "corrupts" the game in some fashion, but money already plays a factor.  Why is it wrong for someone working a full-time job pay a little RL cash to buy an item that saves them hours of camping or whatnot, but some trustfund baby who has all the time in the world to play these games gets put up on a pedastal for having done it "the right way".  People need to realize that real life wealth already has a big influence on these games.</p>

<p>Another point to consider is how secondary markets help keep games alive.  Where would EQ be today if every new person coming into the game had to start from scratch at lvl 1 with zero AA, zero keys, zero flags?  </p>

<p>Now please realize that I would never be in favor of a company simply creating characters or items out of thin air.  I think that would be going too far in upsetting in-game economies, but as long as the characters or items were obtained through legit game mechanics and play then I see nothing wrong in facilitating RL cash transactions between players.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by  at April 20, 2005 12:35 PM</strong></p>
<p>My thoughts on this are simple, people hate e-bayed players, how is this so different?<br />
On EQLive this problem could be controlled through No Drop items being the best in the game, this only gives people easier access to the bazaar bought gear.<br />
On EQ2 this is a huge problem, almost everything starts out merely as "attunable", e-baying the gear, just not the exp.  Combine this with the fact that the survey that was done to come up with this tactic was done on EQLIVE NOT EQ2, what is Sony thinking?! I really cannot condone this under any circumstances, any achievements that I put all of my effort / drive into for weeks can be matched by a rich teen out there shilling out 200 bucks OR LESS?!  No thanks.<br />
And before you flame this to no end, yes, I am aware that the servers will be restricted as to where this will be taking place, but the precedent set by this is such a slippery slope you might as well call it a free-fall.  Also, if I see more GM activity doing anything at all online because of these changes I can honestly say I would be in shock.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Teremar at April 20, 2005 12:37 PM</strong></p>
<p>The irony is that a major reason, perhaps the major reason, people play MMORPG's is because they get a sense of accomplishment from getting in-game rewards. Heck, many feel like they ability to get in-game rewards somehow makes them a better person. EQ has been very good at fostering this illusion, and it has served them well by keeping people playing.</p>

<p>But making those rewards available for cash cheapens them. Thus it reduces the incentive to get those rewards, and in the long run, to play the game at all.</p>

<p>SOE may be sacrificing their long-term survival for a short-term revenue boost. One would think they'd understand the psychology of their customers better than that.</p>

<p>Cory Doctorow, editor of Boing Boing and Canadian science fiction author, wrote a short story called Anda's Game:</p>

<p>http://www.authorama.com/book/andas-game.html</p>

<p>It's an interesting look at how companies use real life resources in third world countries to sell gear to rich kids in the first world.  It's a great story and a good view of the complexities of a system like this.</p>

<p>I don't think this will lead to cutting back on IGE's sales until SOE begins doing it on all servers, which seems like the next logical step.  People on current live servers will still want to buy and sell even if SOE does it on a new set of servers.  A much better approach would be to establish this as a model in a new game right in the beginning instead of trying to bring it to a game already in existance.</p>

<p>This new system will completely change the value of items.  No longer will I consider the time investment without considering the possible financial investment.  Is it better for me to hunt for a prismatic sword or just buy one?</p>

<p>The other problem comes from a disturbing trend I see in newer MMOGs.  Instead of deeper massive online games that reward players for establishing social connections we're seeing a focus on solo play in short time periods with options to buy or sell characters instead of working them up from the beginning.  It may be good business but I think these recent changes hurt the core of what these games are about: meeting people and having fun with them.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is that core difference between EQ and EQ2 that we've always discussed.  I doubt they will establish something like this in EQ now that its hit the venerable age of six years.  At least, I hope not.</p>

<p>Ok ... I've sat here and read the multiple posts about people saying this is horrible. Granted this is your opinion, but what are you basing this on? Perhaps the "toon" you encountered was bought by avenues you detest. And perhaps, there is a learning curve to many MMOs. And perhaps, there are more people willing to live outside of the world than in these created ones. Mabye people should look at the bright side of these introductions & "improvements" to games as just that. When you hear about someone at work or school talking about a bad experience at any establishment, what is your first thought? Do you have the same tastes as everyone else, or do you want them to? Where this leads, no one knows ... I repeat ... no one. If this happens to tank, do you think it will stay? if that does happens, eventually everything will go back to normal. Let me ask this question, do you enjoy sitting for hours on end ... for weeks at a time, farming plat or camping a single mob to get that single coveted drop? There are many other things they could do to make certain that the "high end content" unavailable to these people. They could go and take certain flags off of characters. If you buy a toon through there service, you would have to get re-keyed for whatever your interests are. In that sense, it's good because if you don't know how to play a certain toon, you do need the practice and should not be in those zones wreaking havoc. So before everyone starts to think that this is horrible and will ruin games ... please unplug and look at the life arround you. Why can certain people have gigantic homes. Why can certain drive the expensive imports. And how is it that there are people that spend $200 on tennis shoes? Because they earn the cash to spend it. Do you detest people with money that they earned? Do you detest people that are skilled enough to make a living at whatever trade they are working? Everyone, in some sense, has a hard time with certain things about things in their lives. That is human. If you want better ... achieve ... don't expect. Now, there are obviously going to be the "trust fund babies" in the world. So is true in any MMORPG. If anything, this will boost the ammount of people you encounter ... good and bad ... the choice of relavence is yours to make.</p>

<p>My question is; In the near future are we going to add to the discussions of "non raid to raid guilds/players", the rich player.  Will we see the subject lines of "closing the gap between the Rich players that can buy their way to the top, and the poorer players that have to work for their gear and levels".  Will SOE have a tendancey to court the rich players that will buy the highest level toon on the market and the best gear on the market?   </p>

<p>Somehow, I feel like this is similar to the cheat codes that use to come out with those old games, and that the makers of the Sims capitalized on it by posting them on their board.</p>

<p>After years of asking people to report the players that are selling plat and toons in OOC. They are now encouraging and endorsing this practice. </p>

<p>I am not happy, if it does come to EQ1, you will have the abbility to buy your raiding guild.  </p>

<p>One day you are socializing with someone you thought you knew, next day the same toon does not know you, or want to have anything to do with you. Some other real person owns that toon....<br />
So much for encouraging a social friends meeting and making friends game.  </p>

<p>This is very sad news. It seems to me that customer service will actually create more problems from fights over camps/mobs now that they have an official cash value associated with them.  One wonders when the first lawsuit against SOE will occur because a GM doesn't respond fast enough to a camping and/or kill stealing complaint.</p>

<p>Also if you think SOE won't be creating cash or goods, don't kid yourself.  The instant Smed needs to quickly improve his numbers for a quarterly financial, you can bet he'll turn on the spigot.</p>

<p>I guess the question for me is,  do I reactivate my EQ1 characters (including a decent amount of plat) and sell now or wait for the official SOE sanction when they'll be worth less?</p>

<p>I'm glad I experienced MMRPGs before this kind of decisions took place.</p>

<p>And I hope I'll be gone from EQ1 before SoE implements it there.</p>

<p>There's really no redeeming for a company to bypass it's own content for a dollar bill.</p>

<p>It's similar to using god mode on a FPS. Up until that point, you probably were having a good time. Once you crossed the line and cheated, the game loses its appeal.</p>

<p>People who will buy items will soon leave as they won't have any satisfaction or accomplishment in their characters.  People who don't will be disenchanted with the now open, approved, cheating and leave.  </p>

<p>The fact SOE is getting a cut of action is disgusting.  For shame Sony.</p>

<p>For a long time I've been a proponent of playing in the spirit of the game, whatever game you play.  Playing the game it was envisioned to be played, rather than taking the shortest, quickest, or easiest path to get to the top of the game or outdo your peers.  Mostly that means not engaging in things like grinding, powerleveling, twinking, muling, and so on.  You create your character, and you play the game.  You go experience the content - explore the dungeons, do the quests.  Leveling up or getting a new item is a bonus, a part of the story that you're weaving in the game, and not the goal.</p>

<p>There are a lot of people out there who don't agree with me about that.  I like to point out the RPG in MMORPG, but to many players it just doesn't matter.  All they care about is getting to whatever looks most exciting as fast as possible, or progressing through equipment or levels as quickly as possible.  For them, it's all about the cheese at the end of the maze, and if they can, they'll hop over walls to get there rather than find their way through.</p>

<p>Who's right and who's wrong?  It's an impossible question to answer because there are so many people on either side of the fence, and quite a few in the middle.  I have good friends in various games who don't feel nearly as strongly as I do about this stuff, but we respect each other's opinions and we manage to play the game together in spite of that.</p>

<p>People who feel as I do (we seem sometimes to be the minority) have, up until now, found solace in the fact that the game developers and publishers ultimately seemed to believe that we were in the right, and that all those "shortcut" activities were bad for the game.  But not anymore.</p>

<p>That fact alone upsets me.  I enjoy playing MMORPGs, and I have a lot of fun in them.  But I don't enjoy it when I run into someone who bought their character or their gear on an auction site, or whose idea of gameplay is to go sit and grind levels in the quickest way possible.  A lot of people have asked me why I don't play on roleplay servers, and perhaps that's due to a lingering mistrust on my part for people who would advertise the fact that they're RPing rather than just quietly doing it, but every time I run into a twinker or an ebayer or a farmer I ask myself if maybe I shouldn't reconsider that opinion.</p>

<p>Regardless of how I personally feel, the decision has been made to go ahead with this experiment, and while I wish it would fall flat on its face and prove once and for all that most gamers don't like this kind of thing, I am pretty sure that won't be the case.  And it really worries me for what the future holds.  Ten years from now, will I still be able to play a game without having to whip out a credit card to keep up with my friends?  Will I still be able to even find a game with a decent population where players actually share the same ideals that I do?  Will people like me be relegated to special rules server or games past their prime that haven't implemented these systems?  Will we be denied the newest technology and content simply because we think it's important for a game world to maintain it's integrity and believability?</p>

<p>I make a good salary in real life and so I don't approach this from a position of jealousy, as so many of the auction supporters like to complain.  I am a time limited player as well - the days of being able to spend 8 hours online are long past.  I just believe that it's wrong.  It's not what the genre is supposed to be about.  And I am very afraid that now, because of this change, because of the apparent indifference or even support of so many people who in my view just don't get it, that in a few years I won't be able to have as rich of an experience online, nor will many people I know.</p>

<p>At this point the die has been cast, so I guess we'll have to wait and see.<br />

<p>Just imagine what this is going to do to guild dynamics.</p>

<p>"Hey guys, can we schedule a trip to Deepdark Dungeon? I want to get my Wand of Amazingness."</p>

<p>"Aww man...Deepdark Dungeon is a royal pain. Just go buy the darn thing! Look--there's a Wand of Amazingness for sale right now. Only 200 bucks."</p>

<p>Or the new uber guild requirements:</p>

<p>"Members will be expected to donate $20 each month to the guild equipment fund, which will be used to buy gear that is vital to the guild's progression. In addition, members are expected to spend at least $100 each quarter upgrading their own gear."</p>

<p>"Guild bank" could have a whole new meaning.</p>
<p class="posted"><strong>Posted by Redcloud at April 21, 2005 03:16 AM</strong></p>
<p>Guild bank took already another meaning with a well known guild whose officers sold on PA/Ebay for cash. The story doesn't say for what purposes, web cost, mules/bots or a new car, but it already turned that way some time ago in rare and public outcries.</p>

<p>Now knowing that even at a guild level, sold raid gears and toons could total easily the 10s of thousands of dollars one might expect to see a whole new headache of legalese, RL feuds, etc</p>

<p>From a hobby, it becomes more and more of a business on the end-user side. A hobby for the rich, a job for the poor? Maybe it needs rules like in sports: pros may not compete with amateurs. Amateurs have this and that restriction to respect, etc. </p>

<p>I just don't see how it could be applicable to a game but that's another matter.</p>

<p>I've said it before here and other places and I'll say it again, SOE is getting progressively worse at running MMORPGs. They are simply incapable of thinking in the long term. This is only the first step. Mark my words they will eventually sell preleveled characters and manufactured ingame cash or items and it won't be limited to a few servers on EQ2 only. It's already been done by EA and look how well that worked, but SOE won't learn from them. This will completely throw any game economy out of whack. The only thing that can keep in game economies somewhat stable is the occasional removal of cash and items from the system. With the buying/selling of accounts and money, and the even more scary thought of SOE just making characters or money to sell, the supply gets out of hand, exceding demand and making things next to worthless. It is shortsighted to think that this will have little or no impact on players that will eventually cause many to quit in frustration. If any of you think it's all OK go play Lineage 2 and see how long you want to play that piece of garbage. The whole idea just cheapens any advancement or accomplishments one obtains in the game, and caters to the lazy and bad players.</p>

<p>I personally think higher ups in Sony Corp should fire Smedly. Look at his track record in the last few years. SWG is a complete bore and a mess, requiring them to retune the entire combat system, as well as being somewhat of a failure considering they have the most popular science fiction francise in existance. EQ has went from over 400k subscribers to who knows how many now, but definately WAY lower as evidenced by all the server merges. EQ2 has had a good initial release but seems to have sputtered in it's growth rather quickly and has not been the kind of success I think they were hoping for. Planetside? LOL! Now SOE will be known as the company that runs games that aren't really games but just something you can invest in and buy your way to the top, thus defeating the whole point of playing a game. I know this was his idea, it has Smedly written all over it. I don't believe his justification for it, and in fact I think he is and has been a liar for a long time about many things he claims. Apparently he can't just leave well enough alone and ride the success that EQ was. He has to keep coming up with these "brilliant" ideas that further alienate the true gamers who want to play these games as a game, meaning earning stuff in a fantasy world and having fun doing it without sacrificing one's life to do it.</p>

<p>If they do this in EQ also (and I do believe they will by the end of the year) I think the somewhat revival of the game in recent months will come to a halt and the decline will continue again. But yet the fanboys will continue to make excuses for the bad decisions and continue to swear by an old, broken down and cheapened game. As a final point calling people whiners who played the game for years who don't like the idea of cheapening their accomplishments is immature and basically acting like a jackass. How would you like it if you worked at a job for years and someone else came in and bribed the boss into promoting him ahead of you even though he is not as qualified? It's so easy to think only about yourself and your own greed until a little of your own medicine slaps you in the face.</p>

<p>Let the games be games!<br />

<p>My referral to EA concerns Ultima Online for those who do not know. That game has become a joke thanks to similiar actions on EA's part and is fast dying. Lineage 2 is also pathetic with frmers ruling the game and ruining the economy. No impact at all eh?</p>

<p>Pretty ironic, wouldn't you say?[br][br]</p>

<p>I'm not supprised by this, but I am dissapointed. The solution is to catch the cheaters, not join them. I will have to finally get my main to max level after 4 years, just so I can feel I've done it before the game is ruined and I have to leave.[br][br] The fact that SOE is gonna get a cut of the transactions means they will do everything they can to accomodate this, including supporting the farmers. It will be in their best interests to do so. So the game will become a "class" defined game, with the classes defined as "Rich" and "Poor", and the poor folks will be ignored. </p>

<p>In other news, this was posted by the Dev Zajeer on the EQ boards.  While I'm happy about the MoD addition (very happy!), the comment about Time gear an "expansion or two" away worries me considering what Loral has said about the gulf between casual/raider, which I agree with.</p>

<p>"I'll be adding an item with Minion of Darkness to the DoN merchants next patch.</p>

<p>Not yet. Maybe in an expansion or two when Time gear becomes commonplace. Until then, Minion of Darkness is the highest you should be able to get in single groups."</p>

<p>If SOE is truly interested in getting rid of IGE, make the selling free. They're basically legitimizing the sale of virtual items for RL cash regardless of their eula and 'selling rights to use' clauses.</p>

<p>But guess what? SOE is in it for the money and IGE is evil because they are in it for what? Oh, the money....<br />

<p>My fear is that this will remove the in game economy and force people to use the station exchange if they wish to obtain some of the rarer items in the game. If this is successful I think it will be available on all servers and eventually all SOE games.</p>

<p>This will promote greed among players and guilds now that items and characters will have monetary values.</p>

<p>.. I would look at it as.. the lesser of 2 evils.. if sony did it they would be the lesser of 2 evils. </p>

<p>While I am not fully convinced this is the right way to go and never will be. I do imagine of a time when the characters and items exchanged in this method were not farmed by some person in a third world nation.</p>

<p>too bad legitimizing it wont stop that though.</p>

<p>This could be either good or bad, depending on what they do with servers that are not designated for this.  If they begin a strong crackdown on any and all selling activity on non-sanctioned servers, then I'd say it's a good thing whether it succeeds or fails.  In theory.  It reduces the number of sellers and buyers on my server.  People will buy less, especially if there's a crackdown on non-sanctioned servers, and the sellers will probably focus on the sanctioned servers, where their market will likely be larger than elsewhere.</p>

<p>There's too damn much legal issues here for anyone but a team of lawyers to really figure out, and even then it'd likely have to be tested in court, but like someone said - this is definitely going to weaken the stance of 'it's OUR data, you can't sell it' that the games have been taking so far.</p>

<p>Another question that comes up is, if there's a server crash, rollback, etc, that causes people to lose items...couldn't legitimizing this open some doors for SOE to get sued over loss of items and revenue?  I mean, if someone loses Uber_Weapon_1351 that they were going to sell for $400, having SOE recognize that these things are worth money could open them up to being held accountable for the loss of such items.  It may be legally no different than if a computer error in a bank caused $400 to dissappear from your account.   (Note, I'm neither a lawyer nor an expert, but it seems like logical speculation to me). And what do the legal repercussions mean for other MMOG's?  And what happens down the road when these games are dying and they finally decide to shut down the servers?  Are people going to be able to hold the company responsible for all the millions of dollars worth of equipment and in-game currency that the players have accumulated on their characters?</p>

<p>Beyond the obvious effects on the economy (EQ is an excellent example, but it's even more noticeable in games like Lineage II and FFXI), there's a lot of Important Stuff that could have repercussions for decades to come on the entire MMOG industry, whether it flops or succeeds.</p>

<p>I read the thread on gear progression and found it amusing how the raiders continue to try to keep the casuals way far below them and out of their little sandbox. When I played EQ I played both sides, first non-raider, then raider and finally back to non-raider before I quit. After seeing it from both sides I agree with Loral (miracles can happen LOL). The major shortcoming of EQ besides it's age is how casual unfriendly it becomes once you hit that invisible wall of progression. It basically requires people to change their playstyle in order to progress any further. They have put in many small scale encounters in recent expansions but how are people in lower end gear supposed to do many of them with the difficulty of mobs increasing so much?</p>

<p>In a way I think SOE considers the brokering of the sale of accounts part of the solution to this problem, and it is a very bad one if that's what they intend. They really better start considering the long term impact of major game changes, and especially of services like this one if it hits EQ too, more thoroughly or they aren't going to have much of a game left in a year or two. EQ no longer exists in a vacuum with little competition. With games like WoW and CoH out there that have much smoother progression paths and that are much more casual friendly they will be lucky to have any casual players left in EQ at all. I don't even bother mentioning EQ2 as an alternative because I don't consider it a game anymore now they will allow people to legally buy their way to the top with RL money.</p>

<p>SOE should, would, need...</p>

<p>Raiders are the devil, I tell you.</p>

<p>Raid gear is VITAL to kill 500s hitting mobs that don't AE for 4k and so on and so for.</p>

<p>That one is not a debate this is a one way rant dripping with greed and jealousy. </p>

<p>Saying that it may not be as fun to gear up in single group as it should be is valid, saying that it's not possible is BS.</p>
