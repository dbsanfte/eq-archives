   <font class="ArticleText">This weeks discussion is about community in online games. I'll take a look at how some games approach it both inside the game and outside the game, to help create communities for players or allow them to create their own. While I had begun working on this before I saw this <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/amdmmog/week5/" target="_new">article</a> in the series at Gamespy, I encourage you to check it out because I will touch on some things that they talk about. We'll go by game looking at two games who have taken different approaches, inside and outside of the game.<p>First off, we will examine Ultima Online. Outside of the game, Origin had a lot of communication with players on messageboards, not just before the game went live, but afterwards also, and it wasn't always just one person, as they didn't have a <em>&quot;Community Manager&quot;</em>, they instead had designers and programmers who just read the boards and posted. For the most part the community was not quite as splintered as Everquests is, because aside from servers, there weren't really sites needed for different classes as well. Being that it was the first real massively multiplayer game to be successful, the people at Origin were learning as they went just like everyone else. I haven't really kept up with the nature of things now, some time after I stopped playing, but the sense I get is that things in this regard have not changed much.<p>In the game things were a bit different. Origins goal was more of a world simulation than Everquest, and they expected a few aspects of that to encourage communities. The first one was the much talked about resource system. The goal with this system was to achieve some sort of balance between players for game resources, for example various hides, or ore from mining. The idea of course was a bit more complicated than that, but when it came time to it, when you unleashed a few thousand players on this finely tuned resource system, Origin and namely the designer of said system probably learned he didn't understand the nature of people and game players.<p>You see, players kill everything in sight, rabits, wolves, bears, cats and dogs even. We strip mine, log entire forests, everything and soon, the world was a virtual wasteland. You could run from one corner of the world to another and not see a living creature, you couldn't chop wood from 75% of the trees, and on and on. So of course they removed all of that and put in the regular old stuff like most other games use, such as spawn points and the like. Arguably the system as it was implemented did nothing for player communities, in fact it spread people around more as you had to search for that one tile of land that hadn't been sucked dry, although as I'll get to later, the idea itself was not necessarily invalid, it was just not designed around the fact it's a video game, not the real world and people don't play games the way they do things in real life (or maybe we do, but time is compressed in a game). People in real life do the same sorts of things, but it might take dozens of years or thousands in some cases, where in UO, mines were drained, whole forests were forested, all in a matter of days.<p>The next idea and unfortunately it is reiterated in the above mentioned article is the idea that conflict can help create communities. The thought being that threats and conflict will galvanize people together. The approach taken in UO was to pretty much encourage players to kill other players as the best means of getting ahead. Unfortunately in my opinion this generally had the opposite approach as after the initial honeymoon was over with the game, you quickly learned to trust no one. If you were in a dungeon and someone came running up, you began to take evasive action. If you were a miner, ore may be what you're after but you knew to just leave it behind if someone came running up, and just get out fast.<p>It isn't my opinion that PvP in of itself causes that reaction, because there were times when I fell on the other side of the line, but I think it's all in the approach. Early in UO, there were virtually no consequences for doing it, and so it quickly spiraled out of control until the developers ended up with a virtual pvp toggle. <p>The problem that Origin noted was that while they and even some players, myself included, had hoped for more villain type characters, what they ended up with were a large amount of <em>griefers</em> whos purpose was as basic as killing you, just for the sake of it, and doing it anyway they could, including using exploits and third party programs. Unfortunately it took Origin a long time to understand that their players didn't want to be killed wherever they went and began to take action, which eventually meant that PvP in the game was made wholly consenual.<p>The problem was NOT in PvP itself, but that reputation was almost entirely a server tracked thing, meaning the people who may have actually played the villain role, and do contribute to communities, were tossed into the same basket as those who just would take 10 people and kill a miner in a deserted cave. People talk about players enforcing these things, but in the case of UO, a game where they naively believed players could deal with it, there were virtually no tools to do so.<p>One idea would be to use player feedback on other players, such that the game punishes people who are truly viewed negatively by other people, and rewards people who are respected on either side of the law. Basically a simple thumbs up or thumbs down with some threshold on the lower end where if someone has a bad game tracked reputation and a bad player reputation they face serious consequences. The idea of course to promote villains with respect over mindless slaughter.<p>Another <strong>major</strong> aspect to the development of the UO communities that did in fact exist, was player housing and participation by the GM staff. Player housing allows players and groups of players to setup roots of their own. GM participation allowed some players to truly setup shop by customizing the homes and shops and as a result, each shard had very distinct communities. While the players including myself took a lot of those things for granted, time has shown just how ahead of the curve Origin was in these areas.<p><BIG>Worlds Apart</BIG><p>Everquest is a vastly different game than UO is and the approaches taken are wildly different. First let's examine the outside of game communities that Everquest has. For the most part these comes down to server and class specific messageboards. About the most interesting bit on them specifically, not anything Sony does or encourages is the differences in the various messageboards. Some classes are very quick to overreact, while others you have to poke them with a stick a number of times to be able to tell if they even still have a heartbeat, because while they may be active, they don't react or overreact to things.<p>It of course asks a much larger question about wether certain types of people select certain classes. My own story in this regard is that for a long time, I absolutely hated dark elf necromancers, simply because virtually all of my bad experiences involved them. I pretty much assumed that they were all jerks and idiots, and avoided them. Of course now I know they all aren't jerks and idiots, because I have the few that aren't in my guild to give my clerics mana, but even at the time it was an interesting question to me, do certain types of people pick certain classes? (ps. Whiners = Monks)<p>Back in beta I assume and early after the games release, there was a lot more contribution by the games developers compared to these days where it's pretty much only to address any major issues. That isn't to say that the communities themselves haven't changed to encourage that, because they have become much more cynical and far less friendly to developers than before, which is probably a trend in all games to date of this nature. There is the time before release and just after release where they contribute a lot but then over time it begins to tail off until you end up where EQ is, which is basically us versus them, players versus developers, and you see very little intermixing of the two.<p>What was interesting to me is that the cynicism of the players isn't the sole reason you might not see as much Absor as you did in the past, or that you should probably soak up all the Moorgard posts that you can prior to EQ2s release, you see, Sony unlike Origin has actual guidelines and such for creating a game community outside of the game, well before the games release. You can actually view their ideas <a href="http://www.legendmud.org/raph/gaming/gdc_2002_community_files/frame.htm" target="_new">here</a>. This contains a lot of interesting views into the brains of the people behind the game. I'm going to examine a few tidbits here and there...<p><strong>- Don't share this info with your users :) <br>- Realize that you are going to need someone who is a politician.</strong><p>Sorry about the first one there, and the second one is interesting although I'm not going to dig into it today. If you view the <em>Go Live!</em> slide, you'll see this...<p><strong>- You may have to gag your evangelist now </strong><p>Which of course makes you understand some things that I talked about above. Overall, you sort of get sort of a slimy sense reading through that sort of stuff, because while on one hand, we all have to accept the fact that Sony and other companies are businesses, and fact is they don't necessarily make games because they all love them and have their heart in it, but as players you still I suppose want to believe otherwise.<p>In game, it's been a different story, since Sony and the people who originally developed the game didn't give a tremendous amount of thought towards creating communities in game. At it's core, and one of the reasons it is so successful is that EQ is a character advancement game, as opposed to a virtual world game. That isn't to say that they are mutually exclusive, but comparing EQ to UO, one is advancement, the other is a virtual world type game.<p>In theory one might think like I did prior to EQ going live that, the fact players can't kill each other, that that fact alone would encourage communities, since you wouldn't necessarily have not trust anyone like in UO. In reality, the lack of PvP combined with players competing for resources, which in EQs case mean spawns, creates a negative community, where groups of players be it a literal single group of people, or large raids, end up conflicting with each other as they compete for the relatively limited game resources.<p>This conflict does strengthen the groups involved, but still creates a very negative atmosphere. As I alluded to above, community isn't simply about people getting along, but there isn't really a valid reason in the case of Everquest for the way things have always been. Arguably in the beginning, the developers weren't aware of this, and it wasn't an issue for awhile but it's increasingly been one as the game has grown up.<p>All of that being said, the game does encourage grouping, or has always tried to atleast. There have been other game aspects that were said to be there or not there to encourage people to communicate. An example of this was binding before the soulbinders existed. That idea, that you force players to get another player to bind them was not not the greatest way to go about doing that, since there were many times when a person who could not bind, could not find anyone to bind them. Throwing soulbinders up also probably wasn't the best way to solve the issue as you could have just as easily had them require payment, giving players two options, try to get a free/cheaper bind from players, or pay up to the soulbinder.<p>One final issue with Everquest is that since it isn't a virtual world type of game, there are next to no tools for players to setup their roots in any one spot, such as player houses and the like. EQ2 seeks to solve some of these issues, but I get the feeling what it gains in this area, it's going to lose in the advancement one.<p><BIG>Sociology 101</BIG><p>So after all that, what's the secret formula? That my friends is the question and there are probably a half dozen teams working on games who are trying to come up with their own answers to it.<p>Each game is different, and it's hard to always draw<br>parellels between games and real life but you can still examine some aspects of real life communities and move them over to the games.<p>An example I noted above is the resource system UO used. The problem of course is that people do not act in game like they do in real life, but using resources to encourage communities is one step. <p>The real life comparison here is to look at where cities have appeared through history. It's best to setup a community in a place with resources to support it, which is why places such as along rivers are where a lot of cities were formed. <p>Now, in the case of a PvP game, you need to put the tools to police it, in the hands of the players for the most part, although it must be setup properly. For example in the thumbs up and thumbs down player reputation idea I gave above, it's a given that if a true villain sort kills 10 people in a week, half might give them a thumbs down, so it would require tuning such that votes are weighted properly over time and you don't punish people who do contribute.<p>In the case of a PvE game, you want to avoid player collision where possible. This of course is when people are competing for the same resources, which are game spawns. This isn't a big issue in all areas, for example in a low level area in EQ, there isn't a need to instance those, and dungeons generally don't either. The point isn't to seperate players from each other but to remove the competition for the resources that cause issues (and as a result, tax customer support).<p>In a world type game, the example would be to have concentrations of resources with areas fairly closeby that could be used for player housing. On top of that would be more tools for players to police each other as far as reputation and punishment goes. The main idea is that you let the community form on its own and it should. Using ore for smithing as an example, if you have mines with a good supply of ore, the first people who will come there, will be the miners of course. At this point it might just be a cave in the middle of nowhere, but players will come if it's worth it.<p>Soon if things are balanced properly (it's easy to say that), the miners will start to setup camps nearby and other players would come to support them. For example sort of using UO as the guideline, if you have miners, you might get smiths coming to deal with them. You might get merchants who buy and sell from the smiths, and then you end up getting adventurers, and on and on. The point is that you need to give players the tools and the reason to create a community, and chances are you'll get something as a result although it is many times impossible to predict what, which is half the fun for the players. The best approach is probably to just plant the seed and let players take it from there.<p>So, after rambling on for so long, I'd like to hear what you think, is it possible to have mostly positive communities in a MMOG, and if so, how?</font>
