			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have started and abandoned several posts over the past few weeks. I knew I needed to write something&#8230; but what story did I want to tell? An angry tirade about being screwed over? A scathing tell-all about what really happened inside 38? A self-pitying plea for a job? So many emotions inside me, a turbid swirl screaming for an outlet.</p>
<p>So this is what I&#8217;ve come up with.</p>
<p><span id="more-703"></span></p>
<p>It has been nearly a month since all of this began. Try to picture that; a month ago, everything seemed fine. Over the past 30 days, so many rugs have been pulled out from under me and my colleagues that I&#8217;ve lost count of the threads. We&#8217;ve lost our income, our insurance, our camaraderie. It&#8217;s been one slap in the face after another, and 38&#8242;s bankruptcy keeps finding new ways to hurt us all; just yesterday, we found out that our 401K funds are frozen for an indeterminate amount of time. I have no doubt that things will get more painful before they get better.</p>
<p>Emotions? Had &#8216;em all. Screaming rage, blinding tears, pity for myself, pity for others, defiance, numbness, fear. To an outsider, I can see how some of this might seem silly. It&#8217;s just a video game, right? People lose their jobs all the time&#8211;suck it up and find another one.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s just not that simple. I&#8217;ve spent nearly six years of my life building this company and working on this game. I&#8217;ve forged some very deep, personal bonds with the people I&#8217;ve worked with. Over this time, my life has changed in profound ways. I&#8217;ve seen my child come into this world. I nearly lost her and my wife in a fatal car crash. I&#8217;ve held my mother in my arms as she lay dying. And through all those things, I&#8217;ve been helped and comforted by Curt Schilling and my teammates at 38.</p>
<p>Work was tough and the pressure relentless, but so, so joyous as well. I got to work hands-on with R. A. Salvatore, taking the framework of a world he created and building it into something huge, ambitious, and wonderful. I watched amazing artists undertake the most startling transformation of concept paintings into game assets that I&#8217;ve ever seen. Stories born as mere fragments of ideas were coming to life all around me in a studio full of people who embraced their role as storytellers.  It was immensely gratifying.</p>
<p>And then it was gone. The poultice ripped away, a mortal wound left to fester. The grief is very real; this may sound melodramatic to those of you on the outside, but this experience feels much like the death of a dear friend. I&#8217;ve said before that shipping a game after years of work makes you feel like you&#8217;ve been through a war, and the people you fought alongside are the only ones who really know what you&#8217;ve been through. In this case, to work six years on a dream and have it almost come to life, only to lose it suddenly, is a very real psychological trauma. Despite the dozens of articles written on the demise of 38, the only people who really understand are the ones who make up this now fractured fraternity that was once a great team.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been hard to find the time necessary to process it all. As soon as the downward spiral began, we were plunged into a frantic period of resume building, job fairs, phone calls, and unemployment filings. The week of E3 was the first stretch where things got quiet&#8211;disturbingly quiet. For me, not yet having secured a new job, that&#8217;s when the anxiety really took hold.</p>
<p>Even after growing numb to the headlines and news broadcasts, little stings come along with clever ways to hurt me. I still find myself looking at my phone for new email. It used to be that pretty much any hour of the day or night, there was something to read: a bug report, a piece of art to approve, some copy to review, a silly thread on our miscellaneous list, or a NSFW link from a cohort. The absence of that 38 mailbox aches like a phantom limb.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still angry about lots of things (did I mention being screwed out of thousands of dollars?), and I still get so very sad when I think of all that could have been. But mostly I&#8217;ve reached acceptance. Not an acceptance of being at peace&#8211;I don&#8217;t think I can ever be at peace with what happened&#8211;but more an acceptance of resignation, the realization that things are so utterly fucked up as to be completely beyond my control. There&#8217;s simply nothing I can do to save the company, to save the story of Amalur, to recover anything that I&#8217;ve lost. All I can do at this point is to look out for my brothers and sisters, the comrades I&#8217;ve been in the trenches with for all these years. I can try to help them however I can, even as I scramble to find my own landing place. Because if there&#8217;s one truth I&#8217;ve learned over all my years of work, across the many careers I&#8217;ve undertaken, it&#8217;s that the connections you make with good people end up being the greatest treasure.</p>
<p>I have lost something that I deeply loved. I&#8217;m constantly surrounded by reminders of that loss, both in the abstract sense, in stories online and in the media, and by the literal presence of boxes surrounding the desk where I write this post, boxes filled with the books, toys, and bric-a-brac that used to decorate my office at One Empire Plaza. The body doesn&#8217;t feel cold yet, but I have to bury it and move on.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s what I must do. I have to let go. That doesn&#8217;t mean the emotions won&#8217;t be there&#8211;those demons will swirl around inside me for a long, long time. But I have to look forward, to restore belief in my talents and abilities, to focus on building a new future. To be sure, it won&#8217;t be the future I planned six years ago&#8211;that dream is gone. But it will be something good, something new to love, something new to believe in. Because I&#8217;ve learned a private truth, a truth I probably tried to deny for a long time: I&#8217;m a person who needs to believe in something bigger than myself.</p>
<p>Despite all the pain, this lesson is a positive I can carry with me for the rest of my days. And that&#8217;s a tangible blessing, a gift to help me smile through the tears.</p>
<p>Goodbye, 38. Goodbye, Amalur. I have loved you more dearly than I can ever say. And I will let you go.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As of today, everyone at 38 Studios Providence and Baltimore has been laid off.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very sad end to nearly six years of great work. Despite the odds, I believed in the dream we all shared. I believed with all my heart.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure the public will ever know the beauty of what we built&#8230; that&#8217;s maybe the hardest part of it all. We snuck out a pretty, but dated, environment fly-through and a few key images, but there is so much more that would take your breath away. I truly hope you get to see it, in some form.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what will happen to Amalur. It will no doubt be tied up in various legal proceedings for some time, both game assets and the intellectual property as a whole.</p>
<p>As people lay blame and the commentators turn a heartbreaking situation into the latest industry punchline, some will probably portray the team as a bunch of screw-ups who couldn&#8217;t ship a game. The story has so, so much more to it than that. In short order, you will start hearing truths, half-truths, and lies, as well as things that are true from a certain perspective. In the end, perspectives are what makes up history&#8230; real truth lies in the midst of it somewhere.</p>
<p>Perhaps someday I&#8217;ll talk more about my perspective&#8230; but not today.</p>
<p>Today, I mourn for what almost was. Because believe it or not, we came <em>so close </em>to pulling it off.</p>
<p>On to the next dream.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over at 38 Studios, we&#8217;ve been working on a game for a few years now. We are very proud of the stuff we&#8217;ve done.

<p>This is just a glimpse of the world of Amalur as it comes alive in our MMO, codenamed Project Copernicus.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The playable demo for <a title="Reckoning!" href="http://reckoning.amalur.com/" target="_blank">Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning</a> (our fun and gorgeous single-player RPG) drops on January 17 for PC, 360, and PS3. If you play the demo as well as the demo for <a title="N7 4 1yf3!" href="http://www.masseffect.com/" target="_blank">Mass Effect 3</a> (another fantastic RPG you may have heard something about), <a title="Hell yes!" href="http://kotaku.com/5875094/i-reckon-mass-effect-3-in+game-goodies-will-do-wonders-for-the-kingdoms-of-amalur-demo/gallery/1" target="_blank">you unlock awesome items for your characters</a>.</p>
<p>Why is this cool? Well, it&#8217;s like being paid to play demos for two of the best games of 2012. It&#8217;s also cool because of the thought and attention put into this idea. The details were lovingly nurtured, down to the symbols that appear on the armor. There&#8217;s a story in everything.</p>
<p>Reckoning is the gateway to <a title="The one true world." href="http://www.amalur.com/" target="_blank">Amalur</a>, the setting for our upcoming MMO as well. I&#8217;m proud to have worked on these games, and can&#8217;t wait until they&#8217;re in players hands!</p>
<p>The time draws near&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a big freaking list. Either I&#8217;m getting worse at narrowing down my choices for favorite albums, or maybe it really was just that good a year. There were a ton of releases I really liked, with an exciting blend of new talent along with reliable veterans making some of their best records in ages.</p>
<p>The downside of this phenomenon is that it takes me a hell of a long time to write this annual music post, and I&#8217;m inherently lazy. But man, there&#8217;s some music here I just really have to talk about. So here we go.</p>
<p><span id="more-669"></span><strong>&gt;&gt; Like It &lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>She Wants Revenge &#8211; <em>Valleyheart</em></strong><em> </em>- Though their latest effort is less consistent than their first two records, there are enough good songs on <em>Valleyheart</em> to justify further faith in the band. When they&#8217;re at their best, they  explore the obsessive/compulsive side of sex and love. When the band  misses the mark, it&#8217;s because they get a bit too self-indulgent. I hope a  little more darkness creeps into their next record.</p>
<p><strong>St. Vincent &#8211; <em>Strange Mercy</em></strong> &#8211; I must admit this was one of the records I was waiting all year to hear, because the last album, <em>Actor</em>, was unadulterated brilliance. <em>Strange Mercy</em> is a bit more grounded and, in places, slower moving than its  predecessor. Still a really strong record, though I&#8217;m not sure anything  could live up to my expectations. Honestly, I&#8217;m trying not to sound like  a downer&#8211;this is great stuff&#8211;but I can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s gripped me as much  as I&#8217;d hoped.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Waits -<em> Bad As Me</em></strong><em> </em>- If you&#8217;re intimidated by  the huge and varied back catalog of Tom Waits but want to dive in and  discover what all the fuss is about, <em>Bad As Me</em> makes a fantastic  entry point. Waits sounds as gravelly as ever, and the songs here are as  accessible as anything he&#8217;s done before.</p>
<p><strong>Lights &#8211; <em>Siberia</em></strong><em> </em>- How does a Canadian electronica act make my annual list of favorite records? By releasing an album of catchy, danceable anthems that happen to be great pop songs. It doesn&#8217;t hurt that Valerie Anne Poxleitner has the kind of spare, hypnotic vocals that I find so intriguing.  The production here is tight and direct, emphasizing the charm but  retaining a hint of the bleak landscape that gives the album its title.</p>
<p><strong>The Lonely Island &#8211; <em>Turtleneck &amp; Chain</em></strong> &#8211; Usually, musical comedy albums have a pretty short shelf life for me.  Exceptions to this rule&#8211;including records by Flight of the Conchords  and the Lonely Island&#8211;are because the songs are more than funny; they  are legitimately catchy. To successfully spoof any art form, you have to  understand its principles. The Lonely Island knows its stuff, and  peppers in enough guest stars to keep the album timely and relevant. Did  I mention these are just plain good songs? Sure, some are better than  others, but the stand-outs make the disc worth the listen.</p>
<p><strong>Amy Winehouse &#8211; <em>Lioness: Hidden Treasures</em></strong> &#8211; In a better world, this year&#8217;s list would include Amy&#8217;s second or third new album since her breakthrough <em>Back to Black</em>,  and I&#8217;d be raving about her continued genius. Sadly, we live in this  world, where Winehouse was unable to overcome debilitating addictions  that eventually took her life. So instead we&#8217;re left with bits and  pieces, fragments of what might have been. This is a great collection,  but its flavor is unquestionably bittersweet. Oh, what might have been.</p>
<p><strong>The Airborne Toxic Event &#8211; <em>All at Once</em> </strong>- After a solid  debut album a couple years back, the ATE returned with an even better  follow-up. The influences are quite varied, with some cuts sounding a  bit like Joy Division/early New Order while others are much more joyous  and relaxed. A great alternative pop record that isn&#8217;t ashamed to get  your feet tapping.</p>
<p><strong>EMA &#8211; <em>Past Life Martyred Saints</em></strong> &#8211; Critical darling EMA may  be a young PJ Harvey in the making. She&#8217;s not there yet, but Erika M.  Anderson has all the right ingredients: angst, edginess, and axes to  grind. Her debut solo album is loose enough to take the listener in a  lot of different directions; it will be interesting to see which path  EMA ventures down in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Apex Manor &#8211; <em>The Year of Magical Drinking</em></strong> &#8211; This was  one of the first albums I bought in 2011, and it remained a solid listen  all year long. Apex Manor veers from catchy indie pop to  Replacements-style raunchiness, all with a directness and charm that  feels absolutely genuine. Don&#8217;t let this album slip under your radar.</p>
<p><strong>The Decemberists &#8211; <em>The King is Dead</em></strong> &#8211; There are few  bands in the universe more charming than the Decemberists&#8211;seeing them  live even once will convince you of this. Yet their last couple records  have been a bit disappointing to me, trading the brilliant naivete of <em>Picaresque</em> for heavier-handed, over-produced material. <em>The King is Dead</em> is a return to form, focusing on catchy songs that tell great stories.  That&#8217;s exactly what I hope for from a Decemberists record.</p>
<p><strong>Foo Fighters &#8211; <em>Wasting Light</em></strong> &#8211; Despite Courtney Love&#8217;s  eternal ire, Foo Fighters have released some of the most solid and  dependable alternative/pop records of the last 15 years. Yet rarely have  they felt as well-crafted and complete as this year&#8217;s <em>Wasting Light</em>,  a project rich with the band&#8217;s penchant for catchy hooks and soaring  choruses. Whatever has fueled Dave Grohl&#8217;s ambitions, I hope he consumes  more of it, because this set is catchy and tight with nary a wasted  note. And having the legendary Bob Mould appear on the infectious &#8220;Dear  Rosemary&#8221; was a work of perfect pop genius.</p>
<p><strong>Gillian Welch &#8211; <em>The Harrow &amp; the Harvest</em> </strong>- Welch  has been around a long time, both as a solo artist and as a collaborator  with the likes of Ryan Adams, the Decemberists, and countless others.  Her latest effort is a charming folk/country affair that highlights what  she&#8217;s best at: writing great, moving songs. You&#8217;ll find no artifice  here, but plenty of direct, engaging art.</p>
<p><strong>Zola Jesus- <em>Conatus</em></strong> &#8211; Another relative newcomer, Nika Roza  Danilova blends goth, electronica, and a hint of prog into a layered  sound that belies her years. The sound is so thick in places that you  have to cut through it with a knife, but as you dig deeper you find more  and more that captivates. Treat this record like a treasure hunt or just let the music wash over you&#8211;your choice.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Love It &lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bon Iver &#8211; <em>Bon Iver</em></strong> &#8211; How do you follow up a record as iconic and intensely personal as 2008&#8242;s brilliant <em>For Emma, Forever Ago</em>?  In Bon Iver&#8217;s case, you maintain the emotional heart while expanding  upon the cabin-in-the-woods sound of the first album. This would be a  tricky act for anyone to pull off, but Justin Vernon and crew make it  sound effortless. The fuller production never gets in the way of songs  that just take hold and refuse to let go. Having cleared this sophomore  hurdle, the future is wide open for this band.</p>
<p><strong>Elbow &#8211; <em>Build a Rocket Boys!</em></strong> &#8211; If Elbow had no greater  ambitions than to be a Peter Gabriel cover band, they probably could  have made a pretty good living, since singer Guy Garvey has a rare  ability to match the former Genesis frontman&#8217;s range and tone with eerie  precision. Instead, thankfully, Elbow has opted to make clever and  challenging records that can appeal to the art-house crowd while still  blending into a post-Coldplay world. The songs range from soaring and  inspiring to gritty and burrowing, a balanced blend that conveys an  impressive range of talent.</p>
<p><strong>Brendan Perry &#8211; <em>Ark</em></strong><em> </em>- Maybe it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s  been so long since the last Dead Can Dance record, but there is  something delightful about this album that was lacking on Perry&#8217;s first  solo effort, <em>Eye of the Hunter</em>. Sure, <em>Ark</em> is rich with  Perry&#8217;s signature mopey croon, and the lyrics still dance on the  precipice of pretentiousness, but there&#8217;s also a joyfulness and  immediacy to the songs that I find compelling. The usual array of exotic  instruments and sounds is here, but this time out it&#8217;s tempered by  layered synthesizers and danceable beats. Give this record a shot and  you could find something unexpectedly delightful.</p>
<p><strong>Cults &#8211; <em>Cults</em></strong><em> </em>- If, on first listen, you had  told me that this catchy wall-of-sound record was crafted in the 60s by  legendary producer and psychopath Phil Spector, I probably would have  believed you. But digging deeper uncovers a pop-punk sensibility that  brings this collection of crisp songs into the modern age. If you can  resist shaking your thang to this infectious album, I think there&#8217;s  probably something wrong with you.</p>
<p><strong>Iron &amp; Wine &#8211; <em>Kiss Each Other Clean; Morning Becomes Eclectic</em></strong> -  I must confess that, if I had my druthers, I&#8217;d lock Sam Beam in a  room with an acoustic guitar and a four-track recorder and wouldn&#8217;t let  him out until he&#8217;d produced a handful of albums that sounded like the  epic and wonderful <em>Our Endless Numbered Days</em>. While <em>Kiss Each Other Clean</em> proves once again that Beam is as great a songwriter as anyone working  today, its dense production styles makes me long for the less refined  sound of his earlier efforts. The KCRW <em>Morning Becomes Eclectic</em> serves as a testament to the purity of the core songs, as the live  format really makes the material shine. At the risk of sounding like a  musical Luddite, I hope Iron &amp; Wine returns to a more stripped-down  sound in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Kate Bush &#8211; <em>Director&#8217;s Cut; 50 Words for Snow</em></strong> &#8211; To describe Kate Bush as influential is  the greatest of  understatements; you need only look at many of the other acts on this  list to see plenty of examples of how much she has shaped a whole  generation of talent. Though prolific in her early years, she&#8217;s been  heartbreakingly quiet in the past decade plus. So when she released <em>Director&#8217;s Cut</em> earlier in the year, we had to assume that this collection of revised  cuts from two earlier albums would have to tie us over for a few years.  That wasn&#8217;t so bad, since the album brought some much-needed freshness  to some great songs that suffered from 1990s production values. Yet much  to my surprise, Kate was true to her claim that new music would be  coming soon by releasing <em>50 Words for Show</em> before the end of the  year. Despite the title, it&#8217;s not a Christmas album, although winter is  certainly a major thematic element. Instead of carols, you&#8217;ll find  Kate&#8217;s gorgeous voice delivering some lovely new songs, mostly featuring  piano and vocals. Though my favorite of her albums remains the epic <em>Hounds of Love</em>, the new effort has enough interesting twists to prove that Kate has what it takes to inspire yet another generation.</p>
<p><strong>David Sylvian &#8211; <em>Died in the Wool</em></strong><em> </em>- For an artist  who isn&#8217;t fond of looking back on previous work, Sylvian has been doing  a lot of it lately. With this collection, he turns his recent <em>Manafon </em>album  over to composer Dai Fujikura, who took the spare original tracks and  layered in classical arrangements. The strategy mostly works, though I  confess I enjoyed the open feeling of the original recordings in most  cases. Still, the new songs here are standouts, more than justifying the  existence of <em>Died in the Wool</em>.</p>
<p><strong>My Brightest Diamond &#8211; <em>All Things Will Unwind</em></strong> &#8211; Shara Worden has  covered a vast amount of musical ground with her My Brightest Diamond  project, blending elements of rock and pop and classical with her  amazingly distinct vocals. Her latest focuses more on the classical side  of things, but her lyrics&#8211;as well as the music itself&#8211;run the gamut  from thoughtful to playful. The newest album hasn&#8217;t gripped me quite as much as <em>A Thousand Shark&#8217;s Teeth</em>, but this is the kind of record that works its way slowly under your skin and makes the investment worthwhile.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Gabriel &#8211; <em>New Blood</em></strong> &#8211; Oh look, another aging  artist records classical versions of his old hits. That&#8217;s a formula a  lot of listeners might opt to overlook, but don&#8217;t dismiss this effort so  quickly. As he&#8217;s done before, Gabriel takes what sounds like an old  idea and makes it interesting. There&#8217;s plenty of lush and lovely moments  like &#8220;In Your Eyes&#8221; and &#8220;Mercy Street&#8221;, but the first time I heard  &#8220;Intruder&#8221; I was driving home late on a foggy night and just about peed  my pants at the creepiness of it. Gabriel really did find a way to pump  some new blood into these songs, and the effort is well worth the  listen.</p>
<p><strong>Radiohead &#8211; <em>The King of Limbs; TKOL RMX 1234567</em></strong> &#8211; It was a busy year for Radiohead, with both a new record and a very worthwhile remix set released (they sneaked out a live  DVD as well). There&#8217;s no question the band remains hugely influential,  but are they still fresh and relevant? I say yes&#8211;the songs here are  just so damned compelling that you almost can&#8217;t help but be drawn in.  Radiohead somehow takes a modern sound and layers it with the feel of  jazz improv. It&#8217;s a siren&#8217;s call that consistently makes me want more.</p>
<p><strong>Wild Flag &#8211; <em>Wild Flag</em></strong> &#8211; Music remains inherently tied to image and artifice; that&#8217;s part of its charm as well as its detriment. So when a band comes along that eschews  image and focuses on the simple things that make rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll so great  and enduring, you just have to go with it. The gals of Wild Flag bring  with them an impressive indie rock pedigree, but all that would mean  nothing if the songs here weren&#8217;t so damned awesome. There&#8217;s no fakery  or posing to be found here; simply put, they will rock the shit out of  you. And I think that&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Gotta Have It &lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fleet Foxes &#8211; <em>Helplessness Blues</em></strong> &#8211; After a fantastic  debut album, a group has nowhere to go but down on the next one, right?  In the case of Fleet Foxes, that assumption couldn&#8217;t be more wrong.  Somehow the band manages yet another collection of rousing, touching  songs with vocal harmonies that seem almost impossibly surreal&#8211;like  they come from some other planet. <em>Helplessness Blues</em> has a timeless quality that is both classic and modern. Don&#8217;t question it; just listen.</p>
<p><strong>The Knux &#8211; <em>Eraser</em></strong><em> </em>- On this ridiculously catchy  record, the Knux effortlessly blend hip-hop with the purest pop-punk  sensibility. There is nothing wasted here&#8211;just three chords, catchy  beats, and hooks galore. If it weren&#8217;t for the foul language  necessitating a warning sticker, this album could (and should) have been  all over the radio. I defy you to listen to these songs without tapping  your toes at the very least. More than likely, you&#8217;ll be shaking what  the good lore gave ya.</p>
<p><strong>Florence + the Machine &#8211; <em>Ceremonials</em></strong><em> </em>- At the  risk of repeating myself, here&#8217;s another act that had the potential to  flounder a follow-up to a hugely successful first record, yet managed to  knock it out of the park. <em>Ceremonials</em> takes the best of what  went before and kicks it up a notch. The beats are bigger, the anthems  more anthemic, and the soaring vocals simply rocket out of the  stratosphere. Florence is an artist who, instead of sliding by on past  popularity, took what she&#8217;d earned and poured 100% of it back into her  craft. An amazing album.</p>
<p><strong>TV On the Radio &#8211; <em>Nine Types of Light</em></strong> &#8211; This is another  band that&#8217;s hard to categorize thanks to their effortless blending of  varied musical styles. Yet nothing feels forced or unnatural here; the  band has perfected its own sound that simply works. Underneath it all  are solid songs that rock when they should and are poignant when they  need to be. This album covers an expanse of musical ground, yet it all  just feels right. What a great band.</p>
<p><strong>The Black Keys &#8211; <em>El Camino</em></strong> &#8211; On another collaboration with producer Danger Mouse, the Black Keys deliver their signature blend of blues, funk, and 70s power rock&#8211;this time with a somewhat greater emphasis on the latter. Why change a formula that works? Their songs are catchy and fun, with sexy grooves that conjure Bad Company and even Led Zeppelin in their heyday. The Keys aren&#8217;t reinventing the wheel here, but they have honed their craft and are writing the best songs of their career. This is a great album.</p>
<p><strong>PJ Harvey &#8211; <em>Let England Shake</em></strong> &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure if PJ has  been listening to a Matt Johnson marathon, but not since The The&#8217;s  classic albums of the late 80s/early 90s has there been so crisp and  direct a musical criticism of the UK&#8217;s politics and customs. Harvey has  never sounded better, somehow staying absolutely fresh and vital. Proof  that great songs can be both instantly catchy and thought-provokingly  deep. Runner-up for my album of the year.</p>
<p><strong>The Civil Wars &#8211; <em>Barton Hollow</em></strong> &#8211; Once in a while a band comes along that sounds like it&#8217;s been together for a thousand years, where everything they do sounds inherent to their very being, with nothing forced or unnatural. The Civil Wars are such a group. The songs on <em>Barton Hollow</em> are instantly gripping and mesmerizing, rising above a folk/country/pop crowd in effortless and ethereal fashion. Every piece on this record is like a soundtrack to its own film, gripping and personal and haunting. This is one of those records that fills you with wistfulness, longing, and just about every kind of emotion. Throughout the year, this is the one I&#8217;ve come back to time and time again. My record of the year.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;d imagine most people still aware that this blog exists realize that I have been working for 38 Studios for the last five years (yeah, it&#8217;s been that long!). We&#8217;ve been very quiet about the specifics of what we&#8217;re doing, other than that we set out to make an MMO, acquired an excellent RPG team, relocated to Providence, and are set to release <a title="Best. RPG. Ever." href="http://reckoning.amalur.com/" target="_blank">Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning</a> in February. So all in all, an eventful half-decade.</p>
<p>All the while we&#8217;ve continued the labor of love that is our MMO, though we remain quiet about it. We&#8217;re going to remain so for a bit longer, but we&#8217;ve started to take the wrapper off more and more of the world behind the games. The deepest dive into the lore of the world comes in the form of our new <a title="Sweet baby!" href="http://www.amalur.com" target="_blank">Amalur.com website</a>.</p>
<p>This is a big deal to me, as I&#8217;m personally curating the writing as we take the mounds of internal documentation and fashion it for an outside audience. Our artists and web designers are doing some beautiful work, and the site will be evolving and expanding *a lot* over time. The first content drop is over 16,000 words, but we&#8217;ve barely scratched the surface of the material we&#8217;ve got to share.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting about the Amalur.com project is that the site isn&#8217;t made to promote a specific product. Rather, it&#8217;s a gateway to exploring a deeper history than any single title could portray. If we do our jobs right, Amalur.com will help reinforce the connections between products within a single consistent universe.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don&#8217;t get around much anymore&#8211;in blog posts, I mean. But hey, as long as I can stay ahead of <a title="Lazier than I am!" href="http://www.hartsman.com/" target="_blank">Hartsman</a> (who, as a big-money executive, does no actual work and thus lacks any excuse for not blogging), I figure I&#8217;m doing okay.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m headed down to New York Comic Con this week for a panel scheduled on Friday at 1:30 pm called <a title="Come one, come all" href="http://nycc11.mapyourshow.com/5_0/sessions/sessiondetails.cfm?ScheduledSessionID=1BAFC8" target="_blank">Creating a World Worth Saving</a>. I&#8217;ll be joining our own Creator of Worlds, R.A. Salvatore, plus Andrew Auseon and Ian Frazier from the <a title="Hey, you can preorder it" href="http://www.reckoning.com" target="_blank">Reckoning</a> team. We&#8217;ll talk both theory and practice of how you develop a world meant to span a whole ecosystem of products, and in specific about how we used those principles to craft the narrative of the RPG.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still <em>slightly </em>too early to reveal hard facts about our MMO, but I&#8217;ll sneak some storyline tidbits in there. Until our PR guy tackles me and drags me from the stage, that is.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m in California for the first time in years to attend E3. I haven&#8217;t been to the show since the height of its excess, before it was neutered. Though still manic and bombastic, it feels noticeably less chaotic to me. I have memories (now fond, at the time not so much) of being hoarse each night after trying to shout my demo script for visitors at the SOE booth because I was competing with blaring sound systems from other booths. While communication still requires some effort on the show floor, it seems considerably easier than I remember it.</p>
<p>The show will never again inspire the awe and wonder I experienced the first time I attended, but it&#8217;s cool nonetheless. Activision&#8217;s reveal of the MW3 trailer was a dramatic event that had the crowd breathless in anticipation. Sony and Nintendo hardware had a ton of folks checking it out. Smaller projects drew attention as well&#8211;World of Tanks had an actual tank on display.</p>
<p>The show had its share of underwhelming displays as well, but that&#8217;s to be expected. Overall E3 remains a genuine event, a chance for the games industry to show off a bit in the shadow of Hollywood.</p>
<p>The coolest bit for me was checking out the Reckoning booth and seeing our team demo the RPG. I&#8217;m really excited about players getting to learn more about our world. And seeing the latest trailer playing on EA&#8217;s gigantic booth screen gave me chills.</p>
<p>Guess I&#8217;m just a sucker for the pageantry of it all.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s very easy for game designers to come up with lofty, complex ideas. This is especially true for people who take a support role on one project and suddenly find themselves in charge of something on another title; they get the impulse to put their stamp on everything, to show the world how clever they are by embroiling players in complex plots and multi-layered gameplay.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the best thing you can do is take a step back and simplify things.</p>
<p>Every night at dinner, I get asked by my toddler, &#8220;Daddy, what did you do at work today?&#8221; My answers vary, but often I mention how I looked at pictures of monsters (character art review), saw some fantastic place (environment art review), read a story about some great battle (narrative review), and so forth. Occasionally I even get to talk about something I wrote myself! If I say I looked at a monster, I&#8217;m asked &#8220;Was he good or bad?&#8221; If I say bad, I&#8217;m asked &#8220;What does he want to get?&#8221; And I usually give a little story about that creature&#8217;s motivations.</p>
<p>After this ritual had been going on a while, it suddenly struck me how incredibly useful this was to me as a storyteller and designer. If I can&#8217;t boil the plots and motivations of our characters down into simple terms that a child can understand, we&#8217;ve probably over-designed the experience&#8211;which means grown-up players won&#8217;t get it, either.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say stories and gameplay have to be written like an episode of Dora the Explorer. The nuances and depth should be there for those who want to delve into them. But at the base level, the primary motivations of your characters and storylines need to be clear and obvious. Otherwise, all the fancy dialogue and pretty graphics won&#8217;t matter, because the drama of your game won&#8217;t resonate with the audience.</p>
