		<P>Yep, it was Take 2 for CD in Plane of Air on Thursday night. Everyone gathered at Tox spire for the ride up to PoA and hopefully get Nilano his Epic part.</P>
<P>We were all ready to take on the Bzzt! Isle but the Bees had other ideas, before we could organise and attack the Bees aggroed and wiped us out! Tsk tsk. It was getting late and instead of 3 Bees we had 5 to contend with, so decided to call it a night.</P>
<P>We all skydived into Freeport and decided to rid Freeport of its Guards and Priest of Discord, all in all fun.</P>
<P>We will get the Bees next week.</P>
