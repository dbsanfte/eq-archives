		<P><STRONG>for a wig for Siitrom!</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Thats right, this bald hairy toed halfling decided he needed to get some hair. He had heard of Fizzlecutter and his amazing wigs, after a lengthy discussion the gnome let it slip that a fishy dwagon held a secret recipe!</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>He gathered the guild together and led us to the watery Timorous Deeps. After what seemed like a year and half, with some gaining Mastery of swimming during the journey, we made it to the dwagons lair.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Some of us got lost of course, couldnt find the tunnel, couldnt find the giant frikkin tree marking the second tunnel (thanks Oddeh) but in the end we all made it to the tranquil inn.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Siitrom set about making sure everyone heard his orders (DONT SIT!), and went to great lengths to make sure everyone understood them (DONT SING!) and even repeated them a few times (DONT DO ANYTHING!!) so that those sleeping in the back heard them (JUST STAND!!!). Remarkably, CD seemed to be paying attention and after a couple of LDs the buffage started and we were ready to wake the dwagon!</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>A flawless battle ensued and there was only a small amount of ping ponging which resulted in Siitrom dying, Rocheforth dying (and looting his corpse <EM>before</EM> getting a res, yes he is our cleric) me dying and some others, but no matter because we beat that ugly fish to paste!</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>So a BIG CONGRATULATIONS to CD for a flawless attack on a dragon, well done everybody, and congratulations to Siitrom on his epic raid and piece :)</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Struan out.</STRONG></P>
