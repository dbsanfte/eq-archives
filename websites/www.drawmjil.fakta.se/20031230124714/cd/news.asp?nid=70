		<P>Well Vindi needed yet another beating and it was swift and painless, we didnt have his pets to deal with but hey :) :) wouldnt have mattered anyways :P Grats to Kerdiir on breastplate.</P>
<P>We then decided to go and give solc ring event a try. Some people got a little bit lost on the way to solc and decided to zone into the wrong entrance and die. not sure who it was though /hides Anyways after being rescued, with my tail between my legs we wandered back to the ring event, on the way we had an interesting pull and alot of mes breaking proceeded and many FFS from Titha, but a few survived the barrage and we ressed up and carried on to the event.</P>
<P>The event went with no problems and the final guy was no real threat and was downed fairly quickly. Grats to me on a new bracer and ballain on some totem thing :) Grats to Kerdiir on a nice shoulder item and Petan on some nick nacks he found :)</P>
<P>All in all not a bad evening all went pretty smoothly and grats to all on loots.</P>
<P>/Caggun</P>
