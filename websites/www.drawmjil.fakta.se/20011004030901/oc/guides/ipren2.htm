        <p><big><strong>Mobs</strong></big></p>
        <p><small><strong>There are 14 different mobs in
        Hate, and each is different.</strong></small></p>
        <p><small><strong>Cleric of Innoruuk</strong> -
        Cleric - They look like a Dark Elf guard. They have high magic resist,
        so harder to mez, and they love to complete heal. They also buff the
        mobs they pass with cleric buffs. Keep them stunned (bash/ slam) while
        fighting and kill them fast. They drop cleric gear. They do not see
        rogues or even normal invisible. They have a normal aggro range.</small></p>
        <p><small><strong>Ire Ghast - </strong>undead Shadow
        Knight - They look like a ghoul and have low magic resist, so easy to
        mez, but love to HarmTouch, and do it a lot. Undead magic works on them.
        They drop some Paladin weapons (mace and sword) and a shield, and can
        also drop the druid shield, though extremely rare. They do not see
        rogues, but do see normal player invisible (although invis to undead
        would work). They have a small aggro range.</small></p>
        <p><small><strong>Revultant Rat - </strong>Warrior -
        They look like a giant diseased rat and have low magic resist, but proc
        Deadly Poison. Only drop is a Ranger Whip. They do not see rogues, but
        may or may not see normal invis (some do, some don't). They have a small
        aggro range.</small></p>
        <p><small><strong>Spite Golem - </strong>Shaman -
        They look like a rock golem. They have insane magic resist (although
        poison, disease, and the wizard Lure spells will usually stick). This is
        the most important target most times. If you get 2, one warrior, usually
        the backup assist, will keep second one busy while the group kills
        number 1. It is possible to kill several, but very, very tough, so be
        careful. They love to cast SoW and other Alacrity on everything close to
        them. They drop shaman armor including a shield, and a druid shield.
        They do not see a rogue, but see everything else. They have a large
        aggro range.</small></p>
        <p><small><strong>Loathing Lich</strong> - undead
        Wizard - They look like a spectre and have very low magic resist but
        more hp than most mobs in Hate, plus are undead so undead magic works
        well, so usually easy kills. But they will cast the wizard damage shield
        (the annoying 2 damage spam shield). They drop a Necromancer rod. They
        DO see a rogue as well as anything else. *** BE CAREFUL *** They have a
        small self-aggro range, but will pass chain-aggro other mobs a very
        large range.</small></p>
        <p><small><strong>Abhorrent</strong> - Rogue - They
        look like gargoyles and have very low magic resist, but love to
        backstab, so make sure the puller is careful pulling them. They drop
        rogue gear. They do not see rogues or normal invisible. They have a
        small aggro range.</small></p>
        <p><small><strong>Haunted Chest</strong> - Warrior -
        They look like a bog box with teeth. They will proc a Nullify Magic, so
        they will strip your buffs. They can drop any armor item from the Planes
        of Fear, and possibly from Hate. They do not see a rogue, but do see
        others. They have an extremely small aggro range and are very slow. When
        pulling, the puller has to stay close, or the box will forget and go
        home. They even aggro other mobs at a very short range. Boxes spawn only
        in fixed locations. They are not on any other spawn table.</small></p>
        <p><small><strong>Kiraikueis</strong> - undead Monk -
        They look like a mummy and have low magic resist. They will proc Strong
        Disease. They are undead, so undead magic works well on them. They drop
        warrior gear and a monk Shuriken. They do not see rogues, but do see
        normal invis, though invis to undead would work. They have a very large
        aggro range, but a small pass-on range, so they will aggro with anything
        close, but not aggro the mobs around them... usually.</small></p>
        <p><small><strong>Scorn Banshee</strong> - undead
        Warrior - They look like a female zombie and have low magic resist, but
        proc Strong Disease and hit a ton. But undead magic works. They drop
        Bard gear. They DO see rogues and all invis, including invis to undead,
        regardless of what con says. *** BE CAREFUL *** They do have a small
        aggro range, though.</small></p>
        <p><small><strong>Forsaken Revanant, Male</strong> -
        undead Magician - They look like male vampires and have normal magic
        resistance. They also cast a mean damage shield and nasty AE direct
        damage. Undead magic does work. They drop mage gear. They do not see
        rogues, but do see normal invis. They have normal aggro range.</small></p>
        <p><small><strong>Forsaken Revanant, Female</strong>
        - undead Enchanter - They look like female vampires and have high magic
        resistance, but they do not cast charm. They do cast a damage shield,
        though. Undead magic works. They drop Enchanter gear. They do not see
        rogues but do see normal invis. They have normal aggro range.</small></p>
        <p><small><strong>Ashenbone Drake</strong> -
        Necromancer - Looks like a skeletal dragon or a small DracoLiche from
        Fear. They have high magic resist and love to cast Fear, plus they hit
        like a tank. They drop a tank axe or a Shadow Knight shield or weapon.
        They do not see rogues, but do see normal invis. They have an insane
        aggro range and have been known to aggro stuff across the zone. Be
        extremely careful on this one's aggro.</small></p>
        <p><small><strong>Maestro of Rancor</strong> - Bard -
        Looks like Lord Mistmoore, but since he hasn't been seen in a long time,
        I guess Mistmoore looks like Maestro. He is a Bard, but since NPCs do
        not use BardSong, you could say he's a warrior. He hits a TON and has an
        ae lifetap on everything in melee range. And if he has dual weapons, he
        hits extremely fast. He normally drops 2 items, mostly Bard stuff,
        though a few monk items and a nice dropable shield. He sees rogues and
        all normal invis, but his back is usually to the door so no problem. He
        is the lesser boss of Hate.</small></p>
        <p><small><strong>Innoruuk</strong> - god - He looks
        like Innoruuk, no other way to say it. He does a DeathTouch every 30
        seconds or so of the fight and loves to cast gravity flux. He has a long
        list of drops, and most of it nice. He sees rogues and will DeathTouch
        you in a heart-beat.</small></p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><big>Spawn Types:</big></strong></p>
        <p><small><strong>Zone-Patrol</strong> - The first
        you will see on porting up is the zone-patrol. Zone-patrol is about 4
        roaming spawns just to make plane breaking more difficult. They will
        spawn on the east wall right behind either house 5 or I and walk the
        east wall S and up into the ceiling. Occasionally, one will stop next to
        a house to buff the mobs inside and then cut at an angle due SW, which
        could lead them into the port room itself, but they do not stay there
        long. However, since they are zone-patrol, they will usually be right
        beside the port room, so porting up could be a problem. Zone-patrol can
        be Cleric, Spite, Ire, or Rat, and in that order of appearance. Repop on
        zone-patrol is the same as static spawns if killed, so about 8 hours. If
        they de-pop themselves, which they do if they make it to the zone-line,
        then the repop is about 30 minutes or so, but since they walk right by
        the zone-in, if you set up camp there, you will get them all. They have
        a less than normal drop rate.</small></p>
        <p><small><strong>Normal Roamers</strong> - There are
        2 patrol routes in Hate, the North and South. The North route is
        basically just as is drawn on the map, except that the mobs will make a
        square just north of the Fountain (house 8 ) and then head back up the
        path to the NW end of it. The South route follows the path but where it
        stops on the south wall, the path actually continues along the south
        wall until past house T, then turns due north until just past the stairs
        in the NW corner of house C (beside house Q), turns east and follow N
        wall of house C to house A, then N around house A and back to meet the
        end of the drawn route. On both of these route, there can be Lich, Rat,
        or Ire. And they are both on a 30 minute timer, so be extremely careful.
        Also, the route can run clockwise or counterclockwise, and the mobs can
        stop mid route and head back. They like to stop on the S wall beside
        houses 2, U, and T, near the NW corner of house C, near the opening
        between A and C, beside house 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2, and near the Totem
        (the black dot between house 3 and 5. In-game, is a pillar of faces with
        flames in their mouths). Be extremely careful with them when near house
        2 as they could easily aggro the stuff in house C. The door to C is
        beside A, so if that happens, everything between C and the zone room
        will aggro. All the roamers have low drop rates, though the Ires seem to
        have the pali items rather frequently. But that could just be because
        there are so many of them.</small></p>
        <p><small><strong>SW Corner</strong> - The SW corner
        is the other favorite pull spot (other than the zone-in room). There are
        3 semi-static spawns there, and they are 2 clerics and a monk. They are
        on a 30 minute timer and have very low drop rates. They are here for one
        reason only... because it was a great pull spot away from most of the
        roamer path. By being a 30 minute spawn, it makes camping here much more
        difficult. I still prefer the zone-in room, even though you have to
        fight with more of the roamer path.</small></p>
        <p><small><strong>Static Spawns</strong> - The ones
        in the houses are static spawns, and even they come in two flavors. Some
        of the houses are huge, so they have fixed spawn points and roamers
        within the houses. Static Spawns have the highest drop rates and are on
        about an 8 hour timer. I will cover houses shortly.</small></p>
        <p><small><strong>Boss Mobs</strong> - This is
        Maestro and Inny. Maestro spawns in the far NW corner of house D in
        front of the organ. Inny is in a room upstairs. Maestro is on the same
        static timer, while Inny is on a 7 day spawn, so usually just after a
        server repop. If the server is reset, or the zone crashes, all mobs in
        Hate are depopped. This is to provide a little safety during reentry.
        When this happens, the timer for the entire zone starts at 0, so 30
        minutes later, all the roamers will pop and the SW corner will pop, then
        about 8 more and the statics and Maestro will pop. So, what players do
        is as soon as the server drops, they head in and setup since they only
        have to dead with the normal roamers and possibly the zone-patrol. They
        then ask for a zone repop, which the gm will do as long as it is ONE
        person that asks, not everyone in the zone.</small></p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><big>Locations</big></strong></p>
        <p><small>House 1 is the zone-in house. In fact, you
        will zone in almost exactly where the 1 is drawn on the map. There are
        no spawns in this room, but the zone-patrol will walk right by the E
        wall (just outside the house). Unless you are in the pull group or told
        otherwise, STAY AWAY FROM THE DOOR. The pull team cannot get into and
        out of the room if everyone is crowded in the doorway. And a fight there
        could aggro the other mobs the puller has. Also, stay away from the N
        wall for a little while, as it could aggro some of the surrounding areas
        or the mobs pulled to pull spot. The entrance is on the NW wall facing N
        (just under the rectangle on the map on the left side of the room...
        that rectangle is only a hall).</small></p>
        <p><small>House 2 has three spawns upstairs. One is
        always a box. The other two can be abhorrents or ires. These do not
        aggro easily since all have short aggro ranges, so pulling past them is
        usually okay. The usually do not aggro on break-in, either. The only way
        the fights or pulls can aggro them is one of the mobs with a large aggro
        range, then it will trigger them as well. It is best to pull this room
        early. The entrance is on the N side.</small></p>
        <p><small>House 3 will always be pulled with the
        zone-patrol aggro. The mobs from zone-patrol will aggro them, so at
        break-in, there will be no less than one from zone-patrol and the two
        from this house. The two in this house are usually an abhorrent and an
        ire. Entrance is on the W side.</small></p>
        <p><small>House 4 has a box upstairs. Do not pull
        this house until at least the first half of house C is clear as it will
        aggro through the wall. Entrance is on the NE side facing E (inside the
        L).</small></p>
        <p><small>House 5 has an abhorrent downstairs and an
        ire or abhorrent upstairs. Upstairs will not aggro from a downstairs
        pull, but it will if you pull from beyond house 5. If you do not pull
        upstairs here, it will autopull when you pull past it anyway. Entrance
        is on the SW side facing W (looking at the door to house 4).</small></p>
        <p><small>House 6 has a box and ire upstairs. These
        will not aggro from pulls around them at all and are usually the only
        mobs left in the zone after a full clearing. They can be pulled or just
        left. Pulls from here could aggro the neighboring rev houses, so it is
        best to leave for a while. Entrance is on the W side.</small></p>
        <p><small>House 7 has a spawn right by the door and
        two more in the back of the house on the SE side. All three spots can be
        abhorrents or ires. Careful here as the S roamers like to stop just
        outside the door to this house, and the N roamers could stop just to the
        N of it. Entrance is on the far SW side closest to house C facing SW.</small></p>
        <p><small>House 8 is not a house, but a fountain or
        well. It is only a landmark.</small></p>
        <p><small>House 9 is the ramp up to Innoruuk's
        chamber. I will cover level 2 later. Ramp starts on E side.</small></p>
        <p><small>House A has a box and monk downstairs, and
        2 abhorrents upstairs. The monk will come as soon as you make a pull
        from anywhere near it, including the chamber. The abhorrents are safe
        until you start pulling larger mobs past it. The box may aggro on pulls,
        but has so short an aggro range it will usually stay there. The entrance
        is on the SW side facing W. You can see the box in the entrance.</small></p>
        <p><small>House B has an abhorrent and monk upstairs
        and the same downstairs. The downstairs monk will always aggro from any
        pull nearby, especially the house C pulls. The upstairs and the
        abhorrent downstairs are usually left for later (especially since there
        have been so many abhorrents so far). Entrance is on the W side.</small></p>
        <p><small>House C is generally called the Chamber or
        the Cleric House. This is the first goal to be cleared (to prevent wall
        aggros). The entry is noted on the map (right beside house A). guarding
        the entrance just inside are two clerics. In the northern hallway (from
        the entrance to the NE corner), there is a single roamer, but he can be
        anything on the spawn table. Usually, it is a spite, rev (male or
        female), lich, monk, or ire, but I have even seen a drake there. Just be
        careful and look before charging into the room. Mostly, though, it is a
        spite or rev. In the far SE corner of the house is a throne, and there
        is a cleric on either side of it. The central hall of house C (between
        houses B and V) has 2 spawns, and both are roamers. One spawns on the
        far west end of the hall and roams to the east end. The other spawns on
        the far east end of the central hall and will roam all the way to the
        far east wall of the house (close to house 2). These two can also be any
        mob on the spawn table, but I mostly see rev, spite, ire, or lich on the
        east one, and rev, lich, ire, spite, or drake on the west one. Be
        careful as the drakes have a huge aggro range. A drake pull here could
        aggro a drake upstairs, and that would be very bad. No real way to avoid
        it, but be careful. The west side of the central hall has 2 clerics
        guarding the passage (just inside the west side). There are also 2
        roamers in the west end of the house just below the stairs, and the roam
        from the stairs to the central hall and back. They can be anything on
        the table, but I mostly see lich, drake, or spite. Usually, if one
        roamer is in the corner near the stairs, you can safely pull the other
        (once the 2 clerics are gone, that is). In the far SW corner of the
        house, there is another roamer that stays in that corner. I usually see
        lich or rat there, but have seen others also. It is usually safe to pull
        from the west end and not get this guy, but he does need to be killed.
        There is also a back entrance to the Chamber, noted on the map on the W
        wall just above the SW corner. This is the door to pull through when you
        camp SW corner.</small></p>
        <p><small>House C upstairs has the same floor plan as
        downstairs. All spots upstairs can be anything on the table. There are
        two roamers at the top of the stairs (NW corner), one in SW corner, two
        in the central hall, and four in the East hall. NW stays in NW corner,
        SW in SW, and the central hall stay there. The ones in the east end will
        roam from just above the entrance downstairs (near house A) all the way
        to the SE corner. NW is usually revs, SW a lich, central a monk or ire,
        and east is usually drake, spite, lich, and rat. But again, anything can
        be in any spot. It could be all drakes. Of course, that would be very
        unlucky for most, nice for any sks, but still. In most cases, the
        upstairs will not aggro from downstairs. However, if there is a drake
        upstairs and down, they could overlap ranges and cause a chain aggro.
        Usually, however, upstairs Chamber is left for later pulls.</small></p>
        <p><small>House D is the Chapel. There are also a lot
        of mobs in here, and almost all of them are roamers. Once the Chamber is
        clear, you should work on the Chapel so you can move camp. The SW corner
        of the Chapel is generally called the Throne, and it is the next camp
        site (after Maestro is killed). This is because it avoids most of the S
        patrol route, and there is a much much better pathing from the rev
        houses (NE corner) to the Chapel than to the zone-in room. That path
        does cross the N roamer route, but there are less roamers on the N route
        than S. Chapel entry is guarded by two clerics. there are also two
        clerics in the far SW corner beside the throne. The only other static
        spawns in the Chapel are Maestro and his guards.</small></p>
        <p><small>The Chapel roamers all have specific roam
        and pull paths. There is one in the SW (usually monk) corner that stays
        in that area, one in the corner on the S wall closest to the entry
        (usually rev), one in the NE corner (usually scorn), and one in the
        corner of the stairs (NE of the entry) (usually rev). There is another
        one just S of Maestro (just N of house P) that roams from that corner up
        to Maestro and back (usually abhorrent). Pull him when on the S end of
        his route. And in addition to these area roamers, there are about six or
        eight house roamers that will roam from near the throne area up to near
        Maestro over to near the stairs. All roamers can be monk, abhorrent,
        both revs, ire, lich, rat, scorn, or spite. There are specific paths for
        each, but that is too much to put in this already long tutorial.</small></p>
        <p><small>The Chapel also has an upstairs, like the
        Chamber, but it is not a full floor plan. There is a balcony overlooking
        the organ, so the 2nd floor is cut off from the top of the stairs angled
        a little S over to above the corner N of house P. At the top of the
        stairs, there is one roamer, usually a rev or scorn. In the SW corner is
        one, usually cleric or spite. There is also one in the SE corner,
        usually rev or lich. All three of these can be anything but drakes.</small></p>
        <p><small>Maestro floats just in front of his organ
        in the far NW corner of the house. He will have 4 personal guards, 2 on
        each side of him. In most cases, he will be facing NW, but will turn to
        face his guards when they buff him. It is safe to scout up behind him,
        but if facing you, he will aggro. His guards are always spites or
        clerics, and can be any mix from all of one, to a mix, or to all of the
        other. The entire Chapel, upstairs and down, plus some of the
        surrounding houses must be pulled before he is or he will aggro
        everything in his path. The best method for pulling him I've seen is for
        the scout to sit on the far east wall looking out between houses 5 and
        6. Make sure you are up the wall a little. The puller hits Maestro and
        runs to the area in front of that alley and fds. Do not go in the alley
        or Maestro will be too close to the scout and kill her. The assister
        would come out to the corner by the totem and wait. When the scouts sees
        only Maestro above the puller, she will give the word and the assister
        will shoot Maestro and pull him into the zone room. For this to work
        takes timing, and the roamers must be clear. The puller must stay down
        as the guards will probably still be aggroed on him, but they should be
        back home. If they make it home, and the scout will go there to make
        sure, then the puller can get up. If they do not come then, the puller
        is safe to join the fun pounding on Maestro and the scout can go poke
        some, too. There are a number of tactics to actually kill him once
        pulled. This is only info on how to pull him. After he is dead, you can
        safely pull his guards as will any pull to split.</small></p>
        <p><small>Once this is done, the raid usually moves
        camp to the Throne area of the Chapel as noted before. The scout will
        scout the path, and the puller or someone else will lead everyone there.
        If attacked along the way, do NOT stop and fight. Keep running and take
        the mob to the Throne. If you fight in the hall, more roamers could
        spawn on you or you could aggro something not yet pulled. Once camp is
        reset, the puller and scout can get back to work and pull everything
        else in the zone.</small></p>
        <p><small>House E has a male rev just inside the door
        and another all the way through near the bottom of the stairs. There is
        a female rev at the top of the stairs on the second floor. Entrance is
        on the N wall just above the E on the map.</small></p>
        <p><small>House F has a rev outside just to the east
        of the entry and 2 more inside at the bottom of the stairs. These are
        usually males, but could be either. Entrance is on the N wall.</small></p>
        <p><small>House G has three revs in the far S corner,
        and they are usually female. Entrance is on the far N wall.</small></p>
        <p><small>House H has one male rev downstairs.
        Entrance is on the SW corner facing west.</small></p>
        <p><small>House I has a box in the NE corner and a
        rev in the nw corner. There is also a rev upstairs. These can be either
        rev. Entrance is in the central N wall facing N (middle of the U).</small></p>
        <p><small>House J has one rev downstairs and two more
        upstairs, and they can be male or female. Entrance is on the W side.</small></p>
        <p><small>House K has one male rev in the SW corner
        downstairs and another upstairs. Entrance is on the NW corner facing
        west.</small></p>
        <p><small>House L has a female rev downstairs and two
        more upstairs. Entrance is on the NE corner facing east (looking into
        house K).</small></p>
        <p><small>House M has box in the far NW corner.
        Entrance is on SW corner facing west.</small></p>
        <p><small>House N has two revs in the back (far
        southern tip of the house). Entrance is on NW wall.</small></p>
        <p><small>House O has a scorn or monk. Entrance is on
        W wall.</small></p>
        <p><small>House P has a monk and scorn downstairs,
        and a scorn or monk with a box upstairs. This house is usually cleared
        before completing the Chapel. Entrance is on E wall.</small></p>
        <p><small>House Q has two monks or scorns downstairs
        and two upstairs. Entrance is on W wall.</small></p>
        <p><small>House R has a monk or scorn downstairs and
        another upstairs. Entrance is on far SE wall.</small></p>
        <p><small>House S has a box in the NW corner and a
        scorn or monk in NE corner. There is nothing upstairs. But there are the
        corner spawns outside (monk and 2 clerics in SW zone corner). Entrance
        is in the center of the U.</small></p>
        <p><small>House T has nothing that I have ever seen.</small></p>
        <p><small>House U has a monk or scorn. Entrance is on
        NE wall facing east.</small></p>
        <p><small>House V has a monk or scorn upstairs.
        Entrance is on NW wall facing west.</small></p>
        <p><small>For the revs, monks, and scorns, I have
        been as accurate as possible. So don't count the mobs here and then what
        you find and say I am wrong. It is nearly impossible for a rogue to get
        accurate scorn counts since they see us. And the revs are done so seldom
        that I forget on them. But I think this is almost perfect.</small></p>
        <p><small>Now, Up the ramp to Innoruuk... (House 9 on
        the map)</small></p>
        <p><small>At the top of the ramp, there are two
        drakes. They can be pulled without aggroing anything else. Once at the
        top of the ramp, there are only four doors you can go into. The one on
        the S side, closest to the ramp is a small house. There is a monk,
        scorn, abhorrent, or spite upstairs in there.</small></p>
        <p><small>There are two entries on the east side of
        the courtyard up there, the S one goes nowhere, the N one has a small
        house with 2 spawns, usually cleric, rev, monk, or scorn. Careful with
        this one as it could aggro Innoruuk through the wall (wall is close to
        the west T at the end of his hall).</small></p>
        <p><small>The entrance to the N of the area at the
        top of the ramp is Innoruuk's Hall. The hall goes N, turns right and
        heads east, then turns south and goes to a T that turns east and west,
        both of which dead end. There are two static spawns guarding the door.
        They can be anything but drakes (though not seen a rat there either).
        Within the hall, everything else, including Innoruuk himself, will roam.
        Some will roam all the way to the entrance, but only as deep as about
        half of the east hall going S. Others, including Innoruuk, will roam
        only to the far NW corner of the Hall, but will go all the way back to
        the T, and roam between the two ends of the T. The roamers can be
        anything but drakes and rats. There are also 2 deep roamers back at the
        T, and they are always drakes.</small></p>
        <p><small>Be very careful pulling the Hall. Inny will
        see sneaking. I have never even been able to sneak behind him, though
        that is probably just my bad luck and he turns around. And he will Death
        Touch. Every mob in the Hall except the 2 drakes in the back can be
        pulled without aggroing Inny. You just have to watch for him and get out
        of his way.</small></p>
        <p><small>Normal Inny pulling takes four people, the
        puller, the assister, the scout, and the sacrifice. The scout will check
        on his location (best to pull him from the NW corner near entrance so as
        to avoid aggroing the drakes in the back), then get out of the way. The
        sacrifice will charge and take the DT. The puller will then pull Inny
        and run for the Throne. If lucky and properly buffed, he can make it
        back there. If not, the assister grabs Inny and pulls him the rest of
        the way. Then you fight him. The scout then goes safely into the hall
        and drags out the body of the sacrifice to be resed.</small></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Break-in...</strong></p>
        <p><small>Break-in can be one of 2 methods, and both
        work well, depending on the skills of the groups. It can be either a
        rogue in the first group to scout and tell when the zone-patrol has gone
        be so can get some safety on entry. For this method, everyone must be
        invisible. As soon as you get in, move the S wall of the room and camp
        (NOT /q, camp), then meet in a chat room. The scout will still be in and
        talking to the group. The last group up usually ports up about the same
        time that the scout has someone (usually someone with 2 systems so in
        chat and on another character in-game, or someone on a twink logs out to
        chat) tells the folks in chat to log in. Once everyone is in, the fights
        start.</small></p>
        <p><small>The other method is 2 good groups head up
        at once and start fighting. The next groups head up in pairs a few
        minutes apart (to keep from crashing the zone with too many folks zoning
        into the same area all at once). This is the much faster method, but is
        also more dangerous since the mobs in house 3 will aggro any roamers
        going by, who could aggro the mobs in house C, who could... In any
        event, either method works well as I have been in on both. I tend to
        prefer the fighting-break since less time spent, and the aggro mobs in
        house C are not that frequent.</small></p>
        <p><strong>Pulling...</strong></p>
        <p><small>Pull team consists of a scout (the rogue),
        puller (fder), assister (warrior), cleric, and 2 others. I prefer the 2
        others to be enchanter and another healer. I like an enchanter there so
        he/she knows what is coming in since he may want to mez the first and
        hold it to fight the second. I like a backup healer to help keep the
        assister and chanter alive, and to keep the fder and ME alive.</small></p>
        <p><small>The scout will do just that... scout. She
        will tell the fder what mobs are where so as to avoid a lot of fd if
        possible, especially since the fd change where higher mobs usually do
        not forget the fder. There are several key vantage points to watch from,
        but most important until house C is clear is to watch for aggro from
        there. When the puller pulls, tell him how many and what he has. If he
        has 4 mobs, that is usually okay, unless it is 4 spites. It is up to you
        as scout, the puller, and the chanter as to whether to bring in the pull
        or let some of it get away. Don't worry if you miss some, they will
        still be there.</small></p>
        <p><small>The puller pulls mobs. The usual fd spot is
        in the in corner of the L of house 3 just N of the entry to house 1. As
        long as the fights are inside house 1, mobs there will usually not
        aggro. Puller pulls to there and fds. Then the assister, when told to
        pull, hits one with bow to pull it into the room. If the way is clear
        behind the puller (what the scout watches for), then the puller gets up
        and pulls some more.</small></p>
        <p><small>If there is only 1 mob in the fight room,
        be it the zone-in room or the SW corner, then there are not enough mobs.
        A constant pull flow keeps everyone busy and happy. It also clears the
        path the absolute best spot to pull to in the zone... the Chapel (house
        D).</small></p>
        <p><small>Pull order on all of the houses is up to
        the pull team and leader of the raid. Please do NOT ask that some mob
        get pulled. If the pull team is a good one, they will try their best to
        keep a very balanced set of pulls in order to keep everyone happy. Revs
        are usually the last to be pulled, but if the pull team is good, they
        can get a few of the rev houses before clearing the Chapel. Houses U and
        V can also be pulled as soon as house C is clear, which would help keep
        the bards and warriors happy. Any other pull notes, I have made in the
        tutorial.</small></p>
        <p><small>Always use assist. If you start beating on
        a mezzed target, the enchanters will start yelling and may even cut off
        your clarity or swift supply. Don't make the dealers mad.</small></p>
        <p><small>Only the puller and scout have SoW and are
        in run mode. No one else needs speed. If you use wolf-form, then not
        much you can do to avoid it. The reason is that some mobs fear, and
        Maestro could Charm. Either of these things happen while you have SoW
        going, and you will end up a long way off. If you get feared, you could
        end up on the NE corner or the NW corner (depending where you are set
        up). If you get lost out there from fear, don't worry. The scout can
        find you and take you back. If you are killed, no matter where you are
        killed, the scout can find you and take you back for a res. If under
        Maestro or Inny, it might take a few minutes, but she will get you back
        for a res. Don't worry, no one gets left in Hate. Well, not usually.</small></p>
        <p><small>Either the main chanter or the scout will
        call camp. No one else. If they are both dead, it is usually not a good
        sign anyway. If camp is called, you MUST protect the clerics and help
        them get out first. If you are a tank and camp while a cleric is being
        beaten, you will probably be run out of the raid. Clerics can res anyone
        back up. If all the clerics are dead, it means porting new clerics up to
        res. Clerics and Enchanters are the two main classes to be protected.
        None of the mobs in Hate are very hard. In fact, most are rather easy.
        But only in small numbers or in controllable situations. A lot of mobs
        with no healing or crowd control, and everyone dies. It's not so much
        that the deaths hurt since everyone there should be getting a lvl 49 or
        higher res anyway, but it does break the rhythm of the hunt and add some
        serious downtime. With a good pull team, there will always be mobs to
        kill, and everything will be under control... usually. Even with the
        best team, accidents can happen. If they do, just try again. Don't get
        discouraged or blame the pull team.</small></p>
