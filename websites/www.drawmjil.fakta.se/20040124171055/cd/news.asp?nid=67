		<b><span class="header">[2003-11-10]&nbsp;Lazy Sunday ... not</span></b><br>
		<P>Just a quick update to get back into the swing of things. Was quite a busy Sunday for us, no day of rest for CD !</P>
<P>After some mammoth camp-a-thons in Hate and many, many dead vampires (just call him Buffy), Titha finally got Essence of Vampire to make his Staff of the Serpent.</P>
<P>A quick scan around the usual places turned up a mob to go keel. Two groups of CD scooted on over to UP and quickly killed Radiir Fireshower and Spirit of Radiir. Obviously I am still a bit rusty after my lay-off as I died on the pull but the team prevailed. Loots were Knotted Knuckles to me, Pebble Crusher to Quylsha (app) and Bracelet of Beauty to Swedeneo (he needs the help .. hehe).</P>
<P>Then on to the evening's planned event. The Hedge run in PoNb for flags. We took a novel approach to this one as we let the two clerics and the necro die on the 7 mob pop leaving us no way to rezz in the dead. Luckily enough we had plenty of healing for the Construct of Nightmares. Congratulations to all that got flags and apologies to those who missed out. Do not despair though as we will be back. Elbow Spiked Arm Plates went to Hanni and Vochek got Thelin's Dagger for poking Terris with.</P>
