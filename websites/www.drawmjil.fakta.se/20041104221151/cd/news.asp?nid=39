		<b><span class="header">[2003-01-13]&nbsp;Epic Rampage</span></b><br>
		<P>Well we gathered some peeps and decided to rage across Norrath.</P>
<P>First on the Menu was the Bear in Perma for BST epic - Grats Zypherr </P>
<P>Second up was the Plasmatic Priest in Sol Ro - he went down like the cheap slut he is - gratz Goffa</P>
<P>Third&nbsp;up was a wolf in LFay for BST epic - Grats Zypherr</P>
<P>Fourth up was Verina Tomb in Neriak - After a year Parcs finally makes another epic kill</P>
<P>Fifth up was a Spider in Feero .. he didnt last very long I am afraid - Grats Zypherr</P>
<P>We then adjourned for some sustenance and came back fortified for the night of own.</P>
<P>Someone mentioned the rumour of a big monkey roaming the Field of Bone and scaring n00bs. CD decided to do Norrath a public service and went and smacked him. Grats Parcs on another epic piece.</P>
<P>Then we got the taste for fish and so to Kedge Keep. Phinigel Autropos steaks all round. Gratz Skrotnisse on Wiz epic staff and moi on Fusible Coral Ore for Strength of Elements.</P>
<P>Then the rampage squad split into 2. Those who wanted more fish stayed in Kedge and whacked the Corrupted Seahorse - Grats Swedeneo. Some people who had enough fish went to Stonebrunt but the mob wasn't up.</P>
<P>We then rounded the night off with yet ANOTHER chanter kill in West Karana (remember to BIND ffs ) - grats Parcs and then made some toothpicks in West Commons from a skelly which gave Carcharadon the Divine Might spell.</P>
<P>A good time was had by all :)</P>
