        are a couple of answers to that. First of all, it's great fun to give
        new and exotic dishes to friends, and believe me, giving 'Gnome Kabobs'
        to a gnome can produce a GREAT reaction. Second, it's a rather cheap skill to
        become master in. Third, it is defiantly needed for a quest in Grobb.</b></font><p><b><font size="1" face="Verdana">Ogres
        really are the worst race (except for trolls -Chernabog's remark)</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">
          </font><font size="1" face="Verdana">when it comes down to trade skills, they lack
        very much in both INT and WIS, the first important for skill
        advancement, the second for skill success. So you should really not aim
        for a jeweler career or some other expensive trade skill.</font></b><p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><b>Drawmjil
        had his own VERY good reasons to start out his baking career, which you
        can read all about in his <a href="index.htm" target="_top">diary</a>
        (Dates October 17 - 19). I will try to describe here how Drawmjil got
        from skill 0 to skill 103 in a very short time, with a very limited
        budget and NO hunting for ingredients.</b></font><p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><b>First
        of all, get around 15 practicing points to spend on baking, you can
        spend less, but that will mean more time and more money. Collect around
        15-20 platinum pieces. Do NOT think that you will have the patience of
        fishing your way up to master chef, this is tedious enough for an Ogres
        just to mix everything about a 1000 times.</b></font><p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><b>Ok,
        what we are going to concentrate on here are TWO dishes. First one is
        fish fillet. You will be making these until you are at skill level 82.
        Drawmjil also got a friend to buy a spit (portable oven) in Freeport, which
        increases the speed, since you don't have to run all the way to an oven.
        Start by putting all practice points you have into baking (I recommend
        15, but it could be more or less depending on how much you are willing
        to spend).</b></font><p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><b>First go to
        Bup, he is located in The ferrot at loc 1171, 122. Buy as many Jug of
        Sauce as you can carry. Then go to Chef Dooga, she has an in in the same
        place as the warrior guild is located. There you can buy fresh fish. If
        you have a spit you can start making fish fillets right here, otherwise
        there is an oven next to Crunga &amp; Erung in an unmarked shop down the
        hall from armor merchants. To make a fish fillet you put one jug of
        sauce and one fish in spit/oven and press combine. Believe me, you WILL
        fail often, especially in the beginning. A tip, hold down LEFT-CTRL when
        picking up a stacked fish/sauce, that will make you pick up ONLY ONE, so
        you don't have to bother with the slider. Well, you just do that over
        and over until you reach skill 82, then fish fillets will become
        trivial. Sell the fillets to merchants, Dooga or Bup depending on where
        you are at the moment (you will run between them allot).</b></font><p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><b>Ok,
        you are now at skill 82, that might be enough for you, if not (Drawmjil
        wanted to be above 100 in skill), you should now move on to Fish rolls.
        Same procedure, but instead of sauce, you mix one fish and one batwing
        in spit/oven. You might think that this will take allot of bat bashing,
        but there is a person who sells unlimited batwings in Oggok (lucky us
        Ogres). His name is Hrak and he is in the second room in the mountain
        when going to the Shaman guild in Oggok. Just repeat the procedure above
        and produce fish rolls. Fish rolls are not as profitable as fish fillets,
        which is the reason for making fillets all the way up to 82. If you have
        allot of money you can do fish rolls all the way, since you wont have to
        zone as much buying ingredients. Fish rolls can take you as high as 132 which
        should be QUITE enough.&nbsp;</b></font><p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><b>Well,
        that's it. Hope you can enjoy baking as much as I do, it really is fun,
        and now for the good part. The trolls have a quest called skeletons in
        the closet, which is to my knowledge the only quest in the game which
        requires cooking. What they need to complete the quest is something
        called a butchers apron. You get it by giving chef Dooga 10 gold and 3
        pickled froglocks (1 froglock meat + 1 vinegar + 1 jug of sauce). The
        apron itself if a good newbie armor, and could be sold to troll shamans
        doing this quest.</b></font><p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><b>Happy
