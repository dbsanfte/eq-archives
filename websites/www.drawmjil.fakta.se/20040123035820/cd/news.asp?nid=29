		<b><span class="header">[2002-10-14]&nbsp;CD have no Fear</span></b><br>
		<P>The CD ubbah raiding party decided to take a stroll to that lovely holiday destination, the <STRONG>Plane of Fear. We had heard tales of this fabled place, where monsters have radar for eyes and see you before you see them. Where they decide not to just come along and investigate, but to go find 15 of their mates first.</STRONG></P>
<P>Not daunted by this in the slightest, CD gathered at the spooky fire portal in the ogre lands of the Feerrott. Assisted by the lovely Annanas from OC and her pets Catapult, Salamien, Ooops and&nbsp;Azzazz, CD went forth to conquer!</P>
<P>It didnt happen that way tho.... As if someone had let the PoF crowd know CD was&nbsp;having a party,&nbsp;some spiders, ghouls, fiends, boogeymen and friends decided to gatecrash. After discovering Arvid had drunk all the booze the PoF crowd kicked us out.</P>
<P>Take 2.</P>
<P>We call in a big drinker named Poul, he's phat and big. He showed us the correct way to introduce yourself to PoF, by breaking heads. After his introduction, PoF was easy :P</P>
<P>We even decided to come back home with some souveniers:</P>
<P>Grats to Rot on 3 Paladin legs, 3 rog piercers, necro robe and other assorted items.</P>
<P>We got some lovely ranger stuff tho', a wizzie hat, warrior shield and&nbsp;druid stuff..all in all a fun time.</P>
<P>Thanks to Benaveriel for pulling and saying hello to Fright, he seemed to like shouting your name, so I guess your good friends :)</P>
<P>/Struan.</P>
