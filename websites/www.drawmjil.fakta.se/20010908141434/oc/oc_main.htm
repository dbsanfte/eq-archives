              It is called <a href="oc_Campspot.htm">OC Campspots</a>. This will
              get updated about every 1-2 weeks. It contains suggested campspots
              for the guild, depending on your level. It will guid people to the
              SAME spot in the guild, wich will hopefully result in an easier

              post the best drawing I have ever seen on the last day before
              vacation. Drawmjil, Midgaard and Insekta had a little get together
              in the arena the other day. Midgaards RL alterego was obviously
              there and managed to make <a href="images/drawmidins1.jpg">this
              EXCELENT picture</a> of what really happened. ;-))) The picture is
              also linked from the screenshots section for archive. It is really
              to good to be lost.&nbsp;<br>
              Inspired by that picture I decided to make a <a href="oc_comics.htm">comicpage</a>,
              linked from the menu. I put up some unpublished work from Lunar as
              well (Drawmjils art-maker). Hopefully Midgaard will send some more
              pictures for publish there as well.</font><font size="2"><br>

              Second, the funniest thing that I have been apart of in a LONG
              time happened yesterday. THE OC / CD tournament!<br>
              Everyone gathered at the arena, and the first battle was 'last man
              standing'. People where divided into level groups.
              <ol>
              <li>- 29: After a long fight, the winner was QUIEG,
              the guildmaster of CD, big congrats from everyone.</li>
              <li>30 - 39: This fight was for some reason quicker,
              and I was to nervous to remember who won, since I was preparing
              for MY battle. I have now learned that the winner was a shaman,
                big congrats to SKIPPY.</li>
              <li>40 - 49: I have no clue if the fight was long or if
              it was good. Though, sorry, but I can even remember who won
                (except that it was not <a href="ocmembers/drawmjil.htm">Drawmjil</a>).
                Update, got the winner now: TSALARIAN, grats!</li>
              <li>50+: Winner was, outstandingly HUCER, who did a
              good job here.</li>
              </ol>
              <br>
              After that it was groupbattle. Very exciting, and although my team
              did manage to progress up towards the finals, the 'mage-team' won
              in the end, members of that team was:<br>
              <a href="ocmembers/annanas.htm">Annanas</a>, <a href="ocmembers/putmach.htm">Putmach</a>,
              Ebbe, Gemanlron, Zykon and Ytmirr. Congrats from the whole guild.<br>
              <br>
              After that fight, I had to camp due to RL work today, but I know
              there was a big all against all fight. WInner of that fight was <a href="ocmembers/images/trowser.gif">TROWSER</a>,

              the reson I put the effort into making the memberspages (they take
              a while to make) is that I first of all want the <b>RL</b> photos
              there. To push this futher, from now on, I wont make the pages if
              you dont send me a <b>RL</b> photo along. I dont say this to be
              mean or lazy, and I do understand if you people dont want to
              expose yourself on the internet. But the reason I decided to put
              the effort into the memberpages, was just this, to make the in
              game contacts a bit more personal. I hope you undertstand that.</font><font size="2"><br>
