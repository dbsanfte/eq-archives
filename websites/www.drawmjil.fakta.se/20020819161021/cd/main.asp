				<b><font size=2>1st Annual Baldrick award</font></b><p>
				<P>The Baldrick award is presented only to those special few who excel in the art of abject stupidity within the game.</P>
<P>The first ever 'Thingy shaped turnip' was presented to handaar at the UK meet this weekend. (picture shows Handaar (right) being presented his turnip by Daylight)</P>
<P>His own unique variation on the death loop priciple won him the award after binding at East Freeport then proceding to kill&nbsp;Sir lucan for his soulfire quest.</P>
<P>Since he forgot to rebind afterwards his next death resulted in many corpses, desparate tells and CR through tears of laughter as his fellow members tried to save his dwarf arse.</P>
<P>A well deserved award im sure you will agree. Our master of disaster then proceded to work on next years award by breaking his thingy shaped turnip 30 seconds after receiving it. </P>
<P>Is there anyone out there who can challenge our raining Baldrick..... Watch this space.</P>
