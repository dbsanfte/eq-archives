		<P>Valrik has become quite friendly with the Dorfs of Velious, so much so he wanted to help their general make an important agreement with the gnomes. The Giants were understandably put out by this and had hidden forces waiting to ambush the luckless general. Never fear, surely a general would have an army behind him? Right? No..</P>
<P>So CD stepped in as mercenaries and took out the Giants. The general was so pleased that Valrik was awarded the Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl, which is quite funky ) Grats!</P>
<P>After that, CD headed over to Kithicor where yours truly found he was leading another General raid (this time we kill him). After nearly 2hrs of Goffa and Carcharadon dying (wanderers bad) we finally got Kingmarph near enough to handin and pull the Big Yin. Needless to say, I died within 10seconds (along with the wizzies and rangers) but repop to see King got his Epic. Grats!</P>
