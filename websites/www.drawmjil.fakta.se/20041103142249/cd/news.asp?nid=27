		Well CD came, saw and kicked City of Mist butt.<BR>CD ran amock in CoM once more and thank you to all that came, but the greatest news of the night was Daylight finally got his Jade Reaver. <BR><BR>After 15 raids we are all thankful he finally got his paws on one.<BR>Thanks to to Ballain for showing us Reavers can be pulled by the Rangers of CD and hey you have certainly maxed your FD skill bud.<BR><BR>Also it just goes to show if you want a Jade Reaver dont take along Rocheforth :) As they never drop when he about. Qouth on the other hand has a 100% record every CoM he gone on a Jade Reaver has dropped.<BR>WTG once more Daylight an dall in CD for a job well done.
