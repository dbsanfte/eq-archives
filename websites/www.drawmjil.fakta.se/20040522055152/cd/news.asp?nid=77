		<P>And the CD machine keeps creaking on ...</P>
<P>Been a busy few weeks for us as we get back into the raid swing. As usual there has been tears, tantrums, wipes and comedy.</P>
<P>Raids&nbsp;wise we have killed Arch Lich Rhag Zhadune 3 times (much &lt;3 for that rampage) and generally seeing the better items from his loot table. King Tormax continues to be our loot pinata although the tight git STILL hasn't given up the monk bracer (grmbl). Some epic kills and some general tomfoolery (ie Ssra key farming). Oh and /rude the Harmonium wing of Yantis enterprises for continuing to kill 3 BoT towers at 4pm UK time every bloody day (you know who you are).</P>
<P>In the real world we had the six-monthly lets-get-drunk-at-Queig-and-Cyenie's affair, which was well attended and good fun for all. Although Daylight STILL didn't manage to keep his clothes on. The cries of 'Ranger down' have a new significance when they are related to a large pair of jockey shorts. Women everywhere are swooning I am sure :P</P>
