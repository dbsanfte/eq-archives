		<P>Well, been a while since we posted any updates here, so pull up a stool, grab a brew and listen to what has been going on in the crazy world of the Drift.</P>
<P>Raid wise we finished up our first round&nbsp; of Sleeper's Tomb keying, and once we can get a decent force on-line we will be trying to get to the bubble and take the obligatory 'I wuz ere' screenshot. Watch out for CD producting 'I went to Sleeper's Tomb and I all I got was this lousy T-Shirt' shirts soon. Next goal is Ssra and Seru, we have been making progress with this having killed Arch Lich a couple of times (damn, he rampages too much). Keying and bane weapon farming is next of course, but as usual the Drift will do this in its own sweet time. King Tormax has also been our bitch for the last few weeks (although Stormwind might beg to differ) and we even have one cleric with enough Yelinak faction to complete the boots quest (go, go Goffabot) although the tight git is not putting out the love with the monk bracer (/rude).</P>
<P>Had a few runs through the sewer trials in Ikkinz and man those are hard. XP and loot is VERY nice but dont expect to waltz through one first try. Think Hard LDoN on steriods, with attitude and then some. This will require more tuning before we succeed.</P>
<P>The fourth annual nome run from&nbsp;Ak' Anon to Halas (level 1 PK nomes only, no port, no SoW)&nbsp;was this weekend. This years was the usual round of death, death and ermmm .. death. The winning nome was Dogan the Papabear from OC but as he is the founder of the event then it is to be expected.</P>
<P>Next weekend sees another infamous CD RL pissup. Basildon will never be the same.</P>
<P>Ok, back to the game now ...</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
