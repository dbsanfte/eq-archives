		<P>Bzzzt</P>
<P>After spending over two weeks camped up in the Plane of Air, Nilano finally managed to get to Isle 7. Last night, the CD exterminator crew led an assault on the Bzzt Island on the PoA, this was hard.</P>
<P>The first attempt saw us split the right Bzzt first (doh! Silly Struan) and wiped after killing around 4 of the Bees. Luckily we had a cleric camped there, so Roche came up and duly ressed everyone up again.</P>
<P>Second attempt, we charged the Bzzts and managed to kill another one before the other 5 angry ones wiped us. Roche to the rescue again, click click click.</P>
<P>Third attempt, we were left with the middle Bzzt, this time we managed to kill all the Bzzts down to the Bazzt Zzzt before he started to Ping Pong around, wipe. Ah well back in with Roche, click click click.</P>
<P>Fourth attempt, people were leaving, lost a few to skydivers so we decided to just nuke and beat his sorry bixie striped ass to oblivion, and that is what we did.</P>
<P>Grats CD for patience and good humour (FFS!) and lets all get to the 7th Isle and get Nilano his crown )</P>
<P>PS Bzzzt Island is hard )</P>
