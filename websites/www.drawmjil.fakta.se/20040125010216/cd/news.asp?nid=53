		<P>Short news this one folks.</P>
<P>Titha got Lusi to round up the CDers online and we went to Kunark to beat up on the ol' Tangrin. 20mins spend buffing etc led to a 3min kill ) I spent the entire fight stunned (guess who forgot to get GRM =) but the rest of CD took him down with ease.</P>
<P>After that we wandered around Cabilis, took down the Iksar mob for Titha in there, managed to lose a Pally (I tried drowning him, but he wouldnt have any of it) but everyone got out ok.</P>
<P>Also for the special bulletin:</P>
<P>Continental Drift has its first level 65, Grats go to Blackadder for being the first to reach this lofty goal and also forever more to be known as Pa'. ) Well done m8.</P>
