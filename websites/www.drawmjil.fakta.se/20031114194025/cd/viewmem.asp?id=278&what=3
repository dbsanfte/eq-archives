Was about a year and a half ago, baby.<br><br><span class="header">Why is the class you've choosen the right one for you?</span><br>When I find the right class for me, I'll let ya know.  ;P  My rogue is fun, 'cuz she has a really COOL-looking dagger!  Even ask Zakkari!<br><br><span class="header">If you had to play a different class as main, what class would it be?</span><br>I would have a level 60 enchanter, so I could C3 all my alts.  But I'd only wanna be a 'chanter if I was 60, of course...!<br><br><span class="header">How many hours per week do you spend online?</span><br>Um.  More hours than I spend sleeping!<br><br><span class="header">Whats the first thing you do when you log onto Everquest?</span><br>I send tells to people asking for cyber.<br><br><span class="header">What are you favourite movie(s)?</span><br>Can't remember!  I tend to like comedies, though.<br><br><span class="header">What is your favourite music?</span><br>...Erm.  To be completely honest, I mostly listen to video game soundtracks.  Isn't that horrible?<br><br><span class="header">According to you, is the glass half full or is it half empty?</span><br>If I stepped on it, it'd be broken.<br><br><span class="header">Whats your best memory of Everquest?</span><br>Hmm... that's tough.  Ask me some other time!<br><br><span class="header">Whats your worst memory of Everquest?</span><br>Meeting Valrik.  It all went downhill from there...  =P<br><br><span class="header">Besides playing Everquest, do you have any other hobbies?</span><br>What IS there besides EverQuest?  I tend to play good ol' console games if EQ gets to be too frustrating.<br><br><span class="header">What is your motto in life?</span><br>It's not a papaya; it's a mango.<br><br><span class="header">How does the area around your computer look?</span><br>Like it was the site of a natural disaster.  It's a complete mess!<br><br><span class="header">Have you ever shouted at your computer when dying in EQ? :)</span><br>F*CK!  F*CK!  OH F*CKING SH*T!  ...Yes.<br><br><span class="header">Whats your first thought when you wake up in the morning?</span><br>I'm not capable of forming coherent thoughts when I wake up in the morning.<br><br><span class="header">Chocolate or vanilla flavoured icecream?</span><br>Gimme both!<br><br><span class="header">Do you own a pet (in RL)?</span><br>A Boxer (he's a big, slobbery puppy-type thing, oh yes he is!), and two cats.<br><br><span class="header">If you could chang anything in Everquest, what would it be?</span><br>EQ would have an intelligence requirement!  Idiots wouldn't be allowed to play.<br><br><span class="header">How much wood would a woodchuck really chuck?</span><br>I dunno, but I bet I could chuck more.<br><br>
