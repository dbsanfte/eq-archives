		<br /><h2>Halfling Hodgepodge RiffRaff &#150; December
   21, 2006</h2><br /><br> Real life first name: Michael<br> Main Character name: Golvan Ar`Vold<br> Server: The Tribunal (formerly Ayonae Ro)<br> Guild: Officer of In Motion<br> <br> Where in the real life world do you live? Currently living in Vermillion, South Dakota for school. (Originally from the UK)<br> <br> How long have you played EQ? I have played EQ since its release. This character has been around for about two years.<br> <br> What other MMOs have you played? I haven't played any others. EQ all the way!!<br> <br> What type of work do you do? I am currently a student at University of South Dakota.<br> <br> How long is your typical gaming session when playing EQ? A typical gaming session lasts between 4-6 hours a day. A lot more on the weekends.<br> <br> What does a typical EQ day consist of for you? A typical EQ day for me tends to be mostly raiding. In Motion does a lot of raiding (4 days a week, at least). After the raids are finished for the evening, I will group with some guildmates and take care of some named groupable mobs. Either that or finish off signets for CoA access. After that is done, I will take the last twenty minutes or so and tradeskill up.<br> <br> What was the race and class of your very first character? Oh my. Been a long, long time ago. I believe it was a Dark Elf necromancer.<br> <br> What got you into gaming and what sort of games do you like the most? I have always been a gamer. My best mate got me into EQ when it was first introduced. We also used to play Dungeons and Dragons on paper. Jolly good times. I really do enjoy role-playing games. That is about all I play. Sometimes I will play Real Time Strategy games as well.<br> <br> What other hobbies or activities do you take part in, other then playing EverQuest?  Aside from EverQuest, bloody homework takes up most of my time. Being a Computer Science major tends to draw most of my resources.<br> <br> What is your highest level in EQ? I was on a two month hiatus from EverQuest to take care of homework and school. So as it stands, I am only level 71.<br> <br> What race and class is your main character? My main is a Dark Elf Necromancer.<br> <br> What do you like the most about the class you have chosen for your main character? I love the fact that my class can solo their way as far as humanly possible. I do not HAVE to worry about groups if I am going for pure experience.<br> <br> Does your main character worship a deity? Of course! He worships the Dark Lord Innoruuk.<br> <br> How did you choose your main character's name? Golvan was the very first necromancer I had created in Dungeons and Dragons.<br> <br> Which classes in EQ have you NOT played? There are quite a few. I generally play only pure casters and rangers. I have not played a bard, beastlord, berserker, shaman, warrior, shadowknight, druid, and a rogue<br> <br> What is your favorite expansion? My favourite expansion would have to be Omens of War.<br> <br> What is your favorite zone? My favourite zone is a toss up between Muramite Proving Grounds, Riftseeker's Sanctum and Icefall Glacier from The Serpent Spine.<br> <br> What is your favorite npc? I really do not have a favourite NPC. If I had to choose one, it would probably have to be any Magus, because I do like to travel around really fast via their teleportation.<br> <br> Which expansion do you like the least? The expansion I did not care much for was Prophecy of Ro.<br> <br> Which zone do you like the least? My least favourite zone is Arcstone.<br> <br> Which npc do you like the least? My least favourite NPC was Kazen Fecae (I hope I spelled it right) because he would run me all over bloody Norrath for my epic 1.0<br> <br> What is the most platinum you have ever spent on purchasing a single item for one of your characters? I spent almost 60k for the Slime Blood of Cazic Thule. I thought it was worth it at the time.<br> <br> Do you have an item you no longer use but keep around for nostalgic reasons? If so what is it and why do you keep it? I keep my Scythe of Shadowed Souls (the duck stick) because it was one of my crowing achievements. That thing took a long bloody time for me to get.<br> <br> What do you like best about EverQuest? I love the people that are in my guild and just in general. They are so kind (for the most part).<br> <br> What do you get out of playing EverQuest? I love having the sense of camaraderie between guildmates and myself. I have gotten know quite a few of them very well. I will call guildmates if I am having some sort of crises in real life. They are always there for me (Thanks to Portrich and Rejina)<br> <br> Describe your best experience from playing EverQuest? My best experience was when our guild took down Lord Mithaniel Marr with only something like 32 people (perhaps less). I was the only necromancer on the raid and I managed to keep our cleric at more-or-less full mana on my own. It was fantastic!!<br> <br> Do you run or work for an EverQuest Fan Site? No, but I would love to work for a fan site. Please let me know in-game if I can help out!<br>

		<br /><h2>Halfling
  Hodgepodge Society &#150; December 19, 2006</h2><br /><br> Guild Name: Immortalis Kruoris<br> Server: The Nameless<br> Guild Leader's Name: Sabor Toothe<br> <br> How did your guild name get chosen? The founding officers and I wanted a name that would reflect our strength as a team with the members. The guild we were previously leading had a similar name, so the second part of the name (Killers) is for the history we brought with us to the creation of the new guild. The first part (Immortal) is symbolic of our determination to succeed together.<br> <br> Are you the original leader of the guild? Yes.<br> <br> When did your guild come into existence? November 5th, 2004<br> <br> Do you have a website dedicated for your guild? www.ImmortalisKruoris.net though since Magelo stopped working with EQRankings, our public-side roster isn't in tip-top shape hehe.<br> <br> How many members do you have in your guild? We have just over 40 active mains, but out our raids tend to be closer to the mid 20's.<br> <br> What kind of ranking system do you have? Is there much opportunity for advancement within the guild? We have 4 ranks within the guild: Probationary Member, Member (both probationary members and regular members are really on the same level with the exception that probationary members are under a 30 day review period), Officer, Guild Leader.<br> <br> I wouldn't say there is much room for advancement per se, but the officers and I try to involve the members in as much of the decision making process as we can. Every member gets to vote on things like applicants, guild direction and new rules depending on the impact of the rule.<br> <br> What are your current recruiting goals? We are always open to recruiting all classes. We are more interested in the person behind the toon, but still expect the toon to be played with a certain level of competency.<br> <br> Does your guild have a 'charter' and other rules that you abide by to help hold the team together? Absolutely. We take pride in the clean reputation we have built, and any actions that tarnish it are grounds for removal.<br> <br> What are some benefits that your guild offers that other guilds don't? Probably the biggest thing would be the true sense of family we have been able to develop. There isn't a person in the guild who wouldn't go out of their way to help a fellow guildmate. I think sometimes it's too easy to get caught up in looking at what a guild can get for you with no regard to the people you are playing with to achieve that. The members of IK enjoy the game not just because of what they get to do, but also because of who they get to do it with. Everybody likes a game more when you get to play it with people you enjoy being around.<br> <br> Does your guild exist in other games? No.<br> <br> What type of guild do you have, ie: family, casual raiders, hardcore raider,etc.? Well, we're sort of a combination. We are a family guild in that we don't have a minimum required raid attendance. We encourage that people put RL before EQ. But we also have 3 set days that we raid each week, and if our members are online they are required to attend. We love to joke around and have a good time, but during raids we expect 110% from each member for the duration of the raid.<br> <br> What content are you currently working on in the game? Our active raiders recently finished keying for Theater of Blood, so that has been our farm spot lately. We are also working on DoN progression along with Epic 1.5's and various other targets of opportunity.<br> <br> Is role playing an important aspect for your guild? Some of us will have some fun with a little RP'ing, but mostly no, it's not an important aspect for the guild.<br> <br> Can you go through some of your great battles and quests you've conquered as a guild? Most recently would definitely be flagging for ToB. Our members came together in a HUGE way to help their fellow guildmates finish whatever missions were needed.<br> <br> For greatest battles, doing Velitorkin with just over 20 people shortly after OoW came out when other guilds better geared than us were using 45+ to drop him or doing Rikkukin with just 23 people. There are a lot of examples similar to that, we like trying to take on mobs that people in bigger guilds think are out of our league.<br> <br> How often does your guild participate in these events on a weekly basis? We raid 3x each week and strongly encourage guild groups whenever possible on non-raid days.<br> <br> Who would you say is the toughest battle you have encountered? So far it's Rikkukin. We just beat him after a bit of experimnting and are ready to add him to our farm status. Testing different strategies and finding one that worked for us was a lot of fun.<br> <br> what is the most exciting event you can recall with your guild. Something that makes you think back and say to yourself, "This is why I play this game..." I love seeing my members happy and enjoying EQ. The reason each person plays is different, but when I see one of my members happy because they were able to achieve a personal goal they had, that's what I enjoy most.<br> <br> what has been the best expansion for the guild? I would say it's probably a toss up between DoN and PoR. PoR has given us ToB which we are taking advantage of to gear our members up. DoN is great because if we are going to do an instance of something, there are no flag requirements or 85/15 rules to worry about. An applicant or a member coming back from an extended EQ break can both come along despite whatever DoN progress they themselves may have.<br> <br> What advice might you give to people just starting out with a new guild or planning to start one? Be patient, expect for a lot of your time to be taken up doing things that some may take for granted and be ready for the ebb and flow of members as holidays and the summer comes and goes. But if you're starting the guild for the right reasons, it's all very worth it.<br> <br> What makes your guild unique? At the risk of sounding cliché, it's the members. I know that's probably what every Guild Leader would say but when you have a group of people willing to go to extremes to help each other out for the betterment of the guild, willing to really take the time to get to know each applicant on a deep level prior to casting a vote, it really is the members that make IK what we are.<br>

		<br /><h2>Producer&#146;s
  Letter - Announcing a change in the
  guard&#133;</h2><br /><br> <p>Farewell... I am here to bid a fond adieu. It has been an incredible honor to work on the EverQuest team these past years but it is time for me to move on. I never would have dreamed of this when my Druid was baking Batwing Crunchies back in '99. Yeah, I know they were useless but I liked to bake! </p> <p>For me EverQuest has earned a place in video game history and I feel lucky to be one of the many people that have gotten in the saddle for a while. Not only that but to have the timing to have been at the right place and the right time to accept the star on the Walk of Game on behalf of the game was fantastic. To represent EverQuest shoulder to shoulder with the greats such as Final Fantasy, Starcraft, Sid Meier and John Carmack was a great experience.</p> <p>We all know that EverQuest is more than a game to most of us. I have met a number of you at Fan Faires and various functions and I have always been impressed with the maturity and passion that I have seen. There are a number of you that I now count as friends. I guess what I am saying is that this has been more than just a fun job but also a personally rewarding experience. Thanks to all of you – even the cranky ones!</p> <p>Happy trails and good hunting.</p> <p>Chris "Raghnell" Lena</p> <br> ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br> <br> <p>Hello EverQuest players! My name is Clint Worley and I would like to say that I am very excited about becoming part of the EverQuest community.</p> <p>I started at Sony when it was Sony Interactive back in 1995, then we made the transition to 989 Studios, Verant followed and now Sony Online Entertainment. I have seen EverQuest grow from the initial launch to what it is today and I have to say that I am impressed! The player's feedback and SOE's internal dedication have continued to fuel the creative work that expands the EverQuest world to this day. </p> <p>I am looking forward to talking with many of you and helping the future of EverQuest continue to grow. We are very busy right now on our next expansion and I can assure you that you will all be saying "Aarrr!" once it is done!</p> <p>Clint "Jourdian" Worley<br> EverQuest Producer<br> Sony Online Entertainment</p>
