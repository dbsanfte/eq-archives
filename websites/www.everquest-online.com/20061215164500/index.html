<h2>Producer&#146;s
  Letter - Announcing a change in the
  guard&#133;</h2><br /><br> <p>Farewell... I am here to bid a fond adieu. It has been an incredible honor to work on the EverQuest team these past years but it is time for me to move on. I never would have dreamed of this when my Druid was baking Batwing Crunchies back in '99. Yeah, I know they were useless but I liked to bake! </p> <p>For me EverQuest has earned a place in video game history and I feel lucky to be one of the many people that have gotten in the saddle for a while. Not only that but to have the timing to have been at the right place and the right time to accept the star on the Walk of Game on behalf of the game was fantastic. To represent EverQuest shoulder to shoulder with the greats such as Final Fantasy, Starcraft, Sid Meier and John Carmack was a great experience.</p> <p>We all know that EverQuest is more than a game to most of us. I have met a number of you at Fan Faires and various functions and I have always been impressed with the maturity and passion that I have seen. There are a number of you that I now count as friends. I guess what I am saying is that this has been more than just a fun job but also a personally rewarding experience. Thanks to all of you – even the cranky ones!</p> <p>Happy trails and good hunting.</p> <p>Chris "Raghnell" Lena</p> <br> ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br> <br> <p>Hello EverQuest players! My name is Clint Worley and I would like to say that I am very excited about becoming part of the EverQuest community.</p> <p>I started at Sony when it was Sony Interactive back in 1995, then we made the transition to 989 Studios, Verant followed and now Sony Online Entertainment. I have seen EverQuest grow from the initial launch to what it is today and I have to say that I am impressed! The player's feedback and SOE's internal dedication have continued to fuel the creative work that expands the EverQuest world to this day. </p> <p>I am looking forward to talking with many of you and helping the future of EverQuest continue to grow. We are very busy right now on our next expansion and I can assure you that you will all be saying "Aarrr!" once it is done!</p> <p>Clint "Jourdian" Worley<br> EverQuest Producer<br> Sony Online Entertainment</p>

  Hodgepodge RiffRaff &#150; December 14,
   2006</h2><br /><br> Main Character name: Sokko Matic<br> Server: Firiona Vie<br> Guild: Stoic Tenacity<br> <br> Where in the real life world do you live? Annapolis, MD<br> <br> How long have you played EQ? Since the release of Ruins of Kunark<br> <br> What other MMOs have you played? None<br> <br> What type of work do you do? Design consultant for large scale audio systems<br> <br> How long is your typical gaming session when playing EQ? 4 hours<br> <br> What does a typical EQ day consist of for you? There are two typical EQ days for me, Raiding and trying to complete group task/missions. 8-12 hours a week is my typical playtime.<br> <br> What was the race and class of your very first character? Halfling Warrior<br> <br> What got you into gaming and what sort of games do you like the most? I have been gaming since Pong. Other than EQ, Civilization is my favorite game. I also like playing pinball, real pinball.<br> <br> What other hobbies or activities do you take part in, other then playing EverQuest? Music is at the top of the list, followed very closely by helping the enviroment.<br> <br> What is your highest level in EQ? 74... but give me another week or so and it will be 75.<br> <br> What race and class is your main character? Halfling Ranger.<br> <br> What do you like the most about the class you have chosen for your main character? The versatility. Rangers can (and do!!) fill so many roles in both Raid and group content. Despite all the Ranger jokes, most good players know that having a Ranger around can be the difference between wipe and win.<br> <br> Does your main character worship a deity? Karana.<br> <br> How did you choose your main character's name? Random Name Generator. I never intended for Sokko to become my main.<br> <br> Which classes in EQ have you NOT played? Sokko is the only character I've played past level 35. I have never played a Bard, Beastlord, Bezerker, Druid, Magician, Wizard, Rogue, Monk or Paladin.<br> <br> What is your favorite expansion? Omens of War. A great expansion with something for everyone.<br> <br> What is your favorite zone? Eastern Karana. I spent so much time there growing up that it still feels like home. Nobles Causeway was always fun. <br> <br> What is your favorite npc? Quarm. That bugger is HUGE. <br> <br> Which expansion do you like the least? On release? Luclin. Was far to laggy for me. Now, LDoN, although I loved it when it came out. I think it was much needed. It just got too dated, too fast. Its a shame too, because it was a fun expansion. It just has very low re-playablility.<br> <br> Which zone do you like the least? Plane of Water. I HATE fighting under water.<br> <br> Which npc do you like the least? Terris Thule. Its a personal thing between Sokko and Thule.<br> <br> What is the most platinum you have ever spent on purchasing a single item for one of your characters? Around 200k.<br> <br> Do you have an item you no longer use but keep around for nostalgic reasons? If so what is it and why do you keep it? I pretty much have no qualms about giving away or selling anything I no longer use. I play on FV, so there is very little I cant pass on.<br> <br> What do you like best about EverQuest? The community. My friends, My guild, My server, My fellow Rangers at EQOutrider, all the folks who run and contribute to the fan sites, the Dev team... all of us. They all make Norrath a place that is still fun to visit.<br> <br> What do you get out of playing EverQuest? Escape.<br> <br> Describe your best experience from playing EverQuest? Anytime an encounter is finally won. Helping the guild and friends progress through Norrath.<br> <br> Do you run or work for an EverQuest Fan Site? I was a Mod and then Admin at EQRangers. Currently, I am a mod for EQOutriders, the best website for all things Rangerly: http://eqoutrider.net<br> <br> <p align="center"></p>

		<br /><h2>Halfling
  Hodgepodge Society &#150; December 12,
   2006</h2><br /><br> Guild Name: Cantus Fidelis<br> Server: Luclin<br> Guild Leader: Gaenaria<br> <br> How did your guild name get chosen? I wanted a name that would reflect the atmosphere I wanted to build in the guild. In Latin, Cantus Fidelis means steadfast/trustworthy song. <br> <br> Are you the original leader of the guild? Yes <br> <br> When did your guild come into existence? While the guild was created at the beginning of 2006, most if not all of our members are veteran players and have been friends in game for a long time; I myself am coming up on 8 years and was in the original beta of Everquest (Phase 4) <br> <br> Do you have a website dedicated for your guild? Yes, http://www.cantusguild.net <br> <br> How many members do you have in your guild? We have about 76 main characters in the guild. Our members come from all over the world and every walk of life. <br> <br> What kind of ranking system do you have? Is there much opportunity for advancement within the guild? Cantus has one guild leader and 7 officers. Every three months, two of the officer positions become available to anyone in the guild who wishes to apply. The applicants post their desire to be an officer and the reasons they want the position, along with any benefits they would bring to the guild as an officer. The guild leader and the permanent officers then choose who will become the next two general officers. <br> <br> The new general officers are then given all the same responsibilities as the rest of the leadership core; raid planning, guild direction planning, social management issues, general day-to-day guild management functions, message board moderating, and everything else that a guild needs to have happen in order to maintain its momentum. <br> <br> I feel that making officer positions available to the members has many benefits to the guild. It fosters a sense of "ownership" in the guild; allowing members to contribute in a way that they might not otherwise consider. It also introduces members of the guild to the huge amount of work that is involved in running a guild. I've had new officers say to me, "Wow... I didn't know you guys gave it this kind of planning!" It's that kind of insight gained by our members that really help them appreciate the guild and its members on a new level. <br> <br> What are your current recruiting goals?  We recruit the person, not the character. We won't turn away any one person just because we already have 10 of their class already, but we do certainly have our preferences! Clerics are always in demand and we have a minimum level requirement of 69. Of course, real life friends and family of our members are exempt from the level requirement. <br> <br> Does your guild have a 'charter' and other rules that you abide by to help hold the team together? Any gathering of people over a certain number that are striving towards a series of common goals needs rules and regulatory systems, and of course our guild does indeed have these. They are not overcomplicated nor are they designed to exclude people. Our rules and systems that regulate social issues, guild membership, loot distribution, guild advancement, and personal advancement are designed to be inclusive of even the most casual player without creating undue "drag" on the people for whom it is a little easier to dedicate more time and effort to the game of EQ.<br> <br> What are some benefits that your guild offers that other guilds don't? The easiest answer to this question is simple... We offer Pacific time zone raiding on a server that is dominated by East coast hardcore raiding guilds. <br> <br> The longer answer is this: Our guild offers, to the more casual player, the opportunity to advance their character and to experience facades of Everquest that they might not have had the chance to experience yet. The casual, yet dedicated nature of our guild means that a person doesn't have to join a hardcore raiding guild in order to experience many of the same things. For people who cannot or do not want to raid 5 days a week, yet are looking for a group of people who are goal oriented, who achieve those goals, and who have fun doing it.....our guild is for you! <br> <br> Does your guild exist in other games?  No way. EQ for life! <br> <br> What type of guild do you have, ie: family, casual raiders, hardcore raider,etc.? Wow, this is a tough one... we're a hardcore family casual raiding guild? ... or maybe we're a casually hardcore family raiding guild? <br> <br> Some of our members call us a "family raiding guild". The truth of the matter is that we can't be described using just some of the terms above. We're a family guild when something bad happens to a member, to their family, or when someone just wants to vent. We're a casual raiding guild when we're out for some fun to kill some farm target and get upgrades. We're a hardcore raiding guild when our backs are to a wall and it's time for us to pump out another victory.<br> <br> Honestly, we're simply Cantus; that's the type of guild we are; we define ourselves the way we want and at our pace. <br> <br> What content are you currently working on in the game? Uqua, DoN Tier 4 (Yar'Lir), MPG Raid Trials, Epic 1.5s, OoW/DoN/GoD farming targets (Battlemaster Rhorious, Zun Marum Volklana, Kessdona,Rikkukin, Yxtta Primals, Rampaging Monolith, Circle of Drakes) <br> <br> Our next milestone victory will be Uqua, after which we'll be heading into Inktu'ta. Our long term plans include defeating Vishimatar, Anguish flagging, and end game GoD zones.<br> <br> Is role playing an important aspect for your guild? No, although we do have some people that act like ogres and trolls sometimes! But I think that's a different story altogether... <br> <br> Can you go through some of your great battles and quests you've conquered as a guild? Every raid encounter we attempt, we do so for a reason. Our targets are picked, after much research, based upon what our guild can currently handle, where we need to be progression-wise, and what we need to learn to get there. Our raids are picked so that we are constantly learning new strategies and techniques, so that when we attempt the "next bad guy", we know what's coming and how to handle it.<br> <br> Furious Jailor for the "Investigating a Disappearance" quest was great for measuring what our tanks could stand up to and how our clerics would handle the healing. It's also a great task to farm for gear.<br> <br> Defeating Volkara with only 24 people was really great for our guild. It really cemented the knowledge that numbers isn't everything and that strategy and good execution are even more important.<br> <br> The first time we attempted Tirranun he was one of those encounters that I knew our guild could defeat. We knew what to do, our tanks could take the beatings, our healers could handle the damage no problem, and everyone else was executing the strategy perfectly. However, we would end up being overwhelmed by the adds before we could take down his Ancient form. So we just waited to upgrade our raid dps, and viola he's now on farm. Was great watching that big dragon fall down (and stay down!) and go boom the first time.<br> <br> Ikkiniz, Trial of Transcendence and Ikkinz, Chambers of Destruction were both encounters that stick out in our minds as "great battles". Ikkinz3 is important to me personally because it really highlights a time when everyone gave 110%; it was one of those encounters where if any one of our people hadn't been giving 110%, we would have failed. Our win against Ikkinz4 was a direct result of the efforts shown in Ikkinz3. Everyone was dedicated to the win and gave 110% when it was finally within our grasp.<br> <br> Epic 1.5 weapon quests are important to our guild. For a guild in our position they are fairly decent weapons and the clickies are of utmost importance. By the end of 2006 we will have obtained over 40 epic 1.5 weapons for our guildmates.<br> <br> How often does your guild participate in these events on a weekly basis? 2 to 3 times a week. We do gear farming and epic 1.5 raids on Mondays. We save our larger progression oriented raids for Fridays. During the week we will often have a pick-up raid on Primals or anything else that we have on "farm" status for which we have the people online. <br> <br> Who would you say is the toughest battle you have encountered? Uqua has been by far the toughest "battle" we've encountered. Our first attempt at Uqua came after the zonewide AoE was fixed and we got all the way to 6trap before it just got too late and we started loosing people. Having never been in the zone before, dealing with the aoe, pulling the traps, and getting the twins dead on our first attempt ever was awesome. We learned a lot from that first run and I'm sure we'll rocket through on our second attempt.<br> <br> What is the most exciting event you can recall with your guild. Something that makes you think back and say to yourself, "This is why I play this game... "  The first time we defeated Volkara was the pinnacle of that emotion for me. We had attempted her on 2 different ocassions before our victory on the 3rd attempt, and with only 24 people! Anyone in the guild at that time and who is still with us can tell you how big of an accomplishment that victory was for the guild and just how good it felt to win based upon strategy, execution, and skill; not just numbers and zerging. <br> <br> What has been the best expansion for the guild? As far as raid cohesion is concerned, DoN and GoD have been the best expansions for the guild; we have learned a lot about each other in those two expansions. As far as general upgrades across the board, TSS has been the best for that.<br> <br> What advice might you give to people just starting out with a new guild or planning to start one? To someone wanting to start a guild I would say, "Are you crazy?!" Ha, seriously though, the best advice I could give anyone who is planning on starting a guild would be, "most importantly be patient (Rome was not built in a day, and hey guess what... your guild is not going to be Anguish flagged in 4 months; no matter what your ooc in PoK says!), build a good reputation on your server, recruit good people (not toons), let your accomplishments do the recruiting for you, don't ooc recruit because it just looks trashy. <br> <br> What makes your guild unique? On a server dominated by east coast hardcore raiding guilds, there really was nowhere for a west coast person with a job, a family, and responsibilities to turn to if they wanted to play Everquest and actually accomplish something. There is now however. Cantus Fidelis is filled with mature people who have jobs, kids, and more responsibility that you can shake a stick at, and what's even better is that we're progressing through Everquest at our own pace!<br>

Equip toon with water and food, then continue with planned tasks, quests, skill-ups for alchemy during looking for group or going to raid with guild.<br> <br> What was the race and class of your very first character? Dwarf Paladin<br> <br> What got you into gaming and what sort of games do you like the most? A friend of mine got me into Everquest and I was hooked since then, although he left EQ long ago. I like most RPG's, CoSims and strategic games, further complex board games. <br> <br> What other hobbies or activities do you take part in, other then playing EverQuest? I read scifi and fantasy books, too. Sometimes I translate English rule descriptions into German.<br> <br> What is your highest level in EQ? 72<br> <br> What race and class is your main character?

Its versatile use; spells, abilities, a shaman can do a lot: fight, cast, infiltrate, alchemy, solo and in groups.<br> <br> Does your main character worship a deity? Yes, the Tribunal.<br> <br> How did you choose your main character's name? My choice was influenced by the scandinavian myths, Sigurd is a mythical hero there. Sigurdsdottir means "daughter of Sigurd" and Sigrit is a Scandinavian female first name. Originally her first name was Sigrid, but I had to change it as the German Server Kael Drakkal has been merged with Antonius Bayle.<br> <br> Which classes in EQ have you NOT played? Many.

If so what is it and why do you keep it? Eye of Cazic Thule – it reminds me to the time when my former guild "Der Stern Norraths" with its ally "Templer des Sturms" killed Cazic Thule at the Plane of Fear in first try, first kill.<br> <br> What do you like best about EverQuest? To have a good time with people who like similar things as I like.<br> <br> What do you get out of playing EverQuest? Manage to understand different wishes and intents of different individuals.<br> <br> Describe your best experience from playing EverQuest? Long ago on my first raid I lead to the Plane of Fear, the first two "elite" break-in groups went down shortly after entry, as foretold by far more experienced players. I sent in a hastily gathered group of "leftovers" with a druid as main healer and an alt warrior as main tank, which managed to save the day. At that same day I got my Child's Tear for the Shaman Epic 1.0.<br> <br> Do you run or work for an EverQuest Fan Site? no<br>

When I started talking about the formation of the guild and said that I wanted to keep a family atmosphere while doing hard core raiding, I was told many times that I was just being crazy and to pick one or the other. So Lunacy Unbound represents trying and succeeding to do what some say is insane to try.<br> <br> Are you the original leader of the guild? Yes<br> <br> When did your guild come into existence? November 4th, 2003<br> <br> Do you have a website dedicated for your guild?  http://www.lunacyunbound.org<br> <br> How many members do you have in your guild? 120 Active mains, with about 80 or so alts, so around 200 total.<br> <br> What kind of ranking system do you have? Is there much opportunity for advancement within the guild? Well there is me of course, as guild leader. Our officer crew is broken down into specific functionalities such as strats, tanks, recruiting, pulls, heals, and banking. We do have opportunity for advancement for those who setup and are proactive. For example we just started a small internal guild group entitled Special Forces who are relied on to handle intense directed raid tasks. The coordinator of that crew will most likely become an officer soon.<br> <br> What are your current recruiting goals? Recruitment is tight currently. Although we could use 1 or maybe 2 more in a couple of classes' recruitment is mostly closed.<br> <br> Does your guild have a 'charter' and other rules that you abide by to help hold the team together? The guild has a charter that establishes our loot system and our expectations of members. The officers of the guild step in when we feel it's needed but most members keep in line with an understanding of mutual respect and kinship. If someone is a constant problem they aren't here very long.<br> <br> What are some benefits that your guild offers that other guilds don't? One thing we do that a lot of other guilds don't is mentoring. If someone wants to join the guild in an open spot in the roster, if they aren't so hot with their levels and gear, but show good personality and aptitude we will give them a mentor and train them. <br> <br> As far as guild credit (the type you bid on loot with), although the majority of the points come from raiding we do offer additional ways to get bonuses by completing guild goals. Like recently with the expansion people were rewarded for leveling and just last week we initiated a point bonus for finishing Dreadspire keys and helping others do the same.<br> <br> What type of guild do you have, i.e.: family, casual raiders, hardcore raider, etc.? All raids in our guild are mandatory and we raid 5-6 nights a week, basically if you are online then you are compelled to come. We have a very high expectation when it comes to knowing how to play your class and perform on raids, so in one way I'm sure a lot of people would characterize us as a "hard core" raiding guild. The feel of the guild however is very family oriented and we try to keep the atmosphere light and pleasant. I think we are a true hybrid.<br> <br> What content are you currently working on in the game? Progression wise we are trying to finish up DoN and get our first Vish kill now. We farm Anguish and Tacvi regularly. We have made strong headway in DoDh and are focused on reaching the Demiplane of Blood in the very near future. Although we kill relic dragons for the upgrades they give we have just now started the planning stages for PoR progression.<br> <br> Is role playing an important aspect for your guild? We definitely are not a role play guild. Although we have a couple members who role play slightly, or maybe they just speak funny ;)<br> <br> Can you go through some of your great battles and quests you've conquered as a guild? We started content in 2003 at Vex Thal keying and farming and have been doing a true progression ever since. I try to treat every encounter as an epic challenge, even if we have done it 100 times or it is something brand new. As long as the team turns out ready and mentally prepared every battle is great!<br> <br> How often does your guild participate in these events on a weekly basis? We do full raids 5-6 days a week, giving off Saturday night and sometimes Friday so people have time to get out in the real world and blow off some steam, or do spouse faction.<br> <br> Who would you say is the toughest battle you have encountered? Right now I would say Vish because we haven't beaten him yet. It is a very challenging script with many strategic components to it. I am enjoying the challenge. Another encounter I thought was tough was the Inktua'ta instance, those stonemites were a killer, it felt great when we finally beat that one!<br> <br> What's the most exciting event you can recall with your guild? Something that makes you think back and say to yourself, "This is why I play this game..." Well to think back a long time killing Coirnav was great 15 heart pumping minutes that you know something could go horrible wrong at any given time and blow it for you for 3 days. It was a great fast adrenaline rush. A couple of months back I really enjoyed the Zun kill in Txevu that was a huge coordinated effort where not being limited by the typical 54 person raid cap, I got to enjoy having the bulk of the guild online at the same time all experiencing the same event together. The feeling of single purpose and solidarity was incredible. I wish more events weren't so limiting that I could have more of the guild able to participate. That's why I play this game.<br> <br> What has been the best expansion for the guild? Each expansion that we have encountered was very rewarding to the guild. If you were to ask what the best experience for the guild was, I think I would have to say Gates of Discord. That expansion was very challenging and rewarding but what I liked best about it was the sense of accomplishment since it was a true progression and you could check off objectives to advance.<br> <br> What advice might you give to people just starting out with a new guild or planning to start one? Guild leadership is one of the most rewarding experiences in the game. Although there will always be some stress and frustration the good definitely outweighs the bad. If I could offer advice it would defiantly be to get an officer team that you can trust and that thinks like minded as yourself and delegate. Never try to do it all yourself, it's just too much and you won't develop anything except dependency. Think ahead, plan, and set realistic timely goals. Never berate or belittle a member for making a mistake, if it's their first time teach them. If there is a second time, teach them better.<br> <br> What makes your guild unique? The people. I have never been around so many great personalities and skills. I look forward to logging in every day to see our people. I know every guild leader thinks they have the best, but each night they confirm it. Sure some days I want to reach through the screen and strangle them, but I'm always back the next day ready to face the challenges again. What a group!<br>
