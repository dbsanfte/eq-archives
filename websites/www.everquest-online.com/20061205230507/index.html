<h2>Halfling
  Hodgepodge Society &#150; December 5,
   2006</h2><br /><br> Guild Name: Lunacy Unbound<br> Server: The Seventh Hammer<br> Guild Leader's Name: Giddemore Fizzledigits<br> <br> How did your guild name get chosen? When I started talking about the formation of the guild and said that I wanted to keep a family atmosphere while doing hard core raiding, I was told many times that I was just being crazy and to pick one or the other. So Lunacy Unbound represents trying and succeeding to do what some say is insane to try.<br> <br> Are you the original leader of the guild? Yes<br> <br> When did your guild come into existence? November 4th, 2003<br> <br> Do you have a website dedicated for your guild?  http://www.lunacyunbound.org<br> <br> How many members do you have in your guild? 120 Active mains, with about 80 or so alts, so around 200 total.<br> <br> What kind of ranking system do you have? Is there much opportunity for advancement within the guild? Well there is me of course, as guild leader. Our officer crew is broken down into specific functionalities such as strats, tanks, recruiting, pulls, heals, and banking. We do have opportunity for advancement for those who setup and are proactive. For example we just started a small internal guild group entitled Special Forces who are relied on to handle intense directed raid tasks. The coordinator of that crew will most likely become an officer soon.<br> <br> What are your current recruiting goals? Recruitment is tight currently. Although we could use 1 or maybe 2 more in a couple of classes' recruitment is mostly closed.<br> <br> Does your guild have a 'charter' and other rules that you abide by to help hold the team together? The guild has a charter that establishes our loot system and our expectations of members. The officers of the guild step in when we feel it's needed but most members keep in line with an understanding of mutual respect and kinship. If someone is a constant problem they aren't here very long.<br> <br> What are some benefits that your guild offers that other guilds don't? One thing we do that a lot of other guilds don't is mentoring. If someone wants to join the guild in an open spot in the roster, if they aren't so hot with their levels and gear, but show good personality and aptitude we will give them a mentor and train them. <br> <br> As far as guild credit (the type you bid on loot with), although the majority of the points come from raiding we do offer additional ways to get bonuses by completing guild goals. Like recently with the expansion people were rewarded for leveling and just last week we initiated a point bonus for finishing Dreadspire keys and helping others do the same.<br> <br> What type of guild do you have, i.e.: family, casual raiders, hardcore raider, etc.? All raids in our guild are mandatory and we raid 5-6 nights a week, basically if you are online then you are compelled to come. We have a very high expectation when it comes to knowing how to play your class and perform on raids, so in one way I'm sure a lot of people would characterize us as a "hard core" raiding guild. The feel of the guild however is very family oriented and we try to keep the atmosphere light and pleasant. I think we are a true hybrid.<br> <br> What content are you currently working on in the game? Progression wise we are trying to finish up DoN and get our first Vish kill now. We farm Anguish and Tacvi regularly. We have made strong headway in DoDh and are focused on reaching the Demiplane of Blood in the very near future. Although we kill relic dragons for the upgrades they give we have just now started the planning stages for PoR progression.<br> <br> Is role playing an important aspect for your guild? We definitely are not a role play guild. Although we have a couple members who role play slightly, or maybe they just speak funny ;)<br> <br> Can you go through some of your great battles and quests you've conquered as a guild? We started content in 2003 at Vex Thal keying and farming and have been doing a true progression ever since. I try to treat every encounter as an epic challenge, even if we have done it 100 times or it is something brand new. As long as the team turns out ready and mentally prepared every battle is great!<br> <br> How often does your guild participate in these events on a weekly basis? We do full raids 5-6 days a week, giving off Saturday night and sometimes Friday so people have time to get out in the real world and blow off some steam, or do spouse faction.<br> <br> Who would you say is the toughest battle you have encountered? Right now I would say Vish because we haven't beaten him yet. It is a very challenging script with many strategic components to it. I am enjoying the challenge. Another encounter I thought was tough was the Inktua'ta instance, those stonemites were a killer, it felt great when we finally beat that one!<br> <br> What's the most exciting event you can recall with your guild? Something that makes you think back and say to yourself, "This is why I play this game..." Well to think back a long time killing Coirnav was great 15 heart pumping minutes that you know something could go horrible wrong at any given time and blow it for you for 3 days. It was a great fast adrenaline rush. A couple of months back I really enjoyed the Zun kill in Txevu that was a huge coordinated effort where not being limited by the typical 54 person raid cap, I got to enjoy having the bulk of the guild online at the same time all experiencing the same event together. The feeling of single purpose and solidarity was incredible. I wish more events weren't so limiting that I could have more of the guild able to participate. That's why I play this game.<br> <br> What has been the best expansion for the guild? Each expansion that we have encountered was very rewarding to the guild. If you were to ask what the best experience for the guild was, I think I would have to say Gates of Discord. That expansion was very challenging and rewarding but what I liked best about it was the sense of accomplishment since it was a true progression and you could check off objectives to advance.<br> <br> What advice might you give to people just starting out with a new guild or planning to start one? Guild leadership is one of the most rewarding experiences in the game. Although there will always be some stress and frustration the good definitely outweighs the bad. If I could offer advice it would defiantly be to get an officer team that you can trust and that thinks like minded as yourself and delegate. Never try to do it all yourself, it's just too much and you won't develop anything except dependency. Think ahead, plan, and set realistic timely goals. Never berate or belittle a member for making a mistake, if it's their first time teach them. If there is a second time, teach them better.<br> <br> What makes your guild unique? The people. I have never been around so many great personalities and skills. I look forward to logging in every day to see our people. I know every guild leader thinks they have the best, but each night they confirm it. Sure some days I want to reach through the screen and strangle them, but I'm always back the next day ready to face the challenges again. What a group!<br>
