/* This is the default style sheet used by the Gallery when
   it is running as a standalone product.  

   If you would like to customize the styles please create 
   copy of this file called 

     "standalone_style.css" (same name without ".default")

   If that file is found in this directory it will be 
   used instead of this one.

   Some of the styles below are overriden by specific 
   album properties. These are noted.

   NOTE:  When Gallery is running standalone it still loads
   embedded_style as a baseline, but you can override those
   settings here.
