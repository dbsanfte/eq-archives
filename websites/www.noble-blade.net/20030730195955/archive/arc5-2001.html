<center><br>Wasabi!  Sorry it's been a while since the last update, but we really haven't done anything that exciting.  We dubbed the past two weeks or so the "Get piddly shitz out of the way" weeks.  You wouldn't believe how much of the smaller epic stuff we got out of the way.  Let me put it this way, we have 83 epics in the guild now, and many more down to the last item.  To start off, we whacked this pitiful dragon again... Drops sucked except for the White Dragon Shield which went to Rogoo.<br><img src="images/23-06-01-gore.jpg"><br><br>Few Lodizals went down, as well as a bunch of Scout Cherissa's for Bracers and Idols of Benevolence.  I think we dropped Talendor once or twice.  Well, I know it had to be once because I still have a Tobrins Eyepatch on me.  Er nevermind, that's mine I traded for it, really!  Tons of epics were completed:  Gutar, Akasha, Yanilu, Kamasu, Thaurn, Rylnor, Jenora .. just to name a few (Really, I just don't remember) ..<br><br>Oh ya, and we did our first semi serious ToV run.  Got a bunch of killer drops.  Mainly a Unadorned Breastplate which went to Falconuts.  We are currently near the end of our "Piddly Shitz" rope, so for you websight fans out there (All two of ya!) I'm sure the updates will be getting more interesting in the next few weeks.<br><br>Anyway, Back to this boring camp on my other PC.  ciao<br></center><br>

<center><br>This update is image heavy so if you don't like it, go elsewhere!  Been a busy week... So busy I haven't been able to break free from my brewery (Yes, I am a Grandmasta Brewer now, first on the server to my knowledge, woot!) and constant raiding.  Anyhow, enough of that ... I bring you updates!<br><br>In the past week or so we have takin Gorenaire out three times.<br><img src="images/06-06-01-gore.jpg"><br><br>Talendor twice...<br><img src="images/06-06-01-tal.jpg"><br><br>Whacked Mr. Ragefire to complete Darins cleric stick.  Oh but wait, this has a story behind it.  We camped him for over three days straight and he popped an hour before servers were going down.  To let you know how easy this dragon is .. here is his corpse.  Notice the obvious...<br><img src="images/06-06-01-zord.jpg"><br><br>Theres more!<br>We also got Vindicator again...<br><img src="images/06-06-01-vind.jpg"><br><br>Also popped the spawned Trakanon to finish up Dejins epic...<br><img src="images/06-06-01-dejin.jpg"><br><br>Vincecross also finished up our first Duckstick...<br><img src="images/06-06-01-vince.jpg"><br><br>We also whacked Trakanon, Venril Sathir a few times, and ran a Nagafen raid, and completed a bunch more epics my guild didn't feel the need to tell me about.  I think we are sitting around 72 or 73 epics in the guild.  Well done!<br><br>And our last image .. Grats go out to the man Sariden.  Represent the Rathe well on test server bud!<br><img src="images/06-06-01-sariden.jpg"><br><br><b>Loot!</b><br>Boots of the Vindicator - Ayame<br>Head - Maeil<br>Jaundiced Bone BP - Gaglain<br>Jaundiced Bone Legs - Gaglain<br>Manarobe - Daio<br>Deepwater BP - Kardius<br>Donals Legs - Nilam<br>Donals Legs - Hadar<br>Elder Spiritist Legs - Razdell<br>Runed Bolster Belt - Morthik<br>Runed Bolster Belt - Grazskin<br>Runed Bolster Belt - Redox<br>Cloak of Flames - Fonceur<br>Cloak of Flames - Hebomo<br>White Dragon Scales - Gutar<br>White Dragon Scales - vault<br>Red Dragon Scales - vault<br>Red Dragon Scales - vault<br>Dragon Hero Bracer - ?<br>Dragon Hero Bracer - TBA<br>Bag - Xasraiki<br>Bag - Xasraiki<br>Bag - Ariman<br>Orb of Tishan - Reign<br>Orb of Tishan - Ariman<br>Orb of Tishan - vault<br>Blight - vault<br>Drums - Gutar<br>Drums - Solien<br>Horn of War - vault<br>Heiro Crook - vault<br>Burnt Book - Spiritblade<br><br>I think thats it.
