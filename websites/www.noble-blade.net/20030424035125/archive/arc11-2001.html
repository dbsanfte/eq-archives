We served up a full plate of baddies tonight. Eventually these patches have to stop so I can get a real nights sleep..<br><br>The gang started the day off at ToV killing the named.

Apparently Doze and the named are tired of seeing us, as they refuse to hand out the good stuff. Grats Uzumzen on poison tear, backpack_01 on 5-6 orbs and a tear.<br><br>Our good friend Lendaria the Keeper made the mistake of saying that Dorfs made good eats, so we gave her a schoolyard beating until she apologized. Unfortunately a few people didn't hear her in time and she died. /shrug. <br>Grats Tigert on Ring of Relkententinar, Tillamook on Maul of Superiority, and Geddre on a ST key!<br><br><img SRC="images/12-12-01-lend.JPG" ></center><br><br>With everyone high on our success, we flew off to Kael to go visit Mr. Tormax. Our elite green beret monks spent a while perfecting their pull strategy, and much muttering of "ok..lemee try that again, but from here this time", was heard. Their work paid off as they proceeded to pull each of his guards one at a time. GG monks! We decided to stop poor Tormax from feeling lonely and brought him out and flattened him<br>Grats Mada on Ring of Lightening, Kanem on Axe of the Kromzek Kings, Gaglain on Crown of the Kromzek Kings, and Vincecross on Tormax's head for White Dragonscale boots!<br><br><img SRC="images/12-12-01-tormax.JPG" ></center><br><br>The troops were still restless, I mean, there was still 2 hours till yet another patch, so the team headed off to go take out Zlandicar. Once dead his loots were distributed quickly, with but 20 minutes to spare till our friend "Mr. Patch" forced the gang to bed. First Brood Talisman to Berg, Zlandicar's Heart to Carden, sword to Matok, Fraka Dar talisman for Shroud of Dar Brood to Rheanna, and grats Raifin on ST key!!<br><br>and with that, NB called it a day..except Thaldin..who never sleeps it seems...<br>

Our Statue desecrated!</font></b><br><br>Kael Drakkal, Norrath (NP) -- Our great city was brought to a standstill tonight by hated enemies of giant-kind everywhere.<br>The dastardly Noble Blade's, friends of our hated enemies the "Dragons" were somehow able to get past our guards and somehow manage to kill our greatest Heroes. They somehow managed to sneak up to our great Arena. "The mighty Derakor fell without raising any alarms", Kallis Stormcaller was reported as saying. Our great Statue however, did hear the commotion and came out to investigate. He fought long and hard but somehow these creatures found a way to defeat our great idol leaving nothing but broken rock and metal in the arena.<br>With the discovery of our statues remains, our forces quickly headed to our Arena to destroy these vermin, but they had snuck out of sight. With great horror, we learned that they made haste to our King's castle, and *obviously* caught him unaware. He fought valiantly and his shouts were heard to shake the walls of the city, but with great sadness, he was felled by these "Noble Blade".<br><p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/12-09-01-tormax.jpg" width="591" height="517"></p><br>Citizens!

Cogen carried away Derakors breastplate, Our Statues chestplate was stolen by one 'Ayame', and Groggog and Maeil stole our Scrolls of War! Tormax's loot was carried away by the filthy rangers Opafaf (gloves) and Cyriakus(Crown), Lohki the Scourge(Boots), and Seji the man-thing(Bracer). As a trophy, our Kings head was carried away by a 'Daio'. Show no mercy! Get back what is rightfully ours!!<br><br>--------<br><br>Dozekar the Cursed and Lendiniara the Keeper downed Sunday! Gloves of Stability to Kyleus and Jemit. Grats Borick on ST key.<br><br>
