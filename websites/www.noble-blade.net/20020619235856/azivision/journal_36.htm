The infamous villan known as Sejimonus Fakedethicus is being chomped on by Servelious. It truly is amazing how often our monks are found in comprimizing positions. Makes you wonder doesn't it? Incidentaly this is my first Serv slaying. Notice the new last name on your favorite dorf. Yep it's true, this dorf is officialy off the market. So stop sending me those love letters Volga :)
