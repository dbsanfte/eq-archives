		After many players wanted to know more about what stats actually did in EQ, Brad finally reversed his longstanding stance on the secrecy of stats and released helpful info about them.<p>Three cheers for Brad!  You have finally given more power to players to choose the sort of character they want to create!  And you had the honor to admit that you were wrong, Thank you!<p><br><EM>In working with the people doing the strategy guide for Kunark we decided to provide them with general information as to what the stats do. <br>I'm going to post them here. <p>This is a change in the sense that we were not going to discuss them or release more info. We changed our minds. <p>That said, we're not posting any formulas, and it's absolutely true that some stats have considerably more direct impact on gameplay than others. <p>We're posting this for clarification, and because previous explanations have not been accurate (manual, etc). We will not, however, engage in debate and our stance on how much some stats affect game play is that it's by design to inhibit some aspects of twinking. Are there better attribute systems out there? Yeah, but we're not going to change something as fundamental as a stat system in EQ after the game's been out for more than a year. <p>Anyway, here you go: <p>DEX: how quickly you learn weapon skills; how often weapon will proc; how quickly you learn rogue skills; how hard you hit with bows <p>STR: determines how much you can carry; influences maximum and average damage; influences how quickly you learn many offensive skills <p>STA: affects how many hit points you have, how long you can hold your breath <p>INT: directly affects how quickly you can learn most skills; affects the amount of mana for bards and all mages, as well as shadow knights <p>WIS: affects the amount of mana the priest classes have, also rangers; also affects how quickly you can learn many skills if your wisdom is higher than INT. <p>CHA: affects amount you will be paid for goods by NPC merchants, and how much they will pay you; affects the saving throw on certain bard and enchanter spells (charms in particular) <p>AGI: affects how quickly you can learn some defensive skills, how difficult it is to hit you as well as how much damage you take when you are hit </EM><br>

		<EM>February 17th, 7:00am<br>---------------------<p>***Announcements***<p>The City of Paineel, home to the infamous Heretics of Erudin, is now available via the Optional Patch.  In addition, Erudites may now also be Shadowknights in addition to the other classes available to them.  All Erudite Necromancers, Shadowknights, and Clerics who worship the God of Fear, Cazic-Thule, now start in the City of Paineel.  As such, if you wish to create a character of this type from this point forward, you *must* download the Paineel zone-files via the Optional Patch.<p>Please note that if you downloaded the Paineel zone files recently, you must run the Optional Patch again to insure you have the correct version of the files.<p>In related news, all of the entrances to the Qeynos Catacombs have been fixed.<p>Enjoy!<p><br>***Patch Message***<p>The following changes have been implemented on the live servers:<p>*Spell Changes*<p>- The recast delay for many of the Shaman buff-spells have been reduced.<br>- "Reoccurring Amnesia" has had its casting time reduced.<br>- "Yaulp" and "Augmentation" should now stack.<br>- "Solidarity of Vision" has had its duration increased.<br>- The Druid spell, "Skin Like Nature", has been returned to its former status due to popular opinion. As such, the damage-shield component has been removed and the regeneration component has been re-applied.<br>- "Sense Magic" has been replaced in all cases by the "True North" spell.  If you have already inscribed the "Sense Magic" spell, the spell icon will now automatically reflect "True North".<br>- A bug that existed with several damage-shield spells, causing their damage to be subtracted rather than added when stacked, has been corrected.  The spells will now stack properly.<br>- The "Feign Death" spell, when cast by a Necromancer, will now have a fixed duration.  The Necromancer will receive several warnings prior to the spell wearing off. This change was necessary because some Necromancers found a way to gain experience through their pet while being AFK for an extended duration, such as being in bed for the night.  Note: This does not affect Shadowknights or Monks.<br>- New Necromancer spells are now in game.  Check your spell vendors.<br>- Alchemy has been revamped.  Check with your local Shaman.<br>- DOT (Damage Over Time) spells will no longer hinder camping.<p><br>*General Changes/Fixes*<p>- The dungeon of Paw has again received a minor update to slightly reduce the difficulty of the zone. <p>- All known issues with the SBLive soundcard have been corrected.<p>- From this point forward, deleting a character will cause all corpses belonging to that character to likewise be deleted.  This change was made primarily to stop a no-drop transfer bug.  It also has the added effect of cleaning up corpses for characters that people no longer intend to play.<p>- Crippling Blows will now display the correct damage in the "You have scored a Crippling Blow (###)" line.<p><br>*Corpse Looting Exploit*<p>Recently, an exploit was discovered that allowed certain unsavory individuals to loot the corpses of other players without their consent.  The precise symptom of this is that the owner would find their corpse stripped of everything except for no-drop items, and items in a bag with no-drop items.  This exploit was fixed in this patch.<p>If you were affected by this exploit recently, you are entitled to a reimbursement of your lost items assuming that we still have a record of what you had.  Please contact a GM in-game to arrange for an investigation.  <p>During the course of the investigation, people who have exploited this bug will be subject to disciplinary action by our GM staff up to and including item wipes, suspension, and/or banishment.   <p><br>*Rogue Enhancements*<p>Rogues received several enhancements as part of this patch:<p>- The chance to score a critical hit with a throwing weapon has been increased significantly.<p>- When throwing a weapon from behind the NPC in question, a rogue now has a chance to score a "Deadly Strike", for enhanced damage above and beyond that of a critical hit.<p>- A new rogue-specific ability has been added to the "Hide" skill.  It is called "Evade".  This skill has the effect of lowering the amount that the targeted NPC hates the rogue, and has the potential of making the engaged NPC switch to another target (preferably a tank) within the rogue's group.  It is essentially a "reverse taunt".  This ability helps mitigate the negative effects of the rogue's exceedingly high damage-output potential. It also will in-turn help the rogue do even more damage as the NPC is much more likely to expose its back.  It is engaged by targeting the NPC you wish to "Evade" and pressing the "Hide" button.  As a note, you must not be in combat mode in order to use this ability.<p><br>*Mistwalker*<p>The Mistwalker will once again cast its spell as often as it used to prior to the last patch.  However, the resulting pet will now automatically "dissipate" after one combat round.  The change that reduced the "proc" percentage on the weapon was made due to an unintended interaction between the pet and the target when several users of this weapon were attacking the same target.  Since the new pet now automatically dissipates after one round, the reduced "proc" percentage was no longer necessary.<p><br>*Class-Specific Armor Quests*<p>Class-Specific armor quests, especially those belonging to Clerics, Paladins, and Shadowknights, have been reduced in terms of how long it will take the average person to acquire the armor.  These classes, and others that found particular pieces of their armor exceedingly difficult to obtain should find it much easier now.<p>In addition, a bug that hindered completion of the Bracer of Ro quest for some races has been corrected.<p><br>*Tallon Zek*<p>Loot rules for PvP deaths on the PvP-Teams server, Tallon Zek, have been changed from "Coin + 1 item" to "Coin Only".  This change was made to study the impact of loot-rules upon server population in reference to the loot/efficiency disparity between caster and melee characters.  This change is a test, and may or may not be retained or rolled out across the other PvP servers, pending the results of the server population study over the next few weeks.  <p><br>*Plane Changes*<p>Several changes have been implemented in the Planes as part of this patch:<p>- Characters will now lose all enchantments upon entering the Plane of Sky<p>- Due to the fact that the levitate-series no longer works within the Plane of Sky, a teleporter has been placed to allow entrance into the quest room.<p>- A teleporter has been placed within the Plane of Hate in order to give non-casters a way out of the zone besides death, potion, or group teleport.<p><br>*Loot Messages*<p>Messages indicating what has been looted from a corpse will now be broadcast to everyone within the looters group.  This change was made due to public request and to encourage trust within the group.  We may, in the future, employ filters to allow people to choose whether or not they wish to receive loot messages.<p><br>*Fiery Avenger*<p>The greatly anticipated defining blade of the Paladin, the "Fiery Avenger", is again available within game via a quest.  The *first* devout Paladin to wield this blade and be validated by a GM in-game will be publicly congratulated within a patch message and on the Official EverQuest web-site at www.everquest.com.<br> <br>- The EverQuest Team</EM><p>

		[This is the pertinent part of a message from Gordon... This is the portion that pertains to Rogues and Shamans]<p><EM><br>Alchemy and Poison: <p>Alchemy and Poison are in the process of being revamped on the Test server. Changes are scheduled to go live on 2/16/00, but don’t quote me on that just yet :)<p>Rogue Enhancements: <p>Some interesting rogue enhancements are being developed on the Test server with plans of going live on 2/16/00. <p>The chance of scoring a critical hit with a throwing weapon is being increased dramatically. In addition, a thrown weapon that hits the target from behind will have a chance of scoring a “Deadly Strike”. Additional throwing weapons will be released at a later date to make throwing even more viable. <p>In addition to the throwing changes, a new ability (much more exciting than throwing) is being granted to the rogue class. The ability, called “Evade”, is tied to the “Hide” skill. It is used by targeting a creature and pressing the “Hide” button. If it is successful, it will dramatically reduce how much the targeted creature hates the rogue. The Rogue will be given a message indicating success or failure. <p>This new ability is, for all intents and purposes, a reverse taunt, and will help the grouped rogue shift the targeted creatures focus back to the tank after landing all of those hits. This is not like feign death, which makes the creature forget you entirely, but rather just makes it hate you less. In addition, it only works against the targeted creature. <p>The skill is partially implemented on the Test server. Currently, getting hit by a creature makes the rogue’s “Hide” button gray out. Once this is changed so that it doesn’t gray out upon getting hit, it will work as intended. <br></EM>
