his deep voice boomed. &quot;You can't rush this. If you do, you'll most assuredly cause trouble, is that understood?&quot; the instructor asked.<br>
<br>
Nodding to the instructer in unison, the class stared intently at him as he raised his arms slowly, his fingers moving through what appeared to be random patterns and gestures. But to the trained eye, the randomness was easily seen as a complex series of glyphs used to 'draw' in and harness the raw, powerful energies that surround our world. Some call it magic, but by whatever name you wish to name it, it is truely powerful.<br>
<br>
Drawing his arms out wide, he starts to speak, his voice very deep and resonating throughout the room, though his words were unintelligible. Eyes closed, his complete concentration on what he was doing, he then brought his arms up over his head, his hands now trailing blue sparkles of energy. The whole class gasped at this, for his hands were empty just a second ago. Bringing his hands together over his head, he brings the energy that was gathering around his hands together and forms it into a ball about the size of his own head. Straining, like he was trying to compress it, the energy shrinks down a bit and becomes a sold mass of glowing power. Pointing towards the practice dummy at the far end of the little alley in which he stood, he shouted out &quot;Nisfquirl!&quot; and threw the ball of energy with all his might. Streaking through the air, it hit the dummy with a 'splat!' and covered the dummy from head to toe in a greenish yellow goop.<br>
<br>
&quot;COOL!&quot; &quot;Can I try?&quot; &quot;Do it again!&quot; the cries poured out of the students watching. <br>
<br>
&quot;What was that? Acid? Some currosive liquid?&quot; asked a student in front.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, that's what we had for lunch the other week,&quot; the instructor replied. &quot;I've been saving it for this demonstration.&quot;<br>
<br>
Some of the students who had ventured too close quickly backed away, holding their collective noses and looking at the instructor in disgust. Smiling, the Instructor told the class that it was dismissed and to remember to bring with them the needed components to cast their own summons. Watching them file out of his class, he cast a quick cantrip on the mop and bucket of water by the dummy, making sure that it started to clean up the mess properly, and walked back to his desk. He was very pleased with this group of students, by far the best he's been able to teach in some years. Being an elf, he has seen many come and go, indeed, has kicked many out for not having what it takes to master the Art.<br>
<br>
Rifling through some papers, he didn't notice the shadow that had fallen over him til it was almost too late. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the broom arcing towards his head. Ducking backwards, over the back of his chair, he flipped over it and rolled to his feet to come face to face with..........the dummy? His eyes wide with amazement, he almost took the broom handle in the throat, but managed to duck that as well. Quickly sorting through his spell inventory that he kept memorized at all times, he began casting the one that he wanted. Motioning like he was pulling in a heavy load, he drew in the mana that permeates our world and brought it into himself, thus mentally forming it into a shield. Mumbling &quot;Arch Shielding&quot; to finish the spell, a glimmering globe of light settled onto his skin, encasing him completely. Turning back to where the dummy was, he caught the next swing on his arm, the impact dull but tolerable. Raising his left hand, his fingers fixed rigid, he then snapped out his middle and ring finger, shooting a bolt of pure energy forth to hit the broom square on. Shattering it into a million pieces, he failed to see the bucket come up behind him and position itself just behind his right leg. The broom, now with a life of it's own, began to walk towards the Instructor. Raising an eyebrow and feeling a bit concerned, he again gathered the mana to form his next spell. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> This one will take a bit longer to cast</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, he thought and started to take a step backwards, only to trip over the bucket, thus ruining his spell. The broom was on him in an instant. Only, instead of just beating him, the broom was covered in flames and was trying to catch him on fire! Screaming as the flames bite into his flesh, he flung the broom from him. His robes, however, were aflame ...<br>
____<br>
<br>
&quot;Instructor? are you alright?&quot; the student asked.<br>
<br>
Jarred awake from his dream, the instructor looked around. Seeing no broom, bucket or dummy, he assured the student he was fine and looked down at his desk. Sitting in front of him was an account of someone's adventures in a place called ...'Burning Woods'....chuckling to himself and closing the book, he got up and rang for a custodian. Upon arrival, the Instructor bid him to plz clean up the practice dummy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait&quot; the Instructor said. &quot;On second thought, just dispose of the whole thing.&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> No use taking chances</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he thought as he walked out of his class.... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/uordained.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ordained</A> at: 6/29/01 2:37:53 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/beverquestersofnorrath.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=galadriaculravenni>Galadria Culravenni</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 385<br> <font color=#8B4513>(6/29/01 4:17:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To conjure up some shtuff....</span><hr size=1> ROFL<br>

Oh, thank you my dear! I haven't laughed so hard in a while and it felt very good. Nice job!<br>
