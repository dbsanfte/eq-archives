<br>
The argument for multi-questing being required really is just in reaction to a problem with the quest itself. The newbie shackle should be given out to any monk who asks the right NPC. Problem solved. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> And there would undoubtedly be a few cases like this that would have to be fixed up. But they should be few enough and easily fixed. And, well, perhaps we should make this change anyway. I'll mention it to the team.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
I meet a new NPC! Never spoken to me, because I hadn't done an earlier part of the quest.. I hand him a rusty dagger... I'm sorry this is not what I asked for! I just discovered that this NPC is a Quest NPC <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Then the NPCs should only react that way to the specific items that they are looking for. If you hand them at least one of the items they seek, but not all of them, then they return them. They should still accept any other sort of gifts. <br>
<br>
Good point.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
I don't get it Absor, basically you guys want to get rid of multi-questing, but since that will seem to be a nerf your willing to throw the users this bone. Why don't you just say that you want to nerf multi-questing? Why can't you leave multi-questing and add this. Really, it's not that hard. If your programmers can't figure out how to do it, all they gotta do is ask someone. I could think of many ways to go about this, for example, A pop up box. &quot;You have turned in the wrong or incomplete items, would you like them back?.&quot; <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Right now we don't know if it is our intent to change multi-questing. That would be the whole point of this thread. <br>
<br>
Despite your misdirected anger, you might have a good idea. I'll mention it to the team.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
If noone in the group can use the item, and since multiquesting is out... They will shout to zone, and some newbie...*not a twinked secondary* just got half of what they need for an uber item... qll they need do now is weight around the other drops for the same and bingo they just skipped 30...50 levels worth of upgrading to the next best thing... <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> How is that different than it is now? Is it somehow less acceptable that some random person gets to be twinked than some high level person's twink? Is it less acceptable that the low level character get the item than the high level character that can't be bothered to show up and get the item himself? And the chances of someone getting a quest done in its entirety this way at a level way too low is extremely slim. And removing multi-questing will not have much of an effect on this anyway. Those high level people wouldn't be hunting that NPC unless one of them wants the item anyway.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
This is a multiplayer game that is supposed to encourage grouping and personal interraction. Multi-questing is a part of that. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Not really. It's not part of 'grouping' at all. If I'm grouped with you, I can loot the item in question and there is no multi-questing needed. Though I can see that it does promote interaction in some ways between people that might not have met otherwise. But those cases are rare. For the most part, muti-questing is done by people that know each other already.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Loss of items is regrettable, but I don't think they occur with all that much frequency that would warrant changing this aspect of the game. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> If it didn't happen with some frequency, we wouldn't be talking about it. It certainly happens enough to make it worth talking about.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
The real problem lies with higher level people camping hard to get items (i.e. The Ring of the Ancients) and then auctioning them in East Commons or GFay at the expense of other players working hard to get the items. That cheapens some quests. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Agreed. Obviously my personal opinion (again, personal, meaning just me) is that multi-questing is one of those things that, in general, cheapens the game. It allows people to basically split quests up so that the guy getting the reward isn't even doing most of the questing. But that's just my personal opinion.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
However, if two or more friends work together to complete a quest and turn in the items so one person gets the reward, then that is well within the spirit of player interraction. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Well, those friends are not working together if they are multi-questing. They are working separately. They are not interacting at all. If they were together doing each part of the quest, they wouldn't need to multi-quest. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Another example: Guildmember-01 is in a raid in the castle in Mistmoore, and they get the werewolf claws. Guildmember-02 is a warrior that needs crafted armor. Guildmember-02 buys the rubies, then Guildmember-01 turns in the werewolf claws and Guildmember-02 turns in the rubies and gets the crafted BP is a perfectly legitimate example of teamwork and the spirit of multi-player cooperation. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Yes, that is an example of teamwork. And I'm not saying that it's a bad thing. But it is basically circumventing the quest (again MY opinion, not that of the team). The concern that someone mentioned, the link-dead group member that just can't loot the item that he did work hard to achieve, that's a real concern for me. That person would not be able to get the item (or have someone get it for him), and would lose the chance. In this case, I'm in favor of multi-questing.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Why are you even bothering asking us when you have almost certainly already made up your mind? <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Then why bother replying if you are so convinced that we've already made up our minds? <br>
<br>
You'll note that we want to talk about this. When we are set to change something, we'll just do it. Some decisions can't be made by a committee of 300,000. We'll make those decisions and move on. But in cases where we want input, we ask for it. The fact that you assume we don't want to hear your opinion is both silly and false.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Third things third: eliminating multi-questing is wrong. There are at least 2 quests I'm aware of that virtually require it. The &quot;Orc Illegible Cantrip&quot; quest in West Freeport that requires 2 of a Lore Item to be handed in, and a necro quest which I believe runs from Paineel that requires good faction with Halas (don't know details, just that a friend has asked me to help him with this). <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I would argue that those quests are broken if they _require_ multi-questing to complete, and should be changed anyway, regardless of what happens here. By themselves, such quests are not really a good reason not to remove multi-questing. But, again, just my opinion (I'm gonna say that a lot, since I'm only representing myself, and no decision has been made by the team on this yet).</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
This will make at least one quest impossible to complete. The Necromancer &quot;Mantle of Souls&quot; quest from Paineel. It requires that you get a potion from a Barbarian in Halas. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Thanks. That's the information I needed. I'll make sure the team knows about this quest, perhaps it should be changed somehow. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I fail to understand why this is suddenly becoming a problem now since people know that broken quests never get addressed properly until someone has lost a lot time/effort in trying to complete one. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> This has nothing at all to do with broken quests. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Absor, how unfortunate for you that you've caught me in a adverserial mood. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Unfortunate for who? It harms only your argument. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Stop making fools of yourselves. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I don't have a problem with your lack of interest in the discussion. But please refrain from active attempts to disrupt it. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Removing multi-questing is guaranteed to break a number of quests, since a lot of quests were implemented with it in mind as a necessary feature. For just one example, it would break the Paladin Soulfire quest (which in turn would break the Paladin Epic Weapon Quest, since it relies on the Fiery Avenger quest which relies on Soulfire). Why? Because to do an early, necessary stage of the quest, you must give four LORE Drom's Champagnes to the drunk Tyklar Renlon in East Freeport. The only way to do this is to give him one, hit Give, then quickly buy another from the nearby bartender, hand that one over, repeat repeat. This only works because of the multi-questing feature. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Then that quest sounds broken to me. How silly is it to have it set up that way? This is another one that I'll pop over to the team, regardless of the outcome of our discussions on the subject.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
What I want to know is how anyone who cannot forage will be able to complete the Tunarean court quests if you implement this. (FYI: you have to forage several no-drop items for part of this quest) <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Noted. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Just like you said you wouldn't make unkillable mobs <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Certainly not something I ever said. Personally, I'm all in favor of unkillable NPCs. <br>
<br>
Thanks for the input everyone. <br>
