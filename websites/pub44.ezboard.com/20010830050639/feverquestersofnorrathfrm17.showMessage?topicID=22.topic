I speak of Tunare, the Mother of All. With her guilding hand I doth strive to do Her bidding. My first memory of life began, saddly, in conflict. While still very young, my parents went on their annual journey through Greater Faydark. They have always been a very generous and giving couple and have devoted their life to helping others. <br>
As a cleric of Tunare, my mother was gifted with great powers of healing. Walking amoung the less fortunate, she would bestow on any who needed it, her loving touch. In her wake, many saw the light of Tunare and were turned to Her glory.<br>
As a stout and faithful Paladin of Tunare, my father faught for what he believed, while protecting his love, my mother. Always where he was needed most, his great sword always ready, he battled evil at every turn, devoting HIS lift to the preservation of others. Sacrificing, at times, his life's blood, he has never backed down from what he feels is right...and just.<br>
At the age of the 4 turning, it was discovered that, though both my parents had the 'gift' of Tunare in them and could heal and cast clerical spells, I, saddly, was unable to. That didn't stop me from persuing a course for my life that would lead me to worship The Mother of All. With my claws and my shield...and soon, my sword, for I near my 13th turning...I fight for Her still.<br>
By the age of my 5th turning, my parents began to leave me at home alone, while they went out to help the multitude of Norrath. Upon this trip, a tragedy did strike them. Hearing of their exploits and feeling, quite often, their wrath, the dispised and yet still local infestation of orcs took it upon themselves to ambush my parents. Secretly hiding amoungest the trees and hills, they waited. When seeing my parents and determining that they were indeed alone, they attacked. Such vile cowardice and cunning did they imploy that my parents, though seasoned warriors and veterens of many a battle were taken by complete surprise. My father, sword always ready was able to hold them at bay without a scratch for only a few moments before the first spear did pierce his side. My mother, acting quickly, cast her greatest healing spell, knowing that the wound was mortal.<br>
With an annoyed grunt, my father yanked the spear from his body, watched briefly as the wound closed, smiling quickly to his wife. Turning back to the mass of orcs surrounding  them, he proceeded to cleave through them like a hot knife through butter. It was short lived, and the orcs stood not a chance. With my mother constant at his side, healing the minor wounds inflicted on him, they continued and soon finished off the last orc. <br>
Smiling to one another, they collected their things and prepared to move on, safe in the knowledge that Tunare has blessed them once again. But amoung the trees, hiden from view by the very life that makes up Faydark, hundreds of orcs still waited, and while my mother was meditating to regain her strength and my father also, they struck. Such fiery and brutality did the orcs use that it was, thankfully, quickly over. It pains me to say that but I would not wish lingering pain on anyone. <br>
Upon hearing this news, I did not think, I acted. Achieving my 9th turning while they were gone, I headed out, tracking as best I could the army of orcs. I soon came upon a trail beaten into the ground. Up ahead of me, I heard the voices of many orcs. Fury like none I have felt before coursed through my veins and without thinking, I rushed around the trees and bushes and sprang upon the unsuspecting orcs. Thrusting with my claws and bashing with my shield, I waded into them, their blood spraying everywhere. I soon went into a frenzy, receiving cut after cut upon my person. I felt no pain, for all I could see was my parents, laying in the road, dying or dead. Knowing that Tunare awaited me, I kept pushing myself...soon, my movements were mechanical in nature, for I had lost all feeling as my mind screamed out my pain and my body transfered that pain into pure hatred for this race. THEY KILLED MY FAMILY my mind screamed... THEY MUST ALL PAY!!!<br>
Nearing my own death, orcs rushing at me from every side, a strange..yet very beautiful thing happened to me. As orcish weapons pierced my body and my blood mingled with theirs, a warmth of unspeakable love and kindness filled me. It was so refreshing that my 'feeling' returned at once .. and I saw then what I had done. Still defending against the many orcs around me, I soon became revolted with the slaughter and mindless killing. It was as if Tunare herself had reaches out and touched me, willing me to stop this maddness. Instantly, an opening appeared to me, one that had to be from a higher entity. I did not wait, but sprang away, fleeing into the woods. My destiny did not lie here, rotting in the dirt at some orcs feet. I knew this now. Though I flee this hopeless battle now, I will return, strong and more able to handle this evil. I fled to live...I fled to survive.<br>
In the tree closest to where I had fought, a wood elf smiled. Having cast a spell of greater healing upon me, she had faded back into the cover of the trees. Seeing me escape with my life, she then turned her attention back to the orcs, who had seen the magical healing that had taken their kill away from them and had begun to search the nearby bushes and trees. Springing out from her cover, her morning star already descending upon the nearest orc head, she proceeded to simple walk through the mass of orcs that barred her way. Her smile was chilling to behold, I'm sure, for the orcs stood not a chance. In mere moments it was over. Without a backwards glance, she turned towards the cave entrance, that had been concealled from me, and entered the 'lions den'. <br>
Stumbling into my home, my family's home, I marvelled at my escape and subsequent arrival at safety. Who had healed me? It must have been Tunare Herself, it had to be. ....<br>
Days passed while I recovered from my harrowing experience at the entrance to Crushbone, for I soon discovered that that was were I had been. I also heard of the woman who had saved me, a high Priestess of Tunare. I knew it had to be so. I also heard that she temperarily cleared most of the orc infestation from Crushbone, before having, herself, to flee from certain death. And I then realized that fleeing was not a cowardly act, but a conscious need to survive, to fight again. With these new discoveries and this new outlook on my life, I proceeded to again, follow in my parents footprints. With a joy I had never dreamed of filling my heart, I went out and did what I could for those who needed my sword arm and my shield. Protecting any who needed it, I began what was to become....my new life....<br>
On a side note, someone special, someone so important to me has entered my life. She is, I believe, my other half of my soul. I give thanks to Tunare for bringing me this angel. I am ever indebted to both her and Tunare. They have helped me in more ways than can be said.....Blessed be...and safe journeys to everyone.<br>
