Boat trips, oh Bugger! - that trip from Freeport to Butcher, I spent 4 hours on that journey once, going LD halfway through the journey, frantically re-booting just in time to be back at the docks in Freeport again. A large amount of fleshy posterier!<br><br>2. Tass has experienced this more than once, and so have I. That annoying full on battle, most recently Tass and I cavorting with the undead in LOIO, with a less than excellent group to start with. An over ambitious pull of 3 Icebones, and you need every tank you can get your hands on. One member goes LD, we struggle on, we may lose but they will be back, wont they?<br><br>Of course, over the hill the cavalry comes, re-spawned and ready to.....bitch continuously about how they wont dive back into the battle until they've been re-invited to the group so they get exp! worse still, the looting of the corpses while the others are having their butts swatted. Even more disgusting, the disappearing Team, one goes LD, and all that can cast Camo/Invis/SOW and are gone - not so the Faithfull Pally/Warrior - or in my case Ranger, knee deep in Bone fragments, death to turn and run - hung out to dry.<br><br>It happend to Tass, Lead puller and main tank in the group, myself the other big Melee man, LD came to me - and I scrambled for the familiar process, Ctrl + Alt + Del - reset the modem, log back on to ISP - come on you stupid machine - password type, whirr, click and hey presto - 30 seconds, 45 max - There will be something to come back to, Tass is strong, and with a Druid there to heal, come on, come on. Over the hill I ride, spell half cast, both blades swinging already - To the site of Tassius' Corpse, no mobs, no team. <br><br>It seems they had got to arguing about whether the druid or the Bard should have dived into the fray to help Tass, that no-one noticed Tassius' death swings, his life draining away, Tass having used LOH on one of the party earlier. Despite Tassius calm requests for Heals, none were forthcoming. I arrived to 4 Invis characters, and some rather pointed /tells from Tass that we were outta there, and Could I drag his corpse, 'cos getting close to those vermin again would make him gag.<br><br>I blame LD, because clearly it makes people act irrationally - I refuse to believe that there are actually characters who could behave like this consciously.<br><br>I name no names here, I am not pure of deed - and mayhap I have turned up on another Guild's website as 'That smart ass Half-elf, who does he think he is refusing to run, making us all stay behind and take a beating, Can he not see that Our Tank is dead, it's time to run, to bug it, to cheese it big time, to be hot of the foot, to actually be one with the birds and turn chicken'<br><br>I'm Victus Fortis is what I am - That speaks for itself.<br><br>Grrrrrr!<br><br> <p>Semdayen Maa'Sankari<Br>Ranger of the 21st Season<Br>In the Service of Tunare<Br><Br>'I am not lost - this is the scenic route'</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/beverquestersofnorrath.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=galadriaculravenni>Galadria Culravenni</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 262<br> <font color=#8B4513>(5/31/01 4:02:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Link Death</span><hr size=1> Oh hon, been there, done that... Yes, repeated LD's do make the most patient and rational of us irrational at times! I've been in a group inside Splitpaw where I went LD several times in a row as did a number of my companions until the group finally split up somewhat acrimoniously. I think they were all good people, but it frayed the tempers of all, and of course the fact that it was such a highly dangerous zone and we were all a bit keyed up and on edge to begin with did not help...<br><br>I still agree with whoever it was the other night who suggested in guild chat that Verant create a new beastie for us to kill called LD...
