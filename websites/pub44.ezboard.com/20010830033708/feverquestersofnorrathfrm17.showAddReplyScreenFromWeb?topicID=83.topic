<br>
Long has Kemie wandered the face of Norrath now, dreaming in the shadows, the shadow of a dream. Daughter of the ranger Raven and his mysterious druid wife Vania, and half-sister to Galadria and Raynn, Kemie always somehow felt as one set apart, alone and isolated in spite of the family feeling her sisters tried to create for her. Perhaps the sense of separation arose from the mere fact of being a druid, for there is something in them all that encourages withdrawal at times from the general society of Norrath. This is not to say that Kemie and her kith have nothing to offer - not at all! Part of the problem is that they have too much to offer others - there are always demands for their services for SoW'ing and binding and teleporting once they are able, sometimes too many demands with too little thanks…. To be free of the clamor once in a while, most druids disappear into the wilds where they face foes in solo combat and learn and practice the fine art of &quot;kiting.&quot; This became then the pattern of Kemie's life - to give until she could give no more, then to slip away into the darkness alone amidst the shadows.<br>
<br>
On the same day that her sister Galadria first encountered Ordained in Crushbone, Kemie was present there as well, healing and buffing her sisters and brethren of the guild Victus Fortis as they battled orcs in celebration of Raynn's return and birthday. This followed a long period spent nursing Raynn back to health in the Kelethin area and bestowing the gift of her spells freely on all and sundry there, and as the evening wore on she became melancholy and increasingly withdrawn, the need to go off on her own somewhere growing deep within until she was compelled to rise and make her goodbyes to the group of guild youngsters and depart. As she reached the tunnel leading to Greater Faydark, Kemie came suddenly upon Influenced, the relative of Ordained, and paused in her flight, drawn like a moth to flame.<br>
<br>
She, who thought she had no more then to give, returned with the young ranger Influenced to the bowels of Crushbone's castle itself and guarded him and buffed him and healed him in need through hours of battle that flew swiftly, and when the fighting eased she sat with him on the banks of the moat and talked as the sun rose and moved halfway across the sky before they both realized the need for sleep and camped.<br>
<br>
Love comes upon us sometimes unexpectedly when we are least prepared. Heart calls to heart, and soul to soul, and in Influenced there was much that resonated within Kemie and fascinated her, drawing her to him night after night, as Galadria was at the same time pre-occupied with her Ordained. I know that little has been said in these histories of Influenced himself, lying in the shadow of the greatness of his better known relative as he does. Indeed, Ordained has oft belittled this younger man, and yet... His courage is undeniable, his skill with claw and blade the match of any true ranger, his prowess in battle against the evil foes of the goddess Tunare all that one could ask for in a warrior for the forces of good. His ready wit delighted Kemie as much as watching him fight Crushbone's orcs, and his attentiveness to her, his gallantry and willing devotion, invaded even her dreaming and indeed influenced her heart!<br>
<br>
In spite of this each went his or her separate way for a time, Kemie (renewed once more) giving her assistance to others where it seemed most needed, and Influenced continuing his training as the seasons turned one by one. Around the time that Galadria and Ordained were married, Kemie and Influenced found themselves both in the Lake Rathetear region, and learned to their delight that they were now able to group together. Alone on an island in the middle of the lake, the two honed their skills and refined their fighting techniques against an aviak encampment, and proved in fact that they were perfect complements each of the other in battle. He never failed to thank her for casting spells she did in fact give freely; she never failed to admire and praise his own triumphant blows and victories. And yet their duties called them once more separately to other lands and again they parted. They met for a wild night with other members of the guild in Cazic-Thule but had no chance to speak of the fondness and understanding that was growing between them. And then Influenced found his way to South Karana in the vicinity of Splitpaw, where he began to battle Tesch Mas Gnolls in deadly earnest, and Kemie, too, discovered in her heart reasons to visit this setting again and again.<br>
<br>
Most often when they found themselves in company, the duo chose to camp upon the hills of Paw itself, waiting for the evil gnolls to wander past them unawares and to pick them off one by one. Sometimes when others from Victus Fortis were in the area, they grouped with them to do valiant battle with most satisfying results. One night, however, misunderstanding rose between them and she spoke hasty words to him, driving him from her side before she could recall him as her heart dictated she must. Victory against the evil minions of Innoruk still triumphed, but for Kemie it was hollow without Influenced at her side. She fled afterwards to Kelethin and back to West Commons and North Karana and Butcherblock, the round after round of teleports and binds and SoW's an attempt to ease her conscience and appease the gods. She could not, of course, stay away from Influenced for he was too much a part of her, but it took time to heal the wounds of her rash words. Finding he was intent upon performing a quest that required him to traverse the continent, she gently offered her company as well as the SoW's and teleports that would cut the travel time to a third. The quest had no happy result itself, but once more understanding grew between them.<br>
<br>
Kemie dreams in the shadows, her life a shadow of a dream. She is compelled to give, and must oft alone dwell in the lands of Norrath without a companion by her side, doing the things her goddess requires of her, for this is her gift. Influenced, too, dreams in the shadows, his life a shadow of a dream. He is her true heart's ease, the one individual who knows her through and through and understands her; he is her gallant knight, her succor in need. He is the mate of her heart, the other half of her soul. Their love cannot be denied, no matter the trials of life in service to Tunare that compels them at times to be apart. And so it came to be that finding themselves once more upon the hill above Splitpaw embattled and battling gnolls, at long last they pledged their loyalty and faith and hearts one to the other and each took for a surname that of Dreamshadow, and henceforth shall both be known to all….<br>

<br>
Nothing can compare<br>
To the loneliness inside<br>
The fear and the emptiness<br>
That makes you want to hide<br>
<br>
It's presence is felt<br>
Through times misty curtain<br>
And just when you begin to think<br>
Just when you are certain<br>
<br>
It creeps back upon you again<br>
<br>
Cursed Fate deals to us<br>
This life which we must be<br>
Clouding our sight and our minds<br>
Making the road so hard to see<br>
<br>
Shrouded in shadow and covered in mist<br>
We stumble through this maze<br>
Never seeing, never knowing<br>
Our hearts encased in haze<br>
<br>
Shadowed by Fate..<br>
<br>
Walking with our eyes closed<br>
We always miss our goal<br>
But there comes a time in everyones life<br>
When deep in our core, our very soul<br>
<br>
We feel this need to turn aside<br>
Away from this shadowed way<br>
To stop and sit and admire the life<br>
For here we wish to stay<br>
<br>
At peace with ourselves...<br>
<br>
And from the shadows comes another<br>
Drawn as a moth to a flame<br>
Bringing with her such hope for you<br>
Brightly shedding through the darkness she came<br>
<br>
Her smile and wit have dazzled you<br>
Leaving you heartsour inside<br>
For in her company you are whole<br>
And Fate you have defied<br>
<br>
For she has entered your life..<br>
<br>
Walking through the shadows<br>
She appears and disappears at whim<br>
Through this sea of emotions she thrusts you<br>
For you to either wallow in, or swim<br>
<br>
Elusive til the end she leads you astray<br>
From the chosen path you've been given<br>
But without her by your side everyday<br>
Your heart would surely be riven<br>
<br>
This Dreamshadow lover....<br>
<br>
It is difficult to walk through life alone. But that was my fate, my destiny for so long. Giving of myself and and asking, and oft times never recieving, a thank you or compensation. I did this without thought for my own well being. I am selfless in my sacrifices to my friends and my loved ones. That's why Tunare beckoned to me. She called me to Her and bade me do Her will. I could not refuse. To look upon Tunare, the Goddess and Mother of All is to look upon purity. I was overwhelmed. But in Her service, I found my most lonely of times. The loneliest chapter of my life. Til Kemie.....<br>
<br>
Walking into my life, literally, out of the haze, she quickly found little cracks in my defenses and began to break through them. I was soon laid bare to her, for her to see. She saw all that I was and yet, she judged me not for my faults, my mistakes. She saw these things and she cared. Soon, it was obvious that I, too, cared for her. We began to join up for those frequent groups into the evil that has permeated Norrath and we found that we worked well together.<br>
<br>
I soon learned that her 1/2 sister, Galadria, was who my brother, Ordained, was destined to marry. I was overjoyed, for I had grown very attatched to Kemie, emotionally as well as mentally. I could no longer see myself fighting without her, being anywhere without her, yet she was always there for me. I admired that in her the most : her unwavering loyalty to me and her trust in me.<br>
<br>
Like struggling through the haze that follows a dream, I walked out of that dream and yet found myself in Ordained's shadow. Doing my best to catch up to him, I know that I am a long ways from that. But Kemie has made it possible for me to continue regardless. I no longer need to catch him, to compete with him. I am content with Kemie at whatever season we are in, at what ever turning. She is my dreamshadow....<br>
