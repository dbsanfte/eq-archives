new  to the world of Norrath at large, I nonetheless had many friends by now and had joined a guild of reputable reputation. I was content. I had gained my 21st turning on my own and was pleased. I chose the surname &quot;Silverbranch&quot; for my elven home's mightly oaks that, in just the right light, gleamed like molten silver. Ordained Silverbranch. A name of prestige, I thought.<br>
<br>
Soon after I gained my 21st turning, a cleric of my acquiantence soon got ahold of me. Nearing a lofty 39 turnings (my mind couldn't comprehend that high yet) I was glad to hear from him...til he saw my lvl and offered to..'power-level' me. I had heard of this 'PL' but was not sure how it would happen or how one would go about doing it. In my nievity, I agreed. We met up near the border of Lake Rathetear and the neighboring Rathe Mountains. I'd been through the mountains a time or two, but never stayed for long. My friend, a dwarf by the name of Pryan Lavidican, soon arrived and leading me, we ventured through Rathe Mountains. The journey was quick, thank the Gods, and soon we came to the border of Feerrott swamp. I remember unrest and the smell that was there...but this..THIS was much worse. I have met many races in my life so far and knew, right away, the stench of ogre. Not one, but what smelled like a whole CITY of them. Pryan soon confirmed my assumption when he said &quot;stay close and avoid all the ogre bouncers, they patrol randomly at times  through here.&quot; Becoming nervous, for I knew that if Pryan was this cautious, I had BETTER be too. And on that, we entered...<br>
<br>
I first noticed that the light simply went out. The darkness closed about me like a living thing, engulfing my senses so completely that I paniced. I'd have ran if Pryan wasn't still visible in front of me, just barely. He started off as if nothing was wrong and in my bravado, I followed without complaint. Casting SoW on myself, just in case, I followed. He led me through twists and turns, his heat signiture barely percieved by my IR vision. He disappeared from view one second to appear a few feet to the side the next. My heart almost left my throat each time as I knew nothing of this area. Thank the Gods I had my new teleport spells and had the one that would wisk me to Butcherblock up just in case. My new spells were all that actually made this barable. I knew that I was not helpless but this dark, smelly, HUGE swamp was new and I was ever cautious. <br>
<br>
We came upon a river that ran from one side of my vision to the other. Without hesitating, Pryan dived in. I followed, soon realizing he had left me so far behind, his little arms and legs kicking so fast. Though he waited on the far shore, I was terrified. I saw at the corners of my vision more crocs and could tell that they were way above me in power and strength. Clammering out of the water near Pryan, I stood for a second and watched the water in my wake churn slightly with the movement of some dozen or so unseen bodies. &quot;Come on&quot; Pryan said, leading me further along, my attention still on the water til it was out of view.<br>
<br>
After another few minutes, I could hear up ahead the sound of many voices. Though too distant to determine how many, it was alot. To my surprise, upon reaching a viewable point, I found out that the 'voices' were actually hisses from about 8 walking reptiles. Raising my eyebrows in surprise at Pryan, he motioned for quiet and snuck up to the closest one. Casting spells so fast that I could barely follow, he rooted the lizard, cast some powerful lightning spell of some kind and then cast this sparkly light spell. &quot;Kill it&quot; he said and sat down. I hestitated a second..&quot;Kill it before it gets away&quot; Pryan said again. Pulling out my weapon, I started in on it. It still could attack and when I was in range it's swing was so quick that I took the hit before I even knew I had. The club it wielded hit my left upper arm and it went numb. I nearly dropped my Testament to Venear it hurt so much, but I gritted my teeth and swung my own weapon. With a satisfying crunch, I watched as the lizard dropped to the ground, it's skull crushed. The influx of energy from my kill flooded my mind momentarily. Smiling at myself, I turned to Pryan. &quot;Did you get some experience from that?&quot; he asked. Nodding, he also smiled and cast a minor healing on me and we continued. Soon, looming ahead, a great pyramid appeared. Again without hesitation, Pryan lead me in..<br>
<br>
Passing through the temple entrance, for Pryan informed me this was indeed a temple to some evil god, we rounded a corner and came upon some small groups of other people. They appeared to be preparing to enter as well. Without stopping Pryan lead me around another corner, where 3 lizards stood guard. They hadn't seen us yet and so Pryan asked me to take a closer look, see if I thought I could take em. Looking around the corner again, I quickly got a fell for them and informed Pryan that I could, but only 1 at a time. Nodding, he told me to memorize my Invisibility spell and to cast on us both. Not questioning him, I mem'ed it, cast it and he lead me past these 3 guards and up to a set of double doors. Pushing them open slowly, he peered out, then ducked back in, motioned me to follow and lead me into a sizable courtyard.<br>
<br>
Chaos was the only word I could use to describe this...mess. People were running all over, some being followed by up to 3 and 4 lizards. Others were chasing down some that were bleeding green blood from numerous wounds. Pryan lead me through all this to a semi-quiet corner at the far end of the courtyard, where a large tree grew. &quot;Stay here&quot; he said and ran off. Within moments, he returned, followed closely by a lizard dressed in crude armor. In the same routine as the lizard outside, he rooted, cast some lightning spell a few times and then cast his sparkly one. &quot;Kill it&quot; he told me as he sat down, &quot;but only cast your DoT on it and hit it once, then sit and rest.&quot; Nodding, I did as he instructed and cast my Creeping Crude, my DoT from Tunare. Watching the lizard, I moved my arms, then my hands in the pattern taught to me by my guild master and 'felt' Tunare's touch as magic flowed from my inner being to engulf the lizard with 1000 stings. It's attention, I noticed, quickly shifted to me. Stepping back, I took a deep breath and then jumped in and began to swing my weapon. My first swing missed, as did the following 5 after. I was trying my damnedest to hit this walking iguana but somehow I just couldn't. Then, from its weaving body an arm shot out, clipping me so hard on the head that my next swing, on pure instinct, hit it a glancing blow to the snout. <br>
&quot;Good, step back and rest,&quot; I heard Pryan say.<br>
Stumbling back, my life's blood pouring from my head wound, I sat heavily behind Pryan, dazed. Then, almost before I knew it, a rush of...energy infused me! Looking up, I watched as the lizard grimaced and jerked this way and that. Giving out a last hideous hissing gasp, it collapsed to the ground, it's body still being biten by my DoT. The energy that infused me brought me back to some sense of sanity and I stood, prayed to Tunare and cast my healing upon myself. Sitting again, Pryan asked if I had recieved my experience and upon my answering yes, smiled and went running off again. He soon returned with another lizard and proceeded to follow the same pattern of root/DD/atone and then sit, while I Dot/attack and sat after. This went on for what seemed like forever, but before I knew it, I was gaining experience for each and ever kill. Within the first 1/2 hour to hour, I was nearing my next turning! I was so surprised that when the last lizard fell to the ground and I felt the rush of energy from it's death that the resounding gong in my head that was my instinct telling me I had gained a turning surely surprised me like no other. I jumped up, shouting &quot;DING 22!!&quot;. Smiling and congratulating me, Pryan ran off to get another lizard. Again and again he did this, for the next 4 hours, 8 hours....on the 10 hour, I had reached the lofty turning of 24! I was so surprised that I forgot I had new spells to get until Pryan reminded me. He then told me that we'd kill a few more to get a DeathBuffer (DB) and then I could go get my spells, for he was weary. Another 5 kills later, I realized I was about 2/5ths the way through 24 and informed Pryan of this. Nodding, he told me to go ahead and go while he camped near the entrance to the Temple of Cazic-Thule. Casting my pre-mem'ed teleport to Butcherblock, I waved good bye to Pryan as my portal opened and I stepped  through. .....heading for home again...<br>

It was fun - and my arogance has nothing whatsoever to do with having a full group of Cleric, Druid, Rogue, 2x enchanters and Me.<br>

Pulling those Aligators from the deep was excellent fun, even my bow worked underwater! - not sure on the physics of that at all!<br>
