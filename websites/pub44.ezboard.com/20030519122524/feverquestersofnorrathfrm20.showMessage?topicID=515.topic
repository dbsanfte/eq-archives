<br>
This isn't &quot;required&quot; reading, but I'd like to suggest that you read it all the way through anyway, whether or not you think you already know all you need to about this subject.  Sooner or later you WILL find yourself in a group where someone either does not understand, or unknowingly or deliberately takes advantage of a situation.  We're all here to enjoy the game, and sometimes doing things a certain way can make life easier for all, and the game experience better.  (And if any of you knows of any loot systems not mentioned here, please note them! Hehe...)<br>
<br>
In any good group, the key is COMMUNICATION, and loot rules are no exception.  It is YOUR responsibility to make sure you personally understand the rules that apply to any group you join, and if you are the group leader, make sure all members understand fully before you start fighting, and repeat the rules for any new person joining the group.  Later on, if it becomes obvious that someone is not following the rules, it is much easier then to straighten out pretty much anything that happens without creating problems.<br>
<br>
SPLIT ON OR OFF:  The first thing usually settled is whether or not you should have group autosplit on or off.  Personally I prefer it on in most cases, as that way everyone is getting something even if for some reason they are not looting.  But there are many reasons to have it off.  The most common of these is if there is a monk in the group.  Monks suffer an AC penalty for exceeding a certain weight limit, and mounting totals of copper and silver pieces can be a pain for them to deal with.  But even then, certain group dynamics can affect the way things should be handled to be fair.  If you have healers in the group, for instance, they may be compelled to spend so much time medding to regain or maintain mana that they rarely get a chance to loot.  So it may be better to suggest to the monk that he or she simply drop copper and/or silver now and then, rather than have split off.  Whenever you are a part of deciding if loot split should be on or off, remember that everyone's needs should be taken into account, and try to do what is most fair.  General loot systems can increase in importance if split is off...<br>
<br>
I.  GENERAL LOOT RULES.<br>
<br>
FFA LOOTING:  Free-for-all, or FFA looting, is one of the most common group loots.  Sometimes you will hear it called &quot;FFA with honor,&quot; although naturally everyone hopes any free-for-all looting will be done justly.  Basically you are free to loot when you feel the need to, but are expected to pay attention at the same time and make sure you aren't taking more than your fair share and hence guilty of what some will feel is &quot;ninja&quot; looting.  Again, healers and other casters may be compelled to sit and med and miss out too often.  If this is your role in a group using FFA, don't be afraid to say once in awhile if you are not getting a chance to loot and want some.  This can either be called to the attention of the leader, or in a lull you can simply mention in group chat (jokingly helps!) that you'd like them to leave you one now and then. If someone in a group seems EITHER to be looting more than their fair share or missing out totally and you notice, either point it out to the group leader or find some other way to bring it to the attention of the looter, rather than make a big deal about it.  Sometimes people do this without realizing it, and if the case is too much looting resent what they feel is an accusation.  And sometimes they know full well they are taking advantage of the situation.  They'll usually either stop when attention is called to it, or leave the group, either of which makes things more pleasant for the rest.  With this type of looting, split may be either on or off, depending on other factors.<br>
<br>
ALPHA LOOTING:  Quite simply of course, this system follows in alphabetical order according to the names of the group members.  It requires either that everyone keep track, or that one person is in charge of remembering who the last one to loot was, and whose turn is next.  Again, auto-split may be on or off.  I've seen this one get really complicated with other things thrown in.  Personally, I like it simple and am perfectly willing to take my chances on general loot dropping from the mobs designated as mine.  Sometimes a group I have joined, however, considers it fair only if the person whose turn it is gets to continue to loot all mobs until something of value turns up, after which it is the next person's turn…<br>
<br>
ML or MASTER LOOTING:  This is rarely used in general groups, but I have seen it there.  Most often it is used in guild camps or raids, where it can save everyone a lot of grief.  One person is designated as the Master Looter, and loots all mobs.  Later the items, or the proceeds from their sale, is shared out equally to members of the group.  Auto-split is always off here.  Although it's one of the best systems, it too has its drawbacks and complicated twists that may be thrown in.  I was in a group in HighKeep that used this system.  No split was to be done unless someone was leaving the group, but usually the ML'er hadn't yet gone to sell when this happened.  Rather than make a fuss, I saw members leave time after time without getting their share.  If someone went LD and was replaced, which also happened several times, they were also out of luck and loot.  This group did, however, try to roll or otherwise agree on any more valuable drops found, so that some loot was given out immediately.  It was still very awkward.  In a guild raid situation, the Master Looter needs to keep lists of everyone who is there, and possibly the length of time each participates as well.  He usually has as well a list of particular items people are looking for, and determines from that who gets them or if an item is to be sold.  It's a position of extreme trust and must be handled in a fair manner.<br>
<br>
OTHER:  Sometimes you or someone else in a group may not be there for loot, or care especially about any of the general loot drops.  If this is the case, you (or they) should make this clear from the start.  This can affect any of the loot systems above and how they proceed.  In other cases, particular items of no special worth to the rest but useful to an individual might be the only things a group member really cares about getting.  Examples of this are gnoll or orc scalps for faction in Highpass, Sarnak warbraids again for faction in Overthere, words or pages or runes which are useful to specific casters, and such items as succulent sap which can be used by some rogues to make poison, eggs that can be used by bakers, skins or silks by tailors, etc.  Some quest ingredients are also on this list.  It won't cost you more than a moment or two of your time to ask if anyone in the group needs this (especially if it is no-drop) and by doing so you may end up earning a lot of good will.<br>
<br>
II.  SPECIAL LOOT RULES.  <br>
<br>
ROLLING FOR LOOT:  The most common approach to special loot drops from named mobs is to have everyone in the group roll for them.  (If you've never done this, each member types /ran 100 and the highest number wins.)  I've seen this carried to extremes where a roll was done every time anything worth even a few plat was looted, which seemed an obvious waste of time, but some prefer it that way….   <br>
<br>
NEED BEFORE GREED:  Another method popular especially in guilds is &quot;need before greed.&quot;  If a drop is limited in its actual use to certain classes or races present in the group, those persons are understood to have first choice, and if any of them already have the item, it goes to the one who does not.  Presumably if more than one lacks it, either they roll for it or the person with the higher &quot;need&quot; gets the item.<br>
<br>
FARMS, RAIDS OR CAMPS FOR SPECIAL ITEM DROPS:   If someone, a guild member or otherwise, is farming or camping a mob for a specific drop, you may or may not end up in a group with them.  If someone else is doing so, it is most considerate to ask before you infringe.  You or your group might be able to take on most mobs at a camp as long as the other person or group has sole right to the one they are after, and as you may be in the same position some time, courtesy counts.  If you or your group also wants the specific spawn or mob, be patient and wait your turn or come back another time.  <br>
     <br>
If you form or join a group to go after a special item, make sure all of you understand any special circumstances.  Are you going to help an individual get the drop he or she needs?  Or do you all have equal rights to that drop?  If you are assisting, then the person you are helping should ALWAYS be the person to loot the mob, and wether or not they do so in a timely fashion or waste the opportunity is not your business, although you can certainly urge them to do it as soon as possible.  IF you all have a shared interest in the item, then make sure you either agree in advance who gets the first one and proceed from there, or roll when the item drops each time, with those who already have it opting out afterwards.<br>
     <br>
It's also extremely helpful, when entering a zone to farm, raid or camp, to shout out to the zone at that time asking for a CAMP CHECK.  This will tell you right away, or most of the time, whether or not the mob you want is already camped.  Once in a while though, the individual or group already in possession may be too busy fighting just then to respond.  It helps to shout it as screen colors for that are more obvious than out of character, and to ask more than once before assuming the camp is empty.  Some of our members have already learned that although there are special camps you can sign up for in advance, not everyone reads calendars and may therefore inadvertently interfere with your plans.  This is frustrating, but remember it's not the end of the world, please! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  There's no mob on EQ that won't spawn again in due time, and although you many not appreciate having to wait for the next one, this is after all just a game and not a life or death matter.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
In general, it is better to loot corpses as soon as possible and get them out of the way.  Casters will tell you if you ask that corpses lying around the fighting area can interfere with targeting players for heals or buffs.  This is more of a problem if the caster is outside the group assisting, as of course within the group targeting can be accomplished by clicking the person's name to get it in the target window, or by using the F keys...  Hehe... so clean up your messes, but please DO try to keep looting as fair and orderly as you possibly can whether fighting with your guildmates or with others.<br>

Remember guildies that we are not trying to tell you what to do, just noting some &quot;unwritten&quot; rules of the game for all to see.  You may of course choose any which way to loot you like, with your group <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Just remember that communication is the most important thing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/ugladriellumenaura.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gladriel Lumenaura</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Officer of Victus Fortis</span><br>  Posts: 226<br> <font color=#8B4513>(10/15/01 12:57:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=515.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A GUIDE to GROUP LOOT RULES</span><hr size=1> A few alternatives I've come across:<br>
<br>
1. GREED BEFORE NEED - Works best in pick-up groups, every item is up for grabs by the whole group. It has the benefit of avoiding any ambiguity over who really needs an item - but it is important to state the rule in advance.<br>
<br>
2. RAN 100 - The most common use of this is that everyone in the group rolls just once and the highest roll gets first pick of the loot, second highest gets second pick etc. This can save an awful lot of rolling about <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
3. If there is only one really valuable item up for roll, the group leader can assign a number between 0 and 5 for each group member. The leader then rolls /ran 6.<br>
<br>
4. NEED BEFORE GREED - is often very tricky. One suggestion I have made before and has been well received by the groups I was in, is that if a person is claiming NBG then the item which the loot replaces is the included for the rest of the group to roll on. For example, if someone has a Skyfire sword and wants to claim NBG on a Crystalline Short Sword then the Skyfire is put up for grabs by th rest of the group. This goes some way to ensuring that someone who is claiming NBG is REALLY in need of it.<br>
