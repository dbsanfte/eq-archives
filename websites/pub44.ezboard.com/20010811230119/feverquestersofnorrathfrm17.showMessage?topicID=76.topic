<br>
&quot;Yes mother, I am.&quot; came a tired reply.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come dear.  Tragedy has stricken your family.  Your mother and brothers have been slain!  We must ride swiftly through the woods, using the darkness as our shield.&quot;<br>
<br>
Raloth leaped out of bed with the speed of an enraged cougar on the hunt.  He did not realize right away that there was no one in his room.  Quickly he ran out into the living area of his family's modest hut, in search of the source of the voice that sounded strangely like that of his mother.   What he found instead was an Orc Scout rumaging through their belongings ... apparently the scout had decided to take a few things for himself before his posse arrived.   Either way, Raloth knew that whatever time he had before the others arrived was short to say the least.<br>
<br>
With the agility of a cat and the strength of a lion, Raloth leaped into the air and landed a Cresent kick up against the side of the Orc's head.  Stunned, the beast fell back a few steps, moaning and groaning something Raloth could not understand.  Quickly the Orc regained his bearings, and unsheathed a rusty-looking longsword, and took a swipe at Raloth's mid-section.  <br>
<br>
Raloth was simply to quick for the weaker Orc, and the sword hit nothing but the humid air.  The miss caused the Orc to fall to the side slightly, and Raloth took advantage of the situation.  A lightning fast uppercut smashed the teeth of the gnoll straight up into the ridge of its mouth.  Blood and broken teeth gushed out like a river, and the Orc let lose a howl of pain so terrible, so painful, that even Raloth paused for a moment.<br>
<br>
He stood looking at the shattered face of his blood-enemy.  He knew this particular one was not responsible for the death of his mother.  Something inside his soul told him that.  But Raloth new that if it was left alone to live that it might do something the same to another innocent victim.<br>
<br>
With a calculated move, Raloth leaped into the air, and smashed his knee into the shattered jaw of the wounded Orc.  More teeth fragments shot out of the beasts mouth, and the teeth that were lodged at the top of its jaw were shoved into its brain.  The beast dropped, lifeless and bloody.<br>
<br>
Raloth stared at the Orc's corpse for a few minutes. until he heard the noises outside.  He ran to the window and could see the movements of more Orcs in the deeper shadows, their blood red eyes gave away their location.<br>
<br>
Fuming, yet resolute and strangely calm, Raloth took a few steps to the door.  He could count six of them within eyesight, but he knew in reality that there was at least another four lurking around in the shadows behind them.  He did not care.  His mind was clear and focused.  He only sought one, and for some strange reason he even knew which one it would be.  The others ... well ... they were just in the way.<br>
<br>
Just as Raloth opened the door, chaos let loose its reign upon his once humble and quiet dwelling place ...<br>
<br>

Swiftly they moved in for the kill, lunging towards the house.<br>
<br>
By all means, Raloth would have died that day.  He was, after all, only a monk in training.  There were just too many Orcs for him to take by himself, and at the time the only thing Raloth was hoping to accomplish was to get at the Orc responsible for the death of his family.  It was at this point of Raloth's life that Quellios stepped in, and supported one of his loyal followes.<br>
<br>
A crashing boom echoed all around the house as the God reigned down his wrath upon the Orcs that lunged at Raloth.  Chain lightning streaked out from one single location, forking out multiple times to strike the chests of all the orcs around the house.  The smell of burnt Orc flesh spread quickly throughout the air, and Raloth stood in utter amazement.<br>
<br>
&quot;Child.&quot; came a low, yet powerful voice.  Raloth was stunned.  He felt a holy energy enter his mind and soul, and without knowing it, he dropped to his knees and lowered his head to the ground, keeping his eyes closed.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are wise not to look at me, Child.  I have saved you today, and you know who I am.  There is no need for introductions of any kind.  I come in your moment of need, because fate drew me to you.  I know your pain, and I feel your angst, but do not let it consume you.  You have a special role to fill for me, Child.  You have a destiny that not many people shall ever experience.  You will serve me well,  and the people of Norrath shall see in you a light of hope and an example of determination.  You serve me as a Monk, and a Monk ye shall be!  Train hard, and represent me in all things you do.  Never slight the innocent, and never have mercy to the ultimate evils.  There is a balance, and that balance ye need to find.  My quest for you is understanding, and once you complete it ye shall know ultimate power on earth, and your spirit shall secure itself a place in the heavens by my side, and your family who is there now!&quot;<br>
<br>
Raloth gasped at the mention of his family.  He felt joy fill his soul at the thought of seeing his mother again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes Child, they are with me now, and ye shall see them again if you remain true to your ideals.  Before I leave, I have a final gift for you!&quot; said the voice, and right after a loud thunderous roll came rolling through the sky, and all was silent in the Commons.<br>
<br>
Raloth kept his head lowered for what seemed to be an eternity, and only after a long time if silence did he dare raise his gaze, and not a moment too soon!  An orc, fully armoured, was standing at the edge of the forest, with the head of a woman in its hands.  Raloth recognized the head right away, and if it was not for his God telling him of his mothers happiness, Raloth would have lost himself in rage at the very moment.  But, instead he slowly stood up, never taking his gaze away from the Orc.  The Orc sneered at him, and began to speak.<br>
<br>
&quot;Filthy Humanan ... youra disgustan sights for me eyezes!&quot;<br>
<br>
Raloth said nothing, and slowly walked toward the Orc.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whyz am I herezes?  Whatz did you doozes to me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You killed my mother.&quot; Raloth said in reply, never blinking and never taking his gaze away from the red and evil eyes of the Orc captain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bah!  I havez killedzes many wenchezes!  Now I kill joo humanzes!&quot; shouted the Orc as he charged Raloth, drawing a wicked looking bastard sword with gnome skin wrapped around its hilt.<br>
<br>
Raloth never stopped his stride, and instead kept walking as slowly and as calmy as he was a moment ago.  He felt the presence of his family in his heart, and new that nothing would harm him at that very moment.  <br>
<br>
The Orc Captain came in and swung his blade at the side of Raloth, striking his with inhuman force.  The blade just passed through his body cutting nothing but air!<br>
<br>
&quot;Whatzes?!&quot; the Orc shouted.  &quot;Whatzes is going onzes!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Raloth did not reply, and kept walking right through the Orc.  It was almost as if he was walking in an amongst two different planes!<br>
<br>
&quot;Come backzes here humanzes!&quot; shouted the Orc, swing his sword again at Raloth's head.  Raloth stopped, and the sword once again passed through his space without hitting flesh.  Calmly he turned around and faced the Orc, and the beast let out a terrible scream.  Raloth's eyes were totally white!<br>
<br>
An energy surrounded Raloth, crackling throughout his body, like lightning.  He pointed his fingers towards the stunned Orc, and a strike of magical energie shot forward, jolting the Orc right off his feet, sending him back over ten feet.<br>
<br>
The corpse of the Orc crashed into the side of the hut, and Raloth fell down at the same time, physically drained and mentally confused.  He had no idea why the energy came, or if it would ever do so again.  It was then he decided to travel the lands as a Wandering Monk in search of the answer to his question!<br>
