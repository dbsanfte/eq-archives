Packing up my few belongings, I strapped on my weapons and armor and proceeded to the Butcherblock docks. Having reached my 13th turning, I felt quite safe to travel alone along this otherwise treacherous route. <br>
<br>
The abrupt change from Greater Faydark to Butcherblock Mountains was, to say the least, astonishing! From light to dark it seemed, with the sky above me so blue, the colors of the grass and trees so vibrant. With a smile on my face, I started across these mountains with nothing but hope in my heart.<br>
<br>
As with all dreams, the one dreaming must awaken. At times, most unexpectedly. Jogging along, my weapons secure against my person, I was made aware of this things presense by the bashing it delivered to my back as I was passing. Surprised more than anything, I turned to find myself looking up at this 10 foot ... I think it's called an ogre...<br>
&quot;Me Corflunk!! Me MASH you little eufie!&quot;<br>
<br>
Having sustained VERY minor damage from his first surprise attaack, I knew that I would have no trouble with this thing. Though I feared the smell alone would kill me, I drew my Langseax and my Walrus Tooth and stood, awaiting it's charge. The tales and stories I heard of these creatures never did them justice. They were DUMBER than they were portraied to be. Corflunk stood there, looked me up and down, especially my blades, and smiled his toothless smile and charged me.<br>
<br>
Sweat soaked my leather padding underneath my armor, even though I thought I could kill him with ease. Training taking hold of me, I duck under it's clumsy swing and jabbed with my Tooth, leaving a bloody hole just under its armpit. Howling in pain, it's back swing nearly took off my head. Dancing back on the balls of my feet, I run my blades through a quick defensive pattern, readjusting the balance of my weapons in my hands .... then, I wade in. Swinging with my Langs, leading to push this ogre into a defensive posture, then with my elven agilty, I stab straight for its throat with my Tooth. Piercing his skin with ease, my Walrus Tooth sank to the hilt, his blood gushing out over my hand and upper arm. Yanking it back, I found it lodged in the back of its throat, jammed between its neck vertebrae. What I didn't expect was that in its death throws, it swung out blindly, striking me a solid blow to the left temple. He literally sent me flying...and without casting Levitate on me too. I landed in a heap at the base of a giant oak tree, my armor taking the brunt of it but the blow, having landed on my unprotected head, sent me into the oblivion....<br>
<br>
Needless to say, I awake, still against the oak tree. Clearing my head as best I could, I gathered up my things, gave Corflunk's corpse one last look. Shaking my head, I continue my interrupted journey. <br>
<br>
I arrive at the docks in Butcherblock without further delay. Stepping onto the docks, I was struck by the simple thought...&quot;Will this hold me?&quot; Feeling silly, for I soon saw others waiting at the end, I realized that this was dwarven made. Dismissing my doubts, I arrived at the end of the dock just in time to see the boat coming into view. My heart pumping with excitment, I farely leaped onto the boat...and once it began to move, my smile broadened. &quot;AT LAST&quot; I thought....&quot;I'm finally going on a real adventure!&quot; Little did I know that my adventure would start...with the most boring part first : my boat ride.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
Arriving in East Freeport, I quickly shouted out for a bind. Surprisingly, I was answered right away. Meeting this .. caster..at the Eastern gate, I watched in amazement as he cast his spell. Gathering from the air itself, he pulled 'mana' to him and spun them with his will and hands. Forming his spell, he throw his 'mana' at me and I could feel my essense 'bind' to this spot. As the 'mana' flushed through my system, I felt a sense of .. invulnerability! Such power! When the 'mana' left my system completely, I was left with a sense of.. lose? Is that was casters feel, I wondered....still thinking on this, I began my run south....<br>
<br>
Passing to the left and near the shore, I managed to pass through the Northern Ro desert without incident. With the heat bearing down on me like a ton of ogre lard, I felt myself pass over that 'zone' line and when I blinked again, I was facing this ... Caimen. A croc of this size standing in front of me? My first true sight of it left me breathless. Without thinking about what I was doing, I dropped my pack, drew my weapons and proceeded to attack it. Boy, was I in for a surprise!<br>
<br>
My first swing hit. I smiled as I began my first defensive pattern, anticipating that this .. 'animal'.. would try and retaliate. what I didn't anticipate was that it would use sheer muscle and power. His mouth closed over my sword AND lower arm, its teeth biting heavily into my bracer. So surprised was I that I didn't even yell out in pain. Bringing my Walrus Tooth down on it's snout, I smashed repeatedly til it let go, then it snapped at me again. Jumping back in fright this time, I avoided it barely and swung my langs again, scoring yet another cut. Dodging as best I could and trying to do enough damage to it so that I could tell I was doing something, I took hit after hit, my life's blood pouring down my body. Gritting my teeth, I yelled out my frustration and dived back in. This time, when it snapped at me, I took the blow on the shoulder armor and drove my Tooth in just behind its eye while my Langs slide in under its throat, cutting it wide open. Remembering my recent experience with Corflunk, I rolled off the back of the Caimen, it's body convulsing in it's death throws as well. Leaving my Walrus Tooth embedded in its brain, I backed away to watch it die..and something a friend said in Fay came to my mind then. <br>
&quot;Should I make a tunic or shoes out of my frist croc?&quot;<br>
Having barely survived my first encounter with a Caimen, I knew that my friend was probably trying to figure out how to get out of the crocs belly by this time....<br>

<br>
Thoran's surprise that day in Crushbone when he, then in his higher 20's at the very least if not his 30's, first encountered Retlon Brenclog...<br>
<br>
Galadria's first trip alone to turn in orc belts in Kaladim - plodding down the path, head down, concentrating on remembering the turns and handy shortcuts, all of a sudden near stunned with a mighty dwarven blow to the head! Not all dwarves in Butcherblock are elven friends... there are sometimes bandits about who hate our race (not to mention want any money or valuables we carry) and they will kill you if they can. Luckily for Galadria she was not too far from one of the many guard posts and fled in time to duck past the doughty guards, who slew her attacker before she had time to catch her breath.<br>
<br>
Kemie's first taste of Oasis... conveyed there by an enchanter friend who had been a druid in a former life, she was shown the basics of the art of kiting and then left alone to try the tactics on a wandering caimen. He'd made it look SO simple! Poor Kemie was more than two-thirds dead and almost out of mana by the time the beast lay dead at her feet. She could only collapse in the sand, over-heated and exhausted, and far too vulnerable had any of the other beasties there come upon her while she recovered! I must confess she had to steel her will after hesitating long and hard, before she ever tried tackling the second!<br>
<br>
