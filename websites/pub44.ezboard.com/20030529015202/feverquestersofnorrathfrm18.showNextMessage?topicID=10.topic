The first 2 are a 60 troubadore and 57 Luminary (shammy).  They are kind of like gods.  <br>
<br>
I decided once that I wanted to acquire some singing steel boots.  They are a planar drop and cost around 1k.  I was looking and looking for some to buy, then Sierrus (who'm I knew, but did not know I wanted the boots) sent me a tell asking him to meet him, for he had a pressie for me - the SS boots.<br>
<br>
Recently I decided I wanted to buy a Yak (short sword of the Ykesha) which is about 1k.  I commenced a looking and low and behold a couple of days later Chodeus (who'm I knew, but he did not know that I was after a yak) had a pressie for me.  A nice Yak, 8/24 procs 75 DD at lev 37. <br>
<br>
The boots btw have a proc as well, at lev 45.  It was a massively unbalancing proc &quot;summon drink&quot; lol.  I would right click and it would say &quot;you are not of sufficient level to cast this spell [summond drink]&quot;.  Now the proc is at least useful, levitation.<br>
<br>
Taeren ~43 stood with me for over 30 mins one day in LOIO giving me lots of good advice about bardom.  Yet another worthy soul.<br>
<br>
This part of the boards is a good idea, however there are so many out there that have done great things for us that I imagine (hope) it will be very full. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/beverquestersofnorrath.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=galadriaculravenni>Galadria Culravenni</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#8B4513>(4/5/01 8:28:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Chodeus, Sierrus and Taeren</span><hr size=1> Hip hip hurray! for the heroes assisting Luni...<br>
<br>
Yes, yes, Lunitune - I have thought on this a lot. I have met so very many kind and helpful people in the world of Norrath myself that I really ought to drop some names as well. <br>
<br>
Kahrd - currently up there in the high 30's early 40's with his enchanter, he formerly raised a druid to over 50 and was kind enough to take Kemie to Oasis and teach her to kite and give her other druid-type pointers. Evidently he has assisted any number of druids to master their skills in the past. As our acquaintance has been very brief and intermittent, his assistance was spectacular.<br>
<br>
Ezander - another high level druid who took an interest in raising Kemie, last seen at level 45... He has other chars he plays so has more or less retired this one due to &quot;hell levels.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nabosu - again a druid, who just hit 50 and is presently a member of Elddar Caste ... this guy was one of my first friends in the game with a somewhat flighty secondary character - so flighty my other friends wondered what I saw in him. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  He has a heart of gold however (or maybe just where I am concerned!) He has teleported groups I was in free gratis and stopped to buff and assist the same. Sometimes people neglect to thank him, not understanding the enormous amount of mana involved and that druids rarely give such gifts for free... This guy did my a service once better than any guide or GM could have managed - back when we had that crash a month or so ago that took the server down so long, I had just single-handedly taken out the royal guard in Crushbone, and looted TWO bronze pieces from him (a very rare drop even for one) under the influence of someone's super buffs and gone on to kill a couple of legos and was fighting two slavers in the caves when kaBOOM... when the server came back up I was still in the slave cave and luckily killed the slavers on me, but lo and behold the experience I had gained (very important at the time and quite a chunk) and the bronze items were missing... it was as if time had forgotten me, erasing the entire epic victory from the annals of history! Well sometimes GM's can restore lost items if a previous save shows them in your possession (frustratingly, mine DIDN'T show them, the past several also getting wiped out) but they cannot restore lost experience. Nabosu on learning of this and of my tears over the whole thing (yes, I cried!) buffed me and took me into Crushbone and proceeded to pull the high level mobs from the castle tower (royal guard twice, D'Vinn, Crush, emissary...) so I could have my revenge. WHAT a sweetie...<br>
<br>
Tisharmo - this lovely chanter somewhere around level 40 is also one of the nicest guys around... He lives in Italy and I haven't seen him in Norrath recently. Last time he passed by and buffed my entire group not a single one of them bothered to notice him, let alone say thanks, and such lack of courtesy hurts those kind enough to care to help.  He has another character Armonico, around 25th lvl bard, who is also enormously helpful to others and an excellent fighting companion.<br>
<br>
Jordan - last heard from at about level 54, this ranger was one of the first acquaintances my daughter ever made in the game, when he stopped to help her out as a newbie on Lanys...<br>
<br>
So there's my honor roll for the moment. If you run into any of these characters in the game, know that Galadria and Kemie have reason to love them for their kindnesses and the honor of their friendship, and if they give you buffs or anything else whether she is or isn't around, please thank them; they deserve it!<br>
<br>
Galadria<br>
&quot;My joy is in giving&quot; (but I have received much as well) <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm18.showPrevMessage?topicID=6.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm18.showNextMessage?topicID=6.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm18.emailToFriend?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm18.threadControl?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm18.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=6.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm18.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=6.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub44.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm15">Questing<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm16">Gatherings of the Brave<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm17">Tales and Roleplay<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm18">Honour Role <option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm19">Dishonourable Denizens<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm20">General Forum<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm21">Officers Lounge<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm22">Guild Tavern<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm23">Vault of the Brave<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm24">High Council Forum<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm25">Bazaar of the Brave</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8B4513>- </font><a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/beverquestersofnorrath>Discussions for the Brave</a><font color=#8B4513> - </font><a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm18>Honour Role </a> <font color=#8B4513> - </font><a href="http://victusfortis.n3.net">Home of Victus Fortis</a><font color=#8B4513> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
