Someone will pull a mob, someone will cry KS without even giving them a half decent chance, or seeing it from their side. Camps are nice, but when everything is CAMPED then expect some people soloing to take a few pulls from your 'camp'. unfortunately, there's no &quot;dungeon full, go hell&quot; sign at the zone in, so play like there isn't.<br><br>Also, I'll be wandering around and I'll see some dude in trouble, or what looks like trouble to me. I'll toss a heal, or when I get frustrated when &quot;not taking hold&quot; or &quot;too powerful&quot;, I'll drop the mob with a nuke or if it's a real noobler, my mace. Now, I never deal any damage unless a mob is clearly past half life. I never got the kill on any of them in living memory. Yet often I'll either be abused for &quot;trying to KS&quot;, or for &quot;not helping&quot; when I get annoyed at being bitched at helping people and stop doing it, or if I'm feeling grumpy (I'm the moodiest bitch with a schlong... read that how you will).<br><br>Also, I res ANYONE indescriminate of who or what affliliation they are of. Unless they did something to me, I'll res anyone INTRA ZONE, and YOU DRAG TO ME. I don't mind requests for reses elsewhere, but you better find me a port and accomodate me. However, if i'm in a good mood, I'll run there w/ or w/o a port, and in one case, sat with the rogue after res and buffed her to make sure she PP'd her epic piece in neriak (I'm a high elf). But if I say no, it MEANS NO GET A FUCKING CLUE. I'm not here to serve you, you're not here to serve me. Don't harass, don't piss me off, or next time I won't even res you in zone.<br><br>Now, I'm bored sitting there soloing blues and some level 60 comes up to me and says aego plz... I respond, don't have the mana to spare. He replies, &quot;I'll wait while you med&quot;. WTF? Aego is 750 mana, 1/5 of my buffed mana pool, no fucking way am I going to waste 4 mins so you can solo better, not to mention the peridots my guild gave me (thx charist!). Once again, I'm not here to servce you. If you're dying, I'll toss you a heal ONCE or TWICE. I fucking hate gimps who think I'm dumb enough not to see them manipulating me by &quot;getting into trouble&quot; every pull. If that happens, I just mem atone, atone it till it's wiped, then nuke. You asked for help, and you thought I was stupid, take it like a sailor.<br><br>Another thing, I hate clerics who charge an arm and a leg for reses. I never accept pp even when it's put into a trade window, or when someone tries to force me to take it by /splitting it. I find it nice that you're willing to offer gratitude, and don't get annoyed when people are sometimes damned stubborn trying to give me pp. But I hate clerics/druids who say &quot;no&quot; until they see the magic number light up, and they're suddenly not busy. You res or port, or you don't. Don't wait for some fool to offer you the day's pp. If you're busy, fine, don't do it. But don't milk people. On the other hand, if someone offers, sure. But don't wait for them to up the offer cause you know they're desperate. do it or don't.<br><br>And be fucking polite, don't be an asshole and use wil u plz rez me, have the courtesy to type in the extra x letters. and no I will not leave a guild raid to come res you...<br><br>well, that's my rant which swiftly shifted to clerical rant. I know some may only agree with parts of what I said, but I'm pretty sure every high level cleric can identify with the necro who was kiting IG's harrassing you for a res.<br><br>Oh, and if you see someone do something like CR another group, return the favor even if it wasn't your group. Or return a favor for a favor. You want a res? okay, port me afer. Or C2 me. Or do something. And if you c2 me, port me, or whatever for free... guess what, I'll go to greater lengths to get you resed in the future. If you c2 me or something, even tho it's far less mana, of course I'll give you an aego. it shows you see I'm not your slave, you're willing to barter your services in a way that's useful to me, so you get it. Tanks that need aego for something other then soloing or whatever, or anyone else, I will aego them. Even tho a click is free their xp isn't.<br><br>Oh, P.S. if you're a necro, fricking dump all your mana on me before I res. I shouldn't have to ask. it's doing you no good since you're going to be resed, and it'll do me a world of good. And I'm bored waiting for servers. <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/fantoniusbaylecommunitycentrefrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=91.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/uzilla11.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zilla11</A> </span><br><br> <span class=usertitle>The handsome</span><br>  Posts: <b>59</b><br></td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#6699F>Posted: 1/8/02 2:23:28 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Re: People jumping to conclusions.</span><hr size=1> /cheer <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/fantoniusbaylecommunitycentrefrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=91.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/u13thshade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>13th Shade</A> </span><br><BR><img src=http://www.multimania.com/titrenhex/tdance.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60><br> <span class=usertitle>Ry'gorr Elite</span><br>  Posts: <b>87</b><br></td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#6699F>Posted: 1/8/02 3:30:02 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Re: People jumping to conclusions.</span><hr size=1> Amen <p><center><img src="http://www.multimania.com/titrenhex/Titrn.jpg" border="0"></center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=36212><b><i><center>Magelo Profile</center></i></b></a></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/fantoniusbaylecommunitycentrefrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=91.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/uheka01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Heka01</A> </span><br><br> <span class=usertitle>Gnoll Commander</span><br>  Posts: <b>19</b><br></td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#6699F>Posted: 1/8/02 3:47:49 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Re: People jumping to conclusions.</span><hr size=1> I'm not a cleric, I very rarely play my druid, but that rant (not really a rant) makes so much sense.<br><br>The number of times I have seen people drop what they were doing to go and res/CR/gate/buff/do some random act of kindness for people they don't even know astonishes me sometimes.<br><br>How anyone gets off with not being their politest to people who help out this way boggles me totally.<br><br>Even as a Warrior you can help out a cleric who has ressed you by pulling for him/her or something to help em solo, or at the least force a stack of Peridots on em.
