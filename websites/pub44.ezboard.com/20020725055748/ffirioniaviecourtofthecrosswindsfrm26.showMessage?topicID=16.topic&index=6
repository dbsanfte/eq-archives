Just what I needed,&quot; Honourr said.  He stares at the barmaid, taking notice of her shapely figure and hair as beautiful as a winter's twilight.  Quickly he gathers his composure and gathers his thoughts.<br>
<br>
Honourr struggles to remember the day that his surname was taken away from him.  &quot;It was late at night and the Gnome pirates had taken control of the shuttles to the Firiona Vie outpost in Kunark.  The rain was spitting hard, and I had wished so badly to arrive at my destination.  How I envied the druids and the wizards.&quot; He paused. &quot;I petitioned to he gods... hoping to make safe and rapid passage to the continent of Kunark.  BAM!  I had been struck by the gods, not in a painful way, but he was hit by an invisible force that took me over Timorous Deep to the waters at the dock of Firiona Vie.  I landed in the water with a landing that would make a bellyflopping ogre cringe.&quot; Honourr took a deep breath. &quot;The gods then spoke to me and said,  'Though you are of noble birth to a noble Felwith family, we have a greater purpose in mind for you.  The family name you had is no longer available for you to possess.  You must create a name for yourself and for your future family to be.  To do this you must complete several dangerous tasks in the name of the gods and the Mother, Tunare.'&quot;<br>
<br>
Honourr said, &quot;I was taken aback by this.  My family name... gone.  I was so angered by the gods this day.  I have always been known as the third... the forsaken child.  But now it seems that this fate the gods have bestowed upon me is even worse.  To be nameless and not to have a family to call my own. And the tasks that they have assigned to me... they are so dangerous!&quot;<br>

I understand that your roots and history were erased with your name, but maybe it is a blessing.  You have been chosen to surpass what was initially intended for you.  You have been given the opportunity to alter you fate.  I have never known anyone who had been granted this.  Perhaps you should focus on what you can become and not what was taken away.  I wish I had could be given the opportunity to alter my life in such a way.&quot;<br>
<br>
Desyre sweeps the tendrils that fell upon her face to her shoulders.  Her green eyes widen and she asks, &quot;What will you have me do?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/uhonourr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Honourr</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Officer of the Court<BR>Lord of Faith</span><br>  Posts: 97<br> <font color=#DAA520>(6/25/02 12:47:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/ffirioniaviecourtofthecrosswindsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.yourbetterhealthguide.com/images/eq/honourr.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Need some distraction...</span><hr size=1> THUMP!<br>
<br>
As Honourr regains his composure after falling on the ground, he picks up his stool and positions it close to the bar.  Standing there he takes another sip of brandy, then swallows it all with one thrust of his arm.<br>
<br>
Carefully he takes his place back on the stool, and positions himself to give Desyre a response.  Honourr is careful not to look in Desyre's beautiful green eyes, for his racing heart would not be able to withstand the impact of falling on the floor again.  He adjusts the leather straps of his armour, in an attempt to delay his response.  The sweet smell of Desyre's hair and the aroma of alcohol was titillating to the senses.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mmmmm,&quot; Honourr said, &quot;there is one task that I do require help with.  In Soulsek Eye, there is a goblin named Lord Gimblox.  I must acquire his Signet Ring, but I fear that if I kill him, I will destroy him outright and the ring would be disntigrated.  He is a trivial foe, but the Signet Ring is important for my lifequest.  Perhaps you could assist me with this?&quot; <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=130622"><img src="http://www.yourbetterhealthguide.com/images/eq/sig.jpg"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/uvsangel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VSangel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member of the Court</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#DAA520>(6/26/02 8:38:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/ffirioniaviecourtofthecrosswindsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Need some distraction...</span><hr size=1> Trying to figure out what just happened with Honourr, she replies,  &quot;I would love to assist you in the acquisiton of the ring.  Just tell me when you want to accomplish this, and I shall be there.&quot;<br>
<br>
Desyre studies Honourr's strong, distinguished features and wonders if the alcohol played the main role in his fall.  He appears to be uneasy and she picks up the feeling that he is restraining himself in some way.  She leans towards him and softly whispers, &quot;Are you feeling alright?  Is there something else that burdens you, dear?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/bfirioniaviecourtofthecrosswinds.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=aeron>Aeron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Officer of the Court<BR>Lord of Battle</span><br>  Posts: 277<br> <font color=#DAA520>(6/27/02 10:10:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/ffirioniaviecourtofthecrosswindsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Need some distraction...</span><hr size=1> Aeron sat at the bar, a glass of wine in his hand. His mind for a moment forgetting the worries and concerns of everyday life. Glancing towards Desyre and Honourr, Aeron witness his friend fall from his seat.<br>
<br>
A smile upon his lips, Aeron wondered to himself what is going on over there? It's not like Honourr to over indulge, is it? &quot;Blast I wish I could remember. Oh well, he probably had a revelation of sorts.&quot; With that Aeron returned to his glass of wine.<br>
