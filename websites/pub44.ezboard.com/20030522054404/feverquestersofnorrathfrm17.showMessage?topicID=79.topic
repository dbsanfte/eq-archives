A falcon swooped low to the ground only 30 yards away and rose back up, something small and white wriggling in its talons.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Well at least HE got his breakfast this morning.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kaii thought. His stomach rumbled loudly, reminding him that he had forgotten to buy provisions during his last trip to Freeport. His eyes continued to trace the flight of the falcon, until something else interrupted the view. A thick column of murky black smoke was rising into the eastern sky. There was too much for it to be a simple wood stove or a garbage burning fire. And Kaii knew there was a small village in that direction. Something was wrong.<br>
<br>
The young half-elven warrior hastily gathered his things and cleared his campsite. Then he took off to east, loping along in an easy, ground-devouring run. The village was not far away. He would be there in mere minutes…<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center> **********</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
Kaii walked quietly into the charred ruins of the village. Corpses lie strewn about like children’s playthings and the acrid stench of burnt flesh was heavy on the air.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Orcs.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kaii thought grimly. He was about to begin the grisly task of searching for survivors when a cry of terror spun him around. There, at the end of the pitted and blackened street, a large Deathfist Orc was menacing a small, begrimed girl. She couldn’t have been more than ten summers old. Seeing the sheer panic in the little girl’s eye brought a tremendous rage boiling up from within him. <br>
<br>
Kaii roared out. A wordless howl of pure anger and rage. He gripped his battle staff loosely and sprinted forward as the Orc reacted to his cry. The surprised beast had a split second to register the blue armored figure racing towards him before the iron-shod business end of Kaii’s staff connected with his skull. The Orc was thrown backwards into a pile of rubble, where he lay, twitching feebly.<br>
<br>
Kaii dropped to his knees before the little girl, and put on his best mischievous smile. “I don’t think HE’S going to bother you anymore, eh kitten?” His voice was full of all the confidence and reassurance Kaii could muster.<br>
<br>
“I-I-I-I hope n-n-not.” She answered querulously. <br>
<br>
“As long as I’m here, no one is going to harm you.” Kaii’s voice was filled with such determination and sincerity that the girl, eyes brimming with tears, rushed forward and began to sob quietly again Kaii’s shoulder.<br>
<br>
“Oh this is such a tender moment. I think I’m going to vomit.” The new voice was smooth, cultured, and utterly cold. Kaii looked up quickly to see an armored Dark Elf step from behind a ruined wall. He held a gleaming longsword lightly in his hands, and moved with the easy, sinuous grace of a trained swordsman. Without taking his eyes off this new adversary, Kaii whispered to the girl.<br>
<br>
“Find cover kitten, this could get rough.” Kaii rose to his feet, stretching himself to his full height. He looked down at the Dark Elf. “So it was you,” he spat. “You who led the Orcs in a slaughter of innocents. You will not live to see the next nightfall, Blighted One.”<br>
<br>
“Oh really?” The Dark Elf laughed. “And I suppose you’re going to what, ‘exact the vengeance of the Light’? That sort of thing only happens in bards tales, whelp.” His face creased in a vicious smirk. “That young one will provide Innoruuk great pleasure when she screams.”<br>
<br>
The rage that had welled up inside Kaii’s heart as the Dark Elf spoke instantly solidified into a cold, dark mass. Hatred. This abomination had caused the deaths of countless innocents, including children like the one Kaii had rescued. No more.<br>
<br>
Kaii <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> moved</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
His staff whirled in an incandescent pattern, his attacks weaving a vicious net of strikes. The staff dipped and rose, thrust and blocked, over and over again as Kaii grimly fought to pierce the Dark Elf’s defenses. But to no avail. The blade of the Dark Elf, who smiled sardonically while Kaii exerted himself, met each strike. As the young half elf grew weary, the Dark Elf took a moment to speak.<br>
<br>
“You realize you don’t stand a chance?” He chuckled. “I’m the best swordsman the Teir’Dal have seen in ages. This was a bit sporting though. A shame it needs to end now. Take my name to your afterworld, half elf.” He spat. “I am Kazyn. The Bladewraith.” And with that he whipped his blade in a flat half circle of molten steel, completely shearing through Kaii’s staff, leaving him weaponless. Kazyn sheathed his sword in a smooth movement, and advanced on the disarmed half elf, who stood flat-footed, with an expression of surprise all over his face. The Dark Elf tugged his steel gauntlets tighter, and threw a powerful punch at the Kaii’s bewildered face.<br>
<br>
Or tried to.<br>
<br>
Kaii ducked under the punch, grabbed Kazyn’s forearm, and smashed the heel of his own hand into his attacker's elbow. The crunching snap of shattering bones echoed through the still air, as did Kazyn’s shout of surprise and pain. Kaii spun and crouched, pulling Kazyn’s arm along with him. The dark elf flew through the air and landed hard against a barn wall. Kaii warily watched the still form of his enemy as he knelt to retrieve his broken staff.<br>
<br>
“Kitten?” He called. “Are you still out there?”<br>
<br>
“Y-y-yes! I’m here.” Her timid voice replied as she emerged from behind a crumpled shed. Kaii turned his head for an instant to make sure she was ok. She looked to be in fine condition, considering what she had been through. When he turned back to check on his enemy, he wasn’t very surprised when he saw that the Dark Elf was gone.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Ran home to lick his wounds like the dog he is, I’m sure.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kaii thought. Then his thoughts returned to the poor child. He somehow knew that no one else in this village had escaped Kazyn’s predations. He had to take care of her, any way he could.<br>
<br>
“Come on kitten. Lets go get you cleaned up and warm.” He said, holding his hand out to her.<br>
<br>
“But, my Mummy and Da….” As she looked around, the pain and sadness in her face grew, and Kaii knew she finally realized what had happened. She stepped forward and took his hand. “My name is Celia.”<br>
<br>
“Most honored to meet you, milady Celia,” he replied, bowing gallantly over her tiny hand. “I’m Kaii. Let’s get out of here.”<br>
<br>
They walked sadly out of the ruined village, heading for Freeport. Kaii kept vigilant watch for Kazyn Bladewraith, but there were no further encounters. Soon, they found themselves in the city of Freeport. Safe, for now.<br>
<br>
To be continued…<br>
