We made our plans the night before and made arrangements for all important things needed and slept on it, to wake up in the morning in anticipation of some fun. It began....in a swamp..<br>
<br>
Porting us to South Ro Desert, we proceeded to run southwest towards Innothule Swamp. The run was fast and quick and we soon arrived at the entrance to the dungeon of Guk. Having been a semi-frequent visitor to this place, I ented with confidence. My wife, having never been here, proved to be indifferent to the inhabitants. Taking precautions against a random attack, I invis'ed myself and she and I proceeded in. <br>
<br>
Passing through the first part without incident, we came upon a pool of water. It's stagnant smell and fetid looking slime covered surface almost made me gag. I had forgotten why I never came here til now. Sucking up my distaste, I dived in, urging my wife to follow. Galadria was hesitant but quickly followed as the surroundings were a bit...unnerving. As she surfaced with gunk dripping from her hair and an astonished look on her face (i think something moved?), I couldn't help but think .. she looked very beautiful indeed. Smiling innocently at her, I beckoned her forward and waded on. Rounding corner after corner, we could hear the grumblings of crocs ahead and our excitement grew. This was one of our first journeys together after our marriage and we were both thrilled. A ledge came into view and we both greatfully climbed out of the water, shedding what gunk decided to cling to us. <br>
<br>
Making our way through the maze of tunnels and passages, we came to our first destination : The Stage. Here, a Froglok Scryer was said to roam. On this walking frog was also said to be a Woven Bracelet, something I know a friend needed. We quickly surveyed the surrounding and decided to clear the room. Making sure we were ready, though the whole room 'con-ed' green, I buffed Galadria and let her do what she does best : mayhem. She waded into each one and dispatched it with ease and speed. Her dancing blades and flowing body were exotic and seductive to watch..and frightening in it's beauty.<br>
<br>
Thrusting with her claws, then ripping upward, she took the first Froglok unawares. The Froglok behind the first one turned and began to heal the first, but Galadria's blades were so fast that it died before the heals had the desired affect. Galadria quickly moved to the next, again taking it out with ease. She was soon done on The Stage and moved to the ones around the room. In only moments, she had cleared it and was moving to the adjoining hallway. Mesmerized by her ease in movement and the way she moved, I could do nothing but watch as her body flexed and snapped and bent and coiled, her blades weaving, the light from the torches sparkling off them and the blood that seemed to constantly coat them.<br>
<br>
When she finished, we both came back to rest up a tad on The Stage. Killing 'greens' was still work, after all. Getting notified that the 'spawn' rate of the Scryer was up and around 16min! I decided to see what was out there that my love could gain some 'experience' from. Having a description of those that would do this for her, I set off, only to notice that my Spirit of the Wolf had worn off. Sighing in resignation, I continued. Going down ramps and through more tunnels, I came upon, quiet suddenly, the one she described and to my amazement, IT attacked me! I was so surprised that I didn't even blink when it did 44 pts dmg through my skin buff and thorns. I didn't even complain, having gotten used to it by then. Turning I began my return, hearing Galadria's voice in my head, asking how I was. I told her I had incoming and to prepare. Taking hit after hit, some minor, some lucky enough to find my softer side, I turned my last corner and came face to face with Galadria. Running passed her, I turned and activated my gauntlets. The power flowed almost immediantly through my hands as they began to glow a deep green. Roots shot up through the floor and entwinned around the Froglok Ton Warrior's legs, for that is what it was, a warrior. Raising it's weapon, it proceeded after me yet still, though much slower. Galadria, my dear love, stepped in front without fear and took the attack on her own blades....and thus ensued her dance once again....<br>
<br>
Deflecting the first attack off her claws, she brought her sword's pommel straight forward, bashing the Froglok in the face. I could hear the resounding crunch as bones were crushed. The warrior staggered back, giving Galadria much needed time to set her stance. Holding her claws vertically in front of her, her sword horizontal above her head, she slide her right foot back, her wieght resting on both evenly. Her face calm, her body relaxed, she waited. The Froglok Ton Warrior shook it's head vigorously and croaked loudly, looked around with it's large eyes and began to slowly walk forward again, this time with a bit more caution. Galadria didn't wait this time but jabbed foward with her sword, causing the frog to deflect with its club. Her claws, a blur of motion, sliced through the frogs arm. The frog, moving faster than either of us thought possible, managed to fall back a bit, causing Galadria to lose some of her balance. Bringing it's club around, it caught her a glancing blow to her left shoulder. Glaring, I could only watch for risk of stealing her kill.<br>
<br>
Regaining her balance instantly, despite the blow she took, she backhanded the frog with her claws, her sword following close behind. Catching the club with her claws, she  threw it aside and her sword slide across the frog's midriff. The frog then did some kind of hop/flip combo thing and caught Galadria in her other shoulder. Stunned by the blow, she took another hit to her left lower hip and one to her right knee. Praying to Tunare, I cast a Greater Healing on her, watching as the bruises and lacerations healed and closed. As if she never even noticed the hits taken, she continued her attack, this time spinning around to her right, her sword sweeping low. When blocked, she spun to her left, her claws catching the frog just below it's thigh. Cutting to the bone, she nearly severed the entire leg. Letting lose a stangled croak, the frog tried to hope back but failed and fell, my wife's blade taking it in the throat, finishing it before it hit the ground.<br>
<br>
Smiling at me as she turned, I looked her over to make sure no other serious wounds were apparent. Finding none, I hugged her and congratulated her on a job well done. Again, we sat and waited for the Scryer to show it self. We cleared the room again as the Frogloks appeared three more times. Time slipped by us so fast and I noticed that not much was left. I suggested exploring the rest of the dungeon and smiling, Galadria agreed...<br>
<br>
Following what I knew of this area already, we soon arrived at the beginning of the untraveled section. Leading the way slowly, we meandered through what seemed like miles of dirt and dank walls to come upon a cavern with a small island in the center. On this island were three more Frogloks, all Ton's...2 knights and 1 warrior. In my brashness, I explored a bit while she meditated and came upon a Shin shaman. It agro'ed on my right away and I returned to Galadria, blushing as I informed her Incoming w/ possible adds. Her calm look was refreshing as she drew her blade and claws and readied herself in a second. And not a second too late, for the Shin had dragged with it the two Ton's Knights. Beset by three Frogloks, my wife informed me they were 'blue cons'. So I stayed back, my only job to heal and in emergency, nuke. <br>
<br>
My first heal instantly agro'ed 2 of them, both knights. Galadria turned quickly and started attacking one from behind, taunting it til it turned from me and attacked her. Her damage shield still active, she ignored the Shin all together and concentrated on the other Knight, drawing its attention as well. Stepping back, I watched her 'health' and was impressed as each Froglok dropped and her 'life' was barely dented. <br>
<br>
Finishing up and resting for a bit, we crossed to the island and then to the far side. Again traveling through a few tunnels, we came to yet again another cavern, this one with a much lower ceiling. I turned t he last corner and came upon 4 more Frogloks, 2 Ton warriors, a shin warrior and another shaman. I quickly backed up and luckily, they didn't see me. Motioning Galadria back, I told her what was ahead. Agreeing to take them all on, we meditated a bit and when ready, I recast upon her a regeneration and damage shield. Nodding to me that she was ready, we rounded the corner together, her in the lead, my healing prayer on the tip of my lips and she waded into them. The first one took so many hits from her whirling blades that it went down within moments. The others took a bit longer. I cast my prayer upon her a few times and again agro'ed 1 of them. Not daring to cast on the Froglok for fear of taking the kill, I took hit after hit after hit. Then, one of those that Galadria was fighting fleed, both of us having forgotten to snare it. I was beset and couldn't get a snare off while she was still busy with another. Forgotten for the moment, Galadria decided to finish off the one she had and began to taunt and slash at the one on me. Soon, it too joined the fallen. Casting yet another heal upon my love, I took notice of movement out of the corner of my eye and turned to see 3 more Frogloks arrive. Yelling to Galadria, I backed up, watching as all three beset her again. Recasting my 'DS' to make sure it was up and fresh, I sat down quickly to try and regain some strength.<br>
<br>
She is a marvel. Her blades were like extentions of her arms ,moving with a fluid and effortless movement, taking out the one that had gone for help first. Turning, she began her dance anew with the other 2 Frogloks, taking them out with but a little effort. I, on the other hand, ended that battle with but 2/5's of my life left and only a smidgen of mana left. Chuckling to myself as I sat heavily down to regenerate, I groaned as my blood soon mixed with the gunk on the floor. My wife, in her infinite kindness and love, cast what healing she could on me and I was able to soon cast my prayer's upon myself. Thanking my wife with a hug, I began to meditate.<br>
<br>
Upon full health/full mana, I ventured ahead a little and soon found another set of Frogloks not far from where we were, I told Galadria. With her report of at least 80% mana and fully healed, I motioned her to begin. Quickly recasting what meager buffs I had on her, I nodded and watched again as she took on all of them, 3 this time. Her courage was something bards should have sang as she fearlessly took upon her person all the damage they dished out. Her faith in me was no less admirable. I would not let her down.<br>
<br>
Casting my heals, which always agro, I took another 2 on me. Not fearing for myself, I quickly continued to cast. Watching her life, I cast when needed and watched her bring down all of em. Amazed at her skill and speed, I could do naught but smile at her and ask of her needs. Assuring me that she was alright, we finished our little exploration and ported out, arriving in West Commons.....<br>
