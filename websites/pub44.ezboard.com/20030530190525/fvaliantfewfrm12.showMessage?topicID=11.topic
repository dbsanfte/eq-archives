<br>
There are 5 Basic Steps and 9 Major Steps<br>
<br>
BASIC STEPS:<br>
You must complete all these steps before you will be in consideration for items the guild earns for the MAJOR STEPS (unless no one has completed these steps).<br>
<br>
1)  Begin the Quest<br>
<br>
This actually starts in East Karanas.  There is an NPC male at the base of the ramp.  Speak to him, and he will tell you the tale of The Jagged War Blade.  He will also tell you that Kargek Reblade in East Freeport has the Scabbard.<br>
<br>
2) The Red Scabbard<br>
<br>
Talk to Kargak Redblade in east freeport (near the gypsy rogue camps)- he tells you to talk to Wenden, a dwarf beside him.<br>
<br>
Next to Wenden and say [I will do you a favor]. You get a letter ( wax sealed note). Take this letter to an Ogre in Ferrott named Oknoggin. He hangs out between the Stone bridge and the Fallen totem. Hand him the letter and he gives you a Tiny Lute. <br>
<br>
Run back to East Freeport And give the Tiny Lute to Kargek Redblade he gives you a book. Now take the book over to his brother in East Karana - Tenal Redblade, who is at the very end of the canyon next to the ramp to Highpass. Hand him the book,and he gives you a Frozen War Totem. <br>
<br>
Go to Permafrost and kill Ice Goblin Wizards until a Frozen Goblin Heart drops (no drop item). <br>
<br>
Run back to East Karana and hand Tenal Redblade the Frozen War Totem and the Frozen Goblin Heart that you got from perma.  He becomes possessed by Rallos Zek and tells you te get him a Green Dragon Scale and a Red Dragon Scale.  He also gives you back the Totem of Fiery war.   <br>
<br>
(see Major Steps for the next steps in the Red Scabbard Quest).<br>
<br>
3)Hilt # 1 - Jeweled Dragon Head Hilt <br>
<br>
Go back to Wenden in East Freeport and talk to him about the sword.  He says he can repair almost any weapon.  He will explain that you need two dragon hilts and some equipment to repair them.<br>
<br>
Head to Lake Rathe to get the unjeweled dragon head hilt. You can find it spawning on the lake floor underneath the 3 aviak spawn tower. <br>
<br>
(See Major Steps for details on the rest of the Jeweled Dragon Head Hilt Quest)<br>
<br>
4)Hilt #2 - Finely Crafted Dragon Head Hilt <br>
<br>
Go back to Wenden in East Freeport and talk to him about the sword.  He says he can repair almost any weapon.  He will explain that you need two dragon hilts and some equipment to repair them.<br>
<br>
Head to Timorous Deep. It is best to have a druid cast levitate and sow on you to do this. Run down to the southwest corner of the zone, where you'll find the chessboard (loc approx n6k p4k). At the base of the king peice, there is a small bag dropped on the ground - pick it up and you get the Damaged Dragon Head Hilt. <br>
<br>
Now go to the Dreadlands, to the Giant castle just west of Karnor castle zone. Kill every giant you see, in hopes of getting the Mountin Giant Patriarch to spawn. One of his rarer drops is the Giant Monocle (this is not no drop, so you can also trade for it). He usually spawns at the small Giant Outpost. Take the Monocle to Frontier Mountians. Get to the giant fort and get inside. When you get to the very end of the Mine you will see the giant named Mentrax Mountainbone. Hand him the Monocle he will give you Rejesium Ore. <br>
<br>
(See Major Steps for the next part of the Finely Crafted Dragon Head Hilt Quest)<br>
<br>
5)Sword Blade # 1 - Ancient Sword Blade <br>
<br>
Talk to Denken Strongpick, on aviak island in Lake Rathe. He'll tell you what he wants for this rusty old blade he found on the ocean floor: <br>
<br>
a: A keg of vox tail ale - bought from alot of vendors around the world. (100-150pp). A good place to buy one is the sandfishers in north ro or the freeport port authority <br>
<br>
b: A Block Of Perma frost - Dropped by Ice giants. While you're here, kill some goblin wizards and pick up the frozen goblin heart ... you'll need it for the Scabbard. <br>
<br>
c: Rebreathers - Tinkered by gnomes. Expect to pay as much as 4k for getting two rebreathers. <br>
<br>
Turn the 2 rebreathers, the keg of vox tail ale, and the block of permafrost in to the dwarf and you will get the 1st blade.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
MAJOR STEPS:<br>
The steps here in are major and require the guilds assistance, dragon raids, and planar raids.  These items, when the guild earns them, are randomed between those who have completed all the BASIC STEPS.  However, if a member has only ONE item left to get then that item will be Meritted to that person.  If no one has completed the BASIC STEPS, then all items are randomed amongst those who have made significant attempts to complete these steps.<br>
<br>
1-3)Gem Stones for Unjeweled Dragon Hilt<br>
     <br>
These are found in planes and high level dungeons, such as Sebilis, or the  Dino in OOT.  They are not No-Drop so you can buy them or trade for them:<br>
  1: Jacinth<br>
  2: Black Sapphire<br>
  3: Diamond<br>
<br>
Take the Unjeweled dragon head hilt Diamond, Jacinth, and black Saphire to the dwarf Wenden. Hand him all 4 items you will recieve the Jeweled Dragon Head Hilt. <br>
<br>
4)Ball of Everliving Golem for Damaged Dragon Head Hilt<br>
<br>
Head to the Plane of Fear and kill the named golems Fright, Dread, and Terror to get:<br>
   4:a Ball of Everliving Golem.<br>
It may also drop off of cazic and the dracoliche.<br>
<br>
Now run back to Freeport east with the Rejisium Ore and the Ball of Everliving Golem. Hand the ore, ball and Damaged Dragon Head Hilt to Wenden and he will give you the Finely Crafted Dragon Head Hilt.  <br>
<br>
5)Sword Blade # 2 - Ancient Blade <br>
<br>
This is dropped by the Queen of Chardok. Bring along a large group. You will probably have to kill here several times before she coughs this up. <br>
<br>
6-9) Finish The Red Scabbard Quest<br>
<br>
  6: Green Dragon Scale<br>
This is dropped by Severlious in the Emerald Jungle.  Supposedly there is an NPC in the Hole that drops this scale too, but its never been verified.<br>
<br>
  7: Red Dragon Scale <br>
This is dropped by Nagafen in Solusek B, or by Talendor in Skyfre.  It is known that the NPC in the Hole does drop the Red Dragon scale as well.  <br>
<br>
These scales are not no drop, but good luck finding someone willing to sell one.<br>
<br>
You then need to return the totem to Tenal Redblade, along with a Green Dragon Scale and a Red Dragon scale and he gives you The Mark of the Sword. <br>
<br>
  8: Hand of Maestro <br>
Now head to the Plane of Hate and kill the Maestro. You need to get his hand, which is a rare drop. Bring that back and give it to Tenal aong with the Mark of the Sword and he gives you a note to Kargek and yet another, final quest. <br>
<br>
  9: a Spiroc Wingblade <br>
You need a Spiroc Wingblade from the Spiroc Lord in the Plane of Sky. You then take the Winglbade and the note to Kargek where he gives you the Red Scabbard and instructions to combine the Ancient Blade, Ancient Sword Blade, Finely Crafted Dragon Head Hilt, and Jeweled Dragon Head Hilt to receive your reward. <br>
<br>
<br>
FINALE:<br>
<br>
Combine the two blades and two hilts in the Red Scabbard as per the instructions from Kargek.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Two Handed Sword splits into the two One Handed Swords, which can then be recombined into the 2HS. <br>
