I have woed many a maiden to her cause with pride. But of late, I've had this need to go out from my home, from the safety of Kelethin, and to explore those pits of evil that threaten her expanding beauty. Thus, I ventured to the cesspool of human DE'evolution and corruption, the great city of ... Freeport.<br>
<br>
Upon arriving in this city, the first thing that hit me was the smell. I have just come from a woodlands area and a city based in the trees. The concentration of so many bodies in one enclosed place almost made me turn back and jump into the ocean, for the boat, the captain smarter than I, had sailed off already for the cleaner air of the Ocean of Tears and ButcherBlock. With a resigned sigh, I turned back to the city and entered it.<br>
<br>
Knowing from my readings of Ordained's journals, I knew that the fastest way out of Freeport and over to the great desert of Ro, was through the Eastern Gate. I headed there without delay. Upon arriving, I inquired to the few decrepid denizens there if one could 'bind' me here, so I may venture out in Tunare's name. The looks were disdainful but someone there agreed to 'bind' me, for a donation. Again sighing, I dug into my pocket and forked out 5 platinum pieces! Must have been because he was human, they are always so greedy. Well, he 'bound' me there and quickly trotted off south, towards North Ro.<br>
<br>
I don't remember much about the desert except...lots of sand. I remember while I was running through the desert thinking...'I'm never gonna get all this sand out of my armor'. I also remember seeing these...ragged looking men wandering around and I kept thinking 'why don't they go to Freeport? Or maybe they LEFT Freeport. Ah, possibly a smart human?' I quickly discarded that idea. Soon enough, though, I came within sight of my goal : Oasis of Marr.<br>
<br>
Upon entering this 'Oasis', I soon came upon a dark, yet fair skinned elven lass, who I noticed was in the same guild as I. Pleased with this, I offered to join up with her so that we could possibly gain my 'turnings' this way. That's when I found out she was also a Warrior. Again pleased, for she was drop dead gorgeous, I pointed out that we should stay near the docks, for many rest there and if in need, we could ask for aid. Sticking up her nose, she told me that she has solo'ed plenty in Oasis and is comfortable being further away from the docks. Trusting her judgement, I smiled and followed, wondering as I watched her, could I convert her? That would please Tunare to no end, to say the least about me. *sly grin*<br>
<br>
She is like....the wind. Her blade and axe twirled so fast, I had a hard time keeping up with her. We ventured up and down the beach, killing what we could and binding each others wounds. She was a mystery to me, her dark skin hiding from me what was inside. Her eyes, always so piercing, were constantly moving, searching for anything that her blades could rend to pieces. I often caught myself staring at her for long periods of time...<br>
<br>
Though we took our chances with just the two of us Warriors, we conquered many a foe (are croc's evil?) and died many times. Trusting in Tunare, I thrust myself into battle, trying to impress upon this dark beauty the power of Tunare. I lost count of my deaths after 6, though I always came back laughing. My only regret was that she, too, died a number of times, though not as many as I. Knowing she didn't worship a God/Goddess, I always wondered how she could come back as I did? Another mystery..<br>
<br>
Her beauty and mystery have captured my heart and mind and I am in constant turmoil. I know that my people, the wood elves, do not approve of the dark skinned brethren that lived here on Antonica but this girl, this little slip of a girl, with her twirling blades and dazzling smile, for she smiled often and it always brightened the day more, has captured me as surely as any trap could. My dilemma is one of great....discomfort. Will I be alienated from my people if I persue this beauty......?<br>
<br>
As the hours passed us by and the lateness of the hour creped up on us, she soon told me she would need to leave. With regret, I agreed, that I should be going as well. As she turned to walk away, finding a safe spot to camp, I watched the way her body moved, her hips swaying seductively and her hair flowing in the light breeze coming off the ocean. Her steps were light, almost barely touching the ground, her movements cat like in there precision and grace. I marvelled at her anew as she left me that day. Would I see her again? I hoped, and preyed to Tunare, that I would .....<br>

Oh, Kendryk! Be careful! I understand this &quot;fair&quot; dark elf beauty is claimed by one Ayzreall, a necromancer...

I confess myself shocked that you - such a prime physical specimen of a ... um, warrior ... should worship such a soft god! Or to imagine that such a deity would ever have appeal for me!<br>
<br>
With those strong arms of yours, those shining swift blades, those stinging claws, that broad athletic torso ... that fiery red hair, those gleaming white teeth behind smiling lips ... er um in the heat of battle of course, as you batter down all foes ...<br>
<br>
Did you really like the way I swung my own blades? I try to keep my weapons clean and sharp, my body lithe and fluid, my ... uh ... It is very odd how my mind keeps becoming distracted. I am a dark elf, and a warrior, and I live only for battle and Ayzreall.<br>
