The 'void' trail it leaves soon begins to blend in with the other trails and soon a dance of steel is in progress. Cutting left, stopping suddenly, shifting right then dropping down, the warrior, using both hands, brings the sword sharply up. Stepping to the side, as if to avoid a downward stroke, he brings his sword across about where an opponents neck would be. Bringing the sword to another sudden stop, the warrior takes one step back and saluts his unseen adversary. Wiping the sweat from his brow, he walks to the side wall and reverantly sheaths his blade. Picking up his duel wielded claws and afixing them to his gauntlets and sleeves, he swings them through the air to make sure they are attached properly, then walks back out to the center of the room.<br>
<br>
Coming to stand in the exact center, he stands ram-rod still and straight. Saluting again his imaginary adversary, he then drops into a crouch, his claws moving in and out of their respective patterns of defense..figure eights now. Snapping his body taunt, he leaps forward, his claws slashing the air in an 'X' pattern, then bringing his arms out wide, tucking his head to roll 'under' the swing of his opponent. Coming quickly to his feet, he slashes back behind, driving his opponent into a blocking manuever or cutting his back. Turning, his left claw held up to deflect a backstroke, his right thrusting forward, retracting, then slicing upwards. Pushing his left arm out, throwing the unseen blade aside, he brings the left claws diagonally across the body of his adersary, perpendicular to his upward thrust a second ago. Stepping back, he again saluts and bows. Walking back to the side wall where his weapons lean, he removes his claws and again wipes the sweat from his brow. Smiling, he takes up his quarter staff, made of pure Velium, and walks back to the center of the room...<br>
<br>
Holding the staff before him in one hand, he shifts his grip and the staff begins to move, the top dipping back and to the left. Soon, the staff is twirling around and around, his other hand catching it as it spins around the back of one and into the other. The hum of his weapon through the air leaves a swirling white 'void' in the air that resounds with a 'whoosh' as the staff spins faster and faster. With a jerk of his body, he snaps the staff straight out in front of him, his muscles straining to control the deadly staff. Lifting his right leg out behind him in a kick, he brings the staff around, following. With both hands now on the weapon, he brings the staff twirling over his head and down to a stop in front of him again. Quickly jabbing out, he plants the staff's end on the floor and leaps out, his right foot kicking. Landing on his left foot, he brings his staff around again and with presition, jabs here, there, here again. In only a few seconds, he's jabbed eight times in the general area of someone's face. Snapping the staff back with both hands into a defensive stance, he again begins to twirl it. Spinning around and around, he suddenly brings it up over his head and down with a loud *SMACK*, hitting the floor with it. &quot;HIA!&quot; he yells as the Velium hits wood. Quickly standing, he again saluts, walks back to the wall. Leaning his staff against the wall once more, he picks up Crystallized sword and Gnoll hide Lariet and walks back out to the center of the room, his smile ever broadening as his soul melds with his weapons, his void within filled....<br>
