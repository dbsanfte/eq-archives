She was rushed to the hospital, and her husband was called. After hours of waiting, a doctor finally came out and talked to the husband.<br>
<br>
"Im so sorry, your wife is now quadrapaligic and has lost most of her higher brain functions. For the rest of her life you are going to have to feed her, bathe her and take care of her as if she were a child."<br>
<br>
The husband, looking very upset, said "Oh, no, this is terrible!"<br>
<br>
The doctor chuckled and said "Nah, Im just kiddin, she's dead."<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
A woman accompanied her husband to the doctor's office. After his<br>
checkup, the doctor called the wife into his office alone. He said, "Your husband is suffering from a very severe disease, combined with horrible stress. If you don't do the following, your husband will surely DIE!!!<br>
<br>
"Each morning fix him a healthy breakfast. Be pleasant and make sure<br>
he's in a good mood. For lunch make him a nutritious meal he can take to work.<br>
And for dinner prepare an especially nice meal for him. Don't burden him<br>
with chores, as this could further his stress. Don't discuss your problems<br>
with him it will only make him stress worse. Try to relax your husband in the<br>
evening by wearing lingerie and giving him plenty of back rubs. Encourage<br>
him to watch some type of sporting event on T.V. And most importantly<br>
makelove with your husband several times a week and satisfy his every whim. "If<br>
you can do this for 10 months to a year, I think your husband will regain<br>
his health completely."<br>
<br>
On the way home the husband asked his wife,<br>
"What did the doctor say?" She replied,"You're gonna die" <br>
<br>
<br>
A man in his 40s bought a new BMW and was out<br>
driving on the interstate at top speed when he suddenly saw flashing red and blue lights behind him. <br>
<br>
"There's no way they can catch a BMW," he thought to himself and sped up even more. Then the reality of the situation hit him, "What the heck am I doing?" he thought and pulled over. <br>
<br>
The cop came up to him, took his license without a word, and examined it and the car. "It's been a long day, it is the<br>
end of my shift, and it's Friday the 13th. I don't feel like more<br>
paperwork, so if you can give me an excuse for your driving that I haven't heard before, you can go." <br>
<br>
The guy thinks for a second and says, "Last week my wife ran off with a cop. I was afraid you were trying to give her<br>
back." <br>
<br>
"Have a nice weekend," said the officer. <br>
<br>

<br>
DEMOCRAT: You have two cows. Your neighbor has none. You feel guilty for<br>
being successful. You vote people into office that put a tax on your<br>
cows, forcing you to sell one to raise money to pay the tax. The people<br>
you voted for then take the tax money, buy a cow and give it to your<br>
neighbor. You feel righteous. Barbara Streisand sings for you.<br>
<br>
SOCIALIST: You have two cows. The government takes one and gives it to<br>
your neighbor. You form a cooperative to tell him how to manage his cow.<br>
<br>
REPUBLICAN: You have two cows. Your neighbor has none. So?<br>
<br>
COMMUNIST: You have two cows. The government seizes both and provides you<br>
with milk. You wait in line for hours to get it. It is expensive and soured.<br>
<br>
CAPITALISM, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows. You sell one, buy a bull,<br>
and build a herd of cows.<br>
<br>
DEMOCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows. The government taxes you to<br>
the point you have to sell both to support a man in a foreign country who<br>
has only one cow, which was a gift from your government.<br>
<br>
BUREAUCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows. The government takes them<br>
both, shoots one, milks the other, pays you for the milk, and then pours<br>
the milk down the drain.<br>
<br>
AMERICAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You sell one, lease it back to<br>
yourself and do an IPO on the 2nd one. You force the 2 cows to produce<br>
the milk of four cows. You are surprised when one cow drops dead. You<br>
spin an announcement to the analysts stating you have downsized and are<br>
reducing expenses. Your stock goes up.<br>
<br>
FRENCH CORPORATION: You have two cows. You go on strike because you want<br>
three cows. You go to lunch. Life is good.<br>
<br>
JAPANESE CORPORATION: You have two cows. You redesign them so they are<br>
one-tenth the size of an ordinary cow and produce twenty times the milk.<br>
They learn to travel on unbelievably crowded trains. Most are at the top<br>
of their class at cow school.<br>
<br>
GERMAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You re-engineer them so they are<br>
all blonde, drink lots of beer, give excellent quality milk, and run a<br>
hundred miles an hour. Unfortunately they also demand 13 weeks of<br>
vacation per year.<br>
<br>
ITALIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows but you don't know where they are.<br>
While wandering around, you see a beautiful woman. You break for lunch.<br>
Life is good.<br>
<br>
RUSSIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You count them and learn you have<br>
five cows. You have some more vodka. You count them again and learn you<br>
have 42 cows. You count them again and learn you have 12 cows. You stop<br>
counting cows and open another bottle of vodka. You produce your 10th, 5-<br>
year plan in the last 3 months. The Mafia shows up and takes over however<br>
many cows you really have.<br>
<br>
POLISH CORPORATION: You have two bulls. Employees are regularly maimed<br>
and killed attempting to milk them.<br>
<br>
FLORIDA CORPORATION: You have a black cow and a brown cow. Everyone votes<br>
for the best looking one. Some of the people who like the brown one best<br>
vote for the black one and some people vote for both. Some people vote<br>
for neither. Some people can't figure out how to vote at all. Finally, a<br>
bunch of guys from out-of-state tell you which is the best-looking one.<br>
<br>
NEW YORK CORPORATION: You have fifteen million cows. You have to choose<br>
which one will be the leader of the herd, so you pick some fat cow from<br>
Arkansas.<br>

The bus driver said: "That's the ugliest baby I've ever seen."<br>
In a huff, the woman slammed her fare into the fare box and took an aisle seat near the rear of the bus.<br>
The man seated next to her sensed that she was agitated and asked her what was wrong. "The bus driver insulted me" she fumed.<br>
The man sympathized and said: "Why, he's a public servant and shouldn't say things to insult passengers."<br>
"You're right" she said. "I think I'll go back up there and give him a piece of my mind."<br>
"That's a good idea" the man said. "Here, let me hold your monkey."<br>

A man was walking along a California beach when he stumbled across an old lamp. He picked it up and rubbed it and out popped a genie. The genie said: "OK, so you released me from the lamp blah blah blah, but this is the fourth time this week and I'm getting a little sick of these wishes, so you can only have one wish."<br>
The man sat and thought about it for a while and said, "I've always wanted to go to Hawaii but I'm too scared to fly and I get very seasick. So could you build me a bridge to Hawaii so I can drive over there?" The genie laughed and replied, "That's impossible. Think of the logistics of that. How would the supports ever reach the bottom of the Pacific? Think of how much concrete.... how much steel !!!! No, think of another wish."<br>
The man agreed and tried to think of a really good wish. He said, "I've been married and divorced four times. My wives have always said I don't care and that I'm insensitive. I wish that I could understand women: to know what they are thinking when they give me the silent treatment; to know why they are crying; to know what they want when they say 'nothing'...."<br>
The genie replied: "You want that bridge two lanes or four?"<br>

A man takes his wife to the stock show. They start heading down the alley that houses all the bulls.<br>
The sign on the first bull's stall states: "This bull mated 50 times last year."<br>
The wife turns to her husband and says, "He mated 50 times in a year, isn't that nice!."<br>
They proceed to the next bull and his sign stated: "This bull mated 65 times last year."<br>
The wife turns to her husband and says, "This one mated 65 times last year. That is over 5 times a month. You could learn from this one!"<br>
They proceeded to the last bull and his sign said: "This bull mated 365 times last year."<br>
The wife's mouth drops open and says, "WOW! He mated 365 times last year. That is ONCE A DAY!!! You could really learn from this one."<br>
The man, fed up, turns to his wife and says, "Go up and inquire if it was 365 times with the same cow."<br>

A linguistics professor was lecturing to his class one day. "In English," he said, "a double negative forms a positive. In some languages though, such as Russian, a double negative is still a negative."<br>
"However," he pointed out, "there is no language wherein a double positive can form a negative."<br>
A voice from the back of the room piped up, "Yeah. Right."<br>

<br>
There is a beautiful desert island in the middle of nowhere where the following people are stranded:<br>
&#61623; 2 Italian men and 1 Italian woman <br>
&#61623; 2 French men and 1 French woman <br>
&#61623; 2 German men and 1 German woman <br>
&#61623; 2 Greek men and 1 Greek woman <br>
&#61623; 2 English men and 1 English woman <br>
&#61623; 2 Bulgarian men and 1 Bulgarian woman <br>
&#61623; 2 Swedish men and 1 Swedish woman <br>
&#61623; 2 Irish men and 1 Irish woman <br>
One month later on this beautiful desert island in the middle of nowhere....<br>
&#61623; The first Italian man killed the other for the Italian woman. <br>
&#61623; The 2 French men and the French woman are living happily together in a "menage a trois". <br>
&#61623; The 2 German men have a strict weekly schedule of when they alternate with the German woman. <br>
&#61623; The 2 Greek men are sleeping with each other and the Greek woman is cleaning and cooking for them. <br>
&#61623; The 2 English men are waiting for someone to introduce them to the English woman. <br>
&#61623; The Bulgarian men took one look at the endless ocean, one look at the Bulgarian woman and started swimming. <br>
&#61623; The 2 Swedish men are contemplating the virtues of suicide while the woman keeps on bitching about her body being her own and the true nature of feminism. But at least it's not snowing and the taxes are low. <br>
&#61623; The Irish began by dividing their island Northside-Southside and setting up a distillery. They don't remember if sex is in the picture, cause it gets sort of foggy after the first few litres of coconut-whiskey, but at least they know the English aren't getting any. <br>

This is an actual radio conversation released by the Chief of Naval Operations, 10-10-95, MSG#H0000115020ecb52EMHS <br>
<br>
#1: &quot;Please divert your course 15 degrees to the north to avoid a collision.&quot; <br>
<br>
#2: &quot;Recommend that you change YOUR course 15 degrees to the south to avoid a collision.&quot; <br>
<br>
#1: &quot;This is the captain of a U.S. navy ship. I say again, divert YOUR course.&quot; <br>
<br>
#2: &quot;No, I say again divert YOUR course.&quot; <br>
<br>
#1: &quot;This is the aircraft carrier Enterprise, we are a large warship of the U.S. navy. Divert your course NOW!&quot; <br>
<br>
#2: &quot;This is a lighthouse. Your call<br>

Military Wisdom <br>
<br>
1. If the enemy is in range, so are you. <br>
<br>
2. Incoming fire has the right of way. <br>
<br>
3. Don't look conspicuous: it draws fire. <br>
<br>
4. The easy way is always mined. <br>
<br>
5. Try to look unimportant, they may be low on ammo. <br>
<br>
6. Professionals are predictable, it's the amateurs that are <br>
dangerous. <br>
<br>
7. The enemy invariably attacks on one of two occasions: <br>
When you're ready for them. <br>
When you're not ready for them. <br>
<br>
8. Teamwork is essential; it gives the enemy someone else to <br>
shoot at. <br>
<br>
9. If you can't remember, the claymore is pointed at you. <br>
<br>
10. If your attack is going well, you have walked into an <br>
ambush. <br>
<br>
11. Don't draw fire, it irritates the people around you. <br>
<br>
12. The only thing more accurate than incoming enemy fire is <br>
incoming friendly fire. <br>
<br>
13. When the pin is pulled, Mr. Grenade is not our friend. <br>
<br>
14. If it's stupid but works, it isn't stupid. <br>
<br>
15. When in doubt empty the magazine. <br>
<br>
16. Never share a fox hole with anyone braver than you. <br>
<br>
17. Anything you do can get you shot. Including doing <br>
dothing. <br>
<br>
18. Make it too tough for the enemy to get in and you can't <br>
get out. <br>
<br>
19. Mines are equal opportunity weapons. <br>
<br>
20. A Purple Heart just proves that were you smart enough to <br>
think of a plan, stupid enough to try it, and lucky enough <br>
to survive. <br>
<br>
21. Don't ever be the first, don't ever be the last and <br>
don't ever volunteer to do anything. <br>
<br>
22. The quartermaster has only two sizes: too large and too <br>
small. <br>
<br>
23. Five second fuses only last three seconds. <br>
<br>
24. It is generally inadvisable to eject directly over the <br>
area you just bombed. <br>

Three generals, one from the Army, another from the Marines, <br>
and a third from the Air Force, were having a debate with a <br>
Navy Admiral about whose soldiers were the bravest. <br>
<br>
To prove his point, the Air Force general calls over an <br>
airman: &quot;Airman! Climb that flagpole, and once you are at <br>
the top, sing 'Wild Blue Yonder', and then jump off!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;YES SIR!&quot; replies the airman. He takes off for the flagpole <br>
like a shot, scales up it, sings the anthem, salutes and <br>
jumps off, hitting the ground at attention. <br>
<br>
The general dismisses him. &quot;Now that's bravery!&quot; exclaims <br>
the general. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, that's nothing,&quot; says the Admiral, &quot;Seaman!&quot; A seaman <br>
appears, &quot;YES, SIR!!&quot; &quot;Take this weapon,&quot; as he offers him <br>
an M14, &quot;Scale that flagpole, balance yourself on top, stand <br>
at attention, present arms, and sing 'Anchors Aweigh.' <br>
Salute each of us, and jump off. <br>
<br>
&quot;YES SIR!!&quot; replies the seaman. He sprints for the flagpole <br>
with the weapon high over his head, and completes the task <br>
perfectly. <br>
<br>
&quot;Now that's courage!&quot; says the admiral. <br>
<br>
&quot;Courage, nothin'&quot; snorts the Army general. &quot;Get over here, <br>
private!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;YES SIR!!&quot; replies the private. <br>
<br>
&quot;Put on full combat gear, load your rucksack with these <br>
rocks, scale that flagpole, come to attention, present arms, <br>
and sing the National Anthem, salute each of us, and then <br>
climb back down, head first.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;YES SIR!!&quot; replies the private, and completes the task. <br>
<br>
&quot;Now that is a brave man! Beat that!!&quot; <br>
<br>
They all look to the Marine. &quot;Private,&quot; he says. <br>
<br>
&quot;YES SIR!!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Put on full combat gear. Put these two dogs in your pack. <br>
Using only one hand, climb that flagpole. At the top, sing <br>
'The Halls of Montezuma', put your knife in your teeth, and <br>
dive off, headfirst.&quot; <br>
<br>
The private snaps to attention, looks at the general and <br>
says, &quot;F**K YOU SIR!!&quot; <br>
<br>
The general turns to the others and says, &quot;Now THAT'S <br>
bravery!<br>

A grade school teacher was asking students what their parents did for a living. <br>
<br>
&quot;Tim, you be first,&quot; she said. <br>
<br>
&quot;What does your mother do all day?&quot; Tim stood up and proudly said, &quot;She's a doctor.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;That's wonderful. How about you, Amie?&quot; Amie shyly stood up, scuffed her feet and said, &quot;My father is a mailman.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you, Amie,&quot; said the teacher. &quot;What about your father, Billy?&quot; Billy proudly stood up and announced, &quot;My daddy plays piano in a whorehouse.&quot; <br>
<br>
The teacher was aghast and promptly changed the subject to geography. Later that day she went to Billy's house and rang the bell. Billy's father answered the door. The teacher explained what his son had said and demanded an explanation. Billy's father said, &quot;I'm actually an attorney. How can I explain a thing like that to a seven-year-old?&quot; <br>

<br>
Frodo looked out across the barren landscape, the Ring heavy in his pocket. "Oh, Sam, I'm so tired. We have travelled so far, and endured so much to come to this horrid place at last. But I cannot go on, I simply have not the strength to continue." <br>
<br>
"Enough of that, Mr. Frodo", Sam said, tears welling in his sad brown eyes. The six months of travel showed on Samwise Gamgee, and the strain of getting to this hellish point echoed still in his darkened countenance. His hood was drawn up against the hot wind blowing from the slopes of the infernal mountain. "Mr. Elrond chose well, he did, when he held counsel. He saw through to your heart, and knew you would be strong, Mr. Frodo, and that's what you are. Come now, let's get moving. The faster we're done with this unpleasant business the faster we can get back to the Shire." Sam glanced uneasily at Gollum, still tressed in the elven rope, and scratching where it burned his skin. Gollum glared back at Sam, an unmistakeable hungry leer in his look. <br>
<br>
"Aye, Samwise, it has been a long road, it's true. I do wish old Bilbo had never found this ring, and started us all on this perilous...what was that noise? Orcs?" <br>
<br>
On the path ahead, a commotion arose. Cheers and ragged screams welled from what sounded like a hundred voices filled the chasms around Mt. Doom with an unholy cacophany. From the cave mouth just ahead, where the Fires of Mt. Doom burned forever, a giant Ogre came stumbling out, and trod to within inches of where Gollum, Samwise, and Frodo sat. The three shrank back against the cliff in fear, but the ogre took no notice of them. Instead, he raised his cudgel to the sky, and screamed in the full timbre of his ogrish voice, "WOOT! Dark Lord PWNED!" <br>
<br>
An answering call of a hundred voices echoed from without the cave, and many a shout of "Woot!" and "Gratz!" came, as more and more beings piled forth from the cave. Elves, Hobbits, Trolls, and Humans all came forth, slapping the ogre on the back and looking at a small black bag the ogre held in his other hand. "PWNED!" <br>
<br>
"Uhm, excuse me...", began Frodo. <br>
<br>
"Eh?" the ogre turned and looked at the halfing, noticing him for the first time. "WTF are you doing here? Is that Mithril? Dude, WTF are you doing in this zone in Mithril? Go to Lothlorien, and get yourself a Galadriel Skin Tunic. It's like so much better than that crap you're wearing. Mithril, that's like, tradeskill stuff, right? Hey, Ubernutz, check this hobbit out, he's in this zone in fooking tradeskill crap!" <br>
<br>
"Just a sec, Urofsuke," a half elf said from a little ways up the trail. "I'm doing loot. Did you say tradeskill stuff? Hah, how lame!" <br>
<br>
Frodo's head swam, with hunger and the heat. "Yes, the tunic, it was forged by dwarves long ago, and was given to me by my Uncle..." <br>
<br>
"You're a twink?" <br>
<br>
"Ah, hmm. I was just wondering..ah, you see, I found this Ring, lost for centuries, and was sent on a quest from Rivendell to destroy..." <br>
<br>
"You're doing the fooking QUEST?! BWAH, hahahah, that's rich, dude, no one has the time to wait for that Gollum puke to spawn! Just come and kill TDL and get his hand, and do the turn in from there. WTF, I can't believe you waited for the fooking ring." Urofsuke peered down at the little hobbit, a look of distain across his broad face. "Doesn't matter now, of course, we just pwned TDL and he won't be around for a while." <br>
<br>
Frodo blinked, confused by the ogre's words. "TDL...?" <br>
<br>
Urofsuke sighed, and took on a tone of voice usually reserved for small, ogrish children who had eaten a froglok right before their dinnertime. "The Dark Lord, dude. The boss mob in this zone. We just killed him, so he won't be up for you to do the quest part with that ring." <br>
<br>
"But the council of Rivendell...." <br>
<br>
"Dude, let me tell you, Rivendell sucks. It's only good for tradeskills. Only reason to go to that zone is to pharm crowns from Elrond. Nice crown, but it's his rare. He usually just drops a no drop phial, heals damage from Mordor Blades. Like anyone uses one of those POS things." <br>
<br>
"Pharm...crowns?" Frodo's vision blurred, and he swayed backwards, momentarily losing his footing. He knocked against Gollum, who let out a yelp and scampered further back against the cliff. <br>
<br>
"Holy fook, it's Gollum!" and without another word, Urofsuke smashed Gollum with a mighty blow from his cudgel, and killed the poor, pathetic creature outright. Gollum let out a small squeal, then lay still, pressed against the elven cord. "Hahahah! Fooking Greenie mob! I love those!", and the ogre walked up and took a heretofore unseen bag from Gollum's back. "Woot! Gollum's satchel! This'll bring me a couple kpp! Uh, dude, there's another ring on the corpse, it's no drop, and not lore, if you want it..." <br>
<br>
"Now see here, Gollum was with us!" Samwise began, momentarily overcoming his bewilderment and fear to approach the towering ogre. "We were taking him to..." <br>
<br>
"Can't claim an outdoor mob, dude. Gollum's FFA. If you didn't attack him, he's not your mob. Sorry, them's the rules." <br>
<br>
"Urofsuke, my alt just reported Smaug up in Gondor, dude, let's go!" Ubernutz had finished handing around what appeared to be a darkened sword and crown. "We're porting out from here, you in?" <br>
<br>
"Yeah, I"m coming. Well, nice talking to you guys. We're porting to Gondor, you guys need a lift?" <br>
<br>
"We have walked for many months to come to this place..." Frodo began again, trying to regain some measure of control over the situation. <br>
<br>
"You WALKED? In MITHRIL? To MOUNT DOOM? Dude, there's a port in at Minas Morgul! WTF ever, okay? I'm outta here." And with that, a shimmering light surrounded the ogre, and a whooshing sound heralded his isappearance, and the disappearance of the other hundred or so souls that had gathered on that desolate trail, leaving Samwise and Frodo alone, once again, with only the bleeding corpse of Gollum for company. The one ring of power gleamed dully in Frodo's hand, and seemed, for a long while, to be just a bit heavier than it had been.<br>

<br>
1. From The Gloucester Citizen: 'A sex line caller complained to Trading Standards. After dialling an 0891 number from an advertisement entitled &quot;Hear Me Moan&quot;, the caller was played a tape of a woman nagging her husband for failing to do jobs around the house. Consumer Watchdogs in Dorset refused to look into the complaint, saying, &quot;He got what he deserved.&quot;' <br>
2. From The Guardian: 'After being charged £20 for a £10 overdraft, 30 year old Michael Howard of Leeds changed his name by deedpoll to &quot;Yorkshire Bank Plc are Fascist Bastards&quot;. The Bank has now asked him to close his account, and Mr Bastards has asked them to repay the 69p balance by cheque, made out in his new name.' <br>
3. Phreakers, or 'phone hackers, managed to break into the telephone system of 'Weight Watchers' in Glasgow, and changed the outgoing message to 'Hello, you fat bastard' <br>
4. From the Churchdown Parish Magazine: 'Would the Congregation please note that the bowl at the back of the Church, labelled &quot;For The Sick&quot;, is for monetary donations only.' <br>
5. From The Guardian concerning a sign seen in a Police canteen in Christchurch, New Zealand: 'Will the person who took a slice of cake from the Commissioner's Office return it immediately. It is needed as evidence in a poisoning case.' <br>
6. From The Times: 'A young girl, who was blown out to sea on a set of inflatable teeth, was rescued by a man on an inflatable lobster. A coastguard spokesman commented: &quot;This sort of thing is all too common these days.&quot; <br>
7. From The Daily Telegraph in a piece headed &quot;Brussels Pays L200,000 to Save Prostitutes&quot;: &quot;...the money will not be going directly into the prostitutes' pockets, but will be used to encourage them to lead a better life. We will be training them for new positions in hotels.&quot; <br>
8. From The Derby Abbey Community News &quot;We apologise for the error in the last edition, in which we stated that 'Mr Fred Nicolme is a Defective in the Police Force'. This was a typographical error. We meant of course that Mr Nicolme is a Detective in the Police Farce.&quot; <br>
9. From The Manchester Evening News &quot;Police called to arrest a naked man on the platform at Piccadilly Station released their suspect after he produced a valid rail ticket.&quot; <br>
10. An Austrian circus dwarf died recently when he bounced sideways from a trampoline and was swallowed by a hippopotamus. Seven thousand people watched as little Franz Dasch popped into the mouth of Hilda the Hippo and the animal's gag reflex forced it to swallow. The crowd applauded wildly before other circus people realised what had happened. <br>
