No I am not drunk or trying to make a good impression. I would like to tell you of how we can come together and help each other and work as a team. I am not sure how many know of the PoTC (Protection of the Cabbage) quest but yes its for druids to get that spell. However as a side line you can also get one (two for druids) earrings which are quite nice. <br>
<br>
However the crunch comes that you need to make 9 gifts to then make these earrings. Now to make these gifts requires some grandmasters in several trade skills, well to be exact bakery, brewing, jewelry, pottery, smithing, tailoring,  and yes believe it or not fishing. Being a good forager does help too :-)<br>
<br>
Now unless someone has been spending every copper become an expert in these area we have to rely on several different peeps to do one or more of these trade skills. Do you know who has a good skill in these?<br>
<br>
OK for example we have 6 guildies with bakery over 135 but unfortunately maybe only one with jewelry near that level. Now I don't want every one to throw down what they are doing and rush off to do tradeskill but I would like to see us come together as a team help each other in certain areas and then have a few grandmasters in several of them. <br>
<br>
I am certainly prepared to spend the money and time for not only myself but to assist others getting their skills up there too. I will suggest that we will need to get outside help for the jewelry and tailoring areas. Why? well....<br>
1. jewelry - there are plenty there already and several are ex-guildies and friend plus its super expensive over 100<br>
2. tailoring - it would take every one of us over a week fulltime to get the materials just to get one of us even close to 200 assuming one was already well over 100. Yes its the most painstaking tradeskill to raise. That is why I am so PROUD of Jerila in her success with the Vahshal quest. :-)<br>
<br>
OK the bad news is the earrings are recommended for lvl 51+ but that doesn't mean you can help or infact get one for a lower level (it will not be of full potential thats all). <br>
<br>
Its only due to the fact that peeps have put down their tradeskills on Guildmagic.com that I was able to check out what everyone has or last updated. I am sure there are more with skills but have never put them down. <br>
<br>
I was going to take brewing and fishing myself but last night I was chatting to Dinji and Dinj (yes they are like Luni and Roni hehe) and they already have brewing at 196 and fishing at 200 and would like to jump aboard our band wagon on this. I hope noone minds if I sort of accepted unless anyone has any violent objections. We were going to start making fishing poles and by selling the excess then have revenue for the rest. <br>
<br>
I am not sure how to ask peeps for this but I would like to make some recommendations for different areas. <br>
As I said we have brewing and fishing covered, so...<br>
Bakery - Kemie, Lili or Eenara are all good in this area, 144+<br>
Pottery - I am happy to take it but Kemie is not far behind me and Luni too. I think all over 120 up to 145+<br>
Smithing - either Bren or Renningin both have skills in the 170 range (maybe better now) <br>
<br>
And as said before we ask friends for the tailoring and jewelry assistance (plus a chanter)<br>
OK so now is the time to fess up with any secret skills or if u would like to help and join in the fun. Most of the things can be bought or foraged with only one major exception.<br>
<br>
ARE U WITH ME? Would u like to join this bandwagon? hehe and I will be giving out free booze LOL. Lets come together and work like a team and this can be of benefit to all within the guild, maybe not today or tomorrow but in the near future for sure.<br>
<br>
cheers<br>
Tussle<br>
<br>
Legal Note: the writer promises that this bandwagon has never been or will never be apart of Galadria's circus with the requirement to fight red mobs and die valiently :-)<br>
/ducks for DEEEEP cover - help!!<br>
<br>
Update:<br>
Tuss has 4 picnics, 20 cabbages, 2 robes, 2 steins and 5 poles. I now have 9 demi-sec champagnes and 8 lotus pies.:-) Gave Kemie some poles, pies and a few demi-secs.<br>

Then i'd be able to make a trophy too.  Which, if you check the stats, are a nice ranged slot item.  Here's the stats if you can't find them....STR 10, CHA 50, INT 10, WIS 10, primary, secondary, ranged, wt 0.1. NO DROP...requires the talents of a jeweler (trivial for this part is 176) potter (trivial here is 136) and then whichever skill you are grandmaster in (trivial 250)<br>
<br>
Here are the items required to be made and how to make them...<br>
Mounted gems : 2 bars of velium, [gem] (diamond, blue diamond, black sapphire, jacinth) : made by a  jeweler, trivialing at 176<br>
<br>
Artisan's seal : Mounted blue diamond, mounted diamond, mounted black sapphire, mounted jacinth, 1 Purified Vial of Mana, small block of clay, flask of water - combine in a pottery wheel, then fire with an HQ firing sheet in kiln : Pottery, trivials at 136<br>
<br>
Tradeskill Trophy : Smiths: Artisan's Seal + Smithy Hammer in Forge = Grandmaster Smith's Hammer <br>
Tailoring: Artisan's Seal + Embroidering Needle in Tailoring Kit = Grandmaster Tailor's Needle <br>
Jewelcraft: Artisan's Seal + Silver Bar + Glass Shard in Jewelcraft Kit = Grandmaster's Jeweller's Eyeglass <br>
Pottery: Artisan's Seal + Sculpting Tools = Grandmaster Potter's Sculptor <br>
Baking: Artisan's Seal + Dairy Spoon = Grandmaster's Baking Spoon <br>
Fletching: Artisan's Seal + Fish Bone Dart Tool = Grandmaster Fletcher's Knife <br>
Brewing - Artisan's Seal + Corking Device = Grandmaster Brewer's Corker <br>
Tinkering - Artisan's Seal + Metal Bits + Sharpening Stone = Grandmaster's Tinkering Spanner<br>
All of these trivial at 250.<br>
<br>
This could be something we can work towards kinda on the side of the cabbage quest.<br>
<br>
Also, the new trophys (after the june 12th patch) have a summon grandmaster's satchel on them aswell...10 slot, 100% WR bag that's no rent no drop.<br>
<br>
Anyway, just thought you guys might wanna know that...hehe, maybe this'll give a little extra drive to get that tradeskill up =P<br>

The Lotus Pie is the &quot;clincher&quot; as it were, and the worst thing about this one is that the materials necessary (any one of a variety of items with lotus in the name) all drop from lotus mobs in Fungus Grove, a high level Luclin zone that WILL be red to most of us still in our 40's, Tuss! ROFL<br>
<br>
As to the rest, well I'm taking the plunge and working on getting Kemie's pottery up further (now at 141 and  climbing).<br>
<br>
Darn, too bad they didn't throw fletching into the mix - Gala is closest to grandmastering that of any of my char's tradeskills, with 179. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Oh well... go figure!<br>
<br>
Where there's a will there's a way, folks.  You always have something like a 6 per cent chance of success making an item even with a lower tradeskill than the trivial, but of course attempts on pricey items like these can waste a lot of components.  That just means we have to secure a lot of components, and if we put our minds to it we can get there.<br>
<br>
It WILL take teamwork.  By the way Tuss, farming for cat pelts in NK I managed to forage bunches of plains pebbles and wild cabbages.  Hehe when you gonna imbue for me, or having already made at least one Lucky Cabbage, do you just want the supplies?<br>

As of last night, we have I think 13 Misty Thicket Picnics on hand, and as of today, 11 or so Lucky Cabbages. Tuss and Dinji are planning on working on the fishing poles tonight...<br>
<br>
Kemie's pottery has climbed to 156 (and as a side bonus, tailoring to 100 - YAY!)...<br>
<br>
For those of you who don't know them already, here are the stats on the earrings:<br>

Kemie's pottery 168 and still climbing...<br>
<br>
Bren has successfully made two of the blades and 3 of the hilts so far for the Blessed Sickle.  As we found one hilt on a merchant, totals now are 2 blades and 3 hilts.  Cost of grandmastering smithing may be prohibitive, so it is possible that when we have enough of each of the three parts assembled we will seek a grandmaster for the final combines.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/beverquestersofnorrath.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=galadriaculravenni>Galadria Culravenni</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Leader of Victus Fortis</span><br>  Posts: 1229<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/12/02 11:14:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=736.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PoTC quest and team work required</span><hr size=1> Well... my grandmaster smith contact failed four out of four attempts on the sickle. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   With each attempt costing us 4 emeralds (13p6g5s each), 3 sapphires (105p each) and 3 rubies (131p2g5s each) at the very least, failures are pretty costly.  Evidently many of these high trivial combines have a failure rate of 50 per cent, or even 75 per cent, which explains why it is so expensive.<br>
<br>
For those of you who are helping, or would like to help, with this quest, but are not working on raising your tradeskills, there are any number of foraged or dropped items we need that you might be able to provide.<br>
<br>
Among these are:<br>
<br>
dropped emeralds, sapphires, rubies, star rubies<br>
dropped parts from lotuses in Fungus Grove (includes sap, petals etc.)<br>
permafrost crystals (dropped or ground spawn from Permafrost)<br>
iron oxide (dropped from various elementals or ground spawn, Steamfont and other zones)<br>
dropped blocks/pieces of velium<br>
<br>
foraged plains pebbles<br>
foraged dragon eggs<br>
foraged branches of planar oak<br>
<br>
and of course, plat donations are always useful (wink)<br>
<br>
of the gems, emeralds and sapphires are the highest priority, as the former are used in making Blessed Dust of Tunare (which is included in the recipes for many of the gifts) and vials of clear mana, and sapphires are used both in the pommels for the sickle and to make vials of distilled mana (which eat up two per vial).<br>
<br>
A partial breakdown of pricey items needed for each full set of gifts includes:<br>
<br>
15 celestial essence (made from solvent and high end research component such as Scent of Marr)<br>
9 emeralds<br>
6 sapphires<br>
4 rubies<br>
<br>
Multiply this times 7 sets minimum we are trying to make, and it certainly adds up!  Hopefully, however, as we proceed we will be able to sell off extra completed items (I believe Tuss and Dinji are already doing this with the Blessed Fishing Poles) or trade them for others we lack the skills to make for ourselves.  In the end, the quest may serve as quite a money-maker for the guild as a whole - we know of one former guildie who shelled out 23k for all nine completed gifts to get her earring.... <p><p align="center"><a

Am going for 10 more fishing poles today, most of which are for different members to use in the quest itself. The extras I will sell for cash (or exchange for items still needed by others) to help finish those sickles and start on the idols. If I get 10 poles today I want to hand them out as they are not stackable so hope to do so over the next few day and definitely by friday.<br>
<br>
Hunted some lotus last night in FG and they are not that hard really so long as you go for the single ones. We did it with 55 tank, 60 mage (yes with pet) and myself. It would require to have our best magic resistant stuff on and to get right into the fight. Drones and death dots both stuck with no probs (well for me anyway). Yes they would be red to forties peeps but with a few 50s peeps definitely not a prob. If we grab a tank and a cleric it would not be a problem hunting them. Most of them are by themselves, a few are in pairs, so as long as we are careful not to stray to close to any shroom populations nearby we could get all the sap etc to make the lotus pie np in one night I would think. For each combine for the paste Kemie how many did u get? I know u get 6 pies from each combine there.<br>
<br>
Anyway we are getting there with only a few more items to go and we could start seeing some peeps with earring (*0*)/<br>

It's only on the final combine you get extras, I guess.  I did notice that each of these particular tradeskill items that have multiple &quot;gifts&quot; (i.e. for example, pottery which has two, and baking which has three) one requires much higher skill than the others.  The Misty Thicket Picnic and the Lucky Cabbage were relatively easy to make, but the pie probably requires higher skill to keep us on our toes. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I know the Star Ruby Encrusted Stein trivs at greater than 250.  From what you heard, triv on the Golden Idol is closer to 222, or at least under 250.  That's kind of amusing, because of course with the more pricey ingredients for the Idol, most potters would think it would be the harder one and leave it till last.  I should be getting together with Nienor tonight to make up a few distilled manas (have enough sapphires built up for just 5) so we will know then if this is so.  If triv is around 222, I should be able to make a couple at least (based on my experience with the Opal Steins which triv there), while if it is higher than 250 I will probably only have the six or seven per cent shot at a success.<br>
<br>
Hehe wish me luck. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

BUT I think so.  Last night Seb keys were mentioned.  I've already gotten half of mine, and would be interested in going back for the other half, and then I'll have to raise my fishing was it?  &lt;grin&gt;  however, we'll need a higher level tank than me to MT as all the quest mobs were red to me at 41 in Trak.  I might have decent AC, but it's aviodance ac, not mitigation, when they do hit me it's like 100 points a pop..........  So lets put a key gathering session together, and find us a tank !<br>
