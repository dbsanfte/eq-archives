I ask as I walk through the mists and smoke.<br>
&quot;You are who you were meant to be,&quot; comes the reply, again from out of no where.<br>
<br>
I have walked through these mists for what seems like days, never coming across any land mark, any other living being. It is a puzzle, though I lack the fear that should be flowing through me. All around me, the mist swirls and is blown, but by what direction, I can not see. Time has no meaning here, as I neither grow hungry...nor thirsty...<br>
_________<br>
<br>
He sits, bolt upright, from his slumber. His body is shimmering with a bluish white energy. His skin tingles everywhere, feeling more alive than ever before. Then the screams start. Distant, only in his mind, but soon reaching his ears. He quickly straps on his armor, weapons and packs his things. He has been running for over a week now, the screams following him all the time, always catching him at night, when he is alone. He has tried to keep some kind of company, but always, something happens ; they are killed, called away, distracted or otherwise detained from joining him in his camp. He has hired out to caravans, in hopes that the constant company would keep him safe. It hasn't. Always, he is chased off into the night, his hastily gathered things trailing behind him. He has been running for so long......<br>
_________<br>
<br>
The staff hits him squarely in the chest, sending him reeling backwards, his balance lost. He falls to the ground with a loud *thump*. <br>
&quot;Oaf!&quot;<br>
&quot;PAY attention!!&quot; the instructor yells.<br>
&quot;Sorry,&quot; the student mumbles as he gets back up and again assumes his defensive stance.<br>
&quot;PREPARE!&quot; the instructor yells. Bringing his staff back, he whips it forward, the air whistling as the wooden staff hits the student again in the stomach, this time the student barely moving. Letting out the pressure of the hit by exhaling, the student begins to move through his kata. Bringing his fists to his hips, he squats down a bit, centering himself just as his instructor hits him again, this time, in the upper right thigh. Again, the student doesn't notice, continuing through his kata as if nothing were happening....<br>
________<br>
<br>
&quot;Eat, sire. You must regain your strength if you are to participate in the tourney&quot; the innkeeper said.<br>
<br>
Nodding, the stranger finishes his stew, moping up the rest with his half eaten loaf of bread. A gust of wind heralds another stranger, this one shorter but his movements quick, sure....graceful : Elven. He knew it instinctively. He hated elves, all elves........he stands, his hands pulling his Kodiak claws and his fine steal longsword......<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Startlingly clear, the visions keep pouring into his mind, the crystal spinning faster and faster. His eyes held by the shards of light eminating from the spinning gem, his face slack and expressionless....the images keep coming..<br>
________<br>
<br>
He brings his claws up, vertically, ripping through plate armor and skin with such ease. His momentum carries him upwards, his legs pushing off the ground and he rips open the chest the of his opponent, spilling his internal organs onto the floor in front of him. Blinking, the elf falls back, shock and fear freezing, forever, onto his face as he dies.<br>
<br>
Watching impassively as the elf falls, the stranger calmly begins to clean his weapon. He didn't even have to use his sword. Weak elves.. he sighs inwardly and walks back to his seat. The innkeeper, motioning to a barmaid to clean up the mess, sets before the stranger his meal, never giving the ordeal a second notice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you for service,&quot; the stranger says, already digging into the food. He finishes soon after and pushes his plate and empty beer stien away. Standing, he again wields his claws and begins to systematically slaughter the inhabitants of the inn, one... by one....<br>
________<br>
<br>
Shaking, the ranger's eyes begin to tear up, as the bloody scene plays out in his minds eye. Openly weeping at the lose of life he is seeing, he is helpless as it continues. He can't even see the Beholder slowly floating towards him from behind, it's eye stocks already pointing at him, all ten of  them. The crystal holds his attention...and spins on....<br>
________<br>
<br>
&quot;The cup is, indeed, only half full. IF. If you are of the mind that life empty. If you believe that life is meaningless and empty then yes, to you, it is only half full, for you are alive, so contribute, what you think, is meaninglessness to everything else. But, if you are of the other mind, then life is half empty, and you will strive, with all that you are, to fill that other half with your deeds, your words, indeed, your very self,&quot; the master says, his movements fluid as he weaves in and out of  the posts. His hands held and tied behind his back with vine, his eyes covered by a strip of clothe, he ducks, dodges and rolls his way around each post, his breathing even, his head leading the way.<br>
<br>
&quot;You must 'feel' the posts. You have to 'see' them in your mind, 'see' where they are and where they are positioned. Never let the training of your senses go without for any reason, for without them, you will die.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bunching his legs up underneath himself, the master leaps into the air, landing as if with no effort, on the top of one post, his balance perfect. His student looks on with open mouth...<br>
________<br>
<br>
The hissing of the Beholder becomes louder as it anticipates the ranger. Finding the crystal was easy, placing it here, easier. Immune to most mind altering spells and affects, the Beholder soon found that his slaves fell victim to this gem whenever it left it out. Though, like all his brothren, he loved eating his food kicking and screaming, the satisfying sound of the wails echoing throughout it's innerds as it's sharp teeth crunched through bone, muscle, sinue, it nonetheless loved being able to snatch up it's food without using it's powers OR chasing it down.<br>
<br>
The rangers eyes continued to tear up, his vision slightly clouding over....just... enough...THERE. With a sudden jerk, the ranger leaps backwards, almost right into the Beholders mouth. Planting his feet, he leaps straight up, already drawing his claws and hammer. Spinning in mid air, he turns 180 degrees to face the Beholder, coming down with claws leading, hammer poised over his head to smash down. Instinct alone is directing his movements, his agility and quickness from hours and days and years of training taking over. He doesn't think, he reacts. His responses are matched to those being made by the Beholder. Two eye stocks, the stun and fire ones, swival up to point at the ranger, already glowing as the power builds within them. The Beholder, surprised that this elf could so easily break from his gem's spell, sighs and brings it's power to bare.<br>
<br>
The tip of the rangers claws touch the eye stock that begins giving off heat and slips into the eye with ease. Opening it's mouth in pain, the Beholder begins to immediantly back off, but the ranger, using momentum and gifted str, plunges his claws straight down, splitting the eye stock down the middle and continuing, piercing the Beholders head, splattering it's blood in wide random patterns across the walls. The scream echo'ed throughout the labyrinth. Hearing their masters screams, the slaves all began to mutter amoungst themselves...then as one, bolted for the passage that lead out to the upper world.. to freedom. As the entered the passage, they came face to face with the Guardians, a tribe Ry`Gorr orcs and their Dire wolf pets. Within seconds, it was over, the slaves never having a chance. Also hearing the Beholders screams of pain, the orcs, figuring that with the death of the Beholder their terms of service was ended, turned and began filing out of the cavern, heading towards the entrance...<br>
<br>
&quot;You will die for that,&quot; the Beholder's voice grates out, his use of  the common tongue scetchy at best. Circling around, the Beholder brought it's disintegration beam to bare, the beam shearing through the walls and earth as a knife would through paper, leaving blackened and grooved marks everywhere. The ranger, smiling now for he was aware of things at last, free at last from the crystals mesmerzing affects, easily dives and rolls out of the way. Standing up quickly, he summons his 'mana' and begins to cast. Seconds later, flames dance around his fingers and shoot out towards the Beholder. All 9 of it's eyes turn and as one, shoot off their various affects, the ranger, at the same time, runs to the side a bit, then leaps at the Beholder. 2 eye stocks, one that snares and the other that gives off a chilling ray, swing towards him. But the Beholder has again underestimated the rangers speed and is too late. Again the claws slash down, this time, severing completely the one that is sooo cold. Instantly, his claws are coated in ice, but the eye stock lays at his feet. His hammer, raised above his head, comes down just as the snaring one takes aim, smashes through the eye lense and the eye splatters. Knowing something is very wrong here, the Beholder mouths a spell of Translocation, teleporting itself away to a safe spot, leaving the ranger standing in the middle of an empty room with his gem. Though lost, the Beholder is only concerned about it's own well being. Also, it knows...it will have to find that tribe of Orcs again, to exact punishment for their lack of assistance. He sent the call but they didn't come. He knew they lived for he could feel their life energy's still. He would find them...eventually...<br>
