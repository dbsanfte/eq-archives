I'm not ripping XA, as there are members who weren't even there who seem to be caught in the crossfire.<br><br>I'm concerned that Delta, in effect, pulled an &quot;Inner Circle&quot; move, and completely blew off the other mages that had contributed to clearing Hate to the Magi...especially given his position as leader of XA.<br><br>Have I been heated today in my posts?

If you wish to slanderise me, wait for my reply.<br><br>Now, in my defense, you would have known this had you been there, I DID tell the ENTIRE CHANNEL that SS WAS defaulting the staff to me. Mein knew, he even sent me a tell saying he wouldn't roll against me. <br>Fenren knew, he sent me a tell asking my why.<br><br>Heres why.<br>When my guild heard magi was up for the taking and he had staff, we jumped on it and got going as soon as our spawn cycle was done. We got stones and ported up, we were ready to take Magi ALONE. However some of the XA members (god bless them for doing so, i really appreciate it) decided to stay and throw in a helping hand, as well as get a shot at some loot we might run across. <br><br>We didn't complain, the more the merrier, but this was an SS raid for ME. We went up to kill Magi for me, and I made this so crystal clear it hurts my head that you could possibly think otherwise. Some people stayed anyways, including Mein (one of the mages and a friend of mine). Mein didn't complain, he wanted a shot at some apothic, Fen however blamed me for setting this up with tal and blah blah blah. Tal worked it out with him and he even apolagised for over reacting.<br>"Fenren tells you, 'You are scum'  - A tell tal got<br><br>Really, SS went up on our own accord, tal ended the raid a little bit late, and after a wipe.. it was time for her to go, and her only puller, Nos as well. So we went up and killed magi, and im sorry, i guess we may not be as kind hearted as HK might be but when a member of SS who has been leading hate raids for the past two years finally gets a shot at the item hes been aiming at, they arnt just going to let another mage roll on it. Mein is the only mage who stayed after, and if fen had he would have gotten a piece of apothic as well, we LET the other people stay so they could pick up some extra loot. That and like i said, the more the merrier.<br><br>Don't accuse me of pulling some move like Inner Circle did, i let the mages know what was up, Mein got the message... maybe you guys just need to pay a little better attention before you pass the blame when its not needed. Or not to sound rude, perhaps you should simply not concern yourself with something you wern't there to witness firsthand. <br><br> <p><IMG SRC=http://www.lochshea.com/sig/delt.jpg><center><a href=http://www.geocities.com/eqsoulsurvivors/Main.htm>Soul Survivors</a></center><center><a href=mailto:Deltanamos@msn.com><IMG SRC=http://www.localendar.com/clipart/holidays/stpats.gif></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/uwithmus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Withmus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Treehuggin' Bastage We Call, Leader</span><br>  Posts: 721<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/15/02 6:57:14 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/soulsurvivorguild/viscous.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Clearing thread from XA - No need to continue it there</span><hr size=1> I'm going to copy my post on the XA boards to ours so it can be read again and understood on our grounds.  I want to STRESS for anyone posting here, that this is to remain on topic, polite, void of name calling and childish behavior, and to the point.  And if you can please don't use the word suxxors or other doodspeak or whatever it's called k thnx!<br><br>Begin XA quote:<br><br>This has been a great read.  Most of you have expressed yourself intelligently and coherantly, and have valid points.  This being said, I am going to post my only response on this forum because my guild is being attacked as being involved in a 'conspiricy.'<br><br>Here are the events as seen through the eyes of myself and the rest of my guild excluding Deltanamos *and let it be said that Delt is not the guildleader of Soul Survivors, and does not command us at will like some of you think*.<br><br>At the time of the XA Hate raid, I was leading a small war raid in Acrylia Caverns.  I had heard word of XA in hate and gave it no more thought, as I am not an XA raider.  I want to stress this fact..Soul Survivors is not an XA affiliated guild.  In fact, I'm constantly telling Delt to pay as much attention and heart to our guild as he does to helping the people in XA.  We *Soul Survivors* have our own agenda's, but two or three of our members are very prominent in XA and we do, overall I believe, respect and admire XA.  During this 'raid' in AC, Delt informs us via guildchat that the Magi Spawned, and that the XA raid was ending due to not having the proper set up to kill the magi, and their time was up as POSTED in the calendar.  As some of you know Delt has been after this piece for a VERY long time and we hear about it a LOT. :)  <br><br>Well when I found out that the magi was up, and XA was not going to kill as they stated in the XA channel, I told Delt that I would call my raid and move it to Hate in a heartbeat if the Magi was up for grabs.  Delt nor myself had given any thought prior, to using XA to clear all the trash just to benefit us.  I in fact had to push Delt into letting me move the raid as he was hesitant to end the guild raid, just to help him.  This is the type of person Delt is....everyone else first. <br><br>Needless to say my raid was in Sro in 5 minutes ready to go up.  I'm in full belief that if House Kel'Dar, or whatever their name is now, cared about their mage, they would have been there too had they known he was up; I would garner he would have told his guild he wanted this piece, and them knowing he was in hate, they might have had their ears pricked up to assist him or congrat him.  I find it hard to believe that in all this time the Magi was up, this mage who was waiting and hoping and praying for him to spawn, and was on this raid to benefit himself in a way his guild would apparently not, had never once seen him cast a spell.  The very minute I entered the plane and went to the camp spot I could see the Magi Casting.<br><br>Now at this point, the XA raid was over.  You can blame me for taking my guild up.... I don't mind in the least cause that's what I do.  This was my guild's raid at this point and I was instructing people on what to do.  Delt invited the XA people who had stayed behind to help us kill Magi.  Mind you we didn't require assistance, but in the process of pulling Magi and his cohorts, there was loot to be had and we didn't mind anyone else to be in on it; and we were happy for the company!<br><br>I'm not here to defend Deltanamos.  I'm not here to defend XA.  I'm here in the defense of my guild who was wrongfully accused of some 'allied subversion.'  Should anyone want to discuss this further, as this is the only thing that need be discussed in my opinion, I invite you all over to our guild message boards where I personlly will start the thread.  http://pub44.ezboard.com/bpremierguildforum  Ok, I just checked and see that a thread has already started under our Main forum so go check it out.  heh<br><br>PS<br>I have my own raid rules as every guild on EQ does.  No one else is to be held responsible for what I allow on my raids.  I was there for my oldest eq friend Deltanamos, and I still see no reason as to why I would end my raid, move to Hate for an epic mob, and allow XA mages to roll just because they had been in the zone prior and were the remnants of an ended raid.  I wouldn't be letting someone from any guild or affiliation roll on epic loot on a mob I kill.  Sorry but that's how eq works.  <br><br>Now let's remember...this is a game and it's intended for fun so get out there and have some!<br><br>end quote<br><br>now on here I WILL defend Deltanamos. <p>Burgh Edin 60 Warlord</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/urukogdethbryngr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rukog DethBryngr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soul Survivor</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/15/02 7:42:45 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/eq/image.aspx?path=/CoachK69/fullsize%5cEQ/Troll1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Clearing thread from XA - No need to continue it there</span><hr size=1> I would expect nothing less than defense of a guildmember...which is, in effect, the mode I've been in all day.<br><br>It appears this simply has to be, as Slyde loves to put it, &quot;One of those things we'll have to agree to disagree about.&quot;<br><br>My personal values seem to be different from yours, is all.

It sounds like Burgh is taking some responsibility.  I still think a word from you stating, &quot;Burgh...I appreciate the support, but these other 2 guys have been here just as long, or longer than me...pushing hard to try to clear things out, and I think they deserve an equal shot at that staff&quot; would have convinced him.<br><br>Burgh may differ in his opinion and say that he wouldn't have accepted that from you anyway...but the fact remains that that didn't even seem to cross your mind.<br><br>THAT is my biggest issue...that you really didn't recognize that your friend and Fenren DID &quot;put in the time&quot; last night and probably deserved an equal shot at the drop, and again...it looks like it is something we have to agree to differ on.<br><br>My stance:  If Fenren had put out the call to us that the Mage was up and a raid was ending, and HKD showed behind me to assist, I'd be VERY upset if he didn't mention that there were some Mages from the previous raid that could use it and asked for that consideration.  I would feel WRONG going up there period to help one of my guildmates, knowing that he disregarded an honest plea from another mage in circumstances similar to last night.  If everyone had agreed to help him out and default, great...but Delta admitted already that Fenren asked him directly about the default, so Fenren clearly didn't feel great about what was happening.<br><br>Anyone who knows me well would agree that this is my true personality and belief system, and not just some &quot;made up Holier-than-thou&quot; statement from me designed to make you guys feel like you did something shady.<br><br>So...I don't know what else to say.  Like I posted elsewhere...I guess I'm naive a bit or something, believing that others have the same belief system as me...but everything I did know about XA and it's leadership to this point led me to that conclusion.<br><br>That it's different than I was led to believe is disappointing.<br><br>That's about all I have to say about it...all said elsewhere.

Morals are being happy when someone who has worked for something earns it.  In my opinion Delt earned this in the way he got it.  While your mage spent 4 hours raiding hate.  Deltanamos spent over a year, yes that is right, over a year camping Magi in hopes of getting his epic.  In our channel for our Acrylia Caverns raid Deltanamos made it clear that he did not want to &quot;Jump&quot; XA's raid, but that he would love to get his epic if they were unable to do it themselves.  XA was and would have been UNABLE to kill the mob themselves which is what I think my friend Withmus was getting at.  The raid was called due to time constraints and the fact that the raid could not continue with the resourses they had.  After and only after hearing that the raid would not go on we ported over to Sro and prepared to get Delt's staff.  On a vindicators raid a group can clear the way to Vindi with little or no troubles.  But when that group can't kill Vindi how is it not fair that another guild comes in and kills Vindi?  Somehow I feel that sharing loot with that group that couldn't do it is totally bogus, but OMG we actually shared the loot to get the rest of the way to Magi.  And the ONLY other mage that was there being Mein (I forget the whole name I'm sorry bro) sent a tell to Delt saying that he could not roll against him.  No I don't have the exact quote because it was sent to Delt, but delt told us it afterwards.   <br>        If you feel that we were immoral that is fine, but even the kindest of people one of which being Delt deserves to recieve something back for his kindness.  I still hold HKD in high regards even if you don't respect us anymore because I have friends in your guild who I'm sure will still keep their opinion of me.  Time speaks louder than a few small actions.  In time you will learn that SS is a respectable guild and doesn't try to take advantage of anyone, jump spawns, or act immoral.  I truly believe that there is no way to say if what we did was moral or immoral because we all have a different view of the situation and we all have our allies in one place or another.  But what I am sure of is that what is done is done and there is no way to rewrite it.  I respect the guilds decision and I can't think of any other way I myself would have delt with the situation.  A half cleared Hate.  An epic mob you have waited a full year to kill.  A raid which has just ended and is unable to kill that mob you have been waiting a year to kill.  And your friends on, at your side urging you to get that piece you have worked so hard for.  If you would have done something different in that situation fine, but we did what we thought was right, and I'm sure none of the Soul Survivors have any regrets.<br><br><br>Rezzin, Healin, and Buffin...

I had called to the raid that I had to go in 45 minutes (I've been on nearly every raid XA has had in 4 months, including 29 days of daily raids, and we *always* quit at 11pm my time because I am ALWAYS the puller). Tal then asks me if I can pull the Magi. I didn't even know the Magi was on the first floor ! That is how low of a priority it was for the XA raid. She tried to tell me where to go and what to clear so the people on our raid could kill the Magi, but we were stumped by the Deathrot Knight. Again, I thought she meant clear a path upstairs. We got a wipe from the 2nd floor while I was away about to clear house B. By the time we got everyone ressed, I had 15 minutes left-- time to call the raid.<br><br>---The XA chat channel is not a closed channel for purposes of our own evil plotting. It's a public channel we use to chat and work together to accomplish goals for anyone willing to work for those goals.<br><br>---Again, there seems to be only *one* person on the XA raid who had any problem with what happened, and that was only because he made an assuption (a reasonable one, I might add). Fortunately, it was explained to him that it was dumb luck that Deltanamos had his own raid ready and, as far as I know, he was cool with it. I even spoke with Fenren today in-game (about 2 hours ago) and he seemed cool with it. This bears the obvious question &quot;Why is it the only people that have a problem with events were people that weren't there?&quot;<br><br>---I could TOTALLY agree with you if only things went how you believe they did. They did not. I don't speak from OPINION. I speak as someone who was THERE. I speak as someone who knows XA probably better than 99% of XA members. I speak as someone who plays a main role in almost every XA raid. I speak as someone with, as far as I know, a spotless history of honor. Poor Fenren has been pushed about like a pawn in this event, and I can only hope he gathers enough courage to join XA on our bi-monthly raids to Hate. We'll take him along any time. *THAT* is how XA is. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.premiernet.net/~chandler/images/newmaclogo.gif"><BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=293437">http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=293437</A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/udeltanamossumnorxegony.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Deltanamos Sumnor Xegony</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.localendar.com/clipart/holidays/stpats.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>has been slain by an orc pawn!</span><br>  Posts: 709<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/15/02 10:54:48 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Clearing thread from XA - No need to continue it there</span><hr size=1> Hey Ruk, <br>You want to stay on the BASE point? ok<br><br>I'll begin getting on the base point with this quote<br><br>"only to reach the time limit before we could engage the Demi's...I'd sure have recognized the efforts of the other SK's there for the previous 4 hours and included them in rolls if they stayed, rather than, in effect, saying "Thanks for doing the dirty work for us. HKD will take it from here. Soul Leech defaults to Rukog!"<br><br>I recall not even considering accepting any loot other than the staff. I recall allowing the people who would have had to leave the zone had it not been for us to stay, and roll on loot. I recall thanking everyone on the raid for all the hard work they did and for remaining with me through the pull. I recall being almost as overjoyed with Mein winning his new robe as I was when I got my staff. <br><br>You wanna talk consideration for people? How bout recognition?<br><br>How many open XA raids have you led?<br>Notice how on the schedule RIGHT NOW there are two raids, each to a place in which i require nothing. How many times have I gone to hate? 20-30? How many times have I led? The Majority. How much loot have i aquired from there in my near two years of hate experience? My robe, boots and gloves were the only pieces i ever got from poh other than maybe 5-10 cash items in all that time up untill last friday. <br><br>How many times did i go to kedge? or com? How many epics did I aid in the completion of?<br><br>How many times was I IN ZONE, KNOWING Magi P'tasa was up, most likly with staff and KNOWING I couldnt go there because the group was getting tired, or we had to clear NEC, etc. and we wouldnt have the time afterward? Two times that happened to me, I quit the game for two months it was so horribly frustrating.<br><br>You dont have the slightest inkling of what the meaning of the words recognition  and consideration are untill your needs preceed the needs of the 30 other people on your raid.<br><br>How much XP have I lost running suicide groups or trying to summon people to an unleared part of the zone? <br><br>How many of my guildies came to my aid that night? Willing to show recognition for the work I've done for other people, for XA and for my guild. <br><br>It hurts when you accuse me of being greedy, or not caring about the other mages. Your poor fenren was sending me tells AFTER he gated out of hate. He was gone, what did you want me to say? <br><br>"sorry guy i may have raided with once or twice in the past, I didn't mean not to notice you. It's perfectly alright you just accused me of conspiring with the orginization that I 've been helping to run for nearly two years now for my own selfish needs. Why don't you come back from wherever you gated to, we can port you up, MY guild can clear to Magi and I'll let you roll on it with me because youve been such a good sport."<br><br>The truth is i recognise what XA did up there before us. But the raid ended, people stayed for one of two reasons, to assist SS or me or to remain for loot. I think it was damn nice of us to do that, if my raid was ending in hate before we got to (insert_epic_mob_name_here00) and you came up to take him on for a guildy who has been working at that goal for god knows how long, do you honestly believe your guild would just let the other people who would have had to leave had it not been for you to roll?<br>What if they sent tells insulting you, your guild, your orginization, and your friends? Would you still do it?<br>Awnser: FUCK NO<br><br><br>Next part, who made the call to default the staff. I don't know who beat me to it, I think tal auctually was the first one to announce it, but i made it clear as well, why does it matter who said it? Even Fenren doesnt care anymore. Maybe i just plain out said it, everyone but Fen at the time seemed to agree with the situation, nobody but him seemed to feel robbed of anything. So yeah, if you want to sleep at night, i made the call, and my guild is horrible and were in cahoots with XA to steal mobs away from XAers who work so <a href=http://www.xegonyalliance.org/pop_profile.asp?mode=display&id=387> hard </a> for xa in comparison to <a href=http://www.xegonyalliance.org/pop_profile.asp?mode=display&id=4>  Others </a><br><br>We don't help other people with thier epics or help people get new gear, isnt that right Mein Agra (who was that SK we gave pog BP to?) Errdaen Furiel and others?<br><br>We spend all of our time screwing people over because we enjoy doing it, its all one big conpiracy and me and tal run the whole operation. Our next goal is to KS Emporer in Ssra and hopefully we can learn some good techniques from TMC and IC on EQ politics and pulling strategies. Thats right, were total assholes and im the biggest one of all. <br><br>Which is why im willing to bet that not one person in here (or XA or anywhere) can name a single moment in time that i ever thought of KSing them, jumping thier raid, stealing thier spawn, eating thier sandwich, or one moment that i wasnt willing to share a zone with another guild, or move if there wasnt room. Not one time did i ever openly strike out against anyone, (aside from a few guilds that are simply full of assholes.. and thank god are now gone.) I don't ever recall telling somebody to leave my raid because i couldn't stand them, i don't really recall many people i couldn't stand. I love this game, i love this server, and the people on it and you come at me because i default something on my raid?<br>Make sense or stop slamming my name please, i dont appreciate it. <p><IMG SRC=http://www.lochshea.com/sig/delt.jpg><center><a href=http://www.geocities.com/eqsoulsurvivors/Main.htm>Soul Survivors</a></center><center><a href=mailto:Deltanamos@msn.com><IMG SRC=http://www.localendar.com/clipart/holidays/stpats.gif></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/urukogdethbryngr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rukog DethBryngr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soul Survivor</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/15/02 10:58:39 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/eq/image.aspx?path=/CoachK69/fullsize%5cEQ/Troll1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Clearing thread from XA - No need to continue it there</span><hr size=1> Please.<br><br>Continue with the statements that have no bearing whatsoever on my argument.  I really enjoy listening to people bring up Vindicator and Seb frogs in relation to Hate.<br><br>/sarcasm off<br><br>Listen...I already stated above that this is probably one of those things that we have to just disagree on.  I was done with it there.<br><br>I only responded because my intelligence was insulted by the first comment about Vindi, and now this off-the-wall comment about Seb frogs...that have NO bearing on the actual situation.<br><br>Look...I would gladly pat you all on the back and bow before you as you apparently wish for me to do if the situations were even remotely similar.<br><br>If Fenren, a member of my guild who I felt obligated to &quot;go to the mat for&quot; to defend, like Burgh states he'd do for Delta, had been on a raid to Hate, and it ended, as it did last night, and some unassociated group came up and wanted to take Magi P'Tasa, I'd have NO beef with that.  Fenren would have had NO association whatsoever with them and if he'd expect to get something out of it, I'd be disappointed in HIM.  I wouldn't have an issue in the world with them 'stepping over' an XA raid as it was leaving to &quot;clean up the scraps&quot;...<br><br>THAT would equate to the two examples that were put forth before...and frankly, you must think I'm stupid to think I'd be swayed by arguments that those are similar to the situation last night.<br><br>They're not!<br><br>Delta, a leader of XA, an organization that was raiding Hate, was present.  His participation in XA and SS tied those two events together...thus SS coming up to Hate was an extension, through Delta's shared &quot;membership&quot;, of the XA raid.  Am I saying that they were &quot;the same&quot; raid?  NO.  But it's sure as hell not &quot;Some_random_Guild_03&quot; coming up to Hate to luckily find Magi P'Tasa up like your examples of Vindi and Seb frogs would allude to.<br><br>Delta WAS part of the force that had &quot;cleared the way&quot;...he was also part of the force assembled to take out P'Tasa after XA left.  They weren't totally separate.  Delta was there to know other mages from a raid he'd just seen end were needing the staff...I KNOW Fenren let the previous leader know via PM's that he was interested in rolling for the staff if the Magi were up.<br><br>I'm not doing this to run anybody into the ground...I'm simply voicing my concern, that you'll see through everything I stated today, that a leader of XA seemed to act in conflict with what I expected of them.<br><br>Am I happy for Delta that he got the staff he's been waiting for forever?  Yeah...I remember back last year when you advertised on XA about your Week Long Hate camps...that's a crappy long time to wait.<br><br>Does that mean he's been waiting any longer than the other mages who were present?  I don't know.  Is that the point?  My concern was the lack of thought given to the other guys who helped prior to this associated raid coming in.<br><br>The points you bring up Nos don't relate to the base issue.  Regardless of whether I was there, it's obvious that Delta didn't seem to care enough that the other mages had helped get to that point last night to offer them a fair roll.<br><br>If you want to start slinging &quot;I was there, you weren't&quot; comments, I'd like to know how many people were actually THERE when TMC got disbanded (hmm..probably NONE of you), yet you still had a good chuckle with your friends about &quot;all the exploits they did and how they got caught&quot;...hmm...this cuts both ways?<br><br>*sigh*  Guys...I didn't and don't want mud.  I just wanted to address the one simple issue and it seems it's not enough that I admitted earlier that it's a simple difference in opinions.<br><br>I will try to hold each of you to your own standards and not judge you all together.  I have no reason to feel ill-will towards anyone but those who speak ill-will to me.<br><br>May the water pass under the bridge and every stone return to it's original place.<br><br>I'm tired of discussing the issue.  You just seem to have a different opinion than me.  You know what?

Your total lack of leadership ability and conversational skills brought this topic to a level that is so twisted that it makes no sense to me anymore. I am angry than Fenren has made one reply out of the 200000 that there are. I am angry that you brought your lies to other forums and wrongfully scarred not only my reputation, but the reputation of XA, Tal, and my guild. It was you who did this, and it will be you who will recieve the blame. I don't like you, not in the least, because you lack the ability to research a topic you know nothing about.<br><br>I can't believe people are auctually buying this. Does the fact that me and Taleriana are related in rank in XA automatically spell conspiracy when her raid ends and mine takes over where hers couldn't? This makes no sense to me, both Tal and I are firm believers in keeping XA ethical. People of XA who arn't ethical and are as greedy as you say I am don't last long. They especially don't last as long as I have. <br>(Keep in mind I AM the longest lastng active XA member to date)<br><br>I work hard to help keep XA where it is, and before i continue on OUR problem I would like to clear something up.<br><br>Slyde, you are a liar, you did nothing for XA. Being guilded with DoKD when XA was formed does not mean you were a founder. You did not have access to leader forums, you did not have leader privelages and you did not write out our rules. You may have gone on a few XA raids back in the day, maybe even before my time, but a founder you were not.<br><br>As for the other people who claimed to have been in XA long ago. You speak so boldly of what you know not. <br>You read one post written by your Guildleader and all of a sudden your sooooooooo dissapointed in the way XA went once me and Tal took over.<br><br>To clarify, DoKD did precisly dick for this orginization after it went mainstream. Colu was the only one still checking forums once Goldenrod quit leading and only me and Bell were the ones leading. XA was a mess, it was unorganised, it had little skill, smaller numbers, and a horrible reputation. To top it all off our top leaders even stopped checking the forums. Me and Bell had no controll over what went on. Then Bell quit, it was just me. Taleriana came in and built the wonderful site you see before you today. Organised, precise, talented, large, and powerful. Since me and her were handed the torch XA went top notch, our raids increased over three fold, and they were more successful. <br><br>Where were you guys when XA was going down? Nowhere, you didn't do anything. While people like myself, Bellemarr, Taleriana, and Dupster were working our asses off to stay above water. You talk about the glory days of XA, I remember those, and they wern't too glorious. You didn't have anything to do with XA more than sign up for a few raids maybe 1-2 years ago and now your trying to tell me this isn't the XA you remember? You guys have been out of the circuit so long I'm suprised you know that XA stands for Xegony Alliance. You did nothing for this orginization, then you come back and tell us what we have going is shit. THIS angers me, Slyde isn't to blame for this, this is your own stupidity. That you have the sure arrogance to come back here and flame XA like this annoys me to the brink of insanity. Just stay gone, we don't need people like that with us. And NEVER EVER talk about things you wern't there to witness firsthand, including this raid. You guys can't even get the number of mages right, or the time we got to Sro either. The way you tell the story I feel guilty myself.<br><br><br>HKD members, sorry you had to hear it from the wrong guy. Our guild doesn't attack people. We dont go out of our way to interfere with raids, XA or otherwise. We especially don't do so in a case like this, where it would harm the reputation of XA and SS, the two groups I hold dear in EQ. We didn't plan on getting to hate that day, which is why it took us forever to get out of AC and get stones etc. I just got lucky, it happens, and I feel bad for Fen cause ive had the exact same situation happen to myself in the past... and it sucks.... hard. Which is why I can understand his anger, and his preliminary suspicions. After all, Me and Tal are Co admin... it makes sense we would be in tells. And since he missed tal telling raid and the casts were off, he didn't know untill I popped up. Which looks REALLY suspicious, but once things were explained to him, even he himself apolagised. Tal didn't end the raid early, she ended it on time. She wasn't aiming for magi, he was a perk. She didn't have a puller, we did. And since by some odd Coinkidink me and Tal arn't just Co Admin to eachother, we are friends, she let me know. I was able so I took advantage of the opportunity. We also gave XA a chance to get some more loots. Which, no offense, I've never heard of HKD doing. Then again HKD makes its members rely on XA to get thier epics, which I don't understand in the first place.<br><br>So in summary all, it was no odd coinkidink that I ended up in hate once tal called her raid. But she didn't do it for me, she just let me know once she was unable to move on, and I had the manpower to take him on, so I did. SS could have done it alone, but we were nice and let some XA come with. however this was OUR raid, so default went to guildie, me. 4 hours mean nothing, ive spent 8 hours in hate aiming at magi with no luck, but I didn't ask for a roll on staff from the next guild coming up. Even tho I cleared 1st floor. Because I have common sense. Not to mention the ability to understand that when I sign up for a raid, I do so knowing its intentions, and I dont get upset when my own plans conflict with the leaders.<br><br>Learn some respect, it's insulting to demand something you think you earned simply because you killed a few mobs leading up to it. I didn't plan it that way. Get over it. Yeah, good work on killing those mobs, sorry you didnt make it to magi. No you cant roll... your raid is done, you can stay for extra loot tho. Thats more than fair and generous. More than i know of HKD doing for anyone I know outside thier guild. <p><IMG SRC=http://www.lochshea.com/sig/delt.jpg><center><a href=http://www.geocities.com/eqsoulsurvivors/Main.htm>Soul Survivors</a></center><center><a href=mailto:Deltanamos@msn.com><IMG SRC=http://www.localendar.com/clipart/holidays/stpats.gif></a></center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/udeltanamossumnorxegony.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Deltanamos Sumnor Xegony</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.localendar.com/clipart/holidays/stpats.gif" BORDER=0> at: 8/16/02 6:22:15 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/udeltanamossumnorxegony.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Deltanamos Sumnor Xegony</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.localendar.com/clipart/holidays/stpats.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>has been slain by an orc pawn!</span><br>  Posts: 716<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/16/02 3:45:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Clearing thread from XA - No need to continue it there</span><hr size=1> oh and as a side note, really fucking mature slyde. <br>Please make sure to post your side of the story on every guild forum from here to timbuktu<br>fuck you, <br> <p><IMG SRC=http://www.lochshea.com/sig/delt.jpg><center><a href=http://www.geocities.com/eqsoulsurvivors/Main.htm>Soul Survivors</a></center><center><a href=mailto:Deltanamos@msn.com><IMG SRC=http://www.localendar.com/clipart/holidays/stpats.gif></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/uwhailor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Whailor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soul Survivor</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/16/02 4:09:37 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  .</span><hr size=1> XA raid was a scouting raid to get new new, upcoming XA Hate raid leader (Taleriana) accustomized with the zone, as well as new Hate puller (Nosferum) accustomized with pulls in Hate. And many to many others on that raid it was a learning experience. Raid had a set timeframe, and raid ended/started in the set time. ANY RAID THAT CAME AFTER THAT TIME WAS NO MORE XA RAID, OR RELATED TO XA, OR NEEDED THE XA TO CLEAR THE WAY. Anyone claiming otherwise is spewing out BS.<br><br>Soul Survivors did a GUILD RAID, to kill a mob and get an epic quest piece for their GUILD LEADER. In NO WAY should any guild on the server use XA rules on their raids, and they don't. Guilds have their own rules and if someone doesn't like these rules - they can hit the road.<br><br>XA channel in-game is open to anyone. Anyone participating in any XA event can (and as I see should even) log into that channel. Anything XA related is told in that channel. If someone for some reason is not in that channel and because of that misses the news passed on there - tough luck, your fault, move along.<br><br>HoK &quot;royal advisor&quot; comes here now too and tells the story with totally skewed facts, not knowing the amount of mages going up there, not knowing what happened and all that. Even when it was POINTED OUT FOR HIM that there were ONLY 3 mages at the platform, and that one of them left and only two remained - Meinadin and the HoK mage - he still claims that there were 4 mages who went up and that Deltanamos was one of them. Talk about misinformation! I'd never take ANY ADVICE from such an misinformed and ignorant advisor in my life. No wonder everyone else from HoK, who posted regarding this non-existing issue are so misinformed as well.<br><br>Also it seems that the HoK mage, who participated on the raid, is flat out lying. EVERYONE WILL SEE in Hate when that NPC is up. It spams the whole zone with it's spells. Everyone in XA raid saw it, when Soul Survivors ported up, they saw it immediately as well. And yet from all these umptenth people ONLY THE ONE MAGE fails to see that? Oh boy, talk about being blind. Or talk about flat out lying.<br><br>It also seems that HoK assumes that once the XA raid was over, XA should have prevented others for going to Hate. God forbid, there were people going 4-hours work and now no one else is allowed to go to Hate because of that, otherwise it's a &quot;fix&quot; and means that XA, along with Soul Survivors, tried to cheat every raid member and secretly snuck out the loot to pre-determined people. Or does HoK assume that XA raid should send a tell to them, telling that &quot;we're done here now, now here's up this rare mob we can't kill, you come here and kill it for your people&quot;. Heh.. Why do they assume that someone should contact them, them who have nothing ever contributed to XA, instead of those who continuously help and contribute with selfless goals, like Delta or Foote? If I would have been the leader of that raid and see a rare mob up, a mob what a person who has contributed a lot to the XA has been hunting for many months in a row, I would have contacted that person as well, and right away. I would have NEVER bothered myself with announcing this to those, who do nothing for the common endeavour, what they now try to bash. So yeah, I would have told to Deltanamos as well, and if he would have been unable, I would have told this to some other friend of mine. Never to HoK - I don't know them, they never did anything to ever help me. And if none of the people I know would have been able to go after that mob - I still wouldn't tell it to anyone else after that. I'd just leave the mob be there, and anyone who happens to go next up there can have it.<br><br>It is also funny how HoK claims that XA has been unfair, and gave no chance to roll for the item, while it wasn't an XA raid anymore. But of course the HoK tries still to insist that it was XA raid still. Pathetic. SS had no obligations whatsoever to accept anyone out of their guild on their raid, they didn't have to do it. Yet they did accept those who stayed back. In fact, it was even announced by Deltanamos that those who want, can stay behind and join them. Funny, everyone else on XA raid saw it, those who wanted joined with SS, Meinadin, a mage, as well, but the HoK mage GATES OUT and then starts to swear and curse and spew BS out in direct tells to Deltanamos. Talk about schmuk. The ones who remained got the loot as well. And SS got for what they came - the epic piece for THEIR guild member, on THEIR RAID. Funny is also that HoK itself has many times totally excluded the non-HoK members on their raids from even rolling on the loot, basically acting like an arse, and then they dare to say that others &quot;bend rules&quot; or are &quot;ungrateful&quot; or whatever? Seems that HoK sees a splinter in the butt of others, but totally ignores the HUGE FULL TREE in their butt.<br><br>Also it's funny how HoK calls others irresponsible, and then says itself that &quot;we're hunting in HoT (where most higher lvl guilds and alliances hunt anyway, heh) and killing mob X and Y and Z (what most of other higher level guilds and alliances kill too), so we're so important, but we have no time to take our guildies to Hate or Fear to get for them the epic pieces, these guildies have to find other means of getting the needed items&quot;. Huh? Did I miss something? They diss their own members and then dare to call others irresponsible? Oh ignorance, HoK is thy name.<br><br>Sorry that XA and Soul Survivors have to had to put up with such foolishness. The best thing is to simply ignore them, and let them ramble on in their dellusional world. XA, neither SS didn't do anything wrong, however HoK did and is wasting the board space and time of us all with their ramblings. As it is now, if any of my chars will do raids to anywhere, no HoK member will be accepted until they come down to earth from clouds, where they float now, because as it seems, they will try to twist every fact and truth, if they miss something what they want, but are too lazy to go and get themselves. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/udeltanamossumnorxegony.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Deltanamos Sumnor Xegony</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.localendar.com/clipart/holidays/stpats.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>has been slain by an orc pawn!</span><br>  Posts: 718<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/16/02 4:10:34 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: .</span><hr size=1> im not guild leader, slyde can go fuck himself to eternity. <br>Fen didnt send me obscene tells, he was just pissed, as i would have been in a similiar situation.<br><br>I like fen tho, and i feel for his plight.

Not only is his name getting thrown around here... And Having other people speak for him (Which as I understood, he didn't want to start anything to begin with and has appologized To Tal and Delt already) I'm pretty damn Sure Fenren is capable of speaking on his own. He doesn't need People Like Slyde Going around posting One side of the story, without even bothering to get the facts straight, To Not only XA. But to Clan Phoenix and Seekers of Lore as well. I'm surprized I haven't seen the post "Xegony Alliance Issue" anywhere else.. Maybe I'm just missing it. <br><br>Slyde should have gotten the CORRECT info as to what really happened and not the BS he decided to post all over the place. If this is how the Guildleader of House Kel`Dar is... I really feel sorry for you guys. I was also around back when DoK actually had an influence on XA. Slyde as a founding member? HA. Once XA got enough publicity Every single DoK member pretty Abandoned XA anyways. No leading raids, no participating in raids, and very few of them even read the XA boards after that. I know.. I WAS Around then. I can even remember a post on the XA forum which said something like "We're too busy with our own guild raids and don't have the time to lead XA raids" That post was from Colu.. and forgive me if some of the wording might not be 100% accurate... After all, It has been that long since a HKD member has influenced XA at all.<br><br>I had lost my respect for Dragons of Kel`Dar a while ago and those who had my respect, Lost it. Now I know there are probably some good people in HKD, Hell.. I know Esmos is a part of that guild. But, what is the point of this? Nothing can be done about it. Deltanamos, who has been my friend ever since about level 10. which was 2 years ago, Finally Got his Epic Hate staff.  If we we're to find out that the Magi was up. and Took longer in Acrylia than we did, Resulting in XA to leave Hate Completely. Then to go do it all on our own about an hour later.. Would you even be bitching right now? I believe we both know the answer to that one.. No you wouldn't. But, we found out He was up. and We we're in the middle of the High Priest Ring When Delt said in the channel that the Magi was up in Hate and he had the staff. XA was up there, we couldn't do anything about it. And we sure as hell didn't ask Tal to agro mobs from the 2nd floor, wiping out her own raid, just so she could call it and let us have the Magi.  The Magi was up and was casting and it was announced. Fenren managed to miss that, Tough luck for him. I'm sorry, but thats just the way it is. I do wish him luck on future XA Hate raids seeing how HKD is too high and mighty for Hate and to actually help one of their own get his epic piece rather than flaming those who did on 5 Different Forums. And Fenren.. When you win the staff in Hate for your epic... I'll be sure to congratulate you =)<br><br>Oh, And I AM the Guildleader of Soul Survivors. If you have a problem, Talk to me. I sure as hell was online last night when "We didn't have any officers" or whatever the hell was said.<br><br>If HKD wants to allow those who cleared 90% of the path to a demi in Hate or Fear, who do not have the power to kill that demi a chance to stay and roll on An Epic Piece that One of their members Deserves. Then you do that. Although I'm Absolutely positive that what you say you'd do and what actually would be done are two completely different things.<br><br>The Raid after Taleriana's was a Soul Survivor Raid. Why would we allow any mages other than the one in our guild to loot that staff? We sure as hell didn't need any outside help. Delt Rarely thinks about himself. It was not delt's responsibility to go around Talking to Fenren and Meinadin About the Magi. Did he screw them over? No. Its not his Fault the XA raid ended when it did. They could have avoided their last wipe and gotten the magi too. But, They didn't. Better Luck Next Time. We didn't Screw Fenren or Meinadin over. Yes they helped clear the way, But That is also something we could have done ourselves. Magi P`tasa was not a goal the XA raid was after. They just fell short of it, yes. But It was never a goal of the XA raid. So We took advantage of it, yes. But we didn't screw anyone over.<br><br>Oh and I guess since we rezzed a couple of Inner Circle Members in the Hole today that means we're in cahoots with them too.. seeing how we try to be Exactly like them and as we pulled an "inner Circle move" last night. They are our mentors after all. =P Its all a Big conspiracy! XA, SS, IC!. We have a plan to Rule the Xegony Server and to Screw Each and Everyone over!. You better watch out.. Our Plan has been revealed now! <p><P><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=147023>Foote Iceblade<BR>56th Level HUMAN Myrmidon</a><BR><BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=147102>Ivyfoote<BR>53rd Level HUMAN Pathfinder</a><BR><BR><a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/bpremierguildforum>Soul Survivors</a> of Xegony<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/ulillypaws.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lillypaws</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soul Survivor</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/16/02 7:22:00 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: .</span><hr size=1> First off congrats on your epic piece Delt.  Sorry that there is such a huge cloud surrounding such a great accomplishment.<br><br>I've read the thread here, the thread on XA boards and the thread on HKD boards.  The only reason I feel I should voice yet another opinion on this topic is because I am part of HKD.<br><br>Here is the main problem as I see it - HKD, XA leaders are all at fault in this mess.  Slyde should have gathered more information and taken this issue to a more private venue before opening it up to public shredding.  <br><br>XA leaders are at fault for miscommunication to the raid that was ending. (ie not everyone on the raid was in the XA chat and information was passed to there, not the raid channel.  A forgivable and very easy to make mistake.)  <br><br>Delt did recieve &quot;insider information&quot; and used that for his gain.  Is it right, is it wrong?  Well, if you took it to court and this were the financial world he'd be in a heap of trouble.  But this is EQ folks, kudos to him on being out there working hard to be privy to this information.  If I, or Rukog were in his shoes, we would never have asked for a default to ourselves.  Delt didn't have to open roll on it, that is a call only each individual could make.  In HKD we pride ourselves and reward selflessness, therefore it's hard for some of us to understand how anyone in that situation could seperate the end of an XA raid and a single guild coming in and allowing those raiders to attend without being allowed to roll on a hard to get epic piece.  Soul Survivors had no obligations to those raiders once they took over.<br><br>In all these threads there are only 2 side issues that I must debate.<br><br>****quote***I'm in full belief that if House Kel'Dar, or whatever their name is now, cared about their mage, they would have been there too had they known he was up; I would garner he would have told his guild he wanted this piece, and them knowing he was in hate, they might have had their ears pricked up to assist him or congrat him. I find it hard to believe that in all this time the Magi was up, this mage who was waiting and hoping and praying for him to spawn, and was on this raid to benefit himself in a way his guild would apparently not, had never once seen him cast a spell. The very minute I entered the plane and went to the camp spot I could see the Magi Casting.***end quote***<br><br>If you already had forces gathering as soon as everyone says here, HKD never would have considered going for Magi.   Are you suggesting that HKD should have tried to leapfrog your guild into Fear to get Magi for Fenren?  And if Fenren had asked, which he didn't, that would have been pointed out to him.  I think he knew better than to ask us to try to rush ahead of you all to get him the piece.  As for not noticing him up, well I have npc spells off if I'm on any character other than my enchanter.<br><br>The other side topic I want to point out is to Strad or however you spell his name.  That vox or naggy raid, shesh get over it already.  Those 55+ players were there the whole raid, buffed the 55- characters and helped them to get the dragon.  They were there for teleports, tps, rezes and buffs after the raid.  The exception of them being in on the lottos was announced and agreed on by all.  They did just as much work to get to the mob and make killing the mob a success as did the -55 players.  Yes, I was there.<br><br>Last but not least, I have learned one thing in this whole mess....  I like Ketal!!!  She's just the bees knees!<br><br>My opinions are my own, this will be my only post, I will not debate this topic.  I believe we should all agree to disagree and move on.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/unosferum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nosferum</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soul Survivor</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/16/02 9:39:05 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.premiernet.net/~chandler/images/baldnos.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: .</span><hr size=1> ---Ruk, it has become overly clear to me that you have no intent to understand anyone but your own prejudgement based on assumption.
