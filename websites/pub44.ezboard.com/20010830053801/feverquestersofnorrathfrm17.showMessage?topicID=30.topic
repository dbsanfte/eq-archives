Life very seldom works out the way we think it will when we are young, as Galadria discovered with the turning of the seasons. She knew so little of love, or of loneliness, when in her teens she vowed forever to wait for her ranger, that she did not suspect that things might change and that her vow would become impossible to keep. Think not that she never loved him, for she did and does and will until the end of days. He was her idol, his kindness and his generosity the model for her own; he was and is a true hero of Norrath, a force for good. Alas that fate stepped in between them, and time, as it often does.<br>
<br>
In the early days of fighting in Greater Faydark and in Crushbone, Galadria made many friends, some of whom became quite dear to her, although because of her vow, she was reluctant to admit that she might love them. When she turned 15 seasons, she was taken by her sister Raynn to Highpass Hold and left there alone to fight the gnolls and orcs with other teens, an important part of their training. Grouped as she was with so many others, she made many new friends, and again several became very dear to her. As the seasons swept by, a few of these began to make it plain they loved her, and she was sorely troubled for she wished to hurt none of them, and fell back upon her vow as an excuse to avoid permanent entanglement. Alas again that one of them in his persistent devotion broke through her barriers and woke passion. She was swept off her feet and to the brink of engagement before it became clear to the two of them that the match was wrong and would not work out that way. They had a child, Tuilere, born of their love, as sometimes happens. She was not enough to hold them together. Both took much hurt from the relationship and it took many more seasons for the wounds to heal and for them to become friends again, during which time Galadria turned once more to her ranger for comfort and thought perhaps the time had come to marry him. He saw more clearly than she did the faults in her reasoning, and feared that he could not give her all that she needed to keep her happy.  Perhaps proving his love for her in fact the greater, he declined her hasty proposal and gently released her from her impuslive youthful vow.<br>
<br>
Alas, alas, poor Galadria! She cannot help but love and be loved in return, but can anyone on the face of Norrath win her for his own? Perhaps. Of late she has been seen much in the company of a certain druid, known too for his kindness and generosity in helping even total strangers. He makes her laugh, and banishes the shadows. Only time will tell...<br>
<br>
There remains her daughter, Tuilere, whose name means &quot;spring.&quot; She has of course chosen to train as a ranger, following in the footsteps of her mother and grandmother before her. Precociously she went out on her own quite early to combat the evil foes on the doorstep of Kelethin and near Felwithe, and proved herself so valiant a champion of good that her mother could not object to her vow of service to Tunare. And so Galadria made known to a handful of her guildmates and friends the existence of her child, and sent them to her to advance her training in the arts of battle. They have overseen her progress in the dreaded depths of Crushbone since her fourth season, and have watched her skill grow swiftly, initiating her the brotherhood of Victus Fortis to her great joy soon after. Tuilere yearns to fight with her aunt Raynn and with others of her friends and guildmates as soon as she reaches a suitable level, which promises to be quite soon. As for &quot;entanglements,&quot; however, with male suitors - Galadria will permit as many friends as her child possibly can make, but be forewarned that like any other &quot;she-lion&quot; with her cub, the teeth and claws may very well come out if Galadria feels her daughter is the object of any man's too devoted attention!<br>

<br>
&quot;Hail, my kinsman,&quot; it began. &quot;Know that I am ever watching out for you. Saddly, my time has been most recently spent with one that I cherish above all others, barring Tunare Herself. This ranger has stepped into my life and made it whole. But I degress. I have spent these last few days guiding her daughter, Tuilere, in what is every wood elfs dream of riding our land or those hated Orcs. Watching her grow, I am reminded of her mother more and more...she is in my thoughts always....&quot;<br>
<br>
The letter goes on in length to tell about his hopes for the future....I will not read further....I am overjoyed to hear that his heart is whole once more...reading his journal, I am beginning to get an idea of his pain....but anyways....welcome Tuilere, into what is to be your new home. We all welcome you!!<br>
