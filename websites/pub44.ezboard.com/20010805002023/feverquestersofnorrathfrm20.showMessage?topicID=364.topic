Thought it might be worthwhile to share some info I found on posts regarding the topic.

Here's a couple posts I found at the Ranger's Glade:<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Hail Fellow Rangers of Norrath! I am a new member of your circle here and would like to say, &quot;Thank you!&quot; for all the information I've gathered as a lurker in the past. <br>
<br>
I have recently attained my 40th Season with my first-ever EQ character (Yay!), which I started on Vazaelle this past January. Through several boards I've seen numerous statements about raids gone bad, and LOTS of flaming over raid issues. Now that I am finally getting close to a raid-viable level, I would like some advice on what I should do, and what I should expect, out of my raid experience (aside from horrible deaths and CR!) <br>
<br>
If anyone knows of a good online raid guide I would apprecieate the tip. Also, if any of you are in UBER guilds on Vazaelle, do you have have raid-training exercises for smaller guilds and newer players? I am an officer of my guild, and would love to learn, and teach, our members how to successfully raid. <br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for any help you can offer!<br>
<br>

-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Here is a set or rules that was published on our server board that have been considered pretty reasonable: <br>
<br>
1. Expect to die. Raids are dangerous, and it is not unusual for someone to die 7 or 8 times in a successful raid. If the raid leaders are good, you will be rezzed, and this will not be a major problem. <br>
<br>
2. Expect to lose experience. Raids are not about gaining experience. They are about adventure and loot. If there are six groups in a raid, only one group will get any experience, and that experience may be outweighed by the experience loss from deaths. <br>
<br>
3. Expect to spend a lot of time doing nothing. Organizing a raid takes a lot of work, and you may sit around for hours while nothing happens, or while you are waiting for a rez. This is normal. Be patient. <br>
<br>
4. Do what you're told. The raid leaders don't have time to explain everything to every member of the raid, and they don't have time to debate tactics. Raids are not democratic. If the raid leader says, &quot;Go run up to Innoruuk and /rude him,&quot; just go do it. If you don't have faith in the raid leaders, you shouldn't be there. <br>
<br>
5. Shut up. In a large raid, things are chaotic. When people spam the zone in shout or ooc mode, it makes everything more difficult. Raids are not the time to show people how smart or funny you are. If you have questions or comments, use group mode or send a tell to a raid leader. <br>
<br>
6. Let the raid leaders deal with loot. Unless someone tells you to loot something, keep your hands off. <br>
<br>
7. Be prepared for a BIG time commitment. You can't expect to go to the Plane of Hate for two hours. If you don't have time to go on the raid, don't go at all. <br>
<br>
8. Assume that everything will take twice as long as it ought to. That may be conservative. <br>
<br>
9. Maintain a positive attitude, at least outwardly. No one wants to hear you whining or complaining or sniping at people. Everyone respects someone who maintains a &quot;can do&quot; attitude and who stays calm and rational even under bad circumstances. <br>
<br>
10. Pay attention. You'd be amazed how often people don't follow instructions. The raid leader will say &quot;No necromancer pets,&quot; and the necro will summon one anyway. Why does this happen? Because people aren't paying close attention to what is going on. They may be chatting in tells or in guild chat. I often turn off guild chat during raids, or at least ignore it unless someone says something directly to me. If someone sends me a tell, I may reply &quot;Not now&quot; or &quot;Let's talk later on, I'm on a raid.&quot; <br>
<br>
11. Don't be afraid to take a death for the good of the raid. There will be times when you are in imminent danger of death, but the only way you can save yourself will put the entire raid at risk. You have to control your impulse to run to safety, and just take the death. <br>
<br>
12. Prepare in advance so that you don't have to go AFK very often. Have your food and drink lined up. Take the dog for a walk. Finish your laundry. You just can't expect to go AFK very often on a raid. It is unreasonable to expect 40 people to wait around while you feed your cats. Make arrangements in advance whenever possible. (Yes, it is acceptable to take a bathroom break or to deal with a household emergency.) <br>
<br>

------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Keda has covered most of it. Those are the rules that most raids run by. I have just a little more to add though. <br>
<br>
For low level raids such as a lvl 40s 12 men thing, You can go to a few places that will actually prepare you for full plannar raids later on. <br>
<br>
Mock Fear: <br>
Trak's Teeth. I am surprised that no one suggest doing &quot;trail runs&quot; in Tracks teeth just to get a feel as to how a raid in Fear would be like. Of course it'll be scaled down but at lvl 40, TT can give you an indication of what's its going to be like. Lots of adds, aggros from all over and high lvl mobs that are about the same as those found in the planes. Built your &quot;co-ordination&quot; or raid awareness here. Its a good place to get xp, and good loot too. (go do the Forager Cycle) <br>
<br>
As for Hate, well.., I'd say invade Neriak but don't think your DE guildmates will like that too much. *grins* <br>
However, a Hole raid would be good. Thing is, at lvl 40+ ...the depeer mobs might be a tad too difficult for you guys. Though its another good place to learn how to co-ordinate a raid in an &quot;indoor&quot; enviroment (also has relatively good loot too for everyone ;IGS!!) <br>
<br>
There are dark sides to any raid of course, and that's when you need to keep and eye out. <br>
As an officer in my guild, I actually pay REALLY close attention during raids...for one thing, its when you can pin point the loot whores, the ones who don't show up for any other raid exept when they have something to gain or those who simply are detrimental to the guild. No one like whiners or those who creates dissent in the guild. A raid gone bad would be the best time to see just who are the ones working thier butts off to help thier friends and the ones freeloading. <br>
<br>
Last suggestions: <br>
ALWAYS have at least 2 backup raids planned incase the one you want is : <br>
1) taken by someone else, <br>
2) your key players aren't around / not enough of them. <br>
3) make sure everyone can get OUT of the raid area via ports / gates / potions / translocate. <br>
4)Make sure that how loot is going to be distributed and who will be calling the shots be made known in advance. Those who don't like and expect to roll for everything can take their sorry asre out the area.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
- Never, under any circumstansis, argue with the raid leader. The last thing they need is for you to cause a distraction. If you disagree with their raid makeup and strategy, leave during the briefing! or shut up and do as you're told. <br>
<br>
- Raids are more akin to military assualts than anything else but they are NOT a social ocassion. Have fun but stay focused!. <br>
<br>
- I can't stress this enough: KEEP YOUR COOL AT ALL TIMES. You may die if you keep your cool but you will certainly die if you panic -- and take a lot of folks with you. <br>
<br>
- Expect to die. <br>
<br>
- Expect to be told to do something that will mean your certain death. <br>
<br>
- Do NOT expect a rez. Ever. <br>
<br>
- Do NOT complain, grouse, or bitch. Period. If it takes 6hrs to get you rezed, deal with it. If you missed a roll on something for some reason, deal with it. Items are items they drop off mobs, friends don't and factions can't always be repaired. <br>
<br>
- LISTEN TO THE BRIEFING. If you have any questions in your mind about the assualt plan, the strategy used, the people assigned, etc, work them out or leave. Once the raid starts, shut the HELL up and deal with whatever happens, good or bad. The raid leader and management deserve your respect and 110% support once the raid begins. <br>
<br>
- Mistakes happen, we all make them. Never, ever, E V E R berate someone for making a mistake. It happens. Sometimes it causes wipeouts. They already feel bad and they dont' need your grief. <br>
<br>
- Listen to the minor stuff. Never let an order be issued twice because of YOU. &quot;Hug this wall&quot; isn't that hard to understand. <br>
<br>
- Raids are stressful, lighten the mood if you can. Last raid I didn't have an enchanter in my group (and everyone and his brother was asking for Clarity and even if it's your job after a few hours it can start to get on your nerves) so every time I had to ask I'd offer to preen his coat (he was in werewolf form), trading foraged grubs for clarity, oh most exaulted one I humbly beg for that most precious substance once again if you can perchance find your way clear to honor me for one brief moment, cough it up or I puke on your shoes, etc. <br>
<br>
- Everyone has bad days when nothing works, even gravity. Get over it. <br>
<br>
For as draconian as all that sounds, raids are fun if you keep your head, keep perspective, stay patient, follow instructions, and act like a mature adult. Even bad raids can be fun and challanging if you are focused on the journey and not on the loot.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Werzat's right, you should not &quot;expect&quot; an experience rez. Werzat's wrong, that rez should be lined up and ready to go, or the raid leader has failed a basic requirement. <br>
<br>
Both positions have a valid aspect. When you go on a raid, you should be able to rely on the leader to have adequate resources lined up to provide people with experience rezzes. At the same time, you should not take it for granted, and you should not &quot;expect&quot; that rez. <br>
<br>
Personally, I have some real problems keeping my happy face on while things are going to hell in a hand basket. I agree completely that you don't argue with the RL and you don't go along on the raid if the briefing includes things you find unacceptable. But when the &quot;briefing&quot; comes along somewhere well into the raid... grrr.. it's not exactly fair of a RL to not mention the rules until after people are physically committed, and it's kind of hard to get the rules out of a reluctant RL without it coming off like arguing. <br>
<br>
I've been on a raid where the CR was so long and slow that by the time they got my corpse, it was too old for an experience resurrection. That was an aggravating and frustrating experience, because I was kept uninformed about what was happening and was not in a position to do anything except sit and wait and stew. Things can, do and will turn out badly sometimes, and despite the best intentions and reasonable preparations, a raider may find that there is no exp. rez. Unfortunate, but a risk in the game. <br>
<br>
It's been said again and again before, but cannot be overemphasized - <br>
listen to the Raid Leader's instructions and follow them to the letter. [ If you know the zone inside out and the RL just said &quot;hug the right wall&quot; and you know (and know the RL knows even) that it has to be the LEFT wall, send a tell letting them know they oopsed. But Do Not make that announcement/correction for them in shout or ooc.. it will only confuse things.] <br>
Pay attention.. you can't follow instructions if you aren't paying attention, you can't catch a correction if you aren't paying attention, etc. etc. etc. <br>
<br>
Something that wasn't mentioned... if you are going on a raid, be prepared, do your homework. Be On Time for the raid... that means being at the announced starting point before the announced starting time if humanly possible. It means having a key for the zone if one is needed. It means having appropriate resistance gear. It means having the tooth to port to Cobalt Scar if you're going to Western Wastes. It means having the zone loaded on your machine if you're going to The Hole. <br>
<br>
And yes, I've sat and waited for people joining raids in The Hole who turned out not to have it loaded. I've sat and waited for people going on raids in WW who could not be ported into Cobalt Scar. I even know of a person who signed up for a Hate Raid and had a hissy fit about being deliberately left behind at the wizard platform.. when they were level 45... <br>
<br>
<br>
So.. be considerate and cooperative and follow instructions. That pretty well covers it, but it's amazing how hard people find it to do these simple things.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
All of the suggestions up top are great. I would just like to add some more. <br>
<br>
1) Always keep your cool - it really is surprising what can be pulled off if people don't panic. Having 5-8 mobs in camp with the enchanter out of mana, the cleric with 20% left. It tests everyone and they seem to fight at their best. Like I said - very fun =) <br>
<br>
2) Unless something is stated otherwise - mash that Assist key. Nothing will piss off an enchanter faster and make the entire raid proceed slower. <br>
<br>
3) Always respect the chain of command. I don't know how your guild is setup - but on raids I lead I want absolute authority. I do not want tells telling me what I should be doing. A good leader has already done his homework and knows what to do. <br>
<br>
4) Loot plan needs to be discussed prior to going. Discuss as it drops gets messy and slows down things. <br>
<br>
5) Just have fun - and make sure the people there are at least trying to have fun. Some raids are very boring, but are necessary to do. Remember to try to balance experience no matter if people say they are not interested in experience - because they really are. <br>
<br>
CoM is a very good starter guild raid. It is fairly easy to do corpse recovery. For good execution runs, I suggest the Hole. It has a fairly fast repop - fairly low level mobs and requires some homework. It is also the easiest zone to do corpse recovery in. <br>
<br>
Enjoy. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Here are some rules for raids, if you are not the leader: <br>
<br>
1. Show up, on time, prepared (equipment, maps, resist gear, potions, gems for symbols, fish scales, coffins, etc)). <br>
2. Join the group you are assigned. <br>
3. Be helpful: Buff others (but ask them first). <br>
4. Follow instructions. <br>
5. DO NOT EXPLORE or wander. Stay with the group or in your assigned place. <br>
6. Before raid starts, determine the following and make hotkeys: <br>
- primary assist hotkey <br>
- secondary assist hotkey <br>
- &quot;add&quot; assist hotkey <br>
- special raid hotkeys (&quot;Assist Locz on %t&quot;, &quot;Snared %t&quot;, &quot;Peeling %t&quot;, &quot;Parking %t, back off!&quot;, &quot;Incoming %t&quot;, &quot;%t has been slowed&quot;, &quot;Kiting %t&quot;, etc). <br>
- determine the raid-only channel for instructions <br>
- determine the &quot;chat&quot; channel <br>
- name of loot leader <br>
- name of enchanter giving haste <br>
- name of enchanter giving clarity <br>
- name of persons giving focus / DMF / aegiolism / etc <br>
7. get buffed in the proper buff order (junk and lesser buffs first) <br>
8. LISTEN to instructions. <br>
19. FOLLOW instructions. <br>
10. Don't harass the raid leader / puller / peeler / assist people with tells. They are too busy. <br>
11. Don't whine about experience. The purpose of a raid is not experience (thats a &quot;grind&quot; group). Groups are specifically arranged to maximize kill effectiveness, not for divvying up experience evenly. <br>
12. Don't loot unless told to. <br>
13. When fighting: <br>
- follow instructions. <br>
- always assist. Never attack unless you assist. (take personal initiative only when assists have died and announce to others your action using a hotkey / you are told otherwise / dire circumstances require it). <br>
- don't sit just before the pull (MOB may aggro you). <br>
- turn off auto-attack if the MOB enrages. (enrage = autoriposte) <br>
- usually best to keep the chanter's alive (it is OK to emergency heal them) <br>
- learn to &quot;push&quot; caster/healer MOBs so that their casting gets interrupted. This means all tanks but rogues fight on the same side and vector, pushing the MOB backwards, and switch sides as told by the main assist. This technique also makes the raid rogues far more effective. <br>
- avoid aggroing secondary MOBs into the fight. <br>
- only the raid leader calls for &quot;clerics camp&quot; if a wipeout seems possible. <br>
- announce specifically important events: key LDs, key deaths, MOB AE cast times, snare in, emergency heal needs (if your clerics are dead). <br>
- casters only nuke within aggro radius, and after the tanks have secured aggro, to avoid &quot;ping ponging&quot; <br>
- don't push the MOB through a wall, or off a bridge, etc. <br>
14. Group leaders announce mana level /preparedness after the fight. <br>
15. NEVER, EVER, train the camp. Die instead. <br>
<br>
Hope this summarizes well. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Ok, Vlieke here again.  I hope that info was helpful and thought-provoking.  As you can see, some groups take a rather militaristic approach to raids, I suppose with good reason.  I don't think such a hard-ass approach is inherently necessary, but GOOD ORGANIZATION and PREPARATION is.  I would think that pre-raid briefs will be necessary, as well as post-raid debriefs.  Sure, they might be boring, but they are a great tool for learning and refining.<br>
<br>
For the most part, we've all been either soloing or fighting in smaller (6 or less) guild groups for the duration of our characters' existence(s).  Fairly soon this will change, and I have no doubt it will be enjoyable for VF, and our guild will begin to prosper and solidify even more.<br>
<br>
Please share your thoughts here.  I know Raloth, the High Council and other Officers and members of the guild are interested in getting our raid thang going.  <br>
<br>
P.S.S.  If we need raid leaders, I humbly volunteer.<br>
<br>
V.V.<br>

Indeed they do have a militaristic approach.  From my very small xp of getting groups wiped out I have decided that you have to be very decided, and kind of give orders - until the routine is started.<br>

Demi-god named Terror did HUGE AoE spell for 500 a pop!! Killed casters like QUICK if their resist gear was lacking..even in the back of our huge group of ppl, they died fast. In the last Fear raid I was in, I died 4 times, though was rez'ed on all, but lost about an orange total..rez doesn't bring back ALL your exp lost. No one ran, no one paniced..was kinda nice....now, let's see... <br>

...otay...i can't.. but will email it to Raloth so HE can =) hehe..hopefully, he can post it here in this one or a new post....anyways, i'm all for a raid anywhere =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/ulunitune.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lunitune</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.fbe.unsw.edu.au/staff/graham.hannah/eq/resources/lunitune60x60.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 351<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/10/01 5:35:02 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.fbe.unsw.edu.au/staff/graham.hannah/eq/resources/lunitune60x60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raids</span><hr size=1> Is peeling where you take one mob away from a group, say to fight it seperately?

In the meantime, if any member would like to organize a raid, as othres have done before, feel free to use the &quot;Gatherings of the Brave&quot; forum to do so.  Of course, try to give some heads up, like a week in advance so that people can get their characters there.<br>
<br>
We are considering a guild raid event timeline that will give us all a stable schedule to work around, and as soon as this is decided I will post the information.  Of course, any raids on top of the guild-wide raid are always welcome, even if there is a sanctioned raid schedule.  The more the merrier.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

That is a bad scene! <br>
I thought I would add my input too. More to the point, I want to add where I stand. <br>
I will do my part in a raid, as long as it is not a leader. I don't do well in that position. I am an advisor and a hybrid tank (make of that last one what you will, some don't like hybrids I have found out.) But if asked to lead I will turn it down. I'm not trying to be stubborn or mean, I just know my limits. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  If you want my opinion on something I can give tactical advice on what I see or understand and I am great with layouts if I have a mental picture of what a scene may be. Use me how you will. I am there for the guild. )<br>
One side note. I have observed over the course of my 26 lvls that in groups I am either the first one to die or the very last, and that is not an over statement. I assume the quick deaths are do to my vicinity and how healthy I am. The last to die I attribute to my agility. With all gear and buffs I am between 130 to 135. And I think I get hit about one out of ever 6 or 7 times. And take severe damage about one out of every five of those hits. Magic is another issue however. ( I go down like a newbie, maybe not that fast but quick enough.<br>
That is my input so everyone knows. I will be more than willing to join a raid if given enough time to adjust my schedule. I think it will be fun!<br>

<br>
Would follow you into any raid, once I get that far.<br>
<br>
Elia's input is great, and as a similar hybrid I tend to agree on all points.<br>
<br>
In all things I tend to be a doer, not a strategist (Tassius has that kinda mind).<br>
<br>
Give me a task to achieve, and it will be done. Simply and without fuss.<br>
<br>
So, lvl 30 will be mine this weekend, At whatever time is relevant, raids and me would seem to fit.<br>

<br>
Anyways, as only one of the guild founders I would like to make my beliefs heard.  I wish for ANY class members to be on ANY raid with me.  Be it when we are doing sleepers or CB.  This is about us all having fun at the end of the day (and a little loot).  I would hope that most people in the guild feel this way <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   and therefore hope that all of you hybrids (and myself) will feel needed and welcome on ALL of our raids. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/usemdayen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Semdayen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 145<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/16/01 7:08:30 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raids</span><hr size=1> Here Here Lunitune!<br>
