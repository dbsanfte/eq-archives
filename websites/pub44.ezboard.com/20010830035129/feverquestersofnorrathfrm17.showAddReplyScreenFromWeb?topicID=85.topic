blad hummed in the snow. Begging to be let loose. It could smell undead.<br>
<br>
'No Ghoulbane,' smiled Tassius. 'Not today.'<br>
<br>
Tassisus watched across the steppe as a desperate, skeletal, undead soul wandered here and there. Its red eyes seeking the life and blood of others. Mercy would not be one of its founding principles if it found someone weak. Ghoulbane cursed its master's weakness and settled back in its sheath.<br>
<br>
The snow whipped across the plains. Icy winds tore at Tassius's ears. Everfrost was an unforgiving host. Short on courtesy. <br>
<br>
In his mind Tassius could hear his friend, Jeldar the Shaman speaking with him and Semdayen. They were all hunting the great prize of the plains. The mammoth.<br>
<br>
A beast the size of a building. With great goring tusks that could skewer a man like a steak on a stick. Matted hair covered its body. and the stench. Oh my god. It was like a walking pig farm. <br>
<br>
But the rewards were be deeply appreciated. Tassius's sword skills had been sharpened considerably by his exploits out here in the snow. And the tusks themselves fetched a pretty penny to those who were strong enough to carry them back to Halas. <br>
<br>
Tassius narrowed his eyes and look out through the snow. He strained his ears for the familiar sound in the distance. The footsteps like an earthquake. You often heard them before you saw them. Many a time he had used his ears to direct him to the beast. <br>
<br>
However sometimes this did not pay off. The Ice Giants, a fearsome adversary who would love to use Tass as a toothpick, had a very similiar footstep. On more than one occasion Tass had come bounding over a snow dune to find the grinning mania of a giant where a hairy mammoth should have been.<br>
<br>
Jeldar was telling them that other big game groups were arriving. We was worried we would lose our catch. Tassius began to narrow his thoughts in response when Sem beat him to it.<br>
<br>
'They are fools Jel. They sit by that platform and wait for the game. They will catch none. It is only by seeking the prey that you find it here.'<br>
<br>
Too true. Mammoth hunts were an exercise in co-ordinated catching, running and meeting. You split up. You find one. You hack at it to antagonise it and then run to a pre-agreed point for battle.<br>
<br>
There was nothing like the feel of a tusk on your arse to encourage you to take those longer strides through the snow. To know that behind you was something akin to a town hall covered in hair wishing to make a kebab out of you was very, very compelling.<br>
<br>
Tassius laughed to himself and tenderly pressed on some of the more recent scars in his back and rear. Oh yes. It was a very motivating experience. The pain brought him back to the now. He resumed his search.<br>
<br>
Tassius took a couple of strides forward and slide down a snowy bank onto the icy river. He edged across it uneasily. It would be difficult to run on this but he knew it was a favourite place for the beasts to emerge.<br>
<br>
And then he heard it...boom, boom, boom. The footsteps. He checked the sound. To his right. He swung round and spied it. A great mammoth. A smile came to Tassius's face and he charged.<br>
<br>
He was about fifteen yards from it when he began to sense there was something wrong. Something different about this mammoth. No matter. Tusk was tusk. He ploughed on. <br>
<br>
Tassius struck hard on the beast leg with his blade. The mammoth rounded and roared. A roar like no other like 100 trumpets at half speed and double the volume. It was then that Tass saw its eyes. It was insane. Spittle hung in great wads from its mouth. Its bulbous, yellow eyes rolled in its head as it struggled to pick Tassius out beneath.<br>
<br>
Tassius stumbled backwards and fell on his shield arm.<br>
<br>
'Lads. I think I have chanced upon the infamous tainted mammoth' screamed Tassius as he kicked himself backwards from under the mammoths diving tusks.<br>
<br>
'Great.' replied Sem, 'Bring it on.'<br>
'On my way.' said Jeldar ever calm.<br>
<br>
Tassisus's reply was lost as he was up-ended by the mammoth from the river to the bank. He was winded but not stupid. He was up and running in seconds. Sprinting back to the meeting point with the boom, boom, boom ringing in his ears.... <p>Tassius Vindenervis.<BR>

I've been to that river and seen those nasty tainted beasts! Believe me, if Tass was booted by the mammoth from the riverbed to the shore, he was at least saved the long and slippery icepath he'd have had to try and run to reach it! Nothing like a jump-start! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
'Here be Mammoths'<br>
<br>
Jeldar and I are akin, him an embodied spirit of the power of nature, earth magic and animal instincts. Me the physical representation.<br>
<br>
The hunt is wild, it cannot be tamed, it must evolve naturally to be one with Tunare's children. Tassius, proud and from the land of men understands this well, but never so well as I or Jeldar.<br>
<br>
We must seek the prey, hurd it to us, deliver it to a stand point to our advantage. We fight on their home land, in their environment, we must force them to adapt to us, not the other way around.<br>
<br>
We must bring the fight to them, and so it is with The Tainted ones. They more so are Wild, truly a child of Tunare. Beauty and the beast encampassed in one, Tassius' shout tinged with excitement is my call. Excitement at striving with Nature, the thrill of the Hunt, masters of our destiny we pit our arms and skills against the raw force of nature, to succeed or die is of no consequence.<br>
<br>
Jeldar has made his peace, his totem animal guiding his steps, fleet of foot and strong of shoulder. I ranging far into the icy wastes to track our prey and Tassius, dear Tassius, passion and strength incarnate more like nature than he would care to admit, more like the animal of his hunt. Wild and proud, Chaos constricted by Order. What else can Paladin be, Warrior Priest, Death with a Shroud, Divine Retribution.<br>
<br>
Strangely the Heart calms as The tainted one is drawn to us, Tassius linked with us, calmed by Jeldar. Mammalian reflexes kick in as I ease my self into a fast pace lope akin to my Wolf brothers to join with my Hunt brethren.<br>
<br>
The stench is foul, I can barely make out the spore of Tassius as I crest a glacier ridge and look upon the site below. Jeldar chanting in cross legged position, Tassius feet set wide apart, long two Handed blade now replaced his customeray single handed Ghoulbane. The tip of the sword placed into the snow at his feet, A Steel cross of Blade, guard and Hilt. Face set and shoulders back. The picture of Faith.<br>
<br>
Charging and snorting the beast came on, dank sweat marring it's russet coloured flanks, froth spraying into the air as it lifted its long muscular trunk and declared its own battle cry.<br>
<br>
Tass and I shared a mind touch he senced my Calm, my almost non-existant pulse beat. I shared with him again my joy and pride at our awareness of each other. He shared with me his passion and courage. We cast this into the teeth of Nature, at the feet of Tunare, onto the tusks of the Tainted one.<br>
<br>
Instinct is my guide in all things, and even as the tainted one screamed as my claws dug into it's side, and the warmth of its entrails made a mist of the snow, I could sence a danger here, a presence more vile than this tainted beast. Even as Tassius grinned up at me as he lopped of one tusk then another as our trophies, Jeldar and I both came on guard, the first time Jeldar had moved and quietly he whispered.<br>
'The Corrupted one comes, stand ready. I shall be your protector in this'<br>
<br>
The Hunt is wild, we who hunt must be wild too - it is our nature.<br>
