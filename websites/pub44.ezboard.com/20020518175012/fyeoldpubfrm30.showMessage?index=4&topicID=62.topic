I understand that he may be a friend of yours, he may be a great guy.  But would you please ask him to drop this as I have been trying to do. It has been over 2 weeks I'm thinking since the &quot;event&quot;, and I have made multiple attempts to mend wounds and rebuild burnt bridges. Plz tell Gwaeron Windstrom, that if he has a problem with me, we can settly our differences in game, and not to slander me on the brell boards.

<br>
First I would like to point out that contacting a leader even if it is about a leader is never foolish.  Shortly after I was contacted Roren left and the situation ended, or so I thought.  All I knew at that time was that he had not been invited to attend a raid and was being an ass.  While I myself am not a person that is quick to use profanity or show anger, I have seen many in this game do so.  It is stupid when someone goes on acting like roren did that night, and there is no excuse for it.  But I am sure you have had members of your guild also behave in a less than exemplary way before, and I am sure it sucked for you that they dragged your guild tag and all of your reputations through the mud.  So I ask you to ask yourself, was this really an example of our whole guild, or was it the actions of one wayward individual?<br>
<br>
It is true I guess that roren is an officer.  I honestly was not aware he was since I have only been the guild leader for a year.  The past guild leader was fond of handing out officer ships and tracking everyone down to remove it is a pain and micromanagement I would rather not have to perform.  <br>
<br>
I usually prefer not to punish or remove individuals from the guild, because I have come to realize that in most cases the people a member has sinned against will usually effectively punish them enough.  I believe in this case you have punished Roren enough for me to feel he now understands how stupid he really was that night.  And so there is no need for me to punish him more, though I may track him down and remove the officer status from him if I can figure out how.  That is not to say that if you feel he hasn’t been punished enough you shouldn’t go on doing it.  But again I have to ask you to put yourselves in his shoes and ask yourself if you have ever done anything really incredibly dumb that you regretted the next day.  <br>
<br>
It is true I was asked to go to someone after the raid, but at that time I didn’t realize the situation was so bad and so I figured it was best just to drop it and move on with my enjoyment of EQ.  It is after all a game that is meant to be enjoyed, and usually being the leader of a relatively large guild like warders has a way of interfering with that and so I choose to enjoy as much as I possibly can.  <br>
<br>
Summary:<br>
What roren did was bad, and I think he gets that now.  Since Roren was the only member of warders involved it is somewhat unfair to hold the rest of us accountable.  If anyone wants to discuss this with me further, seek me in game I am usually playing as aerch or creh these days.<br>

<br>
This is wyldbuffalo, Leader of Lords of Ale and the &quot;twink worthless monk&quot; he was so adament about yelling at.  I dont hold warders responsible and i made sure nobody else has...i have stated it before, you have a descent guild, but i also stated that what roren did no justice to you guys...now i know and i have talked it over, your guild is always welcome to our events...but LoA standards, roren made our black list...it takes a LOT of work to get off of that list...rest of Warders is welcome to our events.<br>
<br>
As for punishing him...i agree, this has been drug out pretty long, you are correct roren...but Gwaeron only flames when he has reason, and he had about drop'd it...but apparently you emailed his HOME email and tried to verbally attack him again, hence his huge Flame post.  <br>
<br>
Aerch, i understand the problems as i have just recently taken over the Guild Leader Tag, but i've been in the game too long and know how it goes even when wasnt a leader.  Removing his officer tag would be good, to at least limit the damage done and lower even more if some situation as such occurs again.<br>
<br>
I am sorry to see that such a person would act that way for a guild w/good standings...and i am stating this..LoA has no probs w/Warders...but roren is ban'd from any of our events...rest of your guild is more than welcome to join us thru proper signing up or thru pick up raids.  Hopefully Roren's one big screw up w/a LOT of guilds wont hender LoA and WoN from future fighting.<br>
<br>

He'll apologize to a few people, and turn around and insult someone else. Doesn't sound very remorseful to me does it?<br>
<br>
In the work world, he would've been fired for being disruptive. In school, he would've been expelled. In public, he probably would've been arrested. His behavior and attitude was probably just reinforced by virtue of the fact that there was no negative consequences to his guild status.<br>
<br>
As far as DoT and LoA's less than exemplary members, there aren't really any that exist. Disreputables never even make it through the screening process. Someone like Roren would've never even got past application. I can certainly speak for LoA in the year that I had been with them and I can't even recall the removal or public complaint of a single person in that time. We simply refuse to house such individuals when there are a multitude of good people to pick from. As such, we have become a tightly knit group of people, even when members have left their ranks and become alumnus or ally.<br>
<br>
Now as far as Roren and the incident...Gwaeron's Nagafen raid was May 2nd. Roren decided to send him a not so pleasant email dated May 8th and the result of that email was a rightfully outraged Gwaeron and his post. You may decide for yourself who foolishly brought something up that may have been dropped.<br>
<br>
And Roren, Gwaeron didn't slander you on the boards. You've already done that to yourself. If you had apologized not only to him but also to LoA's guildleader, whom you foolishly challenged, folks probably would've just let it drop. We'd probably still think you're an idiot and keep you on the unwelcomed list, but at least we wouldn't talk about it anymore. As such, your lack of humility earned you a &quot;Gwaeron Trashing.&quot; It would behoove you to simply be apologetic and not send anyone emails, and then you can start rebuilding what's left of your rep. It would also greatly behoove you to delete his email, unless you wish to go another round with Gwae...hehe. <p><DIV ALIGN="center">

Plus Roren has been a member longer than I have been guild leader, and things have changed a lot since then.  He is definitely not going to be an officer anymore as soon as I catch up with him, and we are holding talks in our officers’ newsroom about possible punishments that may include banning.  In any case rest assured we care about our guild and will take appropriate action.  <br>
<br>
We are a large guild with a fairly decent track record, and appreciate any future joint ventures that may come about.  Until then, go in piece and may your adventures lead to treasures. <br>
