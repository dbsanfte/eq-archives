<br>
I looked up, having been peacefully sitting on the dock enjoying the sunshine and a quiet interlude waiting for Ordained, my step-father to be, to finish healing and buffing all of those in need who had been clammoring for his attention for the last half hour or so. Looming straight ahead of me, so close I could smell his foul breath, was a sand giant, massive, so huge that I in my slight wood-elf frame felt as insignificant as a fly!<br>
<br>
BOOM! The sand giant swatted his enormous staff at a poor man below who was desperately trying to flee in fear of his life, each dodge and duck bringing the two even closer to the docks.... Terrified, for my youth meant I had no defenses against such a monster, and as I had been sitting for some time was without buff or SoW to aid me, I leapt to my feet and dove into the water with time only to emit a wordless cry of warning to Ordained.<br>
<br>
Reaching the shore I hesitated and turned, ashamed of my cowardice. Ordained stood still as stone on the dock staring up at the giant who was stomping and mashing the nearby tent and outbuilding as he glared down at the helpless beings below him and smiling terribly. My heart sank into my boots. Ordained had been healing - his habit was to have at least one offensive spell memorized at all times, but to face a sand giant without a full array of attack spells, shields up and fresh Spirit of Wolf upon oneself, even for so great a druid, was well-nigh suicidal!<br>
<br>
But there were many like myself too close and in danger, and Ordained with a quiet smile raised his arms and cast, flinging himself straight at the sand giant. With tears in my eyes and the certainty of his death in my heart, I returned to the dock as the combatants swiftly disappeared to the northwest.<br>
<br>
I fear I swooned then. Perhaps I may be forgiven this weakness at this particular time, for it came just days before my mother, Galadria, and Ordained were to be united in marriage, and he was only there in Oasis to look out for me as a favor to her. Should I somehow have brought about his death at this point in time, I was not certain she would be able to forgive me. I know that I am not a coward; it was not lack of personal courage so much as heartache at the potential sacrifice of Ordained on my behalf and that of others who had no clue what it entailed that drew me into clouds of darkness.<br>
<br>
When I had recovered myself enough to once more be aware, I sent a mind-call ringing through the still desert air, hoping against hope that Ordained still lived. Faint but true came his swift answer - aye, somehow he had managed to find time to mem a root spell and fling it at the giant to give himself time and mana to bring the monster nearly to its defeat, but now another had joined in the battle against him as well as a dry bones skeleton and he was still beset!<br>
<br>
Silence again. I heard nothing, the battle taking place too far distant from my resting place. The people around me went on about their business as if nothing unusual at all was occuring, taking it for granted the powerful druid would emerge victorious and callously unconcerned with his safety. Someone behind me waiting for the raft to Kunark casually offered to give water to anyone who asked before his departure. At almost the same moment I heard Ordained in the distance, his voice so faint he could barely be heard, crying out for water as his was totally gone and he was still engaged in his desert run, trying to keep the second sand giant far from the docks.<br>
<br>
I turned to the man on the raft and begged him to give me the water he had offered, but was ignored. The raft left and I stood helplessly watching, knowing I had little myself to spare. But hearing my plea, a poor fellow on the dock itself, wounded and half dead, in a move of great sacrifice turned and handed me six flasks. Unshielded and un-SoW'ed I set off through the hot dry sands to find Ordained, guided only by my tracking skill.<br>
<br>
There... track showed him straight ahead somewhere, and now I could see the sand giant although I could not spot the druid himself. But suddenly I found myself rooted and unable to move forward, and a blast of pure heat and singing fire flamed my unprotected skin! Carelessly intent on the trail left by Ordained's running battle and in sight of my goal, I never saw the desert madman too near to me and was now perhaps to pay the price! Grimly I endured the pain and gripped my PGT in hand, snare readied, my only attack spell of flame-lick firmly in my mind, and waited for the roots that held me frozen to fall away.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry, Ordained,&quot; I whispered, &quot;if I should fall before I reach you, know that I tried.&quot;<br>
<br>
As I turned at last to face my adversary I could see Ordained looking for me as the sand giant struggled to flee its imminent death, but tore my eyes from him to face my own adversary. The madman resisted snare, but I smiled as my flame-lick bit into him and began to eat away his strength. Raising PGT and shield, I leapt forward to meet him and a wild burst of strength and battle fury took over. I did not notice my own hurts as I swung and hacked again and again and again, dodging what blows I could, absorbing others on my shield, my flesh and being still rocking with the spells the madman cast. But there, suddenly he lay dead at my feet and ignoring the body I ran on to where Ordained still wandered in his fever and thirst, unable to find me.<br>
<br>
With thanks and praise to Tunare I watched as he gulped the life-giving water I handed him. We had both survived.<br>

<br>
Um, the SG's died, the Dry bones died..and 2 other Giants followed soon after... Thanks Tuilere for the water, I was parched indeed...was like running a marathon...and no one, not a single person offered assistance to me when I had 2 SG's on me...um, regardless of the fact that I quad kite HG's...but i didn't have the right spells up and was hard pressed. Again, Thank you Tuilere for your assistance and aid.<br>
A very good telling indeed, I was embarrassed to read it yet captivated by it all at once! Well done <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm17.showMessage?topicID=55.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm17.showMessage?topicID=52.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm17.emailToFriend?topicID=56.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm17.threadControl?topicID=56.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm17.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=56.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm17.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=56.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub44.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm20">General Forum<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm16">Gatherings of the Brave<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm25">Bazaar of the Brave<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm17">Tales and Roleplay<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm15">Questing<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm18">Honour Role <option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm19">Dishonourable Denizens<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm22">Guild Tavern<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm21">Officers Lounge<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm24">High Council Forum<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm23">Vault of the Brave</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8B4513>- </font><a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/beverquestersofnorrath>Discussions for the Brave</a><font color=#8B4513> - </font><a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm17>Tales and Roleplay</a> <font color=#8B4513> - </font><a href="http://victusfortis.n3.net">Home of Victus Fortis</a><font color=#8B4513> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-1925262" target="_blank" >
