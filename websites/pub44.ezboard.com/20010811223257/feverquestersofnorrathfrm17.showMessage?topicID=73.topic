After moping around East Commons by myself a bit, and venturing into Freeport (where even dealing with the merchants can be a bit trying for a dark elf at times), I decided to journey down south to the desert region known as Oasis, where I had heard there were continual infestations of crocodiles and caimans and other beasts that needed clearing out. This seemed a suitable challenge for a warrior of my level, which was then 13.<br>
<br>
I found the first reptile to challenge near the docks midway along the coast, and swinging my Langseax and a PGT I had picked up, soon chopped it into chunks of meat suitable for dinner. From there I went on to the next and the next, but while on the third or so a nasty dry bones skeleton decided to join in the battle against me and my health was dropping very fast when suddenly there were others of various races and creeds weighing in to help. I confess to being somewhat amazed at their kindness and charity in lending a hand to a mere dark elf female, for they could not know I was not in fact a follower of Innoruk as are so many of my kind, or thoroughly evil. Having seen the beasts both lying dead, the others bowed and left me alone again to pursue my solo battles, thoroughly healed and with a buff or two as well to protect me beyond the power of my arm and armour.<br>
<br>
The solo battles went on for a while, with similar assistance when there was need. Mostly I stayed apart from the others in the area, too proud to accept heals and buffs too often, and bound my own wounds or sat in silence on the dock while I mended. Then a young wood elf warrior named Kendryk arrived, and seeing that we belonged in fact to the same guild, we struck up a conversation and decided to try our luck together.<br>
<br>
I must say that for a member of such a weak race and a follower of a feminine goddess named Tunare, this Kendryk acquitted himself quite well in my company, bringing no shame at all to the warrior class. His bow shot true and often; the blows of his weapons landed squarely... Together we bested many a foe although our stock of bandages dwindled to nothing along the way. But there were many times when our adversaries proved too much for us - Kendryk died and was resurrected by his Tunare I think seven times, while I saw my own life blood pour out into the sand at least four times and yet came back (no god of course caused this, but purely warrior's fate). I will have to admit the wood elf died well each time and came back laughing. This is as it should be...<br>
<br>
In all, Kendryk was quite attentive as a companion and paid me many flattering compliments... Perhaps it is just as well Ayzreall was not in the vicinity? But after all, I am a dark elf and no matter any mild diversions with such weaker beings as wood elves, Ayzreall remains my destined mate and I will have no other while he remains at my side.<br>
<br>
Reaching my 15th season, I returned to Freeport to sneak some training from the warrior guild there (requiring a kind druid to give me wolf form to obtain) and set off for Highpass Hold, where I hope to meet up with my Ayzreall soon and challenge the denizens of Mucktail Gnolls.<br>

I know nothing of dwarves to compare to, but cannot imagine how you could possibly equate anything of me with those little stumpy fellows! Destiny is destiny. One must follow the path created for one... or at least know the true destination.<br>
<br>
Ordained, with due respect (as one must accord one's elders and the relatives of one's guildmates) I am certain you do Kendryk an injustice. Towns may run him out; fathers and husbands may lock him out; he presents such a fresh and delightful approach to certain things that I am certain women and daughters find ways to spend time in his company regardless.<br>
<br>
Hmmm ... yes, one must follow one's personal path and mine leads to Ayzreall in the end. This is only fitting. But ... one's path may have many shady bowers along the way, tempting one to dally and perhaps divert oneself ... er ... sip from a chance found well or stream ... ahem ... uh .... dip into ... Never mind.<br>
<br>
Following my sojourn in Oasis, I found my way to Highpass Hold and met Ayzreall there, who had been fighting gnolls in an attempt to prove his actual loyalty to the forces of good and gain faction there. In spite of having spent several seasons already slaying these beasts, the guards and citizens of Highpass still regard him most threateningly, presumably because he was forced to declare himself a follower of Innoruk. Although I know the truth of this matter, as do those of you in Victus Fortis, these inhabitants of Highpass Hold seem reluctant to allow him any benefit of doubt. I find that I myself may wander freely into the various inns and taverns there, and into Highkeep itself without danger, but then I worship fighting and the sword and no mere god.<br>
<br>
The group of halflings who invited us to join them on the gnoll ledge one day proved less than adequate companions in battle, and I have met no others worthy of the respect of such a warrior as myself. Ayzreall and I have been better off lying in wait in the passage from East Karana where we can pick off those gnolls who are foolish enough to wander our way. At times my mate raises up a giant skeleton pet to amuse and assist us, his powers of magic growing every day. I admire his skill, and more than once he has drained his own life rather than that of our opponents to save my life or heal me when the odds were great. I know that he relies upon my strong arm in these battles as I rely upon his magic. We are well matched as companions and as fighting duo ...<br>
<br>
Highpass is incredibly lonely when Ayzreall is not there. In his absence I purchased a fishing pole and bait and ventured to the pool beneath the falls there the other day, spending several hours in this quiet occupation with some success. I would rather be fighting .... I hear that Kendryk has arrived here from Oasis to test his blades upon gnoll hides, and remember his prowess in Oasis .... Perhaps, just perhaps, I may allow myself to test my memory of his um ... &quot;skill&quot; ... and uh ...<br>
<br>
I seem unaccountably to have lost track of what I was saying.<br>
