We managed to meet GM Frizznik and he tagged us with our name.<br>
<br>
However, some sort of bug has caused some whacky things.  It seems we have swallowed the StormRyder guild.  I am going to get it worked out later today hopefully.  Please be prepared for the fact that there may be a need to reformt he guild.  Frizznik knows we have the people so it should just be a matter of him tagging me and me hunting people down and passing out tags.  If this does happen I will tag who I can as we go, and would like to plan another gathering for next week at the same time.  Najena or Unrest would be cool, although I would love to explore Unrest some more.<br>
<br>
Also, the officer tagging thing now works.  I was doing it right in case you want to know, it just wasn't working.  It was either one of those bugs that fixed itself or was fixed by logging out.<br>
<br>
I couldn't sleep last night so I logged back on and joined our fellow raiders in Unrest.  A great time was had by all!  There were a few deaths, including my own, but we had fun so it didn't really matter.<br>
<br>
I can't tell you how proud seeing that guild tag over our heads made me.  It has been a long couple months of hard work for many of us here.  The few times that were strenous and the frustrations that came and went were all worth it.  Our bond will grow stronger and this will become more like a family every day, you will be suprised how true that is.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I have another post or two to make then I am gonna log in and see what is up.<br>
<br>
be well friends! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/uwarninwraithlore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Warnin Wraithlore</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.telusplanet.net/public/canadak/sig.JPG BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10> at: 2/23/01 12:37:32 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/uwegian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>wegian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#8B4513>(2/23/01 4:09:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> RE: Interesting night...</span><hr size=1> WOW!<br>
<br>
Wasn't that just the *most* fun.<br>
<br>
There were around 10 of us in Unrest and about 1-3 other people in the zone at various times; so we basically had the place to ourselves.<br>
<br>
No worries about trains created by other people. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I, pulling for the &quot;higher level&quot; group managed to cause 2 or 3 trains, for which I humbly appologise, which managed to get 2 or 3 folks killed. But apart from that I think there was only another 1 or 2 trains.<br>
<br>
From my, biased, point of view, the most amazing thing was having 9-11 (not sure of correct number) people in the same RL room being online in the same zone. I feel really sorry for warnin/rave who was only able to experience &quot;half&quot; the fun. <br>
<br>
It's *much* easier to actually call out &quot;everybody happy if i pull this ###&quot; rather than having to type a message. It also gave the other group some advance warning of when our group was pulling, so they were often able to &quot;take&quot; the death beatles off my tail, while the high group took on the mobs i'd intended to pull.<br>
<br>
A really big thanks goes to Jindalee for her efforts (in RL) to feed us! Much appreciated.<br>
<br>
And, from my biased point of view, a very big thank you to the mighty niffo for keeping me and everyone else alive! Without his great efforts, more of us would have had to do CRs.<br>
<br>
Finally, THANKS warnin/rave/grogguk for doing the work of three folks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  in getting us all to where we are now!<br>
<br>
Thanks everyone,<br>
May Victus Fortus rule our Hearts!<br>
<br>
cheers<br>
Wegian.<br>

VICTUS FORTIS LIVES.... errr... nevermind.  It dies.  Hehe.  <br>
<br>
As my e-mail stated we were disbanded by Frizznik or just deleted or something.  The guild officially doesn't exist.  I have e-mailed him to see what to do next.<br>
<br>
As far as the rest of it, yes it was fun.  And I know the fun of playing side by side so it truly would have been cool to be there with ya all.  But ye are forgetting I type 291489324 words a minute almost as fast as calling things out.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Well, not really.  And my accuracy sucks.<br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks to all who showed up it was fun.  It doesn't seem like a big thing on paper, but once the guild was official it was like, WOOOHOOOO!  it seemed better no?  And it is my pleasure doing all this, everyone is worth it.<br>
<br>
