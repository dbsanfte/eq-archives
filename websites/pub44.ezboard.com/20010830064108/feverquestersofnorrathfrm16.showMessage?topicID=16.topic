<br>
We have as yet not made a decision on where to go.  We need to do that quickly so that everybody can get there and organised before, so we can get right down to business.<br>
<br>
So far the suggestions have been, and add them if I have missed some -<br>
<br>
1) Unrest again - personally I am keen on this idea, coz I have not done that much there.  I would like to see a 20+ group in there this time, actually going inside the house.  And maybe one group outside and one lower group perhaps in the back room.  Luni is there already, dead adn the entrance to the basement.  Wow, 2 festering hags and my life expectancy is less than being dropped into Vietnam.  Etaudarg died with half his health bar full as it didn't even have time to update.  They are going down, big time.  I have never had great succes in Unrest, died much more than I have lived.  I think the answer is a decent group (not just 2 of us) and a little thought.<br>
<br>
2) say Najena and Lavastorm.  This sounds like a good idea.  The hardest part is getting to lavastorm past the nasty dark elves and guardians.  But then, we can always have fun with them along the way.<br>
<br>
I understand that others might be ready to move to a different location.  Please speak up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I would like to propose however, if people aren't against Unrest, that we stay there one more week.  MOst of us are there already, and we really haven't gone inside. I think it is time to up the ante.  And it would be excellent to have a higher level group too.<br>
<br>
Please add your thoughts, however let's be definitive coz we have not got long to get organised.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/uwarninwraithlore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Warnin Wraithlore</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.telusplanet.net/public/canadak/sig.JPG BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br>  Posts: 250<br> <font color=#8B4513>(3/8/01 7:58:36 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.telusplanet.net/public/canadak/warnin1.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raid - Friday 9-3-01 1800 Aus 8-3-01 2300 PST US</span><hr size=1> I'll sorta repeat what I said earlier.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Unrest</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  I like this place but I think we are not quite powerful enough for it.  We can do ok but once we get a bit overwhelmed there is no recovering from it and many will die.  It's not the dying part that really gets to me, it is seeing everyone else die and myself not being able to stop it.  I want to go back here, that is for damn sure.  I would love to do a full blown raid on this dungeon and kick some arse.  But it should be a month or so down the road when we can all handle it a bit better.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Befallen</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  I like this place because of the lower level creatures on the first floor.  People can hang there, and the higher levels can wander down in the dungeon.  Some disadvantages is that it is small.  Myself and torson would have a hard time, unless he can shrink already but I think that is a bit higher level spell.  It may be hard to get around me and target things and all that with my big arse in the way.  However there is good loot, Jagged Bands and such.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Najena</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  This place is ok but I suggest level 14+ only.  10-13 could maybe go in if the tank is 14 or 15 and if you have two of them.  I could be wrong but I remember going in when I was 16 with Taallon and 2 druids.  We did ok with the skeletons and guards, but soon as Tenticle Terrors came into the picture it became difficult until I knew how to fight them (back to the wall or in a corner).  The more I think about it the more i think you would be ok with a decent tank or two, if they pull into the big room near the start and take the skeletons, ogre guards, and maybe some elementals.  And there is always the option of hunting things in Lavastorm.  Most stuff there is easy to isolate and are solo things that don't group you.  Most of all most of them are indifferent so you can just whack em.<br>
<br>
For the higher levels I think I can direct us into the more safe areas so that death is a slightly decreased possibility.  We could even explore a bit if we are careful.  There is also a guy who drops the Dark Circlet, a necromancer or mage named trazdon.  The Dark Circlet is the part of a warrior crafted armour quest.  It would be nice to have a go at him with a full group.  There is also decent spellcaster loot in this one if I remember correctly.<br>
<br>
<br>
I was kinda hoping we could skip unrest.  I am bound in Highpass Hold so one of the other two would be cool.  Just don't feel like begging for two more gates and binds from Gippen.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   However, either way I will go to any of them.  If I have to I can hop a boat with Warnie if you want to go to unrest.<br>
<br>
be well! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/utaallon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Taallon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#8B4513>(3/8/01 11:44:27 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.fbe.unsw.edu.au/staff/graham.hannah/eq/resources/taallon60x60.jpg  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raid - Friday 9-3-01 1800 Aus 8-3-01 2300 PST US</span><hr size=1> I am with Guk.  I was at unrest for a long time and did more running around than anything.  I would like to go back but only until we can kick some major butt.<br>
<br>
Najena could be fun.  Warnin and I were there for a while and did not do to bad considering what lvl we were.  You are corrct Guk there are some good spellcaster drops there.<br>
<br>
I am open to whatever we want to do, for the good of the guild. Just looking forward to seeing you all tonite and laying waste to the beasties that confront us.<br>

I think that Unrest would offer the least problems with organising people to get there, which is nice as its a huge pain having to wait for the boat to arrive and so on, though I guess that if Gippen Airlines is tripping the light fantastic then this might be less of a problem. I also think that Unrest has worked reasonably well with the group levels that we've had the last couple of times, though the trains do get pretty ugly. We also have to make sure that there is something for the group of players who are still around level 10. I haven't been to Najeena, so I don't know how well it stacks up for this level of players.<br>
<br>
I'd also like us to make this decision a bit earlier in the week if we could, so that I can organise a character to be in the right place for when we start. I've started back at Uni which limits my playing time somewhat, so if we're going to do something then I'd like to be able to plan ahead and hit the ground running for the group session.<br>

Sorry.  Missed the part about staying in Unrest.  I'm not so big on the zone, but I am willing cause of it being too late.  However I would have to take warnin cause Groggy in Highpass right now.  And last time it took me 4 tries to get on the boat and I lost a fair amount of XP, plus I can't get on it at all in Kaladim to get back.<br>
<br>
For some reason I didn't get much faction for them.  Heh.  I can train in Kelethin though, and probably with the high elfs too.<br>
<br>
However, I am just one and if there are a ton of people for Unrest then I will hop the boat with Warnin and pop over.<br>
<br>
Then again nobody may see this in time... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Another alternative is to get cammo if there is another person there, like a druid/wiz/ench etc.<br>
<br>
You could even try sneaking *snigger*.  I guess they would still smell you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As far as places go, it seems pretty divided.  I would make a push for one, except that I have an idea that a few people were going to start new characters.  Jindalae was meant to get the game (and not share with Blue) and a couple were going to start anew with her.  However she has not been able to get it (usual supply problems with the game, cant understand this).  <br>
<br>
I do think Taals that in Unrest with Gippen, Luni, Warnie, Taals etc there we have a good chance of taking out most anything in the zone.<br>
<br>
However it is looking like we will end up grouping in a few different zones.  Not as good as all in the one zone, but still better than nothing now that we have a guild. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm16.showMessage?topicID=18.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm16.showMessage?topicID=15.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm16.emailToFriend?topicID=16.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm16.threadControl?topicID=16.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm16.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=16.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm16.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=16.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub44.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm20">General Forum<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm16">Gatherings of the Brave<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm25">Bazaar of the Brave<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm17">Tales and Roleplay<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm15">Questing<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm18">Honour Role <option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm19">Dishonourable Denizens<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm22">Guild Tavern<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm21">Officers Lounge<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm24">High Council Forum<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm23">Vault of the Brave</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8B4513>- </font><a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/beverquestersofnorrath>Discussions for the Brave</a><font color=#8B4513> - </font><a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm16>Gatherings of the Brave</a> <font color=#8B4513> - </font><a href="http://victusfortis.n3.net">Home of Victus Fortis</a><font color=#8B4513> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-1925262" target="_blank" >
