Something</span><hr size=1> The problem is what?<br>
<br>
I know we are a little Ranger heavy, which kinda goes well for me,'cos I'm stuck in a rutt as to what next?<br>
<br>
This is me:<br>
<br>
Banded all the way except, boots (blackened Iron), mask (Splitpaw hide) Collar (Spiked Splitpaw with Str bonus) belt (Leather).<br>
<br>
Weapons PGT used and loved - Arachnid tip magic piercing (gift from Ferrum, as was the PGT), Velium Shortsword, fine steel Sabre (gift from Ferrum).<br>
<br>
I'm lvl 16, looking forward to Duel wield at 17.<br>
<br>
I am an Average Archer at the moment using a Bow that Araegorne kindly made for me, I think its elm.<br>
<br>
Skills - Good at 1hs, feeble at piercing,<br>
Trade skills - feeble at fletching<br>
<br>
My questions:<br>
<br>
1. What next for armour - I have a strength of 81, my banded lot weighs 77, is there anything lighter and better?<br>
2. What do I Duel wield with, I've got about 110pp - I think I'll stick with the PGT in primary, and skill up piercing in the next few days to use the Arachnid tip - what about Claws, whips, Langseax<br>
3. Trueshot or not to trueshot?<br>
<br>
It was easy when younger - kill stuff, buy armour, get a short metal thing in hand to cut things with. Now I'm just a little confused..<br>
<br>
Anyone guide me a little please? <p>Semdayen<Br>Ranger of the 16th Season<Br>In the Service of Tunare<Br><Br>'I am not lost - this is the scenic route'

Something</span><hr size=1> I thnk that a trueshot is a must have for every ranger, although I only ever played a ranger to lev 2.<br>
<br>
Wegian is one person who can make such bows, and there might be others that can without too many failures.  <br>
<br>
I think they sell for 200p.<br>
<br>
It is not easy though, LLainya has had a LOT of attempts, even as a master fletcher, and failed every one.  We don't stop ribbing her EVERY SINGLE DAY about it - &quot;a ranger without a trueshot.  That is like a rogue without a piercing weapon laaaaaf laaaaf laaaaaaf&quot; - easily amused.  Galadria has also had something like 29 failures since her first successful attempt (I may need to be corrected on that one).<br>
<br>
I believe that a ranger cannot wear plate, so you can't go bronze etc.  Perhaps ivy etched is the next step.  With a full group in the 20's you should be able to get at least some of the items. This will give you a lot more space to carry loot as well.<br>
<br>
Keep an eye out for auctions, and I would recommend that you get as many str items as possible, as your str is quite low.<br>
<br>
I imagine with so many other rangers in the guild you will get lots of better advice.<br>
<br>
For dual weilding I would go a very fast delay weapon in the off hand, the lowest delay possible - eg gnoll hide lariat.  It does not do damage, but your skill will raise very quickly.  Once into the 20's I found with my bard that my dual weild is the first to max out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/usemdayen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Semdayen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#8B4513>(5/7/01 1:58:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Desperately seeking...

Something</span><hr size=1> Some things you can pick up and should have and that don't cost TOO much are things like<br>
<br>
1) a blood-stained mantle<br>
2) a purity belt<br>
<br>
If you want to advance your fletching skills, then work on other items that will raise either your wis or int - I understand it functions using whichever is higher for that. I wish I knew what I did right with the balance back when my fletching skill was a mere 82 or 83 and I succeeded on the second attempt with the Trueshot! It's been screwed up ever since and yeah you're right, something like 29 fails at much higher skill to ever make a second. Sheesh!<br>
<br>
The bow... should have at least an ashwood now, more range and power than an elm. If you can't make one yourself, any of us with fletch skill can generally make one for about 30 pp cost of materials...<br>
<br>
Weight IS always a problem for a ranger... too much and you lose agi, which is important. Dual wield - well I switch off with a number of items - was fortunate enough some time back to have a friend rich enough to loan me the money to buy an ebony bladed sword which was ranger only, and took the easy way out to get a Short Sword of Morin (ranger only) by trading that to Morin himself in Kith. There's another way to get this blade, by taking out some baddie who has a map you turn in to Morin... maybe we could get together a group to help on that. Kinda nice having a ranger only weapon even if it has now been kinda replaced by something more &quot;uber&quot; in the game.<br>
<br>
Forget what the name is of the newest sword I'm dual wielding with the SSoM... Kendryk do you know? Hehe... before that was alternating with either a PGT or a tentacle whip (fast and has life-tap to suck 5 pts of health from the mob and add it to yours - doesn't sound like a lot but adds up) or with my Dragoon Dirk for piercing. Mostly my weapons are relatively low damage (nothing over 6 or 7) but make up for it in speed.<br>
<br>
Will try to remember and take a look and see what else. I know for gloves I wore a pair of split paws for some time rather than banded... and recently replaced them with the gem-inlaid gauntlets from the quest in SK with the scrolls. Lose the wis the sp gloves add, but gain in ac and the fact the gauntlets are weightless....<br>
<br>
Later,<br>

<br>
Wyvern claw..7/26 +3 str =) and sumptin else..very nice<br>
Ebony Razor ..11/? (very fast).. the rest of the stats are n/a....but i believe it is usable by rangers...<br>
<br>
the claws run about 350pp.....saddly, the razor is around 500 to 600pp...spendy...but well worth it, I think...so save your money for the weapons.. =) <br>
<br>
As a ranger, or any warrior type that can, always try and keep ALL your melee skills up. This includes 1hb 2hb and 2hs...as well as 1hs...some weapons will work better against some creatures so keep up the skill =) it sux, but it's a necessity..or sumptin...anyways, there ya go<br>

<br>
One thing you can look for is a Silver War Axe.  It is 1HS 6/22, and I found one for 50pp (although they can get up to 100pp).  The Langseax is warrior only and is sorta out of the question for ya Sem.  The Silvery is a great weapon to train dual wield up, very fast.  When you are training any skills look for weapons in the low 20 range (for 1 handed skills) and mide 30 range for 2 handed skills.  Do not worry about damage when training them up.  If you are in tank heavy groups most don't care if you practice up your weapons, as long as you are ready to switch to your main weapons the instant things start to get hectic.  I wish I had more advice to train up some of your other skills but the weapons I got to train mine that were fast were small race only.  I know for 2hb there is a 7/30 weapon Kitcha Koro Mis (or something very similar) that can be found in Lake of Ill omen.  Awesome for training 2hb.  For 2HS once you get some more cash look for a Tower Guard Blade (16/36 AC 5) for around 175-200pp.<br>
<br>
However, be a bit weary about getting those 6 dam/low 20 (6 dam common in low speed weapons) delay weapons right now.  I got some good ones, the speed is awesome for taunting and the 6 damage is made up for in the speed.  The reason I am cautioning you about them is that they crap out in the low 20s for the creatures you are fighting are often red in LOIO (if thats where you go) and don't do much damge.  The difficult thing is that you need the speed to ahve a better chance of hitting them.  Anyway, I found in an awefully hurry that spending all my money on good armor thinking I had decent weapons was a mistake.  Once in LOIO my damage started tailing off to the point that paladins of 2 levels lower were out taunting me (even though they were twinks, I should still be able to out-taunt them).  Well, I guess you are in a precarious situation too money wise, as the better weapons are a fairly huge jump in price right now.<br>
<br>
Also, look into 2 FS Daggers.  They are very cheap (around 2pp from people, a lot just give em away) but I forget what zone they drop in.  The reason I chose those for working up peircing is their speed.  They are 3/19.  Unless you have a lot of cash you won't be able to get 19 speed piercing weapons that offer better damage.  Anyway, in one night at level 18 Grogguk went from 20something piercing to max in about 3-4 hours.  Wait until you have a tank heavy group that can sacrifice a bit of damage, pull out the daggers, and start thumping.<br>
<br>
It is very important for melee people to work on all weapon skills (save for throwing, and if you were anything other than a ranger I would say archery <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  You never know when a good weapon will come along and you will want the skill.  For example, with Warnin I ignored the blunt skills.  Then a friend leaving the game bestowed a Silver Etched War Hammer upon him.  Well, something like 36/48 weapon!!!  It was doin 50 damage a swipe, and my skill was horrible in it.<br>
<br>
A great thing I found on the net was AllaKhazam's site.  He has this nifty little search engine for items.  You can doa search and exclude some parameters.  it is at <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eq.stomped.com">eq.stomped.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> and you can search each weapon class you are looking for.  It will list the suggested level that you can quest or go for the drop at.  Disregard that sometimes, as some can be bought and for the others you have a whole guild that should be able to help you out.<br>
<br>
Kendryk, isn;t the ebon razor 9/25?  I could be off or thinking about a different weapon though.  The one I am thinking of sells for 400-600pp.  Anyway, I have a dismaying story about that one.  One day in Gfay I hear the shout go out for an ebon razor for only 150pp!!!  I checked my bank box and was heart broken when I saw 136pp.  I asked the lady if I could get it and get her some coins right away (I was selling off old armor at the time) and she said she had gone so low she couldn't possibly go lower and she had to go soon.  I so totally understood.  15 mins later I had the coin (an extra 20something pp too for her) but she had already logged off.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I don't know lots about ranger armor except the advice to hold off for your ivory etched.  Another thing you can look into is a Thick Leather Apron.  It has 1 better than bronze AC and is fairly cheap to buy, not sure where it drops.  Used allakhazams for searches on that and other armor too.<br>
<br>
I am not sure if I said anythig useful, lol.  Anyway, if I think of more I will add to it.<br>

<br>
So to sum up:<br>
<br>
1. Get some more cash you lazy sod<br>
2. Practise your other Melee skills you lazy sod<br>
3. Go after your Ivy Etched in a few more levels, you impatient lazy sod.<br>
4. Go quest for your Trueshot you lazy sod.<br>
5. Dual Wield with low delay, and unfortunately in some cases low damage to start with - you noddle armed sod.<br>
<br>
I think the Moral support is the best part...<br>

Something</span><hr size=1> In case the bat smashing thing wasn't a joke, my dear friend, creatures have to be blue to gain skill off of them.  Best if they are yellow or low red.  That is why I suggest that you can be patient, try to get a group with heavy damage, like a good wizard, a necro (with pet) and a heavy tank group with a cleric.  That way your damage isn't as needed and you can use those wimpy damage weapons and your skill will fly up.<br>
<br>
To change out your weapons faster this is what I do.<br>
<br>
I put both the primary and secondary slot on my hotkey menu.  Then I put one inventory slot on it.  I a bag in that inventory slot with all my weapons in there.  Then all I have to do is open the bag quickly and switch out weapons.  With a little bit o practice you get very quick and efficient doing it.  This way you can practice your weapon skills without being a detriment to the group.  If something big comes along or you get overwhelmed you can switch to your primary damage weapons.  If it is fairly easy going use your training weapons.  I got so quick at it that one group didn't even notice i was switching out and practicing low skills.<br>
<br>
As far as your recap there, it was pretty close.<br>
<br>
For moral support:<br>
<br>
May Brell bless ye child ranger so that ye may bash dem nasties and destroy all manner of evils whilst becoming one of the best battlers of all time.  Ye are a danage dealing god soon me friend, and ye shall strik terror into the hearts of the evils that plague our great lands.  Mayhaps there be a wee bit o dwarf in ye so that ye shall dominate the lands as we do!!!<br>

Something</span><hr size=1> Thanks Ferrum<br>
<br>
I tried a few bats last night, just for the BBQ you understand.<br>
<br>
Well, I couldnt find a decent heavy hitting group last night, in fact found myself as the highest lvl, and tank in the GR in BlackBurrow!<br>
<br>
However, happily I managed to attract a lvl 30 Shaman to play mother,(Promised him all the Gnoll teeth that we knocked out - the rest of the group looked a little put out for some reason) and found a very nice lvl 17 cleric to group and heal.<br>
<br>
OK, so it took 3 hours to tickle a Gnoll Commander to death 1hp at a time, with a few despairing sighs from the rest of the group, I managed to get my Piercing skill to 'you will no longer stab yourself in the foot' level.<br>
<br>
The Hot Key swap out I will try tonight Ferrum, and Thanks.<br>
