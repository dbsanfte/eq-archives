Just wanted to offer some thoughts on our Saturday raid of Castle Mistmoore.  All in all, I think it was a big step in our progress as a guild and I hope that everyone involved gained something from it.  As I share these thoughts, please realize they are only a personal view and I welcome any support or counterpoints as you see fit.  Here goes:<br>
<br>
GENERAL:<br>
<br>
1)  Advertisement is great.  Posting a time and location in &quot;Gatherings of the Brave&quot; is a no-brainer.  I think it also helps to post a note in General Forum to guide people toward GOTB post.  Some of us, myself included, may not read the GOTB thread as much as we should.  A general post helps steer people in the right direction.  I think planning the event a week in advance or so seems a good heads-up.  Obvioiusly, attendance opportunity will fluctuate with RL plans, but the more notice one has, the better.  Remind people in guildchat the week of, too.  Basically, ensure that all hands are aware of the event time and location.<br>
<br>
2)  Keep the goal in mind.  Often, xp may not be there for you.  The MOBs may all be green.  Often we may be fighting for items and not xp.  This can be frustrating for someone who is battling through a hell level, but it's just part of the equation and must be accepted if you're going to participate.  The ideal raid combines xp, gear loot, and quest loot.  Sometimes one or more of these may be absent.  What overrides all of these things, IMO, is the teamwork that we gain - the knowledge of each other's styles and our ability to function as a unit.<br>
<br>
3)  Show up on time, or if you're going to be late, let someone know ahead of time.  This allows us to plan our groups and get balanced so that we don't spend too much time on raid day getting groups organized.<br>
<br>
4)  It is important to have someone assigned as a Master Looter (ML).  This speeds up the action and eliminates confusion.  The ML should take advantage of zone ooc or shout when notifying raid of no drop loots.  Gear or quest loots that are not no drop can be distributed mid or post fight as the raid party sees fit.  If your group &quot;wins&quot; loot rights, let it sit until ML can get to it.  Puller should not be ML, too much to handle.<br>
<br>
5)  For party balance, it is important that each group have an EVAC individual assigned.  I know druids can, not sure about other classes.  It is a tough call to order EVAC, and I'm not yet sure what the best strategy for executing EVAC should be.  Maybe the raid leader should make the call, or maybe it should be at the group level and determined by the EVAC individual.  Any thoughts?<br>
<br>
6)  Puller should utilize ooc or shout to announce pulls.  This keeps all groups, as well as non-guildies, apprised of what's incoming.  I did not do this and regret it.  Lesson learned.<br>
<br>
7)  Make a list of who needs which gear or quest items beforehand.  This should be accomplished on the web posts prior to raid.  Obviously, this will fluctuate some, but it will help ML in the organization of loot distribution.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Make sure zone knows about raid.  Ensure someone in each group has a zone shout hot-keyed for trains, just in case.  Remember that other players are watching us and evaluating our guild, and we want to set a good example.<br>
<br>
9)  Patience is the ultimate virtue.  If you die, it is very frustrating.  It is OK to get angry, but take a few minutes to regroup yourself and remember that others may be counting on you.  With proper planning deaths can be minimized, but not often will they be completely avoided.  Remember, NO ONE wants you to die.  If you feel something was done which contributed to your death and you are upset about it, please contact raid leader so that he or she can make the appropriate adjustments.<br>
<br>
10)  Protect the healers and EVACers.  Nuff said.<br>
<br>
11)  Have some fun.  Raiding is the ultimate experience in EQ.  It is the supreme test of group and individual abilities.  If you think of a way to improve the execution of the raid, DURING the raid, call a time out and speak with the raid leader.  There is no EQ &quot;high&quot; quite like kicking some butt in an uber-smooth raid.<br>
<br>
MISTMOORE:<br>
<br>
1)  All MOBS will attack you, regardless if you're level 48 and they are 25.  Be prepared to fight everything that you see.  Invis spells are useful when travelling from zone to camp and vice versa, though to be perfectly honest I'm not sure which ones work or don't work against which MOBS.  I've been attacked while camoed, and not attacked while camoed.  Anyone have some info on this?<br>
<br>
2)  If camping at the platform (castle entrance) WATCH the LEDGES.  It's not hard to drop off the ledge and find yourself in the midst of a bunch of unfriendly MOBS, at which point you can bring them back to raid or zone.  Either way, communicate to those who will be affected by the train, whether that's raid or the general zone.<br>
<br>
3)  Crowd control is extremely necessary here.  The puller will eventually show up on the doorstep with about 10 or so MOBS, and things will get hairy.  I know I was summoned more than once, including the last pull that did us in, with no real recourse but to bring the whole train out to the party.  The puller should make people aware of this (which I didn't) so that EVAC or the appropriate crowd control can be planned and executed in the moments before the fight begins.<br>
<br>
4)  Debuff is key in MM.  Many of the MOBS have damage shields.<br>
<br>
5)  Magic resistance (MR) should be maxed for puller and for other tanks who are wacking away.  Many powerful casters in MM.  I was nuked a few times for 300-400 hp, even with a 65 MR.<br>
<br>
CONCLUSION:<br>
<br>
It was a tough raid, but very useful I believe in terms of what we learned about raid techniques and general teamwork.  I'm glad that some of us got some quest drops, though I regret that Araegorne did not get the granite.  I believe we should do this raid again at first opporunity, and hopefully we can increase the guild turnout from good to great.<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone that participated, and my personal commendation on your dedication for enduring the various travails we encountered.  It's not easy to keep fighting after you've lost a yellow, but it speaks volumes when you do.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the ear.<br>
<br>

<br>
I would just like to add three parts,<br>
<br>
1. A big thank you to Vlieke, who turned up to participate and then took a leadership position to help organise everyone. I think this was a very selfless act on his part as it makes his evening's play somewhat tethered to everyones needs and he wasnt there to obtain anything - so big thanks.<br>
<br>
2. Big thanks to Kristen the Cleric, may soul travel the heavens. This poor lady was summoned to MM to find about a dozen sorry VF'ers sitting around in their underpants crying about their levels lost. She stayed with us for about an hour rezzing the hell out of every corpse she could see. What a dear.<br>
<br>
3. Everyone who turned up. Raid success or not - A whole bunch of people turned up to participate and help out - only a few needed something from MM and everyone just came along and pitched in.<br>
<br>
I certainly learnt a lot about raiding last night - and felt pity for Vlieke for having to herd what amounted to 15 or so bloodthirsty tourists.<br>
<br>
It is interesting what happens to very smart people in group dynamics. The need for simplicity and clear communication became evident. When you work as a group you can only implement the simplest ideas effectively and the need to listen to one person becomes paramount. It was also difficult for Vlieke because we had some non-guildies in groups so messages had to be relayed.<br>
<br>
I have so much respect for the patience and persistence of Vlieke in that position. Good job that man.<br>

Indeed a big thanks should be extended to Vlieke for taking the time to organize such an event, and more importantly to analyze it after.  Great work Vlieke!  You are making such an excellent Officer with your contributions to the guild via the boards and in the lands of Norrath!<br>
<br>
Great work all!  Glad to hear that success was met in many ways, and we will definitly try to get Area that drop as soon as we can!<br>

Take care,<br>

I feel muchly vindicated from my past experiences there, even after being &lt;i&gt;flambe'd&lt;/i&gt; by that mass of casters and that Gargoyle. (Over a 1000 hitpoints damage in less than 5 seconds) Kristen is indeed a goddess, and somehow her Rez not only redinged me, but gave me more XP than I had before I died and undinged. ??? I'm up for more of them, especially 5 levels from now. Once that Velium Mace starts to proc for the big damage, I'll finally start coming into myself as a useful group member to the guild. <p><b>::Arzt Pfusch::
