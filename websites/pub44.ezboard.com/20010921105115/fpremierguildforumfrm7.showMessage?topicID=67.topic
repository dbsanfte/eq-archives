You have the fucking best guild on Xegony, because all of you are friends. But sometimes Visc, you just don't know when to shut the hell up. You step on peoples feelings, blow them off, or just plain piss them off. And you don't care because it's funny to you. <br>

Ok kids shut the hell up both of you =P i think tens said it best when he said we are all friends here, no need for incesant bickering. Visc your a good man and i dont think you pushed anything too far but perhaps too often =P. We both know you do some things in the guild to piss ppl off but its all in fun and games and we often get you back. Which brings me to tens. Bro your awsome but you gotta start taking things a little less seriously, were all friends here, dont forget that. Which means when i call viscous a little dicked bitch it really is my way of expressing my appreciation. In other words dont let him annoy you just *SMACK* him or hit him back with a witty comment or something or other. In other words to the both of you SHUT THE HELL UP AND STOP BICKERING. Tens i hope you redecide your leaving the guild, i know its a bitch for me to reinvite all these people =P. After all if we are the best guild on xegony why are you leaving? I hope you come back =P peace all.<br>

Anyway i think Tens Brings up another Good point....if we have ppl leave then why are we chasing them all it will lead to is more anger and hate and shit! <br>
<br>
Hows this we make a pollicy where if someone Runs from the guild we Dont Beg them to come back....i am also Guilty of this because i begged Rakuum to Re-Join and all it did was lead to another disapointment! This guild is getting more &quot;Uber&quot; i guess is what you would say, but anyway we need to stop Giving the ppl the attention they want when they do the &quot;leave and return&quot; Strategy for getting attention! But i dont really care you may still want to Fuck me tens But i for one am not into that Kinky Butt sex thing /shiver<br>

Sorry to break your heart, but I don't go for that. If you want that, then you need to go to Vedan. He gives you rainbow armour for that, eh Visc? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Now that all that is said, let's move on to other things. Yes, leaving the guild was stupid for me. Was I running away? No. I was just pissed at Manty. And instead of typing /ignore Manty, i found it easier to type /guildremove. Mainly b/c I have so many farking people on my ignore list. Since then, I have had time to cool off and certain people talked to me and I have returned. Did I leave and return for attention? No. When I left I had no intention at all at returning until Pyr talked to me. Yes blame him for me coming back :P So if you don't like me being back in the guild Diin, just deal with it. B/c I don't like having Visc in the guild, but I have to deal with it. :P<br>
<br>
Oh, once again Visc, sorry for not ignoring Diin's post.<br>

Fuck you Diinidin&quot; Obviously you just wanted me ;P anyway Visc i am planning on attending your XA raid if youll let me (didnt sign up) But if i do go i can supply rezzes(56) in secs....friends cleric with epic is parked in Seb so if (before the raid) we run him to CoM zone then if there is some Horrible xps and we all die and you want to get the rezzing done in seconds then i can use the cleric!<br>
