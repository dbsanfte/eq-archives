<br>
Nienor, Raloth, Diora, Tisharmo, Taallon, Qin, Kemie and espeically Influenced for leading the effort. Thanks also go to Kyl, a high level duid friend of Kemie's who came along for the ride and watched over us while we were there.<br>
<br>
I almost didn't make the gathering myself, having woken up to a PC that stubbornly refused to load EQ. I tried everything I know to sort out this problem myself (it took all of 15 mins to try everything I could think of) in the end it was Tassius who sorted out the problem...and only having had 2 hours sleep himself after a rather long gaming session...so my thanks must go to him above all for making it possible for me to get there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The first dropped just as we arrived when Kylian in advance of us spotted and slew the spawn... took hours for the second one to show up though!<br>
<br>
I found this rather an interesting exercise in a &quot;mini-raid.&quot; Some of the chaos that reigned is evidently inevitable - took us forever to get to the gathering point of South Ro/Innothule Swamp... didn't help that some of us (Influe, Raloth and Kem) were in Kunark and had to get ourselves together first and with Kemie at her level could only tp in to WC for a very long run down, rather than the closer dru rings at SRo, where Diora and Eenera awaited us... And then once we arrived there, it dawned on us that Raloth and Influenced were still bound in Kunark! As it turned out, the long run BACK up to East FP to bind them was probably unnecessary (no one died or came close while the main group was there) but then again, even in a situation camping a spawn for a raid where you know many of the mobs will be green or blue, it is far wiser to be safe than sorry! And fortuitiously, returning to FP allowed us to add Qin to the party, which was very nice!<br>
<br>
We lost Eenera due to her phone call (and were sorry to see her go!) and some confusion was added when Kylian, lvl 54 wanderer who is an old acquaintance of mine, was having a boring and frustrating night elsewhere and asked me if he could come along and assist... I thought of the nice buffs he could provide <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and told him sure, but about that time my timer dinged and I had to camp and reset (being on my own computer instead of my daughter's) and neglected to inform the rest of the party of his offer, which led to some MORE confusion! (ouch! Sorry, all!)<br>
<br>
We had too many bodies to fit into one group, so Influenced had to split us into two small ones - he (ranger), Diora (druid), Nienor (enchanter) and Qin (cleric) in one; Raloth (monk), Gladriel (chanter), and Kemie (druid) in the other, with Kylian in the latter so he would be able to hear some of what was going on... Notice we were rather heavy on the casters and light on melee classes! <br>
<br>
It's rather hard to know how well we would have done had Kylian not showed up with his much higher level spells to assist us, but he wasn't re-casting buffs all the time and I think that this VF grouping would have worked quite well in this particular camp without him. To our surprise I think, quite a few of the mobs were blue to most of us, and if we were careful not to interfere with the other group's kill, there was even some experience to be had. Influenced did an EXCELLENT job pulling mobs from deeper in the tunnels while we sat around waiting for priest and prophet to pop. Kylian was kind enough to drop out of the second group so that we COULD get experience once in a while. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And once Tisharmo showed up, and Taallon, both presently at 40, I think it was demonstrated that raids like this one will present few problems (even if Taal DID get lost on the way in by himself <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). Qin and Influenced had to leave about the time Taal arrived, as did Kemie, but the rest remained to obtain at last the second rod. I know there was some sort of problem Taallon encountered leaving the place when he got mobbed by greens and nearly wiped out (OUCH!) and Tisharmo came to his rescue when Taal was  down to only single digit hp's, but don't know the story. I know I found myself wondering at the time, though, why you didn't teleport out, Taal! Hehe... can't think of everything, I guess. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
There are other items that drop in places like Lower Guk that some of us might be able to use, and quite frankly I think it may be a good place to practice raid skills if we want to plan another there. The experience gained from some kills was a bonus here, but not nearly as valuable as the experience we can acquire from even such simple problems as getting to a meeting at the same time, divvying up available bodies, and remembering such things as binding first and how we are going to leave or evacuate should it be necessary...<br>
<br>
Not to mention getting used to the chaos. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Thanks Glad for the opportunity, and everyone else who contributed to the experience.<br>

Good call Gals on LGuk as a practice raid place.  Let's do it, as there is good xp to be had there, plus some nice mobs.<br>
<br>
We can do things like raid the assassin/supplier who drops a nice dagger and 65% wt reducing bag.  There is an evil eye that drops the same type of bag.  There are casters and warrior types.  There is also the frenzy who drops the FBSS - 7k, something we'll be able to do as a guild very soon (not as one group). <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm16.showMessage?topicID=80.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm16.showMessage?topicID=72.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm16.emailToFriend?topicID=78.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm16.threadControl?topicID=78.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm16.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=78.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm16.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=78.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub44.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm20">General Forum<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm16">Gatherings of the Brave<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm25">Bazaar of the Brave<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm17">Tales and Roleplay<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm15">Questing<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm18">Honour Role <option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm19">Dishonourable Denizens<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm22">Guild Tavern<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm21">Officers Lounge<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm24">High Council Forum<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm23">Vault of the Brave</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8B4513>- </font><a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/beverquestersofnorrath>Discussions for the Brave</a><font color=#8B4513> - </font><a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm16>Gatherings of the Brave</a> <font color=#8B4513> - </font><a href="http://victusfortis.n3.net">Home of Victus Fortis</a><font color=#8B4513> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href=http://www.entercasino.com/main.cgi?refererID=502600>What's your game?
