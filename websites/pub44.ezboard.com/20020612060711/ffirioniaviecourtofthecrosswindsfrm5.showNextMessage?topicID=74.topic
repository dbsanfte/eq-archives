It is your choosing of my traveling companion, Shaylin, as an initiate into your Court that has made me circumspect.  Make no mistake, I am glad of this. That she will have support and aid in her travels and, should things turn foul, the help that I may not be able to provide, is reassuring.  Yet, suspicions are raised (I hope they do not extend to her), not the least of which concern the Guild to which I am currently allied.  So, the fewer words the better, not only to avoid dulling the ears of those listening, but for the safety of those around me.  I dare not reveal all, but the telling of that which is common knowledge, or what could be readily discovered by anyone with half a mind, should do no harm.<br><br>I was born near Qeynos.  There I lived my first few years in a large, comfortable house, on lands that provided an abundance of foodstuffs and game.  My mother was a jeweler, though with a seamstress's heart, for she joined cool, bright metals with sparkling gems much the way a tailor would weave colored threads into brilliant tapestries.  My father managed the lands and those who maintained it, overseeing the plantings and harvestings, and general business of the house.  To my young mind it seemed a good life, but it was not to last.  Sometime near my 8th year some kind of vermin began inhabiting the passages that lead through the mountains to the snow-covered lands and great city of Halas.  Travel became dangerous; trade all but ceased.  Animals sickened and died.  Rumors spread of great problems in other lands.<br><br>Many times visitors would arrive after dark, sometimes alone, sometimes accompanied by others who moved with the telltale sounds of armor.  They would talk late into the night, in whispered voices that barely carried through the house to my room, some in languages I had never heard.  By dawn they would be gone and no mention would be made of them.  Then one night there was again the sounds of horses approaching.  This time, instead of the quiet tapping on the door, there was a loud crash as it was battered in.  There were harsh voices shouting orders, sounds of furniture being thrown aside, heavy footsteps moving through the house.  I was barely half way from my bed to the door of my room when came a moment of silence followed by my father's voice.  I could picture him standing at the top of the staircase demanding to know who dare to so enter his house.  His voice, firm, outraged, was answered by another, muffled by the closed door.  Then his again, defiant, followed by a rush of feet, and my mother's screams.  I was reaching for the latch of my door when it was thrown open and I was knocked backward.  Before I could stand I was bound hand and foot, snatched up and thrown over the shoulder of a man I did not recognize.  All was darkness save for areas briefly illuminated by torches carried through the house by strange creatures.  One such scene was that of my father laying face down at the top of the stair, his lifeless arm stretched across my mother, as if trying to stop the blood flowing from the many wounds she had suffered.  I was carried down the stairs and dropped to the ground outside.  By that time, the upper floor of the house was already blazing brightly.<br><br>There was some argument nearby, not all the words of which could I understand.  Then I was grabbed by a couple of the creatures and taken to the city.  By passages I did not know, and sometimes through the sewers, we reached the docks.  I was traded to a grizzled seaman for a bag of coins,untied, but locked in the hold of the ship.  I was kept there, deep in grief beyond comprehension.  The ship sailed later that night.  When it reached land I was again tied, and traded once more, this time to a tall man covered in a hooded robe.  From there he took me into a wooded area where he met a few others, and I was dumped into a horse-drawn wagon.  There were three similarly bound; two boys and a girl, laying on molding straw.  I tried to speak to them, but a clout to my head discouraged me.<br><br>We had traveled for hours deep into the forest, then the man who guided the horse stopped abruptly.  Ahead was the sound of a lute and singing.  The men spoke quickly, then started again in a different direction.  They had not gone far when figures appeared in front of them.  The men who had taken me drew swords and tried to run, but they found their way blocked on all sides.  It was over quickly.  One of the strangers spoke softly to the horse, then they walked toward the music, the animal following behind.<br><br>It was the festival of Samhuiin, and Druids were gathered in celebration.  Some had come from the distant Mother Grove; Bards to sing the ancient songs and to learn of news to put into song for those at home, Ovates to tell of the things to come, and high priests to tend to the needs in the far-flung Groves.  Each of us was lifted from the wagon, gently tended to, given hot broth, and laid to sleep on soft bedding near the warm bonfire.  At the end of the festival, we were taken to a great tree city.  We were spoken for by many; I, myself, was given a home with the family Silverwolf.  They raised me well, especially considering the difficulties I constantly presented them.  I began to follow, somewhat clumsily, the teachings of the Druids.  Many found the idea of a human Druid a curiosity at least.<br><br>When I reached my 14th ring I determined to leave, though not without some debate, to find answers to what had happened that night now years before.  Traveling through High Pass I chanced upon an ogre losing ground to a party of orcs.  Given that orcs resolutely seek carnage, while ogres ally with whomever provides their next meal, I aided the big ugly.  It was a fortuitous decision, for he was leader of Soldiers of Chaos and loudly overcame any objections to my joining.  At first, I was able to gain information, though much regarding general matters, but some specific to the time and area in which I was most interested.  Now, however, it is becoming a great liability.  Eyes glare, especially from the Dark Elves, and I must walk carefully.  Soon I will have to disavow myself from them, though by some innocuous means.  Perhaps some petty disagreement about the ogre's insidious habit of scratching themselves.  If that goes well, then perhaps Shaylin and I will be able to travel safely.  If not, then I fear there will be much danger.<br><br>Humbly,<br><br>Araging Silverwolf <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/bfirioniaviecourtofthecrosswinds.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=shaylin>Shaylin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member of the Court</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#DAA520>(5/27/02 7:34:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/ffirioniaviecourtofthecrosswindsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A descretionary note</span><hr size=1> I beg of the Court to help me find my dear friend, Araging.
