<br>
Day before yesterday, once again tired of killing snakes outside of Freeport, she found herself studying the structure of the gates in East Freeport and wondering if there were secret entrances to the main floor space under them, as no entry was obvious.  Now, I DO have maps of Freeport courtesy of EQ Atlas, one of which shows the Freeport underground, but it was MUCH more fun just poking around and exploring to see if I could find a way in by smarts alone...<br>
<br>
In due time I found a wall outside that was not as solid as it appeared, and entered into a narrow steep passage leading downward.  Not being entirely stupid and knowing the dark reputation of such underground ways, I immediately cast camo upon myself before proceeding.  In a short time I entered a somewhat circular chamber with tunnels exiting both right and left, and decided to go left.  Not far into that way, I hit a zone into West Freeport and followed the winding ways far enough to go through numerous holes in the wall and past people and up to running water (which I did not enter) and recast camo as needed and eventually headed back to the initial chamber.<br>
<br>
I knew somewhere in the direction of the right-hand passage was the waterfront, with a &quot;secret entrance&quot; somewhere under the docks. I soon came to a fork, and choosing the one I thought most likely to emerge at the waterline, proceeded.  Chancing upon a group of NPC's standing around, I proceeded cautiously, peeking into doors and had come to the conclusion these were the dark race trainers etc. I had heard of, when all of a sudden my camo failed and *SMACK* &quot;Mheno Raveus hits you for 328 points of damage.&quot; *CRUNCH* &quot;Mheno Raveus hits you for 328 points of damage.&quot; (AGAIN!) *KABOOM* &quot;Xehla Nevagon hits you for 345 points of damage.&quot;  My eye was caught by some odd reference to Tumpy Irontoes up above when I realized my screen had hit &quot;LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...&quot;<br>
<br>
Ahem... I woke up in Halas. *BLUSH*  Hehe... Ordained and Galadria had been up for a visit to Permafrost looking for an ice goblin totem and wisely bound her there, but of course there was no danger on our return to the environs of Freeport for Guild Help Day, so... like I said, I woke up in Halas, shivering naked!<br>
<br>
I've only visited that area a couple of times (and seem to remember the LAST time I was bound up there I also managed to die clear across the world), and was dreading having to fetch out my maps and make that long, long run. Aredhel being on at the time offered in guild chat to assist with a ride in a short while when he could get free, but I knew the wait would be a terribly long one as he could only teleport to Toxx or North Karana and one or the other of us would have a long run still before we could meet up.<br>
<br>
I had memmed my spells and buffed myself and stood up trying to decide if I should venture into Halas proper with the aid of a map and try to find a bank, when Balane, a level 22 warrior of the guild Chosen of Norrath, very politely asked me if I could spare her a SoW for a corpse run. Well of course I did. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  On hearing I was not familiar with the area and was on a much longer run herself, this kind Human offered to guide me out to Qeynos Hills, and even to fetch a torch for me if I wanted one.  I declined the torch, having some skill at spells that would aid my vision (already better than that of a human anyway), but gratefully accepted her offer of a guide. In a REMARKABLY short time, the two of us were standing in Qeynos Hills.<br>
<br>
Now I realize that guiding someone through a couple of zones to help out is not unusual, but Balane went out of her way for me, and as it turned out, her corpse lay somewhere in the direction of Permafrost instead of down in the Qeynos Hills area at all, as for some reason I had assumed it was. So she REALLY went out of her way. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   She lent me a couple of waters (as I was foraging only food for some reason) and happily saw me safely on my way before heading back to Everfrost.  I was able to make the run from there to North Karana and meet Aredhel for a ride the rest of the way to Freeport, and it was all so very nicely easy thanks to this kind and gracious warrior, Balane.<br>
