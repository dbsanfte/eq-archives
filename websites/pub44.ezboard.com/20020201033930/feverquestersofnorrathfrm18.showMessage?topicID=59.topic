<br>
    Last night I was in SK working on my casting skills near the LR zone.  I got lonely so I decided to go see Kemie and Influenced who were fighting gnolls near the enterance to Paw.  I sat there, annoying them to no end, I am sure, with my endless casting, and watched as inumerable gnolls fell dead by their feet.  We heard a warning that undead gnolls were rising in Paw to avenge their deaths.  &quot;Are they coming out?&quot; we asked eachother, and Kemie offered to teleport us all out just in case.  But we were assured by others in the guild that no harm would come to us (you know who you are <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ), and there we stayed. <br>
   <br>
     Moments later as I watched Kemie and Influe easily cutting down yet another Tesch Mas gnoll, I was suddenly struck by a frost rift doing 210 points of damage to me. Before I could turn around, my skin ignited doing 250 points of damage. I turned to see a line of freakishly gruesome undead gnolls spewing out of the Lair of Splitpaw, coming towards us as if to all have their turn.  I sent Kemie a telepathic message (yelled around the corner &quot;Aaaaaaa! They were wrong!! They came out!! RUUUUNNNN!!!!&quot; ) Then headed for the zone, not knowing if it would be safe INside Paw or not.  Unfortunately I could not send such a message to Influenced, as in my panic all I could do was try to get away.  Kemie was following fairly close behind me but poor Influenced was rooted and snared (to add insult to injury I suppose) and slain at the decaying hands of these foul creatures.  <br>
   <br>
    Once inside Paw, Kemie realized that Influenced for some reason, had popped up in Freeport as opposed to the Arena where he was bound... So Kemie healed herself up and teleported herself off to west commons to collect him.  I decided to venture back out and see if I could find a cleric to do at least a partial rez on Influe.  I shouted, asking if there was anyone who could do a rez. The only response I received was &quot; there might be some in Lake Rathe doing their epic&quot;  So I headed out that way, seeing many undead gnolls still on my tracking and ran as fast as I could for Lake Rathe.  But alas, it was night and raining, and even being a ranger, in a situation like that it is easy to miss your turn.  I ended up wandering past the zone and didnt find my way till it had stopped raining.  <br>
    <br>
    I finally found my way only to discover that there were no clerics in that zone either. I finally decided I would just do a who cleric all and see what I could find. There wasnt much anywhere close so I changed my tactics. I started with a &quot;who 40 cleric all&quot; then a &quot;who 41 cleric all&quot;  I continued on this way, and when I found one that was in a zone near one of Kemie's teleport areas I sent a tell. &quot;If we tp you and pay you well, can you come to SK and do a rez please?&quot;  Many were not answered at all and some were answered rudely. I began to get discouraged.  <br>
    <br>
    Finally on &quot;who 57 cleric all&quot; I came up with Klind, a 57 dwarf Templar who was in east commons.  I sent him a tell, and it took him a moment but he came back with &quot;If you get me a tp it's NP <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   &quot;  Hooray! So I put him in touch with Kemie, and Influe began dragging his corpse toward the bridge, and I ventured out of Lake Rathe to run all the way across the zone to meet them all at the bridge.  Klind and Kemie came running in and the handsome dwarf in beautiful purple armor quickly rezzed Influenced.  I tried to give him 93 plat but he refused my money saying &quot;Sorry, I don't take bribes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   &quot;  Then, after hearing of the undead scourge, he shouted to the zone, &quot;If you need a rez I will be here for 10 mins, Please drag your body to the bridge&quot; What a great guy!!  He ended up rezzing 2 more people who had fallen to the undead gnolls. First, one Nikaii, a 43 ranger from the Ceilidh guild and a few minutes later, Dracbishop, a 31 druid of Blood Casters. Both tried to pay him I believe, and both times he refused. He stayed a few more minutes and then with a hug and a wave goodbye, he gated himself back to east commons.<br>
<br>
So, Klind Delacroix of Sacred Valor, if you are out there I commend you for the time you took to help us all, without pay or compensation of any sort. Norrath needs more people like you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Bless you, Klind, should you visit us here (I did inform this kind dwarf that we would so honor him on our site - would you believe that in spite of what has evidently been a career of 57 seasons as a selfless cleric, no one has ever done more than thank this fellow in the past?

He WOULD have resurrected all four who died quite willingly, but Renn had already logged and Blake chose to decline the offer and take the experience loss...<br>
<br>
Once again, Klind refused any offer of payment, asking only that Kemie fetch him and return him to North Karana. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Hehe... by now he has noticed that we seem not to have too many clerics in our guild! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   At the rate we are going, we shall have to &quot;officially&quot; adopt the heroic Klind or do a much better job of supporting our own, as Rennigin was the first to die!<br>
<br>
At any rate, I think we owe Klind big time.  Both Raynn and I assured him that if he EVER needs assistance from Victus Fortis for anything - on raids or quests or any other kind of favor - he should feel free to ask. He is truly one of the very best people I have met in the lands of Norrath or anywhere else.<br>
