To join our guild a few precautions must be made to ensure the precious environment within the guild that we have so painstakingly created. These methods are for the benefit of both the guild and the individual applying to join our ranks.<br>
It should be noted that our guild is against excessive power leveling and twinking, as well as item farming, ninja looting, kill stealing, and general disrespect to those who journey the lands of Norrath. If you are into those sort of things then this guild is probably not the best choice for you unless you want to explore a new way to play.<br>
<br>
We strive to respect one another and those we play with, to play the game honourably and with compassion. We help all those we can when we can, and value companionship above all other aspects of the game. Further, we have no designs on becoming the biggest most powerful guild on the server with tons of members, we like to remain small and close. We shall achieve big things such as raids by accompanying our allies. If you are of like mind, have read the Charter and Rules and Policies, then please read on.<br>
<br>
Meeting someone in the game:<br>
<br>
Step 1: If we meet someone in the game that we feel would fit our family well, we should do our best to attempt to group with them several more times. If our findings hold true, an officer should be consulted and should try to meet with the player and hopefully group. <br>
<br>
Step 2: If both concur that this member is a valid candidate then that person should be directed to our web page to read over our charter and rules and policies. After doing so, if the candidate is still interested s/he should then go to the message board to make an introduction as well as give basic character information: race, class, level, and zone or area currently adventuring in. Feel free to include any other information, like a short story of your characters early life or of adventures you have had.<br>
<br>
Step 3: If someone is directed to the website then that basically means that both members who have met this persona are in agreement that they would make a good addition to our guild. If the candidate has posted, that should be indicative that they are still interested. At this point a membership officer would then reply to the post and set up a time that they could meet so that he may activate the guild tag.<br>
<br>
Note: It is important to note that when you suggest someone to join you are taking on a role as their sponsor. While it is impossible to know a person completely, the sponsor is taking some responsibility over the validity of character and the actions of those they suggest and support in joining our guild. If something goes wrong, there would be no real action taken unless extreme circumstances, but when suggesting someone to join the sponsor should take note of this in order to ensure that they only request those who are truly worthy, and that they take the time needed to get to know them well.<br>
<br>
Meeting us through other means:<br>
<br>
Step 1: If you have found us on the net or heard of us through a friend, there is a slightly different process to joining the guild. In case you have found us under these circumstances, and are interested in joining, you should post a message on our board and give basic character information: race, class, level, and zone or area currently hanging out in. Feel free to include any other information, like a short story of your characters early life or of adventures you have had.<br>
<br>
Step 2: At that point at least one officer or member will respond and request to meet you in game. They will want to adventure with you a few times, so please be patient. They will most likely try to set up a group with you and a few other members of the guild. This is for the benefit of both parties involved, as it lets both sides judge on whether or not they would be a good fit. <br>
<br>
Step 3: Then, after this is completed, and it is still felt you are a good candidate for our guild, you should reply to your original thread to say that you are still interested. From there an officer will meet with you and tag you as a member of our guild.<br>
<br>
GENERAL RULES<br>
Violations of the guild rules and policies are met with all seriousness. Investigations will be made and actions taken based upon the seriousness of the crime and allegations. For many rules, a warning will be given. A second infraction may result in a probation period or removal from the guild. These rules and policies are in place for the protection of the guild and it's members, as well as the good-standing reputation we have so painstakingly worked for. In all my on-line gaming experience (almost three years worth) I have only seen extreme actions taken twice. I am confident in the members of this guild that these rules will never be used, and I sincerely hope that they collect as much dust as possible. Also, these rules should not infringe on anyone who plays the game with honour, compassion, and respect towards others. <br>
<br>
If you are ever in a group that violates these rules, such as kill or camp stealing, then you should politely ask your group to stop. If they do not stop, you should apologize to the people that are being offended by your group and promptly leave the group. Let the group that has been slighted by these actions know you are extremely sorry, have left the group, and offer compensation if possible. This can go a long way to show others that you and our guild is true to its charter and should help make sure that we are respected by most all throughout Norrath.<br>
<br>
If you witness a guild member breaking these rules, please ask them if they are aware of what they are doing and request that they stop. Do so in a private manner. If they refuse or you catch them doing it again please contact a guild officer, again in a private manner. An investigation will be made and action taken.<br>
<br>
Virtue: Respect. Honour. Compassion. Honesty. Compassion. Dignity. Altruism (selflessness). These are the virtues all members of this guild swear to uphold. They are considered to be more than views on life, but to be the motivation behind all our actions. Never should there be a time when dealing with members of this guild, or those who share the lands of Norrath with us, that these virtues are disregarded. With these virtues one gains the companionship and respect of all others in the guild and most of those around us. Many situations may arise that challenge these virtues, but if one holds true to them and acts in a noble manner, they will be respected even more and rewarded knowing they stayed true to their friends and guild. Such a reward is invaluable. If there is any question about these virtues, then please consult another member to their meaning. If at any point in the game we are unsure how to proceed, especially in the face of conflict, please speak with someone else and get advise on how to proceed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Twinking: No one in the guild should engage in excessive twinking, nor be expected to by other members. While giving gifts and a few items to friends or newer members is fine, it should not be taken to an extensive degree. This is to prevent people from having the expectations that if they join the guild they will be given tons of items, and to promote others to earn their items, spells, weapons, and armour. By twinking people to this extent you are robbing them of the pride and gratification of earning their items through hard work and dedication. There are a few exceptions to this rule, such as inviting a friend to the server and guild who would like to play the same type of character, and has accomplished the tasks of earning the items given. Asking a level 50 wizard to start from nothing is not something that we should ask anyone to do. What we do with our secondary characters is up to us, but it should be noted that rolling on an item for your twink is extremely bad character. If that secondary character is tagged with our guild name, there should be no excessive twinking as it makes the guild look bad, which shows a lack of respect to the guild. Even though a definition of twinking is hard pressed to come by, we all know what excessive twinking is. No one should ever ask to be twinked.<br>
<br>
Powerleveling: As with twinking, powerleveling to excessive means is prohibited. A level 40 member of the guild taking a level 10 out and helping him by any means other than advice (heals, buffs, partially killing creatures) so that the lower person gains several levels in one night is also robbing that character of working hard and earning their standing in the realm. Several other side effects can take place as well. Someone new to the game with a high level character lacks the game experience needed to group in some of the more difficult areas, as well as lack of understanding about their class and abilities. This can be more harm to the all involved as the powerleveled, and can result in many deaths, a lack of respect, and a bad name for that character and the guild. As with twinking, the same exceptions apply. Asking that friend who gave up a level 50 wizard to tough it out and level normally is torturous for him. Also, if a member of the guild is close to a level or has fallen a few levels behind his closest friends, then a little help may be in order. However, no one should ever ask to be powerleveled.<br>
<br>
Kill Stealing: Never should anyone in the guild kill steal. If you do so by accident quickly apologize and if loot is taken it should be returned immediately. There will only ever be one warning to those who purposely kill steal.<br>
<br>
Ninja Looting: This is defined by quickly looting the fallen creatures while in the group, and keeping the loot for yourself. It is also defined by not following the looting rues of the group and looting a creature after the three minute timer that is still attended by the person who killed it. Sometimes a no drop item is on a creature, and the killer of said creature is waiting for someone to get there to loot it. Always ask. If you loot by accident, return the item immediately and apologize. Again, one warning.<br>
<br>
Camp Stealing: If we come across a small group camping and area for a quest or item then we should make sure to leave it to the people who are already there. Instead, ask that the group leader send you a tell when they are done and go back. If it is a large area, like some dungeon rooms or floors, then make sure to stay out of the already present groups way. Some places can be camped by up to four groups without any interference needed. If it is a one creature camp, that has an extremely rare drop (such as Ghoulbane, the first Holy Sword for paladins) then abide by the zone rules that have been set up. Go on a list and wait your turn. If any conflicts arise, handle them diplomatically. Never resort to name calling and disrespecting others. If it can't be worked out, and there is much time involved in setting up the group for the camp (such as Ghoulbane <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  then it may be needed for a Guide or GM to get involved. If it was a pick up group and you have been there 10 minutes then maybe just leaving would be in order.<br>
<br>
Item Farming: Many times we come across people in the game who try to camp rare items for the sole purpose of selling them. Again, Ghoulbane is one of the more popularly farmed items. As it is paladin only, a competitive camp, and is not NO DROP many people try to aquire this items so that they may sell it (it goes from 1.5-2k pp!). Often stealing the kill to get the item. Class or race only armour, and many spells, are subject to this as well. This is a serious crime. Not many realize, or care, that a wizard may have been trying to attain the spell that drops off of a difficult creature to kill for days even weeks. Or that it took major planning to get his group together to help him gain his coveted prize. If by chance you are wandering by and come across a situation like this when no one is around, then by all means take the kill and the item. While we can not tell you what to do with that item, maybe offering it to a guild member at a reduced price or for free is an extremely good gesture and will likely be returned to you when that member comes across a valuable item that you need. Unless of course you need the item, then by all means use it. <br>
<br>
<br>
Conflict: Should conflict arise between guild members all efforts should be made between the conflicting parties to resolve their differences on their own, in private. If extreme anger is involved, then the situation should be left until both parties calm down some. All conflicts should be dealt with understanding and respect to one another, and the guild. Public outbursts, name calling, and immature acts are considered bad form and depending on the situation there may be actions taken by the High Council in event that they do occur. If a situation can not be resolved between the two parties, then consult the officer in charge of dealing with conflict only. If the situation remains unsolved, then the officer shall take it to the rest of the High Council and it will be discussed. That officer will then take the solution back to the members. The decision of the High Council will be considered law, but the reasoning will always be explained unless circumstances dictate otherwise. If further arguments in the situation arise, or you feel the decision is unjust, you may contact the guild leader. However, this should only happen if the offended party has a strong, intelligent argument why they have been slighted in this case. The decision of the leader will be final.<br>
<br>
Looting: When grouping with members and others in the game, and attending raids, one should always inquire to the looting rules that apply to the situation. Once informed, none shall ever intentionally break the looting rules. If there is an accidental violation then there should be a quick apology and all efforts should be made to appease your group. If you have unknowingly looted a NO DROP item then please discuss with the group how you can make up for it, and when an acceptable solution is resolved it is your duty to comply with the solution as quickly as possible. Picking up an item off a corpse in battle is not accidental looting.<br>
<br>
Some looting rules include:<br>
<br>
FFA: Free For All. Some groups prefer to loot as they see fit. The first person to access the corpse gets the loot. This can be cutthroat, but be sure that as a member of the guild you do not partake in looting while a battle still wages on. This shows disrespect to your group. Even still in this situation members of this guild should have autosplit on, even if no one else has. It is good character, and can inspire others to do so as well. If it gets too competitive and you find that you are being cheated or that it is too hectic, ask politely if they will change the looting rules. If not, by all means feel free to leave the group.<br>
<br>
Honourable FFA: This is the most common type of looting. Basically, everyone is allowed to loot corpses. Autosplit is most commonly on in this set up. Any items that you come across should be shared. If you are a warrior and loot a spell, it should go to any caster in the group who can use it, rolled on if there is more than one. Never keep an item another group member needs that you already have or can not use. All items that several people in the group need are rolled on. Bow out of rolls if you do not need or already have the item.<br>
<br>
Alpha-Looting: The leader will appoint who loots the corpses based on alphabetic order. Sometimes we accidentally loot in battle (the coins anyway), if this be the case apologize and skip your next turn. Again, autosplit is commonly on. If it is your turn and you loot a corpse with an item you do not need or can not use, then offer it to someone who can. If it is a NO DROP item then inform the group that it is there, and do not loot it.<br>
<br>
Leader-Looting: In this situation the leader of the group will loot all corpses. This takes a certain amount of trust to pull off, and is usually reserved for raids or a group that is after a rare drop. Sometimes it is initiated when a member of the group takes to minor ninja-looting or there are complaints about the looting situation. The leader will usually have autosplit off, and when someone leaves the group he will use the /split command. (/split 0 0 0 0 where each number is equal to the coins he looted, in order of PP GP SP CP) The leader will often use the /split command if they have been fighting for a while and a new member joins the group. As for items, the leader will usually disperse them to the party upon need, based mainly on who can gain the most use out of the item (i.e.: that warrior only sword goes to the warrior or the magic weapon goes to someone who doesn't have one). If more than one person needs the item, there is usually a roll.<br>
<br>
While the looting techniques when with groups will change from time to time, there are some general rules that need to be followed by guild members when playing. First and foremost is need before greed. Wanting an item for your twink is NOT a need. Never take items that you don't need, unless no one else in the group has use for it and it is offered to you. Please, if you have no use for an item, decline to roll on it so that others in who need the item have a better chance of getting it. If you get an item you do not need, please offer it to guild members before you pass it to your twink. If it is an extremely valuable item then offer to sell it to members at a reduced cost first. Any acts of kindness regarding loot will more than likely be, or have been, extended to you many times. We should always have /autosplit on unless the group has asked otherwise.<br>
<br>
Other: We reserve the right to add other rules, or change the current rules if the need to do so arises. All members will be informed on any changes.<br>

Becoming a Member<br>
Looting Policy<br>
Code of Conduct<br>
General Rules<br>
<br>
That should help people understand it better, and I hope it will make them all less imposing instead of saying &quot;rules&quot; as rules gives the impression of laws and that they should be feared.  Maybe I am reading too much into it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Also, there was some concern shared on the mailing list that people thought they might not be living up to the rules.  Remember, these rules are mainly common sense and are followed by all honourable people without much effort.  We all make mistakes, we all learn from our mistakes.  It comes with being a human.  They are in place to protect us from bad members, and will rarely if ever be invoked.  I have never witnessed one of us breaking these rules.<br>
<br>
Anyway, just try not to see them as &quot;strict unflexable laws written in stone&quot; just as a guide.<br>

Be well,<br>
