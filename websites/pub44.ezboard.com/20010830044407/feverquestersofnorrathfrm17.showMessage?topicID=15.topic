Raynn was the eldest child of my departed mother, and after my father left us for the wars and Kemie's mother vanished, Raynn had the raising of us all. We were very close in our younger years in Greater Faydark, where she taught me all she knew of the tricks of survival on Orc Hill and in the dark depths of Crushbone, and when I turned 15 seasons she took me overseas to fight in Highpass Hold. A handful of you - Blakeley, Thoran, Tisharmo and Armonico, met Raynn and I first in those adventurous years.  She was a fearsome fighter but kind and generous, and I was proud to take her as my model. But I saw less and less of her as the seasons passed and our ways divurged.<br>
     The goodness of her heart prompted Raynn to take in Lorelin, the human child who was orphaned in a dastardly orc attack upon an isolated village in Faydwer which killed not only her traveling parents but the entire population.  We were happy to add her to our family in spite of her differing heritage, and Raynn was more mother to her than sister.  But as she grew older and began to see more of the world as a bard, young Lorelin began to fret and wanted to learn more about her roots and possibly discover other relatives in the greater world. About the time that Raynn hit her 19th or 20th season, she and Lorelin, then in her 11th, set off from the Kaladim docks bound for Antonica and Freeport, and that was the last word we had of them for a long time…<br>
     Something darkly evil befell the two of them, but we do not know ourselves what happened. Kemie came one day upon Raynn wandering lost in the woods near Kelethin as one new-born, weak as a kitten and suffering some form of amnesia which left her bereft of all her skills and spells. After sending word to me in the Karanas, Kemie did her best to nurse her half-sister back to health and help her begin again her training as a ranger. Raynn either could not or would not speak of what had happened.<br>
     By the time I arrived to take over, Raynn had regained the competence of one in her 5th season. With the assistance of guildmates Tisharmo and Blakeley and Raloth and Inouva, I set about advancing her progress to the 8th on the fringes of Greater Faydark near Crushbone, and she was welcomed joyously into the guild. I am afraid the celebratory drinking grew quite heavy that night, and perhaps I should not have given so freely to the others the fruits of my recent brewing mastery. After the others left, Tisharmo persuaded me to accompany him with Raynn into the depths of Lesser Faydark where hunting the Nybright sisters would give her more experience. Raynn was reluctant to go, some shadowy memory of the risks remaining to her.<br>
     We were fine until someone trained the dark elf camp past us, shouting ahead to warn us so that we moved away deeper into the uncharted forest. Tisharmo cast a spell of invisibility upon us and we would soon have been able to resume our hunting, but I saw Thistle Underbrush and could not resist tracking him and the others were forced to follow in my wake. Thistle was further away than I expected and soon the spell wore off and I appeared to view again, and Tisharmo soon afterwards. He had not had a chance to recover enough mana to recast, and urging me to stop he sat down briefly to meditate. I had my back to him, eager to resume pursuit of Thistle. Due to my negligence, disaster struck! A brownie scout appeared and slew Tisharmo as Raynn looked on in horror, and as I turned to defend my sister, slew me as well…<br>
     Raynn with the strength of a mere 8 seasons was left alone in the middle of Lfay with our corpses, still invisible, but the spell was wearing thin and the brownies would not leave the scene. When it failed she quickly hid in terror, just in time. She sent a distress call to Blakeley who was yet in Kelethin and he came swiftly, but the wicked brownies attacked as soon as he arrived, slaying him in turn. All three of us had neglected to rebind on our return home - Tisharmo and I awoke to find ourselves in Highpass, and Blakeley in Kunark, and we were all frought with worry and concern over poor Raynn's fate without us.<br>
     Somehow Raynn though terrified found the memory and strength and courage within herself to do what should be done.  She found one Caex Stormseeker of The Chosen Clan who agreed to resurrect us if our bodies could be dragged to the pass into Gfay, and courageously dragged Blakeley's body thither before setting off back to the ugly scene of our deaths to fetch Tisharmo's. Meanwhile Tisharmo's relative Elwoodd in his 12th season as a druid arrived on the scene to drag mine, and shortly afterwards young Kilthanis of the 4th season and in the Wraithlore clan came too, in case he could render some assistance. As I was teleporting from Rivervale to Steamfont through the courtesy of Sodak Krazeewolf of Dragons Alliance, Elwoodd too was slain and Kilthanis bravely retrieved the fourth and final corpse. The courage and daring of these two - Raynn in her 8th season and Kilthanis in his 4th - in aiding those of us of greater seasons, was truly heroic as Caex (who kindly resurrected us for Raynn without charge) so nobly pointed out. Truly I am fortunate to have such a sister! <br>
     I can only hope that as more time passes she will fully recover and relate to us what happened to her and to Lorelin to cause such grievous wounds. Of Lorelin there has as yet been no sign. We yet hope, as she is human, that some sighting of her may occur in Freeport perhaps, or that we will hear some word of her there soon.<br>
