<br>
Moving with the sure step of seasons of battles fought and won, of campaigns waged, and sieges raised.<br>
<br>
Forming a rough arrow head formation we advance, all 6 of us to the main gate of the keep. The defenders on the walls fighting back the tides of goblins swarming up the ladders, throwing boiling pitch down onto the hideous faces of the aggressors and Warriors.<br>
<br>
The gate would give, we knew it the moment we had cast eyes on the fortifications - and there we would be the merecenaries, 'Deaths Shadow' the lucky 6, taking the charge of the hoard at its strongest. <br>
<br>
We formed our group, spreading apart enough for each other to swing our blades, automatically giving each other room to move. Baltor as always at the lead, the point of the arrow, humming his battle chant in time with his breathing, Tassius and I flanking him on left and right, we had been members of this group for 2 seasons now, we began to breathe in unison with Baltor, unconsciously and with respect. On my right was Silverthorn, rogue, liar and friend - wry smile on his face as he balanced on the balls of his feet, eager and deadly.<br>
<br>
To Tassius's left Zandak, Wolfriend and shifter, revelling in her wolf form, quick as the night, proud as steal and twice as sharp.<br>
<br>
Behind us all sheltered from the heat of the fight stood The Shadow, robed and hooded - our mage and our namesake, hands glowing with Mana energy as the Mystic sheild snapped up about us.<br>
<br>
Baltor's Humming changed a note, instantly swords and axes hissed from scabbards,`mighty broadswords for Baltor and Tassius, Zandak a force of claws and Teeth, My twin blades blurred as they sang from their sheaths, Silverthorn bristled with Daggers, and The Shadow remained still.<br>
<br>
'Shield Up' The Mage called from behind us, this was going to be grim as the Gate burst inward and the wave of Green skinned bile rushed though the gate.<br>
<br>
'With me Shadow' Baltor shouted over the rending of the gate, stepping as one we moved to the portcullis to engage and to dance our song for life.<br>
<br>
Baltor crashed into the lead Warlord, with a spiked shoulder he bashed into the face of the goblin and slashed  mightily across the chest of an attacker to his right. Wrenching his blade free he punched the face of the Goblin he had spiked and 2 were down.<br>
<br>
Tassius, dressed in steal, layed about him to left and right cutting a swathe through muscle and bone that could not be stopped, in the tight confines of the portcullis these two were Death, not in shadow - Tassius steal armour shining like the sun, and Baltor's painted face a rictus beam of sheer hatred and rage.<br>
<br>
Zandak and I, quick and precise, covering for Baltor and Tassius on their back swings, hamstringing here, cutting there, engaging the skirmishers. Striking both right and left with twin swords and twin claws, covering our flanks.<br>
<br>
Silverthorn, guard duty for The Shadow, a dagger in each hand watching for any that would get through to theaten The Shadow, whose sheild was glowing now as spell after spell from the Goblin casters was repulsed. Still hooded and wrapped in his cloak, he was unaware of the Warlord that pushed aside Tassius stroke with his shield and slashing upward towards Zandak was through, and facing our mage. <br>
<br>
Zandak was engaged again immediately so could do nothing. I snarled 'Mage Guard' over my shoulder and grunted as a serrated blade cut across my right thigh.<br>
<br>
Automatically Baltor switched stance and swung a horizontal cut across my head decapitating the Gobling about to skewer me. Regaining my feet blades whirling with renewed adrenalin I took the axe of a Brawler on one blade and thrust the other deep into its eye socket to cover Baltor's back, the pattern shifted back to normal, and we pressed the Goblins back into the Killing zone.<br>
<br>
Silverthorn behind us had sprang to life, The Shadow now behind him guarded by his body and steal. A slash upwards with one hand and a feint with the other and he sprang back.<br>
<br>
The Warlord looked at the hairline scratchs with contempt and swung a viscous scimitar at the hooded and now trembling figure of The Shadow. The look turned to a rictus grin as his flesh burst from the inside, skin flaying away, the monster dropped to its knees and gargled on its own bile as it died - the poison on Silverthorn's blades eating the warlord from the inside out.<br>
<br>
The press of Goblins was less, but the intervals between swings for both Baltor and Tassius were growing longer, I could feel Baltor's breath coming in ragged gasps, and see Sweat covering Tassius face under his helm. Zandak and I had to work harder to fill the gaps, diving between the big men, and engaging more and more ourselves.<br>
<br>
'Healing Baltor' The Mage chanted from behind me, and dashing by me on my right side, Silverthorn struck at arm, neck and leg - quick and poisonous as a snake. Baltor shook his head and lifted his head and bellowed a war cry<br>
<br>
'Press' he shouted, and we pushed forward. Baltor with renewed vigor and shining from an inner mana glow he slashed deep into the heart of the remaing hoard, we followed as always.<br>
<br>
Tassius spread his arms wide and prayed, his father's sword Burst into flame engulfing his arm and driving the hideous faces to cower from him in fright and pain. Refreshed from his prayer Tassius cut the mass before him like wheat, pounding all before him to the ground.<br>
<br>
Zandak howled her fury and clawed and bit left and right, the sinew and muscle under her wolf form bunching and stretching with the power of nature.<br>
<br>
The re-inforcements were in time to see the end, in time to see Deaths Shadow approach from behind the group of bleeding fighters, in time to see the fighters part in fore knowledge of what was to come, what had come so often before.<br>
<br>
Forming our circle around The Shadow, Silverthorn innermost, we stood on guard.<br>
<br>
'Shadow' The mage whispered. The silence was deafening. The unheard noise of onrushing death. It swept across the Killing ground as a dark wall, it brough panic and it was brief. Everything it touched was drained of life, then was gone.<br>
<br>
Silverthorn was there, as he always was, when the Mana charge ran dry, and The Shadow collapsed. <br>
<br>
The quiet whisper of 'The Shadow' swept through the crowd. We formed our guard. Ranger to lead, Rogue carrying the Mage; Warrior, Paladin and Druid for Guard.<br>
<br>
We were the six, 'Deaths Shadow', we bring death. <p>Semdayen Maa'Sankari<Br>Ranger of the 21st Season<Br>In the Service of Tunare<Br><Br>'I am not lost - this is the scenic route'
