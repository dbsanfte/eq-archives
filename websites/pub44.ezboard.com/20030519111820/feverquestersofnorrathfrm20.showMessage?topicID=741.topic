<br>
Kemie hit grandmaster in pottery last night, and ended the evening at 202.  It's been a long, long haul, and I want to thank all of you who have helped out with obtaining supplies, farming, or with your special skills in enchanting or jewelcraft (Tyhja, Morawie, Nienor, Charmie, Valrog etc., and Aristedemos for imbueing gems and catching a stray enchanter for distilled mana) and Tuss for contributing the plat to get me off on the right foot.<br>
<br>
A special thanks to Brenladar, who stuck with me pretty much every step of the way, and without whose assistance it would have taken me at LEAST twice as long. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Many of the special new recipes of course trivial well above 200 - Golden Idols at 242, and Spiritstones and Faithstones at over 250, but at least now I should have a decent shot at success making these, and won't have to watch all of my hard-earned distilled mana go &quot;poof&quot; in the combines.<br>
<br>
Guildmembers will of course get special rates on anything I make for them, basically cost of materials alone, but this will have to include at present the cost of failed combines in any given attempt.  So let me know if you've had your eye on something, and we'll see what we can do to accomodate you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

hehe this is indeed great news. And what a great way for me to see how things are going after being away for a week. <br>
<br>
/Tuss gives a REALLY BIG HUG - well big for a hobbitz anyway!<br>
<br>
I am not only proud but very happy for u, that persistance (or stubboness perhaps hehe) certainly pays off.<br>
<br>
A great example for all others then, see u dont have to be some uber lvl 55 or greater peep to be a GM in tradeskills. Its just takes friends and abit of help. That is exactly why I wanted to have some farming days to help others do exactly that. Now we have someone in the guild that can make special items for us but also achieved her goals to be able to make 2 parts of the PoTC quest.<br>
<br>
So what is stopping you doing the same?? Only u are....so lets get together and try for some other skills ok. I suggest that we have one peeps as a leader in the skill then another one (two or three) like apprentices and we help each other there.<br>
<br>
again gratz on GM Kemie (*O*)/<br>
<br>
proud and very happy<br>

Sigh... on doing some of these things, in spite of my success at grandmastering the trade, I'm running into problems.  Last night I made four out of four tries at golden idols of Tunare, the one needed for the PoTC quest, but failed every attempt at idols of Quellious or Tribunal, and four attempts at the Star Ruby stein needed for PoTC. <br>
<br>
Before I can attempt any more golden idols I need more distilled mana (so once again have to go through the hassle of lining up and pinning down an enchanter long enough to do them)... and I can't FIRE any more idols in the kiln until I locate more iron oxide for the glaze (I'm also running low on Permafrost Crystals).<br>
<br>
Iron oxide has become one of the rarest commodoties in the game lately.  The only guaranteed source is the six groundspawn points in Steamfont, which are very very heavily camped of late, besides being on a whacky spawn schedule which can be as long as 22 hours for any one of the spots.  It drops extremely rarely from some elemental mobs in Steamfont and Najena (and possibly one of the Sols?).... I had built up nine of them very painfully and painstakingly, but am now out. (I've seen others looking for it advertise to pay as much as 600pp per oxide or 4k per stack!!!!)<br>
<br>
I can't attempt any more of the ruby steins until I tie Ari or someone down to lacquer more star rubies for me... and it might pay to round up a tinker to make me a Geerlock pottery tool before I even attempt them.<br>
<br>
All golden idols and any spiritstones or faithstones require the divine glaze which requires the iron oxides, gang.  Unless and until VI does something to improve the drop rate, we may be up a creek without a paddle. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
On the good side, I helped Bren farm some pelts last night, and got him working on his smithing again.  He hit 179 and actually made a wee bit of money back in the attempts. YAY!<br>
<br>
I have Geerlock tools for baking and brewing, should anyone need to borrow them.  Persistence is indeed the key to grandmastering any of the trades. <p><p align="center"><a

GRATZ! sweetie !  LOL someone wouldn't let me sleep this weekend at the rennaissance festival... LOL  anyway, I sort of have a confession........ I most likely have some iron oxide in the bank. I have thaty dwarven pallie, and had started saving them for him for cultural.  So since I'm not really playing him that much, having them rotting in a bank when you can use em is a bit silly.  OK as far as drops, I know a thing or 2 from when I had my cultural armor made.  yes, technically, iron oxide drops in Steamfont, and Najena, (AND a couple of other places I seem to remember)  the drops in Steamfont are about 10 times more rare than the ones in Najena. however, with Metsa, what I did, to collect my essence of moonlight (drops in the same places) is to port in and auction newbies hunting in SF for the essence.  I paid 15 plat each, and they were ESTATIC to sell them to me, especially after I went in and buffed them all up so they could kill the stuff faster.  I told them what the stuff was and what it was for, and they were happy to help.  Most put my name on their friends list, and I got tells weeks later saying that they had just ONE and did I still want it.  it worked beautifully.  if however, YOU are going to farm it, go to Najena, it's FAR faster as the drops are more common.  Heck, grab a melee, head in and just wipe out the dungeon.  Noone ever seems to be in there anyway.  And you can make 2 plat off from each of the ghoulbane skellies each clearing, so the plat isn't to bad for farming to !  So, if I'm on Kemie/galadria, send me a tell, and I'll find em in the bank for ya <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   and again Gratz !<br>
