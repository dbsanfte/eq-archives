Why does the sun have to come out so friggin early. You'd think Tunare Herself were here shining her beauty upon me.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> With that and a grunt of effort, the Cleric eased his bulky frame out of his bed, slipped his feet into his slippers and grabbed his robe off the adjoining chair.<br>
<br>
*Knock* <br>
<br>
*Knock*<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes! I'm coming!&quot; the cleric yelled. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> After 23 years of service to our Mother of All, you'd think that they would show more respect for someone my age and with my reputation.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Though still considered young, even by Elven standards, the Cleric had grown used to his lofty position. Having gained it with the successful raid on the neighboring stronghold of Crushbone, his rise to High Templar of Tunare was a shock to most of the populace of Felwithe. With some resentment from the higher clerics in his guild, he accepted the title, responsibility and the prestige with an air of one born to it. After all, he IS a High Elf born.<br>
<br>
*Knock*<br>
<br>
*Knock*<br>
<br>
&quot;I'M COMING!&quot; the Cleric yelled as he reached the door. Yanking it open, an angry retort forming on his tongue, he lost all thought as he came eye to eye with the person standing at his door.<br>
<br>
&quot;I...I'm v..v .very sorry l..lord,&quot; said the zealot, her robe slipping open slightly as she bowed low to him. Her cleavage showed to good extent as the Cleric eyed her boldly. Dropping to one knee in front of him, the zealot bowed lower, her head nearly touching the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, yes...get up. You'll have to excuse me my abrupt manor,&quot; the Cleric said, helping her stand, his eyes brazingly taking in her measure. &quot; I am not used to being summoned from bed at this hour. What brings you to my door, young one?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;An urgent message, m'lord,&quot; the zealot said, again bowing, her robe nearly falling open completely. The Clerics eyes never left her chest area as she handed him the rolled up parchment. Taking it, he slowly backed into his room again and with reluctant hands, closed his door. Taking a deep breath and leaning back against the door, he let out a heavy sigh. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Tunare, I love thee and this job you've given me!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he prayed, his smile growing larger as he closed his eyes and let his mind wander.<br>
__________<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Mmmmm...she smells good. I wonder where I met her? I wonder how I'm going to get her out of my bed</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the Warrior thought as he looked down upon this beauty before him. Her hair was mussed up and the smile on her face showed her contentment of last nights little festive party. Smiling, he moved an errant strand of blonde hair out of her mouth that she was absently gnawing on and leaned down, kissing her lightly on her cheek. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Well, I guess I can vacate this room faster than she, at the moment. Now, where did my pants go?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Searching for his pants and finally finding them, drapped over the wash bin, he commenced with dressing himself. After pulling his leggings on, he quickly dashed some cold water onto his face and over his hair, drying off and putting his tunic on. Locating each piece of his light armor around the room, he was quickly attired in full. Gathering up his weapons, a longsword, two dagger, a shortsword and his longbow, he quietly made his way through the room to the door that led to the rest of the inn. Opening it, he slipped out and quietly closed the door behind him. Turning, he nearly ran over a zealot from the Church of Tunare.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whoa! Careful there!&quot; the Warrior said as he steadied the young worshipper. With eyes wide at seeing this tall barbarian before him, the zealot quickly handed him a rolled up parchment and scampered back down the hall, disappearing around the corner and was gone. Looking after him in amazement (he always had this affect on the weaker southerners) he looked down at the parchment in wonder. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Great, now, who can i get to read this for me?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
__________<br>
<br>
&quot;No no no....you imbicile, you can't summon up just ANY thing. You have to acquire the skill AND the patience to summon up the elementals as well as the bandages and the food/drink that you want. Now, watch ...and learn...&quot;<br>
<br>
Closing his eyes, the Magician began to draw in the mana from the very air around him, it's energy's spiralling around his body with a green incadescent radiance, peaking above his head and dispersing out around him in a rain of light and sparkles. Bringing his hands slowly down, the green energy callosed into a ball and with a small *pop* vanished, leaving in it's place a loaf of black bread.<br>
<br>
&quot;There, you see? Patience and concentration,&quot; the Magician told the student, who nodded in wide eyed amazement. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Ye gods, he's so green....I wonder who got him into the school this time. Probably another rich family.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Dismissing the student from his studies, the Magician let out a deep sigh and started to put away the spell components that he had taken off the shelf in preparation of helping this student. When he turned around, a zealot from the Church of Tunare was standing in his doorway.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes?&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
Holding out the rolled up parchment, the zealot took two steps forward and bowed over her arms. <br>
<br>
&quot;A summons, m'lord,&quot; she said, still bowed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, thank you,&quot; the Magician said, taking the parchment and dismissing her as well. <br>
<br>
A look of puzzlement on his face, he walked around to his desk, sat down and began to open the scroll, wondering what anyone would want with him now...<br>
__________<br>
<br>
The shadow made no sound, made no move, as the deer walked towards the pool of water. Fritzed already from the near death episode with the hunter last night, the deer's ears were up and perked, attentive. Easing along the edge of the pool, he slowly dipped down to drink from the pool.<br>
<br>
Detaching from the shadows right behind the deer, the Ranger took two steps and was right next to the deer, his arms out wide, his spell already finished. The soft, white aura that surrounded the deer told him it was successful. The deer never even twitched, he just kept drinking from the pool.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well done dearheart,&quot; a voice came floating out of the forest, startling the deer into bolting. Laughter as melodic as that of a harp followed the deer well after it had disappeared. Sliding through the leaves of the trees and bushes, the Druid came into view, her smile warm and loving as she came to stop before her mate.<br>
<br>
&quot;You cheated. You weren't suppose to come out til I had completed the charm love.&quot; The Ranger nonetheless smiled fondly and leaned forward, kissing his wife on her cheek.<br>
<br>
&quot;Piffle, you would have won anyways. It was a silly bet, made in the heat of passion and lust,&quot; she responded. Hugging her husband close, she gestured and summoned up some breakfast, a loaf of bread and some spring water. Breaking the bread, she handed half to the Ranger and the water. Taking a bit from her own, she nudged her mate and pointed down the game trail, pointing to the zealot who was stumbling along the trail. Grinning from ear to ear, the Ranger nodded and stepped back as his wife began to cast. Almost praying, she asked Tunare to change them and with a burst of mana, a sudden growth of fur and a twisting of limbs, the Druid and Ranger both dropped to there four new legs and scampered off to the brush, waiting.<br>
<br>
The zealot came cautiously to the edge of the pool, almost exactly like the deer had, though for different reasons. Looking around at the surrounding forest in trepidition, he decided that it would be safer to just leave the scroll here, where the pair was known to reside. Putting the scroll down, he turned and was confronted by the two wolves. Stopping short with a little squeek, he froze completely. The two wolves circled around the zealot and came to stop on each side of him. The wolf on the right started to open its jaws and the zealot, thinking it better to serve Tunare as the living, bolted down the trail, thoughts of wild wolves chasing him all the way back to the guilds in Greater Faydark.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Look hun, the seal on this scroll is of the human city of Freeport.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Aye love, tis that indeed. Such a long way to come to deliver a message, yes?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Yes, it is. As a Ranger, you can lead us on the start of this trek in short order while I commune with Tunare for the needed spells to get us through the rest of this journey</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Aye love, but I have a question? How do wolves open a scroll without tearing it up?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I guess we'll have to wait for the spell to wear off. In the mean time, we can do what wolves do best .... FROLIC!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and with that she nipped playfully at the Ranger/wolf and leaped into the bushes, leading into the forest..<br>
__________<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Be like the post</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the Enchater thought to himself, his body slowly molding into the form the nearby torch post. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Straight, rigid, unyeilding</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The zealot who walked through his front door, knocking quietly before entering, looked around. Seeing no one here, he walked the rest of the way in and came to stop just before this 'post'. Sighing, the zealot turned his back on the 'post' and looked around the room again.<br>
<br>
Mentally shifting his image, fur shooting out across his body, the unyieldingness of his form melting into that of a living thing, his arms elongating, his muscles growing, swelling. His teeth growing longer and his nose growing outward. In a mellow, very relaxing voice, he addressed the zealot from behind.<br>
<br>
&quot;What can I do for you, young lass?&quot;<br>
<br>
Jumping almost out of her skin, the zealot spun around, her robe coming completely open, revelling her naked body to the Enchanter and screaming at the top of her voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, as much as I admire a young body thrown at me like this, what can I do for you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Dropping a scroll, she bolted through the door and was gone in a heartbeat. Sighing, his smile slow but steady, he picked up the scroll, noticing the seal of Freeport stamped into the wax. Sighing yet again, he shifted to his Elven form and walked to his desk....<br>
