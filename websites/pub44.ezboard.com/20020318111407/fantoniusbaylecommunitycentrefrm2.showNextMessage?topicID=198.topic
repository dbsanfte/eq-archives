I send a tell to the raid leader - 'What's the score with loot?'.  The reply - 'Everything but the book is open roll'.  Please remember that, I asked him a few times, specifically on CoF - 'So CoF is open for all to roll'.  The answer 'Yes', every time.  Another cleric (there were a total of 3 for the raid) was promised the same it later transpired.<br><br>Well I figured I'd like the chance on a CoF or whatever loot was available.  My main character is a warrior but can't do naggy for obvious reasons.  So I send a tell back asking if he wants a Cleric (52) or shaman (4<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  'Cleric' is the reply.  So I log out my warrior (now in the dungeon) and log in a cleric who myself and RL friend use for ressing/PL'ing on other accounts we have.<br><br>To cut a long story short (5 hours later....), we killed naggy and 2 CoFs drop! in addition to book, Gauntlets and drums.  Lo and behold WoT shout 'All melee/hybrid who want to roll on CoF send tell'.  Immediately I ask what is going on?  What about the promises.  Why have I spent 5+ hours on a raid for nothing?  The WoT member leading the raid gave us promises about the loot arrangements and then changes them once the raid is over to suit themselves.  Basically I'm shouted down by alot of greedy people who are all claiming NBG.  I'm being told that a cleric should never roll on a CoF.  If that was the case then why did the raid leader promise that everything would be open?  I only asked for what I was promised on numerous occasions.  Nothing more / nothing less.<br><br>Please beware of WoT, I would never have attended this raid if I'd known the real status of loot - and neither would the other cleric who was promised the same.  Not being big headed but the raid would not have gone ahead with only 1 cleric left.  We were lied to by WoT.  The ultimate irony for me is that this was for a Paladin - aren't they mean't to be the honourable ones of Norrath?  I learn't a valuable lesson today - don't bother helping others unless you're guilded with them.  Seems like WoT like to milk the good will of people on this server for their own ends.  <br><br><br> <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=66841" target="_blank"> Praekor's Gear</a></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/fantoniusbaylecommunitycentrefrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=100.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/udjinyxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Djinyxx</A> </span><br><br> <span class=usertitle>Sarnak Dragoon</span><br>  Posts: <b>49</b><br></td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#6699F>Posted: 1/10/02 8:37:53 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Re: BEWARE Wind of Tranquility - Oath Breakers!</span><hr size=1> Stop being a fucking idiot..

WTF you think that the leader just should walk up to you and give you the fucking CoF?? Does everyone else go bitch about that they didnt win something on a fair roll? I think not. So what are you trying to do, blackpaint WoT so you get some sick satisfaction because you think its unfair that you didnt win the roll.. Some people just have the nerves to pull this kind of shit on others.. You made a lot of enemies that night because of your own stupidity, hope you enjoy it Curium.<br><br>ps.

This isn't exactly a ground breaking raid or even exciting.  It's boring and slow.  <br><br>On any previous raid the raid leader has always told people the loot rules.  People can either take it or leave it.  Today the raid leader CHANGED the loot rules after the raid was complete.  I'm sorry, but not all of us can manage 10+ hours a day online and 5 hours is not an insigificant time to those of us who have many other responsibilities.<br><br>I named WoT because they were leading the raid,  they actually tried to dictate to the raid leader (from woT) the loot rules.  At one stage at the end the raid leader was shouting that all the rolls were open, and his guild buddy was shouting Class only.<br><br>I have no desire to obtain an epic with the cleric I used because it is for power levelling and ressing on other accounts - therefore I felt no obligation to join this raid other than the chance to roll on the loot other than the book.  This right was removed from me after I'd invested the time.   I thought the whole raid was a joke, but I stuck with it to the end because I said I would.  I like to keep my word, it's a shame that others are willing to use others for their own end in matters like this. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=66841" target="_blank"> Praekor's Gear</a></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/fantoniusbaylecommunitycentrefrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=100.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/urefobelite.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Refob Elite</A> </span><br><br> <span class=usertitle>Moss Snake</span><br>  Posts: <b>6</b><br></td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#6699F>Posted: 1/10/02 9:20:36 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Re: BEWARE Wind of Tranquility - Oath Breakers!</span><hr size=1> Do I see a cleric bitching about not being allowed to roll on a cof?  go fuck yourself <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/fantoniusbaylecommunitycentrefrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=100.topic&index=5><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/uzilla11.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zilla11</A> </span><br><br> <span class=usertitle>The handsome</span><br>  Posts: <b>70</b><br></td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#6699F>Posted: 1/10/02 10:12:36 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Re: BEWARE Wind of Tranquility - Oath Breakers!</span><hr size=1> haha clerics shouldnt even get the change rolling for CoF..<br>so go fakk urself..

Basically no cleric is gonna go unless they need ragefire with that attitude.<br><br>You think I care about your NBG on the cleric.  It's just one of many chars I play so NBG is meaningless.  If they didn't need my help fine, I wouldn't have gone, but the fact is they did need clerics, and they did trick 2 out of the 3 clerics into going because they promised them a roll.<br><br>zilla, I think you are a bit stupid if you think that lieing to someone is a good way of getting them away.  Errr if he had time to respond with a lie, he had just as much time to say 'No we doing NBG'.  so your logic is so flawed it doesn't even warrant discussing.<br><br>I don't think you've had any experience leading raids because your responses to the situation were totally different than anything I've ever experienced.  How much did you pay for that account?<br><br>Anyway, at least I know where I stand, and myself and friends who saw how badly that raid went will never bother with open raids again - they are a total waste of time.  <br><br>As I said some people have work or family to attend to.  You obviously have neither if you only play in 8+hour sessions.  Your ignorance and arrogance is very plain to see - I know many very good people who don't have these long time periods to play yet want to have good fun who would find your comments insulting.

Sounds resonable if he didn't roll on any cleric loot that dropped. <br><br>On top of that, if the raid leader did say he could roll on the CoF with his cleric, he should be allowed to.<br><br>But then, you should probably wager in how many melee's were on that raid. It's a pain trying to explain why one, and only one, cleric is rolling along with the other melee's for the CoF. <br><br>I say just move on. Don't get too huffy over a game. The people in WoT have always been nice to me, so I think there has to be something more than what your putting forth. <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/fantoniusbaylecommunitycentrefrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=100.topic&index=10><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/uyezudstygia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>YezudStygia</A> </span><br><br> <span class=usertitle>Gnoll Commander</span><br>  Posts: <b>29</b><br></td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#6699F>Posted: 1/11/02 1:21:39 am</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Re: BEWARE Wind of Tranquility - Oath Breakers!</span><hr size=1> HTML Comments are not allowed <p><p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.psend.com/users/lavazza/sign.gif" width="366" height="326"></p><p align="center"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61848">Xanox Dragoons 60 Druid</a> -<a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=2234"> Yezud Stygia 60 Paladin</a> </p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/fantoniusbaylecommunitycentrefrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=100.topic&index=11><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/uyezudstygia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>YezudStygia</A> </span><br><br> <span class=usertitle>Gnoll Commander</span><br>  Posts: <b>30</b><br></td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#6699F>Posted: 1/11/02 1:25:06 am</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Re: BEWARE Wind of Tranquility - Oath Breakers!</span><hr size=1> stupid ezboard :P<br><br>People still raid only for the fun...not all...but alot do, so don't warry clerics will always show up for naggy raids...<br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Edit by Moderator: Please only post your signature once per topic</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p></p><span class=m><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/ufandariella.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fandariella</A> at: 1/15/02 12:16:26 pm<br></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/fantoniusbaylecommunitycentrefrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=100.topic&index=12><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/uaandiindawnstrider.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aandiin Dawnstrider</A> </span><br><br> <span class=usertitle>Moss Snake</span><br>  Posts: <b>8</b><br></td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#6699F>Posted: 1/11/02 2:39:38 am</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Re: BEWARE Wind of Tranquility - Oath Breakers!</span><hr size=1> you basicly came here and made everyone see you are a lootwhore.<br>I like the part where you kinda hint that since nothing drop there for clerics, why should clerics go there.....<br>thats the spirit....<br>/flip<br>you will get lots of help on Ragefire I'm sure....<br> <p>Aandiin Dawnstrider<Guardian Knights><br>Elementalist of the 54th Summon<br><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=27977"> Profile</a></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/fantoniusbaylecommunitycentrefrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=100.topic&index=13><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/uthrackeneverlich.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thracken Everlich</A>&nbsp;

 i can understand his frustration on this, whether CoF SHOULD be melee only or not is a seperate issue, what hes pissed about is he spent 5 hours doing something, been told one thing, then its spun 180 on him, of course hes gonna be pissed. so will u stop with the &quot;loot whore&quot;
