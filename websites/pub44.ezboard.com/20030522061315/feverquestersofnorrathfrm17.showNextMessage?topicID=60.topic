Kemie and Influenced, the Dreamshadows, decided to stretch their legs and get some air and exercise fighting gnolls on top of Splitpaw, where they have often battled the minions of evil in the past.<br>
<br>
Knowing each other so well, we had fallen into a familiar rhythm of Influenced pulling, Kemie DS'ing and snaring and possibly dotting with heals thrown in when required, while Influenced used his bow and slashed or pierced and cast his own spells, kindly allowing Kemie to practice her one hand blunt weaponry when the beasts had given up and turned to flee. Only once was this pattern disrupted, when some unknown caster from a distance away vilely rooted the turned gnoll, causing it to aggro on Kemie unexpectedly.…  We could not learn who disliked us enough to do this thing, or understand what we might have done to deserve dislike, but that is as may be.  Eventually Raynn, who had been practicing her casting skills endlessly near the aviak village and was feeling lonely, showed up to sit nearby and continue her lessons.<br>
<br>
Raynn does not know the top of Splitpaw as we do, and managed to choose a spot to sit right at the top of the hill where wandering gnolls customarily make their path from below.  I tried to advise her of this but she evidently did not hear, for she did not move but began instead to meditate when she ran low on mana.  Sure enough, two gnolls were soon upon her, and as Kemie and Influenced were at that time joined in battle with another, Raynn followed the prudent course and sought safety in the tunnel to Splitpaw!  Finishing off the foul beast before him, Influenced jumped quickly to pull one of the pair from his sister-in-law, and some minutes later saw it fall beneath his feet in a pool of blood, and he smiled grimly as he wiped his blade clean on the corpse and informed Raynn she could return.<br>
<br>
Thereafter Raynn chose to sit more closely to me, for it was safer there to meditate as need arose.  Thoughtfully considering her and the close encounter she had just faced, I lifted up my hands and begged the grace of Tunare's power and gathered up the threads of mana and cast a shield of skin like steel upon her, just in case.  Soon Influenced and Kemie were once more ready, and he sought another nearby gnoll to pull to me and the contest of good versus evil continued.  Shortly later, Diora appeared in the zone and stopped by to chat with us briefly on her way through.  But the pattern of our fighting soon resumed….<br>
<br>
So the three of us were there, Kemie and Influe battling a gnoll and Raynn continually bursting forth anew with a coat of prickly thistles, when we heard an ominous warning that in the depths of Splitpaw beneath our feet a horde of undead gnolls had arisen and were making their way to the surface to avenge their deaths…. Those around us who also heard this news assured us they would not actually come forth into South Karana and that there was no need to fear.  Otherwise I might, just might, have dropped down to my spell book to quickly mem Evac, and taken the time to invite young Raynn into the group.  Sadly, I did neither.  Another gnoll, far from undead, was upon us then and we proceeded to do battle.  The gnoll knew it was defeated and had already turned and was nearly dead when Raynn witnessed a boilng forth of a multitude of vile, corrupted and stench-riddled undead from the nearby mouth of Splitpaw.  They were upon her in an instant, and she shouted out to me to catch my attention as she turned to flee.<br>
<br>
Appalled at the sight that met my eyes as I looked her way, I could only whimper &quot;RUN&quot; to Influenced, still fighting with his back to the swarm.  Following my own advice I hared after Raynn who was already on her way to the dubious safety of the Splitpaw tunnel, diving straight through the decaying bodies.  A cloud of darkness engulfed me and I staggered, gravely wounded! Seconds later my blood began to boil, and I hit the zone with barely a bubble of health remaining and that beginning to drain away under the onslaught.  Raynn too had made it, perhaps due in part to that recent cast of skin like steel, but Influenced… my beloved Influenced was rooted to the ground and ensnared as he attempted to follow the short distance, and fell beneath the onslaught of a dozen or more of the filthy undead of Splitpaw.<br>
<br>
Raynn and I were sorely grieved, for alas Influenced has been battling his way through hell at 30 for far too long and suffered innumerable deaths on the way, choosing always to be the last to flee while insuring those he loves make it to safety.  And to our dismay he, who when last any of us knew was bound in the Arena off Lake Rathe, woke up unaccountably in East Freeport (still a mystery, as his brother Ordained was bound there yesterday while Influe has not been out of South Karana in weeks!).  Kemie would of course go get him, but Raynn and I were loath to let matters rest this way.<br>
<br>
Our dear guildmate Qinelenlea had already camped for the night, but Raynn bravely ventured out again into South Karana, where undead were still roaming, to try to find a cleric who might resurrect Influenced with as much of his former experience as could be managed.  Finding no one in the zone able to assist, Raynn carefully made her way toward Lake Rathe (detouring around the undead still roaming about causing havoc and confusion), where there was supposedly a cleric epic going on at the time, in hopes some one of them would respond to her offer of a platinum per experience percentage to come to our aid.  Meanwhile Kemie met up with Influenced in East Commons and teleported him to North Karana and ran with him back to Splitpaw, where he bravely dodged a number of loose gnolls to secure his corpse, leaving one arrow upon it just in case.  But Raynn was having no luck getting an answer at the Lake….<br>
<br>
My sister Raynn is a stubborn ranger.  Methodically she began sending tells to every cleric of a higher level throughout the lands of Norrath, repeating her request for assistance and her generous offer.  Time after time she met with no response, or even rudeness.  And then she came to the name of Klind, a Templar of the 57th season, who immediately told her he would be happy to come if we could provide him a ride.  Kemie immediately set forth again to the druid rings in West Commons to meet him, while Raynn made her slow way back from the Lake, and Influenced began the arduous chore of dragging his lifeless corpse north to the bridge to make thing as easy for the kind cleric as possible.<br>
<br>
My first words in tells with Klind Delacroix of Sacred Valor were vastly calming.  He was kind and cheerful and very reassuring.  Soon I was face to face with this charming dwarf, clad in gorgeously shining and impressive purple planar armour.  I thanked him profusely for his willingness to assist and cast the spell that would transport us instantaneously to the nearest druid ring in North Karana.  I did not speak with him of payment, for I knew that Raynn intended to take care of this detail, but still I wanted him to know of my gratitude in advance.  Both SoW'd, we headed swiftly through the greenish rain that still besets that land and to the stone bridge, where Raynn and Inflenced waited upon the other side.  Within moments of our arrival Klind had miraculously restored my love nearly to his former status with the blessed power of his hands and the gods' favour.<br>
<br>
It seems that Influenced had some prior acquaintance with this heroic dwarf and fond memories, and he wasted no time before proferring a very generous fee to Klind.  Raynn of course, was also attempting to give the Templar money, for hers was the bargain.  But Klind stoutly refused them both, sternly insisting he had never in his life accepted &quot;bribes&quot; for what he felt was his moral duty and only the only right and decent thing to do with his gifts.  Within a few minutes of his favor to Influenced and us, he raised his voice in a mighty shout to be heard throughout South Karana, and let it be known he would gladly resurrect anyone who had fallen there that night to the rank spawn of undead, should they care to come to the bridge to meet him.<br>
<br>
Klind did this selflessly, and willingly, and spurned all suggestions of payment of any kind whether in platinum or favors, although Kemie as well as Influenced's brother Ordained have both have vowed to carry the Templar anywhere in the lands without charge should he ever have need of transport and ask it of us.  He is truly one of the best souls we have encountered in our sojourn in Norrath and we hope that all of our brethren and sisters in Victus Fortis will hold his name ever in esteem and honour, as we do.<br>
<br>
(Alas the trials of our night were not over.  Kemie had to leave of a sudden on guild business, and while she was gone Influenced went &quot;linkdead&quot; and disappeared.  After some fifteen minutes or so he reappeared at the foot of the stone bridge, but mysteriously Raynn and Kemie could get no response from him even on Kemie's return…. Then once again he went &quot;linkdead&quot; and we had given up on him for the night when for a third time we found him in our midst.  This time he did in fact respond, and was quite astonished and filled with disbelief when we told him of his earlier reappearance, for at the time of this occurrence he was sitting alone trying to re-establish connection, while being told over and over and over again - although the time for this had long since passed - that he already had a character active on Lanys server!  Suffice it to say, the three of us decided then and there to teleport out of South Karana for the time being!  The evening had begun with Influenced somewhat unsettled by the screen before him showing Kemie with only the front half of her head - although no one else viewed her that way and camping of neither and relogging changed the matter… progressed through all these other strange events not easily explained, including what may or may not have been a GM event - there were some GM's who showed up in the zone, but much much later than is normal had this been the sort they contrive… and ending with a bizarre &quot;ghosting&quot; episode!  Klind's gift to us was the nearly the only pleasant thing that happened. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Bless his soul!)  <br>
