Each step is difficult and time consuming, requiring collection of scads of no-drop loots from creatures in the Shar Vahl pits, Shadeweaver's Thicket, Paludal Caverns, and Hollowshade Moor.  Each class is guided as well into a specific tradeskill - beastords to tailoring, warriors to smithing, bards to pottery, rogues to baking, and shamans to brewing.  There are subquests along the way for most of these that were intended to help raise those tradeskills to the level necessary, at least mastery but averaging about 135 or so for each. The final step, making the weapon, requires a special part made by each of those five classes (and which can be crafted by no other class/race combination).<br><br>Those of you who have farmed silks for tailoring, or experienced things like the frustrations of getting enough rare no-drops for the Coldain Prayer Shawl quest only to have the combine fail, have sampled just a little bit of what this Vah Shir quest entails.  Kitties go from initiate to recruit to apprentice, receiving an upgraded cloak (with a tradeskill modifier) and other class specific weapons or items along the way to the final step.  The quest is SO difficult that many people give up early on, and it is made more difficult because to achieve the final stage, you have to obtain that special part from each of the other classes.<br><br>When Jerila began this quest, there were a fair number of people creating Vah Shir characters, but many, many of them never attempted more than a step or two of the Sonic Wolf Bane Weapon quest before leaving Luclin for the more familiar regions on Norrath, and it very quickly became obvious that extraordinary measures would need to be taken in order for her to complete the quest herself.  Raynn had created a warrior, Buranshe, about the same time, but each friend we made from another class soon disappeared, so eventually between the two of us we created the rogue Slypuss and the bard Melodicat and began working on their portions of the quest.  After Brenladar joined VF, he made himself available to help the kitties on a regular basis, and ultimately created a kitty shaman, Shalkar, so the five classes would all be represented.<br><br>The quest was not clear sailing even then.  Certain mobs and drops were periodically broken, and months went by when I was not able to work on tradeskills especially.  And tailoring, Jerila's portion, is notoriously difficult to raise to begin with.  The &quot;mob wars&quot; in Hollowshade Moor, designed as part of the extension of this Vah Shir quests beyond the Sonic Wolf Bane Weapons, messed things up even more as it has repeatedly broken down and stalled with one or another mob type ruling the entire zone for weeks on end (drops are needed from grimlings, wolves and owlbears, and the absence of any precludes of course obtaining no-drop items from them).<br><br>Jerila's tailoring skill is still only 85, even with the recent additional recipes VI introduced to help out.  But having painfully collected a half dozen or so of each of the four special components for her part, I went ahead and tried making the Toughened Sinew Lashings yesterday with one success.  Shalkar had already given her one bottle of Reactive Sealant Soak… Melodicat had made a Ceramic Claw Sleeve (along with two Ceramic Dagger Sleeves used by the other classes), and Slypuss already had three pouches of Sonic Wolf Bane waiting…. Buranshe had enough of one of the ingredients for just two attempts to make the Porous Claws, and luckily succeeded in one, so finally, at long last, I had enough components for one combine.  Jerila, being the first of the kitties created, hence became the first to make her Sonic Wolf Bane Weapon (special claws that have a bonus when used against sonic wolves) and to obtain her journeyman's cloak, necessary for the continuation of the kitty quests.<br><br>Bren and I were fortunate enough last night to be able to collect a few more of some of the special drops that Jerila and Buranshe need in order to attempt to make more of their class-specific part of this recipe, so with luck perhaps another of the five kitties will be able shortly to match Jerila's accomplishment.  But it will undoubtedly still be a long, long time before all five have their Sonic Wolf Bane Weapon completed, with Hollowshade Moor in the mess it's always in.  And moving on from there - which requires drops from each of the mobs there in war mode, might take years…. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>~Galadria Cul`Ravenni<br>~Kemie Dreamshadow<br>~Jerila Velvetpaw, lvl 26 Vah BST<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/beverquestersofnorrath.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=galadriaculravenni>Galadria Culravenni</A> at: 6/30/02 1:32:16 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/utusslefoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tusslefoot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Officer of Victus Fortis</span><br>  Posts: 93<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/3/02 4:41:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=734.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Completion of Sonic Wolf Bane Weapon quest...</span><hr size=1> Well done Jerila,<br>Yes I know exacly how u feel as I am presently on the 6th Coldain shawl and now attempting to battle the sirens for that elusive hair.

Jerila succeeded with 2 out of 4 of her tailored part in spite of a skill of only 88 (triv something like 135) but unfortunately ran out of the drop from owlbears, so Melodicat will have to wait for another day to finish hers.<br><br>Bur and Melo have supplies left over and can attempt making the warrior and bard parts for anyone else who is attempting this quest.  As mentioned, Jerila needs to encounter owlbears in Hollowshade again, and Slypuss needs grimlings, so it may be a while before either of them has any stock on hand for additional parts.<br><br>Hehe persistance? Pig-headed and stubborn certainly!  Making four different characters and having a friend make the fifth, just to complete a &quot;beginning&quot; quest shows signs of mental instability doesn't it?
