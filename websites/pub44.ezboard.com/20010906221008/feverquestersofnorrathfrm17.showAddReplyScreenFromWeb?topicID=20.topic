<br>
As many of you are aware, I am bent on avenging the death of  Clawfist, one of the last Kerran monks of the Ashen Order. For his spirit to be truly laid to rest I must gather his remains, and return them to his sole companion on far distant Kerra Isle.<br>
<br>
Clawfist's last moments were in Runnyeye, a stench and slime riddled hole beset by goblins, and one of his known killers was a goblin alchemist who it is rumoured can be seen skulking aroung the entrance to Runnyeye, in the Gorge of King Xorb. It has been my habit of late to settle comfortable on a rock in the Gorge awaiting the appearance of my foe. <br>
<br>
Yesterday I was comfortably ensconced on my rock when a plaintive shout rang out, asking for invisibility to be granted for a corpse run into Runnyeye. Standing behind me at the entrance was a poor young halfling lass*, a doughty warrior, but out of her league amongst the evil denizens of Runnyeye. As we were alone in the region, I approached her, and summoning all my magical powers, cloaked her with a veil of invisibility. Sadly a monk's powers in this arcane field are weak and my cloak may have hidden her from blind creatures on a dark night, but no more. So I offered to help with corpse retrieval, if she could tell me where her corpse lay. Of course not! She had fled from monstrous creatures in a blind panic and felt only that she fell on a bridge, which is no help at all as Runnyeye is full of wooden bridges crossing deep chasms and bubbling pits of slime.<br>
<br>
So I accompanied her into the pit. Sneaking so as to not draw the ire of the local residents upon us. &quot;In here&quot;, she whispered. She opened the door and an enormous bloated evil eye struck her down where she stood, and ripped half of my life away before I fell, and lay as though dead waiting for the vile creature to depart. <br>
<br>
We met again at the entrance, and again descended before being greeted by wave upon wave of goblins swarming around us. My companion fled for her life, and I fought wildly before again dropping as though dead. Clearly a better strategy was required. At this point I enlisted the aid of an older, wiser practitioner of the dark arts adventuring nearby to help locate my companion's corpse. This hero slew the evil eye but my friend's corpse was not to be seen. My companion, eventually determined through outside communication that her corpse lay under the feet of a slime elemental. &quot;Ahh&quot; cried I, &quot;that is marked on my map&quot;, which is a creased and blood smeared affair drawn by a dying halfling. <br>
<br>
So for the third time I ventured into the depths of Runnyeye, this time alone. Sneaking and feigning past monsters that were much mightier then me, I worked my way into the dungeon, until at last I came to a bridge where my comrade's corpse lay, with an enormous slime elemental towering over it. Slowly but surely I hauled the corpse out of that stinking hole, taking the occasional battering but always heading up and up until at last I reached a position of safety and my comrade could collect her belongings.<br>
<br>
Just at this instant, feeling bruised and battered, I received a message from a nearby druid that the goblin alchemist had been sighted in the gorge. I waited long enough to ensure the safety of the halfling before racing back to the gorge. The druid immediately commenced the fray, though already weakened by battle, and I joined in. The fight went badly, the druid fled and I was sorely wounded before finally my enemy lay dead at my feet. However, as a last gasp the alchemist laid a wasting spell on me and though the battle was won my health continued to ebb. Nearby goblins sensing my weakness, joined the battle, though normally I could have brushed aside their feeble efforts and although the brave halfling warrior came to my aid, I was slain by the alchemist's curse before I could lay my hands on Clawfist's relic. Reappearing in Rivervale, I ran 'til my feet bled, back towards the gorge. Being a feeble sighted human I needed to be led through the upper reaches of Runnyeye and had to wait imatiently for guidance to arrive. Then on and on, not a moment to lose!<br>
<br>
All for naught. The alchemist had the last laugh, as his remains rotted ere I could reach them. Sadly it seems that my vigil must continue.<br>
<br>
Gumbrils the gobsmacked<br>
<br>
* Terrible it is. My brain took such a beating that day that I, for the life of me, cannot remember the name of this lass. When it returns I shall post it, as she took her multiple deaths over the course of this adventure most heroically.<br>

The warrior I was helping in Runnyeye was called Yvonnette (not too sure of the spelling though). The druid who kindly alerted me to the presence of the alchemist was Fizzlewap, and though he was fair of speech and manner, the poor fellow did seem to be having some intestinal difficulties.<br>
