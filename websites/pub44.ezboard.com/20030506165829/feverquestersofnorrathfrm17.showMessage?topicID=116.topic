<br>
The two were in Kelethin last night when they learned that Nitriz was nearby in Steamfont hunting minotaurs, and Raynn decided to run down to see him and perhaps lend him assistance or some buffs.  Meanwhile, Kemie had a port or two for friends to attend to, so did not accompany her half-sister right away.  But after a while, Raynn saw the opportunity present itself for her to begin the well-known ranger quest for her Ivy-Etched Tunic, and begged Kemie's assistance with defeating Meldrath the Malignant (level 35ish necro) at the mino mines as the first step.<br>
<br>
Kemie had just finished teleporting Xayn, a level 26 monk, who decided he'd like to go along to Steamfont and help as well.  They had barely arrived at the mines when Nitriz camped, and Isladar expressed a desire to journey from North Karana to assist Raynn (for whom he has a certain fondness).  So of course, Kemie went flying off again to pick him up.  This pair had only just arrived back at their destination in Steamfont when it was learned that Nienor, now at the exalted level of 50, would love to join them if only she were not so far away!  By great good fortune, Kemie had last bound herself in Firiona Vie, and so gated there to bring Nienor, too, to the gathering.<br>
<br>
Meldrath proved rather slippery, appearing when we were not ready, and disappearing when we were… meanwhile however, a nasty excursion into the mine tunnels to assist Xayn against a cluster of minos resulted in Raynn's sudden death and de-leveling.  Alas…<br>
<br>
Xayn, aghast at this consequence, camped to make way for his brother Nabosu, a well-known 51+ level druid of the sisters' acquaintance.  Nabosu called upon one Pinnah Collada, a 53 level cleric, to come to Steamfont with him and resurrect Raynn… Meanwhile another friend, the 54 level druid Kylian, popped in for a visit. Finding Meldrath wandering the tunnels, as Kemie was dragging Raynn's corpse to the druid rings for the convenience of the cleric, Kylian pulled the monster outside and rooted him to insure the success of the quest at Raynn's earliest convenience.<br>
<br>
Imagine the surprise of Kemie and Raynn when they met up with Nabosu and the cleric at the ring, both stark naked!  And all of a sudden, word came to them from the group back at the mines that Meldrath had been summarily executed by one gnomish NPC shadow knight named Forpar Fizfla (whose level on Everlore has been estimated at anywhere from 45 to 65), who then turned upon Kylian and slew him as well in spite of Nienor's attempts to memory-wipe…. Raynn was swiftly rezzed, and she and Kemie returned to the scene of the massacre to fetch Kylian's corpse.  Nearly there, they came upon the corpse of the kindly cleric who had just assisted them, and only learned then that Nabosu and Pinnah, on their way the first time, had ALSO encountered Forpar and fallen to his summoning spell… <br>
<br>
What followed was a corpse parade, with Kemie dragging Kylian's, and Raynn dragging Pinnah's, and Nabosu dragging his own, along the long path from the mines back to the druid rings, a veritable corpse &quot;train&quot; that must have looked quite odd to anyone who witnessed it passing by!  With many profuse thanks from the sisters, Nabosu and Pinnah Collada soon departed while Kylian and the girls returned once more to the mines.  Xayn rejoined them, and quite soon afterwards Meldrath appeared again and was quickly dispatched, leaving Raynn the much-needed skull. <br>
<br>
With such high level assistance close at hand in the shape of Kylian and Nienor especially, the group progressed on into Lesser Faydark, in search of Thistle Underbrush and his Rune of Ivy… Kylian gave them all wolf-form, and they proceeded to the middle of the zone without sighting the elusive brownie.  And then Kylian disappeared abruptly, a victim of link death.  The rest waited… at last the druid returned to them, but moments later Xayn vanished in the same way!  Just as suddenly, Thistle appeared on track and they were off on his trail.  Again, success was swift and Raynn needed only the two rubies to fulfill the prescribed quest.  Scenting triumph, they were quickly ready to head to East Karana and Highpass Hold.  But just as Kylian began his portal cast, Xayn woke up in the middle of Lfay alone!  <br>
<br>
Of course we didn't want to abandon him after he'd gone so far with us, so as soon as they landed in East Karana, Kemie left the others to return for him.  Nienor was anxious to resume her hunting in Kunark, and chose to await a ride from Kemie to the Dreadlands rather than continue to Highpass.  Arriving again at the EK druid ring with Xayn, Kemie quickly memmed the port and bore the enchanter off, but Xayn was still a member of the party and went linkdead again on that journey, forcing Kem to abandon him once more in a cruel place to awaken alone!<br>
<br>
Sadly, she sought the remainder of the companions back in EK and they continued up the ramp to the Hold and Highpass Keep.  The rubies were easily purchased, and Kylian, Kemie, Raynn and Isladar made their way into Kithicor Forest (oops, trained some orcs onto a party near the zone in HH and stopped to make sure they were all right, and Raynn and Is got a wee bit turned around finding their way to the forest ranger station) where Raynn turned in skull, rune and gems to Gandari and received in return the prized Ivy-Etched Tunic…. <br>
<br>
Much thanks is deserved by those who assisted in this venture, especially to those high level characters who gave their lives in such bizarre fashion for the sake of friendship.  BRAVO!  (And congratulations, Raynn! - er, do try next time to avoid the use of blood sacrifice when you and Kem get together, okay? Hehe…)<br>
