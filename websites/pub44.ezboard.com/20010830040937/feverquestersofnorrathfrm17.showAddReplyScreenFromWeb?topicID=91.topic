Ayzreall, her companion since birth, he who was supposedly her fated mate, has inexplicably absented himself from her side for some personal pursuit.  Suruli is a warrior, and of course perfectly capable of surviving on her own, and yet… and yet she begins to feel as if Ayzreall takes her loyalty and devotion to him too much for granted.  She is a woman; she has needs that stir deep within her, a hunger that grows and drives her to prowl through the rocky hold seeking… what?<br>
<br>
This wood elf warrior, Kendryk, whom she encountered one day fighting gnolls, this follower of Tunare who leapt to her side and matched her stroke for stroke to defeat their common foes… there was something about him, something about the way he treated her as if she were some precious jewel, an object to be worshiped… His soft sweet words, his gentle touch, lit some fire within her to heat her blood in a way that had nothing to do with battle-lust.  But he spoke oft of this god or goddess named Tunare whom he had sworn to follow, leaving Suruli puzzled and confused.  Was his devotion truly to her, to Suruli, or did he seek only to convert her?  Her hunger had nothing to do with gods!  And then that slip of a wood elf girl, that child Desyree, showed up in Highpass and Kendryk, too, abandoned Suruli, mouthing something about needing a healer at his side rather than another warrior.  <br>
<br>
Suruli ponders this.  This Desyree, this newly chosen companion of Kendryk's, does more than heal.  With her magic she weaves shields to strengthen his armour and give it the ability to wound each foe as well with sharpened thorns.  Her spells strengthen his arm and give fleetness to his feet.  Suruli has heard that these druids, for Desyree is one, can after the passing of a certain number of seasons even harness the energies of the earth and wind to transport others to the far-flung corners of the continents through mystic portals.  Logic argues Kendryk is right in this….<br>
<br>
Lonely, feeling destined always to be alone with this ache, Suruli wakens from her camp above the plains of East Karana.  Stretching in the dawn light, she flexes her muscles and goes through the series of exercises designed to impart fluidity to her battle strokes, a deadly dance in combat situation yet fiercely satisfying to her as she slashes at the air to whirl and kick imaginary foes.  Stoically she turns and enters the pass to Highpass.  Just inside, a Mucktail gnoll appears and her heart leaps ready to attack, but someone not known to her already engages this marauder and Suruli, after a brief pause to assure herself the outcome is not in question, passes by further into the corridor.  Before her a soothsayer appears and she leaps to slash its arm before it can cast, to interrupt the spell.  Her blood sings as she swings her blade and claws through gnoll-flesh, cleaving it again and again, whirling to add a timely kick.  But what is this?  Some stranger, nay, two strangers, wade in and steal her kill!  Dropping her arms to her sides, Suruli sighs in disappointment and withdraws.  Noticing now the weight of unsold loot she carries, and finding the corridor and the ledge above it filled with fighters arguing over territory and gnolls to battle, she makes her way to an isolated merchant somewhat off the beaten path and begins dickering with her over price.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail, Suruli.&quot;<br>
<br>
The soft words come from behind her.  Finishing her business, she turns to find a young wood elf standing hesitantly in the middle of the room, a rosy blush coloring his features.  His awkward gaze is so admiring she finds herself smiling as he averts his eyes and blushes even more.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail, Destyned,&quot; she replies, her curiosity aroused.  He is no more than fourteen seasons, young indeed to be braving the dangers of Highpass Hold alone.<br>
<br>
&quot;K-kendryk,&quot; he stammers, &quot;t-told me you might sh-show me around.&quot;  Taking a deep breath to steady himself the youth adds in a rush, &quot;I'm Desyree's brother.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kendryk did say something about twin druids when he made his apologies and left her.  The young elf bears only slight resemblance to his red-headed sister, dark of hair and eyes.  Those eyes continue to dart shy glances at her from beneath thick lashes.  Kendryk has sent this youngling to her, to Suruli?  She puzzles over this, wondering what her fellow warrior actually intended.<br>
<br>
With a boldness unexpected in one so seemingly shy, Destyned takes her arm and begs her to sit with him awhile. His hand on her flesh, his touch lingering in what is more a caress as he releases her, sparks a flicker of what can only be desire deep within her. As her pulse quickens, a wicked smile lights her lips and Destyned startles back as one bitten, blushing deeply red once more.  How cute, she thinks to herself, and grinning mischievously, informs him he's adorable.  Here is one that she could teach to answer every need.<br>
<br>
Alas for poor Destyned, guided by some impulse he could not control, for in Suruli he may have found a force beyond the power of a young druid to control.  In spite of her heritage of dark elf blood frozen in some deep past reckoning, in spite of the fierce nature of a warrior, Suruli has a heart and soul touched however briefly by Tunare in the shape of Kendryk.  She is a woman; Kendryk taught her she was shaped for love and his lessons began the thaw that threatens now to become a deluge.  Is this then the hand and will of Tunare, that has brought these two together?  Hours pass unnoticed as the slow dance of flirtation continues….<br>
<br>
As darkness settles upon Highpass Hold, the two venture forth together to try their skill in joint combat against the Mucktail gnolls.  Beneath the ledge a single gnoll appears, falling swiftly to the slash of blade and claw wielded by Suruli with the strength lent her by Destyned's spells.  Beyond the archway a flamepaw raises its arms and Suruli leaps towards it, her deadly kick interrupting the cast long enough for Destyned to snare it and prevent flight.  His heals sparkle in the air around her as she stands toe to toe with the enemy, dodging, parrying, slashing when she can to batter it to the ground beneath her feet in a pool of blood.  Further down the passage a soothsayer begins to cast, and claw and langseax still dripping red droplets, she rushes to wade in again, heart singing in battle-lust.  A champion adds on, his fierce blows shaking her as she tries to avoid him and concentrate on the sooth, sensing the caster is a greater threat to her companion Destyned.  Dispatching it at last she turns in an intricate dance of death to match her blades against this gruesome gnoll warrior.  In spite of Destyned's heals her health and stamina are dropping from the heated battle as the blows of repeated foes take their toll.  At last the champion too lies at her feet and she pauses, gasping for air, begging leave to bind up what she can of her bleeding wounds before the young druid gathers scarce mana to complete the process.<br>
<br>
But she has barely begun, kneeling to wind the second or third much needed bandage, her health a bare third of what it should be, when another of Mucktail's minions launches an attack on the young druid!  Grabbing up her claws in one hand and finding her mace handiest to the second, Suruli leaps to defend him, knowing both their lives hang in the balance.  Arms aching with fatigue and loss of blood, she staggers as the brawler turns savagely to her, his rusty sword opening another gaping wound upon her thigh.  Steeling herself to the pain and finding within a deep reserve of strength, Suruli grits her teeth and gives in to a whirling blaze of berserker fury, blade and mace flashing to cut and batter at the gnoll. Victory is imminent and she steps closer ready to deliver the final blows when suddenly Destyned's shouted warning reaches her ears in advance of a blast of rim of frost from a fresh foe that saps nearly all of her remaining health.  Realistically she cannot fell them all, and torn by regret she drags her blade free of the brawler's corpse and fiercely orders the youth to run to safety as she herself turns to stagger to the zone.  Her steps are agonizingly slow, weighted by the nearness of collapse into unconsciousness from lack of blood.  Miraculously, Destyned draws a sparkle of strands of mana together to throw a heal upon her, just enough to lend her strength to reach safe haven.  She is afraid his staunch courage will mean his death as she sees him turn to fire a blast of flame at the pursuing gnolls, now numbering three or four with reinforcements, but together they come out of the darkness into the pass of East Karana, alive if barely so.<br>
<br>
Suruli kneels to bind his wounds, her touch deft yet gentle, before turning to her own.  When he recovers, he wraps her with his woven spell of healing, and then restores himself.  He would have given his life for her, this young wood elf druid, with courage beyond his years.  Her heart warms to a softness she has not felt before, something beyond lust or desire.  Destyned… her thoughts tease at his name, pondering hidden meaning.  She has no god, neither Innoruk nor Tunare nor any other, but still there is such a thing as fate.  Bathed by the faint glow of starlight, the warrior Suruli and the druid Destyned compose themselves to the sleep of exhaustion, comforted in the clasp of each other's arms as they seek shelter from the cold of Norrath's night.<br>
