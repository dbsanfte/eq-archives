We had a full 6-person group of 9-14's attending, plus one high level bard chaperone. We were there for three and a half hours and 5 of our members Dinged (which was, after all, the main intention of this raid). The loot was reasonable (13 bronze weapons, 65+ Dervish Rings), and much fun was had by all.<br>
<br>
So that we can share it with you all, here is the 'teaser' we used in-guild to drum up some interest in the raid. <br>
<br>
All you need to know about this story is that Chey is a female Wood-Elf Druid, Kaptain is a male Human Warrior and Helix is a male Dwarf Cleric. Zorreau Flatcap is a fictional tatty tabloid reporter created for the purpose of this story and Marianne Greatheart is another fictional reporter writing for the more upmarket North Freeport Guardian.<br>
<br>
New post on the Guild Message Board :<br>
<br>
PART 1 : Title : Naked hysterical Wood-Elf, the FULL story!<br>
<br>
Our roving investigator Zorreau Flatcap reports:<br>
=======================================<br>
<br>
The night was dark and warm, and little Chey the druid thought there would be nothing nicer than a skinny-dip in the sea at North Ro. It was easy to get to and the night would protect her from prying eyes. Or so she thought...<br>
<br>
She discarded her clothes in a neat pile on the beach and slipped into the balmy embrace of the warm waters. After floating happily for a short while, she suddenly became aware of guffaws and taunting shouts coming from the beach.<br>
<br>
&quot;It was horrible, horrible!&quot; sobbed the little druid, now safely home in the Guild House in the comforting arms of Kaptain (the broad and hunky warrior who considers himself her Special Protector).<br>
<br>
&quot;I looked at the beach and there were these swarthy lowlife desert-scum staring at me, and pointing and laughing... And then two of them started waving my clothes at me!&quot;<br>
<br>
'Come on out and get 'em then, darlin'!' one of them shouted, as the others cackled, nudging each other in the ribs. 'Yeah, come on sweetheart, if yer do a little bit of dancin' for us, we might just feel like givin' 'em back to ya!' And then... oh the shame of it... one of the others, a tall brutish looking thug, grinned hugely at me, his wolf-like teeth flashing in the moonlight and called out 'I know what you wood-elves are like. Really _supple_. Hur hur!! Yer might even be able ta make a bit of spendin' money, know what I mean.' They all fell about hysterically. One or two of them were making, how shall I put it? Obscene jiggling motions with their hips. It was _awful_!&quot;<br>
<br>
At this point, Chey dissolved into tears and had to be consoled by the brawny Kaptain, who gave her one of his huge handkerchiefs to stem the flood. He then took up the story.<br>
<br>
&quot;After a little while of tormenting the poor girl, and realising she wasn't coming out of the water for anything, they got bored and slunk back to the slurry-pit they call home, taking all her clothes with them. Those thieving bandit scum...! Once she realised they had gone, the poor thing dragged herself out of the water and bravely made her way up the coast to near the barbarian fishing village, where I discovered her. I had noticed she was missing from the Guild House and had gone searching for her. Fortunately I was able to cover her with my cloak as I carried her back to Freeport. Those scurvy b*stards need a good kicking! How _dare_ they pick on decent upstanding people. And a girlie at that!&quot; (At this point I thought I saw Chey scowl through her tears at Kaptain). &quot;Er, I mean it's not right for them to pick on single women... er, no, single woodelves I mean. Scum!&quot;<br>
<br>
* * * * * * * * * *<br>
<br>
Announcement from Kaptain :- In the light of the FOUL treatment of one of our members by those deviant abominations of sand-maggots, I feel we have NO alternative but to take to them the thing they are so badly in need of - A GOOD ARSE-KICKING!!!!! And then we'll see who's 'really supple'! We know that they have lots of loot such as rings, bronze weapons and gold so we'll take it off them as payment for what they did to poor Chey. Are you all with me?<br>
<br>
* * * * * * * * * *<br>
<br>
A few days later, a new post appeared on the Guild Message Board :<br>
<br>
PART 2 : The TRUTH - Chey speaks!<br>
<br>
An expose (of a certain journalist's interpretation of the facts) by our star reporter, Marianne Greatheart:<br>
<br>
Following the publication of a tasteless story about the &quot;torture of a naked Wood Elf and her rescue by a gallant Man&quot;, I was prompted to investigate further - there seemed to be certain elements which did not quite ... add up (unless you are a certain grubby little gnome journalist, whose &quot;work&quot; I and my colleagues at the North Freeport Guardian are familiar with). Yesterday, I was able to visit the Eight Virtues Guild House and talk freely and openly with Kaptain and Chey, and obtain the _true_ facts about the story...<br>
<br>
MG : Chey, would you like to give our readers _your_ version of the events that occurred that night?<br>
<br>
&quot;What that journo wrote! It's a load of rubbish! I _never_ cried like that in front of him, and Kaptain certainly _didn't_ have his arms round me! And when those slimy slugballs were watching me and shouting, I gave them as good as I got! (Kaptain sometimes forgets that folk can't see me when I'm camo'ed, and when he's been out with the lads and they all roll home from the docks after a few drinks, if I'm quiet I can get to hear all _sorts_ of filthy insults. You have to remember, I'm a WOOD ELF DRUID, we can hide behind a blade of grass AND we can camo!) So I made sure those dervishes knew I was really CROSS! And I camo'ed when I got out of the sea and was walking home quite happily when I saw Kaptain on the path and borrowed his cloak. I certainly didn't act the way that stupid journo said I did. But I'm really pleased Kaptain has used it as a good excuse to try and motivate the guild to go and do some kicking.&quot;<br>
<br>
MG : Kaptain, it seems that you didn't have to &quot;gallantly rescue&quot; Chey at all?<br>
<br>
&quot;Well I HAD gone out looking for her, when I heard her call my name and ask for my cloak. Of course I asked what was wrong, and she explained she was butt-nekkid under that camo (what I'd give for x-ray specs...) so of course I handed it over and turned my back - a girl's gotta be decent before a bloke sees her!&quot;<br>
<br>
MG : Of course, dear reader, you see we can't expect men to control themselves when confronted by a disadvantaged naked woman. So, Kaptain, are you still determined to exact bloody retribution on the Dervishes? It seems, after all, that the events of that night were not quite as extreme as we have all been led to believe.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of COURSE we're going to go and give those b*stards the beating they deserve! Just because they didn't cause poor Chey to have a nervous breakdown doesn't mean they weren't SERIOUSLY out of order. They still stole her clothes and laughed as they tormented her with their ... suggestions! And, after all, they didn't know she was a druid and had camo. She could have ended up in a VERY bad way. Nope, they HAVE to be shown they can't act like that and expect to get away with it. That nasty thuggish leader of theirs will have a short ...appointment... with me and my Berserker Sword!&quot;<br>
<br>
MG : Well there we have it, folks. The Dervishes are going down! So, all you willing volunteers, go and sign up now. You KNOW it is the right thing to do! Let's hear it for Truth, Justice and the Eight Virtues way!<br>
<br>
This honest report brought to you by Marianne Greatheart, North Freeport Guardian.<br>
<br>
==================================<br>
<br>
After the raid, here was our write-up :<br>
<br>
The Thump-A-Dervish Day : co-reported by Marianne Greatheart, North Freeport Guardian.<br>
<br>
At 6:55, Mog, Helix and Ornax met, soon joined by Elaari, Daza and Katto. Edwoods and Eklas helped hold the camp, a few hangers-on near the camp kindly moved to allow us full access.<br>
<br>
MG : &quot;The first blood is an Orc Raider, biting the dust at 6:59 (despite killing it before the planned start time, you don't get extra brownie points, Daza ;-) ) We are hoping the Orcs don't demand a recount. 7:00, the official start time - THEY'RE ALL HERE!!! This is incredible guys! The official start time arrives and everybody is here! (I've never seen anything like it!) Edwoods helps break the camp by kindly taking the Derv caster 'round the back for a quiet chat'. By 7:07, they are in full swing, pulling and knocking them down as fast as they can pop. Ooh, this looks as if it could be absolute magic!&quot;<br>
<br>
Edwoods was mainly using the Chains of Music to lull and slow the Dervs - it meant that we took a lot less damage and were really able to take them down fast. This freed up Katto (our brave backup healer) to step in and whack a few, plus chuck some Stuns into the fight. One of the Dervs swooped on lovely Elaari, but strangely was not able to do very much before Mog yelled 'Timberrrr!&quot; and it fell to the sand.<br>
<br>
By 7:30, the going was, by consensus, 'Sweet!'. And then, the moment we'd all been waiting for - the Ogre Derv Thug appeared. Helix yelled 'Chey said that's the one! Kill! Kill!' And, taking him at his word, our brave band took their tools to the Thug and soon there was a mighty thud as the Sands of Ro shook. The moon shone over the corpse and a mighty cheer was let loose.<br>
<br>
MG : &quot;They have the bit firmly between their teeth now. Anything could happen in the next two hours!&quot;<br>
<br>
At 7:50, the second Thug appeared - just as big but twice as angry! With Helix blinding the beast and Elaari's elemental going berserk, the Thug still managed to do a couple of hits for 32 on Ornax - ouch! With two clerics - we were able to recover quickly. Between Mog and Ornax making up some super 'socials', we really got into the spirit of the fight. (Thanks, guys!)<br>
<br>
MG : &quot;I don't believe it! Another two Thugs at the same time! This brings their total to four in less than an hour. Oh, these Dervs are getting their arses kicked and they don't like it! No they don't!&quot;<br>
<br>
8:00 - Elaari was the first Ding of the evening. She decided to swap her elemental for an Air one - nice stuns there!<br>
<br>
MG : &quot;Ooh look, there seem to be a few Orcs coming and going through the camp - oh no, my mistake, coming and _dying_! That'll teach them! Ooops, that leggy lady Derv seems to have noticed one of the healers at the back - ah, there you go, all three tanks seem to be having a word with her about it now. Yup, she seems to have gone for 'a little lie down!'&quot;<br>
<br>
MG : &quot;Aha, the Dervs are trying a new tactic - throwing out the casters in the handfulls. When will they realise these guys may look pretty, but they can't take much punishment! Victory to our home boys I think. What was that? Another Ding? Oh yes, the lady Paladin Mog has dinged 10, well done there!&quot;<br>
<br>
Day broke, and there popped another Thug, the fifth!<br>
<br>
MG : &quot;Ooh, not a good way to start the day! He didn't last long! What's this? A skeleton? He's got to be kidding - don't you just hate these greenies! Our party certainly do, and it's splattered!&quot;<br>
<br>
8:45 The Ogre wife of the first Thug appeared.<br>
<br>
MG : &quot;No offence Oobar, but she's SO ugly even you'd have had second thoughts! She drops down hard! Not a pretty woman! Dearie me, but her husband wasn't pretty either!&quot;<br>
<br>
8:55 Oops, disaster - we were out of pulling arrows - fortunately Nordmann turned up and brought his Familiar. He laid down some covering fire while Ornax legged it back to Freeport for supplies. Ornax was able to bank some of the huge stack of Derv Rings and also liquidated the growing mountain of bronze weapons and smaller gems. Having filled up on basic arrow supplies, he then returned to make the arrows in the brief intervals between Dervishes.<br>
<br>
Between 9:00 and 9:30, we nailed another Thug, heard a Ding 11 from Katto, buried _another_ thug, then heard a Ding 13 from Daza! Keep it up guys!<br>
<br>
We had to say goodbye to Edwoods at about 9:30 too. We really appreciated your help Ed, and once you had gone, boy did we notice the difference. We kept going, but the Dervs were now hitting for their full strength. Despite announcing he had a film to see in half an hour, Daza didn't say goodbye until only a few minutes before it was due to start! Ornax commented that you can tell it's a good group when nobody wants to leave!<br>
<br>
MG : &quot;Well, it's almost 10:00 local time here, and they're down to five in the party - the Dervs are starting to mount up now, there's always at least one in the camp. Our brave crew are gritting their teeth and have sworn that they will hang on in there until Ornax Dings. He is so close!&quot;<br>
<br>
10:17 Ornax dinged 11. Yay! A Hold Pull order was given.<br>
<br>
MG : &quot;Their cheers of delight are interrupted, as to their horror, they realise an Iksar Shaman is training a mummy and a couple of Dervs from the camp onto them. Oh no! Despite a warning from Helix to him which I am sure the whole zone must have heard, he is doing it again! Ornax - watch those hp's, you're down to under half! Oh no - what's that? Out of Mana! This could be a disaster! Here comes the Iksar again with another Derv, an orc and a puma. Aha, threatening to Petition has worked! He's backed off. (Hah - what can you expect of a scum-drinker called _Fleshcleaver_!) The brave group are working their way through all the monsters and pull back without casualties! Phew!&quot;<br>
<br>
Elaari had some connection problems about this time and found herself standing in the combat zone LD and unable to move. Fortunately the Iksar stopped training and she was able to log safely.<br>
<br>
MG : &quot;Well, they've regrouped in the Tunnel (despite Ornax missing the entrance in all the dust), and here comes Elaari, safe and sound. A quick loot check reveals that apart from Katto (who was light on rings and had not found any bronze weapons), everyone is happy with the split of loot items. A quick reshuffle and the gallant group decide that after a really good evening of arse kicking, it's time to go back to the Guild House for some of the special Ale that Kaptain bought just for this occasion, Helix's Braised Mutton Pie and slices of Chey's Apple Tart.&quot;<br>
<br>
So, what was the monster head-count? Well according to my log parser, we killed 130 Dervishes, 8 Thugs, some orcs, a mummy or two and a few bugs. An amazing number!<br>
<br>
Dings : Elaari 13 Magician, Moghedien 10 Paladin, Katto 11 Cleric, Daza 13 Paladin, Ornax 11 Paladin (Helix got 4 full yellows of level 13).<br>
<br>
Casualties : NONE! YAY! (apart from all those Dervs!)<br>
<br>
Fun had : LOTS!<br>
<br>
<br>
So, in conclusion, Kaptain's Call to Battle resulted in a really fun evening of Giving Those Dervishes What They Deserve. A right, royal ARSEKICKING! Thanks HEAPS to everyone who helped. :-D This Raid report was prepared by Helix and Chey with ediorial comments from Marianne Greatheart, North Freeport Guardian. A truly joint effort!<br>
<br>
===================================<br>
<br>
We also then posted a Victory Song!<br>
<br>
Victory song for Derv Camp kickers! :-)<br>
<br>
A congratulations song for all those hard working guys and gals who helped to make the kicking of the Derv Camp such an incredubly fun time - Well done everyone!<br>
<br>
To be sung LOUD with quaffing of flagons of ale whilst returning from North Ro<br>
<br>
To the tune of Rockin' All Over The World- by Status Quo!<br>
<br>
Here we are, and here we are<br>
And here we go<br>
Bashin' the Dervies, lootin' to go<br>
Here we go-o-o<br>
Kickin' all over the camp<br>
<br>
We smote em, we bashed em<br>
We kicked em and smashed em<br>
Mayhem and glory, a hell of a story<br>
Here we go-o-o<br>
Kickin' all over the camp<br>
<br>
===================================<br>
<br>
We ALSO then posted an appreciation song or two for our gallant Bard Chaperone, Edwoods!<br>
<br>
Songs for Edwoods, a reward for your help instead of cash!<br>
<br>
Edwoods - without your help in the 'Derv Camp Kicking' things would have gone much more slowly for us. We REALLY appreciated the help you gave us. Your patience and tolerance were very welcome. There wasn't a lot of treasure, so since we cannot pay you with gold, these are for you, we hope you like them. Money can't buy fame like this :-)<br>
<br>
to the tune of Oh Very Young - by Cat Stevens<br>
<br>
Oh Wood-Elf bard,<br>
What will you sing us this time?<br>
We're only dancing on this earth for a short time,<br>
But you help us see better days.<br>
You carry all the songs of your heart with you,<br>
While you help your gallant friends in their battles.<br>
You sing to us your bard-songs,<br>
We hope you always will.<br>
Your singing makes our journey lighter still.<br>
<br>
=====<br>
<br>
to the tune of California Dreaming - the Mamas and the Papas<br>
<br>
All the Dervs were there,<br>
As the sky turned grey.<br>
Our army full of hope,<br>
On our battle day.<br>
A singing bard came to us,<br>
A shining ray.<br>
Wondrous bardic singing,<br>
Smoothed our weary way.<br>
<br>
As we heard his songs,<br>
Our hearts filled with light.<br>
He pulled the warmth of sunshine,<br>
Into our darkened night.<br>
Without his help we never<br>
Would have found our way.<br>
Wondrous bardic singing<br>
Fixed our Victory Day.<br>
<br>
(Readers' Note - the above huge pile of stuff was written by Dan (Helix/Kap) and Su (Chey) with the help of lots of chocolate and coffee. They are not yet recovered from the effort.)<br>
