If shit was bugged then it was cause JD pulled it down headlessly since they didnt care how many adds came with Dain.<br>
<br>
That you should &quot;pulling&quot; is not much of a warning, since it can mean so much more than training Dain with all his guards down. Also it was not directed at Mortalis from what I could understand from it. Like I said in the past we have been very kind to give both fair warnings, and fair enough time for JD to try and make their pulls. All we have gotten in return have been exploited tricks and childish shouts from your members and often in french thinking we cant understand you.<br>
<br>
Like I said Dain was just the last straw, its been a long chain of events that have caused us to be pissed off. But now you have finally reached the goal of making us totally pissed off.<br>
<br>
Im trying to get a puplic response from JD that all of the above guilds can trust as a last chance for JD to better the situation before it gets a lot worse. If there is none then we will give no more fair warnings, if JD is in our way of pulling then i hope they can handle what we pull till you are out of the way.<br>
<br>
I cant speak for the other guilds but i think you will find them disregarding you in somewhat the same way. JD you might not like your own rules when you have to face them from equal opponents. Its all up to you now. <p><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="2" BGCOLOR=" #A00000">

<br>
When Mortalis KS a pull they claim it was a TRAIN !<br>
When Mortalis TRAIN they claim it was a PULL !<br>
<br>
and when you say : "Im trying to get a puplic response from JD"<br>
you should rather say : "Im trying to sap JD reputation publicly"<br>
<br>
<br>
Finaly, you ksed guards and seneshal, and almost Dain, if one of YOUR member had not cast mem blur to preserve his faction.<br>
<br>
I understand racing in nTov for the fun of big fight, a full evening guild slaying party with great loots. <br>
But rush and try to shaft JD on Dain ?!...<br>
... a less than 2 minutes fight with "average" loots !! <br>
What are YOU trying to prove us ?!<br>
<br>
And then Lenos, you come back whinning, speaking about "childish" manners of JD, colporting rumors, spiting on JD ... *sigh*<br>

<br>
<br>
Hello everyone.<br>
<br>
Firstly I would like to say I've tryed hard to stay out of discussion, since this of course is an 'topic' that affects me, and personal emotions may be taken into the picture. I will try to substain from this and try to explain how this whole issue happened, and how so many arguements and so called facts are untrue and pure lies, attempts of hiding the real facts and truth.<br>
<br>
There is not people that prevent that they are the only ones posting facts, they post their point of view, or their facts or info of the issue at hand. Respect that, just as I respect peoples opinions and point of views, regardless of the truth behind it - that - is another thing that gets relieved further on anyhow, and those 'facts' will get jumped over because of them being lies.<br>
<br>
Let me explain to you - Tindall - how memblur type of spells work. You claim that a mob (in this case Dain Frostreaver IV) that gets memblured won't warp back by it, and that he simply warped back by himself. This can't happen if the fight wasn't close to a wall, and the fighters were pushing him into the wall - this - wasn't the case here. A guild like Mortalis that have killed Avatar of War 5 times, and all other kind of mob's can handle a thing like this without getting Dain Frostreaver IV pushed into a wall causing a warp, don't you agree with me there? I think you do. Honestly.<br>
<br>
Now sir, understand this there is different kind of memblur's one is called Memory Flux, which I will tell you about soon, just hang in there and keep reading, this spell is specially designed for high level mob's, and it won't wipe the whole hate list of a mob at times, but if it's casted in chains, over and over again the mob can loose it's 'memory' and thus warp back, still having people low down on it's hate list, and start to summon. This is a fact. You may ask any experienced enchanter how this works.<br>
<br>
Memory Flux is a 2.5 second cast spell, with a 12 second recast time. Thus you can see it's a fast casting spell, and it's easy to chain cast it, since the recast is only 12 seconds, now i take into action - more then one memblur kind of spell was memorized.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This spell reduces the target's &quot;hate list,&quot; and is very rarely resisted.<br>
This spell has many potential applications, among them unfrenzying NPCs from their targets, allowing casters to burn heavily without attracting unwanted attention, and terminating combats with non-hostile NPCs.<br>
<br>
It can also be used to terminate NPC pets that have lost their masters.<br>
<br>
This spell is designed for use against high level NPC's, with reduced resist rates and greater hate reduction. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It reduce the hate list, it's hard to resist - this was most likely the spell that was used - since it was a high level mob. Why do you think it can terminate NPC pets? Maybe it have something to do by the fact that if a mob forgets partially or fully it will go back to what it was instructed to by the code of the game before an attack was ordered? - Yes. Nowhere have it been stated that a mob will forget everything directly from a spell like this, look.. the fight was with alot of person engaging the mob, it's even harder to reduce the hate list to zero by doing that.<br>
<br>
When the membluring was executed, while the mob was engaged, a part of the hatelist was terminated, the mob was confused - warp occured - still, he had hate left for several people - this is why some people got summoned. Not all. One of the officers of Justice Divine told to me, directly that we were the first people (a monk in our guild) who engaged Dain, and pulled him, well if this was the case - there is NO space - for argueing. You already admitted this. First engaged = Mortalis. Otherwise it's classificed as kill stealing, and you already knew this. So instead of engaging at the same time, you caused problems - membluring - and training. First hand - training was executed, of several mob's, when you noticed Mortalis could handle this - without - dying, you had to think of something else that is hard to proove, after all Guild word vs Guild word - is always a hard issue to solve for a GM. So this is where Memblur comes into the picture. It was a race, it was a fair race. You even admitted Mortalis engaged the mob first, you should have NOT interfered what so ever. You also claimed to me all of you logged out as we engaged Dain to wait... Why lie?<br>
<br>
I tryed to ongo a discussion with one of your officers regarding this matter, but it just went around in circles, you all say different things - which imply - there is facts and info's that isn't true - and that what I'm saying are most likely true. I'm not lying in what I'm saying at all - i see zero reason in doing this. What do you win by it?<br>
<br>
<br>
Some answers to quotes,<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm afraid people flaming JD about that warp have no clue, or just have poor knowledge of the way the game works ...&quot;<br>
<br>
Sir, I explained to you above how this game works regarding to this matter. Read it through, then bite your tounge.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Anyway I'm glad to see that people like Trackfinder still run on Norrath, and i urge you to read her post on Schatze's brilliant thread.&quot;<br>
<br>
Trackfinder is a guy. This only show how little facts you got right. Also, what does another thread have to do with this thread and discussion at hand? Zero. Bite your tounge.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me now continue.<br>
<br>
I don't hold grudge to individual's until they've prooved to me their assholes or nice people. Before this I judge them indifferently. Remember that. Let me try to clarify a few things:<br>
<br>
I got friends and people I like in Justice Divine, and what Nanlayan said about Justice Divine. It is the way you act during raids, together - towards others - that hurt me, and makes me sad and annoyed and frusrated at the same time. I want to have fun, not issues all the time, i easily get burned out having all this over me. It hurts, get that. Still, like what I said - I DO NOT hate a person what wears the tag &lt;Justice Divine&gt; until he or she have prooved to me that he or she is an ass hole. Just the way I judge any other people.<br>
<br>
It's just.. It's hard to judge and 'like' a person from a guild, that have caused so much misery and pain and annoyance and frustration. I bet you all can feel like this - still - I won't judge anyone differently, (see above) before they've prooved they deserve it.<br>
<br>
Everyone have their up's and downs, and maybe one day you get into issues and argueing like this, and right then your emotions take control and you feel hate towards 'that' guild, this shouldn't happen - maybe - not everyone agree or understand with what is happening, ever thought of that? Still, I think those people I like in Justice Divine, shouldn't be apart of what is done at that present time then.. But this can be hard too, their in the guild, they work together and is a part of it, It easily gets hard then, then there's the group pressure..<br>
<br>
I don't fucking get how some of you start to acting like racists towards a country because of what a guild does being most members from 'that' country - that is totally wrong, and shouldn't ever be thought of. This is just like what I said about judging a person indifferently until he or she have prooved he or she need another kind of judgement depending on his or her actions. You really have no reason to hate someone from a country because of what one or several do from that country in a game or whatever this takes place. That's totally wrong, and I think I made it pretty clear why, right? Maybe X person from, let's say Sweden thinks different then Y person? Think of that, and please get a clue. People DO HAVE different point of views at the world, and they think different, act different, handle different etc.<br>
<br>
However, I think everyone shall play by the same rules, not any special kind of rules, that people act after, trying to bypass the policy of EverQuest/Verant without getting caught.<br>
<br>
Also, maybe I don't always agree with every single member in the guild I am in, but most of the time (if not always) - officers do not decide something that is against peoples mind.<br>
<br>
Justice Divine, you built your own reputation, no one else did. YOU acted, no one else did. Friends from my previous server, that previous were from the Karana Server (where you were before AB) told me similar things to what have happened on AB. That, also prooves this can not just be an incident. Really. Think of that too! Also, when so many people think what you sometimes (mostly) are doing is wrong, and unrespectful - against the policies - it also says something, no?<br>
<br>
Majouth, what is your problem, the first time I had the 'pleasure' to talk to you was while I were in Fungus Groove exp'ing, you all of sudden sent me a tell saying 'Your board sucks'. En, I replyed saying 'well, don't use it then'. Why are you even bothering posting useless posts, with crap on a board that sucks so much? Please get a clue. We did a corpse recovery for you, then after you got your rez, your camp secured, then. After all that - YOU - shouted and claimed us to have lagged you guys out causing a wipeout? . Sigh <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  You dissapoint me.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now to Nineveh,<br>
<br>
The actions made by some of your guild members, seems to be somewhat accepted, since they are still keeping their guildtag - and have they even got some kind of warning whatsoever? By you admitting you were doing wrong here - what says it can't occur again, and again .. and again?<br>
<br>
Nothing. And yes I feel sorry for the Lead GM of AB, because of all problems that are caused when you, Justice Divine are involved in something. When were there petitions in action when Innit were racing, or Mortalis or Darkwind? Never, really. Just when you, Justice Divine are involved - this says pretty damn much, dosen't it?.<br>
<br>
You are also pointing out that some people from X and Y guild makes very stupid posts, with alot of crap and so called bullshit included in their posts. Well, please understand this and remember this: 'some' Justice Divine members do the same. So this isn't really a valid arguments, since this arguement can be used to counteract yours - this it becomes a circle without a end, useless.<br>
<br>
While you are trying to use the successfull kill of Aaryonar as your argument, being there all day long trying him, well that could really have been more valid, if this hadn't been the cause of a whole days of tryes. I mean, look at the previous time this thing was requested, your guild leader refused and said no against this (e.g guild that kill Aaryonar gets NToV). <br>
So this time - when we didn't even have people that early (most people work or have school), and you kept trying him, or her several times i assume - and eventually won, we already had waited a very long time, and eventually proceeded clearing our path. There was no training or kill stealing, or leap frogging involved here - since - there was such a long time that already had passed.<br>
<br>
Regarding Lanos, you trained Dain to the zone in, Lanos is kos to Dain Frostreaver IV - Dain used his ability banish, to make Lanos get teleported down the pit.<br>
<br>

I agree with you, JD members sending you tells to insult you about the AB forum is not a noble reaction at all. <br>
<br>
We need to be really careful about the lack of communication, because this let too much space for interpretation.<br>
<br>
Venven, if I well remember you are a previous member of Darkwind and you are now wearing the Mortalis tag. Your point of view is not objective and not out of interest. <p>Darkiger Wolfanic, Sorcerer of the 60th season -- Justice Divine -- <BR>

All posts er bitching over JD members, and when they finaly do make a reply they try and make people look stupid, or twist what they are saying, or even talk around. <br>
But not a single reply if its true or not what people say about you.. this post won't ever end you know, less someone can say something solid.<br>
<br>
..and no im not taking any sides, just my point of wiev to this Topic! <p><img src="http://darkey.homepage.dk/pic/Szin.GIF" border="0">

<br>
Don't try use that as a argument to avoid answering to what I put up. While this is true - it just means I have seen the whole issue at hand from 2 sides, not only one. Making what I said even more interesting and is subject to debate. So please, try to restructure the way you think and rethink, then answer to what I said again.<br>

Mem flux is nothing but a partial and lure mem blur that still has nothing to do with warping. Mobs have no &quot;memory&quot;, they only &quot;remember&quot; their hate list and sometimes their spawn point. Or maybe some Norrath Dr Freud (you ?) has made discoveries about mobs mind while studying &quot;confused&quot; mobs (what is a confused mob !?). If so, the world should know. Write a book !<br>

<br>
Yesterday you deleted a post from Winol under this topic with the reason that this post was an offense to your own person.<br>
<br>
I read the post from Winol too and I am really amazed why you deleted it. It was not more offensive than some other post I read on this forum.<br>
<br>
Anyway I am NOT telling Winol is right or wrong. I am just telling that I am confused about the reasons you deleted his post.<br>
<br>
You asked me to talk to Winol in order him to stop wrtiting those kind of posts because it means harassment for you. I gave you my word I will help you in this matter, but I am first of all going to INVESTIGATE the matter, to know what I am speaking about.<br>
<br>
Dear Venven, perhaps you could help me by telling me what was your previous server and what were your characters' name on this server.<br>
<br>
I am not someone who is interwoven with some matter he has no clue about it.<br>
<br>
Thank you for helping me to understand the issue.<br>
Best regards,<br>

<br>
Just as we do with other posts, we did the same with those posts - first of all some were by newly made accounts which is not allowed to just use to 'flame' - secondly it's a invasion of a persons privacy to not ONLY add that it wasn't even true what were said, I'm sure Slejk can back me up on this.<br>
<br>
If there's something Winol wants now, he have to ask me or Slejk, we have better things to do then monitor the board for all his 'newly created accounts'.<br>
<br>
I think he realise that too. <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/fantoniusbaylecommunitycentrefrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=221.topic&index=200><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/udarkiger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darkiger</A> </span><br><br> <span class=usertitle>Ry'gorr Elite</span><br>  Posts: <b>68</b><br></td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#6699F>Posted: 3/8/02 8:44:59 am</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Re: but</span><hr size=1> Maybe we might go on with this discussion through emails.<br>
