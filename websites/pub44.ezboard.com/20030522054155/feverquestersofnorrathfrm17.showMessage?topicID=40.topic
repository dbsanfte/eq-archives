<br>
This journal was begun when you were born, my beloved daughter, for you and any others who might wish to know of my life. Necessity has kept and keeps me apart from you, but know that you are never far from my thoughts and I shall always endeavour to send you such assistance as I can as you make your own way in this world, both in material goods and in those dear friends of mine as should pass through Kelethin with the promise to look out for you. Perhaps too my words themselves may prove to provide some guidance, both in what I did right and what I have done wrong, for no life is without mistakes….<br>
<br>
I was born in Kelethin, and within an hour, my life was dedicated in service to Tunare, the mother of all. I never knew my own mother, Lexia. She died at my birth, a tragic and inexplicable event nearly unheard of among those of our blood. My father Ravenni - &quot;The Lion&quot; as he was known among the folk of Kelethin - was devastated at her loss, which left him with the care of two infants, myself and my sister, Raynn. He was reluctant to leave us, as Raynn especially reminded him of his lost Lexia, but his very strong sense of duty and his responsibilities as a ranger pulled and tore at his very soul, for he knew that in this time of epic struggles he was sorely needed elsewhere. All too soon he married the druid Varda and brought her home to us. Soon after the birth of their daughter, our half-sister Kemie, Ravenni left quite suddenly one morning, his presence urgently required overseas for some great battle with the evil forces of Innoruk. He thought us safe in our step-mother's care, but within a short time Varda, too, was gone. She had always been a strange one, and quiet. I suppose she did her best for us but she was never meant to be tied down as a mother. Still there was something very mysterious and disturbing in her disappearance, for she vanished one day with no word to anyone, leaving the three of us all alone.<br>
     Raynn as eldest refused to let anyone else step in to govern us. We had each other, and she and I had already begun our ranger training, benefiting much from the guidance and direction of Maesyn Trueshot and the others in the guild hall in Kelethin. I well remember starting out, building up my strength and weapons skills and filling out my pocketbook by tackling bats and wasps and skeletons near the ancient druid ring beneath the tree city. I remember too the first time that I died, slain ignobly by a bat, of all things, for I was weak and loth to run to the guards. The shock of dying was less than that of finding myself reborn and faced with the distasteful need to loot my own corpse, but I found that I soon adjusted to this for I was often reckless and death seemed almost to become an obligatory daily occurrence. One day Ran Sunfire chanced to speak to me when I showed up for training, and from her I learned of the rash of fires started in our beloved woods by the pixie tricksters, and arranged with her to exterminate all of them I should see. She rewarded me handsomely for pixie dust as proof of their demise, and Dill Fireshine soon had an assignment for me as well, collecting orc hatchets from pawns roaming the area, for which he gave me better weapons.<br>
     By my sixth or seventh season, I was tentatively venturing to the north of Kelethin where orcs had made an incursion into our territory from the dark depths of Crushbone. Alone, I was afraid to venture far from the path for fear I would get lost - I was still so young and easily turned around, neglecting to attend to developing my skill of sense heading. And I learned that one must sometimes turn tail and run, as shameful as it felt to do so, for at times orcs seemed to appear from nowhere and join in the defense of one of their foul brethren whom I was in the process of beating into a pulp, usually at no little cost to my own health. Soon I was invited to join a party of like-minded souls to try our battle skills on Orc Hill. Some I fought with became boon companions and friends for life; others I met once and never again. The memory of those days and nights blurs now into one long seemingly continuous battle with only the companions changing. But of course it did not happen that way. I do remember one particularly frightful night when I totally lost my bearings on the hill and fled north instead of south, only to fall to the piercing thrusts of several orc spears on the very threshhold of Crushbone. Reawakening naked as the day I was born, I was terrified, for the orcs there were much stronger and more vile than those I had been battling, and I was uncertain too about the exact location of my corpse. As I hesitated near the northern lift, a kindly wood elf druid, Trinety, took it upon herself to gift me with Spirit of Wolf. To run so swiftly was astonishing to me. With an uplift of almost pure joy I set out and very speedily found my body and retrieved my belongings. Returning to the lift I thanked the young druid profusely and asked how I might repay her, but she merely laughed cheerfully and invited me to call upon her any time I was in need.<br>
     Of more impact however, was a chance encounter one day on the very brink of Orc Hill. There a young high elf palladin named Blakeley, with little thought of his own safety, stayed for hour upon hour casting wonderous shields upon the fighters and when need arose, laying on hands to bring them back from the very brink of death.  That day shone ever glorious in my memory, for there were many more victories for good than for evil as a result of Blakeley's kindness. I know not how many times in the midst of desperate battle I looked up to see him suddenly there, and was myself strengthened or the object of his healing touch, but I was always grateful and tried to let him know it as I turned to go on fighting. In the days and weeks that followed I would often see him there, or at the lift, always helping, and within me grew a deep respect for the purity of his kindness. Few words passed between us, instead usually just a smile or wave of recognition. The feeling grew inside me that if I ever had the chance I would choose such a path of selflessly helping others, for he was truly an heroic role model....<br>

There were so many whom I liked for their skill and bravery, or sometimes for their very recklessness or ability to make me laugh. Too many of the names have faded from my memory over time, good people that I just lost track of as the seasons turned. Among the first were Dulben and Maedowalen, Odonicus and Amemait, Toralon and Alkusanat, Sodak, Rillibee and Wizaar. One or more of them always seemed to be near and if we were not fighting together, we nearly always had time for a greeting in passing. I encountered the druid Sodak one evening on the platform above the orc lift when he had just earned the right to cast his treeform spell, along with another whose name I do not now recall. Of course they had to show off then and there and spin and do mock battle with one another. They were giddy with the newness and the need to celebrate, and when I stopped to chat and share their joy, these two initiated me into the finer art of drinking. Like the silly children that we were then, we spent an hour or two drunk and levitating, leaping from the top of Kelethin to see how far we could float and laughing uproarishly at each other.<br>
     Time passed. My friends began to disappear one by one as they began their journies to other lands. Some tried to persuade me to go along with them, but I was always too afraid. I think I was with the young wizard Toralon and bard Alkusanat on Orc Hill the night Blakeley invited us to meet him inside Crushbone. The other two were eager to go, having managed to find their way there some time before, but I was quite reluctant to go where I had not been before and very nearly - albeit reluctantly - declined. Between the three of them they promised to watch out for me amidst assurances they would see I came forth safely again, and so I went along. The dark tunnel loomed so ominously, marked by Crush's evil banners… coming out into Crushbone was little better, still horribly dark and utterly confusing to eyes that had never looked upon it. I remember feeling absolutely terrified as I followed my companions to the slave cabin where Blakeley waited. We crept over a bridge past sleeping orcish guards, and over rocky ramps and down again and I was quickly lost. Blakeley had us wait beside the cabin while he snuck into the caves and tempted orc slavers out for us to surround and kill. We had his shields to help us and make us braver, and many an evil minion of Emperor Crush fell to our blades that night, the very ground beneath our feet taking on the hue of blood. When we ransacked the dead we sometimes found keys, and to our joy were able to free a number of poor elven or dwarvish slaves who had somehow fallen into Crush's wicked hands and were forced to labor in this pit of despair. When Blakeley was compelled at last to leave, we felt our youth and weekness and soon crept out the way we had come in, knowing we had little chance to stand alone against so many vile foes without him, but vowing to return.<br>
     In the days and nights that followed, Crushbone soon became familiar to me and I liked nothing more than the excitement of venturing in and stalking, alone or with others, the enemies of light and good. By then I had my own spells and delighted in them although they were so minor. Remembering so well how blessed I had felt when I was younger and received the same from such as Blakeley and Trinety, I often stopped at the starting point of the orc lift or on Orc Hill on the way, to buff and heal where and when I could or was most needed. Although sometimes these gifts were asked of me, most often they were not. For me the reward was in the joy I felt in giving, and the occasional astonished or delighted smile or stammered word of thanks. Blakeley noticed, for he was still often around, and recognized a kindred spirit. Shyly I admitted he had served as my example and that it had just seemed the right thing to do. We both thought perhaps someday such dedication to service might draw enough like-minded souls together to form our own guild, but this dream was for the distant future.<br>
     I was growing up and maturing as a fighter, and perhaps in other ways as well although I did not know it. One day when I had just visited the bank on business, I was stopped on my return to the lift by a high elf named Thaddeus who spoke to me. He asked quite courteously if he could inspect me, and I found myself granting his wish. A few moments later he presented me with gifts of earrings, rings, and a necklace, his tradeskill happening to be that of jeweler. I stood a moment, dumbstruck at this unexpected kindness, for each was imbued with magic to lend me some small increase in strength or agility or charisma. Smiling, he urged me to put them on, then asked to inspect me once again. This time beneath his admiring gaze and the honeyed words that he spoke, the inspection seemed so intimate a thing I felt almost naked, and I found myself blushing profusely. Thaddeus remained my friend for some time after, stopping by now and then to give me some new item he considered useful to me, and asking nothing in return but the chance to admire me once again wearing the jewelry he had crafted.<br>
     From that moment on I encountered more and more strangers who stopped to consider me, some asking before they took the liberty of inspection, some doing it as if it was their perfect right, and probably considering their high levels compared to mine, it was. I endured these invasions of my privacy, eyes downcast and trying not to squirm, but could not overcome the habit of blushing at this unasked for intimacy. They all gave me gifts, often a weapon or armour item superior to what I was wearing. None would accept payment, insisting they only wanted to help a young ranger starting out in life. Their collective kindness to me was well-nigh overwhelming. Among the first I encountered in this fashion was Thoran, a truly kind-hearted ranger, who gave me a Velium Morning Star one day.<br>
     I had not seen Sodak for some time when he appeared one day and asked me to go with him to Butcherblock. Already he had progressed so far as wolf-form, his rapid rise a matter to marvel at and admire. Except for a few careful trips along the pathway to Kaladim to turn in belts from the orcs of Crushbone, I was not familiar with this mountainous region, but he pled so insistently that I at last consented, to my later regret. He had some scheme in mind to attack the guards there - presumably corrupt or so I found myself hoping - and thought my small skills might be some help or that somehow he might help me advance myself just soaking up experience while he killed. I did not know what I was doing or really understand what he intended; casting one very minor spell drew the guard's attention to me and before I had a chance to catch my breath I was lying dead in unknown territory. Of course Tunare's will brought me back to life near Kelethin right away. Unhappily I made my way back to the pass into the mountains, where Sodak met me, terribly contrite, to lead me to my corpse. As soon as I had recovered my belongings, he disappeared. I had no clue where I was or how to get home, and I confess that his behavior angered me greatly and left me feeling not a little hurt. I wandered lost for quite a while before I came upon the path that would take me back to Greater Faydark, and on arrival there I fled into the woods alone, where I proceeded to get terribly drunk. This too was Sodak's fault, as he had presented me with 10 bottles of elven wine before we left Kelethin earlier, and they were too easily to hand after what followed. I downed most of them one after the other, an action I would recommend to no one. The forest vanished into lines and sharp planes and angles, I could neither stand nor sit comfortably, and had anything at all attacked me then I would have been dead and might never have come back, an object of Tunare's censure. My recovery took a long, long time that night; the shame of my behavior is with me still.<br>
     Life did not grow easier, but more difficult, and it was my male companions who made it so, or my reactions to them. Oh, Tuilere, my dear daughter, I hope and pray that you will show better sense than I did. Fight along side of them, and be friends, but do not let them lead or tempt you into foolishness! Guard your heart child, lest it bring you unhappiness and sorrow such as I have known….<br>

I enjoyed my youth immensely, dear, and gloried daily that the gods had gifted me with such a blessing as life in Norrath! At times I cowered like some weakling afraid to take a single step into the unknown. Sometimes both blood and temper ran quite as hot and fiery as the color of my hair, and either my joy of life or battle-fury swept me recklessly and heedlessly into adventure of one sort or another. And you must not fault the men for paying me attention - I was undeniably a flagrant flirt! <br>
     In time I forgave Sodak for what happened in Butcherblock. He was one of the strangest of my friends and Raynn could never understand why I put up with him, but some quality within him drew me on the rare occasions that I saw him. One day he presented me with a flower of no particular use but as an object of beauty; another time his gift was a perfect pink pearl he had found that made him think of me. Meanwhile he showed no hesitation in asking to borrow money from me, sometimes almost all I had to my name. Giving in to him made no sense and yet I could not refuse, even over Raynn's strenuous objections. Often it was days before he paid me back; that he made that effort at all seemed to surprise my sister.<br>
     I had too much trouble saying no to my friends. They could ask any sacrifice of me and I would give it. I had met a young bard Yuhji by then, in the depths of Crushbone, and Alkusanat from my more youthful days had become a frequent companion. These men vied for my attention, and seemed unwilling to share me with others, insisting even on fighting as a duo rather than in groups. I spent more time in Butcherblock hunting basilisks and orcs and gnolls, and in Crushbone near the slaver tents. <br>
     One night when Alkusanat and I hunted inside Crushbone, we dived into the pool near the cabin from the cliffs above, and somehow I hit my head and was knocked unconscious. I do not know if it was my air running out or slowly bleeding to death that killed me, but I did not come out of the water alive. By the grace of Tunare restored to life, I more or less routinely set off on the path north from Kelethin and was soon back beside the pool. The first glimmer of concern came when I could not find my body. Alkusanat, with his gift of bard song, finally located it in the deepest part of the pool, but even then I could not see it and hence could do nothing to summon it closer, and my swim skill was another I had neglected. For some reason even when granted my permission, he could not drag my body either. Braving the water, I managed to touch the corpse long enough to move it slightly, but quickly became disoriented and short of air and nearly drowned again before crawling out at the end of the pool. How long we tried and failed I do not know, but my despair grew in me until in desperation I cried out in petition to the gods, not really expecting any answer. So quickly that the memory still stuns me, a calm voice whispered in my head that my body was resting safely beside the cabin. Overjoyed, I found it and knelt to loot, and as I did so the voice gently cautioned me that I was very close to the edge of the pool and should be careful not to fall in again. I never saw the young assistant guide who saw fit to answer my prayer that night, but I thanked him humbly and with reverence and never forgot his kindness in taking pity on me in my plight, nor the speed of his response. <br>
     Soon after this, I met Thoran once again. Alone for a change, I was preparing to enter Crushbone when he appeared along with his friend Wyteraven, whom he was planning to assist. They were kind enough to invite me to join them, and Thoran led the two of us, both female, to the vicinity of the slave pits beside the castle and proceeded to buff us and pull a variety of orcs nearby for us to kill. We were fine until someone released Retlon Brenclog and he appeared with his pet, and suddenly Thoran was rooted to the ground, unable to cast. To my surprise, Thoran had never before encountered Retlon and knew nothing of him. Nonetheless the three of us managed to flee to safety and return to Greater Faydark without dying, which would have proven a much more serious matter for Thoran than for either of us, and the night's adventure ended. I fear that I offended him with my laughter over the incident, for he evidently misunderstood it as criticism of his skill and prowess as a fighter. (You should know, Tuilere, that men sometimes get upset at the thought they cannot always protect the females in their company or save them from death! There are times you must just humour them and curb your tongue as there is little else a female can do when male instincts take over. I have seen this happen even to the best comrades and companions in certain situations, and even when they were well aware any fault was mine and not their own!)<br>
     Thoran was another hero of my youth, and I confess I almost worshiped him. He was and is such a fine example of the ranger, brave and true, and so genuinely kind and helpful. I kept in touch with him, and often asked him for advice which was always freely given. When I began fletching, he not only gave me tips on how to raise my skill, but would often buy supplies for me when I was too far from a shop to make the journey easily or safely. He also told me how important my magic skills were and which to practice to insure I would be ready for future spells when I obtained them, and from that date I paid much more attention to the abilities I had formerly neglected, in order to become the best ranger I could possibly be and follow in his footsteps. I blush to tell you I idolized him, and had quite a crush on him, but he was far ahead of me in level and had another life to lead at just that time.<br>
     Faydwer - in the form of Greater Faydark, Crushbone, and Butcherblock, held me until my fifteenth season. Most of my friends had long departed for distant lands by then in search of adventure, and had long been urging me to follow. As soon as I had purchased the new spells my turning earned me, Raynn and a druid of our acquaintance, one Nabosu, virtually kidnapped me and spirited me by teleport across the ocean to Antonica. Bewildered by the suddenness of the change, I followed blindly as I was led through West Commons and Kithicor Forest up to Highpass Hold, unable even to glimpse much of my surroundings or to understand the need for such haste. Nabosu quickly bound my spirit at the threshhold of the Keep so that if I should die I would be brought back there to flesh by the will of Tunare, and was gone. Raynn went about her own concerns, and I was left in these unknown surroundings with no friends nearby, more totally alone than I had ever been....<br>

Kithicor Forest is one of the most terrifying places imaginable, where the misty gloom never quite lifts during the daytime hours and to stray from the path in the wrong place may bring sudden death, and which one must have an extraordinary disregard for life even to attempt to cross at night, when armies of undead roam restlessly in shere hunger for the souls of the living. Having traversed this horror successfully and made it into the rocky reaches of Highpass, one is tempted to breathe a sigh of relief and think all danger at an end, but the narrow passage broadens out into a rocky bay frequented by powerful Sharlock orcs, and it is a long run to the guards at the approach to the fringes of the settlement. Deeper in, getting lost is way too easy, for the rocky passages twist and wind in upon each other and one must memorize the turnings, for Mucktail gnolls frequent many of them. They lie in wait particularly for unwary travelers entering the pass from the Karanas side, and only the guards at the Keep entrance or the scattered Highpass citizens near the isolated outlying buildings may stand between the unlucky and agonizing death. Wandering around carelessly can also bring one suddenly into the lair of dangerous smugglers who will kill on sight, although others of this breed will just ignore you if you let them alone.<br>
     I spent my first day in Highpass exploring High Keep in order to familiarize myself with the amenities. There are bars, some merchants, and some guild representatives there as well as the bank. But there are also secret passageways and rooms in the upper reaches, some not safe to enter for the unwary, and in the lower parts savage Picklaw goblins have dug tunnels in an attempt to infiltrate the keep, and are a constant danger for all.<br>
     Very lonely, and very unsure of myself, I started out hating the place. I had grown accustomed to fighting solo in the depths of Crushbone, but I quickly learned that this approach was seldom possible in Highpass Hold. Safety - and success - lay in groups of at least four, and six if possible. And the narrow confines of the passages in general assured that only one group might fight at either end, at orcs or gnolls, at any given time. After letting it be known I was looking for a group, and what my class and skill level were, often I could only sit and wait for an opening. I worked on fletching to pass the time, but very quickly ran out of supplies. The nearest sources of materials were in the middle of Kithicor, which I was too scared to enter, or at the farthest point in East Karanas, a long day's journey into unfamiliar territory which had its own dangers. A time or two Thoran picked some up for me and delivered them, but always they were gone again too quickly and my hands left idle.<br>
     One of the most beautiful things about the pass is the waterfall and pool midway between the keep and the orc stronghold. Stray gnolls wander in at times and will attack you if they see you, but there are a few out of the way corners by the pool where one can stand and fish for many a long hour without interruption, and I often found peace and contentment there when nothing better offered. And I found pleasure too in beginning to learn the art of brewing, for there are many brew barrels in both keep and hold, and a variety of merchants to choose from who sell ingredients or supplies.<br>
     Fifteen seasons was almost too low for me to fight at gnolls, and certainly too low for orcs, but once I was able to join groups the experience came so fast that sixteen and seventeen came and were history almost without me becoming aware of the passage of time. I made many new friends on the ledge above the path where the gnolls appeared most frequently, some of whom have remained always dear to me. Here it was that I first met the bard Armonico, the enchanters Tisharmo and Kahrd, the rangers Layton and Corrvin, the druid Laliona, and the warrior Hoffan, and many, many others. Sometimes the gnolls came singly or in pairs and would be quickly dispatched, at other times more and more would pour in upon us and the fighting become so fast and furious we were extremely fortunate indeed if all lived through it. Some of my companions - Armonico, Tisharmo and Kahrd especially - were natural leaders, understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each of us and employing us most usefully, and under their direction I learned much of working efficiently with others, and came to appreciate the skills of other classes and how they might work best with my own particular stengths. The mix was constantly changing. Sometimes I would function as the primary tank; other times I might be the only one in the group with any heal skill and be called upon for that. Mostly of course, I was tank and caster and backup healer all in one. With practice one learns to assess the needs of the group and to do what must be done to keep all alive and do the most damage to the enemy. One of the great rewards of fighting these gnolls came the day I won the roll for my Polished Granite Tomahawk, a weapon now undervalued in the market but of inestimable value to a fighter in the teens and low twenties, at the very least.<br>
     After I hit eighteen I spent more time on the opposite end of the pass fighting orcs. I had by then become brave enough to venture twice into Kithicor during the daylight hours, sneak past the encampment of Sharlock orcs there, and go for training to the famous ranger Kithicor himself, meeting with awe the great bear that is always at his side. Fighting orcs in Highpass is a far more desperate and dangerous proposition than fighting gnolls. Their size makes the Crushbone orcs look like pygmies, and they hit far harder while there are shamans and medics and acolytes all casting at times to undo the damage swords and spells have inflicted. To die became a common occupational hazard when of a sudden two orcs became three or four or five or what seemed the whole clan at once. Tunare always saw fit to bring me back again swiftly, and as I gained in this confidence in her blessing, I came to laugh at death, spending mine freely in defense of my companions only to rise up and return and make the sacrifice again as often as it seemed necessary in the fight against the evil minions of Innoruk. One day that still sticks in my memory, I was fortunate to be part of a group mainly consisting of dwarfs, one of whom was named Mytank. We were all particularly gay that day for some reason, and filled with the joy of battle and good company. The drink flowed freely between us adding to the gaiety, and we traded languages in the brief lulls between fighting, which in spite of deaths (which included two of my own) went particularly well, with orc after orc falling beneath our shining blades. We all parted quite fondly when it was time to go, and I remember Mytank hesitating as we bowed our respect to one another. He told me that he and some others had been thinking for some time about forming a guild of like-minded companions, and that he hoped some day if such indeed came into being, a fighter such as I might consider joining them. The honour that he paid me, and the compliment in this, near overwhelmed me, but I knew that I was not yet ready to commit myself to a guild, not having found the right one to appeal to me, and besides, the guild he spoke of was a dream and might not ever see birth. We parted friends, and it was long before I saw or heard of him again….<br>

A time or two Alkusanat came by to visit and persuade me to go with him down the twisting tortuous ramp to the plains of East Karana, where he was more comfortable fighting. We did in general make an effective pair to group, my ranger skills and his as bard combining well. I would select a target first and track it, then together we fought and conquered, sharing the loot. One day as we were engaged against a fearsome lion there, a griffawn suddenly appeared and joined the battle against us. I had never encountered such a beast before but there seemed no reason to fear we could not defeat it and I turned to swing my blades in defense of my companion who was hard beset. His sudden scream in my ears warning me to flee to the ramp for my life came as both shock and surprise. To my wonder, Alkusanat was already wounded so grievously he had not much strength left, and my own health was undeniably low, while the beast seemed barely marked. Bard song served us as well or better than SoW, and we were able finally to outrun the griffawn and reach the safety of the pass. Only then did I learn that such beasts were deceptively beheld by innocents such as I, and that their power to withstand attack must be accorded a certain respect - two of our level were not enough to face one and it was better until we were older just to flee!<br>
     Back in Highpass, I found myself one day reaching the wonderful pinnacle of twenty seasons and could choose a surname. I was ready, having given much thought to this before, and called myself Cul`Ravenni - the last for my absent father, &quot;The Lion,&quot; the first meaning &quot;red&quot; or &quot;golden-red,&quot; taken from the color of my hair. A conceit perhaps, but I was pleased with it, for it seemed fitting somehow.<br>
     Soon afterwards, I felt it was high time to revisit my homeland of Greater Faydark and the tree-city of Kelethin, and so returned there for training. When I had finished honing my skills with the master, Maesyn Trueshot, he gave me a small bag and bade me fill it with certain materials - treant wood shards, a spool of dwarven wire, spider silk, and micro-servos - that could be combined in a quest for the Trueshot Bow. I was eager to acquire this fabled ranger's weapon and set out at once overseas again to Freeport. There locating one Jyle Wyndshot in the Hogcaller's Inn, I traded a number of small lanterns for the wood shards. I had heard that Trantor Everhot would only give dwarven wire to one who could provide him with a special drink called a Tumpy Tonic, and so taking ship east again, I stopped off at Sister Island to purchase a bag or two full of kiola nuts. In Kaladim in Butcherblock, I then located Tumpy Irontoe in his bar and persuaded him to make me a number of his famous beverages from the nuts. Trantor was not at his forge, but I managed to track him down and give him these and obtain the priceless wire only he seems able to make. With the wire and the wood shards, I had only two of the required four materials on Trueshot's list. The spider silks would be an easy matter to acquire either by purchase from younglings near Kelethin or by hunting down the lowly spiderlings in the forest. That left only the micro-servos, which must be obtained only from certain rogue clockworks in the Steamfont Mountains.<br>
    I had never been to Steamfont before, this odd region of steamvents and bare sharp ridges lying beyond the often dangerous lands of Lesser Faydark. Still, I had gained in skill and strength since the days of my youth, and one need not venture into the depths of Lfay to reach the pass to the gnome's land, and I found it a relatively short safe journey. Once there I found little indeed to harm me amongst the creatures that inhabit the region, and set out hunting. But this last required element - the micro-servo - proved in fact the hardest to acquire! For hours and days I hunted the clockworks - spiderlike machines that had run away from their makers and no longer obeyed them - slaying many (for they proved relatively easy to defeat) yet only one in ten proved to carry within the needed component for my quest. Sometimes friends would go with me to keep me company and help, as the task proved extremely frustrating and even boring. At last having acquired numbers that I thought enough, I returned to Kelethin and presented the full bag to Maesyn. He rewarded me with a treant staff and I was ready to try my skill at making the famous bow!<br>
     Alas, my first attempt failed. I was somewhat disappointed, but at the time I was not yet a master fletcher, having a skill of only 82 or 83, and I had come prepared with extra materials just in case, and so begged another bag of the guildmaster and tried again. Another staff… Placing it carefully in my fletching kit, again I added plane and wire and another micro-servo and tried combining them, and lo and behold! In my hands I held a Trueshot, on only my second try! Oh Tuilere, that day I was SO PROUD! Little did I know then that it would be many a long season before I would ever make another….<br>

I had been a flirt, and men paid me many compliments and much attention in my teens, but although I had felt affection for many of them, the strong hero-worship that I had for Thoran shielded me from any deeper involvement. He had long since married another and dropped from view and from my life, and now, at 20, I began to pay more attention to the other men I met. Often I fancied myself in love with this one or that, but always something was lacking and I found myself somewhat like a butterfly flitting to the next, with little thought or consideration for how deeply their emotions or their hearts might have been entangled. I did, in all honesty, try to warn them of what I thought to be my true nature and my inability to settle down with one, because I wanted no one to get hurt, but nonetheless some of them were. And then I met Lahja, and was swept up in one of life's grand passions - or so it seemed at the time. <br>
     We had a rather wild and tempestuous love affair that carried us to the brink of marriage, and you were the result. But something went terribly wrong, Tuilere, and the engagement ring I wore was never replaced by a wedding ring. Perhaps the tainted breath of Innoruuk fell upon him in his travels, for Lahja of a sudden was stricken with a madness of insanity that ate away at him and left only a shell of the man I thought I loved. I could not abandon him, having too much loyalty, but stayed long at his bedside nursing him until one day he simply vanished, perhaps translated by Tunare into another, happier life (or so I hoped). A mere shadow of myself, I gave your care into the hands of friends and relatives and departed Greater Faydark to wander where the wind took me, so long as it was far distant from my memories.<br>
     Much of what transpired in my next several seasons is tangled and confused or lost beyond recall. Some events are etched into my brain, but when they happened or in what order I cannot say. Some remain so dreamlike they seem almost to have happened to someone else instead, a tale heard from Raynn, or Kemie, rather than anything I took part in.…<br>
     The other day Influenced spoke of his first taste of Cazic-Thule and the thing called &quot;power-leveling,&quot; and I thought I recalled a similar experience Kemie had in a place called &quot;Sol A,&quot; or Solusek's Eye. But speaking with the druid involved in that tale just last night, I learned that it was not Kemie but I myself who went with Kylian one day to Lavastorm. He did not tell me then where we were going, but taking my hand had opened a mystic portal for us both. I stepped out into a grim and unfamiliar land, the ground jagged and barren of life, the air filled with sparks and cinders and seeming indeed to be someplace spawned in hell. I followed him blindly over and around jagged crevices and upthrust tortured ridges to find myself on the lip of a gigantic pit filled with molten red lava. Kylian dropped out of sight and I nearly panicked before he returned to coax me over the edge and down along the side to a small ledge. A tunnel lay before us, lit by a ghastly glow from both inside and out. Urging caution, he eased ahead of me past a body of some fallen warrior that nearly blocked the way.<br>
     Kylian I think had 51 or 52 seasons of experience then, and although I felt complete confidence in his awesome powers to protect me, I sensed the danger there to be very great. When he told me to move, I moved; if he said, &quot;wait,&quot; I stopped and held breathlessly still in complete obedience. Some lofty acquaintance hailed him as we rounded the last corner of the tunnel and could see the bright red glow ahead. Kylian held up his hand in abeyance and I froze, waiting. His friend was immensely curious about me, but I could hear the sneer in his voice at my lowly season and my sex, and he was cruelly blunt when he informed the druid that a high-level enchantress they both knew was somewhere within and would undoubtedly not approve! I blushed in shame even though I knew the implied relationship between Kylian and I to be false, but held my tongue. Kylian merely laughed.<br>
     He left me to scout ahead, then returning for me, led me out of the tunnel into an enormous cavern. The red glow came from a stream of lava winding below and shooting up little geysers and sparks as it flowed. We inched along a trail to the right before scrambling over the jumbled upthrust angles of rock and down a slim slanting stairway of slabs to a circular bay called &quot;The Pit&quot; in front of a massive door. There we stopped. After studying my armour for a moment or two rather thoughtfully, Kylian sat and composed himself to that inner state of communion with Tunare that allowed him to draw mana, then stood and lifted his arms and began to cast. Shield after shield he threw on me as added protection, strengthening me beyond my ability to even comprehend. After taking a few moments to recover, he departed through the door with the word that I should wait while he found something to &quot;pull&quot; for me. In a very brief time he returned followed closely by a flame goblin that was already almost half dead, and indicated I should attack it while he backed off and watched.<br>
     Even damaged as it was, the goblin was a fearsome opponent and at least my equal. I waded in with weapons flying, but managed to land only awkward blows that hardly seemed to affect it. I tried gathering my own mana and flinging off a couple of my own meager spells, but they had no affect whatsoever, and Kylian told me almost impatiently to stick to weapons skills alone and trust him to take care of the rest. At last the beast lay dead at my feet and I stood panting from the exertion and dripping sweat, grateful for the heals the druid had periodically given me that saw me through the battle. He was not entirely satisfied with the way things had gone, however, and after looking over the weapons I was using and those in my packs, he gave me a superior sword (I cannot now recall just what it was) to wield in my primary hand and had me arm myself with my PGT as secondary, and left to pull again.<br>
     This time the opponent was a cinder goblin, but I had barely begun to attack when a young goblin and a flame goblin joined the fray. I ignored them and thought to defeat the first opponent before turning to them, but as Kylian began to cast a heal my way, the flame goblin pounced on him with mad fury and the druid's health took an alarming plummet. With agonizing slowness I pulled away from the cinder and darted a blow at the nastier flame goblin, luckily landing a gratifyingly heavy slash on its arm and drawing its attention to me. My blades flashed again and again in the burning lava glow of the cavern as I whirled and spun and kicked in response to the three goblins, but my steps slowed and swinging became an agony as the wounds I took in return mounted and with them my life-blood began to flow away. But my near sacrifice succeeded in giving Kylian time to recover, and once again his heals blessed me, though we both had to sit for some time in the midst of the corpses, too spent to move or loot.<br>
     I think it was only then that Kylian realized I had never been the object of this kind of &quot;power-leveling&quot; before and truly did not know what it was that was expected of me or what I should do. I knew of course that for some reason casting almost always drew the attention of attacking mobs. In this fearsome place neither of us would survive if he, the stronger, was beset, and so keeping their attention on me, even though I was the weaker, became even more important. Free to cast, Kylian had more than enough power to keep me alive long enough for my weapons and my skill with them (which he thought admirable for one of my level) to do the rest.<br>
     With these things understood between us, Kylian led me through the door and on into the intersection of four passages. The new procedure worked well for the most part, but sometimes flame or fire goblins or higher casters which we met here were very difficult for me to taunt off of him. After a while the enchantress the acquaintance had warned him would be jealous of me joined us, but she lent herself to Kylian's scheme quite willingly and eased things by casting shields and buffs and freeing more of his mana for heals. The two of them sat on some steps almost casually while I fought and fought and fought, with hardly a minute here or there to catch my breath, until I was too weary to lift an arm and face another goblin. Somewhere in that night there was a turning for me, but any joy I might have felt in the advancing of my seasons was lost in a dim blur of sweat and pain and red shadows, a nightmare scene that now in memory has become little more than a dream…<br>

Fragments of memory tease my mind with no sense of exactly when some things chanced to occur. Sometime after I met your father and before tragedy overtook us, I came upon Thoran one day in Kelethin. The change in him was so drastic I was appalled. On speaking to him I learned his marriage had proven devastatingly disastrous and had ended leaving him deeply wounded and guildless. He was so disheartened by recent events that he was ready to give up, and I could not bear to see him so! Leaving Lahja to attend to other business, I sat with Thoran long and talked and listened, giving him what friendship and encouragement I could to tease the kind-hearted and heroic ranger back to life. Perhaps my words were enough, for after some hours he seemed more at ease and able to smile at least a little, showing a glimmer of his former self.<br>
     To my shame, I saw very little more of Thoran for some time, consumed as I became with Lahja and your birth and all that followed. But not long after Lahja's decline and disappearance when I was mindlessly occupied in Steamfont once again in search of clockworks and the elusive micro-servos with which I hoped to make a second Trueshot Bow, I beheld Thoran nearby with a young ranger Elia, whom he was helping. He introduced us, and when she left, Thoran sat with me a long while. This time it was I who suffered from a broken heart and was sorely in need of comfort and he gave it, his friendship sustaining me as mine had aided him before. He seemed indeed completely recovered, the Thoran I had once loved in my youth, and seemed to hold me in deep affection as he had not done before. Still we both recognized that if there was ever to be more than friendship between us it lay somewhere in the future, my heartache far too fresh and needing time to heal.<br>
     Day slipped into day, the hours seeming each to stretch into a lifetime. Superficially I am certain I appeared slowly to heal and regain my former self, with regard to Thoran and my other friends. But unbeknownst to them I spent long periods in solitude and isolation, meloncholy and brooding and very much alone. In Highpass Hold I spent so much time fishing that I nearly reached mastery, and my brewing skills advanced as well, as did the somewhat questionnable &quot;skill&quot; of alcohol tolerance. Wandering westward from there I ventured down to South Karana and spent time there combatting Tesch Mas gnolls with my old friend Armonico. And once I took ship with Alkusanat and some of his friends to try my luck in Kunark.<br>
     At the time - I think I was 21 then - everyone was saying that Lake of Ill Omen was &quot;the place&quot; to go for adventure. I hadn't taken too many boat rides (teleporting across between Faydwer and Antonica when I could through the grace of druid friends or kindly souls I'd come across by chance at the druid rings) and was a trifle apprehensive waiting on the docks in Butcherblock for the shuttle to take ship. Although one or two of Alku's friends had made the journey before, they offered very little information on what we should expect. A short time after zoning into Timorous Deep on the shuttles, we beheld the ship looming in the distance, a gigantic craft with soaring winglike sails that looked almost gossamer and ethereal. Hearts in our throats we leapt from the shuttle to the long descending boarding ramp and scrambled up to find ourselves on an enormous deck. I sat down immediately though other passengers wandered without fear throughout the ship exploring. The movement of the sails, beautiful to behold as they periodically rose and fell, proved the only delight of the journey, for I was swiftly seasick and had to call upon Alkusanat for his bard song of invigoration to overcome my loss of stamina. Finally the dock of Firiona Vie hove into view and we made ready to disembark. As we approached however, Alkusanat was suddenly swept off the deck and disappeared!<br>
     I heard him crying out as he frantically swam to shore, but his friends seemed not to notice his absence, or to properly appreciate the terror he might feel at finding himself separated from us and dropped into the water only to come out on land alone in a strange place not knowing where he was or should go. The poor bard seemed to have ill luck with ocean voyages, bad memories coloring his fear. Frantically I called out to the group and insisted they find him swiftly, and myself began to track him even though the place was no more known to me than it was to him. Reunited finally, one of the group led us through the fort to a bridge and bound us there. Alkusanat and I were both so shaken we could only find ourselves a camp for the night and try to recover, although the others apparently set off at once for the district of the lake.<br>
     We were alone when we awoke the next day, finding no sign of his friends in the vicinity. While we were debating what we should do, an old acquaintance, Maedowalen, passed nearby. I hailed him and he offered to guide us if we would follow, for he was on a corpse run to the Swamp of No Hope. Having no better plan we joined him. To our surprise he headed straight for the water, rather than the bridge, and dove in to swim across. Alkusanat kept up with him but I dropped far behind and was swiftly lost. At last I waded up onto the shore to find them arguing about which way to go, and Maedowalen headed off alone to the north while we attempted to find the stream or river draining from the lake, believing it to be the surest guide to us. Hideous monsters, with spiderlike bodies and human-seeming heads, barred our way, far more powerful than our skill to combat. <br>
     Alkusanat and I were some distance apart. He urged me to go ahead in the direction we thought we should go while he kept an eye on the nearest monster, and casting camouflage upon myself I crept along the shore and swam the mouth of the inlet to the northern side. A few minutes later he arrived himself, and it was only then I learned from him that my camouflage was in fact no use against these beasts and would not hide me from them! Luckily he had a song he could weave to cover both of us along with SoW, and fearfully we set off up along the waterway to the northwest. We were nearly to the zone when for some reason our invisibility failed us and one of the spider things attacked. Alku shouted for me to run but he seemed hard beset and instead I waded in weapons flying in an attempt to buy him time before disengaging the enemy and following. Alas, the delay proved more costly to me than to him and the next thing I knew I awoke naked on the bridge back in Firiona Vie fort.<br>
     Cautiously he made his way back to my corpse and at great risk to himself, dragged it all the way across the zone to the bridge so I could loot it safely. We returned into the city to try to figure out what to do, but exhausted by our ill-fated venture, soon camped. I woke late the following day. Alkusanat had put some of his hours alone meanwhile in exploring, and discovered tunnels that lay underneath the fort, one leading to the shore near where Maedowalen had led us the day before.  Inspired by this, I dug through my backpack and unearthed a crumpled somewhat dirty map that I had forgotten I even had, and studied it carefully. It looked as though by using this tunnel and hugging the rocky boundary on the west, we might find a safer and shorter path to the lake, with the added advantage of a pass to Frontier Mountains to duck into halfway along should we need refuge. Feeling we had nothing to lose but our lives once more, we soon set out. Again we saw spider creatures, some normal appearing and some with human heads, but this time we managed to reach Lake of Ill Omen without incident. <br>
     The scenery was alien, but the first creatures we met there bore at least a superficial resemblance to the lions of Antonica. These were sabertooth tigers, and together Alkusanat and I slew several before gaining enough confidence in our teamwork to search for greater foes. Ice bone skeletons, we found, hit harder than their old world counterparts, but again we managed to emerge victorious. The strangest and most dangerous of the enemies we saw that day were Sarnaks, cousins perhaps of the goblins but dark-skinned and thinner, with spiky protrusions at the joints and of truly evil nature. We stuck to the southeast shore of the lake and ventured only once south to the windmills to sell before returning gratefully to Firiona Vie fort the way we had come, knowing of no safer place to camp.<br>
     We could not make up our minds to make the fearsome journey again and things disintegrated from there. I stayed at the fort for weeks with too little to do and grew ever more lonely for familiar lands and faces. There was a fletching shop there so I could while away some of the long blank hours improving my skill but soon grew bored, and I tried fishing but found no relaxation in that pastime, for the fish I caught were strange and the setting still too alien. One day I heard a shout ring out from someone offering a teleport to West Commons and with no regrets left Kunark and Alkusanat both behind me.<br>

Back in Antonica, I didn't know quite what to do with myself. The gnolls and orcs in Highpass Hold were no longer much of a challenge to me, so it made little sense to go there unless I wanted some time fishing or brewing. Most of my old friends had risen swiftly in the world and far surpassed me, and were now off fighting monsters in parts of the world totally unknown to me. I wasted a lot of time with the dreary routine of collecting materials for another attempt at theTrueshot Bow, or sitting in Freeport brewing. Once in a while Armonico invited me to join him in South Karana near Splitpaw to hunt gnolls, but he was often away on other business so these interludes were too few and far between to fill the gaps. I saw very little of my sisters during this period and found myself more and more isolated. Life was becoming so meaningless to me that there were times I would sit and stare into the water from the shore of the Ocean of Tears and feel tempted to swim out as far as I could and never come back.<br>
     One day, I chanced to meet Thoran as I was once more heading from the center of Antonica to return to Kelethin. He had just joined a new guild, Victus Fortis, and seemed extraordinarily happy. This assorted group of Norrathians from all walks of life were, it seemed, united in the joy all took in assisting others and facing the challenges of good versus evil in the land, dedicating themselves to the &quot;brave way of life&quot; their name indicated. Thoran spoke of them as fondly and affectionately as if they were family, and informed me that he had recommended both me and my sister Raynn to them as recruits.<br>
     I was overwhelmed. Up to this point, I had not seriously considered joining a guild, although of course Blakeley and I had over the seasons dreamed of one that would match our ideals. But Thoran's words struck a deep chord within me, and meeting by chance an officer named Ronstad one night, I spoke to this brave warrior regarding Victus to see if they were indeed such like-minded souls as would appeal to me. He greeted my approach so warmly, having already heard of me from Thoran, that again I was near overwhelmed. So when I came the next day to Freeport, and came across Raynn's friend Wegian, who also strongly urged me to join Victus Fortis, and knowing him to be a sterling and staunch individual, I accepted the invitation he gave me. I was then in my 23rd season….<br>
     Tuilere, dear, I cannot begin to tell you how belonging to Victus changed my life and made it once more meaningful. Several of the boon fighting companions of my earlier days were already members, to my joy, and as the days passed I met many more who quickly became true friends and as close as brothers or sisters to me. With renewed courage and energy I set forth once more to face the challenges of the world's evil minions and defeat them, and we have had many a merry adventure together. In turn I considered each of my friends and acquaintances and from them approached those most like unto my guildmates and urged them also to join VF, and thus brought Blakeley, Armonico and Tisharmo into the guild as well. But though I looked long and hard for her, I could not find my sister Raynn.<br>
     When we were in our teens, Raynn came upon a human child, Lorelin, in the midst of the carnage of an orc attack in the Commons. The child's parents, indeed the entire settlement, had been wiped out in the attack, leaving Lorelin the only survivor. Not knowing what else to do with her, Raynn took Lorelin into her charge and across the ocean to Kelethin, adopting her into our family and serving as both mother and sister to the young bard. This worked quite well for all concerned, but over the seasons the girl became increasingly curious about her roots and longed to learn of her natural family as well. One day she received a letter from an aunt in Qeynos and decided to undertake the long journey to visit her and perhaps learn more of her departed parents. Raynn, having no training to undertake at the time and wanting a vacation, and of course desiring to look after the child, set off with her one day from the docks near Kaladim to take ship for Freeport on the first stage, and that was the last any of us heard from either for a long, long time. As I was during this time overly preoccupied with my own affairs, it did not occur to me to worry. But now, failing to trace their movements beyond taking ship on the Ocean of Tears, I grew increasingly concerned and was compelled to send a note to Kemie in case she knew more. Alas, she was as much in the dark as I was about the whereabouts of our sisters or their welfare! They seemed to have vanished from the face of Norrath, as if they had never been….<br>
