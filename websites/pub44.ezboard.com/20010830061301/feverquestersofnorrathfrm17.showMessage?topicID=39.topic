<br>
Unrest was a nightmare. As soon as I was able to do it without causing undo friction with my new friends, I left them there to venture out again. Hearing rumors of huge, monster crocs across the sea, I dredged up the courage to take the ButcherBlock boat route to the neighboring continent of Antonica....and to Freeport.<br>
<br>
Living beings are equiped with only five senses. That isn't nearly enough to be able to take in and comprehend the magnitude of a place like Freeport. The bright colors and the myriad assortment of sounds and smells is so overwhelming...especially to one who has lived his entire life in the wild of Kelethin. My eyes soon watered from the constant fumes emitting from the nearby homes. My nose was just beginning to burn from the fumes as well as the feces in the gutters when I caught site of a group of people running towards me. Stepping aside quickly, stepping on numerous toes in the process, I was soon engulfed in the crowd. I dont' know why, but I didn't want to be stopped here, not in this place. My ears soon began to thrum with the constant buzz of activity and the yelling and the dogs barking and all that nonstop noise. I had to get out of here! I fairly paniced in my first few moments in Freeport, to my embarrassment. Finding my way to the Eastern Gate, I quickly found a quiet spot some ways from it and sat down. I remember just sitting, looking out over the sand and shrubbery, just staring........<br>
<br>
Within a few hours, though, I was back on my feet and running south. From the rumors that I'd heard, the crocs lived in a place called the Oasis of Marr. Knowing my sense heading skill was maxxed for me right now, I headed due south without hesitation. I soon noticed a noticable difference in the vegatation. Grass began to sprout in random patches...and soon, trees were visible. Before I knew it, I was in a sparse forest like area. Talk about a change of scenery!<br>
<br>
After only a few minutes of running like the wolf, I could pick up the distinct sounds of voices and I headed straight for them. What I came upon was almost as bad as Freeport was. So many people! And they were selling an assortment of things that left me breathless! Such power radiated from some of them that I felt so weak and small. Quickly, I ran through the tunnel, following in my head the route that was laid out for me in Faydwer. This part of my life always seemed to flash by me so fast. The run through the tunnel, the subsequent run through what was known and is known as North Ro desert. Such heat....<br>
<br>
Arriving in the Oasis of Marr was more than I could take. Where did so many people come from? I was overwhelmed again and soon could not take much more. Finding a place where I could camp out and rest away from the constant chatter and activity was a challenge but I nonetheless found a spot. Passing out literally from exhaustion, I drifted off into the oblivion....<br>
<br>
____<br>
Hrm.....I've heard of the Oasis. Many go there and it is rumored to indeed possess huge crocs....<br>
____<br>
<br>
<br>
Upon waking, I no sooner crawled out of my bedding when I was again hit by the multitude of voices and the clash and thump of steel. Preparing myself as best I could, I ventured out, yelling out my turns and my class in hopes that I could get into a group. Not knowing this area, it was suggested as the best course of action.<br>
<br>
Hours passed again, with no word from anyone with an open position for a druid. I became depressed soon after. But in my depression, I decided to experiment with my gifts from Tunare. One of those gifts....was fear animal. Always confused by this spell, for is it not a druids lot in life to be friends with ALL animals? Sitting down, I memorized it and my Damage over Time spell. My healing always is mem'ed. And as a last resort, I mem'ed my root spell. Throwing back my lose hair, I searched for a croc, not even sure my spell would work on them. <br>
<br>
A caimen wandered by me just then, oblivious to me! Smiling and making sure it was alone, I cast my snare on it, slowing it's movement down so I could easily run from it if need be. My spell stuck, which relieved me greatly. I then ran a ways ahead of it as it gave chase and turned to cast my DoT (damage over time). It, too, stuck. Smiling more openly, I began to cast my fear spell. About half way through, I noticed that some yelled something about a ... Cazel or something. Looking around quickly, I didn't see anything around me that moved except a flat looking rock with a tree trunk behind it. Turning back, I root the croc and just begin to sit when the next moment I'm flying, literally flying through the air! Reaching the climax of my arch of flight, a sharp pain makes it's presence known to me all along my back. The wind blowing in my face was enough to let me regain some sense of what was going on and twisting in the air, I managed to roll with my landing. No sooner had I regained my feet when the ground shuddered. I looked up just in time to see this huge HUGE face staring down at me from sooooo far up. I just stared.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cazel SMASH!&quot;<br>
<br>
I never saw his foot coming at all. I was so ... shocked at his size. As the wind was knocked out of me and my back snapped, the last thing I saw was the top of this Cazel's boot. Though barely conscious and losing that battle fast, I prayed to Tunare to let me come back.....<br>
<br>
___<br>
<br>
oh my god...... I was so shocked I dropped the journal entry. Quickly snagging it before it hit the floor, I laid back in my chair and just let it soak in...<br>
___<br>
<br>
<br>
Tunare did indeed send me back, as I would soon find out she would send me back always. Seems that my lot in life will never be finished. At any rate, I recovered my things and began to start over with the fear tactic. Always watching, now, for any giants, I soon began to excel at this ... this &quot;Kiting&quot; as it's called. I met some fellow druids as well who were kind enough to instruct me in some of the higher functions of what a druid does. I was even introduced to the nickname that druids have....dr00ds. <br>
<br>
As my memory of those times does, it blurs together into one big...glob. Smiling, I can still remember each jolt that was sent through my body as I gained one turning after another with each kill I had. When groups weren't available, I solo'ed crocs using my fear spell to good advantage. Though at times my kill was stolen because I left it unguarded, I nonetheless gained rapidly. In short order, I had turned 19. 19.....seems to be the magic turning for druids, where they get their first teleportation spells granted them. I had no idea what to expect with these.... and the other gifts that Tunare soon blessed me with.....<br>
<br>
___<br>
Munching on an apple, I put the notes down stretched. That's when I noticed that it was dark outside. Wow, talk about time flying! but this was soooo interesting! At my own 13th turning as a warrior, I would soon follow in Ordaineds footsteps to this Oasis....to test my own skills against these....crocs....Smiling to myself, I finished my apple and prepared myself for bed....tomorrow, though so far away, was coming up quick...and I would find out what Ordained did next and where he went.....<br>

Ahem... uh yes, crocs in Oasis. Kemie spent quite a time there trying to learn the art of kiting, but under excellent tutelage from one enchanter Kahrd, who it seems in a former life became a high level dr00d. This was meant to be only a first lesson, I believe, but he left her there alone to go on to other things and eventually she lost track of him. It seems he left a few things out, like uses of all those animal spells! Luckily Kemie is here with me (<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) and taking notes.... <br>
