It was written fairly quickly but this is her past.  I know she is my secondary character, and not a member of this guild, but I thought those who have adventured with her might want to read it anyway.  Here goes:<br>
<br>
<br>
Early in her young life, Rave was destined to join her parents in the ranks of the druids. She possessed a natural adeptness in the ways of nature, and was much talked about in the Kelethin druid guild.<br>
<br>
Both Rave's parents were well-known, very powerful druids. It was said by some that they were next in line for the leadership of the Kelethin druids. Rave lived up to their expectations and more, hardly batting an eye or furrowing a brow at some spells that took others months to learn.<br>
<br>
Her life was a good one. Whatever her family needed nature provided. While her parents often traveling about, there was always one staying home with her to help her with her studies and to watch over her. <br>
<br>
Upon reaching her 17th year of life, her family called a celebration of their dearest friends. As the next day Rave was to be inducted into the ranks of the Kelethin druids. Many crowded the Proudleaf household, drinks were poured, plates of batwing crunchies passed around. <br>
<br>
Late into the night the sky became crowded with ominous clouds. Rain poured but it was an unnatural rain. There were many frightened reports, and all druids were called to their guildhouse. Rave was told to stay behind, but her parents in their rush to find out what was going on, didn't notice Rave following them amidst the confusion in Kelethin. Lightning had struck an old tree, and it burst into flame. Never before had this happened, as the city always seemed to be protected by the Gods and Nature herself, never would this happen again.<br>
<br>
Peering through the window of the druid guild hall, Rave saw rangers and even some scouts all in a heated discussion. Apparently, dark clouds poured from Crushbone, and there had been reports of dark elves lurking about. Many druids were called to an abandoned house in Kelethin, which had been set as a hospital of sorts. People with strange diseases and other afflictions crowded the house and platform. The druid's magicks were hard pressed to cure the sick, many died.<br>
<br>
A band of elder druids, rangers, warriors, and scouts headed towards Crushbone. Rave's parents amongst them. She flew home, as fast as she could, and grabbed on of her father's old scimitars. Then descended to the forest below and headed towrds Clan Crushbone.  Fear eminated from the orc stronghold, and she found herself crouching in brush trying to get a veiw of what was going on.<br>
<br>
Scouts were sent ahead, but after a half hour passed and they hadn't returned the rest of the party decided to proceed with caution. Rave followed them, quietly as to not be detected. Flanking the party, Rave was given the scare of her life as she noticed an orc centurion approaching. It immediately charged and looking into its eyes a young Rave froze, unable to move. <br>
<br>
Surprise and pain crossed the orcs face, as it fell into a sickly looking puddle of water. Standing in shadows, a bloodied scout stumbled forward as a dagger stained in orc blood fell from his hands. She immediately rushed towards him and caught him as he fell. She did her best to heal this man, but after only a few moments he denied her efforts. With a weak voice, he begged her to warn the others, as a most horrid evil awaited them.  A dubious trap had been set.<br>
<br>
'Twas then the screams were heard. Screams that echoed through Faydark. Rave ascended the nearest tree and witnessed the horror. An army of orcs rushed the wood elves from Clan Crushbone. Behind them, a large group of dark elf necromancers and several of their gnome and human followers.<br>
<br>
Her parents, all wood elves in the first wave, never stood a chance. Druidic magic failed that night, as if they were deep inside the earth. Only a few scouts escaped, one headed back to Kelethin, two more made the run to Felwithe.<br>
<br>
Rave watched her parents die a horrible death. Saw their strength sapped from their bodies, horrible disease crept through them, disfiguring them as they fell to the earth.<br>
<br>
Minutes later a wood elf army converged on Crushbone. Minutes after that, a high elf army of mages, paladins, and wizards joined the fray. The battle went long into the night, the mighty dwarves joined the ranks of the army against Crushbone and their evil leaders.<br>
<br>
Was a bloody night that crept into a bloody morning. The whole time Rave sat, in that tree, a numbness had consumed her.<br>
<br>
Her parents were dead. Hundreds of elves and dwarves and died. Many travelers who rushed to the aid of Faydwer were dead. <br>
<br>
Another day had passed, Rave still sat in the tree. It wasn't until the third day that a passing adventured enchanted by the levitate spell saw her unconscious in the tree and carried her back to the druid guild for healing.<br>
<br>
Rave was left with nothing. Weeks passed as she did menial chores for the druid guild. Her induction nearly forgotten about. Until she over heard a troubling discussion.<br>
<br>
It seems that a few in the druid guild knew what was happening that fateful night. Once the black rains began to fall and their people came back diseased, they knew the reason. A message had been interrupted from an orc runner in Butcherblok that told them of the events about to transpire, only not when.<br>
<br>
&quot;We had to send them, we had to be sure,&quot; an old druid said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then why do I feel so horrible,&quot; the other replied.<br>
<br>
Rave left the druid guildhouse and hasn't returned since. Living off the land, foraging for food and water, it was almost a year later before Rave would return to Kelethin, that year being spent with the Wood Elf bandits. She was more of a servant, but at least it gave her something to do.<br>
<br>
When she found an old note written in a language that could only be Tier'Dal, tears streamed down her face. Later that night she slit the throats of the bandits that had set up camp there, and moved on.<br>
<br>
It wasn't until weeks later, when she was wandering Faydark, that she was startled by a roaming orc centurion. A ragged mess, Rave just laughed. The last year had been hell and Rave wanted the pain to stop. She fell to her knees, the orc smiled and approached. Its sickly axe raised high, its yellow disfigured fangs poking out of its morbid grin.<br>
<br>
Rave welcomed death. She opened her arms wide exposing her chest, giving the orc an impossible to miss target. Rave closed her eyes, feeling the warmth of the sun on her face. A smile of her own crept to her face, her first smile ion a year. Alas, it was over.<br>
<br>
A painful scream startled Rave from her state. Rave opened her eyes and fell back, more terror than she had ever known filled her.<br>
<br>
The centurion was dead, replaced by a dark elf. She stumbled back. Once welcoming death, the only thing she knew was that she did not want to die at the hands of a Tier'Dal. An orc was crude but effective, a dark elf would be malicious and torturous.<br>
<br>
&quot;Relax child!&quot;<br>
<br>
Rave stopped, the voice was so firm and calming.<br>
<br>
&quot;I shall not hurt ye,&quot; with that the form shimmered and one of her own stood there. &quot;'Tis the mask ye fear, not me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Puzzled, Rave fell to the ground in tears, then was visited by a long blackness.  Rave opened her eyes days later. The same man that had saved her sat over her.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am Grev,&quot; he said with a warm smile.  &quot;Glad to see you are awake, Rave.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How do you know my name?&quot; Rave asked, weakly.<br>
<br>
&quot;An elder recognized you before I did. It wasn't until I had cleaned you up I knew who you were.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rave, confused, looked around not recognizing her surroundings.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Where am I?&quot; she asked, a weak voice escaping her frail frame.<br>
<br>
&quot;Scouts of Tunare, m'lady.&quot;<br>
<br>
That voice, so familiar.  She looked into his eyes and recognized him immediately. 'Twas the bloody rogue she held on the night her parents died.<br>
<br>
&quot;Looks as though you have saved my life twice,&quot; she said.  But I am suprised you survived that night.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, thanks to you,&quot; he smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;How?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;So many questions. I'll answer this last one and then you shall rest. The herbs and roots you placed over my wound somehow held off infection and stopped the bleeding. I was found the next day and treated. I owe you my life child.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rave looked to the wall and back to the rogue, &quot;Grev...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nevermind, child,&quot; Grev responded. &quot;Sleep.&quot;<br>
<br>
As Rave drifted off Grev made his way to the exit. He turned to her once more and said, &quot;I watched you in that tree, Rave. I saw your pain, felt it too. I only wish I could have done something. When I was healed I was told that my brother, the only family I had left, had died that night taking the message to the dwarves. It was years before I realized that I did indeed have family. Here, in the ranks of the Scouts of Tunare. Sleep well, child.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rave managed a smile before she drifted off again. <br>
<br>
The next day Rave began her training and joined the Scouts of Tunare. She would never again cast a spell. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/uwarninwraithlore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Warnin Wraithlore</A> at: 1/13/01 11:48:02 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/ulittleniffo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LittleNiffo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#8B4513>(1/15/01 3:10:26 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.fbe.unsw.edu.au/staff/graham.hannah/eq/resources/niffo60x60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rave</span><hr size=1> HiHo,<br>

Very nice Ravie!!!<br>
If we flesh out all our characters to this level and then build in how they came to be part of our new guild - we will have a great depth to us compared to most in Norrath.<br>
<br>
Not sure if the druids amongst us will like the slaughter that took place <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  - but maybe their histories may inter-twine with Ravies.<br>
