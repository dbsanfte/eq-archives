<br>
I would like to be able to tell you that everything went smoothly as planned, but this was not so. The first and biggest &quot;glitch&quot; was the failure to appear of the GM who had been arranged for some three weeks in advance (and who a week or so prior to the wedding contacted Ordained to request a change in date in order to accommodate his/her schedule). The appointed hour - indeed, the auspicious Norrathian date of Christmas - slipped past as Ordained went to great lengths to secure the services of another GM, and Desilous the Faithful eventually appeared on the scene much to the relief of all. Every cloud has a silver lining, however. The long delay allowed a number of friends who had thought they would be late to arrive in time for the ceremony! Most of the guests who arrived on time worked on improving their alcohol tolerance and appear not to have minded the wait - champagne and vodka flowed freely, as did a number of other delightful beverages.<br>
<br>
At last the ceremony began. Not all of it was captured in screenshots (thanks to Raynn, sister of the bride, for those). The following excerpts survive and may be of interest to some of you:<br>
<br>
Desilous says, &quot;Do you Ordained take Galadria to be your lawfully wedded wife? Through health and disease, through full buffs and in none… for as long as you both shall live? If so, please say, 'I do.'&quot;<br>
Ordained says, &quot;I do.&quot;<br>
A tear falls down Lunitune's face.<br>
Aaluvasi cries.<br>
Desilous says, &quot;Do you Galadria take Ordained to be your husband? Through full spawns and in slow, rich - or empty handed without a copper… Through 10,000 resurrections as long as you both should live?&quot;<br>
Wegian cheers the ceremony.<br>
Desilous says, &quot;If so, please say, 'I do.'&quot;<br>
Galadria says, &quot;I do.&quot;<br>
… (name missing) reaches for a box of tissues.<br>
Bentram snickers softly.<br>
Seani *hopes* she gets the bridal veil.<br>
Desilous says, &quot;Do you both have symbols of your love?&quot;<br>
Ordained says, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br>
Desilous says, &quot;Ordained, please take your bride's hand and repeat after me as you place the token of love on her finger… 'With this ring… I thee wed.'&quot;<br>
Lunitune gulps for breath.<br>
Ordained takes Galadria's hand…<br>
Ordained says, &quot;With this ring I thee wed.&quot;<br>
Ordained slides the ring onto Galadria's finger, a perfect fit…<br>
(And of course the same for Galadria with Ordained's ring although she was not quite up to the emotes.)<br>
Desilous says, &quot;It is with this… that on the 26th day of September, 3201… I am happy to pronounce you… Husband and wife.<br>
Gladriel shouts, &quot;WOOT WTG Galadria and Ordained!&quot;<br>
Taallon cheers at Gragzob.<br>
Kegdawen says, &quot;Cheer.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now I don't know if any of you but the bride and groom noticed, but Desilous may need glasses because the day by then was in fact 26 December… but what the heck, we weren't gonna quibble. He tried also to depart without changing the surnames of the couple to Cul`Ravenni, but was called back to attend to the final detail. Quite a few gnomish fireworks were set off by the guests and groom, these toys having been made and furnished by Mattila for the occasion.<br>
<br>
Following is a list of guests who attended the ceremony, and our thanks to all for coming:<br>
<br>
Aaluvasi<br>
Gladriel<br>
Kegdawen<br>
Lunitune<br>
Mattila<br>
Nienor<br>
Raynn<br>

After the service Ordained teleported Tisharmo to West Commons to pick up the wedding cake and Galadria was inadvertantly taken along for the ride. She and Ordained had a little private time together running back from North Karana to The Arena as Ordained could not very well gate back and leave her behind… As they entered Lake Rathe they met Damace who followed them back and was henceforth tagged into Victus Fortis by the bride. Tisharmo reappeared with the cake, but alas, it still needed an oven to bake in before it could be sliced, so no one got to taste any! While the couple was gone many of the guests removed to the PvP area and began testing each other in combat. Mattila retired for a time from the company to allow Gumbrils to appear, and Seani camped and came back as Ronstad, much to our delight. The next few hours for those who stayed were filled with some rather hilarious battles - Taallon seems to have been involved in most of these for some strange reason (perhaps he had too much to drink?) and in particular could not keep himself from punching the ladies whenever he attempted to hug one of them. I think he alone died at least five times, luckily having the foresight to have bound himself in the zone just in case. Also present at The Arena that day were two acquaintances of the bride and groom - Manil, a level 54 pathfinder, and Goldmane, a level 56 (warrior class, for whom I forget the proper honorific). They and one or two others attended the festivities by accident as it were, having died elsewhere and been reborn in our midst where they waited for resurrection. Goldmane entertained us by eventually consenting to duel the bride, she in full arms and armour and he completely naked. To preserve her honour and prevent her possible death, Ordained felt compelled to join the battle before the end, but got in only a few blows before Goldmane's rez was ready and he vanished in a puff of smoke. Late in the evening Mimnok and Drumace both came by to be tagged into VF, and with the departure of the last, Galadria and Ordained Cul`Ravenni were left in occupation of the Arena, to wander off hand in hand to an unidentified honeymoon spot.<br>
<br>
We hope that all of you enjoyed our wedding as much as we did, in spite of the delay and minor glitches. Again, thank all of you who came and all who could not but who sent good wishes; thank all who brought special items to contribute to the celebration or gave them to us as gifts; thank all who contributed in any way to our joy before, during, and after the wedding. <br>

What a great wedding it was, everyone that attended had a great time, and I personally had one of the best times ever on EQ.  Ordained and Galadria are perfect for each other!<br>
<br>
I would like to say for the record that I drank way to much and the only way I knew how to flurt when I am drunk is to punch hehe.<br>
<br>
I did not win one duel but I was just taking it easy on everyone, and did not want them to feel bad <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
