A common enough story, but for some reason Kemie, Influenced and Damace didn’t seem to recall it clearly – something to do with feeling a shared responsibility for my death? I don’t know, but I am quite certain that credit for it belongs to me alone, so I thought I’d just clarify a few things for them. Everyone else is welcome to read, ignore, weep or laugh as your nature dictates.<br>
<br>
“Inc” says Damace<br>
“Add” says Influenced<br>
“Add” says Damace<br>
(Great – never a moment to sit and read a good book) I stand and begin the Enchanter’s mantra…<br>
TARGET Lizardman Defender – Enthralled, it falls asleep on its legs<br>
TARGET Damace – give alacrity to his blows<br>
ASSIST Damace – slow his attacker’s….<br>
A Lizardman Defender hits YOU for 38 points of damage<br>
(Uh oh – Where did he come from?)<br>
TARGET Defender – It resists being enthralled<br>
A Lizardman Defender hits YOU for 26 points of damage<br>
A Lizardman Defender hits YOU for 34 points of damage<br>
TARGET Defender – Stun it with colours<br>
A Lizardman Warrior hits YOU for 20 points of damage<br>
(And when did his friend arrive?)<br>
TARGET Defender – Enthralled, it falls asleep on its legs<br>
TARGET Warrior – Stun it with colours<br>
Your target resisted your spell…<br>
TARGET Warrior – Enthralled, it falls asleep on its legs<br>
TARGET Influenced – give alacrity to Infl…<br>
Your enthrall spell has worn off….<br>
(Oh hell, now I’m in for it)<br>
A Lizardman Defender hits YOU for 36 points of damage<br>
A Lizardman Warrior attacks Kemie….<br>
A Lizardman Defender hits YOU for 12 points of damage (phht, a cissy blow)<br>
(Another decides to join in the fun. I ignore the two trying to get my attention, my attention is busy with the group healer right now – they’ll just have to call back later…)<br>
TARGET Warrior – A quick burst of Tashan to get its attention away from the healer<br>
A Lizardman Warrior hits YOU for 22 points of damage (Yep, that’s got his attention alright)<br>
A Lizardman Warrior hits YOU for 20 points of damage<br>
A Lizardman Defender hits YOU for 32 points of damage<br>
<br>
OK, time out to help get this picture into focus for you. As best I can recall…<br>
<br>
Influenced is dealing with two,<br>
Damace is dealing with two,<br>
Kemie proves irresistible and attracts another, whilst trying to heal not only two tanks but also her chanter<br>
Me? I’m the greedy type – I got four of ‘em, all awake and frisky<br>
Influenced decides he’s not busy enough and tries to heal me too<br>
Damace is down to under 2 bubs of health and ignoring it<br>
Both guys are trying to taunt my new admirers away from me<br>
Someone somewhere says OOM (It may have even been me)<br>
At this point I finally realise that, despite the best efforts of my group, I have almost as many mobs on me as HP <br>
<br>
WARNING: do not ever assume Gladriel will do the smart thing and zone So next time dear friends, here are some useful hotkeys to prepare:<br>
Gladriel get the hell out of here, you’re bleeding all over the floor<br>
Gladriel bugger off and take your new friends with you <br>
Gladriel ZONE or there’s no chocolate later (guaranteed to make me fly out of there)<br>

It was scary enough TP'ing with Taallon and Drumace and Ordained earlier for Kemie's first time to dank and gloomy Feerrott and swimming to the mouth of Cazic-Thule... It was more spooky still after meeting you there being trained on in the entrance to the temple while we gathered our wits about us... Not to mention my feelings as we and the ogre who joined us were led through confusing twisting turning tunnels deep inside, Kemie bringing up the rear and suddenly although invisible drawing attack. Was there really a time afterwards to gain full mana? Our flirtation with death around the pyramid was made of light consequence by Ordained's continual assistance with his heals for those few hours until Taallon was compelled to go....<br>
<br>
Gating back to the entrance to meet Sindarren and regroup... Ordained and Drumace camping to go get Influenced and Damace, with Sind leaving to assist in transport... you and I waiting all alone in the entrance and getting trained again a time or two... hearing that Damace went LD while swimming across Lake Rathe from the Arena and returning to find himself on the bottom of the lake with a bare gulp or two of air!... At last all assembled again but this time because the levels were somewhat lower among us pulling first in the entrance and then venturing only as far as the courtyard....<br>
<br>
We made a decent enough team there, even though experience for Sindarren proved too light and he left. Even after his departure having two rangers, a druid and a chanter worked pretty well although Kemie was almost always low on mana - yet still she had enough to DoT, hit with lightning, and then turn her attention to healing the guys. The first time you died, Gladriel my dear, came as a shock to me and an immense blow to my ego! I had scrolled back up to see just what it was in group chat that had flashed past my eyes moments before and missed the plummet of your health and before I knew it or had time to react, you were gone. That time in fact I had PLENTY of mana and kicked myself over and over and over again for failing to aid you in your need.<br>
<br>
When you returned suddenly there were strangers in our midst. I don't know where those other players came from or why they sat nearly on top of us or what they said to make Influenced put one of them on ignore or where they went when some of them vanished into thin air, but the courtyard became a madhouse shortly afterwards and I still think one of them must have trained us even if examining the battle account later revealed no names other than our own and the one other player who seems to have stuck to his one lizard protector.<br>
<br>
Damace came back with two lizards, a sentinel and a defender... I tried to determine which he was on and DoT it giving you time to tash and/or mez the other. Then suddenly there were two defenders not one, and the second was on you and you were calling for root and I cast and then there were more and more and more as if each separate lizard had spawned a twin or triplet and everyone's health was plummeting drastically! I threw you a heal... and another... and one to Damace and one to Influenced and back to you and was attacked myself but kept on casting or attempting to on you, my dear, for I could see your health continuing to drop. And in spite of all that I could do it was not enough and you died again and and the lizards seemed to laugh at us almost and never die and the three of us remaining alive were down to under two bubs of health and still falling and all that we could do was zone ourselves... I wanted to cry, my dear. That time I did everything right and still it was not enough to save you, but it certainly was not YOUR fault that you died, as we were beset by too many of those gleaming lizard men whatever the true reason for their multiplication. It was a NIGHTMARE.<br>
<br>
Kemie<br>
