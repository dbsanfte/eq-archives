<br>
But you know how it is - You have a gnoll commander and a couple of elite guards and 20 mins later you want another one.<br>
<br>
2 paladins and a ranger - bored, armed and looking for trouble. Its one thing to throw your kids into the street when they are in this kind of mood but quite another to attempt to calm the bloodied lips of those in Victus Fortis.<br>
<br>
So - a wandering we went. And what a wandering it was.<br>
<br>
First stop - Western Karana's for some hot bandit action. I remember trembling in my boots and tip-toeing round these fellas last time I was here - this time was different.<br>
<br>
After the twelfth bandit, a brigand and still no experience we sat down again. This was beyond a joke - wasnt there any terror to be had.<br>
<br>
Then an Idea - High Hold pass - theres always trouble there. So off we went. <br>
<br>
North Karana's was fun - playing dodge the griffin and whack a grizzly. Obviously it was Semdayen the ranger with his affinity to nature that seemed to attract the wildlife. A quick bind at the gypsy camp ensured we could catch our breath and offload our Greater Lightstones (kerching thank you very much).<br>
<br>
East Karanas was a little more troublesome - like hacking through treacle. Every step brought something to play with - Wolves, Gnoll Reavers, Lions (Cheers Sem...) and tricky little Gorge Hounds. We played the lottery game with the mad NPC by the bridge but had to agree after 2 or 3 pp that he gave out complete junk. A quick med in a village and then the long climb up Highhold Pass.<br>
<br>
Highhold was like 'camp central'. The orcs were camped. The gnolls were camped. The goblins were camped. Everything was camped. We stood still for 3 mins and a party turned up and starting camping us. It was crazy busy. This was obviously no good for us. We agreed that the next stop would be the Oasis of Marr - a long walk but worth it.<br>
<br>
In Highhold we met Taluvaan, a great little bard we had crunched Kobolds with in the Warrens. He joined us the run to Oasis. This was the first time I had been in a group with a bard in it - I was impressed.  We ran through Kithicor like the wind with Tal pressing out the tunes on his pipe.<br>
<br>
In no time at all we were in the tunnel of RO where I took the opportunity to offload the hammer I had picked up in the warrens (Ye Auld Ball Peen Hammer) in exchange for my first piece of plate mail (only a bracer but hey ho!).<br>
<br>
The run to the Oasis was quick and uneventful and soon we were at the docks looking for the balance of the party for orc hunting. We were joined by Bombaye the enchanter and Rillbim the Bard. I thought we were a kicking party and it was only afterwards I realised that Taluvaan had left the group - we were all too high level for him now. I felt bad - I hadn't thought it through when putting the group together. Next time I will be more careful.<br>
<br>
I ushered the group together and off we went - nowhere. It was only seconds before I had got everybody lost in the desert and into a bunch of scraps with Dry Bone skeletons. <br>
<br>
'Does anyone know where I'm going' I cried and we all returned to the docks to wait for Sem to lead us to the Orc's highway. <br>
<br>
The Orc's highway was like a day at the beach - four or five parties camped out on the sand by the water waiting for Orcs. Damn - are we never going to kill tonight, I thought.<br>
<br>
Bombaye piped up - he knew a place that we could hunt in. A quick jaunt and there we were. <br>
<br>
We came over the top of the dune to see an Orc temple down below - 6 or 7 black, yellow and red Orc warriors and Priests were lounging around and looking mean. <br>
<br>
Bombaye laid out the plan - If we could clear out the temple once we could stay all night and whack things in a controlled fashion - it was just the initial part that was painful.<br>
<br>
We braced ourselves for the onslaught and put our iron pants on. Araegorne and I took point. Bom flexed his killing finger, Sem sharpened his axe and Ril played a mighty tune to keep us healed and strong.<br>
<br>
Araegorne pulled - a small swarm of orcs charged up the hill - It was chaos.<br>
<br>
We were surrounded on all sides. Hacking and swiping. Big green ugly lumps pounding us. Araegorne took the worst beating - three or four were on him. I was fighting a priest when I realised he was going to die. I ran back to Lay on Hands but was too late. Sem and Rill went next. There were only two Orcs left at this point - I took one. The other was fleeing down the hill back towards the temple. I was nearly dead but the bloodlust was upon me and I charged down the hill at it. Bombaye screamed at me to return but I was young and stupid.<br>
<br>
I set upon it. Hack, hack and hack. It was nearly dead. I felt glorious and watched in horror as a priest and a warrior appeared in front of me. I should have run but I just couldnt bear the idea of this orc getting away so I continued...<br>
<br>
I woke up in Freeport with a sore head and a lighter experience bar. I could hear the other party members shouting out where they were in their journey back to Oasis. We had been routed. <br>
<br>
Bom was shouting to get everyone back quick. The temple was now empty and we needed to keep it that way. <br>
<br>
I was granted the spirit of wolf by a kindly elf who could tell I was currently 'Sans Corpse' and I started back. <br>
<br>
When I returned it was quiet. We had control of the temple. The orcs were appearing one or two at a time. It was a constant battle to keep the temple empty but a very controlled pace. Life was good and my axe became very bloodied.<br>
<br>
I took pull position and I must have clocked miles on the short run between our position and the temple that night - no sooner had I brought one up than I was on my way down again to grab another. Our plate was full.<br>
<br>
Occasionally we'd have the pleasure of a madman or a mummy but mainly we did Orc after Orc after Orc. What could go wrong?<br>
<br>
There were five of us - we were working in complete harmony.<br>
<br>
I would pull.<br>
Araegorne would tank.<br>
Sem and Ril would pile in and wreck havoc.<br>
Bom would nuke or if more than one came he would mez.<br>
Afterwards Ril would heal everyone<br>
I would return to the temple to pick up another. <br>
<br>
It was clorkwork.<br>
<br>
But something did go wrong...very wrong.<br>
<br>
I am not sure how it started - we were in rhythm. One or two orcs on the go. <br>
<br>
I knew it had gone wrong when Bom started shouting ZONE - he was a steadfast man and not given to fleeing unnecessarily. Ril went down. Again I couldnt reach in time to Lay on hands. Bom Zoned. Arae Zoned. I couldn't see what the fuss was about.<br>
<br>
Suddenly I saw it - we were overwhelmed - six of seven of them had come from nowhere (and a mummy for values sake!). My heart quailed. I shouted to Sem to Zone. He was fighting. For a moment I thought we might take them - fool!<br>
<br>
I was cut to ribbons by two warriors and a priest. I remembered the long walk from Freeport. I turned and fled. <br>
I kept an eye out for Sem - he was fleeing too thank Nife. <br>
<br>
I zoned just in time. I had started to stumble and cursed my weakness - I had been forced to Lay Hands on myself to escape. I crossed the line to find Bom and Arae catching their breath. We had only just escaped death. Sem appeared cut as badly as the rest of us. <br>
<br>
We could hear ril in the background shouting she was on her way. I sat down.<br>
<br>
After a short time my curiousity got the better of me and I zoned back in...maybe it was clear now...<br>
<br>
Oh my god! I was immediately confronted by a Sand Giant. A big 'you look like dinner' type smiled appeared on his face. A minor cardiac and a step backwards ensured I zoned out again immediately. <br>
<br>
I took the appearance of the giant as a Sign - rest up while I was ahead. <br>
<br>
I told the group I was heading back to town - Sem and Arae said they would also. Bom and Ril were disappointed - obviously the night was young for them. <br>
<br>
We said our goodbyes and headed back up Ro to the tunnel. <br>
<br>
Our journey back was high-spirited. We joked on my near impending surname choice - derisory names involving logs, flogging, choppers and the such kept us laughing all the way. <br>
<br>
We arrived in Freeport and cashed in our spoils - 5pp for a whole nights work was not good earnings but I have to say it was one of the most enjoyable evenings I had spent in a long while - and anyway I had made a trade on the hammer so was happy.<br>
<br>
We went to the bank. Paid in and chatted a while outside. Sem was giving away armour to newbies who poked him.<br>
<br>
I poked him but he wouldn't pay up...claiming something about 17 summers not classing as newbie material.<br>
<br>
In return I tried to give away Semdayen to a newbie but no-one expressed any interest.<br>
<br>
I huge yawn cracked across my face. I was tired. We had walked a long way from Blackburrow that evening. We had killed mighty amounts. I had gathered some good experience. <br>
<br>
but most of all we had done three things:<br>
<br>
1. Faced death and triumphed.<br>
2. Grouped with excellent friends.<br>
3. Showed the world what Victus Fortis means.<br>
<br>
Arae was a rock. Sem never flinched. I tried my best.<br>
<br>
Tonight is another night. Maybe we will venture there again. <br>
<br>
If you see Taluvaan, Bombaye or Rillbim then pass our respect and regards - they are fine people to work and play with.<br>
<br>
