Ordained went to try to help him, but unfortunately ran into a blue undead of some sort who aggroed and harm-touched him for half his life before he even knew what hit him, and he died as well... The whole thing turned into one of those hours long nightmares, I understand, and finally Ordained camped to come back with another character he thought might have a better chance at success. He had barely arrived at the Qeynos docks when I got a tell from one Cadip, a level 15 human cleric of the guild Ordo Ursi Prismatus. <br>
<br>
Evidently Cadip had felt so badly earlier at being too low to help Ordained that he spoke to one of his guildmates who has seriously considered leaving EQ for good - a level 49 cleric named Rugen Payne. Rugen, in spite of his disenchantment with the game, went to great lengths to locate Galladen's corpse and painstakingly drag it along the tunnels and to safety. By the time he had accomplished this, Galladen had logged off for the night, which is rather too bad, but Cadip and Rugen took the time and the concern to contact me and let me know where the corpse was left so that Gall might later retrieve it!<br>
<br>
Rugen told me he had died twice at the same spot Ordained died, whether that night or earlier he did not specify. After rescuing Galladen's corpse, Rugen responded to still another plea for help to retrieve a corpse in the Aqueduct and re-entered, dying yet a third time. Alas, seems that is one nasty hole to attempt!<br>
<br>
I cannot praise Rugen enough for the sacrifice he made for a Victus Fortis member, or he and Cadip enough for their courtesy in conveying the information to another Victus Fortis member (myself) in the absence of the player concerned, once the rescue had been completed. This goes WAY beyond kindness.<br>

We've all been in situations that seem beyond our abilities to put right, but just as we can't depend on a kind stranger to walk by, we should not presume on the assistance of our few higher level members to help us out when the water gets too hot or too deep.<br>
<br>
Kind gentlemen indeed - I wonder if there's something about the cleric class that attracts these exceptional people? Oh, and druids too of course...rangers too...and as for the monks - wow...palladins? what can I say....incredible.<br>

I understand from chatting last night to one of our guildmates that Galladen was advised not to go in there in the first place! I admit I was in the middle of other things (like fighting) when any earlier conversation was going on and evidently missed that part, as did Ordained.<br>
<br>
My friends, ALWAYS listen to your guildmates' advice! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    A level six character has plenty of &quot;newbie&quot; areas to fight in without having to venture into tougher zones... unless you have a higher level player along with you who is helping to power level you or something!<br>
<br>
Because yes, we can't always count on the kindness of strangers nor should we expect our own higher level players to come and sacrifice their levels just to help you out of a bind you shouldn't have gotten into in the first place. Most of us don't mind helping others - in fact, that's one of the nice things about many of the members of VF - they like helping out. But speaking from my own experiences, I know that I find myself less and less willing to help out a particular individual who makes repeated errors in judgement first, and then just takes the help for granted instead of appreciating what is sometimes a great sacrifice (and not much fun) on my part... <br>
<br>
Think before you leap into the frying pan - accidents happen and I never mind helping in that case, particularly if it is within my capabilities as a player or those of my character, and in fact it often gives me great pleasure. I'm sure others feel the same way. But with players who help me - and in fact with GM's as well (and I think in general they probably respond EXACTLY the same way as I do to helping people) - I always bend over backwards to show my gratitude and appreciation...<br>
