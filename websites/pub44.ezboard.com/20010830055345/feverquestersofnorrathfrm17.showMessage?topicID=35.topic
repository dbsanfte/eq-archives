<br>
A twig snaps off to my right. Crouching down, I do a quick check of my weapons. My bow is secured to my back, a quiver full of arrows beside it. My Kodiak claws gripped firmly in my right hand and my langseax held loosely in my left. Rotating my shoulders a bit to ease any tension, I glance to make sure my boots are laced up ... *remembers his trainers voice* (Always make sure your boots are laced...cause if they aren't, they will trip you up all the time) .... <br>
<br>
Another twig snaps, this time followed by a low growl of annoyance. It was close. I could almost smell it. Hunching down a bit further behind the tree in which I hid, I scanned the surrounding area that I could see.<br>
<br>
From out of the far right of my vision, movement caught my eye. Slowly turning my head, so as not to draw attention with any sudden movement, I looked to see an Orc slowly walk out into the open. Glancing around, it soon motioned behind itself to those following. I knew there would be more, but the 5 other orcs that soon followed surprised me. Shrugging slightly in resignation, I readied myself.<br>
<br>
Passing within only a few feet of where I lay low, the orcs soon filed past me without a glance to show they had seen me. I'm wearing almost all bronze plate...how COULD they miss me? I was told orcs aren't the brightest but...<br>
<br>
Without a sound, I stood up, my claws already arcing towards the rearmost orc. All three blades easily cut through it's leather jerkin and left in it's wake three bloody grooves. My langseax was quick to follow, taking the beasts head clean off. My momentum building, I lunged forward, to hit the next orc in the back with my shoulder, launching the little guy a good two feet over the orc in front of him. Knowing that they would soon be upon me, I took up a defensive stance, my claws and blade weaving in and out of one battle style and into another. The orc in front of me started to laugh at it's companion. Raising an eyebrow, I watched as it kicked it's fellow aside and continued on. I was...shocked to say the least! What was this?!? Slowly, I stood up, my face blank. This wasn't right. I walked up to the orc that I had hit and saw that it was out cold. I looked up the trail again to see the other four orcs just rounding a large oak tree. Shaking my head at this strange behavior, I sprinted after them, yelling at the top of my lungs..<br>
<br>
&quot;Your mothers are unwashed...unwashed...um...unwashed...ORCS&quot; I yelled....(ya, so .. I can't find a good insult for an orc...I mean..)<br>
<br>
Reacting almost in unison, all four orcs slowly turn to face me. YES! This is much more like it! My blood practically sang the Hymms of Tunare to me as I reached the first one. All of them carried staffs or cudgels and my claws swept one aside while my blade drank of their blood. My speed being so much greater then theirs, I was soon through the four, leaving one dead and another disarmed. Turning, I braced myself for the charge that did, indeed, come. <br>
<br>
A staff poked at my face, which I ducked under. A club swung at my face again from below, which my blade deflected. A pain shot through my right arm as the third one's club hit my shoulder plate. Shrugging off the pain and growling in defience, I tucked in my right arm, claws facing out and thrust upward. Biting into and bursting through its chest, I impaled the staff wielding orc and lifted it off the ground. Again, a jolt of pain lanced through my back as the same club wielder hit me again. Shaking the orc off my claws, I raised my langseax to deflect the other club wielding orcs attack and, without looking, took a swipe at the one behind me. I didn't expect to hit him, so that when my claws sliced through its neck and down across it's chest, I lost my grip on it and it became imbedded in it's flesh.<br>
<br>
Thinking me at a disadvantage with a left hand weapon, the remaining orc charged me, howling like the animal it was. Looking up at it, I smiled, flipped my blade to my right hand and leaped forward, diving under it's wild swing. Upon regaining my feet, I turned, blade leading to run the orc through the back. Coming up behind it, I turned it's head so that it could see me and whispered .. <br>
&quot;Tunare has judged you and found you disgusting. It is by her will that I have rid this world of you&quot;<br>
<br>
Thrusting the orc away from me, for the stench was overwhelming, I quickly regain my claws, wrenching them from the body and clean both blades on the grass. Looking around, I sprinted back towards my place of concealment, to await the next band of orcs....<br>

Your tale reminds me of my time hunting CrushBone Orcs, in the days before I found Victus Fortis. The camped hills surrounding CrushBone castle are rife with Orcish stink, but they do provide with ample hunting opportunity, and their belts fetch a handsome bounty in my home city of Kaladim. When you feel it is time to raid CrushBone castle itself, do call upon me. Legionaires have learned the hard way to fear me.. few things can be as reassuring as Dwarven-weilded steel. Also, I made a freind upon a time, a young Woodelf lass named Kaltesse. A worshipper of Tunare she is, and skilled in the ways of Nature-Magic. She is close to your age, perhaps I should arrange a meeting, aye?~</i><br>
