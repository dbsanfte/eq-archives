To promote a group of people who want to have fun in the game and allow them to do so in whichever manner affords them that comfort (in an honourable way, no matter how much fun someone may think KSing is this is not the guild for that).  I think the key to that is giving everyone choice.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;Vision&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
First, I must say I am all for having a &quot;Vision&quot; as it has been called.  However, I feel that it should not be the defining factor of the guild.  I think that it should be something our members have a choice to follow.  Like a sect within the guild that has a bit of mystery.  That way those who inquire about it can learn about it through quests designed by those who are the &quot;Keepers of the Vision&quot; or whatever we shall name that sect.  There are several reasons I see why having it as a sect would benifit us the most:<br>
<br>
<br>
- There are many like minded people in the game who really like to roleplay, but just not as indepthly or in that manner.<br>
<br>
-I have been in a guild (two now that I think of it) that was defined by its &quot;Vision&quot; and it could come off the wrong way to others outside the guild and seem cult like.  <br>
<br>
-It can be the source for a lot of conflict.  If people disagree to the path that the Vision should evolve on, there can be heated arguements.  That UO guild I was in disbanded after 2 years because of this, there were even a few RL friednships lost over it (though I am confident that won't happen here, they were extreme UO fanatics).  the other never got off the ground.<br>
<br>
-There is something to be said for mystery.  It adds excitement to those who wish to follow the Vision that is come up with.  If they hear a bit about it, it may inspire them to seek out further truths.  Doing so by gaining small bits of information via quests and chance encounters would be exciting, like doing an intricate and beautiful puzzle<br>
<br>
-Honestly, it can put people off of the guild just as easily as it can attract people to it.  Especially since it will be &quot;fiction&quot; within the EQ world created by us.  Even those who love the idea behind it, might not agree with the Vision itself.<br>
<br>
-I know it is cool to sacrifice something for a cause.  But for a lot of people there are armours or weapons that define their class.  Say one of the components of a quest (like was mentioned on list) was for a paladin holy sword, or class only armour.  For me, that Holy Sword is a gift from Brell himself, it is an instrument to destroy the evils upon the land, and exact the revenge of the Gods upon the heretic.  Or that piece of armour may give me the edge in battle to keep another person alive, or pull the group through the battle.  I believe the intent behind the original thought was to give up a status symbol for the betterment of the Vision and guild.  These items are much more than status symbols to some players, they are sacred and an intrigal part of their being.  To force someone to give up that &quot;dragon scale&quot; or the like is a little much and can be the same to some people as asking a paladin not to heal that ogre as the guild dictates it is wrong, even though that ogre just saved your life 3 times in a group and helped you with a quest you had trouble with for 3 weeks.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Please</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> understand that I am not saying this is a bad idea.  And even though I want it to be a sect, I don't want it to be &quot;sepereate&quot; from the rest of the guild.  I had many good months in that UO guild before it imploded, and know that it can be a source of extreme fun.  In this situation though, I don't like the idea of a all out, full bore &quot;roleplay&quot; guild that is defined by a &quot;faith.&quot;  I like the idea of having a small code of conduct that is only said for those coming to the guild.  A code of Conduct that is just who we are, rather than what we do.  <br>
<br>
So, while I would be more than glad to do adventures and help with quests regarding the Vision that is given birth to in the more than capable minds of htose who wish to create it, I don't foresee myself being on the acutal council.  I have been through guilds that do this, and while it is fun and I would participate, I really do enjoy adventuring witht he fine people of this guild and in the game.  Roleplaying to some level is a very good thing, I enjoy it, but I don't see myself getting too terribly indepth.  Another reason for that is the fact that there may be times when I need to remain partial.  Even though we all know that I am more of a figurehead, even the Queen of England hss to make an ass of herself sometimes and say things on behalf of her country.  Just as I am sure there will be times where I may need to be &quot;the leader&quot; and remain impartial.  <br>
<br>
Again, I like the idea.  I just think it should be left up to guild membership.  They should have a choice in the matter.  If there are several who are in the guild that want to make up a council for this, please by all means plan it out and let the rest of us know what you come up with.  We can then discuss it.<br>
<br>
I just know that there are a few who I hafe talked to outside list/board that would probably help in quests and may participate, but they are o the same mind in feeling that it shouldn't be the sole basis for a guild.<br>
<br>
In essense, this is what I am saying:<br>
<br>
-Love the idea, can't wait to watch the story develop and take life, and will definately help out when I can.  <br>
<br>
-Has merit and could add to guild flavour, but shouldn't be the entire foundation for the guild.<br>
<br>
Hope I have not offended anyone or stepped on their toes.  I think there is a middle ground here that will please everyone.<br>
<br>
I need to take a break.  Been staring at the screen since I died in Kith today.<br>
<br>
Let the discussion begin!<br>

be well friends,<br>

Enter the Middle Ground :-)<br>
<br>
For the most part I agree with Warnie, I dont think any guild character should detract from our EQing in the slightest. It should take NOTHING away, be it items, money, XP or fun.<br>
<br>
What should it do then?<br>
Well I would hope that even if it was as simple as us drinking over our fallen comrades - our character should hold us together. We should all try to be honourable and overflowing with valour yet that wouldnt set us apart from the rest of the EQers out there.<br>
<br>
We can have sub-plots and invent bad guys for us to foil (which could be fun) But our guild may be better defined by those simple things we do each day that differ from others.<br>
It is hard to think of things that dont make it harder to actually play the game - if we all spoke in rhyme it would certainly define our guild but would be WAY too hard and we would all stop doing it.<br>
<br>
Sooo what is my summary?<br>
I quite like the idea of creating some history and running plotlines for us to adventure around - but the character part I think is best kept to something simple which doesnt effect peoples individual characters and can be done without onerous RPing.<br>
<br>
Suggestions off the top of my head again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  :<br>
1. Our afore mentioned deathbed ceremony to honour the fallen.<br>
2. At sunrise we say a few words to welcome the light.<br>
3. hmm mran out of time to think of something...<br>
<br>
more later,<br>
hope that helps,<br>

<br>
I had a thought for another way to look at this.<br>
Think of a gang or a club, they do have things in common and try to all act in a unified way but they often also have a set of 'rituals' and the like that help their members 'feel' like they are part of something special.<br>
For example the special handshakes, code words, unique colours etc.<br>
<br>
Not sure if this helps - but I am trying to think of something more than just our alcohol <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>

Yet I rarely see guilds that are heavy into questing.  Sure, they may gather a group to go questing, or 3 groups to camp a spawn, or 7 groups to do a raid.  Even with Sacred Valor I was only ever given 3 quests.  One was way to hard for my level (the guy musta forgot waht it was like to be new and level 12) another was to carry one thing from one zone to another, the last thing was to gather items and he would buy, but I have yet to meet him in game.  I have seen them give out more quests and stuff, but usually they are high level quests.<br>
<br>
Well, I think something that would go a long way to defining us as a guild would be to have a database of quests on our webpage.  Now since most of these are made up from our heads, they would mostly have to be &quot;kill this creature&quot; or &quot;get this item&quot; but that is ok.  It should be fun.  We could also create our own NPC things.  With all those social buttons it wouldn't be hard to make a uniformed speach.  The guildmembers would know it was someone else, but still it may give them something to do.  Especially if you have a level 5 newbie come into the guild nd the rest of us are in the teens or higher.  Giving that person some quest will tell them that this guild is a bit different.  It will keep their moral up while they cannot group with other members, and push them in the directionof learning a bit about the game especially if research is needed to find out where to go and what to do, and what they will find when they get there.  It will give them something to do.  I am not saying have a schwackload of items collected or bought for quests, and not even listing the quest.  The quests would have to be tailored per character so we name the quest, tell them of the reward, and give them a first contact.  <br>
<br>
I think that is similar to what Jason was saying.<br>
<br>
Emotes, death riutuals, I am all for those things.  I thought about &quot;standard&quot; greetings and rituals, but that could be boring after a while.  Or people we meet could get tired of seeing every person with &lt;our name&gt; over their heads saying Hi! in the exact same fashion.  I think that we should do our best to get everyone to use those emote spaces and develop them for different situations.  Greetings, deaths, good-byes.  Those sort of things.  <br>
<br>
As for the Sect idea, Niffo how far do you and Luni and those that are interested want to go with your Prophecy/Vision ideals?  We should get an idea.  Quests can be designed by you so that they tell your story.  It could even be as subtle as &quot;We do nothing until the third moon crashes to the earth, Brell Serilis sends the golden dwarf to the world, and VI takes the gnome out of their areses&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=">D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  type vision so that it is more lore than action.  You would be like monks, at it was because of your ideals you were chosen as the Keepers of the Vision.  This takes it from being a &quot;we act this way because the vision tells us&quot; to &quot;we keep the visions because our beliefs that all lives are sacred, blah blah blah, and the gods have entrusted it to us&quot;.  In essence, it goes from a religious sounding thing to a spiritual sounding thing.<br>
<br>
Just some thoughts I wanted to throw out there.  I hope I made sense.<br>

<br>
Excellent, I can think of nothing more exciting than developing a subplot boiling away beneith the surface of the guild. Perhaps it is that which will tie us together - it would certainly be fun - and if it was secret then that would add another level of discovery to our EQing lives.<br>
<br>
One trick we will have is providing adequate reward for the guild questing - one way may be as a perminant record on the web site of who did what for us? Obviously using some Treasury funds will help as well. It will be tricky to provide a sense of achievement and progression through the subplot when we exist within the EQ framework.I have to think about this some more  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I liked much of what you said Warnie - it does sound fun. It could be that we all have some kind of progression within the prophecy as well and to get to the next 'level' you have to quest. Much like the sashes the monks get - they might not be better equipment than you already have, but you get a sense of accomplishment???<br>

I guess I thought I would just post again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  to clarify the difference between any guild Character and its Vision. Though the two could be interwined they can be developed a two separate things.<br>
<br>
==== BLOODPLANE : an example ===========<br>
Lets say our guild was called [BloodPlane] and we decide that all our members have some strange link with the Plane of Blood (which I made up).<br>
Then we could have a common destiny of protecting Norrath from the evils of the Plane of Blood. We could have a few rituals to do with the spilling of blood and a cool set of emotes to handle particularly bloody occasions <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
This would even leave people to interpret their link with the plane - some could drink blood, some could fear it, some could dance in pools of it etc.<br>
Then underneath that there would be a series of sub plots which evolve over time - perhaps we need to overthrow the Cult of Blood who are trying to build a portal to the plane. We also need to hunt down and kill Evil Denizens who are drawing on the Planes powers and get possession of artifacts fashioned on the plane...<br>
========================================<br>
<br>
So you can see that the first part defines our character while the subplots and destiny can be an expanding part of our existance which adds all the quests etc etc...<br>
<br>
