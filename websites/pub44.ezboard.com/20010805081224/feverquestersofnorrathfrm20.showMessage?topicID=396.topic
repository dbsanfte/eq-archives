<br>
When this group first began, the founders had a vision of friendship and community.  That was the founding drive of the guild.  A group of people that could rely on one another for help and assistance and companionship in the lands of Norrath.<br>
<br>
This vision was what I vowed to uphold when I took over the role of leadership so long ago from our first leader, Warnin.  Warnin was the leader of Victus Fortis in the very beginning of the guild, and left soon after it was created.  So when I took over as the next leader of this great group the founding ideals of companionship and community were still upfront and fresh in my mind.  I was a founding member, after all, and helped to create those very ideals.<br>
<br>
As time has now went on this guild has been, in my honest opinion, a huge success.  We have had our trials, as does every guild, but they have been managed with the utmost care, and with the founding visions always in mind.  <br>
<br>
The future for us looks brighter than it ever has before.  Many of our members now are breaching into the 40's and higher, and more capable than ever before to lend a helping hand to those of lower levels.  Raids are now taking off more so than ever before, and people are always willing to give up their personal pursuits when it comes to helping out their fellow brethren amongst our family.<br>
<br>
The creative side of our guild is also top-notch.  There are a few members here who continue to create excellent tales of their adventures by which we can all share in the Tales and Roleplay section.<br>
<br>
Basically, as the leader of this great group, I see many accomplishments, much more so than we have obtained to this day, around the corner for Victus Fortis.  <br>
<br>
As for membership into our guild, we will be slowing things down now to allow all the newer people the chance to really get to know those long-standing Victus members.  Of course, if an exceptional player does pop up we will not hesitate to recruit him, but I want you to know that for the present time we will focus more on becomming an even tighter-knit group of people.  I feel this to be very important, as a tight-knit community is the founding philosophy of our very guild.<br>
<br>
Everyone here is doing a FANTASTIC job, and I am very proud to be the humble leader of this group.  Keep up the great work all, you are a symbol of our pride and ideals throughout the lands of Norrath and in our online community!<br>
<br>
Take care,<br>
<br>

I think that is something we all needed to hear.  I believe that sometimes, even without major problems directly effecting us, we all can get discouraged.  Maybe we were in a bad  group,  or we died too many times soloing, or we cant seem to make a clump of dough to persue our baking skill, or we have real life problems that can keep us from the game...  whatever might happen we all struggle at times.  I'm so glad to be part of a guild where people notice and care that I may not have been around for a few weeks, and are willing to stop what they are doing to help me get back into the swing of things.  <br>
<br>
I am glad we are going to slow down the recruiting a bit. There are quite a few people I don't know much about and several I have never heard of! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'm happy I will have the opportunity to meet you all.<br>

As for you, Raloth, I think you are doing a wonderful job.  I know it isn't easy to do some of the things you have to do and I am proud to be able to call you a friend. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

It was sad. No leadership and no fellowship amounted to a poor guild.<br>
 So I left it, not knowing if guilds were the way to go.<br>
 Then I was accepted into Victus Fortis, where fellowship rules supreme! I have been a member since my 16th season I believe and have made some incredible friends in that time!<br>
 I don't know all of you but in time I hope to learn a little about everyone.<br>
 Raloth you have taken over and really done a great job of leading this guild. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I keep being impressed by the quality of our members, some of whom were tagged at my urging or by me after I became an officer, on the very slimmest of impressions and the promise of potential. To find that you have all turned out even better than I dreamed, and fit together as well as you have, is sort of a humbling experience. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
