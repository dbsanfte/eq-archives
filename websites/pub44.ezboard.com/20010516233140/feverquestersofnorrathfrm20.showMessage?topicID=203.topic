A disaster struck poor Talesinger last night and to be honest I am not sure how best to handle the situation so I am gladly open to feedback. As you all know Talesinger has a tendency to wander into places he should not while under the influence of JumJum juice. Well, to make a long story short, he fell to the splitpaw gnolls in South Karana after just zoning out of their flea-infested lair. Since he was clearly under the influence he had forgotten to get a bind so he woke up groggy in Erudin. It was late at night so I thought I would retrieve his corpse the following day and just laugh it off and call it a night. Well, due to some serious and pressing RL issues in addition to computer problems I did not have the chance to log back in and make the voyage from Odus to South Karana to retrieve my fallen corpse. I made an error in that I thought I had two weeks to recover my possessions.. I was wrong. After zoning into South Karana last night, I found that poor Talesinger's corpse, along with all of his weapons, armor and instruments had poofed. Too much time had apparently passed so my corpse had decayed. I am at a loss to tell you the truth. I in now way have the funds to replace my weapons and armor and I am not sure how to proceed from here. I have even kicked around the idea of retiring the happy go lucky bard to some bar-stool in freeport where he might spend the rest of his days under the fine delirium of Mead and Wood Elf ladies. I have Stabalot, who through the gracious donations of strangers is outfitted very well for his level. (16th)<br>
<br>
I am open to any suggestions you may have.<br>

May the Muse Grace you...<br>

Oh man, that is harsh.  A bard from Sacred Valor ahd something silimilar happen, except it was a game glitch that Verant refused to call a glitch and they blamed him, but anyway he lost his corpse at around level 30-35.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, we can do a few things.  First if you could list the stuff that you had on you, or as much as you can remember, then we can get an idea of what we are looking at.<br>
<br>
Next, we can see what people have lying around in their banks and if they have it or something similar we can work something out to get it for you.  We can also form a hunting party or two and hunt down some of the things you had.  We had decided to get a guild treasury going and this would be one of its uses.  The only thing is I didn't set it up, few too many things going I guess.  I can check around and see how many donations we get and we can use that money buying anythign that may have been bequeathed to you that we are not capable of hunting down.  Or, use that money to buy some bard items Lunitune and Armonica may have that they don't use anymore cause they have found something better along the way.<br>
<br>
Yet another option, if you enjoy playing you rogue, is to play him for a while until he gets more powerful, then us more powerful folks can go around slaughtering the things that dropped your stuff or dropped things for quests for your stuff.<br>
<br>
I feel for ya, understand why you would want to quit the character.  Jazi (SV bard) almost quit the game he was so frustrated.  But we loves our talesinger and we want to see him get back up and running as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
Lets get some more input from others and see what we want to do.  Also, in the mean time, if you could post a list that would be great.<br>
<br>
Knowing how much time and effort goes into items and stuff this must be disheartening, just don't give up because it is not irreplacable.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

Goladar lost all his gear at lev 15ish to a similar fate and was pretty down. But a quick rummage through banks and a few plat here and there and he was viable again.<br>

The first thing to do though is email Verant, and also petition the GM.  They can easily get your stuff from their logs.  You need to explain to them how with all these patches and bugs and servers going down you have simply not been able to retrieve your corpse.  And add a little complaint about how the patches ALWAYS happen in your game time, so you only ever get to play half as much as you pay for anyways.  That will take the focus off the restore bit and place it on something different.<br>
<br>
Just indicate the date of day you died.<br>
<br>
You will be successful with this, depending on how you <br>
&quot;explain&quot; it is their fault, and how well you expain what you want (ie your corpse recovered).  </font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#fed995><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/uteorin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Teorin</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>6</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#8B4513>4/26/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#8B4513>2:21:23 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Woe unto Talesinger</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Talesinger, if you need any help what so ever you can count on me.

Thank you all for offering your time, coins and items to a hapless minstel. For now I am going to see what I can come up with on my own since I do not feel right about depleting anyone else's funds or rainy day gear stash. Lunitune, I may take you up on that Lambet quest though, would love to get some leggins or a breastplate, not sure what is involved in either quest or how difficult they are...<br>
<br>
Stabalot has ravenscale bracers, arms and legs so I am thinking about selling a piece so I can at least requip my weapons. I had a bladed thulian claw in my primary hand and a silvery war axe in the other. I was wearing mostly bronze with ringmail leggins so those items should not be ghastly exspensive to replace. I will have to replace all of my backpacks and insturments but again, those items will not set me back too much. I did have some rings and magic bracers along with a blackened iron crown but I will make due with whatever I can get my hands on for now. It is no fun at all, but better to start over with nothing than to retire the poor guy. I may still concentrate on Stabalot for awhile though, until they are close to equal in level.<br>
<br>
Oh, I did petition a GM and was told that he was very sorry but they were not allowed to replace items due to a decayed corpse. Boo!!!!!<br>
<br>
Thank you again everyone, it is times like these that I am very proud to be in our fine Guild.<br>

<br>
I must say it grieves me greatly, this tragedy of your demise. I know that you would prefer to stand alone here but this is not the way Victus Fortis works. We are all brothers and sisters here. Some of us (Raynn for example!) know quite well what it is like to have to start over and over and over and would not have you suffer the way she has in the past.<br>
<br>
The four of us - my Galadria and Kemie - and Raynn and Lorelin - all have quite a collection of extra items in particularly weapons and armour that we pass around between the four of us and willingly lend to others at need or whim.<br>
<br>
In this collection at present are both a set of bladed thulian claws and a set of kodiak claws, either of which our dear bard is more than welcome to at least borrow until he can replace them on his own. Galadria was just given (ouch again!) a set of ivy etched legs and so has a set of small banded legs for which she must find a home. Raynn picked up an extra blood-stained mantle the other day but may not have one of US in need of it (she thinks we all may already be equipped with one!)...<br>
<br>
All four of us have been given so much by others that it seems hardly fair not to share with anyone in need. Not to mention the fact that our bank vaults and the backpacks we carry are all too often overfull!<br>
<br>
Do us a favor, Talesinger, and meet up with one of us (Raynn or Galadria or Kemie) and see what we have that you might use at least until you have regained your feet. Please? We would be grateful to you!<br>
<br>
Galadria<br>

Talesinger, It is never a problem to do this for a friend.  The minute you do not feel right about it think of what you would do if it was me, or Galadria, or even our newest member Rennigin.  I know you well enough to know for a fact that you would jump in and help with all you can.  I currently have a silvery war axe you can have.  It is 6/22 and I also have a Langseax which is 6/23 warrior only sitting in my bank because of the 1 speed difference.  I think I can live with that difference since it is in my off hand so you are welcome to the axe.<br>
<br>
I wish my extra bronze was medium so you could wear it.  I have pretty much retired Warnin and the lending of his armour would have been nothing, yet it is a mute point.  I would be more than happy to accompany you guys on your quests for Lambent armour.  I will also be happy to camp the PGT and grab you one of those for your off hand.<br>
<br>
I am not sure where the medium drops, but given where the large and small bronze drops I am sure a mid-20 level group can go in and kick some tail to start collecting it.  Either that or I know of a very good way to make some quick coin.  The only thing is you have to do it in off hours.  The DF orc camps in East and West commons drop those belts.  A mid-20 level can own those camps easy.  The only thing I wouldn't do is take the camp from a group.  If they are empty just whack the heck out of those orcs.  Bring as many bags as you can carry.  In prime time, go to EC and auction them at 4-5pp each.  A twink will buy them, I have sold a lot worth 75pp in about 4 minutes before (that is with a discount for buying in bulk).  I sell them singly 5pp and an 8 slot back back full for 35pp.  Considering the spawn time and how fast a 20th level character can chew through the orcs, pick the camp in WC near the Kith zone line and you are laughing. <br>
<br>
Check out <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eq.stomped.com">eq.stomped.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> for where medium bronze drops and post it here.  We can then arrange a hell of a hunting party for it.  <br>
<br>
Please, don't refuse our help as we do it out of friendship and the fact we know you would do it for us.<br>
<br>
As for what Lunitune said, if you email Frizznik directly explaining hte situation about the server down times and patches and stuff, but word it very politely and not as an attack he just may be kind.  Start off with, &quot;I know this is partly my fault, but...&quot; type thing and it usually gets him to respond.  Frizznik is unpredictable but can be extremely nice sometimes.  You may get lucky.<br>

I am really moved by the help you have all shown me. Seriously. It is simply amazing to me that you have all gone so far out of your way to help out poor talesinger even though I don't log near as many hours in game as the rest of you. <br>
<br>
Thanks especially to Tallon for porting me all over to regain lost items, to Galadria and Raynn for lending me some weapons and to our amazing leader Ferrum for loaning me a fair amount of plat so I can purchase my own weapons. You guys (and ladies) and the best!<br>
<br>
Galadria, I am ready to return the claws and the whip since I have the funds now to purchase my own arms. A RL twin brother helped me out with some fine steel plate so I am taken care of as far as armor. What I was missing I made up for by selling a piece of Stabalot's Ravenscale and buying bronze.<br>
As soon as I can I will start paying you back on the loan ferrum. It may take some time but rest assured my old friend.. I won't leave you hanging. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Thanks again to you all, you have made me feel even more strongly about this guild and the great people that make it up. If any of you ever need anything, Talesinger will lend his lute withouth hesitation.<br>
