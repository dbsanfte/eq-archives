Honesty is valued in The Drunks of Tunare, please treat others in guild and out as you would like to be treated. We understand not everyone can get along all the time, however try to remain level headed and be quick with the mind and not the tongue.<br><br>Loot<br><br>The Drunks of Tunare strongly support the CaWu (Can and Will use) system of distributing items. If a guild member is in a pick up group then the loot rules will be as stated by the current leader of said group. If any member is caught selling or trading loot won on a CaWu guild roll they will be removed from the guild. <br><br>Guild Vault<br><br>Glendore Steelbrew is our Guild Vault manager. Please visit this link for Rules and Guidelines for the Guild Vault. <br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub44.ezboard.com/fyeoldpubfrm19.showMessage?topicID=2.topic">pub44.ezboard.com/fyeoldp...ID=2.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>Guild Member Price Consideration<br><br>You are not to charge the maximum market value of any given item back to a member of our guild, if you do not wish to sell an item for less than market value, then do not offer it back to the guild. Any loans taken by fellow members from the guild vault or from other guild members are expected to be paid back in full on an agreed date unless other plans have been made. If you are disbanded from the guild, it does not relinquish you from debt with your former guild/guildmate if one is owed. If any guild members are caught charging more then market value for an item to a current guild member, and you are aware of this, you will be immediately removed from the guild. Regarding spell drops - if a spell comes across your hands that you are not able to use, while you are not required to sell or give the spell to the guild, it is in good taste to ask fellow members if anyone needs the spell before auctioning it publicly. We ask that you do not sell spell drops to guild members but to give them freely to members who Can and Will use them. If that is not acceptable then please do not offer to sell said spell(s) to your fellow guild members.<br><br>Membership<br><br>The Drunks of Tunare are always looking for more people to join our family. If you are interested in joining us and are level 15 or higher, please contact one of our officers or the guild leader. You may also post in the membership area of our ezboard at the following address. <br><br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub44.ezboard.com/fyeoldpubfrm16">pub44.ezboard.com/fyeoldpubfrm16</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->  <br><br>You will be invited into The Drunks on a three week trial membership. During those three weeks it is YOUR responsibility to make the effort to group with any of the guild officers or the guild leader at LEAST three times. At the end of the three week period the Guild leader and officers will hold a vote considering your membership. At that time if the vote is in your favor you will become a member of The Drunks of Tunare. In event the vote is not in your favor you will be disbanded from the guild on good terms and be allowed to reapply in 60 days. As much as we hate to turn anyone down from our guild not everyone is Drunken material. I would like to note that the level limit of 15 does not apply to alternate characters in the guild.<br><br>Becoming a Officer<br><br>To Apply to become a Officer of The Drunks of Tunare you must meet the following criteria.<br><br>- You must be a guild member for at least four months. <br><br>- You must play at least 20 hours a week.<br><br>- You must be level 35 or higher. <br><br>- You must be socially active within the guild. (example: attending guild meetings and raids.)  <br><br><br>In event that you meet all the above criteria, a vote will be held by the current officers and guild leader. If the Vote is in your favor you will be awarded officer man ship. In event that the vote is not in your favor you may reapply in 120 days. Please do not take offense if you are not accepted as an officer. We simply cannot let everyone become one. <br><br>Twinking<br><br>The Drunks of Tunare stand neutral on these grounds. We are not against, nor fore the twinking of characters. We believe that twinking does take away some of the fun of the earning process of the game but you are free to decide on your own if you would like to become a &quot;twink&quot; or not.<br><br>Power Leveling<br><br>Power leveling is not common practice in The Drunks of Tunare.  Many members have different playing schedules, some play more and some play less.  As for power leveling younger members of the guild, we ask that said members do not ask to be power leveled. We do not object to older members offering to power level younger members as long as it does not become a common practice.<br><br>Farming <br><br>The Drunks of Tunare do not encourage the farming of items. Though we understand some items are more easily obtained this way, we ask that if another group wants your position in hopes of EXP that you honorably step down or work out an agreement with the group leader. <br><br>Killing of like aligned NPC's <br><br>We at the Drunks of Tunare discourage the killing of like aligned NPC's for the sake of EXP. We believe it takes away the basis of the game, though we understand that it must be done in some instances. We also ask that you do not kill guards that younger characters depend on to save there lives for obvious reasons. <br><br><br>Thank you, <br>   The Drunks of Tunare <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub44.ezboard.com/fyeoldpubfrm21.showPrevMessage?topicID=4.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/fyeoldpubfrm21.emailToFriend?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/fyeoldpubfrm21.threadControl?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/fyeoldpubfrm21.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/fyeoldpubfrm21.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub44.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="yeoldpubfrm2">News<option value="yeoldpubfrm3">Off Topic<option value="yeoldpubfrm5">Raves<option value="yeoldpubfrm6">Items -
