This is an actual radio conversation released by the Chief of Naval Operations, 10-10-95, MSG#H0000115020ecb52EMHS <br>
<br>
#1: &quot;Please divert your course 15 degrees to the north to avoid a collision.&quot; <br>
<br>
#2: &quot;Recommend that you change YOUR course 15 degrees to the south to avoid a collision.&quot; <br>
<br>
#1: &quot;This is the captain of a U.S. navy ship. I say again, divert YOUR course.&quot; <br>
<br>
#2: &quot;No, I say again divert YOUR course.&quot; <br>
<br>
#1: &quot;This is the aircraft carrier Enterprise, we are a large warship of the U.S. navy. Divert your course NOW!&quot; <br>
<br>
#2: &quot;This is a lighthouse. Your call<br>

Military Wisdom <br>
<br>
1. If the enemy is in range, so are you. <br>
<br>
2. Incoming fire has the right of way. <br>
<br>
3. Don't look conspicuous: it draws fire. <br>
<br>
4. The easy way is always mined. <br>
<br>
5. Try to look unimportant, they may be low on ammo. <br>
<br>
6. Professionals are predictable, it's the amateurs that are <br>
dangerous. <br>
<br>
7. The enemy invariably attacks on one of two occasions: <br>
When you're ready for them. <br>
When you're not ready for them. <br>
<br>
8. Teamwork is essential; it gives the enemy someone else to <br>
shoot at. <br>
<br>
9. If you can't remember, the claymore is pointed at you. <br>
<br>
10. If your attack is going well, you have walked into an <br>
ambush. <br>
<br>
11. Don't draw fire, it irritates the people around you. <br>
<br>
12. The only thing more accurate than incoming enemy fire is <br>
incoming friendly fire. <br>
<br>
13. When the pin is pulled, Mr. Grenade is not our friend. <br>
<br>
14. If it's stupid but works, it isn't stupid. <br>
<br>
15. When in doubt empty the magazine. <br>
<br>
16. Never share a fox hole with anyone braver than you. <br>
<br>
17. Anything you do can get you shot. Including doing <br>
dothing. <br>
<br>
18. Make it too tough for the enemy to get in and you can't <br>
get out. <br>
<br>
19. Mines are equal opportunity weapons. <br>
<br>
20. A Purple Heart just proves that were you smart enough to <br>
think of a plan, stupid enough to try it, and lucky enough <br>
to survive. <br>
<br>
21. Don't ever be the first, don't ever be the last and <br>
don't ever volunteer to do anything. <br>
<br>
22. The quartermaster has only two sizes: too large and too <br>
small. <br>
<br>
23. Five second fuses only last three seconds. <br>
<br>
24. It is generally inadvisable to eject directly over the <br>
area you just bombed. <br>
<br>

<br>
Three generals, one from the Army, another from the Marines, <br>
and a third from the Air Force, were having a debate with a <br>
Navy Admiral about whose soldiers were the bravest. <br>
<br>
To prove his point, the Air Force general calls over an <br>
airman: &quot;Airman! Climb that flagpole, and once you are at <br>
the top, sing 'Wild Blue Yonder', and then jump off!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;YES SIR!&quot; replies the airman. He takes off for the flagpole <br>
like a shot, scales up it, sings the anthem, salutes and <br>
jumps off, hitting the ground at attention. <br>
<br>
The general dismisses him. &quot;Now that's bravery!&quot; exclaims <br>
the general. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, that's nothing,&quot; says the Admiral, &quot;Seaman!&quot; A seaman <br>
appears, &quot;YES, SIR!!&quot; &quot;Take this weapon,&quot; as he offers him <br>
an M14, &quot;Scale that flagpole, balance yourself on top, stand <br>
at attention, present arms, and sing 'Anchors Aweigh.' <br>
Salute each of us, and jump off. <br>
<br>
&quot;YES SIR!!&quot; replies the seaman. He sprints for the flagpole <br>
with the weapon high over his head, and completes the task <br>
perfectly. <br>
<br>
&quot;Now that's courage!&quot; says the admiral. <br>
<br>
&quot;Courage, nothin'&quot; snorts the Army general. &quot;Get over here, <br>
private!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;YES SIR!!&quot; replies the private. <br>
<br>
&quot;Put on full combat gear, load your rucksack with these <br>
rocks, scale that flagpole, come to attention, present arms, <br>
and sing the National Anthem, salute each of us, and then <br>
climb back down, head first.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;YES SIR!!&quot; replies the private, and completes the task. <br>
<br>
&quot;Now that is a brave man! Beat that!!&quot; <br>
<br>
They all look to the Marine. &quot;Private,&quot; he says. <br>
<br>
&quot;YES SIR!!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Put on full combat gear. Put these two dogs in your pack. <br>
Using only one hand, climb that flagpole. At the top, sing <br>
'The Halls of Montezuma', put your knife in your teeth, and <br>
dive off, headfirst.&quot; <br>
<br>
The private snaps to attention, looks at the general and <br>
says, &quot;F**K YOU SIR!!&quot; <br>
<br>
The general turns to the others and says, &quot;Now THAT'S <br>
bravery!<br>

A grade school teacher was asking students what their parents did for a living. <br>
<br>
&quot;Tim, you be first,&quot; she said. <br>
<br>
&quot;What does your mother do all day?&quot; Tim stood up and proudly said, &quot;She's a doctor.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;That's wonderful. How about you, Amie?&quot; Amie shyly stood up, scuffed her feet and said, &quot;My father is a mailman.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you, Amie,&quot; said the teacher. &quot;What about your father, Billy?&quot; Billy proudly stood up and announced, &quot;My daddy plays piano in a whorehouse.&quot; <br>
<br>
The teacher was aghast and promptly changed the subject to geography. Later that day she went to Billy's house and rang the bell. Billy's father answered the door. The teacher explained what his son had said and demanded an explanation. Billy's father said, &quot;I'm actually an attorney. How can I explain a thing like that to a seven-year-old?&quot; <br>

<br>
Frodo looked out across the barren landscape, the Ring heavy in his pocket. "Oh, Sam, I'm so tired. We have travelled so far, and endured so much to come to this horrid place at last. But I cannot go on, I simply have not the strength to continue." <br>
<br>
"Enough of that, Mr. Frodo", Sam said, tears welling in his sad brown eyes. The six months of travel showed on Samwise Gamgee, and the strain of getting to this hellish point echoed still in his darkened countenance. His hood was drawn up against the hot wind blowing from the slopes of the infernal mountain. "Mr. Elrond chose well, he did, when he held counsel. He saw through to your heart, and knew you would be strong, Mr. Frodo, and that's what you are. Come now, let's get moving. The faster we're done with this unpleasant business the faster we can get back to the Shire." Sam glanced uneasily at Gollum, still tressed in the elven rope, and scratching where it burned his skin. Gollum glared back at Sam, an unmistakeable hungry leer in his look. <br>
<br>
"Aye, Samwise, it has been a long road, it's true. I do wish old Bilbo had never found this ring, and started us all on this perilous...what was that noise? Orcs?" <br>
<br>
On the path ahead, a commotion arose. Cheers and ragged screams welled from what sounded like a hundred voices filled the chasms around Mt. Doom with an unholy cacophany. From the cave mouth just ahead, where the Fires of Mt. Doom burned forever, a giant Ogre came stumbling out, and trod to within inches of where Gollum, Samwise, and Frodo sat. The three shrank back against the cliff in fear, but the ogre took no notice of them. Instead, he raised his cudgel to the sky, and screamed in the full timbre of his ogrish voice, "WOOT! Dark Lord PWNED!" <br>
<br>
An answering call of a hundred voices echoed from without the cave, and many a shout of "Woot!" and "Gratz!" came, as more and more beings piled forth from the cave. Elves, Hobbits, Trolls, and Humans all came forth, slapping the ogre on the back and looking at a small black bag the ogre held in his other hand. "PWNED!" <br>
<br>
"Uhm, excuse me...", began Frodo. <br>
<br>
"Eh?" the ogre turned and looked at the halfing, noticing him for the first time. "WTF are you doing here? Is that Mithril? Dude, WTF are you doing in this zone in Mithril? Go to Lothlorien, and get yourself a Galadriel Skin Tunic. It's like so much better than that crap you're wearing. Mithril, that's like, tradeskill stuff, right? Hey, Ubernutz, check this hobbit out, he's in this zone in fooking tradeskill crap!" <br>
<br>
"Just a sec, Urofsuke," a half elf said from a little ways up the trail. "I'm doing loot. Did you say tradeskill stuff? Hah, how lame!" <br>
<br>
Frodo's head swam, with hunger and the heat. "Yes, the tunic, it was forged by dwarves long ago, and was given to me by my Uncle..." <br>
<br>
"You're a twink?" <br>
<br>
"Ah, hmm. I was just wondering..ah, you see, I found this Ring, lost for centuries, and was sent on a quest from Rivendell to destroy..." <br>
<br>
"You're doing the fooking QUEST?! BWAH, hahahah, that's rich, dude, no one has the time to wait for that Gollum puke to spawn! Just come and kill TDL and get his hand, and do the turn in from there. WTF, I can't believe you waited for the fooking ring." Urofsuke peered down at the little hobbit, a look of distain across his broad face. "Doesn't matter now, of course, we just pwned TDL and he won't be around for a while." <br>
<br>
Frodo blinked, confused by the ogre's words. "TDL...?" <br>
<br>
Urofsuke sighed, and took on a tone of voice usually reserved for small, ogrish children who had eaten a froglok right before their dinnertime. "The Dark Lord, dude. The boss mob in this zone. We just killed him, so he won't be up for you to do the quest part with that ring." <br>
<br>
"But the council of Rivendell...." <br>
<br>
"Dude, let me tell you, Rivendell sucks. It's only good for tradeskills. Only reason to go to that zone is to pharm crowns from Elrond. Nice crown, but it's his rare. He usually just drops a no drop phial, heals damage from Mordor Blades. Like anyone uses one of those POS things." <br>
<br>
"Pharm...crowns?" Frodo's vision blurred, and he swayed backwards, momentarily losing his footing. He knocked against Gollum, who let out a yelp and scampered further back against the cliff. <br>
<br>
"Holy fook, it's Gollum!" and without another word, Urofsuke smashed Gollum with a mighty blow from his cudgel, and killed the poor, pathetic creature outright. Gollum let out a small squeal, then lay still, pressed against the elven cord. "Hahahah! Fooking Greenie mob! I love those!", and the ogre walked up and took a heretofore unseen bag from Gollum's back. "Woot! Gollum's satchel! This'll bring me a couple kpp! Uh, dude, there's another ring on the corpse, it's no drop, and not lore, if you want it..." <br>
<br>
"Now see here, Gollum was with us!" Samwise began, momentarily overcoming his bewilderment and fear to approach the towering ogre. "We were taking him to..." <br>
<br>
"Can't claim an outdoor mob, dude. Gollum's FFA. If you didn't attack him, he's not your mob. Sorry, them's the rules." <br>
<br>
"Urofsuke, my alt just reported Smaug up in Gondor, dude, let's go!" Ubernutz had finished handing around what appeared to be a darkened sword and crown. "We're porting out from here, you in?" <br>
<br>
"Yeah, I"m coming. Well, nice talking to you guys. We're porting to Gondor, you guys need a lift?" <br>
<br>
"We have walked for many months to come to this place..." Frodo began again, trying to regain some measure of control over the situation. <br>
<br>
"You WALKED? In MITHRIL? To MOUNT DOOM? Dude, there's a port in at Minas Morgul! WTF ever, okay? I'm outta here." And with that, a shimmering light surrounded the ogre, and a whooshing sound heralded his isappearance, and the disappearance of the other hundred or so souls that had gathered on that desolate trail, leaving Samwise and Frodo alone, once again, with only the bleeding corpse of Gollum for company. The one ring of power gleamed dully in Frodo's hand, and seemed, for a long while, to be just a bit heavier than it had been.<br>
