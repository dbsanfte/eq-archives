<br>
Here, then, is Kendryk's tale....<br>
<br>
*************************************<br>
<br>
Though blessed by Tunare with strength and wisdom beyond my own younger years, I have been recently blessed with the presence of one so beautiful that my mind blanks when I try and put into words what she now means to me. Though I feel as if I barely know her, she has become part of my life already. I depend upon her as surely as I do the very air I breath. She is my Desyree.....<br>
 <br>
Upon reaching the turning of 18, I found myself embedded in the continuing conflict that is always taking place in High Pass Hold. A battlefield of neverending death, you have at one end the Sharlok Orcs and at the other, Mucktail Gnolls. Both enemies of humanity have plagued HPH for what seems like centuries and yet the citizens of this rugged country are no closer to exterminating them than they were in the beginning. Many a young adventurer and many of old have lent their hands and swords and spells to this struggle, only to move on when the effort proved fruitless. Fresh from the Oasis of Marr, I felt the need to do what I could to ease these troubled people's lives. I walked into this area with an open mind....soon to find out that not everything will let one of their own die....<br>
 <br>
My first partner was my ever mysterious companion, Suruli. She, whose dark skin and many secrets, have led my heart to wander aimlessly and with no more directional sense than I have of my own. Though we paired good and did fairly well, it was obvious that we couldn't stay together. Two warriors don't make a very good team and we both knew that we would need a cleric or healer of some kind, either between us.. or for each of us. With a saddened heart, for I assumed Tunare wanted me to turn this beauty to her ways, I soon found myself bereft of her company once again. Smiling, nonetheless, I ventured out to find what evil I could, to vanquish it as best I could.<br>
 <br>
I didn't search long. As always, the orcs and gnolls were out in force. I joined with this group near the Kithicor Woods area and was soon embroiled in the struggle anew....<br>
 <br>
Dancing to the left, I watched as the sword this Orc Medic wielded slammed into the ground next to me. My own, newly acquired, Crystallized Sword dove in and sank to the hilt in its chest, as a needle would when piercing through a piece of clothing; a little resistance at first, but then sliding through it like it was air. Placing my foot against the dying Orc's chest, I began to shove it off my blade when I felt a sharp pain in my thigh. I looked over and got my Walrus Tooth up just in time to block the next swing from a club wielding Orc Mercenary.<br>
 <br>
&quot;MERC!&quot; I yelled at my group and like bees to honey, they converged on the Mercenary, their blades and  staffs and other weapons flailing away and within a few moment's time, the time it took me to disengage my sword, the Orc Mercenary was in pieces on the ground, a grissly mess, but a satisfying one, as well. Smiling to each other, we bound the wounds we could and healed those who needed it. We waited. Sure enough, more Orcs came into view...to meet the same fate as those before. <br>
 <br>
This cycle went on for what seemed forever, as these things do, until I recieved a /tell from a very distant relative. Apparently, my far distant cuz, Ordained, has had twin children. Though away from the family for so long, I was shocked by this, for the female of the two, Desyree was her name, was here, in HPH! Always willing, I begged leave of my group to see if I could help her out. I met her near the East Karana area, where she was alone. <br>
 <br>
My first glimpse of her left me without breath. I was sure I was wrong in assuming this to be her, but when she saw me, she came right at me. Looking around to make sure I was the only one here, I smiled disarmingly and took the last 2 steps to stand in front of her. Surprisingly, she hugged me! I stood rigid for a second, then relaxed, realizing she was only greeting me as a distant friend and relative...<br>
 <br>
=== I would like to point out that I am not directly related to Ordained by blood, but by marriage. Ordaineds older brother's wife is my aunt. Which makes me related to Ordained only through a marriage of my family to his.===<br>
 <br>
She explained that though her brother and she were just over their 14th turning, they couldn't manage here by themselves without some 'muscle', as she put it. Smiling, I offered, on my own, to help her if I could and she would allow. She smiled in turn and agreed...and thus began a new twist in my life...a new beginning..<br>
________<br>
 <br>
&quot;HEAL!&quot;<br>
 <br>
Her hands wove through the air even before I'd finished my request and I could catch from the corner of my eye the blue sparkling energy flicker between her fingers, playing with the air, testing it, then shooting out to encompass me in a selfsustaining bubble of life. I was bathed in a light blue radiance and I could feel renewed strength enter my limbs once again. I swung my sword with new strength and energy and watched as the gnoll, already nearing death and knowing it had failed, tried to turn and leave. My sword cleaved it from right shoulder to almost left hip, where it jammed in its hip bone. Leaving it there, I drew my Kodiak claws and parried the next thrusting weapon of the Gnoll Champion that had come around the corner as I was finishing the Gnoll.<br>
 <br>
Smiling, I feigned to the right, dropped my left leg out from under me and rolled to the left, my claws raking across the thigh and upper knee area of the Champion's leg. Regaining my feet, I found the Champion nearly on top of me and on instinct alone, rolled back with the Gnoll's momentum helping me to shove it with my feet, over and away from me. Again quickly regaining my feet, I turned and charged the gnoll. One, two, three slashes and the Champion was down, its life's blood leaking from its dozen critical wounds.<br>
 <br>
Desyree clapped as I came back, splitting what the Champion had on itself for loot, and we both sat to again talk of things. We have grown so close these last few weeks that I couldn't remember what life was like without her in it. Agreeing that we both needed to sell some of this stuff, we ventured back into the more settled areas of HPH and found a vendor that would buy and sell us food. Stocking up and getting rid of our extra wieghted items, we went outside to relax a bit in the highland air.<br>
 <br>
To our surprise, right in the middle of our makeshift little camp, a Gnoll sooth appeared! Without hesitation, I waded into it while I saw the roots and shoots of plants reach up to entangle it. Smiling at Desyree's handwork, I chopped down at the sooth with my sword and, while it ducked under my blow, jabbed my Walrus Tooth nearly completely through its skull, the tip bursting through its brain, killing it instantly. Shaking off the remains, we both decided to see if the 'spawn' rate here was better than the passage. We'd soon find that it was a bit more hectic than the passage could be.<br>
 <br>
With the next Sooth spawn, 2 Gnolls and a brawler added on. Then, another brawler and a Champion were soon added. I downed the first sooth only to have it replaced by yet another. I downed a brawler and a gnoll as well, taunting those that went for Desyree as she healed me as best she could and gave me a 'Damage Shield' with which to add extra damage to the fighting. But with so many on me, I knew, in my heart, that we couldn't win this one. My only thoughts were to get them away from Desyree.<br>
 <br>
As I ran down the steep slope, I yelled back that I saw two HighPass citizens below and would take them there. Upon arrival, I soon realized that the Citizens wouldn't help in time so again, started out for the Keep, where I should have gone in the first place. My mistake, as I was soon to understand, was giving the Gnolls, who had all indeed followed me, time to catch up. Smiling, I turned and began to attack anew, my life's blood pouring out of me in rivers it seemed, my grip on my sword and knife tentative at best. I saw the Citizens helping but the Gnolls, smelling my blood and already tasting my death, kept at me. I took hit after hit...and as I came to know my end, my last thoughts were that my Desyree was safe...she would at least live through this....the smile was still on my face when the darkness swallowed me up..<br>
 <br>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br>
 <br>
&quot;Kendryk, I'm so sorry!&quot;<br>
&quot;Tis alright Desyree, are you unhurt?&quot; I asked, this my only concern upon return to Norrath (Tunare MUST not be finished with me yet).<br>
&quot;Aye, I am fine =( &quot; she replied, her frown so apparent.<br>
Smiling, I raced towards my body, which was being watched over by 2 Citizens of HPH. Thanking them, I quickly dressed and returned to Desyree, who wisely was hiding amongst the citizens a bit further up the hill. Sitting with her, I kissed her hand, then her cheek and assured her that I didn't matter in this... that she did. I would regain my lost 'experience' and again would be better off for the learning experience of this death... don't trust the citizens, trust the guards at the Keep. She smiled back at me and nodded, her eyes and mine forever locked, as our souls were becoming.<br>
 <br>
 I hope Ordained doesn't mind ... ?<br>
