While playing my lower alt in EC, Gala and I decided to do a little PL'ing due to boredom <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  We shouted out for a camp check and no answered for the Orc 2 spawn camp so we announced that we'd taken it. Well, we were doing good til it was time to switch for her main (Galadria) and my alt...before I could switch, a monk by the name of Aamaleb came running in and right away started taking the spawn. Through curtesy, I asked him to leave, this was a camped spawn. His reply was &quot;You leave, I was here first&quot; .. &quot;PL elsewhere, I was here first&quot;...&quot;what is your problem, I was here first&quot;<br><br>Notice, he kept saying he was there first when he came upon US here. He then sat in the middle of the camp so he'd agro the orcs first. After asking him to leave repeatedly, I decided that if he was going to be rude, I'd not let him steal the camp spawn which Galadria and I had announced we were camping. I petitioned it, as did Galadria ... but no GM's were on I think ... <br><br>Anyways, it was a good way to ruin anyones day when someone so rude and selfish just waltz's in and decides you aren't suppose to be there and that it's now his camp. I do know a few ppl like this and I find that nothing pisses me off more. Needless to say, it went as you prolly guessed. Galadria and I easily killed the spawns and he finally gave up, his parting choice of words &quot;I'm tired of your childishness, I'm gonna go&quot; ... I laughed at him as he turned and ran off.<br><br>Aamaleb has shown his disregard for the rules of engagement and the rules of conduct. I would advise anyone who sees this guy to stay clear of him. A noted KS'er now, he isn't to be trusted. He even wanted to have me duel his high lvl whatever for rights to the spawn of the orc camp! ... *shakes his head in dismay*..<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/beverquestersofnorrath.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=tassius>Tassius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#8B4513>(5/31/01 1:17:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A sad story...</span><hr size=1> Give me a M<br>Give me a U<br>Give me a P<br>Give me a P<br>Give me a E<br>Give me a T<br><br>What have you got?<br><br>Aamaleb <br> <p>Tassius Vindenervis.<BR>Bane of the Undead,<BR>Servant of Victus,<BR>Friend of the Weak.<BR><BR>tassius@btinternet.com</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/beverquestersofnorrath.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=galadriaculravenni>Galadria Culravenni</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 263<br> <font color=#8B4513>(5/31/01 4:12:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A sad story...</span><hr size=1> This was indeed a very sad event! What made me feel worse was the fact there were a number of other players who were NOT in a hurry to KS or interfere who would have liked either to join our lower level(s) or were waiting patiently until we should be finished and leave the camp to them!<br><br>Several times I found myself saying &quot;Sorry, this is a disputed camp. Until the question is settled, there is no experience here for anyone.&quot;<br><br>It also always makes me feel badly when some jerk forces me to behave in a manner with which I am not entirely comfortable - to attack and kill all those green (to me) beasties just so Aamaleb wouldn't get the experience for them seemed so PETTY, yet his behaviour warranted no less.<br><br>Funny thing about cats (and remember part of Galadria's surname means &quot;lion&quot; because she can indeed be quite ferocious) is that they will purr contentedly much of the time, but if you stroke them the wrong way all of a sudden the teeth and claws come out and you'll find youself at the very least being scratched!<br><br>This guy made the game for all around him a real bummer for a good 40 very long minutes... I don't understand how ANYONE can be so obstinately intent on ruining the fun for others. Had we been allowed to bring up Ordained's alt the way we intended, we would have occupied the camp for only another 10 or 15 minutes and been gone, which is in fact what happened when that child finally left.<br><br>Galadria<br>&quot;My joy is in Victus Fortis&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=10.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=10.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm19.threadControl?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub44.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm15">Questing<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm16">Gatherings of the Brave<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm17">Tales and Roleplay<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm18">Honour Role <option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm19">Dishonourable Denizens<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm20">General Forum<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm21">Officers Lounge<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm22">Guild Tavern<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm23">Vault of the Brave<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm24">High Council Forum<option value="everquestersofnorrathfrm25">Bazaar of the Brave</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8B4513>- </font><a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/beverquestersofnorrath>Discussions for the Brave</a><font color=#8B4513> - </font><a href=http://pub44.ezboard.com/feverquestersofnorrathfrm19>Dishonourable Denizens</a> <font color=#8B4513> - </font><a href="http://victusfortis.n3.net">Home of Victus Fortis</a><font color=#8B4513> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
