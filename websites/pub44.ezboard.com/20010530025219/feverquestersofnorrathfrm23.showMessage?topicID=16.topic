I hope you all can trust me on that, and trust that if the controversy went the other way I would still be suggesting this.  I would be writing this no matter which name had 5 votes.  <br>
<br>
I started this in a new thread because I want everyone who has been active to have a say without looking at the 50+ post and saying the hell with it.  Offer your input, please.  For those who may just be coming here or haven't been able to keep up with things I truly apologize and hope this new thread will help you offer your feedback as well.<br>
<br>
For everyone, please stick with us, I am confident and concentrated on resolving this as soon as possible.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Suggested solution:<br>
<br>
I think after three weeks we can close the original poll.  The reason I feel that we should end the pole is three-fold.  First, I want this resolved as soon as possible.  Second, I think everyone has had more than enough time to vote.  Finally, I feel we can safely assume that out of the 15 people that will be in the guild to start off with only 11 care enough about the name to make the small effort it takes to get on the messagge board and vote.  Add to the fact there have been even fewer than eleven participating in the many discussions.  Anyway, this is how the vote ended:  <br>
<br>
Sojourn: 5 votes<br>
Exsequor/Exequor: 3 votes<br>
Victus Fortis:  3 votes<br>
<br>
That basically means Sojourn wins.  I don't want to pressure others to vote.  That is not right, plus if they get pressure to then there is an outside influence.  9 of the eleven votes came in the first few days.  I think Wegian voted when he got back.  And another vote came from somewhere about a week ago.  Again, there was more than enough time and information on how to get here to allow everyone the right to vote.<br>
<br>
I started the second poll about Sojourn to basically respect the wishes of those who didn't vote Sojourn.  I didn't call a revote to respect the wishes of those who voted for Sojourn.  In the second poll 6-1 say they are not against having Sojourn as the name of the guild.  In my opinion that is a majority.  Simply because in any election not every one who has a right to vote actually does.  I believe the 11 that voted are basically the voting majority in these matters, as hte rest have decided for whatever reason to not be involved in this process.  6-1 on the second vote means that no matter if the rest of the eleven vote no it is still a majority.<br>
<br>
Niffo, I understand your concerns about those who didn't vote.  I think that many are new to the game, and some that did vote did it because they felt obligated at our urging.  I believe that it is not a matter of them not caring about the guild and its name and the future of our gathering, I have to assume this because the alternative is a bit disturbing, that being they just don't care.  I feel that many are so new to the game I think they just want to play and have fun and leave this to the 6 or 7 that are actually discussing it.  I don't think it is a matter of not caring about the guild, I have to believe it is a matter of those who didn't vote/discuss things not havin the time for both learning and playing the game and getting engaged in long discussions about the guild.  <br>
<br>
My only major concerns are that some didn't even take time to hit reply when the discussions started and I asked people to sign up.  This is mostly my fault I believe, because I went about the discussions and planning the wrong way.  The list was spammed and for a while if you missed a day you were totally lost as to what was going on.  I think it may have been overwhelming and just plain intimidating.  <br>
<br>
In an election such as this try not to see it in the light that there are losers and winners.  Try to realize that though I/we want to please everyone, in the end it is a majority that will decide.  With every election there are people who chose not to vote and people who are a bit let down that their &quot;candidate&quot; did not win.  For those who did not have their guild name win the vote, I am truly sorry.  I only ask that the bond we have forged is stronger than something like this, that it will not dishearten you in our future adventures and cause the experience of what we are creating to be lessened.<br>
<br>
I believe that everyone who has wanted to have a say in these matters has had more than enough time to get involved and for those who did not vote have done so as their choice.  I have to respect their wishes to play the game or just be a member of what ever guild we create.<br>
<br>
I guess what I am saying here is that I feel Sojourn has won.  However, I will not declare it until I get feedback on this thread.  I feel my solution to the problem and my reasoning that resulted in my conlcusions are valid, however if anyone feels otherwise please speak up.  <br>
<br>
I too want this resolved.  This is already tiring for some people, and is starting to get that way for me too.  Raloth and Taallon have already stated the fact that they are past the point of caring.  That is a bad sign.  Others who started in on discussions have faded away, that is a bad sign as well.  We need to put this behind us and this is the fairest solution I could come up with.  <br>

dont worry Warnie, dont feel that anyone is upset with ANYTHING you are doing. My furry feet think you are doing a great job - I am truly thankful for the enthusiasm you bring to our little band.<br>
With each post I grow fonder of Sojourn (though I like the others as well). I doubt we can please everyone so maybe we should just set it in stone right here and now.<br>

We are [Sojourn], behold our band of friends as we bravely undertake the journey of life, death and honour throughout the lands of Norrath.<br>

<br>
===============================<br>
<br>
Main Entry: 2sojourn<br>
Function: intransitive verb<br>
Etymology: Middle English sojornen, from Old French sojorner, from (assumed) Vulgar Latin subdiurnare, from Latin sub under, during + Late Latin diurnum day -- more at UP, JOURNEY<br>
Date: 14th century<br>
: to stay as a temporary resident : STOP &lt;sojourned for a month at a resort&gt;<br>
- so·journ·er noun <br>
<br>
Sojourn (Page: 1366)<br>
So&quot;journ, n. [Cf. OF. sujurn, sujur, sejor, F. séjour. See Sojourn, v. i.] A temporary residence, as that of a traveler in a foreign land. <br>
<br>
========================================<br>
<br>
I also kind of like that spin on the last part, &quot;A temporary residence, as that of a traveler in a foreign land.&quot;<br>
<br>
I like the sound of that.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Mainly I researched it like Niffo said and couldn't find what I was looking for which led me to believe I was wrong and I misunderstood.<br>
<br>
Sojourn <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>was</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> derived from &quot;journey&quot; in 14th century england.<br>
<br>
Another thing, this may be a better way to look at it for some people who haven't thought of it this way:<br>
<br>
Each adventure each one of our characters partakes upon is infact a Sojourn from their home.  <br>
<br>
<br>
So now this word has levels.  A journey, our characters journies, our journies from real life.<br>
<br>
We could change the name to either <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Sojourns</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> or <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Sojourners</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and it would be a little less subtle and might aleviate confusion.  Sojourn in itself means <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> a</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> brief journey which is singular, that could have been the source of everyones confusion or why it might not have sounded quite right.<br>
<br>
I quite like Sojourners.  It was suggested a while ago and at the time I didn't think it sounded cool.  I thought a bit more about it and it has grown on me as well.<br>
<br>
It can stay as Sojourn, or if enough people wish it it can change to Sojourners.  Leaving it or changing it is fine with me.<br>
<br>
Sorry for adding to the discussion, the only reason I did is because I had mentioned to Niffo and I think Mytank last night about how the name was bothering me.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I am off.<br>

<br>
Thanks again - but can someone translate what this means <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  :<br>
Etymology: Middle English sojornen, from Old French sojorner, from (assumed) Vulgar Latin subdiurnare, from Latin sub under, during + Late Latin diurnum day -- more at UP, JOURNEY<br>
<br>
Is this the bit that says that the meaning is journey? Why does it say &quot;more at UP, JOURNEY&quot;. I guess I was wavering like Warnin when I went through more than 10 online dictionaries and they all had the meaning as &quot;a temporary stay&quot; - none of them even listed &quot;journey&quot; as an alternate usage or anything. I couldnt find anything similar in the latin site either apart from &quot;a temporary stay&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I dont want to join a 'pedantic' camp on this. But unlike a latin word which 'nobody' knows - this word is in regular english usage.<br>
So do you guys mind if the meaning is &quot;a temporary stay&quot; - to my thinking thats not as inspiring as &quot;journey&quot;, &quot;brave way of life&quot; or &quot;to follow to the end&quot;...<br>
<br>
sorry if this is a little retrograde again    HEHEHE  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
The word sojourn itself, though, actually stems from the word journey.<br>
<br>
Since Norrath is a mythical world and set in the past, then I don't see a problem using the historical roots of sojourn.  <br>
<br>
Warning talked a bit more about this in the other thread, about how even the nowadays usage of the word fits well upon reflection.<br>
<br>
Sojourn has grown on many of us.  The tag ingame will look very sharp, and most people equate it with &quot;journey&quot;.  We all did before we looked it up on the online dictionary.<br>
<br>
Did you guys want to re-hash a new name, or can we settle on this one?  Up to you, but sojourn is ok with me.  Taking short journeys throughout Norrath is what we do every day.  Each new zone we take a sojourn into.<br>

<br>
Little Niffo is sitting in Rivervale combing his tangled foot hairs.  After applying conditioner and braiding his lovely foot hairs he picks up his trusted mace and shield and decides to head to Lake Rathe to meet up with Warnin and Talesinger.  For us the time goes by in hours, but for our characters it goes by in days.  That trip and adventure in Lake Rathe is considered a sojourn.  A temporary journey.  For our characters each adventure is a sojourn. <br>
<br>
I don't think you will find anything that puts journey in its meaning, it is more that sojourn is derived from journey.  That was my original mistake.  I first doubted then the more I thought about it the more I was re-affirmmed that I like this name.  I agree that it is not as powerful as I once believed it to be, but I still really like it.  For Warnin it is all about adventures in (sojourns to) unknown lands with his dearest companions.  <br>
<br>
The &quot;more at UP JOURNEY&quot; was a link in the definition.  It was because the word journey is used as part of the definition of sojourn so the had a link to it.  I honestly think that when most people think of sojourn they think of journey.<br>
<br>
My thoughts anyway.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#fed995><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/uwarninwraithlore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Warnin Wraithlore</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Administrator</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>132</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#8B4513>2/3/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#8B4513>1:04:06 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><BR><img src=http://www.telusplanet.net/public/canadak/warnin1.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Guild Name Resolution (please respond)</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Hi all, I just had a few more thoughts.<br>
<br>
I think we are ripping apart Sojourn a little too much here and it may be causing others to have doubts and may make the name sound less appealing to some.  Technically, I could take Exequor and Victus Fortis and do the same thing.<br>
<br>
When I was at that webster dictionary site I signed up foor the word of the day mailing list.  I decided to see if they had something on sojourn thinking they may have had a searchable database.  They did so I did a search.  While I did not find the word I found a sentance with sojourn in it to describe another word.  I won't paste the whole paragraph which the sentance was in, but here it is.  I am hoping htis will help people to see that we (myself included) are being too literal about the word:<br>
<br>
&quot;Ashram found its place in English in the early 1900s after Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi, returning to India from a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 21-year sojourn</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> in South Africa...&quot;<br>
<br>
Ignore the content it is talking about ashram which are like hindu temples.  Hehe.<br>
<br>
