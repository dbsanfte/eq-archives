<br>
1.  Be prepared.  Make lists of what you need and have it at the ready when you're travelling through Norrath.  Ever throw away an item (like MistMoore granite, for instance) that you realize later you need for the Ultimate Totem of Everlasting Hit Points?  I have.  A list helps you keep track of what you have, what you need, and where to get it.  That being said, I have a MS Excel file of all the Ivy quest items.  If you want it, post your e-mail here and I will gladly send it to you.  If you want to make your own list, check out Allakhazam's and read the forum on it.  Lots of good info there.<br>
<br>
2.  Let people know what you're looking for.  I know there are threads on our site here for posting that, so please take advantage.  When you enter a zone in search of an item, send an ooc (I never shout because that red is just too .... newbie?) so that others know what you're up to.  For some, this may conflict with the satisfaction of hunting something down and killing it yourself.  That is even better, but if you don't mind getting a little help, then why not let the zone know?  At the very least they will let you join their group to kill the NPC that drops what you're looking for.  That way, you not only get the item, but you helped in the kill, too.  From my experience, it's difficult to solo when questing.  The MOBs that drop the stuff you need are often too high level to solo, so more than likely you will need assistance.  If I'm ever nearby (can't TP &lt;frown&gt;) I'd be glad to help out.  I have no doubt other VFers will gladly lend a hand, too.<br>
<br>
3.   Mind your faction.  Wondering why the NPC won't respond to a hail?  Maybe you need to build faction first.  The best faction lists I have found are at Allakhazam's - look them up and use them.<br>
<br>
IVY BRACERS<br>
<br>
1.  You need 4 things.  A watery ring off on aqua gobling tidal lord in Dagnor's Cauldron, the rune of ivy from Redwind in Everfrost, and 2 fire emeralds.<br>
<br>
2.  The watery ring.  I soloed a few at lvl 27, but it wasn't easy.  Mostly it will depend on your tanking ability.  They TLs can be found all over the zone, but I chose to hang out at the Fab Four camp just inside the zone entrance.  If you're running through the zone enroute Unrest, why not stop to pick up a ring?  Depending on your level, you may want to get others to help.  I killed 8 before one dropped, but usually you can find one every 3-5 kills.  Plus, TLs provide 3 plat or so loot, as well as occasional bronze items.  Not bad xp either.  The rings are lore, so you won't be able to stack up on them.<br>
Beware, the Fab Four kill stuff that's wandering by, but if you drag them something that you attacked, my experience is they will not help.  So don't depend on them to bail you out.  If you want a safety net, you can always camp more towards Unrest and zone there if you have to.  (send a shout if training, please &lt;smile&gt;)<br>
<br>
3.  The rune of ivy.  This is not easy.  You will probably need a group, because Redwind always has 4 or 5 of his icy orc henchmen around him.  It's a possible solo if you're good at harmony, but if harmony fails....  And even if harmony works, Redwind has DD that will suck about 300hp out of you, so be careful.  Usually there are a few upper 20's / low 30's camping the orcs.  Ask them to join and usually you'll receive a positive response.  Orcs are on the west side of the zone, one which is not too dangerous as most of the MOBs are animals and not aggro to rangers.  Con on the way in to determine where you stand, and camo whenever necessary.<br>
<br>
4.  The fire emeralds.  Have some cash ready.  Get yourself a few charisma items and hit the rare gem shop in Kelethin for these.  I bought mine at 91pp each with 85 charisma and amiable faction.  Maybe you can do even better.  Send me a tell if you want help buying these.  Other zones sell them as well, but I can't imagine a ranger's faction being better in these other zones than in Kelethin.<br>
<br>
IVY TUNIC<br>
<br>
1.  You need 4 items.  Meldrath the Malignant's skull in Steamfont (Minotaur Caves), another rune of ivy from Thistle Underbrush in Lesser Faydark, and 2 rubies.<br>
<br>
2.  The skull.  This is hard.  Don't EVER try to solo Meldrath as a ranger.  He takes a group of 2-3 40+ to kill, plus he has a couple high level Minotaur Guards.  Best bet is to hang out in Steamfont killing clockworks for micro servos (Trueshot) and send ooc's requesting assistance.  A druid ring is in Steamfont, and many upper levels pass through, and if you're fortunate, will lend assistance.  Some 40+ hang out here questing the Minotaur Hero that more than likely will help you while they're getting bored waiting for the Hero to spawn.  The skull does not drop every time, so be patient and hang in there.<br>
<br>
3.  The rune.  Well, this one just got tougher, I'm sad to say.  The new blight in LF makes it VERY dangerous to run around trying to kill Thistle.  His spawn loc is random, so you're best bet is to track and to have a group with you.  If you see anything yellow or above, head towards a zone.  I get nervous hanging around here at lvl 40.  Thistle himself is only 25, but can cast.  Have snare up because he runs like the dickens and you don't want to pull an uber-train.  Watch out for the new evil NPC's and brownies.<br>
<br>
4.  Rubies.  Once again, bought in Kelethin.  These were 131pp at 99 charisma.  Expensive, but worth it.  If you're hurting for cash pay a visit to Unrest.  I still marvel at the wealth of loot available there for a lower level dungeon.  Bronze and fine steel items are everywhere, plus frequent trains run to zone that you can help kill and loot.  Depending on how much bronze you can sell, I was making 50-75pp per trip, approximately every 45 minutes.  Goblins are great for loot, especially crazed goblins.<br>
<br>
That's all for now.  I hope this information is helpful for some of you.  If I can put a final punctuation on these recommendations, I'd say that tenacity and enthusiasm are more helpful than you can ever imagine.  Players are very willing to help tenacious and enthusiastic individuals.  If you're lucky, some uber will take a liking to your efforts and lend assistance that is above and beyond that normally possible.<br>
<br>
Good journey to ye,<br>

<br>
I am putting this into the questing thread, so it doesn't get punched down the general thread list by everyone's new posts.  The quest thread will allow these great tips to be right in front of all when they go seeking quest advice!<br>
<br>
Thanks a bunch!  I can tell ye took some time for this post!<br>
<br>
Take care,<br>

<br>
For all those rangers out there the attached website is fantastic for all Ranger quests, even, hushhhhhhh - Our Epic.<br>
<br>
Vlieke the Orc Impaler is noted here too as we briefly mentioned last night.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.monsterweb.org/faqs/q-rng-p.html#w-orc_impaler">www.monsterweb.org/faqs/q...rc_impaler</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Just take off the Orc impaler bit to get to the list - all the Ivy stuff is here, along with a total list of all items you need for all your quests, and where to get them.<br>
<br>
I've done that bracer quest - am Heading out to do Tunic after a brief spot of lvling at the weekend - that lvl 30 is beckoning.<br>
<br>
With the help of a friendly Pally you can take Redwind - the SK Orc in Everfrost pretty well, and he spawns every 7 minutes so no big waiting time. Drops the rune on average every other time. He /conned yellow to me at lvl 25, with 4 Icy Orc buddies who /conned white.<br>
<br>
Harmony all of them and Pull Redwind and his pet - pet is very green so dont worry about him. Get the pally to pull the guy with a bow, The SK will harm touch immediatley for 271 Hps, bah nothing to Mr lvl 31 Pally Araegorne, especially if he still has Loh. He is tough and a caster, get him snared or rooted so he cant go back to his pals and bach away. Get out your quick delay weapons 'cos interrupting his casting is real important. Let the Big Pally brute to the big damage.<br>
<br>
Once dead, finish his pet and heh presto.<br>
<br>
The Remaining Icy Orcs are good exp, but they take a while to kill, and when the new ones pop - if you havent Harmonied them you will be in a world of pain very quickly. <br>
<br>
The Tidal Lords in Dagnors cauldron have a spawn point at a camp past the fab 4 and head straight around the rocks till you find them. 2 at a time spawn fairly regularly. Harmony the 5/6 gobs that are there and pull the tidal to you and teach him the error of his ways.<br>
<br>
Anyhow - I am happy to help all who quest, finding it a great diversion from the sometimes annoying lvling drive. <br>
<br>
Vlieke - happy to come along and provide moral support if you wanna go get the Impaler, or ohh - Epic time soon huh?? <p>Semdayen Maa'Sankari<Br>Ranger of the 26th Season<Br>In the Service of Tunare<Br><Br>'I am not lost - this is the scenic route'
