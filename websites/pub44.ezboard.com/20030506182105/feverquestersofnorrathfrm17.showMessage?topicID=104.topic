Have you ever thought that there could be something different? I mean I also know what Necromancers are &quot;supposed&quot; to be like, but what if something like that changed. What if one time, and necro was to grow up and be... different? Now I know that sounds ludacris because usually people are afraid to be different. Well my, friends, am not. I love to be different, insane it might sound, but that is how my story actually got started. You know... living by my own tune.<br>
<br>
Well, you probably don't know but I acually grew up in the Oasis of Marr (read my story in &quot;The Brave&quot; section of the site). Growing to live for the undead, and despise the living. That is how I grew up. The last thin that my undead parents told me before I left them was to never forget about them. I said that I never would, I would always remember them as I still do.<br>
<br>
Now my parents were always aginst me eaving the island in the Oasis because they knew that there were things that would hurt me... Well since I was a child I was ignorant and didn't listen. I had never actually been off the island. My parents said though, 'If you leave this island, you will probably never return to the same thing.' 'Mother, I know what I am doing,' I said, 'I will be back, I promise.'<br>
<br>
She just looked at me like she would never see me agian in the same way. As I started walking down the isand I heard my mother casting a spell. I Kept walking and right when I jumped into the water to start my swim to the main land, a flash of light blinded me. A rush of cold, and then rain. I looked back and didn't see them. All I saw were the dead. Looking harder, I ran back up from the water and oe came at me, and slashed me. I looked away and started to run. As I jumped back into the water I felt the cut on my face burn and the water seeped into my cut.<br>
<br>
When I finally got to the sand on the other side tha I had so longed for every day but today. I found a book, picked it up and stated running agian for I could tell that something was comming to hit me agian. Finally I found the Land of Ro, fell on the sand and was asleep...<br>
<br>
There will be more of this tomorrow at story time.

Well when I finally did I looked up and saw several people looking at me. I stood up and brushed off all of the sand on my face and robe. he all started whispering among themselfs. I only caught one saying that, 'He has finally awoken!' Well I was feeling very wierd so I said, 'Allo allo!' hey all seemed to jump back at my speaking.<br>
<br>
'Ello 'lil Gnome. How are ya dis fine day?'<br>
<br>
Well I was kinda freaked out because a giant Troll was speaking to me, but I decided to answer, 'I'm good, I guess. May I ask why you are all looking at me so funny?'<br>
'Well lil Gnomie, when we waz running through da Oasis we saw you living among da Specs and e was not understandin why dey wazn't attackin yar.' I just stated laughing, 'Oh my friend, you perhaps don't understand that I grew up with the specs. They are my family!' They all looked at me in astonishment, 'You are sayin that they accepted you and then you left the island without their consent?!'<br>
<br>
'Well, yessir. I thought that I needed to find the world.' 'Lil gnome, you mt be more stupider then I tought. Do you know that tomorrow is th Night of te Blood Moon. It is the nigh that all the undead and Dark Elfs release their young? If you would have waited one more day then you could have left the island and they wouldn't have attacked you! You silly lil nome.'<br>
<br>
'Well, thats all well and good but I must be off. I have to find a place called Ak' Anon! I hear that is were I came from. So if you could point me to Freeport I think that is were I get on the boat to the Butcherblck Mountians.' 'Wez be goin dere als lil Gnome. We will take ya dere wit us.' 'Tat would be great!'<br>
<br>
So I followed them to Freeport and when we got there we got on the boat and started on our way. Well I waited about 4 hours andwe finally got to te Mountians. Well we all had to jump off the boat before we got onto the docks because the Dwarfs would kill me and the troll if they saw us.<br>
<br>
Well we finlly got to the land and started our run to Ak' Anon. Well we were runnin and everything was just peachey keen until we ran ino some guards. The all started running after me and yelling at me. Well the Troll turned around an started &quot;barshin&quot; them. He killed them both in a few hits! Well we kept running and ran into the Greater prt the theFaydark.<br>
<br>
Then after awhile wefound some &quot;wizzie spiers&quot;. We waited there till a wizard showed up thathad a weapon called Staff of the Four. Well I thought that it looked really cool! so h took me the rest of the way because the Troll and the est of the group had to go to somewhere called Kelethin to kill the guards there. Well we finally made it to the Steamfont Mountians. I was very happy, so much that I ran to Ak Anon with a short burts of spell call SoC (Spirit of Cheeta).<br>
<br>
When we finally got the Ak' Anon,  had a guide take me o the necromancer guild. But it was just the mines. I talked to the Master and he gave mea robe and dagger. Then from the long run a went into an Inn and fell asleep...<br>
<br>
My journies continuse later, until then my friends. Rest well...<br>
