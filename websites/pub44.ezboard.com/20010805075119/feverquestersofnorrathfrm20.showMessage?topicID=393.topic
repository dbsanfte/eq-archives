<br>
I was unable to see this in person in-game as I just returned from holidays and am getting settled in again.  It happened again, and many members have expressed their disgust over the issue.<br>
<br>
Suffice to say such conversations are not acceptable for Victus Fortis, and I want everyone to be very clear on this.  <br>
<br>
One of the guilty parties is gone from the guild, and we are currently discussing matters with the other, who is one of our longer standing members.<br>
<br>
Either way, I want you all to know that we will not have such talk going on in guild chat, and the issue is almost totally dealt with.  As I stated before, one of the two individuals has left the guild, and we are talking with the other to ensure that this never happens again.<br>
<br>
The good thing about this whole mess is now we have something to fall back on if this ever happens again.  With the whole Council expressing their support against such behaviour, you can rest assured that if another individual tries this type of behaviour again it will be dealt with swiftly.<br>
<br>
I <b>urge</b> all of you not to let this tarnish Victus Fortis as a whole over the actions of these two people.  No one else here is to blame for their decisions.  They chose to use the guild chat for sick comments, not any one else.  Do not let them control matters that they really have no power over.  They made a big mistake, and it is very much so <b>against</b> the ideologies of Victus Fortis, but they made it themselves and they will face the consequences.  <br>
<br>
We still have one heck of a group of people here, and I won't let two people ruin the feelings of the guild over their bad mistakes.  They don't represent the majority of Victus in any way, and we should not let their mistakes guide our general feelings towards our own family.  <br>
<br>
Take care all, and thanks for your patience.<br>

<br>
This means that the two in question are no longer in Victus Fortis, and that the situation is at a complete close.  I apologize once again for those who were offended, and now we must move on and ensure that these types of actions never take place again in our group.<br>
<br>
I feel very badly about this whole thing, but it has now drawn to a total close and now is the time to sit back and get back on track.  <br>
<br>
I am looking forward to seeing you all in Norrath.<br>

Take care,<br>

<br>
I consider myself friends with Inouva and have not been on lately at all so I did not see what happened. However ... if something is done that is upseting and offensive to another guild member it should be taken care of.<br>
<br>
Inouva just because of what happened does not mean that you have to leave the guild like this.  You know me very well and I am saying this out of friendship.  You have to respect people and know when to keep it toned down.  The larger the guild gets the more personalities there are to deal with, which means that each and every one of us needs to be respectful of everyone.<br>
<br>
Now and then there are going to be sexual jokes and such, it can be funny and make guild chat interesting, but we cannot take it to far (as it happened last week).<br>
<br>
Not sure if I am rambling or not but I hope you (inouva) understand along with everyone else reading this.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

<br>
I am sorry this has turned out this way.  I missed the guild chat so am not quite abreast of what exactly was said. <br>
<br>
However, I just wanted to point out that the guild did not intend to be telling you what to do in any way.  It does not mean to tell anyone what to do.  It is just that some people were offended by what transpired, and wished for it not to continue.  We are a community and consequently we have to all make sacrifices to live together in harmony <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I hope it works out for you Inouva, thanks for the time you did spend with us. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/beverquestersofnorrath.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=galadriaculravenni>Galadria Culravenni</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 503<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/26/01 12:33:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Recent Guild Chat Comments wont be tolerated here ...</span><hr size=1> Hi... this is Raynn, sorry I'm posting as Gal but she doesn't mind <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
   <br>
    I have a few things to say.  I was not on line when either incident happened, however, I know quite a bit about it.  I think that what Inouva needed to post was an appology, NOT such a childish remark as &quot;Nobody can tell me what to say&quot;.  My mother has been VERY upset about this whole situation, and although I cannot listen to her exact thoughts, I do know that it is not very easy to get her as vehemently angry at a PERSON as she has been at Inouva for the way he acted.  It seems to me that a few people have been too willing to forgive these rude, abusive, and thouroughly disgusting words as joking or teasing.  It WAS between two people who have been friends for some time, but it was absolutely not necessary to involve the whole guild.  If it had been said in tells, between friends who understand that is IS just a joke, then such banter could be called appropriate, but inflicting such vile comments on the whole guild is entirely uncalled for.  Especially considering the fact that we have a 15 year old young man with us.  Gypso, I believe, showed maturity beyond his years to decide for himself that he does not need to be subjected to such insensitive material.  I am completely behind his decision to leave the guild, however, I am glad he is back, and I sincerely hope that none of us will EVER have to be faced with that type of decision again.  VF should be a place where we can all feel comfortable.<br>

And I would like to give my perspective which is perhaps somewhat different. The discussion between Inouva and his friend was in bad taste but certainly no worse than much that one hears during prime time TV every evening. It did however make a number of others in guild chat uncomfortable and therein lies the problem.<br>
<br>
The real tragedy was the childish refusal of the two to listen to the requests of other members who asked them to stop or to take their discussion to tells. I'm sorry to see that exact same lack of maturity evidenced in Inouva's response above. <br>
<br>
I wish that higher lvl characters could see their potential to act as examples for others. Fortunately and unfortunately, our little fantasy world is populated with real people with both their beautiful and their ugly characteristics. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub44.ezboard.com/uveleskia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Veleskia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/26/01 6:51:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Recent Guild Chat Comments wont be tolerated here ...</span><hr size=1> Inouva, dear, if you are reading this...please know that I hold nothing against you and I wish you the best of luck out there. <br>
<br>
But to the rest of us, this situation has been dealt with as the HC saw fit...it is time to move on and make Victus a better group then it was before. Make a note and please reread the charter. <br>
<br>
Raynn, I'm assuming that you are the daughter that Galadria mentioned. You've earned my respect for being extremely mature at your age. As well as Gypso. <br>
