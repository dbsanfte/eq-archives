set of papers, stashed away in my parents things. Not knowing what it might be, I flipped through them...and came upon a most interesting name..Ordained Silverbranch. At first, I didn't know if this was the same Ordained that I believe is my distant relative, but upon reading further, I discovered that he is. I didn't know he had a last name and I was very curious to find out how he either lost it or had it removed, whichever the case may be. And so, taking these papers down to my kitchen, I made a quick bite to eat and poured a glass of elven wine and sat by my fire to read.....<br>
<br>
As with all wood elfs, I began my life in Greater Faydark, on the continent of Faydwer. At an early age, it was discovered I carried, strongly within me, the gift of Tunare. Power so strong that as I walked through the forest, animals would literally walk up to me and nuzzle my hand, wanting my attention. The druids in Kelethin, the city I lived in, quickly snatched me up and took me to their guild to begin my training...my new life. I never saw my parents after that...nor do I remember them.<br>
<br>
4th turning : I remember my first real battle, in which I was the 'healer' of my group. I had shouted out near Kelethin that I was in need of a group so that I might better know my surroundings and better know the racial enemy of my people, the dreaded orcs. A group of adventurers soon got ahold of me and informed that yes, they had need of my healing abilities and sent one of their number to guide me to what is affectionately called 'Orc Hill' Through winding trails and darkness, I was lead and soon came upon my first real battle field. Bodies lay everywhere, their lifes blood mingling with the dirt beneath. Mine eyes began to water as I realized...this is real. This is what they have trained me for. I began at once to heal whoever I could, regardless of who they were. My group soon reformed and I had to devote my full attention to them instead. Though others were there, I could not share with them my gift of healing for fear that my own group would perish. Hours passed....<br>
<br>
<br>
I set down my drink and sandwich, shocked at what i was reading....This was the life story of Ordained...Ordained!! I couldn't believe my luck! ...I took a quick bite of my sandwich and picked up the next page...<br>
<br>
<br>
Without being aware of it, I found myself gaining a turning here, a turning there...though I had begun to feel the presence of Tunare more and more, I was yet unaware of the implications of this til there was a lull in the fighting, and we all sat down to rest, some to meditate. It seemed like no time had passed, but that is, of course, an illusion of battle. One of my group came up to me and smiled. &quot;Grats, Ordained, on your recent turning!&quot; he said, taking my hand and pumping it once. So shocked was I that I just stood there for a moment. Then, smiling, I thanked him and informed the rest of my party that with this new turning, I was granted a new array of spells for which to employ. Laughing, they nodded and told me to venture back to my guild to see what new things I could learn....and so I quickly backtracked back to Kelethin, where I entered my guild to find my guild leader, The Heartwood Master, waiting.<br>
&quot;So, it has happened. Our flowering bud has sprouted at last, and has seen some of what we do here.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, master, I have seen the hated enemy of our people and have done battle with them.&quot;<br>
The Heartwood Master then proceeded to show me which gifts Tunare had bestowed upon me. I was shocked at the variety of them! So many different ones......<br>
<br>
After an hour training, I was let go to again go out and see what I could see. I carefully made it back to Orc Hill, where my group was getting ready to again send out a foray to battle the orcs. It seemed like days of constant fighting and one turning after another did I receive. At the turning of 8, my group agreed that they were ready to venture into the orc stronghold itself! I was aghast! how could we, so few, hope to defeat a whole stronghold?! They laughed and said that we would be but one group amoungst many! ... I smiled, my face turning red. &quot;oh&quot; was all I could say....and so, lead by one who knew the way...we headed towards...Crushbone.....<br>
<br>
<br>
This was incredible. After finishing my sandwich and my wine, I cleaned up my mess, my mind racing with what I had just read.......<br>

<br>
So much noise. I've never in my life seen or heard such a racket. It was like a million souls talking all at once! The orc stronghold, Crushbone, was filled to the brim with groups vying for each kill. At times, fighting amoungst themselves to kill!! My mind, even to this day, is unable to comprehend such things. To kill orcs is a deed that serves everyone noble and good, yet here, so near my home, these 'adventurers' were fighting each other...some even dueling! My group stayed clear of these, have no doubt. Being some of the youngest in here, we had no intention of getting waylaid by any orcs while watching the antics of those better left at home.<br>
<br>
Anxious to use my new spells and my recently learned abilities, I gently urged my group off to the side. &quot;We must explore this place before we go off wandering aimlessly about, perhaps to die without knowing&quot; I told them, my eyes constantly scanning the surroundings. Agreeing with my caution, they sent out the ranger in our group, a mere 7 turns old. I was worried from the start for him, for he and I had grown close in the short span of 2 turns. My worries were well founded when we all 'felt' his pain as one spear after another entered his body, killing him swiftly. Aghast at our lose so soon, we located his body and as a group, evac'ed ourselves to the entrance. By the grace of Tunare, who's hand guided him, my friend found his way back to Greater Faydark, where he appeared as a newborn does, with nothing at all. Thankfully, a passing druid of high standing was there and he offered to assist my friend in his return to us. <br>
<br>
Once more, my group ventured into Crushbone, whole once more. The clash of steel and the cries of pain and glory filled the air and made my blood run faster with anticipation. I WANTED to kill...I wanted to be a part of this...I could no longer push the noise and the feeling out. I could tell my group did as well. Agreeing to find a spot and lure orcs to us, we located a spot by a river that seemed to flow throughout Crushbone. Here, for the next few days, we lured and killed 10's of 100's of orcs. With each death, my knowledge and experience seemed to grow out of control. I soon became filled with too much, I think...for I ventured too far out of my groups protection, chasing a cowardly orc who chose to run then fight. Before I knew what was happening, the biggest orc I'd ever seen was upon me! &quot;Fall before the might of Crushbone!!&quot; it yelled at me, swinging a rusty broadsword at my head. I ducked, being far more agile then it, and in return, swung my mace at it's knees. I connected but it was as if my blow phased it not. I never saw the sword swing back, the flat of the blade catching me a glancing, but nonetheless, painfull blow to my temple. Lights exploded all over my vision and I was stunned. Fire, like none I'd known thus far in my life, shot through my body in pulses as I soon realized that the orc had plunged it's sword deep within my gut. It's grin was the last thing I saw...and it's words &quot;None shall stand against the might of the orcish hordes of Crushbone!&quot; the last I heard.<br>
<br>
Weightless and adrift for what seemed for hours, a voice came out of the nothingness. It was calming, soothing and it put me at ease right away.<br>
<br>
&quot;My son, what has befallen you? You have let this feeling of overconfidence and superiority lead you down the wrong path, one that will eventually take you to your demise. Turn back from this path, follow my light, child, for you are destined for so much more. Follow me and in my name, spread that which you hold dearest...&quot;<br>
<br>
With that, I was thrust violently back to the earth, my body, aching and a curious tingling feeling in my stomach. Looking around, I realized that that had to have been Tunare! She has granted me another chance! Feeling her love flow through me, I quickly retraced my steps back to the stronghold of Crushbone. <br>
<br>
I must admit, I had a very uneasy feeling seeing my own body for the first time. It was most unsettling. Dragging it back to the entrance, I pushed it to the side and began to redress myself. Behind me, I heard some commotion and turned to see an elven female ranger battling an orcish legionaire. Her movements as fluid as water, she wove a dance of death around the orc that soon had it stunned, disarmed and dead within moments. I was mesmerized by her sword play....so effortless. Turning, she noticed me and smiled. I was struck dumb by her beauty. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hail, friend&quot; she said to me.<br>
&quot;Hail, to you as well, brave warrior&quot; I replied. Finishing my retrieval of my gear, I stood to gaze upon her. <br>
&quot;My name is Ordained&quot; I told her, extending my hand.<br>
&quot;Tanilae&quot; she replied, taking my forearm in a warriors shake. Her grip was like iron and I was again overwhelmed by her presense....<br>
<br>
____<br>
Tanilae? Who was this? I'd never heard of her before...<br>
____<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyways, Tanilae did what she could to help me along and soon parted company from me when I was united with my group once more. <br>
<br>
Again, time slipped away from me during my time in what was called CB. Turns of my life came and went, leaving me feeling old beyond my years with this constant, endless slaughter. At the tender turning of 10, I decided that enough was enough. I was bored here, I felt a yearning for so much more! Bidding my group farewell, I saddly parted ways with them. Though I knew I'd miss them terribly, I had to see more. The world does not revolve around Greater Faydark.<br>
<br>
I ran through the woods, my mind racing as to where I would go from here, when I came upon a group of fighters at Orc Hill. The ones that I noticed right off where a tall elven woman in platemail and another in a flowing green gown. Before my eyes, I saw this one in the gown weave her arms about in seemingly random patterns and between her hands, energy crackled and spat. With a sudden surge, this energy shot out at an orc that had wandered by them. Knocked back a good 5 feet, the orc nonetheless recovered, though burned horribly, and raced towards this ... caster. Seeing that no one was paying too much attetion, I ran to her aid. The one in platemail was also there, though I wasn't sure if they could handle this orc. Arriving just before the orc, I asked them if they needed help. Before I had finished my own question, the one in platemail, like the one in the gown begain to weave her hands through the air. From her came a sizzling crackling sound. A high pitched squeel alerted me and I turned to see the orc convulse and wither on the ground, not more than 3 feet in front of these two. In just a few seconds, it was over, the smell of burned, charred flesh the only remainder of this orc. <br>
<br>
Turning back to the ladies, I noticed scratches and bruises on both. Calling to Tunare, I cast my gift upon them without thinking of asking or whether I should. I just did. When both were somewhat recovered, we sat together and talked. Though amoungest many orcs, Orc Hill was nonetheless heavily camped by many young groups, seeking their glory, so that we sat in relative safety. Talking the night away, I soon learned their names, their chosen field and their age...not even 5 turns old yet such power do they wield! The one in the gown was named Arialyss, a wizard....and the one in plate was named Cassendra, a cleric of Tunare herself. Though I would have liked to converse longer with these two, my restlessness soon became evident and they both bade me leave, for something pressing was upon me. Smiling at both of them, I did indeed take my leave of them, though reluctantly.....little did I realize til much later that those two would be my constant companions through almost my entire life.......<br>
<br>
____<br>
.....I know those two. Gods, they are like my sisters!....Putting my wine down, I stretched and laid the notes down. The hour was late but I couldn't stop now. I had to read more. It was as if I couldn't help myself.....<br>

<br>
Restless and anxious to see what I could see, I ventured out of Greater Faydark to the neighboring Mountains of ButcherBlock. Hearing in Kelethin of the dwarves that reside here and seeing a smattering few in my home city from time to time, I was intriqued as to what sort of race these 'Dwarfs' were. Seeing to tower over them, I found that I wasn't the only elf to venture into these mountains. A number of elves were here, killing stray beasties as best they could, to rid these mountains of such vermin. Though pained by the lose of my home, I nonetheless continued on, my spirit and soul yearning to see the world. <br>
<br>
I ventured all over the mountains, at times lost and confused. Though stranded in the wilderness of this place, I still came across such kindness and generosity from others that I was filled with a sense of .. belonging. Though slaying the evil that seemed to abound here, these kind souls took a few moments to tell me how to get to a safe place for which to base my exploration from. Though at times a little off, I was able to find someone to correct my direction. Soon, I found the Cross-Roads, a place that is well guarded and a safe place from which to venture from...and so I began exploring my self and my abilities....<br>
<br>
Again, time seemed to speed on by and within moments, it seemed, I had turned a strong 12. Though familiar with these mountains and having grown very attached to them, I knew that here was not my ending point....but a stop off. I soon made preperations to go further. But where, I asked myself? Where else was there. To the east, water for as far as the eye could see. To the west, unknown and, I am told, very dangerous country, too dangerous for me. That's when again, I happened upon Arialyss and Cassendra. I had just returned to the Cross-Roads to rest from my latest excursion when I saw both of them sitting there. <br>
&quot;Hail&quot; I shouted as I came up to them. I was surprised that, though I had gained my 12th turning, they had not reached their 9th yet. Greetings were exchanged and I agreed to help them with a group that they were forming. Soon, a warrior wandered by and another. Within moments, we had 6 willing people for which to do battle against the evil things in the world. Following them, I soon discovered that we were going to a place just off of  the mountains, known as Dagnor's Cauldron. This was one of the places that I was told was too dangerous, I shouted to them. They all smiled at me and said not to worry, to stay near the water line or up high on the right wall. .... and with that, we entered...<br>
<br>
___<br>
Oh wow....I can follow this plan for myself, to gain my own turnings! ... I read on, hope bubbling within me!<br>
