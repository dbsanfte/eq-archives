Fen didnt send me obscene tells, he was just pissed, as i would have been in a similiar situation.<br>
<br>
I like fen tho, and i feel for his plight. Fen im telling the truth here, if you come with me to hate, its posted on the calander, i will default the staff to you if magi is up, i will also make magi a priority. I am willing to do for you, what your own guild won't. because like you, i have been in the exact same situation, and i feel for you. However to make this straight a final time, what happened to you, was just plum bad luck. Sorry it had to happen to you this time.<br>
Hopefully this gets to you, cause i am sincere. <p><IMG SRC=http://www.lochshea.com/sig/delt.jpg

Not only is his name getting thrown around here... And Having other people speak for him (Which as I understood, he didn't want to start anything to begin with and has appologized To Tal and Delt already) I'm pretty damn Sure Fenren is capable of speaking on his own. He doesn't need People Like Slyde Going around posting One side of the story, without even bothering to get the facts straight, To Not only XA. But to Clan Phoenix and Seekers of Lore as well. I'm surprized I haven't seen the post "Xegony Alliance Issue" anywhere else.. Maybe I'm just missing it. <br>
<br>
Slyde should have gotten the CORRECT info as to what really happened and not the BS he decided to post all over the place. If this is how the Guildleader of House Kel`Dar is... I really feel sorry for you guys. I was also around back when DoK actually had an influence on XA. Slyde as a founding member? HA. Once XA got enough publicity Every single DoK member pretty Abandoned XA anyways. No leading raids, no participating in raids, and very few of them even read the XA boards after that. I know.. I WAS Around then. I can even remember a post on the XA forum which said something like "We're too busy with our own guild raids and don't have the time to lead XA raids" That post was from Colu.. and forgive me if some of the wording might not be 100% accurate... After all, It has been that long since a HKD member has influenced XA at all.<br>
<br>
I had lost my respect for Dragons of Kel`Dar a while ago and those who had my respect, Lost it. Now I know there are probably some good people in HKD, Hell.. I know Esmos is a part of that guild. But, what is the point of this? Nothing can be done about it. Deltanamos, who has been my friend ever since about level 10. which was 2 years ago, Finally Got his Epic Hate staff.  If we we're to find out that the Magi was up. and Took longer in Acrylia than we did, Resulting in XA to leave Hate Completely. Then to go do it all on our own about an hour later.. Would you even be bitching right now? I believe we both know the answer to that one.. No you wouldn't. But, we found out He was up. and We we're in the middle of the High Priest Ring When Delt said in the channel that the Magi was up in Hate and he had the staff. XA was up there, we couldn't do anything about it. And we sure as hell didn't ask Tal to agro mobs from the 2nd floor, wiping out her own raid, just so she could call it and let us have the Magi.  The Magi was up and was casting and it was announced. Fenren managed to miss that, Tough luck for him. I'm sorry, but thats just the way it is. I do wish him luck on future XA Hate raids seeing how HKD is too high and mighty for Hate and to actually help one of their own get his epic piece rather than flaming those who did on 5 Different Forums. And Fenren.. When you win the staff in Hate for your epic... I'll be sure to congratulate you =)<br>
<br>
Oh, And I AM the Guildleader of Soul Survivors. If you have a problem, Talk to me. I sure as hell was online last night when "We didn't have any officers" or whatever the hell was said.<br>
<br>
If HKD wants to allow those who cleared 90% of the path to a demi in Hate or Fear, who do not have the power to kill that demi a chance to stay and roll on An Epic Piece that One of their members Deserves. Then you do that. Although I'm Absolutely positive that what you say you'd do and what actually would be done are two completely different things.<br>
<br>
The Raid after Taleriana's was a Soul Survivor Raid. Why would we allow any mages other than the one in our guild to loot that staff? We sure as hell didn't need any outside help. Delt Rarely thinks about himself. It was not delt's responsibility to go around Talking to Fenren and Meinadin About the Magi. Did he screw them over? No. Its not his Fault the XA raid ended when it did. They could have avoided their last wipe and gotten the magi too. But, They didn't. Better Luck Next Time. We didn't Screw Fenren or Meinadin over. Yes they helped clear the way, But That is also something we could have done ourselves. Magi P`tasa was not a goal the XA raid was after. They just fell short of it, yes. But It was never a goal of the XA raid. So We took advantage of it, yes. But we didn't screw anyone over.<br>
<br>
Oh and I guess since we rezzed a couple of Inner Circle Members in the Hole today that means we're in cahoots with them too.. seeing how we try to be Exactly like them and as we pulled an "inner Circle move" last night. They are our mentors after all. =P Its all a Big conspiracy! XA, SS, IC!. We have a plan to Rule the Xegony Server and to Screw Each and Everyone over!. You better watch out.. Our Plan has been revealed now! <p><P><center>

Sorry that there is such a huge cloud surrounding such a great accomplishment.<br>
<br>
I've read the thread here, the thread on XA boards and the thread on HKD boards.  The only reason I feel I should voice yet another opinion on this topic is because I am part of HKD.<br>
<br>
Here is the main problem as I see it - HKD, XA leaders are all at fault in this mess.  Slyde should have gathered more information and taken this issue to a more private venue before opening it up to public shredding.  <br>
<br>
XA leaders are at fault for miscommunication to the raid that was ending. (ie not everyone on the raid was in the XA chat and information was passed to there, not the raid channel.  A forgivable and very easy to make mistake.)  <br>
<br>
Delt did recieve &quot;insider information&quot; and used that for his gain.  Is it right, is it wrong?  Well, if you took it to court and this were the financial world he'd be in a heap of trouble.  But this is EQ folks, kudos to him on being out there working hard to be privy to this information.  If I, or Rukog were in his shoes, we would never have asked for a default to ourselves.  Delt didn't have to open roll on it, that is a call only each individual could make.  In HKD we pride ourselves and reward selflessness, therefore it's hard for some of us to understand how anyone in that situation could seperate the end of an XA raid and a single guild coming in and allowing those raiders to attend without being allowed to roll on a hard to get epic piece.  Soul Survivors had no obligations to those raiders once they took over.<br>
<br>
In all these threads there are only 2 side issues that I must debate.<br>
<br>
****quote***I'm in full belief that if House Kel'Dar, or whatever their name is now, cared about their mage, they would have been there too had they known he was up; I would garner he would have told his guild he wanted this piece, and them knowing he was in hate, they might have had their ears pricked up to assist him or congrat him. I find it hard to believe that in all this time the Magi was up, this mage who was waiting and hoping and praying for him to spawn, and was on this raid to benefit himself in a way his guild would apparently not, had never once seen him cast a spell. The very minute I entered the plane and went to the camp spot I could see the Magi Casting.***end quote***<br>
<br>
If you already had forces gathering as soon as everyone says here, HKD never would have considered going for Magi.   Are you suggesting that HKD should have tried to leapfrog your guild into Fear to get Magi for Fenren?  And if Fenren had asked, which he didn't, that would have been pointed out to him.  I think he knew better than to ask us to try to rush ahead of you all to get him the piece.  As for not noticing him up, well I have npc spells off if I'm on any character other than my enchanter.<br>
<br>
The other side topic I want to point out is to Strad or however you spell his name.  That vox or naggy raid, shesh get over it already.  Those 55+ players were there the whole raid, buffed the 55- characters and helped them to get the dragon.  They were there for teleports, tps, rezes and buffs after the raid.  The exception of them being in on the lottos was announced and agreed on by all.  They did just as much work to get to the mob and make killing the mob a success as did the -55 players.  Yes, I was there.<br>
<br>
Last but not least, I have learned one thing in this whole mess....  I like Ketal!!!  She's just the bees knees!<br>
<br>
My opinions are my own, this will be my only post, I will not debate this topic.  I believe we should all agree to disagree and move on.<br>

Although it wouldn't have been what I would have done, we are all different and see things in different ways.  I will admit that imo Fenren had no basis to complain to start with because <br>
<br>
1.  This was his first XA raid<br>
and<br>
2.  He was not in the XA channel<br>
<br>
However, I will agree with Rukog that the clearing the Seb Frogs or clearing the path to Vindi is not a good analogy because it is a TOTALLY different situation.<br>
<br>
But like I said, we are all different and cannot agree upon everything.  I have been on frustrating XA raids and I have also been on frustrating HKD raids, in the same light, I have been to GREAT raids from both HKD and XA.<br>

When the raid started, I spammed my &quot;Raid Rules&quot; which is something I do on raids. I always do it because we almost always have new people-- many of whom come, get an item, and are never seen again. Rule number 2 stated very specifically to *not* ask me (the puller) if we were going to pull a specific MOB. I don't care what is up or where it is. This raid was a learning raid, and I was going to pull whatever I felt like pulling. The only persons who had any vote in the matter were Taleriana and Torcha who, due to their greater knowledge, were actually trying to get me to pull the Magi when we had only 45 minutes left. Raid wipe or not, though, it wasn't going to happen. We didn't have the time. I'm sure there were other demis up, but it's all moot-- our raid wasn't going to do them. If nothing else, Fenren was following the raid rules. I am completely willing to assume Fenren never saw the Magi casting messages, and I'm completely willing to assume he didn't see us declare his existance in the raid channel. It seems the mostly likely assumption. I declared to the raid that the Magi was up (I had no idea he had anything to do with the Mage epic) immediately after we cleared the entry room. I said this because I hear him casting (so I assume he was near-- I was wrong).<br>
<br>
---I agree 100% with Delt. I think Fenren assumed that both raids conspired. I say that because it's a totally believable assumption. However, when the situation was explained to Fenren, he realized the error, and he's a big enough man to apologize. The discussion should be over, because there's nothing to discuss. It's PRIDE that continues this discussion. Some people have dirtied their face and they don't have the humility to step back. As the thread(s) continue, the liklihood of them stepping back decreases. If anyone has been wronged, it is XA and SS, who are now the butt of a smear campaign. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.premiernet.net/~chandler/images/newmaclogo.gif"><BR>

<br>
Then, after clearing the majority of the way to the Mage, they then find out the raid is being called and another guild is now coming up to finish it up and kill the mage and NOW, the staff is no longer to be rolled on but, is to be defaulted to someone who wasn't even there to help clear the way.<br>
<br>
Yes, I would have been very pissed also.<br>
<br>
I have hunted with XA and I have hunted a lot with HKD. I stopped hunting with XA as this isn't the first time an incident like this has occured. At least when I hunt with HKD, I know I will get a fair shot at something AND, I know up front what the deal is and what will default to which member.<br>
<br>
So, the problem lies with what was told in the beginning to the raiders and what actually happened. They were told they would get a shot at the roll for the staff. Then they were told, oh, we going to end this early and another guild is coming to kill the Demi and take his staff.<br>
<br>
It just made the XA leaders and SS look very bad in a lot of people's eyes. I can see where they refer to this as an IC move because it's something IC would do.<br>

Yes I am an officer, and almost all of our officers were online that night, whoever tried to contact one of us is lying to you<br>
 <br>
<br>
On one of our private boards, I compared getting into this arguement with the old high school trick of putting a burning bag of dog poo on someone's porch.  I advised against stomping on it, since all it would accomplish is spreading the flames and getting our shoes stinking.<br>
<br>
There are times I really regret being right.  (Though I'm still addicted to "I told you so."   )<br>
<br>
*I* am the officer who Fenren first told about this mess.  I immediately did a /who all Deltanamos, found out what guild he was in, did a /who all "Soul Survivors" and found 20 in South Ro with the list cut off.  Please note that Fenren had just gated from the raid; I'm quite impressed with SS' abilities to muster 20+ people to a zone for port up to a raid in less than five minutes.  Even if SS was just ending an event in DN as was claimed elsewhere, just finishing off whatever they were fighting, ensuring that every group had a porter, and casting the port to SRo in less than five minutes is well timed - assuming no prior notice.<br>
<br>
I scrolled up my chat window and found someone in SRo who was not likely to be too involved in buffing - a warrior.  I sent a /tell asking for the name of a SS officer and was told, word for word, "#### off."  I put this marvel of intelligent conversation on /ignore and sent two other /tells to randomly selected people in the zone; one didn't reply at all, the other said "we don't have officers."  A guild without officers - how novel.  At this point I decided that further attempts to have a meaningful dialogue with SS was unlikely to bear fruit and contacted Slyde.<br>
<br>
So, Deltamamos - assuming you read this - you just called ME a liar.  Directly.  After my run-ins with you when we were both in our mid-teens, I can't say I'm surprised - the quiet enchanter off to one side may not have made an impression on you, but I assure you that you surely made an impression on me.  But I don't have anything to prove to you; if the gods are kind, I don't have to have anything to do with you unless I have the ill luck to be traveling through the Nexus at the same time.  <br>
<br>
However, I'd like my guildmembers to know who the hypothetical guild officer that you label a liar is; they know me well, and are the best judge of my veracity.<br>
<br>
Well, now that flaming paper bag is all over the boards, I'm going to go wipe dog poo off my shoes.<br>

Lets see, We Don't have 20 members, and we haven't had our list cut off in How long? 6 months? =P Its amazing how 5 minutes in reality was whaT? 20? and we also took about 40 minutes to get the stones anyway. DN? nope.. That would be Acrylia Caverns.. We we're halfway through the High Priest Ring when we found out the XA raid was called. We finished, got to the zone, Then our ONE! Druid Ported us to Sro.. and not to mention a few others who couldn't stay to wherever they wanted.  The Warrior who this person is talking about, I'm pretty sure that would be Burgh, and I Know he did NOT tell you to #### off as it was put. He also sent a tell right after that saying "Ivyfoote". And I'd like to know who said we don't have any officers? So you contacted Mr. Slyde who decided to do nothing but Flame us on 5 seperate Boards. Is there more? Who knows. I've only seen 5 so far =P. As far as I can see, This person is A Liar. Or has been Misinformed about every single detail possible.<br>
<br>
But, I think we're done with this subject. Nothing more can be said, We've gone over and over it again and again. Delt got his epic piece, which some of you believe happened because we took advantage of XA's raid and our knowledge that the magi was up and had the staff. Some of you believe that Deltanamos doesn't fit your Ideal of a XA leader and he just abused his power to get his staff. Fine, Believe that. Its Not like any HKD member has had anything to do with XA since it became completely public anyway. <br>
<br>
Oh and Like I said. We are in Cahoots with XA and IC. Its all a conspiracy. We had it all planned out. We are here just to screw others over. What seems to have happened and what you seem to think happened are two completely different things than to what actually happened.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The flaming back in forth is doing both of us no Good. Its getting us nowhere. So I'm locking this thread. If you want to Discuss it further, Send me a tell in Game or email me at footeiceblade@hotmail.com. Or Talk to Deltanamos. Its best to get this off of the Boards now before It gets worse than it already is.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Good Luck to you, House of Kel`Dar. <p><P><center>
