A brave young lad he was, treading over territory that would put the fear on most of his young stature.  Through Karana's he marched, dodging hungry beasts, diseased beasts, powerful beasts.  'Twas when Galadria and I came across him we decided it be best for his survival that he accompany us.  Especially considering he was planning a little trip through Highpass Hold, a place he did not know well.  As we all know, to get lost in there and stumble across gnolls can be ag rave mistake, especially for one in his 10th season.  Heck, the even beat my dwarven carcass back on our first attempt through.<br>
<br>
Galadria and I saw the fire in his eyes.  The gratitude was there, but more so a spirit for adventure and companionship that outweighed the dangers of the land.  His bravery is true friends, he was prepared to make that trip on his own.<br>
<br>
After getting to know him better Galadria and I conferred and agreed he would make a fine member of Victus Fortis.<br>
<br>
Then, something impressive happened that drove the decision home.<br>
<br>
While in Timorous Deep on my way to meet Kegdawen for a honey mead and some parlay (planning to invite him as a suprise) disaster struck the Wraithlore family yet again.  Another of us stocky folk somehow managed to find a hole in the bottom of a boat.  Next thing I knew I was swimming.<br>
<br>
I informed the young lass that he might want to go about his business as I would be a while finding some land.  Now me brother Warnin is greatly renowned for his master swimming abilities, and until this day I did not rival his stroke in the least.  I think now I may challenge him to a race around Faydwer.  Alas, I digress.  'Tis not a shallow place, Tim Deep, nor is it warm.  Me little bones were chilled and I was nearly out of steam.  I thought I may be a drownin' soon when I found that this young lass was somewhat of a cartographer (he went to his other computer and d-loaded a map).  Over the next bit of time, could have been a day (40-60mins RL), my young friend sat patiently communicating to me which direction I should go, correcting my course, and making sure I got safely to the elven outpost.<br>
<br>
I was more convinced than I ever was before.  As Kegdawen spent much time guiding me from certain death.<br>
<br>
I knew moments after we met Kegdawen that he would be an excellent member, and I have faith in Brell that he will be one of our most honored and brave members.<br>
<br>
Please welcome Kegdawen in grand fashion!!!<br>

What Ferrum didn't know at the time, is that when he found me in North Karana, that I had just completed my second corpse run and was only making about two steps at a time between hiding episodes, trying to not be noticed yet again by those very hungry, rabid griffons.  That's when I met Kemie and Ferrum.  Had it not been for them, I'd probably be on another corpse run right now rather than writing this.  Before meeting Ferrum, Kemie, Galadria, Inouva, Weewar, (Forgive me if I have left anyone out - there are more, but my memory doesn't serve me well with meeting so many new people at once) I had not even thought about, nor desired a guild family.  However, the fellowship that you all share gave me a warm feeling.  I watched in awe as I was protected, and my guts spared, time and time again.  I wondered what I might be able to do to repay the kindness and acquire that type of bravery.  I wanted to be a part of their world.  I have my suspicions that perhaps Tunare, Mother of All, intervened on that most deadly day on the Plains of Northern Karana, by guiding me into the path of &quot;Victus Fortis&quot;.  She must have been tired of seeing so much of my blood on the outside, where it has nay business.  I now have a feeling that I belong to a family again.  Not since I was a wee elf, have I experienced such joy.  Even greater so now.  You see, when I left Kelethin and my beloved Greater Faydark at a tender young age.  I had been forced to collect bat wings to feed our humble family.  (Kelethin has no child labor laws)  My father was a drunkard and only a half-rate ranger and warrior.  He spent too much of his time wandering the land, away from his family.  It left me very distraught.  Who would teach me the ways of becoming a great ranger?  One day, a stranger in the wood asked me if I would like to go with him and see the world.  I hesitated, but the very next moment, I found myself in a strange land far away.  I explored there for a while, but soon after was again swept away to a strange new land far to the north.  I ended up in the frozen land of the Barbarians, who must have thought me some type of pet, always reaching down and patting me on the head.  But while their skins were cold, their hearts were warm.  I stayed for a while there and grew to be a better ranger and fighter than my father ever was.  I even learned to best him at the bottle as well as the sword.  Once when I ventured south to Qeynos, I had heard that my father was as near as Freeport, a city that I had briefly encountered in my earlier journey.  I suspect that he had made many a stop along the way, if you know what I mean.  I have seen too many elves that look too much like me to believe that his journey was ever lonely.  I digress.  I finally thought it time to again venture out and see the world, only by foot this time rather than the strange and mystical ways of the strangers that I had met once before.  It was in this walk about, that I wandered into Northern Karana, which brings us here...<br>
I thank you again for the welcome and I am truly honored to be a part of this wonderful new family.  I look forward to meeting you all.<br>

<br>
Kemie well remembers that day when first she met you, answering a call for binding from the gypsy camp in North Karana. Ferrum and she arrived to find you and another whose name escapes me (a chance stranger once seen and not again) and moments later the stranger had fallen in the attack of a rabid griffene, and Kemie herself was beset and fell victim to the vicious beast. I do not know yet how Ferrum survived to drag her corpse to the wizard rings, but when she and he returned to the camp there was little Kegdawen living still, smart enough to hide tho he was surely quivering, and brave enough to stay the course.<br>
<br>
What could either Kemie or Ferrum do but see such a courageous soul to Highpass? Why, even on that journey through East Karana when Ferrum encountered a beast bent on hindering us, the child was determined to lend assistance even though to do so jeapordized the protective invisibility she had cast upon him. We were forced to leave him in Highpass Hold that night, but the day following, Kegdawen braved the shadowy evil of Kithicor Forest all alone and crossed the Ocean of Tears to return to Greater Faydark, and fought with Weewar and Elwoodd in the infamous VF Crushbone raid.<br>
<br>
I spoke several times with Kegdawen afterwards by the way, learning of his wistful interest in joining this great guild. I had not heard from him for some little time and was wondering what had become of him, and am truly pleased to hear of his sweet rescue of Fearless Ferrum and all the rest, and to have him one of the family.<br>
