          <p>This guide is written as a general discourse over the strengths and
          weaknesses of playing a cleric. These are the opinions of one, so you
          may choose to play your cleric differently. This is the path that I
          have chosen for myself and offer it to hopefully better the community
          of healers. Keep in mind that a lot of what I say is over the length
          of a lifespan of a cleric, beyond the first 20 levels, and sometimes
          beyond the first 50 levels.</p>
          <p>Please do not use any part of this guide without the consent of the
          writer. I’ll probably give it out to openly, but do give credit
          where it’s due.</p>
          <p><b>Creating a Cleric</b><br>
          This topic has been done to death. To summarize, first and foremost,
          wisdom is the attribute from which your mana is based. Though it
          doesn’t impact you as much in the lower levels, by the time you
          reach level 50 and beyond, each point of wisdom represents
          approximately 10 points of mana. Keep in mind, however, that that rate
          of mana to wisdom gain caps at 200. Beyond that primary attribute,
          your physical attributes (most importantly strength and agility) are
          most beneficial at the lower levels. Agility will help you dodge which
          is useful, but since our skill in dodge does cap out, you won’t be
          dodging nearly as often as your melee-class friends.</p>
          <p>What race of a cleric should you be? In the long run, I don’t
          think it really matters. With the amount of equipment that you can get
          in your later levels, your stats can be as good as any other race. But
          by far the most popular cleric race is dwarven followed by the elven
          races.
          <p><b>What is a cleric?</b><br>
          A cleric is fundamentally a healer. We heal better than anybody else,
          hands down. In addition to having a larger repertoire of heals spells
          to draw upon, clerics have a 15% bonus in their healing. But that is
          simply the textbook definition of what we can do. We also offer a
          variety of buffs that can keep a tank slashing and bashing longer than
          anybody else. With an array of stuns at our disposal we can bring a
          mob to its knees as it gets beat upon. We do have some limited ability
          to do direct damage to Undead as well as living, but that should not
          be what clerics should focus upon.</p>
          <p>As a cleric, you really aren’t a front line player. Though a
          cleric can wear a full suit of platemail, the cleric will find himself
          sitting down and meditating during battles. Though your god has
          blessed you with the power to smite down those you feel are unfitting,
          smite does little compared to the raw abilities of mana/damage output
          of a wizard.</p>
          <p>Being bound with a weaker set of offensive abilities, clerics tend
          to not do as well when left to fend for themselves against the harsh
          world of Norrath. In a group is where the cleric is at home. Clerics
          often will bark orders to groups in earlier levels since he is
          directly connected to the lifeline of a group. He is always watching
          the battle from behind the wall of his spell book, but nonetheless
          just as involved. Ensuring that others will survive their battles is a
          cleric’s call.</p>
          <p>A cleric is one of the classes that takes skill to play and an
          incredible amount of patience. Clerics have an incredible of array of
          spells where many require practice. Learning timing and pace of battle
          is absolutely critical to a cleric’s success.</p>
          <p><b>What makes a cleric absolutely critical beyond level 39?</b><br>
          Many clerics find some hardships in levels before their 30s. First
          off, the perception is that any priest class heals as well as others.
          In addition, we lack the utility spells that many people focus on
          (Spirit of Wolf, for example). However, into the 30s people begin to
          realize that nobody can rival the cleric in pure healing. With a good
          warrior, their HP can and will exceed 2000 buffed. A 300 point heal
          will hardly make a dent in heavy fire. With Complete Heal, clerics
          become exceptionally efficient and few groups will travel without one.</p>

          <i>Clerics wear the cleanest armor around.</i></p>
          <p>There’s a reason why a cleric’s armor remains well polished. A
          cleric doesn’t like to get hit. Though we have the strength to don
          the heaviest of armor, clerics by no means can withstand the damage
          that a warrior or a paladin can. That’s not to say that clerics
          should never join in a battle. There are always exceptions to every
          rule. Of all the caster classes, the cleric has the highest armor
          class. If necessary, a cleric can stand between a raging monster and a
          robed caster. With more hit points, you can take a few more hits
          buying your casters enough time to get off that Ice Comet that will
          turn the tide of battle. Of course, don’t be stupid. Don’t get
          yourself killed. Do this only when absolutely necessary.</p>
          <p>A cleric can wield most blunt weapons. However, our skill advances
          at a much slower rate than any of the melee classes at 4 points per
          level. Also, our skill caps out at 175. Without any other offensive
          skill (such as double attack), by late levels you are not even 35% as
          effective offensively as a paladin wielding the same weapon. In the
          early levels (less than 12), indeed the cleric will often bring down
          his hammer upon his opponents, but that will not be the way of the
          cleric as he gains in his career. By the late levels even using the
          Warhammer of Divine Grace, a cleric may only end up doing 300-400
          damage in melee to a mob that has 5000+ HP. If by level 40 the group
          is depending on you to melee a mob to death, there is something
          seriously wrong with that group. You are much better off spending the
          time on meditating for more mana.</p>
          <p>Many clerics have even accepted the fact that they will not
          actually enter into physical combat and will carry a shield in one
          hand and a Paw of Opolla (or in Kunark there are books that can be
          held in the primary hand) in the other. This actually eliminates any
          ability for the cleric to do physical damage.</p>
          <p>A cleric can do much more damage through his spells. Though not as
          efficient as a druid or even a shaman, it a much better alternative
          when there is mana to spare.</p>

          Cleric will realize his ultimate potential when gathered among his
          friends.</i></p>
          <p>Where a cleric is most at home is within a group. Though clerics
          were plate, they still lack in the defensive skills and powers of any
          melee class. Though clerics are bless with offensive damage skills,
          every other priest and caster class can easily out damage a cleric.
          This is not to say that a cleric is a weak class. Clerics are often
          cast into a support/utilitarian role. As one of the more specialized
          classes, it is more important to know how to work with other classes.</p>
          <p>First, a cleric’s mana is the lifeblood of any group. If the
          group’s puller runs off before the cleric is comfortable with the
          amount of mana at his reserve, then the cleric must say something.
          Though clerics will meditate between fights, this will often not be
          enough to cast two or three heals that would have been available had
          the puller waited one extra minute.</p>
          <p>When mana begins to reach critical levels, often a cleric will have
          to decide who lives and who doesn’t. This is by far the hardest
          decision for a cleric. If everyone is out of mana, casters die first.
          This may seem like a shock to some, but if the fight is getting close,
          an OOM caster is little more than a mana drain. Your tank will still
          be able to continue to deliver damage regardless of their mana. At the
          point where the fight has turned so poorly, your fellow casters should
          also be considering either evacuating or gating away anyway. Unless
          OOM, a cleric will most often be around until the last person leaves
          since a cleric can always cast gate himself or be able to run away
          with a casting of Divine Aura.</p>
          <p>There are exceptions to what is stated before, but these are
          suggestions, not rules. For example, an enchanter is always somebody
          that a cleric wants alive. Enchanter’s key ability is to buy a group
          time to deal with each mob individually. Warriors also have many
          hundreds of hit points more than a caster. Leaving the warrior at 2
          bubbles to heal the wizard and then meditating might still be enough
          time to get back to the warrior before he is dead.</p>
          <p>The key skill above is mana management. A cleric must always know
          how many heals he has with the amount of mana at his reserve. At the
          same time, a cleric must learn to watch the rate of hit points
          dropping in relationship to the amount of time required to cast a
          spell and meditate enough mana. This becomes a critical skill when the
          cleric receives Complete Healing. Learning how quickly a warrior’s
          hit points will drop in 10 seconds will be the difference between a
          full health warrior and a dead warrior.</p>
          <p>A good cleric will keep his group apprised of his mana, more
          specifically how many heals he can provide. Most often clerics will
          say to the group, “30%.” This may be fine when a cleric is at 80%
          where the mana is being used for rooting, or stunning, or fearing.
          This is not fine when a cleric is in the heat of a battle with 30%
          mana. It is not the responsibility of the warrior to know what 30%
          translates into. Depending on your wisdom and your total overall
          amount of mana, this can mean one SHeal or one Divine Light and one
          Remedy. A cleric should tell groups how many heals are left because
          when it is truly important, that is the only spell that will be cast.</p>
          <p>Because a cleric’s mana represents the life of the group, many
          clerics do not loot often sitting back down immediately after a fight.
          A cleric is equally entitled to the same loot as everybody else. It
          only takes a few seconds to loot and as clerics level, reagents become
          much more expensive. Many clerics will loot more than the rest of the
          group since they need to cover the cost of reagents. A cleric should
          not be shy to what he is deserved.</p>
          <p>Working with another cleric can be the best thing or the worst
          thing to happen to a cleric. Unless a system is established early on,
          confusion between clerics can lead to wasted mana or even death. There
          are many things to consider with multiple clerics.</p>
          <p>First, buffing. This is a task best spread out among multiple
          clerics. This will prevent anybody bearing the full responsibilities.
          Since the take on mana is distributed, the efficiency is always higher
          since clerics are all regenerating mana. This is provided that all the
          casting of buffs can be shared. If one cleric is sufficiently higher
          in level, it does not behoove the group to have less than optimal
          buffs.</p>
          <p>Second, healing. This is where most confusion lies. There are
          multiple systems that work. These examples are based on a two-cleric
          group.
          <ul>
            <li>Division of labor. Each cleric will heal two people in addition
              to the other cleric. Each cleric is then allowed for some mana to
              cast alternate spells such as DD’s, or stuns, or roots. The
              downside to this system is that both clerics have to be actively
              watching health bars, leaving less attention to the mobs being
              attacked. Also if Cleric A is busy healing his warrior, but his
              caster’s hp’s are dropping quickly, Cleric B may not know
              whether or not the situation is under control.</li>
            <li>Primary and secondary. Cleric A is primary healer, and Cleric B
              is secondary healer. This is the most common system in place.
              Cleric A behaves as he normally does regardless of the fact that
              there is another cleric in the group. Cleric B reserves half of
              his mana for healing. As Cleric A becomes stressed, Cleric B steps
              forward and picks up the slack. The key to making this system work
              is to for Cleric B to call out who he’s healing. The benefits to
              this system allow for Cleric B to cast his alternate spells.
              However, this causes more of a discrepancy between mana levels of
              the clerics and puts more of a dependency on Cleric A and his mana.
              A good way to solve some of these problems and reduce down time is
              for Cleric B (assuming he has more mana) to play primary healer
              for the next fight while Cleric A meditates so he can re-assume
              his original role.</li>
            <li>Call it out. This is probably the most inefficient system, but
              should be a part of any system. Since Cleric B will never know
              exactly what Cleric A is doing (casting, interrupted, etc), good
              communication can solve that problem. Each cleric heals as he sees
              fit as long as he calls out who he is healing. To make this system
              work, each cleric must not go crazy by casting alternate spells.
              Each cleric should reserve at least 50% mana for healing. This is
              the most flexible system, but allows for the highest margin of
              error and confusion.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The key to success in any group, regardless of make up, is
          communication. A group should generally be aware of each others mana.
          When somebody needs help, it should be cried out earlier than later.</p>

          <i>Within this tomb lies great power.</i></p>
          <p>For the first 34 levels of a cleric’s career, he is forced to
          stare at the spell book during meditation. Considering how a cleric
          meditates through most battles, this is not very acceptable to many
          people. However, this is a great time to learn group management. Since
          a cleric must watch very closely his own mana bar and the health of
          his mates, having to stare at the spell book does give him some
          advantages for battle management. He can evaluate when a situation is
          turning for the worse since he knows how much health he can restore
          with the mana reserves he has. Without visual distraction, a cleric
          can watch the flow of battle much more analytically. A cleric tends to
          remain much calmer in battle since they are not completely caught up
          in the excitement. A cleric tends to read the majority of the text
          area while meditating while tanks and other casters look down
          occasionally just for their own key bits of information. A cleric will
          know who’s casting what when.</p>
          <p>Indeed staring at the spell book is not an entirely pleasing
          experience. However, using this time to hone the skills of watching a
          battle without actually being in battle will have many great rewards
          down the road.</p>

          <i>The best puller is an invincible puller.</i></p>
          <p>Many clerics enjoy playing the role of a puller for a group. Though
          in many situations clerics are ill suited for this task, there are a
          few tools at the cleric’s disposal that help it perform this task:
          high armor class, lull, and divine aura. Though clerics may not be the
          strongest fighters, clerics do wear exceptionally strong armor. Having
          a high armor class helps reduce both the number of hits taken and the
          amount of damage taken. The lull series of spells is almost always
          used only for pulling. Having these spells helps a cleric be able to
          separate out mobs to reduce the number of incoming targets. Divine
          Aura and Divine Barrier are shields of invulnerability. Even though
          they work as a negative taunt, if pulling, a cleric is the only one on
          their hate list. The mob will more than likely continue to chase the
          cleric but unable to do any damage to him. 18 seconds should most
          often be enough time to get back to the group.</p>

          <p><a NAME="specialization"></a><font SIZE="3"><b>Specialization</b></font><br>
          Casting spells is not a trivial task.</p>
          <p>At level thirty clerics gain the ability to specialize in a circle
          of magic. Assuming the roll against specialization is successful,
          specialization will reduce the amount of mana that is required to cast
          the spell. Keep in mind that the specialization check is against the
          amount of required mana before the roll against specialization is
          made. For example, even if specialization will reduce the required
          mana by 15%, a 600 mana spell will require that the cleric has 600
          mana before casting. But it will leave him with 90 mana.</p>
          <p>Though debatable, I personally feel that specialization has some
          effect on my ability to recover from interrupts. I can cast heals
          having been beat upon by many more mobs than I can with an offensive
          spell.</p>
          <p>The only three for consideration is Alteration, Abjuration, and
          Evocation. Alteration is used for healing, gating, and resurrections.
          Abjuration is used for all buffing. Evocation is used to deal damage.</p>
          <p>Alteration is by far the most common choice for clerics. Alteration
          summarizes what a cleric spends most of his time doing… healing.
          Alteration reduces the amount of mana that is required to heal and
          therefore will give you more heals in the long run.</p>
          <p>Abjuration, though useful, is really only used during down time,
          the time between battles. Though it does reduce the mana used for all
          buffs, most clerics feel it is more important to have mana in an
          emergency rather than when the group is sitting around.</p>
          <p>Evocation is the other popular choice for clerics. Many clerics
          have chosen the path of battle. This is a good choice for them since
          it makes cleric damage spells slightly more efficient. However, choose
          this specialization carefully. In the heat of a battle you may not
          have the extra heal that may save the group from an untimely death.</p>
          <p>To choose a specialization, a cleric simply has to ensure their
          chosen specialization passes 50 points of skill. Though a cleric must
          train in all fields of specialization, only one field may surpass a
          skill of 50.</p>
          <p>Specialization can be reset back to 50 in the Temple of Solusek Ro,
          if one feels they have chosen the wrong specialization.</p>

          <p>With undead DD spells at their disposal, many clerics believe that
          they are the supreme destroyed of the undead. This is not a good
          assumption. First off, this line of spells is shared with the
          Necromancer. Between their larger array of spells on top of the undead
          DD spells, they can take down undead many times faster than a cleric.
          What clerics do have is a highly mana efficient line of DDs against
          undead. Banish Undead’s damage/mana ratio is approximately 2.6 with
          a relatively descent casting time and cycles almost instantly. This
          can be an important asset since this means that the cleric can also
          double as a major damage contributor in any group. However, unlike
          wizards or many other casters that primarily focus on damage output we
          have other tasks at hand that require a lot of our attention (and mana)
          as well. A poor cleric will expend all of his mana on nuking a mob
          leaving little to no mana left for the healing of his team. If a
          cleric spent all of his mana taking down a mob, what will happen to a
          group while they are recovering from the rigors of a battle and a
          spawn drops right on top of them? If a cleric can’t keep a group
          alive, he is not a good cleric. (I’ll be beating this point into the
          reader’s head throughout this guide.)</p>
          <p>A similar line of spells to our undead spells is our ability to
          cast against summoned creatures. We get these spells about one or two
          circles after our undead spells so they really aren’t efficient at
          the level that we receive them. At times they are more efficient than
          the general-purpose damage spells, but overall, they tend to not be
          used as often as a cleric’s undead and general-purpose damage
          spells.</p>
          <p>Strike, Furor, Smite, Wrath, Retribution, and Reckoning are the
          clerics’ line of dealing damage to any mob, living or undead. These
          spells as they grow in strength and efficiency, they grow in casting
          time. By the time of acquiring Reckoning, the casting time is 7.0
          seconds with a higher efficiency than Banish Undead. This entire of
          line of spells suffers from a relatively poor casting time. After
          casting, each spell has approximately two to three seconds before it
          cycles back into use again. As previously stated, it is an useful
          spell, but not one that should be used to sway battles. Putting the
          same 250 mana into healing can be used to keep the tank alive long
          enough to out do the damage that a cleric could’ve done directly.</p>
          <p>In a typical fight will I keep a DD mem’d? Or even cast it? The
          answer to both is yes. If I am well over 70% full of mana, then I will
          more often then not elect to throw one or two spells into the fray.
          Though my damage may not be enough to out right kill the mob, it is
          enough to at least make a dent. Besides, if I’m sitting through a
          fight at full mana the entire time, I’m not being completely
          efficient with my mana. Ideally, I’d like to have my mana
          regenerating at all times so I like to stay at a max of about 90% mana.
          After a nuke, I can be at 80% leaving me with plenty of room to work
          my healing magic.</p>

          <i>With a yell, a boom shakes the ground beneath the cleric.</i></p>
          <p>Clerics actually have two separate lines of dealing damage across
          multiple mobs. The first centers about the caster in a point-blank
          range. If you can reach out and touch someone, then they will more
          than likely get hit by this spell. This spell is useful for trying to
          gain some attention from multiple targets onto one’s self, but it is
          one of the many spells that most clerics have deemed to be little more
          than a novelty.</p>
          <p>An alternate area effect spell line, we have inherited from our
          fellow priests, the druids: Tremor, Earthquake, and Upheaval. We
          receive these spells approximately one-spell circle after they do.
          Like the above, this spell series centers about the caster. However,
          these spells have a much larger radius ensuring the likelihood of
          hitting more targets.</p>
          <p>In most AE spells (both offensive and defensive), the point of
          efficiency is three. That is to say that these spells are efficient
          when one can hit three or more targets. For two or one targets, then
          some form of direct spell is optimal; be it healing or dealing damage.</p>

          <p>Stunning is a task that is shared by clerics, paladins, enchanters,
          and wizards. This is one of the more useful lines of spells in a
          cleric’s repertoire. A cleric’s job is to keep his group alive.
          One of the ways of doing so is to prevent damage done to the group.
          Most of the stuns do some form of minimal damage, knocks the mob back
          1 foot, and have a very quick casting time. Though most of the cleric
          stuns do some minimal amount of damage to the mob, the damage is not
          the important attribute of the spell.</p>
          <p>Clerics and Enchanters have the greatest number of stuns available
          to them at any given level. With 4 stuns by level 49, a cleric can
          come close to maintaining a mob completely stunned. Completely
          stunning a mob can begin once the cleric has three stun spells. The
          order of casting always begins with casting the lowest level stun
          first. The lower spells tend to cycle faster. By the time the cleric
          has cast his highest-level stun, the lowest level spell will be
          available at his disposal again. This will also stagger the cycling
          time of each spell. Conversely, had a cleric started casting the
          highest level stun first, there is a much larger amount of time that a
          cleric has to wait to start his stunning cycle again.</p>
          <p>In addition to the obvious benefits of a mob not moving nor
          attacking, the stun will make the mob easier to hit, prevents
          ripostes, dodges, parries, etc. A stun will also interrupt casting.
          This is particularly useful to prevent an AE spell being cast on a
          group (such as dispel).</p>
          <p>The spell also has a knock back factor. This can be dangerous in
          areas with cliffs where the mob maybe pushed over. If it stays pissed
          off, then it will probably bring a few friends along the way.</p>
          <p>The one major caveat to stunning is that it is a major taunt. If
          you are within range, the mob will more than likely very angry at the
          cleric casting the stun.</p>

          <i>Surrounded by the aura of the gods, a cleric stands invulnerable.</i></p>
          <p>Clerics have two “UH OH” spells. Divine Aura and Divine Barrier
          will prevent ANY damage done to caster during the length of the spell
          effect of 18 seconds. (Everything in EQ works on a multiple of a six
          second timer.) Divine Aura casts exceptionally fast (1.0 second) for
          very little mana. From the middle levels on, a cleric can be OOM but
          still actually have enough mana to cast Divine Aura. This is the
          cleric panic button. When one is getting hit and the mobs are not
          getting taunted off quickly enough, DA will first give one a safe
          protective shield and about 2 to 3 ticks of meditation time. Also it
          works as a reverse taunt so the mobs will often leave the cleric
          alone… at least for the duration of the spell. This spell prevents
          any damage done to the cleric but does not prevent stuns. A hard bash
          to a cleric is still enough cause him to stand still for a few
          seconds. One must be very careful with this spell since it shields you
          from damage and spells, it will also prevent beneficial spells as
          well. So if the group is evac’ing, the cleric must drop Divine Aura
          or the gate will leave him behind. In the same vein, heal spells will
          not pass through the protective shielding of Divine Aura either. The
          shielding works both ways, however. A cleric can neither cast spells
          nor attack while invulnerable. Nonetheless, the cleric can run…
          hopefully to the zone.</p>
          <p>Divine Barrier is the only upgrade to Divine Aura. It lasts just as
          long as DA, but suffers from a higher casting time and a ten-fold
          increase in mana. Divine Barrier, however, restores a small amount of
          HP and MP during the period of invulnerability. If a cleric has
          sufficient mana, but needs to cast a reverse taunt, this is the better
          spell. With higher mana usage, it usually means that the cleric is not
          quite panicking yet.</p>
          <p>Both of these spells take approximately 10-15 minutes to cycle.
          That means from the moment that it is memorized, the cleric cannot
          cast it for that length of time. Many clerics have made permanent
          homes for at least Divine Aura if not both spells.</p>
          <p>The classic heroic cleric story usually involves the cleric
          taunting all the mobs on to him, casting DA buying the rest of his
          group enough time to escape. As the spell drops, the cleric
          immediately casts gate to hopefully save his own hide.</p>

          <i>Clerics are the de facto kings of HP &amp; AC buffs.</i></p>
          <p>At certain levels, other casters may have equivalent sometimes
          slightly better HP or AC buffs. This is true. However, consider the
          mana usage. The cleric line, Center, Courage, Bravery, Resolution,
          etc., almost directly parallels a druid’s skin series of spells.
          Until level 52, a cleric’s HP/AC buff spell will not overwrite a
          druid’s Skin spell of an equal level. The benefit of choosing the
          cleric spell over a druid spell (in a group) is mana usage. A
          druid’s skin line costs approximately three times more mana per
          cast. To buff an entire group, a druid will drain himself completely
          of mana where the cleric may have only spent one to two bubbles. In
          the levels beyond fifty, druids find themselves without any more skin
          buffs and must rely on a cleric for Heroism and beyond. At no point
          should the cleric in a group ever let this primary buff drop. It’s
          cheap and exceptionally effective.</p>
          <p>Clerics and Shamans also have a line of pure AC buff spells. It’s
          a bit more questionable whether or not to keep this spell up at all
          times for the entire group. Clerics tend to be a little bit more
          selective about whom to cast this on or they stagger it out. Most
          often, though, a cleric will want to keep this spell up on his tank
          and his enchanter at the very least. The shaman line of AC buffs is
          not quite as powerful as the cleric’s.</p>
          <p>Later in levels, there is a lot of confusion for clerics over the
          advantages of Armor of Faith versus Shield of Words. AoF costs half as
          much as SoW, and the only difference in AC gain is approximately 6 AC.
          The reason why a cleric would use SoW on his group is because it lasts
          about twice as long as AoF. This is a long-term mana saver and a
          better spell. If downtime is a major issue, many clerics cast SoW on
          only a few members of the group while giving AoF to the others.</p>
          <p>For a pure HP buff, clerics have their symbol line of spells. When
          a cleric first receives this spell it offers a slight bonus in HP for
          a relatively cheap gem. Clerics most often only cast symbol on request
          since the costs do add up over time. By the time a cleric reaches 50
          and beyond a symbol spell costs more than 10.5pp. In the beginning, a
          few extra HP might not make a difference, but beyond level 50, 700HP
          can make the difference. Again, shamans also have a line of HP buff
          spells, however, their spells do not add nearly as many HP, but they
          do it without a gem component.</p>
          <p>Clerics also get the full line of resist buffs until level 44 where
          resist spells start becoming more specialized. Enchanters get a group
          magic resist that is more powerful than a cleric’s resist magic.
          Beyond level 50, druids get a group resist line for heat and cold. But
          resists are exceptionally useful when fighting against mobs with
          special effects. A cleric should try and maintain resist magic when he
          can since it’s a relatively cheap spell.</p>

          <i>A cleric is the definition of a healer. He is the spinner of life.</i></p>
          <p>One of the reasons I save this section for later is because this is
          where the bread and butter of the cleric career. Clerics are expected
          to do one thing: keep the group alive. Most often through healing.
          Clerics get all of their heals at least one spell circle before
          anybody else. In addition to having the heal spells earlier, on the
          same spells, clerics get a 15% healing bonus.</p>
          <p>A cleric truly separates himself from his other priestly brethren
          when he reaches level 34. With Superior Healing, a cleric can heal for
          approximately 600HP per cast. The other classes are left with only
          greater healing which only has half that healing potential. Many
          groups at this point will specifically look for a cleric for druids
          and shamans simply don’t have the ability to keep a well-buffed
          warrior fully healed. This is to really pay back for the first 33
          levels when clerics were overlooked for the other classes that have
          Sprit of the Wolf and Snare.</p>
          <p>From level 34 through 50, a cleric will also have both Greater
          Healing and Superior Healing memorized: GHeal for casters and SHeal
          for tanks.</p>
          <p>At level 34 a cleric is also introduced to his first area effect
          heal spell. Like the previous mention of AE spells, Word of Health
          becomes efficient at trying to heal three or more people with Greater
          Healing. Often a cleric will use this spell to cap off the little bit
          of remaining hit points for his group. This spell also casts
          relatively quickly so many clerics have used it in combat as well.</p>
          <p>From levels 39 to 50 will see an upgrade in his AE heal and more
          importantly Complete Heal. Complete Heal changes the dynamics of a
          group a lot. Around 39 and above, a cleric will find that healing a
          fully buffed tank takes 2, 3 or more castings of SHeal. CHeal is mana
          efficient when the target has about 1600 HP or more. This spell also
          takes a fair bit of practice since it takes 10.0 seconds to cast. A
          cleric must be able to judge the rate at which their target’s HP
          will drop and know where they will be 10.0 seconds from the moment he
          starts casting. Also during this time, the cleric must not get hit. If
          this happens, immediately cast a GHeal on your target and switch to
          SHeal. A cleric will end up wasting a bit of mana but it saves him the
          critical time which he needs to get things back under control.</p>
          <p>CHeal requires some practice, which can’t be emphasized enough. I
          won’t give you a certain point for which to cast CHeal because it
          does differ for each occasion. I have started casting it when the
          warrior was at four bubbles of health, and I have started casting it
          when they were below one bubble of health. So practice and learn to
          watch the rate of which your group’s HP falls.</p>
          <p>Beyond level 50 there are two primary heal spells Remedy and Divine
          Light. Remedy replaces both Superior and Greater healing at the same
          time. It is more mana efficient than both and heals more HP/sec than
          either. However, there is the standard spell cycling time of 1 second
          to take into account if one desires to chain cast the spell which is
          not given any consideration. In some cases, clerics still maintain
          SHeal next to the very fast and long range Remedy. Beyond 51, clerics
          look forward to Divine Light. DL has the same casting time as SHeal
          but only costs 50 mana less than CHeal. This spell completely replaces
          SHeal and should be used when the cleric can’t spend 10 seconds
          casting CHeal. At level 59 clerics receive Celestial Elixir which is a
          slightly different line of healing. It heals for a much larger amount
          of HP and cures, however, the HP is restored over time much like a
          regeneration spell.</p>
          <p>At level 44, some clerics have taken to use Resolution as a quick
          way to heal instead of using Greater Healing. When the numbers are
          crunched, the result does lean in favor of using Resolution. However,
          that is not the full story. By level 44, most clerics will have a very
          high specialization in Alteration. The specialization will reduce the
          mana cost of a GHeal, but not that of Resolution. Personally, I have
          seen approximately a saving of approximately 15% in mana in my
          healing. Also the numbers do not include healing bonus of clerics.
          Though it also has yet been proven, I believe that my fizzles as well
          as my interrupts have been greatly reduced due to high skills in
          Channeling, Alteration and Specialize Alteration.</p>
          <p>At Level 56, clerics gain the power to cast Mark of Karn. Casted on
          a mob, each time a player hits this mob, their hit points will be
          restored by a small amount. This is fairly well resisted and may cause
          the mob to aggro on the cleric.</p>

          <i>With a wave of the cleric’s hand, his opponent blinks a few times
          and forgets that he was ever in battle.</i></p>
          <p>This is one spell for which clerics never receive an upgrade.
          Clerics receive Atone at level 34. Atone behaves identically to an
          enchanter’s memory blur series of spells. This allows a cleric to
          reset a mob’s damage history table and clears out its hate list.
          This is a spell with a potential of abuse and ultimate utility.</p>
          <p>Wiping the hate list and damage history does a few things to a mob.
          When awarding kills to a group or person, the system looks at the
          damage history. Whichever group does the majority of the damage, the
          kill is award to them. So if a mob is down to 5% health and the cleric
          casts Atone (and assuming it worked) whoever does the majority of
          damage of the remaining 5% will receive the kill. This can be either a
          good thing or a bad thing. First, it means that if somebody can deal a
          quick amount of damage right after the mob has been Atoned they will
          receive the kill. This is a potential for kill stealing (which is bad,
          bad, naughty, naughty). In the same vein, this can be exceptionally
          useful if a cleric is power leveling somebody else. They are more
          likely to ensure that another group will receive the kill when they
          begin attacking a nearly dead mob.</p>
          <p>Atone can also be used to save lives as well. Mobs will most often
          chase after whoever is doing the most amount of damage to them within
          a short range. Dealt enough damage and a mob may hate a caster so much
          that it may even go beyond its near range. A quick way to get a mob
          off of a caster is to Atone the mob. With a clear hate list, a mob
          will quickly turn to the taunting melees and forget about the caster.</p>
          <p>Root and Atone combined are also a great way to escape. First cast
          a root and get out of sight to cast Atone. A mob will simply forget
          about its targets and wait until the root wears off when it returns
          back to its spawn point or its original path.</p>
          <p>Atone can also be used to quickly dispatch caster pets. When NPC
          casters die, their pets remain on the last target it was on. To save a
          group from the hassle of dealing with a pet, a cleric can simply Atone
          the pet after its master has fallen. With neither a target nor a
          master, the pet will simply suicide.</p>
          <p>Atone has a slight bug in that regardless of its success, it will
          always say that the target has calmed down. The cleric will just need
          to learn to use the con system and visual cues to see if it was a
          success. The con system will display the target’s level of
          aggression. Attacking an indifferent mob will most often cause it to
          glare at the cleric threateningly. Casting Atone and con’ing the mob
          will reveal if the mob has forgotten about the cleric and returned to
          its initial disposition. A rooted mob will also turn towards the
          target it currently hates most (assuming that nobody else is around).
          Usually a successful cast of Atone will cause the mob to turn slightly
          to the direction of its spawn point.</p>

          <p><a NAME="fear"></a><font SIZE="3"><b>Fear</b></font><br>
          <i>Glaring at the monster, the cleric lets loose a cry that causes the
          monster to flee away in terror.</i></p>
          <p>Clerics, necromancers, and enchanters have a great ability to make
          mobs go away. Most often clerics will only use fear in case of
          emergencies. When a mob is feared it will run away from the caster.
          However, should it run by any of its friends, its friends will know
          who feared the mob and come after the caster. This will more than
          likely start trains in any dungeon zone. There are cases where fear
          can be very useful if the caster is ready to deal with the
          consequences, and most often in an outdoor zone where the caster can
          usually be sure of not causing many trains. Fear casts very quickly.
          Fear can be used to drive a mob away so the cleric can get a chance to
          cast a gate spell to safety. In the same vein, an AE fear can be used
          to drive away a large number of mobs, sometimes buying time for an
          evac’er to do his job.</p>
          <p>Clerics have AE fear, undead fear, and general-purpose fear. The
          undead fear is slightly harder to resist and lasts a little bit longer
          and costs fewer mana. The only limiting factor is that it can only be
          cast upon undead.</p>
          <p>In outdoor zones, being paired with either a ranger or a druid, a
          cleric may find himself casting quite a few fear spells. A common
          tactic is to snare a mob and then immediately follow up with a fear
          spell. This tactic has many names, fear kite and snare/fear, for
          example. This is a very powerful combination since a mob will be
          trying to get away, therefore neither attacking nor casting, while the
          tank and the other members of the party are casting and attacking it.
          In addition, damage over time spells work at their maximum efficiency
          when they are trying to run away. This is the reason why necromancers
          are so powerful. They have both a fear spell and snare-type spell at
          their disposal. There is an item available for dark-elven clerics that
          allow them to cast a snare-type spell.</p>

          <i>Calling upon the strength of the land beneath him, the cleric

          <p>Simply put, the root series immobilizes the movement of the target.
          They can still attack and cast spells, however they cannot move from
          their location. Doing damage to a mob will give it a chance to break
          the effects of the spell. Often times casting a direct damage spell on
          a mob will guarantee that the target will break the root.</p>
          <p>Clerics gain four root spells throughout their career. Based off of
          Root, each spell has a slightly better effect. Enstill has the
          potential to last twice as long as root. Immobilize has a faster
          casting time and a potential for a longer duration. Paralyzing Earth
          has the potential to last four times as long as Root. Since the root
          has a potential to break when the mob takes damage, Immobilize and
          Paralyzing Earth are most useful for rooting a mob and keeping it out
          of the way. Root and Immobilize are much better during combat or when
          a mob is trying to run away.</p>

          the same way. They each reduce the target’s aggression radius such
          that you can pull a mob that is standing next to them or even walk
          past without them going aggro on a PC. The puller when trying to
          separate out multiple mobs in a close local area will most often use
          this spell. This spell gets resisted fairly often, and there are two
          effects when it gets resisted. One, nothing happens. When the puller
          tags a target, the “lulled” mob will come with the target mob. The
          other resisted result will aggro the mob and its surrounding friends.</p>

          <i>Hovering over the corpse, the cleric prays to his deity to restore
          the life of the fallen.</i></p>
          <p>Clerics, paladins, and necromancers are the only class able to
          restore life to a corpse. However, clerics do it better than the other
          two classes. Paladins inherit our spells many levels after clerics do
          so by the time a paladin can cast a certain resurrection, a cleric
          will have a better resurrection at the same level. Necromancers can
          restore life to a corpse only at the cost of a death of another
          high-level character. Many clerics have found themselves hiding in
          anonymity because this is a highly sought after service at high
          levels.</p>
          <p>All resurrection spells will cause resurrection effects that reduce
          health by 60%, reduced attributes. These effects go away over time.
          There is currently no way to remove those effects. Players with
          resurrection effects cannot have a strength buff cast on them while
          under the effects.</p>
          <p>Players who duel can be resurrected back to their corpse for up to
          6 minutes after the conclusion of the duel. On most servers and in
          most situations, no experience is lost when killed by a player so a
          revive will often suffice to bring the player back to his corpse.</p>
          <p>All of the spells will bring the player to their corpse regardless
          of distance or location. These spells are particularly useful when
          their melee classes have fallen but their homeport is far away. Revive
          only returns a player to their corpse even though a message may
          display that some experience was restored. Resuscitate restores
          approximately 25% of the lost experience. Resurrection restores
          approximately 80% of the lost experience. Reviviscence restores up to
          96% of lost experience.</p>
          <p>By design each corpse can only receive an experience restoring
          resurrection once. Therefore, going link dead after somebody has
          casted a resurrection spell is a bad idea. All of the spells are also
          bound by a 2-hour limit. That is to say, a corpse may only have
          resurrection cast upon it within two hours of playtime after death.
          Playtime includes time spent on the character selection screen and
          time spent playing another character. Beyond that limit, a message
          will display telling you that the corpse is too old and cannot be
          resurrected.</p>

          <i>The cleric summons forth a guardian that will save him from certain

          <p>A new spell series from Kunark, Death Pact and Divine Intervention
          have the potential to save the target from certain death. Cast as a
          buff and lasting approximately 10 minutes, when the target gets
          sufficiently low in health, the target will have a chance to complete
          the death pact. If successful, the target will gain a substantial
          percentage of hit points. The only caveat to this spell is the cost of
          the reagent and the short time span that it lasts. This spell is best
          cast upon a puller and an enchanter who both fulfill high-risk roles.</p>
