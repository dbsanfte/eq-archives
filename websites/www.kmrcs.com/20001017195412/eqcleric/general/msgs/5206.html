Was just wondering whether the armor that is obtained by completing the quests in the Temple of Solusek Ro is worth the "trouble" or effort that is required to get them.  <p>Boots... are they really better than...say DWB's?  <br>Gauntlets... are they better than wearing Charred Gauntlets?<p>Some thoughts from people who have completed these quests would be very helpful for me in determining how to better use my time.  <p>Thanks in advance.<p>Akara Kinslayer<br>Cleric of Bristlebane
