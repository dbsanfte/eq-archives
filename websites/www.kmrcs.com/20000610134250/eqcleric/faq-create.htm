            <p><b>Introduction<br>
            </b><br>
            In Everquest, a game focusing on grouping together with your fellow
            adventurers, a cleric is the most sought after and important part of
            a good group.&nbsp; A Cleric's specialty is healing and, in all of
            Norrath, we have&nbsp; no equal.&nbsp; We are essential to a group
            at high levels and a great benefit to a group at any level.&nbsp;
            With the benefit to a group that we provide, we also rely on
            grouping more than most classes out there.&nbsp; It is very
            difficult to solo your way into the mid levels as many melee
            classes, necros, wizards, druids, shaman and mages can.&nbsp; This
            is also in your favor, as you will find out who you like and who you
            don't earlier in your &quot;life&quot; than the classes that
            primarily solo.<br>
            <br>
            We are not limited in the armor we can wear, as &quot;pure
            casters&quot; are, but we are limited in the weapons we can use.&nbsp;
            We are limited to blunt weapons only (one handed and two handed
            blunt).&nbsp; We also get higher melee skills than the pure casters,
            but lower than the pure melee classes or hybrids.<br>
            <br>
            Now, I'm going to dispel some myths from the beginning.&nbsp; We
            don't even come close to the amount of damage that the melee classes
            can put out with a weapon, which will make us very much like the
            pure casters at higher levels.&nbsp; There are a few reasons for
            this.&nbsp; The first reason is that our melee skills are not as
            good as that of a warrior, ranger, paladin, shadow knight, rogue or
            bard, although they are not that far off.&nbsp; Another reason that
            clerics are not a melee contributor at higher levels is that there
            are no blunt weapons that produce the amount of damage necessary to
            take down monsters over level 30.&nbsp; The biggest reason that we
            don't deal out the necessary damage is that we do not get dual wield
            or double attack.&nbsp; Combine this with the fact that the only
            defensive ability we get (dodge) caps out at good, and we end up
            hitting for 19 while the monsters are hitting us for 35-100 with
            multiple attacks.&nbsp; Not a good thing, however, this is to your
            advantage, trust me.&nbsp; The higher level monsters HATE healers
            (just like we hate monsters that heal), adding to their hate list by
            doing damage to them is not in your best interest.<br>
            <br>
            You will eventually become part of the &quot;back row&quot; who do
            not engage in melee, but stand back and cast spells while letting
            the melee classes keep the various critters off you.&nbsp; Until you
            reach that level, however, you will be engaging in melee, casting DD
            spells, healing, buffing, stunning, rooting, and anything else you
            can to take down those monsters.<br>
            <br>
            With that said, let's look at some options you have for becoming a
            member of the healing elite.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Creating your character</b><br>
            <br>
            There are all kinds of reasons for creating a character a certain
            way.&nbsp; The role-playing aspects of this game are limited only by
            your imagination.&nbsp; The different races have different
            statistics and starting locations, which can be an advantage or a
            disadvantage.&nbsp; We'll look at both the statistics and the
            starting location for evaluating the races, but I must stress that
            you must play a race that you think would be fun.&nbsp; All the
            races that can be a cleric can make good clerics.<br>
            <br>
            Wisdom is the key to being a Cleric.&nbsp; The more wisdom you have
            = the more mana you have, this translates into the more healing you
            can do.&nbsp; It doesn't mean that the race with the most mana is
            best (there are no &quot;winners&quot; or &quot;loosers&quot;), as
            timing of healing and casting of other spells often influence the
            balance of a battle, but wisdom will be the most important statistic
            you have.&nbsp; You can be a good or bad cleric, no matter what race
            you choose.&nbsp; Becoming a good cleric is something you learn.&nbsp;
            There are enough statistic enhancing items out there to (almost)
            make up for any beginning racial statistics you have, becoming a
            good cleric is up to you :)<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>What the statistics mean</b><br>
            <br>
            **Note: there are several large &quot;milestones&quot; where
            increasing a certain statistic will return a proportionately larger
            amount of benefit.&nbsp; The largest noticeable effects are for
            strength, dexterity, agility, and charisma.&nbsp; Mana is not
            effected by these milestones.&nbsp; These milestones are at 75, 100,
            125, 150, and 175.&nbsp; You will see a larger difference in AC if
            you dexterity increases from 74 to 75 than you would if you increase
            dexterity from 75 to 76.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Strength</b>- With higher strength you'll hit harder, you'll hit
            for max damage more often with your weapon, and carry a whole lot
            more.&nbsp; If you dream of one day wearing a full suit of steel
            plate mail, you should have around 85 strength.&nbsp; Most high
            level clerics that can afford a full set, often do not wear all
            steel plate as you generally will have a number of wisdom enhancing
            items that are used in place of the pieces of plate armor.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Stamina</b>- The higher stamina you have the more hit points
            you'll have.&nbsp; You'll also be able to swing your mace/staff
            longer without tiring, and be able to jump or swim longer.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Agility</b>- The higher agility that you have, the less you will
            get hit in combat.&nbsp; This directly effects your armor class
            (AC).<br>
            <br>
            <b>Dexterity</b>- This statistic increases your weapon proficiency
            (you'll hit more often), as well as help decrease the number of
            times you will be interrupted while casting. (<b>ed. note:</b> The
            effect of dexterity on spell interruptions is not supported by the
            game designer in charge of magic at Verant).<br>
            <br>
            <b>Wisdom</b>- High wisdom means more mana.&nbsp; A higher wisdom
            also helps to decrease the chance of you being interrupted while
            casting. (<b>ed. note:</b> The effect of wisdom on spell
            interruptions is not supported by the game designer in charge of
            magic at Verant).&nbsp; It also reduces the chance of failures using
            skills (e.g. jewelcrafting).<br>
            <br>
            <b>Intelligence</b>- Higher intelligence will help you learn skills
            at a faster pace.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Charisma</b>- Charisma affects how NPCs view you (after racial,
            religious, and past history bias).&nbsp; High charisma can help you
            buy items for a lower price or sell items at a higher price (from
            NPC vendors).&nbsp; It also helps with certain <i>charm</i> type
            spells such as Lull (admittedly, not a major issue with Clerics).<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>The Races</b><br>
            <br>
            As a cleric, you have the option of being a human, dwarf, high elf,
            erudite, halfling, gnome, or dark elf.&nbsp; Each of these races has
            a different set of starting attributes, different innate abilities,
            specific racial and religious hatreds and different starting
            locations.<br>

            <b>The Dark Elf</b><br>
            The starting city of Neriak is one of the most difficult to learn.&nbsp;
            There are 3 zones in the city and no monsters to hunt (you can zone
            3 times before getting to the starting hunting grounds).&nbsp; As a
            truly evil creation, clerics from the dark elf race have a truly
            difficult journey ahead of them.&nbsp; This is true of all the evil
            races (Troll, Orge, and Dark Elf), not just clerics.&nbsp; However,
            the dark elf clerics must worship Innoruuk, the Prince of Hate.&nbsp;
            Being evil and worshipping Innoruuk makes getting faction up with
            any of the &quot;good&quot; cities very difficult.<br>
            <br>
            Dark elves have a great starting wisdom, wonderful agility, and
            decent dexterity, however, strength is very bad as is charisma.&nbsp;
            I'd recommend putting 5 into strength or stamina and the remaining
            bonus points into wisdom.&nbsp; You may also want to put a couple
            points into charisma, but I would not recommend this as you need at
            least 75 to make an impact on the prices you will get from vendors.&nbsp;
            If you get a change to get a crude stein (people hunt Ogre Guards in
            Ferroot and may end up giving them away once they all have one) get
            one, this will put you at the 75 limit.<br>
            <br>
            Once you find your &quot;newbie&quot; training ground, Nek Forest,
            you'll quickly want to leave.&nbsp; Not only is the forest very hard
            to navigate in, there are different creatures that wander around
            that are much higher than the most of the creatures you will be
            hunting, many of these are aggressive to you.&nbsp; On top of that,
            the loot in this zone is horrible.&nbsp; You also can not depend on
            the guards to be there for you, as many have taken it upon
            themselves to slay your protectors (&quot;good raced&quot; PCs).&nbsp;
            In time you can also repay the favor to their guards, but first you
            must grow in power.&nbsp; I would suggest that you head over
            Innothule Swamp and bind in Grobb after you hit level 4.&nbsp; The
            Foglocks and Kobalds have great loot, you will increase your
            swimming ability (it is a swamp after all), and you can generally
            rely on the Troll guards to protect you.&nbsp; You can hunt in this
            zone until level 12 or so, then it's a quick trip to South Ro.&nbsp;
            After you reach level 16, you can start hunting inside of Guk,
            continue hunting in South Ro, or head to Oasis.&nbsp; All of these
            zones are very close to Grobb.&nbsp; Remember the crude stein that I
            recommended that you get?&nbsp; Ferroot is right next to Innothule
            Swamp.<br>
            <br>
            One main complaint about this race is that they have a difficult, if
            not impossible, journey to complete class specific quests.&nbsp; My
            thoughts on this, having played many different character/race
            combinations, is that there are just too few cleric quests in
            general, not a specific slight on the dark elf cleric.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The Dwarf</b><br>
            Dwarven clerics start in Kaladim, with the cleric guild being in
            North Kaladim (2 zones in this city).&nbsp; The starting hunting
            grounds are excellent, as Butchblock can take you from level 1 to
            around level 12 or so, with lots of undead.&nbsp; There are many
            good quests in the city which give incredible experience for low
            level players, as well as some great rewards.<br>
            <br>
            Dwarves are from a hearty stock of the short folk.&nbsp; They have
            the highest strength of all clerics, a great starting wisdom, very
            high dexterity, medium agility, a low intelligence and are just
            plain ugly (low charisma).&nbsp; I would recommend that you put all
            your points into wisdom and the remaining points into agility.&nbsp;
            Dwarven clerics tend to maintain their combat role for a number of
            levels past other clerics.&nbsp; They do this by hitting for good
            damage pretty consistently.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The Erudite</b><br>
            Erudite clerics start in Erudin, on the far continent of Erud.&nbsp;
            City is two zones with some very nice graphics, however, the newbie
            hunting grounds are horrible.&nbsp; It's difficult to see very far
            in any direction and there are few landmarks.&nbsp; It gets easier
            when you get your sense heading up a bit, but I'd recommend you take
            the ship to Qeynos and get bound right at the front of the city
            there (Qeynos has all the cleric spells).&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Erudites are humans breed for intellectual superiority.&nbsp; They
            are the &quot;High Man&quot;, much like High Elves are the
            intellectual superior of their wood elf cousins, both are smarter
            but weaker of body.&nbsp; The other races do not particularly like
            the Erudites, although they are not an &quot;evil&quot; race.&nbsp;
            They do not like the Erudites' &quot;superior&quot; attitude,
            however, this is a minor faction difference (unlike the Dark Elves).&nbsp;
            Erudites are blind as a bat at night, just like their human
            relatives.<br>
            <br>
            Excellent starting wisdom, the best starting intelligence of all
            clerics, good stamina, and average dexterity, agility, and charisma.&nbsp;
            Strength is a weakness, and the agility could be a bit higher.&nbsp;
            I would add 5 points to strength and 5 into agility, putting the
            remaining points into wisdom.<br>
            <br>
            The Erudite Cleric will find that his/her combat role fades pretty
            quickly in the late 20s, early 30s.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>The Gnome</b><br>
            The gnomes start in the city of Ak'Anon.&nbsp; They have a racial
            trade skill, called tinkering, which has some useful items and many
            items that have not been found yet.&nbsp; This could end up being
            one of the best trade skills in the game, if it becomes explored
            (there needs to be some fixes from Verant too).&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Good starting hunting grounds as you can hunt here from 1 to about
            16, getting good loot and experience.&nbsp; This zone will make you
            group much more in the beginning stages of your character as many
            monsters will join the fight when you are trying to kill something,
            but this game is about grouping so it gets you ready for future
            adventures.<br>
            <br>
            Gnomes have the lowest starting wisdom of all the races, they also
            have the lowest strength, and pretty bad charisma.&nbsp; They do
            have great agility, dexterity, and intelligence.&nbsp; I would
            recommend that you put as many points into wisdom as you can and
            dump the rest into strength or agility.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The Halfling</b><br>
            Halflings start in the city of Rivervale.&nbsp; Excellent hunting
            grounds, some nice quests available in the city too, but probably
            the best reason for starting in this city is that it is pretty much
            in the center of the main continent.&nbsp; You do not have far to
            travel to reach anywhere.&nbsp; Halflings also have the ability to
            hide.&nbsp; This is a nice ability for meditating, but this skill
            will never increase (max is 40 I believe). Moving when you are
            hidden will cause you to appear (you can stand, sit or turn).<br>
            <br>
            These little, furry-footed fellows have the highest agility and
            dexterity of all clerics, good stamina and strength and a good
            starting wisdom.&nbsp; Their intelligence is low, as is their
            charisma (who really likes furry feet?).&nbsp;&nbsp; I would
            recommend maxing out wisdom and then throw the rest into strength,
            intelligence or stamina.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            The Halfling cleric, along with their Dwarven counterparts, can
            maintain a combat role for a number of levels past that of many
            other clerics.&nbsp; They do this by not getting hit as much.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The High Elf</b><br>
            The city of Felwithe is the starting place of high elf clerics.&nbsp;
            There are two zones in this city.&nbsp; A good, although somewhat
            crowded, newbie hunting grounds as you will have to share the same
            space with your wood-elf cousins.&nbsp; Lots of great quests for low
            level characters.&nbsp; Somewhat similar to the Erudites, some races
            think that the High Elves are a bit too snobbish (a VERY, very minor
            faction change).<br>
            <br>
            The High Elf has the highest starting wisdom of all the races, a
            high intelligence, good agility and charisma, medium stamina and
            dexterity, but the lowest strength of all the clerics.&nbsp; I would
            recommend that you put as many points into wisdom as you can stand,
            then put the remaining points into strength.&nbsp; Any remaining
            points should be put into agility.&nbsp; This is one race where you
            can get away with not putting the majority of your points into
            wisdom, however, many still put the majority into this (it will max
            out at 130).<br>
            <br>
            High Elves will be one of the first races to remove themselves from
            combat.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The Human</b><br>
            Humans have the most balanced set of starting statistics.&nbsp; As a
            human, you can start out in Quenos or Free Port, two cities with
            many quests, a very good starting (&quot;newbie&quot;) zone, and the
            benefit of being on the &quot;mainland&quot; or central part of
            Norrath.&nbsp; The can not see at night or in enclosed areas without
            some sort of light.<br>
            <br>
            All of the human's statistics are average.&nbsp; I would recommend
            putting all that you can into wisdom, then split the remainder into
            agility and strength.<br>
            *****<br>
            I have stayed away from making a recommendation of which class to
            pick, however, I will say the top four that I recommend are High
            Elf, Dwarf, Halfling, and Dark Elf.&nbsp; They all have their
            advantages and disadvantages, but I truly believe that you can make
            each race a great cleric.&nbsp; I also did not follow the formula
            above when creating my character, but if I were to start a new
            cleric (with all that I know now) I would.<br>
