          <hr>
          <p><b>Introduction<br>
          </b><br>
          In Everquest, a game focusing on grouping together with your fellow
          adventurers, a cleric is the most sought after and important part of a
          good group.&nbsp; A Cleric's specialty is healing and, in all of
          Norrath, we have&nbsp; no equal.&nbsp; We are essential to a group at
          high levels and a great benefit to a group at any level.&nbsp; With
          the benefit to a group that we provide, we also rely on grouping more
          than most classes out there.&nbsp; It is very difficult to solo your
          way into the mid levels as many melee classes, necros, wizards,
          druids, shaman and mages can.&nbsp; This is also in your favor, as you
          will find out who you like and who you don't earlier in your
          &quot;life&quot; than the classes that primarily solo.<br>
          <br>
          We are not limited in the armor we can wear, as &quot;pure
          casters&quot; are, but we are limited in the weapons we can use.&nbsp;
          We are limited to blunt weapons only (one handed and two handed
          blunt).&nbsp; We also get higher melee skills than the pure casters,
          but lower than the pure melee classes or hybrids.<br>
          <br>
          Now, I'm going to dispel some myths from the beginning.&nbsp; We don't
          even come close to the amount of damage that the melee classes can put
          out with a weapon, which will make us very much like the pure casters
          at higher levels.&nbsp; There are a few reasons for this.&nbsp; The
          first reason is that our melee skills are not as good as that of a
          warrior, ranger, paladin, shadow knight, rogue or bard, although they
          are not that far off.&nbsp; Another reason that clerics are not a
          melee contributor at higher levels is that there are no blunt weapons
          that produce the amount of damage necessary to take down monsters over
          level 30.&nbsp; The biggest reason that we don't deal out the
          necessary damage is that we do not get dual wield or double attack.&nbsp;
          Combine this with the fact that the only defensive ability we get
          (dodge) caps out at good, and we end up hitting for 19 while the
          monsters are hitting us for 35-100 with multiple attacks.&nbsp; Not a
          good thing, however, this is to your advantage, trust me.&nbsp; The
          higher level monsters HATE healers (just like we hate monsters that
          heal), adding to their hate list by doing damage to them is not in
          your best interest.<br>
          <br>
          You will eventually become part of the &quot;back row&quot; who do not
          engage in melee, but stand back and cast spells while letting the
          melee classes keep the various critters off you.&nbsp; Until you reach
          that level, however, you will be engaging in melee, casting DD spells,
          healing, buffing, stunning, rooting, and anything else you can to take
          down those monsters.<br>
          <br>
          With that said, let's look at some options you have for becoming a
          member of the healing elite.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Creating your character</b><br>
          <br>
          There are all kinds of reasons for creating a character a certain way.&nbsp;
          The role-playing aspects of this game are limited only by your
          imagination.&nbsp; The different races have different statistics and
          starting locations, which can be an advantage or a disadvantage.&nbsp;
          We'll look at both the statistics and the starting location for
          evaluating the races, but I must stress that you must play a race that
          you think would be fun.&nbsp; All the races that can be a cleric can
          make good clerics.<br>
          <br>
          Wisdom is the key to being a Cleric.&nbsp; The more wisdom you have =
          the more mana you have, this translates into the more healing you can
          do.&nbsp; It doesn't mean that the race with the most mana is best
          (there are no &quot;winners&quot; or &quot;loosers&quot;), as timing
          of healing and casting of other spells often influence the balance of
          a battle, but wisdom will be the most important statistic you have.&nbsp;
          You can be a good or bad cleric, no matter what race you choose.&nbsp;
          Becoming a good cleric is something you learn.&nbsp; There are enough
          statistic enhancing items out there to (almost) make up for any
          beginning racial statistics you have, becoming a good cleric is up to
          you :)<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>What the statistics mean</b><br>
          <br>
          **Note: there are several large &quot;milestones&quot; where
          increasing a certain statistic will return a proportionately larger
          amount of benefit.&nbsp; The largest noticeable effects are for
          strength, dexterity, agility, and charisma.&nbsp; Mana is not effected
          by these milestones.&nbsp; These milestones are at 75, 100, 125, 150,
          and 175.&nbsp; You will see a larger difference in AC if you dexterity
          increases from 74 to 75 than you would if you increase dexterity from
          75 to 76.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Strength</b>- With higher strength you'll hit harder, you'll hit
          for max damage more often with your weapon, and carry a whole lot
          more.&nbsp; If you dream of one day wearing a full suit of steel plate
          mail, you should have around 85 strength.&nbsp; Most high level
          clerics that can afford a full set, often do not wear all steel plate
          as you generally will have a number of wisdom enhancing items that are
          used in place of the pieces of plate armor.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Stamina</b>- The higher stamina you have the more hit points you'll
          have.&nbsp; You'll also be able to swing your mace/staff longer
          without tiring, and be able to jump or swim longer.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Agility</b>- The higher agility that you have, the less you will
          get hit in combat.&nbsp; This directly effects your armor class (AC).<br>
          <br>
          <b>Dexterity</b>- This statistic increases your weapon proficiency
          (you'll hit more often), as well as help decrease the number of times
          you will be interrupted while casting. (<b>ed. note:</b> The effect of
          dexterity on spell interruptions is not supported by the game designer
          in charge of magic at Verant).<br>
          <br>
          <b>Wisdom</b>- High wisdom means more mana.&nbsp; A higher wisdom also
          helps to decrease the chance of you being interrupted while casting. (<b>ed.
          note:</b> The effect of wisdom on spell interruptions is not supported
          by the game designer in charge of magic at Verant).&nbsp; It also
          reduces the chance of failures using skills (e.g. jewelcrafting).<br>
          <br>
          <b>Intelligence</b>- Higher intelligence will help you learn skills at
          a faster pace.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Charisma</b>- Charisma affects how NPCs view you (after racial,
          religious, and past history bias).&nbsp; High charisma can help you
          buy items for a lower price or sell items at a higher price (from NPC
          vendors).&nbsp; It also helps with certain <i>charm</i> type spells
          such as Lull (admittedly, not a major issue with Clerics).<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>The Races</b><br>
          <br>
          As a cleric, you have the option of being a human, dwarf, high elf,
          erudite, halfling, gnome, or dark elf.&nbsp; Each of these races has a
          different set of starting attributes, different innate abilities,
          specific racial and religious hatreds and different starting
          locations.<br>

          times before getting to the starting hunting grounds).&nbsp; As a
          truly evil creation, clerics from the dark elf race have a truly
          difficult journey ahead of them.&nbsp; This is true of all the evil
          races (Troll, Orge, and Dark Elf), not just clerics.&nbsp; However,
          the dark elf clerics must worship Innoruuk, the Prince of Hate.&nbsp;
          Being evil and worshipping Innoruuk makes getting faction up with any
          of the &quot;good&quot; cities very difficult.<br>
          <br>
          Dark elves have a great starting wisdom, wonderful agility, and decent
          dexterity, however, strength is very bad as is charisma.&nbsp; I'd
          recommend putting 5 into strength or stamina and the remaining bonus
          points into wisdom.&nbsp; You may also want to put a couple points
          into charisma, but I would not recommend this as you need at least 75
          to make an impact on the prices you will get from vendors.&nbsp; If
          you get a change to get a crude stein (people hunt Ogre Guards in
          Ferroot and may end up giving them away once they all have one) get
          one, this will put you at the 75 limit.<br>
          <br>
          Once you find your &quot;newbie&quot; training ground, Nek Forest,
          you'll quickly want to leave.&nbsp; Not only is the forest very hard
          to navigate in, there are different creatures that wander around that
          are much higher than the most of the creatures you will be hunting,
          many of these are aggressive to you.&nbsp; On top of that, the loot in
          this zone is horrible.&nbsp; You also can not depend on the guards to
          be there for you, as many have taken it upon themselves to slay your
          protectors (&quot;good raced&quot; PCs).&nbsp; In time you can also
          repay the favor to their guards, but first you must grow in power.&nbsp;
          I would suggest that you head over Innothule Swamp and bind in Grobb
          after you hit level 4.&nbsp; The Foglocks and Kobalds have great loot,
          you will increase your swimming ability (it is a swamp after all), and
          you can generally rely on the Troll guards to protect you.&nbsp; You
          can hunt in this zone until level 12 or so, then it's a quick trip to
          South Ro.&nbsp; After you reach level 16, you can start hunting inside
          of Guk, continue hunting in South Ro, or head to Oasis.&nbsp; All of
          these zones are very close to Grobb.&nbsp; Remember the crude stein
          that I recommended that you get?&nbsp; Ferroot is right next to
          Innothule Swamp.<br>
          <br>
          One main complaint about this race is that they have a difficult, if
          not impossible, journey to complete class specific quests.&nbsp; My
          thoughts on this, having played many different character/race
          combinations, is that there are just too few cleric quests in general,
          not a specific slight on the dark elf cleric.<br>
          <br>
          <b>The Dwarf</b><br>
          Dwarven clerics start in Kaladim, with the cleric guild being in North
          Kaladim (2 zones in this city).&nbsp; The starting hunting grounds are
          excellent, as Butchblock can take you from level 1 to around level 12
          or so, with lots of undead.&nbsp; There are many good quests in the
          city which give incredible experience for low level players, as well
          as some great rewards.<br>
          <br>
          Dwarves are from a hearty stock of the short folk.&nbsp; They have the
          highest strength of all clerics, a great starting wisdom, very high
          dexterity, medium agility, a low intelligence and are just plain ugly
          (low charisma).&nbsp; I would recommend that you put all your points
          into wisdom and the remaining points into agility.&nbsp; Dwarven
          clerics tend to maintain their combat role for a number of levels past
          other clerics.&nbsp; They do this by hitting for good damage pretty
          consistently.<br>
          <br>
          <b>The Erudite</b><br>
          Erudite clerics start in Erudin, on the far continent of Erud.&nbsp;
          City is two zones with some very nice graphics, however, the newbie
          hunting grounds are horrible.&nbsp; It's difficult to see very far in
          any direction and there are few landmarks.&nbsp; It gets easier when
          you get your sense heading up a bit, but I'd recommend you take the
          ship to Qeynos and get bound right at the front of the city there (Qeynos
          has all the cleric spells).&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          Erudites are humans breed for intellectual superiority.&nbsp; They are
          the &quot;High Man&quot;, much like High Elves are the intellectual
          superior of their wood elf cousins, both are smarter but weaker of
          body.&nbsp; The other races do not particularly like the Erudites,
          although they are not an &quot;evil&quot; race.&nbsp; They do not like
          the Erudites' &quot;superior&quot; attitude, however, this is a minor
          faction difference (unlike the Dark Elves).&nbsp; Erudites are blind
          as a bat at night, just like their human relatives.<br>
          <br>
          Excellent starting wisdom, the best starting intelligence of all
          clerics, good stamina, and average dexterity, agility, and charisma.&nbsp;
          Strength is a weakness, and the agility could be a bit higher.&nbsp; I
          would add 5 points to strength and 5 into agility, putting the
          remaining points into wisdom.<br>
          <br>
          The Erudite Cleric will find that his/her combat role fades pretty
          quickly in the late 20s, early 30s.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>The Gnome</b><br>
          The gnomes start in the city of Ak'Anon.&nbsp; They have a racial
          trade skill, called tinkering, which has some useful items and many
          items that have not been found yet.&nbsp; This could end up being one
          of the best trade skills in the game, if it becomes explored (there
          needs to be some fixes from Verant too).&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          Good starting hunting grounds as you can hunt here from 1 to about 16,
          getting good loot and experience.&nbsp; This zone will make you group
          much more in the beginning stages of your character as many monsters
          will join the fight when you are trying to kill something, but this
          game is about grouping so it gets you ready for future adventures.<br>
          <br>
          Gnomes have the lowest starting wisdom of all the races, they also
          have the lowest strength, and pretty bad charisma.&nbsp; They do have
          great agility, dexterity, and intelligence.&nbsp; I would recommend
          that you put as many points into wisdom as you can and dump the rest
          into strength or agility.<br>
          <br>
          <b>The Halfling</b><br>
          Halflings start in the city of Rivervale.&nbsp; Excellent hunting
          grounds, some nice quests available in the city too, but probably the
          best reason for starting in this city is that it is pretty much in the
          center of the main continent.&nbsp; You do not have far to travel to
          reach anywhere.&nbsp; Halflings also have the ability to hide.&nbsp;
          This is a nice ability for meditating, but this skill will never
          increase (max is 40 I believe). Moving when you are hidden will cause
          you to appear (you can stand, sit or turn).<br>
          <br>
          These little, furry-footed fellows have the highest agility and
          dexterity of all clerics, good stamina and strength and a good
          starting wisdom.&nbsp; Their intelligence is low, as is their charisma
          (who really likes furry feet?).&nbsp;&nbsp; I would recommend maxing
          out wisdom and then throw the rest into strength, intelligence or
          stamina.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          The Halfling cleric, along with their Dwarven counterparts, can
          maintain a combat role for a number of levels past that of many other
          clerics.&nbsp; They do this by not getting hit as much.<br>
          <br>
          <b>The High Elf</b><br>
          The city of Felwithe is the starting place of high elf clerics.&nbsp;
          There are two zones in this city.&nbsp; A good, although somewhat
          crowded, newbie hunting grounds as you will have to share the same
          space with your wood-elf cousins.&nbsp; Lots of great quests for low
          level characters.&nbsp; Somewhat similar to the Erudites, some races
          think that the High Elves are a bit too snobbish (a VERY, very minor
          faction change).<br>
          <br>
          The High Elf has the highest starting wisdom of all the races, a high
          intelligence, good agility and charisma, medium stamina and dexterity,
          but the lowest strength of all the clerics.&nbsp; I would recommend
          that you put as many points into wisdom as you can stand, then put the
          remaining points into strength.&nbsp; Any remaining points should be
          put into agility.&nbsp; This is one race where you can get away with
          not putting the majority of your points into wisdom, however, many
          still put the majority into this (it will max out at 130).<br>
          <br>
          High Elves will be one of the first races to remove themselves from
          combat.<br>
          <br>
          <b>The Human</b><br>
          Humans have the most balanced set of starting statistics.&nbsp; As a
          human, you can start out in Quenos or Free Port, two cities with many
          quests, a very good starting (&quot;newbie&quot;) zone, and the
          benefit of being on the &quot;mainland&quot; or central part of
          Norrath.&nbsp; The can not see at night or in enclosed areas without
          some sort of light.<br>
          <br>
          All of the human's statistics are average.&nbsp; I would recommend
          putting all that you can into wisdom, then split the remainder into
          agility and strength.<br>
          *****<br>
          I have stayed away from making a recommendation of which class to
          pick, however, I will say the top four that I recommend are High Elf,
          Dwarf, Halfling, and Dark Elf.&nbsp; They all have their advantages
          and disadvantages, but I truly believe that you can make each race a
          great cleric.&nbsp; I also did not follow the formula above when
          creating my character, but if I were to start a new cleric (with all
          that I know now) I would.<br>
