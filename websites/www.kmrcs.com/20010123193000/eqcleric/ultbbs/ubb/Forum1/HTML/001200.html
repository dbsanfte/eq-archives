</FONT><HR>January 20th, 7:00am <BR>                -------------------- <P>                *Announcements* <P>                The Plane of Sky is now open!!! As a reminder to our customers, the alternate planes<BR>                of reality do not necessarily follow the same physical or ethereal rules as Norrath<BR>                proper. Enjoy! <P>                Today is patch day! The EverQuest servers have been patched with the following<BR>                changes: <P><BR>                *General Changes / Fixes* <P>                - Some changes have been made to the exit of Nagafen's Lair into the Lavastorm<BR>                Mountains. This will hopefully reduce if not solve the bug that causes people to fall<BR>                into lava when exiting Nagafen's Lair. Please let us know how this goes. <P>                - Due to feedback received from the customers concerning the density of fog during<BR>                rainstorms, visibility has been increased. <P>                - All drops of steel weapons have been replaced with higher quality fine-steel<BR>                weapons of the same type. This change was made to reduce the amount of new<BR>                currency coming into the world at the mid-to-upper levels. The fine-steel weapons are<BR>                in all cases superior to the steel weapons that were dropping, they just sell to vendors<BR>                for less money. <P>                - Casting times have been implemented on several activatable items. This was done<BR>                to correct issues that could arise from people chain-casting these items. <P>                - The safe-point (the point which you return if you fall below the world) in Kithicor has<BR>                been moved near the entrance to Rivervale, a safer part of the zone. <P>                - Corrected a bug that caused AC to be improperly displayed for higher level <BR>                characters. Your AC should now reflect all of your items. <P>                Additional Bug Fixes: <P>                - Corrected a bug in the client that could cause a crash if you were spammed with<BR>                emotes by someone on your /ignore list. <BR>                - Corrected a bug that allowed ships to move faster when disarmed <BR>                - Corrected a bug that caused the Aqualung to lose its charges if dropped on the<BR>                ground. <BR>                - Fire Giants in Nagafen's Lair should now recover properly when stuck in lava.<BR>                Consider yourself warned. <BR>                - The Instill Doubt skill has been disabled on the PvP servers. <P><BR>                *Spell Changes* <P>                - Shadow Vortex is now a "drain" spell. <BR>                - Siphon Strength will now stack with strength buffs and debuffs <BR>                - Panic the Dead cast and recast delays have been reduced. In addition, the spell is<BR>                less resistable. <BR>                - Angstlich's Appalling Screech had its radius increased slightly. <BR>                - All Wizard AoE damage and stun spells have had their radius slightly increased <BR>                - Yonder will now interact better with levitate. <BR>                - Form of the Great Wolf had its speed component increased. <BR>                - Terrorize Animal had its casting time reduced and is less resistable. <BR>                - New magician's spells have been added. Check your spell vendors. <BR>                - Reoccurring Amnesia has been made more effective. <BR>                - NPCs will now treat the "Cancel Magic" series of spells as hostile. Previously,<BR>                NPCs did not mind if players dispelled all of their buffs before attacking. Now they<BR>                will. <BR>                - The Fear and Charm series of spells now properly notify the caster when they<BR>                break. No, seriously, we're certain this time. <BR>                - Harmtouch now does more damage beginning at level 41. <P><BR>                *Levitation Changed* <P>                Due to the implementation of casting times on activatable items, the code that<BR>                disallowed refreshing of the Levitation spell while it was active is no longer necessary<BR>                and has been backed out. The Levitate spell may now be refreshed while the spell is<BR>                in use. <P><BR>                *Quests and Items* <P>                - The Armor of Ro should be more obtainable. We will continue to evaluate and<BR>                adjust the rarity of other class-specific armor components to make the pieces<BR>                obtainable in a reasonable amount of time. <P>                - We have changed the reward of a newbie quest in the Qeynos area from a level 49<BR>                scroll to a level 1 scroll. The issuance of a level 49 scroll was a typo in the quest data,<BR>                allowing new characters to amass an abnormally large amount of currency. <P>                - The stats on the reward for the Rogue Redemption quest have been increased to<BR>                make it better than the favorite dropped-weapon for the level range. <P>                - Ravenscale boots will now drop as frequently as other Ravenscale items. <P>                - The Mask of Deception may now be equipped by the appropriate races. <P><BR>                *Fletching Update* <P>                All arrows created with the new Silver-Tipped Arrowhead (formerly the Bladed<BR>                Arrowhead) are now magical in nature, and may be used versus magical creatures.<BR>                All existing items in your possession will automatically morph into the new magical<BR>                items. Additionally, each successful attempt to create magical arrows will yield 10<BR>                arrows instead of the previous 5. As such, the vendor buy-back value has been<BR>                decreased accordingly. <P><BR>                *Paw* <P>                The difficulty of Paw has been decreased. We found that many of the gnolls in the<BR>                new Paw had too many hitpoints, making the dungeon more difficult than it should<BR>                have been for the desired level target. Please let us know how this change affects the<BR>                viability of the dungeon. <P><BR>                *The Plane of Fear* <P>                The item-drop percentages in the Plane of Fear have been increased. This change<BR>                was supposed to have occurred in the last patch, however the data was not exported.<BR>                It has been tested and equipment drops are now occurring at a much higher rate. <P><BR>                *The Plane of Hate* <P>                The item-drop percentages on roaming and fast-spawning NPCs in the Plane of<BR>                Hate have been decreased. Previously, these NPCs used the same<BR>                drop-percentages as the slow-spawning NPCs, causing overall drop percentages to<BR>                be extremely high. <P>                Also, the inhabitants of the Plane of Hate no longer fall for illusions, and tend to<BR>                "Hate" everyone. <P><BR>                *Monk Enhancement* <P>                A monk's speed in hand-to-hand combat will now improve with level, beginning in the<BR>                high 20s. This will result in higher level monks doing substantially more damage in a<BR>                given time-frame. <P>                Though this change does increase the power of the average monk, it should be<BR>                stressed that the monk is now even more in need of true tank classes who have the<BR>                ability to taunt upset creatures off them. We want to stress that the "taunt factor" of a<BR>                monks fist has NOT been increased, though it may appear so due to your increased<BR>                damage. <P><BR>                *Paladin/Shadowknight Enhancement* <P>                Paladins and Shadowknights now have a higher hitpoints and higher skill caps on<BR>                Bash and Taunt. <P>                The additional hitpoints will be noticeable for Paladins and SKs over level 25. This<BR>                was done because the Paladins, SKs, and Rangers had the same HP base, which<BR>                upon further consideration is not compatible with our vision of those classes' roles.<BR>                This change will basically put Paladin and SK HPs midway (in terms of Hit Points)<BR>                between rangers and warriors of the same race. <P>                The taunt skill was increased because SKs, and in particular, Paladins had difficulty<BR>                taunting opponents off of Rangers, Monks, Rogues, and Warriors due to their lower<BR>                damage output. Though the Paladin and SK will never equal the warrior in their ability<BR>                to taunt, this change in addition to some of the taunting spells should help them<BR>                become more effective tanks. <P>                Bash was increased because Paladins typically aren't switching to two-handed<BR>                weapons, choosing instead to continue using the bash skill. Most warriors, being<BR>                ogres, trolls, or barbarians for the most part, do not worry about bash and instead opt<BR>                for slam, which uses the same skill. Paladins are typically the only characters who<BR>                use a shield throughout their lives. <P><BR>                *Rogue Enhancement* <P>                Whenever a rogue is invisible, whether by spell, potion, or skill, they are now also<BR>                invisible to undead. <P>                This change was made to add a definite class-advantage to the rogue, allowing them<BR>                to do something that no other class could do. It is the first step in a multi-step process<BR>                to improve the rogue class. <P>                *Wizard Enhancement* <P>                Level 35 or above wizards will find that their spells (Magic, Cold, or Fire) much less<BR>                likely to be resisted. This effect stacks with the Staff of Temperate Flux and<BR>                enchanter, shaman, and magician resistance debuffs. <P>                This change was made to increase the effectiveness of wizards at about the level<BR>                that all spell-casting classes start seeing their resistance rates go up. Wizards<BR>                specialize in direct magical damage. It makes sense that they should be better at<BR>                causing that damage than the other classes. <P><BR>                *Bard Enhancement* <P>                Bards will now receive the Meditate skill at 10th level. This skill will be granted<BR>                automatically the first time a bard zones after reaching 10th level, and cannot be<BR>                trained further. It will have the effect of decreasing the amount of time that it takes a<BR>                Bard to memorize their songs. Previously, it would take 50th level bards upwards of 2<BR>                minutes to memorize a song. Now it is much faster. <P><BR>                *Druid Enhancement* <P>                The skill cap on a Druid's tracking skill has been increased. This change was<BR>                implemented based upon general public opinion that the former cap was far too low<BR>                for the skill to be even marginally viable. <P><BR>                *Feign Death and Pets* <P>                After a serious discussion regarding the Necromancer's Feign Death tactic, as well<BR>                as reviewing public opinion on the matter, we have implemented a change. As we<BR>                would like everyone to understand why we feel this change was necessary, here is a<BR>                summary of the issue: <P>                Problem: <BR>                Feign death allows you to become an invalid target in all circumstances, providing<BR>                offensive tactics that are abusive. For this ability to remain balanced, the pet should<BR>                follow the same rules as invisibility. Offensive tactics used by other classes involve<BR>                the creature getting a saving throw verses the effect. Since creatures do NOT get a<BR>                direct save verses feign death (as you cast it on yourself), and since you can retry the<BR>                combat once you have feigned death, there is very little risk to necromancer himself.<BR>                As this tactic involves charming an NPC and turning it against another NPC, which<BR>                could be part of the same spawn, it allows for Necromancers to solo MUCH bigger<BR>                rooms than any other class could. This situation is well beyond what would preserve<BR>                game balance for any other class (soloing the Bloodthirsty Ghoul room and Ghoul<BR>                Lord room, for example). <P>                Example: <BR>                While there are many examples of how the Necromancer Feign Death tactic is<BR>                abusive, one of the most egregious occurs in the Ghoul Lord room of Lower Guk. The<BR>                room consists of 2 Bok Ghoul Guards and the Ghoul Lord himself. Using the current<BR>                system, a level 50 Necro can easily solo the room at virtually no risk to himself. The<BR>                Necro can get into the room quite easily with Invis To Undead. To clear the room he<BR>                uses Screaming Terror on one Bok and Charms the other. When the Ghoul Lord<BR>                rushes him, he feigns. The Lord then turns on the charmed Bok and kills it, taking<BR>                considerable damage during the fight. The Necromancer waits until the Ghoul Lord<BR>                returns to its spawn point. When the necromancer gets back up, he is in no danger of<BR>                being attacked due to the way Feign Death works now. He then charms the 2nd Bok<BR>                and Feigns again. The fight goes on and the 2nd Bok is killed. When the<BR>                Necromancer gets back up he has a VERY wounded Ghoul Lord AND nearly full<BR>                mana. The Lord is now an easy kill, and the Necro collects his special items. <P>                Solution: <BR>                Ideally, Feign Death should work like Invisibility, where summoned pets suicide and<BR>                the charmed ones break Charm. We do not want, however, to adversely affect lower<BR>                level Necromancers to such a large degree. What we do recognize is the need to<BR>                prevent higher level Necro's from exploiting key spawn points. Hence, when you<BR>                Feign Death, any charmed NPC will immediately break Charm. However, summoned<BR>                NPCs (pets) will NOT be affected. While this still allows the use of the Feign Death<BR>                tactic with your summoned pet, it does not imbalance the game and many dungeon<BR>                spawns to the degree that charming an NPC does. <P><BR>                *Manastone Changed* <P>                The players have raised many concerns about the power of the Manastone, which no<BR>                longer drops. They cite that people without a Manastone are not as welcome in<BR>                expeditions to the outer planes and other areas as people with them. Since dropping<BR>                additional Manastones via quest or removing them from the existing populace is not<BR>                desirable, we've decided to make it so that the Manastone will no longer function in<BR>                the alternate planes. Furthermore, it will not function in any of the zones included with<BR>                the Kunark Expansion. <P>                We apologize to those adversely affected by this change. Our general goal is to<BR>                avoid making changes to items in peoples' possession, however we felt this change<BR>                was, all things considered, warranted and for the benefit of the game as a whole. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=001200.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=General+Board&TopicSubject=Patch+Message">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

I jumped the gun a little when I said "the next patch", as only a few spell-related items were to be patched on December 14. The rest of the data, which includes updates to class-specific armor rarity, among other things, won't be going in until after the holidays. <P>My apologies for getting everyone excited prematurely. <P>-Gordon <P>The full thread can be viewed at An official response about the quest armor.<P>Hmm, I don't see any mention on the stats of the armor, but I'm willing to wait and see.<P>Thanks Crestus!<BR><END QUOTE><P>See I wasn't dreaming I just thought this quote meant they might have done something specially since they mentioned us specificly. Obviously I was wrong about them fixing anything with our armor. I mean I was at LEAST thinking they might help with the spawn times on some of the RARE spawns that no one ever sees.

</FONT><HR>Well a while back when they removed the guise I heard a lot of people saying things like "Damn this sucks! Verant seems to take take out every item I want right before I get to it! Rubi BP, manastone, guise, etc. I bet that they will make Etheril Mist impossible to get right before I get to go!"<P>Well if you look at the changes to Hate listed, your chances just dropped by A LOT.<P>As far as the manastone changes go, I'm not sure what to think. Last night I would have traded everything I own for a manastone. My only goal in the game at this point was to get one at all costs. Now I'm not sure if I'm totally mad because they made it useless in many sitiuations or totally relieved that I won't be logging in to a naked cleric holding a manastone tonight =P<P>------------------<BR><B>Ramulet</B><BR>50 Cleric<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=001200.cgi&ReplyNum=000013&forum=General+Board&TopicSubject=Patch+Message">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

Yes yes, tracking may have been useless before for a Druid, but they are damn strong enough as is.<P>Manastone change...

</FONT><HR><P>Hmm several good changes with the patch and several ones I don't agree with...<P>Cleric Armor - I'm sure they are changing this, it just wasn't included in this patch.. From what I've gathered the Paly quests were even more screwed with than the cleric ones. So I guess they got a higher priority, we're probably somewhere near the top though of that list  <IMG SRC="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif"> So expect changes soon I say...<P>Necros -  I agree with this change, using FD as an advantage to solo stuff like the Ghoul Lord is just ridiculus... <P>Manastone -  Whoah.. I just aquired one, but didn't trade a whole lot for it, so this is alright.. however, even if I didn't have one I don't think this was the right solution.  OK I can see it not working in the planes as they are supposed to have different properties etc. etc. But not on Kunark??? C'mon!  That doesn't make sense...<P>I think they could have found a different solution for this one.. either destroy manastones completely, or how about a trade in option?  A one month warning, that Manastones are going to be deleted from the game.. they now sell to vendors for 10,000 Plat pieces, sell it before the month is up or loose it.. something to that effect. Gives players SOME reimbursement for it (even though many people will argue that PP is worthless).. <P>Or they needed to reinstall the Manastone into the drop tables witha  different effect..<P>Just my 2 pp..<P>------------------<BR>Odaer Bristlebeard<BR>Servant of Brell<BR>Rallos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=001200.cgi&ReplyNum=000020&forum=General+Board&TopicSubject=Patch+Message">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>And the steel weapon thing was really designed not to affect spectre hunters, but rather the people who kill the dwarf NPCs (and other similar mobs) all the time.

</FONT><HR>I have an idea that might be a little far fetched. I know that I myself DO NOT charge for res's and do MINIMUM 10 a night. I am now going to say to the person I will not res you unless you PETITION upon my classes behave about the class specific armor quests. I know that this will be mostly on the honor system. As you all know once you do a res for someone once for free you become there friend for life. So more then likely you have done it more then once for them. I think this would be a small price to pay. Maybe this is a little selfish but we will see. If someone says I'm not  gonna do that. I then myself would have to decide if I am going to refuse to res them or not. (Probably won't) If however say that only 4 out of the ten do petition, but every cleric with the ability to res on all servers is doing this maybe then we MAKE a statement and get something done NOW!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=001200.cgi&ReplyNum=000032&forum=General+Board&TopicSubject=Patch+Message">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>This from abashi on the everquest gameplay board:<P>>>>What happened to the changes to the Cleric Armor quests? <BR>The cleric armor quests, and all of them actually, are still being worked on. We weren't comfortable with the changes to roll anything in this week. We don't want to go through a whole lot of trouble only to have them "suck". The changes to the Armor of Ro quests happened before we started reviewing the class-specific armor issues in general, so it's very possible that they will get an update as well. This is among the top priority items for the Live Team (the team that handles Quest/Items/and NPC issues).<P>>>>I didn't really read the other classes so much, but the wizard changes? PATHETIC!Slightly increased the AoE and stun area of effect and resistances after lvl 35. SO HOW DO I SURVIVE TO LVL 35?<P>Group? Wizards were affected by resists past about 40th level worse than any of the other classes, as they are the only magic using class without an indirect method of causing damage, and no other combat-related skill besides causing damage. Below 35, the wizards are a very solid class. I hung out with a wizard off and on for nearly 20 levels when building my Necro, and he didn't have a problem.<P>>>>I started picking on green basilisks that gave me exp. The first blue I fought resisted until I gated away.<P>Basilisks *might* not be the best thing you could be killing.<P>>>>Didn't see the shrink potion mentioned... Maybe I missed it?<P>That's not in this patch, it's just one of the things in the near future.<P>>>>It's about time they fixed (or tried to fix), the SolB/Lavastorm zone bug!<P>Let us know how this goes. We've never been able to reproduce it reliably in house.<P>>>>hmmm, I noticed that they didn't increase a cleric's Lay on Hands or a Necro's Harm touch skill? <P>Clerics don't get LoH and Necro's don't get Harmtouch. As for the SKs harmtouch, the damage was upped on that at the upper levels. <P>>>>Every class gets a nice enhancement EXCEPT necros that of course get a NERF instead. <P>Necro's had two spells improved as well. I guess it's normal for people to only notice what affects them adversly.<P>>>>The manastone was a low blow.. Verant won't spend the time fixing the cleric exploit for the manastone, so they stuff the game up for everyone by removing it.<P>"Fixing" the cleric exploit? The only way to do this would have been sweeping changes to buff spells, or a complete nerf of the manastone to give it a much worse ratio.<P>>>>Than they alter the entire plane gameplay to make it fair for new players .. Unacceptable Verant .. Guaranteed to cause weeks of ranting!<P>I fail to see why it's unacceptable for us to make the game fair for players that didn't have it. Hey, it's not that big of a change. There's only two zones that you could use the manastone in that you can't now, so that's the only thing that you lost. Of course, I'll again mention, if the manastone was so powerful that this change drastically altered gameplay, it only goes to illustrate that the stone was too powerful to begin with.<P>>>>WTG on the manastone. It can still be used on Dragon raids but not on the planes. <P>It was a bit of a trade-off. We can turn it on or off on a zone by zone basis, so we would have had to disable it in the entire zone. We instead went with Fear and Hate, so just turned off two of the four zones which we were considering.<P>>>>Now i am curious about the SKy plane.<P>The Plane of Sky is a *very different* zone. There's nothing else quite like it. Not just in layout, but in objective. I think it will be a while before people understand what the zone is all about. To quell one concern I've seen pop up, I will say that none of the armor drops from the other planes were moved to Sky, yet Sky is completely itemized.<P>>>>Abashi could have worded it a little better but one of the Erudin NPCs simply wouldn't talk to a lot of Paladins for what ever reason<P>I believe this was fixed in the last patch if I'm not mistaken. It was an issue with a faction that couldn't be raised to the requisite. <P>>>>Feh, as soon as Druids have *any* class armor at all, I'll harp right along with you. <P>One of the issues with putting in Druid class-specific armor is that Druids will think it "sucks" compared to the other armor already out there. There is already a good deal of good armor out there that druids can wear that increase stats more than the class-specific armor for the other classes does for them. I'm not saying that we won't put something in, but if we do I wouldn't expect it all to be +WIS gear.<P>>>>Have patience. Paladins also were promised new weapons and such, as Druids were promised ther quested armor, and its not in this patch (I know Druids were promised it on THIS patch). If its not in this Patch it'll be in the next. <P>Thanks for the vote of confidence. Keep in mind that it is not our policy to announce new weapons or items. Nearly 200 class-specific items were put in with this patch, but we prefer that people go out and find them on their own. One note about druids, they havent been promised mid-level class-specific armor, this patch or otherwise. Its just one of the things that we are looking at. <P>>>>Verant says that SK, and paladins in particular, were having trouble taunting MOBS off of rangers/rogues/etc. AND warriors because of their lower damage output. How much clearer do you need it? Verant just said that SK and Paladins have more damage output than warriors!!! <P>I never said anything like that, you should read it again. I said that the taunt skill was increased because their damage output is lower than rangers and warriors. It's to help them draw more hits. Heck, if a class complains because the mob doesn't beat on them enough, who are we to argue? <P><BR>>>>Ahahahaha, guess what everyone seems to have missed? Magic items now have a casting time. Manastone can no longer be chain cast<P>The manastone was not one of the items to draw a casting time. Some activatable items yes. The guise/mask and the Pegasus cloak come to mind.<P>>>>WTF?? You know, Verant will go through great lengths to explain why they are nerfing the necros Feign Death tactic although its so rediculously obvious that it should be nerfed..yet when it comes to a Manastone..nothing is said, no threads are opended to discuss it..just some idiotic message about how some people complain they aren't getting let into the Planes because they dont have a Manastone<P>We've been discussing the manastone here on the board for weeks now. I've read hundreds of arguments for and against every change possible, from removing it from game completely, to giving them out to everyone. After reading all of the arguments, we decided on the course of action on Tuesday. <P>>>>First off, I bet the new magician summoned conversion rod thingy works in the plains.<P>Yep <P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=001200.cgi&ReplyNum=000035&forum=General+Board&TopicSubject=Patch+Message">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I'm just a lowly, casual player. <P>My cleric is 21st level.<P>I didn't even know mana stones existed until I heard they were taken away.<P>I was a little disappointed that all we got on the patch was better spooking ability.<P>But then I realized that our class is probably the best balanced there is. I can't think of anything, unlike the other classes, that HAS to be fixed NOW.<P>Can I think of nice things to have? Sure. Like a Turn Undead spell that vaporizes green undead. Necessary? No. We're a very playable class.<P>I will agree that the armor quests need to be fixed. I almost NEVER get more than 2 hours on at one time. Therefore, I will never be able to accomplish the cleric armor quest.
