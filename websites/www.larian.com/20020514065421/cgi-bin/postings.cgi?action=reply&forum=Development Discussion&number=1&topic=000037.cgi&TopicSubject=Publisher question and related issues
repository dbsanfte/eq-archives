Already got one ? If not, then which company would you prefer it to be ?<P>2) To which countries would you want to see Project C shipped ? Which language versions except for English would you like to see ?<P>3) How many CDs will most likely be shipped with the game ? I know this is probably hard to say now but take a vague guess. Closer to 1 oder closer to 5 ?<P>4) Would you want a cloth or paper map of the game world to be in the box ? What about the manual ? Should it include stats of spells, weapons, armor etc. ?<P>5) How much do you want Project C to cost ? Would you accept a publisher who wants to sell Project C as a budget title (w/o box - just CD / ask Marian how Realms of Arkania 3 was published) before you find no publisher at all or would you rather keep searching ?<P><BR>Thanx a lot for a few answers to these buggers  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/smile.gif"> . <BR>As I said most of the above will not be your decision alone but I´d just like to know what you´d prefer IF it were so.<BR>   </FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">lar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">As for a publisher, we haven't even looked for one yet. We're doing this title on our own, as publishers automatically mean a lot of stuff which hinders development.  When the time comes, I'm sure we'll find one easily. As for countries and languages, I would say as much as possible. We're focussing on english now, but there'll definitely be a german version, and the rest of the languages will depend on the distributors I guess. As for amount of CD's, more than 1, less than 5. As for the other questions, I really can't tell right now.<P>Lar</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Anastasia</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hi Lar,<P>thanks for the quick reply. Sounds reasonable. Of course there should be no one preventing you from doing your work. <BR>There must have been some horrifying experience in the past with some other game and its publisher related stuff I guess. I don´t remember the name of the game. Started with an ´L´ I think....no wait....´M´.(?)...no...I´m pretty sure now it was `K`  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>Oh well, I´m pretty sure that after releasing a demo and finally putting up those damn screenshots it´s not you who seeks for a publisher but it´s publishers rushing in and out your front door right up to your desk begging at their knees like Monica for Bill  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/smile.gif"><BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ragon der Magier</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">"Of course there should be no one preventing you from doing your work."<P>Ähem.

Unfortunately, such a contract lasts for more than one game, I think.

Did I say, "a lot of people"? <BR>Well, I am not quite sure, but ONE will definetly not!!!!!  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P><P>------------------<BR>Bronthion, der dunkle Halb-Elf<BR>Bronthion, the dark Half-Elf<P><BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Goemoe</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">As long as we don't know how to play project C we can't say this'n that about the combat system. IMHO this system depends on the whole game system. This BG-system with scipts (not a thing everyone is willing to concentrate on!) and &lt;space&gt; is a motivation-killer in any multiplayer session. We have played it this sunday. Everyone had two chracters to control, pressing space everytime he thought it useful. REALLY UGLY! <P>Why not using something like diablo or darkstone as a combat system? It would be a very good idea for any multiplayer game.<BR>BG isn't turnbased, it is just pauseable realtime. If you like turnbased, then look for a real turnbased system where everyone make his choice and then watches what happens. (your character just died... BOAH 56 points of damage, how did this critter do it?)<P>Turnbased you can't outrun a foe or a foes magic, because you can't see the casting coming. The run-and-hit-strategy is far less thrilling (or not even possible) and every combat lasts much longer due to all the commands and the waiting for the slowest player - but if you like that. Perhaps it is even possible to implement both.<P>And don't say <I>'I don't buy it, when you do this'</I>. Come on, you don't even know how the game will be like, keep being helpful for the devellopment with your ideas, not annoyed because you don't help anyone with it, agreed?<P>We all want to know much more about project C, right?<BR>So let's wait, see, help and be patient (it's hard I know...)<P>keep on smiling<P>Goemoe</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bronthion</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hi Goemoe,<P>you said BG is a multiplayer motivation-killer. IMO that's not true. You can deactivate the right to pause the game for every member of your multiplayer party. You can even play it Diablo style, if you want to. <BR>I have played BG in multiplayer mode with two partners and we have found a good agreement: Only the person who activated the pause has the right to deactivate it. And we asked the partners before doing it, so everybody has enough time to choose all necessary actions.<P>The remark "I won't buy the game if it has realtime combat without pause option" is the sad  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/frown.gif"> truth. I would be VERY sad (NOT angry). I tried Diablo and I like the grahics of Diablo 2, but I have found out that these kind of games aren't the right choice for me. <P>So I really hope for a non-realtime combat in P-C. If the combat would be turnbased or phasebased, I would try it out. <P>IMO, truly turnbased combat has the danger to be always the same, like in M&M. Almost no variations, no group splitting and attacking from two or three sides, no attack formations (the warriors shield the mages and bowmen, bards don't fight but play the harp to give the fighters courage, the thief hides in shadow and try to attack the enemy from behind, the clerics heal the wounded, the druids shapeshift into a bear and hunts the now frightened and fleeing kobolds) and so on. <BR>O.k. good graphic and atmosphere is very important, too. But fighting is the pearl inside the oyster, even if the shell looks good. That does not mean that every problem has to be solved with fighting. <P> <P><P>------------------<BR>Bronthion, der dunkle Halb-Elf<BR>Bronthion, the dark Half-Elf<P><BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bobby</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I vote for phase-based (either a variation of turn-based in which there is an individual initiative system, or a system where you periodically choose complex commands and watch the battle unfold in real-time)!<P><BR>PS: I too will be veeeery careful in choosing a title with combat in pure realtime.<P>PPS: This discussion is getting old...</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Goemoe</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hmm...<P>We have just started the project to play the whole BG with three guys and hope to finish it before they release the next part. I must admit I wouldn't buy the second part if it couldn't be played in multiplayer since I don't like the AD&D system anymore. <P>If it weren't for the world (I have played AD&D pen and paper for years and read most of the forgotten realms books, played nearly all forgotten realms games before and such) I wouldn't even play it multiplayer.<P>I don't like the combat system of bg either. You can't control more than one character without pausing the game and pausing the game and pausing the game and... <BR>And imagine a guy who even takes his time when he has only one option... he will pause it every half second to be sure his characters do what he wants them to <P>So a phased system would be good, when you have some tactical options (i.e. move this one there, that one over there...) but only if you have to control more than one character.<P>If the combat isn't as fast as in BG it shouldn't be that difficult to battle the foes in realtime. I really liked it in MM7 where you could run into a city and the creatures you couldn't handle have been killed by the guards. Nice feature  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>Ok. Phased combat is ok if you have to control more than one, but please no turnbased combat.<P>Goemoe</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bobby</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I thought a little more about the phase-based option and think the better variant to choose would be to only let the player assign  complex commands (although there should be easy choices among the command soup for the less patient, curious, or strategically inclined) during each phase and let the computer-determined battle unfold in real-time. The good thing about it would be that the battle can be modeled to look very realistic and spectacular, alleviate many game balancing issues, give more value to player statistics, condition, and situation, and remove the controlling puppet feeling, but probably relies on a extra strong and varied AI implementation.<P>I’m bringing this up, since if the player is given complete control over every instant of the character’s action, then there are multiple ways to fool the AI and make the combat experience another “look how stupid these monsters are” and therefore upset any game balancing. For example I could beat the final enemy in a game by having a clown run around in speed boots (even without them, it might still work) with the enemy following in stubbornly close pursuit, while at the same time my other party member happily greeted the “mighty” enemy with a rain of nasty arrows. Still the enemy stuck to the “fearsome” clown, since he stayed the closest.<BR>However with the computer-determined battle this won’t be possible to that extent (there still could be a distract enemy option, but the computer could chose to make your attempt fail under certain circumstances (e.g. in the most primitive form a comparison of the enemies Intelligence attribute against the player character’s Intelligence attribute (size of monster group vs. size of player group, line-of-sight, weather, etc. could also influence the success attempt or even the magnitude of the success (e.g. will all monsters chase the bait or will some stay behind))).<P>If you can come up with a good “let the computer simulate the command/statistics/situation soup in all its glory”, then why not go for it? Wouldn’t it provide for fair and interesting multiplayer? Are there gamers that would hate this? Are they many? Have you tried the BOTF (Birth of the Federation) combat system or something with more complex options (which I would hope for in Project C)? Is it too tough to implement? Isn’t it something Wizardy8 seems to offer?</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Goemoe</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I for one wouldn't hate it. The big point in multiplayer games is that you have to keep all players busy. This can be done by some <B>'everyone can set up things at the same time'</B> or via some watch option while one player takes his turn (i.e. HOMAM3). But I think the first option is the better one.<P>Goemoe</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Anthea</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">...and the one to confuse everyone to the most.

But it could be much more fun  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bronthion</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The first thing of playing RPG's is fairness and honesty. So, give all players total control of the game (and combat). If anyone wants to cheat, let him. The loss is his. <P>These aren't my thoughts. They are from Mr Kromrey (SSI). I think, he's right!<P><P>------------------<BR>Bronthion, der dunkle Halb-Elf<BR>Bronthion, the dark Half-Elf<P><BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bobby</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">It's not just about cheating. It's also about game balancing the fact that the player can do anything, while the AI runs on a limited script. Even if it's not you intention to cheat, the enemy always end up dumber than you character, even if the enemy has INT 20 and you character has INT 10.<BR>If both you and the computer run on scripts (which you control for you characters), then e.g. statistics can play the important an appropriate role they are supposed to.<P>As to multiplayer:<BR>Everyone on the network can do things simultaneously. During each predefined phase break all players give commands to their characters. After the first one is done, a timer starts ticking that can run for say a minute before the battle unfolds in real-time (for unassigned commands the old ones are preserved; also, it would be nice if the characters try to save their skin and conserve on resources when appropriate, even if not specified by the player). Of course the host should be able to set the ultimatum to anything he/she wants. If he/she or another player wants to set a different ultimatum during game play, then a small box appears that asks each player, if they want to accept the new one, so that nobody tries to cheat when its beneficial to them.<p>[This message has been edited by Bobby (edited 16-12-1999).]</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
