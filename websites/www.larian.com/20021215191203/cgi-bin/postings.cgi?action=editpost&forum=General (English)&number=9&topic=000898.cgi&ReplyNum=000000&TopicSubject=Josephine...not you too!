<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=20 COLS=75 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Last night it was finally going to happen. I was going to fight Josephine again. I had killed the first couple of black ring members over a week ago, but I didn't have time to finish the game then. Until last night. Finally a creature that wouldn't be a total push-over. I had read so many stories on this forum about how tough she was, that I actually saved a couple of skillpoints just for this fight, so that I could adjust my tactics if necessary. What a let-down.

I have written several rants about the power of the survivorskill 'curse' lately, and let me apologize right now, for I will do it again. Josephine walks up to me, I curse her a few times, then blast her with elemental strike, and 6 seconds later she lays motionless at my feet. Total hitpointloss Josephine: a little less than 4000. Total hitpointloss myself: 0. Number of potions required: 0. Surely this is not the awesome battle that awaited me...get up Josie! 

I must be doing something wrong. I know, being the wuss that I am, I played on normal difficulty, and all you tough guys probably used the hard difficulty level. So, I switch to the hard level as well. Six seconds later she has her final gasps for air once again. Btw I couldn't tell the difference between normal and hard mode, simply by looking at her hitpoints and resistances. In both modes all her resistances were 75%, and her life a little below 4000. 

But I had heard so many great stories about this battle. It was supposed to be THE most difficult battle in the entire game. Finally an enemy that couldn't be frozen! That gave me an idea. Load game again. Cast freeze. Whohoo! It doesn't work! Curse Josephine. Recast freeze. Greaaaaat, Josephine looks now like a popsickle. I can't figure out what to do. While I'm staring depressed at the icesculpture that once was Josephine, her minions keep hacking away at me. For some reason my mage with 937 (just a couple of golden vitality charms) life is nearly immune to their beatings. Why? I would understand if a proud barbarian could stand toe-to-toe with these minions from hell, but a mage? I never even checked the armor rating on my items. Why won't my healthbar go down? I get bored and dispatch the cute little deathknights. Finally Josephine is alive again. After running a few circles around her, she finally goes invisible, and starts to cast hellspikes under my feet. At first it just tickles, but unlike her deathknights, she now actually manages to make my healthbar do something! I could drink a potion, but that wouldn't really be fair. Considering the amount of restoration potions my mage is dragging along, that would make it an all-nighter. So I just stand there. And Jospehine manages to kill me at last. Go Josie! I'm bored. 

I think I'll try a warrior next time. Without using frost weapons, blind, curse, death scorpions, or any form of poison. And I'm afraid I will also have to stop using charms. My character still had over 10 charmslots left in the previous game, with already 937 life, about 2500 mana, and all the resistances between 100 and 150. How I long for the days when I regularly smashed my fist on my keyboard, accompanied by the traditional swearing at the enemies that kicked my ass once again. But first, I'll wipe the dust from the load button.
