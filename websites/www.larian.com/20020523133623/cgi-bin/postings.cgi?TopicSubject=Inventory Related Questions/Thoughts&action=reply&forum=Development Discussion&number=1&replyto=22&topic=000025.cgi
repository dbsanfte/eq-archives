<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=20 COLS=75 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Ragon der Magier:
[I]Hello!

Uh, Bobby, you´re just ugly. Do you mean that you always cut your slain opponents open to see if there isn´t something useful inside their stomachs. Disgusting, ough. A cold shiver is running up my neck thinking about such behavior having influence on the gameplay of Project C. ( ;) Nevermind!)

My thoughts about an inventory in common conform with the ideas already mentioned by the other contributors (including you Bobby  :)).

In Summary:

pro:
- items should always possible to be stolen from a character even if they currently wear it (good thieves can accomplish such, admittingly not easy, tasks, depending on the awareness of the char. Read: a totally drunken barbarian with serious difficulties of even avoiding tumbling when lying straight on the floor, won´t mind very much about someone "borrowing" the ring herited from his father.  :)), except from totally inaccessible locations like the chest described in the beginning.

- the inventory organisation should take weight into account as much as volume. I liked the rasterized inventory of Diablo a lot. But the rest wasn´t that good. In addition i´d enjoy to see a finer grid chosen so that perhaps uneven formed items could be loaded into the rucksack. The inventory shown in the first Wiz. 8 -Screens weren´t to bad either and i found the inv. of it´s predecessor quite nice in terms of graphics.

- Then again, i would like to have the "dummy" for the things to wear directly on-body not being a dark puppet like in DSA1-3 with referring slots for body parts but more like in Stonekeep or daggerfall: elder scrolls (although i disliked the graphics of the latter) or like drawn in the manual of 'Sternenschweif'.
It should be possible to attach a belt for perhaps weapons or small purses or herb bags, rings should be possible for all fingers of both (if provided by character  ;)) hands, if give a spear or other polearm to my char the position of his arm should change as if he´s holding it, the end of the shaft resting on the ground. Without "Schwertscheide"(sorry, don´t know the english word) attached to the belt the char should be shown with the sword in his hand whereas with it it could be rested in it.

- There should definitely be a variety of containers (bags, chests, little bags, rucksacks) differing in weight and size max they can carry (but 99 Herbs in one of the little bags would be unrealistic. Don´t do it like in DSA.). Wearing them out with time (like weapons and armor, and the faster the more you load or have spiky items in it) would be a nice add. A cart sounds somehow strange to me, but a horse for transport would be nice. (BTW: When will we finally be able to see an adequate transition of horse-riding in a CRPG?)

- gold pieces should have a weight too, please. So one cannot carry 1000000s of them around all the time, which is just ridiculous. (this limit could be overcome at least to a certain extent by trading them into lightweight jewelry)

- having animals carrying coins around is of course silly like Tutamun stated. Instead you could gather other useful stuff from them. A bear e.g. could contribute to the party´s food a lot, or provide trophies in form of teeth or claws or fur (o.k. Bobby i´m not much better than you anymore  :)), or others could be used for magical ingredients, whatever more.

- perhaps the player should be able to mark weapons direcly worn, not buried deep in the baggage, in the order he will choose (max. 4 !?) when loosing the main weapon

cons:

- exploiting found chests and other containers:
i´d rather see them realisticly taken them out one by one than in a popup-list. For intelligent hndling, perhaps the chars (if there will be more than one) could intervene and ask to take it, when a class-interesting item appears and they have enough room, which reduces the managing issue.

- picking up things after fight:
the same for this case, the different chars could autmatically move to items of individual interest. I presume that the combat screen, if different from the rest of the game, is still present, so no manager please or at least only optional in a smaller popup-window, in no case like in DSA3 as extra full screen. Highlighting sounds fine though. Either in general after fight or by mouseover, divided into different colors for weapons, misc, magical or so, or one, red if unusable by current char. On right-click or mouseover again short information and buttons for taking or leaving, perhaps with a bigger picture of the item, in Iso-Engines they mostly too tiny to identify them correctly.

- which brings me to an excursion into general interface issues:
use popup on right-click, mouseover-events etc. more extensive than normally to date (why should the comfortable stuff in modern GUIs only be for business applications or plain OS-use. In addition wheel mice are quite widespread know. Why not using this to scroll inventory lists or windows with lots of text more easily. I have not seen a game with that support so far. I think it´s about time now.
What i saw in one of my winamp-skins recently is a icon-popup. It probably would consume less room in a game screen than a text-menu. Oh, and use context-menues.

-back to topic:
Of course the things from defeated opponents should be available for looting after fight and things dropped on the floor some time should able to be found again later and not disappear in a unknown magical way suddenly.
But in the first case, weapons could be broken or more or less damaged relatively to the intensity of the previous battle, potions too if in bags, or emptied during combat otherwise. You could also add an option to bury the victims following a religions ritus wich would exclude taking away (at least certain items, e.g. putting a warrior to grave with his gold-blinking, ruby-loaden two-hand-sword by his side  :)). Not respecting the dead this way might lead to some "difficulties" with the according god or his followers.
Second, things left almost always have someone who finds them. So chances should be, an item  is gone when the char(s) return to the questioned location (but also that it´s still there  :)). Animals or wheather could moreover be a reason that it is at least in more or less usable condition.

- use other incentives to prevent the gamer from loading all stuff he ever gets his grasp on on his shoulders (I won´t see anyone breaking the 100m-WR with 20 bags under one arm in this game, will i? That is of course unless it´s Obelix carrying the same amount of romans in the same place! [And another package under the other one.]  :)). E.g. what would the reasonable hero choose in the desert: his tenth bastard sword because his collection lacks it or a bag of water? Just think about the way already suggested in the AI-topic.
Heavy and even more overload should of course progress a significant slowdown of the character as well as an endurance drain.


So that´s the roundup for this one i´d guess. Nevertheless, if someone has still a bright light of idea, you´re welcome to improve my perhaps buggy latenight work.

Your´s

Ragon der Magier

P.S.: That the in-game appearance of the char(s) should match their equipment i don´t have to mention, do i? ;D

P.P.S.: Just one graphical stuff: damage to items should display everywhere in game-graphics where possible. Including the inventory![/I][/QUOTE]
