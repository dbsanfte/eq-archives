<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=20 COLS=75 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by judee:
[I]Okay, thanks for the extra info. Looks like I'll continue with my Ranger and test it some myself! She's still a newbie and hasn't found a decent bow yet. Can you believe the best bow she has found is a plain short bow? Even the longbow on the shelf in George's shop was totally broken, 1/1.

And of course, every one of my other "test" characters have already run across long bows with extras.

Hopefully she will find something soon.

Meanwhile, she got through the catacombs easy, while my melee tough guy is getting his rear end kicked by those conjurers. Totally stuck on level two. He even has meteor strike, but only 30 mana, and for some reason, the MS doesn't do that well, whereas my Ranger's one point in MS was enough to kill a conjuror in two or three hits. Don't know why it's different with him, maybe because the female warrior type comes with elven sight and can get it off sooner?

I like her too much not to continue with her, so I hope the bow turns out to be okay. Meanwhile I'll just leave the crossbow with my melee character, for variety. I don't plan on taking him far this time anyway, maybe a later game. Though I gotta admit, that close up crashing and bashing is kind of fun!

I know for bow you can do the poison arrows, split arrows, etc, but that's bow, not crossbow. <P>Seems to me the extras for other weapons should apply, other wise crossbow is the only weapon in the game that can't add elemental or poison damage.<P>Anyone tested this out yet? (I did a search, found nothing)<P>Thanks!<P>judee</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Alarys</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I had a quick look at this in the game.<P>From the wording on the skill descriptions, the Path of Warrior's Lore extra damage descriptions all said "melee" in them. This first leads me to believe that only the skills in the Path of the Ranger have an effect on ranged weapons. Testing it in the game with a crossbow and a bow showed no additions to damage with these skills.<P>In trying out the various extra damage skills in the Path of the Ranger (with a crossbow and a regular bow) I could see *no* additions to damage, even at level 5. <P>Problems with Ranged attacks have been noted here:<BR> <A HREF="http://www.larian.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/000578.html" TARGET=_blank>http://www.larian.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/000578.html</A> <P>I think you will find that the augment damage ranged attack skill set is currently broken. They don't seem to add anything to damage in what I saw.<P>I did not use a bow or crossbow extensively, this was just from playing around with it for 10 minutes. I was a melee warrior.</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">judee</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Thanks for the link.<P>That's very disappointing - the ranger skills look so promising I was going to make my first main character almost exclusively Ranger. I've already started her out and she has just finished the first town.<P>I'm also playing a plain melee fighter too, he was the one I wanted to give crossbow too. Though I find it kind of awkward to switch weapons, even with the hot buttons. (They're too far away from the handy ctrl button!) Guess I should get used to hitting pause. <P>I'm trying out several characters before I decide to take on the long haul. I may have to keep my ranger lady on hold until they get the skills fixed.<P>Besides, so far, the mage is my favorite.  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>judee</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">LintMan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Unfortunately, crossbows seem all-around inferior to regular bows.  I've yet (at level 38!) to find a crossbow with greater than 70 damage or so, compared to the 193 damage hunter's bow I've found.  If the bow skills don't apply to crossbows (as mentioned here - I haven't verified this myself, and it seems quite unfair), I don't see any benefit at all in using a crossbow.  Could there be some other aspect to crossbows that makes them worth using?  One handed, or much faster firing rate or something?  I don't know, but it seems unlikely it would make up for not having any elemental damage skills available.<P>I'm not so sure of some of the facts in the other ranger thread linked here.  Someone states there that Poison/Spirit/Elemental damage don't do anything.  I've found they all work fine.  I suspect that the poster thought these skills are passive like the melee versions, but they are not, so you need to right-click to use them, and I believe the damage they list is total damage, not a damage bonus.  <P>That said, I think bows combined with the ranger path elemental skills work great and are very powerful, especially elemental arrow and exploding arrow.  I cleared the Orc camp with one point in Elemental arrow, one in <BR>true shot, and one in bow, using an average long bow.  Prior to that, I struggled badly against the orcs using my heavily beefed-up melee skills (many sword points, plus some several poison/stun points).  Elemental arrow just mowed 'em down.<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Alarys</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">My bad on my testing. Someone in another thread pointed out that the Ranger adds to damage weren't *passive* that you had to select them and right click to use them.<P>This was counter to how the warrior adds to damage work (all passive) so I didn't test it properly. I'll have to go back and check.</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">judee</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Okay, thanks for the extra info.
