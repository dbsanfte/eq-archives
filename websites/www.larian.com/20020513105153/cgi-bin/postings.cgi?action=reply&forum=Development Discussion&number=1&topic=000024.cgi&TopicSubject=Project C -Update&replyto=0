<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=20 COLS=75 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by lar:
[I]Hi all,

I thought it's time to give you a little update on what's going on here. We've got an information overload planned on project C in the next week, and I am very curious to hear your reactions.  Right now we are finally in that stage of development where we will be able to release information on a regular basis, and we'd really appreciate your input.  We also have a title for project C, and once we've gone through the trademark process and so forth, we'll announce it. This can take some time though, so don't expect it to be announced too soon.  

Some things which you've written in this forum have had an impact on our development process, and I hope we'll be able to continue to snag your ideas  ;) For that purpose, I plan to release on a weekly basis details about the game, and ask for your thoughts.  This is a risky thing to do for a developer, as it could very well backfire, but we're interested in creating a game that's really fun to play, so it might be worth it.  

As you might have guessed, Project C is a CRPG.  The C in project C used to be X, but Grischa figured that since we were low on cash, we should change the X in a C so that it stands for project Cash  ;) Given that indeed the game is real cash eater and we have to develop a lot of 'other ' products to finance it, it's not really badly chosen.  Not that I'm complaining. What we're doing is probably what all small developers will have to do in the future if they want to have full control over a title they're developing, as publishers that pump money into a game, expect to be able to decree certain things, thereby basically destroying the game, leaving an unhappy developer behind.  

Anyway, here's the first in the hopefully long list of things I'd like to discuss on this forum.  

When you are developing a role playing game, you are deeply concerned over the question:"Will the player identify with my hero ?". Traditionally "real" CRPG's usually deal with a party, and my problem has always been that in such games I fail to identify with the party. Usually I pick out a single character, try to identify with him, gave him all the goodies, and use the rest of my party as cannon fodder. I've got some experience with developing a party oriented CRPG (LMK comes to mind),  and there the problem of identification was apparent.  We solved that in LMK by splitting the story over the three characters,  but to say that it really is the best way of doing that, well... Because of this decided that our new game should focus on one character, and that this character should be built out throughout the game.  In Project C we have four characters you can play with, two males and two females, but you play the game with only one of them.  The nice thing is that you will meet the other characters with whom you chose not to play in the game.  

When talking about characters in a CRPG, the question of attributes pops up.  How do you reflect changes in your character in a game ?  The better you do this, the better the "role playing " element of your game.  Traditionally a bunch of numbers together with a changing appearance of your character do the job.  I've never liked the number thing, but at the same time I realize that they are very important.  Somehow during the gameplay these numbers become very important.  We've got the numbers in project C, and we've also got the changing appearance (exactly 13568 frames of animation for any particular  hero), but the real implementation of the number thing remains to be done.  I would like to limit the amount of numbers you have to things which really do matter.  As an example, let's take experience points.  

Experience points are basically your score.  They serve for level ups and level ups in their turn allow you to boost other attributes of your characters.  We've augmented this system with what we call the "reserach plate".  In addition to getting your level ups with your experience points, they also act as a "resource" which you need to "research" something.  For instance, when the game starts up you decide what the first thing is you'll research, e.g. learn to swim.  This costs you 1000 experience points.  Then when you've reserached swimming, you can decide to research diving.  And then when you have both of these you can decide to research breathing under water.  This system is modelled on the technology build up from real time strategy games, and I must say, it gives a lot of additional value to your experience points, plus the way you conduct your research, has a definite impact on your characters development.  In short, it's good gameplay.

What I'm looking for now is things with which I can augment stuff like intelligence, strength, dexterity, charisma and so forth.  Sure, if you have intelligence 80 for instance, you can have more mana, but you should get more out of it, no ? Given that a lot of you have a lot of experience with role playing, maybe you've had an idea of which you said, hey, if they put that in a role playing game, that value would really mean more.  If it's good, and augments the gameplay, your idea stands a good chance of being implemented.  

Further, another question I have is, what stats do you consider to be really critical in rpg's in general ? For instance, in project C sight and hearing are critical, because they directly affect a number of things which you also immediately notice. Therefore, if you augment them, you get direct additional value out of them.  What I'm looking for actually is a list of things you expect to be linked to certain stats.
