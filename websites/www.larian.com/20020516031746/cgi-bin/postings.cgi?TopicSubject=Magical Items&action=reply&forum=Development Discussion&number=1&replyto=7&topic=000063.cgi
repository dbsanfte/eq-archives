Reading the P.-C's FAQs/feature list I started to think about magical items and I have a few concerns/remarks.<P>- How necessary will magic items be to perform magic? I mean here: in systems as AD&D (hence BGate), it is necessary to find the right scroll/book to learn the spell (e.g. the fireball spell). After learning the spell, you can memorise it a few times (especially powerful spells). If on the other hand your mage has a wand of fireball, it can cast 10 fireballs in succession, even without having the knowledge or skill level to do so. Now casting a fireball 10 times completely destroys game balance - with it, your mage can kill ANY opponent.<P>- Do the magic items tend to give superpowers temporarily, or do they merely enhance player characteristics? Will for instance, a sword + 2 carried by a mage be as ineffective as a normal sword worn by him because the mage has not the skills to use ANY sword, OR will a mage using a sword + 2 do easily more damage than an experienced fighter using a normal sword (cfr. Tolkien's Farmer Giles of Ham).<P>- Does the magic of items wear off?<P>- Will magical items be rare? Will they be unique (e.g. have a name and history)?<P>- Is some magic only possible via magic items, or does a corresponding (learnable) spell exist for a mage?<P>- Forging magical items is sometimes called enchanting. Will players be able to enchant their own items? The risk is here that players will enchant as much as possible and sell the items, generating an unlimited amount of money. You could allow to enchant only once per skill level. Perhaps merchants could refuse to buy the same items over and over, or if not, perhaps the monsters could steal them and use your own created items against you  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/smile.gif"> (Now THAT would be cool!).<P>- Can all player types use all kinds of magic items (e.g. AD&D: wands can be used only by mages)? If no, will there be a risk that a mage finds nothing but (for him unuseable) magical swords, or a fighter nothing but magical wands (that he cannot use)?<P>And so on... I would like to make this topic as a place for ideas and frustrations of all game players about the magical items... Looking forward to it!<P>Respectfully,</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Goemoe</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hi Dante,<P>I think your main question is: will this game be like AD&D and I can only say <B>hopefully not</B> <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/icons/icon4.gif"> because it is as restricting as it is old fashioned. To find some tool <B>+2</B> you need a system using this very simple combat system, else it would make no sense.<P>From the screenshots everybody can tell there won't be any spells per day because you have a certain amount of mana (blue) which you can use up to your liking and I am pretty sure you will have some tools (potions, fruits, rituals who knows...) to refresh it even without resting. <P>If ten fireballs in a row disrupt the game balance depends just on how mighty those fireballs are. Most rpg system use simple 1-creature fireballs, where AD&D creates huge areas engulfed in flames by this spell.<P>Take the simple way and it will only hurt one creature at a time. If you find some wands with lots of charges they will wear of soon. And of course if there is magical fire, frost acid, lightning, death or other mystic energies there will always be creatures resistent or immune to it, so there isn't much unbalancing due to just one spell  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>I agree magic items should be quite rare, so we will be very happy to find one. But if you use temporal enchantments you could use other systems than the normal one with permanent magic weapons which might be funny.<P>A weapon could be just plain magic with no more special ability than being perhaps more resistant to damage than normal ones. You don't need any bonus to hit and/or damage for it  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>Goemoe</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Arhu</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hmm.. Lar seems to be real busy at the moment... (hope he'll recover soon.  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/smile.gif">)<P>Concerning the weapon restrictions: Depends on your specialization, I would think. Lar tended to use no starting restrictions for specific characters at all. So everything you would be able to use, to fight with or to cast, will depend on what you want to become. If you'd want to become a mage - learn spells, raise intelligence, use magic... if you'd want to become a warrior, specialize on the use of weapons, use them.. You could also want to be able to do a bit from everything. That would be all up to your playing style and likings. But that would not let you become a superhero who's master in all arts, I believe - you would <I>have to</I> specialize if you'd want to become a sword master, for example.<P><I>Meow...</I><BR>Arhu</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Patriarch</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Yes magic Items should be defenetly rare. For magic weapons you can use normal differences to make a wide range of different weapons. Start with some rusty knifes (breaking fast), going over the normal stuff (to do the the day to day work)to exclusiv swords from some master smiths. The last ones could have some attack bonus for they are very well balanced or espacially crafted for the charakter. The same you can do with armor.  <BR>Magic jewelery is a problem. IMHO charakters don't need to be boostet by magic things, if the game is well balanced I can live very good without it. <BR>So keep the magic stuff rare, this way its much more find if you find one.<P>------------------<BR>never trust a smiling Dragon<P>Patriarch<P><BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dante</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I agree magic items (or at least the unique items - powerful and with a name) should be very rare. It gives you really a kick if you find somewhere in a dungeon or in an old chest on the *****k of the museum an item that radiates magic like hell (but nobody noticed that before you did) AND that turns out to be useful for your quest as well. Wohow!<P>I agree with Goemoe in that magical spells and items should not be too powerful (like the AD&D fireball example) unless perhaps near the end of the game where magic could be the only way to make the difference (cfr. Ultima where the spells of the 8th circle include Armageddon and the like...). This could be the drive for players to not to neglect a magical carreer.<P>It all depends on which evolution the game designer wants to put in the main character. E.g.: in Diablo, all player types were balanced very well: to defeat Diablo, you could do it as good as being a fighter, a rogue or a mage, BUT you needed to specialise. Project-C could on the other hand favorise players that are multi disciplined and require good fighting skills AND good magic skills to be able to win the final battle. An pure fighter (zero mage skills) would face the impossible to solve the last problem. Perhaps that magical items here could help the him out, but what then for the super mage-zero fighter? What compensation could he get? Perhaps he needs a follower (NPC friend) to do the hacking for him?<P>Perhaps it is a good idea that the main character has something special (players like that  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/smile.gif">) in that he is the only creature on the world that can attain expert skill levels in BOTH fighting AND magic. E.g. you are the most dreaded fighter on the surface of the earth AND at the same time you are so bloody powerful in magic that you can resurrect slain enemies.<P>Imagine a story line with a charismatic leader that is cursed by some evil force, causing him to be evil. This curse cannot be removed - by death only. But you need this guy for some very important information and hence need to cure him from his curse. To make things complete - he once was the king's best fighter (paladin, whatever) and he has never been beaten in fight before.<P>The answer is: YOU kill him. YOU resurrect him. Needed: a super fighter-super mage.<P>All this are just ideas. And I prefer to kill my enemy by MY hand, and to resurrect him by MY spell. NOT via using some magical item.<P>So i guess, magical items should exist in two categories:<BR>- the common stuff (exercices of the great enchanter - mages to learn their skills): can be found rather occasionally. Helps you a bit further, increases your skills here and there.<BR>- the VERY RARE stuff. Items of exceptional gifts, with a story, a history and of which you feel that it wuld be a loss for the world if you break them/use them up/...<P>Well, it seems I mixed up some things but I hope its interesting.<P>Peace be with you,<BR>Dante.<P>Perhaps magic should be more powerful than plain fighting, just for the reason mentioned above. And of course, usually, learning magic is more difficult that learning to wear armor and to wield a weapon.<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dante</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aaarrrh!

As I said a few times before: Although I'd prefer magic, there are others who don't. Some players would want to play as a fighter only, without the use of some unknown 'dark witchcraft'. And the best would be if he could absolutly freely choose his path on is own, ie if he concentrates just on fighting, he should be able to <I>beat</I> the final enemy in fight.<BR>The diablo system was (mostly) this way, and I liked it.<BR>If a player wants to be able to fight <I>and</I> cast magic, he should not be able to raise his powers to the maximum - that would be unnatural.<P>Rare magical items are nice, but only if there are plenty of 'normal' weapons.

Perhaps you would need (rare) ingredients as to prevent that an enchanter reloads his wand of lighting after every battle, and rather waits until he has a higher enchanting skill level such that he can attain more charges for the same amount of ingredients<BR>- I prefer magical items (unless the really powerful/rare ones) to be multi-charged-and-not-so-powerful-per-charge, just like in Diablo, Hexen (you still remember?) where you need about one or a few actions per enemy, instead of few-charged-bloody-powerful-devices as in BGate's fireball - GADENGG! blast 10 skeletons into oblivian!</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
