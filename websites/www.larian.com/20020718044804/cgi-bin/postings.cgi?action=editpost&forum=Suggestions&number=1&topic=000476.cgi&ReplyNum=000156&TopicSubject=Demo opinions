<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=20 COLS=75 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Guys, you’re killing me. I solved x amount of bugs today, am dead tired, and now I’m sitting here at home, compelled to write up replies to all the essays you’re writing here because obviously you all put a lot of work in writing them up, and because it’s bloody fun to exchange thoughts about this. First of all, welcome Dorien, glad to see you took this here. Now, let’s see what I can add to this.

&gt;&gt;Ofcourse, being the picky type of person I am, a lil more would have been nice. In Ultima 7, such actions like as baking/cooking were offered, letting you assemble &lt;&lt;

Ultima 7 being the work of God, I’m not going to argue against what you said in that part. And believe me, it was originally intended to be exactly like this in  :div:. What happened is two things: A) We went allows ourselves to be influenced by Diablo, i.e. the hack and slash fest because frankly, that’s the only way we could sell  :div:, plus it seemed like an interesting idea to take Diablo and extend it with some more depth. Ultima 7 however was the basic inspiration. But Diablisms getting in  :div: took away some of the importance of objects because plenty of them had to be dropped, and thus we dared starting to overlook their importance. B) The engine is capable of doing all you want, the artwork is there, perhaps here and there an object missing, but somehow it just never happened. There were always tons of other things to do, too much priorities intervening and we just didn’t get to it. (Insert the small developer publisher pressure story and all that here) So, in general, I totally agree with you on the object front and that we’re not taking it far enough. Perhaps one of the first mod kits we’d have to deliver would be the object combination excel sheet which allows you to design your own object combinations.

&gt;&gt; The part that bothers me with Divine Divinity is that it offers so much in the game, but is going to be a solo game only, no multiplayer component&lt;&lt;

Again, agreed. The game was originally designed to be multiplayer, but, and I’m afraid I’ll start repeating myself, no resources, no money, couldn’t do it, had to make a choice, single player still being more popular than multiplayer in the western world, it was easily made.

&gt;&gt;Also, I don't understand the reason for why you have different characters representing 3 different classes for just a solo game&lt;&lt;

We could’ve save a lot of time there had we followed your suggestion, but remember that it was designed originally to be multiplayer too. However, there are definite differences between the player characters – the way their primary stats (failing on the Sir Vancelot test here) affect their secondary stats yield totally different gameplay, plus of course that they have different special moves. 

&gt;&gt;An other small component that confuses me is the fact that, with Divine Divinity as it is now, I don't understand why you did not do it in full 3D, characters, &lt;&lt;

Your point is well taken as it is indeed an uphill battle against the magazines. Lots of them don’t even bother to look the moment they hear it’s 2D. Luckily there are a few who have the ethics too look under the hood, and so far with few exceptions, those that have taken the effort were pleasantly surprised. But true enough, it would’ve been a lot easier had we done it all in 3D, at least to get their attention. And the demo wouldn’t have been so big either  ;)

&gt;&gt;don't know how long Divine Divinity has been in production, but NWN has been for over 5 years), I know the fans would be willing to wait as long as it took to get the perfect RPG. &lt;&lt;

Well, money is a dominant factor here. We’ll be lucky to break even on  :div:, and as the publishing market is getting more and more consolidated, the ones who are willing to take a risk or give a development team the necessary freedom are become rarer and rarer. Still, there are visionaries among the producers working for publishers, and if one get’s lucky, one can find one of them to back your product in those strange surgical places they call board rooms. If one then has the luck that the board listens to a producer, and the development team doesn’t disappoint, one might get the types of games you are talking about. For sure there’s a market out there, but the problem of course always is, is it big enough ? Is the risk worth the effort ? I doubt Bioware will ever get the luxury of doing what they did now again – had Infogrames been the publisher from the start I think the story would’ve been very different. 

&gt;&gt;will be an other. Looking at Divine Divinity, I pray you will try again. &lt;&lt;

When given the opportunity, nay, when we manage to snatch the opportunity, we will.
