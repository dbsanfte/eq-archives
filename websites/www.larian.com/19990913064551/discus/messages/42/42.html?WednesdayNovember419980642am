Ok, I guess I&#39;ll have to start of this rants thread, as it seems noone else is able to take it up. Since I enjoy talking to myself, this really isn&#39;t a problem.  <BR> <BR>If you ask me, there&#39;s something really funny with this games industry. I&#39;ve been in it for a little under three years now, and the things I figured out is that all of us work very long hours for little pay, and manage to enjoy it. I look at other industries similar to ours and see that the same thing applies, though the hours those people work seem to be less and the pay is usually higher. They do seem to take it more as a job though. At the bottom line there is the software industry where people work 9 to 5, surf the internet for around 3 of those hours, don&#39;t do that much in terms of coding for instance, but get paid high salaries for not having fun. The interesting thing is that a lot of those people code games in their free time, hoping to make a break in the games industry. I know this for sure, as I get many mails from such people. Now, why is that ? And who&#39;s better off ? We, who have fun, and mutter all the time that we&#39;re not being compensated for having fun, or they who don&#39;t have fun, and mutter that they&#39;d like to have our jobs ?  <BR> <BR>Lar <BR>

My response to your rant:  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m in the software industry and trying to get out and into the game industry. Why? Why would I give up $25-30K &#40;US&#41; per year just to work longer hours in a field considered as corrupting to children as crack?  <BR> <BR>Because, 30 years from now when I retire, I want to look back at my life and NOT WANT TO RETIRE. If I stay where I am, I will get out as soon as possible and be a grumpy old man.  <BR>So, I agree.  <BR>

That&#39;s interesting. I&#39;ve never heard not wanting to retire as an argument for getting into the game industry. I know a lot of developers who are getting so burnt out in this fast life &#40;ans some have to because they&#39;re in a sense being abused by their publishers&#41; who are hoping to score a hit title so that they&#39;ll be able to retire young. If you&#39;re really involved in a game it tends to be all consuming, and it doesn&#39;t leave a lot of room for other stuff in your live. Over here, we sometimes say things to eachother like:&#34;I was walking in a shopping street and I was really amazed. All those people.&#34; I think a lot of people would call that sick, wouldn&#39;t you ? Yet, it&#39;s what is happening to a large number of people in this industry. If you would know this before entering, would you still go for it ? &#40;Personally I probably would, but I&#39;m considered to be a maniac ;&#41; &#41;  <BR> <BR>Btw, I wasn&#39;t aware that games where considered to be corrupting to children nowadays. It&#39;s something I seldom think about, having played games all my life, and not feeling corrupted in any way. I&#39;ve always found that games are the best way of getting people interested into computers, and who would want to stop a child nowadays of getting into silicon. It&#39;s like condemning to be illiterate in the future. That&#39;s criminal :&#41;  <BR> <BR>Lar  <BR>
