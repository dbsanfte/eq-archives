<p>Bert is our graphics programmer.&nbsp; He thinks too much for his own good,&nbsp; and
is very good at communicating his thoughts:&quot;#### man, that really sucks. Is that you
the best you can draw you # ? My auntie does better than that. I don't want it to be so
(long list follows)&quot; Actually it's much worse than that, but I don't want any email
telling us that we have to mind our language.&nbsp; He likes Microsoft a lot, listens to
profane music, doesn't like to be in the press, steals Pete's modem whenever he gets the
chance and is starting to learn how to play ping-pong. </p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Den kurt sè.&nbsp; Kurt is our lead artist which means he is the artist who gets to
examine the most games.&nbsp; It seems to be the one part of his job about which he
doesn't complain.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just recently Kurt has become a father.&nbsp; When Victor
was born, the team decided to make a small game for him, kinda like pacman.&nbsp; When
Pete found out that it would mean animating a baby however, he looked at his project plan,
and for the first time throughout development announced that he couldn't because otherwise
he wouldn't make his schedule.&nbsp; So we just told Kurt that he did a jolly good job,
and should keep it up.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="mailto:kurt@larian.com">kurt@larian.com</a></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;<img src="_borders/piet.jpg" alt="piet.jpg (9426 bytes)" WIDTH="240" HEIGHT="160"></p>

<p align="left">This is Pete. He's a real nice guy who likes to play with his the toys on
top of his monitor.&nbsp; Pete is one of our artists ans his past achievements include
making all the buildings for LedWars, some of the cutscenes of LedWars,&nbsp; and a real
painful involvement with the czech version of LedWars.&nbsp; Currently he's working on the
tiles and objects for LMK, our new game,&nbsp; and has just bought a new motorcycle.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently there are only 14 in Belgium, our homebase,&nbsp; and he seems to
be rather happy about it.&nbsp; We are currently seeking for a backup artist in case he
smashes into a tree or so.&nbsp; Talking of trees, he has quite a relationship with those.
If you want to know why, try asking him at <a href="mailto:piet@larian.com">piet@larian.com</a></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;<img src="_borders/tom.jpg" alt="tom.jpg (9007 bytes)" WIDTH="240" HEIGHT="160"></p>

<p align="left">This goodlooking guy is Tom.&nbsp; Now if I tell you he has his own
company which is called To.M. you can imagine what or who he considers to be the most
important thing in his life... Right, the characters of LMK.&nbsp; Tom does plenty of
stuff here. Besides modelling and animating the characters of LMK, he takes care of all
our hardware problems (and believe me, we have loads of them) and occasionally does
something else too, though nobody know what. We just know that he's really busy with
something.&nbsp; He's got his own site where you can read all about the To M (tm ?)
company. You can find it at <a href="http://www.hendrickx.com">www.hendrickx.com</a> Try
it out, make him happy.</p>

<p align="left"><img src="_borders/ILYA.JPG" width="240" height="191" alt="ILYA.JPG (7236 bytes)"></p>

<p align="left">This is Ilya. He objected to the comments so we removed them.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp; <img src="_borders/Jochen.gif" alt="Jochen.jpg (8323 bytes)" WIDTH="240" HEIGHT="209"></p>

<p align="left">This guy who seems to be having a swell time is Jochen.&nbsp; There's a
good reason for that. He's the producer of LMK, which means he has plenty of free time.
&nbsp; Notice how relaxed and well fed he looks.&nbsp; The dude even found time to put
some flowers in front of him, just to illustrate exactly how nice everything is going.
&nbsp; Jochen is supposed to be a better ping player than Rennie(tm), but even after
defeating Rennie, Rennie refuses to accept it. Jochen's favorite lines going something
like this:'This is shit, this is big big shit&quot; or &quot;I really like it, but
...&quot; or &quot;Hi, how are you. How's your ... You know, that thing you did, it could
really be improved...&quot;</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><img src="_borders/RENNIE.gif" width="225" height="212" alt="RENNIE.JPG (6999 bytes)"></p>

<p align="left">This is Rennie, someone who pretends being one of our designers.&nbsp; He
tells us he is number one, but I'll let you judge for yourself.&nbsp; Notice the
particular vicious grin on his face ?&nbsp; This means that Rennie is thinking of himself.
&nbsp; How do I know that ? It's quite simple, really. He always thinks of himself. Rennie
has asked me that no fan mail be sent to him. His email address is <a href="mailto:sven@larian.com">sven@larian.com</a>. Why not <a href="mailto:rennie@larian.com">rennie@larian.com</a> you wonder ? Because his real name
is sven. Fairly obvious, isn't it ?&nbsp; Besides thinking of himself, and playing games
all the time (He really needs some help in ultima online), Rennie considers himself to be
the best ping pong player in the world. We are now hiring people who can prove he's wrong.
Please ?&nbsp; But all in all he's a nice lad.</p>

<p align="left"><img src="_borders/STEFAAN.gif" width="169" height="187" alt="STEFAAN.JPG (3813 bytes)"></p>

<p align="left">This is Stefaan, the sound engineer.&nbsp; Lousy ping pong player, &nbsp;
apparantly great bass player,&nbsp; short fellow with a flair for coming with a comment
five minutes after the comment was made.&nbsp; Stefaan plays in the band soulwax, a band
that claims they're good. You can go and look for yourself at <a href="http://www.soulwax.com">www.soulwax.com</a>. Mail to <a href="mailto:stefaan@larian.com">stefaan@larian.com</a> and let him know if you agree with
it.&nbsp; While you're at it, ask him where the .wav files for the music of LedWars are.
I'd really like to know.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><img src="_borders/SWEN.gif" width="191" height="179" alt="SWEN.JPG (4682 bytes)"></p>

<p align="left">This is &quot;BIG BOSS&quot; Swen, </p>

<p align="left">He`s a real workaholic and a good guy.When I grow up I want to be just
like him.A real fine guy,a good chap,nice and considerate.Too bad I`m lying.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;<img src="_borders/KIRILL.gif" alt="KIRILL.JPG (11912 bytes)" WIDTH="231" HEIGHT="201"></p>

<p align="left">This is Kirill, our composer who also performs the music he writes. &nbsp;
We think his music is absolutely top notch, but I've noticed that every game developer
says that. Well, we mean it ! There's something wrong with Kirill, but nobody can really
pinpoint out what exactly it is.&nbsp; For instance, he has to go perform somewhere,
proceeds to going there but ends up in a movie theatre.&nbsp; Or, he's got to make this
really sad song, and comes up with a very hip rock song.&nbsp; Kirill used to perform in
the band Aria which later became Master. You can check this band out at <a href="http://www.rusmetal.ru/master/">http://www.rusmetal.ru/master/</a>&nbsp; Or check
his own page at: <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~rivanho/">http://members.tripod.com/~rivanho/</a></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp; <img src="_borders/MAARTEN.gif" width="170" height="200" alt="MAARTEN.JPG (9768 bytes)"></p>

<p align="left">This is Maarten, our office manager.&nbsp; Maarten has the extremely bad
fortune of being born in the netherlands, and it shows. We're planning on organizing a
benefit for him, and see if there doesn't exist a cure somewhere.&nbsp; Maarten is here at
our studio to figure out what he wants to do later. It didn't occur to him that coming
here was the worst possible choice he could ever make to determine his carreer choise, but
then again, that probably has something to do with him being born in the netherlands.
&nbsp; Maarten is trying to follow Rennie in jokes that show an extremely bad taste. His
latest is censored.... Contact him at: <a href="mailto:maarten@larian.com">maarten@larian.com</a>
