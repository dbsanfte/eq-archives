<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">&gt;&gt;You regularly reply in the forums and maybe writing some of your problems down could actually led to a solution &lt;&lt;
                             
Hehe, easier said than done. We quite often dump a problem here, but some problems really require a lot of typing for some very minor issues, and we change them more rapidly than we can communicate them. I've copied a post from our internal forum (now you know what kind of stuff gets written there  ;), and you'll see what I mean. 


From internal forum, topic user interface :

The interface :

                                This is one of the hardest nuts. I heard tons of suggestions for that one, and tons of comments. Most of them directly contradict each other,
                                which gives you an idea of just how easy this thing is. The only thing everybody agrees on is that it has to be simple, but what's even more, it
                                has to be simple to communicate. Several of the points of critique were also targetted at things which are just not implemented yet. Here's a
                                little treatise on why this interface problem exists in the first place, and what the plan is to deal with it :

                                Everything can be done by a left mouse button operation. On paper the system which was used in the past, with the left/right click/drag, is the
                                best system, but it just takes too much time for the player to become comfortable with it, which is why it had to be dumped. The problem with
                                attaching everything to the left mouse button that it is basically impossible. Unlike a game like Diablo where the amount of actions is rather
                                limited, Divinity allows the player to do a lot more. The only thing we can do is attach the most important operations to the left mouse button,
                                and teach the player how to do the less important operations during the game. Here are all the operations that need to be assigned to the
                                mouse buttons :

                                Walking
                                Running
                                Talking
                                Attacking
                                Using an object
                                Moving an object
                                Picking up an object in the inventory
                                Destroying an object
                                Casting a spell
                                Using one object on another object

                                Then there are all the interface operations for plates, but that's another topic.

                                Another problem is highlighting, but this is mainly an editing problem. The normal situation is that practically every object gets highlighted. This is
                                too confusing. In the end, as a player, you want the minor important/majorly important object system, because that is the most useful.
                                However, learning it is too hard, so it's not a good system. Which immediately brings on a design decision:

                                Can you, or can you not move every object and use every object ?

                                If you can, then you automatically get a lot of objects that get highlighted. Not a problem in se, but the fact that dragging and using an object
                                is ideally done with the left mouse button, and movement,attacking is also ideally done with the left mouse button, causes the situation that by
                                misclicking, a lot of stuff happens which you don't want to happen.

                                Since I strongly believe ultima 9 could have been the RPG which would have blown away both Diablo and Baldur's gate, had it stuck to its roots
                                (being ultima 7), you can imagine that I'm a fervent supporter of the fact that indeed you can move and can use every object. Why is this
                                moving of every object important, even if it does not always add to the gameplay ? (moving a chair for instance) Well, the answer is simple : The
                                fact that as a player you know the world is completely interactive, something which encourages you to try out things. However, if you do that,
                                you have to make sure that there's enough stuff that can be accomplished by the player by moving/using objects, something which is currently
                                not the case. Why is it currently not the case ? Because editing that stuff is too hard. Solution : Make the editors better.

                                Another problem is that of deciding the sensitivity of the mouse. Trivial solutions like perfect match/not perfect match do not work, so the mouse
                                has to be made intelligent. This is implemented, but the rules for highlighting are decided at the level of the editor. Basically the rule is : If the
                                object is large enough, you need a perfect match. If the object is too small for easy perfect matching, the match may be not perfect. The
                                editing of perfect/non perfect was not completely ok for the version you played. 

                                Then there's another final problem with the user interface, at least where it concerns object interaction : It's ambiguous. This is the result of a
                                lot of tries to get it to behave better, and be easier. If you're an advanced Divinity player, then you like it, but if you're not, it sucks bigtime. 

                                The sensitivity thing, the large amount of objects that highlight, coupled with the fact that everything goes through the left mouse button, and
                                the the ambiguity, I consider to be the main problem of the user interface. If that gets solved well, I think it'll be perfect. 

                                Currently I have to following solution in mind, if anybody can come up with something better, by all means do :

                                All objects need a perfect match. There's no more helping the player to easily highlight an object, because swapping between perfect/non
                                perfect causes ambiguity, so that was a bad idea to start with. 

                                You cannot pick up an object anymore by immediately clicking on it. If you want to get an object in your inventory, then you need to drag it
                                over your character or the interface bar. This is loss of something that is user friendly, but again, differentiating between so called direct move
                                and non direct move objects causes ambiguity. Furthermore, this solves the problem of picking up objects which you don't want while fighting,
                                while still allowing the player to move every object (which is a drag operation)

                                When you press ALT, all objects that are in some way important to the player and that can be picked up by him are highlighted using the object
                                boxes. Here there is ambiguity. A cup or a plate for instance will not be highlighted, potions and gold will be. However, highlighting everything
                                doesn't work (your screen gets too cluttered), and you do want a function which immediately picks up an object. Much as I dislike the fact that
                                there's still ambiguity, ALT is already a bit more advanced, and communicating it to the player as "ALT shows objects that are important and you
                                can pick those objects up by clicking on them" should be a message which doesn't take long to get to them.

                                This way there is no problem with having the following operations attached to the left mouse button :


                                Walking : Left click (walk to destination), Left drag (walk in direction)
                                Running : Press R to toggle between walk/run or drag mouse to the edges of the screen
                                Talking : Left click on friendly character
                                Attacking: Left click on enemy character / hold ctrl to attack friendly character
                                Using an object : Left click on it 
                                Moving an object : Left drag it
                                Picking up an object in the inventory rag it on your character, interface bar, left click on it while holding the alt key
                                Destroying an object:hold ctrl and click on object
                                Casting a spell:Right click
                                Using one object on another object : Drag one object on top of the other object

                                Under this system, I see only one problem. The using of objects. Clearly, if there is a potion lying in the world, you don't want to use it, but
                                rather take it with you. That's why we had it that if you left clicked on it, it went to your inventory, and it didn't get drunk immediately. Under
                                this new system, you loose that. However, since most tests have indicated this ambiguity caused problems (hey I clicked on the cup, why didn't
                                I go to my inventory ?), it's probably best to take out this extremely handy feature, and use the alt option. (It seems to work well for Diablo)

                                This is all fine for the general actions, but there comes a point where the player wants to do something special, like use a specific skill or a
                                special object (the spider mine for instance). The idea was always to use the floating icons for this. Due to some stupid bug, the icon for the
                                spider mine didn't show up in the demo, which made it somewhat harder to use it. However, there is one problem with these icons. At some point
                                you'll have so much of them that it'll be hard to use them all. We had the idea to allow the player to create icons for every object in his
                                inventory, but that basically means a lot of extra artwork, plus the fact that organizing all of that in the game screen is a boring and hard task
                                for the player. We'll need something simpler. I've got two ideas there, but I'm not quite sure what works the best. In any case, I would dump the
                                create floating icon for all objects idea.

                                The special action menu. Somewhere on the interface bar, there should be a button which allows the player to access a menu where all his
                                special actions are stored. Thinks like disarm trap/drop spider mine/charm etc… should be listed in that menu. We could do it with the system we
                                have been using for the spells with the floating icons (which btw are planned to snap to grid and all that), but I'm afraid that won't work so well,
                                especially because a lot of these special actions don't allow themselves to be categorized so easily, that's what makes them special. 

                                Another option is to show floating icons somewhere on the screen from the moment a special action becomes available. All skill related actions
                                would then be done through the magic menu like is now the case. The floating icons would be shown in a grid.

                                Hotkeys : I think I'll only allow the keys F1-F12 and 0-9 to be used as hotkeys. To assign a hotkey, you go over the icon/special action and
                                press one of the keys, like is the case in Diablo. Currently you have to first go into hotkey mode (F8) and then press the key, something which
                                also seems to be too complicated.

                                Switching between combat modes : Right now, it's like that you automatically switch to combat mode the moment you click on an enemy.
                                There's no automatic go into combat mode when you are near an enemy. Past tests showed that this didn't work well. There should in any case
                                be some icon in the interface bar which allows you to switch between combat/non combat mode.
                                Pausing the game : There needs to be an icon
                                Options : There needs to be an icon
