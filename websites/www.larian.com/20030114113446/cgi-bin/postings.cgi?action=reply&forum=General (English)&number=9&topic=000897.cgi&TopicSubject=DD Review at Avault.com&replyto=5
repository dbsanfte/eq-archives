[I]Totally agree with that point.

If you wanted a game to be multiplayer but it's not- don't make it take the hit in the review score.  If the game was MARKETED as a multiplayer game and is not, then slice it and dice it.

Many casual readers of publications (both print and online) glance over a review score to see if the game is worth their time.  If the review is overtly positive or negative, they will often times dig a little bit deeper.  A review of 3.5/5 says to most people: "It's OK, but not good.  Don't bother unless you have a lot of time/money on your hands". 

CODICIL:  I don't agree with this line of reasoning and think that reviews should be read in their entirety (after all, reviewers are human and humans are inconsistent).  I would LOVE for Larian to make some beaucoup bucks on this game and wish that reviewers would instill confidence to the reader in the SCORE that is often reflected in the TEXT for those shallower readers of the literature.

The review is intelligently written and brings up some valid gripes. Definitely worth a read. I have to disagree somewhat with him about the voice acting though. While some is bad, I particularly enjoyed the voice of the male warrior. Anyone know who the voice actor is? <A HREF="http://www.avault.com/reviews/review_temp.asp?game=divi" TARGET=_blank>http://www.avault.com/reviews/review_temp.asp?game=divi</A> </FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">lost soul</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">well first off any site that would give diablo 1 a 5/5 score and this game a 3.5/5 is deffinetly out of whack with reality anyways.So i take there review with a grain of salt.Another thing that really frustrates me is when people compare this to diablo 2,yes the interface looks somehwhat like Diablo 2 but this game is on a totally grander scale.Diablo 2 is so dang linear its not even funny.Divine divinity you can do what u want when u want,can u say that about diablo 2??? nope. divine divinity you have so many sidequests it will make ur head spin can you say that about diablo 2??? nope.In Divine divinity when you pick a class can you cross over and specialize in another class skill?? yes   can you do that in Diablo 2?? nope.Its to bad that people want to pass this off as a diablo clone because its not at all.This game has so much replay value its scary and i think reviewers forget to mention that.<BR>I also have seen reviews where people take points off for a lack of a multiplayer when it never claimed to have one in the first place.thats just like a reviewer taking points off for a game like Ever quest because it doesnt have a single player,how can they do that??? My advice to you people is if you want to see the most honest scoring for games go to pc game review.com.Hundreds of players like you and i rate games and whatever it averages out to is usually a good indication of how good a game is.i tend to not listen to the so called proffesional reviewers because all to often there wrong.i would rather take the opinion of 100 people then 1.<BR>Prime example most pro reviwers were saying diablo was a game of the likes never seen before and everyone should get it,heck i was seeing people giving it a 100/100.so then i bought it and omg what a pile of junk.At pc game website where us normal players review games its about 92/100 and it deserves to be that high/</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Styks</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well i tend to agree with this review, even if I would have given a better mark.<P>Actually, even if diablo 1 has a 5/5 score, it should be consider as a "character focused" action-rpg game. So in this particular kind of games, it's actually a very good game and his mark doesn't surprise me.<P>Divine divinity is different, as it wants to be a diablo-like gameplay with a story, interesting NPC, nice quests and so on. So in this kind of game, well it have some lacks and they highlighted them. We can't blame them for thinking that this game has some lacks and should be better in some ways...<P>Styks</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Styks</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Concerning the multiplayer aspect, I totally agree with you.

I disagree with some aspects of the review but that's irrelevant. To question how Diablo 1 got 5/5 and DD got 3.5/5 is simply juvenile. Before Diablo 1 came out, was there any other RPG remotely similar that offered that kind of mindless-clicking, frantic gameplay? Diablo 1 MADE the action-RPG genre. And I seriously doubt you'd find *ANY* review, be it from "pros" or regular gamers, that considered the original Diablo "average" or even merely "good". Maybe you're just a Diablo-hater, and that's fine or perhaps you're just a DD-lover, and that's fine too, but whether you're willing to admit it or not, at least 75% of DD, from start to finish, IS hack-n-slash. I wonder why they'd find something like that diabolically fun. The fact that you'd even bring Diablo 1 up is testament to how popular and well-received the game was. I seriously doubt gamers would be talking about DD three, four or five years from now.<P><p>[This message has been edited by blood (edited 22-10-2002).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Huckman</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Totally agree with that point.<P>If you wanted a game to be multiplayer but it's not- don't make it take the hit in the review score.
