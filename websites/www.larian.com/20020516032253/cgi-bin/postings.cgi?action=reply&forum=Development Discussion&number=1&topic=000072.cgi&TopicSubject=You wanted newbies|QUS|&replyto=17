<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=20 COLS=75 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Arhu:
[I]Hmm.. Bean's from Austria too, but he hasn't been here for quite some time now.

Kings Quest 7 hadn't been done well either. At least the german localization was kind of.. strange.  :) eg the female protagonist was lithpl thpft bah, [i]lisping[/i], maybe due to bad wav compression in those times, but maybe not...  ;)

Another rather strange thing, aside from exaggerated voices, are adulterated or understated voices that don't pay heed to the actual situation. E.g. a character apparently jumps and dances happily around and there's [i]no[/i] emotion in his voice.

Then I recapitulated the merchant's greeting system for a moment. I think it would be nice if traders don't say [i]anything[/i] when you repeatedly speak to them within a short period. I remember that in Diablo, for example, the blacksmith said "Ho! What can I do for you?" the whole time, even if you merely wanted to have a look at his goods (continuously  ;))!

Note to Bedwyr: If you like philosophical discussions, you're right here.  :)
Lurk into 'General Chat', there are.. uhm three rather philosophical things ongoing. And then there is this 'name' topic where you could tell us a huge story about your name.

This will probably be my only message here since I don't have the time to spare in many places.  I suppose that means I've got to get in as much as I can in one post.  I've lurked for a time here and seen some of the promise of this game.  Best wishes to Lar and the development team.  If you can pull this off, I'll buy.<P>Allow me to introduce myself.  I'm a longtime Ultima fan and just -love- interactive worlds in gameplaying.  I'm very picky about games I purchase (since I am constantly trying to break myself of the habit).  I have a career goal (has to do with airplanes) that will restrict me from playing games as I once did.  Thus, I'm getting down to my last one or two games, maybe ever.  And you've got me interested, congratulations.<P>Since this sounds like a question/answer forum, I have three.<P>1. Do most of the people on this forum live in Europe?<P>2. Just how far does this interactive world go?  Are you free to give examples of 'combined' items?<P>3. More of a suggestion as I'm coming from Ultima IX where full voice interaction is a sore point with fans.  It was done rather badly.  Which is better, voice or text conversation and how should it be implemented?  Discuss.<P>With apologies for the length,<BR>Bedwyr</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">lar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hi Bedwyr,<P>&gt;&gt;. Do most of the people on this forum live in Europe?&lt;&lt;<P>I have the impression that currently most of them are indeed from Europe.<P>&gt;&gt;2. Just how far does this interactive world go? Are you free to give examples of 'combined' items?&lt;&lt;<P>For sure, we don't have a publisher breathing hot PR restriction plan air in our neck, yet. And when we do, I don't think we'll care too much  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/wink.gif"> Been there, done that, and it sucks  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/wink.gif"> Basically, we have a long list of properties objects have, and our designers need to make a matrix of what can be applied on what (it needs to make some sense), but technically all is possible. For instance, you could apply poison to the tip of your blade, and have a poisonous sword. You could then use the poison property from your sword on a plate of meat, removing the poison from the sword, and making the food poisonous. Then, when a npc eats that food he is poisoned. This is not actually implemented as of yet, but it's one of the possibilites of our object system.<P>&gt;&gt;3. More of a suggestion as I'm coming from Ultima IX where full voice interaction is a sore point with fans. It was done rather badly. Which is better, voice or text conversation and how should it be implemented? Discuss.&lt;&lt;<P>Well, we have both of them, so I don't think it'll be a big issue.<P>Lar<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Anastasia</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hi Lar,<P>one more question.<BR>As you said skill improvement will depend on how often you use the skill or spell.<P>Now I remember that in Daggerfall you could go to your room at the local inn and cast spells at the wall. Very boring thing to do but it helped a lot on your stats.<BR>How will cheating like this be prevented in Project C ? How do you want to keep players from doing things over and over again for no reason but increasing skill level ? Any plans ?</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">lar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Yes, actually.

After the LMK forum has crashed, many people have moved over here to continue on discussing or just having fun.<P>3) Voices for general pleasure and subtitles for foreign English speakers like me. What's needed more?  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/smile.gif"><BR>Though there's one thing I'd like to say: Static characters, eg traders, shouldn't 'babble' always the same. It's annoying when you just want to buy a new healing potion or so and they start a huge discussion about their items being the best. One time or two would be ok, but after that a simple 'Welcome' would do it too (although some exceptions might be fun  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/wink.gif">)<BR>And an option to interrupt conversations would be nice too.<P><I>Meow...</I><BR>Arhu<P>btw, Bedwyr, do you want to say your post was too large or to small?  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>PS: afaik the latter. ie make the world believable</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bedwyr</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Too large.  At least it looked that way on the tiny text screen when I was writing it.  I am known to write huge dissertation sized posts though.<P>I agree with you, Arhu, about greetings.  Conversation should reflect the fact that you are now an acquaintance of the NPC.  Nice to hear that there's at least one other developer who believes there ought to be a world outside the player's quest.  Otherwise everything looks far too staged.<P>If you wanted me to get going on a long post, you'd have to get me off-topic into some philosophical discussion or ask about flying (I'd go a mile-a-second... rather a knot-a-second on that subject).<P>Bedwyr<BR>(the pilot)</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">PureEgo</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well, for the record, I'm Canadian, so there is at least one other non-European floating about here.

They´ll just have weaker effects in the beginning. So you can´t make any mistakes and there´s nothing to learn from them as there isn´t any (OK, that sentence made sense  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/smile.gif"> )<P>And, yes, this place is really getting international. I saw an apprentice from Australia somewhere around here. Don´t remember the name right now. Sorry.</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dante</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">About the speech in the game:<BR>a friend of mine - a real lover of the ultima genre - has played ultima IX only for a short while, and he has ALREADY turned speech off, because (I quote): "the speech was over acted - when they say something it's always so enthousiastic and so that it gets annoying/irrealistic".<P>Another thing: in Ultima IX, you are always "Avatar", not Bronthion, Arhu, Goemoe, or whatever character name you choose. That'is a pity too.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Goemoe</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/eek.gif"> You play some <I>Goemoe</I> characters?<P> <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/wink.gif"> Well this depends on the story I think. Currently I am playing Planescape Torment and it don't bother me to play someone without name, because that is the story.<P>In Ultima you play such an epic figure too, but I think the story is more then over now. (I wouldn't have bought it even if it had been reviews of 100/100, playable on a 166 MHz machine).<P>What I find amusing is the little fieldname "Name of the character" with <B>Nameless One</B>  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/rolleyes.gif"> . Why they did not leave this empty then? <P>But as in most other epic rpgs: you could always put in a name of ones choice and I think this is a good feature for one to identify with the main character.<P> <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/cool.gif"> Goemoe</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">PureEgo</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I think that the reason for keeping the Nameless One's "Name Box" in the statistics screen was so tat the developers did not have to create a different statistics screen for this character alone.  While it seems like a minor thing, keep in mind that if that box was removed, there would be an empty space that would have to be filled with something, be it an image or otherwise, just to keep it looking nice.  Not to mention that there woul have to be testing done on it to make sure that the screen was appearing as it should within the game.  Basically, it would have required a fair bit of work to change something that really wasn't worth their while to change.</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">illuminus</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kings Quest 8 has the same problem as Ultima 9: the voices are so exaggerated, that I had to turn off the sound every time I talked to one of those stoned townspeople.<P>Revenant is another example how voice acting should NOT be.
