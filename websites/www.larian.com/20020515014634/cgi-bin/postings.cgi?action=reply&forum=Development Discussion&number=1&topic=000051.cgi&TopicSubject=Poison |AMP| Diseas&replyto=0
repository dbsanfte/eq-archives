[I]Hi lar or anyone else from larian.

Do you have Poison and Diseas in your game?

If Yes:
How does Poison work?
It does its damage and then is gone, or does it keep damaging you until you find a cure poison potion or a Healer. There could be both sorts of poison in the world. Although I think that poisons that do their damage continuously should be very seldom. (Maybe only quest related.) I wouldn't like to carry antidotes around with me all the time. I think that it is enough if I have to carry Life- and Mana-Potions around with me. Antidotes normaly work for only one sort of poison and they don't hold very long (after a week they are useless). Maybe poison should be very slow, so that you have enough time to reach a healer. Some poisons may only make you weak and do not cause other damage. A poison could also loose its effect after a while if your body is strong enough.

Lots of different poison types to confuse the player.  ;)

You could put poison on your own weapons to make them more effective for a short while. This should only be possible on piercing weapons and not on blunt weapons.

A realy bad Monster that can only be defeated if you punch a poisoned Dagger in its tail.  ;) You would need a special poison that you only get if you complete a quest.

What about Diseas?
If you fight against Vampires/Werewolves you could be infected with lychantrope (hope this is correct) or become a vampire yourself. But this would limit your Char to only running around at night. Maybe he then could not complete the story anymore. Then there should be a way to get cured (eg. solve a hard quest).
If fighting against Undead or Rats you could also catch a diseas. If you run around in the rain for to long you could get a cold.

While you have a cold or a diseas some of your Char Stats could be lowered until you are cured. If the diseas is realy bad, you could very slowly loose life and mana points or get weaker and weaker...

The reaction of NPC's to you could be interesting too if they see that you have red spots all over your body  ;) "Don't come near me, I don't want to catch ..." Could be funny... Or they could throw stones at you, if you have the pest. *ouch*  >:)

If No:
Why not? Just curious.

It also sucks if you have to abort some long overland journey just because one of your characters sneezes his brains out. It IS annoying and if it happens randomly players will indeed just revert to save/reload to prevent these things from happening hoping they will be luckier next time.</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tutamun</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This stuff could improve the atmosphere of the game. If it is implemented it should be tested very carefully and if it hinders gameplay then it should be removed. Even if it took time to program and render.<P>I also didn't like to eat in Darkstone. The game was more a hack&slay like Diablo. In DSA2 I didn't find it so anoying that you had to eat and drink, got sick, etc. But this realy depends on the game type and how it is implemented.<P>Getting sick should not be random but rather caused by your bahaviour like walking in rain to long, sleeping outdoors in winter, eating something bad, etc.<P>Is there going to be Spring, Summer, Autum, Winter in the game?

But you can armor yourself (or vaccinate or whatever) against poison (like I said in any way possible: magic, armory, etc etc).<P>This way there could be caverns filled with spiders (can you yet imagine it...skelettons in cocoons, spiderwebs, fog, etc etc). A regular spiderlair such to speak. <P>Since spiders are quite known to be poisonous and since you might know where you're heading (cuz the exploration of the spiderlair is part of a quest) you can prepare yourself against poison.<P>Is this immersion or what ?!<P>Just admit I'm good ... urm ... evil  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P><BR>Cybu<P>------------------<BR> <BR>"And is your heart black<BR>and full of hate"<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Cypher</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hey lar, nice icon!<BR>is this a direct attack against Arhu?<P>poison and diseases are a nice gamefeature,<BR>if the are shown and reversable<P>nothing is better than a trap with poisoned spikes!
