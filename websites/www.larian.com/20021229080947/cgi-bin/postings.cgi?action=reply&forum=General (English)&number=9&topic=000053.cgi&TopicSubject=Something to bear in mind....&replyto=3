<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=20 COLS=75 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Arhu:
[I]~[i]Since it isn't strictly a development issue[/i]~
Oh, that's no problem - actually everything that gives the developers food for thought or just encourages them... to work even harder, implement all our wishes, and upload mpegs and screenies once in a while, is at the right place over there.  ;)
Totally unrelated topics tend to be posted in "RPG Chat"...

btw, I've read the (longish) article. Reminds me of the latest D2 update (v1.08) - I've stopped playing D2 a long time ago, so I'm not affected by it, but honestly, making such severe gameplay changes that late after the game's release seems to be really awkward.
They should at least have let high level players re-distribute their skill points, the way BG2 does it if you import characters from the prequel. That, however, could be regarded as cheating, in regard to D2's gameplay. Besides, high level players propably have adopted to a certain playing style, and they would have had to reconsider their entire strategies.


From the article:
~[i]Imms also begin to care less and less about the PEOPLE on the mud, those who the mud was originally built to serve, and they begin to think more in terms of the CREATION[/i]~
I personally don't think that this is necessarily a bad thing, albeit it is not so hot for seriously wimped players. Nevertheless, it's best to focus on the creation [i]before[/i] a release, and maybe add a few gameplay [i]enhancing[/i] features later on.

~[i]If you had two knives, one dull and one sharp, would it not make better sense to make them equal by sharpening the dull one - not by blunting the sharp one?[/i]~
This could of course be changed to a "sharp knife" vs. a "insta-death laser rifle". Then changing the sharp knive to another insta-death laser rifle wouldn't make as much sense, since it would change the entire game philosophy and could possibly be worse than "sharp knife" vs. "dull knife".

Be that as it may, basically I'm all for (even belated) gameplay adjustments, as long as the players' needs are not entirely neglected. But I also think that the player's need don't always correspond with what he [i]thinks[/i] he needs . . .

That is a key element, because otherwise you can't avoid unhappy players.  By "pretty well balanced," I mean no skill is grossly overpowered, though some skills might be too weak.  But I do think that the quality and enjoyment of the game should take precedence over tweaking it later on.  There must be some sort of continuity.  Each stage of balancing the game after release should change the game by smaller amounts than the previous stage*.  If each patch is checked intelligently, this shouldn't be too much of a problem.  It was a huge problem in D2 though.<P>I am beginning to think this should have been posted in Development Discussions too...I wonder if they can/will move it?<P>-Darnal<P>*That's the ideal, I think.</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Wyll</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ahh...<P>To change or not to change; my favorite question!<P>I'll try to simplify the heck out of this... Changes are great so long as the end goal is the creation of a better overall playing experience.  Some points to keep in mind (a lot of this may sound old):<P>1.  Nerfing - Anyone with a nerfed skill, item or character will at worst scream bloody murder and at best snicker "about time" under their breath.  However, it's needed.  Are developers to leave an unbalanced skills, items or characters alone just because it took a long time for people to earn them?  I agree with Arhu completely on the knife analogy.. And if you want really bad adjustment examples just think back to Ultima Online (the level a minute and flame retardent clothing patches are two easy examples) and suddenly the changes to Diablo II are wonderfully conceived and executed by comparison.<P>2.  Better OVERALL Playing Experience - This means that, if playing the game start to finish after the patch is a better experience, they've succeeded.  The goal shouldn't be to protect the playing experience for the vast MINORITY of loyal enthusiasts.  After all, the truly loyal will give the changes a shot and actually LIKE them if they acheive the goal improving the overall experience.  <P>Are the changes in D2 a success?  I don't think it can be ascertained yet until all the affected classes have had a chance to be tested and played across a full life cycle.. In another week or so I think we'll see new strategies develop and I'm sure we'll hear from the die-hards what they think of their new hammerdins, spearazons and maybe some newly named creations as to how effective they are and wether or not the playing experience has been improved... I hope for Blizzard's sake they aren't going around making unjustifiable changes....<P>Oh.. and if at all possible Blizzard should give consideration to the characters who were devestated by these changes... <P>Wyll-<BR> </FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Arhu</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aye, Dar, that's true for MUDs even more than for any other game. And due to the fact that  <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/div.gif"> is no MUD (yet?), they have all the time they need to get the balancing right.  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Wyll: Yeah, in the end, it's all about nerfing. As I said I'm normally not against late balancing, but at the same time I can understand the frustration of dismayed players. D2 is a special case, I remember how long it took me to reach Lvl. 34 (where I stopped) with my bowazon, and can scarcely imagine how much time real players have invested in developing their characters. Nerfing the general public is quite ok, cos they wouldn't really notice it (assuming relatively low level characters), nerfing the loyal fanbase without any kind of compensation, however, is <I>bad</I>. Blizzard was a little too harsh, imo. Continuously beating your own, most loving children is for sure going to backfire someday.<P>Oh, they can move the topic, but they have to bring themselves to do that first, so I don't think it will happen.  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P><I>Meow...</I><BR>Arhu</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
