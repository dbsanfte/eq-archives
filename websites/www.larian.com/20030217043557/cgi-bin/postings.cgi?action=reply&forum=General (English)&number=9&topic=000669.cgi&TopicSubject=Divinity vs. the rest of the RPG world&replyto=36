<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=20 COLS=75 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Gezza:
[I]My fave games (in no order)
Based on the fun factor at the time that I played the game. Lufia ranks higher than Planescape in my list, but obviously does not mean that it is actually a better game.

* BG1 & 2 + expansions
Just something about it, a great sense of adventure. BG2 is the ONLY RPG that I've finished more than once, 4 times in fact. Well I did finish Diablo 2 more than once, but that doesn't really count, because you're supposed to, to get any enjoyment from the game.

* FFVII
One of the first RPG's I've ever played, and have been absolutely hooked on them ever since. This is storytelling at its finest. I almost cried in some parts of this game, no joke.

* Diablo 1 & 2
Well Diablo 1 was THE first RPG that I played and I gotta mention this game because it started it all for me. It's a simple hack and slash but I have absolutely no problems about this and I don't get why people hate it so much considering that the game doesn't really try to pretend to be anything that it's not.

* Crono Trigger
A very enjoyable Anime RPG. Great way to handle a time travelling storyline, memorable NPC's and cool tech skills as well.

* Secret of Mana 2 (Seiken Densetsu 3)
Another excellent Anime RPG. I was simply hooked on this game for months. Loved the class system.

* Lufia 
This game contains my favourite soundtracks from any RPG except for FF7, especially the 'Fortress of Doom' track. The game is simple, too simple in fact cause I think it was one of the first RPG's ever made on the SNES. I thought the storyline was excellent. I loved the way that you play the 4 orignal heroes in the prelude, then when the game starts you play as their descendent and actually get to meet some of the original heroes later on.

Games I thought were OK to Pretty good (but not my fave)

* Summoner
Pretty decent game with no annoying flaws. Very linear gameplay but I guess the storyline instills a sense of urgency so when you play the game you feel like getting tasks done ASAP. A bit underated

* Neverwinter Nights
This game was a bit of a disappointment, but that was mainly because I had such high hopes for it. No major flaws again, but the single player campaign was very ordinary.

* Icewind Dale
Hack n Slash AD&D style. Fun, but I prefer the NPC interaction of BG1 & 2.

* Planescape
A lot of people are probably going to tell me that I'm crazy for not putting this in my fave list. Well, I'm not disputing that Planescape could be one of the greatest games of all time but this is MY list and Planescape just wasn't as fun to me as the BG series. I like a little bit more combat in my RPG's, but I did manage to finish the game and I can say it's a good game.

* Nox
A nice little title that in all honesty sort of has a different style to all other RPG's that I've played. This game plays like one of those 2D side scrolling fighter games (like the Arcade D&D game). You would probably have to call this an action game in which you can level up, as action-RPG doesn't sound quite right. The comedic and humorous storyline is refreshing as well. Multiplayer aspect is also pretty fun.

Games that I just could not get into...

* Lufia 2 (prequel)
This was such a shame...as I played it straight after Lufia 1 when I was really into the storyline. Many aspects make this game a more complex RPG than the origial which is good cause Lufia 1 was simply too...simplistic? (Yes, my vocab is simplistic, er..I mean..simple...DAMN!). But the damn puzzles in this game put me right off.

* Silver
Anime style RPG made by a non-Japanese company if I recall correctly. This game levels you up at particular stages of the game, so you don't really feel like you're gaining levels on your own merit. There just wasn't anything special in it to keep my attention.

* Wizardry 8
I TRIED to like this game...I really did, but it was just too hard for me. Maybe I'm an RPG n00b, I dunno but some battles would last up to 15 minutes and I just don't have that much time, it got incredibly frustrating after a while. Looks like it would be a great RPG though...if it just wasn't so damn hard.

* Arcanum
I will probably try to restart this game. The first time I tried, I was simply overwhelmed by the amount of options for character creation. This actually put me off a bit because I wanted to make sure that I made the best choices so that I wouldn't end up with a crappy character. I guess that's one of the reasons I love the BG series and anime RPG's. When you level up, all your bonuses are automatically updated so you don't have to choose anything. But obviously a degree of customisation such as allocating skills and stat points in games like Diablo is also cool. But in Arcanum...just too many things for me to contemplate!

Games I don't know how to rank!!!

* Morrowind
I played this game non-stop from start to finish. Like others have experienced I have a love-hate relationship with this game. I am totally astounded by the first person 3d environment and the freedom in which I am able to explore the world. It truly is amazing and you have to play it to know exactly what I'm talking about. You think you have freedom of exploration in Divine Divinity? You ain't seen nothing yet until you play Morrowind, and that one is a 3d world. Sometimes I find myself standing still and simply stare at buildings, sky, mountains, trees...etc, it is really that immersive. However...I hate...well hate is a strong word. I 'dislike' a lot of things about Morrowind. I won't go into detail but some things are...NPC's seem too generic, poor leveling system, poor combat system, no sense of fullfillment from doing quests (I felt like I was completing quests simply to say that I played most of the game), a ridiculously small selection of monsters to fight (you will be figthing exactly the same things at level 50 than you were at level 1), uninspiring weapons (you make your own...you don't actually find good weapons), game is way too easy after about level 20. So basically I find the ENTIRE RPG aspect of Morrowind very poor indeed (except for freedom of expliration). Having said this and being an avid RPG gamer playing a game with awful RPG elements, I was still totally addicted to this game for weeks. The reason? Simple...because like I said before, the environment is simply first class. Think about it, if the graphics and immersiveness alone can keep me hooked on a game and cause me to forget all the things that I hate about it, then you must begin to understand just how amazing this one aspect of the game is. I'm trying to envision the RPG elements of something like BG2 incorporated in a seamless 3d world such as that of Morrowind....*DROOL*.

* Fallout 2
Well I'm sort of ashamed to say this, but when I first got this game I cheated. Downloaded a Save editor and essentially finished the game in God mode. Now that I'm a more serious gamer, I'm trying to replay it legitimately. However since this game is pretty old, and I've actually played it before...I find it hard to get into. It really is a great game though...

Gezza

PS: Personally, Divine Divinity probably ranks just outside my fave games. But then again, a couple of games I put in that category were mainly because of nostalgia and sentimental value...such as my first RPG's...etc.  [/I][/QUOTE]
