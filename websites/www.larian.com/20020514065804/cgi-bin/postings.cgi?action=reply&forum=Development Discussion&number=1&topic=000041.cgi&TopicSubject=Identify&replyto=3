<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=20 COLS=75 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by lar:
[I]Well, it toke me less time to implement than to write the idea here  ;) The identify skill is one which you need to learn, the monologue does not pop up when there is 'anybody' in your neighbourhood, but rather when there is a calm moment, and I must say that for me, it works well.  Basically it goes like this, you enter cavern, suddenly some zombies pop up (the dig themselves out of the ground), you fight with them or run away (they are zombies and therefore tough buggers), and when you are in a calm area (or one where you killed everything that moved  ;) ), the monologue box comes up where the player says something to himself. Seems to works well for the involvement of the player, but of course play testing will have to say so. In any case, you have to chose to learn it, so it's up to you if you want it or not. Will be useful though.

Further, your ideas are not so farfetched Arhu, nor do they belong in a dream.  Actually, most of what you wrote is already implemented  ;) Let me give you some idea of how my monster AI system works, and some examples of what it does. After all, with all of the delays for the screenshots I have to make up a bit  ;) Before starting though, you are aware that the name Lar and hence the name Larian Studios comes from my favourite dog of all times who was called...Lar  ;) Just so that we understand each other  ;)  ;)  ;)

Monsters,npcs, player characters, for me they are all agents, so if I use the term agent I mean any of these.  The agent system (or as it is called in the game, the agent manager), runs a series of agents which are somewhere in the world. Each agent has a micro script which contains details about what it is supposed to do. This what it is supposed to do can be story related, but it can also be AI related.  Usually it is something like, when not a slave of the story system, behave like this.  The behave like this component is of course the thing we're interested in when it comes to fights.  The agent system differentiates between three types of behavior:

a) Group behavior
b) Individual non fight behavior
c) Individual fight behavior

Group behaviour is the most powerful, because suggestion of intelligence always comes better when there is communication involved, for instance my idea of the lever mentioned in the previous message.  For one agent to switch of the lever, it would mean that a group of agents decide which agent will switch the lever, and which agents will follow the player into the room. (It also means that they are aware of the fact that it is a closed room, of what the deployment is of the group etc...) 

b) Individual non fight behavior comes into play when an agent is not part of a group, or when the group tells the agent it doesn't have anything specific for him to do.

c) Individual fight behavior then is how the agent should fight. For instance, strike, move away until recovered from striking, strike again, or shoot, seek cover, shoot and so forth...


To illustrate this, take the advanced skeletons (I call them advanced now because they are my test subjects, and they're getting all the AI power I can muster from the engine) :

Thus spoke the skeleton lord:

Our job is to lurk the mortals into an ambush. For this purpose we will roam the dungeon, while not strolling too far away from each other, but far enough so that if somebody sees one of us, he will not see the others.  When one of us sees an enemy, we will act stupidly and just pretend our nose is bleeding, though that might be a bit hard for we have no blood &lt;skeleton laugh&gt;.  If the enemy catches on to us, we run as fast as we can, gently guiding the enemy in the direction of our group. Once we regrouped and the enemy hasn't seen our group yet, one of us makes some noise, just to make sure he'll get the general direction.  If he comes close enough, we will swarm around him, still holding our distance. When we have properly encircled him, those of you who have bows will take a good shot, while the rest of you scum will jump on him, hitting him as hard as possible. I guarantee you that this strategy will decimate the mortals, for I used to apply it when I was still a mortal.

&lt;Skeleton raises skeletal hand&gt;

How come you're one of us then ?

&lt;Skeleton that raised hand gets smashed into pieces by skeleton lord&gt;

The above scenario is actually running in the game, and works quite well for suggesting intelligence. You also get to deal with coordinated effort, and it can be quite painful. (I had to make the skeletons weaker after I implemented it, that's how good it works  ;) )

Now, extend it with 

&lt;skeleton lord continues&gt;

Where was I ? Ah yes, if there is a cell nearby, I'd like you to prepare your ambush there. One of you should seek cover, and wait until the mortal walked into our trap. Once he does, LOCK the door...

&lt;skeleton laughter klikklikklik&gt;

Of course, once you've been the victim of something like this, you'll start being very careful, for more than likely it will have meant the end of your hero (unless you were packed with potions). You will start using your recon spells with which you can check what's ahead of you, listen more closely to the sounds you hear, and in general try to get that perception value up so that you can see more of your environment. But, it would be boring if the advanced skeletons keep on doing the same thing, so ...

&lt;skeleton lord continues, is still laughing&gt;

klikklikklikharharklikklikcoughcough... Right, our evil lord has granted us much riches, and we must guard them very well. Those of you that are assigned guard duty, WILL NOT LEAVE your positions at all. If you do, I'll come break your bones. When under attack, keep the enemy busy while one of you gets help. Understood !

One of the nice things about the agent system is that different types of behavior can be assigned to the same agent class. So you don't have "This is how a group of skeletons behave, this is how a group of ghouls behave", but rather a mix of behaviors per agent class.  Some of these behaviors are also prescripted for story purposes (for instance somewhere in the story there is a patrol of orcs in a place where there shouldn't be orcs, why are they here. The orcs are under orders to keep low profile so once they spot you they'll do their very best to stop you)

The individual fight behavior then allows to differentiate between the behaviors of the same membes of a group. For instance, the more intelligent ones will run away, grab some potion, maybe even take the treasure they are guarding and so on. 

The net result of all of this is a very varied walk through the dungeon, filled with surprises. I'm really trying to create something where you don't just "drink potion, kill, drink potion, kill, drink potion kill", though if you have enough potions you can do anything of course. Rather, I'm trying to give you the immersion that when you need to reach something well protected, it is indeed well protected as our skeleton lord example illustrates (which if I didn't write it yet, and given this small edit field, it's hard to check or I lose everything, rat please ?, is implemented)

What I want to say actually, is that I'm very interested in the types of ideas arhu just mentioned, as I have quite a flexible system for this fighting AI, and something which you might consider hard to implement, might actually be easy under the system we're using. 

If I mistyped the password now, I'll hit the machine  ;)
