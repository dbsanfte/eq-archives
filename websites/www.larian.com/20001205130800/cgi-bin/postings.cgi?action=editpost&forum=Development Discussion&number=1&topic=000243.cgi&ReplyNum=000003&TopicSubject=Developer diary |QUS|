<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">As most on this forum know, we're not following the typical business model for developing a game. For reference, the typical model usually consists of the following steps :

1) Get some funding from whatever source
2) Make a design doc
3) Make a prototype/demo
4) Show it to some guy at some publishing firm
5) Get the funding to actually make the game
6) Make the game
7) Let the publisher take care of all the rest (including your profits and your intellectual rights  ;) )

Needless to say step 5) is where it goes awry for most developers, and it in a lot of cases it also heralds the end of yet another good idea. 

What we did was,

1) Get some funding from whatever source
2) Make the game
3) Repeat from step 1) until the game is very advanced
4) Find distributors/publishers for specific territories, meanwhile still taking care of step 3) 
5) Maintain control over most things related to the game

Somehow we managed to actually do this, but to all who contemplate doing the same thing, forget it. You really don't want to do it this way. I can tell you stories you wouldn't believe  ;) Use the typical model.

Anyway, we're now in step 4) and making good progress with that. We're actually even signing things (which means I get to sit on the plane a lot, something I hate), and when all the legal stuff is taken care of, we'll announce who will distribute/market  :div: in what territory. For those worrying, you'll be pleased to learn that a lot of money will be spent on the marketing of  :div:.

Anyway, within the month I guess we'll be confident that  :div: will actually hit the retail shelves everywhere, we'll also be sure that everybody will learn what  :div: is, so that's something we don't have to worry about anymore.

Onto the technical side then: Unfortunately we still have a lot of work. We've now been working on  :div: for a little bit more than a year, and I have to say that I'm rather pleased with the engine. If I compare it to our main competitors (Diablo/BG) I don't think we have to blush, and I think that our engine is in many aspects superior. It still needs some tweaking here and there, and it needs the occasional additional feature, but in general, it's pretty good. But now, now we have to put a soul in that engine, and that is much more work than we had anticipated.  

I think we have a pretty good idea of the amount of content that needs to be in a RPG in order to make it really good. The problem is that our definition implies a huge amount of content, and of course, somebody has to put that content in. To our dismay (though in hindsight, we could have expected this), it turned out that the editors we had been developing in the last year, are not up to the task of rapidly adding content. At least, not rapid enough. To give you an idea, there are currently 4000 individual object types in  :div:. Each of these objects have approximately between 100 to 200 properties that need to be edited. Taking the lowest amount (which is not the case for say 20% of the objects), that means there are about 400000 properties which need to be edited for the objects alone, and then they're not even in the game yet. We currently have a lot of bugs which are caused by misediting of the properties in the objects, and the main reason for that is that while our object property editor does its job, it's not easy enough to operate. And those are just the object properties, I won't even start talking about the monsters and the npcs.

This content editing problem (the fact that we can do all of it, but it doesn't go fast enough) is what we are working on now. We're churning out updated editors which automate as much tasks as possible, so that we can focus on what's really important, namely putting in the gameplay. But this updating of the editors does take its time, especially since there's just so much that has to be edited.  :div: allows the player to do really a lot of things in the gameworld, and somewhere along the line, someone has to tell the engine what the result is of all these interactions. 

I guess that apart of the fact that editing the data is not always super-easy, the biggest problem with the content editing is the fact that a lot of the data is relational. Change something here, and it immediately affects something else. Change the weight of a sword, and its possible that some monsters can't be carrying that sword anymore (Editors need to check this). But sometimes it goes deeper : As an example, take a test we had with Bean (forum member) yesterday. He picked up kitty, the everything-that-walks-on-four-legs-killing cat, and she happily killed some rabbits for him. Consequently he stripped the meat from those rabbits, and in general thought kitty was doing a pretty good job. Then however, by accident, he passed Otho's famous pig farm. Kitty saw the pigs, rushed off, and killed the pigs. Otho got in a rage (operating under the rule, if npc kills my pets, I kill the npc) and Bean (level 1 character) suddenly saw himself confronted with someone throwing tons of fireballs after his head. Cool on itself, but undesired. (At least in the village where the player starts the game, and where we want to keep things simple)

So we're learning. We're learning that it's not only important to have an engine that is capable of doing a lot of stuff, it's also at least as important to be able to edit that stuff in a way which catches a lot of bugs upfront. On top of that, that editor has to be extremely user-friendly. It was an oversight that we didn't realize this early enough, and as a result of course, we suffer a delay. Of course, we could've gone ahead and use the editors we had, and just put in less content, but that's not really an option, given that we want this game to be very very good.

Talking about learning, we're also learning a lot about testing the game. We frequently invite people (or have people who invite themselves  ;) ) to come and test the game. So far I think we've been very lucky. Most of the testers came from the forum, and as you're all quite an intelligent bunch, the feedback we get is often very well thought out. Nontheless, more than often, the feedback of one tester is in direct conflict with that of others.  We're learning how to find the balance.

And then of course, we have the usual problems. Windows/driver bugs every programmer in the world complains about, stupid mistakes through which we lose a lot of time, heated debates about very small features on which everybody seems to have an opinion, stress moments in the team due to working long hours in a confined space, impossible deadlines for tradeshows/presentations, press guys who all want exclusives, too much work, too little time, and so forth... But all in all, we're managing, and it's fun to see the game come together, and to see people test it, and actually enjoying themselves. And that makes it worth it.
