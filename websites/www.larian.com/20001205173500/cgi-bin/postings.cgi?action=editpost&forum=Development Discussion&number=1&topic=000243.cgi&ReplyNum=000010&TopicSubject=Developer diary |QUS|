<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Hi Lar,
here is what I have in mind. It's not perfect, but it tries to use your (current) controls to some extent and those of Diablo plus a bit more because of the need to combine objects and use spells on objects.

In Diablo you can only use objects that are in your inventory. To use them you right click on them. You can't cast a spell while the mouse pointer is over an object in the inventory. Doors can be opened/closed with the left click.

To avoid using -or- picking up objects during a fight they should not be used or picked up by left clicking on them. I would differ between objects that can't be used on their own, objects which can only be used once and objects which you can turn on and off.

Doors, windows, candles, torches, levers can be opened/closed, lighted/extinguished or pushed/pulled. Buttons can be pushed multiple times. (Some levers or buttons may be limited to using them once... but I still would put them in this category.) These should be used (togled on/off) by a left click.
Food, potions can be used only once (eat/drink). Don't use it with a left click.
Stones, Swords, Armor, etc. can't be used on their own. (If you want to use them you will need to equip them or use them on other objects.) You can't use them, so do nothing with them.

o left click on
- ground: Walk there.
- object: (Try to) walk there. Do as if you clicked on ground below object.
+ ALT: Pick object up. (Or drop it if object is in the inventory.)
+ CTRL: Destroy object.
- toggle object: Activate/deactivate.
+ ALT: Pick up if possible.
+ CTRL: Destroy object. (Knock on door if weapon is put away -or- smash door if you have a weapon drawn.)
- friend: Walk to him and talk. (Don't put weapon away if you have it drawn.)
- enemy: Walk to him and attack. (Switch to attack mode.)
- icon: Chooses the active spell/skill. (Casting is done with right click.)

o left drag
- ground: Walk in that direction. (Run if mouse pointer is near screen border.)
- object: Move object if you move (drag) the mouse, otherwise walk in that direction (only hold down left mouse button). Once the mouse pinter is off the initial object, you can move the mouse to change the direction you walk in.
- object on object: Place object ontop of object.
- object on character/inventory-bar: Pick object up if possible.
- object on npc: Give object to npc. (If it's an enemy you could throw object (explosive potion). But maybe you should use right drag to throw.)
- icon: Do nothing. You have clicked on the icon by accident and don't want anything to happen.
+ CTRL, ALT or SHIFT?: Move icon on screen.

o right click on
- ground: Only cast spell that dosn't need a target. (Not the best solution. see below *)
- object lying on ground: Cast spell/use skill that affects object -or- cast spell that doesn't need a target (global spell/skill). This is how you use "pick lock".
- object in inventory: Use object if you can use it on it's own.
- npc: Cast spell/use skill that affect npc -or- global spells.
- friend: Only spells where friend benefits.
+ CTRL: You may harm friend. (eg. steal something from friendly npc.)
- enemy: Only spells that harm enemy.
- icon: Casts spell/uses skill on target. (You need this to cast spells on objects in your inventory, but it can also be used on npc's or objects in the world.)

o right drag
- ground: ??? Draw a spell? Protective circle around you. Straight wall in front of you. (This could come into conflict with right drag object.)
- object: Move a transparent image of the object (if you drop it, this image vanishes).
- object on object: Use the first object on the second object.
- object on character/inventory-bar: Use object directly from the ground. ie. drink potion.
- object on friend: Tell him to [b]use[/b] object (drink potion) and not only take it.
- object on enemy: Throw object at enemy.
- on npc: ??? Do nothing
- icon: Do nothing. You have clicked on the icon by accident and don't want anything to happen.

o move mouse without holding a button pressed
- CAPS-LOCK deactivated: Move mouse pointer. (wow!)
+ SHIFT: Scroll screen when mouse pointer is at edge of screen. (Jumps back to character if SHIFT is released.)
- CAPS-LOCK activated: Scroll screen when mouse pointer is at edge of screen. (Screen stays there until CAPS-LOCK is deactivated.)
+ SHIFT: Screen jumps back to character.

*)
This leaves a few special cases or problems:
- "right click on object in inventory: Use object if you can use it on it's own." You can't cast a spell while the mouse pointer is over an object in your inventory. Thus you need to right click on the spell icon to activate the spell and then target the object. (The mouse pointer should change.)
- When right clicking -and- a combat spell/skill is chosen, the nearest enemy should be targeted. This is to avoid not being able to cast a spell while mouse pointer is over object, ground or friend. (The same goes for nice spells on enemies.)
- When right clicking -and- spell/skill that manipulates objects is chosen, the nearest object should be targeted. This is to avoid not being able to cast a spell while mouse pointer is over a npc or the ground.

What I like about this modified interface is:
- You can use drag -or- click to walk without switching between modes. This is nice for players used to one (Diablo, BG) or the other (NOX).
- You have very few conflicts while fighting or walking. (No picking up or using of objects.)
- left mouse button only [b]moves[/b]: walk, run, move objects, move weapon (attack - Okay, this one doesn't fit  ;))
- right mouse button only [b]uses[/b]: cast spells, use skill, use object, combine objects
- the most comon things (besides picking up objects) are easy to acomplish.

It is hard to pick up an item with this system. If a new player tries to pick up an item he will notice that left clicking on it will not do anything. After a few tries you could bring up a message box that says: "Try to pull the item to your character/inventory-bar -or- use ALT+left-click to pick up something." If he drags the object to the character a few times you could bring up a message box: "Using ALT+left-click also picks up something."

But as you said you need to test it. (And when I have time I will come and test it  ;)) But please also make sure that the interface is suited for hectic situations and avoids accidentaly doing the wrong thing easily. It is good if you learn the controls quickly/intuitive but they also have to be playable in the long run.

In the version I played it took me quite (too) long to learn the controls... but it was okay playing with them once I knew how to.

ps. Maybe only torches that are atached to a wall should be lighted/extinguished with a left click. Otherwise you light a torch that lies on the ground. Hmmm... don't know. But this would require more editing to be done and different behaviour for torches on the wall and ground... So it's probably not good.
