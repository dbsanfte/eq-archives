<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=20 COLS=75 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Thanks Lar for giving us more insight into what you have in mind.

Comments to each of the basic values and their purpose follow:

Strength:

-How much can you carry
(You mean, how much you can carry before you are unable to walk, right? You might also have a separate how much you can lift, if you have any use for it in the game.)

-How much can you carry before you can't run anymore
(Makes sense.)

-What can you wear
(Is it separate from how much you can carry, and if so why? Of course you would be right that a stronger character has less difficulty in wielding a heavy sword, but it would sound strange if you couldn’t wear a 20kg armor, if that is the weight you can carry and you otherwise carry nothing else.)

-What is your recovery time when fighting with melee weapons
(Is this similar to my heavy sword example, or is it connected to endurance or stamina which might be a separate basic value, since it is different from strength. You might be a strong person who quickly runs out of breath, just as you might be a weak character who can fight forever. Could make for some interesting fights...)

-Bonus to both attack and defense
(Is this just related to the amount of damage you can do or take?)

-Direct influence on your hitpoints
(If this is what I think it is, then the above has to be different at least for the "bonus to defense".)

-Direct influence on your armorclass
(You mean someone could have such muscles that it would be difficult to get a knife past his/her skin? But then again many games have done so...)


Intelligence:

-Direct influence on your mana pool
(Just as it has always been done.)

-Influence on your trading skills
(Hmmm... if you have running, jumping, lifting, or anything requiring physical activity strength and/or endurance might have an influence too.)

-Influence on dialogs, you are easier able to detect a lie 
-Hints from your character
-Understanding of things you find
(So basically anything requiring something I haven’t got...)
	
-Direct influence on your spellcasting abilities (the skill level of spells raises more rapidly)
(Or any skill for that matter, right?)

(Further comments: You might (if more bananas is an option...) divide intelligence into the following subcategories:
1) Overall or General Knowledge: How familiar you are with new things you interact with.
2) Learning Ability: Ease in learning skills and spells.
3) Memorization: Can you keep what you have learned or “swallowed” during the course of the game and for how long. (Hopefully there are things such as maps, paper, pencil...)
4) Abstract Thinking: Since you will probably let us solve puzzles on our own, you could restrict it to correlation of concepts you and I have no clue about (e.g. you make them up in which case only we have no clue...). It should draw from General Knowledge and things memorized during the course of the game.


Dexterity:

-Direct influence on your bow accuracy
(Or any ranged weapon, right? Represents how calm you can keep your fingers, hands, arms...)

-Direct influence on your attack and defense
(I guess it represents how quick you can react, for which there might be a separate initiative attribute.)

-Direct influence on your recovery times
(related to endurance/fitness?)

-More chance of avoiding traps
(But detecting them requires perception and intelligence (or knowledge in my case), right?)

-Better chance of successfully manipulating items in the world.
(Like being able to put things together (which might draw from intelligence too))

-Weapons and armor deteriorate less rapidly as you are able to tend them well
(So basically automatic armor and weapons repair or is it connected to being tidy, organized, and caring? Hmmm... discipline might be an attribute (just kidding).)


Perception

-You find more stuff
(Such as gold, traps, aliens... (no wait, please no aliens!!!!))

-Better sight and hearing ranges
(I concur.)

-Influence on dialogs, you are better able to detect a lie
(All you have to do is determine how important intelligence vs. perception is for any given conversation...)

-Better prices in trade (you are able to discern fakes)
(Hmmm... for trade I smell charisma, intelligence, and perception. Trade is indeed very complex... wait strength and/or power might be a factor too. Oh my!)


Charisma

-You can do more "wrong" things
(Such as be bad and still be liked, or leave your sword at home...)

-Better trade
(No comment.)

-Higher chance of npcs helping you in fight
(Hmmm... such as individuals among a crowd of people coming for the rescue? How about also being able to stop a fight through speech?)

-You get more info
(I see; James Bond phenomena...)

-Direct influence on dialogs
(Similar to the above I guess.)

Phew, I’m exhausted... time to take a nap. Till next time...</TEXTAREA>
