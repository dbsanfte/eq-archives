[I]Ok KnightWolf,

You're missing the point of this type of rpg. You seem to want fewer options and the ability to from point A to point B without any bumps in the road. Diablo seems just right for you (if you want to run around with potions all day). In this game, there is an emphasis on leveling your character and figuring out all of the special goodies Larian added for our benefit.

Run out of potions? Use alchemy. No alchemy? Eat some meat. No meat? Kill a bunnie...

Not powerful enough? Hunt anything you can kill. I was level 8 before I started the 2nd level of the catacombs. How? I went on an orc killing spree outside the town once I was level 3. This game gives you so many choices and options. It's not made for someone who wants to rely on potions all day. There are many choices one has to make in this game and if you take the time to understand it, the game won't be too difficult for you.

And about not remembering to save your game... I swear, can you not take responsibility for your own actions? That's not Larian's fault. This game is a thinkers game in many aspects. If you can't handle it, play tetris or something.

I like the game play and interface and maps. Its all the minor problems that make me walk away with frustrated. So here is what I think is wrong and needs to be corrected.<P> Healing theres not enough healing potions in the game. Especially after you leave Anoth to go to barracks. You can find them if you want to spend 3 hours just looking for some NPC that might have one or two.<BR> Saving in this game sucks. I dont know about you guys but when I get caught up in doing something last thing im gone think about doing is saving ever 5 min then when you do die you dont just pop back up some were and just go back to were you were you have to reload the game. Which sucks if you have completed a lot. They need either one put in Autosave in to the game or two they should made it so you spawned back up some were. Better to lose a little bit of exp and money then to lose an hours worth of work.<BR> 3 some of the mobs in this game are way to frigen hard. I got all the way to Giant Heavy orcs and Then every thing else after that was impossible to beat. So I started over still same problem. They need to put more balance in with Monstes in areas. Putting in a Boss that makes me burn through 7 potions which are as slim to none in this game is to me an act of stupidity on the game makers part.<BR> In sort if your thinking about buying this game dont wast your time not unless you like spending hours on end loading and saving which take forever to begin with. Unless you like facing things that are way to powerful to beat (heck some of big bad guys in catacombs make Diablo look like a walk in the park.) then I wouldnt wast your time playing this game its more fruastrating then any thing else. Me im gone go back to EQ and sell this game back to game store and then sit back and wait for Blizzard to make another Diablo cause there the only ones that have made an RPG game I like and though was well designed every thing else sucked.</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Damar Stiehl</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">My friend, here's a goldpiece; buy yourself a big, shiny clue.<P>------------------<BR>The willing of <B>the Three</B><BR>Builds <B>One</B> of large degree,<BR>You've no power to use it,<BR>And in the end of it all you'll lose it,<BR>And so I do decree...</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">KingPinn</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">[QUOTE]Originally posted by knightwolf78753:<BR>[I]Ok I just wanted to give my little review and I hope the company that makes this game is reading.

I have just started the game over maybe thinking my stats were messed up for a warrior. Still im having the same problems. like right now im level 10 or so and im at the abby trying to kill every thing there. Now Ive gotten through most of the stuff with no problems. I just beat the conjure. Now the thing thats kicking my butt and have no idea how to beat is the Steal Guards I think there called. now you talk about healing but correct me if im wrong but having heal potions to save your butt from dying is part of the game. Now normally i would use the old Diablo trick were  port to town and get a heal and then port back and contuinue fighting but when you do this mob is full healed to. Now running out of health potions and not using the Diablo 2 tactic presents a sort of a problem. O and running some times doesnt do a damn bit of good cause they will still chase you down and drive there sword through your heart. <BR> Now as far as saving its not that I dont have a problem saving the problem is the fact that when I get caught up in to the game I forget to save now sense I dont know what lurks around every corner and how hard the mob is I cant always anticapate whats coming. It really sucks losing 30 min worth of work heck even 15 min worth of work. Especially if you just got done moving through a whole lot of nastys that were some what of a challange. <BR> Now you talk about potions and mixing them well seeing how I dont know how to do that and the game doesnt tell you how I didnt know about it and I cant read the larian minds as far as what they put in the game. <BR> To me the game is off balance as far as save and healing and gold is concerened. Im flat broke right now with heal potions that suck cause of how high my con is. Yes normally there ok but when I have a big bad guy that can kill me in 4 or 5 hits those potions dont do squat. <BR> O and dont tell me this game is not like Diablo cause its plays so much like it that it almost seems like diablo 2. I played Diablo 2 for almost sense it came out. I have yet to come accross an RPG that could match Diablo 2 this game has come close to being as good as Diablo 2 but not totally.</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">lost soul</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">First off night,dont whine because u got a pirated copy of the game and u dont know how to play it since u have no manual.Another thing if your at level 10 you havent really been anywhere yet to say this game is unbalanced.its not that hard to stay healed but yet i dont think like i said ,your going to get help since you didnt buy the game.People like you that cheat a copy of the game is why games are so expensive to begin with,so dont come in here asking people for help that your basically stealing from.</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Erana</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Don't be such a wimp dude. At only level 10 what do you expect? Where would the challenge be if you're able to get through everything "Diablo style" i.e. hack and slash - drink potion - hack and slash - drink potion - (repeat steps ad infinitum).<BR>The game gives you challenge and encourages you to figure out other alternatives, because there's lots of it. Not enough potion? use your level 2 alchemy to make some your own. Hunt rabbit and kill cows for meat. Monster too hard? Keep your distance and use long range attack such as bow and arrow. Or use embrace shadow skill and stab the enemy from the back. Use summon vermin to keep it busy with rat attack while you shoot fire ball from a distance. Use stun skill to stun your enemy and hack when the monster is immobilized.<BR>Thing is, different enemies requires different approaches to beat. That's why  you are provided with skill points.

I feel that some quests might have been restricted by level and not just, say, reputation.  I know it seems most folks here like the open-endedness and the experimentation but it's frustrating at times to be given a quest you have no hope of finishing at your current level only to travel across the world in search of your goal and to be crushed outright upon arriving.  Level restrictions ("I'd ask you to help but I'm afraid you just don't seem up to the challenge just yet.") would alleviate this.  Let the level range be fairly broad so that it's still possible if you pick up the quest on the early end it'll be tough but not impossible with proper tactics.<P>Otherwise, to paraphrase a review I read somewhere this is the game I wish Diablo II had been.  Yes, it is fairly challenging early on and even though I've only made my way to level 19 I've had a huge amount of fun in a world that really seems to be alive.  I feel that with food and alchemy thrown in there's just about enough healing but not so much that you're leaving potions lying around as you're too lazy to pick them up.  I'm currently a warrior who has focused almost exclusively on warrior skills but with a few rogue skills thrown in and of course the Restoration spell.  It seems to me you really can make the class you want to play with this system and this is just about the most fun I've had in ages.</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Templar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by knightwolf78753:<BR>[I]<BR> 3 some of the mobs in this game are way to frigen hard.

They are many different viable stratagies for playing this game, but in this game you actually to have to use a stratgies. You can't just expect every type of creature to be defeated by the same tactic. The first time I went in the Abby, I was level 11 and the ghosts instantly killed me and I thought, I'll never be able to clear this place out! I went back in at level 17 and the poison skill and a powerful weapon and found out I could take a ghost out in 1-3 swings. I went into the sewers at level 17 and thought no problem, but a lizard instantly took me out. Now I'm level 26 and I still have to be carefull but I can clean out the area with my trusty pet Steal Death Scorpian (just one cast of the Deadly Gift and on cast of the Aura of Command and you have a friend for life). I still have to use a combination of stealth (I'm a survivor), running, freezing guys, fighting with my powerful Ax, and my bow healing myself with Restoration, or a quick nibble on some meat or a potion of Restoration, and even resort to a potion of Shadow when I am trapped. OK, that's a lot of stuff, and a lot of ways of dealing with situations, but only a small percentage of the options available. I love the fact that there are so many ways of dealing around situations. I get board when I master one tactic and I'm always looking for new ones. And believe me I am not a great roleplayer by any means.</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">paddyjack</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Myself I found that game amazing for the possibilities you can do. I'm still early in the game, at level 15. I think that Knightwolf's opinion was biased because he went to the Abbey so fast. Myself I looked at the map and it was written "very dangerous" for the Abbey, so I decided to postpone my goinf there. This is what you should do. Of course, some games like Diablo send you to one dungeon after another, so you face monsters balanced to fit your skill level. But the point of DD is to explore where your skill level allow you to (just like many other RPG btw).<P>As for potions, well if you explore where you are skilled enough to do so, then you hardly need these potions. I have something like 20 of healing and mana in my inventory right now, and I do not have alchemy skill.<P>But if you still do not like the game, well you are entitled to your opinion!<P>Paddyjack<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Drathen</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I love the game so far, I'm level 17/18 (I forget which), kicking around Verdistis.  My only complaint is that magic potions are so rare.  When I *have* mana, I can really kick ass as my mage, but once the teleporter stones are gone, its hard to replenish mana (with a max mana of 350, it takes a ton of potions just to be able to get your mana up to half).<P>Herbs being more common would have been nice...<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Fashtas</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Drathen, a suggestion<P>Alchemy skill 1 allows you to combine potions together<P>1 small restoration potion can be made with 1 small heal and 1 small mana potion<P>1 small mana potion restores a tiny amount of mana (Sometimes I don't even notice the bar move)<P>1 small restoration potion will probably replenish your ENTIRE pool of 350 mana. Even at 1000+ mana a small restoration restores almost 70% of my mana pool<P> <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Drathen</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Yeah, I saw some earlier threads on restoration potions.

You need to try it... <P>You'll go from 20 to 40 mana potions to full regen your mana to 1<P>As I said, at 1000+ mana, the tiny restoration potions are still fine, a mid range one fills to MAX even if I am totally out and I've never bothered to use a large one, it's a total waste</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Vroomfondel</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Absolutely, potions are simple once you get the math of:<BR>red + blue = white<BR>red = terrible<BR>blue = terrible<BR>white = great<P>As long as you have alchemy level one potions will never ever be a problem again. About the only trouble you might have is too many potions eating up inventory weight. Once you start mixing mana and health to get restoration you use VERY few potions and they really start to build up. Most likely you'll start stashing 50 here and 50 there just so that you can carry more other stuff. I ended the game with about 200 potions in inventory and well over 1000 lying around on the ground in Kroxy's shop.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kuplo</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Damar Stiehl:<BR><I>My friend, here's a goldpiece; buy yourself a big, shiny clue.<P></I><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Actually, he's got a good point.
