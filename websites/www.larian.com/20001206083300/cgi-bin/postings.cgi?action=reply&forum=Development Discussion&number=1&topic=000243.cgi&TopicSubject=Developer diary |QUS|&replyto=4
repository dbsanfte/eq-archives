<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by lar:
[I]&gt;&gt;You regularly reply in the forums and maybe writing some of your problems down could actually led to a solution &lt;&lt;
                             
Hehe, easier said than done. We quite often dump a problem here, but some problems really require a lot of typing for some very minor issues, and we change them more rapidly than we can communicate them. I've copied a post from our internal forum (now you know what kind of stuff gets written there  ;), and you'll see what I mean. 


From internal forum, topic user interface :

The interface :

                                This is one of the hardest nuts. I heard tons of suggestions for that one, and tons of comments. Most of them directly contradict each other,
                                which gives you an idea of just how easy this thing is. The only thing everybody agrees on is that it has to be simple, but what's even more, it
                                has to be simple to communicate. Several of the points of critique were also targetted at things which are just not implemented yet. Here's a
                                little treatise on why this interface problem exists in the first place, and what the plan is to deal with it :

                                Everything can be done by a left mouse button operation. On paper the system which was used in the past, with the left/right click/drag, is the
                                best system, but it just takes too much time for the player to become comfortable with it, which is why it had to be dumped. The problem with
                                attaching everything to the left mouse button that it is basically impossible. Unlike a game like Diablo where the amount of actions is rather
                                limited, Divinity allows the player to do a lot more. The only thing we can do is attach the most important operations to the left mouse button,
                                and teach the player how to do the less important operations during the game. Here are all the operations that need to be assigned to the
                                mouse buttons :

                                Walking
                                Running
                                Talking
                                Attacking
                                Using an object
                                Moving an object
                                Picking up an object in the inventory
                                Destroying an object
                                Casting a spell
                                Using one object on another object

                                Then there are all the interface operations for plates, but that's another topic.

                                Another problem is highlighting, but this is mainly an editing problem. The normal situation is that practically every object gets highlighted. This is
                                too confusing. In the end, as a player, you want the minor important/majorly important object system, because that is the most useful.
                                However, learning it is too hard, so it's not a good system. Which immediately brings on a design decision:

                                Can you, or can you not move every object and use every object ?

                                If you can, then you automatically get a lot of objects that get highlighted. Not a problem in se, but the fact that dragging and using an object
                                is ideally done with the left mouse button, and movement,attacking is also ideally done with the left mouse button, causes the situation that by
                                misclicking, a lot of stuff happens which you don't want to happen.

                                Since I strongly believe ultima 9 could have been the RPG which would have blown away both Diablo and Baldur's gate, had it stuck to its roots
                                (being ultima 7), you can imagine that I'm a fervent supporter of the fact that indeed you can move and can use every object. Why is this
                                moving of every object important, even if it does not always add to the gameplay ? (moving a chair for instance) Well, the answer is simple : The
                                fact that as a player you know the world is completely interactive, something which encourages you to try out things. However, if you do that,
                                you have to make sure that there's enough stuff that can be accomplished by the player by moving/using objects, something which is currently
                                not the case. Why is it currently not the case ? Because editing that stuff is too hard. Solution : Make the editors better.

                                Another problem is that of deciding the sensitivity of the mouse. Trivial solutions like perfect match/not perfect match do not work, so the mouse
                                has to be made intelligent. This is implemented, but the rules for highlighting are decided at the level of the editor. Basically the rule is : If the
                                object is large enough, you need a perfect match. If the object is too small for easy perfect matching, the match may be not perfect. The
                                editing of perfect/non perfect was not completely ok for the version you played. 

                                Then there's another final problem with the user interface, at least where it concerns object interaction : It's ambiguous. This is the result of a
                                lot of tries to get it to behave better, and be easier. If you're an advanced Divinity player, then you like it, but if you're not, it sucks bigtime. 

                                The sensitivity thing, the large amount of objects that highlight, coupled with the fact that everything goes through the left mouse button, and
                                the the ambiguity, I consider to be the main problem of the user interface. If that gets solved well, I think it'll be perfect. 

                                Currently I have to following solution in mind, if anybody can come up with something better, by all means do :

                                All objects need a perfect match. There's no more helping the player to easily highlight an object, because swapping between perfect/non
                                perfect causes ambiguity, so that was a bad idea to start with. 

                                You cannot pick up an object anymore by immediately clicking on it. If you want to get an object in your inventory, then you need to drag it
                                over your character or the interface bar. This is loss of something that is user friendly, but again, differentiating between so called direct move
                                and non direct move objects causes ambiguity. Furthermore, this solves the problem of picking up objects which you don't want while fighting,
                                while still allowing the player to move every object (which is a drag operation)

                                When you press ALT, all objects that are in some way important to the player and that can be picked up by him are highlighted using the object
                                boxes. Here there is ambiguity. A cup or a plate for instance will not be highlighted, potions and gold will be. However, highlighting everything
                                doesn't work (your screen gets too cluttered), and you do want a function which immediately picks up an object. Much as I dislike the fact that
                                there's still ambiguity, ALT is already a bit more advanced, and communicating it to the player as "ALT shows objects that are important and you
                                can pick those objects up by clicking on them" should be a message which doesn't take long to get to them.

                                This way there is no problem with having the following operations attached to the left mouse button :


                                Walking : Left click (walk to destination), Left drag (walk in direction)
                                Running : Press R to toggle between walk/run or drag mouse to the edges of the screen
                                Talking : Left click on friendly character
                                Attacking: Left click on enemy character / hold ctrl to attack friendly character
                                Using an object : Left click on it 
                                Moving an object : Left drag it
                                Picking up an object in the inventory rag it on your character, interface bar, left click on it while holding the alt key
                                Destroying an object:hold ctrl and click on object
                                Casting a spell:Right click
                                Using one object on another object : Drag one object on top of the other object

                                Under this system, I see only one problem. The using of objects. Clearly, if there is a potion lying in the world, you don't want to use it, but
                                rather take it with you. That's why we had it that if you left clicked on it, it went to your inventory, and it didn't get drunk immediately. Under
                                this new system, you loose that. However, since most tests have indicated this ambiguity caused problems (hey I clicked on the cup, why didn't
                                I go to my inventory ?), it's probably best to take out this extremely handy feature, and use the alt option. (It seems to work well for Diablo)

                                This is all fine for the general actions, but there comes a point where the player wants to do something special, like use a specific skill or a
                                special object (the spider mine for instance). The idea was always to use the floating icons for this. Due to some stupid bug, the icon for the
                                spider mine didn't show up in the demo, which made it somewhat harder to use it. However, there is one problem with these icons. At some point
                                you'll have so much of them that it'll be hard to use them all. We had the idea to allow the player to create icons for every object in his
                                inventory, but that basically means a lot of extra artwork, plus the fact that organizing all of that in the game screen is a boring and hard task
                                for the player. We'll need something simpler. I've got two ideas there, but I'm not quite sure what works the best. In any case, I would dump the
                                create floating icon for all objects idea.

                                The special action menu. Somewhere on the interface bar, there should be a button which allows the player to access a menu where all his
                                special actions are stored. Thinks like disarm trap/drop spider mine/charm etc… should be listed in that menu. We could do it with the system we
                                have been using for the spells with the floating icons (which btw are planned to snap to grid and all that), but I'm afraid that won't work so well,
                                especially because a lot of these special actions don't allow themselves to be categorized so easily, that's what makes them special. 

                                Another option is to show floating icons somewhere on the screen from the moment a special action becomes available. All skill related actions
                                would then be done through the magic menu like is now the case. The floating icons would be shown in a grid.

                                Hotkeys : I think I'll only allow the keys F1-F12 and 0-9 to be used as hotkeys. To assign a hotkey, you go over the icon/special action and
                                press one of the keys, like is the case in Diablo. Currently you have to first go into hotkey mode (F8) and then press the key, something which
                                also seems to be too complicated.

                                Switching between combat modes : Right now, it's like that you automatically switch to combat mode the moment you click on an enemy.
                                There's no automatic go into combat mode when you are near an enemy. Past tests showed that this didn't work well. There should in any case
                                be some icon in the interface bar which allows you to switch between combat/non combat mode.
                                Pausing the game : There needs to be an icon
                                Options : There needs to be an icon

For reference, the typical model usually consists of the following steps :<P>1) Get some funding from whatever source<BR>2) Make a design doc<BR>3) Make a prototype/demo<BR>4) Show it to some guy at some publishing firm<BR>5) Get the funding to actually make the game<BR>6) Make the game<BR>7) Let the publisher take care of all the rest (including your profits and your intellectual rights  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/wink.gif"> )<P>Needless to say step 5) is where it goes awry for most developers, and it in a lot of cases it also heralds the end of yet another good idea. <P>What we did was,<P>1) Get some funding from whatever source<BR>2) Make the game<BR>3) Repeat from step 1) until the game is very advanced<BR>4) Find distributors/publishers for specific territories, meanwhile still taking care of step 3) <BR>5) Maintain control over most things related to the game<P>Somehow we managed to actually do this, but to all who contemplate doing the same thing, forget it. You really don't want to do it this way. I can tell you stories you wouldn't believe  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/wink.gif"> Use the typical model.<P>Anyway, we're now in step 4) and making good progress with that. We're actually even signing things (which means I get to sit on the plane a lot, something I hate), and when all the legal stuff is taken care of, we'll announce who will distribute/market  <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/div.gif"> in what territory. For those worrying, you'll be pleased to learn that a lot of money will be spent on the marketing of  <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/div.gif">.<P>Anyway, within the month I guess we'll be confident that  <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/div.gif"> will actually hit the retail shelves everywhere, we'll also be sure that everybody will learn what  <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/div.gif"> is, so that's something we don't have to worry about anymore.<P>Onto the technical side then: Unfortunately we still have a lot of work. We've now been working on  <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/div.gif"> for a little bit more than a year, and I have to say that I'm rather pleased with the engine. If I compare it to our main competitors (Diablo/BG) I don't think we have to blush, and I think that our engine is in many aspects superior. It still needs some tweaking here and there, and it needs the occasional additional feature, but in general, it's pretty good. But now, now we have to put a soul in that engine, and that is much more work than we had anticipated.  <P>I think we have a pretty good idea of the amount of content that needs to be in a RPG in order to make it really good. The problem is that our definition implies a huge amount of content, and of course, somebody has to put that content in. To our dismay (though in hindsight, we could have expected this), it turned out that the editors we had been developing in the last year, are not up to the task of rapidly adding content. At least, not rapid enough. To give you an idea, there are currently 4000 individual object types in  <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/div.gif">. Each of these objects have approximately between 100 to 200 properties that need to be edited. Taking the lowest amount (which is not the case for say 20% of the objects), that means there are about 400000 properties which need to be edited for the objects alone, and then they're not even in the game yet. We currently have a lot of bugs which are caused by misediting of the properties in the objects, and the main reason for that is that while our object property editor does its job, it's not easy enough to operate. And those are just the object properties, I won't even start talking about the monsters and the npcs.<P>This content editing problem (the fact that we can do all of it, but it doesn't go fast enough) is what we are working on now. We're churning out updated editors which automate as much tasks as possible, so that we can focus on what's really important, namely putting in the gameplay. But this updating of the editors does take its time, especially since there's just so much that has to be edited.  <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/div.gif"> allows the player to do really a lot of things in the gameworld, and somewhere along the line, someone has to tell the engine what the result is of all these interactions. <P>I guess that apart of the fact that editing the data is not always super-easy, the biggest problem with the content editing is the fact that a lot of the data is relational. Change something here, and it immediately affects something else. Change the weight of a sword, and its possible that some monsters can't be carrying that sword anymore (Editors need to check this). But sometimes it goes deeper : As an example, take a test we had with Bean (forum member) yesterday. He picked up kitty, the everything-that-walks-on-four-legs-killing cat, and she happily killed some rabbits for him. Consequently he stripped the meat from those rabbits, and in general thought kitty was doing a pretty good job. Then however, by accident, he passed Otho's famous pig farm. Kitty saw the pigs, rushed off, and killed the pigs. Otho got in a rage (operating under the rule, if npc kills my pets, I kill the npc) and Bean (level 1 character) suddenly saw himself confronted with someone throwing tons of fireballs after his head. Cool on itself, but undesired. (At least in the village where the player starts the game, and where we want to keep things simple)<P>So we're learning. We're learning that it's not only important to have an engine that is capable of doing a lot of stuff, it's also at least as important to be able to edit that stuff in a way which catches a lot of bugs upfront. On top of that, that editor has to be extremely user-friendly. It was an oversight that we didn't realize this early enough, and as a result of course, we suffer a delay. Of course, we could've gone ahead and use the editors we had, and just put in less content, but that's not really an option, given that we want this game to be very very good.<P>Talking about learning, we're also learning a lot about testing the game. We frequently invite people (or have people who invite themselves  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/wink.gif"> ) to come and test the game. So far I think we've been very lucky. Most of the testers came from the forum, and as you're all quite an intelligent bunch, the feedback we get is often very well thought out. Nontheless, more than often, the feedback of one tester is in direct conflict with that of others.  We're learning how to find the balance.<P>And then of course, we have the usual problems. Windows/driver bugs every programmer in the world complains about, stupid mistakes through which we lose a lot of time, heated debates about very small features on which everybody seems to have an opinion, stress moments in the team due to working long hours in a confined space, impossible deadlines for tradeshows/presentations, press guys who all want exclusives, too much work, too little time, and so forth... But all in all, we're managing, and it's fun to see the game come together, and to see people test it, and actually enjoying themselves. And that makes it worth it.<P>Lar<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#464646"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">lar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">&gt;&gt;You regularly reply in the forums and maybe writing some of your problems down could actually led to a solution &lt;&lt;<BR>                             <BR>Hehe, easier said than done. We quite often dump a problem here, but some problems really require a lot of typing for some very minor issues, and we change them more rapidly than we can communicate them. I've copied a post from our internal forum (now you know what kind of stuff gets written there  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/wink.gif">, and you'll see what I mean. <P><BR>From internal forum, topic user interface :<P>The interface :<P>                                This is one of the hardest nuts. I heard tons of suggestions for that one, and tons of comments. Most of them directly contradict each other,<BR>                                which gives you an idea of just how easy this thing is. The only thing everybody agrees on is that it has to be simple, but what's even more, it<BR>                                has to be simple to communicate. Several of the points of critique were also targetted at things which are just not implemented yet. Here's a<BR>                                little treatise on why this interface problem exists in the first place, and what the plan is to deal with it :<P>                                Everything can be done by a left mouse button operation. On paper the system which was used in the past, with the left/right click/drag, is the<BR>                                best system, but it just takes too much time for the player to become comfortable with it, which is why it had to be dumped. The problem with<BR>                                attaching everything to the left mouse button that it is basically impossible. Unlike a game like Diablo where the amount of actions is rather<BR>                                limited, Divinity allows the player to do a lot more. The only thing we can do is attach the most important operations to the left mouse button,<BR>                                and teach the player how to do the less important operations during the game. Here are all the operations that need to be assigned to the<BR>                                mouse buttons :<P>                                Walking<BR>                                Running<BR>                                Talking<BR>                                Attacking<BR>                                Using an object<BR>                                Moving an object<BR>                                Picking up an object in the inventory<BR>                                Destroying an object<BR>                                Casting a spell<BR>                                Using one object on another object<P>                                Then there are all the interface operations for plates, but that's another topic.<P>                                Another problem is highlighting, but this is mainly an editing problem. The normal situation is that practically every object gets highlighted. This is<BR>                                too confusing. In the end, as a player, you want the minor important/majorly important object system, because that is the most useful.<BR>                                However, learning it is too hard, so it's not a good system. Which immediately brings on a design decision:<P>                                Can you, or can you not move every object and use every object ?<P>                                If you can, then you automatically get a lot of objects that get highlighted. Not a problem in se, but the fact that dragging and using an object<BR>                                is ideally done with the left mouse button, and movement,attacking is also ideally done with the left mouse button, causes the situation that by<BR>                                misclicking, a lot of stuff happens which you don't want to happen.<P>                                Since I strongly believe ultima 9 could have been the RPG which would have blown away both Diablo and Baldur's gate, had it stuck to its roots<BR>                                (being ultima 7), you can imagine that I'm a fervent supporter of the fact that indeed you can move and can use every object. Why is this<BR>                                moving of every object important, even if it does not always add to the gameplay ? (moving a chair for instance) Well, the answer is simple : The<BR>                                fact that as a player you know the world is completely interactive, something which encourages you to try out things. However, if you do that,<BR>                                you have to make sure that there's enough stuff that can be accomplished by the player by moving/using objects, something which is currently<BR>                                not the case. Why is it currently not the case ? Because editing that stuff is too hard. Solution : Make the editors better.<P>                                Another problem is that of deciding the sensitivity of the mouse. Trivial solutions like perfect match/not perfect match do not work, so the mouse<BR>                                has to be made intelligent. This is implemented, but the rules for highlighting are decided at the level of the editor. Basically the rule is : If the<BR>                                object is large enough, you need a perfect match. If the object is too small for easy perfect matching, the match may be not perfect. The<BR>                                editing of perfect/non perfect was not completely ok for the version you played. <P>                                Then there's another final problem with the user interface, at least where it concerns object interaction : It's ambiguous. This is the result of a<BR>                                lot of tries to get it to behave better, and be easier. If you're an advanced Divinity player, then you like it, but if you're not, it sucks bigtime. <P>                                The sensitivity thing, the large amount of objects that highlight, coupled with the fact that everything goes through the left mouse button, and<BR>                                the the ambiguity, I consider to be the main problem of the user interface. If that gets solved well, I think it'll be perfect. <P>                                Currently I have to following solution in mind, if anybody can come up with something better, by all means do :<P>                                All objects need a perfect match. There's no more helping the player to easily highlight an object, because swapping between perfect/non<BR>                                perfect causes ambiguity, so that was a bad idea to start with. <P>                                You cannot pick up an object anymore by immediately clicking on it. If you want to get an object in your inventory, then you need to drag it<BR>                                over your character or the interface bar. This is loss of something that is user friendly, but again, differentiating between so called direct move<BR>                                and non direct move objects causes ambiguity. Furthermore, this solves the problem of picking up objects which you don't want while fighting,<BR>                                while still allowing the player to move every object (which is a drag operation)<P>                                When you press ALT, all objects that are in some way important to the player and that can be picked up by him are highlighted using the object<BR>                                boxes. Here there is ambiguity. A cup or a plate for instance will not be highlighted, potions and gold will be. However, highlighting everything<BR>                                doesn't work (your screen gets too cluttered), and you do want a function which immediately picks up an object. Much as I dislike the fact that<BR>                                there's still ambiguity, ALT is already a bit more advanced, and communicating it to the player as "ALT shows objects that are important and you<BR>                                can pick those objects up by clicking on them" should be a message which doesn't take long to get to them.<P>                                This way there is no problem with having the following operations attached to the left mouse button :<P><BR>                                Walking : Left click (walk to destination), Left drag (walk in direction)<BR>                                Running : Press R to toggle between walk/run or drag mouse to the edges of the screen<BR>                                Talking : Left click on friendly character<BR>                                Attacking: Left click on enemy character / hold ctrl to attack friendly character<BR>                                Using an object : Left click on it <BR>                                Moving an object : Left drag it<BR>                                Picking up an object in the inventory rag it on your character, interface bar, left click on it while holding the alt key<BR>                                Destroying an object:hold ctrl and click on object<BR>                                Casting a spell:Right click<BR>                                Using one object on another object : Drag one object on top of the other object<P>                                Under this system, I see only one problem. The using of objects. Clearly, if there is a potion lying in the world, you don't want to use it, but<BR>                                rather take it with you. That's why we had it that if you left clicked on it, it went to your inventory, and it didn't get drunk immediately. Under<BR>                                this new system, you loose that. However, since most tests have indicated this ambiguity caused problems (hey I clicked on the cup, why didn't<BR>                                I go to my inventory ?), it's probably best to take out this extremely handy feature, and use the alt option. (It seems to work well for Diablo)<P>                                This is all fine for the general actions, but there comes a point where the player wants to do something special, like use a specific skill or a<BR>                                special object (the spider mine for instance). The idea was always to use the floating icons for this. Due to some stupid bug, the icon for the<BR>                                spider mine didn't show up in the demo, which made it somewhat harder to use it. However, there is one problem with these icons. At some point<BR>                                you'll have so much of them that it'll be hard to use them all. We had the idea to allow the player to create icons for every object in his<BR>                                inventory, but that basically means a lot of extra artwork, plus the fact that organizing all of that in the game screen is a boring and hard task<BR>                                for the player. We'll need something simpler. I've got two ideas there, but I'm not quite sure what works the best. In any case, I would dump the<BR>                                create floating icon for all objects idea.<P>                                The special action menu. Somewhere on the interface bar, there should be a button which allows the player to access a menu where all his<BR>                                special actions are stored. Thinks like disarm trap/drop spider mine/charm etc… should be listed in that menu. We could do it with the system we<BR>                                have been using for the spells with the floating icons (which btw are planned to snap to grid and all that), but I'm afraid that won't work so well,<BR>                                especially because a lot of these special actions don't allow themselves to be categorized so easily, that's what makes them special. <P>                                Another option is to show floating icons somewhere on the screen from the moment a special action becomes available. All skill related actions<BR>                                would then be done through the magic menu like is now the case.

To our dismay (though in hindsight, we could have expected this), it turned out that the editors we had been developing in the last year, are not up to the task of rapidly adding content. At least, not rapid enough. To give you an idea, there are currently 4000 individual object types in   <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/div.gif">. Each of these objects have approximately between 100 to 200 properties that need to be edited.<BR></I><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>Did you write custom editors for this ?<BR>Something like an imageviewer with a properties column ?<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><I><BR>This content editing problem (the fact that we can do all of it, but it doesn't go fast enough) is what we are working on now. We're churning out updated editors which automate as much tasks as possible, so that we can focus on what's really important, namely putting in the gameplay. But this updating of the editors does take its time, especially since there's just so much that has to be edited.<BR></I><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>I appears somebody violated some OO-principles here  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><I><BR>I guess that apart of the fact that editing the data is not always super-easy, the biggest problem with the content editing is the fact that a lot of the data is relational. Change something here, and it immediately affects something else. Change the weight of a sword, and its possible that some monsters can't be carrying that sword anymore (Editors need to check this). But sometimes it goes deeper : As an example, take a test we had with Bean (forum member) yesterday. He picked up kitty, the everything-that-walks-on-four-legs-killing cat, and she happily killed some rabbits for him. Consequently he stripped the meat from those rabbits, and in general thought kitty was doing a pretty good job. Then however, by accident, he passed Otho's famous pig farm. Kitty saw the pigs, rushed off, and killed the pigs. Otho got in a rage (operating under the rule, if npc kills my pets, I kill the npc) and Bean (level 1 character) suddenly saw himself confronted with someone throwing tons of fireballs after his head. Cool on itself, but undesired.

It's not perfect, but it tries to use your (current) controls to some extent and those of Diablo plus a bit more because of the need to combine objects and use spells on objects.<P>In Diablo you can only use objects that are in your inventory. To use them you right click on them. You can't cast a spell while the mouse pointer is over an object in the inventory. Doors can be opened/closed with the left click.<P>To avoid using -or- picking up objects during a fight they should not be used or picked up by left clicking on them. I would differ between objects that can't be used on their own, objects which can only be used once and objects which you can turn on and off.<P>Doors, windows, candles, torches, levers can be opened/closed, lighted/extinguished or pushed/pulled. Buttons can be pushed multiple times. (Some levers or buttons may be limited to using them once... but I still would put them in this category.) These should be used (togled on/off) by a left click.<BR>Food, potions can be used only once (eat/drink). Don't use it with a left click.<BR>Stones, Swords, Armor, etc. can't be used on their own. (If you want to use them you will need to equip them or use them on other objects.) You can't use them, so do nothing with them.<P>o left click on<BR>- ground: Walk there.<BR>- object: (Try to) walk there. Do as if you clicked on ground below object.<BR>+ ALT: Pick object up. (Or drop it if object is in the inventory.)<BR>+ CTRL: Destroy object.<BR>- toggle object: Activate/deactivate.<BR>+ ALT: Pick up if possible.<BR>+ CTRL: Destroy object. (Knock on door if weapon is put away -or- smash door if you have a weapon drawn.)<BR>- friend: Walk to him and talk. (Don't put weapon away if you have it drawn.)<BR>- enemy: Walk to him and attack. (Switch to attack mode.)<BR>- icon: Chooses the active spell/skill. (Casting is done with right click.)<P>o left drag<BR>- ground: Walk in that direction. (Run if mouse pointer is near screen border.)<BR>- object: Move object if you move (drag) the mouse, otherwise walk in that direction (only hold down left mouse button). Once the mouse pinter is off the initial object, you can move the mouse to change the direction you walk in.<BR>- object on object: Place object ontop of object.<BR>- object on character/inventory-bar: Pick object up if possible.<BR>- object on npc: Give object to npc. (If it's an enemy you could throw object (explosive potion). But maybe you should use right drag to throw.)<BR>- icon: Do nothing. You have clicked on the icon by accident and don't want anything to happen.<BR>+ CTRL, ALT or SHIFT?: Move icon on screen.<P>o right click on<BR>- ground: Only cast spell that dosn't need a target. (Not the best solution. see below *)<BR>- object lying on ground: Cast spell/use skill that affects object -or- cast spell that doesn't need a target (global spell/skill). This is how you use "pick lock".<BR>- object in inventory: Use object if you can use it on it's own.<BR>- npc: Cast spell/use skill that affect npc -or- global spells.<BR>- friend: Only spells where friend benefits.<BR>+ CTRL: You may harm friend. (eg. steal something from friendly npc.)<BR>- enemy: Only spells that harm enemy.<BR>- icon: Casts spell/uses skill on target. (You need this to cast spells on objects in your inventory, but it can also be used on npc's or objects in the world.)<P>o right drag<BR>- ground: ??? Draw a spell? Protective circle around you. Straight wall in front of you. (This could come into conflict with right drag object.)<BR>- object: Move a transparent image of the object (if you drop it, this image vanishes).<BR>- object on object: Use the first object on the second object.<BR>- object on character/inventory-bar: Use object directly from the ground. ie. drink potion.<BR>- object on friend: Tell him to <B>use</B> object (drink potion) and not only take it.<BR>- object on enemy: Throw object at enemy.<BR>- on npc: ??? Do nothing<BR>- icon: Do nothing. You have clicked on the icon by accident and don't want anything to happen.<P>o move mouse without holding a button pressed<BR>- CAPS-LOCK deactivated: Move mouse pointer. (wow!)<BR>+ SHIFT: Scroll screen when mouse pointer is at edge of screen. (Jumps back to character if SHIFT is released.)<BR>- CAPS-LOCK activated: Scroll screen when mouse pointer is at edge of screen. (Screen stays there until CAPS-LOCK is deactivated.)<BR>+ SHIFT: Screen jumps back to character.<P>*)<BR>This leaves a few special cases or problems:<BR>- "right click on object in inventory: Use object if you can use it on it's own." You can't cast a spell while the mouse pointer is over an object in your inventory. Thus you need to right click on the spell icon to activate the spell and then target the object. (The mouse pointer should change.)<BR>- When right clicking -and- a combat spell/skill is chosen, the nearest enemy should be targeted. This is to avoid not being able to cast a spell while mouse pointer is over object, ground or friend. (The same goes for nice spells on enemies.)<BR>- When right clicking -and- spell/skill that manipulates objects is chosen, the nearest object should be targeted. This is to avoid not being able to cast a spell while mouse pointer is over a npc or the ground.<P>What I like about this modified interface is:<BR>- You can use drag -or- click to walk without switching between modes. This is nice for players used to one (Diablo, BG) or the other (NOX).<BR>- You have very few conflicts while fighting or walking. (No picking up or using of objects.)<BR>- left mouse button only <B>moves</B>: walk, run, move objects, move weapon (attack - Okay, this one doesn't fit  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/wink.gif">)<BR>- right mouse button only <B>uses</B>: cast spells, use skill, use object, combine objects<BR>- the most comon things (besides picking up objects) are easy to acomplish.<P>It is hard to pick up an item with this system. If a new player tries to pick up an item he will notice that left clicking on it will not do anything. After a few tries you could bring up a message box that says: "Try to pull the item to your character/inventory-bar -or- use ALT+left-click to pick up something." If he drags the object to the character a few times you could bring up a message box: "Using ALT+left-click also picks up something."<P>But as you said you need to test it. (And when I have time I will come and test it  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/wink.gif">) But please also make sure that the interface is suited for hectic situations and avoids accidentaly doing the wrong thing easily. It is good if you learn the controls quickly/intuitive but they also have to be playable in the long run.<P>In the version I played it took me quite (too) long to learn the controls... but it was okay playing with them once I knew how to.<P>ps. Maybe only torches that are atached to a wall should be lighted/extinguished with a left click. Otherwise you light a torch that lies on the ground. Hmmm... don't know. But this would require more editing to be done and different behaviour for torches on the wall and ground... So it's probably not good.<p>[This message has been edited by Tutamun (edited 03-10-2000).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#282828"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tutamun</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">What I said above (the problems with the current controls) only applies if you use the action click-click-click fighting. If you use the click once and watch the character do the fighting method, then you will have more time to position your mouse pointer and thus avoid "accidents". And then there is also the pause button when you don't want to make mistakes. If the interface is not perfect it won't matter that much for the calm players. But the action loving (why do we need a pause button?) players will have a hard time if the interface allows "accidents" to happen easily.<P>(I have just read it again... hope you understand it <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/wink.gif">)</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#464646"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tutamun</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Oh!
