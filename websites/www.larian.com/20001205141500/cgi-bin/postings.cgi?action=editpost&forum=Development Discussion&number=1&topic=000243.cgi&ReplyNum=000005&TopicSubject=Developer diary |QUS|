What we did was,

1) Get some funding from whatever source
2) Make the game
3) Repeat from step 1) until the game is very advanced
4) Find distributors/publishers for specific territories, meanwhile still taking care of step 3) 
5) Maintain control over most things related to the game

Somehow we managed to actually do this, but to all who contemplate doing the same thing, forget it. You really don't want to do it this way. I can tell you stories you wouldn't believe   ;) Use the typical model.
[/i][/QUOTE]
It's wonderful you managed to do this !
With a groups of friends you could agree to survive on water for a few months but with the team growing and external people coming in, getting their wages paid, ... .
Belgium has little tradition on the field of game creation/publishing and it's already difficult to get them abroad so many congratulations to you Lar !

 [QUOTE][i]
The problem is that our definition implies a huge amount of content, and of course, somebody has to put that content in. To our dismay (though in hindsight, we could have expected this), it turned out that the editors we had been developing in the last year, are not up to the task of rapidly adding content. At least, not rapid enough. To give you an idea, there are currently 4000 individual object types in   :div:. Each of these objects have approximately between 100 to 200 properties that need to be edited.
[/i][/QUOTE]
Did you write custom editors for this ?
Something like an imageviewer with a properties column ?

 [QUOTE][i]
This content editing problem (the fact that we can do all of it, but it doesn't go fast enough) is what we are working on now. We're churning out updated editors which automate as much tasks as possible, so that we can focus on what's really important, namely putting in the gameplay. But this updating of the editors does take its time, especially since there's just so much that has to be edited.
[/i][/QUOTE]
I appears somebody violated some OO-principles here  ;)

 [QUOTE][i]
I guess that apart of the fact that editing the data is not always super-easy, the biggest problem with the content editing is the fact that a lot of the data is relational. Change something here, and it immediately affects something else. Change the weight of a sword, and its possible that some monsters can't be carrying that sword anymore (Editors need to check this). But sometimes it goes deeper : As an example, take a test we had with Bean (forum member) yesterday. He picked up kitty, the everything-that-walks-on-four-legs-killing cat, and she happily killed some rabbits for him. Consequently he stripped the meat from those rabbits, and in general thought kitty was doing a pretty good job. Then however, by accident, he passed Otho's famous pig farm. Kitty saw the pigs, rushed off, and killed the pigs. Otho got in a rage (operating under the rule, if npc kills my pets, I kill the npc) and Bean (level 1 character) suddenly saw himself confronted with someone throwing tons of fireballs after his head. Cool on itself, but undesired. (At least in the village where the player starts the game, and where we want to keep things simple)
[/i][/QUOTE]
 :D   Great !
Not because of the final result but feeling the AI is working !
I've only seen screenshots/read early reviews so far but I seems you guys are writing the kernel for human psychology in a robot  :D</TEXTAREA>
