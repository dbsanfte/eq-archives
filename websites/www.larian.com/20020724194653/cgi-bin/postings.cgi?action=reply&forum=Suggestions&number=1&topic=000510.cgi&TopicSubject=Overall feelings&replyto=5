Merging the equipment and inventory windows into a single window would have helped a lot. May be a matter of taste but I also have a strong preference for inventory slots. The inventory is really pretty chaotic but you said it has improved so there's hope  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/wink.gif"> .<BR>Another thing that is pretty confusing is that you have to drag items from your inventory on top of other items in the world.

This probably explains the many cheap spinoffs of some very simple and easy to play games. What I usually do, is I always start in the medium difficulty and then, if it gets too hard, or I don't get how to play, I go to the easy difficulty. What works for me in games such as half-life and Deus Ex is trying to kill everything flawlessly (OTW. without being hit). Doing this makes you learn the game a HECK of alot faster.<P>The kind of introduction that I think is quite good is something like in Baldur's Gate. You start in the city, you can explore it to your heart's desire, you can practice stealing, fighting alone, in a party, pausing the game, etc. Also, as this part is actually involved in the plot, it actually makes lazy people think "wow, I'm actually doing something and not being treated like some dumb fat B*st*rd who doesn't know how to play a game." Including part of the storyline in the introduction to the game, is how I think a person should be introduced  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/icons/icon14.gif"> <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/icons/icon14.gif"><P>There are very few games I can think of with which you can say, "hmm, I've been playing all morning and looked through the <B><I>manual</B></I> (something you can't miss if you're confused) but I still don't get how to move around and where and who my enemies are."
