FORGIVE ME!!!</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">neurro</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ok, so I deleted everything I just wrote, lets write it over again!<P>First, i'll address your computer.  Your bottleneck is definitely your RAM, but you should run fine.  I have a p4 2.0ghz, 512 RAM, 64mb GeForce3 ti200 and I run with everything on the highest quality with no slowdown.  I do have crashing issues, as I hear many others do as well.  The crashing seems to happen when the music changes or at various odd times, but you might not experience these issues.<P>Now, as far as my rating for Divine Divinity goes, I give it an 8.  It combines the best aspects of Diablo 2, Arcanum, and Baldur's Gate and does it well.  Whenever I play a game, I love to have alot of items like Diablo 2 presented, but I absolutely hate a story that's not in-depth, this is the main reason why Diablo 2 (outside of the Multiplayer) bored me.  One thing you'll want to look out for while playing, is inadvertantly completing something that wasn't meant to be completed while you're trying to complete the task you've been given.  Does that make sense?  Basically, if you do something weird, you more than likely broke a quest, so when you go to get that quest, you wont be able to complete it.  Another big thing is trapping yourself in the game (you can't complete it).  You can do this the same way as I mentioned above, but I haven't personally experienced it.  Fallout had this problem as well, so it's not a big deal to a veteran CRPG player.  All those problems aren't that big of a deal if you SAVE FREQUENTLY.  If you mess up, just reload your last current game.  The monster battles can be wonderfully tough, meaning you can't just go in with potions hacking away like you would in Diablo 2.  Though this game may be familiar to you if you've played Diablo 2, it's NOT.<P>Would I recommend this game?  Absolutely.  If you like this game, then you should definitely check out Fallout 1 and 2, because they blow it out of the water.  There are various posts on this board detailing the script bug, and there is also a good topic on comparing DD (divine divinity) to the other CRPGs.<P>Hope this helps!</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Quezi</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">thanks.. iv decided to go ahead and get the game simply becaus i cant really find anything else that i dont already have *im surounding myself with games as of now.. strangest thing*<P>right now im playing morrowind and nwn in an online persistant world type thing that has a good community and is small enough where it dosnt feel static.

He shot himself because he was addicted to the game and got screwed by someone online or something like that.  Blaming the game is ridiculous.  That's like blaming the tv show Friends if a fan of the show killed himself because the show was going to stop.  Its the mental instability of the person, not the game.  It amazes me how people will always try to find fault with someone or something else rather than holding people accountable for their own actions.<BR>...now stepping off the soapbox.  (mental note -if I ever decide to off myself, make sure to leave behind a note stressing that it was due to my own mental deficiency rather than violent computer games and/or music)<P>My computer specs are lower -Win XP, 733mhz Pentium processor, 256 ram, geforce video card -and the game runs pretty well so far.  The only real problems come from an occassional (about once an hour) freeze of the game where nothing moves for about 5 seconds.  I always get terrified thinking the system locked up or its about to crash, but it has always continued with no problem.  Not one single crash... yet.<P>I would rate the game a 7.5 to 8, but I've only had it a couple of days.  Still, its a blast.</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Quezi</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Yeah i hate anti game people.

Epilepsy is nothing like mental retardation or physical diabilities that may require constant supervision. The blame lies within himself.<BR>The first page of the Divine Divinity manual mentions the hazards involved in computer games for people with epilepsy and what precautions you should take.  He did not take adequate care of himself considering his condition, so no... its not the mother's fault.  She cannot control him.  He wanted independence and he did well for a while.  Its not her fault if he withdrew from reality and didn't bother to notify her.<BR>I don't think she's responsible, but I think she's a caca head for trying to blame or sue EQ for her son's actions.<p>[This message has been edited by Ger (edited 31-10-2002).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Lucifer Black</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Thank you Ger, <P>A good response.  <P>Also, I've noticed how many games say 'prolonged use etc' but then if your like me and the computers have no effect then you'll find you can game solid for 3 days, well, until you fall out of your chair from tiredness (coffee only does so much).<P>It's basically to cover their backs so they can't be done for causing seizures.  They put the warning, you either read it or you don't (me, I ignore it totally) but it is mainly to stop someone suing them sor something they (if they were epileptic) already have been informed about by dr's etc.<P>I did type more but it's gone on enuff already, thanks Ger for your response, sorry everyone else for boring you to tears.<P>Regs<P>L<BR></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
