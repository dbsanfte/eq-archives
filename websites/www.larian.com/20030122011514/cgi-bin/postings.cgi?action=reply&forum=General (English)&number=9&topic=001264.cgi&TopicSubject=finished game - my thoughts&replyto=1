<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=20 COLS=75 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Alrik Fassbauer:
[I] The Problem with that is much more complicated.

Before I became a Forummember here, and that was back in 1999, when  :div: was just arisen as "Project C", I thought exactly the same as you do.

However, through all these years being a member in this Community, I learned A LOT about the Gaming Industry. And about all that's related to Larian Studios.

The sentence "If they can get it right with a patch, they can get it right before release" makes sense if you look naively at the Developing as such.

However, if you pay a closer look at [i]scheduling[/i], you might notice that there is something wrong with that Point of View.

With  :div: for example, you can follow this scheduling:

0. Publisher pressures to get Game ready at a [i]specific[/i] Date, no matter if this is Bugfree then, or not.
1. Get Game ready for Release.
2. Send Master Copy to CDV.
3. CDV sends Master Copy to the Manufacturing Company, aka "going Gold".
4. Four weeks later (or so) the Package is ready to buy.

Guess what happened [i]meanwhile[/i] ?  ;) Of course there was more testing, it simply hadn't stopped since sending the Master to CDV !  ;)

So, [i]meanwhile[/i] the production was running, [i]testing[/i] revealed some more Bugs. Many more Bugs, in this case.

The really bad thing about that is, when a Publisher doesn't have the Patience simply to [i]wait[/i]. Then, the Publisher demands that the Product [b]must[/b] be sold, no matter, if it is Bug-Free or not  [!]

A Procuct scheduling goes with the so-called "Milestones" (maybe you heard of them in conjunction with Mozilla), and a Milestonde is a certain [i]Date[/i], when a part of Software should be ready, or at least should have reached a definited state.

The very Last of these Dates ist the Date when a Game goes as the Master Copy to the Publisher.

And if the Publisher [b]wants[/b] the Software at this specific date, the Developing Company must deliver it ("stand and deliver !"  ;) ). Sadly, it is at this Point a kind of "Master and Servant".

So much of my thought about this matter here.  ;)

What follows is my humble two cents worth of opinion. Please feel free to agree, disagree, rant, rave or whatever, at your leisure . . . or not.<P>I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game. Solid story, awesome sound effects, great graphics and well-thought out gameplay mechanics all combine to deliver what will surely become an RPG classic. The world in which my avatar strode is full of richly detailed scenery. Although the graphics are 2D, they deliver much more believable eye candy than many of the supposed "more advanced" 3D games on the market. It's the little nuances that make the difference. Things like birds flying overhead and reflections in the water added greatly to the immersion factor. And I really like the swagger on my female battle mage as she struts her stuff about town - hubba hubba.<P>One major draw back to this great game is the frustrating and frequent crashes to desktop that seemed to occur only after I had neglected to quick save after three hours of gameplay. Nothing chaps my backside quicker than to have to retrace my steps because of an instability issues. When will game developers stop releasing unstable product? (And please don't tell my it's my fault. I am tired of being blamed for the shortcomings of the programming world. If they can get it right with a patch, they can get it right before release.) My advice, "quick save" early and often.<P>The story, though just a tad contrived, is believable. I really care about my character. The notion of almost completely open-ended game play along with the ability to put skill points wherever I please is a major plus. This also adds a little to replayablity because it is possible to go through the game as a totally different character doing things in different order. <P>Like any good CRPG, this one is driven along by the quests. I wanted to finish all of the quests, but sadly the nagging "broken quest gremlins" run rampant throughout this adventure. One wrong turn and you find yourself without a needed dialogue tree, manuscript or gate key, and it's impossible to solve a quest. Some of them can be major quests. I am still a little miffed about the dragon armor quest, grrrrrr. On the plus side, the quests are imaginitive and fun. The pissing altar boy will go down in history as a true classic. It is so nice to NOT have to be a level 35+ battle mage package delivery boy all of the time.<P>My grade: <BR>Graphics - 93%<BR>Sound - 93%<BR>Gameplay - 90%<BR>Stability - 72%<BR>My slant - 88%<P>Overall, a solid 87.2%. A very nice B+. You should be very proud of your efforts. You guys at Larian have whipped up an engrossing tale of "save the world" and I thoroughly enjoyed doing so.<P>P.S.

I do undertsand the pressures of corporate deadlines. I am just voicing frustration at the "suits" who only have monetary attachments to the game. I am well aware of the screams of RELEASE, RELEASE, RELEASE!! It would be nice however if developers were allowed to thoroughly test BEFORE the release date, so what are otherwise stellar games are not plagued by fixable bugs.<P>Oh, and since I'm all full of myself and offering two cents of near worthless opinion, here is another couple of centavos. DO NOT make an expansion/sequel to this game. Please direct the considerable and worthy talents of the Larian minds to creating a totally new game. You guys hit the nail about as squarely on the head as possible and I am all aquiver with excitement as to what the next game could be. And if you are ever in the need of a beta tester . . .  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/biggrin.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Alrik Fassbauer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">In an Interview Lar once said that they'd like to do something completely new, but then it wasn't even too early to say...<P>Yes, I'd like more Publishers leaving the devs more time for appropriate Bugtesting.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">ariana</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Krysanthl- I haven't finished yet, but so far I agree with your comments. I have found Divine Divinity a major favorable surprise. My luck with European-developed "CRPG" titles has been spotty at best and this publisher didn't have a track record in the genre that I knew about so I got the game a bit reluctantly and didn't take it out of the box until putting in a few hundred hours on Icewind Dale 2. I figured I would give it a day and if it was mediocre get on to the Neverwinter Nights Expansion, Avernum 2 or Homeworld (the latter two by Spiderweb Software - a small "shareware" house known for the high stability of its games and the loving detail that goes into them (making up for the dated graphics)).<P>Instead I am still plowing away at trying to finish "hardcore" (meaning without ever going back to a prior save except to recover from a crash or bug). The other games are sitting in THEIR boxes now.<P>If a "Divine Divinity 2" could be done the way Might and Magic 7 was done - using the existing engine with a few refinenements and thus able to get the game out in maybe 1/3 to 1/4 of the time a new engine would take - I would love to see it even if this did delay a new engine game by those 6 months or so. New engines take a long time. If they are going to use a new engine i don't care what the name is, and whether you can import characters from DD is irrelevent to me.<P>Alrik - your points are very well taken (not to mention accurate *grins* ) as to how little control many game developers have, these days. But there is still too much focus on "release now" and not enough on getting the game even 99% done and tested. The internet has hurt - making downloadable patches so ubiquitous. There are exception but they seem to be becoming more, er, exceptional *grins*. Sir-tech was definitely an exception but they are out of the business *sob* leaving Wizardry 8 as a testimonial to just how well a game can be done. New World Computing was another but Might and Magic 9 is a testimonial too - to how thoroughly they were raped after being bought by 3DO. The company doing Gothic 2 and Arx Fatalis is in financial trouble but is still holding up Gothic 2 (English version) to be sure to get it right - kudos to them (with apologies for forgetting the name - mental block - I hated Gothic).<P>------------------<BR>Reality is for those who cannot cope with fantasy.
