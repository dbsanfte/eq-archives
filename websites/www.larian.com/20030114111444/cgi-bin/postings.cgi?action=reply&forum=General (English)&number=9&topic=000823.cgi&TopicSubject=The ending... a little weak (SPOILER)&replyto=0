[I]don't get me wrong this is a very fun and in some ways deep game. I just finished the game and i was a little disappointed. The whole thing was incredible until after you become the divine one. At that point it is just kill kill kill, not that theres anything wrong with that but larian put way to much in at the ending to a point where it became repetitive and boring. Before your the divine one you can take you time and explore and do side quests in rivertown, if you haven't beaten the game i suggest you do all the fun stuff you want before you become the divine one because you will be in for a crap load of fighting. Overall though the game was excellent and i would give it a perfect score if it wasn't for the out of place ending.[/I][/QUOTE]

A big plain of random monsters and an extraordinarily long dungeon hackfest. Very disappointing after the nonlinear, multi-path scenarios you get up until then. <P>A lot of the divine skills were a bit disappointing, too...Especially considering some of the more potent ones look no different from Zandalor's/dreadknight spells. Considering this is a 2d game that uses graphical prettiness as reason for the obscene memory load it requires, I'd have liked a few new magic animations.<P>And the end itself needed a lot more. Not necessarily in cutscene form, but definitely more. It's annoying waiting for a potential sequel just to find out wtf was going on in the first game.</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">hannibal</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The ending kind of sucked.

You (the Divine One) carries out a baby down the stairs. Now why wouldn't you kill that kid knowing what he is? This can only be to lead us on to the next game.<BR> <BR> If there is a next game *crosses fingers* I hope they make a change in how the game plays. I felt that the dungeon areas way overpowered the rest of the game.There were times that I thought Whoa! this is way too much dungeon fighting just to get Item X. Don't get me wrong I love a good dungeon romp. It is just that some of them went on too long when not needed. <BR> <BR> I would have preferred more surface interaction then I got. I would also have liked less linearity than what we had. Yes I know the game had a certain interaction quality to it. But stop and think of how easy it was to "Break" quests just by doing some action out of turn. That is what I would like to see changed mainly.<BR> <BR> I never did get the rescue the cat from the merchants guild sewers because I joined the merchants guild too fast.<BR> <BR> When a player has level 5 lockpick he should be able to open any  door or chest. Yet when I was in the castle I could not open any locked door. This didn't make much sense to me.<BR> Tingalf that was supposed to be arrested by the guards from the black market quest was still by the forge area hawking his wares. Why?<BR> <BR> Why was it neccesary to have the main game screen collapes when you used a skill like repair, or a spell? You couldn't keep an eye on your stats in the heat of battle. Perhaps allowing a certain degree of transparency to this screen would be a big help?<P> When I finished I had like 8 skill points to assign at the end game. Once I became the Divine one I really had no use for any more skills other than ghost form.<BR> <BR> The waste land was really more of a bother than it was enjoyable. I asked myself why do I have to do all this killing just to get to the black lake? Then when I did get there it was an endless killing fest only to get to the bosses.<P> I think the bosses should have been able to be dispatched at the first meeting. You  wouldn't have actually drawn their attention until you had acheived certain degrees of expertise. That level should have put you on a par level with them. Each successor requiring a certain amount of skills before you encountered them. That would have changed the endgame to just the final Big boss.<P> These are just my opinions. I don't expect many to agree with me. Still I look forward to playing the sequel. I think this was a very good game as it was. I can just appreciate any improvements in the areas I outlined.<p>[This message has been edited by Absidian (edited 31-12-2002).]</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
