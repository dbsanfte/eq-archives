<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=20 COLS=75 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by xj6ip:
[I]Sure this game crashes a few times, but not much.  If you have signifigant problems...maybe its your system and not the game.  These people work hard to produce just one game...  People are not in-fallible.  That's probably why Div Div doesn't work on your system...  Someone didn't build your PC right...  Is it a Gateway by any chance???  Those bastards sold me a "performance" PC a year or so ago before I realized it was c.r.a.p.  So I built the system I have now myself and reused a few things from the Gateway...nameley my C drive with windows on it so I wouldn't have to reinstall everything...  Well, that damn cheap HD that I swapped out of my Gateway failed last week but luckily I was able to make an image of it and put it onto a new HD to run my OS off of.  Now I'm only left with the modem from my Gateway...doesn't dial-up suck...

By the way:  Any Computer Games subscribers out there?  Did you read the review of the limited commercial release version of Strike Fighters Project I.  Now there's a game company that has problems.  Div Div is a good game...as for the developers at Strategy First...  My first strategy at releasing a game would not be in the form of a beta "limited commercial release" at full retail price without any indication on the packaging.

Holly crap, William H Masey, and his family Peter, Paul, and Mary.  I'm glad I don't play flight sims.  I would have been very pissed if I had bought that game...

"Boycot Gateway (most people do anyway), be cautious of Strategy First titles in the future, don't knock a game that runs fine on the vast majority of systems, and...  Always carry change for a quarter, but never accept a wooden nickel."

I expect most any game I buy to have a few bugs... they're usually hardware related.  We're playing on PC's, not Mac's.  If you want a system that will play compatible games without ever crashing... buy a damn G4 or I-Mac... there aren't many game titles compatible with those.  But Macintosh does have higher standards than Big Bill, that's why the Mac version of Dungeon Siege won't be out until some time well into next year.  The meticulous bastards want no problems with their hoity-toity, overpriced, CAD-running tricks fouling up.  Macintosh knows exactly what goes into each and every computer they build, because only they build them.  For those of us at the mercy of Microsoft playing on P4's and AMD's, there could literally be anything under the hood of your game system.  Developers can only design and test their games on a limited number of configurations (usually the most popular) before releasing them.  Small bugs will occur.  If they're excessive:

"Open up your PC with the power on, grab a can of Raid, and hose the shit out of every circuit board, connector, and drive you see.  Then call tech support of your respective PC's manufacturer and complain about this game's bugs and how it doesn't work on the sytem you bought from them."

legal notice:  Never spray, touch, or discombobulate any portion of your PC's internall mechanisms with the power on.  Doing so could result in serious injury, brain dammage, or altered thought processes in which you might say:  "Damn that Bill Gates, he gets all the ho's."[/I][/QUOTE]
