<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Fluffy ? Well, it's up to Eve to explain this one       ;)

Anyway, the translation is here. I did it in a hurry, but I'm sure you'll understand all of it. Enjoy !

WorldOnline preview - 18/05/2000:

[b]Larian: the history, the people[/b]

Who’s hiding behind a developer like Larian and what is their path of life ? We ventured to enter the lion’s den. Or the one from the Orcs…

Larian Studios was founded at the end of '95 and started with a shareware game. At Larian they were smart to see that they also could earn money with their hobby.  So they collected all their courage together and went to Atari. They offered 10.000$ for a game. Before Larian could hear the cashier ringing [probably not the correct translation, but you know what I mean, I hope      :)], Atari stopped with that kind of games.

LMK was the new idea of Larian. This project was very promising, but didn’t get off the ground. In August 1996, they had a last attempt to arrange it. Unfortunately, when the last telephone card for the expensive calls to the States had a credit of 0, LMK was put away.

Don’t panic, the Larians are go-getters. The LED Wars was the next project arisen from the hyperactive minds from the Larian-team. The LED Wars was created in five months and seemed to be a success. Larian sets up its name in game land. Some big boys come to visit Larian Studios and *****  wants to pick up LMK again. But unfortunately, there are some problems and LMK disappears.

How does a games developer manage it to keep the head above water during this expensive developing period ? They fulfill multimedia projects, like creating a talking head for Flanders Technology, or they create games for casino’s and television. It seems that Larian has a lot of work. In August 1999 they started creating their new project   :div:, The Sword Of Lies. This time they definitely don’t have to angle for a publisher. The interest is now already very big, both publishers and public.

As you could notice, we took some pictures of the     :div: crew. The ‘music dudes’ deserve a  special mention: Kirill Pokrovsky, Ilya and Stefaan Van Leuven, from Soulwax. Stefaan was on tour abroad with Soulwax, but Ilya and Kirill were so friendly to reveal their musical secrets.

The team behind     :div: exists of circa 20 freelancers from different nationalities: Russians, Canadians. ‘Were do you meet such different people ?’ I asked myself. It seems that game conferences, contacts with other companies and accidental meetings are fertile. Among the freelancers are people with an academic or an informatics education, but also advertisement designers and even one big composer.


[b]Impressive ![/b]
[b]Interactivity and immersion[/b]

The developers of       :div: put their focus on interactivity to reach an immersion as high as possible or ‘a belief in the world’.

I for one was very impressed from what I saw. In the game you can control and/or break almost every object. You can even take papers with information with you, make potions, talk with everybody and much much more. There are no levels, it is one big world and the consistency is high.

The interaction between the different characters is also amazing. Characters decide for themselves where to roam in the existing world. They visit each other and perform several tasks. You even notice if somebody is at home or not because they open/close their doors. Your enemies also have a high AI. They work very much together with each other in teams to bring you to deathland. An example: a skeleton doesn’t always attack, but go back to warn his thinny mates.

With the Orcs you can have a talk, and if you deal with this in a smart way, they become your friends. Then you only have to lure some enemies and they finish the dirty job. 
Day and night relieve each other which you can hear in the background music. If you enter someone’s house at night, that character can become very mad – how would you react on that ! Just be careful that you’ll not be slashed ! 


[b]Story and interface[/b]
[b]Mysteriousness rules[/b]

We don’t have much info on this, ‘cos it’s up to the players to discover the story of       :div:. Maybe we can give you a little more info on the interface.

The Larians doesn’t want to say to much about the story in       :div:. “It’s up to the players to discover this”, says Lar. They talk about four main player characters. One of them is a small boy from 12 years old. Seven races are roaming in the dark world of       :div:, and they don’t like each other that much. War, the human sports as old as the hills, are inevitable. 

To defeat your enemies, you can use loads of different weapons. Sometimes you need to use several spell books to escape out of tricky situations. It takes some exercise to teach yourself the spells and this works out in two stages: first you have to hack ‘n slash to deserve your experience points, then you can exchange these points to learn some spells. Second point: every time you use a spell, you loose some mana. But after some time, this will recover or you can find or buy it. With the money from your unlucky victims, you can buy loads of goodies like weapons and food, and experience points.

[b]Interface: don’t panic ![/b]

If you read the text above, you probably start to think that       :div: is too difficult. Don’t panic, reverse is true. You can pause the game at every moment to catch some spells or to change your weapons. The interface is very easy to use and data driven. This means players can fully configure it themselves. Because of this, it’s also possible to extend the story later on by means of an add-on-patch. Will definitely be continued.

We catched some more funny stuff together and can also offer you some more screenshots and graphics.

What else do we want to say about       :div: ? That the management of the story and the interactivity is running on one of the strongest engines in the world, de L-Story. That this engine is related to the agent system, which makes the characters interact, is also important to know. Maybe we can tell you that despite the impressive graphical quality, the graphical engine is also running on a Pentium 166mHz. Can we also tell you that they play with multiple lightsorces like it is nothing ? Each object in the game possess hundreds of properties. Thus the more than 150 smaller engines are not a superfluous luxury

Before we overload you with our screenshots, we give you some other important information. The playtime for the main quest (without extra puzzles and little games) takes circa 40 hours. The intention is to develop a real time strategy game in a continual       :div:-universe. Normally it should be possible to play over the network or over the net. For the time being, at Larian Studios they are taking care of the game play. 

And now the questions which is burning on everybody’s tongue: “When will       :div:, The Sword Of Lies be released ?” If everything goes fine, you can find this masterly game in the shops in October this year.
