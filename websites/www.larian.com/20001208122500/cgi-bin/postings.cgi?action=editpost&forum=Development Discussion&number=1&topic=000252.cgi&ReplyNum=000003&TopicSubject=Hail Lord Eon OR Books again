<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Here is something on the view of the world by  Human... Can we do kinda this for other races? An, elves?? C'mon it will be fun    :D

[b]Our World [/b]

Universe is made of spheres in each other, the inner sphere being source of all energy and life. But don't come looking for that ultimate source - first, you will never manage; - secondly, it does not actually exist: the innermost sphere you will find still will have inner sphere to it. The elemental cell of universe is shown in a figure I drew during the restless nights. Please note that the "sun" itself has exactly the same structure as elemental cell; elemental cell shown in the figure is "sun" for the outer sphere.

All universe is build in the same way, so we will discuss the mechanics of the world on example of our world keeping in mind that behavioral model we will discover is, more or less, applicable to the whole Reality.
There is only one thing that should be stated before we proceed: "There are no Gods nor "celestial bodies" in this realm. It's much simpler, really, and does not superficial explanations. These who believe otherwise are - sometimes educated but still - morons!

[b]Mechanics of the world.[/b]

We live on the inner surface of the outer sphere. The Sun is the source of energy that is everything for our world. It gives us light, warms, the pressure of energy keeps us (and everything else) falling off the ground and fly to the other side of the world. But nothing is only positive, and if we are serious about the discovery of "what we are?" later, we will have to state that pressure of Sun [u]keeps us [/u] from reaching it [i]and[/i] constantly [u]pushing us[/u] thru the ground. Did not you ever notice how the most comfortable situation is when you lay on the ground on some hill overlooking the place you spend your life - with you family, friends, everyday problems and happy moments, -  possibly big tree nearby, - and you feel so good and quiet - and suddenly you don't know where you body ends and ground starts? Surely you did, and this feeling is there for the reason…

I presume that the word commonly used for the process is [i]dying[/i]. When we died in the Realm we now call Sun this meant that we learned everything what was there to learn and went thru the ground, abandoning physical forms we had there and assuming new ones here. And this process will repeat and repeat because there is no limit on the expansion of universe. We have no knowledge  of the "life" on the "Sun" and we have no knowledge of the life in the realm for which this Realm is Sun. And none shall try to gain this knowledge for this is very dangerous. And this is not just empty words for I believe there is something  SPECIAL ABOUT THIS WORD!

[b]Speculations on the situation in this realm.[/b]

Embrace yourself. I may tell you that years of study lead me to the conclusion that we are now in the Realm which is very close to the edge of Universe. Look at the next inconsistencies and facts I have collected over the years and see it for yourself:

- This realm has [i]flying[/i] creatures! We all admire, afraid of, jealous of dragons, these are extremely power(energy)full creatures - we may assume they are capable of defeating Sun Pressure but all the rest? The energy flow from the Sun is not sufficient, we all soon can fall off the ground! Or someone could reach the Sun and try to re-enter previous realm!

- Since the energy pressure in our realm is not sufficient, our realm, in it's turn, can not produce enough pressure in the Realm we are acting as a Sun for. I guess everyone (knows a friend who) met himself a walking dead (?!?!?!?!) trying to learn about life in this Realm. These are obviously friends or relatives of us who happily were pushed to the next Realm but now, due to weakness of the energy pressure able to return, curious, unresponsible buggers, endangering everyone for the sake of curiosity!

- So called stars! Visible during so called nights! These are direct energy leaks thru our sphere into next Realm. We have to map them all before we can actually do something about them. And someone will have to travel to the other side of the word - directly opposite to us in order to map the leaks at our current locations.

- And these nights, by the way is something unusual by itself. There are certain patterns in how the intensity of energy radiation of the sun fluctuates on long and short (these regular black outs called nights --energy density is much much lower - and much more undead are experimenting with this world) terms, how Sun seems to change it position and actually seem to "travel" instead of being "pinned" in the center - I thought there was a message from the creatures of the Sun (our descendants)  to us (well, obviously their consider us very unstable word and want to learn more about us (- just like these buggers from the outer sphere! Isn't it SO human!)). And look at these thunders! Wielding energy which can not be mastered by the best among us! These are the tools our descendants use to learn about us…

- I have deciphered  the message. Fairly confusing one… It says "La - Rian". In ancient language this would mean something like "faceless", in elves - "many faced" and in orcs it is totally untranslatable "woof - woof"

Now, when you have read this you understand that we should be concerned about the fate of this Realm and the next one. And do everything to stabilize the energy source.


 


How the hell I get my figure- drawn during the restless nights   :D - in? (.bmp)   :(
