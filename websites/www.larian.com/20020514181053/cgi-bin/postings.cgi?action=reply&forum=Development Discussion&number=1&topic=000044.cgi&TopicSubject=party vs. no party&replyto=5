[I]Hi All!

I don't like to run arround alone, but I even like it to have only one Char. to identify with. *stupitthinking*

I know that normaly the one disagree with the other, but I think almost everyone knows the system of fallout ?!? There it was managed pretty well I think! I always feard my Char or even one of the people accompaning me 'll die. But it wasn't inpossible to manage the game without this guys.

In imaging of the fact, that you 'll not be able to do everything, I think that hepls to identify with the Char. Why must he/she be able to do everything? If you play a thief he would try to do everthing "backwards". If you play with a fighter he would make almost everything by using violence. It you play a mage he would try to manage the problems with magic. And so on......

The "only" problem with that is that you must be able to manage a problem by diffrent ways. There the exp. should even depend on the class. If the thief would kill everybody in an open fight, to get an item, he 'll get less exp. than a fighter doing this.
For posibilitys, each char. can [f]try[/f]:

Mage: make invisiblbe, take the thing teleport away.

fighter: kill everybody or intimidate the NPCs, that they 'll give you the item.

Thief: sneak to the thing, steal it and seak away without beeing seen.

If a Char. would manage a other way then his, he would not get the full exp., 'cause he did it not like a char. of this kind would do it.

If somebody wants there could be an universal char. whitch wont manage anything realy good (even at the end ;-) ). He would get an average exp. but never the higest amount. There schould be still different amouts of exp. for each quest, 'cause normaly some things are done one way better, but with this bonus/malus system even the not perfect way could be the best for this calss (But i doesn't need to). At the end all exp. bonus/malus wont help one class to riese faster.

But I get away from the point. ;-) It youst wanished in my mind and I didn't want to open a new topic for it. ;-)

So You 'll have only one char to akt realy with, even if you can give some simple orders to your company.

That is what I think will be the best.

And it makes Realtime gameplay more pleasant, and less complex. The other advantage is that in multiplayer, you could have your own character to relate to. And maybe make it possible to keep your character in both multiplayer, and single-player. I know this could make the game imbalanced, because you can start a game with a super hero, but this could be fixed, by making the difficulty of the game, biased towards the level of the character. (just a thought that pop'ed in my head).<BR>Not having a personnal character was actually one of the things I did not like in Baldur's Gate ( and other RPG's), was that you could  not really do this. You could make a blue print of your character, but that felt so fake. But the worst thing was the joint inventory. That was sooo bad. Our first(and our last) multiplayer was completely ruined by this. Because of the joint inventory, One person could spend all the money, without consent. I know that there was an alternative, but this I found was even worse. I could imagine the quarrels one could have of who, would be this leader.<P>So What I mean is ...<BR>I like it the most when there is only a party in multiplayer (it would be difficult if there wasn't :-) ). And that you have nearly complete control over that character, and his belongings.<P>I hope you understood anything about this ranting :-).<BR><P>------------------<BR>Greetz,<BR>Lord Konradt.<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">lar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hehe  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/wink.gif"> I think there are some people who'll disagree, but I for one agree  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/wink.gif"> Otoh, there are some very good points in favor of a party, and probably it's possible to blend both advantages without too much disadvantages. <P><BR>Lar</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Renyx</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I believe almost everybody on this forum will disagree...except for me and Konradt that is  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>&gt;&gt;probably it's possible to blend both advantages without too much disadvantages.<P>I hope that doesn't mean it will be necessary to switch to turn based combat, because I think that will ruin the gameplay ... for me anyway.<P>Two questions for Lar :<BR>Will there be cinematics in Project C ?<BR>Is that super secret multiplayer option (yes, that one) included in Project C ? <P>Renyx</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Arhu</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hehe!

It <I>is</I> imho easier to identify with a single character than with an entire party. I would appreciate NPC's joining you on your journey, though.<BR>And to multiplayer mode: This is the best way to form a party, I think.

Being able to fight in wars is maybe a very exciting aspect in a game, (at least in realtime, turnbased it's probably HELL!! ). And wars are definitely a part of a heros live anyway (I think).<BR>Another reason Why I'm actually against a party is it's boring in Multiplayer. And because internet is still not a free thing for most of us, it can become costly. so it can get rather painfull to play turnbased - and if there are parties, it would become turnbased - on the net. Even a pause function could be irritating in this scenario. (note: A pause function can be interesting, but not in battle).<P>And besides, these days there are tons of RPG's with a party in them anyway. And there probably will be more in the near future.

This 'superhero' point is very weak. I have never seen any crpg player not trying to get most out of his solo pc or party members. Perhaps there may be one or two, but they are the exception, not the rule.<P>I have never had a feeling during any game as great as in Ultima Underworld I + II. You had your ONE character and a story around it. It has been a great game. <P>In such games you can indentify yourself with the character. I can't do this when playing with a party of four or six. One could even argue this is no rpg at all cause you don't play <B>your</B> character, but it is much fun too.<P>I have never played a crpg twice with the exception of wizardry 7 though. I have loved this game though it is party based and asks for a change of class now and then (only to get you characters better).<P>Both are typical games for single or party and the first one has real time combat and the party thing some phased/turn based combat.<P>I can't understand those guys telling: we need this combat system or we won't play. This is rgp, not some simple action game with a score in the upper left corner of the screen.<P>IMHO it is the game itself, the story, the feeling during the game. We all know we need to fight now and then and perhaps even like it, but it should not be the motivation to play such a game, else you should look for games like Diablo, Darkstone or Nox.<P>In a rpg you have your character developing while it is experincing the story and its twist, lots of puzzles and quests, enjoying npcs running around and telling you weird stuff. This is not some hunt for the ultimate character with the ultimate weapon found in one of 6-20 randomized dungeons.<P>I like those games too (never played anything more than diablo)but those are different and should stay that way.<P>So I don't think the combat system is the key to a crpg, may be a part like graphic and sound but not the key. I am patient to see what project C will show us, since I know we will have multiplayer support  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/wink.gif"> (no not internet, I don't like kids trying to show you how great there characters are...)<P>I play with a couple of friends in a lan which is even more fun than playing a single character.<P>Goemoe</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Renyx</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Realtime is an evolution ... all games used to be turn based, now all games are realtime.

They wouldn't play any RTS because they cannot handle it, but they are quite tough opponents in any turnbased game.<P>There will be turnbased games as long as there will be games at all. Realtime is only one possible way but certainly no evolution.<P>I can't think of realtime combat system for a party.
