<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=20 COLS=75 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Hey! One moment, please, before this discussion drifts way off.
To correct some misconception, maybe, first place:
At what point exactly there has been word of releasing  :div: [i]DVD-only[/i] or merely the indication of such a possibility!?
If that been the case, a DVD-version certainly would be a dumb idea, as the CD-ROM drive install basis still significantly exceeds the one of DVD-ROM drives in computers. So excluding the CD owners from  :div: surely would have no valid stand in a discussion.

Which brings me to the next point:
On what other occasion the necessity of using a DVD [i]player[/i] to play  :div: was mentioned, again please?
Just to prevent any misunderstandings here:
- [i]DVD Player[/i] - the one thing that mostly is intended for [i]DVD Video[/i] playback solely, the [i]brownware[/i]!
- [i]DVD ROM drive[/i] - the thingy built into your computer, nowadays mostly connected to your standard onboard EIDE interface - part of the (i think it압 called this) [i]greyware[/i]

Now, aside from the fact that i don앖 think a dime of standalone DVD [i]Players[/i] and would never consider to buy one if i can have the one device described in my initial post for this "subthread", a DVD version of  :div: would of course predominantly aim on the latter solution for running DVDs. Because it압 of course a computer game! Well, if you want to "double use" , i wouldn앖 stand in one압 way either. I앐 just w/ focus on the more common scenario. :)

So, the arguments for DVD- :div::

- DVDs are the upcoming standard and [b]they will[/b] replace the current CDs, no doubt. This will happen rather sooner than later
- A DVD has more capacity (multifold compared again to CD format!)!
And nowadays games - w/ ever more demanding graphics, not only gfx speed-wise but also in terms of capacity - need it badly. Though i have quite some leftover space on my HD, i nevertheless would prefer to play a game directly from changeable medium over stuffing my disk w/ 1GB+ per game, some of them offer as average installation already today. Especially when considering some more issues in the points following!
- DVD drives are on move up compared to CD predecessors
W/ its prices almost on par now between a quality DVD drive and the common CD drives, it doesn앖 really make sense to buy an CD drive anymore. Except the additional benefit of playing DVD audio/video is meaningless to you. But even then...
- Playing on CD is much louder than playing from DVD as the rpm are just higher in CD mode. And they are mainly [i]unbearbly high[/i] is to stress. 32x+ CD speed is just a waste of money if don앖 need to just transfer big amount of data shortly and/or not working on the PC at the same time! The current CD drives offer riot from the rank in this field. Personally i absolutely hate this and won앖 take it any longer. DVD is a welcome means to get back to reasonable loudness again.
- Finally it is just like that, most out-of-the-box PCs are delivered w/ DVD drives today instead of old CD, so the install base is reliably rising. So by anticipated date of  :div:압 release or if you will at least w/in the first half year of it압 selling time, there will already be (if it is not even now) a strong supply of DVD in potential buyer압 computers (including us or not, that isn앖 relevant).
Therefore i think to bring out an additional DVD-Version (i.e. the very same program, just all its data together on one medium!!) would be well justified!
Nothing else i wanted to express!

In the end it all boils down to this:
If you have "just" a CD-ROM drive in your computer - why bother!? Your getting a  :div: playable on that anyway.
If you have DVD in there instead - fine, you get the benefit of ridding more often CD exchanges and of have the mass of data stored on one easy to handle medium plus all other DVD goodies aside game related (DVD video etc.)

Now, where압 the point against a DVD-Version again? (Except perhaps the costs for Larian Studios!)
