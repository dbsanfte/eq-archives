<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=20 COLS=75 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by DE:
[I]There are other ways to stay healthy besides potions. All of the meats and bread will raise your health although you have to wait after a couple of pieces because it will say your are full. Chicken raises your magic. You can kill bores, wolves, and rabbits everywere you go for food to keep you healthy. I cart aroudn as much meat as possible - and try to eat it first, instead of using potions. There are also cows, pigs and chickens to slaughter on the farms. The most useful skills for keeping yourself healthy are the Restore Health, I have only 1 skill point towards it and its plenty. I normally slug away and cast it. That way you only to keep yourselves stocked with magic potions. Other must have skills are two skills points to Alchemy. The first level is worthless because it only lets you mix some stuff, but with the second you can start making poitions with small empty bottles. Small empty bottles are cheap and often dropped. You just click on blue mushroom with your empty bottle and instant magic which is all you need if you have the restore health skill. The red mushrooms will give you health potions. I usually cart around about 20 small bottles of magic. Next you need weapons repair because as you weapon gets duller you start doing less damage and missing a lot more. Make sure you keep your weapons in good shape or your not going to get killing done.

While I do enjoy the game, I'm getting extremely frustrated about certain things with this  though, and I expect I'm somehow not taking the right approach.<BR> First of all, I've spent a fair bit of time playing Divine Divinity, as a warrior, and am only up to level 15.........you only seem to level by killing things, as opposed to taking the time to do quests, and if you concentrate on the quests, you level VERY slowly if at all.<BR> Secondly, I have about 10,000 gold, and can NEVER find enough health potions to buy. I'm currently basing myself near the dwarf village, at an orc camp to the southwest, where I can sleep (the only place I could find anwhere within reach. There are only two people I can buy potions from at the marketplace in Rivertown, and they will sell me about 3 each, max. Thats barely enough for a brief trip through the wilds, and I constantly have to go back for more. I cant believe you have to continue to constantly play without adequate potions to take on a tough opponent.<BR> Thirdly, while I can kill normal and heavy orcs easily, the giant orcs are simply impossible for me. Heck, I let one chase me into the dwarf village and Rivertown and it killed every soldier and many others in both places. I also have not the slightest chance with the vampire, the Lich in the Cursed Abbey, the Troll king etc. these things can kill me with one or two blows while I am going thru potions like water.<BR> I've bought or found decent armor and weapons, but nothing seems to be enough to allow me to even begin to effectively take on any of the boss bad guys. <P> I would appreciate any help, suggestions, strategies or assistance you could provide so I can continue to enjoy the gem without the frustration I'm experiencing. Thanks. </FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Nightfall</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Oh, and one last thing. I am now getting "encumbered" all the time,e ven though my inventory isnt all that full. I discard just about everything I can, but can easily pick up some things and get encumbered and am barely able to walk. How does one get around this? I just added five points to strength and that seemed to make no difference.

In about ten levels you'll be knocking them down like ninepins.<P>For now I would suggest finding an easier area of the map.  15th level is not very high in DD...</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">lost soul</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">ok first off im played as a warrior to and i would suggest learning the healing spell from the mage skills.you will save alot of healing potions like that.like me i ended up maxing out my skills in healing it really comes in handy and that way you aint popping off health potions like an automatic weapon.<BR>As for your items,you said you have a normal sleeping place and mine is in a barn in the farmlands so all i did is everytime i went back to bed i would drop all my excess items on the ground next to my bed,that way i knew exactly where they all were if i ever found a use for them.<BR>but ya if you have no skills in healing you better get some it will make life alot easier trust me,also since i am a warrior and all i have is my one skill for healing its pretty easy to keep enough mana potions on me because all i use them for is healing,so when i run out of mana points to cast a heal spell ill drink a mana potion so i can caste healing spells.it really does keep you from using alot of health potions.</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Malice_101</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">For a portable sleeping place, simpley pick up a couple of bundles of straw.

Most of the mini-bosses and even main bosses are highly susceptible to it (not all, of course). Undead guys and maybe spiders and snakes are not affected, but just about everything else dies easily especially at higher levels of the skill.<P>Granted, you need poison potions (and lots of them at lower levels of the skill), but put some points in alchemy and you can make your own from poison barrels, certain mushrooms, and rotten food, which I've found everywhere including dungeons.<P>Regards.<P>Rick</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">anakinda</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I am level 16 warrior and I was having some of the same problems as original poster listed.<P>Healing. I put 3 points in alchemy and 2 in restoration.  Alchemy is a great way to make potions in the wild and its fun hunting for mushrooms anyway  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/smile.gif">. Also the level 1 alchemy skill is useful. By combining potions the effects are significantly increased. For example health + magic = rejuvination. or is it restoration....   Anyway the restoration potion heals much more mana and health the two seperate potions do alone. Also great for making poison potions which brings me to my next point.<P>Damage. A great way to increase melee damage is to put a point in weapon poisoning skill. This does mega damage quick even with a just a single point in it. Only thing adding more skill does I believe is add more charges per vial to your weapon.<P>Polymorph  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/smile.gif">.  I was having much trouble with those giant orcs myself until I discovered this great skill. Now I simply polymorph those big Orcs into a rabbit or frog and smash em a few times with my now poisoned hammer and they go down like flies.  For those giant blue orcs two polymorphs usually do the trick. No need to even hit them in their normal state. <P>That and some other handy skills is working great for me so far.  I am loving this game so far. Puts Diablo to shame big time far as I am concerned. Can't knock Diablo too hard though.  It was a great game and provided much inspiration for DD.<P>Anakinda<BR>Orc Pacifier  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/smile.gif"> </FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtextureL.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Alrik Fassbauer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Nice.

Freeze is a warrior's best friend<P>The lich and vampire are not susceptible to freeze, so try meteorstrike, a great low level range spell that takes very little mana and does quick damage. However, you might want to level up a little first before trying those guys, have you been to the pauper's graveyard yet? I found that to be a good place for level 15 or so. <P>Restoration is essential, you should have already gotten a skill point from the lizard healer if you did the dual healing gem quest back in Aleroth. If not, start spending points in it, and also try to look for armor, jewelry, and weapons that give extra intelligence or magic, that way you have more mana for healing. <P><BR><p>[This message has been edited by Warrior35 (edited 22-10-2002).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Serops</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> For giant orcs and elites (which are great experience for your level btw) either freeze, poison weapon, or elemental arrow will turn a formerly tough apponent into a creampuff.  I tend to favor poison or elemental arrow.  With 2 points in alchemy you should never run out of poison and it is extremely powerful.  Level 1 elemental arrow (requirement is lvl 16 so only 1 away) does about 80-160 damage to orcs per mana spent (they have horrible resists), keeps you away from their melee attack, and always hits regardless of your offensive rating with a bow.<P>  As to recovering your health, either use your TP stones to rest alot or mix potions.
