[I] I had the same problem with her and went totaly crazy.  the weapon i used had level 4 frost and that was my savior finally.  I cast skellies and ran. then after they killed most everything I cast shadows and went arounf luring away the deathnight she cast til i got him secluded in another area. Killed him and cast another shadow. Walked up right next to her and began swinging  if she was forzen i kept going  if she broke it i ran and continued same strategy  it took about 4 times but she finally went down.  My weapon was 1h sword with 71-100 damage  level 5 stun and level 4 frost  plus 7 large and extra large buffs on it.  
  Good luck[/I][/QUOTE]

Or have a look at Kroxy's items to buy spellbooks to boost up elemental hail, or good weapons to use deadly gift. Just place a tellie between Josie's place and Kroxy, so you can teleport yourself away and try another strategy. If she blinds you take a shadow potion until the spell wears off. Buy restoration/shadow potions from Kroxy if you haven't the alchemy skill.<BR>  <BR>Bow is good: Run out of the room out of sight and shoot her with arrows, one gamer here wrote, she would not follow, hope you've got elven sight. A poison damage weapon would be good - use deadly gift and scorpions to distract her.<P>Spell shield is good, if she hunts you down, run away and build it up again<BR>Hey, Wildfire, don't worry, Josie angered a lot of gamers here - I had a bad time with her, too      <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/smile.gif"><BR>Freeze is indeed useless as a spell, would be different if you had a weapon with that.

I collected all those mithril armour, amulets etc the imps dropped and put these into the trade window until I had the 50000 for another charm, spell book etc. If you say you haven't collected everything, there must be tons in the desert lying around from your earlier encounters with those imps, specially the chieftains. Is Josie your last boss enemy, have you killed the others (Iona, Cornelius, Moriendor, Demona)? There are 5 black ring members to besiege until the spikes vanish and you may deal with the Demon of Lies. If you stand on the large platform where the middle path leads to the exit, you should see - from left to right: Paths to Josie - Moriendor - Iona - exit - Demona - Cornelius.<BR>No, you can't go over the mountains, there's just a canyon to the orc shaman, your starting point, and the black dragon in the far east, where I got the Crusade Axe. Hope you've got a good shield now, cause the Sword of Gods is a one-hander.<BR>Wishing you luck and patience, Wildfire, big hug back    <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/smile.gif"><BR>Kiya<P>[This message has been edited by kiya (edited 01-11-2002).]<p>[This message has been edited by kiya (edited 01-11-2002).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://www.larian.com/ubb/forumtexture.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Wildfire</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hello again  <IMG SRC="http://www.larian.com/ubb/smile.gif"><BR>I have josie left, killed everything in her place but her & 2 others with her that wouldn't get out of the room and the big guy.
