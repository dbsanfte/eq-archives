The team has been pushing hard lately finishing up the AI library for the Gothica engine.  We've
managed to put together an alpha version of many of the low-level AI commands used to build 
the advanced AI that you will find in Gothica.  We've been able to add collision detection right 
down to the polygon level.  This allows for combat that will approach the excitement and complexity 
of a fighting game.  We don't want Gothica to be a point-and-click game!  
<br><br>
We've updated the visual quality of Gothica to full 24 bit color textures.  Many of the new 3D cards just on the 
horizon will support 24 bit rendering.  This looks really nice and allows for rich looking 
environments!  For older 3D cards, the textures will be automatically dithered down to 16 bit color.  
The current screen shots of Gothica represent the 16 bit color version -- so you will notice a 
slight visual improvement when we start showing the new 24 bit screenshots.  We are also adding 
many new visual effects such as specular lighting, fog, and material based textures.  The visual 
technology of Gothica will be fully scaleable depending on your computer and 3D card.  
<br><br>
We've recently been sent several new Voodoo2 cards from 3DFX.  These are awesome pieces of hardware.  
I can recommend the Voodoo2 to anyone without hesitation.  They have fast multi-texturing 
capabilities that allow for cool effects such as bump mapping.  Bump mapping is an effect that 
we will be taking full advantage of in Gothica.
<br><br>
We have added a new front page: <A HREF="http://www.igs.net/~tinman/tinman.htm">http://www.igs.net/~tinman/tinman.htm</A>
<br><br> 
On the new Tinman Studios front page you'll notice the logo of another Tinman product -- Drone.  
Drone is a game being created using our engine and toolset.  It's an action oriented title with 
lot's of environmental interaction.  Drone will be released before Gothica -- and will hopefully 
be released soon!  We'll be adding lot's more information about Drone in the near future.  
<br><br>
Finally, we've started work on the Internet play aspects of Gothica.  Internet multi-player is just plain 
fun!  More on this as we progress!

	-A couple of new, innovative creatures.<br>
	-More spell effects.<br>
	-Jumping.<br>
	-Wands with special attack animation.<br>
	-Special mesh segmentation system for cutting off body parts.<br>
	-Bar and inventory system.<br>
</blockquote>

We want to replace most, or maybe all, of the current screen shot's on the 
page.  That will happen very soon.  Until then, we decided to send Realms of Gothica
the first show of things to come in the form of a new screen shot.  Check
out their site at:<br>
<A HREF="http://gothica.gamestats.com">gothica.gamestats.com</A><BR><br>

Recently, we added a bone worm that is several times larger than a human 
character.  This is an interesting fight because the creature is so large
and strong that it can forcefully throw the character against nearby walls.  On top
of it's incredible strength, the creature can attack using a breath 
weapon.  Better put your shield up!

We've been working hard on the Necromancer area in Gothica.  This is 
a very large dungeon that is strewn across an ancient, ruined landscape.
The action takes place both inside and outside of these ruins.  Dilapidated
rope bridges made of bone shakily span pools of stagnant sludge.  This is
the home of the Undead.<br><br>

This new area includes a lot of cool interactive features.  The rope bridges
actually stress under the weight of your character.  Skiffs can be used to 
float along some of the larger water areas.  We've been working on a 
healthy set of monsters for this area as well.  Right now, we will have
zombies, skeletons, mummies, flying bat skulls, undead knights, and 
skeleton spiders.<br><br>

All of these new changes in Gothica are very extensive.  The Necromancer
area looks so good and so cohesive that all of our current screen shots have 
been put to shame.  Along with a new user interface system, we've been 
able to bring the game up another notch in quality.  We are so excited about 
these changes that we are preparing a big update to the web site with new 
screen shots.  I'd love to post a shot now, but we want to wait another short 
period of time so we can show lot's of new stuff all at once!  Stay tuned 
because this coming update will be one not to miss!<br><br>

Nice job William!<br><br>

We have been progressing on many fronts lately.  Right now, our
art team is building a village area and finishing some of the
character/monster meshes required for a complete test of the
Gothica game system.  The technical team has moved forward on
artificial intelligence, combat, and the role-playing engine.  
We plan to merge all of the work into one large microcosm of
Gothica in the near future.  Our development team always 
creates stand alone versions of the game every few weeks.  These
versions contain only those features that are at the alpha 
testing stage.  In this manner, we are able to evaluate features
without the excess baggage of work in progress.

For the past year, we've been designing Gothica to be as open
ended as possible.  We want the game to be simple to play, but
so complex that it will take months to figure every little
detail out.  Ideas have flown around the design table by the
thousands.  We have literally hundreds of design sketches.  
With all of the ideas and sketches, one piece of the puzzle
was missing -- how do we bring all this complexity together
in a simple, cohesive, easy to understand system.  Well, a
breakthrough at our last few design sessions has brought a 
perfect solution that we are extremely excited about.  We'll 
leak out bits and pieces over the coming months!<br><br>

To create an open-ended, complex game system, everything must be 
designed to be analog.  By analog, we mean the ability to 
have infinite steps within a given constraint.  This affects 
aspects in the game such as: character progression, combat, 
monsters, quests, and the magic system.  Analog has been one 
of our major design goals in Gothica.<br><br>

We have applied this analog system to the type of character
that you play.  The game plays drastically differently 
depending on the type of the character that you are playing.  
There are no character types that are chosen at the beginning 
of the game.  For example, you don't choose to be a mage or a 
warrior.  Your decisions and actions throughout the game bring 
the type of character you are playing to life.  This is a very 
analog system where you could have a character that is 5/8 mage, 
and 3/8 warrior.  This is a very simple example because there 
are many unique paths that can be followed in Gothica.<br>

Today, we finished the important milestone of isolating a demo of Gothica for 
potential publishers to view.  Over the next few weeks, we will be adding more
and more to this demo.   To the left, you can check out a new screen shot from
the game.  We are hoping to add a few dungeon screen shots in the near future.<br><br><br>

To the right, check out a screen shot from our world editor.  This is one of several
development tools that we created for the Gothica project.  In the future, we will be adding
more information about some of our other technologies and tools.<br><br>
You can also look forward to a new 'chronicles' section on the web site.  In this section, 
we'll be documenting plot, setting, and characters found in the Gothica world.  Consider
this section to be the encyclopedia of Gothica.  Our concept designer will be doing full 
color art for this section.  This is going to be good!

This week, we have been building a large graveyard.  The graveyard is divided by a 
deep ravine into an old area and a new area.  A stone bridge crosses the ravine and brings the player into 
the ancient part of the graveyard.  After years of neglect, the graves and tombs are withered and
dilapidated.  Zombies and other creatures of the night find sanctuary in this abandoned place.
The new area contains a large, central church surrounded by patches of grave sites and tombs.
Beneath the graveyard,  passageways of an ancient catacomb wind their way through the 
underground like roots from a tree.<br><br>

<p><img src="pic2.jpg" alt="Pic 2" align="right" hspace="10" BORDER=no>
In Gothica, we have placed a premium on character interaction with the environment.  
Our new fire engine is extremely powerful and allows for burning of any surface in
the game.  You can burn simple objects such as wooden doors, barrels, and crates as well
as complex objects such as monsters.  The fire is based on real physics so it actually burns 
an object with uncanny realism.  Check out the screen shot excerpts.  The first shows the 
smashing of a barrel with your weapon.  Fragments of the barrel are blown all around.
The second shows the after effects of  a fireball hitting the barrels.  The wood is ignited 
and burns until the barrels dissipate into ashes.<br><br>

Keep watching this site because we are planning on releasing some new shots and 
information in the near future.  We are also planning on adding a cool new 
section to the site!  We’ll keep you posted.<br><br>

The major news of today comes from the creation of this new Gothica website.  This 
site will be dedicated to bringing forth up to date information about our new 
role-playing game.  Watch for news and added sections to appear on this site.<br><br>

In the last week, we've been pulling all of our 
various technologies, gameplay, and artwork together in a preliminary demo.  We 
will be showing this demo to publishing houses over the next month or so in order 
to secure a publisher for Gothica.<br><br>

As far as progress on the game, we've added a new mesh deformation system that will 
allow more fluid and advanced animation sequences.  You can now swing your weapon while
running, jumping, or just about any special character action.  This adds another dimension
to the strategy required in hand to hand combat.<br>
