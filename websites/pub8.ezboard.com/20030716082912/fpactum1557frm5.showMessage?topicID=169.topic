 <br>
My new boss came over to me a whispered that the guy currently in the game section had been in the store earlier that day and was acting suspicious.  So I grabed some games to put back on the shelves and went out to the game section to hang around him ..like we do when we suspect thieves.  The guy seemed to be avoiding the aisles I was in, and would move around to a new aisle when I turned the corner to the one he was in.  He had a black plastic bag in hand (which is weird cause we usually ask people to leave bags at the counter) and within 30 second of me following him indirectly, he walked to the other side of the store.  <br>
 <br>
Well I made my way around the new release wall straightening cover boxes until I got around the side of the store he had gone to...right in the middle of our new movies for sale.  I did the same thing, pretending to straighten movies and prices on stuff.  He soon vacated that area and began 'browsing' our $14.99 used DVD rack by the entrance door.<br>
 <br>
All this time, a guy was standing outside our store 'just hanging around' it seemed...unless you watched him for a minute like I did while I was following man A around the store.  The guy outside definately glanced in the window at man A several times....and I knew what was coming.  So I decided not to push Man A...and went back to the counter to 'talk' to my boss.  At this time the guy outside decided to come in through the entrance door by using the handicapped door button...which holds the door open for 10 seconds or so.  he turned just inside the door and proceeded to ask my boss a question....and man A by the $14.99 rack started walking out the in door that the other guy had 'handi-capped' open.<br>
 <br>
I noticed this of course....thieves have been using this tactic on busy nights when we only notice when it's too late that someone is going out the in door (I have seen families doing this as a unit...getting the kids to come press the handicap button...fucking losers).  But this was a super dead day...they had brass balls to try it as one of the only people in the store.  I immediately started running out the exit doors to try to intercept him coming out the entrance doors....<br>
 <br>
Now the way our store is set up, the entrance walkway and the exit walkway each have an inner door and an outer door and are right beside each other seperated by glass.  So when this guy was through the inner entrance door, I was just slamming open the inner exit door.....the sound drew his attention and he turned his head....and saw me running for the exit.  His eyes went wide and he started to run as well..<br>
 <br>
We exited the store at the same time through side-by-side doors and he turned left...so I was a few steps behind him.  I poured on the speed and flat tackled him in the parking lot, getting a good hold on his jacket.  He had a way better footing and was able to jump to his feet fast and began to drag me across the parking lot while twisting out of his jacket.  He got out after 5 seconds and bolted, bag in hand, and fled across albert st.<br>
 <br>
Fucking shit...If I had been a step close to him I would have had a way better hold on him when we went down than just his jacket sleeve.  Needless to say I was pissed and headed back to the store entrance...only to cross paths with his 'buddy' who had pressed the handicapped door and let him out.  He asked 'did you catch him?'.  I just said to him in a cold voice..&quot;Don't fucking think I'm stupid asshole...I know you and him are a team.  I am phoning the cops right now with your deciption...i suggest you run..&quot;  Then he kinda gave me a 'fuck you' stare and began to walk fast down albert st the opposite way man A had fled.<br>
 <br>
I hate fucking thieves.....but I garuntee they won't come in my store again when I am there.  Too bad his jacket didn't have any ID or anything in it...<br>

<br>
You gotta get into the mind of your common shoplifter.  They want to keep it easy....and getting caught with any kind of weapon on them can increase their sentance if convicted.<br>
<br>
So your normal shoplifter carries only the bare necessities; baggy clothes, a bag, no identification if he's smart...<br>
<br>
I am of the belief that crime is so bad nowdays because of the 'don't interfere with them' attitude in today's society.  I say people should start getting involved...if you see a crime happening then get don't just watch it...that is what they want.<br>
<br>
A few months ago at about 3 in the morning some guys drove a truck through the front window of our store and kicked down our office door to get to our rental game systems.  Took only about 1 minute in total....but the kicker is our store has a coffee shop like 30 feet across the parking lot from the front door.  Was full of people who watched this truck do a few 360's in front of our store and then build speed and go through the window...<br>
<br>
There was 2-3 theives...and about 20 people and staff at the coffee shop...and they just phoned the police and watched.  holy &amp;^%$...if I was there I'd be grabbing 10 people from the shop and heading over there...at the very least if you can scare them enough that they flee on foot the police will have a way easier time to track them down.  You can say dangerous all you want...but unless people start standing up to them, the criminals will keep taking advantage of our fear.<br>
<br>

False.  Crime is not any worse than it used to be.  If you look at the percentage of crimes based on population from previous decades you will see similar numbers.  I would not interfere physically because that is not part of my job and you seriously could get injured or killed doing it.  If it is that much of a problem they need to get a security guard at the door or pay you for checking out movies and security.  These kids where just punks, but you can't be sure.  Only exception to not interfering is my property and my family.  Any man that comes into my home without my permission with ill intent or harms my daughter or wife will be biting the curb while I stomp on his head. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=198911">Corpsed</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub8.ezboard.com/bpactum1557.showUserPublicProfile?gid=naean@pactum1557>Naean</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 123<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(5/9/03 12:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub8.ezboard.com/fpactum1557frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=169.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thursday Night at the video store..</span><hr size=1> I used to work for a toy store, and I know that our policy on shoplifting was to stop them and ask about it if we saw them try to sneak something out of the store.  If they tried to get away at all, we were just supposed to call the police, no chasing, no tackling.  Actually, you'd probably get written up for chasing for putting yourself in danger when the company's liable.<br>
<br>
Point is, they weren't stealing from <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>you</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, they were stealing from a major corporation.  I think it's safe to say that your safety, and possibly your life, are worth a little more than a couple used videos to the company.  And besides, they probably get a huge tax writeoff for estimated losses whether you stop the shoplifter or not.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents...do what you can to stop shoplifters, but keep your safety priority over the stolen shit. <p>Nae</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub8.ezboard.com/bpactum1557.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jestoz@pactum1557>Jestoz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 502<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(5/16/03 6:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub8.ezboard.com/fpactum1557frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=169.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thursday Night at the video store..</span><hr size=1>  I agree with C...as I was reading your post Vil I was thinking to myself that it would have been very easy for this guy to pull a knife and stick it in your throat...All it would take is a junky strung out on drugs looking to score for his next fix.

<br>
I look at it and say...if this guy has the ability to do that do I just want to stand back and let him go?<br>
<br>
I would feel personally responsible should the guy I let go hurt someone on his next attempt.  I think it's totally worth it.<br>
<br>
This isn't about movies being stolen...this isn't being taken advantage of....nor is this 'risking your life for a minimum wage job'...this is simple belief that thieves should be caught and punished...and that it is all our resposibility as a society to do our part.  I have always felt that way and I always will.  People can think I am stupid for taking such 'risks'...think whatever you want because it's a free country.<br>
<br>
But I wager you would think diff if I let the guy go and the next day they kill your spouse in a store robbery...<br>
<br>
Get involved in your community...get to know your neighbors...start a neighborhood watch program.  Be attentive, alert and careful...but do not be detached.  When I need help the most I hope I get someone like me who isn't afraid to step in and get involved because they weighed the risks and figured it would be in their best interest to stay out of it.  That's what is wrong with society today.<br>
