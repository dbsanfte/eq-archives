                TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h2>
                <p>
                <strong>0.</strong>
                This License applies to any program or other work which contains
                a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
                under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
                refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
                means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
                that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
                either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
                language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
                the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".</p>
                <p>
                Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
                running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
                is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
                Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
                Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>
                <p>
                <strong>1.</strong>
                You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
                source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
                conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
                copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
                notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
                and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
                along with the Program.</p>
                <p>
                You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
                you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>
                <p>
                <strong>2.</strong>
                You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
                of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
                distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>a)</strong>
                You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
                <p>
                <li><strong>b)</strong>
                You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
                whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
                part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
                parties under the terms of this License.</p>
                <p>
                <li><strong>c)</strong>
                If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
                when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
                interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
                announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
                notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
                a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
                these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
                License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
                does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
                the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
                </ul>
                These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
                identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
                and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
                distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
                <p>
                Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                collective works based on the Program.</p>
                <p>
                In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
                with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
                a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                the scope of this License.</p>
                <p>
                <strong>3.</strong>
                You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
                under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
                Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>a)</strong>
                Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
                source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
                1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
                <p>
                <li><strong>b)</strong>
                Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
                years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
                cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
                machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
                distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
                customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
                <p>
                <li><strong>c)</strong>
                Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
                to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
                allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
                received the program in object code or executable form with such
                an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</p>
                </ul>
                The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
                code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
                associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
                control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
                special exception, the source code distributed need not include
                anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
                form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
                operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
                itself accompanies the executable.</p>
                <p>
                If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
                access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
                access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
                distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
                compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
                <p>
                <strong>4.</strong>
                You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
                except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
                otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
                void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
                However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
                this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
                parties remain in full compliance.</p>
                <p>
                <strong>5.</strong>
                You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
                prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
                modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
                Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                the Program or works based on it.</p>
                <p>
                <strong>6.</strong>
                Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
                Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
                these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
                restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
                this License.</p>
                <p>
                <strong>7.</strong>
                If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
                distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
                license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
                all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>
                <p>
                If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
                any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
                apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
                circumstances.</p>
                <p>
                It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
                implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
                generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                impose that choice.</p>
                <p>
                This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
                <p>
                <strong>8.</strong>
                If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
                certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
                may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>
                <p>
                <strong>9.</strong>
                The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
                of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
                be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
                address new problems or concerns.</p>
                <p>
                Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
                specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
                later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
                either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
                Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
                this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
                Foundation.</p>
                <p>
                <strong>10.</strong>
                If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
                programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
                to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
                Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
                make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
                of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
                of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
                <p><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong></p>
                <p>
                <strong>11.</strong>
                BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
                FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
                OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
                PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
                OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
                MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
                TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
                PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
                REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
                <p>
                <strong>12.</strong>
                IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
                WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
                REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
                INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
                OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
                TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
                YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
                PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
                POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
