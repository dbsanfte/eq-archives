  <li><strong>General Idea:</strong><br>
    &nbsp; Imagine a world much like our own was millions of years ago... During the Mesozoic
    era when Tyrannosaurs Rex, and Saber tooth tigers roamed the land. &nbsp; The new world is
    often undergoing dramatic and violent changes.&nbsp; Mountains form seemingly over night,
    volcanoes erupt spewing rivers of molten lava.&nbsp; Now imagine a creature appearing in
    this world with higher intelligence than any other creature existing on this world (i.e.
    the human/ caveman).&nbsp; While much more intelligent this new race is physically
    inferior to many of the creatures that now dominate the lands.&nbsp; This new race quickly
    realizes it must adept and over come the challenges its faced with or quickly become
    extinct. Crude tools are formed and the development of crude weapons to aid in their
    survival.&nbsp; Some of the &quot;men&quot; (generic term) learn the ways of the land and
    its herbs.&nbsp; These shamans while physically weaker than most of the hunters are often
    looked to and highly respected in the clan due to their prows of healing, and mystic ways.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concept in a nutshell is that a player is born into this land as
    one of the races of&nbsp; primitives and must find a &quot;clan&quot; (much like a guild/
    family) to hunt/ work/ defend and aid. Only in large groups or &quot;clans&quot; do these
    people have any hope of survival. Team work is developed to take down the larger beast
    needed to feed the clan. Or the clan may have to simply defend themselves from packs of
    vicious beast that roam the lands (i.e. packs of sabertooths etc..)<br>
    &nbsp; <br>
    <strong>What makes this game unique?</strong><br>
    &nbsp;</li>
  <li> Unlike most games there would be no money, trading and bartering would be the way of
    self improvement. (Example): Tor kills a sabertooth and is lucky enough to be able to
    salvage one of the teeth but doesn't need it?&nbsp; Mean while Ugh caught a fresh batch of
    fish and found a bamboo stalk... Tor needing food offers to trade the large tooth to Ugh
    who has seen some of the other warriors fishing and hunting with these teeth tied to the
    ends of long bamboo stalks just like he found!!<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Communication is still very primitive in this world. Instead of
    chat/language communication is done via emotes. (Example):&nbsp; Tor hoots at Ugh. Ugh
    grunts at Tor.&nbsp; Ugh points at Tor and his sharp point stick then waves off towards a
    small group of deer suggesting he wishes to hunt. Tor beats his chest in agreement. Ugh
    hoots in excitement!&nbsp;&nbsp; For those persons who do not desire to role-play their
    caveman/women a group ooc or a clan ooc could be implemented. These could also be used to
    plan and organize large hunts or things that require much planning.<br>
  </li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being a new world there would be no magic weapons or powerful armors
    etc...&nbsp; Tools are developed and discovered.&nbsp; Knowledge is traded from clan to
    clan for goods etc.... (Example) Ugh discovers by combining his new sabertooth fang, some
    deer gut, and the bamboo pole he can now poke holes in his prey much easier and from a
    further distance than he could when just using the fang alone. &nbsp; Meanwhile Tor
    discovers that the new bear hide he traded for combined with some bone shards (needles)
    and deer gut (string) makes a nice warm thing to place over his upper body.&nbsp; Not only
    that but seems to have saved him from a vicious mauling from that cave bear him and
    another group where hunting!&nbsp; Seeing Ugh with his new sharp stick he hoots and grunts
    at Ughs stick then at his &quot;shirt&quot; suggesting he wishes to trade information on
    item creation.&nbsp; While there would be no magic weapons and such there would be ways to
    get better equipment maybe that obsidian spear tip is much sharper than the flint tip..
    Maybe the hide of a giant swamp lizard is much more protective than the bear hide... etc..<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li> Races / clans areas and development.&nbsp; Many areas of this world would be semi
    isolated from other areas only through great preparation, exploration and a great effort
    on a clans part would they be able to &quot;move&quot; or travel to a distant land.&nbsp;
    In the desert area the small pigmy race would be fleet footed and very resistant against
    heat. Many creatures would be only available/located in that area to hunt.. This would
    provide that area with valuable items for future trade. While some cavemen in a temperate
    zone may have a large abundance of food, or access to a wide variety of plants that no
    other race has access to except for trade. Eventually the races would meet to some degree
    and trade routes could open or even schools teaching ways of survival and or production of
    some items (all player driven of course)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Minimal to none NPC's.&nbsp; No shop merchants, no guild masters etc... everything is
    dependent on players.&nbsp; There might be a NPC hunter or a NPC shaman (to aid with heals
    or cures and such when perhaps no player shaman would be on).&nbsp; The primary focus
    would be for players to run their own events etc... (example) Droot the shaman has heard
    rumors of a strange root in a distant land filled with many trees that can cure his chief
    of the madness disease he received when fighting the wolves with foaming teeth...&nbsp;
    Droot has heard this trip is long and deadly and knows he can not make it alone.. With
    much hooting and grunting Droot stands on the clan rock and points at the chief and his
    wound.&nbsp; Then Droot turns and looks of into the distance and points.. Many eager
    hoots, grunts, and chest beating come from the clansmen and women offering their aid to
    protect the shaman and their chief on the journey to the land of the unknown...<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are just some of the general ideas for what
    would make the game different from many of the others out now.&nbsp; The world would be a
    massive online player game with changeable points of views from first person to third
    person etc.... </li>
