do not.&nbsp; We will have Mounted archers, and foot archers, we will have calvery, we
will have scouts, we will have healers, we will also enlist special persons to be used as
spies.&nbsp; Why not just do things on your own and not take any orders. &nbsp; We'll
going out on your own or in a small group is fine.&nbsp; But many are not powerfull enough
to go out and take on the really powerfull creatures one on one or even 4 on one.&nbsp;

loyal&nbsp; you may become a member of the militia.&nbsp; There are a few test, and one
must practice the ways of the code.</big></p>
