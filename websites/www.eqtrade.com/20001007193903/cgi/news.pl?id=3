<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>From Theosis Korondor:<br><br>GM Event on Mithaniel Marr Server:<br><br>The Unrest in Unrest (told in third person)<br>A stalwart band of adventurers of the guild Vanguard of Marr were headed to Unrest for the night. It was this place they had learned they could obtain Bloodstained Tunics for the many rangers in their guild. During the trip through Dagnors Cauldron, they heard a few rumors about some adventurers of the evil races running about slaying those trying to rid Faydwer of the undead that infest the place. Vanguard of Marr charged on to face the evil beings, and hopefully clear a path for all others to continue the assault on the Estate of Unrest Castle.<br><br>Upon stepping onto the property, Wizard Theosis was greeted by a shrunken female Ogre wearing plate mail and toting a nasty looking 2 handed sword with a blackened appearance to it. Being a follower of Quellios the Peaceful, he attempted to communicate with the Ogre. Taking offense to his wave, she began beating the life-force out of Theosis' frail body. Shaman Aaross and Cleric Venyent tried healing Theosis faster than this nasty ogre could take his life-force, but their efforts were in vain. Theosis was forced to flee. This ogre, who remains nameless in my mind, then commenced to take delayed offense to the healers saving the life of the one who offended her by waving! Aaross was forced to flee, but Venyent was spared her wrath when many others began to swarm about to aid us in our battle.<br><br>Shortly after, Vanguard of Marr regrouped with Wizard Gerard and Druid Arduinna and discovered that this Ogre was the leader of 2 or three more nasty critters. After a battle that seemed to take hours, Guild master Ranger Kel’anth Ra’Dar landed the killing blow on the wretched beast that assaulted his favorite Erudite Wizard. Kel’anth was heavily wounded, but the prize seemed well worth their troubles. Kel’anth searched the ogre’s body and found a Rubicite Breastplate and a Black Iron Bastard Sword!<br><br>It simply must have been Mithaniel Marr himself granting a reward to those that risked their lives in the name of all that is good in Norrath!<br><br>Thanks! <br></font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>From Wes Parker:<br><br>On Saturday, October 2, a large group of players of the massivelymultiplayer online game EverQuest will be meeting at Veteran's Memorial Park in Culver City. For most of the attendees, it will be the first time meeting people with whom they have interacted exclusively from within an online world. The game is set in the sword and sorcery genre has developed its own subculture. It has been described as the &quot;digitalversion of crack&quot; (Hunter Godfrey, quoted in Wired Online), as manyplayers spend as much of their free time as possible playing the game. Since the adventure of the game is completely dependent upon the interaction between the players, EverQuest has put to rest the commonly held assumption that computer gaming is a solitary activity. So what will happen when these online aficionados get together in flesh and blood for a day of merriment in the real world? We will soon find out.<br><br>The event began as a casual post by player Kevin Scott on an Internet site devoted to the game, inviting fellow players in the Los Angeles area to &quot;come hang out at a park or something&quot;. Over the course of the following few days, the scope of the event grew to include over 150 attendees. Some attendees will be coming from as far as Florida to attend the event. The get together has also drawn the attention of several representatives of Verant Interactive, one of the threecompanies responsible for bringing EverQuest to life. These membersinclude the Verant CEO, John Smedley, and several members of the game's development team, who will be attending the event.<br><br>To keep up to date on the developing plans for this event, please visit:<br><a href=http://www.csunbooks.com/eq> <a href=http://www.csunbooks.com/eq>http://www.csunbooks.com/eq</a></a><br><br>Also, an update from the LA Event site:<br><br>09/15/99 <br>Just when I thought the registration rate was slowing down, we got 32 more registrants, raising our expected turnout to this event to 183! Thanks for all the interest everyone, and keep publicizing this on your severs and on the message boards. <br><br>There is an issue with the park in that we need a permit to bring this many people to the park, and Veteran’s Memorial Park isn’t going to be available for us on that day. I’m leaving in a few hours for a weekend trip to New Zealand (I’m the best man in a wedding), but the coordination team is working on this issue. More information as it becomes available. <br><br>As of now, the date still stands, but we have to decide on a different venue, which we will select from the list of alternates that we have.<br><br>Thanks! <br></font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>From Elos:<br><br>Around 8:00 pm est I was told by a Cleric named Archurian how to make raw-silk armor. This is the first person I have heard of to make the armor so I give credit to him =). Here is how to do it. You will need a large sewing kit and a skill lvl of 20 (hehe this is real easy stuff to make) and some spider silk. First you take spider silk (not spiderling silk you need to get this silk from there full grown brothers). Now you take 2 spider silks and put it in your large sewing kit. Hit combine you will get a silk swatch (this was trivial to me at skill lvl 25) now that you have the silk swatch you take that and put it the large sewing kit with the pattern of your choice. Hit combine and whalla. You get a raw-silk item =) easy right? Tunic/Robes and pants take 2 swatches to make all others take 1. The items can be worn by the pure magic classes and monks. due to there low wt. they are good for both groups. They have one ac over cloth so they are really only good for low to mid lvl. The robe that you make looks like a light brown (like the thurm robe). None of the garments have any magic stats on them. I have been charging about a plat for each garment and 2pp for robe and pants.. I have been selling everything I make to hehe. Due to the low lvl of skill needed to make the armor I don't think you can charge much more then that. I would encourage each of you to tell as many people as you can on how to make silk. I think that if we have a free flow of information we will quickly be able to figure out what Verant made with this patch =). <br>P.S. Spider silk can be found on giant spiders which inhabit many zones throughout norrath. <br><br>Also, from Halelil of Bristlebane:<br><br>Many people who have found out about making raw-silk armor do not wish to reveal the information to the majority, but I feel everyone has a right to know. So far I have learned that you need to make swatches to make raw-silk armor. To make a swatch you combine 2 Spider silks(not spiderling) in a lg or sm sewing kit. You then put in a pattern with the swatch and combine to make a piece of raw-silk armor. To make a tunic and leggings, you need to stack 2 swatches and the pattern. Enjoy, I usually sell these items for 5gp each, for the cost of the spider silk, 3gp, and pattern, 6sp. If you have any questions <a href=mailto:Thomas874@aol.com> e-mail me</a>, I will gladly answer any questions. <br><br>Thanks! <br></font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>From Anduril Valar the Tareldar Paladin:<br><br>Well, the Additional Guild Commands Petition has been on the EQ Haven website for two and a half days now and we have already received over 250 signatures! I have written a letter to Mr. McQuaid and Mr. Butler concerning this petition but no word back from them yet (of course, I only set it just yesterday so hopefully on Monday we may get some feedback). I just want to thank everyone who has signed it and I hope these simple but very useful commands do become part of the world we know as Everquest soon. For those of you who have not heard about the petition (and how could you have not, I think I had it in the news on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesay!), let me give you a brief description on it. This petition would add the following commands:<br><br>/guildwhoall - This command will list ALL members of the guild, whether they are ingame or not. A FANTASTIC tool for guildmasters and officers and just for members who want to know who is in their guild.<br><br>/guildwho - This command will list all members of the guild that are currently online. Great to know who is on in your guild.<br><br>/rank - To be able to supply your own rank (Only officers or the GM could do this).<br><br>Furthermore, I would like to reiterate that the /guildwhoall and /guildwho functions are NOT /who functions, they are /guild functions. With that said, only members IN that particular guild could use them, just like /guildsay.<br><br>So, if you have not yet voted but would like to or would like more information on this, follow this link to EQ Haven and let your voice be heard!<br><br><a href=http://www.eqhaven.com/petition_guilds.shtml<br><br>> <a href=http://www.eqhaven.com/petition_guilds.shtml>http://www.eqhaven.com/petition_guilds.shtml</a><br><br></a></font></td></tr>

I have done this against mywill only to keep my children alive while they sit among filth,imprisoned in the dark elf city of Neriak. The High Lord Graffe ofDarkmoon is holding my children captive just inside the walls of thecity but try as I might; I have not been able to free them. The lastresort to free my children was to raid the Darkmoon treasury and stealone of their most prized artifacts, a staff of some power, and hold itfor exchange in the release of my young ones. <br><br>A note from my son Jallaan was smuggled out of Neriak and hasreached my hands; alas my hopes to free them have been dashed. Itappears that the evil races are gathering soon to hunt me down and killme. I wish not to have my head used as some heathen's doorstop, so Ihave gone into hiding with no hope of getting my children back. I call out now to my friends and good citizens of Norrath to aid mein my time of need. My children sit now just inside the gates of thedark elf city waiting to be released from captivity. If any of Norrath'sgood people were to gather together and free Jallaan and Gwena fromcaptivity, I would be able to come out of hiding and leave my terms ofslavery. In turn for this great deed, I'm willing to turn over all theartifacts that I have pilfered from the Darkmoon treasury to those whorescue my young ones and deliver them back to Halas safe.<br><br>I have seen the guards of Neriak and know this will be no easy taskto accomplish. The first group that is able to enter the city anddeliver the two children back to Halas will have all the hoardedtreasure in my bank within Halas.<br><br>Please aid me in my time of need, you will not regret the help youlend me.All those interested in freeing my children should meet at the entranceto Nektulos on the East Commonland side, Sunday, September 19th at 9 amPST (12 noon EST). <br><br>Thank you my friends, <br><br>Leber of the Xegony Frozen North <br><br>( ooc/ This quest is open for &quot;light&quot; races only. The two barbarianswill be waiting just inside the Neriak Foreign Quarter zone and willgroup with the first adventurers that zone through. The group will needto make their way out of Nektulos before any spell or song can be usedupon the two barbarian captives (example: invisibility, teleport,cloud...), but the two barbarians will aid in the escape anyway they can(including SoW if needed). In the event that one of the barbies diesalong the way, they will need to be escorted back to their body fromFreeport zone. Once the group reaches Halas, Jallaan will retrieve apack from the bank and turn it over to the leader of the group. The pack will include many magic items and a rare, high quality bear hide, total value is close to 1000 plat.)<br><br>Thanks! <br></font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>This item was found at the <a href=http://www.eqvault.com/> EQVault</a> website and is of extreme importance:<br><br>&quot;I just wanted to shoot a warning out to those that might be considering, or are already in a transaction to purchase an Everquest account on Ebay. Currently, we have evidence that there are several individuals that are attempting to defraud legitimate bidders, and Everquest gamers out of large sums of money. &quot;On 09/06/99 we decided to partake in the auction of a Level 50 Cleric character. The bidding on this character was proceeding slowly, and it looked like we would win the bid at around $320.00. Suddenly, a new bidder entered the arena, and put in a single bid proxy bid at $800.00, up from $320.00. We attempted to outbid him, and were forced to enter a bid of $810.00 to finally win, as he didn't escalate it any further. <br>&quot;Normally, this would appear to be how competative bidding works. However, we investigated further, and spent many hours on Ebay researching closed auctions and the accounts of regulars that post or purchase Everquest accounts. We discovered that the aggressive bidder in the auction we just won purchased the very same account on 08/29/99 for $399.00. 6 Days later, someone new is selling the account, and the person that is driving the bids over $800.00 is the same person who purchased the account 6 days prior? Its called bid padding, its a fraud, and is a felony in some states, and is considered wire fraud in a select few states. It gets worse, the original seller on 08/29/99 was another one of the high bidders! The bidding was stuck at $100.00 for the account, and the original seller comes in and bids $399(amazingly) and begins the drive to rise the cost of the character, he never bids again after this initial boost. <br><br>&quot;Speculation leads us to believe that we have a <i>group of delinquent minors that are using Everquest and Ebay to defraud </i>many innocent people out of hard earned cash. We caution anyone that is considering purchasing an account to deal with only adults, and individuals with positive feedback, references and to very carefully research the Ebay databases for prior auctions. <br><br>&quot;Everquest accounts have been sold for up to $20,000 on Ebay. <i>Clearly, a vast majority of these auctions are padded, inflated, and simply fantasies of minors wishing big things. </i>We've seen people spend large amounts of money on frivalous things, but the facts are clear, most true, legitimate everquest accounts have a <b>real market value of between $100 and $600.00. </b>If you are paying much more than this, the likelyhood of the bids being padded is tremendous, the likelyhood of you being defrauded is extremely high. They are banking on the fact that at least one legitimate person wants the account, and will keep bidding on it against their &quot;Staged&quot; competitor/s, driving the price to high levels. We've seen accounts that they haven't played there con game on sell for $100-$300 for well geared level 50 characters. So the obvious plan of action they are using is to scoop up level 50 accounts at a low cost, then resell them a few days later, driving the price up with their con game partners. <br><br>&quot;Currently, the Attorney Generals office in my state is investigating the bid we were a part of, and the young man that attempted to defraud us.&quot; <br><br>- Robert<br><br><b>Caveat Emptor 9:50 AM </b><br><br>Due to the recent Ebay situation, it is necessary to remind our players of &quot;Caveat Emptor&quot; - Let The Buyer Beware.

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Brad McQuaid had the following to say on alt.games.everquest, in regard to the new Yield policy.<br><br><i>So 6 level 25 campers are taking a larger risk to get the special loot from a level 32 mob, than my solo level 36? I don't think so.<br><br>-Jim Williams</i><br><br>Both the group of level 25 players AND the level 36 player are fine going after a level 32 mob. They all get exp. The yield rule does not apply there. The yield rule only applies if the player doesn't receive experience from killing the mob he is trying to camp. <br><br>A level 38 still gets exp off of a level 32, so the Yield rule would not apply. <br><br>If you think about 'soloing' as gaining exp and therefore levels playing by yourself, then by definition you couldn't be subject to the Yield rule, so I don't think the Yield rule threatens solo'ing. (Unless 'soloing' really means to some people sitting on a spawn that is absolutely no challenge to you, farming it for items, and refusing to get out of the way of a legitimate group who wants to actually enjoy a dungeon that was made for them). <br><br>We are sticking up for solo players here, despite the fact that some people who post here think I'm out to get soloing :)<br><br>-Brad<br><br>Thanks Brad! <br></font></td></tr>
