<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Brad McQuaid's been busy over at the alt.games.everquest newsgroup. First, on programming EverQuest as an evolving game:<br><br>People expect an evolving, dynamic game. That means we add new things to the game. Being imperfect human beings, we also occasionally add new bugs as we add new features and make changes. This is going to be true for all MMORPGs.<br>We've added a bunch of new features, quests, items, etc. We have new zones on their way as well.<br><br>Our programmers and game designers are still working on EverQuest, not the expansion. Only the artists are working on the expansion. This will continue to be true, especially for the programmers, because we will keep adding features before and after the expansion, the expansion's focus being primarily on new content, mainly new zones to explore and a new playable race.<br><br>I'm not sure how you could reconcile your opinion that our decisions are based only on making money, and then imply that people are leaving and we don't care. Would that not get our attention (were it true), if our only motive was to make money?<br><br>In any case, making a damn good game AND making money is my motive, and we will continue to make EverQuest better and better. And based on continued amazing sales, a very low churn rate, and more and more people playing during peak hours, we must be doing something right :)<br><br>Rewards and advancement relating to level:<br>I don't think we're straying at all from our original plan that it takes the average player around a year to make level 50.<br>Actually, there are less ueber-mobs now, and they are certainly less of a threat now that higher level players exist and are often hunting them. <br><br>I never advertised it to be an easy game, that's for sure.<br><br>Part of [the abundance of higher level characters] is the kiting problem, and part of [it] is that some players play 12 hours a day. I [am] referring to average players.<br><br>People being twinked doesn't make you any less able to obtain a good non-twinked item for your level and then play the game.<br><br>The quest items should be lore -- I will check into this.<br><br>I would have bought banded by the time I'd encounter mobs that drop rawhide (this being to make trade skill products attractive). <br><br>No, we haven't done any major, sweeping 'loot nerfs.'<br><br>Items obtained off of your basic mob your level should not be significantly powerful relative to your level. But a decent group of players, all around the same level, can absolutely head into a dungeon (or kill a rare spawn outdoors) and obtain items valuable to the party. <br><br>We're even going back and upping the exp. on many quests to make them even more attractive, but to imply that there aren't already many quests like that is simply false. I hate to actually recommend a spoiler site, but if you aren't aware of the hundreds of quests out there and you don't want to look for them in-game, go take a look at one of these sites that takes unfortunate pleasure in listing many of them. They're there (the quests and the sites). <br><br>I think [having to play for hours at a time has] pretty much been a part of RPGs for years, certainly MUDs and online RPGs. In any case, it all depends on what you're trying to do. I certainly head into the game sometimes and solo a few blues for 30 minutes or so and then camp out. Every trip into EQ doesn't have to be an epic journey, however that is where the game truly shines. <br><br>[Giving XP to all players who do damage to a creature] is easy to code. But it would in our opinion both make kill stealing worse (because a group can always outdamage an individual) and make it much harder to solo. This is NOT the solution to kill stealing.<br><br>[Giving XP only to the first player to damage a creature] is totally open to abuse. Players could use this to both annoy and kill steal and make the situation much worse.<br><br>Recent policy changes:<br>The rules of conduct are on everquest.com and will be updated soon [with recently-made changes]. <br>Thanks Brad! </font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>From Rupert Furrytoes:<br><br>Tonight the might beast Nagafen fell for the first time in the world of Solusek Ro. With approximately 50 people there to join in, such groups were made up of members from Heroes of the Seven Suns, Phoenix, Imperial Order, Clan Delaf, Rest in Peace, and several others. Leading the expedition, Sorn, a wonderful monk of great reknown, showed great leadership and managed the pulling of the giants without much trouble. He deftly managed to bring one or two which were laid to rest quickly. The might Warlord Skarlon felt the awesome power we brought and hit the dungeon floor before he could toss one of the gargantuan boulders at us. He carried the highly sought after Mithril Vambraces as his treasure. <br>Clearing the other giants was just as easy. As we approached Nagafen's resting area, we formulated a plan to deal with the giants first that were surrounding her. This worked great as only a regular warrior came along with Magi Rokyl. He gave us some trouble with his Gravity Flux spell but was put down earlier. Only one life was lost up to this point, and that was only because the world ceased for a few minutess before it decided to start spinning again. <br><br>The final task, dealing with Nagafen. All buffed, and every conceivable pet summoned, we met the dragon head on. Many fell in the beginning from that horrifying fear spell, others to the dreaded *you have lost connection* demon. But in the end, Nagafen did fall as did about 30 of the warriors. These were quickly resurrected to share in the glory. Nagafen had 3 items, a Cloak of Flame, a Heirophant's Crook, and Blight, Hammer of the Scourge (so goes the theory of server unique items). Several GMs were there to witness the fall including Solist, head GM. <br><br>Hearty thanks go out to the following (excuse me if I forget a few names): Tallyn, Excelander, Ogdan, Shalinn, Sorn, Jmellow, Talanon, Rurik, Katn, Tannis, Tolan, Thazul, Sarion, Elyria, Cristopher, Brunen, Bainn, Maclir, Balthek, Gokou, Slaine, Verminax, Faledaye, Airoeu (i think that is how you spell it), Lronius, Noskilia, Callie, Jatarri, Savak, Saltin, Mature, Brahmabull, and all the other I can't remember. <br><br>'Twas a glorious day!<br><br>Thanks! </font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>*Guild Update* <br><br>Our programmers have spent the last few weeks completely revising the guild file structure, which should eliminate the loss of guild status that has occurred on some of the EverQuest servers. We are comfortable with the amount of time our test department has spent checking the changes internally, in addition to the extensive testing performed on the Test server. If the changes to the guild code work as planned, all of the current guilds should be converted to the new format - a process that is performed on the server-side and would not effect current guilds in any way. However, due to the sheer number of guilds that have been established throughout the live servers in comparison to the number of guilds tested, there is a possibility that a few, or possibly all players may lose their guild status after the update. In a worst-case scenario, some or all of the guild leaders would have to be reassigned by GMs. If this is the case, our Customer Service department has a complete record of all guilds and guild leaders across all of the servers. As an added measure, we will have additional GMs on-staff beginning tomorrow morning at 9am Pacific to begin addressing problems if they arise. Though the possible initial effects of this change to the guild system may seem unsettling, it is a change that must take place to assure the long term wellbeing of guilds as a whole. <br><br>The servers will be coming down tomorrow morning at 7am, Pacific. We are estimating that the servers should be back on-line and fully accessible by approximately 9am. <br><br>- The EverQuest Team <br></font></td></tr>
