<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>EverQuest, despite being released nearly eight months ago, continues to break sales records. 989 Studios issued the following Press Release announcing EverQuest's latest accomplishment:<br> <br>EverQuest Breaks All Online PC Game Industry Sales and Subscriber Records<br>FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(ENTERTAINMENT WIRE)--Oct. 18, 1999--989 Studios(TM), a Sony Computer Entertainment Group Company, announced today that its top-selling online PC title EverQuest(TM) has broken all subscription-based online gaming sales records. <br><br>In only six months, EverQuest has sold more games than any other online role-playing game ever released, with 225,000 units sold and an active subscriber base of more than 150,000 players. <br><br>EverQuest has changed the traditional lifecycle and sales curve of entertainment software,'' said Kelly Flock, president, 989 Studios. What is most impressive is the fact that EverQuest's sales and subscriptions numbers are continuing to grow by the thousands week after week. Frankly, EverQuest is performing more like a blockbuster movie than the usual online computer game.'' <br><br>The allure of EverQuest, which released in February 1999 -- and was developed by 989 Studios' PC division, the predecessor of Verant Interactive -- involves the game's multitude of expansive adventures and detailed quests that provide a unique interactive storyline that evolves according to a player's decision. Players can choose to begin the game in any of three continents, with more than 70 adventure zones and 12 cities. Each of these continents has diverse species, economic systems, alliances and politics. <br><br>EverQuest is way ahead of its time, both technologically and conceptually,'' added Flock. Its continual popularity can be attributed to its uniqueness and addictive gameplay, which differs from any other form of personal entertainment, be it books, movies or even videogames. Simply, by transporting the gameplayer into another world, with tens of thousands of people playing online simultaneously, EverQuest offers gamers an unparalleled immersive social experience.'' <br><br>During peak periods, EverQuest adventurers and dragon slayers can form alliances with up to 37,000 other players simultaneously. The active global EverQuest subscriber base is comprised of players from various countries throughout the real'' world, including the U.S., England, Canada, Singapore, Zimbabwe, Saudi Arabia, France and New Zealand. <br><br></font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The <a href=http://www.arina.net/eqmentors> Mentor Program </a>EQ is here to provide answers and help.<br><br>The Mentor Program will consist of experienced players who are willing to volunteer their time to help the inexperienced community. Holding &quot;answer sessions&quot; in newbie areas, participating as a Mentor for an assigned newbie, providing your services free, are some of the duties of EQ Mentors. <br><br>Don't guides hold answer circles? Guides in the game can hold answer circles, but some guides lack the play knowledge or just can't answer questions like &quot;What's the best shield for a paladin at level 12?&quot;. When was the last time you actually stumbled upon a guide holding an answer circle? They are busy with petitions dealing with everything from corpse recoveries to &quot;Do I lose exp in a duel?&quot;.<br><br>If you are an experienced player on the Povar server and wish to be an EQ Mentor, please contact me at <a href=mailto:crysta@arina.net>crysta@arina.net</a>. <br><br>The Duties of a Mentor:<br><br>--Must dedicate at least 4 hours of playing time per week to the Program (this can be done by spending time with your assigned newbie, or by holding answer/helping sessions).<br>--Has to hold at least 1 answer/helping session in a newbie area per week.<br>--Mentors are assigned newbies of the same class (or class you are experienced in) so you can provide helpful advice on everything from equipment to skill building. NOTE: This does NOT mean you are twinking this newbie or have to give him/her any items or money. It is your choice to spend time with him/her in person, provide advice in tells, etc. However you want to help him/her is fine.<br>--You must log the time you spend mentoring. The more time you mentor, the more praise you get ;)<br>--An optional thing is to submit a summary of what you did at the end of each week. Include suggestions, things people asked/requested, etc. Reports can be submitted to <a href=mailto:crysta@arina.net> <a href=mailto:crysta@arina.net>crysta@arina.net</a> </a>and will be posted on the Reports page once that goes up.<br><br>A Few Goals:<br>What I am hoping for if the Mentor Program turns out how I intend, we will be working closely with the Guide Program; taking the questions players ask in petitions that any experienced player could answer and answering them. <br><br>Instead of a guide telling a player &quot;I'm sorry, I can't help you.&quot; because a player died in an area where he cannot retrieve his corpse himself, the guide could respond with &quot;Because you have not died to a bug or technical error, I cannot help you. However, if you contact someone from the Mentor Program, they may be able to assist you.&quot; <br><br>I also wish for the Mentor Program to expand past Povar and branch onto the other servers. If you are not on Povar and wish to manage the Mentor Program branch on your server, please contact me.<br><br>Other Things:<br>As the program expands, I will be adding much more onto this website. I hope to get a form up (possibly today) that will allow you to sign up for the program -to become a mentor- through this website.<br><br>I will put up an FAQ about the program because I know there are a lot of questions people will ask (like &quot;The newbies that you assign to people, where are you getting them from?&quot; etc.) and they are questions that get repeated constantly.<br><br>I feel this program is going to give the bored higher-level people something to do. I know as a level 46 cleric that I'm in no rush to 50 because I see how bored a lot of people are. I, personally, find it fun to sit in greater faydark for a few hours and buff newbies, heal, bind -- most of all ANSWERING the 100 tells I get asking very simple questions.<br><br>-------------------<br>Arina Online<br><a href=http://www.arina.net>http://www.arina.net</a><br><a href=mailto:info@arina.net>info@arina.net</a><br><br>Thanks! </font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I received the following from Kathia: <br>Centuries ago the knowledge concerning the Day of Light was sealed into the sixth of the seven books of the Scrolls of Marr, the Book of Prophecy. Revealed at last, the prophecy foretells the coming of Mithaniel Marr, the Lightbearer, in the lands of Norrath at the location known only as the Place of Birth, to reveal the Holy Path he has set out for His children. <br>This most holy event will take place this evening on the Sisterhood of Erollisi, in the vast Ocean of Tears. Not only the children of Mithaniel Marr are invited, and indeed, followers of all the true gods, be it Karana, Rodcet Nife, Brell, Tunare, Erollisi Marr, Quellious or Prexus are most welcome to attend, for perhaps we shall be blessed by holy signs from these gods as well. You need not be a strong adventurer to attend - the weakest of the children of the light will be as welcome as the most valiant warriors. <br><br>The forces of Innoruuk probably have learned of this event by now, especially considering their recent attack on the Sisterhood. We welcome them as well. Those of them who shall be present, even if their intentions are malignous, will be cleansed in the glory of the Light of Marr and of the true gods, and their souls shall never again doubt that theirs is a fallen god. It is in that spirit that we invite you all to welcome these misguided pawns should they be present, and simply let them witness the might of Truth. <br><br>The head of the sisters of Erollisi, Styria Fearnon, has made sure that preparations were complete before the arrival of the crowd, and the sisters will be glad to have you there. <br><br>Once again, here are the complete coordinates to the event. <br><br>Day of Light celebration<br>Sisterhood of Erollisi, Ocean of Tears<br>Saturday, October 16th<br>7 pm PST <br><br>You may find more information at The Temple of Marr <br>(<a href=http://www2.iro.umontreal.ca/~dodetorp/Marr> <a href=http://www2.iro.umontreal.ca>http://www2.iro.umontreal.ca</a>/~dodetorp/Marr </a>) <br><br>For the eternal glory of Mithaniel Marr and the true gods, <br><br>Kathia du Lac, Knight of Truth, Child of the New Sun and Sword of Mithaniel Marr <br><br>Thanks Kathia! <br></font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>From Valder:<br><br>I know that many think that anyone who purchases an EQ account on eBay deserves what they get. Still, even if one disagree with a persons actions in this case, that is no reason to wish them ill (we all work hard for our RL money, we just choose to spend it differently). With that in mind, I want to post a warning to those who buy EQ accounts on eBay. I am going through a tough time now with an account that I bought a little over a month ago. It was a lvl 40 character and <br><br>I have enjoyed playing him this past month. All of a sudden one night I can't get in. I know I did not forget the password, but still I can't get in. I call The Station the next day and sure enough someone had the password reset. I suspect the original owner. Sony Customer Service reset it for me and I log in and sure enough everything is changed. The registration info in EQ has also been changed and sure enough the original owner (some may know him on eBay or in EQ as Vanderben) has put all of his info back in (name, address etc). This confirmed my suspicions he is trying to steal my account. I won't detail how he did it but suffice it to say that as long as the current subscription is running (even if the subscription is canceled, which mine was) the original owner can possibly get the password changed until you re-subscribe (which Sony won't let you do until the current subscription expires). Even if the buyer has changed the password and the registration info, it is not full proof. During a long discussion with The Station Cust support I was told that they have dealt with this situation a lot and that unless you know the seller you are opening yourself up to a lot of problems if you get a unscrupulous seller (obviously, but I did not expect problems after the original exchange). This can happen months after the purchase and you have added many hours or items to the character. The Station suggests that you press charges through eBay, or they have in fact permanently canceled accounts when the real owner can not be identified. If I had realized this and the relatively high probability of loosing your money, I would have reconsidered my purchase. <br><br>Watch Out,<br>Valder<br><br>Thanks! <br></font></td></tr>
