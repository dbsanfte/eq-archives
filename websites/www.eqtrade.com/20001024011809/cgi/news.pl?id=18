<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Saaladin posted word of the Cazic-Thule Traveling Bazaar, a new and upcoming player event: <BR><BR>On Saturday, April 17, 1999 the wide fields outside the gates of beautiful North Qeynos will be home to the very first occurrence of the Cazic-Thule Traveling Bazaar. <BR><BR>That's right... on Saturday a gathering of buyers and sellers from across the world will set up shop outside Qeynos to exchange their wares for fun and profit. A place where all can gather, all races, all classes, away from the watchful eye of city guards and tax collectors. <BR><BR>For all the merchants, craftspeople and tradespeople on Cazic-Thule, now you have an opportunity to sell your wares in a proper environment... No longer /auction your wares and hoping for a buyer, no longer weighted down with heavy inventory while adventuring... a dedicated market for your fine products. <BR><BR>For those adventurous travelers, who have risked their life and limbs to gather treasures from around the globe, a gathering of buyers who want and need your hard-earned trophies. A dedicated market for all those rare and much sought items that you won from the hands of the fell creatures of Norrath <BR><BR>For all those hardy souls, braving dungeon and wilderness, here is the opportunity to get the pieces of equipment you have heard so many rumors about... A place to get what the average city merchant just can't supply... <BR><BR>So come one, come all, and join us on Saturday the 17th for what I hope will be a monthly occurrence, travelling from city to city, providing a forum for all the people of Norrath to gather and do commerce. Tell your friends, tell your enemies, and show up for the event. <BR><BR>The event will last all day, but we are hoping for a "prime time" for the Bazaar of 6:00pm EST to 9:00 EST.</font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Carl posted the following warning concerning a means of swindling players through the game's trading system: <BR><BR>Two people claiming to be paladins were offering to sell rare items, such as Mino axes in the area of Greater Faydark. They would initiate a trade with a player and then switch the item after the purchasing player had clicked trade. <BR>In my case, I checked that the item he was offering was indeed a Mino axe, but then after I had clicked on the trade button, Leoric switched the Mino axe for a rusty axe. <BR><BR>This can be avoided by making sure that the person selling the item has locked in the trade before you lock in the trade, however it still means someone has got to initially put some trust into the transaction. <BR><BR>Of course, when I realized what had happened (which was immediately after the transaction) and confronted the offender on it, he laughed and stated that he had checked with a GM and that such duplicities were not a violation of the rules. I don't know if this is true, as I never received an answer to my petition. <BR><BR>Some may say that I should have known better, that it is my own fault. Maybe they are correct. However, that is not my point here. My point is to warn others. <BR><BR>The main point here is to be extremely wary when completing trades that involve valuable equipment, since a good number of different items in EverQuest appear completely identical while in icon form. </font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Derek posted a possible solution for those who are experiencing frequent and inexplicable lockups while playing EverQuest: <BR><BR>Hello, I wanted to bring something to everyone's attention as this is an issue that plagued me for weeks. If anyone is having any problems with their game just freezing up and forcing them to either reboot or reload EQ, I have the solution. When I opened up my computer I noticed that an extreme rush of heat came from my processor as I played more and more. <BR>Then when it finally crashed, in 10 seconds it was cool again. My game was crashing every 10 or 15 minutes, and now that I have placed a large fan next to my computer pointing at the processor I have played for 5 days straight with no problems... A friend of mine also had the same good results. My theory is that, since mine and my friend's 3D card were the closest item to the processor, the heat from the processor was heating up the 3D card to a point that was causing it to fail, it is possible that simply relocating your 3D card may solve the problem as well. <BR><BR>Remember that keeping your 3D video card is very important (particularly when overclocking), contact your card's manufacturer for more specific information on whether this could be a serious problem for you. <BR></font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>John Smedley, Verant's President and CEO, post the following update: <BR><BR>As a reminder, we will be doing an update Tuesday morning at 3am pst. This will be a pretty good update since it fixes a number of things Server Side as well as making some enhancements to the client, including allowing Glide for Banshees. <BR><BR>One VERY, VERY important note. Banshee users should go to the 3dfx website and download the latest drivers. If you don't, you run the risk of locking up with Black Screen upon trying to enter the game. I expect this will be the major cause of people's grief for the next 24 hours (Banshee owners that is). <BR><BR>Also, we've found to critical bugs Server Side.. One is a crash bug and one is the cause of a lot of people losing their corpses when they shouldn't have. This is the number one thorn in our side (and your's I'm sure) and we're happy that it's fixed. These patches are up on the Test Server for those of you that want to check them out early. <BR><BR>Thanks,<BR>John Smedley</font></td></tr>
