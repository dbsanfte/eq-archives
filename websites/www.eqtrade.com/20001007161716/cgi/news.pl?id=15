More details over the next few days. I'm not trying to be vague on a date, we're just finalizing some details. <BR><BR>   2) The European units really shouldn't affect the US users since they tend to play at different times (I realize this isn't 100% the case but it's largely true). <BR><BR>   3) Overcrowding on Fennin Ro - I can't completely claim to understand this... people seemed to congregate on Fennin Ro... it's like trying to understand Traffic patterns or predict Earthquakes. Over all the other servers we saw pretty even distribution. <BR><BR>   I hope this answers your questions. <BR>   John Smedley <BR><BR><BR></font></td></tr>

I will be checking the replies compulsively and replying to anyone who would like to help expand the scope of this event.

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>     Hello All, <BR>   Well... thanks to all of your help we've been able to find a significant corpse dissapearence bug. We feel that this is a significant enough problem to warrant updating the servers during normal hours today, as we don't want anyone else's corpses to dissapear. We've also extended the amount of online time characters above 5th level have to recover their bodies from 8 hours to 24 hours (online). <BR><BR>   In a nutshell, the Corpse Recovery rules are as follows: <BR><BR>   Characters All Levels: If you have no items on your corpse, it will dissapear within 3 minutes. <BR><BR>   Characters Level 1-5: Corpse will dissapear within 30 minutes (real time) whether you are online or offline. Those of you wondering why this rule is in place? - There would be WAY to many bodies if we didn't do it this way. <BR><BR>   Characters Level 6 and above - Corpse will dissapear within 24 hours if the player is online (being at the character select screen STILL counts as online). Corpses will dissapear within 1 week if the player is offline. <BR><BR>   In addition, this server patch will include the following: <BR><BR>     1) Warrior's now get a "Berzerker Frenzy" if they are down to under 35% of their Hit Points.<BR><BR>     2) Several server side crash bugs have been fixed. <BR>I also wanted to mention that we have begun shipping units to Europe. Units should be in Electronics Boutique in the UK in a few days. Germany and other places in Europe will be hitting shortly... and Austrailia will be seeing units shortly as well. <BR><BR>  John Smedley, President and CEO of Verant <BR><BR>Thanks! </font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Marduk is attempting to put together a charity mailing list for all players. Seems like a very interesting thing, I might check it out myself.<ul><BR>Hello, my name is Marduk and I'm a big fan of the CRPG scene and have been for many years. I am currently a big follower and player of OSI's title Ultima Online and Verant's EverQuest, while looking towards other games to open up in the future.<BR>The games are all excellent, but without their communities, they would cease to exist. This is one of those times I'd like to see us all pull together and I'm hoping that we can do so for one common cause.<BR><BR>The guys over at ONElist, a free email listserv company, are holding a little bit of a competition that goes hand in hand with community called the "Grow to Give" Program. They want to see the largest growth in community imaginable over a small two month time period. The community that takes this prize home will be given $5000 to donate to a charity of their choice.<BR><BR>So what I've set out to do is to have our online computer gaming community shine above all others.<BR><BR>I've created an announcement mailing list which will promise a minimum amount of messages (just update status on the contest) and allow us to step up for a truly great cause.<BR><BR>To sign up, go to<BR><A href=" http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/crpgcommunitycharity"> http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/crpgcommunitycharity</A><BR><BR>We have set up a list of charities<BR><BR>(<A href=" http://www.onelist.com/survey/crpgcommunitycharity)"> http://www.onelist.com/survey/crpgcommunitycharity)</A> that the members of the list are allowed to vote on. Once we win (and I'm hoping we do), the charity with the most votes on our list will be the recipient of our donation.<BR><BR>I do hope that all of you will step up to this role to help out those who need it. After all, we have learned a lot as members of this community. We can all hopefully come together for this great cause! So tell all your friends and get over to ONElist and signup for it, it only takes a few minutes of your time!<BR><BR>Thanks to all who help out!<ul><BR><BR></font></td></tr>
