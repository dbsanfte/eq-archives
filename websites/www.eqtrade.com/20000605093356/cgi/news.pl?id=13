<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Citizens of Norrath,<BR><BR>We are pleased to announce that the hardware upgrade that was performed on our router this morning has appeared to resolve the severe packet loss problems that many players were encountering over the past week.  We have been, and will continue to monitor the load on the new hardware to assure that the packet-loss problems will no longer occur on our end.  During the router upgrade we transported the Karana server farm to the AT&amp;T CerfNet facility to further reduce the load on our router.  Also, the new "Rodcet Nife" server was just brought up to accommodate the additional users that have joined over the past few weeks.<BR><BR>After thoroughly testing changes made only for Rallos Zek (PK server), we have activated the new code for the PK server ONLY.  The changes include the following;<BR><BR>1) Pets will no longer kill themselves if their master has invisibility cast on them.<BR>2) Pets will no longer attack other players while they are in guard mode if their master goes link-dead.<BR>3) Pets will now attack opposing combatants while their master is dueling.<BR>4) NPCs will no longer respond to invisible PCs.<BR><BR>Other fixes and changes include:<BR><BR>1) The corpse class tag will not be listed as "Unknown".<BR>2) Players will be given text messages for items that they cannot obtain while looting a corpse, instead of the item disappearing.<BR>3) A number of quests and combat related exploits were fixed.<BR>4) Characters are no longer able to use the disarm command while using feign death.<BR><BR>At Midnight, on Wednesday the 28th, the servers will be brought down for an update.<BR><BR>- The EverQuest Team</font></td></tr>

These issues will be addressed tomorrow morning beginning at 9:30am. We will be doing some maintenence on our Router here, so the game will be unavailable for about an hour. This solution should take care of things quite handily. <BR><BR>In addition tomorrow we will be moving the Karana server over to CERFnet, as well as setting up the newest server Rodcet Nife. We tried to do this today, but we had some logistics issues with CERFnet and we had to delay this until tomorrow. <BR><BR>I don't have an exact ETA on Rodcet Nife, except to say that it will be tomorrow sometime. You would be amazed how many people were sitting in chat today just waiting for this server to come up ;) <BR><BR>We do apologize for the inconvienence this downtime will cause, however we think that everyone will be a lot happier once this Packet Loss goes away. <BR><BR>John Smedley <BR><BR></font></td></tr>

So, to commemorate these creations, a celebration and meeting is occuring in the large room/cavern in the tunnel (zoning point) between North Ro desert and East commonlands. This great event will be known as the dawn of our era, and less formally, the Dawning Assembly. <BR><BR>This celebration should be the first of many yearly (in-game years, since 1 EQY=1 RLmonth) celebrations and meetings. Pet duels, duels (contact myself if interested in participating) drinking, trading, talking and much more will be at the event. <BR><BR>Date: May 1st 1999 (Saturday)<BR>Time: 5 P.M. PST (8 P.M.

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Here's John Smedley late last night with information concerning the state of the current game servers as well as the upcoming additional world server: <BR><BR>While working with UUnet today on some other issues, we found and fixed a configuration problem on our end which was resulting in extra packet loss on many of our servers. This problem has been resolved and I believe you will all see significantly less packet loss. <BR><BR>I want to make sure that when we have a problem on our end and correct it we notify you of that as well, since many people feel we are quick to blame someone else. <BR><BR>There's no point in blaming a problem on UUnet if it's our problem. In this case it was on our end and it's fixed. This was a different problem then the one we were seeing last night on UUnet, but it probably amplified it. <BR><BR>I also want to remind everyone that we are working on getting another server up tomorrow. I'll have a further update on that in the AM tomorrow morning. <BR><BR>And here's this morning's update: <BR><BR>Well.. I'm hesitant to give an update... I can't say my last update was timed all that well. 10 Minutes after writing it we had a problem. At the risk of doing it again: <BR><BR>We've found out that the solution we put in place earlier didn't fix the problem entirely. We need to make some more changes. <BR><BR>In addition, we are going to be bringing up another server tomorrow and probably be moving at least one existing server farm over to CERFnet. We will announce which one will be moved tomorrow AM. <BR><BR>John Smedley <BR><BR>Thanks !</font></td></tr>

I don't know most of the High elf leaders, But the Gnomes who come to Greater Faydark with there parties, are Devlin, Ilsen and Curbik. There is plenty more of both races. Just in the last week, about 25 high elves and Wood elfs went down to Steamfront. They were met by a wave of Gnomes.
