<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Keani wrote up the following report from the recent Tarew Marr Festival player event:<ul>Hail! Although the organizer of the festival, Aylan, had account problems and eventually had to drive to a friend's house and start a newbie druid, the festival went very well. I ended up trying to get everything together, and, to my suprise, the festival went on! Two guides showed up, one an ogre and one a gnome, and there were drinks, duels, and races. There were two footraces, one that lacked organization, and the winner was not recorded (my fault) and one 'offical' one that Keyan the wood elf (aren't those wood elves the quickest my kin?) won, although there were many contestants. There were many duels, one 'official' one between Keyan and Multam, and many others that people decided to start on their own. I particularly remember a fight between a barbarian with a halberd in chain beating up on a halfling. Considering the problems we ran into, I believe the festival went very well. Many people showed up, everyone got drunk, some people levitated others, and everything just seemed to fall into place. <br>These are all of the people that I have to thank for helping the festival become a reality when Aylan could not get in (sorry if I spelled anyone's name wrong :) ): <br><br>Mathim: This guy offered to help me run the festival, and ended up helping with much of the running of the festival, thanks Mathim!<br><br>Multam: This guy also helped run the festival, and was a participant in the 'offical' duel. Thanks Multam!<br>Temvarina: Again, thank you so much for helping to get the festival started and for drinks in the beginning.<br>Xenozide: This wonderful Erudite made sure that everyone who needed it go bound to the area, thanks!<br>Sironion: Another binder, thanks! We needed more people like you!<br>Lamron: This guy spent 10 platinum on drinks for the party at the last minute, and was constantly handing them out during the entire festival, thanks!<br>The two guides that showed up: I think it's great that Verant can spare some time to come to a festival of us mortals :). <br>And anyone else I missed, sorry that I did but I was so busy getting drunk and organizing things that I only had time after the festival to try and remeber people's names, sorry! <br><br>Perhaps another thing of the sort can be done for summer? </ul><br><br></font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Den sent me the following announcement:<ul>I just got back from the first day of E3 (Electronic Entertainment Exposition) with some very interesting news concerning the upcoming expansion set for EverQuest, which is on display at the Expo. I got a chance to speak to a number of the guys from Verant and was able to squeeze a few details out of EverQuest developer Mike Hutchinson. The new expansion set will open up the continent of Kunark, one of the two leftover continents from the original atlas (visit <a href=http://eq.stratics.com/beta/atlas.htm>http://eq.stratics.com/beta/atlas.htm</a> for maps of both Kunark and Velious). The new continent will contain approximately 15 unique zones and a variety of new monsters--some of which will be larger or palette-swapped versions of existing monsters--including Leeches (giant blood-sucking slugs), Giant Scorpions and Mosquitoes (bigg ones). The most exciting expansion feature, however, is the addition of a new player race--apparently a new sort of humanoid lizard being with infravision, that will either be neutral or evil (brand new graphics, so nothing you've seen before). <br>The guys over at 3DGaming.net also got a chance to talk to Verant about the new expansion and have uncovered further details about the game that may be found in <a href=http://3dnews.net/morearticles.x?daysago=0#9805>this article</a>. The post contains information that some players may not want to see, since it pertains to mega-high levels areas and features of the game. Here are the more important tidbits that were revealed:<ul><li>Two of the new zones will be named &quot;Paineel&quot; and &quot;The Field of Bones&quot;.<br><li>More than one boat will go to the new continent, not JUST the left dock at Butcherblock mountains but also one or two from Antonica. <br><li>Rogues get poison &quot;soon&quot;. <br><li>Trade skills are being HEAVILY modified so that they don't suck. <br><li>Typing &quot;/zone&quot; will zone you to anywhere... but only if you have a GM client. Damn. <br><li>Expansion will raise the level cap, but [Verant] didn't say how much. At least 25 levels, though. <br><li>If you make level 50 before the expansion comes out (pretty solid for Christmas) you're screwed for XP. You won't get any until the expansion comes out. <br><li>The expansion will most likely be marketed like the UO expansion; a nominal fee for current players. They're not looking to make much of a profit on it. <br><li>Quests are also being HEAVILY worked on. With every patch, they add (and fix) more and more quests.</ul><br>I'll be revisiting the Verant display both tomorrow and Saturday, so look forward to some more juicy information on what is surely now the number one entry on every EQ player's drool list. (Thanks to Jim for informing me of the above article!)</ul></font></td></tr>

Due to location, it is assumed most participants in the event will most likely be passers by boarding the boat or arriving in Freeport. This is a 'test' event and more similar events will be coming shortly (nothing during 'Star Wars' week though). As a reminder, sellers at the event should avoid using /auction to prevent screen spamming (trust me - filling someones screen isn't going to make them want to buy your goods hehe). Periodically, Specific goods for sale will be announced by members of the Republic of Freeport to gather attention to specific merchants, the event as a whole, etc.</ul><br><br></font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Will sent me the following:<ul>The Republic of Rivervale is starting. After the success of the Republic of Freeport, we are expanding and will have a republic for all the cities of Norrath. There will be a higher republic that consists of all the internal division leaders called the Republic of Norrath. These people will meet to discuss the progress they have made at their cities, any help they may need, trade routes being opened, and any other ideas that may be discussed. Each republic can have their own government and events and ideas as long as they keep trade open between the cities and have the division leaders and do not forget that and have 1 leader. At the moment, there are 2 republics, Rivervale and Freeport. Internal leaders of these are Krozy and Bamador. The Republic of Freeport is known and has mostly everything they need. The Republic of Rivervale still needs 3 people to be division leaders, as well as people wanting to be in council. We also need people to contribute by coming to meetings when they are scheduled and giving their ideas. If you are interested in joining up, email me at <a href=mailto:WPsoft62@bellatlantic.net>WPsoft62@bellatlantic.net</a>. If you do, I can tell u everything that is to happen and what you can do to help. I hope to see many people interested in this and would like to help out Norrath by giving it a government, better than the ones already in the cities. This will be worthwhile to anyone wanting to make a name of themselves by helping others, and also to gain money and friends. So please reply to this as soon as possible so you can pick whatever you would like to do. We have many spots open. If you want to know them, just email me and I can tell you.</ul><br></font></td></tr>
