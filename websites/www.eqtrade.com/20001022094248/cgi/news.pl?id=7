<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Looks like the Barbarians of Halas have some new neighbors to be wary of--namely M'gug, K'muug and G'muk, some seemingly prominent Ice Goblins. Here's more, from Joril: <ul>Greetings and well met! <br>I bear grave tidings from Everfrost on Tunare's Wondrous World. I fear war is approaching. Everfrost was probed last night by a small scouting party of ice goblins. <br><br>I was in a hunting party running from a botched attack on a mammoth calf. (It's mama didn't take to kindly to me hacking at it's youngun.) <br><br>Anyway, I ran from them, all the way back to Bandl. I continued past Bandl to the clearing just beyond him. As I was catching my breath, I noticed an ice goblin eyeing me hungrily. At first I thought nothing of it, then I noticed something strange about this creature. It had a name! As I realized this, it attacked me, screaming "M'gug is tired of filthy barbarians like you ruining invading our realm!" <br><br>Well, needless to say, after being wounded by the mammoth, M'gug made short work of me. (3hits) By the grace of the gods that be, I was resurrected and I returned to my corpse. As I was gathering my belongings, I was again attacked by this named ice goblin. And he had 2 others with him! (Their names were K'muug and G'muk) <br><br>I ran for Bandl but I did not make it in time. <br><br>I was again given life and this time I teamed with my Unkle Mortekai, a shaman of the 15th circle. We recovered both of my corpses and then formed a war party. The tundra echoed with shouts on the wherabouts of these vile things. By this time, all of Everfrost became aware of this goblin raiding party and there were at least 20 experienced hunters, warriors, mages, etc there. <br><br>The ice goblins made another run on us. This time we were prepared and a vicious skirmish erupted. We slew the vile creatures. After that, nothing else happened. I and my party scouted the tundra for signs of more but there were none. <br><br>After returning to Halas, I pondered the dire implications of what had occurred. I fear war is coming. These creatures have never before been seen in Everfrost. And what troubles me most is that there were at least 2 barbarians accompanying them named Meri and Karldanin. I saw them with my own eyes. <br><br>I sought enlightenment from the spirits but they had no information to give. (/who meri resulted in no such player in Everfrost blah blah blah. Same with /who Karldanin) <br><br>Since there were only 3 of these things, I believe it to be a probe to test our defenses. <br><br>I fear we must step up our vigilance and be on constant guard. Any and all information about this would be most helpful. </ul><br><br></font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>An invasion of Kerra Isle will be taking place on the Innoruuk server:<ul>WHAT: A mass gathering on Kerra Isle, to give those Kerrans the thwacking they so richly deserve. Kerra Isle hasn't been explored en masse like Blackburrow/Crushbone/Paw because nobody goes to Odus and because Erudites with any sense head to Antonica at around 4th-6th level. While people like to gripe about having 40+ people in Blackburrow, the fact is that all those people keep the spawn down to a manageable level so that you can walk down to the main cavern without getting greased. This does NOT happen on Kerra Isle for the reasons cited above, and so it's a particularly deadly place for low level characters. I'm hoping to change that by getting it packed with folks, just like Blackburrow. If enough people show up, the low-level players can hang out near the bridge, the more advanced players can swarm the dock area, and the 12th+ level characters can explore the depths of the zone. This will keep the spawn down and the trains to a minimum. <br>N.B.: Kerra Isle is NOT the small island in the Erud's Crossing zone. That island is referred to either as Wisp Island (because it has lots of wisps) or as the Isle of Erud's Crossing (because when you enter the zone, it says "You have entered Erud's Crossing"). Kerra Isle is a zone that is reached by swimming a short distance out from the Western coast of the Toxxulia Forest. It is called Kerra Isle because when you enter the zone, it says "You have entered Kerra Isle." And because Brad McQuaid says so. :) <br><br>SERVER: Innoruuk <br><br>WHEN: Saturday night, June 5th, 7:00pm EDT (4:00pm PDT) <br><br>SO WHAT'S KERRA ISLE?: Kerra Isle is the "dungeon" zone for the continent of Odus. <br><br>I NOTICE YOU HAVE "DUNGEON" IN QUOTES. WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?: Well, Kerra Isle is not a dungeon in the traditional sense of the word. It doesn't have lots of twisty passageways and it's not underground. <br><br>SO WHAT MAKES IT A "DUNGEON?": Because it shares the characteristics common to the other dungeons on Norrath: Swarms of low-level MOBs, interspersed with higher level MOBs. <br><br>WHAT'S THE LEVEL RANGE?: Same as Blackburrow or Paw, i.e. Levels 5-15 will get the most enjoyment out of it. For purposes of comparision, consult the following chart: <br><br>Kerran Catfisher = Gnoll Scout<br><br>Kerran Scout = Scrawny Gnoll<br>Kerran Male = Gnoll<br>Kerran Female = Gnoll with 5th level shaman spells<br>Kerran Pridesman = Gnoll Guardsman<br>Kerran Huntress = Gnoll Guardsman with 9th level shaman spells<br>Kerran Clawknight = Elite Gnoll Guard<br>Kerran High Guard = Gnoll Commander <br>ARE THOSE THE ONLY KERRANS?: Dunno. Never explored that far into the zone. There is, however, a level 20 (or so) Necromancer on an island in the zone. <br><br>WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?: Exploration. Possible riches. Possible death. A change from the Blackburrow/Crushbone routine. Since this zone isn't massively camped like Blackburrow or Crushbone, it's anybody's guess what neat things one can find on the rotting corpses of higher-level Kerrans. Last time I was there, I greased a Pridesman and found a Carnelite (a jewel of some kind) that netted me a smooth 7 gold and change at the merchants. <br><br>ANY OTHER INFO?: Yep. If you're a druid or a ranger, this is the "dungeon" for you because it's almost completely open air. So all your "outdoor only" spells and skills will work over most of the zone. <br><br>There will be at least one spellslinger (me) on hand to bind folks to Erudin so they don't have to make the long trek back from some other continent to retrieve their corpses. Volunteers to help out in this regard will be appreciated. <br><br>OKAY, I'M ALL HIP. WHAT DO I NEED TO DO TO JOIN THIS SHINDIG?: I will be at the Qeynos docks around 6:30pm EDT, and will take the next available boat to Erudin. I will then wait on the Erudin docks until around 7:15, doing bindings. Then I'll head to Kerra Isle. <br><br>If you have any questions, or if you wish to volunteer as a guide or a binder, feel free to email me at <a href=mailto:aburner@rcn.com>aburner@rcn.com</a>. </ul><br><br></font></td></tr>
