<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Author and poet Darter Elfgard is hosting a Spring Fling Festival and Concert on Solusek Ro. The festival will be held this Saturday, April 10th at 12 noon Eastern USA time in Greater Faydark at the marble arches on the trail between the Butcherblock Pass and the Lesser Faydark Pass. Bards, vendors and everyone else is welcome to attend! Bring your lanterns and torches! <BR><BR>All events are winner take all. Death by in game creatures, loss of connection and any other unforseen problems are considered the breaks of the game. <BR><BR>In order to minimize lag, we ask that ye keep converstations and movement to a minimum. Please use /tell and /gsay. Please reserve general chat for performers, officials, and contestants. Vendors use /auction, buyers use /tell. Vendors send yer replies /tell. Again, please use /tell and /gsay as much as possible. <BR><BR>The Spring Fling Schedule has been revised as follows: <BR>***********************************************************<BR>1)11:00: Officials and contestants bound to marble arches by Triton and Trilliana <BR>2)12:00 noon Eastern: Welcome and performance by Darter Elfgard. <BR>3)12:15: Dueling semi-finals <BR>4)Performance by Jythri, famed bard and Soerbaird guildmaster <BR>5)Dueling finals <BR>6)Footrace rally begins <BR>7)Performance by Jythri <BR>8)Drunkard race <BR>9)Performance by Darter Elfgard <BR>10)Winners announced and prizes awarded <BR>***********************************************************<BR><BR>1. Footrace: entry fee - 3gp paid to event official , wear whatever ye want (low level characters might want to be in newbie outfits to avoid loss of equipment due to death by orc) Get through the race by any means available to ye, as long as ye report to all rally points and pick up the unique items from the officials. Contestants will be staggered at 30 second intervals. The contestant with the quickest time and having in possession all the unique items wins. <BR><BR>2. Drinking contest: entry fee - 3gp. Ye will stand at one marble arch, be given a beverage, consume it, and walk to another official at another marble arch, recieve another beverage and repeat as above. Winner will be the person who consumes the most alcohol before passing out. Dropping out of contest for any reason ( including computer disconnects) will disqualify ye. <BR><BR>3. Dueling tournament: Divided into 6 classes as follows:<BR>A. Neophyte class - Level 1 through 3 characters. Entry fee - 1 gp paid to event official. Newbie clothes and rusty or worn weapon of yer choice. Whatever spell ye have at those levels. No magic items.<BR>B. Apprentice class - Level 4 through 6 characters. Entry fee - 2 gp. Tattered and patchwork armor, whatever mages wear at those levels. Tarnished weapons and spells at those levels. No magic items.<BR>C. Journeyman class - Level 7 through 9. Entry fee - 5 gp. Leather armor and whatever weapon ye got, appropriate spells. Magic jewelry permitted.<BR>D. Master class - Level 10 through 12. Entry fee - 1 pp. Whatever ye got.<BR>E. Grand Master class - Level 13 through 16. Entry fee - 2 pp. Whatever ye got.<BR>F. Extreme class - Level 17 and up. Entry fee - 5 pp. Whatever ye got. <BR>Dueling officials will be inspecting yer armor during the battles to insure compliance with the restrictions. Loss of connection disqualifies ye. In case of odd number of contestants or semi - finalists, numbers will be "drawn from the hat" and the lucky number holder will be "odd man out" and automatically advance to the next semi final. No looting. Rule breakers will be disqualified. I will personally match the purse amount for the class A and class B tournaments.<BR>Any other contributions (money, magic items of any kind) will be gratefully accepted and distributed to the contestants at my discretion. Don't worry, I won't keep any of it, heh. Everything will be given to contestants. <BR><BR>Vendors:<BR>Here is a list of possible hot selling items based on my travels and personal observations: <BR>Ruined and medium quality wolf pelts. metal studs fire beetle eyes (they don't call it Fay DARK fer nuthin', heh.) Large tattered belts and shoulder pads taken as loot items from orcs (I think dwarves need these for a certain quest) dwarves, come sell the extra ringmail pants ye got from yer quests, and any special weapons. any and all magical items. any personally made armor, especially small sizes (we be little people on Faydwer) enchanted metals enchanting and binding services perhaps a few hand drums (hard for Freeport bards to find) <BR><BR>Invest at yer own risk! There is no guarantee ye will make a profit! <BR><BR>Darter Elfgard sent the directions to get to the huge upcoming player event called Spring Fling being held on the Solusek Ro server. Here's the directions:<BR> <BR>Catch the boat from East Freeport dock to Kaladim (the 2nd stop of the boat). Do not get off at the first place the boat stops! Go out the gates at the Kaladim port and follow the trail. Keep going past Kaladim (the rock city with the giant dwarf statue). Keep following the trail until you come to a "T". Take the left arm of the "T". Follow the trail to the mountain pass (beware of Zarchoomi, the ogre shaman and Corflunk, the ogre warrior on this stretch). At the pass, zone into Greater Faydark. Follow the path to the giant marble arches. You are there! <BR>P.S. Bring a light source of some kind. <BR><BR>Some addiditonal notes:<BR>Wizards have asked about pets in dueling. Depending on your tournament class, ye can use whatever ye can bring to bear. Pets included. I have had some input that the drinking contest may not work as originally set up. I am working on a way to still hold the contest in some form or another, perhaps drink until your vision is impaired and then race from one arch to the other? Something like that might work and still be fun. I have been asked about looting during the tournament. No looting allowed. If you do, you will be disqualified and your name will be smeared all over the Server. This is intended to be a fun event and I want no undue distress associated with it. </font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>EQVAULT:<BR>Endareth informed me that the most recent patch did some interesting things to EverQuest. Here's the undocumented changes:<BR> <BR>After logging in this morning for a quick game before work, I found what seems to be an undocumented addition to the new patch. After killing a Bixie, it gave me my faction adjustments! Down with the Bixies, and up with the Defenders of the Forest. As I understand, in beta this was included, but was taken out for final release, and I guess it's now back in. Also, /loc seems to have been modified, no more direction. This is fair enough, as it kind of invalidated the Sense Heading skill as it was. <BR><BR>Thanks</font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>A new review of EverQuest can be found on GamePower. This review gives EverQuest three out of four stars. Here's a memorable quote from this article:<BR> <BR>Is EverQuest better than Ultima Online? No. If anything it is just as good and refreshingly different. UO has the advantage of a recognized world. Origin Systems has also had a year to severely tweak gameplay. EverQuest is a clean slate -- there are no godly player killers yet; everyone is fairly new and dedicated to making this a fun experience, so far. It is a testament to the strength of the genre and the EverQuest marketing department that most beta-testers have returned, and there are already a couple of thousand people online at any given time.<BR>If you have the free time, the patience, and a yen to escape into a RPG that is fairly crowded, weak on story, but high on interaction, EverQuest is not a bad place to start your journey. It's also not a bad place to defect to if you find UO has grown stale for you. <BR><BR>You can read the complete review here: http://www.gamepower.com/games/html/8350main.html</font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>John Smedley sent the following in regards to them most recent patch that was implemented this morning: <BR><BR>Hello All,<BR>This morning at 3AM we put a new patch up. Look at the patch message for the exact details of what went in: <BR><BR>Here's some of the highlights: <BR><BR>1) Music is now in on all sound cards. If you still aren't getting music, double check to make sure that music is turned on in-game. In addition, you may not have correct drivers, and/or you may not have it set properly. In any case, either call our tech support or go to the tech support area in chat. Please be advised that music DOES have a performance impact on the game, although it is a small one.<BR><BR>2) Frame Rate Speedup - Our resident graphics genius sped up the game a fair amount. Those of you in areas like Greater Faydark should see some real improvements.<BR><BR>3) Corpse Bug - We've been tracking a nasty little bug that would make corpses dissapear. I'm sure many of you know firsthand about this one. We finally nailed it and it should be safe to die again ;)<BR><BR>There's a whole bunch of other stuff that has been fixed as well and is listed in the patch message. <BR><BR>Just as an FYI we did find a server-side bug that's been fixed and we will probably have to down the servers one at a time to update since this bug is one that really needs to be fixed. <BR><BR>One final Item: YES, GLIDE ON BANSHEE'S IS COMING BACK. IT SHOULD BE IN LATER THIS WEEK. <BR><BR>John Smedley<BR>President and CEO<BR>Verant Interactive, Inc. <BR></font></td></tr>
