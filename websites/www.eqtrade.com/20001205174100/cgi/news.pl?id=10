Due to this change, the prize ratio will change to: <br><br>90% to the winner (matches all three numbers in any order i.e.. 3, 7, 10 is the same as 10, 3, 7)<br>10% to the first prize (matches two numbers in any order i.e.. 7, 10 is the same as 10, 7)<br>(double numbers will and can be used i.e.. my numbers are 7, 7, 7) <br>We will also be posting all names of participants on our website <a href=http://eqlottery.ww4u.net>http://eqlottery.ww4u.net</a> to ensure that all players that participate are represented. (people have been concerned that we would sell 500 tickets and only tell the winner we sold 200) <br><br>We will also be using the /random feature in EQ to get the numbers. After all the numbers have been chosen, we will take a screenshot and post it on our website. We will also be choosing and announcing these numbers in a public forum. <br><br>For all of you wondering, yes, we are taking 20% off the top. We will be using this money to sponsor upcoming events in Kelethin and Felwithe, such as tournaments. We need to have the capitol up front in order to purchase quality prizes. We need these prizes to attract higher level players to the tournaments. We will also be using the money for other community events. </ul><br><br></font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I received the following announcement concerning a planned largescale PvP tournament known only as The Lords of Norrath:<ul>Hi, this is Pat Shearon AKA Jakkard Hawthorne of <a href=http://www.theregulators.org/>The Regulators</a>. You may not know me, but I am the guy that started the Red Annihilation Quake Tournament in 1997 for Intergraph, Id, Mpath Interactive and a host of other sponsors and players. This tournament turned out to be one of the largest online/offline events to ever hit the online gaming world. <br>With that said I just would like you and your organization to be aware that I am producing a series of tournaments for the world of EverQuest, driven by the player community. This tournament will be known as The Lords of Norrath, and will be primarily held on the Rallos Zek server. It will consist of 3 classes of Tournaments, Guild, 1v1 PVP, and 1v1 inner class PVP. This will establish a viable system of inner game rankings for the people that choose to participate. It will also allow for the players that thrive on this style of gaming a viable outlet in the realm of EQ for PVP tournaments that are pre-organized for them. It also establishes a &quot;best of breed&quot; so to speak to be clearly defined on Zek. The tournament cycle will be quarterly if the participation is there (which I know it will be). This will allow a tournament to transpire 4 times a year. <br><br>2 winners and 1 winner for every class will emerge, the best overall 1v1 PVP'er, the best 5v5 Guild, and the best players from each class pitted against each other round robin 1v1. There will be an entry cap for people that wish to participate but the exact number has been undetermined at this time. For information on the event, people can go to <a href=http://www.theregulators.org/events>http://www.theregulators.org/events</a> (this page will be functional no later than may 20th 1999). If all goes well, then I will register a domain for the tournament</ul>. <br><br></font></td></tr>

The reason for this is simple - There will be many sellers, and I doubt anyone wants a continual slew of spamming /auction messages. If you've something you want to auction, give me or any other Republic of Freeport member a /tell. Those specializing in selling a particular type of item should contact me, or any other ROF member in-game and we will perform period zone messages. <br>Sellers: <br><br>Please contact me at the email address shown below.<br>Tell me character name.<br>Tell me what you plan to sell.<br>Tell me if you specialize in any trade or item. <br>Buyers:<br><br>If you're in need of something particular, email me prior to the event. During the event, we'll help you find an item.<br>Tell me your character name.<br>Tell me what you're looking for. <br>All are invited to attend. Those of Evil Races are invited as well, but I feel I should warn you prior.. the guards at the docks don't look too favorably upon some. <br><br>This is a 'test' type of event. We're hoping that many of the merchants of the land will come out to sell their wares. As I've not done this before, please shoot me an email if you see potential problems with this. I know this may seem rather short notice, but don't worry, more similar events are bound to follow. <br><br>The Republic of Freeport is a player run government type guild that is committed to making Freeport the dominant city of Norrath. <br><br></font></td></tr>
