This schedule for the Test Server will only occur for approximately 1 week, after that the Test Server will remain on-line 24 hours a day.<br><br>UUnet will be performing maintenance at 3:00 AM, on July the 13th, which will result in players losing connection to the servers.  Since this maintenance will be taking place, we have moved our regularly scheduled update time from 7:00am to 3:00am for tomorrow only.  UUnet has given us an approximate downtime of 3 hours.

The AOE radius has been increased, as has the range.<br><br>Ice (LVL 49 DRUID) has been changed from an AOE spell to a single target DD spell.<br><br>Rage (SHAMAN) has been upgraded to a LVL 49 spell - Fury remains level 34.<br><br>Invisibility spells (Invisibility, Gather Shadows, Camouflage, etc.) will now blink before they wears off.<br><br>Hitting F1 twice, or /pet target will now target your pet.The Duration on Pack Regeneration (DRUID) has been increased.<br><br>Shield of Lava (MAGICIAN) has had its mana cost reduced.<br><br>The Research entries for Intensify Death and Hungry Earth (NECROMANCER) have been updated.<br><br>New high level Necromancer spells have been added to vendors.<br><br>A new Wizard spell Chill Sight has been added to the Wizard vendors.<br><br>The Magician's Summon Heatstone and Summon Coldstone spells will now work as long as the Stone is held or worn (the spell effect will never wear off).<br><br>The Insight spell (ENCHANTER) now adds Wisdom, not Intelligence.  Brilliance still adds Intelligence.<br><br>The Tashan series (ENCHANTER) has had the recasting time reduced.<br><br>Research for higher level spells has been made a bit easier.<br><br>Spells that Add HP now work better on pets.<br><br>The Necromancer's replacement spell for Charm (Screaming Terror) is on the vendors.  Play with this spell - it is different from any other spell of this type that you have ever seen.<br><br>Shrink (SHAMAN) has been put in to the game.  It is a Level 19 spell, and available in all Shaman starting cities.  This spell will only be castable in dungeons.

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Due to the situation which occurred on the CerfNet servers on Tuesday and Thursday night, we have had to place most of our resources towards rectifying the problem on the live servers. However, we were able to make a few various changes to the Test server, some of which will be propagated to the live servers on Monday. The features and bug fixes are listed below. <br>- Currently, when a character dies, they return with 25% of their Mana and Health, in addition, they have a massive hit to their stats. - This will NOT remain true, and we will be removing it next week. <br><br>- Nagafen's Lair and Permafrost have been revamped with new treasure, items, etc. In addition, changes have been made to NPC spawning to the them. <br><br>- A number of fixes were made to Research. <br><br>The following fixes have been made to spells. <br><br>Vampiric Curse / Bond of Death (formerly Circle of Death) now work with their new effects <br><br>Fufil's Curtailing Chant (BARD) now works on monsters <br><br>Magician pet attack spells have been slightly increased. <br><br>Incapacitate now works for Enchanters (lvl 44 spell) <br><br>Wizard &quot;Casting Times&quot; for damage spells have been slightly reduced <br><br>Necromancer poison spells have had their damage doubled and their duration cut in half. They will do EXACTLY the same amount of damage, but in half the pervious amount of time. <br><br>Necromancer and Shaman disease spells have had their duration reduced. Their damage has been upped to compensate. <br><br>Hungry Earth (Necromancer) is now researchable - check your book <br><br>Research for Thunderclap (Wizard) is now correct - check your book <br><br>Research for Fire Spiral of Al'Kabor (Wizard) is now correct - check your book <br><br>The Magician Burnout series has been made a bit better. <br><br>The reagent for Burnout III has been removed (Magician) Tuyen's Songs (Bard) have had their damage increased. <br><br>New Bard Songs have been added to vendors. <br><br>New Wizard Spell &quot;Bonds of Force&quot; on Wizard vendors. <br><br>Mana Sieve (Enchanter) has been changed. It is now an instant spell (instead of a DOT) and costs less mana (with less effect). <br><br>If all of the changes prove effective, we will be updating the live servers with this data on Tuesday morning of the 29th. <br><br>- The EverQuest Team <br><br></font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2><i>  The EverQuest servers will be coming down tonight at Midnight PDT for a client and server-side update.

The servers will only allow ONE 'Lore' item in a character's inventory (that includes the bank) - please make note of any items you own that are 'Pending Lore' - it is YOUR responsibility to have those items sold or traded by the time (approximately one week) we change them to 'Lore.'  We will not be responsible for items lost when this change is made.<br><br><b>      Zone Enhancements  </b><br><br>- Additional treasure has been added to Permafrost Keep, and some of the items already there have been enhanced - now is the time to plan that Permafrost excursion!<br>- The bandits of West Karana are increasing their presence!  You'll find more bandit camps there, as well as bandits traveling between those camps and elsewhere.<br>- The spawn rates in many outdoor areas has been increased - this should make it easier to find things to kill.<br><br><b>     Bug fixes and newly implemented features   </b><br><br>- Charmed and Feared characters can no longer use skills.<br>- The appropriate text message is given while attempting to attack while charmed.<br>- 'Procing' (items that cast spells) weapons no longer break Bard's singing.<br>- Players vision will now return to normal if killed while drunk.<br>- Tree Form spells will change the caster into a human male in a zone without trees.<br>- Red and Blue armor will now appear the proper color for AMD users.<br>- While accessing the /bug screen, the in-game chat bar will no longer remain active.<br>- If the inventory window is up and the spell book is open, the user will not remove items from their inventory when clicking on the spell book.<br>- A number of quests were fixed as well as implemented.<br>- A Bad language filter has been implemented.  Typing &quot;/filter&quot; will toggle it on and off.<br>- Pets that have been commanded to sit will no longer to appear to stand up while they are supposed to be seated.<br>- While in the full screen view, users may now toggle the translucent overlay backgrounds on and off by pressing the &quot;~&quot; key.<br>- Players may now loot corpses in shallow water or lava by typing &quot;/loot&quot; while the corpse is targeted.<br>- We have implemented an Auto-follow command.  To auto-follow another player, target the character, then type &quot;/follow&quot;.  You must be grouped with the character in order to successfully carry out the command.<br>- A Role Playing switched has been added so that players may identify other characters who wish to make known they are Role Playing.  To activate the Role Playing switch, target your character and type &quot;/roleplay&quot;, if the character is +PvP, the name tag above their head will appear as a darker shade of Red, whereas a non-PvP players name will appear purple.<br>- If the user drops a backpack containing spells on the ground, the spells will no longer disappear.<br>- Medicine Bags, when dropped on the ground, will no longer vanish.<br>- The proper text is given when a trade window is canceled between players.<br>- Arrows will now be drawn from the quiver is the ammo slot is empty.<br><br><b>     Spell Changes   </b><br><br>- The Bard spell &quot;Denon's Desperate Dirge&quot; will now require the use of Mana.<br>- No spell or effect that accelerates the process of mana regeneration will work on a Bard.<br>- '/pet report health' will now have your pet message you with a health report.<br>- Lightning Blast (Druid) has been modified to its intended form of finishing the Invoke Lightning series.<br>- When you fizzle, you will lose a less mana then before.  The fizzle rate has NOT changed.<br>- There is now a CAP on the amount of mana lost from any single fizzle.<br>- Spell Scrolls are no longer lore items.  This means you can hold more than one.<br>- Tuyen's Songs now have range.<br>- Eye of Zomm will no longer work in conjunction with pets - you can now have one or the other.  Sorry.<br>- Wave of Enfeeblement (now Vampiric Curse) and Circle of Death (both Necromancer) will not work for the next week or so while we make a fix on them. <br><br><b>     Trade Skill Changes   </b><br><br>  Jewel Craft - All of the jewelry has had increased magical properties (pre-existing jewelry items remain unchanged).<br>  Fletching - When fletching arrows, they will be produced in sets of 5, instead of 1.<br>  Baking, Blacksmithing, Brewing, and Pottery have been changed to either return items on failure and be able to produce multiple items and quantities on success.<br>  Example:<br>  Baking muffins, success means the player will receive three muffins and retaining the muffin tin, however, when unsuccessful, the player will still get the muffin tin back and lose all other components.  Another example would be if a player wishes to sharpen a rusty short sword.  If the player succeeds, they will receive a tarnished short sword, however, failure will result in retaining the rusty weapon but losing the sharpening stone.<br><br><br><i>- The EverQuest Team   </i></font></td></tr>

I didn't do a scientific analysis, but it seemed that at least half of the people posted, perhaps more, were against the no-item load idea. Perhaps if we'd implemented it in beta it would have worked better... but as I've posted in the recent past, we are often at a point now where changes to solve or address one problem create other problems. This is true both because EverQuest is a very large and complex game, and also because people tend to prefer the status quo, even though often they will complain about it. <br><br>What many of you do seem to want is something we've been slowly implementing, mostly with newer items, as of late. These are the 'lore' items, of which you can only possess one at a time. Our first plan to help with the camping problem is to go through and make a great many of the existing items (for example, the BBC) lore items. These items will soon appear as 'pending lore' items or some such, to indicate to owners that they should trade/sell/destroy all but one of these items in their inventory if they own more than one. Then, a week or so after they appear as 'pending lore', they will become lore items. It is important that you only have one of these items at that time, in that the server will remove any duplicates. We will give plenty of warning in the news file that displays when you enter the game. <br><br>I think this will help, and will be less of a sweeping change than my earlier proposal. It won't solve the 'problem', but I think the situation will improve. If a player, regardless of level, is harvesting an item, he will have to trade or sell the item before obtaining another, which typically means leaving the area, giving others the opportunity to go after it. <br><br>Our minds are pretty made up in terms of going forward with items changing to lore items, but please, let's continue the camping debate -- it can only make the game better. </ul><br><br></font></td></tr>
