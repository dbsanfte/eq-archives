<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The second Cazic-Thule Bazaar was a great success, with fun had by all who attended... At one point there were 230 people in the zone, buying, selling and trading. Many deals were made and much profit garnered =). A lone Griffin was trained into the Bazaar, but the impromptu &quot;Bazaarai Militia&quot; beat it into submission... Thanks to all how came out and made the Original EQ Bazaar a huge success !!! <br><br>Due to the popularity of the Bazaar, I am changing the frequency to bi-weekly... Once a month (on a Saturday on or around the 15th) the Tunnel Bazaar will be held in the tunnel between East Commonlands and North Ro. Also once a month (on a Saturday on or around the 30th) the Traveling Bazaar will be held. The Traveling Bazaar will (obviously =) move from city to city, allowing people of lower levels to attend and diminishing the need for dangerous travel... <br><br>The next Traveling Bazaar will be held outside Kaladim on Saturday the 29th of May, 6:00pm to 9:00pm EST =) <br><br>The next Tunnel Bazaar will be held on Saturday the 19th of June, 6:00pm to 9:00pm EST =) <br><br>For more information, maps, directions and screenshots please visit: <a href=http://www.lokiweb.com/bazaar> <a href=http://www.lokiweb.com/bazaar>http://www.lokiweb.com/bazaar</a> </a></font></td></tr>

This switch would allow role-players to easily find other role-players by changing the character's name color. The switch would be completely voluntary and could be turned on and off at will.

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Okay, maybe not &quot;top secret&quot;, but interesting nonetheless. Here are some tidbits of information that I was able to obtain from Verant's Brad McQuaid and Andy Sites while at E3:<br> <br>1) A massive revision to trade skills and the manners in which they function will be implemented through an important patch to be released approximately 2 months from now. <br><br>2) Rogue poisoning skills will be implemented soon. <br><br>3) There is currently &quot;no chance&quot; of a Brownie, Pixie or Faerie race, due to the logistics of playing such tiny characters. <br><br>4) There is absolutely no confirmation of an EverQuest port for the PlayStation 2 at this time. <br><br>4) Over the course of the next few months, a number of new zones will be created on the existing continents within the current release of EverQuest. For hints as to potential names and approximate locations for these new areas, see our original news posting on this topic from nearly two weeks ago (New Zones?, Tuesday, May 4). <br><br>Once again, thanks to the team at Verant for the above info! <br></font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Here's a rather large list of information concerning the Here's a rather large list of information concerning the expansion set that I was able to obtain from the guys at Verant: <br><br>The new player race, the Iksar, is a completely new variant of the lizardman, complete with clothing graphics (I saw one equipped with a robe--tail sticking through :). These reptilian humanoids are distantly related to the lizardmen of Antonica, although much more advanced. The Iksar also have vastly different appearances--which means that they use a completely new modal and graphical skin. <br>Currently only 1 zone has been created: &quot;The Field of Bone&quot;, a scorched-earth type of land with Iksar ruins, a gigantic walled temple and a large tower, among other &quot;to-be-added&quot; landmarks and features. <br>The Iksar at one time ruled all of Kunark; holding an empire built upon the foundation of slavery of lesser lizardmen. Due to internal conflict and strife, the empire collapsed long ago. Now only vestiges and scattered tribes of Iksar stand testament to their once mighty ruling state. <br>Animated trees (sway in the wind and look great) will be included in the expansion. These new trees actually consist of fewer polygons than the current, non-animated foliage. <br>Immersiveness of environment is a key point in this expansion... Verant hopes to go beyond animated trees and create other interactive and/or non-static scenery and surroundings. <br>4 new monsters have been created so far: The Cockatrice, Leech, Mosquito (giant) and Giant Scorpion (also saw a huge scorp which may serve as the basis for some kind of unique monster, ala Queen Klicnik). <br>All monsters created for the expansion set will be completely unique. This means new models and skins for each. <br>There will be over 20 brand new monsters in the new expansion. <br>The number of zones that will be included within the new continent is currently unverified, although reports indicate somewhere around 15 or 25. However, at this time, not even Verant knows how many they'll be able to squeeze in. Time will tell. <br>The new continent of Kunark will serve as a means to deliver more of the rich background story and plot that underlies Norrath's history and peoples. Brad and the rest of the Verant team look forward to opening up further interaction with EQ's back story and fiction through the expansion set, as well as future updates to the main game. <br>Programmers, who will be handling the core of the new expansion's new features and improvements, will be jumping into the project within a couple of months, after the majority of EverQuest's current needs are taken care of. <br>The current slated release for the expansion set is the First Quarter or 2000. Verant was hoping to release the set at the end of '99, but that (very preliminary) release window has been pushed back in order to allow them more time to concentrate on the current state of EverQuest as well as the large number of features that they wish to include with the expansion. <br>The expansion pack will follow a release strategy similar to that used by Origin with &quot;The Second Age&quot; expansion set for Ultima Online; current players will be offered the expansion for a very nominal fee and future releases of EverQuest will be released at its current price but with the expansion bundled with it. Verant's main goal with this expansion is not to generate revenue (hence the low to free price structure), but to continue to develop the game in new and interesting ways so that we as players will continue to enjoy the world of Norrath. <br>Wellthat I was able to obtain from the guys at Verant: <br><br>1) The new player race, the Iksar, is a completely new variant of the lizardman, complete with clothing graphics (I saw one equipped with a robe--tail sticking through :).

That is, each race has preconceived ideals of how leadership works. Some races don't work well with a government at all. Each race is unique. <br><li>Find others whom are interested in helping out. <br><li>Keep Records of things you are doing to get it all together so you can learn from mistakes, and pinpoint areas of success, and build upon them. <br>Don't form a government with a cookie cutter (Don't copy something pre-existing) <br><li>Choose a name that suits the lifestyle of the residents <br><li>Always seek advice from others as well as criticism.</ul><br>If you make reference to any other government or guild or organization proper netiquette is to include links and contact info where it is appropriate.
