<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>From Kallystra:<br><br>Twas not long ago when my sister Lanys was seen in Neriak. Twas the night a large army of zombies attacked the Nektulos as did a small army of halflings. After slaying those that wished to see us dead, we moved forth into Freeport and fought our way all the way to the Temple of Marr. This was done, I believe, to prove the Teir'Dal's might and to show the humans that we are tired of them thinking themselves better than us and of them trying to kill us. <br>That night, after I read the Litany of Purpose at my sister's request, Lanys asked a question. She asked me to explain the Litany of Purpose. I fear I was taken off-guard, what with all the halflings attacking and I fear my answer was more complex than it needed to me. To explain the Litany of Purpose one just needs to read the First Commandment of Innoruuk for it is Purpose. It reads: <br><br>&quot;All Teir'Dal were created only for the fulfillment of the Will of Innoruuk. We exist only to do so. We do not follow the Will. We ARE the Will. We cannot be separated from the Father, and free-will is not a burden We carry. We are not troubled by questions of right and wrong as are mortals. We simply do the Will of Our Father, and in this We are superior.&quot; <br><br>It also further goes to stat that all High Purposes are enumerated in the Litany of Purpose and explains each &quot;classes&quot; purpose in the Father's Will. <br><br>The time of the Avatar is almost upon us again. I believe she shall return to our homelands either this Wednesday or Thursday approximately near dusk (OOC: 8pm PST). I hope to see many of the Faithful gathered there for I believe my sister's next task will be at hand. <br><br>Thanks! <br></font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Brad McQuaid on alt.games.everquest:<br><br>In text muds you felt like a god after you gained levels. It was great. In EQ, being 50 just means being 50. There isnt any real feeling of accomplishment getting there. With all the nerfs and restrictions it has turned into a really restricted game. It's FUN being able to do the impossible, but that just doesn't happen anymore because verant is too restrictive on how powerfull people should be. I'd rather be plowing through things with moderate difficulty than total impossibility. <br>Verant, toss in some more FUN stuff that makes us all feel a bit better.. The only way people can get this god feeling is by twinking the living hell out of their secondary characters in full rubi, and everything else. People shouldnt have to do that to have fun. :( Make this feeling available to the normal characters.<br><br><font color=red><b>   I'd have to respectfully disagree -- in the better MUDs I played a group of 50s could get spanked in no time if we made an error or got in over our heads. It became more and more difficult as time went on, more and more challenging, and better and better strategies and tactics had to be used -- it wasn't simply a matter of 'I was a level 50 and so I'm a god' and I'm very glad it wasn't that way.
