<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Brad McQuaid had this to say on some issues posed regarding the PvP server: <BR><BR>Everquest is overwhelmingly of course a player-versus-environment game. But there are those of us who see player-versus-player as the only real way to experience a role-playing game. Indeed, I would never play this game without the ability to fully experience a dynamic environment in which the great story of racial and factional conflict you've created couldn't be lived without the challenge of roleplayed PvP. While you've one server dedicated to us now, I believe that in time you will find more and more players either turning on their PK-flags or moving to PvP-dedicated worlds. The reason for this is simple: the challenge and fun of fighting monsters and questing inevitably ends or grows uninteresting, even with so-called "expansion packs." In 6, 8, or 12 months when many players have done and seen "it all"- or enough to see a deadend- they will crave new options, and this usually means PvP and/or advanced crafts. Rallos Zek is not only the best roleplaying shard in my opinion (the messageboards don't correctly show the real situation), but unlikely the switch servers, when lots of players reach rank 40+, Everquest will just be beginning for us; whereas, for those on switch shards, the game will just be ending.<BR><BR>I do have to disagree here -- we are confident we can keep PvE interesting up to level 50 (and even perhaps beyond :) <BR><BR>Presently however PvP has a fair number of bugs and exploits which if you check the PvP and Rallos Zek messageboard are fairly well and completely discussed in various posts. It'd be nice if you'd at least recognize these problems and let us know that in time you intend to fix them. Do you have other plans of enhancing more player-driven structures in the game beyond PvP as well?<BR><BR>Absolutely. The PvP server is very important to us and we are proud that we can support different playing styles within the same game (using different servers as well as the PK switch). <BR><BR>As John and I have mentioned, we are changing it such that if you are killed by an NPC, only you are someone to whom you give consent will be able to loot your corpse. <BR><BR>Invisibility will be a consent spell like Bind Affinity, such that you have to be grouped with someone before they can cast it on you (this will eliminate the need to delete a player's pet). <BR><BR>Also, we will be adding factions for PvP in the future. <BR><BR>Lastly, we are tossing around the idea of another server where different races are either allies or enemies. For example, humans couldn't PK humans, but could trolls, and vice versa. Please let us know what you think about this. <BR><BR>-Brad <BR><BR>Thanks <a href=http://con.xrgn.com/>Crossroads of Norrath</a>!</font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>     EverQuest Producer Brad McQuaid with details concerning the reasoning behind certain aspects of the current NPC quest system: <BR><BR>   Quests are something that are constantly being added to the game. They may or may not be balanced correctly the first time. Also, while one reward will be great for one player, another might think it wasn't worth doing the quest. Another might think the reward was too great. This is just the nature of the beast. Game balance is very important to us, and I think we've done an overall great job at it. But in that quests are constantly being added, I don't expect them to be perfect the first time. This is a price we all pay for having a dynamic evolving game. Not only that, but we will purposely move, modify, or take out quests that may have been 'fine' just to keep the game interesting and changing. <BR><BR>   The bottom line is if you like doing quests, go for it. If your only incentive for doing the quest is to get some great reward, then you probably ought to just hack monsters. Doing quests are supposed to be fun in and of themselves. My quest team has done a great job of integrating the detailed story behind the world of Norrath into these quests -- heck, they've spent well over a year doing this and continue working on them every day. You learn about the world doing quests and people have a great time in the process of doing them. But quests aren't for everyone, nor are they meant to be. <BR><BR>   Looking through some of the quests you listed I certainly found some that seemed to have rewards a bit on the low side. And there will be some on the high side. And they will change and are part of our constant tuning and balancing. <BR><BR>   I do NOT however consider these 'broken' quests that need to be 'fixed'. Broken quests are ones that simply don't work. For example, perhaps you hand the final item to the NPC, he says 'thanks, here's your holy sword of slashing' and then you receive nothing. Fixing those if there are any left would be our priority, btw. <BR><BR>   -Brad <BR><BR>     One more set of comments, this time regarding an EverQuest expansion set:<BR><BR>   What I did say was that the game will continue to expand and evolve, with new features and such being added (which you've already seen via patches -- warrior's beserker comes to mind). <BR><BR>   And that's definitely our plan. You are paying your subscription not just to maintain the servers, but also because you expect a dynamic world. If we want to keep you all as subscribers, we had better keep things interesting, that's for sure. <BR><BR>   But I've also said for a long time that the possibility of large optional add-ons might cost money. That's because this takes a significant team to work on (ie. larger than one maintaining and enhancing a game) and that costs money. <BR><BR>   How much? I can't get into anything like that because we haven't even really officially announced anything about expansions. <BR><BR>   But I assure you that an expansion would be a large and optional add-on to the game and have no impact on the fact that EverQuest itself will continue to grow and evolve. You will definitely get your $10 a month worth, trust me. <BR><BR>   -Brad <BR><BR></font></td></tr>

Some really want to roleplay, but just don't know where to start. One of the best ways to start roleplaying is to create an interesting character. Most of the creative part is up to the individual, but the <a href=http://www.angelfire.com/wi/shouty/rpbio.html>Character Biography Assistant</a> might help. It's a simple program to get you thinking about your character's personality. <BR>This program will probably help the beginning roleplayer the most, by helping to flesh out the character. But even experienced roleplayers could benefit. The Character Biography Assistant allows biographies to be saved (good for remembering the personality of that character you haven't played in a few months), and will even generate a basic web page with the biography on it. <BR><BR>The Character Biography Assistant also makes sure your choice of race, class, and deity are an allowable combination in EverQuest, which also makes this program a nice reference tool. <BR><BR>You can download it from <a href=http://members.xoom.com/shouty/rpbiosetup.zip>here</a><BR></font></td></tr>
