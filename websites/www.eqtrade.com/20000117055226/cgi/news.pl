<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>October 28th, 7:00am<br>--------------------<br><br>*General Enhancements*<br><br>User Adjustable Clipping-plane<br><br>We have recently implemented a user adjustable clipping-plane.  This will allow players with higher-end hardware to move out the distance at which the 3D world geometry is drawn into view, as well as the ability for players with lower-end hardware to pull this distance in, to further improve frame-rate.  To utilize this new feature, you may do so by adjusting the clipping-plane slider bar located in the &quot;Options&quot;-&quot;Display&quot; directory, in-game.  Sliding the bar left will reduce the distance at which the geometry is drawn in to view, whereas sliding the bar to the right will expand this distance.  The following rules apply as to which zones the adjustable clipping-plane may be used in:<br><br>- The clipping-plane can be pushed back in outdoor zones only.<br>- Zones designed with heavy fog (e.g. tox, innothule, etc), the clipping-plane can only be adjusted slightly.<br><br>- If the &quot;Misses&quot; chat filter is set to &quot;off&quot;, Dodge, Parry, and Reposte messages will be filtered accordingly.<br><br>Additional chat filters have been added to filter out any unwanted text.<br><br>*Zone Enhancements*<br><br>Kedge Keep has been enhanced with both new items and creatures.  Please keep in mind, Kedge Keep was tested thoroughly in-house only, therefore, some additional tuning enhancements may need to be made now that it is available on the live servers.<br><br>*Class Enhancements*<br><br>Warrior      - % increase on critical hits<br>Rogue 	     - +8 poison resistance<br>Paladin      - +8 disease resistance<br>Ranger       - +4 Fire +4 Cold resistance<br>ShadowKnight - +4 Poison +4 Disease resistance<br>Monk	     - +8 Fire resistance <br><br>Shadowknights may now use the following spells:<br><br>- LifeTap may now be cast at level 9.<br>- LifeSpike may now be cast at level 15.<br>- LifeDraw may now be cast at level 30.<br><br>The LifeTap, LifeSpike, and LifeDraw spell scrolls may be purchased from any ShadowKnight spell vendor.<br><br>To make room for these new spells, the following spells are no longer available for ShadowKnights:<br><br>- Reclaim Energy<br>- Mend Bones<br>- Voice Graft<br><br>*Spell Enhancements*<br><br>- Level 35+ casters will now automatically meditate while sitting.<br><br>- Invoke Fear (Necromancer, Enchanter, SK, and Cleric) has both had it's casting time and mana cost reduced.<br>- Charm spells now message the message when they break (Enchanter, Bard, Necromancer, Druid)<br>- Magician pets now have new spells.<br>- Ensnare (Druid) has had it's casting time reduced.<br>- High level Necromancer and Magician pets now look different.<br>- Illusions (Enchanter) have had their duration increased.<br>- Tishan and Markar's Clash spells (Wizard) have had their casting times reduced.<br>- Some in-game Bardic instruments have had their stats increased to appropriate levels.  Items effected are the Minotaur horn, Small Brass Trumpet, and the Drum.  Some non-magic instruments have been made magic.  These are the Mistmoore Battle Drums, the Lute of the Gypsy Princess and Kelin's Practice Lute.<br>- Bards with magic gloves and magic instruments may now punch creatures that require magic to damage.<br><br>*New Emote Animations*<br><br>The following emotes now have unique animations:<br><br>/bored		/yawn		/agree		/amaze<br>/boggle		/gasp		/apologize	/plead<br>/grovel		/applaud	/clap		/bleed<br>/hungry		/blush		/cackle		/chuckle<br>/giggle		/snicker	/cough		/burp<br>/cringe		/duck		/curious	/puzzled<br>/stare		/dance		/veto		/disbelief<br>/snarl		/glare		/peer		/whistles<br>/drool		/kneel		/point		/shrug<br>/ponder		/raise		/ready		/salute<br>/shiver		/tap		/thanks		/bow<br><br>*Item Enhancements*<br><br>- A number of existing high-level weapons models have been replaced with new, much more visually appealing versions.<br><br>*Trade Skill Enhancements*<br><br>Enhancements have been made to the Tinkering trade skill to facilitate underwater breathing.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</font></td></tr>

The following is a description of issues and functionality that have changed since beta, or will be changed in the future – this also includes planned new features and/or changes to existing features. <br><br>Please note that the following information takes precedence over information that may be included in the EverQuest manual, strategy guide, and other official documents previously released.<br><br>Please also note that changes or additions are targeted to be implemented short term unless otherwise indicated, however there is no commitment to a specific date. <br><br><b>Future Development<br><br>Zones</b><br><br>Two new areas, tentatively titled, The Hole and Paineel, will be accessable via the Toxxullia Forest on Erudin. The zones will be free of charge and available via an optional patch. More information regarding these new zones will be made available as their release date nears. <br><br><b>General Issues</b><br><br>Though a majority of the EverQuest development team's time has been dedicated to the enhancement of current game play related features, such as dungeon and class tuning and balancing, item/weapon implementation, and spell functionality, we have been able to work on the following.<br><br>- Level 35+ characters meditating automatically when they sit down - without the spell book being brought up.<br><br>- The ability for the user to manually adjust their clipping plane (the point at which the 3D geometry is drawn in) on the fly via an in-game slider bar to not only enhance performance, but to also allow the clipping plane to be moved out much further than it is currently set to.<br><br>- Approximately 20+ new character animations to be mated with the /text socials which were recently added last week.<br><br>- Allowing the ability for guilds to be at war with multiple guilds.<br><br>- Functionality is being added to allow Enchanters to enchant items.<br><br>- The ability to send messages to everyone in a players Friend's List whom are currently on-line.<br><br>- Adding the option for players to not allow looting before a guild war is initiated. <br><br><b>Spells</b><br><br>Please note that Beta was used for testing spells.

<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>EverQuest, despite being released nearly eight months ago, continues to break sales records. 989 Studios issued the following Press Release announcing EverQuest's latest accomplishment:<br> <br>EverQuest Breaks All Online PC Game Industry Sales and Subscriber Records<br>FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(ENTERTAINMENT WIRE)--Oct. 18, 1999--989 Studios(TM), a Sony Computer Entertainment Group Company, announced today that its top-selling online PC title EverQuest(TM) has broken all subscription-based online gaming sales records. <br><br>In only six months, EverQuest has sold more games than any other online role-playing game ever released, with 225,000 units sold and an active subscriber base of more than 150,000 players. <br><br>EverQuest has changed the traditional lifecycle and sales curve of entertainment software,'' said Kelly Flock, president, 989 Studios. What is most impressive is the fact that EverQuest's sales and subscriptions numbers are continuing to grow by the thousands week after week. Frankly, EverQuest is performing more like a blockbuster movie than the usual online computer game.'' <br><br>The allure of EverQuest, which released in February 1999 -- and was developed by 989 Studios' PC division, the predecessor of Verant Interactive -- involves the game's multitude of expansive adventures and detailed quests that provide a unique interactive storyline that evolves according to a player's decision. Players can choose to begin the game in any of three continents, with more than 70 adventure zones and 12 cities. Each of these continents has diverse species, economic systems, alliances and politics. <br><br>EverQuest is way ahead of its time, both technologically and conceptually,'' added Flock. Its continual popularity can be attributed to its uniqueness and addictive gameplay, which differs from any other form of personal entertainment, be it books, movies or even videogames. Simply, by transporting the gameplayer into another world, with tens of thousands of people playing online simultaneously, EverQuest offers gamers an unparalleled immersive social experience.'' <br><br>During peak periods, EverQuest adventurers and dragon slayers can form alliances with up to 37,000 other players simultaneously. The active global EverQuest subscriber base is comprised of players from various countries throughout the real'' world, including the U.S., England, Canada, Singapore, Zimbabwe, Saudi Arabia, France and New Zealand. <br><br></font></td></tr>

When was the last time you actually stumbled upon a guide holding an answer circle? They are busy with petitions dealing with everything from corpse recoveries to &quot;Do I lose exp in a duel?&quot;.<br><br>If you are an experienced player on the Povar server and wish to be an EQ Mentor, please contact me at <a href=mailto:crysta@arina.net>crysta@arina.net</a>. <br><br>The Duties of a Mentor:<br><br>--Must dedicate at least 4 hours of playing time per week to the Program (this can be done by spending time with your assigned newbie, or by holding answer/helping sessions).<br>--Has to hold at least 1 answer/helping session in a newbie area per week.<br>--Mentors are assigned newbies of the same class (or class you are experienced in) so you can provide helpful advice on everything from equipment to skill building. NOTE: This does NOT mean you are twinking this newbie or have to give him/her any items or money. It is your choice to spend time with him/her in person, provide advice in tells, etc. However you want to help him/her is fine.<br>--You must log the time you spend mentoring. The more time you mentor, the more praise you get ;)<br>--An optional thing is to submit a summary of what you did at the end of each week. Include suggestions, things people asked/requested, etc. Reports can be submitted to <a href=mailto:crysta@arina.net> <a href=mailto:crysta@arina.net>crysta@arina.net</a> </a>and will be posted on the Reports page once that goes up.<br><br>A Few Goals:<br>What I am hoping for if the Mentor Program turns out how I intend, we will be working closely with the Guide Program; taking the questions players ask in petitions that any experienced player could answer and answering them. <br><br>Instead of a guide telling a player &quot;I'm sorry, I can't help you.&quot; because a player died in an area where he cannot retrieve his corpse himself, the guide could respond with &quot;Because you have not died to a bug or technical error, I cannot help you. However, if you contact someone from the Mentor Program, they may be able to assist you.&quot; <br><br>I also wish for the Mentor Program to expand past Povar and branch onto the other servers. If you are not on Povar and wish to manage the Mentor Program branch on your server, please contact me.<br><br>Other Things:<br>As the program expands, I will be adding much more onto this website. I hope to get a form up (possibly today) that will allow you to sign up for the program -to become a mentor- through this website.<br><br>I will put up an FAQ about the program because I know there are a lot of questions people will ask (like &quot;The newbies that you assign to people, where are you getting them from?&quot; etc.) and they are questions that get repeated constantly.<br><br>I feel this program is going to give the bored higher-level people something to do. I know as a level 46 cleric that I'm in no rush to 50 because I see how bored a lot of people are. I, personally, find it fun to sit in greater faydark for a few hours and buff newbies, heal, bind -- most of all ANSWERING the 100 tells I get asking very simple questions.<br><br>-------------------<br>Arina Online<br><a href=http://www.arina.net>http://www.arina.net</a><br><a href=mailto:info@arina.net>info@arina.net</a><br><br>Thanks! </font></td></tr>

Not only the children of Mithaniel Marr are invited, and indeed, followers of all the true gods, be it Karana, Rodcet Nife, Brell, Tunare, Erollisi Marr, Quellious or Prexus are most welcome to attend, for perhaps we shall be blessed by holy signs from these gods as well. You need not be a strong adventurer to attend - the weakest of the children of the light will be as welcome as the most valiant warriors. <br><br>The forces of Innoruuk probably have learned of this event by now, especially considering their recent attack on the Sisterhood. We welcome them as well. Those of them who shall be present, even if their intentions are malignous, will be cleansed in the glory of the Light of Marr and of the true gods, and their souls shall never again doubt that theirs is a fallen god. It is in that spirit that we invite you all to welcome these misguided pawns should they be present, and simply let them witness the might of Truth. <br><br>The head of the sisters of Erollisi, Styria Fearnon, has made sure that preparations were complete before the arrival of the crowd, and the sisters will be glad to have you there. <br><br>Once again, here are the complete coordinates to the event. <br><br>Day of Light celebration<br>Sisterhood of Erollisi, Ocean of Tears<br>Saturday, October 16th<br>7 pm PST <br><br>You may find more information at The Temple of Marr <br>(<a href=http://www2.iro.umontreal.ca/~dodetorp/Marr> <a href=http://www2.iro.umontreal.ca>http://www2.iro.umontreal.ca</a>/~dodetorp/Marr </a>) <br><br>For the eternal glory of Mithaniel Marr and the true gods, <br><br>Kathia du Lac, Knight of Truth, Child of the New Sun and Sword of Mithaniel Marr <br><br>Thanks Kathia! <br></font></td></tr>
