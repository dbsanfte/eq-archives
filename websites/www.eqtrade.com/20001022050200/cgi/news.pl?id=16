<tr><td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=2><BR>Krozy sent me the following annnouncement concerning The Republic of Freeport's First City Meeting, on Xegony: <ul><BR>The Republic of Freeport is a player run form of government for the city of Freeport on the Xegony server. Some of its intents are... <BR><li>Defend the City from hostiles</li><ul><BR><li>Invasions from Evil races who will undoubtedly be soon coming to our popular city to wreak havoc killing the guards, merchants, etc. - Our own player guards will be needed to engage in direct duels with said forces (This duty suggested for guards of levels 6 and up) </li><BR><li>Normal local critters preying on residents coming and going through the main gates of Freeport need to be handled (This duty suggested for guards of levels 1-5) </li><BR><li>Patrolling the underground of Freeport (sewers, tunnels, etc), of which those of Evil races may attempt to use to gain access to our docks and beyond. (This duty suggested for guards 10 and up). Only partial maps of this area are available and need to be completed. </li></ul><BR><li>Organization/Running of Local Events</li><ul><BR><li>Our great city of Freeport is equipped with a fabulous Arena which should be utilized for Championship dueling (ala the famous "Fight Night" of Oasis/UO). This will have to be tested prior, as nearby NPCs may or may not attack the contestants - if so, then some GM intervention would be necessary on such occasions. The Arena would also be ideal for anything of a large audience, such as speeches, plays, etc. </li><BR><li>Not only does the city have an arena, we're also well equipped with a small Theatre for putting on small shows. It could be used for concerts, small speeches, demonstrations of various skills to newcomers to the city. - Its easy to find, and like the Arena, is in the same zone as those creating new characters in Freeport (West Freeport). </li><BR><li>The city of Freeport has a City Hall which will be used for Public Meetings (such as described below). For times when there are no events at the Arena or Theatre, there are plenty of Taverns throughout Freeport that will be hosting drinking contests and celebrations. </li></ul><BR><li>Diplomacy Issues </li><ul><BR><li>As the city of Freeport is at the center of most everything in Norrath, it gains alot of attention from those of other areas. Diplomats for the city will handle matters with other city governments and guilds throughout the land. This may include but isn't limited to declaration of war / peacetime and the arrangement of trade deals. </li><BR><li>Diplomats traveling to other cities should be escorted by members of the guard for protection. </li></ul><BR><li>Standardized Trade Policies</li><ul> <BR><li>Often, newcomers to the area, or new players for that matter, end up paying higher prices then they need to for specific items and services. One of the intents of the Trade division of the Republic of Freeport is to setup a standard pricing scheme, one which would be publicly viewable, and is competitive to NPC pricing. </li><BR><li>As trade deals would be arranged with other cities and guilds, a merchant of the Republic of Freeport would travel with the diplomat for said purposes. <BR>Miscellaneous </li><BR><li>If in time the city of Freeport develops a sizeable treasury, assistance to newcomers could be granted to help them get started <BR>Advisors are always a good thing to have for people to voice their issues to and have it carried to the leader. </li></ul><BR>At this time, I've been talking with a few dozen people in the Freeport area of Xegony over the past weekend and earlier in the week. I just can't get to people fast enough! There are simply so many of you out there! I'm finding that a good deal of people are quite interested in this type of organization and now I ask for your help. This organization (guild) is not officially formed yet through Sony/Verant. Thus, I need the following: <ul><BR><li>People who will commit to be charter members. - This is perfect for those who have been involved in City Governments in real life, as well as those who have been involved with events and activities for cities, towns, etc. of other online games. - If you want to do this, you can email me directly at krozy@mindspring.com. </li><BR><li>Non-charter members. - If you want to wait until this organization is officially formed before joining, thats still OK. But take some time to let me know by emailing me at the address above so I can get a rough count of interest. </li><BR><li>Leaders - If you've a background in leadership, or simply have the desire to lead others and live in the Freeport area, email me, and also let me know what your strengths are. </li><BR><li>Ideas, Suggestions, Comments, Advice, etc. - If you've an idea that would be great that I haven't covered above, send your comments to me at the email address given above. If you don't think this can work, let me know why ; ) <BR>Over the course of the rest of this week and next I'll be talking with more residents of Freeport on Xegony. </li></ul><BR>I'd like to announce the first City Meeting to take place on April 24, 1999 @ 10:00 PM Eastern Time (7:00 PM Pacific Time). This meeting will be held at the City Hall located in North Freeport  <BR><BR>I hope to see many members of the community attend for discussion of planning events, guarding of the town, assistance and more. <BR><BR></font></td></tr>
