<br>
So I start to wonder who this person is and why they are lurking on our message board.<br>
<br>
I find a post by him on 9/21/02 saying he was happy to have joined EV. But I have never seen this person is guildchat, so, naturally, I become curious.<br>
<br>
I look at his profile, and apparently, he was happy to have joined Maison Noble on 9/16/02. Hmmm, 5 days and he left MN and joined EV? Couldn't have been too happy.<br>
<br>
I also see he came here on 9/9/02 asking for help with his Chardock raid to get the Singed Note for his epic. Anyone sensing a pattern here?<br>
<br>
So, I asked in guildchat about him, and apparently he was in EV for about 2 days and irritated people so much, they asked him to leave. They said he joined during the 2 weeks I was taking a break from EQ, and within those 2 days all he talked about was getting this loot or that loot and basically wanted everything and just came across as a greedy S.O.B.<br>
<br>
So, I went looking at his EZBoard profile again, I see he posts here. And it would appear Amazon recently took down Ragefire for this guy. Is he now a member of Amazon? Or did he join Amazon just to get his clicker and now is on to a new guild? <br>
<br>
Basically, I just wanna know what kind of person this guy is. I like Amazon and I think I can consider most/all of you friends, and I don't wanna see you get screwed over by a guild-hopping loot-monger (IF that's what this person is). If he joined Amazon and intends to stick with them, that's great, I hope it works out. Otherwise, maybe you guys should know what kind of person you got on your hands. <p><center>

He didn't come across as a greedy lootmonger, but both times he was there for an epic event for another person in our guild so it was already pretty much determined who got what.  Our helping him with Rage was mainly just an extension of the help he has given us.  <br>
<br>
The only negative thing I can say about him is that he fell asleep at the keyboard while we were doing Neh'Ashiir in CoM for Isaboe's Epic once.  Apparently he'd been going all night and got talked into coming over by one of our groupmembers even though he needed to go to sleep.  It's all good though, I dropped him in the middle of nowhere in Toxx forest and I called it even. <p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="550" height="230" align="center"><td><img src="http://members.cox.net/amazonguild/sigs/nuvarre.jpg">

We took a group up to smack a few mobs up top for another few epic pieces and Faker was with our group. I cant say he did anything wrong and since the only loot was epic pieces that wasnt an issue, however if I recall he was a little slow at times as if he wasnt paying full attention to the game perhaps? (We moved, he was left behind) However despite my &quot;fun&quot; pulls, nobody died in that small party so I cant complain about his overall cleric duties. Either way, I was one of the Amazon'ers who helped kill Rage for him... (Mostly went for the fun of it since dragon raids = lots of fun!) <p>Brother Lizzik : 60 Monk : Grandmaster with Turbo Fists!

<br>
First of all i was in EV for about 2 weeks, and after vindi Razatial felt it wasnt working out so he asked me to leave.<br>
<br>
I was booted from MN for a silly reason because there was a event i couldnt see on the calendar and then i said there was no event that night so i asked for help in chardok and Drcorcle kicked me.<br>
<br>
Dikmer, amazon are my friends and i hope nothing will change that, but no im not part of amazon at the moment, but I am back in a guild(Defenders of kah-Li) that i was in before MN or EV. Amazon is mostly people who used to be in Defenders of kah-Li and theyre good friend because DoK is a small guild that can only do a few things by themselves. Now im not saying we cant do anything but most of the time only a few people are on at a time.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry if anyone got confused by this.<br>

Yes, I have *heard* things, including what he himself stated about being kicked from guilds. <br>
<br>
I have no complaints about my own experience with him though.<br>
<br>
About Defender's of Kah-Li...<br>
<br>
DoK is the second oldest guild on the Xegony server (Fellowship of the Griffon being the first). I believe it is one of the top ten oldest guilds in Everquest! We submitted a guild application the second or third day the game was out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I don't think Amazon is *mostly* DoK but there are quite a few former DoK. Off the top of my head...<br>
 <br>
Chucho<br>
Natina<br>
Allie<br>
Oliuyen<br>
Kitaros<br>
Aetherial<br>
Gulaab<br>
Ladic<br>
Osmandius<br>
Blub/Zephan<br>
<br>
Machin Shin has a number of former DoK... it is a breeding ground apparently for people to move on to bigger and better things. If all former DoK were still there it would be a smallish but quite powerful guild now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
