The Grand Historian next to him will tell you what to say to him if you hail him. Borannin will ask you to bring back to him four frost giant toes. Frost giant toes seem to drop randomly of all frost giants. Giving him the toes results in faction changes (+Coldain, +DainFrostreaverIV, -Kromzek, -Kromrif) and a Burlap Coldain Prayer Shawl. He says to bring the shawl back to him in one months time and he will have more for you to do, so this is probably the start of a quest series.<br>

This is the second Prayer Shawl Quest. You must first do the Frost Giant Toes Quest. <br>
<br>
If you then ask What Tasks? the following conversation ensues: <br>
<br>
You say, 'What task' <br>
<br>
Loremaster Borannin says 'Every year the Dain replaces the trophies in his trophy room. There is a reward given for the best new trophy obtained. I intend to win this year and I will upgrade your prayer shawl for assisting me. Fill this box with ten Kromrif heads and bring me the combined contents along with the burlap shawl. I will submit the best one for the Dains consideration. <br>
<br>
He then gives you a Preservationists Box. Fill the box with 10 Kromrif Heads and hit combine to make a box of Preserved Kromrif Heads. Then give Borannin Preserved Kromrif Heads box along with Burlap Coldain Prayer Shawl. <br>
<br>
Loremaster Borannin says 'Ahh, some fine specimens indeed, Devastation. I will have the best of these mounted at once, wish me luck in the contest! Before I forget, here is the Cloth Prayer Shawl of our people. Before long I will have yet another [chore] for you to complete. Be sure to keep checking. <br>
<br>

Beginning Note: You will need a baking skill of around 135 to finish this quest. I will attach another post with examples of what to make to raise your skill to the needed lvl if you are not a baker.<br>
<br>
Ask Borannin &quot;What chore?&quot; and he will start you on the third quest. <br>
<br>
Loremaster Borannin says 'Ahh, some fine specimens indeed, Dyllwin . I will have the best of these mounted at once, wish me luck in the contest! Here is the Cloth Prayer Shawl of our people. Before I forget, the council has issued yet another [chore] for you to complete. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What chore?' <br>
<br>
Loremaster Borannin says 'The council agrees that you have demonstrated a disdain for our enemy, the Kromrif, that rivals our own. They now ask that you demonstrate your loyalty to the Dain by humbling yourself and serving our people. Give this, my seal, to Mordrin. He will instruct you further. <br>
<br>
Borannin tells you to go to Mordrin, but that is a typo, he really means Mordin, the guy in the butcher shop. <br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Mordin Frostcleaver' <br>
<br>
Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Ah, hello there, and welcome to me shop, Halfling. Ye'll have to excuse the mess but I've been havin a bloody good time here lately. . . HAR HAR, ye get it? Anyways, thanks to you offlanders I now have a selection of some exotic meats never afore seen here on Velious. In addition to supplyin' the freshest meat in Thurgadin I also offer tasks to would-be hunters in the wastes. <br>
<br>
I gave Mordin Borannin's seal and he said the following. <br>
<br>
Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Hullo Dyllwin , I see you've signed on for a bit of food service eh? Well we can always use an extra pair a hands here dat's fer sure. First things first, warsh yer grubby mitts an cook up dinner fer good ol Leif. Shouldn be too tough fer ye, he has simple enough taste. Make him a Tundrabear sandwich an lemme know when he's been fed. Dontcha ferget ta give him this with his meal. <br>
<br>
Your faction standing with Coldain got better <br>
Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better <br>
Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse <br>
Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse <br>
You gain experience!! <br>
<br>
He gives you a napkin named &quot;Leif's Napkin&quot; is No Drop. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What is a Tundrabear Sandwich?' <br>
<br>
Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Dat's easy, ye just take a slab a dat Tundra Kodiak meat and a jug a sauce, put it in da oven, den combine the product with a loaf a bread in a mixin bowl an there ye be. <br>
<br>
Get a Tundra Kodiak meat, put it in oven with sauce and make &quot;Saucy Kodiak Meat&quot; (name?). Put your creation in a mixing bowl with one loaf of bread, which Mordin sells, and combine. If your skill is high enough you get the sandwich. Turn this in to Guard Leif with the napkin and get a &quot;Used Napkin&quot; back. It is also No Drop. <br>
<br>
Give the used napkin to Mordin and get the next part of the quest. He needs you to make some Snow Bunny Stew for Trita Coldheart (name?). You get &quot;Trita's Napkin&quot; (No Drop). <br>
<br>
You say, 'What is Snow Bunny Stew' <br>
<br>
Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Simple enuff, getcherself two hunksa Bunny meat and a jug a sauces. Stir 'em in a mixin bowl, then put spices and two flasks a water with it and cook it in a pot. Mmmm, zesty! <br>
<br>
The tough part here is finding a mixing bowl. I searched several cities including Thurgadin for a mixing bowl or even a mixing bowl sketch or mold. I finally found one in a shop in North Freeport near the bank. I don't recall the shop name though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    (Mixing bowls can be pottered, purchased in Neriak, at Canloe's Bakery in W Freeport. I believe there is also a shop in Thurg which sells them)<br>
<br>
Once you mix the ingredients in the bowl and get your &quot;Saucy Rabbit&quot;(name?) you put that, one spice, 2 flasks of water and a pot into the oven to make the stew. The pot can be made with the smithing skill, and maybe even pottery, although I hadn't worked on that at this point. <br>
<br>
I gave the stew to Trita with the Napkin and received a dirty pot in return. I gave that back to Mordin and was given the next part of the quest. <br>
<br>
Next you need to createan Ulthork Meat Pie for Brita. You receive Brita's napkin, No Drop. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What is Ulthork Meat Pie?' <br>
<br>
Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Hmm, lemme look that one up. Been awhile since I made one. Here we are, two Ulthork meats, a vinegar and a spices in a mixin bowl. Put yer meat mix, a clump a dough, an a pie tin in da oven an yer good ta go. <br>
<br>
This requires 2 Ulthork meat, and the problem here is that if you're not careful you will eat the meat. Most of the items you need to collect or make are edible. I know the kodiak meat and bunny meat do not get eaten, but everything else seems to disappear if not below your food in your inventory. I could not find any snake eggs in Thurgadin for the clump of dough, so I ported to Misty Thicket to get them. The pie tin is another stumbling block here unless you are good at smithing and pottery, or you have a friend who is. To smith the Pie Tin you first need to make a ceramic lining, so your pottery has to be trained somewhat. I had relatively good success with a 25 pottery, whereas my smithing is in the low 100's and I don't think the pie tin is trivial to me yet. Luckily the pie tin, and the pot in the previous step, are regular items that anyone can craft and give to you if you lack the proper skills. <br>
<br>
Turn the pie and the napkin in to Loremaster Brita in the back of the Library and receive a dirty pie tin which you take back to Mordin for the final step in this quest. <br>
<br>
The final task is to create a Snow Griffin Souffle. The person you are making this for is none other than the Grand Historian Thoridain himself, so it has to be made well. I have worked my baking up to 115, and I don't remember the souffle being trivial to me. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What is Snow Griffin Souffle?' <br>
<br>
Mordin Frostcleaver says 'This one's a bit tricky, ya toss four snow griffin eggs and a pack of spices in de oven. Ye must bake it just right or it's all gunna be wasted. When yer done bring it to Thoridain and if ye did it right he'll give ye his special seal. Just show Borannin that seal and yer shawl and he'll know that yer finished in the kitchen. <br>
<br>
So now you need 4 Griffin eggs. I had never seen any drop up to this point, but I haven't killed alot of Griffs either. I set out and with a little help was able to get 4 eggs to drop in about 3 hours. It would have gone faster, but I had trouble finding the Griffins. All in all I'd say we got the 4 eggs in about 12 - 15 Griffins, maybe even less. <br>
<br>
Once you've made the souffle turn it in to Grand Historian Thoridain with the napkin. Here I learned something useful. I forgot to turn in the napkin when I turned in the souffle. In my excitement in creating the souffle I had completely forgotten. I was about to petition that he had eaten my item when I realized the forgotten napkin, so I gave him the napkin and to my suprise it worked. <br>
<br>
Grand Historian Thoridain says 'My compliments, Dyllwin , what a wonderful dish! Please accept my personal Seal as a token of my appreciation. May it give you power over your adversaries. <br>
<br>
He gives you his Seal to give to Borannin with your second Prayer Shawl. Now here is the toughest part of the quest. I looked at the Seal thinking it would be some no stat item, to my suprise I found it is an incredibly nice item, I think better than the Frozen Orb everyone is farming in the Eastern Wastes. Stats are AC 3, Wis +3, Int +3, SvCold +3, Sv Magic +3 and Mana +30. I hesitated for a moment, but finally turned it and my Prayer Shawl in to Borannin thinking I could do the quest again to that point to get the Seal. <br>
<br>
Loremaster Borannin says 'Well done Dyllwin, the council will be impressed with your effort. Here is the woven prayer shawl, wear it with pride. I know there is talk of great plans for you, be sure to come back and ask me what the council has [brewing]. <br>
<br>
You get three of the following faction hits during this third installment of the quest:<br>
Your faction standing with Coldain got better <br>
Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better <br>
Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse <br>
Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse <br>
<br>
This is the best part of the quest. I looked at my inventory to check out the stats on the shawl. It is as expected, one better on each stat over the second one, just like the ring quests. What shocked me, however, is that along with the third shawl I also received back from Borannin the Seal of Thoridain. So with this third quest we get two items. The shawl, which has not quite reached the level that I would switch it out for what I have on, and the Seal which is an incredible nice item. <br>
<br>
He alludes to the fourth quest in this series, but when questioned about it says there will soon be much to do. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What is brewing?' <br>
<br>
Loremaster Borannin says 'As of now they have nothing for me to tell you. Bear with me Dyllwin , there will soon be much to do! <br>
<br>
For those who want it sumed up, here is a shopping list of items you will need to do the whole quest. This assumes no failures, so plan accordingly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>

<br>
&quot;I also started this quest at 0 baking skill. The way I proceeded was Bear Sandwiches = 31. Beer Braised Bear = 68. Then Shark Fillet = 82. I bound in Thurgadin, and filled 3 backpacks up with Shark meat, and took a trip to East commons. In East Commons I sat in-front of the merchant who sells batwings and made Shark rolls = 135. 0 skill to 82 is easy. Because Mordin sells all the meat you need. And the Trade Skill guy in the bank sells spices, and sause.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bear Sandwiches<br>
ingredients: Bear meat, bread<br>
implements: spit, oven<br>
trivial: 31<br>
<br>
Beer Braised Bear<br>
ingredients: bear meat, short beer, spices<br>
implements: spit, oven<br>
trivial: 68<br>
<br>
Shark Fillet<br>
ingredients: Shark meat, spices, jug of sauce<br>
implements: spit, oven<br>
trivial: 82<br>
<br>
Shark Rolls<br>
ingredients: shark meat, batwings<br>
implements: spit, oven<br>
trivial: 135<br>
<br>
&quot;I had a skill of 0 to begin with but built it up to 95 without leaving Thurgadin. To do this, make bear sandwiches until 31, shark fillets to 82, then smoked shark to 95. All the ingredients are in town, and relatively cheap.&quot;<br>
<br>
Smoked Shark<br>
