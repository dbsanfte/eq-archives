I think it is a post that every member of TW should read and absorb.  I know this thing is really long, but take the 5 minutes out of your life to read this and really think about it.  It has alot to say, especially with the changes we are on the verge of making within Twilight.<br><br>Yes, this is a homework assignment and there will be a quiz. &lt;g&gt;  Seriously though.  This is something I feel you should all read.  Xammer took the time to write it, I took the time to format it here.  Please read it.<br><br><br><br><br>Today in class we had a lecture on something that really stuck a cord on how simple and obvious it was. The lecture was on Stereotypes. Specifically the theories on them, how we reinforce them, and how to change them.<br><br>Well during the course of it, and afterwards it got me thinking about how stereotypes really relate to EQ, and specifically a discussion I had with someone yesterday in EQ. Also about some of the things I, friends, and not friends have done in EQ.<br><br>Specifically the &quot;Social Identity Theory&quot;. This one plays on the fact that every human being wants high self-esteem, and so we extend our &quot;self&quot; to include the group we belong too. Where you view your group as better, and so all others are inferior. This explains things like school rivalries, racism, etc... and Guild rivalries.<br><br>Then she started talkin about how we hold stereotypes in place. We all have'em, they are just a part of us, and if you say you don't have'em, you are lying. Even if you don't believe a stereotype, you are influenced just by knowing about it. But the coolest thing that keeps them going is called &quot;Self-Fulfilling Prophecy&quot;.<br><br>Self-fulfilling prophecy says that because of our stereotypes we will expect certain people to act in a certain way. So we will adjust our behavior to what we expect that behavior to be, and the person we are interacting from that stereotyped group will respond in the expected behavior as a result. i.e. You expect someone to be an @#%$, so you are an @#%$ to them, and you being an @#%$ to them causes them to be an @#%$.<br><br>So as I was sayin, this got me thinkin about EQ and some of the things I've done and seen done of late, and specifically at the trak raid I was at yesterday. (note: This time I did not loose the dragon)<br><br>During it, we had a rough start, and the mother of all trains caused us to have to regroup and head down again. While we were doing this, another guild started to show up. We had all our folks in zone, had 3 groups already goin down and the rest were being taken care of. So we had 30+ folks on site.<br>This other guild has a reputation for running people over and being less than kind. Further we've had run ins with them before that were considerably less than cordial. During it, I and some others tried to diffuse the situation and let the other guild know we were there in force and moving on the target. After a half hour of no responses, someone finally gets back to me saying they've been in tell hell, but nothin more. Then a bit later, the leader of said guild gets in contact with me.<br><br>Now, I perceived their attitude in tells to be fairly haughty, but was my perception biased by my stereotypes? Or was it actually haughty? The guild &amp; alliance I belong too was of course by this time quite displeased with the other guilds refusal to leave, despite them knowing we were there and ready for trak, and the 2nd guild having just 18 folks in zone.<br><br>Anyways we continue on, get our people back in shape, and spot one of the members of the 2nd guild tagging along with us. That sets off another round of bitching and griping about that person being there. I ask them to leave, saying that if anything wrong happens, then innocent or not, that person and their guild will get blaimed for it. Said tag along responded with &quot;We'd get blamed for it if I were here or not.&quot;<br><br>I tried to come up with a rejoinder but couldn't. He was right.<br><br>So a few minutes later Frax tells me that we've been given 90 minutes to do it, or the other guild is going to steamroll us. As we've been in this situation before with this same guild, I'm hardly surprised. Hell it even has the effect I'd hoped for of getting everyone focused &amp; motivated, and we go on and smack trak better than we ever have before.<br><br>Afterwards a member of that 2nd guild sends me a tell congratulating us on a mission accomplished. This person is a buddy, but I'm curious. Why is he congratulating me, when just a few minutes before he was willing to steamroll me if we failed. So I ask him why.<br><br>He comes back with something to the effect of y'all haven't been nice to us, why should we be nice to you. That got me thinkin more, and the more I thought, the more of a case of the chicken and the egg this became to me. Does our behavior towards them cause them to act this way, or does their behavior towards us cause our response.<br><br>Interesting Paradox there, then with the stuff in this lecture today it started clicking. Its all one big self-fulfilling prophecy of stereotypes on both sides. The 2nd guild shows up, and after being informed we are there and moving on the objective doesn't leave.  But why don't they leave? Is it because of the response they got, or because of the response they expected to get? Where our words hasty &amp; hottempered because they didn't leave immediately, or because we expected them to stay and steam roll us?<br><br>I'm biased in the matter admittedly, but I admit that my cohorts and I can at times be, shall we say, not as polite as we could be. But then so can this other group of folks.<br><br>This is all smacks so much of a self fulfilling prophecy to maintain a stereotype about the actions of another that it really is funny.<br><br>This all then got me thinking about other guild &amp; personal interactions I've witnessed in EQ. How people expect others to be jackasses, and so will go into a debate expecting that behavior. How there are very rarely times when 2 groups in EQ will actually bother to try and talk civilly and work things out. We'll open up discussions by being smarmy &amp; rude, and that sets the tone for the entire thing. Once we get our dander up, few are willing to back down.<br><br>And so we get into situations of &quot;might makes right&quot;, aka &quot;He who gets there with the mostest firstest, winsest.&quot; We get into situations of &quot;tick tock&quot;, and people steam rolling other people.<br><br>Now is this a big preachy letter to get everyone to try and reform their behavior and be nice to people and ditch their stereotypes? No, I'm not that naive. I know people are incredibly wedded to their stereotypes because its much easier to hold onto a stereotype than to try and look deeper. Most people just don't wanna put forth the effort to even try. At most you'll do whats called &quot;Sub Typing&quot;, where you instead of reforming your opinion about a whole group that you stereotype, you'll just make a subclass of said group.<br><br> Example: You don't like French people, but you meet some cool and friendly french people, so instead of challenging your stereotype about french people, you instead just make a subclass of cool french people.<br><br>We do this every day in EQ. I do it, you do it, we all do. Every guild has some nice folks in it that we subclass as &quot;cool members of guild X&quot;, but we still automatically stereotype the rest of the guild &amp; unknown members of said guild around the original stereotype.<br><br>Well the end of the lecture started talking about ways to break down a stereotype about a group. There are 2 ways, Contact, and Internalized Standards. With Contact you not only hang around the group you negatively stereotype, but you have to actually work towards a common goal with'em. I.e. Being in the same area as the other group won't change @#%$. In fact it'll make things worse, because the proximity will provoke increased hostilities. However if ya work towards a common goal, you'll come to appreciate that other group and your stereotypes will break down.<br><br>Then with Internalized Standards, you actually take a look inside yourself. You see the stereotypes, and make an effort to curb your thoughts and actions to change it. But you need a motivation to do this, and it does take a lot of time.<br><br>Well, of late, i've seen both these in practice, and its pretty damn cool. I'm gonna use Nazlug here, cause he belongs to a guild that I  have had my fair share of troubles with. However over the past month, I've had three opprotunities now to work towards a common goal with him. The first was over a trak raid, and we worked it out amiably, and he was incredibly polite (the bastard disarmed me right there). Then again we had a joint Alliance &amp; ED Trak raid. Again, he was incredibly polite, and put up with my raid running style.  Then the other night in Kael he took time out to run a spell over to someone who needed it that I couldn't get too cause of Faction.<br><br>All this added up to get me to thinkin about the stereotypes I held about his guild. I'd been pretty convinced that all members were fairly unequivicably rat bastards, with a couple of subtypes of &quot;cool people&quot;, because of bad experiences I've had in the past with some of their members.<br><br>Then on top of this I spent a day groupped with a member of ED (Zuez) who was again very nice, and instead of ditching his group for a guild raid (he was playing a chanter at the time in the Dining room) he stuck with us. Not many can say they'd stick with a pickup group and pass a guild raid with the glories of phat lewt that accompany them.<br><br>This all got me thinkin, then having Xarpolis, someone i've shot the @#%$ with in the past, and some others in ED be pretty cool and willing to work things out, its all got me to thinkin. I've started looking at why I held the stereotype, and realizing its not fair. I think my hostility towards ED was provoking a hostile response from them.<br><br>So what if I've had a bad run in with a couple of'em, it doesn't mean I should judge'em all as rat bastards. It just means a couple of us really disagree, but that I shouldn't treat'em all that way.<br><br>Anyways, all this stuff has me thinkin about how I react to people and my stereotypes. Thats pretty cool in my opinion, that I'm actually starting to think about this stuff, and see how it corelates with scientific theories of psychology. Cause a) it means I'm getting something for the money I paid to the University and b) i'm learnin more about myself.<br><br>Yes this has been yet another of Xammer's preachy letters, but as I said, I don't expect anyone to gain much of anything from it.  People will stereotype it as &quot;one of Xammer's Preachy letters&quot;, and we'll all desperately cling on to our stereotypes cause its easier to have'em than to change'em. I wrote this cause of how cool I found all this, and all the social interactions and how hard it is to change ones preconceptions. That is pretty damn cool.<br><br>So, to all of you who say this is &quot;just a game&quot;. This is a bit more than just a game, because you are all people interacting with people, and living out our own little lives on line. We carry over our stereotypes building mechanisms from real life, we reinforce them, and sometimes even tear down those stereotypes. I wonder if VI or someone else has a staff Psychologist who is using this as one big ass experiment on social interactions.<br><br>------------------<br>Xammer the True<br>Knight of Rodcet Nife<br>Tarew Marr<br><br>A man with a Gun is a Citizen.<br>A man without a Gun is a Subject.<br><br>Anyone seen my dragon?  <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Drachar Kneebreaker - 57th Ass Kickin' Cleric of Brell<BR>Dahrok Seyzdis            -  46th Drool Machine<BR><BR>"If something can be abused, it will be."  -  Darrin Hyrup made if famous, but stole it from me <g><BR><BR>"Hate is good.

How true it is.. we all do stereotype.  I think it's just a part of human nature, an us and them mentality.  It inevitably is  unavoidable.. but.. we as sentient beings can try to rise above it as much as possible.  I however, will continue to catagorize people such as Foladar/Narhem(Nema)/Eduin/Aldaron in to one big lumpy, smelly catagory.  That's based on personal observation and interaction.. and I can be as stubborn as a Dirf when it comes to that.  But alas some advice from an elderly woman (&lt;g&gt;).. do try to give everyone a fair chance.. as much as possible.. you might just be surprised.<br><br>~Goth <p>Grendul
