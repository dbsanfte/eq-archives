My purpose is to remember what it was like to be a new enchanter and to learn things along the way. <br>
<br>
One thing I recently learned is how to fight two mobs at one time. Given that my enchanter is only lvl 3, this is a fairly safe way to fight in a non-agro situation. I popped a pet and buffed him with my little strength buff. Then I engaged a mob and beat it down to half health, giving it a nice choke as well. I let my pet finish him off while I attacked a second mob. Once my pet was finished with the first mob, it engaged the second. Note: My pet was blue, as were the mobs and they were not mobs that agro each other.<br>
<br>
I would not currently suggest trying this tactic at higher lvls or even with mobs conning even to you, but I got a kick out of trying it. That is, until I tried it without a pet, as he had just been killed by the orc I was attacking. Fortunately for me, the lvl 1 pet spell goes off rather quickly and I was able to take both mobs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub24.ezboard.com/ukelila.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kelila</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lady Enchantress</span><br> <font color=#8B658B>(1/28/01 1:56:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   About Pets</span><hr size=1> Let's face it, our pets suck. But that doesn't mean they aren't usable. At low lvls they allow us to solo a bit better. <br>
<br>
Buff your pet. Give him a dose of strength to help him hit harder. Give him a shield to help him last longer. Don't bother giving him a weapon unless it's one that procs. A rusty dagger won't allow your pet to hit faster or harder than what he comes equipped with and he can't duel wield until higher lvls anyway.<br>
<br>
We can't command our pets, so to get them to engage we have to get a mob to cast on us or take a swing at us. Once my pet has engaged the mob, it gives me a chance to back off and cast a couple of spells either to buff myself or my pet or to debuff or do damage to the mob.<br>
<br>
Many, many times my pet has saved my life. It allows me to run for the nearest guard or head for the zone while it keeps the mob entertained. Unless of course I have multiple mobs. Then I just hope I can run faster or yell loud enough for someone to help me.<br>
<br>
If you are going to be doing mez'ing, don't use a pet. It will break your mez every time.<br>
<br>
Afterthought, we can only have one pet at a time. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub24.ezboard.com/ukelila.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kelila</A> at: 2/7/01 6:54:59 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E8E8E8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub24.ezboard.com/ukelila.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kelila</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lady Enchantress</span><br> <font color=#8B658B>(2/26/01 10:21:42 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Charmed Pets</span><hr size=1> Charm is a wonderful thing. It has saved my life and the lives of my party more than once. It has also resulted in my death.<br>
<br>
If multiple mobs engage me, and I don't already have a pet, charming a mob is a great way to turn the tables of a fight.<br>
<br>
Charmed pets can be given directions such as /pet attack,  /pet guard here, /pet guard me, /pet back off. It's been a while so I'm not entirely sure this is correct, but I don't suggest /pet get lost or /pet sit down as this tends to break the charm and your one time pet is now your enemy.<br>
<br>
I don't usually buff my charmed pets as I don't want that now buffed mob to attack me when charm wears off. This, of course, is strictly a matter of choice and situation.<br>
<br>
I also don't suggest sending your charmed pet into a camp of equal level or higher mobs as your pet will agro everything and then those mobs will come after you once your pet is dead. This also applies to the standard Enchanter pet.<br>
<br>
There is a rumor circulating that higher charisma will result in a longer charm. I have no idea if this is true or not. I've tried it both ways and really can't tell the difference.<br>
<br>
When you are ready to dispose of a charmed pet, there are several ways to do so. The most obvious is to zone. Next is to hide, if you have that ability and it succeeds. This of course, leads to your pet now becoming your enemy and attacking you. Another way is to send it after a mob you believe can kill it. This can have it's downside though if the other mob doesn't die as well. If you are in a group, you can let your group know you are done with the pet and will be releasing it so they can jump on it the moment charm is gone.<br>
<br>
If you are in a group facing multi mobs and you plan on charming one, I highly suggest letting your group know what you are doing. A charmed mob cannot be attacked by your group and you don't want them wasting mana trying to cast on it. <p>Kelila Bloodfacet<br>

He won't/can't equip it. There is a theory that giving equpiment to your pet will increase it's AC but this has not been proven either way. <br>
<br>
Giving weapons to pets:<br>
This will not increase the amount of damage done by your pet. Bonus stats will not affect your pet. However, weapons that proc can be used by your pet. This becomes a particularly attractive ability at lvl 29 when your pet can duel wield 1 handed weapons. Round up some gnoll hide lariats or some velium weapons and watch your pet go to town.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub24.ezboard.com/fhallofillusionsfrm5.showMessage?topicID=4.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub24.ezboard.com/fhallofillusionsfrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub24.ezboard.com/fhallofillusionsfrm5.threadControl?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub24.ezboard.com/fhallofillusionsfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=6.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub24.ezboard.com/fhallofillusionsfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=6.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub24.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="hallofillusionsfrm3">Spells<option value="hallofillusionsfrm2">Research<option value="hallofillusionsfrm1">Quests<option value="hallofillusionsfrm4">Jewel Craft<option value="hallofillusionsfrm5">General Discussions</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8B658B>- </font><a href=http://pub24.ezboard.com/bhallofillusions>Nothing is as it appears</a><font color=#8B658B> - </font><a href=http://pub24.ezboard.com/fhallofillusionsfrm5>General Discussions</a> <font color=#8B658B> - </font><a href="http://www25.brinkster.com/courtofruins/">Court of Ruins</a><font color=#8B658B> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href=http://www.coolsavings.com/index.asp?Ref=ezboard&BN=link-freecouons&BL=print>PRINT FREE COUPONS AT CoolSavings.
