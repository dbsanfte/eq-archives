<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
<br>
Aedwy and Aelfgifu were happy kids growing up in Freeport.  Close like twins are and close their baby brother Aethelbald.  Both were known as being powerful with the ways of magic.  The family’s friends and relatives were proud to watch them grow and master their gift.  They were good students and it on remained to be seen what they would choose as their way of magic, Wizard, Magician or Enchanter.  No one gave a thought that either child would become involved in the circle of dark magic.<br>
<br>
One night, sneaking into the library of the Academy of Arcane Science, they found a “forbidden” section.  This is where they first learned of necromancy.  Both were revolted but Aelfgifu was also somewhat intrigues.  Aedwy had found she had snuck back a few times to read more.  Aelfgifu found one book particularly interesting.  The Book, of all books, was of the Fine Art of Necromancy.  She read and read each spell and direction, drinking in the knowledge of the black magic.<br>
<br>
One day while Aedwy and Aelfgifu were watching after Aethelbald there was an accident.  Their little brother accidentally had fallen into the aqueduct and drowned.   The family as a whole was devastated and this haunted the twins forever.   Aelfgifu felt mostly to blame as her Mother had entrusted the Childs welfare directly with her.<br>
<br>
Aelfgifu began disappearing more often as Aedwy’s suspicions increased.  Aedwy was very aware of his sister’s powerful abilities in casting spells and the direct damage she could do.  He spoke to their teachers about his fears but they did not want to listen.  Believing only that the young girl had an uncanny gift.<br>
<br>
The anger she held inside from the verbal reminders her parents of Aethelbald’s death gave her only strengthened her magical powers.  Every night at the stroke of midnight she would rise from her bed and slip into the Wizard’s library to drink in the power of Swart Nagmerrie’s teaching.   She learned how to drain life, siphon energy and to raise the dead.<br>
<br>
Aedwy could not believe that she would truly follow the magic of necromancy.  As she was his closest relative and friend he trusted he denials.  Then one night he caught her at Aethelbald’s grave trying to resurrect him from the dead!  He hurled his power directly against Aelfgifu’s power to stop her but she was more powerful.  She had always been the most powerful.  He succeeded in stopping her spells but his mana was burned out forever.  Crippled and devastated by the loss he cursed her and denied his love for her, declaring her dead to him.<br>
<br>
Suddenly a powerful necromancer appeared from the hidden guild in Freeport.  He had detected Aelfgifu’s spells and came to seek a disciple, willing or not.  Aelfgifu knew it was Swart Nagmerrie, she suddenly realized the path she on and turned to Aedwy hoping he would persuade her to stay.  He took one last glance at his sister and turned his back.   His mana gone, his courage failed and he simply watched as she was carried away in a portal.  The look in her eyes as she realized he had forsaken her was dark and angry and it haunted him forever.  She stopped struggling at that moment and relinquished her whole being to this dark sorcerer.<br>
<br>
Aedwy’s story<br>
<br>
Aedwy’s magic ability gone and his beloved sister lost due to his pride, stubbornness and cowardice, he drifted into a life of tavern crawling and brawling.  One night in a particularly nasty brawl a Master of the Ashen Order noticed his fighting skills.  His family was contacted and the Order was given permission to take him in, willing or not.  <br>
After a few months of stubborn refusal Aedwy finally began studying in the hopes of being given his freedom.  Instead, he found what he was seeking in the tranquil teachings of Quellious.  He began to tune his mind and body, to embrace the life of a monk.<br>
<br>
The night of Aelfgifu’s disappearance left him with a total hatred for the necromantic arts.  He also never stopped wondering about his sister until one day he saw her!   Delighted, he approached her and realized she was wearing the garb of a necromancer.  Shocked and heartbroken he confronted her.  Aedwy was met with all the accusation he had harbored against himself, cowardice, unforgiveness and selfishness.  Aelfgifu attacked him and he barely escaped with his life.<br>
<br>
<br>
He learned she had embraced the necromantic arts and had even taken a new name.  Their confrontations continued during their infrequent meetings across the lands of Norrath.  Aedwy would try to reach his sister he had once known but she would attack him leaving him with barely a breath of life left.  Finally during one of his journeys he learned that Aefgifu had crept through Freeport during the black of night and killed their parents.  Aedwy swore vengeance then and their conflict continues.  Although, he still harbors a secret hope of redeeming his tortured soul by restoring the sister he once loved.<br>
<br>
Aelfgifu’s story<br>
<br>
As Aelfgifu watched her brother and all she knew slip away into the darkness she felt a rage she had known for years fade.  A voice so deep and soft whispered close to her ear, “know that we are one and all of this world.  You shall learn all that you desire with me.”  Shadows of skulls engulfed and controlled her.  That was the last she remembered until she awoke in a dimly lighted chamber.  As she became aware of her surroundings she felt drained and weary.  A shower of blue light fell over her and she felt herself becoming stronger.  She saw a small figure in the dim light and it approached her speaking in the same deep, soft voice, “I have been watching you for years.  Your powers are great but they need to be trained in control.  I needed to wait until your heart was dark to retrieve you from the light.  I will teach you the strength and control of necromancy.”  She immediately knew who this dark elf male was, SWART NAGMERRIE!!!!!<br>
<br>
With delight and astonishment she fell to her knees vowing forever loyalty to him and the black arts.  With a gentle hand he raised her to her feet while saying, “My child, I am only your teacher.  We are all disciples 0f Lyris Moonbane, our Guild Master.  With the hunger of a new born she absorbed his knowledge alarming Swart of the power she controlled.  She grew in strength of the magic at an alarming rate. <br>
<br>
Daily she asked when she would meet the Master.  The answer she received was the same each time, “Soon my child the Master will call upon me, and then we will go.”  That day finally came after many years of training and practicing in the darkness of the Freeport aqueducts.  Swart told her to find a name she wanted to be known as for the rest of her undead life.  That day she saw the  Norrath’s surface for the first time since she relinquished  herself to Swart.  It did not look the same some how, her eyes felt different.  She then remembered she was seeing through the night with a spell, which illuminates the night for humans.  The made the long trek to Qeynos from Freeport during the dark of night making it to the guild just before day breaks.<br>
<br>
Upon arrival to the guild deep in the bowls of the aqueduct Aelfgifu began to feel another power, one so strong that she felt fear run through her bones.  Swart told her that this be her guild from this day forward as a human necromancer.  She met Lyris Moonbane and was asked what her name would be.  Aelfgifu stated with honor and pride in her heart,  “From this day forward Great One I shall be known as “Pikdonker”.”  The Guild Master then told her to think  long and hard about her surname.  That as she progressed in her levels of learning she would be granted  the right to take one.  Without hesitation she turned to her teacher Swart and said, “I do not need to think about it Great One as Swart Nagmerrie is the only family I know.  Therefore, I will be honored to carry his name and legacy on. My surname shall be “Nagmerrie”.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As the festivities of the induction of Pikdonker into the guild wore on she slipped away to the surface to practice her skills.  She traveled to Blackburrow, a dungeon of treacherous gnolls.  Her skills and abilities became powerful enough to move out further in the world.  As she explored the continent she thought that one she would find Aedwy.  She dreamed of how she would destroy him for his cowardice that fateful night.  Just as this passed from her mind there he was dressed in the Holy dress of the Monk Guild.  This made it even more pleasant to her to torture him for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>
She had vowed to kill her parents for the cruelty she endured from them after the death of Aethelbald.  One moonless night she passed through the shadows of Freeport and crucified her parents.  Leaving only the lifeless hides of their bodies lying flat on the floor of the home she once felt safe in.  <br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER ONE<br>
<br>
It was a very quiet night with the exception in the area of the docks.  The activity continued well past midnight and many felt it actually improved in those hours.  The Wizard’s Guild however, was quite deserted.  Aedwy and Aelfgifu had prepared will.  The seldom used door in the basement was blocked open and unlocked as they had left it after class that day.  Stifling giggles they crept through the door.  Sincerely hoping no magical wards had been left in place.  They checked as best they could but, their training was still in its infancy.<br>
<br>
The basement was a fascinating place.  It features a number of interesting items, including a large collection of glowing gems, a large green brass cornered box that seemed to be quivering and trying to move.  An entire wall hung with skulls and other bones from creatures whose living appearance could only be guessed.    A series of cubbyholes were hidden by shutters stuffed with molding, crumbling scrolls that were very tempting.  There was a VERY tempting floating sphere covered partially with the maps of Norrath.  They were frustratingly over much of the surface.  Along with all of these items there are innumerable boxes, crates, closets and other containers filled with who knew what wonderful and mysterious items.<br>
<br>
Oh yes, they could spend hours down there digging through these items, pouring over the scrolls and sorting out the boxes.  Though they had a specific destination in mind. with a long look back, they headed up the stairs that seemed to be going down.  Negotiating a few corridors, some of which seemed to share the same space as others they had already passed through.  Or they actually lead them outside the confines of the building but, they were used to that by now.  They finally came to the large ebon door emblazoned with a silver lintel, “THE LIBRARY”.<br>
<br>
AH!!! The Library, for the children it was the closest thing they had found to heaven.  It was huge, cavernous  area filled with shelves of books, scrolls, maps, tablets and other esoteric mediums.  They had spent many hours here in the course of their studies.  Some boring, such as when they had spent two weeks memorizing the ingredients for various alchemical potions.  A skill they clearly would never use.  “??Doesn’t mean ye canna comprehend it now, does it?????”,  the Master had said in reply to their complaints.  Honestly though, some of it was interesting.<br>
<br>
It was The Library that they were bound this night and particualrly to one room.  The small room in the back corner whose door was physically secured only with a small padlock.  Wards and glyphs more powerfully protected it.  The Black Room, the Master called it when they mentioned it at all.  It was the only place from which Aedwy and Aelfgifu had been forbidden.  So, of course, it was the one place they burned to enter.<br>
<br>
Although, this was the Wizard’s Guild, the Master kept a large collection on all types of magic, particularly those disciplines of the so-called pure casters.  Aedwy and Aelfgifu had read much in all of these collections, studying the similiarities and the differences of Wizards, Magicians and Enchanters. <br>
<br>
Indeed, despite their education being handled under the auspices of the Wizards, with whom their tradesman Father had long had a strong business relationship, neither had decided what profession to undertake.  This relationship guaranteed they  would  be accepted in whichever guild the chose was a foregone conclusion.  Everyone who had tested them said the same thing.  Not in centuries had two such powerful wielders of mana and spirit been born to the same family.  The fact that they were twins made this only more striking as their flame colored hair marked them as a pair.  Even more, so did the power of their auras.<br>
<br>
<br>
Not that they were identical, not by any means.  Their eyes were the first difference people noticed.  Aedwy had deep green eyes, when looking into them one sensed certain tranquility.  Not lethargy, for he was a fervent and passionate scholar.  There was a certain acceptance of him and the world as he found it.  Aelfgifu was diefferent, those who looked into her ice blue eyes were frequently taken aback.  They found what startled them difficult to put in to words.  ???The lass has a destiny and she knows it???.”, one elder relative had said.  Most thought that was as accurate a description as one could want.  Though they did not know how true this statement was.<br>
<br>
Reckless, impudent, headstrong, these were terms their teaachers applied to Aelfgifu.  Although admittedly not without a bit of pleasure in their voices.  She had been repeatedly  warned not to try things beyond the current scope of her training, for the penalties could be severe.  Such as burnout, maddness, even death could result.  Though she burned always to know more, to be able to do more and even the Master acknowledged that this was the way of a true visionary.  They were quietly and secretly proud of that, they had such a wonder to train and mold.<br>
<br>
Here they were, trying to get into the Black Room.  Of course the expedition had been Aelfgifu’s idea.  Knowing a<br>
that all this knowledge laid in wait inside being denied her, even if only for a few years, had been a thorn she could not ignore.  She had devoted herself to mastering the wards and glyphs on the door.  Studying all the texts she could find on the seal protecting the portal.  She surreptiously watched the somatic gestures of any Master who happened to pass with in.  Even on one occasion risking minor illusion on her so that she could stand close enough to eavesdrop on the words spoken to unseal the door.<br>
<br>
Eventually she was convinced she knew the pattern and sequences of the door wards.  Only then had she approached Aedwy and told him of her plan.  This was not without so trepidation, she knew that the restrictions regarding the door bothered him not at all.  For e was quite willing to wait until the Masters chose to permit them to enter.  She also knew he would not approve of her plan due to the potential danger to them and to  the wrath they would incur if caught.<br>
<br>
She proposed it one night after sneaking into his room in their small East Freeport home.  As she had expected he objected to the idea but, it was clear from the start he would acquiese.  From his earliest memories he had been devoted to his sister, a bit in awe of her power and passion.  It was nearly impossible for him to deny her much.<br>
<br>
Finally he joined her palnning.  Rejecting her complicated plan of using barely mastered spells of invisibility and levitation to gain access to the Guild.  He proposed the simple, non magical idea of blocking the basement door open.  Both were fairly sure that this door at least was non-warded.  The Wizards did not particularly seek to keep folks our of their building, if anything they wished it protected with its own guards.  Either on the door, container or on the item itself.  Enough eatly and late deliveries were made to the basement that it would have been nearly impractical to continually worry about, for instance, turning the milkman into a toad if someone forgot to clear the door.<br>
<br>
<br>
This had been accomplished earlier in the day and had worked perfectly.  Now here they were, in the Library, quietly moving through the stacks to the door the sought.  The Black Room, a totally nondescript door with no label and no odbvious lock or handle. <br>
 Now was the real test for this door was guarded and a missed step by Aelfgifu in the opening ritual would end their expedition quite dramatically.<br>
<br>
This concern was for naught and neither had really worried.  Aedwy knew that if Aelfgifu said she and mastered the doors ritualy, then she had.  Aedwy knew his sister well enough that she had not false boasting of  her abilities and that this was not one of her vices.  A series of whispered words, a sequence of passes with her hand.  They heard a quiet click as the door slipped open.  Hands on her hips she turns to Aedwy and spouted, “have you ever doubted me?”  Hand in hand with their hearts pounding in their ears they passed through the threshold.<br>
<br>
The room was musty and dank with only the slightest of light glaring through a small hole in the center of the ceiling.  They squinted their eyes trying to focus on what was before them.  Finally it came clear as their eyes adjusted to the lack of light.  It was a large room with a round table and four cumbersome chairs around it.  Looking from side to side both children saw rows and rows of ancient books.  Aelfgifu uttered one small word of ecstacy, “Oh.”  Without thought of any other possible wards of glyphs that may have been  in place she raced forward to the bookshelves.  Starting on the left side of the room  she walked holding her hand against the bindings of the books.  She felt a surge of incedible power from each book.  It was as if she was being drawn to them, in a speicific direction.    The power hit her like the Master’s spell of discipline, hard and heavy.  Her feet stopped and her mind raced as her hand moved up to the binding of one large book.  She pulled it out and hugged it, running her hand over the cover like an addiction.  She read the title to herslef, “The Fine Art of Necromancy”.<br>
<br>
Aedwy was totally taken by the table and all of its carvings and symbols.  Not able to read the menaing of all of them he recognized enough to know that this was an extrememly evil room.  Looking up from the tabletop he saw his sister gazing at a book.  She looked transfixed as if she were under a drunken spell.  he moved towards her asking, “Sister, what have you found?  What are you doing?  Come, we must leave this chaotic realm.”  He was met with her cold blue eyes, a gaze he had never seen.  Frightened of what he saw he backed away  and out of the room.  Finally he gave her an ultimatum, “Come now or I shall fetch the Master, this room is evil and we should not be in here.”  The mention of the Master broke her trance as she gently replaced the book in the slot from which it came.  Moving toward her brother she had a wicked wild smile on her face and a cruel glare in her eyes.  Aedwy quickly closed the door behind them and head the soft click of the latch.  Grabbing his sister’s hand he physically pulled her back through the corridors they had presently snuck.  His heart pounding so hard all he could hear was the rush of his blood in his ears.  He thought that light of day at the end of the last corridor would never come.  Having to pull a resisting force behind him only made it that much farther away.  Finally, through the basement door into the early evening light he thrust himself and his sister.  The feeling of dark chaos, evil and the power of it had overwhelmed him.  He feared all that was present in the Black Room and vowed never to return.  Aedwy turned to look at his sister who was tugging on the basement door as if she had forgotten that it was locked.  Softly he touched her, sensing her desire to return to the lower reaches from which they came.<br>
<br>
Aelfgifu felt the gentle touch of her brother on her shoulder.  Sensing it, she turned adburptly twards Aedwy.  This made him jump back feeling almost afraid of Aeflgifu.  She blinked and looked around as if unware of her surroundings.  She looked at her brother and asked, “What Happened?”  Aedwy told her everything that happened and how it had affected her.  She told him that she remembered only entering the chamber then touching the books.  There was s surge of power and dark energy that infused her to the books.  She said, “I had not control of myslef or what I was doing.  I know I was drawn to one book.  The name was The Art of Necromancy.  What did I do?”  Aedwy replied, “Sister you looked as if you were possessed.  When I called to you to leave the look in your eyes was dark and evil.  As if you did not recognize me.  I had to threaten to retrieve the Master to get you to follow me.  I do not like that room and will not go back.  I can only hope you do the same.”<br>
<br>
As the days and weeks progressed Aelfgifu felt a yearning to return to The Black Room.  She did not understand why, she only knew she needed to go.  One night she heard the church bell toll once for the midnight hour. <br>
<br>
 She raised from her bed and unconscienciously  went to The Black Room.  through the dark of night she read the book of  The Fine Art of Necromancy.   Absorbing the evil spells and teachings of Swart nagmerrie.  Just before light of dawn  crept over the horizon she slipped quietly through the house.  Gently opening and closing doors as she tiptoed to her room.<br>
<br>
It seemed only minures had passed and her brother came bounding into her room full of life and spirit.  Shout in to her, “Good morning sister-o-mine!! It’s a fine day for learning!! Rise and let’s eat!!”  All she could think was, “Ahhhh....for the sake of all that is evil, begone and let me sleep.”  She knew she had to get up and trudge through more lessons of purity in casting.  At a wave of her hands and uttered word she felt somewhat rejuevinated.  One thing she was thankful for the Master taught her, the spell of healing.<br>
<br>
Days turned into weeks, then weeks into months.  During this time a family tragedy occureed.  On a warm spring morning Aelfgifu  was charged with the care of their baby brother of five years old.  Being the ripe age of twelve, their Mother and Father felt they had the maturity to watch over Aethelbald.<br>
<br>
Their parents were going  to the neighboring merchants in the Commons area to sell and buy for the day.  They left very ealry, before the first glint of day.  Aelfgifu had barely made it back from The Black Room when her Mother came to her room.  With baby brother in her arms she laid the child down with his sister.  She was relieved to see him still asleep as she was not near ready to wake.  Her Mother kissed the boy then  her on the forehead brushing her hair from her face and smiled.  As she left her Mother said quietly,  “Take care of the boys, you know how they are when we are gone.”  Aelfgifu barely heard her as she slipped back to sleep. <br>
<br>
It was late mornign when Aelfgifu was ripped from her slumber.  Screaming she could not indetify was coming from outside.  She vaulted out of bed and through the house.   As  she flung the door open wide there was Aedwy with Aethelbald’s limp body in his arms.  Aedwy bllowed, “CAST YOUR HEAL SPELL!!!” She did and the child did not respond.  “AGAIN, AGAIN, again!!!!”, he wailed.  Aelfgifu cast the spell till her mana was gone.  Then she cast onto Aedwy to use mana.  To no avail the child would live.<br>
<br>
By this time nearly the whole town was gathered around the three.  Aelfgifu’s mind was running wild.  She thought, “How did this happen?  How did I not feel him leave the bed?  What am I going to do?  Our parents!!!!”  Aedwy sat crumpled on the ground holding on to his little brother sobbing and rocking back and forth.  “Where did you find Aethelbald?”   Aedwy replied weakly, “He was not in his bed, I looked in your room and he was not there.  I looked through the house then outside.  I finally tracked him with our spell Locate Aethelbald that we made.”  Aedwy buried his face into his brothers little neck and wept incontrallably.  Aelfgifu could not understand why she did not feel the same pain as Aedwy.  She felt remorse but, she did not feel the loss as her brother did.<br>
<br>
As she stood over her bothers pondering this perplexing lack of pain she felt a gentle hand of her shoulder.  It was the Master, now it all came tumbling down on her.  She remembered Mother’s words, “Take care of the boys, you know how they are when we are gone.”  She screamed, “BY THE SPIRITS THAT BIND US TO THIS WORLD, WHAT HAVE I DONE?!?”<br>
