<br>
What's the current format because it's not real clear? I.e. is there a way to request the help of guild resources - or a ritual if you will - and are there assigned raid leaders? It looks more like almost pick-up raids most of the time for Amazon - which is fine. But for epic raid purposes you kind of need a place to post your request for help.<br>

<br>
Good, thorough post. I'm more than willing to help anyone else in the guild on their epics. But since you sort of invited my opinion in with your post...<br>
<br>
I don't want to come from the perspective of an individual saying &quot;help me, only my epic is important.&quot; I'm actually saying this as I've been on the flip side of the coin - how do you, as a raid leader, know who is where on their epic? And how, as an individual, do you get everyone to come along and help you?<br>
<br>
I'm not sure as I've only been here three days, but I assume that despite not having titles, there are a few people whom everyone turns to to lead the raids. Now, as this leader, if you don't know what stage everyone is at you can't schedule a fair raiding schedule. <br>
<br>
It's all fine and good to do raids for friends as they send you tells, but maybe some people are less outgoing then say - me.<br>
<br>
I note that Twig started a string for epics - it would be cool if something like that could be stickied in one spot and as epic stages were accomplished topics could be deleted. I really don't know how to exactly set it up as I know epics can sometimes be a sensitive issue for everyone.<br>
<br>
How do you keep things fair? How do you keep from stepping on someone's toes as a raid leader when you say &quot;I'm sorry so and so asked me to do theirs first - I promis you're next.&quot; Invariably someone's toes are going to get stepped on unless the rules are pretty straight.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I hope I'm not giving the impression that I'm trying to impose or manipulate as that is not my intention. When I join a guild I put 100% effort into supporting it. I only left BWH after having spent over a year with them because it essentially folded during my leave of absence. I joined Amazon because I like the kind of laid back, family atmosphere, with raids mixed in - you guys have done a great job here in that regards. <br>

P.S. About the topic.  <br>
I try to just help people who ask and make it clear what they want to do. Sometimes i do get bogged down and do have things id like to do on my own or may need help myself with a quest.  As far as im concerned i have no problems with anyone in the guild and ill help anyone who asks.  I wont avoid you or anything like that but i will occasionally say no when people ask.  I also (agreeing with nuv)  think that A. You should try to accomplish as much as possible before asking the whole guild to show to something.  and B. I am Big on telling you if i cant handle leading a raid.  for example: Everyone who has asked me to lead a poa or hate raid has met an answer of.....I dont know how to lead that, and they are both longer raids that will be hard to rally people to on a short notice.  Now if you ask for help in the hole....i own that place.  Ive wooped everyone at one point or another in the zone and ill be happy to lead.<br>
<br>
I also want to point out one Big thing Nuv said.  Please dont get disheartend or feel like the guild is against you because one of your raids didnt happen.  I always feel that RL comes first and ill walk away from EQ at the drop of a hat if something comes up even if im a leader of a raid.  My family and Job are too important to me.  Sometimes Extremely rare mobs pop up that would benefit the guild as a whole vs one persons epic. Sometimes we just wont have the amount of people needed and sometimes people just wont be in the right groove to raid.     Keep trying.  we will accomplish them all.<br>

<br>
As far as scheduling epic raids goes.  The person who needs the piece from Plane XXX should schedule a time and date that is convenient to them, then thye should let an officer know this scheduled event and it will be added to the Guild MOTD.  Based on turnout, the raid will happen.  No one should complain if they didn't put up a reasonable schedule for their particular epic raid.  We can't help someone if they aren't online, or if they only have an hour or 2 to kill, or if they don't even let us know where they are in their epic.  <br>
<br>
As far as knowing who is where on their epic, the post we have floating around in the members section is about all we have for the moment.  Getting the support needed is not an obligation of the guild or it's officers, period.  Make friends with your guildies, and ask them to help out.  Your friends invite their friends, etc, etc, until you have what you need to make the raid happen. Simple as that.  As a raid leader I do not want to plan Hate Raids, Fear Raids, etc.  If no one else more qualified is present and I'm going along for the ride, I'll be more than happy to lead.  If I call a raid, it's going to be for something like ToV, Vindi, etc.<br>
<br>
As far as having people more qualified for leadership roles than others, that's a perception that I don't like people to get.  If you've been through a raid a few times and know basically what needs to be done, then you are qualified to lead as far as I'm concerned.  Everything else about leading raids gets picked up along the way.  The major limiting factor is yourself.  But yes, there are some people that get counted on to lead more raids than others. That is mainly based on their success in past raids, nothing more.  We are limited on those types types of people though, and I would like to see some more active leaders in our ranks.<br>
<br>
This is a social game, so I hope everyone is outgoing enough to say &quot;Hey, does anyone want to help with Mob_X?&quot;  I can not be responsible for people who don't take initiative.<br>
<br>
As far as getting the Epic Raid topic stickied, I'm not sure who's a moderator on these boards anymore besides Drydon.<br>
<br>
As far as stepping on toes goes, everyone here is an adult.  If you aren't this isn't really the guild for you.  I myself have no problem with being patient.  If you feel that because you scheduled a raid on top of someone else's that you are being slighted, you're selfish.  Help your guildie out, then ask them to help you out on yours.  It's all about friendships and nothing about stepping on toes.  You should be every bit as willing to help out your fellow guildmate if you ever expect them to do the same for you.<br>
<br>
Please don't get me wrong, as this post may sound rather harsh.  I'm just prone to giving people the raw facts, and it tends to rub some people wrong.  I'm really a nice guy once I get to know you, ask anyone (Well, almost anyone).  I just feel that new members should not be expecting to join Amazon to get their epics.  I'm way past wanting to farm epics and would rather be farming NToV at this point.  We've got a lot of newer people in the guild now, and I wish the best for you all as an Amazon, but that does not mean we're going to go out and farm epics for everyone.  <br>
<br>
We, as a guild, are capable of so much more if we concentrate on it.  The main thing holding us up now is the level range, put some levels on and our strength will grow tenfold.  Level 60 &gt; Epic for pretty much any class.  Very few epics have any lasting value in this game.  The only ones that make a big difference are epics with effects that are very expensive to come by elsewhere.  Examples are Swiftwind for rangers, Whistling Fists for monks, Water Sprinklers for clerics, Serpent Staffs for chanters.  Most other epic effects are worthless on a long enough timeline.  The saves on epics are nice, but based on experience, resists are nowhere near as important as levels when it actually comes to resisting.  A level 60 with 75 resists will always fare better than a level 51-55 with 200+, that's just the way it works. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.cox.net/amazonguild/sigs/nuvarre.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
Honestly I don't consider your posy too harsh — it's obviously a well thought out response, and I respect that. Ultimately it sounds like the primary hang-up I have is not having a centralk spot to turn to to find a spot for raid organization. But honestly I'm fine with the way that it is set up if it's been working.<br>
<br>
Heck, I'm only level 54 and I defer to the 60+ people and their experience. I agree that epics are not everything, but in most cases they are the most difficult to complete as tyhey require several steps...most times easily organized, but sometimes moe difficult.<br>
<br>
i.e. Phinigal Autopros sometimes needs to be taken down 15-20 times before he drops the wiz epic piece. <br>
<br>
I also didn't want to give the impression that epic raid attendance be a requirement - only if you want to get your own. But again, if this guild has something good going I can live with that for now.<br>
<br>
I know the guild is at the stage - overall - beyond epic raids. <br>
<br>
I appreciate the debate though - it's always good to bring up and toss around subjects like this if they concern you in any way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e7ddc0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub24.ezboard.com/bamazonguild.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rjs68olds>RJs68Olds</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 840<br> <font color=#2F2F4F>(4/10/03 12:13:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub24.ezboard.com/famazonguildfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=331.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How does raiding work?</span><hr size=1> I do agree that the raid scheduling setup that we have (or more or less don't have)  isn't very effective.  But, every attempt that has been made in the past to organize things into a calendar type system hasn't really changed anything.  In all honesty, the Guild MOTD is by far the best place to put any raid plans.  Nothing has the visibility that the MOTD does.  I'd make a generous guesstimate that even at it's prime, only about 40% of the guild actually visited these boards more than once a month, and that's being very generous.  I'm guessing more like 25%, just look at the number of different names you see here on the boards and compare them to the Guild Window.<br>
<br>
In addition, I'd have to say that every calendar system is doomed to failure when it concerns mobs that are never up for very long.  Go to any major guild's webpage and look for their calendar, they don't have one for the most part, or it's been long abandoned due to it's uselessness.  The only thing they are handy for is all day farm-fest events really.  And even then it's not exactly foolproof because some other guild may have the same idea at the same time you do.<br>
<br>
Instead we, as a guild, should be more ready to organize on targets of opportunity that do pop up through the day.  In the past the major thing that has hurt us is the general lack of motivation when it comes to getting together for a target when it is called.  In my opinion, a lot of the problem lies in the general lack of zone connectivity knowledge.  At 55+ you should know how to get from the nexus to UP, or from CS to ToV. If you don't, there about 1,000,000 places you can go to find maps. And with the UI able to run in a window you have no excuse for getting lost anymore.  Hell, they've even added a map to the UI for most zones used for general travel.  Mobilization is key here, not planning.  <br>
<br>
When we do have a shot at something that drops good loot, we should have druids and wizzies doing pickups and people running as fast as they can to get to the nearest ring/spire.  With PoP and the PoK book system in general, almost every zone is within easy reach.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, Epics are a very personal stepping stone and I think everyone should get theirs.  But, I do not feel it is the responsibility of the guild to get each member their epic.  It is more the responsibility of the person, and the friends he makes along the way.  When I did my epic, about 1/4, maybe 1/2 of the people who came along to kill Faydedar were in Amazon.  I sat there and just asked friends to come over and sit with me throughout the day until I felt there were enough people present to make an attempt.  I ended up with major overkill and it was a very anticlimatic battle.

<br>
What you need to do is get all - I mean all - of the druids/wizs who like to raid trained as transport officers. This means when a target of opportunity does pop-up there should be a couple on who can rush to helping pick people up.<br>
<br>
Generally those who have the ability to port around quickly are much more willing to go after the targets of opportunity - which I agree tend to be the order of the day. And they are also more aware of how to get around as they have been playing a class for a year that easily gets them to any zone.<br>
<br>
If they are additionally given the job as port officer for every raid they would get very effecient at grabbing people.<br>
<br>
This theory would extend to everyone who attends raids. I won't go over all the possible jobs, but others should have some sort of organizational/leadership task asigned to them that stays consistent from raid to raid.<br>
<br>
Consistency and understanding one's role makes for a much more efficient, mobile, quick-reacting, blitzkrieging, elite...ok getting carried away <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ... force that can react to targets of opportunity as they pop-up.<br>

My question is, if one is assigned this position, will it be their responcibility to be available for every event?<br>
 Perhaps I missunderstood, please clarify.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Didanu Fallingleaf<br>

<br>
Secondly, it is based on the fact that most boss MOBs that people would like to raid are targets of opportunity that rarely pop up, and that you must quickly react to.<br>
<br>
I think everyone did a great job in reacting to Severilous on Saturday. However, this was mostly due to the fact there were several porters on who wanted to be part of the raid, and helped bring people there. What happens the day that everyone's gung-ho, but all the porters are lazy, working on their epics or something? Since it's in the middle of nowhere, without the porters that raid wouldn't have happened. <br>
<br>
That said, raid job requirements are really something that should be based on a guild's mission statement. I tend to think that *requirement* is kind of harsh and unnecessary if a guild is functioning well and taking down MOBs consistently and efficiently - especially when a guild's mission statement is:<br>
<br>
&quot;Ours is a guild based on trust and honor more than anything else. We don't invite &quot;characters&quot; into Amazon, we invite PEOPLE.&quot;<br>
<br>
In other words it's not a guild based on uberness and getting the best loot.<br>
<br>
That said, getting in the mindset that everyone has a specific job cannot hurt. In my opinion, <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">when people decide they want to attend a raid they should have certain jobs *written down* that they must fulfill in terms of organization</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> - just like everyone has specific jobs when you're actually engaging the MOB.<br>
<br>
I mean let's face it, once you get to the 50+ levels raiding is a huge part of EQ whether or not your a family-oriented guild. So why not make the guild as efficient as possible at it? That's how you become the envy of all Xegony. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
