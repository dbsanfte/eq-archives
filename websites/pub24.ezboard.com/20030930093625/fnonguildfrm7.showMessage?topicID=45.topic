Common: "Love is the least fair of the arenas of combat."<br>
<br>
<br>
I first met Jhonas D'Shen at the Northern Neriak School for the Gifted, in the summer of our 17th year. The quiet, unassuming eldest son of a priest, Jhonas had evidenced remarkable balance and agility at an early age. This, combined with an extraordinary sense for battlefield tactics, caught the attention of his superiors, and he was widely regarded as one of the most talented warriors and marksmen to come out of Neriak in some time. When he set his marks on Chariss L'Mour, everyone expected that the two would be married shortly thereafter.<br>
<br>
Chariss was born a pauper, but possessed an inuitive understanding of the arkane. She was studying to be an enchanter, and aspired to work in the Neriak Library. However, her secret dream--a dream that she confided only in me--was to eventually see the library in Erudin, for she loved books more than she loved people. "They never leave me," she said. "And they are patient, and full of wisdom, and speak to me in a language that I understand..." Books were one of two all-consuming loves in her life.<br>
<br>
I was the other.<br>
<br>
"I saw you sparring one day," she said. "I watched you disarm your opponent, and then allow him to retrieve his weapon." She smiled. "My favorite character in Swords of Battle did that once."<br>
"Oh?" I said. "Arent the stories in that book ficticious?"<br>
"Yes," she said, "But you are not."<br>
<br>
Chariss and I grew to be good friends. She helped me understand the subtleties of the language of Ancient Erudin, and I taught her what I knew about military history. I had no useful advice concerning Jhonas however.<br>
<br>
"He loves you, Chariss. He is a good warrior, and a good man."<br>
"But i do not love HIM, Nico Tsoi (Tsoi means "silly man" or "one who does not comprehend" in Ancient Erudian.) And I would rather spend my life alone, with my books, than with someone I do not love."<br>
<br>
After trying unsuccessfully for some time to disuade Jhonas from his pursuit, she decided to make good on her oath, and she left Neriak one evening without saying goodbye. Perhaps she thought I would try to convince her to stay, but I would not have. Dreams are sometimes more important than life.<br>
<br>
I never saw her again, but a friend of mine in Erudin cut out the following from the Erudian Times, as he thought it might be of interest to me:<br>
<br>
"6/28/3190 Early last evening an unarmed female Tier'dal was killed at the gates of Erudin by city guards, who suspected a trap. She possessed no identification and few belongings, besides a dog-earred copy of the popular novel Swords of Battle. When she approached the guards, she spoke in a language they did not understand; it was later determined that the language was Ancient Erudian, and that she had said, "I come in peace. Please. I only wish to see the library."<br>
<br>
Jhonas had been maimed by Chariss's rejections, but had hidden it well. Her death shattered him however. He became haggard, haunted, reckless. By the time we graduated, he was considered a loose cannon, and accepted command of a small division at the only place loose cannons were allowed to exist--Kunark.<br>
<br>
I saw him only once more, years after our graduation... It was in the Frontier Mountains. His division encountered a heavily armed group of Iksar almost at the same time I ran into them. The resulting battle was horrific, even by my standards. No tactics were used--the two sides stood toe-to-claw and tore each others flesh into piles, the living crawling over the dead to continue fighting.<br>
<br>
I inflicted savage casualties, but could not turn the tide of the battle, and the entire division perished, sans Jhonas. We killed the final Iksar together, and for a moment I thought he was going to attack me, so vacant were his eyes. When they focused, he looked around. Tears washed blood off of his face in tiny rivlets, and he fell to his knees.<br>
<br>
"She is...gone Nico."<br>
"I know Jhonas. Shes been gone for a long time." I scanned him for lethal injuries, but saw none. He would live.<br>
"I still miss her. I think about her all the time, and I wonder..." His voice trailed off, and he wept openly.<br>
"We should return to the Outpost," I said. "It will be daylight soon, and we're injured."<br>
"Return? To what? My echoes?" He looked up at me, his voice barely a whisper now. "I am...an echo... I live, dreamless, among the dead."<br>
<br>
I nodded. An entire division of young Tier'dal now did as well...  You might think me callous for never questioning what I did next. Bear in mind that I do not, nor have I ever, believed in "good" or "bad"--only in "correct" and "incorrect". I did the correct thing in my mind. And, I believe, in his.<br>
<br>
I drew my sword<br>
I whispered "Close your eyes and dream, Jhonas,"<br>
and I drove the steel into his heart.<br>
<br>
The sad, trace of a smile that drifted across his features as he slumped to the ground assured me that the pain of the blade was nothing relative to what he had already endured.<br>
<br>
When I returned to the Outpost, I made sure that he and his division were buried with full military honors, and created a story surrounding his heroic downfall at the hands of over 40 Iksar that would have been perfectly at home in Swords of Battle.<br>
