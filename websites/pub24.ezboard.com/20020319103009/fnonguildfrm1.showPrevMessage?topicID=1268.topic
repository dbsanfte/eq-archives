                        Quests<br>
<br>
                             Ragefire portion of the Cleric Epic quest has been changed. Please see the Developer's<br>
                             Corner on our web site for more details <br>
                             Added Quest NPCs to Thurgadin, Kael and Skyshrine for Beastlord quest armor <br>
                             Gravel leaf tea will now fit in the combine container for the associated quest <br>
                             Grimling Blood should now be dropping <br>
                             Idia in the bard guild in Kelethin was telling you to turn in a quest item to the incorrect<br>
                             NPC. Changed quest text to reflect the correct NPC to hand the item to <br>
                             In Iceclad, Keref Spiritspear won't be so unreasonable when you complete the task<br>
                             that he asks of you <br>
                             Citizens in skyshrine no longer defend the 'vermin' spiders <br>
                             Increased the drop rate of the Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth <br>
                             Bloody Shak Dratha Hearts should now be dropping <br>
                             Quest of Nobility should now be working properly <br>
                             Increased the spawn rate of Brother Qwinn tenfold <br>
<br>
                        Items<br>
<br>
                             Adjusted statistics on equipment that was dropping in the Umbral Plains. Many of the<br>
                             items had AC that was inconsistent with the armor types of the classes. The AC has<br>
                             been reduced on some pieces and raised on others. In all instances where the AC was<br>
                             dropped a different statistic was raised. Several items received a significant upgrade<br>
                             while others were downgraded <br>
                             Also in regards to Umbral Plains armor, Ranger has been removed from the plate class<br>
                             armor that was dropping and have been added to the usable classes on the chain<br>
                             equivalent. Bards have been added to the plate equipment list. This might mean that<br>
                             some Rangers will have armor that they can't use. Our Customer Service personnel will<br>
                             trade out that armor for the chain equivalent <br>
                             Ghoulbane is now No-Drop <br>
                             SoulFire charges can only be used by Paladins (though they can be used from<br>
                             inventory) <br>
                             Raised the armor value on many Beastlord specific armor pieces <br>
                             Added effects to a few of the Wild Lord's armor pieces <br>
                             Added Vah Shir to Imbrued Plate Mail useable races <br>
                             Rhino Hide armor is now Druid and Monk usable <br>
                             The Crustacean Shell Shield is now magic <br>
                             Scroll of Knowledge can now be equipped in the primary, secondary, and range slots <br>
                             Scroll of Enlightenment can now be equipped in the primary, secondary, and range<br>
                             slots <br>
                             Thought Horror Fangs can now be thrown <br>
                             Iron Scroll of War must now be worn to activate <br>
                             Cloak of Thorns right click effect should work now <br>
                             Runed Bone Fork is now equippable primary, secondary and ranged. The &quot;range&quot; value<br>
                             has been removed to prevent people from accidentally throwing them <br>
                             Spider Fur Collar has been given weight 0.0 to be consistent with other pieces <br>
                             Dark Cloak of the Sky must now be worn to activate <br>
                             Sage's Crown is now No-Drop to match every other Velious quest armor <br>
                             Icicle Circlet is now No-Drop to match every other Velious quest armor <br>
                             Bone Collar of the Possessed should no longer cause players to crash when inventory is<br>
                             opened <br>
                             Idol of Rallos Zek can now be used by ShadowKnights <br>
                             Helm of Grim Blessings can now be used by Wood Elves <br>
                             Flayed Skin Bracer is no longer a Lore item <br>
                             Greaves of Avoidance can now be used by all races <br>
                             Steel Threaded Wrist Wraps are no longer lore <br>
                             Bravado's Breastplate now grants a larger Hit Point bonus <br>
                             Guise of the Hunter can now also be worn by human bards and rogues <br>
                             Primal Cudgel now has the proper effect <br>
                             Added &quot;Recommended Level&quot; equal to the current item use level for the several items.<br>
                             All of these items require the player to be level 51+ to equip them and/or use their<br>
                             effects. Setting the &quot;Recommended Level&quot; field like this just lets the player know what<br>
                             level they need to be to use the item. The actual utility of the item was not affected<br>
                             in any way, this change is purely informational <br>
                             Several items have been changed to be not useable by Iksar. They had been<br>
                             erroneously set as Iksar useable in the last item patch. These were primarily items that<br>
                             were usable by Beastlords (and were therefore changed to allow all Beastlord races to<br>
                             use them), but that had been specifically restricted from use by Iksar due to their<br>
                             inherent armor value <br>
<br>
                        Zones<br>
<br>
                             Shades in Umbral, Maiden's Eye and Vex Thall are now considered undead <br>
                             Placed portals to and from Great Divide and Nexus <br>
                             Added many new items to better round out the rewards for high-level Luclin<br>
                             encounters <br>
<br>
                        Horses<br>
<br>
                             Implemented horse trade in quests. There are now four stable hands who will buy back<br>
                             specific colored bridles located in the stables in the Bazaar <br>
                             Being stunned will now stop players on horses. Not stopping them when stunned was<br>
                             causing warping and other bad things <br>
                             Knockback spells, and spells that throw you into the air, now affect people on horses<br>
                             properly <br>
                             Horses now levitate when their rider should. <br>
                             Fixed a bug that was causing the client to crash when attempting to follow someone<br>
                             while on a horse. /follow should also now work when the person you are following is on<br>
                             a horse <br>
<br>
                        Spells<br>
<br>
                             Wizard Familiar spell scrolls will now increase in purchase cost with the spell level <br>
                             Several spells will no longer be interrupted, spells such as the 'proc' generated by<br>
                             Instrument of Nife <br>
                             Several spells that were not functioning in the planes have been fixed and now work in<br>
                             the planes <br>
                             Bards should now gain singing skill when singing and should no longer gain skill in an<br>
                             instrument when they are not using one. <br>
                             Characters are no longer damaged by damage shields when using throwing weapons <br>
                             Atol's Spectral Shackles has had its casting difficulty reduced <br>
                             Made some changes to Nature's Recovery to make it more stackable <br>
<br>
                        Visual Issues<br>
<br>
                             Wolves and warders should no longer appear to be very small <br>
                             Characters no longer lose their hair or beard when their illusions wear off <br>
                             Weapons should now appear properly (sometimes they wouldn't show up at all) when a<br>
                             player zoned in <br>
                             Characters in wolf or bear form (or other races that aren't player races) should no<br>
                             longer have parts of them tinted based on the armor the player was wearing <br>
                             Bear form should now look correct to people that zoned in after the spell was cast on<br>
                             them <br>
                             May have fixed the problem with extra mouse cursor showing in game <br>
                             Fixed a problem with NPCs, PCs and some objects not being visible in some zones<br>
                             (Wakening Lands, Plane of Growth, Emerald Jungle and Swamp of No Hope) <br>
<br>
                        Performance Issues<br>
<br>
                             More work on reducing zone times for Luclin city zones <br>
                             &quot;Hitch&quot; created when player characters enter a zone should be gone now <br>
                             Fixed a bug that could cause the client to crash in some cases where a character tried<br>
                             to purchase an item from a vendor but didn't have enough money <br>
                             Characters with pets that zone (horses, familiars and warders) should now be able to<br>
                             zone from North Qeynos to Qeynos Hills <br>
<br>
                        New Features<br>
<br>
                             Holding shift while clicking the resolution in the options in game will reduce the<br>
                             resolution. If you are already in 640x480 though, this does nothing. Normal click<br>
                             increases the resolution as it always has and still wraps back to 640 after the highest<br>
                             resolution your machine supports. <br>
                             Using 1280x1024 and 1600x1200 resolutions, the /wincolor command, and getting the<br>
                             inventory window in fullview mode are now available to all EverQuest players (these<br>
                             features were restricted only to Velious owners) <br>
<br>
                        PvP<br>
<br>
                             It is no longer possible to bandage others of the opposing deity team on Sullon Zek <br>
<br>
                        Alternate Advancement Abilities<br>
<br>
                             Lowered the reuse time on Rampage AA ability from 15 minutes to 10 minutes <br>
                             Rampage is now fixed. Previously was only hitting one target <br>
                             Mass Group Buff button should work properly when zoning <br>
                             Casting Reinforcement should now work on all buffs cast, not just those cast on<br>
                             yourself <br>
                             The Discipline Duelist should now be doing the correct damage when using Chaotic<br>
                             Stab <br>
                             LifeBurn should now reset properly after being interrupted <br>
                             Dire Charm should now reset properly after being interrupted <br>
                             Fixed the Quick Buff ability to work as described <br>
                             Leech Touch should refresh properly now <br>
                             Exodus and Nexus Gate now have a casting time of 1/10th of a second<br>
