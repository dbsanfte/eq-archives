<br>
In order to enter the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Plane of Nightmare</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> Maze Hedge Quest</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, you have to be pre-flagged in <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Plane of Tranquility</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.  You have to speak with the NPC Adroha Jezith in the buildings surrounding <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Plane of Nightmare</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.  Adroha Jezith is located in the bulding near the ocean next to the build with the merchant.  Adroha Jezith is in the back room with 8  NPCs, 4 NPC are sitting with 4 in a coma in coupling.  Follow the following diologue to be pre-flagged.<br>
<br>
Adroha Jezith Loc (neg 200, neg 1400)<br>
<br>
-------------------------<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Adroha Jezith'<br>
<br>
Adroha gives a soft sigh of woe, 'You won't be getting any response from Thelin. Ever since his injury he has been in a deep [coma] with no sign of ever recovering.'<br>
Thelin tosses and turns violently on the floor, then is still.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Adroha Jezith'<br>
<br>
You say, 'what coma?'<br>
<br>
Adroha Jezith says 'My pity onto Thelin. His life on Norrath was a miserable one. As a young man he began to study the workings of fear inspired by Cazic-Thule. The workings had been translated for mortals by Zebuxoruk. Pouring over the texts, Thelin felt his mind being invaded by Cazic. This information was not for mortal usage and the malevolent god stripped him of all his earthly belongings and cursed him to live in [poverty and ruin].'<br>
<br>
You say, 'what about poverty and ruin?'<br>
<br>
Adroha Jezith says 'Aye, he lived in the streets of Eastern Freeport, begging from those passing through the port. He sat quivering, propped up against a wall with one hand out as he watched the travelers pass by. None of them even gave him a second glance. Several years would pass before a female dwarf would arrive to trade some of her family's armor and weapons. She saw and took pity on Thelin. She knelt down, scratched her beard then began to rummage through her backpack. She then placed a [jeweled dagger] in his hand, smiled and returned to her former business.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'what jeweled dagger?'<br>
<br>
Adroha Jezith says 'This was the only gift that Thelin had received since the curse. It was beautifully crafted and would likely have fetched a handsome price upon the market. He decided to keep the dagger as it was such a kind gesture. Later that eve, Thelin heard the calling of others that studied Zebuxoruk's workings. He recognized the language they called out in. He approached the men and explained he had studied the writings of Zebuxoruk. One of the shaded figures then began to mutter an incantation. Suddenly, there was a bright flash, lush vegetation and a peaceful breeze surrounded them. They had ascended here, to the [Plane of Tranquility] where they could further study the works without interference from the gods and mortals alike.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'what about the Plane of Tranquility?'<br>
<br>
Adroha Jezith says 'Thelin enjoyed it here. He assisted the other followers by using all his mana to open a portal to the Plane of Nightmares, the demi-plane ruled by the child of The Faceless, Terris-Thule. Spent from using all his energies, he went to bed early after his victory had been achieved in this task. As he laid in bed, he looked over the dagger that had been given to him by the female dwarf. He smiled at the new peace he had found here and began to fall asleep. Drifting away into the realm of dreams, his subconscious was assulted by the horrors of a nightmare. He tossed and turned from the visions that came before him. So bad did he writhe in his subconscious torment that he turned on the dagger. He was critically injured, and let out a wrenching scream. We found him and were able to heal his wound enough to keep him alive. However, he still lies in a deep coma seemingly [tortured by nightmares].'<br>
<br>
You say, 'how is he tortured by nightmares?'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>You have received a character flag!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Adroha Jezith tells you, 'It is our belief that Terris-Thule is punishing him for allowing entrance into her plane. She seems to have an exceedingly strong tie to him. Since her father has already punished him, she likely found that he was easily tormented by her own powers. Sometimes he talks while tossing and turning. We have taken note of everything he has said. He has said 'I accept your offer Terris-Thule', 'I must find the pieces', and 'It never ends'. You must help him. Go through the portal that he has helped to create. Try to find his planar projection in Terris' plane. Help him wake from this torment. Please, I beg you. I cannot stand to watch him suffer any longer.'<br>
<br>
-------------------------<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Finding the Hedge Quest</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The Maze Hedge is located across the lake in the <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Northeast</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> corner of the zone, <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/m3/ponightmare1.jpg">Plane of Nightmare Map</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.  Traveling to Hedge will require Levitation and possible See Invisible/Invisible.  It best to travel in a group or raid to the destination.  The nastiest mobs to avoid is the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Hobgoblins</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
-------------------------<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The important thing to remember is all 18 people(3 groups) must be extremely close together.  Only the Group leaders should do the following NPC interactions.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  The Maze quest is bugged so each of the 3 groups can be sent to 3 different mazes.  This is one of the annonying aspect of the maze quest which can severly delay the raid.  If the groups get seperated, you can either evac out or let the NPC in the maze die by not following it.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Thelin Poxbourne'<br>
<br>
Thelin Poxbourne tells you, 'Who is it? Are you.. really there? You are! Please I beg of you to help me escape from this horrid place. Terris Thule is holding me here, she delights in the nightmares she sends me. To further torture me, she has offered me a pact. She has said that if I can retrieve my [dagger], then I am free to go. She does this only because she knows that I cannot retrieve it on my own.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'what dagger'<br>
<br>
Thelin Poxbourne tells you, 'She has taken the only thing that has brought me any joy in my life. She took it and broke it into seven pieces. She placed them deep within the labyrinth of my nightmare. I must retrieve it, will you [help] me. Please I beg of your mercy.'<br>
<br>
<br>
You say, 'what help'<br>
<br>
Thelin Poxbourne tells you, 'I do not know who you are, but I am thankful that you have stumbled upon me. I can bring you into my dreamstate, but my powers are limited so I can only handle eighteen at once. Please when you are prepared have the leader of each of your band of adventurers tell me they are ready.'<br>
<br>
-------------------------<br>
<br>
The maze quest resembles a larger scale version of the POJ Execution Trials with up to 18 people.  The goals is to follow the NPC around the maze to gradually increasing mob encounters.  You start with 2 Mobs and gradually increase to  7 or 8 mobs.  Afterward, NPC will take you to a new room with Construct of Nightmares.  The Construct of Nightmares is slowable and hit for 800ish with lots of HPs.  In addition, there are 4 bats in the room in the corners which may agro.  <br>
<br>
After killing the Construct of Nightmares, you proceed to  hand the pieces into <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Thelin</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->spawning untargetable Terris Thule.  Terris Thule and  <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Thelin</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->  will argue about being tormented and ask to stop the tormenting.  Terris Thule gates or disappears. <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Thelin</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> gives a Thelin's Dagger.  <br>
<br>
Afterward, you hail <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Thelin</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.  <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>You have received a character flag!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
You will be ported out of the maze.<br>
