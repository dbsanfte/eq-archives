Doom... <br>
<br>
Frodo looked out across the barren landscape, the Ring heavy in his pocket.<br>
&quot;Oh, Sam, I'm so tired. We have travelled so far, and endured so much to<br>
come to this horrid place at last. But I cannot go on, I simply have not the<br>
strength to continue.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Enough of that, Mr. Frodo&quot;, Sam said, tears welling in his sad brown eyes.<br>
The six months of travel showed on Samwise Gamgee, and the strain of getting<br>
to this hellish point echoed still in his darkened countenance. His hood was<br>
drawn up against the hot wind blowing from the slopes of the infernal<br>
mountain. &quot;Mr. Elrond chose well, he did, when he held counsel. He saw<br>
through to your heart, and knew you would be strong, Mr. Frodo, and that's<br>
what you are. Come now, let's get moving. The faster we're done with this<br>
unpleasant business the faster we can get back to the Shire.&quot; Sam glanced<br>
uneasily at Gollum, still tressed in the elven rope, and scratching where it<br>
burned his skin. Gollum glared back at Sam, an unmistakeable hungry leer in<br>
his look.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, Samwise, it has been a long road, it's true. I do wish old Bilbo had<br>
never found this ring, and started us all on this perilous...what was that<br>
noise? Orcs?&quot;<br>
<br>
On the path ahead, a commotion arose. Cheers and ragged screams welled from<br>
what sounded like a hundred voices filled the chasms around Mt. Doom with an<br>
unholy cacophany. From the cave mouth just ahead, where the Fires of Mt.<br>
Doom burned forever, a giant Ogre came stumbling out, and trod to within<br>
inches of where Gollum, Samwise, and Frodo sat. The three shrank back<br>
against the cliff in fear, but the ogre took no notice of them. Instead, he<br>
raised his cudgel to the sky, and screamed in the full timbre of his ogrish<br>
voice, &quot;WOOT! Dark Lord PWNED!&quot;<br>
<br>
An answering call of a hundred voices echoed from without the cave, and many<br>
a shout of &quot;Woot!&quot; and &quot;Gratz!&quot; came, as more and more beings piled forth<br>
from the cave. Elves, Hobbits, Trolls, and Humans all came forth, slapping<br>
the ogre on the back and looking at a small black bag the ogre held in his<br>
other hand. &quot;PWNED!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Uhm, excuse me...&quot;, began Frodo.<br>
<br>
&quot;Eh?&quot; the ogre turned and looked at the halfing, noticing him for the first<br>
time. &quot;WTF are you doing here? Is that Mithril? Dude, WTF are you doing in<br>
this zone in Mithril? Go to Lothlorien, and get yourself a Galadriel Skin<br>
Tunic. It's like so much better than that crap you're wearing. Mithril,<br>
that's like, tradeskill stuff, right? Hey, Ubernutz, check this hobbit out,<br>
he's in this zone in fooking tradeskill crap!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Just a sec, Urofsuke,&quot; a half elf said from a little ways up the trail.<br>
&quot;I'm doing loot. Did you say tradeskill stuff? Hah, how lame!&quot;<br>
<br>
Frodo's head swam, with hunger and the heat. &quot;Yes, the tunic, it was forged<br>
by dwarves long ago, and was given to me by my Uncle...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're a twink?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, hmm. I was just wondering..ah, you see, I found this Ring, lost for<br>
centuries, and was sent on a quest from Rivendell to destroy...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're doing the fooking QUEST?! BWAH, hahahah, that's rich, dude, no one<br>
has the time to wait for that Gollum puke to spawn! Just come and kill TDL<br>
and get his hand, and do the turn in from there. WTF, I can't believe you<br>
waited for the fooking ring.&quot; Urofsuke peered down at the little hobbit, a<br>
look of distain across his broad face. &quot;Doesn't matter now, of course, we<br>
just pwned TDL and he won't be around for a while.&quot;<br>
<br>
Frodo blinked, confused by the ogre's words. &quot;TDL...?&quot;<br>
<br>
Urofsuke sighed, and took on a tone of voice usually reserved for small,<br>
ogrish children who had eaten a froglok right before their dinnertime. &quot;The<br>
Dark Lord, dude. The boss mob in this zone. We just killed him, so he won't<br>
be up for you to do the quest part with that ring.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But the council of Rivendell....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dude, let me tell you, Rivendell sucks. It's only good for tradeskills.<br>
Only reason to go to that zone is to pharm crowns from Elrond. Nice crown,<br>
but it's his rare. He usually just drops a no drop phial, heals damage from<br>
Mordor Blades. Like anyone uses one of those POS things.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Pharm...crowns?&quot; Frodo's vision blurred, and he swayed backwards,<br>
momentarily losing his footing. He knocked against Gollum, who let out a<br>
yelp and scampered further back against the cliff.<br>
<br>
&quot;Holy fook, it's Gollum!&quot; and without another word, Urofsuke smashed Gollum<br>
with a mighty blow from his cudgel, and killed the poor, pathetic creature<br>
outright. Gollum let out a small squeal, then lay still, pressed against the<br>
elven cord. &quot;Hahahah! Fooking Greenie mob! I love those!&quot;, and the ogre<br>
walked up and took a heretofore unseen bag from Gollum's back. &quot;Woot!<br>
Gollum's satchel! This'll bring me a couple kpp! Uh, dude, there's another<br>
ring on the corpse, it's no drop, and not lore, if you want it...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Now see here, Gollum was with us!&quot; Samwise began, momentarily overcoming<br>
his bewilderment and fear to approach the towering ogre. &quot;We were taking him<br>
to...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Can't claim an outdoor mob, dude. Gollum's FFA. If you didn't attack him,<br>
he's not your mob. Sorry, them's the rules.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Urofsuke, my alt just reported Smaug up in Gondor, dude, let's go!&quot;<br>
Ubernutz had finished handing around what appeared to be a darkened sword<br>
and crown. &quot;We're porting out from here, you in?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, I&quot;m coming. Well, nice talking to you guys. We're porting to Gondor,<br>
you guys need a lift?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We have walked for many months to come to this place...&quot; Frodo began again,<br>
trying to regain some measure of control over the situation.<br>
<br>
&quot;You WALKED? In MITHRIL? To MOUNT DOOM? Dude, there's a port in at Minas<br>
Morgul! WTF ever, okay? I'm outta here.&quot; And with that, a shimmering light<br>
surrounded the ogre, and a whooshing sound heralded his disappearance, and<br>
the disappearance of the other hundred or so souls that had gathered on that<br>
desolate trail, leaving Samwise and Frodo alone, once again, with only the<br>
bleeding corpse of Gollum for company. The one ring of power gleamed dully<br>
in Frodo's hand, and seemed, for a long while, to be just a bit heavier than<br>
it had been. <br>
