<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
<br>
The sun was setting by the time he finished his day, climbing out of the water he took a deep breath of the fresh air. He hoped there would be something warm to eat waiting for him at home. He smiled at the thought of Ashley cooking and Miles trying to help. As he turned a corner there stood a man dressed in dark robes, normally this wouldn't have bothered Zibik...but the sneer on his face...something about it sent chills down his back. Moving past the man he heard a soft voice say <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;Beware...evil lurks&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Turning back to where the man was he saw nothing. With eyes wide he turned around and started home quickly.<br>
<br>
When he arrived home he found no one there. Raising an eyebrow at this he walked to the fireplace he found it cold. &quot;Ok...where is everybody?&quot; Turning he frowned and looked around his tiny home. Sighing softly he started for the window. Slipping out of the window he came face to face with the same dark robed man from earlier. &quot;Why hello there&quot; there man said with that same sneer. Zibik turned and started off but the man called after him &quot;Little one...I know where your friends have gone...&quot; He chuckled softly as Zibik turned back to him? &quot;Tell me please?&quot; Zibik asked &quot;Where are my friends?&quot; The man laced his fingers in front of him and took on a pouty expression. &quot;And if I choose not to tell you what will you do?&quot; Zibik Tilted his head at the man.&quot;I guess I would just walk away&quot; The man looked a bit shocked &quot;This coming from the one who slew the great Xatt? Funny I expected you to be more menacing and a bit more threatening* The name struck him like a blow. &quot;Xatt? My little brother?&quot; He Looked up at the man. &quot;How do you know about my brother?&quot; The mans eyes lit up when Zibik asked &quot;ah I have stuck a cord in you then..good gather all the rage you have...you will need it&quot; Zibik blinked &quot;what do you mean?&quot; The man laughed again &quot;go around behind the house and you will see...&quot;The man faded into nothingness cackling. <br>
<br>
Zibik ran around the house fearful of what the man might mean. Skidding to a stop he saw what he feared...Standing in the alleyway was a group of darkly robed and armored men. One of the men had Ashley over his shoulder and another was throwing a dagger at the wall...But as Zibik turned to look at the wall his stomach turned. Miles was nailed to the wall and bleeding from several deep cuts. Zibik ran at them drawing his blades. One of the armored men Kicked him squarely in the chest and sent him across the alleyway to another wall. Groaning softly he rose to his feet, rage taking over him. One of the robed men motioned at him quickly and he suddenly couldn't move his legs. Struggling against the invisible bonds that bound him, he screamed at the men but the words were garbled and lost there meaning as they passed his mouth. The armored man holding the form of Ashley smirked at him and stepped into the shadows..disappearing and taking her form with him and leaving Zibik with nothing but an echo of a scream from Ashley. The rest of the men began to chant rapidly raising there hands to the sky and cutting themselves with small silvered blades. Slowly the earth at there feet began to move, shifting and sliding away. Slowly forms of dead beings began to emerge from it. Zombies Ghouls and Ghosts...he'd heard the stories but had never seen them..Seems the legends he'd heard were about to be the last thing he'd ever see. Slowly the monsters began to close in on him...there hisses and wails haunting him. A voice rang in his head suddenly <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;They Fear you because you are not afraid, run now and live to fight them for hopes sake.&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Suddenly his feet were free but as he turned to run a knife slid deeply into his gut. Screeching he ran blindly taking turns quickly to get away from them. Soon he looked back to see how far they were behind him. As he turned back he plowed into an armored dwarf who'd been talking to a group of people who were laughing. In broken breaths he said &quot;help me&quot; and collapsed to the ground. The dwarf turned slowly and looked behind him as the monsters turned the corner. &quot;What in the hell?&quot; The Dwarf roared and charged at the monsters, followed by a tall figure in a dark green robe and an elf dressed in mismatched blue and green plate armor. As the green robed figure ran the hood from his robe slipped back and his head shown. The face of an Iksar was all Zibik saw before things went out of focus for a second, then as his focus shifted back an elven lady and a man dressed in clerical plate armor were standing over him tending to him. He couldn't place the ladies face but he knew he'd seen her before, everything went black as a roar from the dwarf sounded.<br>
