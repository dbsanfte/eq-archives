Pillars of smooth glass encircled the vast chamber. In the center a porous well shimmered with the wrath of ages yore. Inside was not sparkling water, but a deeply forgotten magic. Its power was torn, spilling back and forth upon the crest of magical waves almost escaping this well of magic. The pulsating emerald colors spat forth reflecting off the columns creating a green hue to be cast in every direction of the temple. Symbols graced the outer shell of the protecting ring. The words emblazed with chisels into the stone told of ages past and the livelihood held upon the crests of mankind.<br>
<br>
             Before the ring of enchanted fire stood a lone figure clothed in an intricate black robe. It flowed across the length of his body hiding the skin from the torment of light. Embroidered upon the green silken sleeves were exquisite spiraled designs of creatures long dead. Upon the right sleeve lay on the underside a phoenix rising from the ashes. The sun shimmered around its body as its rose above its former form in a spirit of rebirth. Upon the left sleeve an Ent stood proud. Its timeless oaken form stood still showing the spirit of the everlasting, the ever formed, and the ever spoken knowledge that can only come from one that lives from the beginning of time to the end of existence itself. At the base of his robe shimmered his golden boots, woven out of golden leather it was worth more than any kingdom, and was unique in its glory. His hands stood empty except for a small black rock that was physically grafted the palm of his nearly trembling fist. The hand seemed to emit a small fiery glow inside, exposing the potence of the prize underneath. <br>
<br>
              But you may ask who was this man, what deemed his extravagant possessions. In a time of the unjust and the cruel why did he stand against the waves of humanities worst? Because he cared then as I care now. For you see, it was not always this way; life was not always so subtle for him, not so easy. In the darkest days of human experience we must seek out the humbleness of our own humanity. Sometimes we falter, sometimes we fail, but we must keep trying despite all odds. What I lay out to you now is his story. One of justice, one of repentance, of sorrow, joy, doubt, and most importantly about the nature of existence and of love.<br>
<br>
	He was born into a wayward existence, conceived in a small village outside the great city of Minus-Jetral. However from a very early age it was noticed he was not an ordinary child, but something not seen in thousands of years. He was a wizard. After scores of years he learned to keep this secret from everyone except his parents. If it were found out what he was then he would be executed on sight out of fear. The insufferable fear of the weak against something different. Something special. Eventually he became a man mastering his talents from a stranger he had met one day in the marketplace. His parents never knew of this man, he was a secret to all, but suffice to say he was taught in the ways of the arcane. On his eighteenth year of existence trouble arose in the town. A quarrel among families raged by the shoreline. Everyone went of course to see the spectacle, something interesting even though at its heart unwholesome. The whole town turned out on that fateful day. A disobedient war raged upon the docks and sand. Men danced through the blood of their already fallen foes and across the stained sand. Twisting in to see the battle he pushed those aside that were standing in front of him felling them to either side. At the forefront the bloody mess unfolded itself as a great anxiety of human emotion. So pitiful were they that most had probably forgotten why the feud had started, and all built up whatever pitiful excuse they once had to start this into a reason to shed blood.<br>
	<br>
	This young man stood shaking his head from side to side as people nudged closer with wild eyes, just to see death happen before them, before the constables showed up. "Enough!" he screamed at the top of his lungs, however no one paid him heed. All this managed to do was get him angry. What a poor choice he had made that day, or perhaps it was wise, everything afterwards seems to revolve around this one moment in time. His life was changed, she would not have been brought into his life, and he most certainly would not be self aware of himself. But it did happen that day there shall be no tears to waste on the impetuance of youth, so much should have stopped him, but alas the story shall be continued.<br>
	<br>
	A cold rage passed over him. The inferno of a blue flame scorched outwards from his eyes as people took notice and backed away from him. Eyes emblazed with pure anger, the fire and the ice mixed themselves in his soul and was released all at once, in a moment of youthful foolishness. Arms turned palms upwards as claps of thunder scorched the sky. And then it came, out of the ether of his soul, the wizard's fire. It was foretold in legend that if wizards fire touched the skin it would continue to burn through everything, every sinew of flesh, every bone to turn to dust, every muscle destroyed. Those were the legends, but alas they were not right, for this particular wizard it was worse than anything they could ever imagine. Uncontrolled balls of swirling flame, lightning, and ice spat forcefully forward. Each strand of magic intertwined with each other in a malevolent continuity. The sky around him crackled with magic as two bolts surged forth one after the other. The first sailed forth removing the oxygen from the air around it as it fed its enchanted flame sailing over the heads of the now silent warriors down below. It crashed into a trade boat directly off the dock anchored to the port. The flame broke through the hull and exploded. Bursts of it surged out of the boat spilling out into the sky, only to shower everything in a ten-foot radius with the flame that would not die. The dock caught on fire and burned as surly as the boat had already combusted into an uncontrolled fury. The surrounding people on the docks were hit with its fury unable to control themselves as it burned through their flesh eating away at the their skin, many of them would die slowly that day, if they were lucky enough to have been hit on something major they would die quickly. Their weapons and armor melted letting the rage go through the cold steel until it could reach the inner sanctum inside, of the very appealing flesh. The flame that spilt onto the water sat atop the water burning as though it had landed atop an oil spill harvesting instead on the intensity of its creator, it burned and evaporated water as it sat flaming.<br>
<br>
	Upon the first explosion the crowd turned and ran. Fright had taken their souls by force; they did not know that such things could even exist. Panic and fear raced into every heart as they ran anywhere, and everywhere, anywhere but here. The second bolt crackled with energy as he sent it directly at the sand in front of him where the heart of the battle was taking place. At that moment judgment was laid down upon all of them, those he deemed wicked and evil. Like the one before, this ball of flame surged into the ground. Many people were consumed directly in the flames being tossed aside in the shortest agony of their life. They were dead before they hit the ground, but nothing would be left of them for anyone tell their ashen remains apart. More of the fire exploded outwards showering all nearby with the cruel torment inside. The battle ceased all together as families tore away to escape the more deadly aspect of this ethereal fire. He turned a half twist to his side looking around. Someone was driving at him with a pike. If he had only not, but no use his fate could not be changed. This foolish man as he carried forth was tossed backwards a hundred feet, he was later found with a six-inch hole in his chest frozen to the touch. It was also said that remnants of an icicle were found still melting deep within his chest covering his front with water.<br>
<br>
	He began to walk off with his eyes still burning in an unholy rage. Finally the constables came, with looks of malformed anger and fear upon their faces. But he paid them no heed and just kept on walking. The horses bucked and shrank back, for they, unlike their riders were not stupid. They felt a force without form creeping closer and closer with his every step. The mares hair stood on end, their legs began to tremble. Shouts arose amongst their party as he drew closer. What did they have to fear from this young boy? Well it seemed everything, as the light from his eyes grew ever more intense the flames continued to crackle in intensity. Many horses bolted with their riders holding on for dear life. Some turned around on their own accord. The captain and his most adamant dared to stay. "Halt!" He shouted. Fool, did not even understand. But then again how could he how could he deal with such a creature of magic? He was like a babe lost from his mothers clasping arms. No more solitude for you, no more warm, just a fiery embrace. His eyes blanched at the gritted teeth of the man coming closer to him. At that moment he must have reconsidered his foolish choice, it could be seen in his eyes as they tell all. His men and horses did part way for that man that day. Of those that remained and survived they had been able to get medical attention from the soothsayers and healers of the town. But their god did not help them this day as they were chaotically flung into the air. All they were to him was a sandcastle. Well formed in ideals but in practice they came to close to the water, and he had washed them under with an undercurrent greater than they could imagine. There was no sandcastle left after he passed through.<br>
<br>
	The village roused into an uproar, but he paid them no heed for he was already long gone. That night he knew he would never be able to live as one of them again. His things collected and his goodbyes made he began his trek along the mountains to somewhere where he might be safe as himself again. Before he left he saw his mentor again and was given a book. More of a journal of sorts. But that was the only thing that passed between them, not even a word. When passing the book over that night he noticed a red illumination coming from within. Something new that he did not notice before, those hands never came out of his tunic before now. With that he turned and vanished, and was gone.<br>
<br>
	The days went on through the woods and mountains. He would slowly make his way in any particular direction, at night by the fire he would read out of the journal. It held many secrets and one surprise in particular above all the rest. Upon the first page there was an inscription in golden thread woven into the book. <br>
<center><br>
What is golden is not always wealth<br>
What is lovely is not always right<br>
What you believe is not always so<br>
Always trust to your own reason<br>
Because everything inside is cold truth<br>
For I have lived it, and so shall you<br>
</center><br>
	At this you must surely see now that I the narrator is one in all with both of these men. But I am not either of them, on of my past one of my future. I was once the young man, and one day I will be his mentor. Now you may ask, but how is that possible? I will let the journal I found speak for itself; it had no dates, no times. Just paragraphs that started and stopped with pictures along the way.<br>
<br>
	"My friend, and truly you are my friend. I have traveled the world over in search of knowledge. I, we, us have created an interesting paradox. I know my past, which is your future; you have so much potential and yet have not realized it. So much idealized notions yet to be revealed. I cannot tell you everything that you must do for that would create far worse than what we have already done. I will not speak of time, except that I have learned to traverse it, as sure as you will discover one day. I cannot tell you of the future except that it will be hard on you. We are a singular being out of creation. Thousands of years ago our true race, the wizards, died out. Yes we are a race unto ourselves. There was a time that man lived in harmony with magic, and with creatures beyond imagination. We were a type of these creatures, the embodiment of the pure majesty of the creator's magic. Alas one day a war fell upon our land. Lives were lost but magic almost died. The people grew fearful of the old ways, they decided that life had no room for us anymore, and that magic was evil and perverted.<br>
<br>
	However let me assure you that it was not. But many of the great wizards and sorcerers of our time were eliminated in calculated strikes by the kings. But of course there was a bloody strife back and forth. The elimination of magic was not something they could stand, so there was retaliation. Kingdoms crumbled under the weight of the power of our brethren. But you must realize, we are not even the same as they once were. We are the embodiment of what once was. We are the breath of magic back in a world full of forgotten promises. The blood ran across the grounds. Tried as they might our kind lost. With the battles coming knowledge was stored away in a keep. None may enter this except a wizard, for they will not be able to sense the magical traps lay out along the way. It in the old tongue it was called Kitra Uth 'Kanul, which now I could only approximate be Keep of the Phoenix. In there is the knowledge of all of our brethren in the past. It lies in a pool of shimmering emerald ether. The liquid is the knowledge itself."<br>
<br>
	I scanned through the next few sections, more stories on the past, more knowledge lost and forgotten. Words that would help me pass some traps, spells inscribed within that would help me along the way. I scoured every last word like it was my lifeblood. Indeed it was for quite a while. It sustained me with knowledge. Later it tells me where I might find a relic left for me, some sort of robe. One long forgotten that would be held in the keep that I must acquire above all else. The oldest of all robes, the one of the first Wizard amongst the world, now that I was the only one it was to be mine. It would fight me to take control of it, but once I had it would be my lifelong companion.<br>
<br>
	Days and weeks went by as I traversed the landscape. Wearily I approached a small town by the name of Termin. Termin although not totally unlike my homeland had a Dain in the nearby city of Kemalin. If I remember my studies correctly he was kindly to his people and did not exploit them. It was nearby no seawater so my knowledge of fishing and sea fare would do me little good here. Here I hoped to gain sanctuary. I had lost track of how many miles that I must have walked, but I know it had numbered a great deal, I passed by many other towns to make sure I would not be bothered by ghosts of my past life I must start this one fresh and new. Slowly I strode into town, not knowing what they would have of me. Many scrutinizing faces greeted me as they looked upon me with no fear like my hometown, but with interest as per who this strange new person was, and what his business was. I didn't know what to answer their gazes with so I carried on with life as life had always been for me. I did not know when I could continue my art of spellcraft, certainly I did not want to be taken away from this town as well that I hoped to settle into. Finally someone came up to me while I was proceeding to the nearest inn looking for a place to stay.<br>
<br>
	"What are ye doin' here mista, yer a bit wee to be out on yer own." Said a short man about two thirds of my height. He wore a decent shirt with brown pants stained by the constant toils of his labors.  I could tell that he worked for a living but he at least had a little bit of money to keep to himself in a decent station in life. My eyes trailed down upon his smooth black hair tumbled back into a greasy mess. It was clear that he was the type that would swindle a man form his purse if it were able. I would have to be careful around this one indeed. "Wer none to fond of outsiders in dees parts mista, you may not find us overjoyed wid yer presence." Well I suppose there would be all types along the way that I would have to meet and this was just another one of the small tests that would come upon me as per my resolve. Can't stay away from people forever. At that moment I broke the silence I had held since the last town, it was time to reach out once again. <br>
