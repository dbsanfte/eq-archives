Ignite the vision that brought cold wind against my childhood soul. The root of unspoken fear grows deep in my heart. A dark cold sound tears at my life. Over and Over… The time when rest is as distant as childhood. When I knew peace The time when I was happy. The time when I knew peace. Before it came after me.<br>

<br>
“Hey Zib Catch” the sound of a leather smack resounds off the walls of the mountain side as a young gnome catches a ball in his hands. “Good throw Xatt!” Zibik turns and tosses the ball towards a third gnome. “heads up Lash” the gnome raises his hand and catches the ball easily. “Hey what happened to fair warning?” Lash smirked and tossed it back to Xatt. The ball sails over Xatt’s head and rolled off and down the path a bit. “Hey no fair Lash, too high!” Zibik chuckled and sat down as Xatt ran after the ball. The young gnome called Lash moved over and sat next to Zibik. “Do you think he will take the magic test tomorrow Zib?” Zibik shrugged “I don’t know Lash…he seems to have mixed feelings…”  Lash just Nodded. “What about you Zib? They say the magic runs deep in your blood…&quot; Zibik chuckled softly “Lash I’m not cut out for magic, I’m thinking I’ll probably go out for the Gemchoppers… “ Lash smirked “you a fighter?” Ha….that’ll be the day…you know very well that you and I are cut from the same cloth…and its as Thick as Thieves…” Zibik just shook his head with a small chuckle.<br>
<br>
 “Hey guys I found it…” Xatt ran back towards the two as swift as his little legs could carry him. As he drew closer to  them a sound trumpeted off the walls. Zibik rose a fearful look on his face “Oh no the Minotaur has broken free” Lash Chuckled “I don’t think he’ll get this close Zibik, he hasn’t before” Zibik Blinked and looked between his two playmates “maybe we should head back to the city…” Xatt laughed “You big scaredy gnome. I bet your scared of the dark too aren’t you. Smirking mischeviously Xatt poked his brother in the ribs “The Minotaur is just a myth made up to scare young gnomes into not straying too far from town.” Zibik shrugged a bit “well it seems to work well. Come on…I don’t want the city partrol mad at us.” <br>
<br>
Lash and Xatt nodded and turned to follow Zibik back. Just then there was a loud snort and roar sounds behind them. The three young gnomes turned back to see a large minotaur running towards them at full speed. They all let out a shriek and start to run for the guard.  Lash and Zibik run as fast as they could with Xatt falling more and more behind them. The Minotaur catches Xatt by the Shirt collar and tosses him away with his great strength. When Zibik and Lash made it to the guard and turned back to see about Xatt. The young gnomes’  eyes go wide in fear when they see their friend in a heap with the Minotaur still charging for them. Then in a flash of magical light appears around the Minotaur shrieks in pain and runs the other way back into the waiting arms of a large skeleton. The skeleton, along with the help of a wood elf and barbarian quickly dispatch the Minotaur. Zibik and Lash rush to Xatt’s side but skid to a stop when a man in black robes leans down to see about their young friend. He shakes his head and motions for another elf dressed in a suit of hardened plate armor. The elf nods and begins to gather a blue light around her as she says a prayer to the gods. An energy of healing surrounds Xatt and he coughs as he regains conciousness. Xatt looks up at the man with wide eyes and blinks at the black robes, jumping up running towards his friends. The Man just smiles a bit and shakes his head and walks back to his compainions, the skeleton following close behind. <br>
<br>
Xatt watches the man and his pet walk away with wide eyes as Zibik Grabs his shoulder “Come on little brother lets go home.”  Xat blinks and nods “Hey Zib…was…was that a necromancer?” Zibik blinked and looked back the way the man had gone “From what the elders have spoken…probably” Xatt blinks and smiles. Zibik raises a brow and looks over at Lash as they head for home, Lash just shrugs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
“Get that staff up boy” the gnome warrior says “If you let your guard down you let the enemy in.” Zibik raises the staff and blocks the warriors blow but doesn’t see his foot sweeping in and lands on his back. The warrior shakes his head and sighs “Zbik you have the courage to fight but your defenses are too open. We have been working for days on this…and I’m not seeing any improvement.”  Zibik blinks “but I want to learn I want to help defend the city…I…I “ The warrior raises his hand “Zibik I know..but your not cut out to be a warrior, perhaps you should go speak with the headmaster in the library…everyone knows the magic runs thick in your blood” Zibik shakes his head “NO I don’t want to be a mage…” He turns quickly and runs from the sparring site, the warrior calling after him as he ran. He ran into the city and didn’t stop until he had reached the abbey where he skidded to a stop at the top of the stairs and sat down over looking the water and tried to choke back the tears that welled up.<br>
<br>
A puff of wind next to his ear and a splash into the water below causes him to jump up and turn around. A gnome stands there twirling a something in his hand with a myschevious smirk on his face. The gnome raises his hand and launches a peeble at Zibik which Zibik catches it before it hits him. The man Chuckles “You caught it….very good…” Before Zibik could respond he launches two more at him. Zibik’s eyes go wide and he barely catches one in each hand before they hit him. “You you…tossed rock at me?? Why…? The gnome chuckles softly “To test you…your not a warrior Zibik of the Quickfingers clan…you’re one of us...” He Grins and jumps a bit, Zibik just raises a brow. “ One of who?&quot;  The old gnome stops and peers at Zibik, then points to the abbey next to him “One of us boy…the secret defenders of Akanon” Zibik blinks “Secret defenders?” The old man Cackles and motions for him to follow, still a bit curious Zibik follows.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Over the next few years Zibik moves out of his home, leaving his mother and little brother and takes up residence in the abbey with the old gnome. He fell into the teachings easier than he could have ever thought. Never did he imagine how easy it would be to do something such as what he learned. The old man did well in masking the true nature of what they were, hiding the early skills Zibik would need in games of memorization and chance. His weaponry training masked as a simple spear and shield. But time flows like a river…and all good things must come to an end. Zibik’s younger brother Xatt had joined the necromancers guild unbeknownst to Zibik. His best friend Lash had been kicked out of the gemchoppers for being drunk on duty and had become a simple mechanic.  <br>
<br>
Zibik’s Master found him sitting on top of a hill one day in the hill near the edge of  his homeland, Zibik was watching a group of Kobold set up there camp for the night. The Old gnome peered over Zibik’s shoulder and smiled. “You know you cant let them stay there…so close to the city…” Zibik nodded and sighed “Yes I know….” He rose slowly and picked up the spear and shield. His Master shook his head “Young Quickfingers it is time you put away childish things….” He motions to the spear and shield, Zibik just giving him a curious look. The Old one Smirked at him and took the spear and shield from Zibik and replaces them with a pair of daggers. “I Know you have been working with 2 small pieces of pipe Zibik…now lets see how much good your practice has done you…”  Zibik walked down the hill slowly, and up behind the first of four Kobolds. The dagger bit into the beasts back deeply and with barely a sound the young gnome stepped from his first kill to the second. This one didn’t go down as quietly though and with a shriek the other 2 Kobolds came at Zibik. After a few seconds the other 2 lay dead at his feet and Zibik staring blankly at what he had done. <br>
<br>
The old Gnome bounced down the hill and clapped him on the back. “You did well my boy, they barely knew what had hit them” grinning the old man slipped a ring on Zibik’s finger and touched his shoulder. “You are now a full fledged thief for the Gnomish Rogues guild” Zibik’s eyes went wide in shock as it finally dawned on him. All those lessons about moving without being seen or heard, the lessons about how to lift a bag of coin without it making a sound, but most of all the lessons about the the backs of your opponents being the most important place for him. He drops the daggers and stumbles back away from the man and the carnage. Turning he ran back to the city and to his home, bursting through the door he ran to his old room and flopped himself down on his bed. After a few hours of crying, his mother gently knocked on the door and bid him welcome home and let him know there was food in the kitchen if he was hungry.<br>
<br>
&quot;Zibik you need to get out of the house and find a job, Now&quot; His mother had said. So he had decided to apply for a mechanics position with Lash. His manual dexterity and quick hands made him a natural when it came to working with machinery. Everything seemed to be back to normal, Lash and Zibik spent many evenings playing cards or fishing. Zibik had even found a young lady and had begun to court her. He had packed away his weapons and armor promising himself that he would never use them again. His brother continued his study of the dark arts, but when Zibik asked him of his path he mearly said he was studying the &quot;True art&quot; and would walk away. Many days past and Zibik's life seemed right to him but something was missing. though he couldnt ever put his finger on it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lash Hand me sprocket will ya?&quot; Zibik was under a large Clockwork spider repairing the damage that some unknown assailent  had done. &quot;Here ya go Zib,&quot; Lash handed it to him and smiled. &quot;So how are things going with you and the lady?&quot; Zibik stops and smiles. &quot;Honostly...I haven't a clue what to make of her these days. I mean We're in love but I cant seem to figure out how to keep her happy. One minute she wants to get married the next she wont even speak to me.&quot; He shrugs his shoulders &quot;I don't know Lash...Women are strange&quot; Lash laughs &quot;your just now figuring that one out?&quot; Zibik opens his mouth to reply but the sounds of running feet resound through the workbay, Zibik raises a brow and slides out from under the spider as a young gnome runs towards him. &quot;Zibik. come quick its your mother!&quot; He says, Zibik's eyes go wide &quot;What do you mean?&quot; The Gnome Just Motions for him to follow and takes off in a run. <br>
<br>
Bursting through the door of his mothers Bedroom, Zibik's eyes go wide as he sees his mother lying on her bed, blood covering her simple garmets. &quot;Mother what happened?&quot; His mothers eyes open slowly and she looks at him. &quot;It was Xatt, Zibik...&quot; Her voice soft and raspy &quot;He's gone mad...I never  told you...but after you left for the abby...he joined the dark reflections..&quot; She coughed and took a ragged breath. &quot;I'm dying Zibik...My Son, My husbands prodigy...&quot; She takes a deep breath and closes her eyes You must follow in your father's footsteps Zibby...become a great Treasure Hunter...even if it means..... you must..... become what..... you hate....&quot; She took a deep breath and her head fell forward as her spirit left her body. Zibik Screamed with tears in his eyes as he lunged forward to hug her&quot; No Mom dont die, please&quot; Tears Ran down his face as sat and held his mother. He Opened his eyes, a haze clouded his mind as he rose and closed his mothers eyes and kissed her forehead. Walking out of the room, he starts for him room but is stopped by 2 of the cities guards. &quot;Zibik Quickfingers, you are hereby charged with the murder of your mother and will be taken into custody until your hearing before the elders.&quot; Zibik just blinked and tried to understand what they had just said. The Guards, two of his childhood friends bind his hands and lead him away.<br>
<br>
He awoke in a small cell, his eyes traveling the small room wondering where he was and how he had gotten there. &quot;Awake are we?&quot; His eyes fall on a gnome in a black robe, his brother. Zibik sits up slowly and looks at him. &quot;Xatt...what? why? how?&quot; His little brother smiled menacingly. &quot;How could you kill her Zibik...she was your mother?&quot; Zibik's eyes went wide &quot;Me? I didnt&quot; Everything came back to him. He snarled and was at the bars grasping for his brothers neck &quot;I didnt, but you did, you little Bastard....&quot; Xatt just laughed &quot;Oh but Zibik how could I have done it...I was away in High Hold Keep on business for the City&quot;<br>
Xatt turns and walks away, but turns back at the doorway &quot; the court has reached a verdict...you will be given a chance to defend yourself...in the arena...against your only other family...&quot; Smirking Xatt exits and slams the door behind him.<br>
<br>
Zibik sat in his small cell, for so long he lost track of time, sometimes crying, sometimes sitting in a daze as his mind tried to sift through what had happened to him. The Guards came by to tell him another charge had been added to his list..the murder of his fiancee...but this barely registered, he already knew who had done it, he just had no way to prove it. He was finally snapped back into reality as the door to his cell was opened and Lash stepped into it. &quot;How could you do it Zibik? How Could you kill her?&quot; Zibik blinked. &quot;Lash...I didnt...you were with me all day...working on the spider...how could I have done it?&quot; Lash shook his head. &quot; I dont know what your talking about Zibik I was in the meadow all day that day...working on the other clockwork spider...&quot; Zibik blinked again. &quot;No...Lash...dont do this to me...&quot; Lash just shook his head&quot; I am not doing anything to you Zibik...Xatt will do that for me..&quot; Lash Reached out of the cell and tossed a backpack to Zibik. &quot;Better prepare yourself, otherwise you wont have a chance against your brother...&quot; He turned and walked out, closing the door behind him. Inside the pack was his old leather armor and a pair of daggers, but these were not the daggers he'd put away with the armor. These were different. Zibik just shook his head and began to put on the armor slowly, his mind going over what he'd learned all those years ago from the old one. He dropped the bag on the ground but raised a brow when he heard a metal &quot;clink&quot; as it hit the ground. In the bottom of the bag was an old book, the writing on it was that of a thief sigil. He opens the book and discoveres it to be his fathers old journal. intreigued he beings to read of what his father wrote. Accounts of battles fought, creatures slain and places visited all penned by a father he'd never known. Zibik Smiles a bit. &quot;This is what it means to be an adventurer...&quot; He nods and turns to the last page expecting a good bye to his family, but finds only a set of lines...<br>
<br>
What is to gain from my selfishness?<br>
What will I promote, and what will be pushed back?<br>
My hope must rise, strength come forward, as I link my hand in<br>
I wont let it happen, this weakness will be strengthened<br>
Take away this battle, let our fire burn within<br>
Purify<br>
Purify<br>
Dont release your hand from me<br>
I must surrender my hate, I must lay it down<br>
Let your chains uphold me<br>
I wont break the bond<br>
But no more will I remain the same<br>
<br>
this is my resistance and my hope<br>
<br>
Zibik blinks as something in the back of his mind clicks, his mind becomes clear and all his fears seem to slip away.<br>
The door to his cell opens and the guards motion for him to follow. Slowly he sets the book down and makes his way out of the cell, following the guards to the place of his judgement.<br>
<br>
The guards lead him down to the falls and the water wheel. His brother and Lash stand side by side waiting. Zibik closes his eyes and takes a deep breath before speaking. &quot;I am here brother...let us start this&quot; Xatt grins evilly. &quot;So eager to die are we brother? I have something to show you...&quot;  With a wave of his hand a skeleton walks out from behind a machine. &quot;Say hello to your beloved Zibik...She has served me well as a mindless pet&quot; With a gleeful cackle he points a crooked finger at Zibik. &quot;you have been judged by the elders...and it is time for your sentence to be carried out. Prepare to die Zibik Quickfingers&quot; The skeleton that was Zibik's fiancee ran forward with a blade in hand.<br>
<br>
Zibik opens his eyes slowly and drew his small daggers from his belt. a voice in the back of his head speaks to him &quot;use the hope and it will guide you...&quot; He tightens his grip on his daggers as his beloved swings in on him, raising his blade he parries the strike and returns the strike with one of his own, but the attack falters because the skeleton has no flesh. The skeleton swings the blade back up and catches zibik across shoulders, drawing a deep line of blood. He turns driving the dagger deep into the skull. The Skeleton Shrieks and collapses into a pile. &quot;I am sorry love....&quot; Slowly he steps forward towards his brother. &quot;Another sin to add to your list...&quot; Xatt's eyes go wide and he steps back beginning a chant. Zibik unwavering walks forward slowly. He shivers as a blast of magical energy hits him and he feels his strength drain away. Xatt Cackles and Zibik clenches his teeth and keeps walking. <br>
<br>
&quot;What is to gain from my selfishness?&quot; Xatt blinks and looks at Zibik as he speaks &quot;What will I promote, and what will be pushed back?&quot; Xatt starts drawing energy for another spell &quot;My hope must rise, strength come forward, as I link my hand in.<br>
I wont let it happen, this weakness will be strengthened.&quot; As Zibik speaks the last word Xatt claps his hands together finishing fear spell, to keep his brother away from him. The spell washes over Zibik and he almost turns and flees but the poem in his mind keeps him on his path. The last few steps area at a run as he flips one of his blades end over end at his brother. Xatt Dodges the incoming blade, but leaves himself fully open for Zibik's Blade to slip into his back. Xatt's head turns as he looks into his brothers eyes. &quot;Xatt...Save yourself From Hell...&quot; Zibik pulls his blade from his brother and turns as Lash Slips a sword into his gut. Slowly Zibik looks down then up at Lash. The dagger in his hand reacts before Zibik even thinks, its razor edge sliding across Lashes throat and taking his head off with the rage that had built up in Zibik. As Lash's body falls away from him. Zibik falls to his knees and looks at  the sword. &quot;Why me...why did this have to happen to me...what did I do?&quot; Tears begin to stream down his face as he pulls the sword from his stomach. &quot;Why couldnt I have lived my life as a normal person?&quot; he falls forward as things being to go dark.<br>
<br>
He awoke days later in a bed, a bandage around his torso.  &quot;Where am I?&quot; The Old gnome looks up and smiles &quot;Welcome back young one.&quot; Zibik blinks &quot;I should be dead...the sword...?&quot; The old man smiles &quot; You almost did...we found you in time...and a cleric was summoned to heal you before you passed on...As for your supposed trial...It never went to the elders...and after doing some magical spying, we discovered that your friend and brother killed both your mother and fiancee...I am sorry Zibik...&quot; Zibik Lays his head back on the pillow &quot;So its over then?&quot; the old man nods. Zibik takes deep breath and closes his eyes. The Old man heads for the door but stops and looks back. &quot;What will you do now?&quot; Zibik opens his eyes slowly and looks at him. &quot;respect my mothers wishes and follow in my father's footsteps...&quot; He smiles a bit &quot; Become the greatest treasure hunter Norrath has ever known.&quot; The Old man just smiles. &quot;Best of Luck Zibik Quickfingers...You'll need it&quot; <p>"After twelve years of therapy my psychiatrist said something that brought tears to my eyes.

I dont recommend most of you look into them because I doubt you'd enjoy them....They are a Heavy metal band, if that doesnt stop you then let me know...The bands name is Zao.<br>

Heh It took me the better part of a year to pick that thing back up after I decided to stop...and now I'm happy I did it...*chuckle* You all are too good to me and I wouldnt trade you guys (gals and Jym) for anybody. <p><p align="left"><img src="http://pezhome.homestead.com/files/Picks2.jpg"></p>
