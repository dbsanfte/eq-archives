<br><OL>    
<LI>The HEALERS --- You will med to full before battle. You can heal anyone past 1/2 
health. Reserve all mana for healing. When you run out of mana, MED---But you should 
be medding between heals. Warriors get a STR bonus when they go below 40%...Only use 
this if the enemy is not dealing massive damage or constant damage, and only if the 
Warrior agrees BEFORE the battle. You should also buff yourself FIRST. When the buffs 
leave you, you should tell everyone and prepare for rebuffing (if hunting, No pulls 
till this is done and you are at 80m or more. Also you can heal guildmembers from the 
other group if needed. Watch guild chat for Commands.
<br><br>
<LI>The ARCHERS --- You are the second line of defense. You should be concerned with 
two things, replacing any tank who needs to pull back to rest and keeping anything 
from disrupting the Casters and Healers. Use your spells if any sparringly, with the 
exception of SNARE. You should cast this after the fight starts and anytime it wears 
off. Try to hold back from using ROOT unless you are helping a caster. When a mob 
gets to low health and runs, SNARE will slow him or stop him. ROOT will let him turn 
around and attack from his position. You ar eone of the most important people in the 
group. If the casters can't cast, or the healers can't heal, The group is doomed.
Watch guild chat for Commands.
<br><br>
<LI>The CASTERS --- You are the debuffers and the finishers. Your job is to make the 
enemy as easy to kill as possible. DD spells are great, but they are mana hogs. They 
should be used to finish a mob who is almost dead. DoT spells are great for casters 
but they have their drawbacks too. Every tick from a DoT is a chance for the mob to 
Aggro on the caster. You know how to play your caster, so play him well. It is YOUR 
responsibility to let everyone know when an enemy is on you. Watch guild chat for 
Commands.
 <br><br>
<LI>The TANKS --- You are the Primary Line of defense. You have one duty...KILL. You 
should focus on only one enemy at a time, making sure everyone uses /assist to do so 
You can trust the people in your group, but you should also watch your own health. If 
you get below 20%, you should pull back, and let everyone know you are pulling back. 
Warriors who use their beserker rage, should not TAUNT. Everyone else should. Things 
to watch for are your health, your Stamina (this is important, if less than 20%, you 
start to hit MUCH less and for less damage), and other MoB's. Watch guild chat for 
Commands.
<br><br>
<LI>The Puller --- Only Very competant pullers should be used in Large Group Tactics. 
You should have SoW for every pull, and never pull a train onto your group. Always 
let everyone know, In Advance, what you are pulling. And be aware of Casters and 
Healers mana levels. You are to pull singles if possible, doubles with warning, and 
anything more to the zone. You are the ONLY person who should Aggro MoB's. Watch 
guild chat for Commands.
<br><br>
<LI>Death --- DON'T DIE...If you have to back out to avoid being killed, do so.
<br><br>
<LI>Corpses --- Use /corpse any fallen brothers if an evac is called, if at all 
possible. This means you find a corpse buddy and make a hotkey with /consent 
|corpsebuddy|.
<br><br>
<LI>Loot --- You should split evenly AFTER battles.  Magical Items will be rolled 
for and winners will not be included in next roll. Boons will be given by Leaders 
for exceptional Battles.
<br><br>
<LI>PvP --- Certain things are different for PvP...
	<OL>
	<LI>There is no puller.
	<LI>Other Players will attack the Healers First, Casters Second
	<LI>For the initial attack, everyone should be CAMO'ed or INVIS'ed if possible
	<LI>Still target one enemy. when he is dead, go for another
	<LI>Commander can Call for a group to divide enemies. Group 1 assist their 
	main tank, Group 2 assist theirs. NO MORE THAN 2 ENEMIES should be attacked, 
	but our Healers and Casters should be protected at all costs by second line.
