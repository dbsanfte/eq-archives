<h5 align="center">I will write this introduction with optional words depending
on if I am still with you, or if I died today in-game =)&nbsp; So, if you were
in a group which&nbsp; was unfortunate enough to see the demise of the
Talechaser today, you should replace the appropriate words with the new edited
words in the parenthesis ().</h5>
<p align="center">Here is kept the (last) writings of a certain minstrel we all
know (knew) and love(d) named Obidil Talechaser.&nbsp; Obidil is (was) a good

knowledge during his time exploring

<h2 align="center">December 2002, where does the time fly?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>December 8, 4:24 pm</B> - Well, it's been long enough with no journal
    entry I think. &lt;chuckle&gt;&nbsp; I've been having a blast this week,
    though I was out of town for 4 days, when I came home, I took Robag and his
    new spells and Warder to Rathe and found out, I have the power to take them
    on solo now.&nbsp; Needless to say, Robag is now halfway through level 40 after
    many a dead Hill Giant and a full suit of Acrylia armor that he financed
    with the loot from these beasts.&nbsp; The other night Ironfrost and I took
    to the forests of Jaggedpine to fight the poachers with the assistance of
    Rranita.&nbsp; Lots of fun has been had lately and Hopefully I'll get more
    entries written.</li>
  <li><b>December 2, 2:30 am</B> - Well, here we are in yet another December of
    EverQuest Joyousness.&nbsp; We started off the month with a bang
    tonight.&nbsp; It all started with a Ding.&nbsp; The Ding of Obidil's third
    AA point thanks to the Poachers of Jaggedpine and to the quick and witty
    assistance (And her ability to root) of Wyndd our good and now appropriately
    renamed, Druidess.&nbsp; We had a grand time, but once I dinged and put my
    AA point into Intelligence like the goober that I am, We both logged off for
    about an hour.&nbsp; When we returned she had troubles staying connected and
    finally her modem just went poof, as I joined Ironfrost on Robag for some
    poacher death of a Tribunal kind.&nbsp; We took out mane a poacher, handling
    the additional pulls like the true gentlemen we are (SICK EM MUTTS).&nbsp; A
    few times we grabbed a bit more than we could handle, but once I realized
    how to pull then safely, we had a great time.&nbsp; Later on, Lysianari
    joined us and we took them even faster.&nbsp; The Ruckus was truly brought
    when Kiritateru made it to the camp and we had ourselves a decent
    Tank!&nbsp; Many Poachers fell to our might as we cast spell after spell
    taking them by force.&nbsp; During the night, I dinged to level 39 and after
    we were through, Wyndd made it back in time to help me get to Halas and find
    my new spells and massively powerful pet.&nbsp; Wyndd stayed outside with
    Malinn and chatted up a storm and then they were joined by Rranita and her
    game-husband Silvium.&nbsp; Once I found all the spells I needed, we all
    pulled up camp and headed for Rathe Mountains.&nbsp; We had a great time,
    later joined by Ironfrost and Nenamaro we all became very rich, before I
    passed out from exhaustion.</li>
