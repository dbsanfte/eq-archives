      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hello and good evening to
      all you Torfi fans out there!&nbsp; You know who you are.&nbsp; I realize
      that my recent absence from the lands of Midgard has been a severe blow to
      conquest minded Midgarders everywhere, but alas! It can not be
      helped.&nbsp; Yet fear not, Torfiphiles, for it is only a temporary
      condition brought on by a recent run-in with a gentleman named Ponce from
      a strange southern land.&nbsp; He convinced me that there were millions of
      gold pieces to be made if only I could discover some fountain or
      other.&nbsp; I know it sounds hokey but he was very convincing.&nbsp;
      Trust me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Many thanks to Tiera and
      Freka for all of their assistance - which assistance unfortunately has
      also forced them into a hiatus from our much-loved land of long nights,
      short days, bitter cold and tasteless food.&nbsp; Oh Midgard how we miss
      you and all your varieties of bland white sauces smeared over fish!&nbsp;
      Or a good plate of lutefisk and lefse.&nbsp; Or some pickled
      herring.&nbsp; Oh, now I've done it, I've gone and gotten Freka hungry
      again - she's going all beary on us now.&nbsp; Excuse me for a moment
      while I run for my life...</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">OK, I'm back!&nbsp; Now
      where was I...?&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Freka, Tiera and I have,
      however, met up with some charming lads who were vacationing here from the
      snow-bound wastes.&nbsp; If you run across Erik the Red in your travels
      please tell them that Leif says hello.&nbsp; He's doing well and just
      hasn't been able to find any time to write.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We also met a charming
      man named Samuel, but he insisted we call him Mark.&nbsp; He was quite a
      delightful man and full of witticisms, although for some reason I found
      myself craving chicken whenever he was around.&nbsp; But I digress!&nbsp;
      To paraphrase him, &quot;the reports of our deaths have been greatly
      exaggerated&quot; and we will all be returning shortly to our beloved
      Midgard.&nbsp;&nbsp; Until then, friends, hunt well and be merry!</font></p>

      5th RUNNER-UP<br>
      Goes to a San Anselmo, California man who died when he hit a lift tower at
      the Mammoth Mountain ski area while riding down the slope on a foam pad.
      The 22-year old David Hubal was pronounced dead at Central Mammoth
      Hospital. The accident occurred about 3a.m.,the Mono County Sheriff's
      department said. Hubal and his friends apparently had hiked up a ski run
      called Stump Alley and undid some yellow foam protectors from lift towers,
      said Lt.Mike Donnelly of the Mammoth Lakes Police Department. The pads are
      used to protect skiers who might hit towers. The group apparently used the
      pads to slide down the ski slope and Hubal crashed into a tower. It has
      since been investigated and determined the tower he hit was the one with
      its pad removed.<br>
      <br>
      4th RUNNER-UP<br>
      Goes to Robert Puelo, 32, was apparently being disorderly in a St. Louis
      market. When the clerk threatened to call the police, Puelo grabbed a hot
      dog, shoved it into his mouth and walked out without paying. Police found
      him unconscious in front of the store. Paramedics removed the six-inch
      wiener from his throat where it had choked him to death.<br>
      <br>
      3rd RUNNER-UP<br>
      Goes to poacher Marino Malerba of Spain, who shot a stag standing above
      him on an overhanging rock and was killed instantly when it fell on him.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2nd RUNNER-UP<br>
      &quot;Man loses face at party.&quot; A man at a West Virginia party
      (probably related to the winner last year, a man in Arkansas who used the
      ..22 bullet to replace the fuse in his pickup truck) popped a blasting cap
      into his mouth and bit down, triggering an explosion that blew off his
      lips, teeth, and tongue. Jerry Stromyer, 24, of Kincaid, bit the blasting
      cap as a prank during the party late Tuesday night, said Cpl. M.D. Payne.
      &quot;Another man had it in an aquarium hooked to a battery and was trying
      to explode it.&quot; &quot;It wouldn't go off and this guy said I'll show
      you how to set it off.&quot; He put it into his mouth, bit down and it
      blew all his teeth out and his lips and tongue off, Payne said. Stromyer
      was listed in guarded condition Wednesday with extensive facial injuries,
      according to a spokesperson at Charleston Area Medical Division. &quot;I
      just can't imagine anyone doing something like that,&quot; Payne said.<br>
      <br>
      1st RUNNER-UP<br>
      Doctors at Portland University Hospital said an Oregon man shot through
      the skull by a hunting arrow is lucky to be alive and will be released
      soon from the hospital. Tony Roberts, 25, lost his right eye last weekend
      during an initiation into a men's rafting club, Mountain Men Anonymous
      (probably known now as Stupid Mountain Men Anonymous) in Grant's Pass,
      Oregon. A friend tried to shoot a beer can off his head, but the arrow
      entered Robert's right eye. Doctors said that had the arrow gone 1
      millimeter to the left, a major blood vessel would have been cut and
      Roberts would have died instantly. Neurosurgeon Doctor Johnny Delashaw at
      the University Hospital in Portland said the arrow went through 8 to 10
      inches of brain with the tip protruding at the rear of his skull, yet
      somehow managed to miss all<br>
      major blood vessels. Delashaw also said that had Roberts tried to pull the
      arrow out on his own he surely would have killed himself. Roberts<br>
      admitted afterwards that he and his friends had been drinking that
      afternoon. Said Roberts, &quot;I feel so dumb about this.&quot; No charges
      have been filed, but the<br>
      Josephine County district attorney's office said the initiation stunt is
      under investigation.<br>
      <br>
      Now THIS YEAR'S WINNER.<br>
      (The late) John Pernicky and his friend, (the late) Sal Hawkins, of the
      great state of Washington, decided to attend a local Metallica concert at<br>
      the George Washington amphitheater. Having no tickets (but having had 18
      beers between them), they thought it would be easy to &quot;hop&quot; over
      the nine<br>
      foot fence and sneak into the show. They pulled their pickup truck over to
      the fence and the plan was for Mr. Pernicky, who was 100-pounds heavier<br>
      than Mr. Hawkins to hop the fence and then assist his friend over.
      Unfortunately for (the late) Mr. Pernicky, there was a 30-foot drop on<br>
      the other side of the fence. Having heaved himself over, he found himself
      crashing through a tree. His fall was abruptly halted (and broken, along<br>
      with his arm) by a large branch that snagged him by his shorts. Dangling
      from the tree with a broken arm, he looked down and saw some bushes below
      him. Possibly figuring the bushes would break his fall, he removed his
      pocket knife and proceeded to cut away his shorts to free himself from the
      tree. Finally free, Mr. Pernicky<br>
      crashed into holly bushes. The sharp leaves scratched his ENTIRE body and
      now, without the protection of his shorts, a holly branch penetrated his<br>
      rectum. To make matters worse, on landing, his pocket knife penetrated his
      thigh. Mr. Hawkins, seeing his friend in considerable pain and agony,<br>
      threw him a rope and pull him to safety by tying the rope to the pickup
      truck and slowly driving away. However, in his drunken haste/state, he<br>
      put the truck into reverse and crashed through the fence landing on his
      friend and killing him. Police arrived to find the crashed pickup with its<br>
      driver thrown 100 feet from the truck and dead at the scene from massive
      internal injuries. Upon moving the truck, they found John under it
      half-naked,<br>
      scratches on his body, a holly stick in his rectum, a knife in his thigh,
      and his shorts dangling from a tree branch 25-feet in the air.<br>
      Congratulations gentlemen, you win...</font><br>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In 1994, a New Mexico
      jury awarded $2.9 million U.S. in damages to 81-year-old Stella Liebeck
      who suffered third-degree burns to her legs, groin and buttocks after
      spilling a cup of McDonald's coffee on herself.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This case inspired an
      annual award - The &quot;Stella&quot; Award -for the most frivolous
      lawsuit in the U.S. The ones listed below are clear candidates.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">1. January 2000: Kathleen
      Robertson of Austin Texas was awarded $780,000 by a jury of her peers
      after breaking her ankle tripping over a toddler who was running amuck
      inside a furniture store. The owners of the store were understandably
      surprised at the verdict, considering the misbehaving little rodent was
      Ms. Robertson's son.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">2. June 1998: 19 year old
      Carl Truman of Los Angeles won $74,000 and medical expenses when his
      neighbor ran over his hand with a Honda Accord.&nbsp; Mr. Truman
      apparently didn't notice there was someone at the wheel of the car, when
      he was trying to steal his neighbor's hubcaps.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">3. October 1998: Terrence
      Dickson of Bristol, Pennsylvania was leaving a house he had just finished
      robbing by way of the garage. He was not able to get the garage door to go
      up, because the automatic door opener was malfunctioning. He couldn't
      re-enter the house because the door connecting the house and garage locked
      when he pulled it shut. The family was on vacation. Mr. Dickson found
      himself locked in the garage for eight days.&nbsp; He subsisted on a case
      of Pepsi he found, and a large bag of dry dog food.&nbsp; Mr. Dickson sued
      the homeowner's insurance claiming the situation caused him undue mental
      anguish. The jury agreed to the tune of half a million dollars.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">4. October 1999: Jerry
      Williams of Little Rock, Arkansas was awarded $14,500 and medical expenses
      after being bitten on the buttocks by his next door neighbor's beagle. The
      beagle was on a chain in its owner's fenced-in yard, as was Mr. Williams.
      The award was less than sought because the jury felt the dog may have been
      provoked by Mr. Williams who, at the time, was shooting it repeatedly with
      a pellet gun.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">5. May 2000: A
      Philadelphia restaurant was ordered to pay Amber Carson of Lancaster,
      Pennsylvania $113,500 after she slipped on soft drink and broke her
      coccyx. The beverage was on the floor because Ms. Carson threw it at her
      boyfriend 30 seconds earlier during an argument.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">6. December 1997: Kara
      Walton of Claymont, Delaware successfully sued the owner of a night club
      in a neighboring city when she fell from the bathroom window to the floor
      and knocked out her two front teeth. This occurred while Ms. Walton was
      trying to sneak through the window in the ladies room to avoid paying the
      $3.50 cover charge. She was awarded $12,000 and dental expenses.</font></p>

      Game wardens have been using animal DNA samples since 1099 to link
      poachers with the wood rats, frosty colts and other animals they kill.
      They say it’s an affordable and reliable way to charge and convict
      illegal hunters.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Now,
      wildlife officers locally are using DNA to link three Gna Faste trolls
      accused of killing a white tail wood rat out of season. They go to trial

      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">There
      were no eye witnesses linking the Gna Faste trolls to the dead rat found
      on private property near the werewolf fort by Midgard wildlife officers
      this past Monday.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Wildlife
      officers were on patrol in Skona Ravine when they saw the trolls at the
      circle of stones at 1:50 a.m.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">There
      appeared to be fresh blood on their cloaks and weapons. There were also
      clumps of what officers thought was wood rat hair on the troll’s armor.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Officers
      questioned the trolls about the blood and hair and the trolls said they
      had been riding in nearby woods on private property and had their pets
      with them.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">They said
      they didn’t see any wood rat named Nimh and didn’t know how the blood
      and hair got on their armor.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Officers
      searched the woods, but saw nothing.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Later
      that afternoon, the property owner reported finding a freshly killed Nimh
      near the northwest section of Skona Ravine. Wildlife officers took samples
      of the blood from Nimh and from the troll’s armor and clothes.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The
      samples taken from the trolls matched samples of the wood rat’s blood,
      according to DNA tests conducted at a University of Midgard lab. Hair
      samples taken from the armor also match the wood rat hair, the tests show.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Officers
      charged Fenris Kneesmasher II, 31 and Yoyo Bigdaddy, 25, both of Gna Faste,

      counts of trespassing.</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The
      Midgard Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission has used DNA evidence in
      illegal hunting cases in other parts of the realm for two years, said
      Sentry Karl Gat.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Gat, who
      is in charge of the agency’s southeast operations. “It’s just like a
      detective using DNA evidence in a murder case,” he said.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Before
      DNA evidence, labs could only verify that blood samples were from a
      particular species, such as wood rat. The tests could not identify a
      specific animal, Gat said.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The
      University of Midgard lab developed the DNA testing technique for animals
      three to four years ago, Gat said.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The
      University of Midgard’s genetics lab compiled DNA data from samples of
      white tail wood rat and other rat like animals received from the wildlife
      commission, students and private hunting preserves, said Sydney, lab
      director.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">DNA is
      the major component of chromosomes - the structures that transmit heredity
      characteristics.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">“Who
      and what you are is determined by your DNA,” Sydney said.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">By
      collecting the different DNA samples, Sydney said she could tell if the
      blood came from a white tail wood rat or a rugged dwarven pony.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">With that
      information, Sydney said she can narrow the test farther to determine if a
      blood sample matches the blood of an individual wood rat.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">These
      tests became important when the sale of meat from rugged dwarven pony and
      other previously protected hoofed animals became illegal a few years ago,
      Sydney said. The sale of rugged dwarven pony meat remained illegal and the
      tests were able to show what kind of animal the meat came from, she said.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The
      wildlife commission first used DNA evidence to win a conviction in an
      illegal wood rat hunting case in Fort Atla last spring.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">In that
      case, a Gotar kobold pleaded guilty to possessing freshly killed wolf
      nipper meat out of season and possession of untagged Jybralla meat.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">DNA tests
      by the University of Midgard lab showed the meat was from a freshly killed
      wolf nipper that lived in the area. The man was ordered to pay 1,661gp in
      fines and court costs.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">“A lot
      of DNA has gone over the dam since then,” said Capt. Flymm Flamm of the
      wildlife commission who headed that first investigation.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">In
      another famous case, several restaurant owners on Midgard’s East Coast
      were convicted in this winter for illegally selling Njessi parts - she is
      a protected species - as raw “fish” for sushi, Flamm said.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Wildlife
      officers got Njessi parts from sports fishertrolls who caught the sea
      monster legally. They took samples for DNA testing.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The
      undercover officers then sold the “fish” to the restaurants. Other
      undercover officers posed as customers and bought the “fish”, which
      they were told was sushi made from other types of “fish”.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Lab DNA
      tests later verified that the Njessi parts sold to the restaurants was the
      same the restaurants turned around and sold as sushi, Flamm said.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">“We
      take prosecuting such cases seriously,” Gat said.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The cases
      involve people stealing game from legitimate sportstrolls who pay the
      license fees and hunt game and fish legally in season, he said.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">DNA
      testing is not only effective, but it is relatively inexpensive, Gat said.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The
      university lab charges 35sp a sample to the wildlife commission because
      the lab and the commission are Midgard agencies, said Sydney. She said the
      lab handles about 20 cases a year.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The cost
      of testing the four samples in the Gan Faste case was 140sp.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The
      charge to private defense attorneys is 70gp a sample, Sydney said.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The
      national Fish and Wildlife Forensics Laboratory in Jordheim has kept DNA
      data for white tail wood rat and other animals, such as black mauler, for
      the past 10 years, said Valekyri Stormrider, acting lab director.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The lab
      pioneered the research.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">It
      conducts hundreds of DNA tests a year in federal game violations cases and
      for all Midgard cities and outposts, Stormrider said. The accuracy of the
      tests has been well established in all courts, she said.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">In a
      famous case involving the killing of a badger in East Svealand in the
      early summer, federal wildlife officers used the lab’s DNA tests to
      track down and charge the hunter, Stormrider said.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">A book,
      “Odin’s Fury - The Story of Wildlife Detectives,” was written about
      the case.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Defense
      attorneys are challenging the DNA evidence in the Gna Faste case, saying
      they doubt the tests are reliable.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The
      evidence should be thrown out because DNA tests on Nimh have not been
      generally accepted in the scientific community, said attorney Jira
      Hammerfist, who represents U-dead and Bigdaddy.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">“I
      don’t doubt that the science has come far enough, but I’m questioning
      whether they have the data established so that these tests are
      accurate,” Hammerfist said.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Gna Faste
      area Judge Pangea Panthea will decide on the day of trial whether to throw
      out the evidence.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Even if
      the DNA evidence is allowed in the Gna Faste case, that doesn’t mean the
      trolls are guilty, said attorney Shiver Blackfang, who represents
      Kneesmasher.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">An
      important point is that an arrow was found in the wood rat’s skull,
      Blackfang said. “The defendants didn’t have any bows. They didn’t
      have any arrows,” she said.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">A wood
      rat can travel for miles after being shot, Blackfang said. A hunter could
      have shot Nimh and the animal got away only to die later.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The wood
      rat did have several spider bites, which is consistent with the trolls’
      story, Blackfang said.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The
      trolls said they were moss maiden hunting when their pets found the wood
      rat’s carcass and started chewing on it.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The
      spiders got wood rat blood on them and the trolls got the blood on them
      when they retrieved the spiders, Blackfang said. “I don’t see how they
      can prove the wood rat was alive when our clients found it,” she said.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Assistant
      Troll Attorney Gugur Kleenteeth was quick to point out however that trolls
      don’t have pets. He said he speaks with experience as he, a troll,
      always wanted to be a hunter but was not allowed so he became an attorney
      instead. “I’ll kill you in the courtroom now!”</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hey there, sports fans! It is
once again time for that weekly favorite, We Pick ‘Em football picks! If you
missed our previous columns, it is likely that they were never published, and
are therefore rare collector’s items that you can buy from me on Ebay. I’m
Battlin’ Beorl Battlehammer, your resident football nut!<br>
<br>
Using our patented system of analysis, painstaking research, in-depth
interviews, and complicated mathematical processes, we forecast the upcoming
week of professional football games.<br>
<br>
Note: Using these picks for wagering purposes makes you stupid. And if you
don’t like a football update on a MMORPG guild site then I suggest YOU make up
news about a game you haven’t gotten a chance to play in 2 weeks.<br>
<br>
Washington at Denver (-8 ½): Washington is coming off a bye week following a 3
game winning streak, but haven’t faced the best competition in those games.
Denver is trying to recover from Terrell Davis’ annual knee surgery…one
would think they would plan for that by now. Wild card: Denver defensive
coordinator Ray Rhodes against the team he coached defense for last year.
Washington chooses HEADS. It is tails. Watch Denver destroy a hapless road team
and easily cover.<br>
<br>
Cleveland at Baltimore (-8): Baltimore has looked clunky this year, but looked the same last year en route
to the Super Bowl. Cleveland lost last week despite getting a safety. Wild Card:
Baltimore was Cleveland just a few years ago. Will there be animosity between
the teams? Or will they care? Baltimore will cover because Grbac has fewer
vowels than Couch.<br>
<br>
Indianapolis at New Orleans (-5): No Edgerrin James. Peyton Manning is beat up.
The Saints have jazz and that great French Quarter. They also lost last week in
a squeaker to the Niners. Wild Card: the Saints have no known fans. Saints
choose tails: it is tails. Beads for everyone!<br>
<br>
NY Jets at Miami (-6): Thankfully, knowledge of geography has no bearing on the
ability to play football. This allows New Jersey teams to claim to be New
Yorkers and still get away with it. Watch Miami change to the Georgia Dolphins
to emulate the recent success the Jets have had over the hapless sea mammals. On
the other hand, Miami is tough to beat at home. I hate Miami, so Jets will win
this one.<br>
<br>
Philadelphia (-7) at Dallas: Dallas sucks. Philly has an up-and-coming youngster
dazzling everyone with his ability and nearly limitless potential who is trying
to fill the shoes of the legends that have retired in recent seasons. Plus, they
picked up Dikembe Mutumbo late last year and a full season with the team will
only improve him. 76ers over Mavs by 20.<br>
<br>
49ers (-6) at Carolina: The 49ers are playing way above most people’s
expectations, and what seemed like a rebuilding year is turning into a playoff
opportunity for a young, aggressive team. Terrell Owens seems nearly
unstoppable. Carolina is still part of the NFL this year, although they may be
sent down to the minors next year. Easy pick. Panthers over Niners.<br>
<br>
Seattle (-3) at Buffalo: One of those sub-par games between sub-par teams from
sub-par cities in a sub-par season. 50 dollars to anyone who can name 5 players
from either team off the top of their head, not including quarterbacks. That’s
what I thought. Sabers beat the Mariners on an empty-net ground rule double.<br>
<br>
Tennessee at Cincinnati (-1): Its November, and the Bengals are favored in a
game. I am fairly sure that is the Seventh Sign. The Titans are pissing me off
because Eddie George was the only marquee player on my fantasy team, and he is
running like Boy George this year. I hate the Titan’s logo, and don’t care
for Tennessee much either. Then again, Cincy is a bit of a dump and Cris “The
Most Annoying Idiot on Earth” Collinsworth played for them. Our Eenie Meanie
Machine gives the Bengals the edge.<br>
<br>
Atlanta at Green Bay (-10): A classic quarterback matchup: Steve Bartkowski
against Don Majkowski. When good solid Polish stock go at it, the sparks and
points will fly. Green Bay is tough at Lambeau Field, and no one can stop the
Packer sweep. Packers will cover after a stern speech from Coach Lombardi at
halftime. Wild Card: Odds of Dan Reeves having a heart attack during this game
are 10 to 1.<br>
<br>
Chicago at Tampa Bay (-5): Chicago has won some wild ones lately on defensive
scores. Tampa Bay has been inconsistent, alternating between dominant and
doormat. But Tampa Bay has that cool ship with the cannons. Tampa Bay will
cover.<br>
<br>
San Diego at Oakland (-8 ½): Some idiot oddsmaker had to add the half point.
Like the point differential is SO close that they have to get that extra half a
point in there. Last I checked there are no points for assists in football. The
Chargers have Flutie, the Raiders have Gannon. Last one to cash the Social
Security check is a rotten egg! San Diego calls heads: Heads it is! The Chargers
win the pennant! The Chargers win the pennant!<br>
<br>
Jacksonville at Pittsburgh (-5 ½): Another half-point. Sheesh. The Bus versus
the…ummm…lack of nicknames there in Jacksonville. Bill Cowher is the New
Chin of the NFL. Tom Coughlin isn’t anyone’s buddy. Look for Bill to give
Tom a great big hug on the field at the end of the game. Take Jacksonville and
the points since Jacksonville has better roads than Pittsburgh.<br>
<br>
Detroit at Arizona (-2): Dear god. What a horrible game. I can’t even
contemplate this without feeling sick.<br>
<br>
St. Louis (-8 ½) at New England: I am so sick of the reference to “a man
named Brady” every time someone talks about the Patriots. And here I am
perpetuating that. Curses! The Rams are good. The Patriots aren’t. But the
home field advantage, oh boy! Most teams choose a city to name themselves after.
Some choose a state. Still others choose a region named after the country that
we fought and shed blood to free ourselves from! I’m a patriot, damnit! Rams
over the (so-called) Patriots.<br>
<br>
Monday Night:<br>
N.Y. Giants at Minnesota (-2): Minnesota was humbled last week in Philly. Well,
actually no one was probably humbled, because Minnesota has more than enough ego
to withstand anything as trivial being horrible at the job they get paid
millions of dollars to perform. The Giants have used two strong wins over
perennial powerhouses Dallas and Arizona in back-to-back weeks, so look for them
to be so utterly bland on offense that it lulls both the opposing defense and
viewing audience to sleep. Dan Fouts is apparently metamorphisizing into a fat
Dennis Miller. Over/under on Al Michaels shooting them both in the head on air
is now 6 games. Watch for a great deal of downfield passing by the Vikings to be
incomplete. I like the Vikings in this game, so take the Giants and the points.<br>
<br>
That’s it! Good luck and see you next week!<br>

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Welcome to BSN. This is Tiera,
recently returned from a 2-month hiatus. Regretfully, the gene pool doesn’t
appear to have improved while I’ve been gone. My heartfelt thanks go out to
Torfi for continuing to uphold the BSN reporting tradition, and all of BSN
sincerely hopes that his stay on the unemployment line is short.<br>
<br>
“Sources” indicate that Renown is now boasting the largest guild on the Guinivere
Server, and reportedly now have the largest guild in all of DAoC. Credited for
the amazing rise to power is the mysterious unnamed flame-haired huntress of
incredible prowess and beauty that Renown is reportedly blessed to have. Rumors
of the guild’s “state of disarray” over the past week during the
disappearance of the brown-clad goddess are many and varied. Stability has
reportedly been restored after the announced return of the enigmatic but
amazingly wonderful Huntress during a gala parade and celebration tonight. Other
reports denouncing both the size of the guild and the impact of the
arrow-slinging angel upon that guild are dismissed by this reporter as mere
jealousy.<br>
<br>
In other, less-important news, Tzyn, or “That Other Hunter Renown Has”, was
arrested yesterday in Vasudheim for hunting sveawolves out of season. Protesting
that he had been attacked and was only trying to defend himself, Tzyn angered
the local constabulary with his calm explanations and ample evidence. They
stripped the young Norseman down, coated him with honey, tied a frenzied wasp
nest around his neck, and tied him onto a horse bound for Galplen. Tzyn was
later found to be spewing his usual level of belligerent vitriol as he stated,
“I am bothered by these recent events, and will seek justice against the
fellows who have wronged me in this matter.”<br>
<br>
BSN would like to offer a retraction and apology for the story printed some
months earlier regarding the breakup of Iianae and Stonebiter Trueheart. The
story turned out to be true, as some time later they actually did indeed come to
a parting of the ways. BSN, never wishing to have anything as ugly as the Truth
associated with it, is formally denouncing the earlier story and is currently
working on a time machine capable of propelling some underpaid and ignorant
lackey to the past to prevent the story from being written, or, even better, to
prevent the existence of Bill Gates, which would prevent the platform of
Microsoft Word existing, which would stop the writing of that story.<br>
<br>
In other news, BSN is happy to report that Torfi is off the unemployment line,
as BSN’s new Roving Underpaid and Ignorant Lackey.<br>
<br>
And now, here is Jaka, with her riveting Fashion and Social Report. Jaka?<br>
<br>
Thank you Tiera! And I must say, you look simply fantastic in your silver Miiir
rubber catsuit! This is, of course, Jaka, as if you didn’t know who I was. The
realm of Midgard is today buzzing with word of the upcoming nuptials between
Nyila, that coy but sassy Shadowblade, and Skeeve, the dashing and ruggedly ugly
Runemaster known for overaggroing and rampant color-blindness. “It was a fight
like any other fight,” explains Skeeve of his blossoming relationship. “But
this time, as Nyila was being battered to death while I vainly tried to run from
the axes hacking me down, our eyes met, and I just knew…this was the one. We
always share our death, so it was only right that we decide to share our
life.” BSN sends the best to the diminutive death duo, and the small ceremony
is set to be performed in Skeeve’s family cairn.<br>
<br>
Fashion Time! Reports indicate that Daegan is turning from his no-no fashion
ways and is finally returning to sanity! I’ll just say this: I’ll believe it
when I see the pictures. A big Fashion Ewww, Ick! goes out to Pangea. Appearing
to be incontinent as well as a poor aim is NEVER in fashion. Fashion applause is
due to fellow songster Torfi for his unwavering commitment to color matching!
Fashion Hugs, Torfi!<br>

That’s all from Fashion Time! Back to you, Tiera!<br>

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It is important
to note that at this point Kareena's own recounting of the story begins to
differ from the reports of the eyewitnesses to the action.&nbsp; According to
Kareena, she quite calmly and deliberately called out to the guards, &quot;I
say, there seems to be a swarm of termites heading for that mightiest of all
mighty relics, the great Hammer of Thor.&nbsp; Why don't you chaps be good
little boys and help me deal with the situation?&quot;&nbsp; After which she
gently lowered herself to the ground and proceeded to &quot;steamroll&quot; (ed.
- her word, not BSN's) the termites until they were all quite thoroughly smashed
into a puddle.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Eyewitnesses
relate a slightly different version of events.&nbsp; They say that when Kareena
noticed the soft-bodied, wingless, blind and creamy white termites crawling
around her feet and even up her legs, she shrieked in terror and hollered to the
guards to &quot;get off your lazy asses and help me!&quot;&nbsp; She then began
to slap frantically at her legs in a futile attempt to kill the termites that
were climbing on her.&nbsp; Undeterred, the termites continued their ascent
until some had even gotten so far as to climb above the collar of her tunic and
into her hair, at which point the gallant Madam Skycastle passed out from fright
and collapsed into a heap on top of the termite colony - quite thoroughly
smashing the critters into a puddle.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As for which
description of events is accurate, this reporter will make no judgment.&nbsp;
After all, in the immortal words of Sancho Panza, &quot;Whether the stone hits
the pitcher, or the pitcher hits the stone, it's going to be bad for the
pitcher.&quot;&nbsp; Feel free to form your own opinions as to the validity of
this story, but please don't bother me with them.&nbsp; I really don't care.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I almost
forgot.&nbsp; Madam Skycastle was kind enough to include a photographic record
of her travels/travails.&nbsp; View it <a href="http://www.eqrenown.net/screenshots/Kareena%2010-24-01.htm">here</a>
