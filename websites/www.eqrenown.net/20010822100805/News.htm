<br>
Welcome to BSN. I am Tiera, your exhausted anchor. Who you are is of no consequence.<br>
<br>
Our top story regards the surprise “Solusek Freezes Over” Tour by the
members of the band Renown. The long-absent Tirmelon and Kyna Whisperwind joined
the reclusive Alatiera in re-uniting with stalwarts Averdi Bel’Caed, Kitri
Leafpaw, and Nelilia Agramon. The reunion prompted nearly a dozen (actually,
slightly less than one) tells from excited and disbelieving fans. BSN attempted
to reach the band for comment, but only managed to hear a backstage conversation
between the bandmates. The conversation consisted mostly of Alatiera wondering
how to open a trade window and Tirmelon demanding to know what in the world an
“ExtFat” hotkey was. Surprisingly, the band met with no casualties.<br>
<br>
And now, for a special Gossip Section report, we go to…. An Unnamed Source.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
[As submitted by Steelleg]<br>
<br>
Rumor has it that Kyna was seen cavorting with halflings, ogres and trolls at a
&quot;BBBQ&quot; in the area of Lake Rathe known as &quot;The Arena&quot; over
the weekend. The meat in the BBQ mix was, um, well, the other OTHER white meat.
No comment from Tirmelon or Antonius Bayle, who were also seen to be stuffing
their faces with the questionable meat product. When asked about his upcoming
endorsement of Ogre Swill (tm) in an ad campaign based on the slogan &quot;Good
enough for Erollisi Herself! &lt;BELCH&gt;&quot; Tirmelon commented,
&quot;&lt;BELCH&gt;&quot; and passed out into a barrel of the stuff.<br>
<br>
The anchorperson of the Brand Spanking News Network, Tiera, was recently seen at
a high society ice cream social in Neriak's Third Gate. Dressed in a ensemble
vaguely rococo but still leather chic and urbanesque with a slight hint of lime,
the Dark Elf version of Tiera was seen to swoon over the Rocky Road and fudge
ripple while ignoring the vanilla. She was overheard commenting to Nelilia
Agramon that &quot;Vanilla has no flash, no glitz, no glamour, NO CHOCOLATE!
It's only fit for dwarves.&quot; Nelilia herself wasn't observed near the
vanilla all afternoon, but she did partake of large portions of the Halfling
Swirl while sipping the Neriak favorite High Elf Ices. Promotional deals may be
forthcoming. Meanwhile, vanilla ice cream manufacturers across Norrath have
threatened to pull all their commercials from the BSN network unless an apology
is forthcoming from the Lady of News. The spokesdwarf for the Vanilla Coalition
was unavailable for comment at press time.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Thank you, Unnamed Source. In related news, a representative from BSN news feels
that any businesses wishing to pull advertisements from BSN are welcome to take
their pathetic, sad attempts at drumming up something even remotely resembling a
sale to those other networks, where no will see them and those that do are paid
by me to not buy any product endorsed by the network. Footage of the vanilla ice
cream manufacturers groveling before me and picking the chewing gum from the
bottom of my Miiir Better-Than-Pleather pumps will be available later, I’m
sure.<br>

Good news on the AO front, as apparently 100% of the people polled reported no
disconnects for the entirety of last night. This is regarded a “first” in
the history of Rubi-Ka and was met with a spontaneous herring and fjord party by
Funcom’s Norwegian staff. The party reportedly ground to a halt after the poll
further revealed that 100% of the people polled had actually logged into
Everquest last night and never turned AO on at all.<br>

            bringing this band to justice. According to Radiant, the gang was

happy to report that our ratings have eclipsed both CNN and that Fox news
channel, whatever it’s called. According to an Unnamed Source high in the
hierarchy of the Nielsen Company, BSN has a shocking 124% of the viewing
audience, driving the outdated, outmoded, and outscored networks into negative
territory. According to what we imagine our Unnamed Source might have said, “people
have actually gone <i>back in time</i> to unwatch programs they had previously
watched on these networks. Although, honestly, most of the credit is due to BSN’s
Tiera, who is by far the most amazingly perfect creation I or anyone else might
have seen.” BSN is reportedly using the impact of its new ratings to insure
that they do their utmost to foster global unity, and have begun the process by
purchasing Brazil, Madagascar, and Australia.</font></p>

Aveki Maulkar sneered publicly when mentioning his brother’s name, Averdi Bel’Caed.
“I saw it happen,” stated one witness, Guard Darien in Erudin. “His lip
curled in the most contemptuous display of, well, lip-movement I have ever seen.”
Other sources have reported hearing a snort as well, but that falls into the
realm of unsubstantiated rumor that BSN is only too happy to peddle.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">On the Rubi-Ka beat, reports
state that various agents of Omni-Tek raided a trailer in Lush Fields 846 times
yesterday. Reportedly, each raid was looking for a different item or person, and
somehow the various raids at no point stepped on each other’s toes. Maude
Jampett, the owner and resident of the trailer, said she is just plain sick and
tired of the raids. “I don’t git it,” she stated. “Evr’ damn day some
fool an’ his buddies come shootin’ up th’ place, killin’ off my
relatives and claimin’ tah find ‘radar displays’ or some cockamamie thing
in my bathroom, or just takin’ th’ pitchers right offa my wall. Keep claimin’
some machine on th’ street is tellin’ em ta do it and callin’ me an’ my
brood ‘clanners’. I tell ya, I’m just damn tired of it.” According to
Maude, her Uncle Cleatus has been shot and killed no less than 4000 times in the

ridiculous.”</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">In Norrathian News today….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">The gnolls of Blackburrow have brought a
lawsuit against the dwarves of Kaladim over the alleged copyright violation of
the initials “BB”. The gnolls and their lawyer, Mr. Slivonious Wellstrom of
Freeport, allege that the dwarves are in violation of an agreement made 7 years
ago over the exclusion of “BB” to refer to the tourist haven of Blackburrow,
and not the Butcherblock Mountains, home of the dwarves and location of their
city of Kaladim. According to Mr. Wellstrom, the marketing firm employed by the
dwarves, the Port Biotches and Assorted Dr00ds of Norrath, has used the “BB”
initials when advertising their travel specials to the Butcherblock Mountains.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">“It’s a very ad hominem case,” Mr.
Wellstrom said today at an AM news conference. “When a Dr00d advertises “BB
TP - 10 pp”, the BB initials become immediately identified with the
Butcherblock Mountains, NOT the Ancestral Home And Brewery of Blackburrow. When
a quid pro quo turns and goes pro bono, it’s a veni vidi vici situation. The
jury will have to attest to our allegations of vestis virum redit, vis a vis the
quorum. It’s as simple as “elephantus non capit mirum.”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">A crack dwarven legal team has been
marshalling at the gates of Kaladim to deal with the allegations. Some eyebrows
have been raised at the 700 lawyers assembled, armored, and armed for the
negotiations due to take place in Blackburrow tomorrow, but an official from
Kaladim would only state that they “take the defense of Kaladim very
seriously.” The official also stated his belief that Mr. Wellstrom merely has
an axe to grind, and it is “only fittin’ we do the same.”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">In other news, sources cite a protest in
Omni-Tek’s Entertainment District over the alleged harvesting of organs and
other people bits from an elaborate trap rumored to have been set by Omni-Med.
The trap is said to consist of a building built in the “Red Light District”
named “Hal Lector’s Leather”. When entered, would-be patrons find that the
entire interior has been painted invisible, making it impossible for patrons to
see walls, stairs, products, exits, or indeed anything resembling a building’s
interior. The patrons eventually take their own lives or starve to death, yet no
bodies are ever visible inside the building. Rioters are apparently protesting
such blatant human-rights disregard portrayed by Omni-Med, who answered the
protestors’ allegations with a band of armed thugs. A representative of
Omni-Med stated that “the lethal force used in addressing the protestors’
concerns is just another example of the lengths we will go to to ensure that the
Omni-Med image is clean. Not a single person left the area with any doubt that
Omni-Med was the hero here.” The official added that the tear gas pumped into
the local elementary school ventilation system was merely a “professional
courtesy.”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">In DAoC news, this past weekend saw the
formation of the first guild to take part in the Beta testing, with over 80 set
to be included over the next few days. Some obviously paid-off GM with greased
palms gave the collection of gimps their guild status amid arse-kissing and
obsequious fawning on August 10th. Renown is not one of the guilds selected to
take part in the Beta, prompting one of their members to publicly state, “all
you nancy-boy bootlickers better enjoy it while you can, ‘cause when I get in
there, I’m gonna give you taste of my sour grapes right upside your head.” I’ll
say it to the little punks’ faces too. I, err, the representative from Renown
then gave them the old one-finger salute and went back to her room to pout.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">In a shocking display of hedonism,
self-styled “Priest of Erollisi” Tirmelon Whisperwind was found passed out
in a Freeport bar in the company of several bikini-clad dark elf females.
Reeking of Ogre Swill, the supposed and self-proclaimed “cleric” then
consumed the flesh of human children while wiping his sweaty armpits with the
mantle of dwarven beards he has accumulated by slaying the former owners in
their sleep by poison. This reporter witnessed a riot stirred up against the
lying sack of putrescence by a gnomish warrior and his paid army of
rabble-rousers, in which the vile guilty scum was burned in effigy. More
humiliating anecdotes of the baby-eating Tirmelon will be made public as soon as
Steelleg can think them up and verify them with the BSN Fact-Finding Committee,

inability to deal with an exploding mutant population brought on by their own
failed medical experiments, we bring you this report from Clan member Aliva
Torris, as edited by the Omni-Tek Public Relations Department:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you Tiera. Omni-Tek
    is your friend. Use your new gun on a clan member. Back to you, Tiera.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you, Aliva. That’s the
kind of hard-edged reporting that BSN is famous for.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">That’s all the time we have
for today. Remember, unless you provide us at BSN with real news from real
events, we will continue to provide the distortions, lies, and bald-faced
fantasies that our competition specializes in. Thank you, and Good Day.</font></p>

</font><font face="Verdana" color="#0000F0">August 8, 2001, submitted by
Alatiera</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">Hi! Welcome to the first
installment of Brand Spanking News! I’ll be doing my best to try to keep up
with the fun and exciting things happening in the various online games and
passing those juicy tidbits on to you. In the absence of any actual “news”,
I’ll cheerfully make something up and fob it off as something exciting and
important!</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">And now, the Roundup:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">In
EQ news, everyone is still buzzing about the changes made to enchanter charm in
Kael, designed to prevent the death of the Avatar of War to such a trivial force
consisting of 2 of the top guilds on the Nameless server getting wiped out 3
times each on average. Enchanters were discovered to have the ability to charm
giants and use them to tank the Avatar, so that ability was quickly removed to
go along with the inability of enchanters to either mez or stun those self-same
giants. Enchanters can now revel in the support role formerly dominated by
bards, the “stfu and clarity, thx la~” position.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">In a related story, Verant has
issued a statement declaring that any attempt to kill the Avatar of War that
does not involve 1000 level 1 rangers with rusty weapons is now considered an
exploit and is a bannable offense. The statement was later amended from “Avatar
of War” to “all mobs”.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">Word from the lands of Rubi-Ka
is dominated by the space-time anomaly that has forced the world back in time 3
weeks. Widespread disconnects, lag problems, sudden inexplicable failure of
nightvision goggles, and other related phenomenon are all blamed on the “Collapsing
Space-Time Parallax Conjunction Function” that has apparently restored Anarchy
Online to its release condition. Meteorologists are hoping the anomaly passes
quickly.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">In other news, the person or
persons responsible for my missing Rubber Catsuit Pants are asked to step
forward and return the item in question. Failing that, there will be a reward
for information detailing the responsible parties, as well as a prominent view
of the aforementioned responsible parties’ execution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">The buzz about DAoC is that it
still isn’t available. Sources quote Ypres “Tirmelon” Tyrval as saying “I
CAN’T WAIT!” We point you to the Renown forums for an ongoing discussion
about the possibilities of DAoC and Renown’s role in it.</font></p>
