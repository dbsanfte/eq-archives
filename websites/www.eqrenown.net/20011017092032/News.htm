the world’s population. President Dick Cheney, cradling George W. Bush’s
head against his breast and wiping the drool from his mouth with the corner of a
blankey, announced that a group of diplomats had been earlier dispatched to the
head of all sentient sea life, Phinigel Autropos, in an attempt to bring a halt

wrested from the undersea denizens.&nbsp; Renown then proceeded to kill all of
Phinigel’s assistants, including the pair believed responsible for the shark
attacks in recent days, Cauldronbubble and Cauldronboil. Statements from Renown

BSN is happy to report that Stonebiter Trueheart has successfully undergone
heart surgery and is currently recovering somewhere. His doctor, Tirmelon
Whisperwind, stated that the surgery was routine and completely successful.
However, eyewitnesses claim that Dr. Whisperwind was seen with a Living Heart of
a Brell Minion in his backpack, leading to rampant speculation as to what is now
beating in the chest of the diminutive rockchewer. Stories that Stonebiter
required the surgical attention after his wild rumpus with Penelope Cruz are
being vehemently denied by all parties involved, except BSN, which finds the
lack of any evidence tying the two together to be extremely suspicious.<br>
<br>
In other news, reports indicate that horses will be made available to players in
the upcoming Everquest expansion, Shadows of Luclin. This caused a great deal of
excitement, until it was realized that the horses will not teleport nor run at
the speed of SoW, making several people question the inclusion of
“eye-candy” over actual things of worth and interest. “This is only the
beginning!” exclaimed a Sony executive. “SoL will have horses, and player
housing, and PvP, and new zones, and great loot, and, umm, purchasable epic
weapons, and ultra-epic weapons, and trips to the moon, and super-duper
ultra-really-for-sure-this-time rare epicly epic weapons, and kitties, and a
chicken in every pot! DAoC sucks!” The executive was then sedated and led
calmly back to his cubicle.<br>

In our top story today, EverQuest has changed the appearance of the Server
Selection screen for players on the Test server. Where previously the server
name would list the current player population, on test the server screen now
lists only whether the server is up or down. The ability in-game to perform a
“/who all count”, showing the player population has also been disabled.
“We are doing this as a response to the overwhelming success of Anarchy
Online,” said a Verant spokesperson, speaking on a condition of anonymity.
“When we saw what a great job they were doing, and how feeble we were in
comparison, we knew we needed to imitate their success. AO doesn’t show server
populations, so we realized what made them such a hit and EQ such a flop.”
Reports that the change was made so that Mythic Entertainment would be unable to
produce headlines such as “Dark Ages of Camelot Steals 64.37982% of Average
EverQuest Peak-Time Players” are being pooh-poohed by both Verant executives
and 9 out of 10 dentists.<br>
<br>
In other news, the shocking news of the Iianae and Stonebiter Trueheart breakup
continues to rock across Norrath. Eyewitness reports have been fabricated to
report that Iianae recently blew up at Stonebiter at a gathering in North
Freeport. Iianae apparently accused the diminutive rockchewer of spending too
much time with “that cold-hearted bitch.” She went on to exclaim, “every
weekend, he wants to go to her house. We used to spend that time cuddling by the
Rivervale waterfalls. Now, all I hear is Vox Vox Vox. I hate that bitch.”
Stonebiter allegedly protested that he was only doing the “raids” on Vox
because items needed by various people that can only be pried from Vox’s
corpse, but Iianae is apparently no longer buying that excuse. Screenshots have
shown that Stonebiter is apparently getting over it fast, as he has been seen
several times recently in the company of Penelope Cruz. Protests from Iianae and
Stonebiter that this story is untrue have been dismissed as hearsay and rumor
mongering.<br>
<br>
Norrath was shocked today by the news that Kyna Whisperwind, the flame-haired
heartthrob Tracker, found her way from the Toxxulia Forest druid ring to Paineel
without assistance. Other signs of the impending apocalypse include stigmata
from the hands of children in Brazil, Kitri Leafpaw cursing out loud, and the
big bloody battle between the Archangel and the Angels of Heaven against Satan
and the Demon Hordes last week on WWF Raw.<br>
<br>
Legacy of Steel, the Uberguild First Class of the Nameless Server, accomplished
another EverQuest first by being the first guild to successfully kill Brad
McQuaid. “OMFG,” exclaimed one LoS member. “The quest for the McQuaid
family keys suXX0red, but man oh man was it worth it.” Yesterday 50 Legacy
members gathered on McQuaid’s front lawn, prepared themselves for battle, and
sent the puller with the keys into the house. “I ran in, smacked him on the
back of the head, and dashed back out the door,” explained the excited puller,
a software support technician from Wichita Falls, KS. “He was soooo pissed, he
didn’t notice everyone else.” McQuaid was then met by a hail of gunfire from
the assembled guild, and died in a surprisingly short battle. “He musta been
stunned, ‘cause I don’t think anyone got hit by him,” reported one of the
members. “I musta backstabbed him 12 times, and he didn’t even turn and
aggro on me.” The celebration was dimmed slightly as the corpse was looted.
The guild reportedly expressed disgust with the feeble winnings, but the hopes
that there was a bigger prize waiting in the wings were raised again as they
looted a ring of keys, presumed to be an as-yet-unresolved epic-style quest.<br>
<br>
News from Rubi-Ka is relatively quiet, although reports indicate that as many as
5 people had fun playing Anarchy Online this week.<br>
<br>
Thank you, and that is all the time we have for today. This is Tiera, who

immediately following Steelleg's retirement from adventuring.&nbsp; It has long
been rumored that the diminutive yet prickly fellow retreated to Freeport and
reestablished connections with one Gnarl Bearenson at a House of Ill Repute in
one of the seedier sections of town.&nbsp; According to the rumor Steelleg's
offer to provide &quot;protection&quot; in exchange for &quot;freebies&quot; was
originally accepted by the owner of the establishment, but the deal fell through

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">After months of exhaustive
research at the aforementioned House of Ill Repute - make that VERY exhaustive
research - this reporter has found that rumor to be untrue.&nbsp; The fact of
the matter is that Steelleg did indeed visit the house on several occasions,
but, as it turns out, his motive in doing so was not to find work or even
pleasure, but rather an attempt to reestablish connections with his old friend
and one of the house's more successful ahh, employees, Jaka.&nbsp; Apparently
Steelleg was not satisfied with the role he played in Jaka's magnum opus &quot;Jaka

Today’s top story regards the shocking indictment of the Brethren of the </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Mystic Dawn’s Avatar, Chrysania Kiga’rasku, on charges of racketeering. The
arrest was made in the wee hours of the morning today after evidence surfaced of
a sort of “raffle” during the last “BBBB”, an event marked by copious
consumption of alcohol and gladiatorial style combat of a very inhumane nature.<br>
<br>
“She’s running a numbers game, pure and simple,” said Bob Jenkins,
assistant to that U.S. Attorney General person, you know, the one that isn’t
Janet Reno. “She lures in these poor suckers, who believe that just a small
handful of money has a chance of turning into a large enough bankroll to help
feed and clothe their starving families.” Mr. Jenkins then goes on to explain
that a bogus “random” system is used to determine the winners, usually
Kiga’rasku’s cronies, who then later split the cash with the Avatar. Any
possible Mafia connections are being pursued and witnesses are being subpoenaed.
According to reports, a handful of witnesses interviewed have been remarkably
uncooperative. One witness in particular, Deral Swiftbow, is being held on
charges of contempt. “He wouldn’t talk,” says Mr. Jenkins. “Maybe some
time in the Hole with the slime will loosen his tongue.” Claims that Mr.
Swiftbow is mute are dismissed by the Attorney General’s office.<br>
<br>
Representatives from the Brethren could not be reached for comment. Actually, we
didn’t try, but it all amounts to the same thing. In the effort to maintain
BSN’s reputation for unbiased reporting, we just want to add that she’s
guilty as hell.<br>

In other Norrathian news, reports indicate that the notoriously bad-dressed gang
of ruffians known as Daegan and the Boys has been seen skulking around the
borders of the Nameless. “Experts” speculate that the gang is preparing for
a border crossing into Innoruuk Server territory, where they might be safe from
the manhunt pursuing them. Radiant, the cold-blooded, scaly-skinned investigator
in charge of the case, vowed to prepare extradition orders in the event of a
server jump by the warm-blooded killers.<br>
<br>
On Rubi-Ka today, reports indicate a full-blown Omni-Pol investigation of the
franchise known as Bronto Burger. Bronto Burger, the single largest franchise on
Rubi-Ka boasting over 20 stands in every square mile of Rubi-Ka, is being
targeted by Kal Motreephia, a high-ranking member of Omni-Pol, amid allegations
of being a Clan weapons supplier. “It just struck me one morning as I was
driving to work,” Kal said. “I passed my third Bronto Burger, and looked at
the patrons in line. I saw heavily armed and armored men and women selling items
to the counter girl. Weapons, armor, weapon construction items, nanos, all types
of things. Not one person was buying anything. And then it hit me: Bronto Burger
sells food. No one on Rubi-Ka eats anything. Nothing. Not a sausage. Nothing at
all. How could a food franchise have that many stands if no one eats
anything?” Representatives of Bronto Burger have reportedly invited Kal for a
very up close and personal tour of their bronto-slaughtering house in Galway
County, especially the highly advanced grinding machine.<br>
<br>
Reports on the state of DAoC claim that Electronics Boutique, a front for the
Madagascar clothing and spice cartels, shows a release date of October 19 for
the highly anticipated title. When asked for comment, Ypres “Tirmelon”
Tyrval replied, “I CAN’T WAIT!” Vacation requests for the week of October

Research reported in July 2001 suggests that the chili's fiery taste deters
creatures who are poor at dispersing the plant's seeds. Fortunately for the
poultry industry, this does not include birds. 'Birds appear not to have the
receptors to the hot pungent part of the peppers', says Audrey McElroy of
Virginia Tech University, Blacksburg. 'It appears not to affect them in any way.'&nbsp;
The chickens did get inflamed intestines, however, and this is the main clue to
how the spice might be working.&quot;&nbsp; (New Scientist)</font></p>

kicks off</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>

<br>
Welcome to BSN. I am Tiera, your exhausted anchor. Who you are is of no consequence.<br>
<br>
Our top story regards the surprise “Solusek Freezes Over” Tour by the
members of the band Renown. The long-absent Tirmelon and Kyna Whisperwind joined
the reclusive Alatiera in re-uniting with stalwarts Averdi Bel’Caed, Kitri
Leafpaw, and Nelilia Agramon. The reunion prompted nearly a dozen (actually,
slightly less than one) tells from excited and disbelieving fans. BSN attempted
to reach the band for comment, but only managed to hear a backstage conversation
between the bandmates. The conversation consisted mostly of Alatiera wondering
how to open a trade window and Tirmelon demanding to know what in the world an
“ExtFat” hotkey was. Surprisingly, the band met with no casualties.<br>
<br>
And now, for a special Gossip Section report, we go to…. An Unnamed Source.<br>

<br>
Rumor has it that Kyna was seen cavorting with halflings, ogres and trolls at a
&quot;BBBQ&quot; in the area of Lake Rathe known as &quot;The Arena&quot; over
the weekend. The meat in the BBQ mix was, um, well, the other OTHER white meat.
No comment from Tirmelon or Antonius Bayle, who were also seen to be stuffing
their faces with the questionable meat product. When asked about his upcoming
endorsement of Ogre Swill (tm) in an ad campaign based on the slogan &quot;Good
enough for Erollisi Herself! &lt;BELCH&gt;&quot; Tirmelon commented,
&quot;&lt;BELCH&gt;&quot; and passed out into a barrel of the stuff.<br>
<br>
The anchorperson of the Brand Spanking News Network, Tiera, was recently seen at
a high society ice cream social in Neriak's Third Gate. Dressed in a ensemble
vaguely rococo but still leather chic and urbanesque with a slight hint of lime,
the Dark Elf version of Tiera was seen to swoon over the Rocky Road and fudge
ripple while ignoring the vanilla. She was overheard commenting to Nelilia
Agramon that &quot;Vanilla has no flash, no glitz, no glamour, NO CHOCOLATE!
It's only fit for dwarves.&quot; Nelilia herself wasn't observed near the
vanilla all afternoon, but she did partake of large portions of the Halfling
Swirl while sipping the Neriak favorite High Elf Ices. Promotional deals may be
forthcoming. Meanwhile, vanilla ice cream manufacturers across Norrath have
threatened to pull all their commercials from the BSN network unless an apology
is forthcoming from the Lady of News. The spokesdwarf for the Vanilla Coalition
was unavailable for comment at press time.<br>

<br>
Thank you, Unnamed Source. In related news, a representative from BSN news feels
that any businesses wishing to pull advertisements from BSN are welcome to take
their pathetic, sad attempts at drumming up something even remotely resembling a
sale to those other networks, where no will see them and those that do are paid
by me to not buy any product endorsed by the network. Footage of the vanilla ice
cream manufacturers groveling before me and picking the chewing gum from the
bottom of my Miiir Better-Than-Pleather pumps will be available later, I’m
sure.<br>

Good news on the AO front, as apparently 100% of the people polled reported no
disconnects for the entirety of last night. This is regarded a “first” in
the history of Rubi-Ka and was met with a spontaneous herring and fjord party by
Funcom’s Norwegian staff. The party reportedly ground to a halt after the poll
further revealed that 100% of the people polled had actually logged into
Everquest last night and never turned AO on at all.<br>

A 4-hour retrospective on the short and tragic life of my Rubber Catsuit Pants

retrospective will be commercial and content free and will run in a constant
