    fun and enjoy your adventures in Norrath. A member of Highland Knights can 
    do this without kill stealing, training other citizens of Norrath with mobs, 
    or doing anything else that might prevent others from having fun or enjoying 
    their adventures.<br>
    <br>
    2. You must protect your clansmen at all times, putting their needs ahead of 
    your own.<br>
    <br>
    3. You must be hospitable to all strangers. Always giving a hearty welcome 
    and helping them in any way you can.<br>
    <br>
    4. You must be honest and always have fair dealings. Your name and the name 
    of the clan must always be one of honor.</b><br>

<p>          <b><font color="#008000" size="2" face="Verdana">1. Any member of the guild can organize a guild raid. For a 
    raid to be considered as a Guild Raid, it must be approved by an officer.&nbsp; 
    (This is as simple as posting a request on the Message board, from there it 
    will be approved.) If a grouping is considered a guild raid then the guild 
    looting rules apply.<br>
    <br>
    2. During the raid, there's NO useless chatter. Someone not paying attention 
    could cause the rest of us to get killed and destroy the raid.<br>
    <br>
    3. No extended periods of AFK. You gotta pee? Pee before hand. Need to walk 
    the dog? Walk the dog before hand. You need to go hang out with the 
    wife/girlfriend? Put her to bed beforehand. Holding up 20 people for your 
    laundry isn't cool.<br>
    <br>
    4. You must pay attention to the raid organizer at all times and keep up 
    with what the organizer says. If you don't keep up, and you get left behind, 
    you might a) die, b) start a train and kill us all and everyone else in the 
    zone, c) lose your corpse. All 3 of these options are unacceptable.<br>
    <br>
    5. Loot will be random AFTER the raid is over (Unless the item is NO DROP. 
    In that case it will be rolled for immediately), for EVERYONE who can use 
    the item. It will be done by a master looter, who will then random the item 
    by use of one roll. The master looter will be the leader of each group. To 
    avoid confusion, the master looter will deposit his/her own items in the 
    bank prior to the hunt.<br>
    <br>
    6. There will be no bickering/arguing about anything up to, and including 
    loot. The raid leader's say is final.<br>
    <br>
    7. There will be one person assigned as the assist person. To make it as 
    easy as possible, create a hotkey that says &quot;/assist
    <first person assist of name>&quot;. Keep hitting that hotkey as soon as the 
    assist person says that a target has been acquired.<br>
    <br>
    8. The message board will be used to organize the groups beforehand. If a 
    raid is announced, please post a message stating your class/level to 
    register for the raid.<br>
    <br>
    9. During a raid, guild chat will only be used by the leaders of the groups. 
    All other conversation must take place in group chat.<br>

          <p><b><font color="#008000" size="2" face="Verdana">1. Highland Knights are a &quot;By Recommendation&quot; only membership 
    guild. This means that no one will be tagged simply because they want to 
    join the guild. Any player wishing to become a member must first find a 
    &quot;Sponsor&quot;. Any current regular member of the guild may be a sponsor. Once a 
    sponsor has been found, the Sponsor must contact an officer and make his 
    sponsor status known.<br>
    <br>
    2. The recruit must be within the guild's level requirement. The minimum 
    level that may be recruited into the clan is currently level 20. <br>
    <br>
    3. Grouping - As a general rule I would say about 2-3 hours real time 
    grouping is a minimum for a prospective recruit, with a good portion of that 
    time spent in battle. The guild member who recommends a recruit for 
    evaluation shall be the Advocate to the Guild concerning that recruit.<br>

          <b><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">The items in the treasury will be stored by the guild 
    treasurer on a &quot;mule&quot; character created specifically for this purpose. These 
    items will be available for you to purchase at discounted prices if you wish 
    and some of them are potential gifts for clansmen who show courage, loyalty,
          hospitality and honesty, the qualities we look for in our guild. <br>
    <br>
    There will be no dues as such. Instead, funds will be generated in three 
    ways.<br>
    <br>
    1. Guild Fund Hunts. Periodically, guild fund hunts will be organized as a 
    way to raise money for the guild while at the same time providing an 
    opportunity for fellowship and fun. Groups will form to hunt profitable 
    monsters with one guild officer or designated leader per group. To avoid 
    confusion, all guild members should deposit their own coinage in the bank 
    prior to the hunt. The groups will venture out, slay monsters, and gain 
    experience and loot. Upon returning to town, all members should sell all 
    loot and give the coinage to the guild officer or leader of their group, who 
    will in turn give this coinage to the guild treasurer’s “bank” character for 
    deposit. During fund hunts, special items found as loot should also be 
    turned in and can be sold by the guild treasurer or stored for later use. If 
    sold, the member who originally found the item will be given first 
    opportunity to buy it from the guild.<br>
    <br>
    2. Item Recycling. Useful items can be donated to the guild for sale to 
    guild members. When the purchasing member outgrows the item, he or she is 
    expected to donate the item back to the guild to be resold to another 
    member. This gives members a chance to buy needed items at discounted rates, 
    while at the same time raising money for the guild and promoting fellowship 
    among members. The donating clansmen will, of course, receive recognition 
    for his or her generosity.<br>
    <br>
    3. Clan Coin Donations. Any donations made by a clansmen will be posted in 
    the clan forum in recognition for his or her generosity.<br>
    <br>
    <u>Gift</u> = Item awarded to a guild member for demonstrating courage, 
    loyalty, hospitality and honesty. This could be via an accomplishment at a 
    guild raid or quest. An item can also be gifted for a prize in a competition 
    or given to a member under extreme circumstances such as a lost corpse. 
    Gifted items are yours to keep, use, and sell as you wish.<br>
    <br>
    Guild member may nominate members of the guild, and may also nominate 
    Non-members, for acts deemed worthy of recognition. Non members will be 
    officially recognized by the guild master. (example: non member grouped with 
    members risks his life to save our members in a combat situation. This is 
    Highland Knights behavior, and recognizing the individual may also become a 
    good recruiting tool)</font><font size="6" color="#000099"><br>

<b> 
<font face="Verdana" color="#008000" size="2"> Every Clan member has the ability to become an officer. 
    Officers are selected from the clan amongst people who have shown themselves 
    to be courageous, loyal, hospitably and honest. Every officer has an 
    important job they are responsible for. If an officer position becomes 
    available in the clan, nominees will be selected and then voted upon by the 
    clan.<br>
    <br>
    The officer roster is dynamic, and any officer, can be decided to be 
    replaced, can ask to be replaced so on.<br>
    <br>
    People can talk to the guildmaster if they have interest to become officer 
    and have tasks that need to be done/responsibilities to accomplish<br>
    <br>
    Non-officer members are just as important in this clan. We encourage all to 
    take an active role in the clan, for you ARE the clan. When important issues 
    arise, members will indeed be an integral part of decisions that have to be 
    made.<br>

    1. Shout the clan war cry, &quot;I AM MY BROTHER'S KEEPER!!!!&quot;, at the entrance 
    of every zone.<br>
    <br>
    2. Role-play in a Scottish accent at all times using these words:</p><p align="center">
    Ye = You<br>
    Yer = Your<br>
    Cannae = Can Not<br>
    Doesnae = Does Not<br>
    Shouldnae = 
    Should Not<br>
    Dinnae = Do Not<br>
    Arenae = Are Not<br>
    Willnae = Will Not<br>
    Wee = Little<br>
    Weel = Well<br>
    Laddie = Boy<br>
    Lass = Girl<br>
    Tis = It Is<br>
    E'en = Even<br>
    Nay = No<br>
    Aye = Yes<br>
    Mayhap = Perhaps<br>
    Mon = Man<br>
    Ne'er = Never<br>
    A'right = Alright<br>
    E'eryone = Everyone<br>
    T' = To<br>
    Jus' = Just</p>
    3. Treat your character as a &quot;real person&quot;, not as a bunch of numbers and 
    powers, bundled with some cool magic items or tough armor. In other words, 
    give the character a bit of personality, a little history, maybe a few (or a 
    lot of) quirks. Introduce the guild to your characture in our clan tavern 
    located in our message boards. Role-play is fun but not a requirment to be a 
    member of the Highland Knights.<br>
