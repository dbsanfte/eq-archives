ur goal as a Highland Clan partly role-play guild is to successfully come together and function as a close knit family of brothers and sisters - a true clan.<br>
<br>
The word &quot;clan&quot; originally meant, in Gaelic, offspring or descendants, or more accurately translated, family. We must encourage a sense of unity and family within our clan. Each clansmen or clanswoman reflects the honor of the clan itself. This means we represent the clan at all times. With every action we must show bravery and honor. Remember that the actions of one member can destroy the honor of the entire clan. If we can manage to function as a true clan we will be known throughout Norrath as a guild of valor. Honorable and helpful standing united and strong. <br>
<br>
So how are we to interact with our fellow clan members? The same way the Highlanders did with these qualities......<br>
<br>
<u><b>COURAGE</b></u> Accustomed as the Highlanders were to interminable feuds arising 
out of the pretensions of rival clans the native courage which they had 
inherited from their Celtic ancestors was preserved unimpaired. Instances of 
cowardice were therefore a very rare occurrence. They never ran from a battle. 
They never feared death.<br><br>

<u><b>LOYALTY</b></u> Highlander's always retained an enthusiastic attachment to their 
clan and country, which neither distance of place or length of time could 
dissolve. The reciprocal ties which connected the chief or Laird and his clan 
were unbreakable.<br><br>

<u><b>HOSPITALITY</b></u> In no country was the savage virtue of hospitality carried to 
a greater extent than in the Highlands, and never did strangers receive a 
heartier welcome than was given to a guest who entered a Highland mansion or 
cottage.<br><br>

<u><b>HONESTY</b></u> A Highlander's word is his bond. Even a verbal agreement was 
never unfulfilled or denied.<br><br>

In short we are to behave as this.......
<br><br>We must always be <u>COURAGEOUS</u>, 
never running or backing down from a fight. Never being afraid to charge forward 
into battle shouting our war cry from the depths of our hearts. We must always 
be prepared to defend our clan and everything we hold dear to us.<br><br>
We must always be <u>LOYAL</u>, with unbreakable ties that bind our clan 
together. The needs of our brothers and sisters will always come first above all 
others including ourselves.<br><br>
We must always be <u>HOSPITABLE</u>. All strangers will receive a hearty 
welcome. You will give of yourself to all without asking for payment in return.<br><br>
We must always be <u>HONEST</u>. We must always have fair dealings. A verbal 
agreement will never be unfulfilled or denied. You hold the honor of this clan 
high upon your shoulders. We will be known throughout Norrath in the way that 
each of us chooses to carry our weight in the clan.</font></p>
