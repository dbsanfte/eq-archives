        ranks thus effectively doubling our guild strength and talent. We will 
        be going through a small transition and a new influx of players that will 
        be sorted out shortly. Please bear with the officers and the new members 
        till all is back to normal again and we get to know each other better. 
        Please all of you old KOLR guild members that join look as this as your 
        new home we want to make your transition as smooth as possible. During 
        this transition time all KOLR members and alts are allowed to join GOTG 
        without the set level requirement restrictions till further notice. This 
        only applies to former KOLR in good standing, all other recruits have 
        to be level 35+ and alts level 20+.</font></p>

        </font></b>I have posted a new Guild <a href="/pages/main/polls.htm" target="Main">Poll</a> 
        page in order to better serve the needs of the guild and try to find out 
        what the guild would like to do in the future and the like. Please visit 
        this page at least once a week to see what polls will be posted. Currently 
        I am running a Guild Raid poll to determine what day, time and place to 
        raid. Please fill out the poll and do so only once so I can get an accurate 
        count on what you want to do in the future.</font></font></p>

        </font></b>Talindra Ld, a level 27 wood elf druid has retired today from 
        the game of Everquest :(</font> and subsequently the guild. This was due 
        to forces beyond her control. She was only a member of the guild for a 
        short period of time and many of us never got to know her or did not get 
        a chance to know her as well as we would have like to have. In her absences 
        she has kindly given the Guild Bank her complete equipment, supplies, 
        and money for our less fortunate. They will be put to used wisely. You 
        will be gone but not forgotten Talindra! Peace to you perhaps we will 
        meet again:)<br>

        <font size="2">This past week our former leader, Divine Healer, </font><font size="2">pass 
        the reins of the guild leadership to Talamont Trailfinder. This was only 
        an administrative move due to game playing time. Now, Talamont Trailfinder 
        has the exclusive right to make guild officers via a game command. The 
        leadership roles have not changed.</font></p>

        pull in (all underwater), the raid was listed as a learning experience

        for the Enchanted Trueshot Bow Quest when the party kick some fish arse 
        on the Golden Haired Mermaid. We had a great party of six Yinadar, Biggyslim, 
        Taediwen, Timlaak, Talamont and Euradaise, even though we had a few deaths.
