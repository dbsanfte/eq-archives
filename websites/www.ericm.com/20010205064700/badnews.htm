<p align="center">There have been reported &quot;Wonnie sightings&quot; in Norrath over
the past week or so.<br>
Could this be a long lost sister of BAD returning to our ranks?? We shall see in the days
ahead....<br>
Keep your eyes and ears open and be sure to report any sightings asap.</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#00FF00" face="Arial">Saturday, October 21st 2000</font></p>

<p align="center">BAD, together with Soldiers of Fortune assaulted the Plain of Fear.
&nbsp; BAD would like to <br>
thank Bandari of SoF for his hard work in putting together the BEST raid any of us have
ever <br>
ever been a part of.&nbsp; The raid was a total success, however, we did not get a chance
to take out <br>
Cazicthule himself.&nbsp; Next time will be different.&nbsp; BAD also would like to thank
those from other guilds who <br>
took part in the raid.&nbsp; Thanks go out to: Immortals, Clan Phoenix, Acid Cabal,
Equinox Brigade, and Dark Times.</p>

<p align="center">Also, BAD welcomes Betina to full membership status.&nbsp; We are very
happy to see a rise in <br>
the number of Clerics we have.&nbsp; And, we also welcome back Aryanne who was with us in
LoK and<br>
finally has joined us in EQ.&nbsp; She will be keeping our Clerics busy with res requests
and buffing sessions <br>
as she adjusts to life in EQ no doubt. </p>

<p align="center">Lastly, please be sure to check out our updated links page.&nbsp; And if
you have an EQ related site, or a<br>
guild page that is not listed, send it to <a href="mailto:emasuda@home.net">me</a> and
I'll link to it as well.</p>

<p align="center">BAD welcomes Zarkon as a full member by a unanimous vote. Also Malulani
returns<br>
to full membership status after taking a leave for personal reasons....<br>
I think.</p>

<strong><u>ICQ meeting</u></strong><br>
</font></p>
<font size="2" face="Arial">

<p align="center">We discussed that we would like to set up hunts, and would like for
everybody to help get ideas on how these should take place. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">Suggestion:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">Meet every other Saturday (the ones we don't
have the meetings) at 1PM EST at East Freeport Docks and go from there. Wish list to be
mailed up front to whoever's gonna be in charge. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">We would want Hunting Masters and Hunting
Slaves.. any volunteers come forward !!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">*****</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">We also talked about the protocol to be
followed when people from other realms join EverQuest that we have not met before. The
idea is to get these people tagged, and allow them Baby BAD status for the initial period,
after which we can vote &lt;eg&gt;. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">*****</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">The application form has had a slight
facelift... there's a warning added that should prevent Wannabe-BADs from entering sponsor
names who are not aware of that fact. It leaves the applix to be <strong>Null</strong> and
<strong>Void</strong>! (as a well respected member put it eloquently)</font></p>
