<p><font color="#FF8040" face="Arial"><big>Ok, this page is not going to be anything
special.&nbsp; You won't see any fancy stuff here... and very little formating on top of
everything else.&nbsp; This is a hidden page, meant just for us currently in BAD.&nbsp; I
wanted a place where I could show you all a small piece of a very cool game.&nbsp; </big></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF8040" face="Arial"><big>So, why is Takumi never in EQ anymore? What the
heck is he doing that he has no time to visit Norrath?? Well... all of my time is now
spent in a game called Anarchy Online.&nbsp; It is currently still in beta testing, but
the release date has been set for June 24, 2001.... thats coming up very soon. &nbsp;
Ultimately what I would like to see is as many of you as possible playing Anarchy Online,
because I know that once you try it, EQ will be easy to forget about.&nbsp; </big></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF8040" face="Arial"><big>So far, there are still quite a few bugs in AO.
&nbsp; They have some real problems with crashing and such, but they are working hard on
it... and even with the problems, AO to me is far more fun, exciting, and addicting then
EQ ever was.&nbsp; Below is some links, some to screen shots and to a couple movies.
&nbsp; Take a look...&nbsp; and seriously give AO some thought.&nbsp; The game is going to
be great... and it is just made for clans.... </big></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF8040" face="Arial"><big>After you have a look at the stuff here, you
can check out the official AO site <a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com/">here</a>.</big></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF8040" face="Arial"><big>By the way, FYI these shots were taken while
playing in a 1280 x 960 screen resolution.</big></font></p>
