<p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00"><u>Recruitment Procedures</u></font></p>

<p align="left">The BAD Clan will always welcome new members who possess
humor and generosity, a helpful character, all combined with a great sense of
fairness, not only toward other Clan members, but toward all players we encounter.
&nbsp; BAD is a family, a gathering of friends
sharing similar interests who enjoy playing together online.
&nbsp; We want our new members to become a part of
that family and join the circle of friends.</p>

<p>A Recruit must not be a member of any other Guild in the game in which he or she has applied
for membership in BAD. &nbsp; If a particular
game-realm allows a player to have more than one character in that game, not
all characters need be identified (tagged) as a BAD, but they may not be
identified as a member of any other guild.</p>

<p>A prospective new Recruit must be sponsored by an existing BAD member in good standing.
 A BAD member may sponsor only one (1) Recruit at any time. &nbsp; The
responsibilities of the Sponsor are:</p>

<p> The Sponsor shall create and distribute
to all current BADs on the game-specific mailing list a letter introducing the
Recruit; describing the Recruit&#146;s characters and qualities; and in particular,
why the Sponsor believes that the Recruit should be made a member of the Clan.
&nbsp; Sponsors may, if they wish, collect a
personal statement from the Recruit on why he/she desires to become a BAD and
forward this statement with the Introductory Letter. The beginning of the Recruit&#146;s six-week Probationary Period is
calculated from the date of his/her Sponsor&#146;s Introductory Letter.</p>

<p>        The Sponsor is responsible for the Recruit during the six-week 
Probationary Period.  The Sponsor must be familiar with these Recruitment 
Procedures and must ensure that his/her Recruit reads the entire BAD Charter. 
 The Sponsor (1) shall ensure that his/her Recruit will be available in the 
game during the Probationary Period (if the Recruit will be on vacation or 
otherwise unavailable, the Probationary Period will be suspended and will 
resume once the Recruit returns to the game); (2) will ensure that the 
Recruit is tagged; (3) shall ensure the Recruit does not endanger BAD's 
reputation through any inappropriate behavior (the Recruit shall be subject 
to the same Disciplinary Procedures as outlined in this Charter); (4) shall 
arrange adventuring/hunting times so as to encourage and assist the Recruit 
in getting to know the three current Game Council members and as many of the 
other BADs as possible (this step is vital so that a majority of the game's 
active members will have the opportunity to vote on the Recruit's membership 
at the end of Probation); (5) shall endeavor to expose the Recruit to the 
Clan's style of play; (6) shall cultivate and encourage the Recruit's 
inclusion in any Guild Hunts or events; and (7) shall e-mail out &quot;Recruit 
Comment Reports&quot; at the two-week and four-week marks in the Recruit's 
Probationary Period to collect comments from BAD members on the progress of 
the Recruit which will help point out any potential trouble-spots or areas on 
which the Recruit may be counseled or encouraged.</p>
 
<p>A Recruit may expect whatever normal assistance and generosity traditionally 
bestowed or deemed appropriate by his/her Sponsor and the current BAD members
 in the game, but shall neither have access to the Clan Treasury, nor be obligated 
to contribute to it.</p>

</p>    At the end of the Recruit's six-week probationary period, the Sponsor 
shall initiate a Clan Vote by e-mailing a ballot to the current game-specific 
mailing list. The Recruit shall be made a full voting-member in good standing 
upon receiving a 100% &quot;Yes&quot; vote from all members voting.  Every Clan member 
in the game has a duty to become familiar with the Clan's current Recruits, 
and to endeavor to spend enough time with the Recruit(s) so as to feel 
qualified to vote upon his/her membership in the Clan.  However, members may 
abstain from voting if they have been absent from the game or do not know the 
Recruit well enough to feel qualified to vote.  The Recruit must receive 100% 
approval from all those members who HAVE submitted a vote.  Any members who 
vote &quot;No&quot; must include on their ballot an explanation of why they believe the 
Recruit is not qualified for membership.  Votes must be submitted to the Game 
Council for compilation and final tally.  If any any &quot;No&quot; votes are received, 
the Recruit will be immediately untagged.  A Recruit may reapply for 
membership in BAD after one month and restart the Recruitment Procedure.</p>

<p>Once a Recruit has been voted upon and elevated to full membership status, the Game Council
shall immediately add the new member to the game-specific mailing list; shall
announce the new member by e-mail to the current game mailing list; shall
disclose the password of any password-protected Clan locations; shall add the
new member&#146;s name to the Membership List on the game-specific website; and
shall make whatever other formal welcome deemed appropriate.</p>

<p align="left"><u>Membership Rules of the Road</u></p>

<p>1. It is the duty of all Clan members to participate in the improvement of BAD.</p>

<p>2. A member CANNOT refuse to help another Guild member. 
He must -- within reason -- drop whatever he is doing and come to the
aid of the fellow Clan member (unless he is currently in the process of helping
another member).</p>

<p>3. If a fellow member has suffered an in-game catastrophe such as death or severe loss of
equipment due to a technical bug or crash, it is the Clan&#146;s responsibility to
assist their fallen comrade in whatever way possible.</p>

<p>4. BAD&#146;s purpose has never been about in-game profit; Clan members are not encouraged to
sell items to other BAD members. Clan members have always been generous with their own belongings, their time and
their assistance, and all members may expect such generosity to continue.&nbsp; If a particular item or Treasury funds are
needed, a member may apply at any time to the Game Council for assistance.
&nbsp; If appropriate, the Game Council may call a Guild-Hunt to acquire needed items or funds.</p>

<p>5. No BAD Clanmember shall be an employee of any gaming company in which the BAD Clan has a
presence without informing the Game Council. Instances of such employment will be decided by the Council on a
case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>6. Any Clan member with a complaint or dispute shall address such issues to the Game
Council of the realm in which they play. The Game Council will conduct an appropriate investigation and endeavor
to resolve the issue to the satisfaction of the member(s) involved.
&nbsp; If resolution cannot be reached at the Game
Council level or if the issue has Guild-wide ramifications, the Game Council
will consult the Grand Council to assist in the settlement.
&nbsp; If the Grand Council is deadlocked on
resolution, the matter will be taken up by the Grand Elder Council and a
decision will be made. &nbsp; Decisions of the
Grand Elder Council are final and binding. </p>

<p>7. BAD Clan
leadership is based on democratic principles. &nbsp;
Members are expected to exercise their choice on Election Day.
&nbsp; Dissatisfied members are welcome to air
their grievances as outlined in this Charter. 
Public insubordination or irresponsible accusations against duly elected
leaders or members in good standing will not be tolerated and may result in
discipline, including Probation or Banishment. </p>

<p>8. The Colors
of the BAD Clan are Red, Black and Silver. </p>
