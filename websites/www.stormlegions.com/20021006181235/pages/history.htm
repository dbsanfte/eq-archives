          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00"> Formed at the very conception 
            of the Stormhammer server, Stormlegions was created as a way to gather 
            friends, both old and new, together for the new adventures that awaited 
            us on Legends.<br>
            </font><font color="#FFFF00"><br>
            Hawkonen Spiritweaver, a Barbarian Shaman of questionable skill and 
            leadership abilities, although making a fine drunk, stood before the 
            new Gods, raised his voice to be heard above the din of folks from 
            across many lands, gathered a few together and spoke the words the 
            Gods must hear. They granted him the power to gather like folks amoungst 
            himself and called them the Storm Legions. <br>
            <br>
            Hawkonen's rule was short lived, as he was not happy in the role of 
            a Leader. Perhaps because the "spirits" (maybe even those that can 
            be found at any local pub), had spoken to him in regards to his true 
            role as heyokah. It was time, in any event, for him to place the mantle 
            on someone else's shoulders. In his wisdom he sought out a leader 
            who had the intelligence and forethought to command and, after a long 
            and arduous search he found an old friend that agreed to take the 
            role. <br>
            <br>
            Soloras Wardancer, Wizard of many seasons and a great thinker with 
            varied leadership skills, was well able to lead and accepted. <br>
            Hawkonen then became General of Legions, to guide the armies of Storm 
            Legions on their journies. <br>
            Soloras took stock of the situation surrounding his leadership, and 
            being great of mind and power took the stead with vigor. Soloras too 
            came to another crossing in his life and chose to follow the ways 
            of the Wizard. <br>
            <br>
            Leadership was then passed to a trusted member whose job was to simply 
            hold the mantle until a great druidess could be brought from her adventures 
            to take up her role. Soloras, in his great ways of foresight, agreed 
            to become Guild Advisor. A role more suited to him and his abilities. 
            <br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00">Our beloved Teke Tufang, great 
            Druidess and Queen of Legions, then became our leader. What glorious 
            days followed! Our expansion was vast. Friends gathered, warriors 
            and healers, those of spirit and mind, even evil came to be lead by 
            her! Our story really began with the induction of our Queen as our 
            Leader. Many great events and adventures are here for the telling 
            now, but this being a recount of history I find I must limit myself 
            to the facts regarding our Guild growth. <br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00">During her reign we saw many of 
            great honor and ability join our ranks, and others in our midst were 
            recognized with titles and duties. <br>
            Linlu Spiritweaver was promoted to Master at Arms. <br>
            Kuriel Sureshot was promoted to Guild Herald. <br>
            Rakyrn Shadowbane, later to become our Queen's betrothed and loving 
            husband, was made Concubine to our Queen. <br>
            Others were named officers and given titles, a full recount of which 
            can be found here and there. <br>
            Seeing as how there is no Guild Scribe that I can bring to mind, it 
            may be time to try and find one... <br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00">Even the greatest of Leaders has 
            it in them to carry on the duties and needs of their own choosing 
            and it came to pass that Teke had need to move on. A sad day this 
            was! A great search was put underway to find one who may allow the 
            Storm Legions to evolve and develope. <br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00">One was found, although the ramifications 
            of which are most likely to be far reaching. Change has a way of interjecting 
            itself where it may, and Lyrak De' Corrupter slithered, er, stepped 
            into the role. Ah, but what a way change has of stirring the pot, 
            eh? Evil incarnate, Lyrak now leads Storm Legions. His reign has yet 
            to be written, and the ramifications of his leadership are still being 
            developed, but his evil ways are a twist of fate that's neither good 
            nor evil. <br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00">Change is like that in most cases, 
            and the adventure begins anew. What stories will there to be told 
            now? <br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00"> We shall indeed see...</font></p>
