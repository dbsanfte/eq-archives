          <p align="left">Storm Legions is, simply put, a place for friends to 
            gather and play Everquest.</p>
          <p align="left">Our Guild is located on the Legends server, Stormhammer, 
            and was created within a day of Legends going live. We strive to create 
            an atmosphere of friendly role-playing, with diverse stories being 
            created and changed on a daily basis. Ongoing plots and twists are 
            an every day occurence in our Guild chat. A friendly place just to 
            talk about EQ and give advice to others, all within a Roleplaying 
            atmosphere first created by Teke Tufaang (Please see the <a href="history.htm">History 
            page</a> for further information). General discussions almost always 
            include skills and experience advice, as well as just general knowledge 
            being passed along from one player to another.<br>
            We've had a diverse existence on Legends, even with it being such 
            a new stomping ground for most, and our goal is to simply generate 
            a Guild for both those who are simply seeking a fun group of people 
            to associate with and those who are ready to hit the next phase of 
            gaming. Going more in depth into the world of Norrath and becoming 
            more serious about our adventures while still maintaining what some 
            might term as a 'newbie atmosphere'. All too often, larger or older 
            Guilds forget that Everquest is a game somewhere along the way, and 
            it becomes more of a chore. A hefty goal, to be sure, but we are hopeful 
            that we can accomplish this.<br>
            Our Guild roster is one of the larger on Stormhammer, albeit alot 
            of the characters in our Guild still maintain a presence in other 
            Guilds and/or on other servers... we still have a great number of 
            players associated with us. Degrees of experience amoung our members 
            is quite vast, and the diversity sometimes plays itself out in very 
            interesting ways to be sure.<br>
            Simply, we just wanna have fun while experiencing Everquest for all 
            it's worth. It IS a game, after all.</p>
