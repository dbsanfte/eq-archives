          <p><font size="+2">Raid Loot Rules</font></p>
          <p align="left">One Item Per Person (With Some Exceptions/Exclusions):<br>
            1. <font color="#00CCFF">One Item Rule</font> - If you win an item, 
            you are out of all lotto's for the remainder of the raid unless everyone 
            has won an item, in which case everyone is again eligible for the 
            lottos. Before everyone has won an item, if something else drops later 
            in the raid and you would prefer to have it more than the item you 
            won, you may enter the lotto for the second item only if you can lotto 
            off the first item you won to the rest of the raiders. If the first 
            item that you won is a no drop item, it cannot be traded out of your 
            inventory and is therefore not something that can be re-lottoed. In 
            situations like this, the exception does not apply. <br>
            2. <font color="#00CCFF">Exceptions</font> - Other exceptions to this 
            rule are spells, quest/epic drops, and Planar/Quest BPs. <font color="#00CCFF"><br>
            Spells Drops</font> - Spells drop in lots of places, not just off 
            dragons. They're also tradable and worth far less than dragon loot. 
            Therefore, when spells drop, all people who can use the spell are 
            eligible for the roll regardless of items won thus far. <font color="#00CCFF"><br>
            Quest/Epic Drops</font> - In the case of epic quest drops, this should 
            be decided upon amongst the class that uses that item in an epic quest. 
            If four enchanters are in a zone, for example, and a piece of an enchanter 
            epic quest drops, not all the enchanters may want it. They can discuss 
            amongst themselves who could best use the item. In a case where more 
            than one could, a lotto will take place for the item, run by the Lotto 
            Master for the raid. <font color="#00CCFF"><br>
            Planar/Quest BP Drops</font> - These items are sufficiently rare enough 
            as drops and are therefore included in this special category. When 
            they drop everyone who can use the item is eligible for the lotto.<br>
            3. <font color="#00CCFF">Ultra-Rare Drops</font> - These will be considered 
            separate from all the other lottos. Just because you won armor or 
            a rare mace doesn't mean the losers of the lottos get to lotto on 
            something better that drops and is ultra-rare. This is everybody's 
            privilege and it's a rarity to get in on these lottos, so everybody 
            is included, regardless of what you've gotten so far in the day. However, 
            let's say you're a player who's the only one of your class in the 
            zone and five pieces of armor have dropped for your class and because 
            you were the only one of your class, you got them all by default. 
            That's great for you, but how is it going to make others feel when 
            you enter an ultra-rare lotto? The ultra-rare lottos are open but 
            if you've been winning things left, right, and center, try to exercise 
            a little restraint when it comes to the big draw. People might see 
            you as greedy if you enter, or have a lot more respect for you if 
            you withdraw which way you want to cross that line of perception with 
            people is your own choice to make. <br>
            4. <font color="#00CCFF">Common Drops</font> - In the case of certain 
            items dropping that are considered to be common, exceptions may be 
            made. For example, Elemental Binders are quite common on Hole raids. 
            If an item drops that all the members of a class feel is so common 
            that they wouldn't want to roll on it for fear of risking lotto placement 
            towards armor drops, it will not be counted towards armor drops and 
            will be rolled on equally between those that need it or can use it.
