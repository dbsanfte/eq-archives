          <p><font size="+1"><b>Raid Rules of Conduct (Cont.)</b></font></p>
          <p align="left">6. Raid Leaders - For every raid, there is a Leader. 
            The Leader has put a lot of work into the raid long before anybody 
            shows up for it. Show him or her the respect they deserve and follow 
            their direction and orders explicitly. The Raid Leader is the only 
            person who should be directing movement, pulls, downtime, etc. Those 
            of you who would like to lead a Raid, contact our Raid Coordinator 
            to discuss options. Also, take a moment to review the Raid Leader 
            responsibilities. As the Raid Leader, do not take it upon yourself 
            to handle Loot. Assign another for this task.<br>
            7. Drops - Complaining about the quality of drops will not be tolerated. 
            If you have done some preperations beforehand (like checking posted 
            links about the raid zone), you will know what drops to expect. If 
            you are not satisfied with the expected drops, loot, experience, etc., 
            don't sign up for the raid. It's that simple. Remember, just because 
            you think an item is less than "uber" does not mean that someone else 
            on the raid would not be delighted to have it. <br>
            8. Chat Channels - Before the raid begins, the Raid Leader will initiate 
            a private Raid Channel for the raid. All attendies will, upon their 
            arrival, be notified of this channel and will immediately join it. 
            This channel will be used for all general chatter pertaining to the 
            raid such as incoming messages, Leader orders, and so forth. Shout 
            and OOC will be kept clear for emergencies such as TRAIN & ZONE! During 
            larger raids, at the descretion of the Raid Leader, a second raid 
            channel may be opened which everyone will join but will be for the 
            exclusive use of the Raid Leader. <br>
            9. Looting - ONLY Group Leaders will loot, or if there is only one 
            group, then only the assigned person for loot. Group leaders then 
            inform the loot officer of any drops that need to be lottoed. Please 
            see the <a href="raid.htm">Loot Rules</a> for more specific information.</p>
          <p align="left">After the Raid:<br>
            1. Please, no whining and complaining about drops, loot, who got what, 
            etc. etc. This is EXTREMELY disrespectful and disruptive. Unfortunately, 
            not everyone will be pleased with the outcome of every raid. Be patient, 
            your time will come. Everyone will get their fair share in the long 
            run. <br>
            2. Any issues you had with the raid should be directed to the Raid 
            Leader and/or Raid Coordinator. These are the people best equipped 
            to respond to your concerns and questions.</p>
