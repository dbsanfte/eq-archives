          <p><font size="+1"><b>The Guild Rules:</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"> 1. Have fun <br>
            2. No begging of items, powerlevels, or money <br>
            3. No fighting in guild chat, if you have a problem get an officer 
            or send personal tells. <br>
            4. Respect your fellow member, they may save your life. <br>
            5. Please remember you have a tag on your name with the name Storm 
            Legions on it, when they see you and your actions they see more than 
            just you, they see all of us! So, always strive to make us proud and 
            be good to our guild tag, it speaks volumes of you..... even tho you 
            may not realize anyone notices. <br>
            6. Would like to have new members of no less than level 25 unless 
            special circumstances. This is for the good of the whole guild, ie: 
            more able to set up events for everyone. <br>
            7. Any new member who joins Storm Legions will be put on a 30 probationary 
            period for us to see how they are and for them to see how we are. 
            During that time either party can decide to end their membership with 
            no hard feelings. <br>
            8. Would like to have all new members sponsored by at least 2 members, 
            having had some time to group with the individual and seeing how they 
            play and general attitude. Then the sponsors could recommend membership 
            at that time.<br>
            <br>
            Treat your fellow guildie the way that you, yourself would want to 
            be treated! We are all here to play and have fun, so no childish or 
            rude behavior will be tolerated! We all want to find a place to call 
            home, and work on skills and fighting abilities, this can be such 
            a place! With fair play and a bit of kindness we can all find that 
            here amongst the ranks of the Storm Legions!</p>
          <p align="left">It is understood that disputes will arise between people. 
            Try to resolve the disagreement so that both parties are satisfied. 
            If you are unsure of what you should do in a particular situation, 
            contact an officer for guidance.<br>
            1) If you have a dispute with another member, please try to resolve 
            it in tells. <br>
            2) Do not air grievances against another guild member in guild chat, 
            regardless of whether or not that person is online at the time. <br>
            3) If you are unable to resolve the dispute, contact a guild officer 
            for help. If a situation arises which involves another guild, contact 
            a guild officer immediately</p>
          <p align="left">Good communication is essential to the process of evolving 
            as a group. This includes the feedback of ALL members - ingame, at 
            meetings, and on the Guild Forum Site - and ALL Guild members are 
            responsible for participating in the decision-making of the guild. 
            We may disagree at times, but we must and will continue to discuss 
            and resolve the issues.</p>
