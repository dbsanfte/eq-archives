          <p><font size="+1"><b></b></font><font size="+2">Raid Loot Rules</font></p>
          <p align="left">There are two main types of loot distribution used in 
            raids: 'Need Before Greed' and 'Greed Rolls'. 'Need Before Greed' 
            will be the standard for all raids unless noted in the initial raid 
            post in the forums by the Raid Coordinator.</p>
          <p align="left">Drops: <br>
            1. All rolls will be for characters in attendance on the raid. Rolls 
            to "twink" alternate characters not present on the raid are prohibited 
            in all rolls except 'Greed Rolls.' <br>
            2. If an item drops for a specific class(es)/race/Diety, it will be 
            lottoed off to the members of that class(es)/race/Diety that require 
            that item or can use that item ('Need Before Greed'). The only exception 
            to this is if one of the people who can use the item opts out of the 
            lotto. Items that are droppable, which no one wants will be held for 
            a 'Greed Roll' at the end of the raid. <br>
            3. By "require" we mean people that do not already have this item 
            and will actually equip or use the item, or need the item to fulfill 
            a quest. <br>
            4. There is always going to be some debate as to whether all classes 
            that can physically use the item should be allowed to. For example, 
            just because a Tranix Crown drops on a fire giant raid, does that 
            mean everybody should be allowed on the lotto when an enchanter could 
            possibly put it to the best use? To be fair, we are going to say that 
            people who can use an item, as listed by the description on the item 
            itself, can be entered into a lotto if they are actually going to 
            use the item. However, we would like to heavily stress that if you 
            know this is an item that you're not really going to use and that 
            a particular class is very excited about getting in on, please reconsider 
            whether you really want to get in on the lotto or not. If you are 
            a wizard and a sword drops that's great for rangers and druids but 
            happens to be ALL/ALL, do you really want to enter that lotto just 
            because you can? Be considerate of others and use good judgment and 
            some common sense. <br>
            5. People seen abusing this rule will not be invited on future raids. 
            The determination of this will be made by individual Raid Leaders 
            in conjunction with Guild Officers. This will include people who are 
            seen auctioning won items from the current raid or from raids in the 
            recent past. <br>
            6. If a different Loot Rule is going to be used by the Raid Leader, 
            this fact should be posted when the announcement for the raid is posted 
            in the forums. People are going to expect the 'Need Before Greed' 
            rule so if you're leading a raid and you are not going to use it, 
            make sure you state this clearly beforehand so people can decide whether 
            they want to come on the raid. <br>
            7. All cash items (jeweled necklaces, opal bracelets, etc. - basically 
            things that sell for a lot but can't be used for any other purpose 
            such as jewel craft) go to the Raid Leader. The Raid Leaders will 
            see that this is distributed to reagent casters and used to cover 
            any other costs associated with the raid.</p>
          <p align="left">'Greed Rolls' will be held at the end of the raid. Those 
            who have yet to win anything are eligible for the rolls or, if everyone 
            has won something, it will be open to all who care to try. You can 
            roll for your own greed. You can roll and hand the item over to the 
            Guild Vault or to a friend. You can roll and then try to turn a profit, 
            or you can roll and give it away to your twink. It is a greed roll, 
            plain and simple.</p>
