          <p><font size="+1"><b>Raid Rules of Conduct</b></font></p>
          <p align="left">These are the general expectations we have for those 
            attending raids and these rules are NOT suggestions. Our Raid Coordinator, 
            in conjunction with our Guild Officers will enforce these rules. Violations 
            of these rules can lead to one or more, in any combination, of the 
            following:<br>
            <br>
            · Forfeiture of loot rolls.<br>
            · Being asked to leave the raid.<br>
            · Not being invited on future raids.</p>
          <p align="left">Before the Raid:<br>
            1. Read and understand both the Raid Rules of Conduct and <a href="raid.htm">Loot 
            Rules</a>. These will be standard for any and all raids unless specifically 
            noted when the raid is first posted. <br>
            2. Read the raid information page that is posted on the forum. <br>
            3. Have any items required by the Raid Coordinator. <br>
            4. Ensure that you have the appropriate levels/resists required by 
            the Raid Coordinator. 5. Be on time! Plan ahead to be at the raid 
            formation location at the correct time, the correct time being 15 
            to 30 minutes before the raid start time. You are late if you are 
            there at the raid start time. <br>
            6. Make sure you have the time required by the Raid Coordinator/Raid 
            Leader. Any exceptions to this need to be discussed with the Raid 
            Coordinator or Raid Leader beforehand. </p>
          <p align="left">During the Raid: <br>
            1. Experience - We try our best to insure that everyone gets experience 
            during our hunts, but raids are a different matter. Please understand 
            that in larger raids (and for that matter, most raids) with a variety 
            of groups and levels, which are organized for the acquisition of specific 
            items, that not everyone will get the same amount of experience. Some 
            may not get any, depending on the amount of creatures involved in 
            the raid and in reaching the main objective. If you are on one of 
            these raids and you don't seem to be getting as much experience (or 
            any) as some of the other attendies, lend your support, have fun, 
            and be patient. There will be future raids where you may be the one 
            getting the experience and you will expect the others to continue 
            on without complaint too. Also, you can rest assured that there will 
            be many hunts organized specifically to gain experience and levels. 
            2. Corpse Recovery - Expect to remain on the raid until all corpses 
            are recovered. Everyone will actively participate in corpse recovery 
            and resurrection. <br>
            3. Have Assist Hotkeys Made - It is your responsibility to make both 
            a main and secondary assist key. You must ALWAYS assist the designated 
            person. Who you are to assist will be decided and announced by the 
            Raid Leader. Enchanters/Bards should also use this key, so as NOT 
            to mesmerize the target being attacked. If Enchanters/Bards (or anyone 
            for that matter) do happen to notice someone who is NOT assisting, 
            notify the Raid Leader immediately. If you do not know how to set 
            up hot keys, ASK before the raid date, NOT as the raid is being formed.<br>
            4. Those Pesky People - If you notice someone attending/joining the 
            raid that you have issues with, share your concerns privately and 
            in a respectful manner with the Raid Leader. <br>
            5. Pullers/Trackers - Do not be constantly asking about mobs being 
            up or asking to have certain mobs pulled. This is irritating and disrespectful 
            to the puller/tracker. Pullers and trackers know their jobs and know 
            what mobs are available/able to be pulled. Do NOT pull mobs on your 
            own. This will get you removed from a raid. </p>
