The great high elven seers allowed me to delve deep into their libraries and pour over countless tomes, for I am meticulous in my accounts of those deeds that we may callheroic. I also was able to interview some High elfs who still remembered the dark times. ~<br>
~ The erie thing about elven lore is it has a magic of its own and I shall share a bit with you as I sing my song. ~<br>
<br>
~ Almost an age ago when before the isles of Kunark had been rediscovered or the moon explored and even before the icy lands of Velious had been reached by the ever enterprising gnomes. ~<br>
~ The solid lands of Norrath were ruled by 2 Kingdoms the High elven city of Felwithe and the dwarven stronghold of kaladim. ~<br>
~ The great Barbarian Halas Winterspear had yet to lead his people down from the icy crags and come to the area and form what we now know as Qeynos. Man had yet to become part of the history of Norrath and the world was still young. ~<br>
~ The high elves delved deep into the magical arts and the dwarves into their mountains. One seeking enlightenment, the other seeking the light of gems. These two great kingdoms did not always see eye to eye, but decided to leave well enough alone and deal with their own probelms and ignore the other. ~<br>
~It was in this time that a young high elf Magi did the unthinkable, he put personal gain ahead of the elven people and this broke the high elves most cherished law ~<br>
~ This high elf though did not make this mistake in a blinding action of greed or power, he did it for love, and love did blind him and in the end it would drive him made~<br>
~ The young magi was in love with the fairest of elven females, and he could hardly look upon her without turning his eyes downward, for her beauty was painful to bear~<br>
~ In fact all who saw her cast eyes south, for that is what one does when in the presence of a princess, Princess Firona Vie, 1st daughter of Grand Emperor Felwithe Vie. ~<br>
~ Many brave High elfs offered riches and devoted their lives to the princess to attain her hand in marriage, but poor Firona was a spirited lass who could not be tamed by meare trinkets and baubles, but her fathers eyes began to weigh her down and so she made a proclimation ~<br>
~ The princess would give her hand in marrige to the one who could show her what the true meaning of love really is ~<br>
~ The Emperor had his grand mage craft a torch that was magicaly linked to his daughters heart, and the moment she felt true love it would erupt in red flame ~<br>
~ Years passed and many came forward, citing poetry and songs, recounting historic deeds, and placing dragons heads and long lost artifacts at her feet, but the torch stayed cold, and so did poor Firona's heart. ~<br>
~ During this time our young Magi had been working night and day for years trying to solve this riddle of the Princesses heart, and when he thought he had discovered how to win her love he set about to accomplish this task, and in so doing the world of Norrath would be changed forever.~<br>
~ The young magi wandered deep into the thick forrest of the Faydark, and after he traveled sometime he finally came upon his distant kin of the woodelves. The woodelves were smaller and more lithe than there high elf cousins, and where the high elves place magic and knowledge above all else the wood elves loved nature and song. ~<br>
~ The young magi went into the small village which was not yet high up into the trees, but a few thatched huts with the center hut belonging to Kelethin Windsaber ~<br>
~ The wood elves were deep into their merry making and the young Magi passed through them unoticed as he wore a cloak of invisability. The young magi found what he sought, in the corner just covered by the shadows sat a small woodelf maiden who was caught between that age where playing the mud was still fun, but combing your hair to look nice for a young male would be fun also. ~<br>
~ The young magi cast a spell of morf upon himself and turned into a strapping young woodelf and soon was wooing the young female with his heavily charm laced words. Soon the young maiden was drunk and smiling dumbfoundedly at anything the young male would say ~<br>
~ The fake woodelf male lured the young maiden into a secluded grove, where they began the chant of love making, and while the young maiden was seeing nothing but blistful happinies, she did not see the small curved dagger that the fake woodelf pulled out from underneath his robes ~<br>
~ The woodelf illusion plunged the dagger deep into the female woodelfs heart, and since the fake woodelf had already cast silence, the young maidens final death screams were never heard. The maidens blood seeped out of the deep wound and the young magi who had now shed his decietful cloak of disguise, began to chant deep intoning symbols as he placed a vial at the wound and allowed the life essence of the poor girl to fill the small crystal vile. ~<br>
~ The young magi giddy with excitement left quietly and did not even try to bury or conceal the young maidens dead body, and he did not notice that with the faint darkening of his sould, so did he darken ~<br>
~ The young magi now knew that he could seek the princesses hand in marrige, and so he began the painful art of transforming the woodelfs life force into a potion, a potion that would show her just how much she ment to him and just how much he loved her. ~<br>
~ Try as he might the lifes force would not transform, it glowed its soft green essence and the young magi was growing restless, perhaps more of the woodelfs kins blood was needed to empower the potion. this made the young magi set out till 100 unknow deaths deep in the faydark had occured and to this day the woodelfs do not celebrate during these 100 days, instead they hunt and kill evil anywhere within their forrests to make sure this evil does not happen again. ~<br>
~ By this time the young magi had become a bit mad, and had secluded himself away in his tower and taken no food and no water, and night and day he worked on his grand design until one night he came upon a discovery ~<br>
~ Half asleep and starving, with shaking hands he took a dagger; the very same dagger that had killed so many woodelfs and acidently cut himself. The young magis blood fell into a urn he had been using to heat the properties of the woodelfs blood, upon the small mixture of blood he her a small melodic tune of a woodelf flute playing ~<br>
~ Wondering if he had truly gone mad, the young magi squeezed another few drops into the urn and the blood began to spark as the magics of the two bloods mixed. He elighted with joy and slashed both his wrists allowing his life force to pour into the urn and he chanted the mystical symbols of his dark spell all the while his very life force was pouring out of him, another dark essence was filling inside of him until nothing elven remained inside of him, nothing High Elven that is. ~<br>
~ So it was that on the last autumn day of wanning, that the long line of presenters were finally reaching an end and Firona could once again escape this never ending facade of happles suitors. Until a robed figure was the last to confront her, and in a chillingly raspy voice, the robed figure said.<br>
&quot; My dear princess long have I sought to solve, your riddle of love, and win your heart, so that we may both live with one another and be happy for all time&quot;<br>
The young princess intrigued leaned forward and spoke to the robed figure.<br>
&quot; You speak of pretty words and of a fond future, but pray tell me or show me, what is the true meaning of love?&quot;<br>
The dark robed figure cackled to himself and with his raspy voice spoke to the princess.<br>
&quot;Love is nothing without trust, love is nothing without hope to guide it, love is nothing without sacrifice...above all else love is sacrifice&quot;<br>
~ On these last words the torch in the center of the room which had lay dorment for so many years now came to life in brillant red flame, and the beautiful Princess smiled upon the robed figure and said ~<br>
&quot; Oh stranger who hast challenged my heart and succeded where i thought none would, yes...yes, sacrifice is what love is for if we do not sacrifice for the greater good of love then why would we need to love. I would sacrifice all for my love and I would hope the same from he who loved me&quot;<br>
~ On this the robed figure threw down a curved dagger with dried blood at the feet of the princess and said ~<br>
&quot; I above all else understand what you mean, for I have sacrificed all for my love for you, I sacrificed that which made me elven and I became something that even the high elfs of lore could not hope to attain. I attained perfection and have transformed myself for your love, so that I may love you for all time and you will be with me for all time.&quot;<br>
~The robed figure produced a small crystall vile of dark purplish liguid~<br>
&quot;Here drink this. said the robed figure and let our love be joined forever&quot;<br>
~Firona glanced down at the dagger and crinkled her nose and in a far off voice spoke to the robed figure~<br>
&quot;What blood stains this dagger? and I hope that you did not hurt yourself to gain my love for it would pain my heart to know that you were pained over me&quot;<br>
~The robe figure cackles and speaks in almost histarical tones~<br>
&quot;do not worry I had to slay a few woodelves toattain the proper mixture to become what I am, and what I have become is much more then I ever could have imagined&quot;<br>
~Princess Firona shrieks and kicks the dagger back at the robed figure nearly knocking him over~<br>
&quot;SLAIN?!? you killed innocents over me? why? how many? shrieked the princess&quot;<br>
&quot;what does it matter? a 100 woodelevs I believe, It was all for the sacrifice of love...THE SACRIFICE OF LOVE !!! rasped the robed figure&quot;<br>
~With that the robed figure pulled back his cowl that had been hiding his face, and showed what he had become. His skin was as dark as glass obsidian and his blood red eyes were sunken and narrow. His features were more feral than elven, and 2 long canines portruyed from his mouth.~<br>
~Firona saw this and fell back away from this monstrosity and shrieked in terror, The Emperor leaped to is feet and order the high guard to slay this devil from the abyss~<br>
~The young suitor looked on with bewilderment wondering why everyone feared him so, could they not see how beautiful he had become, how he radiated golden light wherever he stepped, could they not hear the sweet songs of woodelves playing wherever he looked~<br>
~The you suitor walked forward and held a hand out to the princess but a blade came down upon it and cut off his blackend hand. The pain that shot up the suitors arm was unbearable, and yet the sight of blood sent a demonic urge in him to rip the gurads head from his shoulders and lap his tounge at the sweet fluids escaping from the wound~<br>
~and so with not even a thought the young suitor had brutally slaughtered all twelve of the high guards and his maw now covered with the bright red essence of the slain stalked forward to clainm his prize~<br>
&quot;you said you loved me, you said you understood sacrifice, cant you see I did all this for you I became something more than a meare elf, I became a god and I want you to be my goddess and together we will rule this world and pluck from it whatever our hearts desire&quot; Rasped the Dark elf<br>
&quot;I know you not and I do not love you, look upon the torch if you do not believe me, I am sickened by you and you do not understand sacrifice, for you did none of this for the glory of love, you pretended and all the while you sought a love a power, no matter how you try to reason it, your first love is power&quot; said the princess.<br>
~The feral gaze of the demonic elf fell upon the now dormant torch and he knew the princess to be right~<br>
&quot;perhaps you do not love me now, but I will make you love me!&quot; yelled the demonic elf<br>
~ with this last word the demonic elf lunged forward and took up the princess in arms that could rip tree trunks from the ground, and glared at the ceremonial hall~<br>
&quot;The princess is mine, and any who come for here shall meet a fate worse than death. This I swear upon that what is last of my elven life..I swear it upon my name....Mayong Mistmoore !!!!&quot; intoned Mayong.<br>
~and then in a flash of brimstone smoke Mayong andthe princess were gone ~<br>
