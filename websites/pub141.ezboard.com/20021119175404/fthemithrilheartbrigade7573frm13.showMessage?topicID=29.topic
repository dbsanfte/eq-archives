I 'bout fell outta me chair when I read this.  Absolutely priceless.<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
So there I was.....minding my own business in The Overthere, when all of a sudden I see the message: &quot;d00d sow plz&quot;.<br>
<br>
Of course, my natural instinct was not to answer, since I thought the clueless newb (hereafter referred to politely as &quot;the petitioner&quot;) must have been poorly informed at best.<br>
<br>
Boy was I ever wrong.<br>
<br>
I switch out of 1st person into an external camera, and what did my wandering eyes behold? Only myself and the petitioner.<br>
<br>
So I says to myself....&quot;Self? You need to edumacate this fella!&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
(Keep in mind what the overall setting looked like: There I was, in skeleton form, carrying a scythe, FLOATING IN MIDAIR IN A MEDITATING POSITION, with a LARGE dark-brown skeleton named &quot;Gibober&quot; standing behind me. Ummm....No, skippy, I'm not a druid or a shaman.)<br>
<br>
I say &quot;Wish I could, bro, but I don't have SoW. I'm a Necromancer.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Petitioner says, &quot;$#*&amp;@#$ dick, sow me already! it's for a cr&quot;<br>
<br>
Feeling as if my feathers had been ruffled a bit, I do a &quot;/who all dumbass&quot; (um..pardon..I meant &quot;/who all petitioner&quot;)<br>
<br>
This is where I discovered the &quot;/who all&quot; bug. Certainly it must have been a bug, right? There's NO WAY IN CREATION the dumbas...err...petitioner could have been a level 31 Dark Elf Wizard, right???? RIGHT????? /em begins to cry like a little girl.<br>
<br>
Well, needless to say, I couldn't have been any more shocked than if my pet began dancing an Irish Jig. I quickly begin the arduous task of maintaining my composure, while deciding how best to deal with this tricky situation.<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Necromancer's can't cast SoW&quot;.<br>
<br>
Petitioner says, &quot;Bull@#$%! you cast a spell while you were running and you sped up! i couldn't catch you until you sat down! if you're not going to sow me just say so you dont have to be a dick about it a$$hole&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes I know....he didn't use any punctuation in that last sentence.<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;I have JBoots.&quot;<br>
<br>
He says, &quot;what are they&quot;<br>
<br>
Before I have a chance to pick my chin up off the floor....<br>
<br>
Petitioner asks, &quot;can you buff my hps my hp sux&quot;<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;I can't buff you, dude. I'm a necromancer. I only have one buff that you would probably want.&quot;<br>
<br>
He says, &quot;yeah the one you won't give me dick&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok. Time to have fun with the hopelessly clueless.<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Why do you need a sow?&quot;<br>
<br>
He says, &quot;i need to get to burned woods to hunt. sumbody said its perfect for my level&quot;<br>
<br>
Yep. That's what he said......&quot;burned woods&quot;.<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;man are you ever in the wrong place.&quot;<br>
<br>
He says, &quot;?&quot;<br>
<br>
Apparently he found the &quot;question mark&quot; key conveniently located nearby other various and sundry communication facilitators.<br>
<br>
I didn't answer him.<br>
<br>
He repeats, &quot;??&quot;<br>
<br>
Found it twice...good for him.<br>
<br>
He repeats, &quot;???&quot;<br>
<br>
Having an IQ greater than plantlife, I sensed a pattern forming.<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;You are NO WHERE near Burned Woods.&quot;<br>
<br>
He says, &quot;my friend told me it was in kunark&quot;<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Yeah, the operative word there is 'WAS'. There was a major patch a couple of months ago after a bunch of complaints were filed about 'static content'.&quot;<br>
<br>
He says, &quot;?&quot;<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;!&quot;<br>
<br>
He says, &quot;?&quot;<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;,&quot;<br>
<br>
He says, &quot;wtf&quot;<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;no, already have some.&quot;<br>
<br>
He says, &quot;????&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't respond.<br>
<br>
He says, &quot;so where the @#$% is burned woods&quot;<br>
<br>
He lost the question mark button again. Probably popped off when he was sniffing his feet.<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Well, THIS week it's south of Freeport. It changes with every patch, since they began randomizing zone locations.&quot;<br>
<br>
My guild is hysterical at this point. And I haven't even told them the ENTIRE story yet. Just snippets.<br>
<br>
He says, &quot;@#$% i just got off the boat&quot;<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;You don't need the boat.&quot;<br>
<br>
He says &quot;why&quot;<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;You're a wizard!&quot;<br>
<br>
He says, &quot;how you know that&quot;<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;I did a /wh...nevermind....the important thing is you have teleportation spells.&quot;<br>
<br>
He says, &quot;oh yeah the green ones&quot;<br>
<br>
I nod.<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Yep. The 'green ones'. Pretty nice how you have them grouped by color.&quot;<br>
<br>
He says, &quot;thx&quot;<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;How'd you think about doing it that way?&quot;<br>
<br>
He says, &quot;they were all @#$%## up when i got this char&quot;<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Sit down and mem the spell 'Fay Gate'.&quot;<br>
<br>
He says, &quot;why&quot;<br>
<br>
Question mark key is on the ground in front of your chair, guy. Mixed in with your collection of boogers.<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;It's going to put you within spitting distance of Burned Woods.&quot;<br>
<br>
He says, &quot;how do you know&quot;<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;All patch messages come with a zone connection map.&quot;<br>
<br>
He says, &quot;oh&quot;<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Ok. You have it memmed now?&quot;<br>
<br>
He had just stood up after what I assumed was meditating/looking at his spell book.<br>
<br>
He says, &quot;yeah&quot;<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Ok. Cast the spell and let me know when you get there.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dumba...errr....Petitioner begins to cast a spell.<br>
<br>
A LONG time goes by.....ok, maybe 5 minutes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I still haven't heard from him.<br>
<br>
Getting curious:<br>
<br>
I tell petitioner, &quot;Are you there yet?&quot;<br>
<br>
No reply. No reply at all. [Yes, I'm a Genesis fan... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ]<br>
<br>
Obviously he's there, or my tell wouldn't have gone through.<br>
<br>
I tell petitioner, &quot;Hit the 'r' key to reply to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;i'm here now where do i go.&quot;<br>
<br>
Right idea....wrong punctuation mark. Oh well. &quot;C&quot; for effort.<br>
<br>
I tell petitioner, &quot;Ok, do you see a hotkey on the screen that says 'Sense Heading'?&quot;<br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;no&quot;<br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Hit the arrow buttons one by one until you see one.&quot;<br>
<br>
It was a guess, but an educated one.<br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;found it&quot;<br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Click on it.&quot;<br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;north&quot;<br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Ok, you need to head east along the path. Keep going until the path turns north. When it forks to the right, take the right fork.&quot;<br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;ok&quot;<br>
<br>
Who knows, maybe the guy who sold his account on Ebay worked his Felwithe faction up.<br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;sumbody told me i shouldnt be here cause i'm a dark elf&quot;<br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;They were roleplaying.&quot;<br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;oh hehe @#$%@#$ morons ;P&quot;<br>
<br>
Priceless. Utterly priceless, I tell you.<br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Where are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;i see something now. looks like a castle&quot;<br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Run into the castle as fast as you can. The guards might give you some trouble, just keep running.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah...damned conscience started kicking in.<br>
<br>
A fairly long period of time passes. Not sure how long, but longer than I was expecting.<br>
<br>
I tell petitioner, &quot;What happened?&quot;<br>
<br>
As if I didn't know....<br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;my spells are gone!&quot;<br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;What happened?&quot;<br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;i died <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  why&quot;<br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Oh man! Did I tell you to run east or west?&quot;<br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;east wtf???&quot;<br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Yikes. My bad. You should have run west.&quot;<br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;?&quot;<br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;So where are you now?&quot;<br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;how can i tell&quot;<br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Look right after you see 'Loading please wait'. It should tell you 'You have entered [zone]'.&quot;<br>
<br>
He replies &quot;it doesnt say [zone] there.&quot;<br>
<br>
After smacking my head against my monitor....<br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;What does it say in place of [zone]?&quot;.<br>
<br>
Get this....<br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;Burning Woods&quot;<br>
<br>
I nearly fell out of my chair! I couldn't have PLANNED it that way!<br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;is that the same as burned woods&quot;<br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;No, but you're close. Start running south so you can get your corpse back.&quot;<br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;i have to get my corpse back?????&quot;<br>
<br>
/ignore petitioner<br>
<br>
<br>
Moral of the story: EBay...Just Say No! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Out of sheer curiosity, I took him off ignore later to find out what happened.<br>
<br>
I tell petitioner, &quot;How's it going?&quot;<br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;wtf? where you been&quot;<br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;been afk, sorry.&quot;<br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;got my corpse back. some dude rezzed me.&quot;<br>
<br>
My conscience somewhat eased...<br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Really? Cool! Where are you now?&quot;<br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;iceclad ocean&quot;<br>
<br>
I scratch my head a few times.<br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Why Velious?&quot;<br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;the guy that rezzed me told me burned woods was in western wastes this week&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't recall exactly how long it took me to stop laughing. I stopped breathing shortly before my dog dialed 911.<br>
<br>
He replied, &quot;@#$%&amp;* wouldnt sow me either. what is that sh#$ gold?&quot;<br>
<br>
That's what finally killed me. I'm writing this from the afterlife.<br>

*sigh*<br>
Just yesterday i was meditating at work what is more evil: stupid or annoying people (in this case in relation to my job). I think it's the stupid ones. These are the ones who ask you for help because they don't know and then argue with you about your answer. Patience is what i learned here, not telling them (in CAPITALS) &quot;don't ask, just do as i told you, #*@$€&amp;&quot;.<br>
<br>
I wonder why people eBay an account without having the slightest clue of what they are doing.<br>
<br>
And just for cussing all the time i prolly would have talked him into duelling me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I would even bet money on Miharu (level 19) to beat his level 31 butt, just because i'm sure he would not even find the right spells to fight (yet even to target).<br>

<br>
1. <br>
Monk.  Red robe.  Essence of Dohl (red glowy fist). Book (monk usable, woot) off of some guy in Sarnak Fort in LOIL.  /anon  Sit in Tunnel.  Count number of &quot;please TL me&quot; and &quot;please TP me&quot;.  Current record in 58 requests in one hour.  If ignoring them doesn't work, and they come seek you out, Feign Death, tell them you died and will not be able to help them untill you get back to your body.  <br>
<br>
2. <br>
Go to freeport, gather up all the drowned people in the sewers.  Run to freeport gate where everybody is sitting cause it's safe.  Feign Death.  Enjoy the carnage as they rip through all the newbies.  The guards won't kill them, they are concidered citizens of freeport.  Anybody that would get experience loss is tuff enough to kill/survive, so there is nothing to weigh down your soul about killing people.<br>
<br>
3. <br>
If somebody casts bind site on you, and you know about it, (A) take a flying leap off of the nearest cliff/spire/anything tall enough to kill normal people.  Usualy get a scream factor of 8 or 9 out of this.  Especailly if you are looking down.   (B) gather a huge train, huge, 20-30 things, turn and look at them as they rush you.  Scream factor of 6 or 7 out of this.  Oh yea, don't forget to Feign them off before returning to group.  Kinda got in trouble for that once. <br>
