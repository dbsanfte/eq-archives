DAoC</span><hr size=1> Well. It seems most everyone that played EQ then went to DAoC and didn't like it played a paladin, I liked the game, I just couldn't get used to it like EQ. Though I have almost no friends at all, maybe.. three on any EQ servers, I liked it much more than DAoC. I was really looking forward to level 20 with my paladin for the armor though, currently she's level 19 and a half, I just don't wanna pay for her to reach 20. Another good thing was equipment. I mean, you can't even get good solo drops at level 50. And on DAoC you can start looting equipment that rivals store bought/player bought stuff at around 10th level. I guess that's what friends are for and all. But items are handed out in bulk in DAoC servers. Oh well, EQ is still better - another thing, what do you.. people think about PvP? My first character was a pvp and I hated not being able to trust anyone at all, I spent eighty percent of the time solo or grouping with my guild, the biggest iksar only guild, mind you. :P<br>
Anyways, thats why I like Povar so much! ^^<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S. I can't spell. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub50.ezboard.com/usupachamber.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SupaChamber</A> at: 6/21/02 1:49:26 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#665138><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub50.ezboard.com/ualexandrine.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alexandrine</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Familiar Face</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#DEB985>(6/22/02 8:13:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/feverquestpeoplefrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mysticlords.homestead.com/files/alex2.gif height=144 width=57></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ vrs.

<br>
For starts Laliana and I started playing DAoC recently and we really love it and what it has to offer.<br>
<br>
Dark Age of Camelt:<br>
<br>
For starts I am not really sure this game os for the hard core gamer, cus they will breeze right thru this, while EQ will keep you pinned down, constantly.  DAoC is a casual gamers game at some level, but I prefer playing that to EQ at the moment simply because I am really tired of the overwhelming penalties in EQ, which I will discuss later.<br>
<br>
For me at this juncture DAoC gives me exactly what I want for my money and enjoyment.  Simply because in comparison, Rangers are Archers and Woodsman, yet in EQ we are glorified warriors, which can cast spells, yet cant take damage.  In DAoC we are Archers and Woodsman, I mean with my bow I take half a creatures life away.  In EQ I might do anywhere from 1dmg to 24dmg with mithril champion arrows, using a Faydark Stinger, with 200 in Archery, I mean come on, thats STUPID.  So for me DAoC is the better contender for my class, sorry Verant, but you don't know how to make rangers yet, maybe you will get it right in EQ2.<br>
<br>
EverQuest:<br>
<br>
Has way too many penalties and they won't come down from their horses and stop forcing people to group, to really get anywhere.  If your gonna have something con in an area that I should be able to take, then let me take it.  If its something that I can slaughter, then let me do that, but all too tired of being buffed, and have C3 and get killed by a green or light blue, thats BS and I am tired of it.<br>
<br>
EQ example:<br>
<br>
*Kaitain tells Laliana* Look a wurm, and it cons dark blue, lets get it.  Hmmm well wait its a wurm though.<br>
<br>
*Laliana tells Kaitain* Well lets try it.<br>
<br>
*Kaitain tells Laliana* ok pulling it.<br>
<br>
[5 minutes later]<br>
<br>
*Kaitain shouts* Looking for ress, for 2, will pay.<br>
<br>
So right now I am a angry EQ player and want to quit, simplt because DAoC from what I know about it for me personally, it appeals to my style and is something that makes my gaming world a lot less stressed. <p><center>

In fact the more I hear about changes in EQ(Like firing a whole bunch of GM's and not trying to replace them) the more I'm glad they're not getting any money from my account.<br>
I can group if I want, or I can group. Both is viable and possible.<br>
Trade Skills own over EQ hands down.<br>
Not having to get to my corpse before it rots w/ all my gear in a dangerous spot definitely deserves a thumbs up as well. If I die I can go to my grave and pray if I choose. If its too dangerouse I don't have to go pray.<br>
And let me say RVR has a special place in my heart... I am such an RVR freak I've been able to talk keep raids into taking a lvl 25 Theurg along. A raid of people in their high 40's up to 50 taking me along because I *CAN* contribute. Although most players lvl 25 wouldn't even try. I'd probably have a lvl 40+ char now if I hadn't hopped server to server to be with friends. I was one of the first to get to experience RVR and to me its addicting. The challenges and going up against thinking people as opposed to AI. The different tactics used, the siege engines hiding under friars robes, the battering rams and catapults... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :drunk --><img src=http://jens-smileys.netfirms.com/newest/drunk.gif ALT=":drunk"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center> <a

Player made items are very good, and with the addition of spellcrafting(allowing you to enchant your weapons and armor with stats and spells that YOU want) -- they are going to get a WHOLE lot better.<br>
<br>
The latest patch they changed the level grind from 35-45. Making it easier. They also relaxed the grouping rules too allowing for lower levels group with higher levels and no one really gets a penalty. <br>
<br>
The biggest issue I have right now with DAoC is content. They have added alot since its opening, but it still lacks. All the dungeons are cut-n-pastes variants of the others. EQ dungeons at least had their own feel and atmosphere. DAoC dungeons sucks when compared to EQ. The best dungeon is Darkness Falls which you can only get into if your realms has the most keeps. They need more places like DF.<br>
<br>
DAoC is great for the casual gamer until lvl 36. Up to lvl 36 players have the option for PvP in the Battlegrounds. An area that is level restricted. So you get to fight people on an even playing field. After BG3(lvls 30-35) you're only option is the big leagues... RvR on the Frontier. And while you can contribute a little at 35... you can't be competitive till 45+. At 50 you get epic armor which essentially makes you about 35% tougher to kill. Its a huge difference between a lvl 49 and a lvl 50 with Epic. And the 45-50 lvl grind is where the casual gamers get left behind, because it is a grind. <br>
<br>
RvR is purely addicting, but when you get to lvl 50 and thats all there is left... it can get old. The XP grind is replaced with the RP(realm point) grind trying to get that next Realm Ability. <br>
<br>
Looking forward to the expansion pack as it will add two new classes and one new race to each realm along with an improved graphics engine. The word from the beta testers is that this new engine is awesome in regards to the current problems of tons of players on your screen causing frame rate issues. Should make large keep/relic raids more enjoyable. <br>
<br>
And then there is Mythic. Despite a lot of negativity they get from players... they really are a stand up developer always trying to make the game better for the players. They maintain the Camelot Herald which is the slickest thing ANY developer has done for their game. They do a Q&amp;A every Friday. And some of the things they are adding in the game in the future are purely FOR the gamers. Perfect example is one of the future things they are adding is giving anyone who has a level 50 toon a &quot;head-start&quot; so to speak for any new Alts they make. Have a lvl 50? Make an alt it they automatically start at lvl 20.. or lvl 30... they havent decided yet. But its purely to ease on the lvl grind for players who have already done it once. You think you'd ever see Verant doing anything like that? Saving you the hassle of dealing with Orc Camps and the Oasis? I think not. <br>
<br>
I've been playing DAoC close to a year now and still play it darn near daily. Like Akasa, I have a slew of alts because each class in each realm has their own playstyle. And even then depending on how you specc gives certain classes multiple playstyles. Just to show you how many here is a list of the toons I have:<br>
<br>
Albion:<br>
50 Scout<br>
39 Cleric<br>
36 Infiltrator<br>
38 Sorceror<br>
13 Thuergist<br>
10 Cabalist<br>
<br>
Hibernia:<br>
28 Nightshade<br>
27 Ranger<br>
22 Champion<br>
18 Mentalist<br>
<br>
Midgard:<br>
45 Healer<br>
40 Skald<br>
27 Shadowblade<br>
17 Runemaster<br>
11 Warrior<br>
<br>
And the sad thing is... there are still a ton of classes I HAVENT played! Here is a small list:<br>
<br>
Albion:<br>
Minstrel<br>
Mercenary<br>
Paladin<br>
Armsman<br>
Wizard<br>
Friar<br>
<br>
Hibernia:<br>
Hero<br>
Blademaster<br>
Warden<br>
Enchanter<br>
Eldritch<br>
Druid<br>
Bard<br>
<br>
Midgard:<br>
Beserker<br>
Thane<br>
Shaman<br>
Spiritmaster<br>
Hunter(actually I had a hunter but deleted and made my Runemaster)<br>
<br>
Then with the expansion pack comes out, I'm definately going to try the new classes. There is still a lot of life left in DAoC, and Mythic has a lot of stuff they intend to add in the future. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#665138><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub141.ezboard.com/ukaitainshadowhawke.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaitain Shadowhawke</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Laliana's Blessed <br> Thunderbolt of Tunare</span><br>  Posts: 388<br> <font color=#DEB985>(10/6/02 10:58:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/feverquestpeoplefrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ</span><hr size=1> I agree they are doing so much more then EQ and yes content is a issue, but I think once they get on their feet after this next expansion, DAoCs content will explode.

We are Hibernian and she plays a warden and I am a ranger, and I also tried the Eldritch which rock, I love it so much.  But we still play EQ at times, simply because we have friends there.  But as a game, DAoC is a great game and its only getting better. <p><center>

<br>
Kaitain, you'll love the ranger. Best archer out of all three realms. They are a fun class. As a Scout I loathe Wardens and their pulsing bladeturn. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://jens-smileys.netfirms.com/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Im sure you two love to hunt together. A great Hibernian combo in PvE AND RVR is the Bard and Hero. Heros are the best tank in the game. Hard to believe since they are from the Magical Realm, but IMO they are. Check out the Camelot Herald and look at the different servers. And look at the Top RP earners for Hibernia on the servers. I bet if you see a Hero there... you'll see a bard from the same guild close to them. No deadlier non-stealth 2 man RvR team in the game IMO. Bard is the key...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Bard Speed allows hit, kill, and run. <br>
Bard Mez<br>
Bard DD Shout &lt;great for interupts&gt;<br>
Bard Endurance Regen while Hero uses styles to kill.<br>
Bard Buffs<br>
Bard Heals<br>
<br>
I know its effective because I have been on the recieving end of this duo many times both on my Midgard Servers and my Albion Servers.<br>

They're kinda the same, but take a different set of taste buds.<br>
<br>
I *love* camelot. Its a very beautiful world, but it lacks content. It also lacks the one thing that put me back to EQ.<br>
<br>
A better 1st person view. I know this may sound like nitpicking, but I don't feel &quot;immersed&quot; in camelot the way I do with EQ, which is what I want. <br>
<br>
Just something as simple as your view moving slightly and seeing your arms whiz by as you swing your weapons, that makes the difference for me. It took me 8 months, a level 50 character, and 9 level 35ish characters from different realms to figure out what that &quot;thing&quot; was that was missing. <br>
<br>
They're both great games, but for now, I choose EQ. I kept my account active for the expansion in Camelot and will give it another shot, but for now, EQ it is. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=312137">Sshaithis</A> / <A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=408738">Meina</A></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/feverquestpeoplefrm46.showMessageRange?topicID=3.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/feverquestpeoplefrm46.showMessageRange?topicID=3.topic&start=41&stop=41>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub141.ezboard.com/feverquestpeoplefrm46.showPrevMessage?topicID=3.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub141.ezboard.com/feverquestpeoplefrm46.showNextMessage?topicID=3.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/feverquestpeoplefrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.jennymarie.com/otherreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/feverquestpeoplefrm46.emailToFriend?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/feverquestpeoplefrm46.threadControl?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/feverquestpeoplefrm46.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/feverquestpeoplefrm46.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub141.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="everquestpeoplefrm1">Getting To Know You<option value="everquestpeoplefrm2">Game Related Chatter<option value="everquestpeoplefrm3">Fan Faires<option value="everquestpeoplefrm4">The Photo Album<option value="everquestpeoplefrm6">Guild Chat<option value="everquestpeoplefrm7">Rants....<option value="everquestpeoplefrm9">Server Discussion<option value="everquestpeoplefrm10">Povar - Home Sweet Home<option value="everquestpeoplefrm11">Techie Stuff<option value="everquestpeoplefrm13">General Gab<option value="everquestpeoplefrm14">Eastern - US<option value="everquestpeoplefrm15">Western - US<option value="everquestpeoplefrm16">Central - US<option value="everquestpeoplefrm17">Canada<option value="everquestpeoplefrm18">Europe and Asia<option value="everquestpeoplefrm19">Australia and New Zealand<option value="everquestpeoplefrm21">Alaska & Hawaii<option value="everquestpeoplefrm29">Photo Archives<option value="everquestpeoplefrm30">Community Toilet<option value="everquestpeoplefrm33">The Living Room <option value="everquestpeoplefrm34">The Doorway<option value="everquestpeoplefrm35">The Lounge <option value="everquestpeoplefrm37">Funny Pages!<option value="everquestpeoplefrm38">Ottawa Tavern<option value="everquestpeoplefrm39">The Playhouse<option value="everquestpeoplefrm40">Webcam Central<option value="everquestpeoplefrm43">Title Requests<option value="everquestpeoplefrm46">Other Games</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#DEB985>- </font><a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/beverquestpeople>Everquest People</a><font color=#DEB985> - </font><a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/feverquestpeoplefrm46>Other Games</a> <font color=#DEB985> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.92<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
