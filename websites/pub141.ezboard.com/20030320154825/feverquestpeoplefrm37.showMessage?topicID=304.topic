<br>
I do not know the gentleman.. but the story was to cute and I had to share with you guys too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://jens-smileys.netfirms.com/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;The &quot;Owwie&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, I posted this tale on my guild message board, and many members urged me to embarass myself on a much broader scale. For those that dont know....Hi, I am Psycra, and here is my tale.<br>
<br>
Backstory: A few things you should know to help you understand how I get myself into these types of situations.<br>
<br>
First off, I sleep very, very deep. I have my entire life. It takes huge amounts of efforts to get me up, and for the first 10 minutes or so, I am in a state of awake/sleep. I can function during this time, but its mainly instinctive, built-in survival functions that work. For example, I could go to the bathroom, sit on the can, get a cup of coffee, walk and, with some mild effort, I can stand. Thats about it tho, the rest of the higher level brain functions have yet to awake, and so I am pretty much worthless during this 10 minute period.<br>
<br>
Secondly, my li'l 4 year old girl is the most caring, protective being that has ever been placed on this planet. If her daddy gets an &quot;owie&quot;, he receives numerous kisses (usually with her lipstick caked on), as well as &quot;Whinnie-the-Poo&quot;, or &quot;Little Mermaid&quot; bandaids. <br>
<br>
She knows that some &quot;owies&quot; are constant, as I have a very bad knee(football injury), and it aches alot when the weather changes. One mention of this, and out come the bandaids and kisses. To illustrate this point a tad further, a more detailed example is presented. Just recently, a nice zit was just forming on my shoulder, and she spotted it as I innocently slept. Upon waking up, and after getting past the comatose stage of my being, I found it, the &quot;mark&quot; of my daugher. She had placed 6 bandiads in a criss-cross pattern around this growing menace of a pimple!<br>
<br>
Let me ramble at this point, and sidetrack just a tad. You see, life is not fair, as nature clearly punishes us males in a sense, as it seems like when we are 16, we are praying for that wonderful chest hair, or paradise trail to sprout up, take hold, and vault us from boyhood, into manhood. We think nothing of the mop of hair on our heads, as it grows at a break-neck pace in like 4 days. However, we age to a certain point, and the &quot;hair&quot; equilibrium gets all out of whack. We seem to start losing the mop, and due to the unwritten, but scientifically proven &quot;hair balance algorithm&quot; of nature, we gain hair in other, shall I say, odd places. In my case, yes, I admit it, little sprouts of hair have wound up on my shoulders, at the expense of some of my precious mop. The balance remains, I have the same numbers of hairs I had when I was 16, its just that they decided to move from my head to ungodly places on my body.<br>
<br>
Well my daughter apparantly discovered this volcano on my shoulder, so when I wake up, I notice that there are 6 &quot;little mermaid&quot; bandaids which are well secured to my hair covered shoulder. Thats right, in order to remove the &quot;owie&quot; secured area, I had to suck it up, close my eyes, and aggressively rip these bandaids off. It was the cheapest, and most effective wax job ever, and I highly recommend this technique for our female players.<br>
<br>
Ok, with that vent out of the way, lets get back to the tale. Other factors which should be known before getting to the meat of the story are as follows:<br>
<br>
My wife and I run a Bed &amp; Breakfast along the McKenzie River, and the morning of what I shall refer to as the &quot;incident&quot;, we were completely booked out, with 20 people, who were, at the time, enjoying ther scrumpcious breakfast on the main deck and common dining room.<br>
<br>
The &quot;incident&quot; occurred on a Wednesday morning. As most of you know, Tuesday night is the night my wife and I pretend we are 20 again, and we plan a hot date night which consists of going to our favorite Jazz bar, and playing a nasty game of cribbage. We add a bit of spice to this experience, as we are both highly competitive individuals. The loser of the game must slam a Yeager-meister. A skunk is a double, and a double skunk is 4 of these nasty puppies. Well, this particular night, my wife was absolutely CRUSHING me, she had won 7 games in a row, with a skunk thrown in for good measure. As such, I was very messed up when we got home.<br>
<br>
Ok, the backstory is complete. The rest summarizes that eventful morning.<br>
<br>
We get home from date night, &quot;skooter&quot; is already asleep in her bed (thank god for grandparents), and my wife helps me get to into bed, as I am still in the land of over-drinking. I wake up to the sound of my lil girl asking me if I have an owie. I really just want sleep at this point, and I know that if I say no, she will ask another 23 questions relating to the matter. As such, I tell her, yes, daddy has an &quot;owie&quot;, and I point to my head, which is pounding due to the ungodly amounts of poisen my wife made me drink. I receive a kiss on my forehead, and I am thankful that she isn't asking more questions, as all I want at this point is more sleep. I drift back into never never land. <br>
<br>
An hour later, I awake, still with a headache, but I am alive. One thing is on my mind at this point, and that is a HUGE cup of fresh brewed coffee. Mind you, I am functioning at this point on my instincts alone. My brain sent a signal to my body to rise, put on my robe, and walk into the kitchen for some coffee. Everything else was unimportant, I had a mission, and by god that coffee was gonna be mine!<br>
<br>
I walk out of my room, onto the deck, and into the kitchen. Somewhere along this path, I notice something odd....very odd. The usual noises of silverware clinking, and voices chirping have stopped. I notice that everyone has a look of shock on their face, and they are all staring at me. I think to myself WTF, I cant look that bad! I check to make sure my robe is in fact covering my body....yep. I cant for the life of me figure out why I am now the center of attention. About this time, my wife rounds the corner, sees me from a distance of approximately 20 feet, and her mouth drops open. She bursts into uncontrollable laughter, covers the 20 feet in two large leaps and rips something from my forehead. <br>
<br>
Im still befuddled, and confused, but as my eyes focus, I see now why I was being gawked at. In my wifes hand was a Maxi-pad pantyliner, thin model, with wings. It appears we were out of bandaids, and being a smart li'l kid, Skooter decided that my headache was worthy of a female hygiene product.<br>
<br>
I am now a major stock holder in a band-aid company......&quot; <br>
