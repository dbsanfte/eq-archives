        He set his lute aside then bowed and smiled at the applause from those gathered around him.<br>
        &quot;A story now, Master Bard,&quot; someone from the small audience called.  It was echoed by those who sat nearby, &quot;A story, yes, a story.&quot;<br>
        He grinned boyishly as he ran his fingers through blond hair streaked with gray.  &quot;A story you want, a story you will get.  Barkeep, refresh these good peoples' drinks, for I have a long tale to tell.  A story of love and war, good and evil, honor and betrayal, gods and legends.&quot;  He sipped his own drink, then looked out over them, as if staring at a distant mountain, then swiftly dropped his gaze to the crowd…<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
        She awoke to pain, pain that flowed through her whole body.  She felt it burning in her lungs, in her stomach.  Heat that flared behind her eyes and through her brain.  A fiery pressure that pushed and pulsed, threatening to explode at any moment…<br>
…Then it was gone.  The fire died only to leave a dull ache that hurt everywhere and nowhere.  She tried to see, tried to open her eyes but couldn't.  Her world was submerged in darkness and pain.<br>
<br>
        Seeing and feeling nothing outside of herself she drifted.  Briefly, she tried to think of what happened, what came before the flames and the burning.  She reached out with her senses to no avail, even the passage of time meant nothing to her.  Minutes, hours or even days could have passed without notice.  Was she going insane?  She heard the faint sound of giggling and wondered if she already had.<br>
<br>
Hands!  Those were hands she felt.  They were cool, insistent, touching her body lightly.  She thought she heard a voice as well but was overwhelmed at the rush of physical sensation.  She felt a pressure on her spine, and the back of her legs and arms.  A hand brought her head up gently to lay against a shoulder.  Arms cradled her body as she felt herself lifted.  Through the ache these sensations made her heart leap.  Not knowing whether to be fearful or happy, she only knew that the comforting shoulder her head rested against would bring her out of the darkness.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Child…my child are you awake.&quot;  The question reached her through the darkness, past the pain that seemed to be fading, if slowly.  &quot;Are you back child?&quot;  The question seemed absurd.  Back from where?  &quot;Are you awake?&quot;<br>
'Of course I'm awake', she thought, 'or I wouldn't be able to hear you&quot;, yet she was unable to open her eyes, or voice her answer.<br>
&quot;Yes, you are back,&quot; the voice said.  An old voice, kindly, grandfatherly.  She felt the touch of a cool cloth on her forehead and a gentle hand on her arm.  &quot;Don't be alarmed my child, your sight should come back to you in a band or so.&quot;<br>
She felt the hand withdraw and reached out, her body screamed in protest at the simple movement.  &quot;No child, don't move, I'm only wetting the cloth.  I won't leave you now.&quot;  She relaxed her muscles, burning from the slight motion she had made.  Slowly the pain went away and she drifted off into a restful sleep.<br>
<br>
        Fire!  She bolted upright, her body aflame.  A white-hot light pierced her brain through her eyes as a pitched moan escaped her throat.  The cool hands pressed her down gently and the fire was washed away.  The white heat behind her eyes dimmed and slowly she began to make out shapes.  Dim shadows flitted about as she blinked once, twice, feeling welcome tears come to her eyes and wash away the heat like a cool rain.  Shapes and colors appeared as the tears washed away the shadows and she saw the place she had been brought to.<br>
<br>
        Not much more than a hovel, it had the feelings of a home long parted from.  Small jars and bowls, stones and stone carvings as delicate as newborn kittens lined simple shelves around the room she lay in.  She followed the shelves with her eyes examining each precious artifact until tears came from her eyes again.  She tilted her head back, insistently ignoring the pain in her neck and shoulders and followed the shelves around her bed until her eyes fell upon a small stone carving.  No more or less delicate than the others, she felt drawn like a moth to a lamp.  A woman and a child standing together, hair and dresses bouncing lightly in a breeze.  The woman looked out, searching beyond her world of shelves and knickknacks for something far more important.  One delicate hand crossed her chest to hold back her long flowing hair from her eyes.  The other hand gently yet protectively on the shoulder of the small girl.  The girl looked up, loving expectation in her eyes.<br>
<br>
        &quot;That is my favorite,&quot; the old voice spoke, breaking her reverie.  &quot;They hold a special place in my heart, if not my shelves.&quot;  He chuckled at some private joke only he and the stone women knew.<br>
She made to ask a question and produced only a croak.  &quot;Here child, drink.&quot;  Her eyes fell upon the owner of wizened voice.  An old man to be certain, yet age had been kinder or perhaps more thoughtful in his aging.  Lines etched his face like carved stone.  Gentle blue eyes peered from beneath brows square and strong as cliffs.  Prominent cheek bones lined a straight, distinguished nose.  Full but lined and weathered lips turned up in a comforting smile.  Strong teeth set in an impossibly square jaw gleamed, making his smile seem even larger.  She never took her eyes from his face as he brought a cup of cool water to her lips.  Yet another fire was quenched as the liquid flowed down her parched throat.  She took possession of the cup from his hands to speed the water down, coughing as she drank too fast.  She waved off his attempt to retrieve the cup and caught her breath to carefully finish off the last drop.  Seeing she was fine, the smile returned to his face as he set the cup off to one side.  &quot;Better?&quot; he asked and nodded when she indicated her satisfaction.<br>
<br>
Finding her voice, she tried again, &quot;You made those?&quot;  He turned his head and followed her gaze to the stone carvings.<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; he smiled wistfully as he looked upon the woman and child.  &quot;It's not often I have visitors, so I help them find their way from the stone.&quot;<br>
She gave him a puzzled look and he placed his hand gently upon her shoulder, &quot;I dream of these, my visitors, and when I wake I find the stone they wish to come out of and lend them a hand.&quot;  He stood up and leaned over her to pick up the statuette.<br>
&quot;They are beautiful,&quot; she said as he handed it to her.<br>
&quot;Are they?&quot; he asked, seeking approval.  &quot;I only hoped I could bring them fully forth.  These old hands are not what they once were.&quot;  Her eyes fell to his hands.  His hands were weathered and strong and looked too large for the delicate work.  She looked at her own hands.<br>
With a gasp she dropped the figurine to the bed and stared at the grotesque, paper-thin skin that covered her hands and arms.  Pink and red blotches covered them and the faint red and blue lines of vessels and capillaries streaked across them like the lines on a map.  Her mouth gaped in horror as visions of flame came unbidden.<br>
<br>
&quot;A mirror!  Give me a mirror!&quot;  She cried, terrified of the vision she might see but wanting to look nonetheless.  Her thoughts were confirmed by the look on the old man's face and his words.  &quot;Child no, give it time.  You are healing, this will all fade.&quot;<br>
&quot;No,&quot; she said as tears welled up in her eyes.  &quot;Give me a mirror, I must see!&quot;  He looked down at his hands in silent protest even as she sat up and grabbed them, drawing them and his eyes to hers.  Meeting her defiant gaze only briefly he nodded and rose.  She withdrew, regretting her actions but certain in her reason.  She had to see.<br>
He came back, a silver mirror cradled in his arms.  The question on his face was again answered, this time with a gentle nod and an open hand.  When she grasped the finely crafted mirror she looked into his eyes a final time, this time seeing the look of expectation a teacher would give a student when waiting for the answer to an important question.  She wondered briefly at this and steeled herself, turning the mirror to face her.<br>
<br>
The gasp and moan broke from her lips unwillingly.  Her face…her head.  The skin covering it was the same blotchy, thin stuff that covered her hands.  Veins leapt out from her image as they raced across her cheeks and forehead.  Even her eyelids were crossed with them.  She was bald as well, not just on her head but where eyebrows and eyelashes should have been.  Not a single hair protruded from the creature that stared at her from the mirror.  Tears ran down that creature's face as she let the mirror drop.  She stared at the hands as if to berate them for their clumsiness.  The image from the mirror remained in her mind as she looked up through tears to the old man.<br>
&quot;What happened to me?&quot;  The question broke through great sobs as her breath quickened and tears fell freely.  &quot;Why am I like this?&quot;<br>
He looked upon her with kind yet saddened eyes and held out his arms as she moved into them, hiding like a lost child.  When the questions were answered only by his gentle arms and her mind filled with nothing but fire and darkness another question rose from deep within her soul and escaped her before she dared to think about it.<br>
&quot;Who am I?&quot;<br>

&quot;Dundare,&quot; she said his name slowly to give herself strength for the question. &quot;Who am I?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I had hoped you could tell me child.&quot; He saw her shoulders sag as her eyes turned to the shelves. She looked over the jars and bowls and figures without really seeing them.  &quot; I found you near the stream about a hundred or so paces aback,&quot; he tilted his head in the direction of the back door.  &quot;Naked and hairless you were, like a baby mouse.&quot;  She blushed, gathering the blanket around her shoulders tighter.  &quot;Mind you, you've done some healing since, I thought you dead at first.  Figured you'd run afoul of the wrong sort, if you catch my meaning.  When I came closer I saw you'd been burned, or so it appeared, and healed some.  Still you didn't move but I heard you breathing.  Didn't sound good at all so I carried you back.  And here you've been, a week or so.&quot;  She had closed her eyes while he told her this, flames again pressing against her mind.  She pushed them away this time and opened her eyes.<br>
<br>
Dundare was holding a plate and bowl before her and staring at her with a concerned look on his face.  She shook her head and smiled as he gave her the food.<br>
&quot;I don't understand,&quot; she said between bites of her dinner.  She hadn't realized she was so hungry and had to be slowed not a few times by the old healer's hand and clucking protests.  &quot;I don't know who I am, what happened to me.  Not even where I'm from, or where we are now or,&quot; she shook her head violently, placing her palms against her eyes. &quot;Nothing. Empty. Just fire and darkness.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lifting her head she shook it and took up her spoon for a bite of stew.  It was good, another taste and she found she recognized and could name a variety of the herbs Dundare had used.  The old man smiled when she said as much.  &quot;See, you have something upstairs after all.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Great,&quot; she said pursing her lips. &quot;I'm a cook who got too friendly with the stove.&quot;  Seeing Dundare hide a grin behind a biscuit she chuckled and stuffed one in her mouth as well.<br>
<br>
&quot;And a sense of humor to keep all those herbs company.&quot;<br>
<br>
A sevenday passed, much the same.  She healed rapidly, her skin loosing the blotched, veiny appearance and taking on the bright, pinkish hue of new skin.  At first she couldn't bear the light of day, the way it burned where the sun's rays touched and the white hotness that pierced her eyes.  But after four days, she could follow Dundare out to help gather herbs and vegetables from the small garden he kept on one side of his home.  She found she was indeed good with herbs and spices.  Cooking seemed to be a skill she had once been familiar with, much to her chagrin and Dundare's amusement.  The cooking fires were still too hot for her to approach though, so she settled for the old healer's meals, which suited her just find.  He could certainly cook.<br>
<br>
Her memories healed but not quickly, and only by bits and pieces.  Any that could help the woman remember herself eluded her, but brief flashes of life came often.  Shadows of people, houses and merchants, small items of no specific importance she clung to fiercely, the fear of them slipping away again forefront in her mind.<br>
<br>
Another week passed and she tried her hand at a stew.  Rabbit, herbs, carrots from a bushel that had mysteriously appeared on their doorstep that morning and other ingredients produced a meal that met with Dundare's' nodding, full-mouthed approval.  Two bowls later he heaved his large frame into the chair of cloth, grasses and wood he proclaimed 'his', and patted his belly.  <br>
&quot;Ah child, quite a meal that was.  I would have a hard time believing a cooking accident would have placed you in this predicament.&quot;  She nodded in agreement.  They had settled on the 'cooking accident', though grimly humorous, as the reason for her condition, merely because her patchwork memory provided no other alternatives.<br>
<br>
She sat down on the stool across from him, drawing up the simple flowered dress he had pulled from a chest that lay under her bed.  He had slept in a woven hammock since her arrival and wouldn't hear of taking the bed back.  'Reminds me of my younger days and the old bones don't protest too much,' he'd say.<br>
<br>
&quot;So you've still remembered nothing else?&quot; he prompted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just flashes of people without faces, a city, a market.&quot;  She exhaled forcefully, disgusted with her rebellious mind.  &quot;Nothing specific and nothing that explains this,&quot; She held up her hands to indicate the pink skin that was just beginning to grow the faint, downy hair that covered all humans' skin.  &quot;Nothing that explains fire or violence.&quot;  She sighed again as she lowered her hands and clasped them together when a sudden chill ran through her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Remember child,&quot; he continued to call her this when she refused to take a name, even temporarily, for fear of somehow loosing her own forever.  &quot;Your mind is also healing.  Just as you couldn't go into the sun at first, or approach the stove, your mind shies away from the flame that caused this.  In time perhaps.&quot;  He shook his head at her forlorn look.<br>
&quot;What of other things?  Where you lived or where you grew up?  Your mother?  Father?  A husband perhaps or child, sisters or brothers.&quot;  Each was answered with a shake of her head.  &quot;Seasons perhaps?  Memories of leaves on the ground, snow even.  A hot summer day or cool starlit night.&quot; He stopped as he saw a light come on in her eyes.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hot nights, muggy but the sky was clear, stars everywhere.  You can see the city lights, more lights, like a festival.&quot;  She closed her eyes as a brief smile came to her face.  &quot;Smell the bread, the meats?  I'm hungry.&quot;<br>
The healer made to comment on the rather filling meal they had just had, then realized she was no longer just searching for a lost memory.  The young woman had slipped into a deeper reverie, reliving some shard of her past.  &quot;I'm not tired,&quot; she paused listening to the ghosts in her mind.  &quot;Tomorrow then, you promise?&quot;<br>
<br>
She opened her eyes with a start, her breath shallow and rapid.  She looked at Dundare with a look of amazement and some fear.  She rose rapidly, her breath still rapid but deep.  &quot;A festival, on a night like this,&quot; she began rapidly pacing the room, her hands in motion as if forming her words from clay.  &quot;A child, a child!  I was seeing it from the eyes of a child!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;One of your memories of childhood then?  A festival would certainly stick in ones' mind even from childhood,&quot; he chuckled softly. &quot;I remember one…&quot; she broke in, her hands molding each word. <br>
&quot;No, it wasn't like a memory.  It was clear, crystal clear, and I felt part of it yet detached, an observer.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But it was so long ago, I mean, not saying you're, well, but a child's memory through an adult's perspective…&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, that's just it.&quot;  Her words came faster, without the aid of her hands.  &quot;It was recent, almost like, no just like seeing it as it happened.&quot;  He looked at her in puzzlement.  &quot;This was no memory!  I was looking on as it happened.&quot; He cocked his head at her. &quot;Call it a vision, a scrying, but I went somewhere, saw something happening now!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Child, the way your memories have been, I would suspect any memory as whole as that, and one of the first, would seem so.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It was on a night like this,&quot; she interrupted again.  &quot;Just like this!  The sky, the air.&quot;  She paused briefly scanning him, &quot;Is there a city near here?&quot;  A protest almost broke his lips.  &quot;A city, holding festival, near here?&quot; she knelt before him, drawing his gaze which had fallen away.  She grasped his hands in a loving but strong grip.<br>
&quot;The city, is there a festival in the city?&quot;<br>
<br>
He looked into her deep green eyes, searching, then nodded.  &quot;Miera Kiy,&quot; he sighed.   The grand city of Miera Kiy.  They are holding the midsummer's festival this tenday starting two days ago.&quot;<br>

You still have no real memory, nothing that gives you identity.  You don't even have a name!&quot; he said in exasperation.  She had started to pack the night before but he had stopped her.  The night was getting late and as it was half a day's walk to the city.  He had talked to her about bandits and creatures in the night and finally she conceded.  The old healer had hoped a good night's sleep would bring reason to the woman's brain.<br>
<br>
The next morning though, even as he was rubbing the sleep from his eyes and a yawn escaped from a sleepy mouth she was moving about wrapping up a blanket and the clothes he had given her.<br>
She paused briefly, thinking, &quot;I don't need a name, not yet anyway.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What will you do when you get there?  Wander about like a lost soul until some thief picks you for an easy mark?&quot;  He stepped up to her and took her arm in one hand gently and turned her towards him.  &quot;Even if by some luck you find this family, what will you do?  More than likely scare them I'd wager.  Have you thrown in a cell perhaps?  What would you tell the Ward?  You with no name, no past, looking like you escaped from one cell already.&quot;  He ran a gnarled hand across the brown stubble growing from her head.  &quot;Wouldn't it just be better to stay here for a while longer?&quot;  He turned and looked around the small room.  &quot;You've been the best company this old man's had in quite some time,&quot; he chuckled softly.  &quot;Even if I am sleeping in my hammock.&quot;<br>
<br>
She took his hands and brought them to her lips and gently kissed them.  &quot;Oh Dundare, I could never begin to repay you for all you've done, but I promise you I'll return.&quot;  She turned and took a few steps before turning towards him again.  &quot;This is what I should do, even though I can't put words to why.  But if I don't go, I know I'll loose something of myself, of my past.&quot;<br>
He looked into her eyes with the searching look she had grown fond of and nodded.  She would have gone anyway, but his approval suddenly made it all the easier.  She grabbed him in a fierce hug that surprised him, then released him with a smile and returned to her packing.<br>
<br>
She picked up the figurine of the woman and child of stone and gazed at them, fondly running her fingers across its lines and ridges.  It was hard to break away from them as Dundare came from wherever he had disappeared to with a bundle in his hands.<br>
She took the weighty, small object wrapped in a soft cloth that smelled of oil.  With a nod from him she unwrapped it revealing a finely crafted dagger and sheath.  Etched in swirls and strange writings upon guard, poignard and sheath it was beautifully crafted but had a look that told of much use.  She looked up at him questioningly then unsheathed it.  If the etchings on the hilt were of fine craftsmanship then the blade was worked by a true master.  Thin lines like the rings in an ancient tree ran the length of the blade along the edges.  Down the middle were symbols and writings that could only be one thing: magic.<br>
<br>
She glanced at Dundare again in awe then ran one finger slowly from hilt to tip, tracing the multitude of symbols slowly.  As her fingertip brushed the final etching at the point she felt a tingle move through her and saw silvery light race across the writings.  Her breath quickened when she saw Dundare's look of surprise matched her own.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's never done that,&quot; he said finally as she resheathed the blade.<br>
&quot;I cannot take this,&quot; she said offering it to him with a shake of her head.<br>
He raised his hands, &quot;No child, now even more than before, the blade is yours.  I've never seen the magic wakened in it though I've known it to be there.  No lass, the dagger is yours.  I pray that you will never need it, though I think if you do it will serve you better than the Queen's own guard.&quot;<br>
She wrapped it in the oilcloth and placed it in her makeshift knapsack.  The figurine she wrapped in another soft cloth and placed next to the dagger.<br>
<br>
He held out another bundle, this one a deep brown and green lined hooded cloak.  &quot;To protect you from the weather and,&quot; he paused, &quot;it is better, I think, that you recognize a person before they you.  You do not know those who may be your enemies.  Remember how I found you.&quot;  He knew full well she did.<br>
She shook it out and choosing to wear the brown on the outside, threw it over her shoulders over the simple blue men's jerkin and tan pants she wore.<br>
<br>
&quot;Better that none notice you for the pretty lass you are,&quot; he said.  For though she grimaced and ran her fingers across the stubble of her hair, her green eyes shone fiercely from a face of fine, beautiful features.  The scars that should have been evident from a burning were not to be seen, and her face looked freshly scrubbed like a bride before her wedding.  Though it would be obvious to the most casual observer that it was a woman's bosom that breathed lightly in the man's shirt, the looseness of it and the large cloak did much to hide her figure.  She was otherwise slim, with slight hips and well proportioned legs though she was somewhat short.  All-in-all giving the initial impression of an older boy just coming into manhood though she walked with a grace no boy could ever muster.<br>
<br>
He looked fondly upon her, &quot;Though I won't ask you again to stay, I will have your promise that you come back, sometime.  Especially if you are ever in need.&quot;  He raised her chin to bring her eyes to his, &quot;Any need.&quot;  Dire implications rode on his words.<br>
&quot;I promise,&quot; she said sincerely. &quot;I will return.&quot;  Again she kissed his hand on the palm then held it against her cheek as she closed her eyes.  &quot;No one I find, man, woman, or child will take the place in my heart that is yours Dundare.&quot;<br>
<br>
After a moment of silence she broke free and smiled mischievously, &quot;Well Father, I go out into the world to find my fortune.  I will find myself a fair husband and a cow and raise myself a proper family.&quot; She then curtsied deeply as he laughed.  Grabbing her knapsack and throwing the cloak closed she kissed him on the cheek, waved hesitantly and turned to walk through the door.<br>
He watched her take the path that met the road to Miera Kiy and continued to watch long after she disappeared from sight.  As she passed into the treeline he nodded approvingly, looking every bit the teacher watching his best student on graduating day.<br>
<br>
A band's travel through trees and low, rocky hills brought her to an intersection on her path.  The road was wide and heavily traveled.  From Dundare's directions she knew to turn right, Northwards, to reach her goal.<br>
<br>
Miera Kiy lay sprawled along the eastern banks of the Miera, a great freshwater lake that was more like an inland-sea in size.  Small villages and towns lined the banks both north and south of the city, but none compared to the vast city.<br>
A week's travel south by horse would take you to the river towns of Lest and Heln, twin cities that lie on either side of the sea's outlet, the Hairn River.  Four days north would take a traveler to the Dragon's Perch Mountains, the source of the Miera's fresh waters.<br>
<br>
As she moved onto the road and turned north she heard voices and the sound of horses hooves coming from the south along the road.  Looking to either side she saw no place to hide herself, so instead began walking with an easy pace towards the city.<br>
As the hooves approached her, she heard the voices cease.  She found herself desperately wishing for the dagger Dundare had given her, but it lay on the bottom of the pack across her shoulders.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail Traveler, alone on this bright morn?&quot; a man's voice asked as she heard the horse - no, perhaps two - come alongside of her.  She gave a halfhearted wave of greeting and continued, pulling her cloak tighter about her.<br>
&quot;'Tis not safe to travel alone, though we try to make it more so.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tradesway guards?&quot; she thought as she turned her head slightly to glance up at them.  The Tradesway Guard traveled all the main roads of the small country of Torain.  At the Queen's behest they moved swiftly about in small bands keeping travelers as safe as possible.  Though the marauding bands of humanoids had long moved on to less guarded roads, the Guard was found to be a boon to commerce for the country and Queen Tulsforth gave them official license to keep the roads safe for travel. 'All in all a fairly honest bunch,&quot; as Dundare put it.<br>
<br>
The Queen's companion, an old adventuring friend, was Captain of her guard and initiated the Tradesway Guard.  He brooked no dishonesty amongst the Guard and chose his Lieutenants from the best he could find.  Often Paladins or other holy warriors, as the temple to the god of trade fully backed the Guard, as did the Church of The Traveler, though they had no paladins.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye Milady, Tradesway Guard here.  I'm Kirken and my young partner here is Willan.&quot;<br>
&quot;I'll be she's a wizard Kirk.  Wizards travel alone like that,&quot; the young guard said nodding confidently.  The older guard grinned at the woman and nodded in his companion's direction.  &quot;Young Willan her wouldn't know a wizard if he had his eyebrows lit on fire by one.&quot;  The reference sent a shiver down the young woman's spine.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're old Dundare's charge aren't you, if you don't mind me askin?&quot;  She looked at him wondering how he knew her.  &quot;I thought as much.  Dundare asked me if I should see you to keep an eye on you.  I'd give you a ride to the city but we're forbidden riders.&quot;  He reached back into a saddlebag.  &quot;But I can give you this,&quot; he produced a wide strip of blue cloth with a gold shield emblem on it.  &quot;Wear it on your arm.  It shows you're under special protection.  Most bandits who're brave enough to travel these roads aren't brave enough to rob one wearing the shield.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Most?&quot; she asked as she wrapped the band around her arm and fumbled to tie it off.<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; he said with a grin, &quot;there's no accounting for stupidity is there?&quot;<br>
She returned his wry smile and nodded in thanks.  Kirken wheeled his horseback around, his companion mimicking his movements.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just remember, stay to the road, you will see markers to keep you heading right.&quot;  He waved and spurred his horse down the road at a trot.  Willan paused for a brief moment looking at the woman then nodded and moved to catch up to Kirken.<br>
That final look had made her uneasy, but she couldn't nail down why.  She wouldn't mind seeing Kirken again though, but at the same time hoped to never see his suspicious young companion again.<br>

As morning turned to afternoon, she stopped more and more to rest.  Leg muscles ached from the unusual strain of walking great distances, shoulders and arms ached from the pack that seemed to grow heavier with each passing band of the candle.  Every two bands or so a group of Tradesway Guards passed her in either direction.  Each time she received a hearty salute or a loud friendly hail, but she saw neither Kirken nor his partner pass again.<br>
<br>
At least a score of other groups came her way as well.  Merchant wagons, families with their wagons packed to overflowing, children and dogs hanging over the edges greeting other travelers with waving hands and wagging tails.  Twice, groups that could only be described as 'adventurers' trudged by heading to the South.  The last group, a band of swaggering swordsmen, met her with silent nods and ill concealed smirks.  A few paces after they passed, she heard low laughter from some joke told under breath.  This was enough to prompt her to dig the dagger from her pouch and strap it on under her cloak.  At the bottom of her sack she found a pouch of coins nestled alongside the dagger.  She realized she hadn't even thought of how she'd pay her way once in the city and silently thanked Dundare for slipping the pouch in.<br>
<br>
Coming upon a great boulder sitting on the edge of a hillock she saw a sign chiseled into the rock itself proclaiming the 'City of Miera Kiy'.  She grinned at the lone boulder, wondering if it sat upon the great city and followed the road around the hill.<br>
Not even fully past the ancient rock she came upon the city.  The road she was on continued down from the hills onto a sweeping plain.  From her vantage-point she looked upon the vast city.  Walls towered over the sprawl of houses and tents that they could not contain within.  To the east she could see several roads leaving the city.  To the West, where the walls ended, the shimmering waters of the Miera began.  The far shore she could not see, though numerous ships of all sizes sat on the water up to and beyond the horizon.  The port itself she could not make out, though she saw the upper masts of ships above the buildings.<br>
<br>
It hit her then, sending her staggering against the boulder.  The vision washed over her senses, not like the images of the festival the night before, but more like a memory, sadness and anger overwhelmed her.  She was in a wagon leaving this very city, a sense of loss sent her reeling then disappeared just as swiftly, leaving only the brief image and the sadness of some unknown loss.<br>
She stood there confused.  What was going on?  Shaking her head she wiped a tear from her eye and shifted the pack from one sore shoulder to the other before heading down the hill towards the city gates.<br>
<br>
Three times she moved off the road to allow overloaded merchant wagons to pass before she got to the gates.  Hawkers approached from tents and stands near the road waving fruits, cloths, and jewelry proclaiming their better price and quality than their neighbor's while an elderly woman and cloth merchant were drowning them all out in a fierce verbal battle over a few coppers.<br>
Four mounted Tradesway Guards, again none she recognized, thundered out of the gates and down the road evoking shouts from merchants and customers alike.  Reaching the gates, a sentry noticed her amongst the other travelers and waved as she approached.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well met traveler, safe journey?&quot;  She nodded as he approached and looked at him questioningly.  &quot;Your pass,&quot; he said, pointing to the strip of cloth on her arm.  She untied it and gave it to him.<br>
&quot;And your sponsor's name?&quot;<br>
She paused again, then said &quot;Kirken,&quot; hoping it was the name he was looking for.<br>
&quot;Aye, thank ya.  Want ta let him know his charge made it here safe an' in one piece,&quot; he said with a grin.  &quot;Hae ya been ta Miera Kiy afore?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied without thinking, &quot;many years ago.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ah well, much changes an' much stays tha same,&quot; he responded cryptically.  &quot;If ya stay along tha main road, ya'll find inn and tavern aplenty.  If ya keep ta it a while ya'll find tha inns that offer a better bed without emptyin' yer purse.&quot;<br>
&quot;My thanks,&quot; she smiled at his helpfulness.<br>
&quot;Ma pleasure.  Kirken's a friend and any he takes on I'll watch o'r as well.  Name's Elex, I tour some of tha wards as well as stand Gate, so we may meet again.&quot;  He waved as something caught his attention, &quot;Be safe traveler.&quot;  She waved in return and entered the Gates.<br>
<br>
The walls were huge, towering fifty feet into the air over the buildings that butted against their stones.  The gate towers of weathered and age-stained granite rose another twenty feet above the walls, the blocks placed so tightly together she doubted she could slip a piece of parchment between them.  Between the two towers a wood and stone passage created a tunnel.  Banded iron doors and a steel portcullis on the outside and another portcullis inside all stood ready to turn the passage into a death trap for invaders.<br>
Breathing deeply as she exited the gates she smelled the mixed scents of food, people, and animals blowing on the light breeze that moved through the city.  The smell of bread was dominant and made her stomach rumble, reminding her of the coming mealtime.  She took Elex's advice though, passing the inns just inside the gates and continuing deeper into the city.<br>
<br>
She marveled at the inhabitants' efforts to turn what could have been a drab blend of wood and stone structures into a walk through a rainbow.  Flags, awnings, curtains and more flowers than she could count decorated the buildings and sidewalks.  Merchants waved scarves and banners to attract the attention of prospective customers while a multitude of people moved about their shopping or afternoon strolls.  Even the occasional troop of guards that moved through the crowd had a bright scarf, headband, or dyed feather adorning his uniform.<br>
<br>
Keeping her pack close to her chest in the press of the crowd, she wondered occasionally how long she would be carrying it.  Soon enough the crown thinned and she put it back over her shoulder.  There were no lack of inns as Elex had said, and she found herself standing in a plaza square at a road intersection wondering which way to go next.  Turning around, one sign caught her attention, eliciting a grin as she looked at the picture: a griffin that looked like every feather on its body had been plucked out.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Plucked Griffin,&quot; she said aloud in amusement.<br>
&quot;Actually missy, that's 'The Bald Griffin,'&quot; a deep voice from the doorway said.  A short man stepped from the doorway.  With a cloth in one hand and a tankard in the other he was vigorously scrubbing the inside even as his eyes looked up to meet hers.  &quot;Bald Griffin,&quot; he said to ensure she heard right.  The gray beard that covered his face wagged violently as he continued his assault on the mug.<br>
Barely able to conceal a grin she responded, &quot;He looks plucked to me, and none too happy about it either.&quot;  She saw annoyance briefly cross his face to be replaced with a broad grin.<br>
&quot;Aye, that he was, missy, that he was.  Fancy a drink?&quot; he asked finally giving up on the scrubbing to motion in the door.  &quot;First one's on me for bringin' a little o' my youth back.&quot;  His smile grew broader as the green-eyed woman grinned back and nodded.<br>
<br>
'A Dwarf,' she thought suddenly, marveling at seeing one of the small but powerful folk.  She followed him into the small inn.  Once her eyes adjusted she looked about the room.<br>
Thick frosted windows let a soft light wash over the nearby tables and chairs, while glass lamps lit the deeper corners.  A bar ran the length of the left wall, broken by a hinged countertop that the stout dwarf ducked under before popping up from behind.  A swinging door just past the opening concealed what was probably a kitchen or storeroom.<br>
<br>
&quot;What'll you have missy?&quot; he asked as he tossed the rag on the bar and placed the mug somewhere beneath.<br>
She opened her mouth then shut it with a snap realizing she didn't have the first clue what she wanted.  Seeing indecision on her face the dwarf raised a finger, &quot;How about a nice Kiran wine?&quot;  He turned and reached to a shelf laden with bottles of all sorts and picked one up.  &quot;The wife likes it and it's kind on the palate o' humans and dwarves alike.&quot;  She smiled and nodded as she pulled up a barstool and sat down, placing her pack between her feet against the bar.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not much for words are you?&quot;  He said, pulling the cork from the bottle and retrieving a glass from a rack above the bar.  &quot;It's not a bad thing mind you.  An old friend said once that 'the less one has to say, the more likely others'll listen when you do.'&quot;  He poured the wine and pushed the glass towards her.  &quot;Name's Denan,&quot; he said after he corked the bottle.  Placing it back in its spot on the shelf he turned back to her, &quot;What brings you to our fair city, if you don't mind me askin'?  The dust on your cloak sits lightly so I can see you just arrived.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Leave her be Denan, its not fit to be so nosey in other's business,&quot; a feminine voice piped in from behind the door as it swung open.  &quot;Some don't take kindly to questions 'bout their business.&quot;  The Dwarf matron wiped her hands on her apron and smiled widely at the human.  &quot;Don't mind him girl.  He still fancies himself a grand adventurer.  That and tendin' bar makes him think he needs to know 'bout everythin' goin' on.&quot;<br>
<br>
Denan picked up the rag off the bar and tossed it at his spouse, &quot;Mind your own, Beloved. I was just tryin' to make a traveler feel welcome.&quot;  He ducked unsuccessfully as the rag came back at him.<br>
&quot;Well that you are child,&quot; she said as she approached the counter.  &quot;My name's Megda, pleased to meet you.  Hungry?&quot; she asked as she gave Denan's beard a loving tug.<br>
&quot;Aye, always,&quot; he said slyly and received a tap on the forehead.<br>
&quot;I'm talkin' to your customer.&quot;  The crestfallen look evoked a laugh from their guest.<br>
&quot;Good to meet you Megda.  I am hungry.  Trail bread will keep you alive but not much more.&quot;<br>
Megda nodded and turned for the kitchen.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't mind telling you, by the by,&quot; she said after Denan's wife left.  &quot;I'm just here for the festival and,&quot; she paused to take a sip of the wine, &quot;perhaps to find an old friend or two.&quot;<br>
He nodded as he poured an ale from a small barrel into the tankard he had been cleaning earlier.  Climbing on a stool behind the bar he brought himself up level with the human.  &quot;Aye, the festival brings in travelers from all over Torain, Jorelan, and Tye-Basra as well,&quot; he said, indicating the two countries that lay across the Miera and Hairn River.  &quot;The plaza's a bit bare now,&quot; he nodded toward the outside door, &quot;but give it a band or so and the entertainers will come as well as the dinner crowd.&quot;  She nodded as she looked around the tavern.  Apparently she was the only customer at the moment.  &quot;Aye, empty for the time, though most of our rooms are taken.  They're all out shoppin and such.  Most will stop by around dinner.&quot;  <br>
He took a deep swig of his ale and motioned toward her glass.  She nodded and he leaned back to retrieve the wine bottle.<br>
<br>
She took a sip from the refilled glass, &quot;You said you had rooms available?&quot;<br>
&quot;Aye, and a hot bath to soothe the muscles and wash off the road as well if you like.&quot;<br>
She smiled again and pulled her hood back to rub her head.  Receiving a shocked look from the dwarf she realized how she must look with hair not much longer than a chick's down.  She hurriedly moved to pull the hood back up and was stayed by the old dwarf's hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nay missy.  I apologize for my reaction, but I've not seen such hair around a face like yours since I lost a companion of mine years ago.  A warrior she was, from Kira.  They favor their hair short amongst their fighters.  Aye,&quot; he said looking wistfully over her shoulder and into the shadows of his past.  &quot;A fiery one she was.  Better warrior than half those Tradesway Guards.&quot;  He raised his tankard, &quot;To your firebrand-heart, Kherani.&quot;  He drank deeply, emptying his mug before placing on the counter. &quot;Bah!&quot; he said suddenly.  &quot;She'd take the side of her blade to my head if she saw me moping over her like this.&quot;<br>
&quot;Nay,&quot; the woman said gently, &quot;I think she'd be raising her own glass to the friend who kept her memory close to his heart for so long.&quot;<br>
&quot;A friend…aye,&quot; he said, ghosts dancing in his eyes.  &quot;Ah!  After fourth band.  Excuse me missy, I've tables to clean before the crowd comes.&quot;  He set his tankard below the bar and hopped off his stool.  Grabbing the rag he ducked under the bar and hurried into the room, rearranging chairs and wiping tables.<br>
<br>
&quot;Perhaps I misspoke,&quot; she said staring into her glass.<br>
&quot;Nay, you didn't child,&quot; Megda placed a hot bowl of soup, a roll, and slice of cheese next to the wineglass.  &quot;The years weigh heavily on him at times.  He's seen many a friend move beyond this plane.  It does him good to talk about it from time to time.  Better than to have all those ghosts kept inside him with no release.&quot;<br>
She pushed the plate towards the young woman and set a worn steel spoon next to the bowl.  &quot;Eat up and I'll get your room ready if you'll have one.&quot;  The human nodded as she picked up the spoon and dipped it into the soup.  The dwarf patted her hand as she came around the bar, &quot;He'll be fine.  Your words meant more to him than he'll let on.&quot;  She nodded in affirmation of her own words and walked to the stairs that sat against the wall opposite the bar.  She stopped briefly at her husband's side, said a few quiet words and grasped his shoulder before continuing up the steps.<br>

<br>
&quot;Another bowl missy?&quot; Denan ducked under the bar just as she was putting her spoon in the empty bowl.   &quot;Wife makes the best stew in the city I'd say.&quot;  He was all smiles again and showed no sign of the sadness that had overcome him earlier.<br>
She shook her head as she wiped her mouth with the edge of her cloak, &quot;It was excellent and I'm quite full now, but I'm sure I'll have room for more later.  How much do I owe you?&quot;<br>
He waved his hand, &quot;Nothin'.  There'll be a crowd o' customers later with coin aplenty and they'll not be half the company you've been.  Promised me you'll come back down sometime when things are slow and tell me a bit about yourself and your travels.  That'll be payment enough.&quot; <br>
She nodded, wondering what she'd tell him if her memories remained a blank scroll.  &quot;Aye, perhaps I'll do just that, but I will pay for the room and bath.&quot;<br>
&quot;Well we can work somethin out concernin that then,&quot; he said with a grin. &quot;What ever you can spare'll do me fine.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't let him take all your gold child,&quot; Megda huffed down the stairs and crossed the room to the human's side.<br>
&quot;What?&quot; Denan said, in exaggerated astonishment.  &quot;You wound me woman!&quot;<br>
&quot;Wound you aye,&quot; she gave the human a conspiratorial look.  &quot;He once charged two whole gold for nothing more than a tankard of ale.&quot;<br>
&quot;Nothin more?&quot;  Denan puffed up.  &quot;The scruffy old bastard broke my mug.&quot;<br>
&quot;Aye, and with two gold you could have bought a dozen more.&quot;<br>
&quot;Bah, you don't know how much trouble it is to season a mug so the ale tastes just right.&quot;<br>
&quot;Seasonin for him means downin a whole keg while him an his friends play King's Crook.&quot;  That elicited an indecipherable grunt from her mate as he downed his ale.  &quot;Come child, your room's ready and the water's hot.&quot;<br>
The woman grinned as Megda turned and Denan winked and saluted with his mug.<br>
<br>
When they topped the stairs, Megda pointed down a short hall indicating the last room on the left.  &quot;When you get done with the bath be sure to open the tap at the bottom so it drains.&quot;  She opened the door to a small room.  A comfortable little cot was pushed up against the window that looked out over the plaza.  A chair and table occupied the other side of the room, crowding a wooden chest into one corner.  Another door opposite the entry opened on what passed as the bathroom.  A tub took up at least a third of the tiny room, with facilities for providing water and disposing of waste taking another third.<br>
<br>
&quot;There's a latch on the door for privacy and we've never had a problem with thieves,&quot;  Megda stated.   &quot;You should get hot water by pullin' the right chain, just yell if you don't.  I know a long hot bath always feels good on the old bones.&quot;  She patted the girl on the arm,  &quot;Just make yourself at home child.  If you need anythin just call.&quot;  She walked to the door and with one hand on the latch looked back.  &quot;What's your name child?  I didn't think to ask before now.&quot;<br>
The woman turned her head away and looked at the floor, she knew someone would eventually ask and she had nothing to tell them.<br>
&quot;Don't worry yourself.  It's not that important.&quot;  She smiled to put the human at ease.  &quot;A body has a right to keep their name to themselves.&quot;<br>
&quot;In good time Megda, I mean it.  Both of you have been so kind and I can't even give you my name.&quot;<br>
Megda smiled again and waved her hand,  &quot;All in good time as you said.&quot;  She opened the door and got halfway out before stopping again.  She turned her head and with a strange but cheerful look said, &quot;There's somethin about you child, somethin special.&quot;  Then she closed the door leaving the nameless, green-eyed woman to ponder the dwarf's cryptic words.<br>
<br>
Digging through her pack she pulled out a simple blue dress that she had selected from the box under Dundare's bed.  He hadn't said who the previous owner was, and she thought it best not to pry.  Shaking it out she draped it across the bed and emptied the rest of the pack.  Another dress, this one a light forest green, and a second set of breeches and shirt like the ones she wore she placed on the table.  Her remaining supply of travel bread, a tinderbox, a pouch with a variety of herbs lovingly wrapped in waxed cloth, and the pouch of coins joined the clothes on the table.  Pulling the figurine from the bottom of the pack she gently set it off to one side before stripping off her dusty travel clothes.  Taking the cloth-wrapped stone figure she padded in bare feet to the tub of hot water Megda had already prepared for her.  She smiled at the dwarves' amazing kindness as she slipped into the water.<br>
<br>
It was perfect.  She slid her aching body into the liquid warmth and submerged up to her chin, arms draped over the sides.  For a moment she lay still and let her mind drift as the pains in her muscles slowly went away.<br>
Bringing the figurine up she carefully unwrapped it.  Again she studied the woman and child.  The woman searching outward while the child was satisfied with just being near.  The woman, her mother perhaps, the center of her world.  The woman she would someday be.<br>
Placing the figurine on the edge of the tub, she closed her eyes and drifted off, the warmth of the water lulling her into sleep.<br>
<br>
The circle of stone dominated the chamber, stealing the light into its inky blackness.  A deep, pulsing tone echoed through the room.  Dim patterns appeared, releasing the stolen light into the tight weaves and lines of sigils of power.  A dozen hazy and indescript figures lined the outside of the circle, each slowly waving its body back and forth in time with the pulses of magic.  From where she stood in the center she could see another figure at the head of the room standing on a raised platform.  She could literally feel the evil radiating from the man who stood there, his arms raised and a deep chant echoing from his lips.  He too waved in time to the tones causing his rich, deep red robes to roll back and forth.  She could also feel the chant, its dark malevolency a tangible force washing through her.<br>
<br>
There were others in the chamber as well, sibilant whispers and low hisses rode the waves of the Priest's words.  She could feel them as well, their evil matched that of their master's.<br>
The chant increased in volume, it's intonement so deep the words seemed to come from the walls themselves.  She could feel the waves of power growing, emanating from the black stone circle.  They grew, even as the Priest's words turned frantic and high pitched, the waves of power pounded her body.  The figures stood in the gale, robes and cloaks whipping furiously even as they ignored it, continuing to slowly wave back and forth.<br>
The chanter's words reached a peak and a final, distinct word ripped through her like a flaming bolt.<br>
<br>
&quot;DIERGUROTH!&quot;<br>
<br>
White fire erupted from the priest and raced to the one at the head of the ring.  The flames split and shot around the ring setting each swaying figure afire before moving on to the next.  Meeting at the one who stood furthest from the priest, each grew into a pillar of searing flame that licked the high ceiling of the chamber.  The creatures within screamed in agony as the flames grew brighter.  Just when she thought the fires would blind her they streaked inward, converging on the center where she stood and engulfing her in searing, white-hot pain.<br>
<br>
Her eyes shot open as she flew from the cold waters of the tub.  Splashing across the floor she spun in confused circles, her hands grasping her head as flames danced behind her eyes.  Ragged, painful breaths were the only things that kept her from screaming.  Bumping into a corner of the small room, she collapsed to the floor and drew her knees to her chest and held herself, shaking, waiting for the flames to subside.  <br>
She sat curled up with her arms wrapped around her knees, drawing breath after painful breath until the flames died and the warm evening breeze coming through the window had dried her body.<br>
Then she cried.<br>

<br>
The sun had set.  She could hear crowds of people outside, the laughter and shouts of the festival.  She rose, her buttocks sore from the wood floor but she no longer shook and the flames had long since died.  Visions of the nightmarish dream lingered, but her confusion over their meaning did not wane.<br>
After dressing she shook the cloak out and threw it across her shoulders, green on the outside this time, and drew the hood over her head.  Remembering the dagger, she strapped it to her waist below the cloak and left her room.<br>
<br>
Coming down the stairs she heard the crowd, it was as Denan said, the tavern was full.  Shouts and laughter created a din that made talking difficult and listening impossible yet they carried on, each drowning the tedium of their day in ale and conversation.  Two serving girls and a boy moved about the room, trays loaded with food, drinks and empty dishes.  She saw an older human woman come from the kitchen to load the boy's tray with a meal before shooing him off.<br>
Denan scurried rapidly from one end of the bar to the other, pouring drinks, collecting coin and chatting heartily with everyone at once.  Catching her eye he waved her down to where he stood.<br>
&quot;Goin out now missy?&quot; he asked rhetorically.  &quot;Be safe and keep one eye and both hands on your money pouch, the cuttpurses'll be out in force by now.&quot;<br>
She smiled and nodded grasping his hand briefly.<br>
&quot;If you come back around ninth band or so, you'll catch a minstrel that'll rock your boat I'd wager.  Kind on the ears and eyes if the stares my servers give him are any tellin.&quot;  He grinned mischievously as she blushed.<br>
&quot;I'll try Denan.  I'm going out for a bit to stretch my legs and take in the sights.&quot;<br>
He nodded, &quot;Aye, good luck then.  I'll see you in a while.&quot;  She smiled and waved as she pushed her way through the crowd and into the streets.<br>
<br>
The streets, while less crowded than the Bald Griffin, were no less active.  Merchant wagons lined the plaza, while the interior was taken up with entertainers of every sort imaginable.  Jugglers, mimes, animal trainers, actors and puppeteers fought for space and coin as they showed off their skills to the admiring crowd.<br>
She drifted through like everyone else, watching the shows and going whichever way the flow carried her.  Two clowns shouting exaggerated challenges before beating each other with padded maces finally brought a grin to her face and her spirits began to lift.  Passing a fruit stand she was startled by two jugglers tossing flaming torches between them.  Stunned for a moment, she backed into an elderly man who cursed her clumsiness before being carried away in the flow of people.<br>
<br>
Coming upon a wide circle of people she stopped.  In the center stood a man and a black bear, the beast's forepaws on his shoulders as they danced about the ring.  The crowd stilled and gasped in amazement as the beastmaster pulled the muzzle off the bear only to have his entire face bathed in bear tongue.  She grinned at the bear's antics then brought one hand to her head as her vision swam.<br>
Two images fought for dominance, both of the bear and his trainer, one her own yet the other from a different perspective.  As she fought to straighten out her double vision, words came unbidden to her lips.<br>
&quot;Mommy, Daddy, look at the bear.  Look at the bear!&quot;  The words echoed in her ears as she spoke them.  She turned, her rebellious vision her own again as she looked for the one whose voice also spoke the words.<br>
<br>
A child.  A little human girl no older than ten seasons jumped up and down in excitement sending strands of long, chestnut hair flying about her shoulders.  She was anxiously pulling on a woman's hand and pointing at the bear.  Behind them both stood a tall man, his hand on the woman's shoulder absently playing with a lock of her red hair as he grinned proudly at the girl.  She could only stare and could not break away even as the man's eyes rose to meet hers.<br>
A bolt shot through her soul.  The world around them slowed to a stop in that brief meeting of the eyes.  Frustration and helplessness washed over her as she knew, she KNEW!  This was a man familiar to her, indeed that her life was tied inseparably to.  Yet no name, no place, no event rose from the black pool of her mind.  Even as she fought through the murky depths of her memories she saw something else entirely in his eyes.  Recognition, guilt, and fear.  All of these emotions raced across his face to be followed up finally with sadness.<br>
<br>
As suddenly as it happened, their souls parted, the world crashed in on her and the man disappeared into the crowd as his oblivious wife and child dragged him off.  She stood there, staring at the place in the multitude where the family had disappeared.  Her feet were unwilling to move as again she found herself fighting for breath.<br>
Only seconds passed before, again, she saw a face and felt unfulfilled recognition.  This one though struck fear in her heart.  Their eyes never met yet she felt a different sort of connection.  Wearing nondescript cloths with a lightweight tan cloak and hood he moved easily through the crowd toward some unknown goal.  His eyes shifted about as his feet carried him onward.  He too became one with the mass of people before it came to her.  He was stalking the family, stalking the man.  Terror gripped her heart as she tried to follow his path to no avail.<br>
<br>
How did she know?  But she did.  That one was a killer.  His target was the tall man whose soul she had joined with so briefly.  And again there was no reason for her knowledge.  Nothing to explain how she knew the father or the one who tracked him.  She walked in the general direction the family had gone, hoping to catch a glimpse of them again.<br>
Two full bands she searched without success.   Too many people, too large a city.  Tired, frustrated and scared she reluctantly accepted failure and started back to the Bald Griffin.<br>
It was tenth band by the time she made it back to Denan's inn.  Giving the dwarf only a tired smile, she climbed the stairs to her room.  Exhaustion overtook her as she collapsed, still in cloak and dress, on her bed and fell into a deep but restless sleep.<br>
<br>
She heard a noise.  Not outside she was sure.  Not the cats or the dogs digging through the garbage piled in the alley but a bump from another room.  Swinging her legs down from the bed she dropped to the floor.  Carefully she tucked the necklace and pendant Daddy had given her back in her nightdress and padded in bare feet to her parent's room.<br>
Peering in she saw only her mother's shape in the bed.  Turning, she headed past her room towards the sitting room.  Hearing a voice not her father's she stopped short of the entrance and peeked one eye around the corner.<br>
<br>
She saw her father kneeling, arms wrapped around himself as he stared at the floor.  Over him, a dark figure whispered something, something that scared her.  Her father replied in a harsh, pained voice, &quot;Finish it assassin, but know this.  Your master will not win.  Things greater than he are in motion, events he cannot stop.&quot;<br>
The assassin only hissed as his blade whipped silently across his victim's throat.  The girl watched as her father fell with a muffled thump to the floor, her child's mind not comprehending the tragic event.  She looked up at the assassin just as he noticed her.  Pausing only for a moment, the little girl's life hanging in the balance, he waited for the blink of her eyes, then faded into the shadows.  Staring into nothing, her eyes slowly fell to the floor where the dark form that was her father lay.  She didn't notice the warmth slowly pooling about her feet.<br>
&quot;Daddy?&quot;<br>
&quot;Daddy?&quot;<br>
<br>
Across the city, in a small room in the Bald Griffin, another figure tossed in her sleep and cried out softly.<br>

She awoke, her body aching from oversleep.  Throwing some water on her face from the tub she remembered Megda's words and opened the tap at the bottom.  As the water drained, she found the figurine lying on the floor and retrieved it.  Undamaged from the fall, she ran her fingers over the two women thoughtfully then wrapped them and placed the bundle back in her pack.<br>
Finding her boots, which she had managed to kick off during the night, she shook them out and placed them back on her feet.  Checking her purse and dagger, she left her room and went to the tavern.<br>
<br>
Again the tavern was bare.  From the front she heard a loud banging and peered past the light.  She smiled at the sight she saw.  Denan was seated on the floor, legs splayed out before him with a chair lying in his lap.  With one hand he grasped a chair leg, and holding it against the seat, was banging a nail in with a large hammer.  The heads of a dozen nails protruded from his mouth and his brow was furrowed in concentration.<br>
She quietly walked toward him and waited for a break in his hammering.  &quot;Good night last night Denan?&quot;<br>
He looked up over the chair in annoyance then smiled when he saw the speaker.  Raising one finger he tapped in a final nail, he sat the chair up and used it to raise himself off the floor.<br>
<br>
Spitting the nails into his hands he placed them into a pouch on his belt.  &quot;Aye, only two broke chairs and five glasses, a good night indeed.&quot;  As he seemed serious she held back a laugh.  Apparently the customers could get pretty rowdy.<br>
&quot;You didn't stay for the minstrel last night.&quot;  He left his comment hanging between them, hoping to get her to volunteer how her day had gone.<br>
&quot;I was so tired when I came back I don't think I even heard him.&quot;<br>
&quot;Fear not for your hearing missy, he was on break when you came back.&quot; He paused while he carried the chair to its spot in the room.  Motioning her to the bar he ducked behind it and retrieved his mug and a glass.<br>
<br>
&quot;What did you think of our fine festival?&quot;  He asked, again leaving the question open as he filled her glass.<br>
&quot;It was, nice.&quot;  She stared past the dwarf, realizing the only thing she could remember clearly about the festival was the torch jugglers and the bear trainer.  Her thoughts came again to the man and the little girl.  Then the image of the one who stalked them rose up.<br>
Denan deftly caught her glass as her shaking hands threatened to tip it over.  Placing it to one side the dwarf looked into her unfocused eyes.  Concern was evident in his features as he grasped her hands.  Eyes wet with fear and hopelessness met his.  Her lips parted to say something but nothing came out.<br>
Denan looked upon her and in a quietly forceful voice called back toward the kitchen, &quot;Beloved.&quot;<br>
<br>
He rose from his stool and came around the bar, &quot;Megda!&quot; he called into the kitchen as he passed.  Taking the distraught young woman's hands he guided her from her stool.  Megda came through he swinging door, dusting flour from her hands as she looked questioningly at her husband.  Seeing the woman's state and Denan's nod toward the front door, she swiftly locked it and came to the table the old dwarf was guiding his charge to.<br>
Pulling a chair back she helped her husband seat the girl then took up a chair next to her.  Denan sat next to his wife as they both gave each other worried glances, Denan shrugging his ignorance to the woman's plight.<br>
&quot;Child, child.  What's wrong?  What happened?&quot;<br>
<br>
Tears filled her eyes as she looked at the dwarven matron.  In a torrent it all came out.  Dundare's discovery of her burnt, ravaged body.  Her shattered memories, the visions through a young girl's eyes, the nightmares.  All of it came forth through a storm of tears and frustration, ending in the night's events and the nightmare itself.<br>
&quot;I tried to follow.  To warn them,&quot; she explained through tears that wouldn't cease.  &quot;I couldn't.&quot;  She was trembling violently now, her hands moving about aimlessly trying to grasp something and failing.  &quot;Oh gods, Loreana.  Right before your eyes.  A child, only a little child,&quot; she said, not hearing her own words.<br>
<br>
&quot;Loreana?&quot; said Megda.  &quot;Is that the child's name?&quot;<br>
She looked up at the dwarf and wiped her eyes with the palms of her hands.  &quot;I don't know.&quot; She paused, &quot;Yes, it must be.  Loreana.&quot;  She searched her ragged memories, &quot;Brian.  His name's Brian Shahnra.&quot;  She looked back and forth between the dwarves for an explanation she knew they didn't have.<br>
&quot;How do you know this, child?&quot; asked Megda.  She shook her head in answer.  &quot;Perhaps you heard it somewhere?&quot;<br>
&quot;Not at the fair, or in your vision?&quot; Denan continued.<br>
She shook her head again and placed it in her hands, elbows resting on the table.  &quot;Gods I don't remember anything, and when something does rise out of the depths I still can't make sense of it.&quot;<br>
&quot;Can you remember who he was to you, if anything?  Companion?  Brother?&quot;  He paused, unsure of his next words. &quot;Husband?&quot; he said, fearful of the possible implications.<br>
She shook her head in frustration. &quot;I don't know,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;I need to find them.  Loreana, her mother.  I - I need to know.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And then what?&quot; Megda asked in obvious disapproval. &quot;If this tragedy has happened what will you say?&quot;  She leaned forward, &quot;And what if it hasn't happened?  What if it were only nightmare or even a prediction?&quot;<br>
Again the human shrugged, &quot;I only know I have to find them.&quot;  She paused to rub one eye.  &quot;Like everything else, I don't know why, just that I must.&quot;<br>
Megda nodded. &quot;Then you must follow where your heart leads.&quot;  She looked at her spouse.  It was obvious he didn't approve either.  &quot;But we can help.  Denan can find this family for you.&quot;  He nodded as she continued, &quot;And if they need any help we will give them what we can.&quot;<br>
The woman smiled in thanks.  Megda squeezed her hand and rose from the table.  &quot;Now, I'll go heat some water for you.  Leave your clothes by the door and I'll make sure they get cleaned.&quot;  She patted the girl on the arm as she shuffled up the stairs.<br>
<br>
Denan watched his wife go up then said, &quot;So you intend on seeing the family?&quot;  She nodded.  &quot;Whether this tragedy has happened or not?&quot;  Again she nodded and met his gaze solidly.<br>
&quot;There's so many questions Denan.  So many.&quot;  Her eyes dipped to her hands while she searched for words.  &quot;Who is this little girl?  Why do I feel this tie to her?&quot;<br>
&quot;You know your life may be in danger?&quot;  Denan said firmly.  &quot;This 'Brian Shahnra' may have had some hand in what happened to you.  Perhaps the woman as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That I have to find out too,&quot; she said desperately trying to make Denan understand.  &quot;There's so many possibilities.&quot;  She paused again looking for words.  &quot;What - what if this child's my daughter?&quot;  He looked down at the table.  &quot;A mother's tie to her child is said to be closer than any.&quot;  She grasped his hands.  &quot;If she is, she was taken from me.  Even if this Shahnra man didn't do this to me, somebody did.&quot;  She pulled back, seeming to gain strength from her words.  &quot;Somebody stole my life from me, and perhaps more.  I have nothing but to find out who and why.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye missy,&quot; Denan said with a grim smile.  &quot;You are now sure in your path, and I'll not question it again.&quot;  He placed a broad hand on her wrist.  &quot;But do not forget we are here to help you, in any way we can.  If this is the path you must walk, you need not walk it alone.&quot;  He shook her arm slightly until he received the acknowledgement he wanted.  &quot;Now go up and relax for a bit if you can.  I'll try to find this Shahnra family for you.&quot;  She nodded her thanks and rose.<br>
<br>
Denan watched silently as the young human climbed the steps to her room.  What strange turn of fate, he wondered, would drop such a troubled young woman, human at that, into his and his mate's laps.  His adventuring days were long past, yet this one invigorated him.  Made him long for the days best left behind.<br>
He shook his head, picked up the bottle and glass and went back to the bar to clean up before the evening crowd.<br>

The woman helped now where she was needed, hoping to pay the dwarven couple back in some small measure for their kindness.  Mornings were spent cleaning up and serving the patrons who broke morning fast.  Shopping, cleaning, cooking and even fixing broke furnishings helped pass the time.  In the midday, Denan would go off in search of clues to the locations of the Shahnra family.  It was a large city and he hoped they lived there, for if they had only traveled there for festival he feared he would find no further trace of them.<br>
<br>
Evenings she helped Megda in the kitchen.  Her culinary skills were a great help to Megda, who had lost her other cook two weeks before.  She no longer wore her hood over her head, even though self-conscious of her odd appearance, it was impractical in the kitchen.  Megda convinced her it looked fine, even striking, because in just a couple of days, its length had grown over two inches.<br>
But that wasn't the only thing striking about it.  From her forehead to the nape of her neck, in a two finger wide stripe, her hair had turned snow white.  Denan told her, wisely out of Megda's hearing, that she had nothing to be embarrassed about.  The young men would be beating down the Griffin's doors trying to catch a glimpse of the woman with the short, white striped hair and bright green eyes.<br>
<br>
The second evening she had her chance to hear the minstrel.  He was indeed a fine looking man, some twenty-or-so seasons of age and his music was a wonder to hear. When he stepped up onto the tiny platform that served as the stage the whole room quieted, causing her to look out the door.  He held a small lute up to his ear and plucked a few times.  Satisfied with his tuning he smiled at one of the serving girls and started a quiet ballad, playing a whole verse before lending his voice to the song.  She stood in the doorway, enraptured by the notes that lifted her heart so far above her problems and worries.  A grinning Megda shooed her out as she tried to carry an order to a patron.  Moving to the bar she stood, her heart felt like it was beating in time to the notes that carried across the room.<br>
<br>
His eyes scanned across the room, smiling as he sang to the attentive audience.  When he saw her he grinned broadly and without missing a beat started a lighter song, this one about a beautiful green-eyed girl and her lost love.<br>
Before she knew it the song was over, but she still felt it, and she had to blink when he suddenly appeared before her, bowing deeply.<br>
&quot;Never have such a pair of eyes brought music welling from my soul as yours have on this eve.&quot;  He took her hand and bowed his head, kissing it lightly.  &quot;My name is Pippen deAlain and if the fair lady would honor me so in a dance my happiness could not be contained in a thousand songs.&quot;<br>
She smiled and looked at Denan who, watching him approach, had conveniently turned to inspect a dirty mug.<br>
&quot;But who would play music while we danced Master Pippen?&quot; she asked, feeling unusually mischievous.<br>
&quot;Why, if the song in my heart does not echo across the great Miera itself, then my lute shall play for us,&quot; he replied with equal playfulness.<br>
&quot;A magical lute?&quot; she asked, unable to wipe the huge smile from her face.<br>
&quot;Playing for a magical lady,&quot; he finished, holding out his hand.<br>
&quot;You're a rogue,&quot; she admonished, at the same time she took his hand in hers.<br>
&quot;For you my green-eyed maiden, I shall be anything.&quot;<br>
She laughed the happiest laugh that Denan had yet heard.  It even drew his spouse from behind the door, causing her to look on with wide eyes and wider grin.<br>
<br>
He led her to the head of the room, just before the little stage.  Picking up his instrument he whispered to it and played three chords.  When he placed the lute on his stool, it began playing of its own accord starting with the three notes and taking off into a jolly little number.  Holding one hand he turned to face her and bowed.  She courtsied and they began to dance.<br>
The dance came naturally to her, another facet of her life revealed that itself revealed nothing.  She pushed these thoughts aside as the music took her away, shining a light on her otherwise darkened soul.<br>
<br>
The night went swiftly from there, when she wasn't dancing with Pippen, she helped carry drinks to the patrons, smiling and happily chatting with each as she went.  The bard's music carried her through the evening and after the music stopped and the people filtered out, she found herself sitting with Pippen, talking and laughing.  Greeneyes he called her.  The only awkward moment came when he asked where she came from.  She stumbled for a moment, peering nervously into her glass before Pippen graciously continued.<br>
&quot;Perhaps then the past,&quot; he said with an easy smile that defused the tension, &quot;is best left to historians and other book-worms.&quot;  He filled their glasses and raised his in toast.  &quot;To the future,&quot; she raised her glass to meet his, &quot;and that which will be revealed to us as the gods deem.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes, she found she liked the name, didn't falter, but could have sworn she saw far deeper meaning in his simple words and behind the twinkle in his eye.<br>
<br>
She passed the next day shopping in the market and watching entertainers play for the crowds.  Her thoughts bounced between growing frustration over not being able to find the Shahnra family, and growing anticipation at seeing the young bard again.<br>
Returning to the Bald Griffin, she placed her sacks of breads and fruits on the counter as she gave Megda a questioning look.  A shake of the dwarf's head only evoked a sigh and nod as she helped carry the bundles into the kitchen.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I may have a lead into the Guild of Trades,&quot; Denan proclaimed on his return to the inn a band later.  &quot;There's a league of paperwork in getting any answer from those misers,&quot; he poured himself a mug of a thick, black dwarven brew, &quot;and more than a few silver to pry it from their fingers as well.&quot;  He downed the entire mug as Greeneyes, the name had stuck as soon as the dwarf heard it, gave him a wide-eyed, protesting look.  &quot;Now don't you go on about the money again girl.&quot;  He wiped the froth from his mouth.  &quot;No pauper am I, and if I'm too old to pound trolls with my hammer you'll not take the joy of pounding merchants with my purse.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes couldn't hold her look of reproachment and broke out in laughter as Megda came out to the bar.<br>
&quot;Aye, but a pauper you'll be if you don't get Baris to pay for my glasses he broke,&quot; she shook her fist at Denan causing the human to laugh even more.<br>
&quot;He'll pay woman, he'll pay.  He likes the brew I stock too well and he knows any other tav'keep'd thrown him out long ago.&quot;<br>
She playfully tugged his beard.  &quot;So no luck today?&quot;<br>
&quot;Some perhaps.  One tight-lipped crony let on that he may have heard of one called Shahnra.  After a bit of silver to grease his rusty bones, he said he'd look him up and have an answer on the morrow.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes grabbed Denan by his beard and laid a kiss on him.  The dwarf turned apple-red and found something interesting on his shoes to examine.<br>
&quot;Now child, don't go stealing my mate from me like that,&quot; Megda said playfully.  &quot;You've got your own man to look upon.&quot;  This caused the human to blush even deeper than Denan.  &quot;And you stop blushing you old long-beard,&quot; she said grabbing Denan by the ear and tugging, &quot;or you'll be sleeping on the bar this night.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ach, not again,&quot; he exclaimed.  &quot;I still have splinters in my arse from the last time.&quot;<br>
&quot;Last time?  Last time was when you and old Dagath stayed the whole night regaling each other with tales of fighting demons and gods both.&quot;<br>
&quot;'Twas only one demon.&quot;<br>
&quot;'Twas only an imp it was, and some upstart apprentice.&quot;<br>
&quot;Apprentice?  He was a full wizard, summoning hordes to defend himself.&quot;<br>
The woman left the two dwarves to their play, laughing as she went into the kitchen.  Her own thoughts turning toward a young minstrel, as well as a young, fatherless girl-child.<br>
<br>
The night went well, dancing and singing pushed darker thoughts from her head.  When the minstrel was done for the night, close to the mid-eve change of candle, he invited his green-eyed lady for a walk.<br>
&quot;Will you be moving on after the festival?&quot; she asked as they walked by a stage, darkened after the evening's plays.<br>
&quot;No, not right away.&quot; He looked up at the star-filled sky, &quot;Master Denan is an honorable employer.  He demands the smallest of percentages, saying the crowds I draw more than make up for what he lets me keep.&quot;  He turned slightly towards her as they kept walking.  &quot;As long as I'm wanted, I don't mind staying for the while.&quot;<br>
She stopped walking then and turned fully toward him, smiling shyly.<br>
&quot;Then stay, for a while.  I've not much to give of myself. My past is,&quot; she paused, hesitant to reveal her heart, &quot;a darkened window to me.&quot;  She took his hands in hers, &quot;Only my gratitude for your smile and lovely song shining a beam of sunlight on my heart.&quot;<br>
He tentatively placed his hand on her cheek and was rewarded with a smile and accepting caress.<br>
&quot;Then my lovely Greeneyes, that is all the reason there is for me to stay.&quot;<br>

She closed her eyes and held the hand he laid on her cheek.  The bard's lightly callused fingertips brushed the line of her jaw.  She looked up at him and smiled, his gray-blue eyes and boyish face reflected the happiness she felt.<br>
His smile turned to a look of concern, then fear when he saw her eyes roll back in her head, and a long, pained moan escaped her lips.<br>
<br>
Wind whipped her hair like the long grasses of the northern plains.  Somewhere nearby a hawk screeched as it firmed its grip on the perch.  The smell of tallow smoke and scented herbs filled her nostrils.  <br>
She was in a small place.  Books, jars and other, stranger devices lined shelves all around her.  A cave, grown inside the trunk of an elder tree where the wood itself formed the shelves and four rounded windows and low door.  Again she found herself in a runed circle, kneeling this time.  Across from her lay another, larger circle also inscribed with words and a large symbol at each compass point.  A black candle sat in the center of each rune, they had been burning for a while and threatened to completely cover the deep inscriptions.<br>
<br>
A low chanting echoed through the chamber and it was a moment before she realized the indecipherable words came from her own lips.  There was a fear that came with the strange words and dark rhythm, fear but also exhilaration.  The words echoed louder and louder, beating in time with her heart, or perhaps her heart beat to the rhythm instead.<br>
A new scent mixed with that of smoke and herbs.  The stench carried on the winds from a field after battle, the smell of death and rot.  The gale that blew through the tree did not blow away the scent, the wind itself was death and it screamed through the small openings and doorway, the banshee-wail rose and fell to her words.  And though the strands of her hair snapped like whips, the hawk huddled down on his perch and candle flames lay on their sides, the flames did not go out, no book or jar or device even rattled in its stand.  <br>
<br>
A hulking, dark shadow formed in the other circle.  Her words ceased and with them, the wind, but the scent of death only grew.  Menacingly it stood there, it's huge form hidden in shadows that clung to it and she prayed those shadows would not fall away to reveal what lurked behind them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Remember our pact, Witch,&quot; its voice was that of splintering bones and tearing flesh.  &quot;Twice called.  Twice served.  Twice will the path be walked.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her mouth opened in a silent scream, she collapsed into her minstrel's arms.<br>
<br>
Megda guided the guardsman up the stairs, the ashen young woman cradled in his arms.  Once Denan vouched for the young bard's honor, he and his fellows bid them well and good night and clattered their way back onto the streets.<br>
Denan was at the bar, arguing some point or another about the quality of steel when the boy had burst into the tavern, the guardsman and his burden close behind.  Megda threw open the kitchen door at the ruckus and, seeing the girl held in the big man's arms, ran to her.  Checking for life in the pale woman, she shooed the other two guards away and beckoned the one up the stairs while Denan sent curious customers back to their chairs under threat of bodily harm.<br>
<br>
The guard gently lay the girl like a sleeping child upon her bed and Megda assured him she had only passed out and was not injured.  Satisfied no crime had been committed he wished them well.  He offered to deliver a healer which Megda assured him was not necessary, then hurried off to meet his fellows.<br>
Denan and Pippen slid past the departing guard and practically ran into the room.  Megda hushed them as she placed a cool cloth on the woman's forehead.  Seeing Pippen standing to one side looking more like a lost child than a young man, she waved him to her.<br>
&quot;She is resting now and should not be disturbed.&quot;  The color had returned to Greeneyes face and aside from her short hair being matted with sweat, appeared to be sleeping easily.  &quot;We'd best leave her be.  I'll check on her again in a band or so.&quot;<br>
<br>
The bard dropped on one knee and took one of the sleeping woman's hands in his.<br>
&quot;Please Megda,&quot; he pleaded quietly as he looked from his stricken lady to the dwarf.  &quot;Allow me to watch over her.  I won't disturb her.  I swear on my honor.  I -&quot;<br>
&quot;Shh my dear lad.  Stay with her then.  I shall bring you some water and a new cloth for her head in a bit.&quot;<br>
He smiled in gratitude and looked at Denan who nodded his approval before following his wife out the door.<br>
The young musician turned his eyes to the woman who had so easily captured his heart and laid a gentle kiss on her forehead.  Resting one arm on the edge of her bed, his hand grasping hers, he laid his head in the crook of his elbow.  His gaze never strayed from the beautiful woman's face until exhaustion took him also into a light, if uneasy, sleep.<br>
<br>
Morning came and went.  Denan took care of his morning tavern duties then went out to see what had been found on the Shahnra family.  Megda checked on Pippen and Greeneyes.  Pippen looked up as she entered and offered a tired smile.  She saw the dark rings around his eyes and the lines on his face and wondered at how much older humans looked when they didn't sleep well.  The woman, on the other hand, looked greatly improved.  She rested easily, never stirring as the dwarf placed a plate with bread, cheese and a pastry in the bard's hands.  Leaving a jug of water and cup near him, she checked on her patient.  She gave Pippen a satisfied nod before leaving them alone again.<br>
He was staring out the window over the afternoon crowds when she slipped up beside him and took his hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;You've been here the whole time,&quot; she said, more a statement than a question.  He turned to her and gave her a slight smile.<br>
Her handsome young minstrel looked ten years older.  Dark rings under his eyes and lines on his forehead drew a small gasp from her.<br>
&quot;Oh gods, Pippen,&quot; she whispered and put a hand to his face.<br>
&quot;I - I was worried,&quot; his voice cracked.  &quot;You just started shaking and,&quot; he paused, a haunted look coming over his face, &quot;then you fainted.  The look on your face though,&quot; he shook his head as words failed him.<br>
She placed a finger to his lips to gently silence him.  &quot;I'm so sorry.&quot;  He didn't deserve this she thought.  How could she drag someone like him into her own private torment?   Denan and Megda had at least offered help and willingly accepted her troubles as their own.  Pippen had no idea, no warning that the woman he had so completely fallen for was a ghost with no past but shattered visions and dreams, some frighteningly evil.  Her future, just as unsure, was not something to step into without warning.<br>
<br>
Somehow he saw all this in her eyes and stopped her before she could speak.<br>
&quot;No.  I'll not be sent away because of this.&quot;  He drew his head up and held her shoulders firmly.  &quot;You frightened me, to that I'll admit freely.  I thought - I thought I'd lost you.  But I'll not just walk away without at least an explanation.  I'm no child, let me decide for myself.&quot;  His eyes stared firmly into hers, the haggard looking young bard gone, replaced by a grown man ready and willing to stand against the world if need be.  She saw this change and nodded even as she leaned forward into his arms.  They held each other while she waited for the strength to tell her brief story again.<br>

As with the dwarves, she told him everything.  They sat upon her bed, looking out over the afternoon crowd.  He sat in rapt attention, holding her hands tightly, letting her know he was listening, urging her through difficult spots.  And after she told him everything, when he pulled her to him and laid her head on his shoulder and held her, when his silent compassion gave her more comfort than any words could, she told him more.<br>
<br>
She told him of her fear.  Her fear of having a past once unseen reveal itself to be a thing of nightmares, of evil.  She was scared the images of what she saw would eventually drive her insane, or worse.   How was she to balance what Dundare warned of unseen enemies with her desire, her need for companionship, for somebody to hold to when she saw only darkness around her.<br>
<br>
Dundare, Megda, Denan and Pippen, beautiful Pippen.  They helped her find the strength to do more than hide away from her fears.  Had she ever known anyone like them, even one of them?  Was there a Dundare in her life before?  A father and teacher, and all in the most gentle of ways.  Or Denan and Megda?  Two strangers who went so far out of their way in kindness to nothing more than another customer among hundreds.<br>
<br>
And sweet Pippen.  The music of his heart was greater than that played by any hand and even in his quiet embrace she knew he would hold her until the darkness and fire went away.<br>
There was one question still to be asked.  No matter what his compassionate embrace might say now, she needed to hear his answer.<br>
&quot;What if this is who I was, who I am?  Evil.&quot;  She pulled away from him to look him straight in the eyes. &quot;What if I regain my memories?  What if I was some horrid creature thought destroyed, but reborn?&quot;<br>
He reached out to stroke her chin, &quot;What if you're a tavern cook with a penchant for writing horrid little plays for some second rate stage company?&quot;<br>
The utter illogic of his question quite suddenly brought her mind to a halt.<br>
<br>
&quot;My point is, you can fill a book with 'What Ifs' just before you drive yourself mad.&quot;  He took her hands in his. &quot;The answer to all of your 'what ifs' is: I will still be here.  You have so fully captured my heart and soul I cannot imagine how I wrote a song, or played or lived without you there to be my inspiration.&quot;  He kissed her hands, then her lips.  &quot;Anyone who has ever said they've figured out love is wrong.  Love is what you feel, what you do, what you are, without thought.&quot;  <br>
<br>
He placed his mouth close to her ear and whispered, &quot;I don't ask why I feel this way because I know there is no quick answer.  I am under your spell my Greeneyes.  I am drawn to everything about you, even what I don't know.  And I want to discover it with you.  Every revelation.  Every nightmare.  Every joy.  I want to be there to comfort you, to hold you, to laugh and cry with you.  Why is not a question I'll answer, only that I will.&quot;  He looked her in the eyes, &quot;Because I love you Greeneyes.  Just because.&quot;<br>

Her stomach was rumbling when she finally came down the stairs.  They had held each other for a long time before she finally shooed him away so she could bathe and change.  The solemness of their conversation had finally given way to teasing and laughing and they parted with smiles and a lingering kiss.<br>
Megda beckoned her to a table near the bar and hurried into the kitchen.  Greeneyes sat down as the dwarf brought her a late lunch of rabbit, soft bread and cheese.  A flagon of water and glass of wine sat there already.<br>
<br>
&quot;I knew you would be hungry,&quot; she set down the plate before the girl.  &quot;Master Pippen came down all smiles and song, so I gathered this for you.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes looked around the room for her bard.<br>
&quot;I sent him to the market for more bread.  He'll be back shortly.&quot;<br>
&quot;And Denan?&quot; she was hungry for the answer she knew wasn't there.<br>
&quot;Nay, nothing yet.&quot; She shook her head. &quot;But he's off talking to that merchant he mentioned yesterday.&quot;&quot; She patted Greeneye's shoulder as she returned to the kitchen.  &quot;He'll find them child, don't you worry.&quot;<br>
The woman looked out the door before turning her attention to her meal.  She wasn't as sure as Denan's mate was, but for the moment it was the only hope she had.<br>
<br>
Finishing her meal she let Megda know she was going out and pushed her way into the afternoon crowd.  She wandered, making her way slowly toward the market where she picked up a few fruits and a sack of fresh bread baked into long, thin rolls.<br>
She continued on, picking through silk and cloth of all colors, brass and porcelain trinkets, and carved wood.  She smiled at merchants and waved at children, soon finding herself walking through what must have been a sector of the city devoted to various gods and religions.  She wondered at the temples, shrines and churches that lined the street.  Worshippers and passing pedestrians filled the street, parting for the occasional wagon or horse.  Acolytes stood before their temples and yelled out into the crowd the benevolence of this god, mercy of that goddess, all sounding like just another merchant hawking their wares.<br>
<br>
Passing one side street, she saw what could have only been a funeral procession.  Standing on a corner, absorbed in the slow march, she felt a strange sadness come over her as the mourners drew closer.  Emptiness, loss and an even greater sense of confusion began to overwhelm her.  He was gone and there was nothing she could do about it.  Mommy said to be brave and she promised she would.<br>
<br>
Greeneyes head jerked up as she looked around anxiously for the thoughts that were not hers.  Thoughts that could only come from a fatherless girl-child named Loreana.<br>
There, in the second row of marchers.  Her small figure previously hidden by the adults before her.  Next to the girl her flame-haired mother, trying to hold back tears of grief.  Another woman held her shoulders, whispering words of comfort.  Loreana held the hand of an elderly man whose attention was drawn to a younger man next to him.  Loreana dropped his hand to march alone.  She was quite the sight, Greeneyes thought.  Dressed in a pretty robe of sky-blue tied with a white sash that matched the white ribbon laced through her long, chestnut hair.  Her eyes were puffy but tearless as she looked at those around her.  Then her head turned to the woman and their eyes met.<br>
<br>
Greeneyes felt her soul fall into the child's eyes.  They stared at each other briefly before the girl smiled softly and waved.  Greeneyes could only smile weakly back as her strength left her.<br>
Loreana was gone from view before she felt her legs again, then she saw the funeral bier and the world around her came to a halt.  Mourners walking with the procession slowed to a crawl, the low conversation turned into the drone of bees as she finally saw the one who lay in state.<br>
The body lay upon a platform carried by four men.  It was mercifully draped over with multiple cloths of different shades of blue.  This image only lightly touched her awareness though while another burned through her mind.<br>
<br>
The man, the father Brian, placing something around her neck, around Loreana's neck.<br>
&quot;Keep this with you always my beloved.&quot;  The only words she heard as the vision left her as swiftly as it came.<br>
The image faded and looking around she realized the procession was long gone, the sun had moved at least a band in its travels.  Confused and helpless, the woman started back to the Bald Griffin in a daze, the fruits and bread left to sit on the corner for someone else to claim.<br>
 <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://drakksnet.homestead.com/files/Ghost.gif height=50 width=60" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/5/01 10:40:21 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 12</span><hr size=1> <br>
Another band passed before she found the Griffin.  Now well into the after-midday crowd, the tavern was packed and she stood in the doorway until a patron pushed his way by her.  Shaken from her daze she weaved her way to the bar and quickly claimed a vacated stool.<br>
&quot;There you are Greeneyes.&quot;  Denan waved a bar rag at her and passed two mugs to one of the servers.  Making his way to where she sat he recognized the look on her face that was becoming more and more familiar.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ach, again lass you have the look of ghost fright.  Another vision?&quot;<br>
She smiled weakly.  &quot;Yes.  But it was like the first time I saw Loreana.&quot;  She nodded to his questioning look.  &quot;I saw her again.&quot;  Nodding again when he silently offered her a drink she continued.  &quot;It was like I was led to her.  I was just wandering after going to the market.&quot;  She drank deeply from the glass and motioned for another.  &quot;I came to a street with temples and shrines.&quot;<br>
&quot;Aye,&quot; Denan nodded.  &quot;The Walk of Faith.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And as I stood on the corner, wondering which way to go next, I -&quot; she paused while her hands formed her words, &quot;I felt her.  I felt her sadness and confusion.  Wondering when her father would come back but knowing he wouldn't.&quot;  She took a sip this time, feeling the tingle as it went down.<br>
&quot;She was in the funeral march, walking there with her mother and others.  She saw me and waved, like she knew me.&quot;  She stared into the glass before continuing.  &quot;Then I saw him.  Where he lay anyway, and that's when the vision came.&quot;<br>
Again pausing, her face screwing up as she tried to put into words what she had seen.  &quot;He was giving her something.  I saw it through her eyes like before.  A necklace or pendant, but there was such sadness in him.   He told her to always keep it.&quot;  Shaking her head she looked at the dwarf, &quot;Again I don't understand.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Greeneyes!  Beloved!&quot;  Hearing the endearment again caused her to start, then she realized it was Pippen shouting across the room.  He was at her side in a moment and didn't notice the somberness of the two he rushed to meet.<br>
&quot;So did Master Denan give you the news?&quot;  He received a disapproving glare from the dwarf.<br>
&quot;Nay young jaybird, I didn't.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh,&quot; his gaze dipped to the floor. &quot;I'm sorry, I -&quot;<br>
&quot;Nay lad, it's all right with it.  Your fair lady here had another vision this aftmidday.&quot;<br>
&quot;I didn't -&quot; he looked at her as she smiled at his concern.<br>
&quot;I am fine my love, better now that you are here.&quot;  She kissed him lightly to show her forgiveness and brushed her hand across his cheek.  &quot;Fine.  Now what news is it that Denan holds?&quot;  She grasped one of the bard's hands anxiously.<br>
&quot;I was to say that I had found the Shahnra family, though it seems you did already.&quot;<br>
She shook her head, &quot;When I came to my senses, though it seemed only moments had passed, the procession was gone.  I had no idea where to pursue them.&quot;<br>
Pippen looked between the two of them in confusion.  She gave him a look that told him she would retell the story later.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where?  Where are they Denan?  I know now that the father Brian is dead, whether by the events I saw or otherwise.  I still must see them.  The connection I feel with the girl still begs explanation, or exploration in the least.&quot;  She looked at Pippen then Denan, begging them to understand.<br>
They did.  Denan had many years and many quests under his belt.  Many times over he had seen the fire that burned in the young woman's eyes.  More than once his eyes held the same fire.<br>
Pippen, though not a seasoned adventurer, likened the quest to the fierce, unexplainable love he felt for her.  His nod and caress were all she needed to know she was not alone.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alone?  But why?&quot;  Pippen asked insistently.<br>
&quot;They don't know me.  I don't want to frighten them after what's happened.&quot; Greeneyes explained, though sounding unsure of herself.  As much as she wanted him, she still felt guilty for bringing all of her troubles into the young bard's life.<br>
&quot;They don't know you, aye.&quot;  He said as he gathered her into his arms.  &quot;And you don't know them.  They may be tied very closely to why things are as they are.&quot;  He brought her gaze up to his.  &quot;Why the old hermit found you nigh dead.&quot;  His words intentionally brash as he pushed his point.  He felt her body soften as she acquiesced.   Away from the crowds in her room, they kissed and held each other, watching the shadows shorten in the square below.<br>
<br>
The Shahnra family resided in one of the merchant's districts near the waterfront.  Half a bands walk from the Bald Griffin, the home lay behind a stone fence enclosing a small grassy area.  To one side of the home, an attached store belonging to Brian and Merrie held a variety of wood furnishings and other small items for sale.<br>
Greeneyes and Pippen approached the little home with growing anxiety.  She fought down the fear of meeting, even confronting someone who may know far more about her than she did.  Pippen as well felt they were walking into danger.  He was certain that someone associated with the Shahnra family, even one of them, was very familiar with the crime committed against his Greeneyes.  Disposing of one spouse in favor of another was an event not limited to ballads and poems.<br>
<br>
Standing before the iron gate that led through the fence, she reached for the latch then paused.  Pippen looked toward the house then turned to her.  &quot;You still don't have to do this.&quot;<br>
She shot him a look that instantly made him regret his comment, then opened the gate and walked through.<br>
Halfway across the path through the grass the door opened.  A woman Greeneyes recognized as the one from the funeral stood expectantly in the doorway.<br>
She was at a loss for words.  What was she to say to this woman, or to the widow Merrie herself, that wouldn't come off as a madwoman's rantings?<br>
<br>
&quot;Please grant us forgiveness Ma'am for our intrusion, but M'Lady has some small hope she can offer the grieving family help in their tragedy.&quot;  Pippen saw his beloved's sudden helplessness and jumped in, much to her relief.  The woman, on the other hand, did not look quite as gracious.<br>
&quot;Help?  What help can you offer that the Guard cannot?&quot; she asked suspiciously.<br>
&quot;My Lady has been suffering visions of late.&quot;  He knew suddenly it was the wrong approach, but it was too late to recant now.  &quot;Visions that keep her awake at night and torment her days.  One, not four nights ago, of a man killed in his own home before the eyes of his small daughter.&quot;  Pippen's stomach rolled, he had said too much, he knew it.<br>
&quot;What do you know about it?&quot;  The widow stepped into the doorway, nodding at her companion.  Her eyes were red and wet and she looked like she had not seen sleep since her husband's murder.  &quot;You come to my door, spouting about visions and such,&quot; she stammered, tears beginning to fall anew.  &quot;Who's to say you're not a couple o' charlatans come to prey on my family?&quot;<br>
Pippen bowed his head and sighed.  He then looked the flame-haired woman in the eyes. &quot;I can only give my word Ma'am, but we hoped to answer questions that you may have as well as many M'Lady has.&quot;<br>
<br>
A small head of brown peeked from around the door.  &quot;Hi greeneyed lady.  I knew you were here.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh?&quot; She looked askance at Pippen.<br>
The girl nodded and pushed her way past her mother.  &quot;Uh huh.  I saw you, up here,&quot; she said, touching her head with the palm of her hand.<br>
Greeneyes knelt down before the girl, biting a knuckle to keep the tears back.  &quot;You did?&quot;  She was barely choking back the urge to cry in relief that maybe she wasn't going crazy.<br>
&quot;It's ok to cry.  Mommy said so.  He can't come back, but we'll see him again someday.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes nodded as the little girl reached up to wipe a tear from the lady's cheek.  Pippen heard a small sound escape from her mother.<br>
&quot;Did your father give -&quot; She never finished her question.  The girl's touch brought the fire back to her mind.  The fire and much more.<br>
<br>
Images upon images flashed faster than she could comprehend.  Brian's murder, the demon's summoning, hideous creatures and dark magics.  And the fire, always the fire.<br>
Pippen watched helplessly as his love's eyes rolled up in her head and a wail of anguish rose from deep within her.  Loreana was crying with fear.  Amazingly, she had moved to hold the woman in a fierce hug instead of running.  Her mother's fear turned swiftly to terror before she moved to pull Loreana away.  The girl had an iron lock around Greeneye's neck and had to be pried free by both her mother and her friend.<br>
&quot;GO!&quot; she screamed as she pulled Loreana through the doorway.  &quot;Take your witch and get away from my home and away from my daughter!&quot;  The door slammed shut and a slide could be heard drawing across.<br>
<br>
Pippen could only gather the woman he loved into his arms and carry her beyond the gate.  Her head on his shoulder, he could hear her softly crying &quot;Loreana, no.&quot; over and over.<br>
Pippen knew his suspicions were true, he had seen the proof with his own eyes.<br>
&quot;Shh, my beloved, don't cry&quot; he spoke softly as he carried her homeward.  His breath was ragged with fear for her.  &quot;Did you see her Beloved?  She was beautiful wasn't she?&quot;  He crooned to her hoping to silence her cries.  &quot;Lovely brown hair, and her eyes my love.  Did you see her eyes?&quot;  This more than even the child's touch had convinced him.<br>
&quot;They were green my love, as green as yours.&quot;  Now he was crying, desperation and fear creeping into his voice as he tried to calm the lady he held tight to his breast.  &quot;She had your eyes, love.  Your eyes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Behind the doorway of the Shahnra home, a mother cried as she too held a little green-eyed lady to her breast.  The girl hugged back, tears still flowing.<br>

The lunch crowd was in full swing, but there was no sign of the dwarves so he immediately carried her upstairs.  His legs were threatening to give out as he pushed the door to her room open and nearly dropped her on the bed.  His throat too raw and breath too ragged to call for help, he dropped his head in exhaustion and knelt by the bed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Master Pippen?&quot;  One of the serving girls poked her head around the corner.  &quot;Master Pippen, Lewell said he saw - Oh.&quot; She took a sharp breath when she saw his red face, sweat matted hair and Greeneyes' pale face.  &quot;I'll go get Megda!&quot;<br>
&quot;Nay, nay Sarah,&quot; he waved the girl down.  &quot;Just bring some cool water in a jug and a cloth.&quot;  She curtsied and left the room.<br>
Pippen picked up a towel hanging on the edge of the bed and wiped his head and eyes.  Moments later the girl was back with the jug and cloth.<br>
&quot;Thank you Sarah dear.  Please, don't bother Megda or Denan with this, at least until the lunch crowd departs, unless they ask.  They are busy enough and my love appears to be doing fine now.&quot;<br>
&quot;As you say Pippen,&quot; a tinge of jealousy creeping into her voice.  She turned and left the room with a twist of her dress.<br>
He smiled.  She was a pretty girl and had shown her interest in Pippen some months ago.  In any other time or place he perhaps would have returned her attentions, but now there was only one who held his world in thrall.<br>
Lightly he kissed the brown-haired, green-eyed woman he loved and then lay his head on her shoulder to listen to the sounds of her breathing and his together.<br>
<br>
&quot;I should have told you when we came back. I should -&quot;<br>
&quot;Nay lad, don't blame yourself.  The healer said it would have made no difference.&quot;  Denan came back to Greeneyes' room after seeing the healer off.  &quot;Her mind suffered a terrible trauma, but has already begun to heal itself.  She said your lass should be fine in a day or so.&quot;  He looked at the sleeping woman and sighed.  Even the ghosts that haunted him left his sanity intact.  Nothing the occasional all-nighter with old friends couldn't take care of.<br>
&quot;You should have seen her Master Denan.  She was the spitting image of M'Lady.  If they're not blood then -&quot; He shook his head, there was no other choice.<br>
<br>
Pippen had explained his theory to Denan and while it sounded as good as any, the old dwarf cautioned the boy against accusing somebody without solid evidence.  The magistrate didn't work off of feelings and vague resemblances.<br>
&quot;Don't work yourself into a frenzy over this Pippen m'lad.  Despite our offerings of aid and comfort, it's up to your fair lady there to pursue this.&quot;  He looked at her again.  &quot;And right now she's not fit to pursue anything.&quot;<br>
Pippen looked at Greeneyes as she tossed about restlessly.<br>
&quot;Remember the healer's words.  Let her rest and talk to her, she can hear you.&quot;  Denan turned to leave and patted the young human on the arm.  &quot;Just don't wear yourself out.  And it's up to you whether you want to play tonight of course, but you need rest too.&quot;  He gave the girl a last look before returning to his work.<br>
<br>
&quot;What did the healer say Denan?&quot; Megda asked quietly when her spouse entered the kitchen.  He shook his head and picked up his apron.  &quot;What she had to say wasn't good m'love.  Her mind's fairly scrambled.&quot;  He retrieved a rag from the sink and paused.  &quot;She said something's changed in the girl, upstairs I mean,&quot; he tapped his head.  &quot;More'n likely she'll wake up in a day or so, but -&quot; again he paused and looked directly at his mate.  &quot;She may not be all there, as it were.  Not just a lack of memories, no she accounted for that.&quot;  Again he wavered, not wanting to repeat the healer's words.  &quot;Greeneyes may be nothing more than a child in a woman's body now.&quot;<br>
<br>
A brief second more he stood there, then snapping his towel he turned and left to serve his customers, or clean his mug, or do anything to keep his thoughts on something else.  Megda stood silently for a long while before wiping her hands on her own apron and picking up a stirring spoon.  &quot;Nay, she'll be fine,&quot; she said to herself with more confidence than she felt.  &quot;There's something special 'bout her there is.&quot;<br>
Pippen would have agreed, as anyone would if they had seen the young bard speaking quietly to the young woman well into the evening hours.  Only once did he leave her room, and only to retrieve his lute.<br>
<br>
It was near three bands to midnight, during one of those rare times when a tavern grows unnaturally quiet.  It was one of those times when the patrons all at once take a pull on a mug or pick through muddled brains for the next thing to say that they heard it.  As the Griffin grew quieter still, so quiet Megda and Sarah poked their heads from the door to see what was amiss, the sound slowly drifted down.  The music of the lute carried the bard's voice down into the tavern.  The words were muffled, but the slow, sad tones brought a tear to many drinkers' eyes.  Lovingly he played for her into the wee hours and the tavern had never been so crowded yet so silent.  Newcomers were hushed as they slammed loudly through the doors and any talk received baleful looks from neighbors.  <br>
When the music stopped, and Denan declared last round, then finally closing time, they all quietly filed out looking more like they departed a sad but beautiful play or music recital rather than a dwarf's rowdy tavern.<br>
<br>
The next day little had changed.  Greeneyes' sleep was fitful, providing her caretakers no end of worry.  Pippen spent more time in the main room of the tavern and tried to keep himself busy.  Megda and Denan had plenty to do as usual, but found time to check on their patient often.  Megda left a small plant with delicate yellow flowers upon the windowsill to brighten the room.  Denan would fumble about, furiously cleaning his mug until guided out by his mate.<br>
A long day turned into a longer night.  Megda insisted Pippen take a bed into Greeneyes' room so that at least he wouldn't have to sleep on the floor.  He relented and with Denan's help carried a wooden cot from an empty room.  He wondered how he'd sleep anyway with the moans and small cries coming from his lady but exhaustion won out and he soon fell into a deep sleep.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pippen!  Pippen!  Some ice, quickly now!&quot;  The young bard awoke with a start at Megda's shout.  &quot;Ice!  A lot!&quot;  She repeated so the words would make it through his sleep-addled head.<br>
Rubbing one eye as he rolled out of his bed he glanced at the dwarf then at Greeneyes.  The sight spurred him into motion.  The woman lying near him was soaked in sweat.  Her skin was covered in fierce red blotches and her breath came ragged and shallow.  Running downstairs in nothing more than his bedclothes he dashed to the kitchen across an otherwise empty tavern.  Pippen wouldn't have noticed if the inn was full of customers all seated to watch him, such was his intensity.  Grabbing the large bucket Denan used to fill the icebox he crossed the kitchen and flung open the wooden and metal ice freezer.  The crate had minor magics built into it to freeze water and keep it frozen.  Pippin noticed to his dismay that more ice needed to be broken from the block inside and started to attack it with the spike and hammer hanging nearby. <br>
<br>
It seemed like hours passed before he had filled the bucket and his hands were numb with cold as he hurried as fast as the awkward load would allow him back to the room.  Megda grabbed the bucket from Pippen and dumped its contents around and on Greeneyes upper body.  Wrapping some smaller chips of ice in the rag she then placed it on the girl's forehead.<br>
&quot;Sarah's gone for Jhahela,&quot; she said, leaving further words unspoken.  Pippen nodded and took Greeneyes' hands in his own.  Gods she was burning up.  Bringing her palm to his cheek, he talked quietly to her, willing her to heal with all his heart and mind.<br>
A full band passed before Sarah burst into the room.  &quot;Mistress Jhahela is here Megda.&quot;<br>
&quot;Thank you dear.  Make sure you inform my mate of what's happened when he returns from the Magistrate.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes Ma'am.&quot;  The girl bowed slightly to the healer as she came through the door, then rushed downstairs.<br>
<br>
Jhahela, priestess of Lor, the goddess of life, silently approached the bed and knelt, her white robe puddling around her feet.<br>
&quot;I feared this,&quot; she whispered eliciting a terrified look from Pippen.  &quot;Her visions and dreams are overwhelming her, damaging her physically now.&quot;  She placed her hand on Greeneyes' forehead and closed her eyes.<br>
After a moment she looked up at the two standing over her.  &quot;Megda Ironland, would you willingly give of your life and breath to help this one?&quot;<br>
Megda solemnly nodded, &quot;I will.&quot;<br>
Jhahela looked at the bard, &quot;Pippen -&quot;<br>
&quot;Uh, deAlain,&quot; he said after a hesitant moment.  &quot;Pippen deAlain.&quot;<br>
&quot;Pippen deAlain, would you willingly give of your life and breath to help this one?&quot;  He paused, looking from Megda to the healer.  &quot;Do you understand what I ask?&quot;<br>
&quot;I - I do,&quot; he looked at the dwarf again.  &quot;I've just never seen, uh -&quot; he cleared his throat and tried to calm his voice.  &quot;I will.  Anything.  Please help her.&quot;<br>
&quot;Both of you grasp my right hand with both of your hands.&quot;  She held up her right hand like a lightning rod above her.  Megda had to reach up to grasp it while Pippen reached out to wrap his around last.<br>
<br>
Mistress Jhahela placed the open palm of her left hand upon Greeneyes breastbone, feeling the fire that burned inside the young woman.<br>
Closing her eyes again, she began to chant.  The words were not the common Andarian, though Pippen thought he heard the name of Lor invoked.<br>
He could feel his heartbeat, magnified a hundred times.  Then another joined it, beating in time to his.  A third, then a fourth, the last rapid and weak, all beating against his breast like they were his own.  He closed his eyes as a wave of dizziness washed over him.  He felt it, his heart and the two others faded slightly while the fourth strengthened, its beat slowing and getting louder.  He felt the very force of life within him pulled away, but only a little, and channeled through Jhahela into Greeneyes.  He no longer heard her cries, but instead, a faint sigh and the regular breathing of rest.<br>
How much time passed he didn't know.  Jhahela continued her whispered chant.  Megda and Pippen, now in a meditative state, swayed slowly in time to her rhythm.  When she stopped chanting, Pippen opened his eyes and looked at the healer then at Megda.  Megda nodded and smiled softly, nodding toward Greeneyes.<br>
<br>
He released his grip and looked at her.  She lay still, breathing softly, her skin a pale but otherwise healthy pink.  No sounds other than her breathing came from her as she slept peacefully.<br>
&quot;Is she -&quot; Pippen asked hesitantly.<br>
&quot;She rests now,&quot; Jhahela said with a sigh.  &quot;Another day perhaps, though I still cannot promise the state her mind will be in when she awakes.<br>
&quot;Her memories?&quot; <br>
&quot;Those are beyond me.&quot;  She shook her head in ill-concealed confusion.  &quot;Not blocked, but gone, as if they never existed.&quot;<br>
&quot;A simulacrum?&quot; Megda asked, receiving a look of confusion from Pippen.<br>
&quot;No.  I would have easily seen that at first touch.&quot;  She shook her head again as she pushed herself up.  &quot;Someone, something has completely erased her memories, yet somehow left her the capability of speech, social skills, deductive reasoning, everything that makes one intelligent and mature.&quot;  Looking once more at her patient she then bowed to Pippen then Megda.  &quot;In this, We cannot help.&quot;<br>
Megda nodded, &quot;We thank you and your order for their faithful service Mistress Jhahela.  I will send Sarah to see you before the sun sets.&quot;  Megda returned the bow.<br>
&quot;Our duty is but to serve.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pippen watched as the healer left.  &quot;Send Sarah to see her?&quot; he asked when Jhahela's footsteps faded down the stairs.<br>
&quot;Megda smiled and placed a hand on Greeneyes' forehead.<br>
&quot;Even those whose duty it is to serve must pay the rent.&quot;<br>
His response was a grin as he turned to look at Greeneyes.  &quot;Seems like we've been doing this 'ere since we met,&quot; he said forlornly.  &quot;This is no way to live.&quot; His gaze turned to Megda.  &quot;How can we live like this?&quot;<br>
She grasped his arm and shook him lightly.  &quot;Now don't you go giving up like that.&quot;  She glanced briefly at the empty doorway.  &quot;Love's not a journey through a patch o' daisies.  Songs are good for one's heart, but sometimes the song is not so happy.  Times are that only your will and heart will get you through.  Your love is tested, and if you pass?&quot; she nodded as if speaking from an old lesson.  &quot;So don't give up lad.  I told her myself when we first met and I'll tell you.  There's something special about this lady, but she needs someone.&quot;  She shook his arm gently again.  &quot;She needs you.&quot;  He looked at her then at Greeneyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;I need her too. I love her.&quot;  He paused.  &quot;There is something special about her.  I've met many a lass, many good women like Sarah.  This one though.&quot;  He took her hand and bent over to kiss her gently.  &quot;I love you my green-eyed lady,&quot; he whispered.  Closing his eyes he ran his fingers through her hair, through the soft mix of brown and white.  &quot;Anything my love, anything.&quot;<br>
Megda quietly turned and, as before, left them to be alone.<br>

&quot;Shady dealings?&quot;  Pippen said, more loudly than he should have.  &quot;Shady enough to get him killed?&quot; he said in a tone more to the dwarf's liking.<br>
&quot;Apparently so.  His wife of course can't believe it.&quot;  He took a stiff pull from his mug.  &quot;She's been cleared of the crime, but isn't handling the event well.&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't imagine our trip over there helped.&quot;  He looked down at his drink, as yet untouched.  &quot;Is Loreana...  Did she...&quot; he couldn't finish his words.<br>
&quot;The child's fine, or so it appears.  There's not a word said about your visit either.&quot;  Denan waved his rag at a calling bar patron and left Pippen to his thoughts.<br>
Shady dealings, a murdered father, an attempted murder.  That and an inexplicable and undeniable link to a little girl that went beyond the ties of a mother and child.<br>
Pippen's head swam with the mystery surrounding Greeneyes.  Did the shady dealings involve her?  Was she used to get to Brian?  Did he rid himself of her or just remarry?  Pippen shook his head and took a drink from his neglected glass.<br>
Rising from the bar he waved to Denan.  This mystery had brought the woman he loved dearly to death's door more than once.  The one who committed the foul deed may or may not be dead, but the mystery was nowhere near finished.<br>
He plodded up the stairs to check on Greeneyes.  She had awoken earlier that afternoon and, while appearing to have retained her faculties, was sullen and quiet.  Only her caress and whispered &quot;My love, do not worry&quot; had provided him some comfort.  Tonight he would play for the tavern's crowd.  He knew she would hear him through the rafters and it would comfort them both.  He rapped lightly on her door, then a little louder.  Convinced she had fallen asleep he gave her the privacy and rest she needed and continued to the room Denan had provided him the night before.<br>
<br>
His knocking was as distant as the footsteps on the cobblestones below her window.  Between her fingertips she played with the light she had summoned with only a thought.  A rainbow of changing colors, it ran and danced like water, all at her slightest whim.  Simple magic, she knew, but she knew there was more locked away somewhere in her mind.  Once locked, she thought.  The little brown-haired girl who was so much more had unlocked it.<br>
This magic, this power, was hers.  She knew it as she knew which images that pounded her brain were memories of the past, and which were visions of the present or future.  She knew also that this magic was infinitely more powerful than that which she now dismissed from her fingers.  She shuddered.  Infinitely more powerful, and infinitely more evil.<br>
In a thought more terrifying than all the images she had suffered when Loreana's hand touched her face, she knew that it was this power that had left her burnt and near dead on the doorstep of an old hermit's home.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gone?&quot;<br>
&quot;Aye lass, gone,&quot; Denan nodded solemnly.  He had again told the story, as he had heard it, of Brian Shahnra and the dealings that brought him to the sharp edge of an assassin's blade.<br>
&quot;That's not right.&quot;  She said searching her mind.  &quot;I don't know why, but it's not right.&quot;<br>
&quot;Well just the same, my contact at the Magistrate's said they left town two days ago after they cleared his widow.  They left no word as to their destination and there's nothing showing where they might go.&quot;<br>
&quot;Damn!&quot; she smacked the table causing Denan to start at the display.  &quot;I was close Denan,&quot; her eyes softened as she looked at him.  &quot;So close.  I can't give up now.&quot;<br>
&quot;Nay lass, no one's giving up or asking you to.&quot;  He shook his head.  &quot;It's just going to take longer and perhaps require more resources.&quot;<br>
&quot;No, Denan.&quot;  She laid a hand on his arm.  &quot;Please, don't spend more money than you already have.  I'll work for you and Megda, earn my keep and save.  I've been such a burden and your help has meant the world to me.&quot;  She straightened up in her chair. &quot;But I'll not be given so much without returning the kindness.&quot;<br>
He nodded and smiled.  &quot;Aye lass, we'll work the wages then with Megda when she returns.&quot;  He winked at his new employee.  &quot;I would wager she could use a cook of your skill and the pay would be very good.&quot;<br>
&quot;And fair,&quot; she said, wagging her finger at her friend.<br>
&quot;Aye.  Fair it'll be then,&quot; he slapped the bar in mock seriousness while grinning broadly at Greeneyes.<br>
<br>
Megda was happy to have her help and offered a good wage.  She was humming happily to herself later that eve as she went to the woman's room to tell her the news.  &quot;Oh dear, look at that poor thing,&quot; she said when she saw the plant on the windowsill.  &quot;I know I watered it.&quot;  The leaves had wilted and were starting to brown. <br>
&quot;It looked ok when I woke up.&quot; Greeneyes said.  &quot;I appreciate it though Megda, it made the room so much more cheery.&quot;<br>
Megda dismissed it with a wave, &quot;I'll talk to Sernon, he'll trade me for a healthier one dear.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://drakksnet.homestead.com/files/Ghost.gif height=50 width=60" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/20/01 9:10:43 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 15</span><hr size=1> Winter came and went.  The cold winds off the Miera and light snows that turned to mush on the city streets gave way to cool breezes and light rains.  Greeneyes enjoyed working for the two dwarves.  Her wages were both good and fair, and the occasional raise no longer elicited a protest from her.  Denan proved that other tavern and restaurant cooks earned similar wages and he reminded her of the many compliments she received for her dishes.<br>
Pippen played most nights, and though he received a few requests from travelling stage companies and performing groups to hire on with them, he declined.   The good pay from being in Denan's employ and of course Greeneyes, gave him no reason to think of moving on.  <br>
Late one eve, after Denan had closed the doors and retired for the night, Greeneyes and Pippen sat on the little stage talking.  Pippen picked up his lute and played a song she loved dearly, one he played for her as often as possible.  She sat with her back against the wall, eyes closed and smiling as he sang.  First humming, then joining him to sing along quietly, they filled the empty tavern with music.  Her voice was beautiful.  When the song was finished Pippen asked her to sing with him the next evening and she agreed.<br>
If it were possible, they gathered even more patrons to the Griffin, all coming to see and hear the new addition to Pippen's performances.<br>
Greeneyes settled into her new life and time passed quickly.  Her days and nights were filled with the things and people she had grown to love.  Afternoons, when she wasn't running errands and Pippen had his own business to conduct, she went to libraries and sages to gather information on the world around her.  The knowledge of politics, customs, social structures, magic, languages, all helped to fill the blank areas in her memories.  She discovered a hunger for this knowledge, a desire to know more and more.  In all of this though, what she truly desired eluded her.  She searched for something, anything that would trigger a critical memory.  Who she was, where she came from, what were her former goals in life?  The most important of information evaded her.  Only occasionally would something ring the proverbial bell, causing her to smile in satisfaction, but it was only a candle in the pervasive darkness inside her head.  The nightmares and visions she still suffered revealed nothing.  Her newfound magical ability, which she held in tight secret even from Pippen, gave her no insights.  Though the frustration was often overwhelming, it never once dissuaded her search.<br>
<br>
As the summer came, she found her knowledge of magic increased.  Not the information discovered through her research, but of her own magic.  Though she knew this was the key to her previous downfall and she endeavored never to use it, even in its least form, it grew.  More and more arcane lore flooded her mind.<br>
In her research she found that there were three accepted forms of magic in the known lands.  The magic Jhahela had used to heal her mind and body was Divine magic.  A magic of balance, of give and take.  A god might grant a priest or priestess the ability to heal, but there was always a cost.  Typically the cost was symbolic, a small to create a greater.  Pippen and Megda had given a small portion of their lives to heal Greeneyes.  Lor had granted Jhahela the knowledge and ability to amplify and channel that life force where it was needed.<br>
Wizardry depended entirely on the knowledge and ability of one's mind to channel, focus and form the energies the flowed through the lands themselves.  This energy gathered in lines called Skaelva that tracked across Andar.  There was no place in the Lands that was magic barren, but where the Skaelva went the energies that powered wizardry were greater.  Every place two or more Skaelva crossed formed a Nexus.  This energy-intense location allowed for easier channeling and more powerful magics to be formed.  These Nexi were, for the most part, stable and as such were greatly contested.  Wars had been fought over some of the largest and they were often the hottest topic of debate during trade talks and treaties.<br>
The last magical art, Craft, was an odd combination of the two.  God granted powers that required no direct cost, such as Divine magic, but often cost the caster himself a great deal in the way of service to the god or goddess.  Craft used the Skaelva, as Wizardry did, to power the magic channeled through the caster.  Derided by wizards for being simple-minded fools who were not willing to work for the knowledge, and by Divinics for their willingness to become pawns for trifling power, Crafters found themselves shunned in many places and often gathered together for strength and support.<br>
<br>
She didn't care to classify the magic that was becoming more and more a part of her.  She wanted nothing to do with it.  It terrified her.  She didn't know how the knowledge she gained could be used, which was a small comfort, only that it continued to grow.  Pippen would never know about it either.  It was wrong to hide it from him, but though she may have the knowledge, she would never use it.  Pippen told her that no matter who or what she was he would always love her, but how could he love what she saw in her nightmares?  The demonic images, acts that went beyond cruelty, and blood that flowed freely all to a purpose that remained safely hidden away somewhere behind her eyes.  The only ending to it all was the white-hot fires and pain of her demise.<br>
<br>
It was a warm summer night after the Griffin's closing, as they were taking one of their many evening walks, when he asked her to marry him.  It was that same summer night when she said she could not.<br>
&quot;No?&quot;  His voice was barely a whisper.<br>
&quot;Not 'no' beloved.&quot;  She held both his cheeks softly, her face so close to his he could feel her warm breath.  &quot;Yes, but not now, not yet.&quot;  She searched for words to soothe him.  &quot;I love you and want you dearly, more than life, but I don't even know myself.  What little I see scares me.&quot;  She placed a finger to his lips as he started to protest.  &quot;Yes, I know, I remember your pledge to me.&quot;<br>
My love Pippen, I need you with me but in this I only ask that you wait.&quot;  She sighed as a tear ran down her cheek.  &quot;My answer is yes, and if I am the same Greeneyes that you love and who so desperately loves you, when this is all over I am yours forever.&quot;<br>
He nodded and ran his hand through the long white streak that cut through her hair to the small of her back.  Tears wet his eyes as he whispered to her, &quot;I will wait my beloved Greeneyes, right here by your side.  And when this is over, still will I be at your side, my arms always open for you.&quot;<br>
Smiling she looked into his eyes, &quot;Nay, close thine arms my sweet bard, close them around me now so I may hear thine heart, and you mine.&quot;<br>
He grinned at her prose and brought his arms around her, the smell of her hair and the touch of her skin the only thing he desired in that moment.<br>
<br>
Much later, as they walked back to the Bald Griffin she turned playfully toward him.  &quot;I want to take you to see Dundare.&quot;<br>
&quot;The old healer who helped you?&quot; he said when the named finally jarred his memory.<br>
&quot;Yes.  I haven't seen him since I came to Miera Kiy and I promised I'd return someday.&quot;<br>
Pippen was genuinely happy.  &quot;That would be grand,&quot; he said as he kissed her merrily.  &quot;I have yet to thank him for bringing this lovely green-eyed lady into my life.&quot;<br>
She placed her hands on her hips and looked at him mischievously, &quot;And just where did you meet this woman?&quot;<br>
Not missing a beat he responded, &quot;Why, in a tavern of course, serving drinks.  I saw her through the bottom of my glass and fell instantly in love.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ooh,&quot; she slapped him on the shoulder.  &quot;You rogue you,&quot; she growled playfully.  &quot;And I bet she promised to marry you one day too.&quot;<br>
&quot;Aye,&quot; he said as they kissed again.  &quot;That she did.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I guess everybody deserves a vacation every now and again,&quot; Denan said when they told him the next morning.  His voice took a slight worried tone.  &quot;You're coming back, aren't you?&quot;<br>
Pippen and Greeneyes nodded, amused at the old dwarf's concern.  Megda reached out and gave his beard a tug.<br>
&quot;Vacation?  When do we get a vacation?&quot;<br>
He gave her a sidelong glance, &quot;This is a vacation woman.  Remember what we used to do.&quot;<br>
&quot;Aye,&quot; she gave an exaggerated yawn.  &quot;Slaying demons and wizards.  You're right, seeing Jaren and Gregash face down in a puddle of your finest is indeed all a lass could ever want for relaxation.&quot;<br>
&quot;Point taken dear mate.  Perhaps this winter we shall take time off for a bit.&quot;<br>
She whispered loudly behind her hand to the young couple, &quot;He's said that every year now for the past ten.  I just don't let him know I head for the Dragon Perch's when he travels to Heln for supplies.<br>
Denan sputtered loudly until Megda kissed him on the nose.  &quot;Gotcha,&quot; she said triumphantly.<br>
&quot;Of course you may go, as if you needed our permission,&quot; she said.  &quot;I think the customers can suffer for a few days.&quot;<br>
They both thanked the dwarves even as Denan made much ado about loosing business with his cook and entertainment leaving.  To soothe him they both teasingly agreed to wait until the morrow for their travel to Dundare's.<br>
The pair put extra effort into their entertainment that night and their audience, many whom they now were both familiar with, wished them a happy vacation and good travels.  When the good-byes were said they sat down at the bar across from Denan.<br>
&quot;Now don't you two get it in your heads to take your show on the road.&quot;  He grinned broadly through his beard.<br>
&quot;Denan, its only a couple of days.  Dundare's a sweet man and I love him dearly, but it's rather... calm there.  Not much to do from day to day but watch the animals and enjoy the sunsets.&quot;<br>
The dwarf nodded, satisfied.  &quot;What time will you be leaving on the morrow?&quot;<br>
Pippen looked at Greeneyes for confirmation, &quot;After sunrise.  It will still be cool and we'll get there early enough to visit before bed,&quot; she stated.<br>
&quot;Here then, I don't know if Dundare's taken to drink, but here's a bottle of Thymalles Spiritwine.&quot;  He brought a wrapped bottle from under the counter.  &quot;Some bread and cheeses you can get from Megda before you go.&quot;  He nodded to their offered thanks then spoke quietly.  &quot;You two be careful now, word has it the roads south have been a bit nasty of late.&quot;<br>
Pippen nodded, &quot;Aye, heard that too.  Wild animals or maybe a rogue band of humanoids.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes looked at them both, &quot;And when were you going to tell me this?&quot;<br>
Denan looked at her sincerely, &quot;Why lass, I just did.&quot;<br>
Pippen smirked behind his hand as she slapped his arm.  &quot;Don't worry love, we'll be fine,&quot; he reassured her.   &quot;It's only half a day's walk as you said, and the way is well traveled by the guard.&quot;  He shrugged it off.  &quot;I'll bring my sword.&quot;  Denan raised his eyebrows and rolled his eyes.  &quot;What?  I can use a sword.&quot; He looked from the dwarf to Greeneyes.  &quot;Really.&quot;<br>
Denan nodded, picked up his rag and started cleaning his mug.  &quot;Of course you can lad.&quot;<br>
&quot;What?&quot; he asked again, answered only by a swift kiss to his lips.  &quot;I can,&quot; he mumbled around her grinning mouth.<br>
&quot;I believe you,&quot; she mumbled back.  &quot;Now hush up and kiss me.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://drakksnet.homestead.com/files/Ghost.gif height=50 width=60" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/20/01 9:12:11 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 16</span><hr size=1> They were on the road by eighth band the next morning.  Pippen in loose, doeskin breeches, a light weight shirt of blue cotton and traveling cape.  His blond hair topped by a lopsided, wide-brimmed hat of blue with a yellow band and feather.  Beneath the billowing gray cape a long saber in a fancy scabbard bounced off his right hip.  Slung across his shoulder a pack with food from Megda's kitchen, Denan's gift of wine, an extra set of clothes and a blanket.  Other items, most for the care of his instrument, were carefully wrapped and placed in the top.  The lute itself was tied outside the pack in its own drybag.<br>
Greeneyes had her old traveling clothes on.  She packed some of the food, her own blanket, the dresses Dundare had given her and one Pippen had bought her.  She didn't know what the dresses meant to Dundare, but she thought he would like to see her wear them again.  She also wore the blade he had given her, more for its comforting weight than any use she might have for it.  She didn't know if she had some hidden skill, but she wasn't eager to find out.<br>
The figurine Dundare had given her also lay within the pack, lovingly wrapped and protected.  Pippen had declared it a good omen, so much did the woman and child resemble his love and Loreana.  Greeneyes was not as certain as he about how good an omen it was, but she let her bard keep his theories. <br>
<br>
Passing the city gates, she thought about the two guards she had first met on the way to Miera Kiy.  She couldn't remember their names at the moment but their kindness had always been remembered.<br>
The roadway south was packed as ever.  Merchants, adventurers, and families moved through the gates, some looking for a new life, some escaping an old one and others just passing through, a good sale or warm bed their only goal.  Greeneyes thought of Loreana and Merrie Shahnra, wondering if they had passed this way.  Then she remembered.<br>
&quot;I saw it.  They came this way.&quot;  She thought of the vision she had upon passing the huge rock with the city's name engraved on it.<br>
&quot;Who came this way?&quot;  Pippen asked.<br>
&quot;Loreana and her mom.&quot;<br>
&quot;They did?&quot;  He was unsure of how to react to her revelation.<br>
&quot;I was up there,&quot; she pointed up the road where it climbed into the hills.  &quot;I saw it through her eyes, she was sad.  They were leaving their home.  I didn't know what it meant then, as if that was anything new,&quot; she ended ruefully.<br>
&quot;But still no idea where they went?&quot;  He dodged a hole in the road and had to go around a wagon heading past them.  &quot;The road leads south and east, they could have taken either way.&quot;<br>
She let out an exasperated sigh, &quot;I know, I mean I don't know.&quot;  She waited until he joined her again.  &quot;We'll just have to wait and see if it comes to me.&quot;<br>
Past merchants and their overloaded wagons they walked until a band later they topped the rise where the rock announcing Miera Kiy's presence lay.  A mile past that they came upon the intersection leading south and east.  Southward lay their goal, old Dundare's home and eventually Heln.  Eastward, a hundred miles or so the road split northeast to the city of Triark and southeast to Rimdale city.  Both cities lay outside Torain but the guards patrolled up to the border hitting all the little towns and villages between.<br>
<br>
Pippen turned expectantly to Greeneyes who was staring eastward.  &quot;Well?&quot;<br>
&quot;Nothing.&quot;  She crossed her arms and sighed.  &quot;It would figure.  The one time I want a vision or whatever, it doesn't come.&quot;  Without ceremony she turned and continues walking south.  Pippen stood there for a second, shrugged and hurried to catch her.<br>
Around midday they stopped to complaining bellies and found a felled log they could sit on.  Washing down a fat slice of bread with water from his flask, he then passed it to her.  &quot;So did you ever wonder how you came to lie so close to Dundare's home?&quot;<br>
She shook her head and wiped her mouth with her cloak.  &quot;No.  It was strange, yes, but he was so kind and I was so grateful for him saving my life it never occurred to me.&quot;<br>
She saw the quizzical look on his face.  &quot;Now don't you go thinking he's got something to do with all this.  He saved my life and never asked for anything in return but that I visit him again.&quot;  She took a bite of cheese and saw Pippen was not convinced.  &quot;He even gave me clothes, a dagger and one of his precious carvings.&quot;<br>
&quot;But the clothes were conveniently woman's clothes weren't they?&quot;<br>
&quot;From a wife who passed on perhaps,&quot; she countered, slightly annoyed.<br>
&quot;And your magical dagger that responded to your touch?&quot;<br>
&quot;It means nothing.  Magic is fey and temperamental, it could have done that for a million reasons,&quot; she was becoming less convinced in her argument.<br>
&quot;And the figurine?  You can't deny the resemblance between the two stone women and you and -&quot;<br>
&quot;Coincidence, all of it.&quot;  The look in her eyes took Pippen aback.<br>
&quot;My love, I'm not saying any of this was caused by him, just -&quot; he took her hands in his.  &quot;Maybe he knows more than he's letting on.&quot;<br>
She sat there, silently staring at the ground as his words sank in.<br>
<br>
Pippen suddenly regretted the entire conversation.  &quot;Love, I'm sorry.&quot;  He knelt before her with his hands on her knees.  &quot;I never should have said it.  I know how much he means to you.&quot;  He bowed his head when she didn't respond. &quot;I should have just kept my godsdamned mouth shut.&quot;<br>
She looked at him then and smiled, &quot;No my beloved Pippen, you're right.&quot; He raised his head to look back at her.  &quot;At least in that I never asked him more.  He might have seen something or heard something and thought perhaps I was too fragile at first to hear it.&quot;  She shook her head.  &quot;I believe he was entirely honorable, but I can't go about blindly.  Even he said as much.  So I'll ask him.&quot;  She looked at Pippen and, rising from the log, kissed him on the head.  &quot;But when and where I choose, and in private.  He deserves that.&quot;<br>
Pippen nodded quickly as they packed up the blanket and remnants of the meal.  Few words passed between them until they came to the trail that led to the old healer's home.<br>
&quot;This way?&quot;  Pippen asked, unsure that the small path through the brush and up the hill qualified as 'the way'.  She assured him it was and grabbed his hand as she went up.<br>
Soon enough the trail turned into a small road Pippen thought qualified easily enough for the status of 'goat path'.  He said as much and received an amused giggle from Greeneyes.  Hearing that cleared the bard's gloomy mood and he began to admire the woods around him.  Large oaks, steelwoods, and ash fought for space with the scruffy brush and high weeds surrounding the path.  Though small, the path looked fairly well traveled with many horse hoof marks going in both directions.<br>
<br>
Noticing the trail ended at an old fallen tree, he started around it through a dry, shallow riverbed that ducked underneath the tree's trunk.  He noticed she hadn't followed when he got to the bottom.<br>
&quot;Are you sure this is the way?&quot; he called up to her.  He didn't hear her voiced observation laced with growing suspicion and fear.<br>
&quot;This tree still lives.  Something's not - PIPPEN!&quot;<br>
Even as she screamed his name she knew it was too late.  The brush and rocks around the bard exploded into motion.  Pippen turned toward the sound, his hand going for the saber at his belt.  Three huge forms rose over him, one already bringing a great maul down to strike its prey.<br>
Time slowed for her again as she saw in agonizing, crystal detail the crude hammer striking Pippen's shoulder.  Bone, muscle and skin gave way to oak powered by five hundred pounds of pure hate.  The wielder, a grotesque creature of gray skin and matted brown hair that covered its leathery hide in patches.  Strapped to strategic locations on its back and head were crude but effective attempts at camouflage.  Brush, weeds and grass fell from the rope wrappings as the beast raised its mallet for another swing.  Of the two others, one was focused on Pippen, a drooling smile across its face as it no doubt awaited its turn at their victim.  The third was already climbing the gully towards her, shaking a large club and growling, when long buried instinct and training took action.<br>
Without thinking, without even realizing what she was doing, she raised her right hand and began drawing in the air.<br>
In the haze of his rapidly slipping consciousness, Pippen saw without comprehension the woman he knew as Greeneyes draw a sigil of power in the air before her.<br>
Three dire words completed the spell.  Three words she herself could not understand yet spoke as if they were her own language.  Three words that, when the last breath of the last one escaped her lips, caused a rush of power through her body both exhilarating and horrifying.  Power that rippled the air like heat waves on a summer street.  Power that surged from her to the Gruagan that was killing the man she loved.<br>
The force that struck the ogre withered its skin and muscle to the bone, then ripped it to shreds and blew it off its skeleton.  For the span of a heartbeat it stood there, maul raised in grotesque imitation of life before collapsing at Pippen's feet.<br>
The second ogre fared the same, its skeleton blown clean and thrown back a dozen feet to lie almost peacefully in the riverbed.<br>
The third one though, the one that meant to try its luck with the helpless maiden...  Greeneyes looked on in horror, bile rising in her throat.  The creature was caught by only the edge of her wrathful casting.  It knelt a dozen feet away from her on the edge of the riverbed, a strangely forlorn cry echoing from its throat.  One leg trailed behind it, tattered flesh hanging like rags from bare bone.  The arm that carried the club hung loosely at its side, bone and dried muscle from its biceps to the middle of its forearm where its elbow had been caught by the very edge of the spell's effect.  Its other arm held up a fist that was shaking in pain as the Gruagan let out a final, rasping breath and fell face forward toward her.<br>
Her stomach emptied itself when she saw the back of the creature's skull, ribcage and spine revealed, the spell barely but effectively catching the creature halfway up the gully.<br>
The world spun around her as she fell to her knees screaming and screaming, terrifying images filled her brain as the image of the ravaged ogre filled her vision.  She found herself scrambling down the gully's shallow slope toward a grievously injured Pippen.<br>
Choking back sobs she looked him over.  Thank the gods he was alive, but barely so.  She saw bone protruding from a half dozen places across his shoulder and chest.  Skin lay torn and purple and blood oozed from everywhere.<br>
&quot;Green...&quot; he whispered, unable to finish her name.<br>
&quot;Shh, my love,&quot; &quot; Tears ran down her face.  She couldn't bear the pain etched on his face.  &quot;Don't speak, I'll get you to Dundare.&quot;<br>
&quot;Heh,&quot; he coughed weakly, blood foaming lightly around his mouth.  &quot;The damsel saving the knight,&quot; he slurred, more blood dripping from his lips.  She was going to loose him.  &quot;Where's my lute?&quot; he asked before closing his eyes.<br>
&quot;NOOO!&quot; she screamed, voice raised to the heavens to whatever gods listened.  Nowhere in her mind swimming amongst the words and symbols lay magic that would heal her bard.  Only death and evil swirled through her brain.<br>
No, there was more.  Mundane magic, like the lights she played with in her room at the Griffin.  She lay her beloved down gently, relieved to still hear his breath, ever so faintly sighing across his lips.  Standing close to him she chanted a phrase not nearly so dire as the one that stripped flesh from bone.  Moving her hands in an arcane pattern before her, the wind picked up and swirled around her feet.<br>
A breeze blew leaves, brush and grasses around the two in a slow whirlwind.  As the wind increased it slowly lifted them off the ground.  In a giant bubble of blowing debris they started moving up the ravine on the far side of the fallen tree and down the path.  Greeneyes willed her invisible coach as fast as she could toward Dundare's home, praying that she was not already too late.  The wind carried them rapidly toward her destination leaving a wake of leaves and dust to fall lazily in its passing.<br>
Following behind, almost as rapidly, a path of grass and brush withered and died leaving a brown streak tearing across green and fertile forest. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://drakksnet.homestead.com/files/Ghost.gif height=50 width=60" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/20/01 9:13:15 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 17</span><hr size=1> An eternity passed before she broke through into the clearing surrounding Dundare's home.  Her precious cargo only inches above the ground, a sudden weariness overtook her and the winds died a hundred paces from the little house.<br>
&quot;Dundare!&quot; she cried hoarsely as she collapsed to her knees near Pippen.  &quot;Dundare!&quot; she yelled louder.  &quot;Oh gods be there.&quot;<br>
&quot;Who's that?&quot; a voice called from the small building's doorway.  It opened to reveal Dundare peering out, eyes shaded against the afternoon sun.<br>
&quot;Dundare, help!&quot;  She lifted Pippen's head from the ground and lay it on her knees.  His face had grown ashen and she couldn't hear his breath.<br>
&quot;Child?&quot;  He hurried from the doorway.  &quot;Is that you?  By T'ro'adon what's happened?&quot;<br>
&quot;Help him, please,&quot; was all she could say, tears streaming down her face as her bloody hands stroked the young man's hair.<br>
&quot;Of course, of course child.  Here, let me have him.&quot;  He separated the two and lifted the bard easily, minding the grievous injuries her charge had sustained.<br>
With the last bit of her energy she stumbled to the doorway to push the door fully open.  Dundare turned towards the home, raising an eyebrow at the path of dead growth leading back in the direction the two must have come from.<br>
Passing Greeneyes in the doorway, he took the bard to the same bed she had laid.  The bard didn't stir as Dundare raced to find the proper materials he would need to care for the wounds.  Greeneyes followed him in and peered at her love through half-closed eyelids.  Her body was giving in to the demands she had most recently made of it.<br>
&quot;Dundare, will he -&quot;<br>
He reached her side and placed a hand gently on her head.  &quot;Yes child, he will live.  Now, you must sleep.&quot;  She sighed quietly as he caught her in his arms and carried her to his hammock.  &quot;This will do for now.  You must heal too.&quot;  Leaving her curled up in the rope hammock he turned his attention back to his patient.  &quot;And leave old Dundare to his work.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Triark.&quot;  She spoke the name she had heard over and over in her dream.  They were headed in the direction of Triark, a city across the border between Torain and Thymallesra.<br>
Opening her eyes she turned and fondly watched Dundare clucking over Pippen like a mother hen.  She imagined the scene must have been very similar when he had found her lying in the grass not far from here.  The memory of the three ogres rose like hideous specters from their grave.  The one, its hand stretched out in pain, suddenly changed to Pippen, his body ravaged by her death spell.<br>
Violently blinking the image away and breathing rapid, shallow breaths she rose from the hammock.  She removed her boots and cloak and padded in bare feet to the doorway.<br>
The loving care he gave his patient, her love, made her smile.  If he saw her he made no indication of it.  Pulling long strips of cloth from a strange broth that looked like oatmeal and smelled like dandelions he laid them carefully across the man's shoulder and chest.  She couldn't see Pippen's face yet knew he slept easily despite the healer's ministrations. <br>
She started when, without looking up, he said over his shoulder, &quot;Child, please bring me the pot off the stove.&quot;  She grinned and retrieved the warm pot half filled with the pale white concoction.  Placing it next to the other medicinal stew, she pulled up one of his old chairs and sat to watch the healer's work.<br>
&quot;He's lucky you were able to get him here.  I feared it was too late when I saw him.&quot;<br>
She replied kindly, &quot;It was too late.&quot;  There was no challenge in her voice, only love.  &quot;He lay dead at my feet when I brought him here, didn't he?&quot;<br>
He paused long enough to give her his 'teacher' look, &quot;Did he?&quot; before turning back to his work.<br>
&quot;He did.  His lungs were filling with blood before I could even reach him.&quot;  She paused as a tear ran down her cheek.  &quot;I killed him as sure as the maul the Gruagan brought down on him.&quot;<br>
His teacher look told her she was failing.<br>
&quot;Maybe you'd better explain Child.&quot; His tone left no room for argument.<br>
<br>
She told him of her continuing nightmares.  He nodded when she spoke of seeing the child, her family and the visions.  When he was done with Pippen, they went outside while she told him of the murder and her meeting with the widow and Loreana.<br>
They sat on a bench Dundare had set up against the house.  It provided a wondrous view of the forest and darkening sky above.  She poured Dundare and herself a glass of the Denan's wine.<br>
&quot;There is more, Child?&quot; he prompted.<br>
She nodded.  &quot;Her touch.  So many visions.  Horrors I couldn't bear, couldn't understand.&quot;  She paused as images flooded her mind again.  &quot;Dundare, I was somebody absolutely, utterly evil.&quot;  She looked at him for understanding.<br>
&quot;That's not who you are now though.  I don't think young Pippen there, or your other friends would agree with your estimation of yourself.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh Dundare,&quot; she rose and paced back and forth as she grew more agitated.  &quot;If you only saw,&quot; she sputtered amidst new tears.  &quot;I didn't think, I didn't even know what I was doing.  It just came out.&quot;  She paced faster, as her hands formed her words.  &quot;This magic, this evil.... I tore their flesh from their bones, Dundare!&quot;  She turned in circles, hands moving violently.  &quot;Look at me Dundare!&quot;  She becoming more frantic, her words rose to almost a scream causing the old healer to rise from his seat.  &quot;Who am I Dundare!&quot;  The wind began to pick up.  Dundare felt the hairs on the back of his neck rise as her confusion and anger began manifesting itself in her craft.  &quot;What am I dear old healer that I command this power?&quot;  She rose into the air, wind whipping her hair about her face and shoulders.  &quot;Dundare.&quot;  Her voice fell to a plea.  &quot;Dundare, help me.  I don't want this.&quot;  The grass under her began to wither.   Dundare edged calmly forward until he stood only a yard before her.  &quot;I don't want this to be who I am again.&quot;  Her head shook in denial as she closed her eyes against the tears.  &quot;I don't.&quot;<br>
&quot;Then come down.&quot;<br>
&quot;What?&quot;  She heard him, his quietly spoken words echoed like thunder in her ears.<br>
&quot;Come down.&quot;  The teacher looked at his student expectantly.<br>
Her arms dropped to her sides as she looked around in slowly dawning shock.<br>
&quot;Come down, Child.&quot;  He held his hand out to her.<br>
The wind stilled as she drifted down.  When her feet touched the ground she took two steps and fell into his embrace.  &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br>
&quot;Just an old man, Child.  An old healer who's seen too much pain in this world.&quot;  He guided her into his home and sat her in his chair.  Wrapping a blanket around her he then went into his small kitchen to make tea.<br>
<br>
After refilling her cup with the brew that smelled of cinnamon, he sat across from her.  She looked at him.  &quot;I don't understand.&quot;<br>
He smiled fondly at her.  &quot;Who you were before,&quot; she shivered and brought the cup to her lips. &quot;Is not who you are now.&quot;  Her look was sadly skeptical.  &quot;The power you've regained was hers, the memories as well, but,&quot; he leaned forward.  &quot;The remorse, the fear, the horror at the magic you cast, even in defense of your beloved bard and yourself,&quot; he shook his head.  &quot;I think this woman you describe would not feel these emotions.&quot;<br>
&quot;Then who am I?&quot;  She still didn't comprehend.<br>
&quot;There are two answers to your question, Child.  You were this woman in body and mind, but something happened.&quot;  He formed his words carefully.  &quot;Who you are now fights against this person you were before.  When I told you to come down, you did.  You can control this magic, you can control this woman you were.<br>
&quot;All things happen for a reason.  This child, Loreana Shahnra, your daughter?&quot;<br>
&quot;Pippen believes so.  The father, Brian, recognized me I think.&quot;<br>
&quot;What do you believe?&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't know, daughter, sister.&quot;  She shook her head in frustration.  &quot;Perhaps the resemblance is coincidence.&quot;  She sighed.  &quot;I haven't exactly cornered the market on green eyes and brown hair.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ah but the link between you is undeniable.&quot;<br>
Nodding, she sipped her tea slowly.<br>
&quot;You said they left Miera Kiy after the father's murder?&quot;  He continued as she nodded.  &quot;They went South from the city, but to where after you don't know?&quot;<br>
&quot;I know now.  I dreamed it while I slept in your hammock.<br>
&quot;Which way, Child?&quot;<br>
&quot;East, then North on the road to Triark, but not all the way.&quot;  Downing the last of her drink she shook her head.  &quot;Where, exactly, I don't know, but it's a start.&quot;<br>
&quot;So you intend on making off again?&quot;  Dundare knew the answer before she nodded.<br>
&quot;I have to, for the same reason I left you more than a year ago I leave now.&quot;  She looked at the bard.  &quot;I know you'll care for him and I hope,&quot; she moved over to where Pippen slept.  &quot;I hope you'll understand my love.  I can't loose you before I find myself.&quot;  She looked up at Dundare who stood in the doorway.  &quot;I want to write him a letter.  I've got to make him understand.&quot;  Placing a hand on one of his as it lay on his chest, she kissed Pippen gently.  &quot;Megda and Denan too.  The rest of my new family.&quot;  She smiled at the old healer.  &quot;But I have to go.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://drakksnet.homestead.com/files/Ghost.gif height=50 width=60" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/20/01 9:14:47 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 18</span><hr size=1> &quot;Child, you said you didn't want to be who you once were.  Be warned, the magic you wield defined who you were.  Every time you use it, you risk becoming this woman.&quot;  He placed a hand on her shoulder and gently squeezed.  &quot;Remember my words, Child.  Control.  Think before you act.  The power comes naturally to you.  You have to fight this instinct to keep who you are now.&quot;<br>
She nodded solemnly and sighed, &quot;I will.&quot;  She smiled at her old friend, the man she loved like the father she must have once had.  &quot;Now, I have some very long letters to write.&quot;<br>
<br>
The next morning she gave the letters to Dundare, extracting the promise to ensure they got to Megda and Denan quickly.  Dundare informed her it would be a seven-day or so before Pippen would wake, and that he would explain what happened and give the bard the letter as soon as possible.<br>
The sun had risen as she packed for the journey.  It would be several days travel if she went as far as Triark, which she didn't expect to do, but planned for anyway.<br>
&quot;When you reach Kimbleton wait for the Kaskell Trader's wagon train to come in,&quot; Dundare told her as he dug through the chest beneath the bed.  &quot;For a fee they will take on as many passengers as can fit in their wagons.  They also hire on mercenaries and adventurers.&quot;  He wagged his finger, &quot;They most likely only hire the guilded but no reason to tempt the use of your magic.&quot;  She nodded as he pulled various items from the chest.<br>
&quot;Oh Dundare, no.&quot;  He silenced her with a stern gaze.<br>
&quot;No argument Child.  I'm not sending you out to find your fortune this time.&quot;  He shook his head, &quot;Your journey is longer and your life could be in peril.&quot;  He saw a skeptical look cross her face.  &quot;There is always someone more powerful than you.  That is the first thing to remember.&quot;  He turned to her, arms folded across his chest.  &quot;And that someone has already killed you once.  I don't imagine they will be pleased to find you still breathing.&quot;<br>
She bowed her head, the reminder of her near death having the effect the old healer desired.  &quot;Your hair and your magic mark you.  The hair has an easy, if smelly, solution.&quot;  She cocked a questioning grin at him.  &quot;Your magic,&quot; he tilted his head toward the doorway, &quot;leaves a mark most easily identified and tracked.  Magic such as this is indiscriminate.  You saw that even when you control the wind you leave death in your wake.&quot;  She nodded, her eyes wet with sorrow.  &quot;And no more tears child.&quot;  He cupped her chin in one hand.  &quot;The time for that is done, for now at least.  Find the strength that is yours, not this witch's.&quot;<br>
He picked up a small bundle from the chest.  &quot;Remember when I said to come back if you were ever in need.&quot;  He unrolled the bundle revealing a small jewelry box.<br>
&quot;Magic,&quot; she said, giving Dundare an amazed look.  &quot;I can feel it.&quot;<br>
He raised an eyebrow and opened the box.  &quot;This,&quot; he held up a silver ring laced with fine gold filigree in the shape of runes and symbols, &quot;will help conceal you from magics that may search for you.&quot;  He placed it on one of her fingers.  She felt it contract around her digit to fit snugly.  &quot;You power should remain hidden though, I fear, not if you use it.&quot;<br>
&quot;I feel so helpless,&quot; she gazed out the window.  &quot;Power I dare not use, and both hunter and hunted for what I still don't know.&quot;<br>
&quot;Keep your eyes open.  If you act as any other traveler, you should do fine.  Paranoia will only drive you insane, and open fear will make you obvious mark for even the pettiest of cutpurses.&quot;<br>
<br>
The traveler departed the next morning.  Sitting with Pippen through the sunrise, she then gathered her possessions and hugged Dundare goodbye.  She wore the traveling clothes she was accustomed to now, with her hood thrown back revealing plain, brown hair braided tightly back.  Her pack was loaded with her spare clothes, blanket, food, and cooking utensils.  The figurine she prized so greatly was wrapped and tucked into a pocket in her cloak and the dagger, as always, at her waist.  <br>
The summer sun was hot, but the shade of the trees and breeze helped cool her walk back to the main road.  She forced herself to walk upon the ground killed by her craft.  Grass, shrubs, and saplings lay brown and wilted on her trail.  Without a tear she resolutely promised herself that this defiling of life would not happen at her hands again.<br>
Looking upon the corpses of the three gruagan, untouched by predators, she wondered if she could keep both the promise, and her life, through this ordeal.<br>
<br>
Traffic was light on the road from Heln to Miera Kiy and she reached the eastern intersection after passing only a single, southbound wagon carrying a load of grain.  The fair weather had left the road in good shape and she traveled easily.  Wide, high and hard-packed road allowed even heavily laden wagons to pass each other without threat of throwing a wheel in a rut along the road.  By midday she lost count of the wagons that passed in both directions and travelers headed west on foot.<br>
The Torainian Tradesway Guard made regular trips in both directions, hailing many travelers as they passed.  Many times she saw groups of people and wagons gathered off to the side of the road to rest and trade.  Greeneyes found such a group of wagons and, more for safety than camaraderie, stopped to rest and eat the midday meal.  Sitting apart from the main group she watched children play and adults talk or haggle as she munched on venison jerky and trail bread.  Washing it down with water, she quietly gathered her belongings and continued down the road.<br>
<br>
She didn't know what she was looking for.  The odds of finding Loreana or her mother were greater than she cared to think about.  The only hope lay in her visions, which was little hope at all, she wagered.<br>
By mid-afternoon she took a chance at an offered ride in the wagon of a family heading a few towns eastward.  She found she didn't mind their talk of the relatives they were visiting or mundane family matters.  When asked about her destination, she fabricated an easy enough tale of visiting a grandfather in Kimbleton.  No, she hadn't been there since she was a child, but she was looking forward to his homemade apple pie.<br>
This was good enough for them as the conversations went on with Greeneyes laughing and nodding at all the right times.  A little while after sunset they were rolling into Brambleton fully two days ahead of where she would have been if she had walked.  The family offered her a place to sleep before she continued on.  Thanking them, she said no, there were things yet for her to do that eve.  In truth she was sorely tempted.  They were friendly and quite harmless.  This was why she thought it best to leave their lives as quickly as possible.  No more innocent people would be affected by her prolonged presence.<br>
Finding one of the small town's two inns was easy as they sat opposite each other on the main road.  Outside one, a man stood practically begging the occasional passerby for business.  She quickly chose the other inn, paid the innkeep five coppers and retired for the night.<br>
<br>
The eyes smiled at her.  They were deep, bottomless and black.  She was falling, no, being pulled into their inky depths.  Pulling her in while they laughed in silent mirth at her terror.<br>
<br>
The smell of fresh bread woke her early that morning.  The sun had not yet peeked over the trees when she rose and dressed for her journey.  Coming down the stairs she gave into temptation and had a light meal of pan-toasted bread, butter and milk.  Satisfied, she smiled at the innkeep's hearty 'Good morn', retrieved her pack and stepped into the morning sun.<br>
Kimbleton was the next town, but was another two day's walk, which prompted her to look for another ride.  She found one easily enough, a man and his family in an open coach drawn by an old black mare.  After only a few miles the sullen man, his quiet wife and two dark-eyed children prompted her to excuse herself because she suddenly remembered leaving something back in Brambleton.  The man shrugged his shoulders and mumbled something as he drew up on the reigns.  Scrambling out quickly she gave hurried thanks and started walking in the other direction.  She swore she could feel eyes on the back of her head as she walked, and was thankful when the carriage finally turned a bend in the road to pass out of sight.<br>
'Damn silly,' she said to herself as she turned around and continued on to Kimbleton.<br>
A short ride provided by a dwarven merchant cut several hours off her journey, but cost her a few more silver than she would have liked.  She had plenty of coin, thanks to the money she saved while working for Denan, but with no idea as to how long she would have to rely on her savings it was best to be as frugal as possible.<br>
By nightfall she was looking for a good place, well off the beaten road, to lay her bedroll.  Finding a small outcropping of rocks she climbed up amongst them and found a patch of dirt in a recess.  Eating a small portion of her rations, she laid out her bedroll and drifted into sleep.<br>
The scrambling sound caused her to wake and slowly reach the dagger at her side.  Moving her head slowly she sighted the creature causing the offending noise.<br>
A raccoon was calmly munching on one of her pieces of travel bread, eyeing her suspiciously.  She was about to jump up and yell 'boo' when another noise reached her ears.  The raccoon perked up as well and twisted its head to look over its shoulder.<br>
The dim moonlight revealed two figures moving through the brush toward the road.  Unfortunately this would also bring them upon her.  They were speaking in odd clicks and low tones mixed with crude Andarian.  The raccoon, deciding its midnight snack was over, ran down the rock in the opposite direction.  Thankfully it did this without a sound but the two humanoids were too close for her to risk the same escape.<br>
The first one started hefting itself up onto the rocks in an apparent search for a vantage-point.  Greeneyes heart beat faster as she heard the creature's nails scraping on the rocks and its heavy breathing as it pulled itself up.<br>
The fire behind her eyes began to well up again as her power rose to her defense.  Her breathing grew rapid as she clenched her fists and willed her magic down.  She knew it, a simple spell to conceal herself from the searching eyes of the creature.<br>
'No!' she thought.  Even this simple magic drew from the same source and shared its corruption.  She balled her fists and took even, quiet breaths.  Her nails dug into her palms when she heard, she felt, the creature standing on the rock over her.  Only four feet above where she lay the manlike creature stood to survey ahead.  If it looked down it would see her backpack the raccoon left lying open near her.  She dare not pull it toward her for the sound it would make or the motion, right at the edge of its vision, which might attract its attention.  Shaking more from the effort to control her craft than fear, she otherwise held as still as possible.  Forcing herself to take shallow, silent breaths she felt her control slipping.  When the creature jumped from its perch and landed five feet on the other side of where she lay, she almost screamed.  The magic was on her fingertips and the words on her tongue when the humanoid continued down the rock, favoring the easier descent provided on the side where she camped.  Yelling for its companion, it reached the ground and she saw the two rejoin as they continued on toward the road.<br>
Only when the darkness swallowed them did she feel safe enough to match her breath with her heartbeat.  Hyperventilating, she pushed the magic back down, then sat with her knees drawn up against her chest, eyes staring wide into the night.  It was a long time before she fell into an uneasy, dream-filled sleep.  Images of life and death and fire dancing for supremacy behind her eyelids. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://drakksnet.homestead.com/files/Ghost.gif height=50 width=60" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/20/01 9:16:03 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 19</span><hr size=1> He reached out with his senses into the darkness.  Alone.<br>
&quot;Lume.&quot;<br>
The room illuminates softly, driving back the shadows.  Taking a breath, he drew in the stale air deeply like a swimmer breaking the surface.  His eyes opened, roaming over the intricately carved stone ceiling of the sleeping chamber.  Writhing figures of the dead and dying captured forever in gray stone bring a smile to his face.<br>
Cruzaz Ror rolled over on his side and pushed into a seating position.  Stretching languorously he took another deep breath and reached out with his senses again.  The wards lay undisturbed, ensuring the priest of Dierguroth also remained at peace.<br>
What peace in failure, he wondered.  Failed in his master's mission and the God of the Void did not take failure well.  So he had lain, over ten years if the dweomers placed upon his sanctuary told true.  Ten years since a handful of lowly followers of the stone god had destroyed years of preparation.  Destroyed his chance at true power.<br>
No, he thought.  Not destroyed, merely set back.  It wasn't until after the priests of T'ro'adon interrupted his ceremony and eradicated many of his undead servants, suffering grievous losses themselves, he was made to realize his error.<br>
Ror thought he had prepared the way for the Avatar.  Bringing the living symbol of Dierguroth's might and glory into this world was his life's work.  However he had misunderstood the Prophecy and therefore was instrumental in his own failure.  He would not fail again.  Gods, even Dierguroth, were patient beings, but failure often carried a price the priest did not wish to contemplate for long.<br>
The High Priest rubbed his pale, bald head then set his slippered feet on the floor.  Walking to the stone that sealed the room like a tomb he examined it carefully.  Brushing his crimson and purple robes he realized what an insignificant gesture it was.  Though he had lay in state for over a decade, no dust accumulated.  Nothing had made it past his magic seals, not even air, he thought as his nose wrinkled in distaste now at the air he had just deeply breathed.  Waving a hand dismissively, he banished the wards emplaced on the door and spoke another word of arcane magic.<br>
The door slid open slowly, the faint sound of grating stone echoed through the chamber as two tons of granite parted to reveal an antechamber.  Though of the same design and materials as Ror's chamber, it stood in stark contrast to the sanctuary.  Vines, moss and other wild growth had completely overrun the room and passage beyond.  The stagnant smell of foul water caused Ror to huff in disgust, thinking the stale air he just tasted was far preferable.  The air stank of living things fighting each other for meaningless existence.  This wouldn't last long.  Reclaiming his temple was one of the first tasks, menial as it might seem, on a long list of tasks ahead.<br>
The temple was quiet, the sibilant whispers and cries of his undead silenced long ago.  As his footsteps carried him past overgrown reliefs and fallen columns, he was satisfied that at least the dwarven priests had not come back to finish the job.  His creatures had seen to that.  Of the six minions of T'ro'adon who had come to disrupt his work, only one had escaped.<br>
Ah, that one, how close he had come to ending his pitiful life.  If he had not heeded the vision he suffered after his failure, Cruzaz Ror did not doubt that he would not be breathing any air, stale or fetid.  No, that priest of stone had his own purpose to serve soon enough.<br>
Ror smiled humorously.  When the time comes, he thought, for now he had some cleaning to do.<br>
<br>
Sufficient for now, he thought as he inspected his work.  The growth had been pushed back well beyond the physical bounds of the temple into the marshes beyond.  Creepers, grasses and weeds withered and died at his gesture.  Water dried up leaving patches of green algae and marsh weed to also shrivel and dry.  Dark words turned the dead growth to fine powder that blew away on an arcane breeze.  The destruction that was wrought by both the servants of T'ro'adon and the marsh would have to come later.  Workers must be 'recruited' to accomplish the task of rebuilding the temple itself.  The ceremonial chamber would require his personal guidance.  The round, domed ceiling room had suffered the greatest destruction.  Pillars had been blown outward when the gate was forced closed.  He had felt a presence beyond the opening just before.  Not the Avatar he knew now, but most likely another of his dark servants.  No matter, the Circlet of Mists had been safely transported long before the domed structure finally fell under its own weight.<br>
Stepping into one of the chambers leading to the domed room, he waved a hand over an ebon brazier.  Fire leaped to the ceiling, then diminished but continued to burn hotly with no fuel but the magic channeled through it.  Flames licked upward in blue and white tongues at eye level as Ror pulled back one long sleeve on his left arm.  Extracting a thin, razor-sharp knife from his belt he drew a deep line in his forearm from wrist to elbow.  Beads of sweat ran down his face as he thrust his arm into the flames.  The fire crackled and his flesh seared as blood coursed down his arm and into the brazier.  When the flames dimmed and turned a deep red, satisfied in his sacrifice, he withdrew his arm.  Sliding his robe back over flesh that held no sign of the abuse it had just suffered, Ror peered deeply into the flames.<br>
From nexus to nexus his vision flew, retracing the path on which he sent the Circlet of Mists ten years before.  He nodded in satisfaction.  The artifact lay where he had sent it, at a nexus deep in the rock of the Coldrake Mountains more than a thousand mile northeast.  It had taken the last of his power to send it there.  Fatigued from the disrupted summoning and the subsequent chase of the last members of his enemy's group, his remaining energies had sent the Circlet away.  Sent it along the crisscrossing lines of magical energy that lay beneath the lands to a nexus far out of reach of those that would use or destroy it.  Unfortunately it would take as much power, if not more to bring it back.<br>
Again something that would have to wait.  Reaching out with his sight a second time, he sought another target.<br>
&quot;Master, awake at last I see,&quot; a voice spoke from the flames as a face came into view.<br>
&quot;Yes Guptras my loyal servant.  How goes our plans?&quot;<br>
&quot;According to our Lord's wishes.  The Prophecy marches slowly to fruition.  Your accursed enemy sits at his god's side, reminded of his destiny before being taken by the hand of another.&quot;<br>
&quot;He was not to die, Guptras!&quot; Ror's voice did not rise, but his anger was more than evident.  &quot;Not until -&quot;<br>
&quot;He has spawned, Master.  More than ten summers ago.  His time was over, in accordance with the Dark Lord's wishes.&quot;  Ror glared into his servant's glittering black eyes and swore he saw amusement.<br>
The priest finally nodded, his lips a thin line that was almost a smile.  &quot;Thus begins the Chosen One's journey.&quot;<br>
Guptras Den also smiled as darkness roiled in his eyes.  &quot;It shall be done as the Prophecy of the Avatar has told.&quot;<br>
Cruzaz darkly smiled as he began to wave the communication closed.<br>
&quot;Master,&quot; Guptras interrupted.<br>
Ror thought he saw a glint of mischief in his servant's eye.  &quot;There is more?&quot; he asked darkly.<br>
&quot;Only this.  There is another who seeks the artifact.&quot;<br>
Ror glowered hotly at his minion's disrespectful play.  &quot;Don't toy with me Guptras Den.  Who?  Those foul little creatures of the Stone God?&quot;<br>
Guptras' eyes glittered at his master's impatience.  &quot;No, they think it destroyed.&quot;  He saw the look of fire his master gave him and decided to end the little guessing game.  &quot;An ally.  Seek out the warrior-priest Desmane, Duke of Dak-Kaska-Tar.  It is our Lord's wish that his aid be enlisted.  The reasons will become clear when you have met him.&quot;  Guptras smiled again, still enjoying his game.<br>
&quot;An ally?&quot;  Ror was nearing the end of his very short rope.  &quot;What need have I of an ally?&quot;<br>
&quot;I am not privy to that Master.  I only know that your alliance will be mutually beneficial, and that he already knows another servant of Dierguroth will be offering aid.&quot;  He grinned again, &quot;In accordance with our Lord's will, of course.&quot;<br>
Ror continued to glare fiercely at Guptras as he waved away the connection.  &quot;In accordance with our Lord's will.  Of course,&quot; he said to the now extinguished brazier.<br>
Desmane, he thought as he paced through the temple towards his study.  Apparently the petty little warlord now ruled over the darklands east of the marshes and forest where Ror's temple lay.  As if anyone could rule those wild lands of humanoid tribes and squalid human villages.  That he was a priest of Dierguroth Ror did not previously know.  Perhaps he could be of some use.  As Guptras said, it was in accordance with Dierguroth's will and as such not to be disputed.  Though his servant enjoyed his games as much as ever, Ror knew he spoke the truth.  Guptras Den was as loyal a servant of Dierguroth as he was to the High Priest.<br>
Entering his study, the only other chamber that had remained untouched by both his enemies and the marsh beyond, he fell heavily into a cushioned, high-back chair and sprawled into comfortable contemplation.  A few brief words and a meager plate of food, bottle of wine, and glass appeared on the small table nearby.  He had time, the path the Chosen was to walk would take years.  A soul could not be corrupted overnight and to breed one of consummate hatred and evil was like aging a fine wine.  Guptras Den was the finest winemaker of them all, he thought amusingly as he poured a glass of Thymallesran vintage.  Twisted words and mind manipulation were the press of his minion's work.  Dark deeds, illusion and corruption his wine.  Yes, Ror smiled to himself, Guptras was indeed the perfect guide for the one who would be the vessel for the Avatar.  Only the blackest of souls, one wrought in the fires of tragedy and the coals of desired revenge would be the proper receptacle for the God of Death himself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://drakksnet.homestead.com/files/Ghost.gif height=50 width=60" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/20/01 9:17:52 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 20</span><hr size=1> Greeneyes dragged herself into Kimbleton early the next afternoon.  Where the humanoids had gone she had no clue, but she had caught the first available merchant who would take coin for a ride.  Kimbleton, while not the size of Miera Kiy nor could it even be called a major city, was a vast sprawl of taverns, shops and entertainment.  Lying at the crossroads of Miera Kiy, Triark and Rimdale, the town had collected a variety of travelers who thought to capitalize on its prime location.<br>
Pushing past merchants who had set up wagons right on the street, she walked through the town not sure of where she would find the Kaskell Traders.  Instead she chose to find an inn to bathe and change into fresh clothing.<br>
Once she was done, her stomach rumbled and she decided some real food would be a welcome change.  Her nose guided her to a merchant selling roasting lamp on a spit.  Giving the cook her money, she continued walking while enjoying the sliced lamp inside a hollowed out roll of bread.  A small bottle of sweet-wine made the impromptu meal fit for a king and improved her spirits considerably.  Finding a large notice board outside a dry-goods store, she slowly drifted closer with the crowd who gathered around it.  Soon she was near enough to look through the assortment of announcements, job offers and items for sale or want.  Scanning over &quot;Adventurers Wanted&quot; and &quot;Puppies for Sale&quot; she found several notices with Kaskell Trading Co. written or printed across the top.<br>
Skimming over the hiring sections she found where they announced transport leaving every three days and where to board.  There was no cost listed nor was there a schedule, so she pushed her way back out and headed where the map had indicated departure point.<br>
After getting turned around twice and asking once for directions, she found the building where the trading company was located.<br>
&quot;Can I help you?&quot;  The tall human peered at her over the counter that looked decidedly small in comparison.  A quick look over her and he apparently made his own decision.  &quot;You are looking for transportation, yes?&quot;<br>
&quot;Uhm, yes,&quot; she answered, not sure how to take his appraisal.  &quot;To Triark,&quot; she decided.  She had no idea if she would get all the way there, or even if she would have to go further, despite her vision.  Triark was the only place she knew of in the direction her vision had indicated.<br>
&quot;You know we only provide transportation.  No accommodations, bedding, or meals are provided with your payment.  You will obey all rules and regulations posted and those tasked with enforcing said rules and regulations.&quot;  He spouted off the litany in well-practiced monotone.  &quot;Any violations of these rules is cause for immediate debarkation and possible arrest by the Torainian Tradesway Guard.  Do you understand these rules as I've explained them to you?&quot;<br>
She nodded uncertainly, wondering what other rules and regulations there were.  The tall man held out his open palm.  &quot;Two Queen's Marks please.&quot;<br>
She held back the urge to inform him where he could put the two gold coins as she handed them over.  He opened a small box sitting on the counter next to him and pulled out a small piece of heavy parchment.  Scrawling something on it, he then stamped it with the Kaskell Traders logo and, handing it to her, said dryly, &quot;Next transport leaves on the morrow, eighth band sharp.&quot;  He punctuated 'sharp' with an arch of both eyebrows.  &quot;Have a safe trip.&quot;  He immediately turned to do something or other, dismissing her outright.<br>
&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said, not waiting for the response she was sure wasn't forthcoming.  Placing the ticket in a pocket in her shirt, she walked out, wondering what to do until eighth band 'sharp' the next morning.<br>
She wandered for a while, occasionally stopping to admire the wares for sale.  When she saw the small cartographer's shop she stepped inside.  A gnomish looking man and two scruffy individuals, who could only be adventurers, were pouring over a map she couldn't quite make out.  Standing off to one side, her gaze was caught by a large map on the far right-hand wall.  As wide as a man was tall and half that in height, it displayed much of the Known Lands.  How accurate was anyone's guess but it made for a fine display.  Looking for Torain, then Triark, she traced her finger along her route wondering if the little man had a more detailed one.<br>
Seeing he was still occupied, she gazed over the rest of the map.  She found several countries she recognized.  Bakaksha, Thymallesra, Jorelan, Tye Basra, all neighbors of Torain.  A few others she had heard of; Daerga Ka, the dwarven homeland; and legendary Kira.  Others north and south she didn't recognize or weren't drawn in very well.<br>
Images flashed through her mind, smoke and fire, the clashing of steel and bodies in battle.  Dark creatures threatening to overrun their opponents in a war that couldn't be stopped.<br>
She started when the clerk touched her forearm.<br>
&quot;Miss, are you well?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied after a second. &quot;I'm fine, just daydreaming I suppose.&quot;<br>
&quot;Well then, is there anything I can do for you today?&quot;  He stood, hands clasped before him as he smiled expectantly at her.<br>
She grinned back, washing the images of war away.  &quot;I would like a map that shows the roads and towns between here and Triark.  Perhaps other features of interest also.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ah,&quot; he turned to go behind his counter.  &quot;The road map is simple enough, as for the other,&quot; he splayed both hands wide, &quot;there are many features of interest to many different types of buyers.&quot;<br>
She cocked her head, prompting him further.<br>
&quot;There are contour maps, environmental maps, mining survey maps, scenic maps, archeological maps.&quot;  He whispered conspiratorially to her, &quot;Suitable for the adventuring type.&quot;  She grinned and shook her head as he continued.  &quot;Agricultural maps and our finest product.&quot;  He paused dramatically, &quot;Maps with the most current Nexus locations plotted.  Our Skanelvati are all registered and provide us updates seasonally.&quot;  He appeared most proud of them and indeed, a registered Skanelvati, one who was sensitive to the lines of magic, was the only accepted location source for the highly contested Nexi.  Even if she had a use for these maps, she couldn't have afforded them.<br>
&quot;Do you have one with the roads and towns as well as other nearby villages, farms businesses and such?&quot;<br>
He smiled, &quot;Of course, the Deluxe Road Map of Northern Torain and Extreme Southwest Thymallesra including Rimdale, South of Triark.&quot;  He said the title as if he had a thousand more just as precise.  Greeneyes had little doubt he did.<br>
&quot;That should do.  May I see it first?&quot;<br>
&quot;Of course, the map is five silver and there is a five copper viewing fee if you wish to review it before you make a choice.&quot;  He waved one hand dismissively.  &quot;Protects us from those who just wish to view a map without purchase you see.&quot;  He smiled again, waiting for her decision.<br>
She dug the coins out and laid the copper on the counter.  He nodded while sweeping the coins into his hand and disappeared behind a curtain that no doubt led to his storehouse of maps.<br>
While she waited she glanced over at the large map again and wondered.  What vision had she just had?  Strange that it didn't seem like the others.  She couldn't grasp any link to herself or the child.  Shaking her head she turned back as the clerk returned, leather scroll case in hand.  Untying the end he extracted the parchment and spread it out before her.  It appeared to be quite a good map and she nodded her acceptance.<br>
&quot;The case is extra of course, one silver though for you,&quot; he beamed up at her, &quot;I'll wave the viewing fee and ask only an additional five copper.&quot;  She grinned again at his jovial attitude and pulled out the extra coin and laid it and the silver on the counter.  He beamed again as he swept up the coins and rolled the map into the case.  Tying it off he handed it to her.  &quot;Thank you Miss.  Please come by again sometime,&quot; he piped eagerly as she closed the door behind her.<br>
Topping off her rations before returning to the inn, she loaded her pack, ate a bland meal and retired for the night.  She missed Pippen terribly.  She imagined lying in his arms by a quiet stream and gazing up at the stars.  The comforting image guided her into sleep.<br>
<br>
Greeneyes awoke with a start the next morning.  &quot;Blast!&quot;  Looking out the window at the sun she realized it was almost seventh band already.  Throwing on her travelling clothes she made sure everything was packed away in its proper location and hurried downstairs.  Grabbing a morning roll and drink of apple juice she rushed out the door and off to where the Kaskell Trading Guild transport was to depart.<br>
Arriving with a few minutes to spare, she waited to turn over her ticket.  The 'transport' was a group of wagons, two flat and two covered.  A group of merchants and hired hands stood around the back of one talking loudly and laughing.  One hand was tying down the load on a flat wagon and two stableboys were just waking away from the last flat wagon.  A gray haired dwarf was taking tickets from the handful of passengers and a middle-aged human was talking with what looked liked to be a group of adventurers.<br>
As she was handing over her ticket and directed to one of the open wagons, two Tradesway Guards rode up and waved a greeting to the dwarf.<br>
&quot;Hai good Tagar, morning ta ya.&quot;<br>
The dwarf grumbled something and waved back as he took the last ticket.<br>
&quot;Heh, good a mood as ever, eh?&quot;  One guard, a black-haired man with a weather beaten face said to his companion.<br>
Greeneyes had not seen a mage as a Tradesway Guard before, but she could have been nothing but.  She was dressed in the same colors as her fellow but wore no armor.  Her sandy-blond hair fell naturally to her shoulders but was not overly long.  She was mature, but did not look as road-weary as her companion.  They continued to talk, nodding to the passengers and workers in greeting.  The male guard greeted Greeneyes as any other, his partner however gave her a strange, askance look of mild bewilderment.<br>
'Damn, she senses something.'  Greeneyes thought, though whether it was her items, personal craft, or the cloaking of it she couldn't be sure.  She smiled back at the two in the most nonchalant, innocent smile she could muster and walked to the wagon.<br>
She wished the hood of her cloak was over her head, though it would have served no real purpose other than to make the mage that much more suspicious.  She could feel eyes on her all the way to the wagon, but when she climbed up and chanced a look back the mage was chatting with on of the merchants.<br>
'Now I'm getting paranoid,' she thought, then remembered Dundare's warning.  She had no way of telling who knew her from before her 'death'.  Sighing, she promised herself to just keep an eye on the blond-haired mage.<br>
If it wasn't eighth band when the merchant train left it was too close to argue.  With the snap of reins and sharp shout at the horses the four wagons rolled out.  With them, two adventurers rode alongside the two guards.  She saw why Torain was such a haven for trade as they made their way out of Kimbleton and onto the road eastward.  The crowds of people already in the streets parted like wheat before the Tradesway Guard, leaving their passage unimpeded.<br>
Reaching the intersection a mile from town, they turned the corsairs north on the road to Triark, Thymallesra.  Land of the Elan. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://drakksnet.homestead.com/files/Ghost.gif height=50 width=60" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/20/01 9:19:05 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 21</span><hr size=1> Kreegar peered at the notice on the Horse and Wheel's public board.  It wasn't often work could be found, but he looked nonetheless.  He was a jack-of-all-trades, at least that's how he saw himself.  His skills were fair, and kept him working enough to eat, keep the little cabin he was raised in warm, and keep him in drinks at weeks end.  Whether it was sharpening Brennet Jarlesan's plowshare and axe, or the endless repairs to old Widow Sharl's shanty, he never ran out of things to do, but it seemed he never had more than a few coppers in his pockets.<br>
<br>
WANTED:  STRONG WORKERS FOR BUILDING RESTORATION.  MUST BE GOOD WITH STONE AND WOOD.  CARE REQUIRED FOR FINE STONE WORK.  MATERIALS AND FOREMAN ALREADY ON SITE.  TRANSPORTATION, MEALS AND LODGING PROVIDED.  DAILY PAY OF 1 KIRAN CROWN PER WORKER PAID DAILY.  MEET FOREMAN AT HORSE AND WHEEL AFTER MIDDAY, TORMA 15.<br>
NO QUESTIONS ASKED.<br>
<br>
'One crown each day!' Kreegar thought.  Kiran at that.  Restoration.  Some lord must be rebuilding a keep or something to pay so well.  The last line, 'NO QUESTIONS ASKED'&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  bothered him a bit, but only for a moment.  What did he care?  One gold crown a day was enough to buy his silence.<br>
<br>
Kreegar shuffled off in search of his friends, contemplating the life that much money would buy him.  Nenyeresa, one of the waitresses at the Horse and Wheel and the woman he was quite fond of, would be overjoyed.  She was a good woman and a hard worker.  With his pockets full from this job he could ask her to marry him and feel right about it.  Nenyeresa had hinted at marriage a few times, but he stepped around the topic as often as he could.  He wouldn't feel right not being able to make a proper home for her.  If the job went for a while, he could even take her off to Markstone where they would start a new life, away from the depressing life they lived in Miresway.  Miresway.  He couldn't even stand the name because it perfectly described his life.  Yes, this was the job he'd been waiting for.<br>
<br>
The place made his skin crawl.  It was much further from town than he liked and several miles inside the Drirrowmires.  The hired workers gathered near where the river entered the forest to board a flatboat.  The foreman, a bald, lanky man who looked like he had never lifted a plank his whole life, told them it was the only way to reach the work site, then made it a point to remind them of the wages they were earning.  The lodging was a workers camp of tents and wooden shacks that lay a mile from the great stone structure itself.  Travelling there at the beginning of the week, they would stay there until the end of the week.  Then they would again board the boat and slowly make their way back home.<br>
<br>
Neither he nor his friends liked the arrangements, but in tones meant to convince themselves they discussed the gold they would have in their pockets when they returned home.  Despite the foreman's appearance, they liked that he knew what he was doing and that he let them know exactly what he wanted.  The plans were laid out, scaffolding already built and all the tools they needed available.  The foreman's warning, do not leave the camp at night and never enter the building outside of working hours made Kreegar nervous again.  Apparently there was a nightshift that came in to clean up and resupply, but where they came from and where they went was a mystery not a single worker was in a hurry to solve.  If anyone gave the foreman's other warning, to never tell anybody of the work they did or where they did it, second notice Kreegar couldn't tell.  But he would remember it.  Something about the way the man's dark eyebrows drew together over his eyes when he said it told Kreegar the warning carried a lot of weight.<br>
<br>
The work progressed well.  The stone that remained intact went back together easily, and the new pieces made to replace those broken fitted perfectly.  Wooden supports, whether permanent frames to hold the stones in place during construction or temporary scaffolding to aid construction, went up swiftly.  They always seemed to have the proper materials, and tools dulled or broken one day were replaced by the next morning.  By the end of the week, when they took the long boat ride home, they felt like kings.  Five gold crowns were almost too much to spend.  Almost, he thought.  With two crowns tucked under the loose floorboard in his bedroom, Kreegar and his friends split off from the other workers and headed for the Horse and Wheel.<br>
<br>
Wine and women came easily that night.  Nenyeresa was thrilled at the windfall his new job provided, and practically proposed to Kreegar on the spot.  With a smile and kiss he told her to wait, it wouldn't be long.  She squealed and wrapped her arms around his neck tightly to return his kiss.<br>
They all got more than a little rowdy that evening, but no harm was done.  Then Kreegar overheard Jakem talking to the girl sitting on his lap about the job he was working that paid a king's wage.  It took a few kisses and hugs from Nenyeresa to bring Kreegar out of his sudden sulleness, but he soon was laughing raucously with his friends again.<br>
The next morning, after stumbling downstairs holding their splitting heads, they noticed Jakem still hadn't made an appearance.  Derren stomped back upstairs to pull their friend out of the arms of whomever he had bedded that night but found no one in Jakem's room.  Looking in the other rooms, just in case he had wandered into the wrong bed, he met with no success.  Neither Jakem nor the girl was to be seen.  Kreegar silenced the innkeep, Markus, with a few silver after he started complaining loudly about 'his' girl wandering off when she had work to do.  When the workers gathered together the next morning for their trip to the work site, Jakem didn't show.  His friends berated him amongst themselves for giving up the chance to live like a king, but Kreegar wasn't sure that was why his friend didn't show for work.<br>
<br>
Then there was the second shift.  They joked about the night shift who straightened their debris, restocked their supplies and worked after the sun fell, but none of them had ever seen them.  At least, not until the middle of the second week.  One of the other workers, a huge, hairy Dak-Kaskan named Torgus Ter woke early one morning to relieve himself and decided he'd get a look at this night shift himself.  The area outside the structure was abandoned, but hearing a noise just inside the entrance he fearlessly looked around the open door into the darkness.<br>
The workers found him that morning, huddled in a ball in his sleeping roll mumbling something about 'prakrevik ksazkta&quot;.  Another Dak-Kaskan paled when he heard his words and said it meant 'returned ancestors&quot;.  Nobody asked for further explanation, and when they stopped for a break latter that morning the big man was nowhere to be seen.  'Got spooked and ran into the marsh' most of the workers said.  Again, Kreegar suspected worse and kept his suspicions entirely to himself.<br>
Yes.  This place definitely had him spooked.<br>
<br>
The human workers were an unfortunate but necessary pain.  His creatures, the dead animated by Dierguroth's magic, while diligent and uncomplaining, were slow and could not handle the simplest of problems without exact directions.  Humans could be given a task and with the proper positive, or negative, motivation complete the task relatively unsupervised.<br>
Ror, in the guise of the foreman, was a demanding taskmaster.  He had supervised the building of the temple during its initial construction and knew where every block and timber went.  Only one worker had been foolish enough to venture into the temple at night.  He had come face to face with the horrid, rotting visage of one of the night shift and had run like a child back to his bed.  His gibbering ended only when one of the Priest's creatures broke his neck, dragged him into the marshes, and left him to be fed upon by the living creatures surrounding the temple.<br>
Ror regretted the waste, but there was no other place to take the big man that was beyond notice of the workers.  No matter, his disappearance had the effect he desired.  Work proceeded smoothly afterwards, the workers too smart or too scared to break any more rules, and they reaped the rewards at the end of the week.<br>
In three and a half weeks, fully two weeks ahead of schedule, the repairs were completed and the foreman gathered the workers together outside the building.  Their employer had expressed his pleasure at their hard work and early completion.  They were invited to partake in a sumptuous meal to celebrate the event.  A table and chairs had appeared overnight, as had the food, drink and women from the tavern in Miresway.  Kreegar didn't like it, but the food smelled wonderful.  When he saw the great smile on the foreman's face, his words of thanks and Nenyeresa appear by his side, he decided everything was fine.  What did it matter?  They were done here.  The gold that lay heavily in his pocket as well as under his floor was more than enough to get him started in Markstone city.  Smithing was his true calling in life and, with a new start and Nenyeresa by his side, his life would finally fall into place.<br>
The men piled into the room making great appreciative noises and comments over the food and servers.  The foreman stood at the head of the table smiling and waving them all in.  He thanked them again for the fine work and for helping to make him a rich man.  When they looked at him in wonder, he brought pouches laden with Kiran crowns from under the table and tossed one to each man.  A bonus, from their employer, he said to cheers and shouts.  'Eat and drink!' he shouted to start the feast, and eager hands brought food and drink to mouth.<br>
Kreegar hefted the bag and looked at Nenyeresa, who was firmly planted in his lap, downing a cup of wine.<br>
&quot;Marry me!&quot; he shouted over the noise to the woman.  A squeal of delight followed by a hug and kiss was his answer as he smiled happily and toasted his bride-to-be.<br>
<br>
'Hmm, only my third drink,' he wondered as he blinked some blurriness away.  Pouring another cup for Nenyeresa and himself, he laughed with her as he missed the rim a few times.  Bringing up the cup he blinked at his fuzzy vision.<br>
&quot;Strong drink,&quot; he mumbled before Nenyeresa knocked the brass cup from his hand.  What was her problem?  He looked to see her with her arm draped across the table and her head of long, blond hair lying next to his plate.  What was she doing?  He couldn't quite see her, so he leaned over to ask her and landed forehead first in his meal.<br>
<br>
Cruzaz Ror walked from the main room, the smile disappearing from his face the moment he passed the archway.  Turning the corner he looked to one of his minions.<br>
&quot;Ensure none go past this hallway, they should be done shortly.  When they are, take them to the tombs.&quot;<br>
The creature nodded its head, eyes gleaming with a cunning intelligence while wild, unkempt black hair bobbed about.  Grey, unlined skin gave the wight the appearance of a statue come to life.  Lips parted revealing needle thin teeth dripping with saliva as the undead creature grinned eagerly at its task.<br>
<br>
Kreegar woke in a foggy haze, his vision still blurry.  He couldn't move, but felt cold stone beneath his back and touching his shoulders.  In dim torchlight he could see somebody standing over him, smiling.<br>
&quot;Jakem?  That you?  Where'd you go?&quot; he tried to say, his words slurring unintelligibly.<br>
The one who had been Jakem, Kreegar's friend, snaked its tongue over stiletto teeth and hissed.<br>
&quot;Jakem?  Jakem?  Jake-&quot; The wight slid the granite coffin lid effortlessly shut, cutting off its occupant's cries and bringing silence to the tombs again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showMessageRange?topicID=18.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showMessageRange?topicID=18.topic&start=41&stop=42>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=18.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showNextMessage?topicID=18.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.emailToFriend?topicID=18.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.threadControl?topicID=18.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=18.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=18.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub141.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themithrilheartbrigade7573generaldiscussion">General Discussion<option value="themithrilheartbrigade7573rosterofmembers">Roster of Members<option value="themithrilheartbrigade7573tradebuysell">Trade/buy/sell<option value="themithrilheartbrigade7573officialstuff">Official Stuff<option value="themithrilheartbrigade7573frm12">Tradeskills<option value="themithrilheartbrigade7573frm13">Stories<option value="themithrilheartbrigade7573frm35">Neverwinter Nights<option value="themithrilheartbrigade7573frm36">Potential Introductions</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/bthemithrilheartbrigade7573>Mithril Heart Brigade messages</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13>Stories</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.mithrilheartbrigade.org">Home</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <table><td><form><font size="-1" face="verdana, arial"><b>EverQuest Links:</b>
