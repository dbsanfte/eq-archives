The crackling of the wood of once pretty wood cottages now fell in on themselves as the torrent of destruction only heightened itself to an almost unbearable and hopeless deliemma. Yes hope was there any left, an ounce of goodness to spare on this poor hamlet, perchance a God of light would lok this way and spare these poor people of the Jagged Pine this horendous carnage and hanis destruction. I was without hope for I Swanmay Shadowsong could find none to look to. ~<br>
<br>
~ I came to the Jagged Pine a fortnight ago to seek shelter from a coming storm, but I did not know that the coming storm would rain death and carnage instead of cleansing water. It hapened all at once during the calmness of night when the wind was low and carried no scent of the disgusting Gnoll invaders to warn what little guard there was. The attack was swift and bloody, it was to mere bravery of the guard and strategic layout of the town that the Gnolls did not conquer Jagged Pine that night. The grass bled that night and the sky was black, as a patch of mdnight that had never been cleared away. The death screams of men, women and children reached a cacophony of madness which began to feel my heart and mind with despair and hopelessness. The gnolls surrounded the small village and regrouped themselves, but come noon the next day they attacked when the heat and sun which seared our smoke stung eyes, and only cooked the now rotting corpses of lost loved ones and to make those who remained to retch upon themselves. I had often wondered what true death and horror was and now I did not wonder at all.~<br>
<br>
The coming of the night we could hear the gleefull howling of the gnolls all around the hamlet, I had taken an arrow in the arm and was rendered near helpless in the defense of this village, I was made to protect the children as a last ditch effort to make sure that someone knew what happened hear. Not a single man remained and so it was mothers, daughters and grandmothers who now raised their fathers, brothers and sons weapons in defense....they never had a chance... ~<br>
<br>
I could hear the first wave of Gnoll invaders as the desended upon the women protectors, and i heard the final screams of these brave wmen as their life was taken from them, I crept to a window of the church, the soft weeping of the towns children could be heard behind me, but I had to see what was going on for myself. I saw as 20 or so gnoll killers surrounded about 5 women and they gleefully picked at their weapons and prodded and poked the women with their wicked black weapons, just then A huge Gnoll came forward and said a grossly guttural word in the common toungue &quot;Breeding&quot; and pointed to the 5 remaing women. The women with faces devoid of hope, but still had the fire in them to not warrant that their bodies would be defiled while they still had some choice, all 5 women threw themselves upon their swords cursing the Gnolls as they did this. The huge Gnoll merely shrugged and turned away, the feeding frenzy was on. I could not believe my eyes as I saw these monsterous beasts tear into these freshly dead women and dig their ugly muzzles into their soft bodies ripping flesh and bone and enjoying every minute of it. what happened next I am still unsure how it happened and to this day I am unable to recount exactly what happened. ~<br>
<br>
~ I saw myself above my body as if I died and was floating above to look down on myself, I saw myself in slow motion charge out from the church, fired a crossbow bolt into the ugly face of the nearest gnoll and then smashed the now broken crossbow into the face of his dumbfounded companion. I was now among the gnolls, bllades drawn and I began a deadly dance to music that oonly I could hear. I was spinning, turning, diving, ducking, leaping, stabbing, slicing, dicing, ripping, punching, spitting, snarling, cursing, I was Killing any gnoll in sight. I could hear trumpets andhorns and mighty war drums getting louder and louder until I heard nothing but the Bardic Death Toll, which is the song of a Bards final performance. Eventually the gnolls recovered and I came crashing down back into my body and I found myself face first in the dirt half my face covered in hot, wet blood, some I knew was more than mine. I wasn't killed yet actually the gnolls proceeded to kick me and howl at the sound of my cracking and breaking bones. That is until they heard the crying of the children inside the church and their evil grins turned even more feral as the idea of soft meat came into their minds. I cried and crawled and did what I could to reach the children, but I was a mess and I knew i would meet death before i even saw the children. ~<br>
<br>
~ I thought death was coming as I heard it's howl in the distance, It was faint but it grew louder and yet louder. I noticed that the Gnolls heard this howl also and a look of puzzlement came over them. The howl was that of rage, the purest form of rage, like some crazed bear who was to unleash all it fury among anything it saw, I thought perchance a God himself had seen enough of this butchery and had come to right vengence upon the gnolls, because only a howl from a God could make the ground shake and trees sway and put fear into an entire army. Yes only a God could do this..or..his Champion. ~<br>
<br>
~From the treeline, closer to seven feet than six and built of solid steel came a warrior whos eyes litterly blazed with white fire of vengence and he carried with him blue lighting and red fire, and his vengence drank deep of Gnoll blood that day. The warrio came into the fray alone, but yet the gnolls fleed from him screaming &quot;righteous death has come unto them&quot; yes death had come to them and hell was quick on his heels. The warrior, tore, ripped, shattered, siced all gnoll bodies. he Giant warrior who stood a good foot taller thant the huge Gnoll met in the center of the Gnoll army and there amongst the mountain of gnoll bodies these to warriors met in kneed deep corpses they fought as Lighting smote the sky and flames lit their siloettes behind them. Others had come now, I saw warrior women, druidic halflings, dark lf necromancers, half-elf and wood elf alike rangers and druids, human monks along with the lizard people and spell casters who magic sprayed death everywhere. A human female came to me and broght life force back into my body, but I cared not for I watched the battle of Gods atop the mountain of bodies. I watched as now without weapons in hands the two warriors grappled and punched each other. The giant barbarian ducked a mighty swing that would have sent his head flying. Then grabbed hold of the dog-like had and ripped it from its shoulders. ~<br>
<br>
~ It was over the war and the gnolls fled. The giant barbarian threw the gnoll chieftans head to the ground and walked back down to us. the sun rose behind the giant warrior making him look all the more regal, it was surely a magical sight to behold. Just then a small dwarf in rogue like clothing came up to the barbarian and pointed in the direction of the hills. The steely gaze of the Barbarian had turned back into that righteous tempet of fire and he was off. The dwarf yelled &quot;NO ! Baraden it's suicide!!&quot; quickly the young lady who had healed me asked where Baraden was going? The dwarf solemenly replied &quot; to save the children I guess, the gnolls took them during the fight&quot;<br>
&quot;but he wont be able to save them if they are back in their caves there must be thousands of gnolls in there&quot; said the female cleric.<br>
~ Half a day had gone by before the remaing warriors had arrived and the last of the gnolls were found and killed in the small otlyig areas of Jagged Pine and allrady there was a plan to go into the gnolls caves and seek out baraden and hope against all hope the he and the children yet lived. ~<br>
~ Under the leadership of a female warrior named Velyessa and a cleric named Salve and the druidic leadership of Canilupus. The warriors began to set off in the direction of the caves. just then someone said they saw something in the treeline, somethin small was moving. Soon we could all see it...IT WAS THE CHILDREN !! running towards us arms outstreched and tears in their eyes. quickly we gathered them up and hugged them as if our own dear children were returned to us. Just then I heard someone whisoper in disbelief...&quot;I don't believe it&quot;...and there walking from the treeline came Baraden...against any hope I could think of he had done the impossabile, he had walkd into the fiery pits of hell and came out asking for more. We surrounded him and began clapping him on the back and cheering. Baraden put a finger to his lips and said &quot;Shhhhh, she is sleeping&quot; and when he opened his giant arms there lay a small wisp of a girl with golden hair, which he gently put into my arms and smiled.~<br>
<br>
~ There is a statue that now stands in front of Jagged Pine there is no name upon it and no glorious tale of why the statue is there, all that is insribed upon the statue is a single verse...&quot; He who had the Courage not to fail ~ <br>
