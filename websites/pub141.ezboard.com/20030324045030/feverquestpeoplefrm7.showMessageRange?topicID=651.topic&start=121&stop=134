I didn't tell anyone to can their opinion, rather to stop insisting that the majority of america doesn't vote. <br>
<br>
Perhaps poor people don't vote because they feel their opinion *Doesn't* count.<br>

The day after the election, they're still poor. Am I wrong? <p>*****<BR>

Basically anyone in the military that is E6 or below works at or below poverty level.  Doing the majority of those careers in the outside world, they could make significantly much more money.  For instance, Ryan could make $180,000.00 a year doing the same job he does now, making $27,000.00 a year.<br>
<br>
Ryan knows this, yet, he wants to be career military.  Because it isn't about the money, it's about family tradition, and American Pride for him.  <br>
<br>
People are poor all over this country, farmers, miners, people of the city...  they need to have their voices heard.<br>

<br>
FYI this IS me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://jens-smileys.netfirms.com/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
My friend didn't have an ezboard account.  That's the 1st &amp; last time he posts on my account, so I'll tell him to create one if he wants to continue.<br>
<br>
A couple of observations though:<br>
<br>
-Mys, you went off on him telling him to re-read the post &amp; leave you the fuck alone.  It looks like he double posted &amp; the first incomplete one might have looked like it was a reply to you.  It was a reply to Mojo, not you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://jens-smileys.netfirms.com/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
-Comparing voting trends in Sweden &amp; the US is not exactly comparing apples to apples.<br>
<br>
- Daynna Blinded by Patriotism?  Where in the post did he claim The US was perfect?  He had a problem with mojo's comment on the US.<br>
<br>
-Nem, He never said they were a monarchy TODAY.  Also, what is your point with immigration policy?  My take on his statement is that the Swedish population is pretty much Heterogeneous, and the US is a melting pot.  I disagree with what he said about why people don't vote, and I disagree with you too.  Everyone has their own reasons, and neither you or he can read everyone's minds to find out why people are or arent' voting.  Both of you made a broad generalization.  Finally, once again, where in his post did he say the US government was perfect.<br>
<br>
Again, I'll tell him to create his own account if he wants to respond.<br>

 I brought in the immigration policy information to show the irrelevence of his comment <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>By the way you should start making more little Swedes or at the present birth/death rates there won't be a Sweden very soon!!!!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
as well as <br>

We are a multicultural society that opens its doors to folks from around the world. What is your rate of immigration?????<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
He asked so I brought it up.<br>
Also, I never said that he said America was perfect.<br>
I said that he seemed to be blindly supporting his country and that he might want to rethink that.<br>
Yes, perhaps I did make a broad generalization on why people don't vote. You are correct, but it was a braod generalization supported by factual information that I researched before I posted. Most people who don't vote are sdisenchanted with the voting process and no longer care. It's a braod generalization that is true.<br>
Perhaps you should re-read his post and my post before you you try to support your friend. Then you might be better equipped to argue his points. As it is, you come off sounding like a parrot.<br>
Oh by the way, I can read minds and don't bother posting what you were just thinking because personal attacks aren't very nice <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://jens-smileys.netfirms.com/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  har har<br>

<br>
Nemnog, I decided to try to find out who was right about the population growth.  Geographyiq.com has Sweden listed with 9.91 births per 1000 population to go along with 10.61 deaths per 1000(2001 census).  They also show a population growth rate of 0.02%.  This doesn't agree at all with what you posted.<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.geographyiq.com/countries/us/United_States_people.htm">Sweden Data</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Also, I'm still trying to confirm or deny your statements regarding Sweden, Denmark, and Norway during World War II.  He is my friend, and although I do think his post was hot-headed and inflammatory, I have a problem with several responses.  His words were twisted and taken out of context.  I want to know who is right and who is wrong, and so far, you are looking wrong on the population info.<br>
<br>
I have no interest in personal attacks, so you must be reading someone else's mind <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://jens-smileys.netfirms.com/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Once again, /smack self for letting someone post on my account.<br>

The reason your info doesn't match mine; mine was from 1998. He made the comment that the population growth was negative. It is not. Your data and mine both prove that. He was wrong, end of story.<br>
THe infromation I posted was from a timeline of World War 2. I will try to find the exact time line structure I was looking at and post a link to it, so that you will know that among other things, I was correct, again.<br>
Not once did I take anything your friend posted out of context. I quoted him exactly, not verbatim and answered his post with factual evidence.  I did not twist his words as you have accused me. <br>
One other thing about his original post I would like to mention.<br>
Why did he even bring WWII into his post. I mean honestly, is that all that he can brag his country did? They didn't win the war single handedly, hell, until America was attacked, the goverment of the U.S. was content to sit on it's duff and not do a whole lot to contribute. If they had entered the war soon perhaps alot of deaths could have been avoided.<br>
If he's going to bring up achievements, why not something that didn't involve the death of thousands of innocents?<br>
I respect America and it's people for doing what they did, but I don't respect your friend for bring the subject up in a post where it doesn't really belong.<br>
The only reason I posted in the first place was because your friends comments were totally out of line.<br>
<br>
Nem, who is still right, and still thinks your friend is an fucktard. Pass it on thanks  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.rogers.com/jburditt0888/newsig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Mississippi Gal here..<br>
Yes.. you dont get much more southern than here...<br>
Im 26 years old and ive lived here since i was 3, being born in Illinois.<br>
With that out of the way...<br>
The Confederate flag as far as we have all known for years was our &quot;State&quot; flag.  We flew it, to represent our state just like everyone else around the country does to represent theirs.  A few years ago however, it was discovered that the Rebel flag wasnt our state flag... we never actually adobted a state flag, but since the rebel flag was always flown.... guess what.. there it stayed.<br>
So, incoming a rally to get the state flag changed.  Or should we say actually adopt a state flag of our own.<br>
Oh the bitching and ranting that occurred over this...<br>
I'm not one to show &quot;Southern Pride&quot;.. however, i dont have a problem with people doing so as long as they dont try to shove it in your face.  Everyone knows that the rebel flag has harsh memories behind it.  But that isnt the only memories it holds.  The South is different from most parts of the US.  Its a bit more laid back, as someone stated before folks are more likely to greet you and help a stranger.  They may not be as up to date and current on all the trends, but they are happy just the same.<br>
Im not one that wears the rebel flag on my shirt... or hangs it in my window, but when it came down to the removing of the flag as our state flag, I did disagree.  Because if Mississippi has used that flag for this long as their state flag, why change it now?  It has been a symbol of the state for years and years, but suddenly its wrong?  <br>
If anyone wants to see an over used flag.. go to Texas... My husband is from there, and i can tell you, ive never seen the rebel flag paraded around in all my days as much as i see the Texas flag in Texas.  Now, some of you are saying, well thats not the same thing, the Texas flag doesnt have the same meaning... well its a symbol of their state is it not?  A symbol of their beliefs?  And every one of them wear it proudly.<br>
Now, while the rebel flag has slightly different history, its still a symbol of the state, and yes, its a symbol of the south.<br>
Im am truely sorry for those out there that wear it to show their racism...for their igornance is more than i can stand anyway.  <br>
I come from a somewhat racist family.  My Aunt was in the KKK, my father and one of my brothers show thier dislikes to some... but its not just blacks.. they are like that to homosexuals and other people that they may consider different.  They dont flaunt it or act rude to them, but its comments they say behind thier backs that disgust me.<br>
Being raised in that enviroment did not however make me that way.  I dont see any differences in color, i just see the person.  I could care less what someones sexual preferences were, my ex roommate was gay and he was one of my closest friends.<br>
Not minding the Rebel flag displayed doesnt mean that you  see it as representing the bad things... it does mean you see it as more.  Im sorry for all of those that do have hard feelings when they see it.  But there are so many other reminders out there, why focus so much on that one piece of cloth?<br>
That time period will never be forgotten.. its taught in our classrooms. Its probably told to children and grandchild as stories about &quot;back in the day&quot;, although i never was told any myself except from dad saying he remembered when things were seperated...<br>
I once saw a t-shirt that said &quot;If you can wear your X, i can wear mine&quot;  and it was a rebel shirt.  It was during that time when alot of the Malcome X (forgive me if i mispelled it) shirts were popular... Some wore the X shirts for reasons that some considered rasists, some wore them for reasons of their own.  Its all in how you look at things... <br>
<br>
&quot;Opinions are like assholes, everyone has one&quot;<br>
<br>
I hate that this discussion fueled so many fires.  I think it was a really good topic.  Folks really shouldnt get so worked up over things.. gives ya ulcers and grey hairs!<br>
<br>
and yes i mis spelled alot...<br>
guess im one of those white trash southern rednecks that dont know their ass from a hole in the ground. I'll go back to my porch now and start whittling a tooth pick while i watch the grass grow... see yall...<br>

There will always be pride in something. When there is pride there is also negativity. I believe people choose to make issues out of non issues just for the pure purpose of increasing their pride.<br>
<br>
<br>
For every person who has said "I don't get, buy, or understand the southern pride thing. I say to you I bet you have cheered on a team, defended your state, town/city. <br>
<br>
Of course when things turn to prejudice and racism it's going to get very touchy and very confrontational. I don't think you'll find one person who will say slavery is correct or right. If you do. Well congratulations on your new slave. That being said. I don't believe that the flag is a symbol for slavery. That would be like saying the french, american and england flags are. Each one had a part in slavery and each shares the blame. <br>
<br>
Everyone holds onto their heritage. Name one culture in the united states that is not proud of their history. Whether you believe it's correct or not that's just how it is. <br>
<br>
Every culture has had mistakes and every culture has had greatness.<br>
<br>
The person who filed this complaint is as prejudice as the people they associated with slavery.<br>
