<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CARADHRAS<br>
<br>
GANDALF: Isn't it odd how we fell for about three miles, and yet we ended up <br>
on TOP of a mountain?<br>
<br>
BALROG: Who cares. It's freaking cold up here. I give up.<br>
<br>
GANDALF: Cool. I think I'll go buy myself something white. White is supposed <br>
to be the new black this year...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EMYN MUIL<br>
<br>
SAM and FRODO are sitting together on a rock. SAM stretches, and drops his <br>
arm around FRODO's shoulders.<br>
<br>
SAM: So, sir. Finally it's just you and me.<br>
<br>
FRODO: &quot;Finally&quot;? What do you mean?<br>
<br>
SAM: Oh, uh...nothing...<br>
<br>
FRODO: Well, you're wrong. We've got company.<br>
<br>
GOLLUM flies out of the rocks and pounces on FRODO.<br>
<br>
SAM: Hey! Wait your turn!<br>
<br>
SAM and FRODO tie up GOLLUM.<br>
<br>
GOLLUM: No! Smeagol not into ropes, nassty kinky hobbitses.<br>
<br>
FRODO: We just want you to take us to Mordor, you sicko.<br>
<br>
GOLLUM: Mordor? Hobbitses having little Goth phase, maybe? Very angsssty, <br>
wanting to go to Mordor, yes yes. Can Smeagol offer<br>
black eyeliner to angsssty hobbitses?<br>
<br>
SAM: You stop talking to Mr.--hmm. (to FRODO) You know, you wouldn't look <br>
half bad in eyeliner.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RIDDERMARK<br>
<br>
EOMER: Hi! Okay, stop me if you've heard this one. An elf, a man, and a <br>
dwarf walk into the Riddermark...<br>
<br>
LEGOLAS: Ooh! And the elf shoots arrows through this git who rides up on a <br>
horse. Yeah, I HAVE heard it! That's one of my favorites.<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: Down, Legolas. Hey, have you folks seen a couple little guys, about <br>
this high..?<br>
<br>
EOMER: Nope. Oh! Unless they were in that pile of corpses we burned.<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: Thank you; that's...useful...<br>
<br>
EOMER: Yeah; my bad. Here, have some horses.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
FANGORN FOREST<br>
<br>
MERRY: Yay! We escaped the Uruk-hai!<br>
<br>
PIPPIN: Uh, Merry? That tree is checking you out.<br>
<br>
TREEBEARD: Hoom! Furry lawn ornaments!<br>
<br>
TREEBEARD picks up MERRY and PIPPIN and carts them off.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
FANGORN FOREST (next day)<br>
<br>
GANDALF: Hey, kids. Miss me?<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: Gandalf! You're alive!<br>
<br>
LEGOLAS: I almost had a facial expression from the joy of it!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EDORAS<br>
<br>
LEMONLYE: A lot of political maneuvering takes place here. Let's see if I <br>
can summarize in ten lines or less.<br>
<br>
THEODEN: I have ash all over my face and cannot speak for myself.<br>
<br>
GRIMA: That's the way I like it.<br>
<br>
GANDALF: Be blinded by my new robes! Recover your smooth complexion and your <br>
senses!<br>
<br>
THEODEN: Hurrah! I am me again! But, damn, my son's dead.<br>
<br>
GRIMA: Hmm. I better run.<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: Good work, sire. Now collect your people and skedaddle to Helm's <br>
Deep.<br>
<br>
EOWYN: Hal-lo, handsome!<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: Hi. You handle pointy things very well.<br>
<br>
EOWYN: Yes. My only fear is dying a virgin. Hint, hint.<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: Okay! Well, let's move along.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EN ROUTE TO HELM'S DEEP<br>
<br>
LEGOLAS: Wargs!<br>
<br>
LEGOLAS and other warriors start slinging arrows and jumping onto horses.<br>
<br>
GIMLI: What was that God-awful noise?<br>
<br>
LEGOLAS: I'm guessing...wargs dying.<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: Actually, it was Legolas's fangirl contingent, shrieking in delight <br>
at his horseback-riding tricks.<br>
<br>
GIMLI: Ugh, that's sickening. Ooh, Aragorn, watch out! Cliff!<br>
<br>
ARAGORN falls off cliff.<br>
<br>
LEGOLAS: No! This is unbearable! I almost had ANOTHER facial expression!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ITHILIEN<br>
<br>
SAM: Gollum is such a freak.<br>
<br>
FRODO: Yeah, well, you're a jerk.<br>
<br>
SAM: What? He IS a freak.<br>
<br>
FRODO: Whatever, Sam. Want some cheese with your whine?<br>
<br>
SAM: Why are you picking on me?<br>
<br>
FRODO: I'm so sick of listening to you. It's always nag, nag, nag. I didn't <br>
ASK you to come along, you know.<br>
<br>
SAM: What the HELL?<br>
<br>
FRODO: Shut up. Screw you. Go away.<br>
<br>
SAM: What happened to the magic, Mr. Frodo? We used to stay up till dawn, <br>
laughing, talking, sharing...<br>
<br>
FRODO: Oh, spare me.<br>
<br>
FRODO stomps off.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RIVENDELL<br>
<br>
ARAGORN finds himself in RIVENDELL with ARWEN lying on top of him.<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: Hmm. This must be a dream.<br>
<br>
ARWEN: Why do you say that?<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: Because you're not even supposed to be IN this book.<br>
<br>
ARWEN: Don't be mean. I'll tell Daddy.<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: Whatever. Wake me up, would you? Since it's not really you licking <br>
my face, I have the awful suspicion it's a horse. Or maybe Gimli.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
HELM'S DEEP<br>
<br>
ARAGORN arrives and collides with LEGOLAS.<br>
<br>
LEGOLAS: Oh, good HEAVENS. You look TERRIBLE. You are NOT wearing THAT to <br>
the battle tonight, are you? And your HAIR! What will we<br>
DO with you?<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: Nice to see you, too.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RIVENDELL<br>
<br>
GALADRIEL: Hello? Is this Elrond?<br>
<br>
ELROND: Yes, speaking.<br>
<br>
GALADRIEL: Hi Elrond; it's Galadriel.<br>
<br>
ELROND: Hey, girl. Where are you?<br>
<br>
GALADRIEL: In Lothlorien; where else would I be? Listen, I really wanted to <br>
talk to you about Frodo.<br>
<br>
ELROND: Yeah, I've been wondering about him lately.<br>
<br>
GALADRIEL: He and Aragorn have SO much stuff to do.<br>
<br>
ELROND: I know! And Aragorn's being such a wiener, I'm not even sure I want <br>
him to marry my daughter...<br>
<br>
GALADRIEL: Did you see his hair the other week? Hello, greaseball.<br>
<br>
ELROND: And does he, like, only have that one shirt? Humans are so gross. <br>
Hang on; I'm getting another telepathy call.<br>
<br>
GANDALF: Hello? Hello? Elrond?<br>
<br>
GALADRIEL: Gandalf? Is that you?<br>
<br>
ELROND: Gandalf! Hey buddy!<br>
<br>
GANDALF: Do you have me on three-way telepathy calling? I hate that.<br>
<br>
ELROND: Yeah, sorry. I was talking to Galadriel. Hey, didn't you die or <br>
something?<br>
<br>
GANDALF: No, you twit. Now quit gossiping and listen. There's a war about to <br>
start at Helm's Deep.<br>
<br>
GALADRIEL: Yeah, and?<br>
<br>
GANDALF: And they need your help, moron.<br>
<br>
GALADRIEL: (exaggerated sigh) Fine, whatever. I'll send Haldir or something. <br>
He's expendable.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
HELM'S DEEP<br>
<br>
LEGOLAS: This is going to be most unpleasant. Hundreds of people will die.<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: Thank you, Captain Obvious.<br>
<br>
LEGOLAS: You're just jealous because I'm pretty.<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: You're just jealous because I'm going to be king.<br>
<br>
LEGOLAS: You can bite my ass.<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: Hey, blow me.<br>
<br>
(Ten minutes later)<br>
<br>
LEGOLAS: I didn't mean that.<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: It's okay. Me neither.<br>
<br>
LEGOLAS: Kiss and make up?<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: How about I squeeze your shoulder in a very special way?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
FANGORN FOREST<br>
<br>
PIPPIN: So we're STILL riding on this tree bloke's shoulders...<br>
<br>
MERRY: Uh-huh. I have splinters in places you don't even want to imagine.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ITHILIEN<br>
<br>
SAM seasons their rabbit stew as GOLLUM watches.<br>
<br>
GOLLUM: Ssstupid fat hobbit! Using sage in stew like thisss!<br>
<br>
SAM: What's your problem? Sage brings out the flavor.<br>
<br>
GOLLUM: Smeagol would use nice mix of rosemary and lavender, yess, precious.<br>
<br>
FRODO: Hey, you guys? Something's out there in the forest.<br>
<br>
SAM: Rosemary? Hm, maybe. But you know what WOULD be good with this, is a <br>
basic bechamel sauce with some dill.<br>
<br>
GOLLUM: Sssimple hobbit; anyone makesss bechamel. Vichyssoise much tastier <br>
and more difficult; yes...<br>
<br>
FRODO: Hello? Guys? Seriously, someone's coming.<br>
<br>
SAM: Now, if you only found us some eggs, I could make crepes, wrap up the <br>
meat, drizzle the juices over it with a little bit of blackcurrant <br>
chutney...<br>
<br>
FRODO: Hey, you guys, look! It's Martha Stewart!<br>
<br>
GOLLUM: Where?<br>
<br>
SAM: Where?<br>
<br>
FRODO: Now that I have your attention, may I point out the Oliphaunt that's <br>
about to step on us?<br>
<br>
FARAMIR: Look! Strange little men! Let's take them home.<br>
<br>
FARAMIR blindfolds SAM and FRODO and hauls them away.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
HELM'S DEEP<br>
<br>
ROHIRRIM GUARD: Sire, there are some really femmy people at the gate. They <br>
have bows.<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: Those are Elves. Let them in.<br>
<br>
ROHIRRIM GUARD: Oh! Elves! Wow, I didn't expect that.<br>
<br>
PEOPLE WHO READ THE BOOK: Neither did I...<br>
<br>
GIMLI: Arr! I'm funny because I'm short.<br>
<br>
LEGOLAS: I'm funny because I make fun of how short you are!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
HENNETH ANNUN<br>
<br>
FARAMIR: So, who are you, exactly?<br>
<br>
FRODO: I'm Frodo. This is Sam.<br>
<br>
FARAMIR: Your...image consultant?<br>
<br>
SAM: His gardener.<br>
<br>
FARAMIR: Ohh, like in a 'Lady Chatterley's Lover' kind of way?<br>
<br>
SAM: Exactly.<br>
<br>
FRODO: Righ?What??<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
HELM'S DEEP<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: This siege is lasting forever. These poor people...<br>
<br>
LEGOLAS: We will fight to the death. We will not fail you.<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: Oh, not you guys--I meant the audience.<br>
<br>
GIMLI: Aragorn! Toss me!<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: Um, is this really the time?<br>
<br>
GIMLI: Yes! Toss me!<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: Look, I don't think about you that way...<br>
<br>
GIMLI: No, you freak, throw me onto the Orcs!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
FANGORN FOREST<br>
<br>
TREEBEARD: We have opted, hoom, not to do a damn thing.<br>
<br>
PIPPIN: I didn't expect that.<br>
<br>
PEOPLE WHO HAVE READ THE BOOK: Neither did I...<br>
<br>
MERRY: Don't you even CARE? This is your planet too!<br>
<br>
PIPPIN: You're very handsome when you yell at trees, Merry.<br>
<br>
MERRY: Am I? Thanks.<br>
<br>
TREEBEARD: Hoom, don't care. Taking you home.<br>
<br>
PIPPIN: (to MERRY) Wait! I know. I'll bat my eyelashes at him.<br>
<br>
MERRY: Good plan. I know *I* sure can't resist you when you do that. (winks <br>
at PIPPIN)<br>
<br>
PIPPIN: (to TREEBEARD) Mr. Tree, sir, could you take us south, pleeeease?<br>
<br>
TREEBEARD: Ooom....Damn it, hoom...how can I say no to those eyes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
OSGILIATH<br>
<br>
FRODO puts on some black eyeliner, climbs to the top of a ruined building, <br>
and holds up the Ring. SAM pounces him and brings him tumbling down the<br>
stairs.<br>
<br>
FRODO: Ow! Hey! That's it?this time I'm cutting your throat.<br>
<br>
SAM: But Mr. Frodo...I was saving the world...you were going to give the <br>
Ring to that Nazgul...<br>
<br>
FRODO: No, I wasn't. I was doing a lightning experiment.<br>
<br>
SAM: Well, that's pretty stupid too, now isn't it.<br>
<br>
FRODO: Hmm. I suppose so. Sorry, dude.<br>
<br>
FRODO puts down the sword. SAM gets up and starts a speech.<br>
<br>
SAM: There are good things in the world. And that's what we're protecting. <br>
And up there, it's their time, but down here, it's OUR time...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ISENGARD<br>
<br>
TREEBEARD finds a field of stumps near SARUMAN's place.<br>
<br>
TREEBEARD: What the bloody... ENTS! ATTACK!<br>
<br>
MERRY: Once again, Pippin's wily eyelashes save the world.<br>
<br>
PIPPIN: Aww, you're just saying that.<br>
<br>
SAM (V.O.): ...And I have a dream that my eighteen children will one day <br>
live in a Shire where they will not be judged by the color of their teeth <br>
but by<br>
the content of their character...<br>
<br>
<br>
HELM'S DEEP<br>
<br>
GANDALF and EOMER and a few thousand ROHIRRIM come charging down and wipe <br>
out the rest of the ORC army. EOWYN and ARAGORN and LEGOLAS and GIMLI and <br>
THEODEN all cheer.<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: Gandalf, finally!<br>
<br>
GANDALF: Yes, my boy, I have come back.<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: Took you freaking long enough.<br>
<br>
SAM (V.O.): The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, <br>
but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the<br>
living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who <br>
fought here have thus far so nobly advanced...<br>
<br>
FRODO (V.O.): Um...Sam...<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: You know what would have been really cool, though...<br>
<br>
EOWYN: What?<br>
<br>
ARAGORN: An army of flesh-eating trees to destroy the Orcs who are running <br>
away.<br>
<br>
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that would have been cool.<br>
<br>
<br>
ISENGARD<br>
<br>
TREEBEARD: Hey. We're busy flooding Isengard here. We can't be two places at <br>
once.<br>
<br>
<br>
OSGILIATH<br>
<br>
SAM: ...let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is <br>
fear itself - nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which<br>
paralyzes needed efforts to-<br>
<br>
FRODO: SAM!!<br>
<br>
SAM: What?<br>
<br>
FRODO: They're letting us go. Come on.<br>
<br>
SAM: Oh. Oh, good.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EN ROUTE TO MORDOR<br>
<br>
SAM: They're going to tell stories about you. Frodo the Incredibly Cute.<br>
<br>
FRODO: Ordinarily I would tell you to stop hitting on me, but you've saved <br>
my life so many times now, I guess I'll settle for being<br>
uncomfortably flattered.<br>
<br>
SAM: Cool. Oh, and by the way?<br>
<br>
FRODO: Yes?<br>
<br>
SAM: The tortured look really does work for you. Very hot.<br>
<br>
FRODO: Aww, thanks. You deserve a special shoulder-squeeze for that.<br>
<br>
SAM: Did you learn that move from Aragorn?<br>
<br>
FRODO: Yeah. You like it?...<br>
<br>
GOLLUM: (mumble, mumble)...Kill...(mumble)...death to hobbits...(mumble <br>
mumble)...feed them to HER...(mumble,<br>
mumble)...pain, suffering...(mumble)...make them cry...(mumble)...kill <br>
hobbitses...(mumble) ...she will destroy hobbitses...<br>
