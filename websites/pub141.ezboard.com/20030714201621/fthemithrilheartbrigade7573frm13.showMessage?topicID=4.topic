************************************************************<br>
<br>
Shaylae stood on the brink of Fear, shaking, trembling. Her grip on her gem-encrusted scepter was so tight that she could almost see her white knuckles through her black gloves. Her first trip to the planes was not supposed to have been like this. Not a hastily organized rescue mission, fraught with danger. No, it should have been well organized, well led, well disciplined. Pikel would have been giving everyone instructions as if we were all newbies. “Make sure you have your assist key set up. Any one casting a mezzed mob and I’ll kick yer arse!” Braden would have been standing tall, strong, quiet, full of confidence, Kethry, serene by his side. Shay would probably have been standing next to Oolong the warrior, or Mcbeth the monk, her dear friends. As it was, Shay stood with some of the finest people in Norrath. Cutterjohn and Sandori, knights with strong yet gentle hearts, the enchanter Galendril, Jaren the mystical shaman, and Portnoy the priest. But, to venture into Fear unprepared…<br>
<br>
The call came. “Ready? Camouflage then enter! Now!” Shay was too nervous to notice that Jaren had already camouflaged her, and casting the spell again she reappeared. No matter, as the words completed she vanished. Sandori and Cutterjohn were already up the steps. Too scared to think, Shay ran forward, and without stopping reached the shimmering portal. As she stepped into it, she felt that familiar yet still strange disembodied feeling. For what seemed like an age, she was caught between two worlds…<br>
<br>
“Shaylae, have you finished memorizing your spells?”<br>
<br>
“No mother, not yet,” sighed the young wood elf. Memorizing spells took so long, and with that stupid book in front of her face she could never see what was going on. Why had father enrolled her in the school of druids? Why couldn’t she be a warrior like her big sister Brianna? Brianna always seemed to have so much fun, playing with swords, shields, armor, while she had to have her nose buried in a book, scribing and then memorizing spells!  It seemed to her such a waste of time! Sometimes while scribing her spells she would hear Brianna shrieking with delight as she wielded a sword, chasing a bat or a spider and Shay would look up, only to realize that the spell, nine-tenths written, would have to be started over. Brianna was half-a-foot taller than Shay, but never did she take advantage of this fact. Many is the time when they would both come home from school, noses bloodied and bodies bruised from battling the other half-elves who taunted Shay for being an elf. Brianna wore her wounds like trophies, shouting with glee the fate of the older half-elves who wore worse. Shay wore her wounds with a little less enthusiasm. <br>
<br>
The family moved to Freeport, home of the humans, where also lived elves and half elves in peace. It was there that Shay was first allowed to go out fighting with Brianna. “Don’t go further than the closest parts of the deserts of Northern Ro. Mind you stay away from the derv camps and undead. And Brianna, if I catch you taking Shay-shay to the Oasis…” the obvious threat did not need to be spoken. Shaylae thought it unfair that she was the reason they were not to go to the Oasis!  True, she was an elf, not as strong as her big sister, but just as scrappy. They had, after all, reached the same level in their respective classes. <br>
<br>
Together the sisters culled the snakes and scarabs. Brianna laughing with battle fury wielding her sword like a seasoned myrmidon. Shay could only marvel at the speed of her thrusts, parries, and sweeping slashes. Oblivious of her own wounds, Shay had to cast the spell of healing on her many times. She was not even sure Brianna noticed, but nevertheless, it was always the one spell Shay memorized perfectly. Very rarely did it fail as she spoke the ancient words that cast it. That’s not to say that on occasion she would inadvertently heal a mob. She still had a lot to learn. At first Shay was jealous of Brianna, especially as they moved on to fighting those ugly orc warriors. The young warrior would stand nose to nose with them, while Shay stood back, snared, and cast spells on them. But later, she realized that together they made a great team, ridding the land of those that would threaten their peace. Together they had a synergy, being able to cope with more than they could separately…<br>
<br>
“Have at ‘em,” shouted CJ as the memory was broken. Shay was faced with a scene of carnage, the likes of which she had never seen. Sandori was already in the thick of it, swinging her sword and casting spells. Shay ran quickly to the piles of dead bodies, not knowing what to do. Should she heal, or should she blast? Suddenly she realized she didn’t even know who the primary was. <br>
<br>
“I have Jaren as assist…” she said. Jaren chuckled kindly. Oh why did she not feel as relaxed? <br>
<br>
“I'm flattered Shay, but Hak is primary,” came back the gentle prompt. Quickly Shay sat and adjusted her assist. <br>
<br>
As she stood, she noticed that Gal was loosing health quickly. Enchanters were one of the most intelligent classes in Norrath, but also one of the most vulnerable. Perhaps in their own un-intelligent way the mobs knew how much a successful battle depended on the enchanter. Quickly Shay threw a healing spell his way. DAMN! She stumbled nervously over the words the spell failed. She took a deep breath and began the chant again; this time she saw his health rise. <br>
<br>
When she realized her father would never allow her to become a warrior, Shay had wanted to join the enchanter class, but was devastated when she learned wood elves could never do so. Druid had seemed a poor second choice at the time. But now, after fifty seasons she was now proud of her accomplishments. After all, it was she who had gathered the members of her guild together and transported them to the Feerrott and helped to make this rescue mission possible. <br>
<br>
“Come closer to the bodies,” someone shouted. Horrified at the sight of so many dead and wounded, Shay nevertheless came in closer. As the priests and vicars cast the spell of resurrection, people as naked as the day they were born began to recover their precious belongings. Mobs were everywhere. Some were standing mesmerized. Thank Tunare for the enchanters. For the next thirty minutes it seemed there was a never-ending cry of “Add!” Shay healed and blasted. She sat and regained mana, and then blasted and healed. She was not even sure if her presence here was making any difference. The stream of mobs seemed never ending. Had she risked her life, and added nothing to the rescue? It didn’t matter. She was a Heart. As if in a dream, she did what she felt she had to do. One by one, the dead were resurrected, the pile of bodies grew smaller, as more and more of those unfortunate souls were able to join the fray.<br>
<br>
Almost as quickly as it had begun, it was over. People were sitting around, laughing and joking. A few mobs came in, only to be quickly driven into the dust. Shay didn’t even bother to stand up. The realization of what she had just been through hit her, and she realized she was shaking. She felt out with her powerful mind, wondering what Brianna was up to. Shay giggled nervously. Brianna the Warlord was in Temple Veeshan. Of course she is, thought Shay, smiling. <br>
<br>
“There’s a few spots open, if any want to stay,” announced Skhale. <br>
<br>
“I’m staying,” said Jaren. “Me too,” came the responses from the others in her group. Shay just felt she had to leave.<br>
<br>
“I’m leaving,” said Shay. “If any one wants a ride, they can come with me.” Extending the reach of her voice to the zone, she repeated, “If any one wants a ride, they can come with me.”<br>
<br>
And so it ended, without further incident; a successful rescue mission, which Shay was proud to have been a part of. Perhaps now she had faced her fear of the planes, the next time would not be so bad. But now, she needed to rest, and to calm her beating heart.<br>
