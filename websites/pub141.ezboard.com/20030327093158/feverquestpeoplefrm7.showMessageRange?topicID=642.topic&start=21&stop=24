<br>
If there comes a time where I'm &quot;involved&quot; in a terrorist plot (I.E.  am on an airplane when hijackers take over) you better bet your ass they're going to have 290lbs of pissed off Canadian/American coming at them full on with intent to remove vital organs with his hands.<br>
<br>
No glory, no celebrity...I'd be doing it for me and everybody else in this country.  I'd be doing it for revenge, and for fear.  Most of all, I'd be doing it for those who have already been hurt, or potentially may be hurt by this person's actions.<br>
<br>
I'm sick of terrorism, and terrorists...I'm sick of politicians getting glory about their bills or legislations passing.  It may be my own personal misled belief...but if a persons only intent is to kill or harm or injure as many people as possible...they have NO rights.  Despite our wonderful Constitution...they do NOT deserve a fair trial if they were caught in the act.<br>
<br>
You saw what they did to the American Journalist in Pakistan.  Those people deserve NO sympathy.  They cut off his head, videotaped it, and figured it would strike fear into the hearts of Americans.  Screw them.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; Once again, my lack of skill with the written word reveals itself...accompanied with my frustration at the whole thing....grar!  Give me 10 minutes alone with Osama...please...I'll beat him so hard his grandmother will squeal in pain. &gt;&gt; <p>[60 High Priest] <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=132400&quot;">Thundergut Rumblebelly </a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->(Dwarf) &lt; Nameless Order &gt; <br>

Fuck terrorists and fuck the media for trying to get people in a panic. All the media seems to be doing is trying to get people to be more glued to their tvs with warnings like this.<br>
I'm going to live my life like I always have lived. Without fear. I understand things are different now, like border security and airport security and have no problem with it. In fact i'm all for it. I just wish it didn't have to happen because of terrorists attacks.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#77839D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub141.ezboard.com/beverquestpeople.showUserPublicProfile?gid=frogggystyle>Frogggystyle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Needs to Bug <br> Sy for a Title!</span><br>  Posts: 337<br> <font color=#F7E5C3>(11/19/02 9:25:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/feverquestpeoplefrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=642.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FBI Warns of 'Spectacular Attacks' </span><hr size=1> I see them hitting one of these structures -<br>
<br>
1) Empire State Building<br>
2) Sears Tower<br>
3) Hoover dam<br>
4) House of Representatives while they are in session<br>
5) Britain's Parliament while they are in session<br>
6) A stadium....full of people during a sporting event<br>
7) The White House<br>
<br>
Those are but a few that come to mind. They are looking to hit something symbolic of everythig they hate (which is anything related to American strength), all the while killing as many people as they can and inflicting massive psychological damage.<br>
<br>
If you look at the targets they hit last time, you would know that they 1) had lots of people in them, 2) were symbols of American strength, 3) caused significant psychological damage to the American people. <br>
<br>
Whatever they are going after, they are going to succeed on at least 50% of their targets. Why? Because there is a lot of freedom in America. Freedom to go anywhere you want is a beautiful blanket of obscurity when you have ill-intentions.<br>
<br>
A lot of people bitch at me when I say I support the new laws the government wants to make in being allowed to wire tap anyone they want, disallowing immigration and student visas until the person is *thoroughly investigated*, as well as other measures that would give the government absolute power to investigate anyone they wanted. I usually get the, &quot;That is communist! You want all our rights taken away! You are the devil!&quot; <br>
<br>
Well, not really, but I am a realist. We are too open. Those who mean us harm are allowed to do anything they wish within our country's borders. On one side you have the people screaming, &quot;Hey! You damn government officials and elected leaders need to do something to make us safe from terrorists!&quot; and on the other side you have people screaming, &quot;Don't go taking away *MY* rights. I am not a terrorist!&quot; It is a no-win situation for the government. And by that, it is a no-win situation for the safety and security of innocent Americans everywhere. Our own people have tied the hands of the very government they look to keeping our citizens safe. Why? Because the thought of taking away even one right is &quot;un-American.&quot; <br>
<br>
Typical theme of today's Americaqn citizen - &quot;Damn our country's safety! Damn our country's security! I don't want ANYONE reading my email.&quot; Your selfishness will be our country's undoing as our security and safety are martyred for your rights that you take for granted anyway.<br>
<br>
I don't mind the government having more access to personal information, making databases, etc. because it would allow them to do their job in searching out these terrorists. I am sure there are lots of people who say, &quot;Hey, that is invasion of my privacy!&quot; I wonder if those people would think the same thing if they could look into the future and see a massive terrorist attack on thousands of innocent lives (maybe someone they know and love) that could have been prevented if our government was allowed to do the things they need to to prevent such attacks.<br>
<br>
Hey, you're not the one getting blown to bits, so you don't want your rights infringed upon. The price of freedom was purchased by the blood of our forefathers. The price of today's security and safety is being paid for with the blood and lives of thousands of inocent people who have nothing to show for their purchase. It isn't your problem...now is it?<br>
