<br>
  “No, no, no!”<br>
          It was too late. The ornate alchemist’s table on the far side of the room suffered the brunt of the blast, and burned readily in the dry, hot study Gizzy had set aside for training his new apprentice.<br>
<br>
          Her name was Aethini, and she hailed from the fair western city of Qeynos. She was human, but Gizzy often felt her bloodlines ran into those of the barbarians because of her unstable temprament and constant urge for confrontation over diplomacy. She was young for the apprenticeship she had been given by him. Normally Gizzy wouldn’t have taken such a challenging apprentice, but Aethini’s parents had been brutally murdered mere months ago by a band of bandits. Gizzy was in her parent’s debt, as they had financed his entire alchemical career.<br>
          Gizzy waved his arms calmly back and forth and muttered mystical words into the air. As he did so, a cool breeze brought a hazy mist throughout the room. As the breeze settled in from of him, two steely blue eyes formed from the smoke of the blast.<br>
          “As you command, master,” the creature of mist said to Gizzy.<br>
          “Put that out, would you?” Gizzy requested.<br>
          The air creature immediately jumped to the task. It completely surrounded the blazing table, enclosing it. Within seconds, the fire had gone out, completely suffocated by the air elemental Gizzy had summoned.<br>
          Gizzy pondered this turn of events. As he did so, he realized the soft sobbing coming from beside him. Aethini was nearly in tears. He turned his gaze to her and when their eyes met, the tears began to roll. She cried heavily, half because of her master’s disapproval, and half because the events of her parents death still weighed heavily upon her. Gizzy put his hand on her shoulder to try to help steady her. She took the opportunity of this contact to embrace him tightly, crying into his robes.<br>
          “Aethini, that’s enough. There is nothing more we can do for today,” Gizzy said pushing her away. “After you’ve cleaned this mess up, I want you to run down to Crow’s and pick up a case of elven wine. I’m having guests tomorrow and we ran out after my last party.”<br>
          Aethini recoiled in shame. “Yessir,” she said between sniffles.<br>
          Gizzy turned about and left the room, his robes fluttering angrily behind him and his creature of mist in hot pursuit. Aethini stood there a moment, wiping the tears from her face. She realized that she had really done some serious damage this time. How often had Gizzy told her to get control over the mana flowing within her? She sighed deeply and tried to recall the last few moments.<br>
          Gizzy had just shown her a new spell from his spellbook. He had told her to read it, to memorize it, and to realize its potential. He had also told her NOT to cast this spell. She was to wait until tomorrow, when they were in the hills outside of Qeynos, to try it.<br>
          Well, she had done most of it right. She had sat there reading from the enormous spellbook as Gizzy had gone into the side chamber to prepare his packs for an upcoming journey to Kunark. She memorized the spell, reading it over and over again until the fiery words formed permanent images in her mind. But there was one word, one particular part of the incantation, that she could not quite figure how to pronounce.<br>
          She sat there trying and trying and could not get the words straight. Her impatience overwhelmed her, and she knew that a spell would become easier to cast once the incantation had been done a few times. Besides, it was only the end of the incantation that she need practice, and Gizzy was in the other room.<br>
          Well, Gizzy had heard her, and he ran into the room screaming for her to stop, realizing as he ran that it was already too late. Anger welled within him. He had given her direction over and over again, only to be ignored.<br>
          Aethini began her cleanup. She clenched her fist tightly, shaking her hand back and forth and spoke a single word of magic.<br>
          “Pocket!”<br>
          A shower of green sparks surrounded her arm. After it had dissipated, a small glowing bag had formed in her tightly clenched hand. She grabbed the broom from the corner of the room and swept up as much of the dust and embers that she could.<br>
          “I cannot do this anymore,” she said to herself as she worked. “I need to get out of here, I cannot stand the feeling that I am constantly disappointing my master.”<br>
          She gathered up the refuse of the table putting it into the small summoned bag for disposal. Several minutes later, she was out the door to finish her final chore for the evening.<br>
          The streets of Qeynos bustled with activity. Vendors shouted enticing offers to passers-by, people milled about asking directions to the dock, it was a typical late afternoon in Qeynos. Aethini sighed as she worked her way out of Gizzy’s loft and into the city. She thoroughly enjoyed those chores Gizzy gave her that required her leaving his home. She never really felt comfortable there, and she was well aware of the reasons why he took care of her the way he did. She shook off the oncoming thought of her parent’s demise and picked up her step. Qeynos may be the safest of all cities on Antonica, but nowhere was it safe after the sun went down.<br>
          Crow nodded to Aethini as she walked into the tavern.<br>
          “Hold on a moment lass,” he grunted at her. “I’ve got Gizzy’s wine in the cellar. I gotta go get it, it’ll be a minute.”<br>
          Aethini nodded and took a stool beside a gnome at the bar. The gnome looked over at her and winked.<br>
          “Hello, Aethini,” he said with a toothy grin. “My name is Pezzim, and I hail from Ak`Anon on the continent of Faydwer.”<br>
          Aethini looked at the gnome suspiciously.<br>
          “How’d you know my name?” she asked immediately.<br>
          “I am an enchanter,” he replied. “You don’t remember it, but you told me your name five minutes ago. Please, don’t get angry, but it was necessary for me to enter your mind. I’ve been here for some time now.”<br>
          Aethini gasped in astonishment as Pezzim spoke these last words without moving his mouth. She heard him speak them without actually hearing them. It was more like an intense thought. She began to flush with anger, the words of the incantation she used to incinerate Gizzy’s desk flashed before her eyes.<br>
          “Now, now,” Pezzim whispered calmly, “I am in need of you, my dear. You see, my magics have all been spent learning about you, and I am now at your mercy.”<br>
          Aethini grinned evilly.<br>
          “That’s fine with me,” she purred, “I didn’t want to dirty my robes tonight anyway.”<br>
          Pezzim winced.<br>
          “I ask for your companionship, m’lady. While my skills are vast, I possess very limited defensive and offensive magics. I understand that you are a specialist in the areas that I am not. We would compliment each other very nicely.”<br>
          Aethini sat back and considered this turn of events. Had she not just moments ago wished for an opportunity just like this? Where would this gnome take her? Gnomes had a bad reputation in Qeynos. Most were considered dirty, disrespectful and nastly. Most humans considered it a miracle that they had mastered magic at all.<br>
          Aethini looked again at Pezzim. He sat there, his feet dangling a good two feet from the ground. Crow’s barstools weren’t build for gnomes, and Aethini immediately dismissed what she thought she knew of gnomes. Maybe he had done something to her, but whatever it was, she liked it, and she liked him. She nodded slowly at Pezzim, her evil grin turning into an impish smile.<br>
          Crow returned just then and plopped a large wooden case on the counter.<br>
          “Just put this on Gizzy’s account,” Aethini said to him. “And could you add 24 short beers to this order, please?”<br>
          “Right,” was Crow’s reply.<br>
          Aethini summoned several more bags and stuffed bottle after bottle of elven wine and beer into them. When she was done, she stepped behind Pezzim and snapped her fingers causing a single tongue of flame to jump from her index finger to Pezzim’s hood, lighting it on fire. Pezzim scrambled wildly to put out the fire, falling face first onto the tavern floor from his stool in the process.<br>
          “That’s for the mind games,” she hissed at him as he rubbed his newly bruised face, “Now lets get the hell outta here. I’ve got plenty of anesthetic in my bags for that bruise on your face.”<br>
          The two of them walked out of Crow’s tavern and headed for Qeynos’ front gate. Aethini gave the guards a nod and a smile as she had always done. The guards smiled back with inquisitive looks upon their faces when they noticed her companion.<br>
          “I didn’t bring any food or drink, Aethini,” Pezzim said shyly, “Ya think you could summon me some?”<br>
          Aethini sighed heavily, already wondering if she had made the right decision this night.<br>
<br>

I wrote this story in loving memory of Meredith Coyle. She played EQ with me for the last year and a half as Aethini Martini. My character was Pezzim Swizzlestick. Meri died two weeks ago. She was a RL friend and companion.<br>
<br>
I miss you Aethini!<br>
