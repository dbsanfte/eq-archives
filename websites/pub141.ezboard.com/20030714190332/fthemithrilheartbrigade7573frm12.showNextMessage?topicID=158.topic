<br>
The very upper end Dwarven Cultural armor is really sweet stuffs for some of us and I have lamented for past couple o years there is no way for me to skill that doesn't completely break me and CJ..or the components readily available without bein ultra rare if not hte expensive route..but I think I have a way...so soon i'm gonna start doin Shadowscream..will take me as high as I wanna go..cheaply..no tempers..just collection of the drops...only...one drop is no drop...one drop is no rent....one droppable....SO..I gotta go and spend aa while on off night collecting the no drop and the droppable ones til i get a bag full o each then collect the no rent stuff about 20 at a time when i'm ready to smith..molds for a try are about 2p...so a really cheap way to skill if I can collect the stuffs..but..this is where I may want a lil help one night when a few dun have any major plans..Sethry is gonna run me thru the hammer/anvil quest..but i'll need many of the drops for skilling. The drops are Wailing substace and shreiking substance off owlbears and sonic wolves which i'm told has a uncommon drop off wanderers...so slow collection unless i do Howlingshade war. What I need is some info from anyone who has done this a few times to show me how it works...I was told 3 or 4 wars could get me a lot cause the ones that sppawn in the camps during it drop a lot of the stuff commonly...lots more that wanderers. The gist of the war is there are 3 diff camps in HSM grimlings, owlbears, and dogs...need a few to help me make owls win one...then when all camps are owls...farm them til i can't kill owls no more for a night...then redo another night to let dogs win...one to get me a bag of shreiking substance..one to get me a bag of wailing...then i'll get my no drop stuff alone prolly as I smith. I am goin on msg board info and tells from friends..so I dunno a lot of the war..but it seems really easy for a few to do a higher levels. And, from what I'm told..may only need peeps to help me get the side I want to win in the camps..then I can kill the owls/dogs once camps are set..and they could go and do something else instead of helpin me kill greenies...I know myself, CJ, Theo, and Tom all lookin to get a piece(s) of some o that...but I need skill..just need some help gettin set up. If anyone wants to help me any level class welcome and anything that drops off nameds you are welcome too all i want is my smithing stuffs. I was told 2 or 3 peeps could win battle at each camp so any info would be a great help...any time when guild isn't doin nuttin lemme know if you can help. Oh, and if I get where I can make the armor...free to all guildie mains if they just help me get the stuff for armor..ie., BDs, ore enchanted...stuff like that..none to be sold.only to make for those freiends/guildies that need..i'll even buy all the ENC 's enchant brellium spell when ready if needed).<br>

so, get me to help you farm for some swirling shadows someday ( the most managable place to farm em imo is the island in twilight..  and the mobs lifetap, but not thru my pets rune), and we can make you the 8 disks... the rest is easy enough <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
as for the wars, not a clue here (  i did my wolf farming in TM off the roaming mobs, as i was also pulling aliens for acrylia and windstone drops.  don't know how well clerics can solo these, but mr. ginsu makes short work of em...<br>

<br>
So you know, I found a very reasonable dwarven smith a while back and negotiated for Underfoot Bp, Helm, Legs, Bracers..  I do still want arms gloves and boots becuase I like the look..  <br>
<br>
So I can put my alts at your disposal for killing stuff in those zones for a few nights if ye want.. 51 Bard and 47 Beastlord.. actually in a few yellow Saralai 33 Wiz will capable of porting folks around and we can use her for transport..<br>
<br>
One other thing to be aware of is that you will need tons of BDs for the cultural stuff..  may want to have folks start savig them now for you...  I have about 8 in inventory.. and I usually check bazaar while I am there for any that are for sale under 600p..  Jazzi also has about 10 mercury drops hangin about..<br>
<br>
One other thought, is to see if the folks in guild are willing to focus their smithing efforts and or supplies on having one person who can actually do the smithing... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub141.ezboard.com/bthemithrilheartbrigade7573.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sethry>Sethry</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sold Spot to the<br>Glue Factory</span><br>  Posts: 759<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/14/03 12:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=156.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: possible light in sight for my smithing</span><hr size=1> &lt;cough&gt; PoGisaBDfarm &lt;cough&gt;<br>

<br>
I'm gonna focus on skill first til i hit 225 i think before i even try Underfoot...then i'll worry bout the BD's...CJ and I have 8 I think..and been collectin them forver..but as I said...i'm gonna try and skill a ways before I try this stuff...wantin at least  a pretty good chance at success before I attempt them..but I'll keep ya updated...also..Tom, Bar, Seth and a few more keepin me metal drops outa POP...i can skill off these also..just tryin to hunt up the temper ingredients i need to work the metals..so a lot of bankin on them til i get the tempers..but it's  a great help nonetheless..i'll try and get tempers to work the metals as i do my SS armors for skill...and metal sheets rings I make from the PoP metals, ices, magmas, etc I get from PoP i will bank..not sell..so if one day someone in the guild needs i will have them..again..I can't tell ya how much of a help this is guys...the acrylia plate is just NOT an option for me to skill....freakin windstones are rediculous....rarer than rare in my experience. Also..Garavic says he can help me get mercury now...says he can make it..so I may be ok with that). The owlbear camp in PC seth..that the one with the named spawn in it?..if so..always camped...or has been when i was shown it a few times..and as for cleric huntin them mobs down in TM and such...yes..I CAN...but it's a real mana drain on me..and you'll never imaagine how slow it is(...thanks again for the input guys...as always...mucho appreciated<br>

All you have to do is wait for the zone-wide messages about which race is attacking and which is defending. There is no way to speed this process up contrary to popular belief. <br>
<br>
At server reset,  owlbears are in the north, sonic wolfs in the east, and grimlings in the south. The south camp is where you want the wolves/owlbears as this is the only place that substances will drop. <br>
<br>
There is a pathing issue with the north camp that doesn't allow them to attack the east camp.<br>
<br>
You want the invaders of the race you want to take over the south camp to get into the chieften's hut. To do that you must kill the cheif, his guards, and the defenders that spawn after the attack has been declared.<br>
<br>
I'm not very good at saying what I mean without actually speaking  hehe  but I hope this is of some help.<br>
<br>
I get about 50 substances an hour when the zone is in my favor, but I can rarely sit down for that long.<br>
<br>
I wish I would have took the time to come here sooner, Owlbears owned the zone for the past week or so before the patch today. <br>

<br>
you have 10 minutes after the zone wide message to kill the defenders, cheiften, and his 2 bodyguards, you actually dont need to kill them all if you are daring. <br>
<br>
you can agro all 7 mobs when the invading race is almost to the hut, and they will walk right in  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ,  but you may have to gate out and come back  hehe.<br>
