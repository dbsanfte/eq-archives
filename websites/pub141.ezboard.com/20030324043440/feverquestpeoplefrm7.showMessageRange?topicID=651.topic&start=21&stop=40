Let people wave their own flags.  It doesn't mean you have to do it.<br>
<br>
As for the south, I've never found a more friendly, laid back place to live in the country.  If your car breaks down on the side of the road, 5 people will stop and help you.  Strangers passing on the street say Good Morning! or Hello.  If you call for help, you'll get it. <br>
<br>
The above is not true for other 3 regions I've lived in (NY, Colorado, and California) I've lived in.<br>

I am disappointed in you.<br>
<br>
As for your quote of what I wrote, you are failing to give credit to the fact that this particular flag is much a symbol of slavery as a white hood is to the KKK and hatred. That is what I am addressing when I say, &quot;I am trying to understand why a lot of these southerners find it necessary to wave that flag around knowing that it inspire a lot of ill feelings, especially in areas where racism is *still* a really big problem.&quot; They knowingly display this article that inspires thoughts of slavery and black-hatred, regardless of what part of the country it is shown in.<br>
<br>
I hardly think waving this flag around is the same as me having &quot;the EXACT same reason (I) have a right (and feel the need) to be a &quot;cynical prick&quot;. I do not hide what I am. However, people that wave that flag knowingly wave it regardless of the symbol that it stands for. I do not try to disguise my words with slight of hand, I tell it like I see it. People that wave that flag have ulterior thoughts. Sure, sure...they can say it is southern pride. They could also say wearing a white hood with poked-out eyeholes keeps their head warm, but everyone knows what it really means.<br>
<br>
Your &quot;Hey, I just call it like I see it,&quot; jab was rather pathetic. You aren't calling it like you see it, you are merely mocking without any attempt at thinking or using what brain you have in your head. Your &quot;Practice what you preach&quot; comment, snide as it was, was a rather sophomoric attempt to belittle me as well. You are going to have to try a lot harder than that if you want to pursue this. I recommend against it though. It will be fruitless, and you won't like the road it leads to.<br>
<br>

Symbols mean different things to different people.<br>
<br>
I happen to wear a &quot;Miraculous Mary Medal&quot; around my neck 24 hours 7 days a week. No one ever sees it, to some it would embody Christianity (Catholicism) in nearly its entirety and some would rather stone me rather than to ignore the fact that I wear one (if they knew it) no matter what the reason I do.<br>
<br>
Some may raise this flag as an innocent “southern pride” and still be all as one with their beliefs in our Country, people, and races that make up the US. (Being as the south does have a slightly different upbringing from the north back in the day) <br>
<br>
I was brought up as an “Sicilian American” my grandfather was from Palermo, I am not 100% Italian/Sicilian, my father first born in the US. My mother is A slight grand US mix. I understand and recognize the suffering immigrants went through across the board. My Grandfather a tradesmen started over playing the violin on the street and selling fruit from a cart to support my family once established. <br>
<br>
That is a far cry different from the races and people that where persecuted throughout the US in our past history. <br>
<br>
Our American flag as the Confederate flag is a symbol, it means so many different things to different people. Just as the Medal that I wear does. <br>
<br>
One can ignore a given symbol no matter what the meaning some hold to it. The German Swastika was once (in a fashion) a symbol of Christianity. Does it make me a slight uncomfy when I see someone with a Swastika? You know it. Would I ever change it so I would not have the right to ignore seeing it in public? <br>
<br>
Never, if you take away the right to show a flag, a Swastika, or my Medal we would take away more than most think.<br>
<br>
Simply I walk the middle ground. Many things along our life will and do upset our beliefs and us. Can we change them? Political issues (as this) will never be settled upon. There are far to many “left” and “right” thinkers. Do I sympathize with those that despise the flag for at one time what it “could” have stood for? You bet your ass, however do I also understand what the people that choose to show any symbol that embodies ones persons loss of any right?<br>
<br>
You bet your ass.<br>
<br>
Middle ground. It is hard to walk at times but it’s the best route given some circumstances. <br>
<br>
PS this probably did not make sense. <br>

<br>
When I said:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>They're both symbols of very different points of view for the most part, I'm sure others display them for the sheer fact that they believe them to be &quot;cool.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
it was not meant the way you took it.  It was not meant to be &quot;cool&quot; as in &quot;hey, waving around this flag will impress my friends.&quot;  Perhaps it was a bad choice of words on my part, and I'm the first person to point out that my skill with the written word is sorely lacking.<br>
<br>
If you have a favorite thing...a watch, a pair of shoes, etc...you own them and wear them because you like them for one reason or another, and basically see them as being &quot;cool.&quot;  Other people choose flags as their form of favorite thing.<br>
<br>
Whether it is the Confederate flag, the UN Flag, or whatever, it represents something to them, therefore they see it as &quot;cool.&quot;  That is my elementary-vocabulary-level way of putting it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Thunder, your response baffles me. I don't believe those flags represent anything cool..and I assure you my father doesn't own a Confederate flag to impress my friends.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Basically, what this statement of yours tells me is that you've taken this topic too seriously, after you pointed out that you much prefer to stay out of these types of discussions.<br>
<br>
I am not prejudiced in any way, shape, or form.  I have homosexual friends, I have African-American friends, and I count some of these people amongst the best friends a person could have.<br>
<br>
Regardless of whether or not YOU see a flag as representing anything &quot;cool&quot; there's always going to be someone who does...be it their true beliefs (regardless of how deluded you may think them to be) or maybe they're just looking for something &quot;outside of the box&quot; to latch onto to be different.  It is symbolic for them in a way, much like anything else is.<br>
<br>
I don't wave a flag of any sort, but I don't necessarily begrudge anybody else from waving their own flags.  If I see someone waving a Confederate Flag or a Black Panthers insignia, or whatever, I may say to myself.. &quot;You know self...these people are a bit too extreme.  Why can't we all just get along?&quot;... but I do not get out of my car and demand they take it down, remove it, throw it away, burn it, etc...because I don't like what it represents.<br>
<br>
I hope this explains my prior post a bit Mapes...I don't usually set out to offend people, and I certainly didn't this time.  I was just saying that everybody has their own opinions...who am I to yell and scream until they &quot;conform&quot; to what I see as normal?<br>

Well I agree with alot of different points here. But if I were to post my opinion, it would be something of an essay (LOL for when I have something to say, I always have quite a bit to say - what can I say, I'm opinionated <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://jens-smileys.netfirms.com/giggle.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) and consume a lot oftime I don't have today, so maybe I'll get back to ya on this one, but so far you all look to be bringing up some very and pratical, relevent points (ALL OF YOU)....<br>

To me personally the confederate flag means nothing. But it is a symbol and symbols mean different things to different people. Even with with a group of friends you may have a word that means something else to you and your friends than to the rest of the world, it is just a symbol that you think is funny or reminds you and your friends of something etc. We all have things we hear, see, touch and eat that we don't like but other people do. Some people like to use the word &quot;fuck&quot; and others are offended by it. It is our right to say words like that or ignore them. If I were offended by the word &quot;fuck&quot; I could asked people not to say it around me but they have the right to say &quot;fuck&quot; off. I could go on and on but I'll just leave it at that. I have a headache and can't really think so hope that made sense. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#77839D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub141.ezboard.com/beverquestpeople.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lyllian>Lyllian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=cc00ff >Veggie Girl</font></span><br>  Posts: 967<br> <font color=#F7E5C3>(11/19/02 7:39:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/feverquestpeoplefrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=651.topic&index=35>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://64.49.221.207/pix/Lyllian/doll5_copy.gif  height=141 width=85 ></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Confederate Flag:  Pride or Prejudice?</span><hr size=1> I dont get involved in dicussions liek this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://jens-smileys.netfirms.com/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Its a flag for peats sake. Its jsut like waving a sign around that says &quot; I love cheese&quot;. People can interpret it however they want and will, but in the end its just a flag.  Making prejidice about people becuase of thier home area or flag they wave is degrading and insulting. The civil war ended 150 years ago.
