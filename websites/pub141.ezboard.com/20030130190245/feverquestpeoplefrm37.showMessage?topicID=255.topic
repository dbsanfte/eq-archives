Unknown<br>
A man walked into the corner store with a shotgun and demanded all of the money from the cash register. After the cashier put the money in the bag as instructed, the man demanded the bottle of Scotch he saw behind the counter. The cashier refused to hand over the Scotch because he did not believe the man was 21. The robber swore he was, but still the clerk refused. Finally, the robber handed over his ID and proved that he was indeed twenty-one. As soon as he left, the cashier called and gave the police the name and address of the man who had just robbed the store. The suspect was arrested two hours later.<br>
 <br>
Less Than Before<br>
Unknown<br>

 <br>
Miscalculation<br>
France<br>
Recently in France, two criminals decided it would be genius to break into a bank from a neighboring building. They decided to drill through the wall so they could reach the banks vault. After hours of exhausting labor, they finally broke through. Upon entering the room, however, they discovered that had miscalculated the location of the vault and were instead standing in the middle of the restroom. <br>
 <br>
Left Behind<br>
Virginia Beach, VA<br>
Police in Virginia Beach, Virginia charged Charles Robertson, 19, with bank robbery after he made a series of dumb mistakes. After handing the teller a note of demands, Robertson retrieved the money and began to flee. Realizing he had forgotten the note, Robertson rushed back to the bank and grabbed the incriminating evidence. Racing back to his getaway car, he discovered that he had left the keys at the bank. Managing to elude police, Robertson made his way home and told his roommate, whose car he had borrowed, that it had been stolen. Very upset, his roommate called and reported his car stolen. Less than twenty minutes later, Officer Mike Koch spotted the car just a block from the bank. The officer retrieved the keys that had been left at the scene of the crime. When the keys fit the car, the officers went to the address the car's owner had given and arrested Robertson. <br>

 <br>
Camera's See all<br>
New Hampshire<br>
This is a story of a police officer in NH. He pulled over a woman and told her to get out of her car. He started to beat her with the nightstick. He then told her to get back in her car. At this point he gave her a ticket and told her to &quot;Get the hell outta here!&quot; The stupid part was he left the camera in his cruiser running.<br>
 <br>
Plexi-Glass<br>
Arkansas<br>
Seems this guy wanted some beer pretty badly. He decided that he'd just throw a cinder block through a liquor store window, grab some booze, and run. So he lifted the cinder block and heaved it over his head at the window. The cinder block bounced back and hit the would-be thief on the head, knocking him unconscious. Seems the liquor store window was made of Plexi-Glass. The whole event was caught on videotape.<br>
 <br>
Wrong Plug In<br>
Seattle, Washington<br>
When a man attempted to siphon gasoline form a motor home parked on a Seattle street, he got much more than he bargained for. Police arrived at the scene to find an ill man curled up next to a motor home near spilled sewage. A police spokesperson said that the man admitted to trying to steal gasoline and plugged his hose into the motor home's sewage tank by mistake. The owner of the vehicle declined to press charges, saying that it was the best laugh he'd ever had.<br>

Panty Hose<br>
Columbus, Georgia<br>
A guy was holding up a bank, he had pantyhose on his head as a disguise. The guy suffocated, and had to be taken to the hospital!<br>
 <br>
Bad punishment<br>
Unknown<br>
It seems that this genius decided to rob a bank - a BLOOD bank! (There must be a TON of cash there!) He cases the joint and figures that by breaking in on Friday night he would have all the time in the world because the place doesn't open up again until 8 or so Monday morning. Somehow he came up with the bright idea to climb down an airshaft from the roof to not invite unwanted attention. His operation began sometime Friday night and was going as planned until he lost his grip and slipped down the 20-foot vertical shaft and came to an abrupt stop in the office. With one leg on either side of an office partition which ended less than a foot below the opening of the shaft from which he was now dangling. Unable to go up or down he remained their 'til Monday where he was discovered. When they found him he was suffering from dehydration, delirious from pain, and his genitals were swollen to the size of grapefruits-each! After lowering him down they owner didn't press charges because he said nothing could be more punishment than that. <p><img src="http://www.madco911.com/users/uylee/Pasukun_sig2.jpg"><br>
