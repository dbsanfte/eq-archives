<br>
first pick from left to right. im sure you can also guess what chars these are on the second pic.<br>
<br>
Illanae= Kiyone: Age 23, Kiyone is Mihoshi's partner in the Galaxy Police.  She would be of high rank if it wasn't for Mihoshi's screwups.  She seems to be the most normal of the six girls living with Tenchi, and she is also the only one who shows no sign of romantic interests in the young Jurai prince.<br>
<br>
Storrme= Mihoshi: Some people thinks she's clumsy and obnoxious, but I think otherwise.  Sure she goofs up a lot, but I think her problem isn't that she is dumb, but she just doesn't pay attention to what is going on around her.  (I'm talking about the Mihoshi from OAV.)  As a first class detective in the galaxy police, she ended up with the Masaki household because of her ship being pulled to Earth by a demon Ryoko summoned in her battle at the onsen with Ayeka.  She developed a slight crush on Tenchi (of course) after he rescued her during her shipwreck. <br>
<br>
Mysch= Sasami: Sasami is the eight-year old second princess of Jurai and the sister of Ayeka.  She is the primary chef of the Masaki household, and a darn good one at that.  She is good friends with Ryo-ohki;  you always see her riding on top of Sasami's head.  In the OAV she often had dreams of what is to happen to Tenchi and the gang in the future.  In OAV ep. 9 it is revealed that her and the goddess Tsunami assimilated with her after Sasami nearly died from a long fall.  When Sasami grows up, she will become one with Tsunami, and they will look alike, too.  She even has her own spin-off series, Pretty Sammy, which is basically a spoof of Sailor Moon.  Many can argue if it wasn't for her young age, she would be perfect for Tenchi.<br>
<br>
Syrenn= Ryoko: Ryoko is probably my favorite anime character of all time.  She has a lot of powers, a great figure, and is just so cool!  Her appearance is often augmented by several cat- like qualities, such as her expression and her fake tail.  Ryoko would walk through hell and back for Tenchi, which proves she is the best candidate for Tenchi's main ho.  People think her weak point is her love of alcohol, but I think a particular Jurai princess has a worse problem than she does.  She isn't very modest, for she doesn't wear a towel in the onsen like the other girls, and she likes to teleport herself to the men's onsen to show her body off to Tenchi.  Her mom is the 2nd coolest character  in Tenchi Muyo, Washu.  Ryoko is confused about this because Kagato took away her memories of her childhood and Washu was sealed in a giant crystal for a real long time.  Ryoko finally opened up to her mom in &quot;Here Comes Jurai 2&quot; when Washu left her strapped up to a machine all night almost totally naked.  Washu videotaped it, of course<br>
<br>
cimerene= Ayeka: Ayeka is the 17 year- old first crown princess of Jurai.  Her name means &quot;frail&quot; in Japanese.  She was on her way across the universe in search of her half-brother and fiancée (ew) Yosho when she ended up coming to Earth when the sensors on her ship picked up Ryoko.  She ends up falling in love with Tenchi, of course.  Her good traits are she is fine, uh..  I can't really think of anything else to say.  Her bad traits include her being bossy, a prude, a drunk, sadistic, and arrogant.  I'm not saying I don't like Ayeka, but all of these bad traits are true.<br>
<br>
NOW second pic.<br>
<br>
Vual= Tenchi: Tenchi Masaki was just your average Japanese high school student until his curiosity got the best of him.  His grandpa always told him to stay away from the cave where a demon sleeps, but he wouldn't listen.  He accidentally released the demon that turned out to be the beautiful Ryoko.  That's when things started to get crazy.  All of a sudden a bunch of women move in with him.  He then finds out his grandpa is the lost prince of the planet Jurai, making him a crown prince as well.  He then has to battle an infamous space criminal!  In the battle he discovers he has the extraordinary ability to produce Light Hawk Wings, which is a defensive/ offensive mechanism that only Jurai battleships can produce.  He doesn't get that much say in alot of the events that surround him.  And nobody really knows what is going on in his head.  All we know he is sworn on his life to protect the women who love him.  And there is a bunch of them, too!  Ryoko, Washu, Ayeka, Mihoshi, and even Sasami have the hots for Tenchi in some degree.  The biggest question about Tenchi unquestionably has to be:  which girl will he pick?  In the 3rd movie, Tenchi Forever, it is kinda indirectly hinted which one he will chose, but you'll have to watch it yourself!  In the 3rd OAV series, which is in the works, he is supposed to directly choose one of the girls!<br>
<br>
Syrenn= Washu: Washu is probably my 2nd favorite character in Tenchi Muyo.  She also has my favorite dubbed voice (kudos to K.T. Vogt!)  You can say all of Tenchi Muyo OAV revolves around this hot little red head.  She is the creator of Ryoko and Ryo-ohki, the teacher of Kagato, the rival of Dr. Clay, and the sister of Tokimi.  As the self proclaimed greatest scientific genius of the universe, she is always after Tenchi so she can try to do strange erotic experiments in the &quot;name of science&quot; on Tenchi, which are always interrupted by Mihoshi or Sasami.  Tenchi doesn't seem to enjoy it too much, but he always ends up coming back down there for more.  After her husband, who was of high social class, left her and took away their child, she decided to live life as a child since adults are stupid like that.  That is why she insists that people call her Little Washu or Washu Chan for you subtitle watchers.  She is going to take a big role in the upcoming Tenchi 3rd OAV, for it is going to be revealed that she is a goddess and the sister of Tokimi.<br>
<br>
Archoon = RIO-OHKI (thats how its spelled. Yes RIO-OHKI is a female, she is a Cabit a cat/rabit mix created by Washu, &quot;owned&quot; by Ryoko, but loves Sasami over them all. Later she has the ability to become a very cute 5-7 year old little girl that can only meow, she still has the pointed ears. RIO-OHKI can also turn into a spaceship (hey its anime) with nice powers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#20354D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub141.ezboard.com/beverquestpeople.showUserPublicProfile?gid=myscheviousmiamore>Myschevious MiAmore</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.myschevious.net/yahiko.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><TABLE STYLE=filter:Glow(color=#FFFFCC, strength=4><font color=#663333> <b> Over-Opinionated Meanie</font></TABLE> </b></span><br>  Posts: 1092<br> <font color=#BBBFC5>(11/25/02 7:53:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/feverquestpeoplefrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1835.topic&index=589>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.myschevious.net/myschdoll.gif height=146 width=65></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: MY turn! bwaahaha</span><hr size=1> Actually Vual, the spellings are correct so long as they *sound* as they should.<br>

The most typical spelling for the cabbit is, however, Ryo-Ohki. R*y*o.<br>
<br>
There is however, no &quot;correct&quot; version as the Japanese language is based on phoenetics.<br>

Sorry Mysch, its just not &quot;based&quot; on phoenetics. There is a correct way of spelling everything in Japanese. Though the order does go consanent(sp?), vowel, consanent vowel, etc. etc. Two vowels CAN be next to each other, and the only time you'll see two consanents next to each other is words like <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>rya/u/o</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>hya/u/o</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, etc. and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>n</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is used. Something spelt with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>riho</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->- will mean an entirely different thing than something spelt with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>ryho</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->-. And usually ALL Japanese names, even for animes, have some sort of common word associated with it. Like <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kakarot</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in DBZ means Goku's Saiyan name, but in Japanese, that means <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>carrot</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Not like American names such as <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Mike</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> or <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Joe</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> which have no real meaning in the American language besides being just names.<br>
<br>
I'm still only a beginner, but do know enough. I'll try and see if I can get the exact spelling. Look up the Japanese subtitles from the original OVA Japanese version. That will help. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://jens-smileys.netfirms.com/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Most places that sell something Tenchi related will spell it that way.  It's a silly argument, but I do like to know how things came to be a certain way.<br>
<br>
I've read a few different things that say Japanese is a phonetic language, but I think that only fits sometimes.  It seems like there are rules regarding the spelling of words which actually exist in the japanese language and can be constructed in Kanji (a symbol  equates to something like a syllable, based on what Arc said).  <br>
<br>
There are words which were not native to the Japanese language or some names which seem to rely more on sounding the word out than writing it one way all the time.  A good example of this phonetic trait of the language is the word rakuun, which is what a few of us found to be a generally acceptable Japanese word for racoon.  Not being a species native to Japan, the racoon doesn't technically have a real japanese name, so it seems like the language just adopted a Japanese spelling (which also is spelled much like the word is pronounced) of an english word.<br>
<br>
A different example of words which don't rely on an exact spelling everytime are some names.  Kakarot is a good example of a name with a meaning and therefore an accepted standard spelling.  His buddy Krillin is another matter.  Talk about a character with umpteen spellings of his name; Krillin, Kuririn, Klilyn.  It seems to happen most often when names have R or L in them in a specific placement because the R and L sound is basically the same.  <br>
<br>
The sum of it seems to be the difference between traditional words and how they are constructed, and words borrowed from other languages.  I found a <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.animenation.net/news/askjohn.php?id=136">brief article</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> that explains the phonetic part, but is by no means a smoking gun to the issue.  I'd guess that the language will work on whatever level or practice the user wishes to utilize.  I doubt any teacher who wishes to stay sane would want to teach Japanese in a fully phonetic way.

Hiragana is the traditional way of &quot;spelling&quot; and pronouncing Japanese words. Then there is Katakana. Basically the same way of pronouncing as Hiragana, but written differently. The symbol for each sound is different. You use Katakana when using words that are &quot;Americanized.&quot; But then there is Kanji too..which is the symbol symbol stuff. And that gets confusing cause one kanji can have like 5 different meanings, depending on how it is used in a sentence.<br>
