My landlord and another 1 bedroom on the first floor, a one bedroom on the second floor, and my wife and I live on the 3rd and 4th story apartment with our daughter. <br>
<br>
The woman on the second floor has been our neighbor for like 6 years now. We lived in the first floor apartment for the first 3 years, and we've been upstairs for the last 3 and a half. She's always been a little odd, but it's gotten worse lately. <br>
<br>
I forgive a lot of the strangeness, because I suspect she's manic or bipolar, and I suspect she's medicated, at least part of the time. And she's always very, very nice when things are going well in her head. Lately, though, she's been odd to the point of me becoming very concerned about her.<br>
<br>
She slams her apartment door so loud that it shakes the house. She used to grind up....stuff....in her garbage disposal at like 2 am that would make the floor shake. I can't imagine what she was trying to grind up, but my wife and I would joke that she was grinding up &quot;the bodies&quot;. Think about the woodchipper scene in Fargo, and you get the picture. She's meek and mild-mannered, and she looks just like everyone else...which is where the serial killer joke started, I guess.<br>
<br>
We forgive the quirks, because we have a daughter who runs around the house over her head, and screams at odd hours, and probably makes just as much noise as the neighbor downstairs.<br>
<br>
But lately...her house has been getting dirtier. She leaves her door open at times, and the front hallway is a wreck. Dirty laundry, trash, stuff like that. She sometimes goes out of the house wearing a housecoat, with her overcoat over it. Someone in chat yesterday said that they'll run out to start their car like that, but this woman *shops* in the middle of Philly like that.<br>
<br>
She's a lawyer, and does some teaching, but she's been having trouble paying bills (the electric company rings our buzzer when she's not home, and is way too inappropriate about telling us why they're there). She's occassionally very spacey, like she's not really present in a conversation.<br>
<br>
All this didn't add up to anything in my head other than quirks and difficulties that all of us have to deal with on some level throughout our own lives. We've all got our demons, right? Like I said, when she's doing well, she's very &quot;normal&quot;, and seems to be getting things back together.<br>
<br>
Last night, though, my buzzer rang. It was her, and I could hardly hear her over the intercom. She just said to come down and let her in, please. She forgets her keys about once a month, so this isn't anything new.<br>
<br>
I gathered up my daughter and went downstairs, and she was standing there with a woman I've never seen. My neighbor looked like a wreck, and the other woman said she found her in a parking garage around the corner, and there was no way to get in the garage without a key. She didn't know how she had gotten in there, but apparently she had fallen. <br>
<br>
I didn't know what to think. I thanked the woman, and asked my neighbor if she was OK...she said she wasn't. I mean, that was obvious, but I was a little shocked. I asked her if I should call for an ambulance, or 911, but I couldn't see any injuries. She seemed drunk to me. Stumbling, not making any sense. She mumbled that she was an executor for a will, and nodded at me like that would explain everything. When I told her I didn't understand, she said that my landlord knew all about it. <br>
<br>
I followed her up to her apartment, and she was very unsteady, which is what made me think she was drunk. She stumbled a few times, and was weaving. I asked her again if there was anyone I could call to get her some help, and she said she was fine now. I told her to call me, or call the landlord, if she needed anything, and she went inside.<br>
<br>
I called my landlord when I got upstairs, because I was concerned, and because she said he knew about &quot;it&quot;. I told him what had happened, and he said he would call her in a little bit to check in on her. He said she had been very spacey a few days before, and had rambled on to him about being an executor for a will for about 20 minutes, without really making any sense. I told him I thought she was either drunk or drugged, and he didn't know what to make of that. <br>
<br>
He said she had told him two very disturbing things. First, she said her nearest relatives were in a certain town in upstate NY, and second, that he could come into her apartment at any time. To me, that sounded like a cry for help, or a warning that she was going to hurt herself. My wife is going to try to reach her relatives today, and I'm going to check with the landlord when I get home, to see if he got in touch with her. She was just odd before, but now I'm concerned that she can't take care of herself. She's only around 50, but it seems like there's a mental illness that's really kicking her ass right now. Maybe she's off her medication? I don't know enough about mental illness to attempt a diagnosis, but it's freaky. <br>
<br>
There's a fine line between minding your own business, and reaching out to try to get someone some help. I'm not sure calling the police would do any good. The story I posted about the guy setting the fire, and jumping out of the window, says the cops had been there many times, and nothing was really done. I think we need to get in touch with her family, and have a contact there if things get worse. Someone should know what's going on with her.<br>
<br>
I know this is a ramble, but I'm trying to figure out the best thing to do for her, without invading her privacy, ya know? In theory, it's none of my business, but as a human, I don't want to see someone else struggling, either, especially someone I've known, even just peripherally, for 6 years. <br>

They were very thankful that someone called, because she's got a history of being unstable, I guess. They didn't give us any details about it, but they were relieved to have someone give them some information about how she's doing.<br>
<br>
Her sister is coming down this weekend to check things out, so maybe my neighbor will get some help. I'm a little concerned that she'll be upset that we called, but I'd rather have her be upset and taken care of. The alternative would be tough to live with. <br>
<br>
Thanks for the feedback. It's an odd feeling to jump into someone's life like this. I was worried that the family might have been estranged and not open to a phone call, but it didn't turn out that way at all. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Gallatin</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

You'd be surprised at how early dementia and Alzheimer's can set in.  there were many younger people that I had to take care of like babies... Younger as in 50 or so.  It kind of sounds like reality may be taking a walk for this woman and she doesn't know where she is anymore. <p><img src=http://sigs-by-sy.netfirms.com/luka-new.jpg>

Bipolar disorder runs in my mothers side of the family, sometimes the family is hoping someone will &quot;butt in&quot;because they have  lost contact <br>
