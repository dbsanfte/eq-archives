<center><b><i><h4>Surrender the Darkness</i></b></h4></center><br>
<br>
<center>Chapter One</center><br>
<br>
<br>
The light reflected off the sword as it swung downwards, I couldn’t turn my eyes away as I looked up from my fallen position on the ground.  The horror of what I was seeing froze me to one spot.  I might have been able to crawl away unnoticed; instead I was laying here, my eyes wide watching the sword as it came closer.  Time seemed to be slowed in that instant, and I felt as if I was looking at the events from outside of my body.  I had to force the scream that was in my mind to my voice….<br>
<br>
The sound of the sword slicing through flesh sickened me, my stomach turning as I watched.  I finally closed my eyes, gagging; I covered my mouth with my hand.  I could hear a woman’s scream cut off by another sound of a slashing sword.  I was barely able to lift up my head as I retched upon the ground.  My insides felt as if they were tying their selves into knots.  Laughter flooded my ears as I felt a hand yank me by my hair and drag me across the dirt ground.<br>
<br>
“Stand up wench!” He grunted, commanding me.  I opened my eyes and looked up at the men, their armor covered in the blood of my village.  I slowly stood, my legs shaking.  My eyes take in the slaughter before me, friends, family, and even children.  A scream escapes my mouth as I look at the decapitated heads of my parents.  Their glassy eyes staring up, horror frozen on their faces, my parents, they were my only family now dead.  Unable to handle the gore I retch down the front of my dress, holding onto the stable fence besides me for support.  Once again the laughter of the men filled my ears, why did they laugh?  What did they want with me, why was I spared?<br>
<br>
“You will serve us.” The bigger one said, answering my silent questions.  His voice was thick with accent, I knew now that they were not from our land. I looked around and noticed a few more girls were also alive.  I recognized them, I schooled with them, Jala, Lilac, and Diana.  <br>
<br>
“Hail!”  A man shouted, his voice also accented like the others.  He rode up to us on a sleek black stallion, the horse wore armor as well.  He did not remove his helmet, and he did not step down from the horse.  I could not take my eyes off of him, though I knew he was one of the enemies, I saw him as magnificent.  The wonder of a man who was not like my kind, my eyes could not move from him.<br>
<br>
“Donovan,” He gestured to the big man, “What do you have for me?”<br>
<br>
Donovan kneeled to the ground, his speech to the Armored Man now in a tongue I do not know.  He pointed to Diana, the farthest girl from me, then to Lilac, Jala, and finally me.  Speaking words I could not understand, the Armored Man pointed at me and yelled something at Donovan.  Donovan nodded, he and another picked through the wreck of the village.  The smallest man, approached me, he handed me a clean dress and slightly smiled.  Then Donovan returned with a wash bucket, filled to the rim with water.<br>
<br>
My eyes darted back and forth, not sure of what I should do. I knew they wanted me to clean and dress, but…did they want me to do it in front of them?  The smallest man, nodded towards the inside of the stable fence, and motioned for me to wash in there.  I could feel the relief wash over my face as I quickly did as I was told.  The cool clean water taking me away for just a moment, then all that was going on rushed back to me and I hurriedly finished and pulled on the cleaner dress.  I stood there for a moment, my mind racing.  If I ran to the back of the stable and found my way out would I be free?  Glancing around, I noticed there was no way out except for the way in, I was defeated already.  So I returned to the men and nodded my thanks to the Armored Man.  My fascination with him was over whelming, my eyes continued to look upon him.  It was then that he spoke again, this time in the common tongue.  <br>
<br>
“Get the wagon, put them in…and be careful with them.”  His head turned towards me, I quickly looked down.  “Her, the sick one, make sure she is comfortable. “  In a flash he was gone, his stallion disappearing over the hill.  His men quickly gathered us up, but not before they tied our hands together.  It was difficult to climb into the back of the wagon without our hands, so they lifted us up.  <br>
<br>
The smallest one, who I now call the Nice One, handed me a blanket to sit upon.  His smile just as kind as it was before, it seemed as if his soul was different from the others.  I couldn’t understand how a man that was so kind to me could have help slaughter the people of my village.  The whole situation was one that I could not make sense of in my mind and I am sure for a long time I wouldn’t be able too.  None of us; the girls, spoke a single word during the ride.  We rode through the day until sunset, and then we would camp for the night.  I have counted a total of twelve days, of being in the back of this wagon.  Everyone silent except for the men who spoke in their native tongue, whatever that may be….<br>
I could tell the others wanted to speak, but out of fear they stayed silent.  After watching them intently, I decided to speak.  My throat dry, from days of not speaking, I barely could croak the words at first.  “Are you…ok?”  I asked concern on my face for the other girls my age.<br>
<br>
Diana looked up, her hands working the hem of her dress.  Her dark eyes were wild, and it seemed, she was not there though she was.  She glanced up at the men, who didn’t seem to notice I had spoken.  Then her eyes darted back to me, she lifted a hand to her face, “Momma says I need to wash.” <br>
<br>
Sadness touched me, as I realized Diana was not the same as before.  Her mind did not comprehend where she was. I nodded and smiled as best as I could, “Yes; I heard, we will do that when we get to where we are going.” I said softly.<br>
<br>
A smile brightened her face, “Yes we will, when we get there, yes.”<br>
<br>
Lilac began to cry; I crawled over to her and held her in my arms.  Her hands clutched at my dress; as if she was afraid I’d leave.  I wouldn’t though; I could not leave them alone, not that I could have left regardless.  Jala just lay with her head against the wagon wall, her face was ashned.  She had not moved for hours, and her skin was gray.  My brow creased, and I shouted at the men, “We need help back here!”<br>
<br>
The wagon slowed to a stop and Donovan looked down from where he sat, “What wench?”<br>
<br>
I gestured towards Jala,” I think she’s sick; she is pale, hasn’t moved for hours.”<br>
<br>
The Nice One climbed in the back to examine her, he quickly loosened the collar on Jala’s dress.  “She isn’t breathing, cold to touch.” He muttered as he undid the buttons down the front.  I watched as he placed his ear on her naked chest…then he slowly rose up.  He licked his lips and glanced at me, then at Donovan.  “She’s dead, her heart stopped.”<br>
<br>
Tears rose to my eyes as I watched him button her dress back up.  Donovan climbed down, “We’ll drop her here.”<br>
<br>
“No!” I shouted, surprising them as well as myself.  I looked away quickly, then decided it didn’t matter what I do, I may die just like Jala.  Breathing in I turned back to them, “She comes with us.”<br>
<br>
“We drop her here.” He grunted again, starting to pick her up.<br>
<br>
I stood my ground, my voice becoming firm, “She comes with us.”<br>
<br>
“It is best if we leave her, you do not want to travel with a decaying corpse.” The Nice One tried to intervene.<br>
<br>
“How long until we arrive to where ever we are being dragged too?” I spat, feeling the heat of my new found anger.<br>
<br>
“Just a day, maybe two.” He answered glancing from me to Donovan.<br>
<br>
“She comes with us, and when we get there, I will bury her.” My jaw tightened, a strange feeling rising up in me.  I had never spoken to someone the way I was speaking to these men.  I scooted away from Lilac and over to Jala.  Taking the hem of her dress in my hands I rip a large piece of cloth away.  I threw it to Donovan, “Tie this over her face; her spirit shouldn’t have to look upon the men who killed her. Take her hand ties off; she will not be going any where now.”<br>
<br>
He raised an eyebrow, not too happy apparently that he was being ordered by a captive girl.  He began to approach me, the rims of his eyes red; I knew then he would kill me.  I sat there though, not screaming, not caring.  Just as he got to me his big hand swung out knocking me to the other side of the wagon.  I heard the Nice One shout at him, but I couldn’t understand what he was saying.  A ringing pounded my ears; I lifted my head, to try to look at them.  I could not see them, only blackness; the wagon began to move again.  I slumped back down and let the blackness embrace me.<br>

I blinked and grimace at the headache I now had, “Where?”  I muttered.<br>
<br>
“Hold still, you were hit hard.”  A woman spoke; she carried the same accent as the others.  “Blast that Donovan, the brute.” She growled.<br>
Again the cool cloth caressed my swollen face,” I can’t see.”  I blinked again wincing from the pain.<br>
<br>
Her hand came to my forehead, “You have a fever, and the hit you took was hard.  It may be a few days before you can see again.”<br>
<br>
“No,” I started to sit up but strong hands held me down, “I have to bury Jala.”  I cried, trying to get up again.<br>
<br>
“How do you intend on burying a corpse when you are blind?”<br>
<br>
I stopped struggling, and laid back, my hands searched for the ones holding me.  I grabbed them and pleaded, “Please, her spirit must be laid to rest!”<br>
<br>
I felt another set of hands on me, and realized the woman was not the only one in the room.  Again she patted my face with the cloth, “Your friend is being buried, we heard of your stand against Donovan.  It takes a brave girl to do what you did; Donovan himself was made to dig the hole for her.”<br>
<br>
“What about Diana? She…her mind is not there.”<br>
<br>
The woman cleared her throat, “The day you were brought here, she hung…she is no longer in this world.”<br>
<br>
“Lilac?” I was afraid to ask, my eyes searching for the light I could not see.<br>
<br>
The washcloth wiped my face again, “Lilac, is well.”  The woman said softly, “She has not eaten though and she is becoming weak.”<br>
<br>
I jumped up from the bed, stumbling over a near by table,” Why were we brought here!” I screamed my hands out trying to grasp anything that seemed to be an exit.  “Why if all we are going to do is die?”  I fell, and rose back up, “I could hear someone near, so I turned quickly away, dodging him. A breeze fluttered through the air, and I knew that was my way out.  I ran towards where it came from.  Instantly, I could feel the sun’s rays on me, as I ran blindly from the place I had been.<br>
<br>
Shouts started among men, and I could hear horses galloping towards me.  “Eyes please, I need you now!”  I cried to myself.  Yet nothing happened, only darkness, no light.  I stumbled over something and fell to the ground, crawling I continued away from the noise I was hearing behind me.  Then it was over, a hand had hold of my hair, “Please just kill me, so I may die like the others.”<br>
<br>
“Gladly.” Donovan’s voice snarled, as he lifted me to my feet by my hair.  I cried out as he dragged me back to where I had first fallen.  It was then I could smell it, the stench of a decaying body in the heat.  I had tripped over Jala, as Donovan was getting ready to place her in the grave.  I felt myself fall again, this time hitting a dirt floor hard.  I was in the grave; I was in Jala’s grave!  He would bury me alive!  “I shall finish what I started!”<br>
<br>
“No!” I shouted as I felt dirt drop on top of my head.  Then I heard a thump as Jala hit the bottom near me.  Donovan’s familiar laughter came from above as more and more dirt pored down on me.  I crouched against the wall, my arms over my head as the dirt kept coming down.  He was going to bury me alive, and I would slowly die without air, panic set in and I began screaming.<br>
<br>
“Donovan!” It was the Armored Man speaking; I could hear the rattle of his chain mail boots above me.  “Get her out of there now!”  He shouted.<br>
<br>
It took a few minutes before I felt hands on me, “Get up on the ladder wench.”  He pushed me over to a wooden ladder roughly.  My hands searched for the rungs as I tried to step up, “Hurry!”  He growled jerking me.<br>
<br>
I nodded and almost tripped trying to get to the top of the ladder.  Strong arms reached out to me and helped me off as I got to the top.  I collapsed in them, too tired to run any longer.  The arms picked me up; I laid my head upon the chest as I was carried away.  Once back in the Tent I was placed in a tub of water, dress and all, a washcloth was stuffed into my hand.  I just sat there, not washing, not moving I could not find the strength to get my arms to work.  Tears slowly fell down my cheeks until I was sobbing….  <br>
<br>
A hand patted my head and I felt the person help me out of my dress.  They took the cloth and began to wash me, because I had no will to do it on my own.  Water was ran over me; washing the dirt from my hair, and then a hand helped me up from the tub.  I was led over to a chair, where a new dress was pulled over me, my arms pulled into the sleeves and then fingers buttoned me up.  After sitting, someone began to comb out the tangles in my wet hair.  “You should not have run.” The woman’s voice spoke up.  <br>
<br>
“You only get yourself in trouble.”  The comb stopped, and I was lead to a bed lined with furs.  Whispers came from the doorway, then a felt the hand on my forehead.  “You still have fever, you must rest!”  She said.<br>
<br>
“Who are you?” I asked turning on my side.<br>
<br>
“I am Savarna; I will be your helper until you get better.”<br>
<br>
“I don’t want your help.”<br>
<br>
“A blind girl not wanting help?” She laughed, and sat on the side of the bed.  “This is my tent, you stay here for now.” She softly caressed my cheek; I let her fingers linger for a moment before turning my face away.<br>
<br>
“I may be blind but I still was able to run.” I said.<br>
<br>
“True and you dodged the guard rather well too.  How did you know he was there?”  I didn’t answer her; I closed my eyes and prayed for help.<br>

I was brought stew and some bread to eat, but it was brought so often I could not tell how many days I had been there.  No light touched my eyes yet, and the darkness was lonely, sometimes I would just lie on the bed crying.  I was asked my name many times, but I never answered them.  Usually I only spoke to Savarna, her questions constant about my life, my name and so on.  I did not want to give her any information about me.  I may have been their captive, but I would never let them know me.  It did not take long however before I was able to tell night from day.  Savarna would bathe me every other night, and wash my hair with the sweet smelling berries she used on her own.  It was different from the first bath, this time she told stories, and repeated legends I had grown up on.  Only once I was asked my true age, this I did answer, I told her I was fourteen summers.  Which surprised her, she said I looked much older, I did not know whether that was good or not.  She was much older then me, but I do not think she was as old as my mother.  Sometimes it was hard to understand just how kind she was, and why she took the time to care for me. <br>
<br>
One night after a bath and she had put me to bed I was startled as I heard someone enter the tent; I sat up and glanced around in my darkened eyes.  “Where is Savarna?”  I asked, knowing the sound was not of her.<br>
<br>
“Very good, you knew I was not her automatically.” The Armored Man took a seat at the table near my bed.  “I came to look upon you and see how you are fairing.”<br>
<br>
After being among this village for some time I began to recognize how they spoke.  They said many things different from the way my people did.  I turned my head away, “I am a captive.”  I said bitterly.<br>
<br>
“You are not; you are free in this village.”<br>
<br>
“In this village, but not outside it, why was I brought here?”  I turned my face in the direction his voice came from.<br>
<br>
I could hear the sound of his armor as he leaned on the table,” To serve at first, but you intrigue me.”<br>
<br>
“I’m sure every young girl intrigues you.” I said bitterly.<br>
<br>
He chuckled, “Not all of them, but yes many are beautiful.”<br>
<br>
“So what do you do to us that are not beautiful? Make us slaves?”<br>
<br>
The Armored Man leaned back in his chair; I could feel the tension change in the room.  “I did not say you were one who wasn’t.”<br>
<br>
I laughed and laid back on my bed, “Now you are a lair as well as a killer.”  I shook my head.  I turned my eyes towards the door, my eyebrows raised, “Are you afraid I’ll run again?”<br>
<br>
“Why would you think that?”  He asked curiosity in his voice.<br>
<br>
“You have guards at the door, which could only be the reason.”<br>
<br>
“You amaze me child, how did you know they were there?”<br>
<br>
I raised an eyebrow, “I could smell the stink of their sweat.”  <br>
<br>
Again he laughed,” Fourteen summers old and very intelligent, strong as well.”<br>
<br>
“Amuse you do I?”  I propped my elbow up and laid my head in my hand.<br>
<br>
“What is your name?” His voice turned soft, loosing the commanding sound of it.<br>
<br>
“What is your name?” I asked back, not letting him be in control of what I frequently called ‘The Question Game’.<br>
<br>
I heard him stand and come closer to me,” My name is Stravo.” I felt the bed shift weight as he sat on the edge.  I could feel his knee near my left leg….<br>
<br>
“Stravo,” I repeated out loud, “You are Savarna's brother?”<br>
<br>
“Aye,” He said,” We both were born in the same day.”<br>
<br>
“Twins....” I spoke softly, sitting up again.  I turned to be face to face with him, “I had no family other then my parents.  Who your men murdered!” I spat at him.<br>
<br>
He sighed and stood up, “One day I shall know your name, and it is then you can become one of my village.”<br>
<br>
“I’d rather be dropped in the hole with Jala again before I become one of you!”  I listened as he walked out of the tent.  Then I lay back down and closed my eyes, would I ever get out of here? I covered my head with my arms and lay there drifting off to sleep.<br>
<br>

Without being able to see, my senses had become stronger and I reviled in the fact that I could hear and smell all that was around me.  I could pick out a person just by the sound of the way they walked, and Savarna I knew by the smell of her hair, it always smelt of the sweet berries.<br>
<br>
Days passed on and on, then getting up my courage, I decided to leave the tent.  I knew I could walk around the village easily by the smells and sounds.  It was a warm day a small breeze fluttered through the tent walls as I made my way out.  I could hear the guards outside my tent speaking to each other as I passed them.  I stood there for a moment, waiting for a sound or smell that told me where to go next, and no one seemed to pay attention to the poor blind captive.  I had been expected to be seized immediately as I left the Tent.  The breeze fluttered through my hair again and I smelt flowers, wild flowers.  A smile came to my face and I followed the scent to what seemed to be an open space.  I crouch to my knees and reached out to touch them, soft petals brushed my arms and hands.  A giggle of delight escaped me as I sat upon the ground, breathing in the aroma.  I picked a few and fingered them, trying to recognize what they were.  The smells were so mixed together; that my nose could not pick each one out separately.  <br>
<br>
I adored flowers, and I spent hours back at my village out in the fields picking bouquet after bouquet then returning home and showering my mother with them.  She was well knowledge in the study of plants, and kept many for herbs, drying them out by hanging them from the ceiling.  I sighed and fought back the tears that wanted to flood down my cheeks at the memories.  I would never see my family again.  My village was gone, my people were destroyed and I was the only one left.  A girl who knew nothing of the world around her and now would never know due to being in complete darkness.<br>
<br>
I breathed in the scent of the flowers once more and then let myself smile.  Feeling for the ends of each stem I began tying them together like I did as a child.  I’m not sure how long I had been sitting there; I could feel a change in the sun’s course.  I straightened the wreath of flowers on my head and pulled on the long necklace I had just made.  <br>
<br>
Light laughter came from behind me; I turned quickly towards the sound, “Who’s there?”  My eyes darted back and forth, unable to see beyond the blackness in front of them.<br>
<br>
“Looks like you are having a bit of fun eh?” The male voice said as he crouched near me.  Then I felt the ruffle of the flower necklace as he touched it.  “You are a ways from the village; did you not see how far you have walked?”<br>
<br>
“I see nothing.” I said bitterly and turned my face away.  “What do you want?”<br>
<br>
“I was going for a walk.”  I heard him stand back up, “I never expected you to be out here, but the field is beautiful.  I really do not see many venture out this way, maybe people are too busy to sit and relax in the sun.”  His voice faded off as if he was lost in thought.<br>
<br>
I stood and turned in a circle trying to catch a smell or sound of the village, I had never noticed that I could not sense them before.  I must have been far from it, I turned towards the man, “Can…can you lead me back?”<br>
<br>
“Aye that I can do.”  He started to walk; I followed his footsteps, listening for any indication of sound.  Finally I could hear the village, bustling about with its smells and sounds.  I felt a hand on my arm stopping me, “Why is it you needed me to show you the way back if you already knew?  I have had to catch up with you for the last half mile.”<br>
<br>
I stumbled over my words, “I was not sure of the way, but thank you for helping me this far.”  I hurried my pace not sure what to say to the man, apparently he did not know of my blindness.  All of a sudden I fell over a table, which I did not realize was there, I could hear Savarna calling to me.  I reached out for anything that could help me get back up, but nothing was found.  The table turned over on top of me, I tried to slide it off, but I could not get out from under it.  <br>
<br>
“Girl,” Savarna crouched near me, “What were you doing out there, were you running again?”<br>
<br>
“No, I was not running I was…”<br>
<br>
“Making Wild Flower necklaces,” the man spoke up, the sound as if he was grinning, “Quiet lovely ones at that.”<br>
<br>
I slightly blushed, “Please, someone get this off of me so that I may stand.”  I reached out for anyone who might be near.  I felt Savarna’s hand on mine, so I pushed my self up as she pulled.  “Thank you.” I lowered my head, slightly embarrassed of my fall.<br>
<br>
“You were picking flowers?” How did you get out there?”<br>
<br>
“I…I walked,” I stutterd, "The breeze was strong and I could smell the flowers from the village; I wanted to get out of the Tent.”<br>
<br>
Savarna’s hand came to my cheek, “You left the Tent by yourself? Without the help of anyone?”  She questioned, I nodded, I heard her cry out,” It is a blessing child!”<br>
<br>
“A blessing? How do you call going for a walk a blessing?”  The male voice spoke up again he sounded puzzled.<br>
<br>
“Do you not see?” She asked<br>
<br>
“See what?”<br>
<br>
“Darius, the girl is blind.” Savarna said softly.<br>
<br>
There was an awkward silence for a moment, “That is why you could not find your own way back until we came closer to the village.” He said astonished.<br>
<br>
I nodded and rubbed my hands on my dress, “May I go back to my Tent now?”  I felt as if I would cry, for once someone treated me as if I could see, and now the moment was gone.  I waited for the answer but none came, “May I?”<br>
<br>
Savarna’s strong voice came, “You walk back alone, you know the way.”<br>
<br>
“No I do not, I only followed the smells and sounds out of the tent.  I can not make it back by myself.”<br>
<br>
“You walk back alone!” She said.<br>
<br>
I reached out for her arm, “Please, I can not.”<br>
<br>
I felt a strong hand wrap around mine, “I will show you back, but you must remember the way.” The man named Darius spoke up.<br>
<br>
“I shall.” I said timidly.  His hand was warm, and I could feel the roughness of a working man’s hand.  I breathed in his scent; it was not of sweat, but a manly scent of some kind, mixed with the smell of wood.  He did not smell like the other men at the village, he must have been a visitor of Savarna’s.  As he led me back, he relayed to me, what was around me, so I would know next time.  I listened closely, not wanting to forget just incase I wanted to go somewhere else.<br>
<br>
When we got back to the tent he stopped at the doorway, “How do you come to the village?”<br>
<br>
I looked up at where I thought his face to be, “The men slaughtered my village, murdered my parents and captured four girls to whom I am the only one left alive.”  I said plainly, then walked over to my bed and sat down.  Again there was silence, but I knew he had not moved from the door.  “Is there something else you wish to ask?”<br>
<br>
“Oh, I’m sorry, I was lost in thought.  I did not think you would know I was still here.”<br>
<br>
“Of course I knew I could still smell you.” I laid back and propped my elbow up laying my head in my hand.  I could still smell him on my hand and I closed my eyes breathing in deeply.<br>
<br>
I could hear him stifle a laugh, “Do I smell that bad?”<br>
<br>
I smiled and explained to him, "No, you do not; I just know your scent.  When you are blind, and you have been this way for a long time, your senses become sharper.  You can hear things that you never heard before and you can smell things.  The flow of the air changing might mean that someone is blocking the way to the tent door.  I have become use to counting on my senses, since all I see is darkness.”<br>
<br>
He walked over close to me and sat in a chair, “Have you always been blind?” his voice held a sound of curiosity.<br>
<br>
I turned my eyes from his direction, “No, I could see the sun rise and the sun set.  I could see the beauty of my village and its people.  I can still see it, all because my mind memorized it.”  <br>
<br>
It sounded as if he started to ask another question so I answered it for him, “Tied into the back of the wagon, after we had been captured.  I noticed that one of the girls looked very sick, so I hollered for Donovan and the other smaller man to stop the wagon.” I took a deep breath and laid back, my eyes watering, “She was dead, her heart had stopped, and Donovan said he was going to drop her there.  I shouted at him, I really shouted at him telling him that he would do no such thing.  I was told it was only 2 days before we came to this village.  So I told him she would stay with us, and when we would have gotten here, I would bury her.”<br>
<br>
“Go on,” His voice was soft, as if he cared about what I would say.  I heard him lean forward, the leather pants he wore creaked, “I am listening.”<br>
<br>
“Donovan, he came at me and hit me hard.  Throwing my body across the wagon I hit my head on the wagon wall, after that I could not see.  I passed out and did not wake until after we were here.  I was still blind.”  I said sourly.  I could feel a tear roll down my cheek; I wiped at it and turned onto my side.  “Leave now, I wish to be alone.”  I listened as his footsteps faded away from my tent, and then I began to cry…<br>
