Father Larry is in the confession booth one day when he has to go to the bathroom. He calls over to the janitor. Jim, the janitor, comes over and Father Larry explains that he has to go to the bathroom and wants Jim to take over in the confession booth for him. Jim says he isn't even Catholic and doesn't think it would be appropriate for him to take over, but Father Larry insists and explains to Jim that if somebody enters the booth he should just look up the punishment in the book on the table. Jim agrees and sits down in the booth. The first sinner comes in and says, &quot;Father, please forgive me, I have sinned. I have had anal sex.&quot; Jim, feeling very comfortable goes over to the book and looks up anal sex, but can't find anything. Jim peeks through the curtain of the confessional and seen an altar boy lighting a candle. &quot;Psst,&quot; says Jim, &quot;What does Father Larry give for anal sex?&quot; &quot;As of last week,&quot; the altar boy says, &quot;two lollipops and a soda.&quot; <br>
<br>
I'LL TAKE YOU<br>
The little boy told his mother he wanted to pee. &quot;I'll take you to the bathroom,&quot; she replied. &quot;No,&quot; the boy said, &quot;I want Grandma to take me.&quot; &quot;Why do you want Grandma instead of me?&quot; the mother asked. &quot;Because her hand shakes&quot;<br>
<br>
HORSE AND CHICKEN<br>
A horse and a chicken are playing in a meadow. The horse falls into a mud hole and is sinking. He calls to the chicken to go and get the farmer to help pull him out to safety. The chicken runs to the farm but the farmer can't be found. So he drives the farmer's Mercedes back to the mud hole and ties some rope around the bumper. He then throws the other end of the rope to his friend, the horse, and drives the car forward saving him from sinking. A few days later, the chicken and horse are playing in the meadow again and the chicken falls into the mud hole. The chicken yells to the horse to go and get some help from the farmer. The horse says, &quot;I think I can stand over the hole!&quot; So he stretches himself over the width of the hole and says, &quot;Grab for my, uh, organ, and pull yourself up!&quot; The chicken did, and pulled himself to safety. The moral of the story-if you are hung like a horse, you don't need a Mercedes to pick up a chick<br>

GOOD QUESTION<br>
If you jog in a jogging suit, lounge in lounging pajamas and smoke in a smoking jacket‹why would anyone want to wear a windbreaker? <br>
<br>
AH-HA!<br>
A midget complained to his doctor that his testicles ached all the time. The physician told the midget to drop his pants. The doctor then lifted him up onto the table to take a look. Putting one finger under the left testicle, the doctor had the midget cough. The midget coughed. Then, putting his finger under the right testicle, the doctor asked the midget to cough again, which he did. &quot;Ah-ha!&quot; said the doctor, as he reached for his surgical scissors. He snipped on the right side, then on the left. The doctor then told the midget to pull up his pants and see if he still ached. The midget was delighted with the result. He walked around the doc's office and his testicles did not ache. &quot;What did you do, Doc?&quot; he asked. The doctor replied, &quot;I cut two inches off the top of your cowboy boots.&quot; <br>

MOST POWERFUL<br>
Little Johnny was sitting one day on a dock. Along came a preacher who sat down beside him. Little Johnny had a mason jar full of what looked like water and he was turning it over and over, watching the bubbles float through it. The preacher asked, &quot;What are you doing with that water?&quot; Little Johnny studied the contents of the jar for a moment, then explained, &quot;Preacher, this here is turpentine. It's the strongest liquid in the world.&quot; The preacher replied, &quot;Son, holy water is the strongest liquid in the world. Did you know if you rub a little Holy water on a pregnant woman's belly, she will give birth to a baby boy?&quot; Little Johnny thought about this one for a minute, and then remarked, &quot;Nope, this here turpentine is still the strongest liquid, because if you rub it on a cat's ass, it can pass a speeding car!&quot; <br>
<br>
BIG DIFFERENCE<br>

NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE<br>
A middle-aged woman had a heart attack and was taken to the hospital. While on the operating table, she had a near death experience. Seeing God, she asked, &quot;Is my time up?&quot; God said, &quot;No, you have another 43 years, two months and eight days to live.&quot; Upon recovery, the woman decided to stay in the hospital and have a facelift, liposuction and tummy tuck. Since she had so much more time to live, she figured she might as well look even nicer. After her last operation, she was released from the hospital. While crossing the street on her way home, she was killed by an ambulance. Arriving in front of God, she demanded, &quot;I thought you said I had another 40 years? Why didn't pull me out of the path of that ambulance?&quot; God replied, &quot;I didn't recognize you.&quot; <br>
<br>
TWO ATOMS<br>

CLOSE SHAVE<br>
A man enters a barbershop for a shave. While the barber is foaming him up, he mentions the problems he has getting a close shave around the cheeks. &quot;I have just the thing,&quot; says the barber taking a small wooden ball from a nearby drawer. &quot;Just place this between your cheek and gum.&quot; The client places the ball in his mouth and the barber proceeds with the closest shave the man has ever experienced. After a few strokes, the client asks in garbled speech, &quot;And what if I swallow it?&quot; &quot;No problem,&quot; says the barber. &quot;Just bring it back tomorrow like everyone else does.&quot; <br>
<br>
THIGH POLL<br>
A poll was conducted as to whether men prefer women with large thighs or women with thin thighs. The results were pretty surprising. Ten percent of the men surveyed preferred women with large thighs. Ten percent of the men surveyed preferred women with thin thighs. The other 80 percent preferred something in-between<br>
<br>
BLONDE JOKE<br>
A blind man and his guide dog enter a bar and find their way to a barstool. After ordering a drink and sitting there for a while, the blind guy yells to the bartender, &quot;Hey, you want to hear a blonde joke?&quot; The bar immediately becomes absolutely quiet. In a husky voice, the woman next to him says, &quot;Before you tell that joke, you should know something. The bartender is blonde, the bouncer is blonde and I'm a six-foot tall, 200 pound blonde with a black belt in karate. What's more, the woman sitting next to me is blonde and she's a weightlifter. The lady to your right is a blonde, and she's a wrestler. Think about it seriously, mister. You still want to tell that joke?&quot; The blind guy says, &quot;Nah, not if I'm gonna have to explain it five times.&quot; <br>
<br>
SANTA'S LAP<br>

Joe.&quot; Santa looks at the little girl for a moment and says, &quot;I thought Barbie comes with Ken.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; says the little girl. &quot;She comes with G.I. Joe; she fakes it with Ken.&quot;  <p> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=88780">Sage Caeralee  </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
