Essh! We were jabbering last night and my brain was working on how to fill up 10 days. I asked her if she wanted to do something wild while up here. haha She was hesitant to answer. haha I'm sure she was prolly reviewing what we had already planned and wondering what else I could have in mind. I asked if she had ever bungy jumped before and she exploded in giggles and giddy laughing, saying she had always wanted to try it. Um, add bungy jumping to the list of things we'll be doing. Expect pics of her launching herself off the bridge.<br>
<br>
This is at the Bungy Zone. One of the best rated places for this anywhere. Massive safety record. Heights mess me up. They thrill her though. /sigh Guess I'm gonna have to do it. I think I'll prolly poop my pants on the jump though. haha <br>
<br>

oh! i forgot to mention i get to meet Feyd &amp; Amsra on my lay-over in Seattle! /giggle<br>

/packs as many friends into her trip as she can <br>
<br>
NibblerEQ<br>
I have set up a web site that will let us upload pics from down there and then let people view them... like me clinging to the bridge at the Bungy Zone.  So there may be current updates as we travel, if we can find a computer with a net connection.<br>
<br>
Hmm, maybe if you guys flatter her enough she could be convinced to give out some access codes to get into the more interesting pics.  <br>

 Oh, speaking of pics on the trip... I imagine I'll be taking a ton and I'm sure many will make it onto this board while the rest will be on our little site.<br>
<br>
I thought we could liven up this pic thread by asking.... anyone have any requests?  <br>
<br>
Gotta say sorry to the guildies, I have not found a place down there that will rent us a sheep costume.<br>
 <br>
<br>
Myschief Makerr<br>
no sheep!!!<br>
velcro gloves are evil!!<br>
/hides <br>

Irontaail The Mad<br>
The obligatory .. underwear / getting up shots of course .. and I like sports outfits myself ... leather also always a good choice 8-)  <br>
<br>
 <br>
TigeJ<br>
I personally hope Nibbler and Myschief have an amazing holiday together. <br>
<br>
As for requests...<br>
<br>
May your days be charmed.<br>
May your nights be inspired.<br>
May the words be sweet and kind,<br>
and may the memories you create <br>
resonate for a lifetime.<br>
<br>
How does that sound?<br>
<br>
This trip will be amazing. There are connections taking place that have spanned vast distances and odds to pull two seemingly unconnected people together. This is very cool stuff happening here. Good luck to both of you.<br>
<br>

NibblerEQ<br>
Great reequests!  <br>
<br>
Since you didn't request a picture I'm gonna make sure to snap a shot of all the socks I bring along and send it to you.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
TigeJ<br>
I don't want a picture of yer stinky socks. <br>
<br>
okayokayokay:<br>
<br>
I have always enjoyed the tossled hair on bare shoulders, wry 'omigod I cant walk' smile and glaze-eyed look on the face of a woman after some amazing...  <br>
<br>
There's a request more fitting for the tone of this topic  <br>

Not sure what you are trying to say.  <br>
<br>
Does this mean we have to pick up some bananas?  <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 Myschief Makerr<br>
ROFL <br>
<br>
 <br>
TigeJ<br>
Yes, dancing ones. Nothing makes a woman hot like dancing bananas dont you know. <br>

How about escorting the poetic nymph to an enchanted grove (Cathedral Grove Park) for some nudes amongst the ancient trees there? <br>
 <br>
NibblerEQ<br>
If she agrees, sure... but I doubt you will see any of those.  <br>
 <br>
 <br>
TigeJ<br>
of course of course<br>
<br>
More of a suggestion than a request  <br>

sorry to turn this from a pic forum into one talking about my trip tho hahaha! <br>

 <br>
NibblerEQ<br>
Well, first night is over and I'm still alive! OMG! The bard has serious teeth! The pics have already started to roll in. I'm waiting on setting up a net connection to upload them. We got DSL in our room but the laptop won't cooperate. Soon! <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Darkdan Povar<br>
Yeah, she's a biter. <br>
Darkdan<br>
<br>
 <br>
NibblerEQ<br>
Yep, starting to lose count of the teeth marks. And Irontaail, we think you are following us. There are tiny yellow posters on the telephone poles here that show a face, and damn if it doesn't look like you! Stop watching us. Not like you aren't gonna get some pics anyway. There are some with your name on them already.  <br>
<br>
Still haven't set up the damn laptop. Will be calling a tech today to figure that thing out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh My God&quot; count is up to 7 now.  <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
cimerene  <br>
Stop making us wait.&gt; WE WANT PICTURES<br>
<br>
(um semi clean ones for the boring pallies in the group.. ok me.. get over it lol)<br>

We did the toursit thing today and had some pictures taken of us by weird people. One guy and his ear-licking poodle took some and then some strange lady took some more. In the pictures are Mys using two fingers, teasing a cock.. oh! and we got a picture of Mys and her nice bronze ass. Those will be posted for sure. She is going to be doing the fashion show for me in a few days and that should spawn many, many pictures.<br>
<br>
Irontaail, we took a picture of that poster we mentioned. You will be amazed at how much it looks like you. We had to do some 'minor' vandalism to get at it, but it's ours now.  <br>
<br>
We are going to Cathedral Grove tomorrow and thinking of doing the bungy jump on Monday. Those are the pictures that will be worth money... me clinging to the railing as grown men try to push me off the bridge.<br>
 <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh My God&quot; count up to 13 and even &quot;Holy Shit&quot; a couple times!!<br>
<br>
Damn, tech guy doesn't answer his phone so I can't get the damn laptop to work for me. Maybe tonight.<br>
<br>
/wave from Nibb<br>

 Syrenn Blaze  <br>
No pics YET?! Slack.  <br>
<br>
 <br>
 <br>
NibblerEQ<br>
WE JUMPED!! I didn't cling to the rails. haha I was actually more nervous watching Mys jump than I was myself. Picture count is getting very high. We got a few of us at the Bungy Zone that I'm sure we'll post. And I got a bunch at Eglishman River Falls where Mys did the 'nature' thing and got busted by a herd of little kids.  <br>
<br>
The laptop didn't cooperate at all for the trip. Looks like you'll be waiting till we get back for pics.<br>
<br>
Two more nights and counting...   <br>
<br>

So... here they are...<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_05FirstWalk04.jpg">Walking</a> - The first full day we were together we went for a walk along the ocean.  It was a beautiful sunny day and we both ended up burnt.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_05FirstWalk05.jpg">On Rail</a> - She took off ahead of me and was sitting on a rail when I caught up to her.  Too sweet so I had to snap one.  That orange flower is some kind of torture device cause she kept tickling me with it.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_07BeakenHillPark04.jpg">Peacock</a> - We missed the little petting zoo at Beacon Hill Park but we did find a roaming peacock.  Here's Mys pretending she has food so the darn thing would get friendly with her.  Damn bard, always teasing the cocks.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_10BuchartGardens10.jpg">Shiny Ass</a> - This was at Buchart Gardens.  She walked by the thing and just started cooing like it was her long lost pet.  So here she is rubbing her ass.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_11Irontaail02.jpg">Irontaail</a> - This poster was everywhere for the first part of the trip.  It looks like Irontaail, dammit!!  We felt like we were being watched all the time!  How does he do that?<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_12CathedralGrove04.jpg">Sexual Tree?</a> - You decide if this looks wrong.  Now we are in Cathedral Grove where the trees are never ending, unless there is a huge windstrom.  A few years ago many trees were knocked over in a big storm and the evidence was laying all over the ground.  It was amazing to see just how big they were when you get to see them at your height.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_12CathedralGrove24.jpg">Out On A Limb</a> - Near the back of the Grove we found a peaceful stream and Myschief decided to make camp there.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_12CathedralGrove34.jpg">Bards Float!</a> - More Grove stuff.  There was a log out in the stream and of course Myschief had to test it out.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_12CathedralGrove38.jpg">Friggin Huge!</a> - Here's the biggest tree we saw.  It ends up splitting into two up top though.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_15Bungy14.jpg">Ready To Jump</a> - There she is at the top getting ready to fly off the bridge.  Just after this pic was taken she jumped so I didn't get any of her actually launching off the bridge, but we did get it all on video.  =)<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_15Bungy16.jpg">Dangling</a> - Here she is in mid spring.  Not much to see though.  The cord pulls you back until you are almost up to the bridge again, then you repeat the whole process until you eventually lose you momentum.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_15Bungy21.jpg">Someone Bouncing</a> - Here is a view from the side.  Not sure who the jumper is though.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_15Bungy22.jpg">Jump Happy</a> - Here is Myschief after her jump.  She was giddy for a very long time after.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_15Bungy25.jpg">Us Together</a> - This is us.  We both put on our 'Certified Jumper' Tshirts and one of the staff took our picture.  It was definately a rush.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_15Bungy26.jpg">Still Giddy</a> - We hung around for quite a while and watched some other jumpers, had a drink on their patio, chatted, and when we finally got back to the car I asked how she felt about her jump.  The expression said it all.  =)<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_16EnglishmanFalls10.jpg">Englishman Falls</a> - Next stop was a set of waterfalls near the bungy area.  Shame the pics can't capture the roar of the water.  We walked down to the cliff area where we shouldn't have been for this pic. <br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_18Modeling49.jpg">All Smiles</a> - We spent a good portion of the last day just hanging out in our room.  She put on a fashion show for me and I just cranked out the pictures.  Here is one of my faves.<br>

<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_23InBed06.JPG">Waking Up</a> - Mornings look really good when this is what you see.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_21Yellow22.JPG">Legs!</a> - This was part of the fashion show she gave me.  She put on this little yellow mesh bikini.  Very yummy.  The shot is of her after she was done with posing and doing some stretches on the ground.  This was just too sexy to not get a pic of.  Shows her sexah legs.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_06RestingInRoom01.JPG">Sleeping Beauty</a> - I have no idea when this pic was taken, but it could be after we got back to the room and she was tired enough to want a nap.  You can't really tell but the sexy underwear she had on was striped with see-thru sections that hinted at desert.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_09ButterflyGardens01.JPG">We Have Landing!</a> - This was taken at the Butterfly Gardens, a living show case of butterflies.  There were small ones, big ones, massively large ones, blue, green, white, striped and spotted.  The one pictured here actually stayed on Mys for most of the time we were there.  She had several butterflies land on her during the visit, and at one time she had 3 on her at once.  All the funky tourists kept pointing at her and taking pictures.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_16EnglishmanFalls17.JPG">Angel</a> - In this pic the dark forest made the camera try to compensate with a longer exposure and that ended up making Mys glow.  Not what I wanted, but it turned out to be a picture I'm very fond of.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_16EnglishmanFalls19.JPG">Cliff Gazing</a> - Heights don't bother her much.  She is standing on a cliff over the river that is about 100 feet high.  She just walked up and started gazing.  /shiver<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_22Blue11.JPG">Close Up</a> - Here is a nice picture that shows off her uber cuteness.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_18Modeling69.JPG">School Girl</a> - One of the outfits we did photo stuff with was her blue plaid skirt and whites.  I have to say that was one of the great ones.  Yep, even had the teeny white cotton panties, which you can't see here.  =p  /smack<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_15Bungy11.JPG">Bondage</a> - Another shot from da Bungy place.  They are strapping her in.  I made some comment about a little bondage in the morning being a good thing and the guy looked and me and said he was gonna tie my hands up as well.  Hmm, good thing he was cute.  =)<br>
<br>
 <a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_13NanaimoBath35.JPG">Toweling Off</a> - We did a nice set of her in the bath and this is her drying off after.  This is about as close to nude as we will get here.  /tease<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unleashedeq.com/vic/Victoria02_16EnglishmanFalls45.JPG">Soaking</a> - A shot from Englishman Falls again.  She went for a swim in her T and panties.  The water was cool and made for a great nip shot, but the damn camera overexposed again so all you see is white.  hehe<br>
