My friend, and co-team member of Shades of Grey Investigations (SGI) on the City of Heroes Roleplaying board, Nyx challenged me to it.  <br>
<br>
*Dusty steps in wearing a Boris Karloff mask* (Dusty is my SGI character btw)<br>
<br>
And now I present to you &quot;How Nyx Stole Christmas&quot; (based on the original story of &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; by Dr. Suess)<br>
<br>
Every SGI member in the SGI office liked christmas a lot<br>
But Nyx, who lived just a block north of their office did not<br>
<br>
Nyx hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season! Now, please don't ask why. But SGI team members don't quite knows the reason. It could be her mind wasn't screwed in just right. Or maybe the leather catsuit was too tight. But I think that the most likely reason of all may have been that her heart was two sizes too small.<br>
<br>
But, what ever the reason, her heart or her clothes, she stood there on Christmas Eve, hating those SGI bozos. Staring round from her home with a sour Nyx frown. At the warm lighted windows a few doors down. For she knew every SGI in the office beneath Was busy now, hanging a mistletoe wreath.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aether's hanging their stockings&quot; she snarled with a sneer. &quot;Tomorrow is Christmas! Tis Practictically here&quot; Then she growled, her fingers nervously drumming, &quot;I must find some way to stop this Christmas nonsense from coming&quot;<br>
<br>
For, Tomorrow, she knew. . . all the SGI girls and boys would wake bright and early. They'd rush for their toys! And Then! Oh, the Noise! Oh, the Noise! Noise! Noise! Noise! That's the one thing she hated! The NOISE! NOISE! NOISE! Then the SGI team both young and old would sit down to a feast. And they'd feast! And they'd feast! And they'd FEAST! FEAST! FEAST!<br>
<br>
They would feast on figgy pudding and medium well done roast beast. Which is something Nyx couldn't stand in the least! And THEN they'd do something she liked least of all! Every SGI member both short and tall would stand close together, with Christmas bells ringing. They'd stand hand-in-hand. And the team would start singing! They'd sing! And they'd sing! And they'd SING! SING! SING! SING! The more Nyx thought of this SGI Christmas Sing. The more Nyx thought &quot;I must stop this whole thing!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why for over six months I've put up with some sort of silliness now!&quot;<br>
&quot;I MUST stop this Christmas thing from coming. . . but HOW?&quot;<br>
Then she got an idea! An awful idea! NYX GOT, A WONDERFUL, AWFUL IDEA! &quot;I know just what to do!&quot; Nyx chuckled in the back of her throat. She made a new suit that looked like a Santa Claus hat, pants and coat. And she chuckled and Clucked, &quot;What a great Nyx trick!&quot;<br>
&quot;With this coat, these pants and this hat, I'll take the place of St. Nick!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;All I need is a reideer. . .&quot; Nyx looked around. But in since reindeer are scarce, in Paragon City there were none to be found.<br>
Did that stop Nyx. . .? No! Nyx simply said, &quot;If I can't find a reindeer. I'll have to make one instead!&quot; So she called the resident robot Noirbot. And she tied a big horn to the top of its head.<br>
<br>
THEN she loaded some bags and a bunch of old sacks on a broken down sled and hitched up old Noirbot. Then Nyx said, &quot;Giddap&quot; And the sled started round toward the homes where SGI members lived around town.<br>
<br>
All the office and home windows were dark. Quiet snow filled the air. All of SGI were all dreaming of crime fighting without care. When she came to the first little home on a square. &quot;This is stop number one&quot; Nyx Clause hissed as she climbed to the roof, the empty bags in her fist.<br>
<br>
Then she slid down the chimney. A rather tight nitch. But if the Real santa could do it, so could Nyx. She got stuck only once for a moment or two. Then stuck her head out of the fireplace flue. Where the SGI stockings all hung in a row. &quot;These stockings,&quot; she grinned, &quot;are the first things that must go!&quot;<br>
<br>
Then she slithered and slunk, with a smile most unpleasant, around the whole room, and she took every present! Gas guns! And Motorcycles! Roller blades! Some Rum! Cyber boards! Bicycles! Pop caps! And guns! And she stuffed them in bags. Then Nyx, very Nimbly, Stuffed all the bags, one by one, up the chimney!<br>
<br>
Then she slunk to the icebox. She took SGI's feast! She took the figgy pudding! She took that weird roast beast! She cleaned out that icebox quick as the Flash. Why that Nyx even took the last of the cash (gotta make a buck you know)<br>
<br>
Then she stuffed all the food up the chiney with glee &quot;And NOW for my next trick&quot; grinned Nyx, &quot;I'll stuff up the tree!&quot; And Nyx grabbed the tree and started to shove when she heard a small sound was it the coo of a dove? She turned around fast and saw someone small. It was Pigeon he had just wandered down the hall. Nyx had been caught by this tiny SGI brother, who'd got out of bed for a cup of cold water. He stared at Nyx and said &quot;Santa Claus, why, Why are you taking our Christmas tree? Why?&quot;<br>
<br>
But, you know, Nyx was so smart and slick. She thought up a lie and she thought it up quick! &quot;Why, dear young friend&quot; the fake Santa lied, &quot;There's a light on this tree that won't light on the side&quot;<br>
&quot;So, I'm taking it home to my workshop, dear.&quot;<br>
&quot;I'll fix it up there. Then I'll bring it back here&quot;<br>
<br>
And her fib fooled the boy. Then she patted his head. And she got him a drink of Dusty's sleep potion and sent him back to his bed. And when Pigeon went to bed with the cup, She went back to the chimney and stuffed the tree up! Then the last thing she took was the log for their fire! Then she went up the chimney, herself, that liar. On their walls she left nothing but hooks and some wire.<br>
<br>
And the one speck of food that she left in the house was a crumb that was even too small for the resident mouse. Then she did the same thing to the other SGI members houses. Leaving crumbs much too small for the other resident mouses! It was a quarter past dawn...All of SGI, still in bed, all the members still snoozin' when she packed up her sled, packed it up with their presents! The ribbons! The wrappings! The tags! And tinsel! The trimmings! The trappings!<br>
<br>
Three hundred feet up! Up the Trumpet tower she rode with her load to the tiptop to dump it!<br>
&quot;Pooh-pooh to SGI! she was humming &quot;They're finding out now that no Christmas is coming! They're just waking up! I know just what they'll do!&quot;<br>
&quot;Their mouths will hang open a minute or two then SGI in that dingy office will cry Boo-Hoo!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's a noise,&quot; grinned Nyx &quot;That I simply must hear&quot; So she paused. And Nyx put her hand to her ear. And she did hear a sound rising over the snow. It started in low. Then started to grow. . .But the sound wasn't sad! Why this sound sounded merry! It couldn't be so! But it was merry! Very much so!<br>
<br>
She stared over at the SGI office! Nyx popped her eyes! Then she shook! What she saw was a shocking surprise! For every team member the short and the tall, was singing! Without any presents at all! She hadn't stopped this Christmas from coming! IT CAME! Somehow or the other, it came just the same!<br>
<br>
And Nyx with her feet icy cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling &quot;How could this be so?&quot; &quot;It came with out Dusty's ribbons! It came with out Janus' tags! It came with out Aether's packages, Psiker's boxes or Dr. S' bags!&quot; And she puzzled for a good three hours, till her puzzler was sore. Then Nyx thought of something she had not before!<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe Christmas,&quot; she thought &quot;doesn't come from a store. maybe Christmas. . .perhaps . . . means a bit more!&quot; And what happened then. . .? Well. . . in SGI they say that Nyx's small heart GREW three sizes that day!<br>
<br>
And the moment her heart did not feel quite so tight she whizzed with her load of gifts through the bright morning's light. She brought back Pigeon's toys! And Suede's food for the feast! And she. . . SHE HERSELF . . . Nyx carved that roast beast!<br>
<br>
The End <p>&lt;br&gt;<br>
