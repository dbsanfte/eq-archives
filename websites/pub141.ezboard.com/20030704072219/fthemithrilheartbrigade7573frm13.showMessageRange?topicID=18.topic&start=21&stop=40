Stops were just frequent enough to allow sore muscles to uncramp and needs to be taken care of.  One passenger though, a man who's girth she thought might tip the wagon, was not satisfied.  He was loudly complaining that the stops were too short and infrequent.  He would complain when the train stopped that it was 'About time'.  When merchants shouted for their passengers to reload he complained 'But we just got off'.<br>
Naturally it didn't stop there.  Bumpy roads elicited comments about road taxes and seat cusions and smooth roads about the monarchy pleasing influential rich folk while the poor languished about on the bumpy roads.  He had found himself an ear in a younger man named Tanis who calmly sat by him and took in the ranting with little response.  Of course, Derrwin McHenry thought this was agreement and felt he should elucidate on every topic he could think of.  The wagon driver threatened them both to the back of the wagon or he'd leave them behind on the next stop.  Tanis, forced into following the loudly complaining McHenry, looked slightly annoyed but followed the driver's directions anyway.  During a stop, Greeneyes was standing near the dwarf and overheard him tell Drage Penumbri, one of the mercenary adventurers, he'd have just kicked the oaf off the wagon miles back.  She laughed and their eyes fell on her.  A moment passed before they all laughed at the image of McHenry rolling off the wagon and complaining the whole way.<br>
<br>
The first town they hit, Tarrelton, was a small farming community that did trade with the Guild.  Several wagons were waiting as the Kaskell Traders rumbled into town.  Farmers waited calmly by the door to a ramshackle tavern called the Field of Dreams chatting on about the crop this year or the local rumors that passed for the news.  Children ran through the street chasing dogs or each other in innocent play.<br>
When the children saw the wagons they ran excitedly back and forth along the line, dogs yipping at their heels.  A loud whistle from one of the farmers brought the whole group of animals and children running out of the way as the traders pulled to one side of the street and stopped.<br>
Tagar Strongstep, the dwarven merchant shouted, &quot;All off!  One band in Tarrelton, one band in Tarrelton!&quot; much to the chagrin of McHenry who immediately started complaining.  Tagar shot a look that didn't silence him, but took his volume down considerably.  His silent companion took the first opportunity to slip away and wasn't even missed by Derrwin for several minutes.<br>
Greeneyes also took the time to get away and walk down the street.  The town wasn't much more than a single street with a half-dozen stores stocking household items, tools and drygoods.  Pulling out her map she looked over it and saw that indeed there was nothing more to the town itself.  However the farmland around it was considerable, which explained the lack of homes in the town itself.  She looked around for a moment, wondering if her goal was here, before heading for the little tavern.<br>
The farmers and traders were loading the wagons, haggling over prices or trade and commenting on events throughout the Monarchy.  Greeneyes slid by them and entered the Field of Dreams.  Not much to look at itself, it had already found customers in the adventurers and passengers.  The Tradesway Guards stood outside by the wagons chatting with Tagar.  McHenry had found his way in and was loudly discussing crop maintenance with the barkeep who's skeptical look indicated he thought the man was carrying pocket loads of horse manure.  Liza Ta Kernak, a young Tye Basran woman, was sitting at a nearby table with Daniel Carson.  Daniel was a mage apprentice and made it a point to tell anybody who would listen about his intentions of becoming a powerful wizard.  Liza sat quietly with a glass of white wine looking every bit like a cornered animal.  His attentions had been focused on the shy girl as soon as he found she wouldn't tell him to leave her alone.<br>
When Greeneyes approached the bar, the keep hurried over to her and asked, &quot;What'll ya have missy?&quot;<br>
&quot;Water would be fine,&quot; she replied as she hopped up onto a stool.<br>
&quot;Not to be rude or anything, but are ya takin' him with ya when ya leave?&quot; he said, subtly indicating McHenry.<br>
She grinned and nodded.  &quot;I suppose we have to.  Unless Tagar gets fed up enough.&quot;<br>
He nodded, apparently satisfied then added, &quot;He talks too much.&quot;<br>
<br>
The wagons rolled out of town as children waved from the rails of their own wagons.  The barkeep had come to see them off, Greeneyes guessed to make sure they took McHenry, who had already started a new one-sided discussion with his uncomplaining companion.<br>
Day stretched into evening and when the wagons finally stopped for the night, everyone was happy.  McHenry, of course, was the happiest and made sure everybody knew it.  Edder, McHenry and Tanis' driver made tracks to where the other drivers had gathered and Greeneyes could guess what the topic of discussion would be when he got there.  Deandra Cormic, who was travelling to Tasserty to visit her grandchildren, and Pendar Denton, a younger but retired adventurer, sat chatting near the fire about home and family.  The mercenaries were with the Guard splitting up the watch rotation while Daniel continued his own one-sided conversation with Liza.  The girl was doing her best to look like she wasn't ignoring him while setting up her bedroll as quickly as possible.  Climbing into it, she told Daniel she was tired and rolled over away from the apprentice, flashing a look of helplessness at Greeneyes before closing her eyes.<br>
<br>
They waited.  She wasn't alone, she felt them all around her and knew why they had gathered.  The wizards were coming to parlay.  The ones they represented wanted them gone, away from the Nexus and out of their lands.  They were angry but the ones she was with didn't know why.  She did.<br>
She had killed the White Robes courier and left the mark of those she waited with.  She knew the wizards weren't coming to talk, it was a trap.  When they came, their robes billowing like clouds behind them, their auras almost too bright for her eyes, she called it out to her companions.<br>
The forest around them exploded as both sides responded with magic.  Plants grew and formed into things with claws and thorns that twisted and grabbed.  Fire, ice, and wind flew from the fingertips of both sides of the joined battle.  While the forest came alive with magic, death radiated from the Sapphire Witch.  Fire erupted from one mage's hands and a second later his face, twisted in horror, hit the ground.  Even as a second mage's flesh turned to dust, the first rose in a terrible mockery of life and reached for another.  The wizard could only stare in shock as his former ally, face still a mask of terror, grabbed him by the neck and snapped it like a twig.  The wizards were not without their own power and she felt those around her die from flame, lightning and pure energy that coursed through blood and bone to destroy the life within.  It was exhilarating.<br>
<br>
She jerked into a sitting position, a sheen of sweat across her face.  Trying to slow her breathing she looked around.  Nobody seemed to have been awakened.  Only the night guard roamed at this time.  The mage Jasae Fortan, who's shift it was to watch over the sleeping caravaners, was looking right at Greeneyes from across the campsite.  Their eyes met and locked for a moment before she calmly looked away and continued her rounds.  Greeneyes lay back down and stared at the stars, unable to return to sleep.  She lay there for several bands, through the change out of the guard until sunrise.<br>
Exhilarated.  The same, sickening excitement during the dream she felt when she used her magic.  The thrill of the craft flowing from around her and through her.  A cold chill went up her spine when she thought of the temptation to use it and of Pippen, withered and dead because of it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Morning!  Everybody awake!&quot;  The voice of the guard rang out across the camp.  &quot;One band afore we move out.  Take care o' yer business and break camp!&quot;<br>
She wearily rolled up and gathered her blanket up.<br>
&quot;One band?  That's hardly time for a body to wake up, much less eat a good meal and pack.&quot;  The petulant voice of McHenry raked across everyone's' nerves and ruined what was already a bad morning for Greeneyes.  After much poking and prodding and not a few threats of abandonment at the mercy of the wilderness beasts, Derrwin McHenry sat miserably in his wagon at the end of the band.<br>
<br>
The day was much the same as before.  Regular stops punctuated by Derrwin's gripes and temporarily stopped by Tagar's threats.  As they pulled into the small town of Tasserty that evening most of the crew and passengers had had their fill of Derrwin McHenry.  Several jokes laced with threats made their way around the group, though most were relatively harmless.  Nail his door shut or buy him a large breakfast and leave him behind were the most popular.<br>
Deandra Cormic said goodbye to Pendar and the others before disappearing into town.  Neither she nor Tanis Sazar participated in the jibes, with Tanis leaving as soon as she did to find a room.<br>
<br>
The next morning, McHenry hefted his large frame into the wagon and sat contentedly waiting for the train to depart.  Greeneyes wondered at his silence and bright face until she heard Edder whisper to Karton, one of the other drivers.<br>
&quot;That meal put us out three silver and there the fat pig sits, early even.&quot;<br>
Karton nodded, &quot;Aye, an' after seein' him put away that pig, I don' think I'll be eatin' squealer anytime soon.&quot;<br>
&quot;And thank Tyme he don't know who paid.  I don't think I could stand his gratitude.&quot;<br>
Karton laughed as he mounted his wagon next to Greeneyes.  Edder jumped up into his wagon and was greeted loudly by Derrwin.<br>
&quot;Hail and good morning to you friend.  My thanks for that fine meal.&quot;  He clapped Edder loudly on the shoulder.  &quot;If the eggs had been a little fresher I think it would have been perfect.&quot;  Edder hung his head in resignation as the other drivers hid smiles and retreated to their wagons.  &quot;Perhaps their skillet bread was a little darker than I would have liked it.&quot;  He brought his finger to his chin and stared out in contemplation.  &quot;The pig was a little dry, though -&quot;<br>
&quot;Move out!&quot;  Tagar's voice rang out, only temporarily drowning out Derrwin's critique of his morning meal.<br>
Greeneyes dug through her pack and pulled out her map.  Another day to the town of Borderbridge.  She saw Borderbridge was aptly named as it lay just before the Triark River crossing that separated Thymallesra and Torain.  If only she had just one more clue where Loreana and Merrie had traveled to.  Would she have to travel beyond Triark?  Just where beyond could she go?  Greeneyes knew little about Thymallesra, but she knew the Elan watched carefully the other races that came and left their lands.  Her vision had given her the feeling that what she sought was before Triark but it was only a feeling.  There were dozens of communities along the road.  Most had to be reached by one of the many smaller roads branching off the main one.  Her feeling could still take her through Rimdale Forrest, or to the Dragon's Perch Mountains.<br>
She huffed in disgust at her mental ramblings.  It was useless to fret over where she could or might end up.  As long as she had a path to walk she would walk it until she found this little girl and revealed the mystery surrounding their lives.<br>
McHenry, while in a better mood was no less talkative.  She could hear him ahead of her over the clatter of wagons and horses.  Apparently his chatter had finally gotten under Sazar's skin.  The man fidgeted constantly and looked like he either wanted to hit him or jump from the wagon.  Derrwin paid no attention and continued his banter.<br>
By the time they stopped for lunch, Sazar had silenced McHenry with a terse and overly loud, &quot;Shut up you blathering fool!&quot;  Though the thought was echoed by most, the ferocity of it embarrassed everyone into silence.  The whole party was quite subdued, except for Sazar who continued to fidget and send furtive glances around him until the wagons pulled into a clearing off the side of the road.<br>
Liza was looking worse than normal as she got off the wagon.  Daniel Carson's attentions had become too much for her and she slowly gravitated toward Greeneyes, though the two had said little more than polite greetings to each other.  She felt sorry for the girl but wished she would take it upon herself to tell the apprentice to shove off.  As Daniel started over to them, Greeneyes gave him such an evil look he was momentarily taken aback then calmly moved on to where the mercenaries had gathered, as if meaning to go there the whole time.<br>
&quot;Why do you put up with him?&quot;  Greeneyes asked as they shared some of her trail bread.<br>
&quot;I don't want to be impolite,&quot; the girl responded after thinking a moment.<br>
&quot;Impolite?  He's been bothering you the whole trip.  Just tell him you don't want to talk to him anymore.&quot;  She looked over at the boy who was trying miserably to impress the mercenaries.  &quot;Not that you've actually done any of the talking.&quot;<br>
&quot;But that would be impolite.  I inquired about his profession.  To tell -&quot;<br>
&quot;To tell him to politely shut up would be normal since he hasn't in several days.&quot;  Greeneyes sighed.  &quot;Look, if you can't silence him then just stay with me.  I think he'll get the idea after a while.&quot;<br>
&quot;Well, I suppose that would be a suitable solution.&quot;  She glanced in the apprentice's direction then at Greeneyes.  &quot;Thank you.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://drakksnet.homestead.com/files/Ghost.gif height=50 width=60" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br>  Posts: 1146<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/20/01 9:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=31>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 23</span><hr size=1> &quot;Just give us the item and we'll leave as quietly as we came.&quot;  The bandit, a tall human dressed in faded browns and greens, held a crossbow to McHenry's neck, poking lightly to ensure the man heard him.<br>
They had come on them suddenly, their drab garb and silent motion keeping them hidden until their victims had settled comfortably for the midday meal.  Even the Guards and mercenaries were caught unaware as swords, daggers, and crossbows appeared from the surrounding brush and rocks to rest lightly against their throats.  Amongst the eight bandits, three hulking Gruagan held the ones the rogues deemed the greatest threat.  Jasae, the Guard mage, had her arms pinned tightly in a one-armed bear hug, the Gruagan's other hand wrapped around her face to keep her silent.  Her eyes burned with anger but she was helpless against the ogre's strength.  Kenner, the other Guard, was held in similar fashion but had no hand around his mouth until he had spouted off a multitude of threats and curses at the ogre and his fellows.<br>
Torc Shu Ason, a Tye Basran and one of the mercenaries, was pinned to the ground by the other Gruagan.  His writhing and flailing had finally gotten on the brute's nerves.  Now he had the ogre's knee in the small of his back and the pressure was increased every time Torc made the smallest of movements.  The rest of the bandits, humans of indefinable origins, spread out amongst the others and threatened them down to their knees.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know what you are speaking of.  I have nothing but a pauper's purse of coin, and you may have it all if you just go,&quot; Derrwin pleaded with him.  &quot;I don't und-&quot; His sentence was cut short by the blade of a dagger poking him enough to make him jump.  Tanis Sazar held the dagger and poked him again, evoking a squeal of pain.  &quot;Of course you do.  I sat with you long enough, listening to your incessant rattling, to see you tap that box beneath your seat with your foot at least twice a band.  Did you think it would fall out of the wagon?  We only need you to retrieve that box and remove whatever wards lay upon it.  Then we will take it off your hands, and leave you all to the rest of your trip.&quot;<br>
&quot;I - I can not.  It was not meant for me to open.  I do not have the keys to the wards.&quot;  Derrwin's voice lost the petulant whining everybody was familiar with.  Knowing his charade was over, he took on a calm demeanor, catching the brigand off guard for only a moment.<br>
&quot;Look Priest,&quot; the bandit leader jabbed him with the bolt point again.  &quot;I don't care if we have to tie the box to your belly and drop you off a cliff to break it open, you will be the one to open it.  However,&quot; he looked at the other members of the wagon train and smiled thinly.  &quot;Before I resort to that I will ensure you watch every one of these innocent people die a very slow, very bloody, and very painful death.&quot;<br>
<br>
Greeneyes was kneeling next to Liza, afraid to even move as she saw the sword blade, tip dancing lightly between her and the girl, out of the corner of her eye.  She could feel her magic slowly rising like a flood against a dam.  She began to feel the fire behind her eyes and closed them, whispering softly, &quot;No, no, no,&quot; over and over.  Not this time, not even if they were all to die would she loose control.  Not again would she give in to the craft.<br>
&quot;Whut she sayin?&quot;  A bandit asked the one who held the sword between the women.<br>
&quot;Beggin fer her life I think.&quot;  He looked down at them and sneered through a black mustache and beard.  &quot;Don't worry pretty ladies, I think you'll both get to have a good ol' time before you go.  Whadda ya think?&quot;  He placed a hand on Greeneyes shoulder and shook her.<br>
<br>
Face down on something soft, hands gripping cloth.  The same texture on her tongue, filling her mouth and muffling her cries.<br>
<br>
&quot;No!&quot;  She hissed fiercely, even as the bandit backed away from her, screaming.<br>
They all watched as the rogue dropped his sword to stare at the hand he had touched her with.  His fingers shriveled into bony claws as he grabbed his wrist with his other hand screaming in terror and pain.  The craft crept up his arm, withering skin and muscle as it went.  It spread to his other hand and he let go to stare at both arms in horror.<br>
While the bandits watched their companion in stricken fascination, Jasae kicked backwards with all her strength right between the Gruagan's legs.<br>
&quot;Hoof!&quot;<br>
The creature's grasp loosened just enough.  She dropped to the ground, rolled away and stood, a spell already on her lips.<br>
All hell broke loose then.  Liza turned around and seeing the bandit in the thrall of the craft, screamed and ran.  McHenry, knocking away the crossbow from the bandit, fell to the dagger of Tanis Sazar who twisted and turned the blade while whispering fierce words in the dying priest's ear.  Swords flashed, bolts flew and bodies fell.  Jasae had unleashed a rain of fire on the Gruagan, only to be grabbed by the flaming beast and taken to the ground.  Pinned beneath, she too was overtaken by flames, thrashing and screaming.  Daniel had started to cast one of the spells in his meager repertoire and was rewarded with a crossbow bolt to the chest.  <br>
Greeneyes hovered over the bandit's withered body, an ever-increasing wind whipped around her as she surveyed the scene of fire and death with eyes that blazed like burning emeralds. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://drakksnet.homestead.com/files/Ghost.gif height=50 width=60" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br>  Posts: 1149<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/21/01 5:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=33>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 24</span><hr size=1> Running.  Running from her whole life.  Running from the nightmarish memories that wouldn't leave her be, from Pippen, whose broken body she had abandoned in her insane quest.  Running from everyone and everything since the day she found herself in an old healer's home outside Miera Kiy.<br>
&quot;Ahh!&quot;  Her head!  She fell to her knees, almost pitching forward on her face at the abrupt halt.  The magic roiled and burned inside her head.<br>
&quot;NO!&quot;  She screamed as she fought it back again.  Dead!  They're all dead because I couldn't control it.<br>
The bandit's vicious threat against her and the girl brought forth the fragment of memory and broke the thin chain that had held her magic in check.  It was all a blur after that.  A whirlwind of screaming weapons and burning magic.  The girl, what was her name?  She had run from the death of the bandit to her own.  <br>
Her head swam as she pressed her hands to her temples, willing the magic away.  Liza, Liza Ta Kernak.  The only time Greeneyes saw Liza assert herself was not against a lowly, egotistical apprentice but a monstrous Gruagan.  The girl had run in terror right into the waiting grasp of the creature and immediately fought to escape.  Tears ran down Greeneye's cheeks as a growl escaped through gritted teeth.  The young Tye Basran had fought admirably for all of a few seconds before the ogre broke her back with a single blow.<br>
'What was it?'  She couldn't lay name to the reason her magic had broke her hold.  The threat, another memory she couldn't comprehend.  Like the vision of the battle with the mages, exhilaration swiftly overtook anger.  The magic flowed through her, destroying life around her.  She couldn't stop, didn't want to stop.  They fell to her like grass to the scythe.  And when there were no more to fall, when she saw the devastation she had wrought upon foe and friend alike, she had run.<br>
The crunch of brush behind her made her whirl around as a wave of dizziness almost overcame her.<br>
'No. Not that.  Anything but...'  She choked as the last of whatever meal she had eaten rose out of her stomach.<br>
Before her stood Daniel Carson, the young apprentice mage.  His eyes were rolled upwards, staring at nothing, his once blond hair dirty and knotted.  He had lost his riding cloak somewhere and only wore his silken pants, torn and brown from the dirt at the campsite, and his white shirt, matted with dirt and dried blood.  Protruding from his breast, the broken shaft of a crossbow quarrel, its feathered end splintered and cocked to the side.<br>
Greeneyes brought her hands to her mouth as a low cry echoed from her.  She had done this.  She had caused this cursed puppet, this apparition to rise of its own accord, when the boy should have lain dead from the bolt that pierced his heart.  The craft had coursed through her to cause this creature to do her work.  It had struck indiscriminately, as she had.  Closing her eyes the images of bandits and fellow travelers struck down by the undead creature swam in her mind.<br>
&quot;Just go away!&quot; she said, half to the images, half to the zombie.  Hearing footsteps she looked up to see it walking away from her.  Taking slow, uneven paces it traced its way through the light brush back where it had come from.<br>
&quot;Stop.&quot;  She gritted her teeth and rose.  It couldn't be sent away.  Gods only knew what kind of havoc it could wreak on its own.  While she stood there, staring at it, Greeneyes could feel the magic rising again.  Destroy it.  Dispel whatever evil caused the dead boy to walk about to do her bidding.<br>
No.  To surrender to the craft again, and so soon, was more distressing, more wrong, than even the thing standing before her.  There had to be a way to destroy it.  Would it turn on her if she attacked it?  She didn't know and wasn't willing to try, not yet.<br>
Night came.  Her map was back with the wagons and there was no question about returning.  By the setting sun she knew she traveled east, but it didn't matter.  There was nowhere she could go until she was rid of the thing that followed in her footsteps.  It stood there, just in the light of the fire that had taken her a whole band to start with sticks and her knife.  She considered sending it out of sight, but found the thought unsettling.  The creature would stay where she could see it, to keep an eye on it and to remind her of the control she lost.<br>
<br>
Daniel greeted her in the morning, still standing where she had left him.  The rising sun was casting its light across his pale face when she decided that she couldn't have this thing follow her any longer.  Scavenging for as much dead wood and brush she could find, she gathered it together in a pile across the camp from the zombie.  Resolving herself to the task, she ordered her cursed puppet to stand in the coals of the campfire.  When it did so without protest she began piling the wood around its feet, hesitantly at first, then when it showed no sign of refusal, more rapidly.<br>
The scent of burning flesh made her gag as she saw ribbons of smoke rise from its feet where it stood in the glowing coals.  She quickened her pace and soon had the brush up to its shoulders with no sign that it was even aware of what was to befall it.<br>
Shoving a branch of dried leaves beneath the wood, she stirred up the coals until the smaller tinder ignited.  The flames spread quickly causing her to stumble backward.  Orange tongues of fire licked up around the undead apprentice's legs causing his clothing to burst into flame.  She held her arm to her nose as she stared into it, unable to turn away as the flames engulfed the creature.  Only when the collapse of branches caused a violent burst of cinders did she back up and turn away, a solitary tear running down her cheek.  Trodding eastward, she left the fire turned funeral bier to greet the rising sun.<br>
She let the tears come for as long as they would.  Dundare said the other one, the Sapphire Witch, would not regret her actions, would not grieve for those lost.  Greeneyes held to that though with all her might as she stumbled down game trails and through trees, heedless of where her feet carried her.<br>
<br>
It wasn't until early evening when she stepped past an outcropping of trees and brush and onto the road.  More of a wagon trail, it came from the southwest and turned north.  Since she had been heading north originally she decided to continue, though she knew she was lost and would have to stop soon.  Greeneyes hadn't eaten since the raid and was covered in dirt, blood and ash.<br>
Coming to her senses, she realized a stream or river was what she needed most.  It wasn't likely she would be welcome in many places looking and smelling as she did and her thirst was overwhelming.  Greeneyes sat down on a nearby rock when she realized just how tired she was.  Her shoulders sagged as she rested her arms on her knees and hung her head in fatigue. <br>
&quot;Gods I hope I don't have much further to go,&quot; she whispered to herself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Huh?&quot;  Her head bounced and she winced at the pain in her neck.  'Damn, must have fallen asleep.'  She looked up when she heard a low sound coming from the trees.  'Voices?'  Was she that close to others?  Slowing her breathing she listened.  Hushed whispers and... Giggling?  She looked out into the darkness that had swallowed the woods.  A light, no two, just down the road and into the trees.  A house maybe, but no, the lights danced like torches.  Fighting muscles that had tightened while she dozed, she quietly rose and made her way down the road.  Not wanting to spook the innocent, nor alert those not so, she tried her best at walking with a cautious but nonchalant pace.<br>
Greeneyes thought she made out the words &quot;Here she comes&quot; before the lights moved slowly away.  Instantly wary, she then realized that the voice sounded like a child's.  The giggling, the not-so-quiet whispers.  Definitely children.  She debated whether she should follow, knowing she looked frightening, but her need for shelter and food was worth the risk.<br>
Feeling uneasy as she left the road, she quietly pursued the torches as they made their slow, almost playful way through the woods.<br>
What were they doing so far out at night?  Most parents wouldn't allow it, even in the safest of towns.  Suddenly she though sadly about Loreana.  A little girl seeing her father murdered before her eyes.  They were not even safe in their own home.<br>
Almost letting the lights get away from her she rushed to catch up just before they ducked around a large oak.  Behind the ancient tree she saw a small trail leading in the direction the larger road had gone.  In the other direction the lights of a small house burned dimly through the trees.  She saw no sign of the torch lights or the children.<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; she said to herself.  &quot;If I'm going to be knocking on someone's door I should at least try to make myself presentable.&quot;  She combed her fingers through uncooperative hair then wrapped the mess in a single knot behind her head, the tail still reaching the middle of her back.  Her cloak she reversed so the blue was outward, then she scrubbed her face with one of the few clean spots on the cloth.  She didn't know what else to do.  Pulling the hood up just far enough to cover her hair, she began her walk to the small cottage. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://drakksnet.homestead.com/files/Ghost.gif height=50 width=60" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br>  Posts: 1150<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/21/01 5:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=34>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 25</span><hr size=1> It was a comfortable little home.  Trellises growing thick with ivy and thieves rope vines stood against whitewashed stone sealed tightly with mortar.  Two windows glowed brightly to the left of a wide door, the top half of which was open slightly allowing the night air to enter.  A small garden off to the left of the house lay mostly in darkness but for a patch in the middle illuminated by another window.  Flower beds and pots lay under the windows and scattered about the front of the house.<br>
She stood staring at the house, drinking in the warm feeling it gave her when the upper half of the door swung open and a figure cast a shadow outward.<br>
&quot;Well don't just stand there dear, you look tired.  Come in, I just made a pot of tea.&quot;  A grandmotherly voice reached out into the night.<br>
Greeneyes tilted her head then thought better of her question and stepped up to the doorway as it swung open for her.  The elder woman smiled at her as she came into the lamplight.  Greeneyes couldn't help but smile a little in return.  The old woman looked happy to have a visitor.  The years had made their mark, yet in a soft, gently way.  Short and with the weight that came to some in their twilight years she still moved gracefully as she welcomed her guest inside, then crossed the floor into her kitchen.  Greeneyes closed the door as it had been, then looked about the small home.<br>
The stone had been left natural inside with mortar lying thick but smooth between to seal the night air out.  Everywhere she looked was furniture, shelves and other items made of wood naturally formed to whatever function it served.  Spread across the shelves and tables were small bric-a-brac of infinite variety.  Figurines, plants, rocks, animals all seeming to have their place.  On the mantle over a low burning fire lay an intricately carved staff on stone rests.  Three branches twisted around each other forming a straight pole about five feet long.  Topping the staff the branches thinned and twisted in a knot that while appearing naturally formed was shaped in a sphere of hooks and bends that drew her eyes, daring them to follow the twists and turns that never seemed to end.  Indeed, she could not find the ends of the three branches though they should have been clearly visible.<br>
&quot;Here you go dear,&quot; the old woman returned, two cups in hand as she placed them on a small table between two chairs.  She motioned both to the tea and the chair as she sat with a quiet sigh.  Greeneyes smiled, not sure what to say, and sat down.<br>
&quot;Oh dear, where are my manners?  Here I let you have a seat and you're still wearing your cloak.&quot;<br>
&quot;No.  It's okay,&quot; Greeneyes said, too defensively perhaps.<br>
&quot;Nonsense, dirt and ash are all part of a traveler's clothing, no need to be ashamed.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes grasped her cloak, suddenly wishing she hadn't come, hadn't intruded on the kindly old woman.  What would she think of the stains beneath the cloak, the blood of innocents and criminal alike?&quot;<br>
The woman then waved off her own request. &quot;Enjoy your tea then dear.  I have a shower shed in the back room.  You can take your time and clean up in privacy if you would prefer.&quot;  Greeneyes felt the old woman looking at her, reading her discomfort and adjusting to it.  Greeneyes had the unnerving feeling the kindly lady could see and feel her shame of the stains she wore.<br>
&quot;My name is Mara by the way dear,&quot; she said as she rose from her seat.  Greeneyes heard no expectation in her voice, but replied anyway.<br>
&quot;Greeneyes.&quot;  She felt embarrassed at her nickname, but had none other to give.<br>
&quot;Interesting name,&quot; Mara said as she disappeared into the other room.  &quot;Enjoy your tea.&quot;<br>
Mara could see right through her, Greeneyes could feel it, but wasn't critical or judgmental and she felt all the more guilty.  The sooner she left this kindly old woman the better.<br>
She sat and drank her tea in silence until Mara returned and made beckoning motions with her hand.  Greeneyes rose, placing her cup on the table and followed her to the back of the house.<br>
&quot;I - I followed some children with torches here,&quot; she said, remembering what brought her here.  &quot;But I haven't seen them since I arrived.  Do they live nearby?&quot;  She felt like she was prying but was curious still.<br>
&quot;Children?  No, the closest children live in Tannor's Stand, just half a mile up the trail.&quot;  Mara waved her hand to a shallow basin of stone that sat just off the floor.  &quot;I doubt any would be this far away from home at night.&quot;<br>
She showed Greeneyes the workings of the faucet and water supply that sprayed gentle streams of water into the basin.  A blind of thin veneer and colored fabric was set around it for privacy.<br>
&quot;And you can wash your clothes in the tub over there and hang them there.&quot;  She pointed each out, as well as the soap and small stove to heat the water if she wished.  &quot;If you have no spare clothes I have some nice dresses I'm afraid don't fit me any more that you may try if you like.  You can put what you do have in the room next to this one.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes started to protest, to say she couldn't stay long and would get a place in town, but Mara wouldn't let her slip a word in.<br>
&quot;Have you eaten yet?  If not you can have some of the soup I've made.&quot;<br>
The mention of food caused her stomach to rumble and her protests were forgotten.  She nodded and smiled.  &quot;Yes, thank you Mara.&quot;<br>
&quot;That's good dear.  Now you get cleaned up, no rush.&quot;  She turned and closed the door behind her, leaving Greeneyes to her thoughts.<br>
Pulling the cloak from her shoulders she inspected it.  Just dirty and covered in ash.  She threw the filthy thing in the broad steel wash tub in the corner then looked at her shirt and pants.<br>
More dirt and ash, but below that the dark brown stains she knew would not come out easily, if at all.  No, even if they came out with a mere shake she knew she could not wear them again.  Pulling off the remnants of her clothing she balled up the shirt, opened the door to the wood stove and tossed it in.  Once it was burned she stuffed in her pants, almost burning herself on the edge of the opening.  The cloth undergarment she wore was dirty but only from the long hours it was worn.  She tossed it in the tub as well.  Opening a spigot she filled the tub with water, then poured a bucket of the heated water from the stove into it as well.  Untying her hair she grabbed the soap and stepped into the basin.<br>
She could barely stand to touch her hair as she let the water run down her head.  After a moment she gave into the cool, soothing flow and stood still, letting the water wash away the grime and sweat.<br>
A band had passed before she was satisfied her hair and body were clean.  In one moment of renewed grief she had scrubbed and scrubbed until her skin was red and tears fell, though not from the physical pain.  She finally stopped, realizing the abuse was not going to rid her of her guilt.  It was not to be that easy.<br>
Kneeling naked by the tub she began to work on the cloak and undergarment.  There was nothing she could do for her boots but scrub them with a brush and leave them to air on the windowsill.  Leaving the two items on a drying line, she chose a patterned green dress from those Mara had shown her and slipped it over her head.<br>
Another half band had passed when she walked in bare feet to find Mara.  The woman was standing by a large wood stove in the kitchen, stirring a pot and humming to herself.<br>
&quot;Feeling better now Greeneyes dear?&quot; she asked, not turning from the pot.<br>
&quot;Much.  I'd like to thank you.  I -&quot; she couldn't find the words she wanted to say.  &quot;I didn't mean to intrude and I'll be gone in the morning.&quot;<br>
&quot;Will you?&quot; Mara said, only then turning to look at her guest.  &quot;On a journey?&quot;<br>
Greeneyes nodded and make an acknowledging sound.<br>
&quot;Well if you must.&quot;  Ladling a bowl of soup she placed it on a countertop near Greeneyes.  &quot;Careful dear, it's hot.  There's a loaf of bread in that box.  Feel free to help yourself.&quot;  She poured herself a bowl and two cups of tea.  &quot;More tea as well.&quot;<br>
She took her meal to a wide windowsill and pushed the window open revealing the small garden Greeneyes had seen when she arrived.  She sliced two pieces of bread and brought them and her meal to the sill, giving Mara one of the slices before tearing off a piece of her own and starting on her soup.<br>
They stood in silence, enjoying the meal.  Greeneyes savored every bite even though she was ravenous.  Again she found she recognized many of the ingredients and spices, surprising Mara with her knowledge.<br>
&quot;Do you grow them in your garden?&quot; she said as she took a bite of bread.<br>
&quot;Most.  Some I get from Tye Basra where it is drier and more suitable to their growth.&quot;<br>
They made small talk all evening and it was near midnight when Greeneyes felt the weight of the day fall upon her shoulders.  She bid Mara goodnight and was asleep as soon as she laid her head upon the bed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://drakksnet.homestead.com/files/Ghost.gif height=50 width=60" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br>  Posts: 1151<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/21/01 5:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=35>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 26</span><hr size=1> Sunlight slowly crept across her face, waking her from the most restful sleep she could remember having in many days.  She rolled lazily out of bed and noticed it was well into the morning.  The house was quiet and Greeneyes wondered where her host had gotten off to when she heard singing through the kitchen window.  She followed the lilting voice through the back door from the kitchen and around the corner of the house.  Mara was in the garden on her knees digging up weeds and pushing the soil back into neat rows.<br>
&quot;Morning dear.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes smiled.  She couldn't seem to catch the elderly matron unawares.<br>
&quot;Morning Mara.&quot;<br>
&quot;I trust your sleep was good.&quot;  She tamped down the soil around a small plant.<br>
&quot;Very.  I think I needed it.&quot;<br>
&quot;Seems so.&quot;  Mara pushed herself up with a grunt and brushed off her hands.  Smiling she waved Greeneyes over and started pointing out the various plants to her guest.<br>
&quot;Oh dear, I missed some.&quot;  She looked with dismay at a patch of palm creepers.  The weed grew a flat greenish-gray blade with spines that branched off to form more 'palm' growths.<br>
&quot;Do me a favor dear and get those for me while I get this one over here.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes nodded, not thinking twice at her sudden promotion from guest to gardener.<br>
The morning passed as they went from weed patch to weed patch, clearing out the stubborn plants.  The garden was much bigger than it had appeared the night before and they spent most of the morning pulling up and pushing back the unwanted flora.  There seemed to be as large a variety of weeds as there were spices and vegetables.  Greeneyes quickly learned how to get around the spines, edges and deep roots that defended the weeds from the women's determined cultivation.  To pass the time they discussed spices, plants and gardening and Mara never missed an opportunity to test her companion's knowledge.  While Mara proved to be her better, Greeneyes made sure she committed as much as she could to memory.<br>
Ever at the back of her mind was her need to continue her journey.  Every time she told herself this, the question 'where' arose.  With no idea of where to find Loreana, Greeneyes decided it might not be such a bad idea to stay for a while.  Mara was apparently enjoying her company and help greatly and Greeneyes found she felt the same.<br>
&quot;Daydreaming dear?&quot;<br>
&quot;Hmm?&quot; she looked up and smiled at Mara.  &quot;I guess so, sorry.&quot;<br>
&quot;No need.  I thought we could take lunch now, but I need a few things.  Do you think we could put it off to make a trip into town?&quot;<br>
Greeneyes nodded.  She was hungry but eager to see Tannor's Stand.<br>
&quot;Fine.  We'll change and then be off.  Wouldn't do to go into town wearing the garden dirt.&quot;<br>
The young woman nodded.  All of her spare clothes had been lost with her pack and she didn't feel right borrowing Mara's.  She had carried a good amount of coin under her cloak and knew she would be able to afford what she needed.  One dress, a summer affair of beautiful blue Pippen had chosen for her, brought a fresh tear to her eye.  How was he?  Did he miss her?  Would he be angry with her for leaving him?<br>
Blue.<br>
Sapphire blue.<br>
&quot;Oh Pippen.  I'm so sorry.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tannor's Stand was a small but pleasant farming and trades town.  A market took up most of the square at the town's center.  Marking that center was a life size bronze casting of the town's founder and namesake, Joseph Tannor.  A logger by trade, he had taken the few families in the original settlement and defended their homes against a tribe of Gruhelan, smaller cousins of the Gruagan.  The Gruhelan had taken an immediate dislike to their new neighbors and tried their best to drive the humans out using everything from fear to murder.  Loosing his wife and children to the ruthless creatures only strengthened his resolve and determination to make the settlement a safe place for those who followed him.  They eventually succeeded and now their descendents proudly proclaimed to all who came to Tannor's Stand that not a single Gruhelan had been sighted in over a hundred years.<br>
<br>
Greeneyes listened to Mara recite the town's history as they strolled through the market.  Making their way casually through the stalls and booths, Greeneyes noted the atmosphere was much more relaxed than the market in Miera Kiy.  No rushing, no yelling, only bright eyes and friendly greetings from the farmers and merchants they met.  The younger woman found more suitable clothing and shoes while Mara found a garden tool, some kitchen utensils and two small potted plants.  These she gave to Greeneyes as she approached a small cartload of apples. , She smiled and handed the farmer her money as she placed a dozen of the bright red fruit in the basket he handed her.  No sooner had the coin changed hands than a group of children materialized out of the crowd.  A dozen or so girls and boys, all not yet in their adolescent years, waved and laughed as they crowded Mara.  She returned their waves and joked with them while handing out the apples just purchased.  With each one bouncing and grinning between bites, the children waved and shouted goodbye, disappearing as fast as they had appeared.<br>
&quot;They do that every time,&quot; Mara explained to her grinning friend.  &quot;I gave a couple of them apples once and from there -&quot; she shrugged with a happy sigh.  &quot;It's wonderful.  They're all so happy.  I'm never sure how many will show, but so far I've never run out of apples.&quot;  She waved as the last one ran from sight then grabbed an apple for herself.  &quot;Take one dear, they're quite good.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes took one and bit down.  Juice ran down her chin, escaping her cupped hand.  &quot;Mmm, my favorite.&quot;<br>
The next day came and Greeneyes found herself happily jumping into the many small tasks and chores Mara had not been able to take care of herself.  They enjoyed each other's company and Mara always took the time to pass her considerable knowledge to her guest-turned-gardener-turned-student in a way that made Greeneyes hungry for more.<br>
<br>
Two more days found Greeneyes growing more comfortable with Mara and life in general.  She had not mentioned her troubles or her quest and Mara had not asked.  Pippen came to her thoughts often, but she knew she couldn't send for him, or even write.  Every time she thought about it the image of the ill-fated Kaskell Trader train came to her mind, and she knew it was the right choice to leave him behind... or was it?  Perhaps she shouldn't stay with Mara.<br>
&quot;Greeneyes dear, come here.&quot;  Mara called her to the front of the house that afternoon.  &quot;I want to show you something.&quot;  The tone in her voice was mysterious and piqued the young woman's curiosity.<br>
Mara was kneeling by one of the plants she had purchased at the market.  It was wilted and didn't look like it would live long.  Mara waved her down to the ground.<br>
&quot;I was going to transplant this little one in a few days to one of the flower gardens but a warrow beetle got to it first.&quot;<br>
&quot;Warrow beetle?&quot;<br>
&quot;It chews on the stem near the roots.  One bite is enough to infect and eventually kill the plant.&quot;  She reached into her dress and pulled out two small pouches.  &quot;Hold this one.&quot;  Mara took the remaining pouch and dropped two small sprigs into her hand.  Grinding one in her fingers she sprinkled it through the tiny leaves of the other onto the suffering plant.  Speaking gentle words that her wondering student couldn't understand, she then ground up the second sprig and sat back on her feet.<br>
Greeneyes took a sharp breath inward as she felt magic flowing around and through her.  Not like her craft with its dark malignancy, but an energy that was clean, refreshing - alive.  She closed her eyes and grinned as she felt the magic stream into the plant to destroy the infection and rebuild the growth bringing color back to the plant's leaves.<br>
Mara was watching her with a scrutiny the younger woman didn't feel.  Greeneyes looked up at her and smiled like a child just gifted with an apple.<br>

Kyturn gathered the moisture from his sister's breath and lay it upon his brother's foundation to create the seas.<br>

<br>
Mara sat with Greeneyes within the small circle of trees that lay a hundred paces behind the Druid's home.  Greeneyes smiled at the peace she felt sitting there.<br>
&quot;Everything around you has a little bit of the Walker of the Wood's spirit in it.  A small part of each god makes up everything you see.  Without Gaervalen though, it would only be cold rock, still waters and dead air.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes cocked her head and looked at Mara.  &quot;You said five.&quot;<br>
Mara nodded and looked down briefly.  &quot;The fifth, Dierguroth.  Once his siblings were done with creation, he saw that there was nothing left for him and they would not share with their dark brother.&quot;  She looked up at the trees.  &quot;So he chose, instead, the end of everything.  Darkness.  War.  Death.  He sought to twist, defile, and destroy everything the other gods had created.&quot;  Mara smiled at her student.  &quot;As you can see though, even in this Gaervalen creates anew.  From death and decay springs life, and summer yet follows winter.  This is Gaervalen's promise to us.  That life will always prevail.  I am only a small part of that, as you will be if you wish.&quot;<br>
<br>
So much life, so much energy devoted to helping and healing.  Greeneyes found the contrast to her own craft helped her fight off the darkness that seethed within her and she strove to learn all she could of the Green God's ways and magic.  The battle was difficult though.  Gaervalen's magic opened a conduit her own craft fought to travel.  Greeneyes learned to push back the Sapphire Witch's magic and welcome that of the Walker's.<br>
Mara first taught her simple dweomers and mundane skills concerning plants and animals.  The well being of these led to the greater health of the forest and life over all.  Simple herbs and other natural ingredients could be used to create potions and balms that would cure and heal.  Greeneyes was naturally adept at their creation and loved the searches Mara would task her with to find these items.  The young woman became more attuned to the life around her and this helped her further with the battle in her soul.<br>
Only one thing troubled her.  While Mara had a natural rapport with the animals of the surrounding area, Greeneyes did not.  The animals sensed the stain upon her spirit and shied from her whenever she tried to approach.  The fear in their eyes broke her heart and Mara said it would pass in time, but Greeneyes knew it would not.<br>
The student did well though.  As harvest came, Greeneyes felt more attuned to nature and felt less of the darkness that once enveloped her life.  Mara showed her how Gaervalen's children prepared for winter, how they knew to store what they needed to renew life once the gray of winter passed.<br>
<br>
Greeneyes left Mara in the market to purchase more of the dye she found worked well to conceal the white stripe in her hair.  More habit than anything, she still remembered Dundare's warning and continued to heed it.  Her quest was the one topic that was never broached in all the time she had been with Mara.  Mara never indicated a desire to learn of Greeneyes' past or what had brought her here and the young woman was very grateful of it.  She still felt the guilt over leaving Pippen, but as always she thought of how she had betrayed Pippen and herself by allowing the craft to surface and she was glad he had not been there to see it... or worse.<br>
<br>
Mara gave her money to the grinning farmer.  There wouldn't be too many more times before winter that the apples would be available, and they both enjoyed the happy chaos that always followed Mara's purchases.<br>
&quot;I already see 'em comin' Mara.&quot;<br>
&quot;I know.  Soon they'll be gathering at your stand before I get to market.&quot;  She smiled back, steeling herself for the pre-adolescent assault.<br>
&quot;Mara! Mara! Mara!&quot;  The calls of almost a dozen children rang out through the market as they all rushed in.<br>
&quot;Calm down, calm down.  Always enough for everyone.&quot; the druid motioned to the excited children.  &quot;How is everyone today?  Tanya?  Willy?  Cess?&quot;<br>
Amid the replies of 'Fine' and 'Ok' the one called Cessara, Cess to her friends, piped up.<br>
&quot;It's Lora's birthday!&quot;  The little blond girl received a punch in the arm by the girl with the long, chestnut hair standing next to her.<br>
&quot;I told you not to tell,&quot; she hissed back.<br>
Heedless, Mara beamed back at the girls.  &quot;Lora, do I know a Lora?&quot;  As the children pointed at the green-eyed child Mara felt a tingle run down her spine.<br>
&quot;You're Lora?  I thought I'd seen you before.  And how old are you today?&quot;<br>
&quot;Eleven,&quot; she said in a subdued voice.  Something in her manner, perhaps the dark rings around her eyes concerned the woman.<br>
&quot;Eleven.  Such a fine age.  Almost grown up now.&quot;  Mara produced two apples from her basket.  &quot;For the birthday girl, two of my best apples.&quot;<br>
Lora took them with a tentative smile, then gave the old woman a hug and kiss on the cheek before running off into the market.<br>
Mara looked after her then handed out the rest of the apples.  &quot;Better run off and catch her Cess, she might loose you.&quot;<br>
&quot;Nah,&quot; the little blond replied as she bit into her apple.  &quot;I know where she's going.&quot;  She slapped one of the boys and ran off after her friend.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm fine, I'm fine.&quot;  Greeneyes held off the merchant who had run to his customer out of concern.  The woman was looking at some of his soaps and dyes when she collapsed, almost knocking over the bin.  She appeared fine now, but her basket lay where she had dropped it as she rushed out the store.<br>
Greeneyes found Mara and looked about frantically.<br>
&quot;My dear, what's wrong?&quot;  Mara looked worriedly at her student.<br>
&quot;Was there a little girl here?&quot;  She was struggling to catch her breath.<br>
&quot;Why, several.  You know how they do love the apples.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes tried to form her words as she looked at Mara.  &quot;No. Uhm, brown hair, green eyes.&quot;<br>
Mara expected this, but didn't know why.<br>
&quot;Yes there was, Lora her friend said her name was.  It was her birthday.  Her -&quot;<br>
&quot;Eleventh birthday,&quot; Mara nodded as Greeneyes finished her sentence.  &quot;Where is she?  Where did she go?&quot;  She was still breathless.<br>
&quot;Calm down child.&quot;  Mara placed a hand on her arm.  &quot;Let's go back.  You can explain everything to me there.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes looked at her as her breath calmed and heart steadied.  &quot;Everything?&quot;<br>
&quot;Everything.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://drakksnet.homestead.com/files/Ghost.gif height=50 width=60" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br>  Posts: 1153<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/21/01 5:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=37>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 28</span><hr size=1> &quot;But I don't understand how I ended up here.  Exactly where she and her mother moved two years ago.&quot;  Greeneyes had poured out her story to the druid.  The memories, the nightmares fresh in her mind for the first time in a long while.<br>
&quot;You said yourself dear, you have a connection.  A connection stronger than that of a mother and child.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes nodded and sipped from her cup.  She had started shaking again once they returned to Mara's home.  So much time had passed since she last saw through Loreana's eyes.  Mara's tea helped calm her nerves and clear her thoughts.  Finally her hands stopped shaking.<br>
&quot;I've got to see her again, to talk to her.&quot;<br>
&quot;Why?&quot;  Mara asked pointedly.  Her chin rested lightly between her fingers as she captured the young woman'' eyes with her own.<br>
&quot;Why?&quot;  Greeneyes didn't know, exactly.  She couldn't put the reason into easy words.<br>
&quot;What would you say to her?  Children's memories are fragile things, easily manipulated.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes sighed heavily.  &quot;Every time I've seen her, she's been ripped away, before I can even think.&quot;  Again her hands helped form her words.  &quot;If I just had the chance to be near her, to get past the visions, the attacks.  If I can just look into her eyes.&quot;  She broke Mara's gaze to stare at her feet.  &quot;I don't know.  I don't know anything.  But maybe a piece of the puzzle will be revealed if I can just do that.&quot;<br>
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Mara said cautiously.  &quot;But maybe you'll loose them again.  The mother, Merrie, was already distraught when you and your Master Pippen called that day.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes nodded, embarrassed. <br>
&quot;And when you had the attack after the girl touched you, Pippen said Merrie lost control and screamed for you to leave.&quot;  Mara waited for Greeneyes to look up at her again.  &quot;You scared her, as I would imagine any mother would be frightened.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes sat, silenced by Mara's words.<br>
&quot;You don't know how Loreana was affected.  A nine-year-old's mind might bury something like that so deeply she'll never remember even meeting you.&quot;  The druid shrugged.  &quot;She might not anyway.&quot;<br>
&quot;But the connection is still there Mara.  Something will happen.&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm sure dear, but can you deal with it when it does?&quot;<br>
<br>
Loreana cut her second apple in half and gave one to Cessara.<br>
&quot;Why does my birthday have to be today?&quot; she asked, waiting for the world to answer.<br>
&quot;'Cause that's when you were born, stupid,&quot; Cess replied between bites.<br>
&quot;Ugh.  I know that.  But I didn't ask to be born today.&quot;  She threw the apple half from her seat on the log behind Old Man Pretcher's store.  &quot;I didn't ask for my daddy to die either.&quot;<br>
Cess looked at her toes.  She was never sure what to say when her friend brought up her dad's death.  Cess had never known her father.  He had died in a shipwreck on the Miera just a month after she was born.  More than anything, it was the emptiness she shared with Loreana that had brought them together as friends.<br>
&quot;So we can move your birthday,&quot; Cess offered unsurely.<br>
&quot;Nah,&quot; Loreana replied after a few moment's of thought.  &quot;Doesn't matter.  Let's go.&quot;  She got up with Cess following close behind as the world of make-believe overcame the nightmares of the real world.<br>
<br>
Mara convinced Greeneyes that waiting was the best course of action.  They would go back to the market the day after the morrow.  Mara would need some more flour by then anyway.<br>
'So close,' thought Greeneyes.  She couldn't sit still, couldn't sleep.  Mara shooed her back to bed when she found the young woman standing outside the front door at midnight, shivering and staring at the sky.<br>
No sooner had Greeneyes finished her breakfast the next morning than Mara had her in the garden, transplanting several rows of plants to pots so they could be brought inside for the winter.<br>
She knew the druid was keeping her busy with the chores, but she enjoyed the mind numbing work.  By evening she was so tired she bid Mara good night and threw herself into bed, barely taking the time to undress.<br>
On the second morning, Greeneyes was the epitome of patience.  After showering she went about breakfast and morning chores calmly and efficiently.  Mara couldn't help but grin at the energy that radiated from her student.  Greeneyes fairly vibrated with anxiousness, all the while outwardly displaying the calmest of demeanors.<br>
She was scared.  Scared of so much right now.  Scared Loreana wouldn't be there, scared she would.  Scared she'd frighten the girl off and scared she be overcome by visions or stricken like before.  Terrified and excited all at once.<br>
&quot;Calm down dear, you'll spook half the town looking like you do.&quot;  Mara and her student walked down the road to Tannor's Stand.  Recite the prayers I've taught you.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes nodded and silently chanted the prayer to Gaervalen that calmed and focused her mind before using the god's magic.  As always, it worked, and she was in control of herself when they arrived in town.<br>
<br>
&quot;She's here.&quot;<br>
&quot;Who?&quot; Cess asked as she hopped over a basket of candles, grinning mischievously at the merchant's shouted warning.<br>
&quot;The green-eyed lady.&quot;<br>
&quot;I thought you were the green-eyed lady.&quot;<br>
&quot;No silly.  You know, the one I talked about.&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't remember,&quot; Cess replied as she kicked a pebble in Lora's direction.<br>
&quot;You never remember,&quot; the rock was kicked back.<br>
&quot;So where is she then smarty?&quot; the rock was returned but kicked wide and ignored.<br>
&quot;With Mara.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh!&quot;  Cess's eyes lit up.  &quot;I've seen her a couple of times.  Didn't know she had green eyes.  I like her hair though.  It's long like yours.&quot;<br>
&quot;C'mon, race you to Mara.  Last one there gets the rotten apple.&quot;<br>
This was the happiest Cess had seen her friend in days and she was glad.  She hated it when Lora was in one of her moods, and they always seemed to last forever.  Especially after she had one of her nightmares.  Cess didn't know what the big deal was.  She had nightmares every now and then, but they didn't scare her.  At least, not for days.<br>
She raced through the streets toward the market after Lora.  She could beat Lora most of the time, but her friend had a head start and acted like she really wanted to win.  Couldn't let that happen, could she?<br>
<br>
&quot;She's here.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ok dear, but be calm.  Say the - Gaervalen's mercy.&quot;<br>
Mara was stunned.  Loreana came racing around the corner, followed closely by the blond girl, and came to a sudden halt a score of paces away from them.  Stunned by what she felt, what she almost saw flow between them when their eyes met.  Connection could only begin to describe what was between the girl and the young woman.  Lora approached slowly until she was five paces from the women.<br>
&quot;Hello green-eyed lady.&quot;  Lora said quietly.  Cess and Mara stood back a bit, each at their own level knowing something important was happening.<br>
&quot;Hello Loreana.  Do you remember me?&quot;<br>
A nod.  &quot;From Miera Kiy at my house.  You got sick.&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm sorry if I scared you.&quot;<br>
&quot;I wasn't scared,&quot; Loreana shook her head slowly.  &quot;Mommy was though.&quot;<br>
&quot;I didn't mean to.  How is your mommy?&quot;<br>
The child shuffled her feet and watched the dirt stir beneath them.  &quot;Ok I guess.  She's still sad about Daddy dying.&quot;  She raised her green eyes to the woman's.  &quot;Are you still sad too?&quot;<br>
The question shook her.  She was, she found, sad over Brian's death.  The feeling was buried deeply.  Had she loved him once?<br>
&quot;Yes Loreana, yes I am.&quot;<br>
&quot;I told Mommy you were.  I saw it in your head.&quot;<br>
In her head.  Gods she hoped the child hadn't seen the other images that had been there when they touched.  Greeneyes backed up a step, then caught herself.<br>
&quot;Mommy said I shouldn't talk to you, after your fit.&quot;  Lora stared at the ground again.  &quot;She said you were crazy.&quot;<br>
&quot;Does your mommy know I'm here?&quot;  Greeneyes didn't know if she could stand to loose them again.<br>
Loreana shook her head, a few strands of hair fell across one eye.  &quot;In Miera Kiy, before we left.&quot;  She moved the offending lock and caught the woman's eyes again.  Greeneyes was chilled at the sudden maturity she saw in the child's dark-ringed eyes.<br>
&quot;I won't tell her.  It'd just make her mad again.&quot;  She glanced over at Cessara and back at Greeneyes, her eyes again those of an eleven year old little girl.  &quot;I gotta go.  See you later.&quot;  She turned on her heels shouting, &quot;Bye Mara,&quot; before running back the way she had come.  Cess stood there for a moment, unsure of what just happened and what to do.<br>
She finally waved at Mara, &quot;Bye Mara,&quot; then looked shyly at Greeneyes, &quot;I like your hair,&quot; before disappearing between the shops. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://drakksnet.homestead.com/files/Ghost.gif height=50 width=60" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br>  Posts: 1154<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/21/01 5:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=38>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 29</span><hr size=1> &quot;Tell me Mara.  Tell me it's nothing.  Tell me it's coincidence, my imagination.&quot;  Greeneyes knelt near the center of Gaervalen's shrine.  This time the peace of the small circle of trees could not soothe her.<br>
&quot;I can tell you little dear.&quot;  Mara sighed and looked past the trees into the sky and said a silent prayer.  &quot;Only that it is none of those.  Your life is truly connected with hers, your <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Seha</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, your spirit, with hers.&quot; She knelt by Greeneyes and placed a hand on her student's.  &quot;And as such, your destinies.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes looked up at the druid, expectation filling her eyes.<br>
&quot;Do not pursue it though,&quot; she continued.  &quot;It will come to you.  She is only a child, she wouldn't understand.&quot;  Mara gazed at the trees.  &quot;What may seem like clarity, understanding on her part is merely innocence.  She doesn't understand.  The connection between you is there, but she couldn't tell you how or why.  If she is your daughter she doesn't know it.&quot;  She hesitated.  &quot;Would you want her to know this Sapphire witch?&quot;  Greeneyes shot her gaze at Mara.  &quot;You cannot pursue her.&quot;  Mara sighed at the difficult words.  &quot;She may have been saved from you.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes shook her head as tears came to her eyes.<br>
&quot;If this woman was as evil as you say, the child may have been in great danger.&quot;<br>
More tears fell as Greeneyes continued to shake her head.  Whispers of 'No, no.' came to her lips.<br>
&quot;Can someone of such evil love a child?  Brian loved this child, loved her enough perhaps to do what was necessary to save her?&quot;<br>
Greeneyes looked away as tears fell.  It wasn't true.  She didn't want to hurt Loreana.  How could she possibly hurt her?<br>
&quot;The Sapphire witch cannot be allowed to have this child.&quot;<br>
&quot;It's not me!&quot;<br>
&quot;Do not pursue her.&quot;<br>
&quot;You don't know this!&quot;<br>
&quot;Do not let the Sapphire witch have her!&quot;<br>
&quot;No!&quot;  Gods, she felt the fire welling up inside her.<br>
&quot;Do not let the witch have her!  Do not let the Sapphire witch control you!&quot;<br>
&quot;Mara!&quot;  The power flared behind her eyes, the air around them began to move in answer.<br>
&quot;Hold her!  Control her!  Do not let the magic overwhelm you!&quot;  Mara watched her student while working her own magic.  Protective magic. Just in case.<br>
&quot;Mara, help me.  Gaervalen, help me.&quot;  Greeneyes clenched her fists tightly, eyes squeezing shut in effort to quell her craft.<br>
&quot;Look to yourself!  Gaervalen can help only so much.  You must control the witch!  You must control her magic!&quot;  Mara felt Greeneyes pushing the craft back, controlling it.  The air slowed, then died.<br>
<br>
Slowly Greeneyes unclenched her fists and opened her eyes.  &quot;Why did you do that?&quot;  Mara heard the pain in her voice.<br>
&quot;Do what child?&quot;  Mara looked compassionately at the woman.  &quot;Show you that you can control this power you fear so much?&quot;  She drew closer.  &quot;Show you that lives other than your own are at stake?&quot;<br>
Greeneyes looked down at her knees, ashamed.<br>
&quot;One child is worth more than all of us combined.  If I thought you were a true threat to Loreana you would have never met.&quot;  Greeneyes stared at Mara, unsure of her meaning.  &quot;Yes, I felt the power between you, before that day in the market when you came running to me, asking of a green-eyed little girl.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes jaw fell open.  She couldn't believe the words she heard.<br>
Mara sat back and shook her head.  &quot;I never suspected the connection was so strong, not until I saw you together.&quot;  Mara looked at her again, catching her gaze.  &quot;I felt the darkness that lived in you, from the moment we met, but I knew you would do no harm.&quot;  The druid looked down.  &quot;Not intentionally.  That's why, after today -&quot; Mara clasped her hands and stared at the circle of trees.  &quot;I had to be sure.  I had to test you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Greeneyes sat there silently.  Was she a threat to Loreana?  Could she possibly hurt the child she sought so fiercely?  She thought of the innocent people of the wagon train, of Liza and Daniel.  Could she control the magic?  At Dundare's home and now here she had, before the craft had even surfaced.  She could do it.  She would have to do it.  Greeneyes peered at Mara.  The druid was much more than she appeared.  Her warnings were to be heeded. <br>
&quot;But everything has led me here, to her.&quot;  Greeneyes wiped the remaining tears away.  &quot;How can I just give up now?  I'm so close, I feel it.  I can't just let her go now.&quot;<br>
&quot;You don't have to Greeneyes dear.  I said don't pursue her.&quot;  The druid sighed at her student's uncomprehending stare.  &quot;Your destinies are intertwined.&quot;  She produced the staff Greeneyes had seen sitting on the mantel.  Mara hadn't brought it out with her.<br>
&quot;Like Gaervalen's staff, the twistwood branches intertwine, drawing life and strength from each other.&quot;  She held the staff to show the knot at the top.  &quot;Until they meet, joined together.  She will come to you, given time.  I don't know how I know this, but I do, I feel it.&quot;  Mara laid the staff gently across her knees and placed a hand on Greeneyes shoulder.  &quot;Give her a chance.  She's young.  Let her have her time now.  When your destinies join -&quot; She shook her head and traced a finger around the never ending knot.  &quot;She will have to grow up very quickly.  Very quickly indeed.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So what do you want to be when you grow up?&quot;  Cess looked at Lora as she pondered her friend's question.   They stood by the stream that meandered near the southern edge of town.  The two girls came here often to throw pebbles and sticks, or just to watch the ripples as the water bounced off rocks and weeds, making its way to a distant lake or sea.  They could stay here for hours, far away from the boys, far away from their lives.  A special place just for friends.<br>
&quot;I don't know.&quot;  Cess tossed a rock at a passing branch.  &quot;Queen of Torain.  Cessara Tulsforth the first.&quot;  She straightened her back and took on a regal countenance.<br>
&quot;Yea, but you're not a Tulsforth,&quot; Lora countered, bowing to her mock queen.<br>
&quot;Queen Sherra can adopt me to be her successor.&quot;  She held out her hand to be kissed.<br>
&quot;Only a true-born Tulsforth can take the crown, and she has two daughters.&quot;  Lora held the hand to her forehead and jerked back, laughing.<br>
Cess fell forward, crying out in surprise and continued, laughing, as she took Lora to the ground with her.  &quot;Well, I suppose I'll have to do away with them,&quot; she said, rolling off Lora and setting her head up on her hand.<br>
&quot;Shh, you'll get in trouble for saying that,&quot; Lora whispered seriously as she rolled over to face Cess.<br>
Cess, subdued, picked at some convenient blades of grass, &quot;So what do you want to be?&quot;<br>
Loreana shrugged.  &quot;Maybe an adventurer like my mom.  Or a wizard, like the one in the tower in Miera Kiy.&quot;  She twined her hair around her fingers.  &quot;Then I could do anything.  I could turn Sarah into a lizard.&quot;<br>
Cess giggled at the thought of their mutual nemesis, Sarah Cordont, with a long forked tongue and a tail you could yank off.<br>
&quot;Or turn Jerem into a toad,&quot; Lora said, speaking of her mom's boyfriend.  Merrie had known the big man when she was Lora's age and coming back here had brought him back into her life.<br>
<br>
Lora didn't like him.  He rarely smiled except for one of his strange jokes that only he and her mom understood.  Many mornings he stank of ale.  This she knew because he had moved into her mom's room.  Lora hated him because he wasn't her dad, she hated him because he made her mom mad and sad all at the same time and she hated him for the way he looked at her like she was in the way.<br>
&quot;Or a bug.&quot;<br>
Cess looked down at her fingers.  Lora was getting into one of her 'moods' again.  &quot;My mom says Mara knows magic,&quot; Cess said, hoping to cheer her friend up, or at least change the subject.  &quot;She says she's a witch.&quot;<br>
Loreana shook her head, &quot;Mom says she's a druid.  Worships Gargamel or somebody.&quot;  She rolled over on her back and stared up at the clouds.  Cess mimicked her.  &quot;The green-eyed lady knows magic too.&quot;<br>
&quot;How do you know.&quot;<br>
Lora shrugged, &quot;She just does.  She's powerful.&quot;<br>
Cess made a disparaging noise.  &quot;Yea right.  She's a wizard or a witch come here to enslave our dunghill of a town.&quot;<br>
Loreana rolled her head toward Cess and spoke in a deep and mysterious tone.  &quot;You never know.&quot;<br>
Both girls broke out laughing and, much to Cessara's relief, moved onto lighter topics like clouds and the distant songs of birds. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://drakksnet.homestead.com/files/Ghost.gif height=50 width=60" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br>  Posts: 1155<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/21/01 5:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=39>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 30</span><hr size=1> &quot;Takarap Moradan, the last of the riders has returned.&quot;  The dwarven Aron reported to his superior.<br>
Moradan Breldhimmer sighed and wrapped the reins of his mount tightly around his fist.  It had been too easy.  &quot;Casualties Takaron?&quot;  He knew the answer.<br>
&quot;None.&quot;  Denger looked at his Arap.  It was good there were no deaths in their skirmish with the Dak-Kaskan forces, but he also knew that the ease with which their Bakraga Calvary overran the human and guerga indicated there was something else in the works.<br>
&quot;This incompetence is uncommon, even amongst the dirt crawlers.&quot;  He used the derisive term commonly used to describe enemy infantry.  &quot;Either they've lost their Arak to sickness or infighting, or they seek a diversion.&quot;  He clasped Denger on the shoulder, &quot;Ensure my Tak remain ready to ride and keep the bakraga warm.  We may be called upon again.  I will report to Gandrom and see what he plans.&quot;<br>
Dengar nodded as Moradan pulled the reins to circle his bakraga mount around Dengar's and entered the tunnel beneath the dwarven outpost.  The great lizard huffed once as it touched muzzles with Dengar's mount before trotting off in the bakraga's unusual six-legged shuffle.<br>
Bred centuries before from a common form of basilisk, the bakraga shared its distant cousin's gliding gate, strong jaws, and good eyesight while gaining five times the size and loosing the poison glands in its lungs.  Moradan's ancestors had seen the potential in the basilisk, and being immune to its paralyzing breath, set out to create what was now the mounts for the Tak, the Dwarven Calvary.<br>
Dengar closed his eyes and let the music of the Stones wash over him.  This minor battle would not be added to the Story.  Skirmishes with the Dak-Kaskan's were common, though more frequent of late.  The Dwarven Takaron knew there was more to come.  A dark cloud was forming on the horizon and Dengar knew in his heart that many tales would be added to the story the Telling Stones sang.  Dengar Stongrim feared that some would be neither glorious nor happy.<br>
<br>
Dempurgast Mangst marched through the doors of the Duke's study, ignoring the two humans who stood guard, and landed heavily in the immense teak chair next to Sandrak Desmane.<br>
&quot;The fool Ormond got himself pushed out of the pass by the little scrags.  He took heavy losses during his cowardly retreat.&quot;  The osanni hefted his huge feet onto the table and crossed them.<br>
Duke Desmane placed a marker in the tome he had been reading, something on ancient politics Mangst noticed, and placed his hands behind his head.  &quot;I know.  He chose his own tactics in place of mine.&quot;  Desmane sighed heavily and looked at his old friend.  &quot;Send to him my dissatisfaction and our alternate plan.&quot;<br>
The giant nodded as he heard Desmane's mental call for Testraka, another of his Lieutenants and friends.  Only a minute passed before the huge ruga ducked his head through the door.  The troll's corded muscles rippled beneath a thick, gray hide that looked more like stony rubble than flesh.<br>
&quot;Ever attentive to the rapping on the door to my mind, I answer as always,&quot; he grinned broadly, revealing double rows of glistening spikes.<br>
&quot;And as ever am I grateful old friend.  I have a mission for you and your troops.&quot;  Testraka nodded, waiting for the Duke's words.  &quot;General Ormond has taken it upon himself to change our tactics against the Dernalg Pass dwarves.  Though I'd like to believe it is simple incompetence, Demp and I expected this to occur.  Ormond will be given alternate orders that I am sure he will ignore.  Position your strike guard high in the pass and when he fails, capture him and take command.  Once the dwarven fort falls, ensure you make his execution quite visible.  Then feel free to allow those troops who live to sample the larder for the remainder of the day.  Demp will give you the plan and the names of those who support Ormond.  Ensure they disappear quietly and permanently.<br>
The troll grinned again.  &quot;I will ensure your dissatisfaction is very apparent to him before his demise Desmane.&quot; <br>
Sandrak matched Testraka's grin, &quot;I'm sure you will, I'm sure you will.&quot;<br>
The ruga made a farewell gesture and carried his lanky frame back out the door, baring his teeth and growling at the two guards.  They both chuckled nervously and saluted him before returning to their motionless stance. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://drakksnet.homestead.com/files/Ghost.gif height=50 width=60" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br>  Posts: 1156<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/21/01 5:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=40>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 31</span><hr size=1> Rorak was late.  Again.<br>
Gelfref rubbed the heel of his palm in one eye.  Eight bands on sentry was bad enough, but he always seemed to have Rorak as his relief.  And Rorak was always late.<br>
&quot;Drunken sot,&quot; he mumbled sleepily.  Well past ninth band, with his stomach growling angrily and his eyelids heavy, Gelfref shifted his feet and leaned against the outer doorway that ultimately led to the Duke's chambers.<br>
&quot;I don't imagine your Duke would be well pleased with you.&quot;<br>
Gelfref started violently and fumbled with the hilt of his sword.  Looking up, his eyes grew wide at the man standing before him.<br>
&quot;H-H-High Priest, forgive me.  I-&quot; He was a dead-man, he knew it.  Caught sleeping by a High Priest.  But he had never seen this one before.  He almost groaned aloud.  Even better, a visiting High Priest.  He may as well get a shovel now.<br>
&quot;The-the Duke was not expecting visitors Your Eminence.  Who may I say is calling?&quot;  Dead, dead, dead.<br>
&quot;Actually, he is expecting me and you may not say.  Take me to him.&quot;  The simp's fear was delicious, and disgusting.  Is this what the Duke held as a palace guard?<br>
Gelfref kept his protest to himself.  Perhaps his failing would not be revealed if he took the Priest swiftly to the Duke.<br>
<br>
Gelfref only stared at the two guards that stood outside Desmane's study.  They read the look in his eyes, then saw the High Priest and wisely stood aside.<br>
&quot;Duke, you have a visitor, a High Priest.  H-he said you were expecting him.  He-&quot;<br>
&quot;Thank you Gelfref.  Close the doors on your way out.&quot;  Duke Desmane rose from his chair and rounded the table as Ror entered the chamber.  &quot;And Gelfref...&quot;<br>
&quot;D-Duke?&quot;<br>
&quot;Rorak and you will immediately resolve this issue yourselves.&quot;  Desmane's eyes narrowed.  &quot;Do not again give me the option or I will let Testraka choose a resolution.  Do I have your understanding?&quot;<br>
Gelfref didn't know whether to be relieved or terrified.  He chose relieved.  &quot;Completely Duke.&quot;  He bowed and drew the double doors closed behind him, leaving Cruzaz Ror and Sandrak Desmane to whatever purpose had brought them together.<br>
<br>
&quot;Merciful of you,&quot; Ror noted dryly.<br>
Desmane raised an eyebrow at the Priest's comment.  &quot;I find my methods are very effective.  How I choose to-&quot;<br>
Ror waved his hand dismissively.  &quot;Forgive my impertinence Duke.  They are, of course, yours to command.&quot;<br>
Desmane turned and walked back to the head of the table.  Only after the Duke shifted comfortably in his chair did he motion silently, inviting the High Priest to join him.<br>
Ror nodded and swirled his robe aside to sit in a nearby chair.  &quot;I understand your skirmishes with the minions of the stone god go well?&quot;<br>
They didn't.  Desmane knew the priest was aware of that.  The conflict, it could not be truly called a war, had gone on for over two centuries.  Only in the past fifteen years had Desmane been able to gather the misfit tribes of humanoids and ragged humans into anything resembling an army.  He had done well enough, they were sufficiently trained and what they lacked in skill they made up for in enthusiasm.  That was his secret.  Those who served the Duke of Dak-Kaska-Tar faithfully were well cared for.  No matter what form that service took, from farmer to craftsman to warrior, his servants and their families lived as well as anyone could be expected to in these dreary lands.  Those who chose not to serve were not persecuted, not specifically, but they were shunned and left with little support.  The Duke made the choice easy and rewarding.  The rewards were diminishing though.  The battles with the Dwarves ultimately came to stalemate, both sides gaining little and loosing only a little more.  Down the road the Duke saw only more war, with his dwindling resources and the Dwarves dwindling numbers.  At this rate, victory was not within his lifetime.<br>
&quot;The scales are balanced.&quot;  Desmane pushed aside a large tome.  &quot;I seek something to tip that balance in my favor... in Dierguroth's favor.&quot;  The Duke made an effort to keep the eagerness out of his voice.  He had searched five years for the location of the Circlet.  Every time that search ended up empty.  Only the vision granted by the Lord of The Black revealed the one who knew its location.  The High Priest would want payment in return for the use of the artifact.  &quot;Something you hold.  The Circlet of Mists.&quot;<br>
Cruzaz Ror smiled faintly, he was just as eager as the Shadow Knight was.  &quot;That is the crux of the deal we have been drawn into by our Lord.&quot;  He fingered the amulet around his neck absently.  &quot;I need the Circlet to further the Prophecy, you have the means to retrieve it and a purpose for it as well.&quot;<br>
So that was it.  Ror knew where it was but couldn't reach it.  Desmane had studied the Prophecy of the Avatar.  The Prophecy served him no purpose, but the Circlet could be put to certain use in his war against the Dwarves.  The diminutive race was their god's strength.  Their destruction would in turn weaken Dierguroth's nemesis.  The gods played their games and with the Circlet of Mists Duke Desmane would be a major piece in that game.  Favor and power would follow his success.  Even if Ror managed to fulfill his Prophecy, the Duke's part in it combined with the destruction of the Dwarven race would solidify his favor with the Dark God even further.<br>
&quot;What means would a lowly knight have that a High Priest does not?&quot;  Sandrak Desmane grinned, wanting to inject one last meaningless barbed comment.<br>
&quot;Why, the power one such as yourself holds.&quot;  Now Ror smiled thinly.  &quot;Muscle.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dempurgast Mangst looked down on the Priest.  Sandrak had tasked the giant with ensuring the High Priest did not abuse the workers placed under his power.  Years of watching Desmane deal with those he commanded had convinced Demp his friend knew how to motivate men and humanoid alike.  Great rewards for success shadowed great punishment for failure.  The Shadow Knight knew that if the workers gathered for the excavation of the Circlet were pushed like slaves, the hold on his lands would be greatly weakened.  He had made great progress in gaining the loyalty of his people and he would not risk that by allowing one High Priest to crack his whip unfettered.  Ror had insisted he be allowed to command the excavation of the artifact from the Coldrake Mountains.  That did not mean he could work Desmane's people to death.<br>
Ror surveyed the bare rock and soil that rose at the end of the valley.  Beyond that, far beyond, lay the nexus where he had sent the Circlet of Mists.  The excavation would take many months, even more, depending on the makeup of the mountain itself.  Ror sighed and nodded his head northward.  &quot;That is where we begin.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://drakksnet.homestead.com/files/Ghost.gif height=50 width=60" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br>  Posts: 1177<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/28/01 7:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=41>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 32</span><hr size=1> Stonefather Durgarn listened only absently to Moradan's report to Commander Gandrom, Makarak of the Dernalg Pass dwarven outpost.  Staring out beyond the pass onto the plains he surveyed the distant camps of the Dak-Kaskan forces.  After the humans' defeat they had returned to their camps near the Guardian Monoliths.  What the dwarven priest had originally viewed with disgust, the defilement of the monoliths at the hands of humans and guergans, he now viewed with quiet resignedness.  The huge stones in the form of dwarven warriors had long lost whatever magic they once held.  Worn smooth by the elements and deaf to the calls of the priests of T'ro'adon, they now suffered the taint of human filth upon them.  The same taint that his once proud race now suffered.  <br>
<br>
Durgarn rubbed his hand over the smooth stone of the Ward.  His ancestors had once used the small globe set upon the runed pedestal to command the magic of the Guardians, a magic that was viewed by most to be myth.  A <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Myth.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Had they lost so much?  Had the cost of his race's discovery of the upper world, been so great?  Why couldn't his people see their god's displeasure, see that the fading of magic was because they had gone up?  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Even the Telling Stones grew fainter with each generation.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->   The Stones that echoed the story of Dwarven history through every dwarf's soul were fading because his race closed their eyes to who they were and where they came from.  The further they moved away from their beginnings, the more they let the taint of the new races wash upon them, the greater T'ro'adon's displeasure with his children grew.  How could a people survive when even their god was unhappy with them?<br>
&quot;Stonefather?&quot;<br>
Durgarn looked up at Gandrom and realized the dwarven commander had called his name at least twice.  &quot;My apologies Gandrom.  I was lost in my thoughts.&quot;<br>
Gandrom nodded.  &quot;General Ormond surely has a plan, but I am unable to ascertain his reasoning.  It is too late for his loss to have been a diversion, we have already regrouped and have fresh warriors on watch.  Do you have any counsel on these matters?&quot;<br>
Stonefather Durgarn looked out upon the Monoliths again and sighed.  &quot;Pray.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You know I speak true, L'cia,&quot; the shadow's sibilant whisper grated on the High Mistress' nerves, but he was right.  Had not the Council of Diamonds said the same thing?<br>
&quot;My Wichta are not soldiers evil one.&quot;  A weak response, she knew it.  Damn this one to reduce <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  her</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, Emerald L'cia, High Mistress of the Nine Pale Hands caeban for over forty summers to nothing more than an apprentice with mere words.<br>
&quot;No, but once the Nine Pale Hands was marked among the Greater Caebans for no less than one hundred years.  Diamond J'hara would not approve at her caeban's loss of status.&quot;<br>
L'cia flinched inwardly at the mention of her sponsor's name.<br>
&quot;The Council of Diamonds never discovered what happened to her, did they?  It took great power,&quot; he drew closer to L'cia, his breath washed over the old witch's face, &quot;and great cunning.  But they would never approve.  Certainly they would strike any coven from the Roster of Hands for ten cycles if they found its Mistress was responsible for the murder of her sponsor.&quot;  He whispered in her ear, causing her to flinch momentarily.  &quot;And for one to kill a Wichta Diam?&quot;  He smiled.  &quot;Trigata Tuprani.&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Blood Trial</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> &quot;The Nine Pale Hands would be blown to the four winds and its Mistress?&quot;  He shook his head in mock dismay.  &quot;But we won't let that happen, will we?&quot;<br>
L'cia's rage was indescribable.  Her dark craft roiled and stormed but she kept it in check.  Much rode on her control.  To loose control would be to reveal herself and reveal the forbidden powers with which she had aligned herself.  Reveal her plans to do away with The Pact and bring the Wichta back to the power that was rightfully theirs.<br>
<br>
Four and a half centuries before, the White Robes, wizards of great power and greater arrogance decided that the Caebans of the Southlands were growing too powerful, claiming too much territory and gaining control of too many Nexi.  While many of the Southlands' Caebans had remained the gentle and peaceloving children of Gaervalen, giving guidance and aid to the simple folk of the South and communing with the spirits of the Walker's domain, others had come under the influence of dangerous and dark powers, some even dealing with the minions of Dierguroth.  Powers that weren't satisfied with this simple life, instead seeking to expand and corrupt those they came in contact with.<br>
<br>
The crusade of the White Robes was terrible.  Under Archmage Trexor Shiganus Ti they were a juggernaut of unstoppable magic.  No caeban, no matter what their purpose for gathering, was spared the wrath of the wizards.  The Robes then brought their crusade to the northern edge of Rimdale Forest.  Convinced they had found the seat of power, the Council of Diamonds, they unleashed their full fury.  Magic razed a fifty-mile circle of verdant forest and nothing was spared as the juggernaut brought its magical justice to the Wichta.<br>
<br>
The White Robes had brought their battle to the wrong field.  The Walker of the Woods was awakened.  Though there were the Wichta who dealt with the more fey and dangerous creatures of the forest, the forgotten children of Gaervalen and darker powers still, most still retained some respect for that which belonged to the Green God. When the wizards took their battle to Gaervalen's domain, Gaervalen countered with his Chosen.  Thirteen Greater Druids removed themselves from their homelands and, backed by the invisible might of the Elan themselves, destroyed the White Robes who dared walk Gaervalen's domain.<br>
<br>
The Wichta did not escape the Walker's wrath unscathed.  Those who had done harm to the forest in the battle were also destroyed, the ones who guided the Caebans down the dark paths scattered.  When the cleansing was finished, the Thirteen Chosen gathered the new leaders of the White Robes and the Council of Diamonds together to treatise.  The Pact was formed.  No Wichta was to ever work the Dark Craft, nor deal with Dierguroth and his minions.  The White Robes were forbidden from persecuting those Wichta who held to the Pact.<br>
The Pact had held for four centuries.<br>
L'cia frowned. There were those who were happy with brewing potions and birthing calves, she was not one of them.  L'cia and others saw the Pact for what it was.  An attempt to weaken the Wichta, to turn them into nothing more than fortune-tellers and midwives.  L'cia and her allies vowed to return the Caebans to their former glory.  To regain the power that was rightfully theirs.  Now this creature, this Guptras Den, lay open her plans and secrets like the entrails of a slain buck.<br>
&quot;What is your bargain, Servant of Death?&quot; she asked, cringing inwardly at his victorious smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;They will not stand for us recruiting from the town,&quot; T'ara argued with her Mistress the next night.  &quot;We promised the elders the Nine Pale Hands would not seek out residents of Tannor's Stand.&quot;<br>
&quot;Our blood thins T'ara,&quot; L'cia argued to her second.  &quot;The Council itself said we are not what we once were.&quot;<br>
&quot;J'hara made a promise,&quot; T'ara did not see her Mistress' face darken at the mention of the Wichta Diam's name.  &quot;To Queen Marharita herself.&quot;  She stressed the words, knowing what little impact they were likely to have.<br>
&quot;A different Mistress, a different Queen, a different time T'ara.&quot;  L'cia put on her most grandmotherly and benevolent countenance.  &quot;We don't have to necessarily <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    recruit</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.&quot;  She paced around a small oak table, fingering an opal absentmindedly.  &quot;We only have to offer a refuge for those who have a need in their lives for understanding and compassion.  Offer a purpose to fulfill their lives.  There are those in Tannor's Stand.&quot;  She turned to T'ara and smiled.  &quot;We only need to let them know someone cares.&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A> at: 4/25/02 4:09:01 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://drakksnet.homestead.com/files/Ghost.gif height=50 width=60" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br>  Posts: 1178<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/28/01 7:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=42>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 33</span><hr size=1> Greeneyes blinked in frustration.  She couldn't quite get the spell right.  Mara had insisted it was too complicated for her just yet, but Greeneyes said she wanted to try.<br>
&quot;Blast it!&quot;  She rocked back on her heels brushing her knees off and leaned forward again.<br>
Flowers bloom every day.  Greeneyes only tried to speed up this growth.  It should have been easy though the seeds before her seemed intent on fighting this unnatural encouragement.<br>
&quot;There!&quot;  She felt one split open, its first leafy stem searching upwards for light.  The apprentice druid nurtured the seedling, caressed and fed it her magic, Gaervalen's magic, and the small plant flourished.  Once started, Greeneyes found she didn't have to force the magic quite so hard.  The thriving life of the flower coaxed her magic, feeding upon it hungrily.  Mara had cautioned about this flow of magic.  Getting lost in the pleasure of bringing life, a druid could easily loose control of the magic, causing the growth to go wild.  While this was useful in offensive spells, there was still the need for control.  Greeneyes was learning this, with both Gaervalen's magic and her own dark craft.  The Craft still frightened her.  Greeneyes still could not trace its origins nor her own.  She could only continue her battle to control it, keep it from surfacing, and so long as her emotions, her fear and anger were kept in check so too was her craft.<br>
<br>
Jerem walked into the Logger's Cut, his favorite watering hole, and ordered a black ale from Stiff.  The barkeep grunted a greeting and poured the drink.  Jerem liked Stiff.  Stiff was his nickname of course, but well earned.  If you were a local, as most of his customers were, that's how he made his drinks: stiff.  Friends in Heln kept him well stocked for a cut of the money he earned from their supply of ill-gotten drink.  They had a good arrangement and it kept everybody happy, and happy customers were well tipping customers.<br>
&quot;How doin' Jer?&quot; Stiff asked as he passed the mug to Jerem.<br>
Jerem made a noncommittal sound and took the ale.<br>
&quot;Family life treatin' you well?&quot;  Stiff grinned at the big man's look of skepticism.<br>
&quot;Merrie's still cryin over her lost hubby,&quot; he replied, running a finger through the thick, tan foam.<br>
Stiff shrugged.  &quot;It ain't been that long.&quot;  He brought a rag up and wiped the counter absently.  &quot;It's tough loosin' a mate.&quot;  Stiff was quite happily married and raised two strapping teenage boys, but during his many years tending bar, he had seen a lot of tragedy and loss through his customers eyes.<br>
&quot;Yea, but she's home now.  We're back together.&quot;  Jerem took a pull from his drink.  &quot;I understand, I do.  But you'd think comin' home would have cheered her up a bit.&quot;<br>
<br>
Stiff didn't think Jerem understood, but he kept that to himself.  He kept a lot of his thoughts to himself.<br>
&quot;And then there's Loreana.&quot;  He said, prompted by Stiff's silent presence.  &quot;Cute kid but sheesh.  Always mopin' about.  Kids are supposed to be tougher than that.&quot;  He shook his head.  &quot;And a temper, I'll tell you what...&quot; he finished off the ale and waved for another.<br>
No, Stiff thought, he doesn't understand.  The barkeep shrugged it off and poured the drink.  He never got personally involved with his customer's problems.  Carrying the weight of the world was not his bag.  Listening was enough for him.  &quot;Give 'em time.  It's a rough thing to handle.&quot;  That was the extent of his aid and comfort.  Nope, it definitely didn't do to get involved.<br>
&quot;Eh, maybe you're right.  I don't know.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jerem sat there in silence as Stiff went off to a new customer.  He poured a drink for the man and went out to clean tables.  The new customer sat a few stools away, staring at his ale.<br>
Jerem looked at him, he didn't seem familiar but his work clothes and comfortable stance made him look like part of the bar, like a 'regular'.  Jerem raised his mug to the stranger in greeting and took a swig.<br>
The man raised his own drink, &quot;Howsit.&quot;<br>
Jerem grunted back, &quot;You know.&quot;<br>
The man chuckled and rubbed a scruffy, black beard.<br>
&quot;You been 'round here before?&quot;  Jerem asked after a moment of silence.<br>
&quot;Been through a few times.  Business and whatnot.  Ain't seen you here before.&quot;<br>
Jerem grinned, &quot;All the time.  Good place to come and soak my head.&quot;  He chuckled at his own joke.<br>
&quot;I know how that is.&quot;  The man took a deep drink.  &quot;I like to come up here when the wife's all moody.  Keeps her outta my hair.&quot;<br>
Jerem chuckled again, he liked this guy.  Easy going.  &quot;Yea, been finding myself here a lot.&quot;<br>
The man nodded, &quot;Woman problems too?&quot; he asked smoothly before taking another drink.<br>
&quot;Double.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ah, juggling the girlfriends or something?&quot;  He downed the remaining ale and waved for Stiff.<br>
&quot;Nah, nothin' that sordid.  Just an old girlfriend and her kid.&quot;<br>
The stranger nodded at Stiff and motioned for two.  Pulling coin from his pocket he paid and gave Stiff a good-sized tip.  Stiff grinned his thanks and left the two men alone.<br>
Jerem nodded his thanks as the stranger passed him the drink then grabbed the stool to Jerem's left.<br>
Scruffy guy, young but he looked like he'd worked all his life.  Good man.<br>
&quot;Daniel's the name.&quot;  Jerem shook the offered hand.  Strong grip.  &quot;Most call me Dan though.&quot;<br>
&quot;Jerem, Jer.  Good meetin' you.&quot;  He took a sip and licked the foam from his lip.  &quot;Where you from?&quot; he asked conversationally.<br>
&quot;Here and there.  Miera Kiy of late.  Wife's there.&quot;<br>
Jer nodded.  &quot;Miss her?&quot;<br>
Dan shrugged.  &quot;Sometimes.  When she's behavin' right.&quot;  The comment got the chuckle he wanted.  &quot;That's 'bout fifty-fifty if I know my women right.&quot;<br>
&quot;Heh, heh.  Fifty-fifty, forty-sixty,&quot; Jerem waggled his hand and they both chuckled.  &quot;So what's your secret when she's havin' one of them 'forty' days?&quot;  Jer grinned.<br>
&quot;Sometimes it's just a woman thing and you let it ride.&quot;  He took a gulp.  &quot;Wander down to soak my head as you put it.&quot;  Jer nodded, still grinning.  Dan smiled back.  &quot;Sometimes though you just gotta let 'em know they're just bein' too moody.&quot;  Dan leaned closer to his audience.  &quot;I just tell her she can't go moping all the time about little things.&quot;  He shook his head and took a long drink.  &quot;Sometimes she'll go on and on 'bout things that happened weeks ago.&quot;<br>
Jer smiled and nodded.  He knew how that was, yes he did.  Jerem took another drink.<br>
&quot;That's when I just put my foot down,&quot; Dan said as he lightly stomped the foot rail that ran along the base of the bar, &quot;and let her know enough's enough.&quot;  He shrugged and drank again.<br>
Jer tipped his mug and found it empty again.  &quot;Ready for another?  My treat this time.&quot;  Dan grinned and nodded.  Yea, Jerem liked this guy.  He had his head screwed on straight.<br>
<br>
Loreana woke with a start.  She didn't cry, she didn't do that much any more.  The nightmare's scared her though.  Waking up with her nightgown soaked in sweat, the feeling something was after her, something terrible, but she didn't remember.  She never remembered the nightmares, only the terrible fear afterwards.<br>
She got up and went to the kitchen for a drink of water.  Jerem had stumbled in a few hours earlier, drunk again, and disappeared into her mom's room, shutting the door tight behind him.  She heard noises, noises she didn't want to listen to but her pillow and blankets had shut them out.  Now, the house was silent and she was wide-awake.<br>
Lora went to the window in the front room and looked out across the small yard, past the low fence, into the street beyond.  Dim lamplight from the street made the shadows in the yard move and flit about.  Loreana shivered, from the air hitting her damp skin she told herself, and went back to her room.  She took a glow stick and blew on it.  The faint glow from the magical device pushed the darkness back.  Lora knew she wouldn't be able to sleep, and she didn't want to lay in the dark any longer.<br>
<br>
Sunlight brought an end to the dark and Lora soon heard the voices of Jerem and her mom move about the house.  After a while longer, she heard her name called.<br>
&quot;Loreana.  Loreana dear come here.&quot;  Lora lay there for a time, her body protesting the lack of sleep.<br>
&quot;Loreana, your mother's calling you.&quot;  Jerem.  Gods she hated him.  She wanted to lay there and ignore him, but he would only get mad at her mom again.<br>
&quot;Coming!&quot;  Lora rolled off her bed and dressed quickly.<br>
&quot;Yes Mom,&quot; she said as she walked into the kitchen.  Grabbing a piece of toasted bread, she took the water offered by her mom and took a chair.<br>
&quot;Loreana dear, can you run to the market for me a pick up a few things?&quot;<br>
Lora didn't like the errands even though her mom said it was part of growing up.  At least it was an excuse to get out of the house.<br>
&quot;Ok.  I'll get Cess to help me too,&quot; she subtly dropped the hint that she'd be going to Cessara's house first.<br>
&quot;That's fine, just don't take long.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ok.&quot;  It wasn't ok, but Mom didn't keep track of her that well any way.  Too occupied with Stupid Jerem.<br>
Jerem paid her no mind as he walked over to Merrie, placed his hand on her rear and kissed her on the head.<br>
&quot;I'm goin' out in a bit.  Merek's getting some steel today and he needs everybody there.&quot;  Merek ran a smithy on the other end of town.  Jerem liked the work and it paid well.<br>
&quot;Alright,&quot; Merrie sighed, &quot;Coming back for dinner?&quot;<br>
&quot;Maybe.  Just depends.&quot;<br>
'Depends,' Lora thought, depends on whether he decides to get drunk some more today.<br>
&quot;I'm gone.&quot;  Lora said, hopping off the chair.<br>
Merrie held a hand up, &quot;Wouldn't it help if you had a list of what I wanted first?&quot;<br>
&quot;Might,&quot; Lora said, hoping it was already written.  &quot;Money too.&quot;<br>
Merrie nodded and handed her daughter a scrap of paper and some silver coins.  Loreana didn't take a second look before running out the door.<br>
Cess wasn't home, so Lora headed for the market hoping to catch her there.  She wasn't, but Mara was.<br>
&quot;Hi Mara.&quot;<br>
&quot;Hello Loreana dear.  How are you doing today?&quot;  Mara was looking over pans of fresh-baked pastries, occasionally pointing one out for the baker to wrap and place in her basket.<br>
&quot;Ok.&quot;  The pastries smelled wonderful and it made Loreana's stomach growl.<br>
&quot;That's good.&quot;  Mara nodded her satisfaction to the baker and looked at the child.  &quot;What do you see that you like?&quot;<br>
&quot;All of it!&quot;  The girl piped up then realized what Mara was asking.  &quot;I can't.  I've got some stuff I've got to buy for Mom.&quot;<br>
&quot;Nonsense.  I know a hungry girl when I see one.  I'll even help you get what your mom needs.&quot;<br>
That was all the convincing Lora needed and both women walked away enjoying a delicious, sugarcoated pastry.<br>
<br>
Loreana licked her fingers after popping the last of the sweet in her mouth.  &quot;That was good. Thank you.&quot;<br>
&quot;You're welcome dear.  Now what's on that list?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://drakksnet.homestead.com/files/Ghost.gif height=50 width=60" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br>  Posts: 1179<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/28/01 7:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=43>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 34</span><hr size=1> Mara and Loreana strolled through the market a good part of the morning.  Neither of them were in a hurry and Lora liked the older lady.  Mara told interesting, funny stories and laughed when Lora told her own little jokes.  A ten-year-old's non-sensical jokes were just as funny as any joke an adult could make.  When Loreana spoke quietly of the things that troubled her, Mara listened just as intently.<br>
As they picked up the last of Merrie's shopping list near lunchtime, Lora said she should be going.<br>
&quot;Alright dear.  I certainly enjoyed your company,&quot; Mara smiled at the girl.  &quot;Shopping is quite a bore when you don't have somebody to do it with.&quot;<br>
&quot;I had fun too.  Thanks for the pastry.&quot;  Lora glanced down at her feet.  &quot;Mom doesn't make stuff like that much anymore.&quot;<br>
Poor child seemed to have more trouble in her life, more than a little girl should.  Mara thought about Greeneyes, so similar.<br>
&quot;Do you know how to bake?&quot;<br>
Lora shook her head sending brown hair waggling about her shoulders.  &quot;Mom was going to teach me, but she doesn't seem to have time lately.&quot;<br>
&quot;Would you like to help me sometime?&quot;  Mara grinned conspiratorially.  &quot; I have it on good authority my sugar cookies are quite tasty.&quot;<br>
Lora looked unsure but tempted.  She was.<br>
&quot;It's not hard,&quot; Mara said, then waved a hand.  &quot;Whenever you have a craving just call.  We'll whip together a batch.  It's fun and quite messy,&quot; she whispered with a grin.<br>
Lora smiled and hopped on her toes.  &quot;Ok, sometime.&quot;<br>
&quot;Whenever you like.  Have you got everything?&quot;<br>
The girl nodded as she held up two cloth bags.<br>
&quot;Then, I'll see you later.&quot;<br>
&quot;Later,&quot; Lora responded before turning and skipping lightly down the street.<br>
Much better Mara thought.  It didn't always take much to make a child a little happier, and Loreana could use some happiness.  The druid smiled to herself as she started her walk home.  She almost felt like skipping a little herself.<br>
<br>
The Court Seers in Miera Kiy predicted it would be a mild winter.  The farmers in Tannor's Stand were skeptical.  What did a bunch of snooty Nexus dwellers who spent most of their time playing politics or concocting some scheme or another know of weather?  The farmers knew.  They could tell by how the crops grew, when the harvest came, how the animals behaved, and other more tangible signs.  The signs this year told them to prepare for winter.  There would be snow this year, a lot of snow.<br>
Jerem was kept busy as she supposed everyone was, Merrie thought.  She wished he'd talk to her more.  Jerem always seemed to be in a rush.  Sighing, she got up to throw a log onto the dying fire.  When the winter comes.  He'll be here more.  She felt so alone sometimes.  It was good to have him around Merrie told herself.  If only Loreana understood.  If only she and Jerem could get along, the winter would go by much better.  It had to get better.<br>
Merrie sat by the fire and cried silently.  If only Brian were here.<br>
<br>
Lora, Cess and their friends thought autumn was grand.  The trees turned into rainbows, there were plenty of leaves to stomp around in and a lot of talk of how fun the snow would be.  Loreana had seen snow, it had snowed a little last year.  Nothing to talk of though.  When she was younger, the only snow she had seen in Miera Kiy was more of a bother than anything.  Turning the streets into brown, mushy puddles was all the snow ever accomplished there.  All of the talk by Cessara and their friends about building snowmen, throwing snowballs and making snow wizards made her more and more eager for winter.  It was going to be a good one too the adults said, though they never looked happy when they said it.<br>
<br>
Loreana took Mara up on her offer not long after the day it was made.  Now she found herself at the druid's home more and more.  Cess came by occasionally but said her mom would have a fit if she found out her daughter was going to the 'Witch's House', so Lora ended up going there by herself.  She didn't mind, Lora spent plenty of time with Cessara and her friends.  Spending time at Mara's was just another way to stay away from home.  Mara made the best cookies and bread she had ever tasted.  Not just normal bread, sweet bread, breads with fruits, nuts and all sorts of flavors.  Lora was learning to cook as well.  Mara let her help with everything, even near the stove with hot pans and pots.  Lora never burned herself, she was extra careful about that.  Mara trusted her and she liked that.<br>
Loreana liked the green-eyed lady too.  Everybody even called her Greeneyes.  The girl didn't think that was a real name, but it was what she was called.  The lady was strange, she didn't talk much but always seemed to enjoy her company.  Greeneyes never got very close though, almost like she was a little afraid of Lora.  It was ok though, she was neat.  Lora felt good being around her, especially when she did the magic Mara was teaching her.<br>
Greeneyes had her own magic, Lora knew.  She never used it though.  Lora could feel that, just like she felt a lot of things when she was near Greeneyes.  They always knew what the other felt, what mood each other was in.<br>
&quot;Tell me about your dreams Lora.&quot;<br>
The two women stood at the table in the kitchen making fried sugar dough.  Mara had fallen asleep in her chair that afternoon and the two of them decided to whip up some treats for desert.<br>
Lora shrugged, &quot;Nothing to tell I guess.  I don't remember them, even when I just wake up.&quot;<br>
&quot;But they scare you.&quot;<br>
The girl nodded as she continued kneading a mound of dough.  &quot;Mom says I cry in my sleep, sometimes scream.&quot;  Haunted eyes looked up at the woman.  &quot;Something's chasing me.  Something bad.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes tilted her head as she looked at the child.  A lone tear made its way slowly down her cheek.  &quot;Have you ever tried to - to remember?&quot;  She absently tore away a chunk of sweet-dough and rolled it in her hands.  &quot;Maybe if you knew what it was it wouldn't frighten you as much.&quot;<br>
&quot;That doesn't work though, does it?&quot;  Lora peered up at Greeneyes, looking much older than her ten years.  &quot;Not for you.&quot;<br>
Could she possibly know?  Greeneyes never discussed her own nightmares and visions around Loreana.  &quot;What do you mean?&quot;  She couldn't make her trembling voice sound as nonchalant as she wanted.<br>
&quot;You see your nightmares - and you're still scared.&quot;  Lora shrugged and placed the small piece of dough shaped like a flat cake onto a flour-coated plate.  &quot;Mom says it's just a phase.  That it'll pass.&quot;  Greeneyes could only nod slowly.  What could she say?   &quot;You're making them too big.&quot;<br>
&quot;Hmm?&quot;  The comment shook Greeneyes out of her stunned trance.<br>
&quot;You're making them too big.&quot;  Lora grinned at Greeneyes.  &quot;Mara says they won't cook proper if they're that big.&quot;  How did she do that?  The instant change in Lora was a bit frightening in and of itself.  &quot;They stay all doughy inside.&quot;<br>
<br>
  Lora talked about her nightmares to both Mara and Greeneyes.  There wasn't much to tell, but Mara was always there to hug her and let her cry.  She knew Greeneyes understood.  Greeneyes never wanted to talk about her nightmares, but Lora was right, she remembered them, very clearly she would say sadly.  Lora thought that maybe she was lucky not remembering.<br>
But the nights she awoke, frightened and crying, crying because the nightmares were getting worse again, she wasn't so sure.<br>
<br>
Loreana's twelfth birthday came and went in September.  Merrie had absently wished her a happy birthday with a hug and a kiss.  Jerem had ignored her, which was better anyway.  After spending a day with Cess, she dejectedly wandered out to Mara's home.  When the druid gently extracted the reason for the girl's unhappiness from her, she made Lora a birthday cake and gave her a small gift from Greeneyes and herself.  The small doe made of twistwood with two tiny, jades inlaid for its eyes caused the child to smile widely and hug the old woman as Greeneyes looked on with her own smile.  <br>
<br>
Jerem stomped in one cold, late November night.  Kicking the snow off his boots he tossed his coat to the side and shook out his hair.<br>
&quot;Old man Donnelley lost another wheel off that decrepit old wagon of his and came by just as we were closin' the doors.&quot;  He stalked into the kitchen and rummaged around noisily.  Merrie looked up from the coat she was mending for Loreana.  &quot;Isn't there any tea on?&quot; he shouted from the other room.<br>
&quot;I was just getting ready to put on some more.  It shouldn't be long.&quot;  She should have had something hot to drink on for him, but she didn't know when he was coming back.<br>
He walked back into the room and grabbed his coat.  &quot;It's alright.  I'm goin' out to the Cut anyway.&quot;  She didn't even have a chance to say anything before he was out the door again.<br>
Jerem hung his coat on a peg just inside the Logger's Cut doorway.  Waving to Stiff and a couple of buddies he saw Dan sitting at a table and decided to join him.<br>
&quot;Back so soon Dan?&quot; he asked as Stiff sat two mugs in front of them.<br>
&quot;Business as usual.  I'll probably be around for a while, what with the snow and all.&quot;<br>
Jerem nodded.  He didn't know what 'business' Dan was in, but he never got around to asking.  Didn't do to be nosy anyway.  &quot;Yea, storm hit pretty hard.  It's let up a bit but after a week,&quot; he shrugged.  &quot;Hopefully it's blown itself out.&quot;<br>
&quot;Still early though.  Best to always be prepared.&quot;  Dan raised his mug.  &quot;And this is the kind of preparation a man can appreciate.&quot;  He grinned at the illogic and took a drink.<br>
&quot;Hear, hear,&quot; replied Jer.<br>
&quot;Still got woman problems?&quot;  Dan asked after a couple of quiet minutes.<br>
Jerem shrugged, &quot;Yea.  You know.  Being cooped up in the house all winter.&quot;<br>
&quot;Don't I know it.  Mine whines about it too.&quot;  He pounded down his drink and motioned for two more.  Jerem hurried to catch up.  &quot;But hey, I'm the one who has to go out, make a livin'.  I don't like trudgin' through the snow, or the heat, or the wind.  Hell, I'd like to be able to sit around all day and relax.  What's a little cleanin' every now-and-then if you're comfortable and dry.&quot;  He handed Stiff two whole crown and said 'keep 'em comin''.<br>
Jer grinned and tipped his mug then reached for the fresh one.  &quot;Yea, they don't know how lucky they are.&quot;<br>
&quot;Damn right,&quot; Dan nodded in agreement.  &quot;Havin' someone to take care of 'em.  And most women wouldn't be so lucky as to find a good man, you know, bein' widowed and all.  With a kid to boot.&quot;<br>
Jer nodded.  &quot;Sure.&quot;  Damn if Dan didn't have the right of it.  &quot;She might miss her daddy and all, but hey, in some places they'd be out on the streets instead of having a good home and a man to bring home the bacon.&quot;<br>
&quot;Damn right.  What do they have to complain about?&quot;<br>
&quot;Damn right,&quot; Jer downed the last of his drink before Dan.  Yea, this wasn't going to be such a bad night after all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://drakksnet.homestead.com/files/Ghost.gif height=50 width=60" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br>  Posts: 1180<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/28/01 7:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=44>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 35</span><hr size=1> &quot;Can you teach me?&quot;  Lora stood at the kitchen table that eve, watching Greeneyes grinding herbs for a simple potion Mara taught her apprentice to make.<br>
&quot;I don't know Lora,&quot; she said as she paused to think.  &quot;I can teach you some of the mundane skills I've learned.  Plants and ingredients, animal behavior,&quot; she looked at the girl, &quot;But I think Mara should teach you about the magic of Gaervalen.  After all,&quot; Greeneyes brushed off her hands and poured the crushed roots into a small pouch, &quot;I'm still learning and she's a very good teacher.&quot;  Greeneyes grinned.  &quot;She'll teach you even when you don't know it.&quot;<br>
&quot;What about your magic?&quot;<br>
A chill went up Greeneyes spine.  &quot;Mara should-&quot;<br>
&quot;No,&quot; Lora interrupted.  &quot;Your magic.  You never use it, not that I've seen anyway.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes' skin crawled.  She felt her craft toying with her lightly and she pushed it down.  At least that was getting easier.<br>
&quot;Yea, that's it.  I felt it.  Just barely.&quot;<br>
&quot;NO!&quot;  Greeneyes snapped.  &quot;No!  Never!  You must never, ever even think about it.&quot;  She saw the look of hurt as tears come to Loreana's eyes and reached out, not thinking.<br>
&quot;I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to- It's just, it's not something you should ever learn.  I wish I could unlearn-&quot; Her hand brushed against Lora's cheek in a gentle caress.<br>
<br>
Fire flashed through her mind.  The images, the nightmares of blood and death poured through the woman and child.  The mind of the twelve-year-old opened to what the nine-year-old's mind had shut out.  This time Loreana saw with terrifying clarity images that would drive a hardened warrior mad.  The Craft flared, reaching out for her to barely be reigned in, but the horrors roared and pounded the child's mind.<br>
Loreana pulled away, her face a mask of stark terror.  Tears welled up in her eyes as she fought for and found breath.<br>
&quot;MONSTER!&quot; she screamed and turned, feet flailing before gaining purchase on the hardwood floor.  Lora tore through the front room, almost knocking Mara over, flung the door open and ran into the bitter, winter night.  Her coat rocked briefly on its hook as the wind from her passage stilled and the door slammed shut.  A cry of inhuman anguish rang out from the kitchen.<br>
<br>
Greeneyes knelt on the floor, her arms wrapped around her bowed head.  &quot;What happened?&quot; Mara grabbed her apprentice by the shoulders and shook the wailing woman.  The druid feared for Greeneyes' sanity, but she had to reach her.  &quot;Greeneyes!&quot;  Her voice took on a tone of command.  &quot;What happened to Loreana?&quot;<br>
Greeneyes shook violently as her shoulders heaved in great sobs.  &quot;I touched her!  I didn't mean to.&quot;  She wailed and beat her fists on the floor.  &quot;She asked about the craft... said she wanted to learn it... I didn't mean to yell at her.&quot;  Greeneyes balled up her fists as her shaking intensified.  &quot;I didn't mean to touch her.  I didn't think!&quot;  She looked up at Mara with red and swollen eyes.  &quot;She saw it Mara.  She saw it all.  Everything I was.  Everything I AM!&quot;  Her voice dropped to a whisper, &quot;I fought the magic back but I couldn't stop the images.  I couldn't protect her!&quot;<br>
Mara felt tears come to her own eyes, but there was no time for that.  She laid a hand on the grieving woman's head and sent a brief plea to Gaervalen.  Rising quickly she flew through the door, pausing only to grab her staff as she followed Loreana into the night.<br>
<br>
The snow had paused, but the air was bitter cold and the wind whistled through the trees in fits and starts.  Gusts whipped snow around making vision difficult.<br>
Speaking a single word, Mara caused the Staff of Gaervalen to illuminate with a warm, yellow light that did not glare off the blowing snow, but cut through it like a beacon.  Mara saw Loreana's foot prints in the snow, but they were fading rapidly.  Another short prayer and the druid rose to run lightly above the snow as she hurried after the child's fading trail.<br>
<br>
Loreana burst from the house, heedless of the snow and wind.  She had to get away, away from the creature in Mara's kitchen, away from the images that played over and over in her mind.  The people of the wagon train, the creatures that attacked Pippen, battles, atrocities and death, her father's death, beat her mind over and over.  Magic, blood, death and darkness tore at the child's brain until she could no longer run and collapsed in the snow.  Bitter, bone-numbing cold rapidly overtook her small body, clothing soaked with snow and frozen by the wind bit into her skin.  She didn't remember falling, she couldn't feel the snow that blanketed her.  Lora only knew the nightmares were finally overcome by darkness and peace.<br>
<br>
Mara was frantic.  The prints in the snow had disappeared and she only had the magic to guide her way to the lost child.  Her progress seemed slow, so slow.  How had she gotten this far?  The warmth from the staff protected the druid, but she knew Loreana would not last long in the wind and the cold.  Mara found herself chanting, not a prayer of magic to Gaervalen, but a desperate plea to her god for nothing less than the child's life.<br>
<br>
&quot;NOO!&quot;  She felt her slipping away, felt the darkness come, enveloping her, tearing them apart.  Greeneyes felt her very soul being ripped from her.  &quot;Loreana!  Don't leave me!  Forgive me!&quot;  She was loosing her, she couldn't feel her anymore.  &quot;Father forgive me!  Gaervalen help her.  Anything.  All I have, all I am, just don't take her.&quot;<br>
<br>
Only Gaervalen's mercy and magic revealed the tiny mound of snow where the girl lay.  Was she too late?  The warmth of the staff silenced the wind around the child's body but it was Mara's hands that brushed the snow away.<br>
Nothing.  Loreana's tiny form was a deep blue.  Mara felt no pulse, no breath, no-<br>
But that was wrong.  Something.  Something faint and fading quickly.  Mara felt the last thread of life slipping from her grasp.<br>
&quot;Walker of the Woods, my breath, my blood, my life.  I Maralaya Eltam give all you will have for the life of this precious one.&quot;  <br>
The druid raised her staff high and struck the ground next to Loreana's still form with all her might.<br>
Greeneyes felt her own life suddenly slipping away from her, draining her.  She couldn't move, couldn't cry out.  She welcomed it.  Without Loreana there was nothing, and she embraced it.<br>
<br>
The knot at the head of the staff shattered with incredible force.  Instead of destruction the explosion brought life.  In an area no more than a hundred paces across the snow was blasted away.  Blinding sunlight burst from all around though the clouds had not parted.  Warmth came with the sunlight, and with the warmth, life.  Grass burst from the thawing ground, flowers rose from buried seeds and bulbs to bloom.  The wind was silenced and spring came early to a tiny portion of meadow surrounding two still figures.<br>
<br>
Mara raised her head and blinked.  The warmth and growth confused her for a moment until she saw the magic holding the winter back.  A miracle, but it would not last long.  It wouldn't matter either unless...<br>
She gazed upon the still form of Loreana.  The child lay as she had before, but her skin had color and her chest rose slowly, but steadily with the breath of life.<br>
The druid lifted Loreana and gathered her tightly beneath her cloak.  Sending a prayer of thanks to the Green God she asked one more boon, to give them enough warmth and guidance to make it home.<br>
<br>
Greeneyes awoke with a start.  The house was silent.  She rose with a strength she didn't feel and went to the door.  The wind was dying, allowing the snowdrifts to settle and the air to clear.  A part of her hoped, knew, that they were coming back, they had to be coming back.  She couldn't see them and there were no tracks in the snow to guide her.<br>
&quot;Damn it!&quot;  If she had been a little girl terrified beyond sanity she would have run straight, as fast and as far as possible.  Before the cold and snow finally...<br>
&quot;No.&quot;  Greeneyes grabbed cloaks and a blanket from the chair and pushed out into the snow.  In only a moment she saw Mara, a look of supernatural determination on the druid's face as she trudged toward the house with a tiny bundle held tightly to her breast.<br>
<br>
Greeneyes rushed to her, shouting Mara's name several times to get her attention.  Wrapping two extra cloaks around druid and a blanket over all three of them she helped guide Mara the remaining distance to the house.  The door swung open before Greeneyes could touch it and Mara carried Loreana to the floor by the fire.<br>
&quot;Dry blankets.  As many as you can find.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes went to both bedrooms and grabbed all she saw.  Mara had peeled off Lora's damp clothing and was wrapping her in the quilt from her chair.  She took the blankets from her apprentice and made a makeshift bed before the fire.<br>
When Mara finished, Greeneyes saw the strength drain from the druid leaving a cold and tired old woman.  She helped Mara up and to her chair and covered her with another blanket.  Greeneyes turned her head to stare at the sleeping child.<br>
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Mara whispered gently.  <br>
Greeneyes thought she thanked Gaervalen and said her own private thanks.<br>
&quot;Greeneyes.  Thank you.&quot;  The woman turned her head to stare incredulously at Mara.<br>
&quot;Thank you?&quot;  Was Mara insane?  &quot;She almost died!  If I hadn't touch-&quot;<br>
Mara raised a finger, silencing her.  &quot;If you had not called out to Gaervalen, we would both be dead.&quot;<br>
&quot;But-&quot;<br>
&quot;What happened could not be helped.  It was inevitable.&quot;  Mara raised her head to turn it toward Greeneyes.  &quot;How long can you be near somebody you care about without touching them?  Even if you know it will cause harm.  The human desire to reach out to another, to touch and be touched cannot be ignored.  It would have happened sooner or later.&quot;  She leaned forward and spoke with her old strength.  &quot;You saved her.  If you had not called to the Walker of the Woods as I did,&quot; she sat back in her chair and stared into the fire, &quot;then I would be dead, and the cold would be closing back around Loreana... and she would die again.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br>  Posts: 1591<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(4/25/02 2:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=45>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 36</span><hr size=1> &quot;Greeneyes.&quot; <br>
Pippen awoke with her name on his lips.  After a moment of disorientation he blinked and rolled his head over.  The bard licked his lips.  Damn he was thirsty.  From Greeneyes' description of Dundare's home, he guessed that was where he lay.<br>
Trying to push himself up on one elbow evoked a stab of pain and he lay back down.  Now he remembered, at least, he remembered....<br>
&quot;Greeneyes!&quot;  He pushed himself up again, this time ignoring the pain.  &quot;Greeneyes?&quot;<br>
The house was quiet.  Pippen grimaced at the pain in his shoulder as he shuffled unsteadily through the house.  His legs didn't hurt, but they resisted the simplest of motions.  He saw no one in the living room and peered into the kitchen.  It was also empty and the stove cold.  He squinted at the sunlight coming through the window.  Where was everybody?<br>
The door squeaked open, &quot;Ah, Pippen lad.  What are you doin up?  You need your rest.&quot;  Dundare shut the door behind him and placed a small bag on the table.  <br>
&quot;Dundare?&quot;  The man nodded.  &quot;What happened?  Where is Greeneyes?  Is she...&quot;<br>
&quot;She is fine lad.&quot;  Dundare avoided the questioning gaze of the young bard.<br>
&quot;Where is she?  How long have I lain?&quot;  Pippen did not resist as the healer guided him back to the bed, but he would not lie down.  &quot;Where is she Dundare?&quot;  He placed his hand on the older man's arm and held it until Dundare looked at him.<br>
Dundare sighed, &quot;She is gone.&quot;<br>
&quot;Gone?&quot;<br>
He nodded.  &quot;Gone in search of the girl-child, Loreana.&quot;  He placed a hand gently on Pippen's good shoulder, &quot;as to your other question, it has been nine days since she brought you here, grievously injured.&quot;  The old healer sat with grunt in his chair.  &quot;Do you remember what happened?&quot;<br>
Pippen noticed the intensity in Dundare's gaze.  &quot;I, I remember walking with her on the path to your home.&quot;  He scrunched his forehead in concentration.  &quot;We came to a tree....&quot;  His eyes grew wide and his breath rapid as he stared straight into Dundare's eyes.  &quot;They came out of nowhere,&quot; he subconciously reached up to touch his shoulder.  &quot;She... I saw her... She killed them.  She...gods.&quot;  He couldn't comprehend what he had seen, the terrible magic he saw his Greeneyes wield.  He stared at Dundare, unable to voice the questions that tumbled inside his head.  &quot;I should be dead, we both should be-&quot;<br>
&quot;But you aren't.  You know of the dreams she has?&quot;  Pippen nodded.  &quot;What you saw was the imbodiment of those dreams, those nightmares.  The thing that has been tearing at her sanity, her soul, surfaced when she saw your life in danger.&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't understand.&quot;  Pippen replied after a moment.  &quot;She said she was afraid of what she may have once been, but she saved me, saved us both.&quot;<br>
&quot;She couldn't control it lad.  It just happened.  The power she wields threatens to overwhelm her.  This creature, the witch she believes she once was, is trying to come back and she's fighting it with every ounce of her being.&quot;<br>
&quot;Where did she go?  I have to-&quot;<br>
&quot;No.&quot;<br>
&quot;No?&quot;<br>
&quot;Pippen lad, she knew you would want to go with her and she knew you would try to follow her once you awoke.  She made me promise to not let you do that.&quot;<br>
&quot;Not let me?&quot;  Pippen asked incredulously.<br>
&quot;I'm certainly not going to chain you to the bed lad, but listen.&quot;  Dundare rose from the chair and paced the floor once before turning to the bard.  &quot;If you had only seen her when she brought you to me.  She was devastated.  Your life hung in the balance and she blamed herself.&quot;  He held up a silencing finger when the bard opened his mouth.  Pippen shut it quickly.  &quot;She feels she brought you in danger and it would utterly destroy her if she saw you get hurt again.  In a sense she is right.  Even with what she has revealed to you, you do not fully understand what is at work here.  None of us do.&quot;  <br>
Dundare stopped and sat on the edge of the bed.  &quot;But what I understand is that there is purpose to everything.  There are forces at work in Greeneyes' and Loreana's lives that move them to some end, a destiny if you will.&quot;  The old healer looked down at his hands briefly.  &quot;The time she spent with you was happy, yes?&quot;<br>
Pippen nodded.  &quot;We were happy, but...&quot;<br>
&quot;But all of this still hung over your heads like storm clouds.  While the two of you appeared happy, the storm brewed inside her.  Don't take this the wrong way Pippen lad.  She loves you dearly, but you are a... distraction.&quot;  Again he raised the finger against Pippen's protest.  &quot;While she is with you she wants to be happy.  At times she is, but then the nightmares return.  Until a resolution comes about, until she lifts the veil of darkness that surrounds her memories and her life she will <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  never</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be happy.  Keeping her from this would not be fair to her nor would it be fair to you.  This she knows.  That is why she left in search of Loreana.  And that is why she did not want you to go with her.&quot;<br>
Pippen was stunned.  He knew though, deep down, that Dundare was right.  Greeneyes was right.  When they were together they tried, too hard perhaps, to be happy.  They pushed away the dreams and nightmares and went about their business.  Greeneyes had said she didn't know where to go next, but was that true?  Maybe they put so much effort into happiness they ignored possible solutions.  He silently shook his head as a tear fell from one eye.<br>
&quot;Let her go Pippen.  For now.  She will return, I know it.&quot;  Pippen only nodded and looked away.  &quot;Here, she wrote you a letter before she left.&quot;  Dundare rose and retrieved the missive from the other room.<br>
Pippen held it for a moment before moving unsteadily to the door.  &quot;Let me be alone, for a bit.&quot;<br>
Dundare nodded and watched Pippen step outside slowly and close the door behind him.<br>
<br>
He sat on the bench outside the little home and opened the paper that had been carefully folded and sealed with wax.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  My Beloved Pippen,<br>
Please forgive me My Love.  As I write this I see you laying there, Dundare over you like a mother bear, and I know I love you beyond all else.  After today though, I realize my love can be a terrible thing.  I cannot bear this.  I pray that Dundare will see you through this as he saw me through my injuries and I pray that you understand why I leave you to his tender care.  Another shard of memory has pointed me in the direction I must go.  As much as my heart cries for your companionship, your warm arms, your love, this path is for me to travel alone, for now at least.  I keep my promise to you.  If I return the same Greeneyes who loves you so desperately, I will be yours forever.  If by mine or any other hand you were not there when this is finished, I would have nothing.  Be my anchor My Love, my precious Pippen.  I seek to bring light to the darkness surrounding my life and you have become the source of that light, the warmth it gives as I strive to draw closer.  Without you Pippen, all the knowledge of the gods would be but a scrap of paper tossed into a dying fire. In utter selfishness I ask you to wait for me My Love.  I need to know you are there and safe, the light that guides my return.  Without you My Love, I have nothing, I am nothing.  Wait for me Pippen.<br>

I love you my Precious Rogue,<br>

She hadn't seen her all day and couldn't' remember where she said she was going.  &quot;Jer?&quot;<br>
&quot;Didn't she go to her little friend's house?  Probably staying the night again.&quot;<br>
&quot;That's probably it,&quot; she said, not quite surely.<br>
&quot;Besides, that gives us some time to ourselves doesn't it?&quot; He slid up behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist.  &quot;That's what you've been wanting lately anyway isn't it?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yea.&quot;  She turned to him.  She liked it when he was like this.  Much better than after a night drinking with his friends.  &quot;Yea, that would be nice.&quot;<br>
She smiled and kissed him.<br>
<br>
Mara was at her side before she opened her eyes.  She was tired.  Her body hurt all over, a dull ache that made it painful to move.<br>
&quot;Don't move Lora dear.  Rest.  You'll be alright in a day or so.&quot;<br>
She looked up at Mara, &quot;What happened?&quot;  She remembered running and she remembered the cold, the bone numbing cold and shivered.<br>
&quot;It's best not to talk about it now.  You need to-&quot; She saw Loreana's eyes go wide as the girl looked past her shoulder to the door.  She shrank back and her breath quickened.  Mara turned and saw Greeneyes just beyond the doorway.  The woman held herself tightly, her face still red and wet with tears.<br>
&quot;What's she doing here?&quot; her hand clasped tightly around Mara's.  &quot;I remember.  Get her away from me.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes choked back a sob and turned to leave.<br>
&quot;Stop.&quot;  Mara turned to the child and ran a gentle hand across her forehead.  &quot;No child.  Don't blame her.  It's not her fault.  If anybody is to blame it is me.&quot;<br>
&quot;But I saw her.  I saw...what she is.&quot;  Her moist eyes never left the doorway.<br>
&quot;No dear.  You saw what she <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> was</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  A long time ago.  She is as afraid of it as you are and she is forced to live with it every day.  The person you saw is not who she is now.  Every day she fights the demons and the darkness within her.  It haunts her waking and asleep.&quot;  Mara drew the girl closer to her.  &quot;One day she awoke not knowing where or who she was and she saw what you saw, but within herself.&quot;<br>
&quot;But she's used her magic.&quot;  Loreana's words were broken by deep sobs as she remembered the terrible images.<br>
&quot;Yes.  And it tears her apart.  Greeneyes fights it, pushes it back, but sometimes it comes anyway.&quot;<br>
&quot;I hate it Loreana.  I hate this thing, this monster that I was.  It scares me.&quot;  Greeneyes was crying as she entered the room just far enough to see the girl.  &quot;Every day I saw more of what I was and I wanted to die.&quot;  Her hands worked the words.  &quot;Until I saw you and your father.  Until I saw through your eyes.&quot;  She looked down, searching for the words.  &quot;And I knew I was here for a reason, a purpose.&quot;  She shook her head while her tears fell.  &quot;I still don't know why.  After two years I find myself always drawn to you and I don't know why Loreana.&quot;  <br>
The child was crying now, but Mara saw it was without fear.<br>
&quot;When you touched me, outside your home, those same images... I saw them.  When I awoke two days later the magic came to me.  Subtle at first, but you had awoken something in me and I couldn't control it.&quot;  She clasped her hands together and looked pleadingly at the girl.  &quot;Then I lost you.  I tried to go on, to live, but there was this hole, this nothing where you had been.&quot;  She looked briefly at Mara then back to Loreana.  &quot;Then I found myself here.  I don't know how I even got here, how I found you, but I did.  And today...&quot; she sobbed.  &quot;Today... I'm so sorry.  I knew what might happen... I didn't think...&quot; she closed her eyes.<br>
&quot;That's why you never came too close to me.  You always moved away when I came near.&quot;  Understanding gleamed in the child's eyes.<br>
&quot;When you said you wanted to learn my magic it frightened me.  I didn't think.&quot;  Her shoulders shook in anguish.  &quot;And when you ran, when you fell, I... oh gods.  I felt you slip away from me, like someone was ripping my life, my soul from me.  I don't know why I'm here, or who I am, or was, but I know if I ever loose you...&quot; she shook her head, unable to continue.<br>
Mara held the girl as she cried.  &quot;It's alright dear. Everything's alright,&quot; she stroked the girl's hair.  &quot;She loves you Lora, she offered her life to Gaervalen to save you.  She saved us both. Shhh.&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Loreana said quietly.  &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes cried and held herself because she could not hold Loreana. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br>  Posts: 1593<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(4/25/02 3:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=47>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 38</span><hr size=1> <br>
The winter passed.  Storms seen earlier in the season did not come after the new year and the farmers predicted a good season.  The days warmed and Tannor's Stand returned to being the bustling little town it was known to be.  Farming was generally better near Nexi, and Tannor's Stand was just ten miles from the nearest one in Rimdale Forest.<br>
Nexi were good for many things, as those in the Caeban of the Nine Pale Hands were aware.  The Rimdale Nexus had remained stable over the winter, as it had for as long as they could remember and the gathering of Crafters moved on about their business.<br>
That business was, for the most part, mundane.  Helping farmers with crops or pests, studying the patterns of flora and fauna in the area, predictions, seeings and minor politics.  Mundane.  And all left to L'cia's subordinates.  She was tired of it.<br>
<br>
L'cia longed for what she saw as the greater glory of the old days, the old ways.  She hoped, with this Guptras Den by her side, she might play a part in restoring the power to the Caebans of Andar.  Patience was the key, she knew this.  Guptras always saw fit to remind her as well.  No matter, she had many, many good years left.  Her power still grew, slowly, but grew nonetheless.  Her caeban needed rejuvenation though if it was to regain its status as a Greater Caeban.  The Nine Pale Hands needed new blood, new apprentices to carry out her plan.  T'ara did not share in her ideals, but of course she didn't know her Mistress' thoughts either, she was an innocent with no idea of what her Mistress' dealings were.  She did as she was instructed, which L'cia valued greatly.  T'ara had been set with the task of finding young women who would be suitable for apprenticeship as the years went by.  Because they were not allowed specifically to recruit members from Tannor's Stand, they only looked for those who would be drawn naturally to an understanding, caring group that could give them the feeling of self-esteem.  A group that made them feel wanted.  This way they would grow slowly, without attracting the attention of the town elders, and bring in those more suitable for L'cia's plans.<br>
<br>
Several girls had been marked as the type the caeban sought.  Their home-lives were not what they should be, or they were more rebellious than most children, and they were watched.<br>
The druid, Mara, was also watched.  She had never bothered the caeban, never even paid them attention, but there she was, planted firmly between the caeban's hidden location and Tannor's Stand.<br>
Mara had never taken part in politics, never made her voice heard in any situation.  To most townsfolk she was merely a curiosity, witch to some, kindly old woman to others, but none bothered her and most were friendly.  The only townsfolk she dealt with besides the merchants she patronized were the children.<br>
The same type of children the caeban sought.  Yes, she would bear watching.<br>
<br>
Mara was dismayed to learn Lora had not attended any type of schooling since leaving Miera Kiy.  Tannor's Stand did not have an organized school, so the druid took it upon herself to instruct the child.<br>
Loreana was a good student, hungry for knowledge though her moods didn't always permit the steady, paced study normal to schooling.  Mara didn't mind, teaching whatever the girl was eager for at the time.  Lora loved to read and Mara did her best to provide her with books on everything from politics to fiction.  When Lora wasn't in the mood to read, there were more than enough topics that grabbed her interest.  She loved to watch and question every move that Mara or Greeneyes made whether they were cooking or creating the potions, poultices, and components they used to work Gaervalen's magic.<br>
<br>
Loreana and Greeneyes always maintained a wary distance from each other, but what they couldn't share up close they compensated for in other ways.  They talked, they revealed to each other what they saw or heard in the forest and meadow nearby.  The two grew close in mind and spirit as they shared the wonders of the nature and magic they learned.<br>
Times were not always good.  Loreana still suffered from intense nightmares she could never remember.  At home, Jerem complained about her cries when she woke, shaking and scared.  Merrie paid less and less attention to Lora as the widow rode the waves of depression she still suffered from Brian's death and Jerem's bouts of drunken moodiness.  Whether he was happy with Merrie or angry, there never seemed to be a place Loreana fit in her mother's life.  Merrie rarely even asked where Loreana had been, even when she stayed at Mara's for several days straight.<br>
<br>
When summer came, Loreana and Cessara would go to the spring to talk and dream.  They still played with friends and shared the secrets young girls shared.  Cess was thirteen now and as summer came she started showing an interest in the boys.  Lora didn't think much of it, but it didn't bother her.  Most of the boys were a pain and she didn't understand why Cess always liked to talk to some of them in the market.  One of them, Samuel, especially attracted Cess's attention.  He just annoyed Lora, he was thirteen and too impressed with himself.  It would take forever to drag Cess away from him.  One day, Samuel offered to buy Cess a pastry but not Lora and she stalked away to Mara's in a huff.<br>
<br>
Cess and Lora lay side by side looking up at the clouds.  The stream gurgled happily nearby as the girls listened in silence at the world around them.<br>
&quot;I met someone a few days ago.  A woman.&quot;<br>
&quot;So,&quot; Lora replied, unimpressed.<br>
&quot;She knows magic.&quot;<br>
&quot;Mara knows magic, so does Greeneyes.  They're teaching me.&quot;<br>
&quot;She said she could teach me too.&quot;<br>
&quot;I thought your mom didn't like magic.&quot;<br>
&quot;She doesn't like Mara.  She never said anything about magic...not exactly.&quot;<br>
&quot;So what can she teach you?&quot;<br>
&quot;Look.&quot;  Cess sat up and waited for Lora to roll her head towards her.  &quot;She already taught me something.  'Something simple', she said.&quot;<br>
Cess held the palm of her hand open, concentrated for a moment and blew.  A small candle flame sprang to life from the center of her hand.<br>
&quot;Wow!&quot;  Now Lora was impressed.<br>
&quot;It's not hot.  You can't burn yourself or light a candle with it or anything.  She says its good for seeing at night in your room or something.&quot;  The flame went out and Cess frowned.  &quot;I have to concentrate to keep it going.&quot;<br>
&quot;That's neat.  I'm just learning things like healing sick plants and making stuff to put on cuts.&quot;  Lora shifted slightly.  &quot;Do you think she could teach me too?&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't know.  She said she likes to teach and she did ask if I had any friends.&quot;<br>
Lora punched her playfully in the arm.  &quot;So, Friend, ask her for me.&quot;<br>
Cess poked her on the forehead.  &quot;Ask her yourself.  I'm gonna see her tomorrow at midday over behind Pretcher's place.  You can come with me.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh thank you,&quot; Lora said with playful sarcasm.  &quot;I think I will.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You missed your studies yesterday Loreana.  What happened?&quot;<br>
Lora looked at Mara in surprise.  &quot;Oops.  I'm sorry.  I forgot.  I was out with Cess.&quot;  She left out the part where she and Cess had met with the woman Tannara.  She was neat, and very nice.  Tannara had brought along a basket of bread, cheese, dried beef, and a very good fruit juice of some kind.  She had talked with the girls for hours and didn't mind Loreana coming along at all.  The woman was eager to teach them magic and other things she knew.  Like Mara, she talked about the forest and animals, but the part the girls like the best were the stories she told about the fairies and tree sprites and spirits that made the forest a mysterious and wondrous place.<br>
Tannara said she could talk to the spirits.  Lora was a little skeptical, but Tannara said that she might show them sometime.<br>
When the sun started to set and they said their good-byes.  Cess and Lora walked back home talking of dancing fairies, shy dryads and magic.<br>
&quot;Ok dear, we can get to it later perhaps.  For now, how about helping me make those turnovers I told you about?<br>
Lora hopped excitedly and nodded even as her thoughts strayed to fairy dust and candle flames you could hold in your hand.<br>
<br>
Mara scented something was wrong when Loreana asked about wood spirits.<br>
&quot;Are they the children of Gaervalen also?&quot; she asked, curious if Mara would teach her about them as Tannara had.<br>
&quot;Not so much children as those who have strayed from his care,&quot; she replied carefully, wondering where the girl had heard this.<br>
&quot;So they were, but aren't now?&quot; Lora pushed the question.<br>
Mara nodded slowly.  &quot;Some call them the Lost Children.  Many are tricksters, or angry spirits, some just mischievous, but few can be trusted.&quot;  Mara turned nonchalantly away, &quot;Where have you heard of them?&quot;<br>
Loreana wasn't fooled and decided the topic wasn't a safe one.  &quot;From a few of the girls.  I thought you'd know.&quot;  She turned and skipped out the door, effectively ending the conversation.<br>
Mara turned back to the herbs she was grinding.  The druid suspected that is was not Loreana's friends who had told the girl about these things.  No, her suspicions led her in an entirely different direction.<br>

She didn't hear the raised voices that were prelude to the slap but when she saw him swing at Merrie with his open palm she stood there, frozen in her tracks.  When Merrie looked at her, face wet with tears and red from the stinging strike, Loreana broke and ran back out the door.<br>
She didn't return for three days and didn't tell anyone... not even Cess.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey Dan, good to see ya back, how's business?&quot;<br>
Jerem rolled into the Cut early the next evening, pleased to see his old drinking buddy there.<br>
&quot;Doin' good, doin' good.  How's yours?&quot;  Dan ordered an ale and a cup of stronger stuff from Bakaksha for each of them.<br>
&quot;Not bad.  Always some iron needed 'round farming country.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yep, always will be,&quot; Dan nodded and handed Stiff the cost plus a sizeable tip.  &quot;How's the family?&quot;<br>
Jer took a swig and shook his head.  &quot;I don't know Dan.  I don't think it's working out.  She just hasn't gotten right so far.  We just fight a lot and make up later.&quot;  He shrugged, &quot;I don't know.  I might have gotten a little too angry with her last night.&quot;  He didn't know why he slapped her, she just made him so angry.<br>
Dan put on a concerned face.  &quot;Ya hit her around a little bit?&quot;<br>
Jer looked up in denial then gave in.  Hell, this was Dan he was talking to.  &quot;I just slapped her.  And only once.&quot;  He took a pull from the cup and washed it down with ale.<br>
&quot;Got a little mouthy maybe?&quot;  Dan looked at Jerem then shrugged.  &quot;Happens every now and then.  But you know, when they get all excited and worked up over nothing they just need something to bring 'em to their senses.&quot;  Jerem looked at him funny.  &quot;I'm not saying beat 'em senseless, but you know, something to bring 'em back to reality.  Happened to me once.&quot;<br>
&quot;To you?&quot;  Jerem asked, not sure of the connection.<br>
&quot;Sure.  When I was a boy,&quot; Dan downed both drinks and waved for more of the same.  &quot;Found my dog out back behind the house.  Been torn apart by wolves or something, bloody mess.  I'd had that dog my whole life and there he lay.  I guess my dad found me back there just staring and staring.  He tried everything, waving his hand in front of me, shaking me, yelling my name.&quot;  He shook his head.  &quot;Nothing.&quot;  He grabbed the drink Stiff just put down and sipped it thoughtfully.  &quot;So he slugged me.  No open hand slap mind you, but balled up his fist and laid me out.&quot;  Dan slapped the table and laughed, evoking a grin and nervous laugh from Jerem.  &quot;Brought me right back to my senses, good as new.&quot;<br>
Jerem took a drink and grinned.  His mother had slapped him a few times.  Did him good he wagered.<br>
&quot;Yep,&quot; Dan said.  &quot;Not such a bad thing every now and then.&quot;<br>
<br>
'Not again!' Mara thought as she rose and crossed her room to the bed she let Loreana sleep in.  She knew of the child's nightmares before, but since bringing in a spare bed and offering it to the girl, she saw first-hand how bad the dreams were.<br>
Loreana would wake, often without prelude, screaming.  Other nights she would cry herself awake, fear in her eyes and sweat soaking her bed-clothes and sheets.  Mara would always rise and go to her.  The druid would hold her for hours, rocking her gently.  It tortured Greeneyes as well.  She couldn't hold Loreana, couldn't comfort her, and she would silently cry for the child.<br>
<br>
Adolesence was overtaking Lora quickly and it only seemed to magnify the intensity of the dreams.  From her thirteenth birthday in the fall and into the spring, as she struggled to deal with the stress of coming maturity on her body, the nightmares played havoc with her mind, falling neatly into cycles of intensity that matched precisely with her menstrual cycles.<br>
Cessara, having already dealt with that part of her life was a world of help that Lora felt she could do without.  Greeneyes apparently didn't have a cycle and the question caught her completely off guard.  The woman hadn't even thought of it, though she knew she wasn't even over thirty summers old.  Mara was a world of advise and help, but for some reason Lora felt embarrassed to discuss it.  So she turned to Tannara.<br>
Tannara seemed to have just the right amount of clinical detachment combined with a caring attitude that made Lora feel she could discuss it with her just like all the other topics they discussed.  Lora told her afterwards how comfortable she felt talking to her.  Tannara was pleased and said that 'sometimes you just need someone to turn to.'<br>
&quot;It helps to be able to talk sometimes.  I didn't have a mother or a father around when I was growing up.  I spend most of my time on the streets of Miera Kiy.&quot;  She smiled at Loreana.<br>
&quot;That's where I was born,&quot; Lora piped up, then said in a more subdued voice, &quot;We moved here when I was nine, after my daddy died.&quot;<br>
&quot;There's a lot of tragedy in our lives Lora.&quot; Tannara placed her hand on Lora's.  &quot;No one should have to take it on all by themselves.  I try to help where I can because somebody helped me when I was a girl your age.&quot;  She was sincere.  It was why L'cia used her when it came time to bring new blood into the caeban.<br>
&quot;Who?&quot;  Lora's curiosity was piqued.<br>
&quot;A woman named Luciana.  She taught me what I've been teaching you and more.  And when I was old enough she took me into her home with others like me and that's where I've been since.&quot;<br>
<br>
Loreana and Cess talked about it.  It sounded pretty neat, and they both loved the magic and the temptation of learning more, but Lora wasn't sure.  She knew somehow Mara wouldn't approve, but there was no hurry anyway.  Tannara only mentioned it once.  The only other time she talked about it was if one of the girls had a question.  Then she would talk until they were done listening. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br>  Posts: 1642<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(5/13/02 2:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=49>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 40</span><hr size=1> When Jerem started hitting her mom, she would cover her head with her pillow or climb out her window and leave.  He seemed to come back drunk every night now.  At least on the nights she actually spend at home and those times were getting fewer and fewer.  Most of the time she would go to change her clothes, get money and something to eat and sleep on nights she didn't feel like taking the walk to Mara's.<br>
<br>
Jerem yelled at her too, and once he looked like he wanted to hit her, but told her to run off with her little boyfriends.  She didn't even have a boyfriend but took the cue anyway.<br>
Lora still didn't think much of boys.  Oh, she definitely felt different about them, but the only ones she really knew were Jerem, though technically a man Tannara said all men were boys, and Samuel.  Jerem was the worst example of men she could think of and Samuel stood right there next to him for the boys.<br>
<br>
Cess had had enough of Samuel when, early in the summer, he had tried getting a little too close to her.  His hands had gotten as far as her breasts when her knee went into his crotch.  The boy stringently avoided Cessara from then on.<br>
However, that didn't dissuade him from trying the same thing with her friend.  Loreana was beginning to fill out her dresses and Samuel finally took notice of her.  He had called her from behind a wagon and acted like he had a secret.  His clumsy attempt at a come-on was met with utter disdain.  He didn't like that and pushed her back against the wall of the building.  Her command to leave her alone was ignored as he placed one hand on her chest.  Lora tried to put her knee between his legs but he had learned that much.  Holding her painfully tight he tried to kiss her.<br>
<br>
He stopped, his face only inches away as her fist, enveloped in a scintillating green aura rose before it.  The look of fear in his eyes was utterly precious and she rolled her eyes down to his grasping hand.  He loosed his grip instantly and backed away.<br>
&quot;And if I ever hear of you trying the same thing with anyone, I'll make sure you shrivel up and blow away.&quot;  She looked meaningfully downward, evoking a flinch from the boy.  &quot;Boo!&quot;  Samuel turned tail and ran as fast as he could around the nearest corner.  She was sure he wouldn't stop there.<br>
<br>
Looking around the base of the building she found a clump of weeds and waved the hand holding the simple weed-killing spell over it.  It wouldn't have done a thing to Samuel, but of course he didn't know that.<br>
She smiled as she saw the weeds shrivel and dry.  All that accomplished with nothing more than magic light and a look of business.  Imagine what was possible with more.<br>
<br>
&quot;How's it going Jerem?  Gonna welcome your old buddy back with just a handshake or a fist of ale?&quot;  Dan called in good-naturedly as he pulled up a chair next to Jerem.<br>
Jer waved at Stiff who brought them their usual, two mugs of ale and the 'Baka-brew'.  The name they dubbed the Bakaksha hard liquor.<br>
&quot;Been a while ain't it?  Last saw you in spring wasn't it?  And now here it's fall.&quot;<br>
Dan shrugged his shoulders.  &quot;Same as always.&quot;<br>
&quot;Business.&quot;  They both said in unison, downing the first ale in one gulp.<br>
&quot;So how's the wife?&quot;  Jer asked as usual.  They seemed to have a pretty good marriage.  She towed the line pretty well, not quite like Merrie who was getting there.<br>
&quot;Not so good.  I had to let her go.&quot;  Dan said sadly.<br>
&quot;Well damn, what happened?&quot;  Jer asked, he couldn't believe it.<br>
&quot;She started complaining again, but this time about getting old.  'Old?' I said.  She's barely thirty or so.  Well that was it.  I told her to get the hell out.  I don't need no woman crying 'bout how old she's getting.  Makes me feel old.<br>
&quot;Well shoot Dan, sorry to hear 'bout it.&quot;<br>
Dan shrugged and sipped his beer.  &quot;How's yours doin?&quot;<br>
&quot;Fair.  She's straightenin' up a bit but still needs settin' right every now and then.&quot;<br>
Dan nodded.  &quot;And the kid, what's her name again?&quot;<br>
&quot;Loreana,&quot; Jer said, continuing on the second ale.<br>
&quot;Yea, Loreana, nice name.  She doing good?&quot;<br>
&quot;Hell, who knows.  She's in and out so much I wish she'd make up her mind.  Bad enough when she was all moody and just hangin' around.  Now you never know when she's gonna be there.&quot;<br>
Dan looked surprised.  &quot;How old is she now?&quot;<br>
&quot;Thirteen I think, Fourteen in a month or two.&quot;<br>
&quot;Well that explains it.&quot;<br>
Jer looked askance at him.  &quot;How so?&quot;<br>
&quot;You know.  Growing up.  Getting interested in the boys.&quot;  He winked.<br>
&quot;Hmm.  I ain't seen any boys hangin' around, but I wouldn't doubt it if that little vixen's out behind the barn with most of 'em.&quot;  He took another swig and stared out across the bar.<br>
<br>
Guptras Den watched his reaction closely.  This one was easy, like playing a drum with one stick.<br>
&quot;She starting to fill out and all yet?&quot;  Dan asked casually.<br>
&quot;Yea, I suppose.&quot;  Jer felt a little uncomfortable around the topic, but didn't know why...or did he?<br>
&quot;Yea, they get to that time of life and they get that urge to explore.  Natural enough I guess.&quot;  He downed the Baka-brew and waved Stiff over for another round.  &quot;You remember what it was like.  Hell, that's probably why in some o' these countries they marry 'em off when they hit twelve or so.  A man likes to know his women are unspoiled I suppose.&quot;  He chuckled.  &quot;Heh, maybe a woman that doesn't complain how old she is makes a man feel younger too.&quot;  He laughed again and Jer laughed with him, though when his thoughts drifted to Loreana he shifted uncomfortably in his chair.<br>
<br>
Mara was determined that Loreana would have a good birthday this time.  She made sure she told any of Lora's friends she saw to be at the meadow just east of town at noon on the twelfth day of Bistun.  They did show.  Mara knew a little bribery never hurt so she mentioned the sweets and cakes and animals to pet.  She made sure that if they were bringing a gift it was to be from the heart, not from the purse.<br>
Naturally most of the boys didn't show up, but that was fine.  Loreana gasped when she saw Cess and many of her friends there.<br>
<br>
Everything went as planned.  The girls were even able to drag Greeneyes into some of the games, though she was more than careful to avoid contact with Loreana.  Nobody noticed though and at the end of the day, when her friends hugged her and said goodbye, she went to Mara and Greeneyes.<br>
&quot;I can't believe this.  You've made me so happy today.&quot;  Lora was grinning from ear to ear.  &quot;I haven't even talked to Deena in over a month and she was here.  Mara, both of you,&quot; she looked at Greeneyes.  &quot;I love you so much.&quot;  She gave Mara a huge hug that was returned the same.  She let go and looked to Greeneyes.  &quot;Thank you,&quot; she whispered, a tear falling down her cheek.  <br>
Greeneyes raised a hand and made the motion of a hand caressing her cheek.  &quot;I love you too,&quot; she whispered softly.<br>
<br>
She was setting a small, blown-glass horse on her nightstand when she heard Jerem in the doorway.<br>
&quot;Birthday huh?&quot;  Her mom hadn't even acknowledged her when she came in.  Loreana nodded.<br>
&quot;Growin' up now.  Ain't that somethin.&quot;  He was drunk.  &quot;Didn't seem like that long ago you were just this little kid runnin' 'round the house.  Now look at you.&quot;  He was looking at her and she didn't like it.  &quot;All pretty and stuff.  Bet you got all the boys chasin' you now.&quot;  He turned around and staggered off.  &quot;Yea, all the boys.&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A> at: 5/13/02 3:46:48 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br>  Posts: 1643<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(5/13/02 2:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=50>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 41</span><hr size=1> Lora hadn't seen much of Cess lately.  Lora figured she had found a boyfriend.  She'd seen Cess with a couple of the guys.  They still hung out at the market, they still went to the stream, and they still talked.  There just wasn't as much time as there used to be.<br>
Lora still saw Tannara quite often, she had even learned a little magic from her, though not as much as she learned from Mara.  Tannara said they taught more to those who joined them.  There were a lot of secrets the forest held that if just anybody knew them, they would be abused and the forest would suffer.  Lora understood, but she wasn't sure about joining them just yet.  As always, Tannara deferred and said nothing more about it.<br>
<br>
She was learning a lot from Mara, as was Greeneyes.  Loreana didn't seem to grasp it as easily as her counterpart, but it didn't dissuade her.  She wanted to learn as much as she could and so spent more and more time with Mara.<br>
&quot;But Mom!&quot;  Lora couldn't believe her mom was sending her after Jerem.  Why didn't she get him herself?<br>
&quot;Don't back-talk me young lady.  Go down to the Cut and tell him his boss needs him now.  He'll meet him at the shop.&quot;  Merrie turned to Jerem's employer, &quot;I'm sorry, you know how kids are.&quot;<br>
That's all right Ma'am.  I'd go get him myself but if I don't get to the shop we'll loose the job.  I didn't know he was at the Cut or I'd have gone there myself.  It'd take me too long to back-track now,&quot; he apologized sincerely.<br>
&quot;Go on Lora!&quot;  Merrie called again as Lora stormed from her room.<br>
&quot;I'm sorry young lady.  I'd go myself but...&quot;<br>
&quot;Yea,&quot; Lora said disdainfully as she passed both of them on the way out.<br>
<br>
The Logger's Cut.  Thankfully, in the early afternoon, there weren't many people there.  Loreana saw who she thought was Jerem in the low light and inched her way in.<br>
&quot;Can I help you miss?  You sure you're in the right place?&quot;  Stiff asked her.<br>
&quot;Uhm, I'm looking for Jerem.  His boss wants him,&quot; she said uncertainly, hoping to just be able to pass along the message.<br>
&quot;Yep, he's right over there,&quot; Stiff pointed to one of the two men sitting at a table.  He turned and walked back to the bar.  No luck there.<br>
<br>
Dan whispered over to Jerem, &quot;That little cutie over there's looking for you.&quot; Jerem turned back in his chair to peer towards the door.  &quot;She your woman?&quot;<br>
Jerem shifted in his chair.  &quot;Uh, no.  That's her daughter Lora.&quot;  That elicited a low whistle from Dan that he tried to ignore.  &quot;What do you want girl?&quot; he asked, suddenly uncomfortable with Dan and the way the dim lights in the tavern made her look a lot older than she was.<br>
&quot;Your boss came by.  He needs you at work now.  Mom sent me to tell you.&quot;  Her gaze shifted to the man sitting at the other side of the table.<br>
<br>
His eyes were like pools of pure night, sucking in anything that fell near them.  She felt herself drawn in, heard whispering coming from somewhere deep within those black pits and the word 'Chosen'.  She blinked.<br>
&quot;You hear what I said?  Go on.  I'll get there,&quot; Jerem said for the second time.<br>
Loreana tore her gaze from Dan's and stalked back out the door.  Not quite sure what, if anything, had happened.<br>
&quot;Hell Jer, you didn't tell me she was that much of a looker.&quot;  Dan chuckled.  &quot;Fourteen you say?&quot;  He laughed again.<br>
&quot;Yea,&quot; Jer said absently as he watched her walk out the door.  &quot;Look, I gotta go now.  See you 'round.&quot;  He clasped Dan on the shoulder and downed the last of his ale.<br>
&quot;Yep, see you 'round Jer,&quot; Dan replied, kicking his feet up on the vacated chair.  &quot;See you 'round.&quot;<br>
<br>
The winter was a cold one, though not as harsh as two years before.  The first freeze came late the next month and kept everything frozen until the snow on the new year.<br>
It was near the end of the year when Greeneyes received a special gift from Mara.<br>
&quot;Greeneyes dear, you've done well, in my eyes and in the eyes of Gaervalen.&quot;  They stood back behind Mara's home where the little shrine stood.  It was cold but calm, their breath sent out clouds of steam.<br>
<br>
Lora stood nearby, smiling despite her ragged fatigue.  It was that time of the month and her nightmares had beaten her senseless over the last three days.  She was happy for Greeneyes though, so she wore her best face for her friend.<br>
&quot;Gaervalen shows his favor in those who serve him well,&quot; Mara carefully unwrapped the bundle she had carried outside with her.  &quot;He has show his favor with you Greeneyes Ironland.&quot;  The name still amused her after she heard its origin.  &quot;And for those so favored he grants special benevolence and title.&quot;  Mara unfurled an open-front cloak of emerald green.  Gold weave patterned similar to the knot on the head of her shattered staff raced along the hem, sleeves and hood.<br>
<br>
Greeneyes knelt before Mara, a broad smile of awe on her face.  Mara placed the cloak across her shoulders.<br>
&quot;Those so favored are also tasked with the responsibility that is the price of his benevolence.&quot;  She picked up a small box that Greeneyes swore was not on the shrine a moment before.  &quot;But know that his favored are never alone.&quot;  She opened the box and removed a small pendant and chain that appeared to be made of tiny, living vines.  &quot;Gaervalen walks with you, as you walk with him.&quot;  Mara placed it over Greeneyes head and left it to rest with the vines over her long, brown hair. <br>
Wear his symbol to show you walk in the shadow of the mighty Walker of the Woods, and in his shadow you are protected and empowered and only in his shadow will you learn his ways and become Oerskolna.&quot;  Mara stepped back and beamed proudly.  &quot;Now rise Favored of the Green God.  Rise Greeneyes Ironland, Oerskolna Initea Gaervalic.&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A> at: 5/13/02 3:47:30 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showMessageRange?topicID=18.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showMessageRange?topicID=18.topic&start=41&stop=43>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=18.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showNextMessage?topicID=18.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.mithrilheartbrigade.org/images/addreply1.png border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.emailToFriend?topicID=18.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.threadControl?topicID=18.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/black_default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=18.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=18.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub141.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themithrilheartbrigade7573generaldiscussion">General Discussion<option value="themithrilheartbrigade7573rosterofmembers">Roster of Members<option value="themithrilheartbrigade7573tradebuysell">Trade/buy/sell<option value="themithrilheartbrigade7573frm12">Tradeskills<option value="themithrilheartbrigade7573frm13">Stories<option value="themithrilheartbrigade7573frm36">Potential Introductions</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/bthemithrilheartbrigade7573>Mithril Heart Brigade Messages</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13>Stories</a> <font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href="http://www.mithrilheartbrigade.org">Home</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><br><br> <table><td><form><font size="-1" face="verdana, arial"><b>EverQuest Links:</b>
