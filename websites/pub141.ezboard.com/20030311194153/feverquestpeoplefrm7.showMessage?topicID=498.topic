When the storm settled there were very few of us left. Over time more people have left because we cannot raid and we have nothing to offer but friendship and some good times.<br>
<br>
In this time all of the officers except myself have either been caught up in RL stuff, left for another guild or to go lone wolf , or there schedules keep them from playing. I see myself in charge and begin to look at my choises. Let my guild die, merge with another guild, or leave and let them fend for themselves. So because I am a loyal person and I am stubborn to the end I prepare to merge with a guild that my guild has known for a long time and are a second family to me.<br>
<br>
About 2 days from cementing the merger with the leader of the other guild, One of our officers life schedule changes and he decides to start playing more and take the leader tag in hopes of rebuilding. I decide to let him and he takes over with the other guildleader and they decide to hold off to see if we can rebuild.<br>
<br>
Weeks have passed, the guild has gained a few new members and lost a few more. I log onto the message board Saturday to find that my guild is being disbanded, its being done to help people like me who are loyal to the guild and want to move on and do more things, but feel a loyalty to a guild that they have put 2+ years into.<br>
<br>
My guild has died, k its a fact I knew it was coming. I accepted it and began deciding what to do. I decide to just continue on with my tag for a bit but do some soloing to upgrade some gear and not worry about politics, finding a new guild, or anything else. <br>
<br>
<br>
The guild leader of the guild I was going to merge with and I have talked, since they are family I have an open invite.<br>
<br>
A bunch of my friends went to a good guild after they left us and I have done some raiding with them, good folks but I dunno if I'm ready for a &quot;Hey lets raid four times a week if ya want and watch for uber pops&quot; type guild<br>
<br>
These are the ones I am considering currently, they are the closest to what i want in a guild that I have seen.<br>
<br>
I log in yesterday for some lunch farming, and as I log in I get 3 tells, <br>
<br>
One was from one of the people who caused a lot of the stuff that brought the guild down, he wants to say hi he's back from time away and going to college, I do a who all and he is in one of the higher end guilds of our server. I dont really like this guy, there is way too much history with a few of the ladies that were in my guild he's said a few things to I dont agree with and he's been removed once for his conduct (I dont know the full story, but I know enough to know he is unstable *notes to ask Bodin the full story sometime*).Anyway he asks me about the guild and he wants to know who caused all of this. I had to bite my tongue and walk away from the keyboard for a minute or 2, when I come back he wants to know what i am going to for a new guild. I said I dunno yet,  then he offers to get me into his guild, saying we could use a 55 epic rogue who knows what he is doing (yeah that is me). I tell him I'll give it some thought and go on about my farming.<br>
<br>
The second tell I get is from a friend I hunted with while she was in the guild, nice girl an officer of a new guild on our server. Yep you guessed it she wants to know what I am gonna do about a guild, then proceeds to tell me that my &quot;friend&quot; the rogue twink (whom I have NO respect for but that is another story entirely) the wizard guild leader and a few others are applying to join and &quot;I should to !!!&quot; as they could really use a good rogue.<br>
<br>
<br>
The last tell I got was from a rogue friend who runs a semi rogue only guild on the server (its in its second phase, and is inviting all other classes now to expand its raiding field). He wants to find out if i am still selling something and we shoot the breeze for a few minutes. Then outta the blue he says &quot;You know that offer I made you when we did your epic still stands now, right? I reckon you'll be looking for a new home huh?&quot; I just chuckle and say I'm considering it...<br>
<br>
<br>
So I log off because lunch is over and i must go back and get my education OMG!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
/rant on<br>
<br>
I DONT WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT GUILD I AM GOING TO JOIN. I want to spend some time existing in EQ, talking to friends, enjoying stuff I hadnt gotten to do in a while, or just wondering aimlessly in the bazaar buying Ye Old Ball Peen Hammers and muffins.<br>
<br>
*shakes fist at people* would it shock the hell out of you if I decide to go lone wolf? OMG a mercenary for higher or just because? OMG not that the horror *Faints*<br>
<br>
RAGE RAWWWWWRRRRRRRR!!!!! K *hops up on the soap box and starts throwing waterballoons at people in a flustered gnomish red faced kinda way*<br>
 <br>
I am not going to join a guild that is going to REQUIRE me to raid at least 3 times a week because, OMG I have both school full time 8-3 and work part time 15 hours a week (within a seven day time frame)and I dont get to decide when I work (IE nights and weekends? I have nights and weekends? )<br>
*hits the ranger guy with a waterballoon*<br>
<br>
I'm also not going to join a guild that is going to want me because I am a 55 epic rogue with 4aapts (OMG so uber *rolls eyes*) <br>
*hits the lady with a waterballoon*<br>
<br>
If anything I will join a guild like my old one, one that loves to help people, has fun and *Gasps* has family values.<br>
*hits Bodin with a waterballoon**blinks* ah oh...*shrugs and throws another at him*<br>
<br>
I am sorely tempted to hang up my daggers and start over fresh with a new face and new name (Hell even maybe a new server), but then my rational mind takes over and I realized i have put way too much time into The damn gnome to just give him up, and I doubt I could play any other class for very long (once a rogue always a rogue hehe) <br>
*throws waterballoons randomly*<br>
<br>
/rant off<br>
<br>
<br>
k I feel a bit better now, I must purge this anger and rage by way of the exploding stick... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#77839D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub141.ezboard.com/ukarissmagentleheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karissma Gentleheart</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://tginc.net/images/hearts.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><TABLE STYLE=filter:Glow(color=#FF3366,strength=3><TR><TD><center><font color=#000000> <b> Huggable Motor Mouth </center></TABLE></font> </b></span><br>  Posts: 2095<br> <font color=#F7E5C3>(10/1/02 10:09:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/feverquestpeoplefrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=498.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://jen-pics.netfirms.com/karipink.jpg WIDTH=89 HEIGHT=115></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: No I have not decided</span><hr size=1> .....breath in with the good....<br>
