She heard her mom say something to him and his loud, drunken response.  Lora knew what was to come next and regretted coming home.<br>
The first slap echoed thought the walls and she wrapped the pillow tightly around her head.  She could still hear though.  Still hear Jerem's loud bellows, her mom's cries and the sounds of violence.  Every strike shook her to the bone and she cried for her mom and herself.<br>
<br>
She sat up abruptly in bed, the nightmare still fresh in her mind.  Pain cut through her, not the pain of the fire and magic but a physical pain.  A pain that burned in the pit of her stomach and below.  She leaned over and vomited on the floor as comprehension slowly dawned on her.<br>
&quot;Loreana.  Gods no!&quot;<br>
<br>
Loreana didn't know when he stopped hitting her mom, but she saw the door to her room open.  She shrank into a tight ball as he staggered in, the same black look in his eyes she had seen in the other man's.<br>
&quot;Where's my mom?&quot;<br>
&quot;Sleeping,&quot; was his answer as he shut the door behind him.<br>
She saw the look in his eyes and the blood on his knuckles and knew he lied.<br>
<br>
Mara barely made it out her door as Greeneyes flew by her, still in her nightclothes.  The druid gasped, her student's aura radiated the craft she had so desperately fought against.  Wrapping a shawl around her shoulders, she raced after Greeneyes.<br>
&quot;Greeneyes Ironland!&quot; she shouted as she saw her apprentice draw the first sigil and gather the wind to her.  As the wind formed her arcane transport, Mara heard her yell back, &quot;Not this time!  Not again!&quot;<br>
&quot;What?&quot;  Mara didn't understand her words.<br>
The wind whipped around her as Greeneyes looked over her shoulder.  &quot;Remember what you said Mara.  One child is more important than any of us.&quot;  She turned and motioned with her hand.  Gaining momentum, she quickly disappeared from sight.<br>
<br>
&quot;You sure have grown up pretty,&quot; Jerem said as he stumbled to her bed.  Lora started to roll off the other side but couldn't avoid his reach.<br>
&quot;Let go!&quot; she cried as he pulled her back towards him.  She heard her nightdress rip and started clawing at his hand.  In her fear it didn't occur to the girl to use her magic, though she couldn't have concentrated enough anyway.<br>
&quot;C'mere girl!  Yer not gonna back talk me like yer mom!&quot;<br>
She opened her mouth to scream but he clasped a hand over her mouth, deftly avoiding her teeth as he slammed her jaw shut.  Lora felt the sting and tasted blood as her teeth closed on the edge of her tongue.<br>
<br>
Greeneyes knew exactly where she was going.  Though she had never been to Loreana's house, she saw clearly the way the girl had taken to and from Mara's countless times.  Her craft carried her twice as fast as any horse, whether from the lighter load or the magnitude her power had grown, she didn't know.  Nor did she care.  She only knew that she pushed it as fast as the wind could carry her, and that she would still have enough power, more than enough, to stop a terrible crime and exact a horrible revenge.<br>
<br>
He pried her jaw open and stuffed a corner of her bed-sheet in it before she could let out more than a squeal.  He had planted his knee in her chest and only let up long enough to roll her over facedown half on, half off the bed.  She didn't know what was happening, couldn't fight her way up, and when she felt him rip apart her dress she did the only thing she could do: scream.<br>
<br>
She felt the pain, used it to fuel her rage.  Her rage, in turn, fueled her craft.  She didn't even notice the front door as it shattered before her, didn't see the broken and bloody body of Merrie Shahnra draped across the floor in the sitting room.  The door to Lora's room exploded inward.  Jerem, one hand holding down the screaming girl, the other on the waist of his breeches looked up in shock and drunken anger.  Blood trickled down a half dozen cuts caused by the force of the splintered wood.<br>
&quot;Who tha hell'r y...&quot; his question was cut off as Greeneyes held her hand up in a squeezing motion.<br>
&quot;Leave her alone you SON OF A BITCH!&quot;  A slight motion from her hand lifted Jerem off his feet and slammed him against the wall.  Lora rolled over, gathering the sheet around her as she spit out the edge.  Her eyes widened in renewed terror as she saw the creature that before had only been an image in her mind.  Greeneyes hovered half a foot off the floor, wind whipped around her like a tornado as a strange, purple-black light illuminated her.  Her eyes flashed like a demon's, the natural green burned a hundred times hotter causing her appearance to match the evil Lora felt washing over her.  Lora couldn't think.  From the Jerem's attack to her manifested nightmare, the trauma was shutting down her mind completely.<br>
&quot;Loreana, go.  This is not for you.&quot;  The quiet words echoed in her head as she saw the Greeneyes she knew and loved briefly turn her head, a plea across her face.<br>
The words spurred her to action and she tore our out of the room blindly, spared mercifully from the sight of her mother as she ran from her home for the last time.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who-who are you?&quot;  Jerem managed to croak out as he stared into the eyes of the demon.<br>
&quot;What?  You don't know me?&quot;  She screeched as she drifted closer to him.  &quot;I know you.  I remember.&quot;<br>
&quot;Re-remember?&quot;  His voiced dropped to a terrified whisper.<br>
&quot;Oh yes.  I remember.  Almost too late, but I remembered.&quot;<br>
Jerem could only open his mouth.  Remember what?<br>
&quot;YOU RAPED ME YOU SON OF A BITCH!&quot; she screamed, the fire burned thought the tears that fell to her cheeks.  The fire in her soul burned hotter than ever.  Her magic surged, reaching for the target of her rage.<br>
Jerem could only shake his head as rivulets of sweat poured down his face.  She was crazy.  What was she talking about?<br>
&quot;A child,&quot; she said in a low, sad voice.  &quot;But not again.  I won't let it happen again.  Not to her.  Not to anyone.&quot;<br>
A single scream echoed from the house, then there was only silence.<br>
<br>
Galbreath and his friends had just finished a night's revelry at the Cut and were headed home.  Laughing and loudly joking they staggered through the square.  Gal saw her first and waved, shouting hoarsely.<br>
&quot;Hail fair maid.  Lookin' fer a good man ta finish the night off with?&quot;  A few of his friends shouted in agreement while others punched him, merrily warning him to behave.<br>
Galbreath's cheerfulness was subdued, as were his friends, when he got close enough to see the haunted look on her face and the black rage in her eyes.  Making signs to whatever god they claimed, the group of men quickly made a wide berth around the woman's path and few words passed between them the rest of the night.<br>
<br>
Greeneyes wandered aimlessly the rest of the night.  Her rage slowly burned itself away and her craft returned to its sleep.  By the time the sun began to rise she found herself on the small hill by the stream south of town.<br>
She was spent, emotionally and physically.  The night's events were a blur, from when she awoke in Mara's house in pain to her vengeful murder of Jerem.  Greeneyes only knew she let the other, the Sapphire Witch, come to life and utterly control her actions.  She wanted to cry but couldn't.  She let it happen, let the evil overtake her and drive her to revenge an event she didn't understand.  A premonition or a memory?  She shook her head and hugged herself tightly.  It didn't make sense.<br>
Though she had saved Loreana, Greeneyes allowed the girl to see the creature thought finally buried.  She had to return to Mara's.  Hopefully Loreana had run there, but she dreaded seeing her teacher now.  How utterly she failed Mara, failed Gaervalen, and failed herself.  Greeneyes feared what she did to Loreana though, was much worse.<br>
It was midmorning when she found the strength to return home.<br>
<br>
On the opposite side of the hill, the side away from town, two young girls slept.  The youngest held tightly to the other, her chestnut hair draped across the shoulder of her friend, eyelids shut over brilliant green eyes that were still red from crying herself to sleep.<br>
<br>
&quot;What have you done?&quot;  Mara stood outside her door as if she had been standing there all night.  Indeed, she had, interrupting her vigil only long enough to dress.  Of Loreana there was no sign.<br>
&quot;What have you done Oerskolna?&quot;  This cut Greeneyes deeply, reminding her of a greater betrayal.<br>
&quot;No.  Cry no tears Oerskolna.  This is your own doing.  You gave in.  Willingly.  Even calling for this power.&quot;<br>
&quot;He was going to rape her,&quot; Greeneyes said painfully.<br>
The statement caught Mara off guard but she quickly regained her composure.  &quot;And you saved her?&quot;  A nod from her apprentice.  &quot;And then?&quot;<br>
Greeneyes wanted to look away, to stare at the ground, or the clouds, but she couldn't break the lock the druid had on her eyes.<br>
&quot;I killed him.&quot;<br>
&quot;With your magic.&quot;<br>
She nodded, unable to answer.<br>
&quot;With the magic of the Sapphire Witch?&quot; A statement more than a question.  Another nod.<br>
&quot;Answer me Oerskolna Gaervalic!  With the magic of...&quot;<br>
&quot;With the magic of the Sapphire Witch!&quot; Greeneyes cried.  &quot;With the magic of the Sapphire Witch I ripped his flesh from his body and rent him limb from limb while he yet lived and I ENJOYED IT!  I ENJOYED IT!&quot; she screamed it over and over.  Wails of anguish tore from her throat as she finally released the bitter sorrow over her actions.  &quot;Mara I enjoyed it.&quot;  Her legs collapsed from under her and Mara rushed to her side.  &quot;I did it for her.  I couldn't let it happen Mara.&quot;  She looked up at the old woman.  &quot;Even if it cost me my soul I couldn't let it happen.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh, child,&quot; Mara cradled her head gently.  &quot;Don't you understand?  After all this time don't you understand?&quot;  She brushed Greeneyes hair back, running her fingers through the white streak.  &quot;You saved her in body and perhaps mind but I told you before, your spirit, your soul is one.  The damage you do to yours you do to hers as well.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes shivered as bitter tears fell to the ground.  &quot;Where is she?&quot;<br>
&quot;She did not come back,&quot; Mara said evenly.<br>
&quot;She'll go to them then,&quot; Greeneyes whispered.  &quot;The wichta.&quot;  She felt Mara nod.  &quot;She and Cess will join the caeban.&quot;  She closed her eyes tightly.  &quot;And I drove her to them.&quot;<br>
&quot;Cess is already an apprentice.&quot;  Greeneyes turned her head to look up at Mara.  &quot;She joined last year after she turned thirteen.  They gave her the name C'ara.  It was only a matter of time before Loreana went as well.  There was little we could do to stop her.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes stiffened.  &quot;Last year?  C'ara.&quot;<br>
Mara nodded again but Greeneyes didn't notice.  She began hyperventilating.  Her mind was reeling.  A face, a young woman screaming through pain and fire.  'Your amulet!  Call to your father!'  Then it was gone.<br>
&quot;Oh Mara!&quot;  She stood up swiftly causing Mara to loose her balance. &quot;No. No. No.  She can't join.  I can't let her!&quot;<br>
&quot;Greeneyes.&quot;<br>
&quot;No.  You don't understand.&quot;  She was moving in circles trying to grasp her own thoughts.  Mara was certain her hold on sanity was slipping.  &quot;Oh gods how?  Right there in front of me, but how?&quot;<br>
&quot;What dear, what?&quot;  Mara tried to grab hold of her, to calm her.<br>
&quot;Oh Mara, you were right but so very wrong.&quot;  She turned towards the druid, a wild look in her eyes.  &quot;I've got to stop her.  I can't let her join.&quot;<br>
&quot;But you don't even know where she is.  I've never been able to locate the caeban.&quot;<br>
&quot;I know where she is Mara.  If only I can make it on time.&quot;<br>
&quot;By your promise to Gaervalen don't you dare!&quot;  Mara warned.<br>
&quot;No, no.  I won't use my magic but I must go.&quot;  She bolted away from the confused druid and down the path.<br>
Mara stood there, feeling both women slipping from her grasp.  &quot;Gaervalen walk with her,&quot; she said quietly.  &quot;With them both.&quot;  She turned and walked back inside.<br>
<br>
The rapping on her window finally woke her from a deep slumber.<br>
&quot;Lora?&quot;  She pushed open the window.  The cool night air sent a shiver down her spine.  That and the sight of her best friend, wrapped in a sheet and looking more scared, more alone than she ever had before.<br>
Cess held out her hand to help Lora crawl in the window.  &quot;What's wrong?&quot; she asked when her friend only shook her head looking more fearful of going inside than standing outside.  &quot;Are you cold?&quot; Cess didn't understand Lora's bizarre behavior.<br>
&quot;I need something to wear,&quot; Lora said timidly.<br>
Cess looked at her then grabbed a dress she had tossed aside after her mother had washed it.  Handing it over to Lora she watched as Lora threw the sheet over her head and changed right where she stood.  Cess could only stare in confusion as Loreana dropped the sheet and torn nightdress to the side and said, &quot;I want to join.  Tonight.&quot;<br>
Cess opened her mouth then shut it.  &quot;C'mon.&quot;  She climbed out the window and grabbed Lora's hand.<br>
She didn't realize where Cess was taking her until they started up the hill.<br>
Loreana stopped in her tracks.  &quot;Where are we going?&quot;<br>
&quot;To our spot.  Where do you think?&quot;<br>
&quot;I said I wanted to join the caeban.&quot;<br>
Cess grabbed her hand and continued dragging her over the hill to the far side.  &quot;You can't join.  Not tonight anyway.&quot;<br>
&quot;Why not?&quot;<br>
Cess let out a noisy breath.  &quot;You just can't.  You have to talk to Tannara first.&quot;  She sat her friend down under a tree and sat across from her.<br>
&quot;Lora.  What happened?  Why was your nightshirt torn?  Why were you knocking...Lora?&quot;<br>
Loreana started shaking.  Her shoulders heaving as her emotions let loose in a torrent.<br>
Cess took her best friend in her arms and held her.  She didn't understand, but it didn't matter.  She was there for her.  As she always would be.<br>
<br>
They weren't on the hill.  She ran full circle, never slowing, calling both girls' names then ran toward the forest.  It was over a mile away but aching muscles and the tightness in her stomach didn't stop her until she caught sight of them both just entering the tree line.<br>
&quot;Loreana!&quot;<br>
Cess felt her friend tense up, like she wanted to run.  Then Lora turned toward the approaching woman.<br>
&quot;Go on Cess.  I'll catch up.&quot;<br>
Cess looked at her quizzically.  &quot;You sure?&quot;<br>
Lora hissed fiercely, &quot;Go!&quot;<br>
The command confused Cessara, but she gave Lora's hand a squeeze and moved off into the woods, looking back the whole time until she couldn't see them any longer.<br>
Loreana stood there, willing herself to stand still, even though her fear urged her to run.  Run far away from the woman she thought was a friend.  The friend who had taken the form of a nightmare.<br>
&quot;What do you want?&quot;<br>
Greeneyes stopped abruptly, her voice came to her between pants.  &quot;Loreana.  I can't ask you to forgive me.  I wish it were that easy.&quot;<br>
&quot;It's not.&quot;  Lora said, wishing the tear had not fallen from her eye when she said it.<br>
Greeneyes shook her head.  &quot;I know.  I betrayed you.  I wanted to save you from that monster and I became a bigger monster.&quot;<br>
&quot;He was going to...&quot; Lora started, looking down at her feet.<br>
&quot;No.  Don't say it.  He didn't.  But he would have.&quot;<br>
&quot;I could have fought him.  I could have used my magic, scared him,&quot; she tried to convince herself.<br>
&quot;No.  How I wish that were true.  But you couldn't have.  He was too heavy and he knocked the wind out of you when he put his knee in your chest.&quot;<br>
&quot;I could have!  Why did you have to use your magic?  Why did you have to be so weak!&quot; she screamed.<br>
&quot;I saw it Loreana.  I felt it.  I woke from the nightmare I lived and knew I couldn't let it happen to you.&quot;<br>
&quot;What are you talking about?  It wasn't happening to you.&quot;  She was crying now, all her control lost.  She wished Cess were here now.<br>
&quot;But it did.  It's all happened to me.  That's why I can't let you join them.&quot;<br>
&quot;Join them?&quot;  Lora had never discussed the caeban with Greeneyes or Mara.  Mara had found out anyway and told Greeneyes.  &quot;What do you know about it?  Who said...&quot;<br>
&quot;I know everything about it Lora.  I know about Tannara, about the caeban, about L'cia and C'ara.&quot;<br>
Lora blinked.  &quot;C'ara?  Who's C'ara?&quot;<br>
&quot;Cess.  Cessara.  She joined last year.  Didn't she tell you?  That's her given name.  The name the caeban gives you when you join.&quot;<br>
&quot;Name?&quot;  Lora was confused.  Why was she telling her all of this?  &quot;How do you know this stuff?  Why are you doing this to me!&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm trying to save you Lora.  Don't you understand?  You can't go to them.&quot;<br>
&quot;Why?  Why not?  I want to!  I don't have anything anymore!&quot;  She hysterically cried, &quot;You've ruined everything!&quot;<br>
&quot;Take my hand Loreana.&quot;<br>
Lora stumbled back and fell, stark fear in her eyes, &quot;NO!&quot;<br>
&quot;I want to show you.  I want to show you what happened to me.  What will happen to you if you go to them.&quot;<br>
&quot;What happened to you!  Not me!  I've seen what you were.&quot;  She hesitated.  &quot;What you are!  That's not me!&quot;<br>
&quot;Take my hand!&quot;  Greeneyes was terrified herself, but she was loosing Lora, if she hadn't already lost her.  This was the only thing she could do.  Make Lora see what she was still trying to grasp herself.  She dove for the girl's hand and held it in an iron grip.<br>
She tried to control it.  Greeneyes pushed the magic deep but the images assaulted them.  The nightmare's returned, but this time accompanied by new visions.  The caeban, faces Lora recognized or thought she recognized, magic and evil.  Always the green, fiery eyes and flashing white striped hair of her friend turned demon.<br>
Loreana tore away, screaming.  &quot;Leave me alone!  You're a monster!  A demon!&quot;<br>
&quot;Don't you see?&quot; Greeneyes cried.  &quot;This was my coven Lora. I was one of them.  My life was gone.  I let the hatred and the emptiness overwhelm me.  I thought the magic could change my life.  I thought that through sheer power I could take back everything I'd lost.&quot;<br>
&quot;I can.  Tannara told me.  Cess told me.&quot;  She was backing slowly away now.  <br>
&quot;My name Lora.  Do you know the name they gave me?&quot;  Lora didn't answer as she scrambled to her feet.  Greeneyes didn't dare move.<br>
&quot;I don't care!  It's your life.  You screwed it up!&quot;<br>
&quot;L'ree.  I was Sapphire L'ree of the Nine Pale Hands.&quot;<br>
The girl ran, disappearing into the trees before Greeneyes could follow.<br>
&quot;Remember my name Lora!&quot; she shouted, choking on tears.  &quot;Remember my name!&quot;<br>
<br>
Cessara heard the shout just before Lora ran past her.  &quot;Her name?  Lora?&quot;  She had to run to catch up.  &quot;What happened?&quot;<br>
&quot;Doesn't matter,&quot; Lora said when she finally slowed to a walk and wiped the tears from her eyes.  &quot;She doesn't matter anymore.&quot;<br>
Cess was confused but took her hand and led her to the spot that would take them to the caeban's hidden location.<br>
<br>
Mara turned from her cooking when she heard the door open.  &quot;Did you find her...who are you?&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh, we found her, druid.  I am a messenger.&quot;  The dark figure stalked in the door and was followed by four others.  Black robes covered their features but she knew them for what they were.  &quot;We bring a message from Jade L'cia of the Nine Pale Hands.  Your interference is at an end.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cess curtsied deeply before T'ara and prompted Lora to do the same.  &quot;Sponsor T'ara, as I am not of rank to do so, I would be honored if you would sponsor my friend, Loreana Shahnra, and bring her before the caeban this eve to judge her worthiness as an apprentice.&quot;  The phrase left her out of breath and she grinned at Lora and T'ara.<br>
&quot;Apprentice C'ara.  Are you sure you approach this with the respect it warrants?&quot;  C'ara stopped smiling, looking chastised before T'ara grinned back.  &quot;Of course I would be honored to sponsor your friend.  I believe she would be a worthy addition to our caeban.&quot;<br>
Cess and Lora both smiled now.  T'ara turned to Loreana.  &quot;And are you, Loreana Shahnra, prepared to approach the Mistress of the Nine Pale Hands?<br>
Lora already knew the caeban's name, but hearing it again sent a chill down her spine.  She glanced nervously at Cess who continued to grin and nodded to give her strength.  &quot;I, Loreana Shahnra, ask for your sponsorship and would be honored if you presented me before your Mistress.&quot;<br>
&quot;Then rise Loreana and join me.&quot;  T'ara opened her arms and accepted the girl's embrace, kissing her on the forehead.  &quot;Don't be nervous Lora.  It will go fine.  You're amongst family now.&quot;  T'ara smiled at her and gave her another hug.<br>
<br>
Greeneyes stayed there, kneeling by an old oak, hoping Lora would come back and knowing she wouldn't.  She hung her head, exhaustion finally overtaking her.<br>
&quot;Who am I?&quot; she asked the oak.<br>
&quot;Don't you know, Oerskolna?&quot; the oak responded.<br>
&quot;No.&quot;<br>
&quot;Whom do you choose to be?&quot;<br>
&quot;What?&quot;<br>
&quot;You can not walk both paths.  Who do you choose to be?&quot;<br>
&quot;I cannot see either path.  How do I know which to walk?&quot;<br>
&quot;You know how the one ends.&quot;<br>
&quot;Fire.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes.  You have walked that path.  You can walk it again, but this time you do not walk alone.&quot;<br>
&quot;Will you walk with me?&quot;<br>
&quot;Do you still not understand?&quot; Mara asked.<br>
&quot;Loreana.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; the oak responded.<br>
&quot;Can she choose which path to walk?&quot;<br>
&quot;Her path is yours for she is blind.  Would you take her to fire?&quot;<br>
&quot;Twice the path will be walked,&quot; the demon said.<br>
&quot;No.&quot;<br>
&quot;The other path lies in my shadow and the shadow of others, but the choice is yours alone.&quot;<br>
&quot;Is the path an easy one?&quot;<br>
&quot;The easy path is rarely the right path.&quot;<br>
&quot;Can I make the choice now?&quot;<br>
&quot;Now, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow.  The choice will be before you every step you take.  But be warned, every step you take toward fire will be two you take from the other.&quot;<br>
&quot;Where does the path end?&quot;<br>
&quot;Where the Child of Shadow and Light is joined, one prophecy ends, another begins,&quot; the old dwarf answered.<br>
She opened her eyes and looked up at the giant oak.  &quot;Prophecy?&quot;<br>
The oak did not answer. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A> at: 5/13/02 3:48:26 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/22/02 4:32:49 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 43</span><hr size=1> It was near mid-eve, the change of the candle, when they gathered in the grove.  Loreana and Cess were seated to either side of T'ara on a hewn oaken bench.  Lora was nervous, and Greeneyes words bothered her but she pushed them back in her mind as she saw the woman step to the center of the gathering.<br>
L'cia turned full circle, gazing upon her Wichta.  All were in attendance but five.  Those five had a special mission and she instructed them not to return until the sun rose.<br>
&quot;Attend my Caeban.&quot;  Her voice rang across the grove.  &quot;The Nine Pale Hands greet those who come to join us this eve. As new blood enters our veins we are strengthened.  Youth firms our steps and lengthens our stride.  We welcome you. Sponsors bring your petitioners before us.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Every year she returned here, to the ruins of the old druid's home. Every year she allowed herself the only tears she would cry.<br>
Why? Why did she return here, year after year? Why did she suffer these useless emotions of regret and mourning? Why?<br>
&quot;Why? Only now do you ask why, Child?&quot;<br>
Sapphire L'ree jumped slightly, turning left and right to find the source of the voice. &quot;Who are you? Show yourself.&quot;<br>
A pale, misty form appeared from the ruins. A gentle face peered at the Sapphire Wichta. &quot;Do you not remember, Child. Every year you come here and you do not remember?&quot;<br>
&quot;Mara.&quot; <br>
The shade smiled.<br>
&quot;Why do you show yourself after all these years?&quot;<br>
&quot;Because only now you ask why.&quot; Mara's shade crossed ethereal hands in front of her. &quot;Even though you've always known.  Let me ask you, Sapphire L'ree of the Nine Pale Hands, why was I here?&quot;<br>
&quot;To keep watch over the Caeban,&quot; the look on Mara's face prompted for more. &quot;To prevent the Caeban from recruiting the children of Tannor's Stand.&quot;<br>
&quot;Almost correct. To prevent them from recruiting <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> one</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> child from Tannor's Stand. As you know I failed.&quot;<br>
&quot;Me? But why?&quot;<br>
&quot;Ah, to begin to answer that question you must first answer 'Who?'&quot;<br>
&quot;L'cia.&quot;<br>
The shade nodded sadly. Not as much for the answer as for the response it evoked. She could feel L'ree's Craft rising in anger.<br>
&quot;Betrayer!&quot; the Wichta hissed. L'ree's eyes flashed with a dim, emerald light. As a foul breeze rose up around her, Mara's shade faded slowly.<br>
&quot;Do not give in to your anger Loreana, it will destroy you.&quot;<br>
&quot;It is too late for that, Mara. After all these years I now realize it. The pieces now hint at the greater puzzle. It is time for me to go.&quot;<br>
&quot;Loreana...&quot;<br>
&quot;Loreana is dead.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
She must have slept for it was well into the night when she rose and rushed to Mara's home.<br>
The smell of smoke caused her stomach to lurch.  Greeneyes ran the remaining way down the trail until the last turn. It was strong, too strong to be the fireplace, and it smelled wrong.<br>
&quot;Mara!&quot;  She screamed when she saw the smoke rising from the ruins of the druid's home.  The fire was long out but the remains of the roof and inside still smoldered.  Gray smoke wafted lazily in the breeze as Greeneyes warily approached the ruins.<br>
She felt it.  Magic.  Magic like her own.  Her craft tried to answer but she pushed it back.  They had been here, others like her.  She poked through the ruins.  Not just a fire but an explosion had destroyed the house.  The aura of the craft made her skin tingle.  Craft and Gaervalen's magic.  Her head swam as she entered the remains of the kitchen.  She knew what she would find and she didn't know if she had the strength to continue.<br>
<br>
&quot;Loreana Shahnra.  Would you give of your life, your spirit, to mix with that of those around you?&quot;<br>
Lora knelt in her apprentice robes before L'cia, head raised toward the Mistress of the Nine Pale Hands.  She wasn't shaking anymore, not on the outside anyway.  Cess had coached her over and over as they walked through the forest on what to say and do for the ceremony.<br>
&quot;I give my life and spirit to the Nine Pale Hands that it will gain strength with my youth and power with my vigor.&quot;<br>
&quot;Then sup from the cup of our spirit that it may intermingle with yours and our strength shall be as one, our thoughts as one in service to the Children of Gaervalen.&quot;<br>
The Jade Wichta handed Lora a large, golden cup filled with the heady drink. The Caeban's Mistress had not seen Guptras leaving her tent earlier.  L'cia looked on as Loreana raised the cup to her lips and took the single sip required.<br>
A gasp rose from the gathering.  Whispers raced through the ranks as the girl put the drink down.  Lora looked around, not sure if it was part of the ceremony or not.  She heard the word 'Omen' more than once.<br>
An omen for sure, thought L'cia, a good one.  She saw the white streak race from the child's forehead through her hair, parting it down the middle.<br>
Loreana looked down into the cup and she caught her reflection as L'cia spoke.<br>
&quot;Rise and meet your Caeban, Apprentice.  Rise and be known from this day forward as L'ree.  Apprentice Wichta of the Nine Pale Hands.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nooo!&quot;  Greeneyes screamed.  Screamed when she saw the charred remains of her teacher and friend, screamed because she knew Loreana was now one of the Caeban.  Screamed because she had failed.<br>
<br>
Lora didn't scream.  She couldn't find her voice, her thoughts chaotic and overwhelming.  The world spun as she rose and ran past Cess and T'ara into the forest.  Cess made to follow but was stopped by L'cia.  <br>
&quot;Let her go.  She will be back.  We are her family now.&quot;  She patted the girl's shoulder and turned to walk away.  &quot;She will be back.&quot;  L'cia sent her thoughts racing to her five Wichta.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Bring me the girl, unharmed.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Do you understand now?&quot;  Mara's voice rose from the ashes.  Greeneyes didn't know if she was dreaming or hallucinating.&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't know.  I can't get my mind around it.  How did I come to be here?&quot;<br>
&quot;I can't answer that question.  You must find the answers yourself.  The answers will guide you down the right path.&quot;<br>
&quot;Lora...is me, when I was younger.  Isn't she?&quot;<br>
&quot;You know the answer to that question.  You have for a while.&quot;<br>
&quot;I couldn't accept it.  I didn't even want to consider it.  Now that I know, even without understanding, it's too late.&quot;  She hung her head.<br>
&quot;Is it?  Is that the choice you make?  Fire?  For her as well as yourself.&quot;<br>
&quot;No.  But...&quot;<br>
&quot;Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.  You still have a choice.  Will you leave the answers hidden and take Loreana to fire?&quot;<br>
&quot;No!&quot;<br>
&quot;Then choose.  She comes, as do the others.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes head snapped up.  She heard running and rose swiftly.  If it was Loreana, she wanted to spare her the sight of Mara's remains, if it was the others...<br>
&quot;Mara!&quot;  Lora ran full bore towards the ruins but stopped short when she saw the one who was now almost a mirror image.<br>
&quot;How?&quot;  Lora asked quietly.  &quot;What's going on?&quot;  She was still crying.  &quot;Who are you?&quot;  Her breath caught in a great sob.  &quot;Who am I?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't understand it Lora but I know who I am, who I was.&quot;<br>
&quot;You're me, aren't you?&quot;  Lora asked as she dried her face.  Greeneyes nodded.  &quot;They gave me my name, like you said.  L'ree.&quot;<br>
Greeneyes nodded again but said, &quot;It's not your name though.  It's mine.  The burden is mine.  There's too much wrong, too much pain in that name.&quot;  She caressed the girl's face across the distance, the familiar action of a friend.  &quot;You will always be Loreana Shahnra.  That's why I'm here.&quot;<br>
&quot;Why are you here?&quot;  The girl asked softly.<br>
&quot;Somebody gave me - no, you - a second chance.&quot;  She paced through the ashes.  &quot;I don't know who or why, but...&quot; she looked into the woods.  &quot;They're coming.&quot;<br>
Lora looked over her shoulder.  &quot;Who?  The caeban?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes.  They want you back.  It was they who did this.&quot;<br>
&quot;Mara!&quot;  Lora hissed fiercely.<br>
&quot;No.  It's too late for her.&quot;  Lora opened her mouth in silent protest.  &quot;Give me your robe, quick.&quot;  Lora pulled the apprentice garb over her head and tossed it.  &quot;Now go.  Hide in the fireplace.  Do not come out no matter what!&quot;<br>
&quot;Don't leave me.&quot;  The girl pleaded.  &quot;Not now.&quot;<br>
&quot;They come for you and I will not let them have you.&quot;<br>
Lora made to protest then turned and ducked into the fireplace, dragging burnt wreckage to cover her retreat.<br>
&quot;Gaervalen help me,&quot; Greeneyes said as she walked clear of the ruins to meet the coming assassins.<br>
&quot;Apprentice L'ree.  Mistress L'cia has instructed us to guide you back.&quot;<br>
She didn't want to go.  Greeneyes didn't fear for herself.  She feared her magic would awaken, that they would force her hand when they discovered it was not the young apprentice L'ree they had, but an imposter.  Her ring still safely on her hand she wondered if its magic would stand against a scrying by a Jade Wichta.<br>
She nodded solemnly, so they would not hear the more mature timbre to her voice, and walked away from her frightened twin.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are not Apprentice L'ree.&quot;  L'cia immediately saw that the full-grown woman standing before her was not her fourteen year-old apprentice.<br>
&quot;No.&quot;  Said Greeneyes, grimly amused.  &quot;I am not the apprentice.&quot;<br>
Her craft rolled open one sleepy eye.<br>
&quot;Where is the child, imposter?&quot;  L'cia's temper had always been quick.<br>
&quot;Safe.  Where your Wichta cannot reach her.&quot;  She only wished it were true.<br>
&quot;Oh?  There is little beyond our reach.  If you will not return to us what is ours then you will die...and we will have her anyway,&quot; L'cia said confidently.  &quot;Take her.&quot;  She motioned toward her assassins.<br>
&quot;No.&quot;  Greeneyes said loudly so those around them would hear.  &quot;I invoke the Trigata Tuprani.&quot;  The other eye of the beast rolled lazily open.  Wichta nearby turned at the call of the Blood Trial.<br>
&quot;You may not,&quot; L'cia snapped, outraged.  &quot;No-&quot;<br>
&quot;No what, Mistress L'cia?  No outsider, no apprentice may call the Blood Trial?&quot;  Greeneyes ripped the ring from her finger.  &quot;Scry me then.  Read my aura and tell those around you what you see.  Tell them what many of them are now seeing for themselves.&quot;<br>
L'cia waved her hand before her as her eyes rolled up in her head.  Greeneyes heard the word pass from Wichta to Wichta.  L'cia's eyes snapped back and she gasped.<br>
&quot;Sapphire!  Your aura is L'ree's but-&quot;<br>
&quot;You've broken the pact L'cia.  Your assassins killed the Druid Mara by your command.  You've been dealing with the minions of the Black God.&quot;<br>
She was undone.  Tricked.  L'cia felt her plans crumbling but did not panic.  She had to deal with this quickly.  This Sapphire witch would die, then she might be able to recover.  L'cia could still hide her tracks and continue on.<br>
Greeneyes felt her magic rising in answer to L'cia's.  She didn't know what to do.  If L'cia attacked, she wouldn't be able to hold her off with her own craft.  She would probably die either way.  She shouldn't have come.  Loreana would be alone and unable to resist when they came for her.<br>
<br>
Then she felt it.  The image flashed through her mind as the stench of decay and death reached her nostrils.  L'cia stopped in mid-spell.  The hulking demon rose before her, blocking her view.  It's retched breath washed over Greeneyes.  Panic overcame the caeban.  Lesser Wichta and apprentices ran, the more powerful began casting.<br>
&quot;I didn't summon you this time!&quot;  Greeneyes screamed over the din.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Twice called, twice served, twice the path shall be walked.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Its voice rumbled as it turned toward L'cia.<br>
Greeneyes' breath quickened.  She looked around frantically, she didn't see Cess.  She hoped she was far away.  She knew she was, somehow.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Kractogra.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  The demon pointed a huge, rotting finger at the caeban's Mistress.<br>
The ground around her feet burst as skeletal hands reached up for her.  Pale talons ripped through her robe and clawed deep furrows in her legs.  She screamed as blood pooled around her feet and the hands grabbed her.  Slowly they pulled her down into the blood soaked soil.  She scraped and clawed at the hands as they dragged her into the ground.<br>
The demon had turned its attention to the other Wichta and they fell.  Greeneyes stood, dazed as she watched each one struck down.  With every one that died, their face a mask of terror, Greeneyes knew that it had all happened before.  <br>
<br>
Lora heard someone coming and she shrank further into the fireplace.<br>
&quot;Lora!&quot;<br>
&quot;Greeneyes!&quot;  She burst from her hiding place.  &quot;What-what happened?&quot; she asked, afraid of what she might hear.<br>
&quot;It doesn't matter.  We're safe, for now.&quot;<br>
&quot;It doesn't matter?&quot;  Lora cried.  &quot;Did you use your magic?&quot;<br>
&quot;No...not exactly.&quot;<br>
&quot;Not exactly?  What does that-&quot;<br>
&quot;I didn't!  That's all that matters!&quot;  She saw the beaten look on the girl's face.  &quot;No.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to... I didn't use it.  Don't worry.&quot;<br>
&quot;They're dead though, aren't they?&quot;<br>
Greeneyes' looked downward.  &quot;Some.  I don't know.&quot;<br>
&quot;Cess?&quot;<br>
The woman looked up.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> 'The amulet!'</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&quot;She's fine.  I don't know where...&quot;<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> 'Call to your father!'</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
