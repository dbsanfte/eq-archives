Only what I’ve seen in my visions.”<br>
Lora closed her eyes and spoke of their father, Brian Shahnra.  She talked about his smile, his strength, and the happiness he brought her and Merrie.  Greeneyes knew then why she felt sadness and loss when he died.<br>
<br>
“He gave you something…that night.”  She prompted.<br>
“My necklace.”  Lora fumbled at her dress and pulled up the chain and locket.  “He said he loved me.  He said to always-“<br>
“-Make the right choices,” Greeneyes finished.  “And I failed him.”  She closed her eyes to staunch the tears and failed.  “Daddy, I failed you.  Forgive me.”  She put her head in her hands and dropped to her knees.  Lora came closer and almost touched her.<br>
“But you’re here now.  Somehow.  A second chance, you said.”<br>
“But I’m failing!  I try to control my magic, and when it matters the most I fail!”  She looked up for the answers she knew the girl did not have.  “People keep dying.  Father, Mother…Mara, the witches.  It’s all happened before!  I can’t control it and I keep finding the path I walked before!”  Greeneyes shook her head violently.  “I don’t know where to go now Lora.  I’m lost.  I’m here to save you somehow and I can’t even save myself!”  She pounded her fists on her thighs.<br>
<br>
She couldn’t stand to see Greeneyes this way.  Lora needed her to be strong.  “Why did you ask about my necklace?”<br>
Greeneyes answered cautiously.  She didn’t want to think about the young woman whose face she saw screaming in pain.  “I saw it in one of my dreams.  Why did he give it to you on that night?  Why would I remember it, unless…”<br>
“Unless he knew something was going to happen.  He was sad.  I still remember his sadness when he gave it to me.”  She turned the pendant over in her hands.  “I’ve never taken it off.  I haven’t thought about it for so long.”  She popped it open.  “Daddy, Mommy.”  Lora looked through tears at the pictures within and touched them longingly with her fingertips.<br>
“May I?”  Greeneyes gently motioned for the pendant and Lora passed it to her.<br>
Their fingers did not touch, but as the pendant passed from one hand to the next they heard his voice.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>’My dearest daughter Loreana.  Love of my life.  I wish that this day had not come.  I wanted to say goodbye so badly but I didn’t want to frighten you.”<br>
I failed, very long ago, and bargained my life to my god so that you would have a second chance in your life if you ever needed it.  The second chance I never got at destroying an evil that I knew would come for me…and you…eventually.  When I saw that woman at festival today, I knew that your second chance was already upon you, in a way more terrible yet more awesome than I ever could have imagined.  Find the one who could be your sister and never leave her side.  When you have found her, seek Barradurn of T’ro’adon in the city of Derek, Daerga Ka.”<br>
I don’t know what horrible twist of fate has brought us to this day and I wish I could guide you further.  I love you my dearest child.  Tell her I love her too.  Tell her…I am so very sorry.’</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
“It’s all my fault,” Greeneyes finally said.  Lora just hung her head, silently crying after hearing her father’s voice again.  “Anger was all I had, all I was.  I thought the power would solve everything.  I thought I could bring everything I had lost back.”<br>
Lora moved toward Greeneyes.<br>
“No, don’t.”<br>
“Yes.  I want to.  You can’t carry so much yourself.”<br>
“I have to Lora.  It’s my burden, my price.”<br>
Lora continued forward.  Greeneyes shied away.<br>
“No.  You don’t have to carry it all.  These are the choices I would have made if you were not here now.  Let me share it…please…I…I need to hold somebody.  I’m willing to pay for that.”  She brought her hand close to Greeneyes face.  It was shaking.<br>
“No,” Greeneyes whispered, but she wanted it too.  She felt so alone and so scared.  She looked up at Lora and, steeling herself, grabbed her in a fierce embrace that was returned just as strongly.<br>
<br>
Loreana opened her mind and heart to the nightmares and saw them for what they were.  The life Greeneyes lived as a price to save her life and her soul.  They held each other through the deluge until it finally receded, like the tide after a storm.  Lora then returned her own images and dreams.  Dreams of her father and mother, the friends she had in Miera Kiy, all of the happy moments they shared before tragedy swallowed her life.  Lora gave Greeneyes these memories so the woman would not feel so alone any more.  What happiness Loreana had in her life she willingly shared with her other self.<br>
<br>
“Pippen.”<br>
“Pippen?”<br>
“My love.  The one that brought me so much happiness while I was in Miera Kiy.”  The two women still held each other tightly.  Nothing could have separated them at that moment.  “I left him with Dundare after…” she took a deep, painful breath.  “After the gruagan almost killed him.”  She could feel Loreana’s heart beating with hers.  “It’s been two years and I never wrote him, never went to see him.  He said he’d stay by my side the whole way,” she let go now and stared downward, “and I abandoned him.”<br>
Lora stroked her hair gently.  “Then I think you should return to him,” she whispered.  <br>
Greeneyes nodded.  “I think Denan can help us as well.”  She saw he question on Lora’s face.  “Denan and Megda Ironland.  The two who took me in.  They’ve already helped me more than I could ever repay.”<br>
“Ironland.”  Lora grinned.  “That’s where you took your last name.”<br>
“It was the only thing I could think of.”<br>
“And Greeneyes?” the girl prompted.<br>
“Pippen.  When I couldn’t remember my own.”<br>
“L’ree.”<br>
“Sapphire L’ree.  A Wichta title and name.  The demon I couldn’t, and won’t, accept.”<br>
Lora smiled and brought her twin’s head to rest against her.  “Then Greeneyes Ironland it is.”<br>
Greeneyes shook her head.  “No.  Shahnra.  For my father.  For our father.”  Now she smiled.  “And for the little sister I have walked through fire to save.”  Her smile faded…If she could save her.<br>
<br>
They sat for a long while, until the sun rose again, holding hands and sharing memories until sleep overtook them.  They didn’t wake until midday.<br>
“We should be going.  There’s nothing for me here now,” Lora said quietly.<br>
“There’s one thing to do first.”  Greeneyes looked toward the house.  “You don’t have to…”<br>
“I want to.  I need to say goodbye.”<br>
<br>
The two women were silent as they accomplished the gruesome task.  They buried Mara by the small shrine to Gaervalen.  On the grave, Greeneyes placed the small plant that Mara had healed when they first met.  With Gaervalen’s magic, she lovingly coaxed its roots into the soil.  Holding Lora’s hand, she said a prayer of farewell to their friend.<br>
“Greeneyes!” Lora gasped.  “Look!”<br>
The small shrub, which had grown a bit since Mara’s healing touch, was now growing and blooming right before their astonished eyes.  They backed away, such was its rapid growth, and watched in amazement.<br>
“It’s beautiful,” Lora whispered.<br>
They watched as it extended branches across grave and shrine.  The plant did not grow tall, but wide like a bush.  Only three vine-like branches grew upwards, reaching for the sky.<br>
“Gaervalen,” Greeneyes whispered in awe.<br>
The three branches twisted around each other as they grew, forming an arrow-straight rod.  A foot above their heads the branches separated then began weaving in and out in a pattern of hooks and bends that finally joined, completing the sphere.<br>
The bush ceased its growth then as both women heard a voice like a whisper on the wind.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>’This path lies in my shadow Oerskolna.  Heed well your steps.’</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Not daring to breath, Greeneyes glanced at Lora then at the staff and reached for it.  The staff came off easily, as if the plant released its hold on the branches when her hand touched it.  As she brought it down to her side, the head flashed.  Her necklace, the one presented to her by Mara, flashed in response.  Greeneyes felt the necklace come alive.  A tickle ran up her neck and played on her left cheek before it was still again.  <br>
Lora reached up and turned Greeneyes’ head towards her.  “He’s marked you.”<br>
“What?”<br>
“Your cheek.  A pattern.  Like the head of the staff.  Mara didn’t have that.”<br>
They looked toward the grave and the shrine, both shrouded in branches and leaves.  Greeneyes ran her fingers across the faint lines of the symbol.  The same silent question passed between them.<br>

No one questioned that Merrie’s death had been at Jerem’s hands.  They knew his quick temper, as well as his abusive nature, Greeneyes suspected.  The blame for Mara’s death was also laid upon his head.  Revenge for Greeneye’s intervention on Loreana’s behalf, the two women said.  Jerem had disappeared after the attacks.  Because his whereabouts were unknown, and because of the trauma attached to their home, Loreana’s ‘older sister’ decided it was best they move away.  They sold the home for a paltry sum to the town and Greeneyes instructed Lora she was not to spend it.  It would be her savings for such a time in the future when she needed it.  Neither woman dared say ‘If’.<br>
<br>
They conducted the necessary business as quickly and discreetly as they could.  Greeneyes was not sure how many of the caeban had survived and where those survivors might be.  Lora wanted to say goodbye to Cess, but she agreed with her older self that even that would be dangerous.  Lora would have agreed to just about anything at the moment.  The girl was deeply depressed and would go hours without saying or doing anything.  Standing by her mother’s grave one eve, Lora finally released a small part of her bitterness in a silent, tearful goodbye.  That night, Greeneyes held Lora tightly until the girl drifted into her uneasy, nightmare-filled sleep.<br>
<br>
Greeneyes retrieved her dagger, the figurine and her money from the wreckage of Mara’s home.  The dagger was only slightly scorched on the hilt and sheath.  The figurine was blackened, but only over the woman’s body, leaving the child’s untouched.  Her money was safe, though the pouch had burned.  Both women purchased enough clothing and supplies to travel before setting off for Miera Kiy.<br>
The days of mid-fall had started to cool and the nights grow cold.  They left early in the morning, bundled up to ward off the evening’s chill, and said their last goodbye to that chapter in their lives.<br>
<br>
They walked to Tasserty.  Greeneyes said nothing as they passed the site where the ill-fated wagon train had stopped.  Lora saw her partner go silent and felt her sadness and anger at herself.  She made Greeneyes talk about Pippen and, after much persuasion, convinced her to sing one of the songs she and the bard loved.  Greeneyes cheered up somewhat and by the time they reached Tasserty they were both tired but in good spirits.<br>
Catching rides with merchants and travelers was an easy task.  Few could say no to the lovely pair of sisters and their travels were uneventful.  They reached Miera Kiy in good time, arriving a few days later.<br>
<br>
Greeneyes and Loreana waved goodbye to the gray-bearded, old merchant at the Miera Kiy sign-rock.  They had traveled with him from Kimbleton and thoroughly enjoyed his company.  He had a good story or amusing joke for almost everything they could imagine.  When they weren’t rolling in laughter they sat in rapt attention as he told stories of the old kingdoms or his younger travelling days and they were sorry to finally bid him farewell.  Offers of payments received only a shake of his head and his own thanks for their company.<br>
Lora looked to her companion after the merchant disappeared down the hill to Miera Kiy.<br>
“Dundare’s first,” Greeneyes replied to the unspoken question.<br>
<br>
The fallen tree where she and Pippen had been attacked had long been pushed into the riverbed.  Again the silent contemplation by Greeneyes had to be broken by Lora’s questions, this time about Dundare.<br>
The sun was touching the trees as they came in sight of the small home.  Smoke drifted lazily from the chimney and Dundare’s home radiated the same warmth she remembered from the past.<br>
“What’s wrong?” Lora asked when Greeneyes stopped, still a hundred paces from the door.<br>
“Nothing.  I was afraid he wouldn’t be there.”  She shrugged.  “I don’t know.”  Greeneyes continued walking to his doorway, Lora close behind.<br>
<br>
“How do you explain this sudden growth in power?”  Cruzaz Ror stared into the brazier of fire at the image of his servant.  This turn of events was not expected.<br>
“I…helped it along, though I did not expect the result to manifest so quickly.”  Guptras had been surprised by the sudden eradication of the Nine Pale Hands caeban.  The blood mixed with the wine had a greater effect than planned.  “Perhaps the Black One is more impatient than we surmised.”<br>
“Perhaps.”  Ror waved his hand dismissively.  “It matters not.  The excavation goes well.  I feel the Circlet’s power grow every day.”  He paused thoughtfully for a moment.  “Do any of the Hands live?”<br>
“A dozen or so Master.  They have yet to regroup.  Their mistress is the Sapphire, T’ara, now.  She is weak minded, almost…innocent.  She will be easy to manipulate.”<br>
“Excellent.  Gather them up in whatever way you see fit and bring them to me at the Duke’s Palace.”<br>
Guptras smiled.  He knew their fate.  “Alive I assume you mean?”<br>
“Of course alive.  They are already prepared and only need to be delivered.”  Guptras thought he saw a faint grin alight briefly on his master’s face.  It was gone quickly.  “And the Chosen One?  Does she continue to walk the path?”<br>
“She does.  Though the end is in shadow, the path is well marked.  The spawn of Brian Shahnra will find herself on your doorstep before she realizes it.”<br>
“Good, good.  Perhaps it is better than Dierguroth speeds the prophecy along.  Duke Desmane, by his own estimation, foretells his war against the children of T’ro’adon grinding to a standstill in the not distant future.  He is in need of the Circlet’s powers almost as much as I.”  Though he wouldn’t admit it, Ror new that the plans Desmane had for the Circlet would speed his own plans along a hundred-fold.  To weaken a god’s children was to weaken the god.  With the Circlet of Mists’ power tipping the balance in Desmane’s war against the Dwarves, the Avatar’s way would be clear.<br>
<br>
Dundare opened the door on the first knock.  The old healer’s eyes widened.<br>
“Child!  By the gods I feared… But no, you’re here now.  Come in, come in… T’ro’adon’s stony face.”  His eyes got even wider when he saw Loreana peek around the door.  “You must be Loreana.  Of course you are.”  Dundare smiled broadly and returned Greeneye’s sudden embrace.  <br>
Lora returned his smile timidly and nodded.  “And you must be Dundare.”<br>
Dundare chuckled and scratched his head.  “I believe I am.”  He looked from one woman to the other.  “She’s the spitting image of you Child,” he sighed to Greeneyes.<br>
“Dear man you are more right than you imagine.”  Greeneyes grinned.  “Dundare, meet Loreana Shahnra.  Lora, meet the blessed man who saved my life.”<br>
Dundare raised his hand to the girl and was met with a tight hug and a whispered, “Thank you.”<br>
He smiled broadly.  “You’re welcome Loreana dear.  Gods Child, she so resembles you, even more than Pippen could describe.  Ah, but that was a while ago, wasn’t it?”<br>
She knew he meant no harm, but the remark stung her.  Greeneyes looked down briefly and nodded.  “Dundare, you had better brew a pot of tea and sit down.”<br>
He gave her a questioning look and nodded before motioning them inside.  “Make yourself at home Lora.  I’ll be back in a moment.  Dundare smiled at them and left to brew the tea.<br>
“Lora, wait here.  I have to talk to Dundare.”<br>
Lora nodded.  She knew the guilt Greeneyes carried concerning Pippen.<br>
<br>
Greeneyes walked in just as he sat the pot on the stove.  Dundare opened his arms to her and received another hug.  This time she didn’t let go.<br>
“Child.  It’s amazing the resemblance between the two of you… ah, but that’s not why you followed me in here, is it?”  She shook her head.  “Pippen?”  A nod.<br>
“After I left him here with you, I never… time went by so quickly.  I’m…” She shook her head.<br>
“Rest your mind Child.  He fares well and still visits me occasionally.  Writes me even more.”<br>
She looked crushed and even more embarrassed.<br>
“What I’m trying to say,” he raised her chin with his hand, “is that he still loves you dearly.  And while he is lonely, he has never, ever, given up hope for your return.”  Greeneyes smiled tentatively.<br>
“Here.”  Dundare reached up and retrieved a folded note from the shelf.  “When Pippen read your letter, he sat and wrote this.  Made me promise to give it to you when you returned.”  He smiled and nodded when she took it.  Her hands shook slightly.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>My Beloved Greeneyes.  Though I cannot be with you at your side, my heart and my soul walk with you every step you take.  <br>
When you hear a bird singing, he is delivering to you the song from my heart.  When you see the sun rise in the morning and set at night, I am holding you.  Laugh and a smile comes to my face.<br>
And when you finally walk through my door know that my arms will be waiting on the other side to hold you, my smile to laugh with you and my heart to sing my love to you.<br>
With all my love, and any I can borrow as well,<br>
<br>
Your Rogue in Waiting,<br>
Pippen</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Greeneyes closed her eyes and held herself tightly, smiling as a tear ran down her face.  Dundare saw her happiness and wiped a tear from his own eye.<br>
“He loves you still.  More each time I see him.”<br>
“I promised him I would marry him when this was done.”<br>
“And is it yet?” he asked hesitantly.<br>
“No.”<br>
Dundare nodded.  “Don’t make him wait any longer Child.  Pippen’s love does not diminish, but unrequited love <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>will</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> eventually die, alone and bitter.  If all is well when you next see him, and your love for him is strong, make him your husband.”<br>
Greeneyes nodded through tears of happiness.  “I will.  I will.”<br>
“Now then… the tea is ready and I imagine young Lora is getting lonely herself.  Let’s hear your story.”<br>
<br>
Greeneyes and Loreana held hands, sharing thoughts and emotions as they told their story.  Dundare sat quietly, never uttering a single word throughout.  When the telling was painful, he would nod and give their hands a reassuring squeeze.  When they revealed their true relationship, his eyes only grew wider.<br>
The sun broke through the window just as they finished their tale.  Dundare sat for a moment, then rose unsteadily and put on another pot of tea.  He returned and sat back down.<br>
“Dundare?”  Greeneyes wondered if he was still with them.<br>
“Dear child.”  He looked at Loreana.  “I have little wisdom to give, this is beyond my ken.”  Dundare thought for a moment and shook his head.  “I can say only this,” he leaned forward with his arms on his knees and hands clasped, “the gods have their hands in this as I’m sure you suspect.”  He looked from one woman to the other.  “And only Gaervalen has chosen to show his.”  <br>
He leaned back and rested his chin in his hand.  “I suspect old Stone Face is in on this as well.”<br>
<br>
Loreana’s eyes were unfocused, the look on her face worried Dundare.  “Gods, demons, witches.”  She looked at them both.  “Why is it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>my</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> life they want to play with?”  Lora wasn’t smiling.  She was shaking badly, her hands twisting the edge of her shirt with an intensity that was frightening.  <br>
Greeneyes wrapped her arms around the girl and drew her close.  “You need sleep Lora,” she whispered as she guided the distraught girl to the bed.  Throwing a blanket over Loreana, she held the girl’s hand up to her cheek.<br>
“Don’t leave me,” the child said forlornly.<br>
“I won’t Loreana.  I will never leave you.”  The girl nodded once and, pulling the blanket tight under her chin, closed her eyes<br>
<br>
When Lora finally drifted into a deep sleep, Greeneyes returned to Dundare and knelt on the floor with her head on his arm.  “There’s still so much I don’t remember Dundare.”  He gently stroked her hair.  “I hardly know where to go next.”<br>
“Few of us do Child.”  Dundare moved aside a lock of hair that had fallen in front of her eyes.  “As the oak said in your dream, the choices are yours, but you do not walk alone.  Go to Pippen.  Marry him and let him share some of his indomitable spirit with you.”  Greeneyes nodded slowly.  He could tell she was slipping off into sleep.<br>
He rose, gently holding her head until he could lift her in his arms and place her in his hammock.  Shuttering the windows, he sat with a grunt in his old chair.  “Ah well, this is not so bad,” he whispered as he closed his eyes and quickly fell to sleep. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub141.ezboard.com/bthemithrilheartbrigade7573.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dorraxx>Dorraxx</A> at: 1/14/03 6:21:53 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub141.ezboard.com/bthemithrilheartbrigade7573.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dorraxx>Dorraxx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br>  Posts: 2055<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/14/03 6:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 46</span><hr size=1> The wail woke them both.  Dundare lurched from his chair, bones groaning in protest.  Greeneyes rose with a start, almost flipping out of the hammock.<br>
Loreana was tossing and crying out in the grip of another nightmare, the first in many days.  Dundare wet a cloth while Greeneyes knelt by the girl’s side.  She took Lora’s hand in hers and gently stroked her cheek with the other, whispering shushing noises.  The girl’s cries dwindled to soft whimpers and when the cloth was put to her head she slowly opened red-rimmed eyes.  Lora didn’t say anything, but the look on her face tore at Greeneye’s heart.<br>
“I’m still here.  I won’t leave you.”<br>
Lora nodded and squeezed her hand as she shut her eyes.<br>
Greeneyes was dozing lightly when she felt Lora stir.  “It was too much to hope the nightmares were over,” she said when Greeneyes looked at her.<br>
“It’s not over yet.”<br>
“I know.”<br>
Dundare brought them both a late breakfast then opened the shutters to let the cool morning breeze in.  “Will you be leaving today?”<br>
Greeneyes looked to her companion who nodded.<br>
“Will you come with us?”  Lora asked.  She was very fond of Dundare.  The man was gentle and caring, so much like her memories of her father.<br>
“No Child.  My traveling days are past, even to Miera Kiy.  I have friends who keep me well stocked and T’ro’adon provides as well.”<br>
“You said you thought T’ro’adon had a hand in this,” Greeneyes said after a moment.  Dundare nodded.  “Father said something about Barradurn of T’ro’adon.  What does that mean?”<br>
“I’ve been mulling over that, Child.”  He walked over to a window and breathed the fresh air deeply.  “Most likely this Barradurn is a priest or perhaps a Guardian.  Barradurn is a dwarven name, though I’ve forgotten what it means.”<br>
Greeneyes nodded.  “What is a Guardian?”<br>
“A warrior, usually a holy warrior, though sometimes just a fighter serving the temple.”<br>
“Were you a priest, Dundare?”<br>
He smiled mysteriously.  “No.  A Paladin.  But that was a long time ago.  Perhaps I’ll tell you my story another time.”  The two women nodded, eager but willing to wait.<br>
<br>
A band after midday they were off.  Dundare hugged them both then stood there for a moment, looking at them.  “I have to blink when I look at you both.”  He smiled broadly.  “Lora, you will indeed grow up to be a beautiful woman.  You take care of each other.  Pippen will be very happy to see both of you.  He is a fine young man and will make a good husband, Greeneyes.”  Dundare chuckled, “I think the young bard will for once be at a loss of words when he sees the two of you.”<br>
“Goodbye Dundare,” Lora said as she hugged him again.  “We’ll see you again soon.”<br>
He nodded, “When you can.  I expect your lives will be very busy soon.  I will be here, as always.”  Dundare placed a hand on Lora’s cheek and looked into her eyes.  “As I told young Greeneyes there.  Come to me if you are ever in need.”  She nodded and smiled.<br>
<br>
They waved and started down the trail.  Dundare watched them go and said a silent prayer for their safety before going back for some tea, his chair, and some deep thought.<br>
The sounds of Greeneyes’ staff and their footsteps mixed with the twittering of birds and the rustling of leaves as they made their way down the trail to the road.  Greeneyes wore the robe of Gaervalen over the simple traveling clothes she often used.  Lora favored a shin length, flowery dress, tall traveling boots and Greeneyes old cloak.  Both covered their heads to keep the cool breeze off their ears and to hide the striped chestnut hair they shared.  Aside from their height and Greeneyes more womanly features, the only difference between the two women was the mark of Gaervalen on the older Shahnra’s cheek.<br>
The mark made Greeneyes somewhat nervous.  She didn’t know the significance of the mark, but she promised herself she would never hide it.  She had failed the Green God more than once and vowed not to shame the strange favor shown her.<br>
<br>
They made it to the gates without incident and headed through the crowded streets toward the Bald Griffin.<br>
“I’m so nervous,” Loreana said as they came in sight of the Inn.<br>
“You’re nervous?”  Greeneyes smiled at the girl.  “I’ve been shaking since we entered the city.”<br>
At the door, Greeneyes hesitated slightly then opened it and stepped in.  She threw back her hood even as Lora drew hers further over her face.  As their eyes adjusted to the dim lighting they heard Denan’s voice.<br>
“By all the heavens, Megda, come here!” he shouted toward the kitchen.  “Aye girl you are a sight for sore eyes.  ‘Bout stopped my heart when I saw you standin’ there.  Megda!  You have a visitor!  C’mon woman!”<br>
“Oh shush you old graybeard, I’m comin’” Megda pushed open the doors and tossed a rag back before seeing her.  “Greeneyes, dear gods you’re safe.  When we didn’t hear from you, we feared… ah, no matter now.”  She hugged Greeneyes across the bar while Denan poured drinks.<br>
“Where’s Pippen, Megda?” she asked in a subdued tone.<br>
“He’s out pickin’ up strings for his lute, dear.”  She gave the woman a serious look.  “He misses you dearly.”<br>
Greeneyes bowed her head.  “I know.  I should have never left him.  At least I should have told him I was well.”  She looked at Lora, who stood unobtrusively nearby.  “As well as I could be.”<br>
Denan placed their drinks before them as the two women sat down.  Kiran wine for his mate, Greeneyes and her companion.  “Ah lass, you haven’t introduced your friend there.<br>
Lora timidly pushed her hood back, evoking a small gasp from Megda.  The girl smiled.<br>
“Megda, Denan, meet Loreana Shahnra.  Lora, my good friends and family, Megda and Denan Ironland.”<br>
Megda extended her hands.  “Loreana.  Dear child, after all this time.”<br>
“I think I’m seein’ double,” Denan chuckled as he wiped his hands and extended one to the girl.  “Well met Loreana.”<br>
Lora was grinning now.  “I’m so happy to meet both of you.  Greeneyes has told me so much.”<br>
“Pippen’s gonna be…surprised.”  Denan shook his head, still smiling.<br>
Loreana pulled the hood back over her head with a grin.  “If he’s coming back soon, I don’t want to confuse him too much.”<br>
“Speak o’ the bard now, here he comes.”  Megda saw him swing open the door and pause to let his eyes adjust.  <br>
<br>
Lora turned toward Megda, still grinning widely.  Greeneyes rose and turned toward the bard bashfully.  She wasn’t sure how he would respond to seeing her and wanted her long neglected love to make the first move.<br>
Move he did.  “Greeneyes?”  When she nodded he almost ran to the bar, stopping a single pace away which was long enough for her to smile and open her arms.  Pippen gathered her up and spun her around once.  “Beloved.”  They looked into each others eyes then brought their lips together in a kiss passionate enough to make Denan turn away to clean his mug and Megda to look down and fumble with her apron.  Lora felt embarrassed as well.  The blood rushed to her cheeks and her breath quickened ever so slightly.  She had to turn away to keep the others from noticing.<br>
<br>
“I’m so sorry, my love,” Greeneyes whispered when their lips parted.  “So sorry.”<br>
He still held her, telling her it was all right, that there was nothing to forgive and that they were together at last.<br>
Denan cleared his throat and caught a fiery stare from his mate that he could only shrug his shoulders to.  When the couple parted, the two dwarves were smiling a little too broadly, causing Greeneyes to flush and laugh.  Pippen looked down at his shoes briefly, grinning.  Denan moved his eyes in Lora’s direction and Greeneyes took the hint.<br>
“Now Love, I have somebody I want you to meet.  Actually you’ve met her once already.  Loreana.”<br>
Lora turned back toward them, still slightly flustered.  She smiled shyly at Pippen and dropped her hood.  Pippen’s surprise at their resemblance barely registered.  He had seen it before in the nine-year-old’s eyes and was already sure of her relationship with Greeneyes.<br>
“Loreana,” he said as he kissed her hand in the most gentlemanly fashion.  “I am honored to meet you M’Lady.”<br>
She blushed and smiled as she curtsied.  “And I am honored to finally meet you Master Pippen.  Greeneyes and Dundare have told me so much about you.”  She felt her heart quicken again and smiled.  No wonder her older-self was so enamoured of him.<br>
“You two look so much alike,” he looked towards Greeneyes.  “Like sisters, or-“ he paused looking back and forth.  “Uhm, how are you…I mean, are you?”<br>
Greeneyes saved him further embarrassment.  “That is a long and painful story my love.  We will tell you tomorrow morning if you can stand to wait.”  She looked to Denan and Megda who both nodded.<br>
“Come dear.”  Megda took Lora by the hand.  “Let’s let the lovebirds talk and I can draw you a hot bath to soak in.”<br>
“Thank you Megda.”  Lora glanced at Greeneyes who smiled and caressed her cheek.  She turned and followed the dwarf up the steps.<br>
<br>
Pippen watched Denan wander off to give them privacy then said, “She is so much like you.  I knew it, I knew-“<br>
“Oh Pippen, there is so much to tell you.”  She kissed him then took both his hands in hers.  “And the first thing I have to tell you is: Yes.”<br>
He cocked his head in confusion.  “Yes?”<br>
“Yes.  I will be your wife if you will still have me.”<br>
“Yes?  Yes.  Yes!”  He shouted and grabbed her, kissing her again as he twirled around with her in his arms.<br>
“This is still not over though,” she said seriously after he finally released her.  “Not by a long stretch I fear.”<br>
Pippen nodded.  “My promise still stands.”  He looked into her eyes, the beautiful green eyes that had captured his soul.  “And this time I’m not going to let you out of my sight.”<br>
Greeneyes smiled and blushed.  “I want you with me, every step of the way.  I need you.  I can’t go on without you any longer or I’ll go crazy.”  She shook his hands for emphasis.  “But one other thing my love.”  A look of concern crossed his face.  “Lora is part of this.”  She looked intently at the Bard.  “Every step.  It can be no other way.  If you accept me, you accept her.”<br>
Pippen nodded, still confused.  “Of course my love, but-“ he paused to find the words, “When we are wed, what do I call her?”  He paused again.  “Sister, daughter, niece?”  He looked at her helplessly.<br>
“We call each other sister, but Pippen… it is so much deeper than that.  I still can’t understand it myself and you have to hear the whole story.  Bits and pieces only make it more confusing.”  She took his hands and kissed them.  “Please be patient.  We’ll tell you all we know tomorrow.”<br>
<br>
Pippen nodded again then ran his hand through the stripe in her hair and across the mark on her cheek.  “And these?  The mark is beautiful.”<br>
“That I can tell you, at least partly.”  She drew the long tail of her hair across her shoulder and combed her fingers through it.  “The stripe I’ve always had.  Dundare suggested I dye it.  He felt it might mark me to those who knew me before.  Lora’s is part of our story.”  She ran her fingertips lightly across her cheek.  “The mark is Gaervalen’s.”<br>
“The forest god,” he replied.<br>
“Yes.”  She nodded.  “I serve him now, as an Oerskolna, a druid.”  She grinned at the look on his face.  “That is part of the story as well.”<br>
Pippen chuckled.  “I have a feeling I’m going to spend the rest of my life writing this ballad.”<br>
Greeneyes looked at him sadly.  “I fear you may be more right than you know.”<br>
He looked into her eyes then embraced her tightly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub141.ezboard.com/bthemithrilheartbrigade7573.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dorraxx>Dorraxx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br>  Posts: 2056<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/14/03 6:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 47</span><hr size=1> Greeneyes smiled when Pippen asked if she would join him that night to sing.  Singing with Pippen uplifted her spirit.  When she sat at their little makeshift stage with him, voices echoing through the inn, a little of the darkness was pushed back.<br>
Many of the regulars had been there when she last sang.  They remembered her and gave a rousing applause when she joined Pippen.  Lora sat off to the side and smiled happily as she chatted with Megda.  Denan was grinning too.  Not only was he happy the two were back together, but he couldn’t help but be happy to see his tavern back to the way it was before.  <br>
Pippen and Greeneyes helped push the last of the patrons out into the night, then they themselves went out to walk together for the first time in over two years.  Pippen updated Greeneyes on all that she had missed in her time away.  Talk eventually led to the wedding and their plans.<br>
They would send a message to Dundare and, if he would, have the ceremony in the clearing near his home.  Greeneyes thought it only fitting for him to oversee their joining.  Pippen agreed and they moved on to smaller details.  They were just coming in sight of the Griffin when the subject finally fell on children.<br>
<br>
Greeneyes looked at him with a tear in her eye.  “Oh Pippen dearest.”  She looked down, trying to find the words that would wound him the least.  She couldn’t.  “When Lora came of age, she asked me of the things a woman must go through when her body matures.”  She looked into his eyes and shook her head.  “That’s when I realized… I don’t think I can bear children Pippen.”  She saw his face fall.  “I’m not sure, but my body does not go through the cycle a woman’s should.”  Greeneyes looked down.  “Maybe – maybe Gaervalen, or another, can provide an answer or a solution.”  She cupped his chin in her hand and lifted it.  “Pippen…say something.”<br>
“I cannot lie my love.  I so hoped that we would be able to have children.”  He finally smiled and kissed her gently.  “But my love for you does not diminish my green-eyed maiden.  Nothing will ever change that.”  This time he caught her eyes.  “Nothing.”<br>
<br>
Greeneyes knew with all her being that she had never loved another man.  And as she and Pippen held each other in his bed, as they slowly and passionately explored each other’s bodies and reveled in each new pleasure they discovered, she knew there would never be any other.  Every touch, every gentle caress of finger and tongue brought them closer in body and spirit.  <br>
<br>
Loreana was unusually quiet the next morning.  When Pippen gave her a hearty ‘Good morn’, she barely responded and wouldn’t look into his eyes.  She slipped by him and went to the table where Megda had breakfast waiting for them.<br>
Greeneyes sensed something was wrong but couldn’t figure out what that something was.  Lora would only mumble about having another nightmare while she picked through her meal of eggs and toasted bread.  Lora hardly looked up and, when she was only half finished, thanked Megda before excusing herself to her room.<br>
Greeneyes looked at the others in confusion, shrugged and followed the girl up.<br>
<br>
“Lora,” she called through the door.  “Lora, what’s wrong?”<br>
“Nothing,” she heard from beyond the door.<br>
“Lora, you know that’s not true.  You know I can feel it.  Please talk to me.”  Greeneyes was becoming frightened now.<br>
A long moment passed before she heard the bolt slide as Loreana opened the door.  The girl turned around quickly, never making eye contact, and went to the window.  Greeneyes shut the door and came up behind her.  They stood there in silence looking out over the morning crowd.<br>
“Lora.  You’re scaring me.  What’s wrong?” she said when she couldn’t take the silence any longer.<br>
“You…” the girl flushed in embarrassment.  “You made love to him last night, didn’t you?”<br>
“Lora?”<br>
“Didn’t you?”<br>
“Yes, but what…”<br>
“What am I feeling right now?” Lora asked, looking into her twin’s eyes for the first time.<br>
“What?  Confusion, a little fear.  Shame?  What…” Greeneyes didn’t know where this was going.  Was Lora jealous?<br>
“And I know what you’re feeling right now too.”  She looked out the window again.  “Just like I knew what you were feeling last night.”  Lora heard Greeneyes’ sharp intake of breath.  “I’ve never,” she paused, unsure of herself.  “I never paid any attention to the boys in Tannor’s Stand.  I didn’t really like any of them.  And I never…” She couldn’t find the words to express herself.  Greeneyes placed a hand on her shoulder and the girl immediately turned around and fell into her arms.<br>
“I felt like I was stealing something, or watching something I wasn’t supposed to.”  She looked up at Greeneyes.<br>
“Shh, it wasn’t your fault.  You didn’t do anything wrong.”  What do you say to this?  “It was my fault.  I didn’t know.  I couldn’t imagine something like this happening and I’m sorry.”  Greeneyes thought for a moment then gasped.  “Pippen!  Oh gods how…”<br>
Lora looked up swiftly, “Don’t you dare tell him, I can’t even look at him right now.”<br>
“No, no I won’t.  But-“ she looked down at Lora, “I can’t… gods I’d die of embarrassment.  It’s just so wrong, and so-“<br>
“Weird.”<br>
Greeneyes let a laugh slip out then stifled it with the back of her hand.  “What’s he going to think?”  They both wore grins that they couldn’t help.  “What am I going to do Lora?”<br>
Lora didn’t have the first clue.  “You’re older than me, you’re supposed to figure these things out.”  She paused for a second.  “Well…if this connection we have grows weaker with distance, then just…you know…<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>don’t</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> until you get married.  Come back to Miera Kiy and rent one of those nice places in the Merchant’s quarter.”  She shrugged.  “I’ll stay at Dundare’s for a few days until you send for me.”<br>
Greeneyes grinned and tussled Lora’s hair.  “See, you did know what to do.  I just hope it works.”  She looked up with exasperation.  “Gods, Pippen,” she laughed.<br>
<br>
When both women came down the stairs, grinning and whispering to each other to stop grinning, Pippen and Denan could only stare at each other in confusion.  Lora caught Pippen’s eyes and turned away in a fit of giggles.  Greeneyes made a poor attempt at regaining her composure and gave her confused lover a long kiss on the lips, evoking another fit of giggles from Lora.<br>
“What?” Pippen looked from Greeneyes to Denan in confusion.<br>
“‘Tis a woman thing, boy.  Don’t think about it, it’ll only drive ya crazy.”  Dwarven wisdom imparted, Denan downed his mug of ale.<br>
<br>
Pippen hugged Greeneyes tightly, then they both reached out to Lora and held her.  Denan and Megda held hands so tightly their knuckles whitened.  The women’s story was almost unbelievable, but they knew in their hearts it was true.  The long silence only broken by Megda’s whispered, “I knew you were special.”<br>
“Your sister asked that I accept you as I do her,” Pippen told Lora quietly, “and now I understand.  Now I make this promise to you, Loreana.  I would give my life for you as for my Greeneyes.  I could do nothing else but that.”<br>
Lora’s eyes were wet with tears when he kissed her forehead.  Greeneyes nodded in approval and hugged them again.<br>
<br>
“Denan, can you help me find my father’s murderer?”  Lora asked that evening while Greeneyes was in the kitchen helping Megda and Pippen was tuning up for the night’s entertainment.  Lora scratched her head absently.  Greeneyes insisted that they now dye her hair to hide the stripe and it itched.<br>
“Aye girl, I could.”  He put a glass under the bar and gave her a serious look.  “But ‘tis a dangerous thing you ask.  Not just for me, mind you.  If that were so I’d not hesitate.  But for you an’ Greeneyes.”<br>
Lora nodded solemnly.  “I know.  But aren’t we in danger already?  I ask this not just for me or Greeneyes, or even for justice, but because it is part of this mystery.”  She looked at him, eyes pleading for his help.  “Why was our father murdered?  Not for any shady dealings, I know with all my heart that that couldn’t be true.”  She leaned forward across the bar.  “Who was he?  I know if we discover this it will be a huge step in finding out who I am and why this is happening.”  Lora clasped the dwarf’s hands.  “Please Denan, I beg of you.  Help me.”<br>
Denan sighed and nodded reluctantly.  “I’ll do this, Child.  Gods know I can’t say no to those pretty green eyes.”<br>
She smiled and kissed him, causing him to blush deeply.<br>
<br>
It took more savvy and even more coin, just to find out that it was the Iron Key that had a hand in Brian Shahnra’s murder.<br>
The Iron Key was the thieves’ guild of Miera Kiy.  While they had a hand in most underground dealings in the city, assassination was not normally a task they partook in.  Talent for that job was usually hired from outside the city, often outside the country.  Denan’s sources ran deep, he prided himself on the information he could gather.  He noticed that those sources ran suspiciously dry when the Iron Key was involved.<br>
The guild had been around almost as long as Miera Kiy had been a city.  Deeply rooted in the city’s origins, the Iron Key’s network of influence touched on every aspect of trade and politics in the city.  The web of intrigue and duplicity was difficult to avoid, even for the simplest of peddlers and the lowest of law enforcement.  Only the Tradesway Guard were thought to be unsullied by the guild’s doings, though they certainly kept the guild under their watchful eye.  Like a spider web, lines of communication were spun in all directions.  Rare was the time when information that passed from one party to the next was also not passed to the ears of a dozen others.  That dozen, of course, passed their knowledge to a dozen more.<br>
And so Denan’s inquiries into Brian Shahnra’s assassination made it to the ears of Antair Tanbeer.  The assassin had narrowly avoided the Iron Key’s attempt to tie up what they saw as a ‘loose end’, and from that day forward the man lived his life deep in the shadows.  Few could have hoped to avoid the Iron Key’s grasp inside the city, but few possessed the skills of the master assassin.  Living beneath the sight of the guild though had worn him down.  Years of wracking his brain to discover what he had done wrong, why he had displeased his masters, had chiseled away at his sanity bit by bit.  When his contacts informed him of Denan’s investigation, something in his burned out brain finally snapped.<br>
Withdrawing the blade from the messenger’s throat, Antair slipped into the night.  Now his salvation, he assured himself with low muttering words, was close at hand. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub141.ezboard.com/bthemithrilheartbrigade7573.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dorraxx>Dorraxx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br>  Posts: 2057<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/14/03 6:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 48</span><hr size=1> After a week of hitting brick walls and closed mouths, just one day before the wedding, Denan decided there was nothing more he could do.  “All I can tell you child is that the order came from high up in the guild.  It’s nothin’ we could ever prove though.  Too many mouths shut tight and wouldn’t open no matter how much coin I tried to shove in them.”<br>
Loreana nodded.  She thanked Denan, though he could tell her disappointment went beyond words.  Lora kept the results of Denan’s search to herself, she didn’t want to put that dark cloud over Greeneyes’ and Pippen’s impending ceremony.<br>
<br>
Early the next morning Denan pulled up in his wagon to the front of the Inn and loaded everybody up.  Loreana and Pippen sat on the driver’s bench with Denan while Megda and Lora crawled up in the back amongst the food, drink and chairs that had been loaded up for the wedding party.  Lora giggled as she and Megda fought to find stable seating while the wagon bounced down the road.  Greeneyes laid her head on Pippen’s shoulder as he sang her a quiet love ballad.  They caught Denan wiping a tear from his eye, which he immediately blamed on the road dust, causing the pair to laugh while Greeneyes tussled the dwarf’s hair.<br>
<br>
Dundare was overjoyed when Greeneyes and Pippen asked him if they could be wed at his home and if he would oversee their joining.  The response he sent said he would have everything prepared for their arrival.  Dundare greeted the wedding party with hugs and hearty handshakes.  With him was Kirken, the Tradesway Guard Greeneyes had met when she first traveled to Miera Kiy, and two other Guards, all dressed in their finest uniforms.  They supplied a tent, table and other items for the ceremony.  Denan, Pippen, and the men unloaded a keg of ale, food and wine from the wagon.  Megda, Dundare, Greeneyes and Lora all piled into the healer’s tiny kitchen to prepare the food.  They shooed Greeneyes out soon after, as the bride had no business helping prepare for her own ceremony.  She joined the others to chat happily about her Pippen and anything that didn’t concern her recent ordeal.  Dundare appeared shortly after, claiming a need for some of the fine drink Denan brought, but they saw Megda practically throw him out as she claimed his kitchen as her own.<br>
<br>
Later that after-midday, Lora grabbed Greeneyes and took her out to gather flowers for the bride to wear with her wedding dress.  Greeneyes would be wearing the robe Mara had given her, as well as a flowing, jade dress Megda had bought as a present.<br>
“What about these?” Lora asked as she pointed to a bundle of bright, yellow-petal flowers that were growing up a nearby spruce.<br>
“Too big.  But there’s some Ladylace in that group of trees over there, I think.”  She pointed up the small hillock next to where they stood.  “There won’t be any flowers on it, but the leaves are tiny and dense.  I think I’d like it on my robe.”  Lora nodded and ran across into the trees.  <br>
Greeneyes had found some late blooming White Cups and was using Gaervalen’s magic to gently coax them from their parent plants when she felt it.  Just the barest twinge of danger, but the only source could be-<br>
“Loreana!” she cried out, flowers forgotten where they lay.  “Loreana!”  She listened…nothing.  The feeling was gone and Lora had not answered.<br>
Greeneyes tore off down the slope and up the hill where Lora had disappeared.  She broke through the trees to the place where the Ladylace grew.  Loreana was nowhere to be seen and there was no sign of where she had disappeared.<br>
“Loreana!”  No answer and no feeling from her other self.<br>
“Dundare!  Pippen!”  They saw Greeneyes run into view and jumped from their chairs.  “She’s gone!”<br>
Denan intercepted her as she ran under the tent.  “Girl, who’s gone?  Loreana?” he asked as the others crowded around.<br>
She nodded, her breaths quick and shallow.  “She had just gone up the hill to pick flowers, then I felt something…danger.  Then she was gone!”  She looked at Pippen, “I couldn’t find her Pippen!  She’s gone!”<br>
Kirken was already signaling his two men to spread out and search.  Denan reached under the driver’s bench and pulled out a short sword.  Pippen was watching Dundare spread his arms and close his eyes.  Greeneyes looked on as he opened them again and shook his head.<br>
“I’m sorry Child, I can sense nothing.”  He looked crestfallen.<br>
Greeneyes stood there for a moment at a complete loss, then she looked at Pippen with dawning hope.  “Wait!  I know!  Gaervalen thank you.”  Greeneyes grasped her staff with both hands as Pippen backed away.  She chanted a short phrase and held out one hand, palm down, before her.  Her eyes stared out, unfocused, as she turned a slow circle looking for something the others couldn’t see.<br>
<br>
“That way!” she said excitedly.  “They told me the path she took.”  Worry crossed her face.  “She’s not alone.”<br>
Denan looked at her.  “They?”<br>
Greeneyes glanced at the dwarf.  “The trees, they told me of her passage.”  She looked at Dundare.  “And another’s.  They’re moving fast, we have to hurry.”<br>
“They’re moving towards the city.”  Pippen said when he saw the direction she pointed.<br>
Denan, Pippen and Dundare grabbed some water flasks and followed Greeneyes as she hurried out of the clearing.  Occasionally the druid would stop and use her magic, again indicating the direction to follow.  <br>
Well after midday, tired from the rapid pace Greeneyes kept, they came to a drainage ditch not a mile from the city walls.  At the head of the ditch a large pipe protruded, it’s opening sealed with a rusty grating.<br>
It took only moments for Denan to work the grate loose.  “It’s been disturbed recently,” the dwarf announced even as Greeneyes ducked low to enter the wet, dark hole.<br>
“Melah.”  The head of her staff lit the tunnel in a dim, yellow light.<br>
Sloshing through ankle-deep waters that Pippen didn’t want to consider the make-up of, they cautiously paced deeper into the sewer, turning two corners before coming to a small chamber that held three exits opposite where they stood.  Greeneyes indicated the far right tunnel and they continued on, this time able to stand fully upright.  They traveled several hundred paces, passing smaller tunnels in favor of the main passage.  Another room with branching tunnels brought Greeneyes to a stop.<br>
Even as she was chanting, Pippen whispered, “I hear something, this way.”  He pointed just as Greeneyes indicated the same direction.  They rushed off, leaving her to take up the rear.<br>
Pippen was rushing down the damp tunnel, Dundare close behind and Denan struggling to keep up.  Greeneyes had almost reached them when she felt Loreana.  Distant, but definitely the girl.  Whoever was with her had hurt her and she was afraid and angry.<br>
Again the spell pointed toward the girl.  The tunnels were lined with moss, algae, and other growth that felt the girl and her captor pass.  But when Greeneyes looked in the direction her spell pointed, there was only a wall and no other tunnel opening in sight.<br>
There, a hairline crack the moss grew around.  She traced it in a square with her fingers then stood back and raised her staff.  Like the seedling she coaxed to grow in Mara’s yard, she coaxed the moss.  This time she opened the conduit wide, feeding the small growth all the life she could.<br>
<br>
The pale moss grew wildly, bulging and pouring down the wall and around her feet.  Greeneyes coaxed it to grow inward, into the hairline seam.  With a sharp crack the moss buckled the stone, causing it to split at one corner, then another.  With the stone now loose, the growth forced the block out of its hole, revealing a small, dry passage into darkness.<br>
“Greeneyes girl, where’d you go?”  Denan noticed the woman no longer trailed him and stopped.  She did not hear him from within the passage she crouched in, moving towards Lora and her captor.<br>
<br>
She felt a sharp sting on her neck and brought her hand up, thinking a bee had stung her.  He grabbed her hand and twisted it, turning her around and immobilizing her with the pain.<br>
“Shh, sweet girl.  Not a word now.”  He waved a long, thin dagger before her eyes.  Lora tried to scream anyway.<br>
“Now, that’s what this is for,” he hissed, glancing at the blade.  “Another prick and your breath will no longer rush in and out of your pretty little lungs.”<br>
She tried to twist away but he applied more pressure, causing her to wince and stop struggling.<br>
“That’s better. Now, move!” he whispered fiercely, pushing her over the hillock.<br>
Then she remembered.  Remembered the cold stare, the eyes behind the mask.  Lora turned to look at him, anger mixing with fearful recognition.<br>
“You know me now, yes?” he said viciously and gave her another shove.  “Don’t kill her, he said.  Even if she sees you don’t hurt the pretty little girl,” the assassin whispered, mimicking some unknown party.<br>
He was mad.  She could see that now.  The man who murdered her father was crazy and now had her…where was Greeneyes?<br>
Antair Tanbeer stopped her after moving a mile away.  Pulling a thin cord from a belt pouch, he tied her hands behind her back with one end and one ankle with the other.  Tying a loop to hold onto, he motioned her forward with the poisoned blade.<br>
When they came on a small gully he pushed her down the slope and motioned right.  They followed it into the after-midday, never stopping to rest, until she stumbled, scraping and bruising her shoulder when she landed.  Antair let her rest for a moment before pushing her onward.<br>
Lora was allowed to sit only when they reached the drainage pipe and grating that emptied into the gully.  Keeping a watchful eye on her the whole time, he fumbled with the bolts that held the grate in place until it popped off.  Waving the dagger at her, he motioned toward the pipe and followed her in.<br>
<br>
Lora buried her nose in her shoulder as the stench of the sewer assaulted her.  She choked once when she saw the refuse she was walking in and tried not to look down again.<br>
‘Hurry along girl.  The master awaits.”  His voice rose to a crazed pitch.  “I’ll bring you to him and he’ll see I did it right.  I didn’t harm your pretty little throat.”  His voice lowered again.  “That must have been it…he wanted you.  That’s it, I should have brought you to him.  I’ll finally be redeemed.  They’ll see that I’m still the best.  Antair Tanbeer, master assassin!”  The last statement a crazed giggle.<br>
Her hopes rose only slightly at the thought that he wanted her unharmed…for now.<br>
Lora couldn’t tell where they were going, but at least she didn’t have to crouch any more.  His ranting was getting to her though.<br>
“He tried to kill me, he did,” the assassin continued to rant.  “That’s rude.  I did the job and he tried to have me killed.”  He laughed again.  “Me.  Tried to kill <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>me</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.”<br>
They turned down another tunnel then stopped a hundred paces down.  He pointed her away from him and she heard him scratching at the wall.  Lora heard a grating noise before he yanked on the cord to turn her around.  Still waving the dagger, he untied her hands then tied them in front of her.<br>
“Climb in sweetie, almost there.”<br>
She looked into the hole was climbing up into it when he pushed again.  Barely high enough for her to crawl in, she had to move her hands forward in short hops to get to the opposite end.  Thankfully it was only ten paces or so deep.  Unfortunately it was almost her height from the stone floor on the opposite side and he didn’t give her an option on how to descend.<br>
Again her shoulder screamed as it hit the hard stone on the other side.  Lora heard a small noise escape her throat when she hit.  Hoping the toxin was wearing off, she ensured she made no further noise.  He must not have heard her as he scrambled down without comment and pushed her down a dimly lit passage that curved slightly left.  Pausing briefly, he listened hard behind him.  Shaking his head and giggling he pushed her forward again.<br>
<br>
Greeneyes dropped to the floor, wincing as her staff clicked against the stone.  Not far, she could almost taste the fear and anger from her younger self.<br>
Denan pulled himself into the hole with Pippen and Dundare’s help then shuffled forward in a low side crouch.  He checked that the other two were behind him before dropping to the ground.<br>
She too recognized him when he turned to investigate the noise she made.  Grabbing Loreana in a headlock, dagger-tip almost touching her throat, he screeched, “No!  You can’t have her.  I’m taking her to the Master, not you!”  His eyes were the same eyes the little nine-year-old’s had seen that dark night.  This time though, they were glazed over in a crazed fervor.  He brought the dagger even closer when Greeneyes inched forward.  “No-no-no, if I cant’ take her no one can”<br>
They both heard a noise from behind Greeneyes.  She turned her head to see Denan approach and whipped swiftly back around to the assassin.  In an instant, she saw the crazed killer’s eyes widen.  She saw the muscles in his arm tense as he began drawing the blade against Loreana’s throat.<br>
There was no sleepy-eyed awakening this time.  Pippen realized what was happening as did Lora.  The bard remembered the hazy vision of his love drawing the sigil in the air and screamed, “Greeneyes NO!”<br>
Greeneyes didn’t hear him, wouldn’t have seen him.  Her whole world at that moment was the thin red line that appeared under the blade on the child’s neck.  A ghostly mist coalesced around her, then streaked forward.  The pale, misty face of the banshee rose before the assassin and screamed.  Lora found her voice even as the assassin lost his.  He did scream, only once, before his face froze in a mask of terror and he collapsed, heart exploding as he saw all his darkest fears before his eyes.<br>
Lora screamed and screamed.  At the specter, whose deadly fear was meant only for its target, and at the witch who stood before her, eyes burning green fire.  Then the girl felt her throat tighten again.  This time she had to fight for breath.  The knife had not cut deeply enough to sever her throat, but perhaps that would have been more merciful than waiting for the poison that was slowly suffocating her.  She dimly heard voices raised in alarm from behind her, even as she saw the witch pass and the two men and one dwarf rush to her side.  Lora’s vision darkened as she fought for air, and the last thing she heard was screams of terror.<br>
<br>
If the assassin had been the only one it might have stopped there.  But she heard the voices of men and the clatter of blades.  She saw the gleam of steel in the torchlight and the craft demanded more.  The nightmarish specter flew forward revealing the face of death to her enemies.  As each one dropped in his tracks another came forward.<br>
Sapphire L’ree continued forward, raising a second, the a third ghostly terror to strike down the thieves of the Iron Key.  When she entered the main hall of the guild and saw them behind pillars and on balconies, shouting and raising bows to strike her, she called the wind.<br>
The glowing trail her fingers wove in the air before her did not call the breeze used to carry her in rapid transport.  Now the storm she commanded was death itself.  Whipping around her, rapidly gaining in strength, it deflected the incoming shafts.  The wind whistled and roared through the chamber, smashing the chairs, tables and shelves into kindling.  Approaching rogues were lifted and tossed into the walls.  When they landed they were little more than rag dolls of desiccated skin, muscle and bone.<br>
<br>
Dundare reached the girl’s side as she lost consciousness.  Placing one hand to her throat and another around a medallion previously hidden beneath his jerkin, he watched as the thin line of blood dried, the wound close and, more importantly, the poison seep out and evaporate.  Lora’s chest heaved as air rushed into her starving lungs.  Her eyes shot open and she sucked in the precious air.<br>
Denan and Pippen, seeing Lora was alive, rushed forward.  The commanding voice of Dundare halted them in their tracks.<br>
“Stop!”  He rose after untying the cord that bound Lora and placing her gently against the wall.  “Stay with Loreana.  I must handle the witch.”<br>
Lora looked up in fear, “No!  Don’t hurt her!”<br>
He looked down at her, “Ah child, I fear I could do her little harm, but I do hope to bring her back to her senses.”  Dundare looked down the passage as screams echoed in his ears.  “When she can walk, take her back to the sewers.  If I…if we don’t return soon…” He couldn’t bring himself to speak his thoughts and rapidly marched down the long hall, his stride that of a man twenty summers younger.<br>
“Dundare,” Lora whispered, wishing she could bring him back and hoping he would succeed in returning Greeneyes to them.<br>
“Can you walk girl?  C’mon.”  Denan helped her up then looked at Pippen.  The young man was staring forlornly down the passage.  “C’mon young Pip, help…” he stopped as Pippen began walking after Dundare.  “Pippen!  There’s noth-“<br>
“No.  I promised her.”  The bard kept walking then began to trot.  “I promised I wouldn’t leave her.”<br>
Denan saw it would be useless to call him back and started to the hole with Lora on his arm.  “What?  Not you too girl!  Dundare…”<br>
“Without her I’m lost, Denan,” she said as she broke free and turned around.  “I can’t leave her…I have to face her.”<br>
“Face her?  Aye, you’ll be facing the witch!”<br>
“The witch I would have been if it weren’t for her Denan!”<br>
The dwarf nodded, resigned to the insanity that they all suffered from.  “Then at least let me go first,” he said as he trotted down the hallway, the fourteen-year-old human girl close behind him.<br>
<br>
He passed body after body, each frozen in terror and death.  So long.  It had been so long since he had faced such an evil and, in his failure, retreated in dishonor.  Never again had he wielded sword in T’ro’adon’s name.  Now he faced evil again, this time with only his symbol and faith to defend him.  This wasn’t an evil to be slain though.  The life in held in thrall was precious, indeed it held two lives in the balance and he would lay down his own life before he risked either of them.<br>
<br>
She stood alone in the great hall, drifting an arms-length above the floor.  Furniture and corpses lay shattered around her and a slow breeze toyed lightly with her hair and cloak.  Gaervalen’s staff lay forgotten several paces away.  <br>
She turned and looked with dimly burning eyes at the old paladin.  “Are you next old man?  Do you think to stop me as well?”  She drifted closer to him, head cocked quizzically to one side.<br>
“No child.  I only seek the one called Greeneyes by those who love her.”<br>
“Greeneyes Shahnra is not here old Dundare.  Only darkness and fire,” she said in a softly menacing tone.<br>
“She is here.  I know she can hear me.  Greeneyes Shahnra come down!”  Again his commanding voice rolled through her head.  “Fight her, Child!  Do not let Sapphire L’ree take you.  Do not let her win!”<br>
“Silence old man!”  She approached within five paces then stopped abruptly.  “What’s this?”<br>
T’ro’adon was with him, he felt the god’s power radiating from him, stopping the witch’s approach.  It only made her angrier.<br>
“You dare?” she screeched.  “I don’t need to touch you to strike you down!”<br>
“True enough.  But I know you won’t.  Greeneyes won’t let you.”  He was not as sure as he tried to sound, but there was nothing else he could do.<br>
“Greeneyes!  Beloved, No!”  He heard Pippen’s voice call out from behind him and almost shouted at the boy before he saw a brief glimpse of recognition and concern cross the face of Sapphire L’ree.<br>
“My love, no.  Don’t do it.”  Pippen stopped at Dundare’s side.<br>
“Why are you here?”  L’ree asked unsteadily.<br>
“I promised you, my Love.  I promised I would never leave you.  I’m here to keep my promise.”  Dundare heard only the barest tremor of fear in the bard’s voice.<br>
“The one you love is not here.”<br>
“But she is.”  Pippen took a single stem forward.  “I know she’s there somewhere.  So I must be here by her side.<br>
“To die?” the witch asked, her voice trembling.<br>
“If need be.  If she dies, I will die with her.  If you strike me down, my dying breath will carry my love to her…to you, my Greeneyes,” he whispered.<br>
“Strike?  Why…” They could now see in the witch’s eyes the battle waged in her soul.<br>
Pippen felt Lora’s soft hand on his arm as she passed him slowly.<br>
“Loreana.  Loreana Shahnra,” she said, stopping only two paces before her living nightmare.  She was trembling visibly.  “Loreana, your father is avenged.  Only those who love you dearly and need you desperately stand before you.”  Lora started crying softly, pleading with her older self for her own soul.  “Come back to us.  Come back to me.  I need you, Greeneyes.  I’m lost without you.  Pippen’s lost without you.”  She sobbed, barely able to continue.  “Come back, Sister.  Please come back to me.”  She closed her eyes to staunch the tears.<br>
“Lora.”<br>
She opened her eyes and saw Greeneyes standing before her, shaking.<br>
“Loreana, what have I done?”  Her eyes rolled up as she fainted.<br>
Lora took her in loving arms, slowing her fall, as they heard a scuffle from the other side of the room.<br>
Denan had a survivor by the cuff of his pants and was dragging him towards the group.<br>
“No, no, not her!  Get me away from her!  Don’t let her near me!”  The middle-aged human was terrified and a smack to his ear with the flat of Denan’s blade silenced him.  <br>
Placing a broad boot on the back of the man’s neck, Denan trussed him up like a calf, all four limbs tied tightly together.<br>
“I’ll give you anything you want.  I’m the Master of the Key, I can give you anything!” <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub141.ezboard.com/bthemithrilheartbrigade7573.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dorraxx>Dorraxx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br>  Posts: 2058<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/14/03 6:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 49</span><hr size=1> Denan slammed the guildmaster's face into the floor, grabbed one of his arms and brought it straight up while placing one knee in the man's back and the other on his neck.  &quot;Keep still an you may yet live.&quot;  He quickly tied the guildmaster’s limbs together like a calf.<br>
Lora let Pippen take Greeneyes and approached the man, heeding Denan's warning not to approach too closely.  &quot;What do you know of a man named Bryan Shahnra?&quot;<br>
Harfred Gillmont couldn't see her, but when he heard her voice all will to fight left his body.  He was deathly afraid of the witch who had destroyed his guild.<br>
&quot;No-nothing.  Never heard of him.&quot;  His voice shook in fear.<br>
&quot;Oh?&quot;  She lowered her voice slightly.  &quot;Your companions here were also unable to answer.  Do you really desire to join the ignorant?&quot;<br>
Pippen shivered at the girl's tone.  Lora and Greeneyes were indeed connected, for better or worse.<br>
&quot;He...he was nobody.  Just a mark.&quot;<br>
&quot;He was my FATHER!&quot; she screamed.  Dundare couldn’t help but jerk at the sudden ferocity in her voice.<br>
Harfred strained to turn his head toward her voice, his eyes grew wide with fear when he saw her.  &quot;You!  The girl!&quot;<br>
Again she summoned the minor spell that had been so effective before.  She hoped it had similar effect now.<br>
&quot;Who ordered his death?&quot;<br>
The thief’s lip quivered, both eyes on the multi-hued green ball of magic.<br>
&quot;I...I don't know,&quot; he stammered.<br>
Lora brought the magic closer to his face.<br>
&quot;I don't!  He only told me hire somebody...somebody good.&quot;<br>
She drew closer, her hand inching towards his nose.  He tried desperately to slide away and was stopped by the Dwarf's knee slamming his face down again with an audible smack.<br>
“Here.  Let me try.”  Lora looked up to see Greeneyes’ weary face as she slowly walked into the thief’s view.  He began uttering nonsensical noises.  Greeneyes glared at him and he swore he saw her eyes flash green fire.<br>
<br>
<br>
Guildmaster of the Iron Key, Harfred Gillmont, looked up from his ledger with a scowl.  How the intruder had made it into his office without warning he didn’t know, yet somehow he did know that the dark haired stranger was not a threat…not to him.  Somebody would loose a hand for this though.<br>
“Who are-” Harfred’s words died on his lips when his eyes met those of the stranger.  Black in black.  He felt his strength and will drain from his body.<br>
“I have need of your services, Guildmaster,” the stranger said softly.<br>
“Wh-what,” Harfred cleared his throat and tried to regain some of his composure.  “What services would those be?”<br>
The man reached beneath his cloak and pulled out a gold coin.  The master thief’s eyes were naturally drawn to what he saw was a very old coin, worth far more than it’s face value.<br>
“I wish you to kill this man.”  He held the coin out on his open palm.  A pale mist slowly rose above it, and in the mist, a face.  “Bryan Shahnra.”<br>
Harfred was slightly annoyed the stranger did not take part in the word play that usually went along with transactions such as this.  Years of habit the thief now pushed aside.  He opened his mouth to speak and was cut off.<br>
“There is a woman, and a child.”  The images of a red haired woman and a brown haired child appeared in the mist.  “No harm is to come of them, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>especially the child.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Is this understood?”<br>
Harfred nodded slowly.  Even if he wanted to protest, he couldn’t find the voice to do so.<br>
“I’m sure you know of one with the skills to handle his with discretion and competence.  Do not send one of your <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>thieves.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->” He stressed the word as if speaking of children.  “Two more things.  There is a symbol the man keeps around his neck.  Take this and keep it safe.  Someone will retrieve it.”  He paused a moment before continuing.  “Have your assassin deliver this message to his mark:  ‘The Avatar is come.  The Child of Shadow will be joined.’”<br>
A chill raced through the guildmaster’s body.  “It will be done.”<br>
The man with the midnight eyes reached into his cloak again and withdrew a small, heavy silk bag and dropped it on Harfred’s desk.  The thief knew by the dull clank that it held two gold bars.  The mint undoubtedly Torainian.  He didn’t move to retrieve them.<br>
“That should satisfy your greed.  Do not fail.”<br>
Harfred could only nod, and when the Master of the Iron Key blinked, the stranger with the black eyes was gone.<br>
<br>
<br>
Loreana was shaking.  Fear, anger, sadness, all fought for dominance.  Pippen grasped the girl by the shoulders and gently but insistently drew her away.  When he released her she stood there, her body still shaking and her gaze unfocused and distant.<br>
Greeneyes continued to stare at the Guildmaster.  “Now thief, my good friend there is going to loosen your bonds just enough for you to take me to the necklace.  No tricks, no traps, and I will let you live.”  She leaned towards the shaking man.  “But if I even think you’re twitching those fingers wrong, you will have a very long time to contemplate how you would rather be dead.”<br>
Harfred nodded slowly, the terror plain on his face.  Greeneyes nodded at Denan who untied then retied the cord as the assassin had bound Lora.<br>
Pippen and Dundare watched as the thief led them slowly to a door at the head of the hall.  As he reached for the panel next to the doorframe, Greeneyes laid her retrieved staff on his shoulder, causing him to jump.  “I’m deactivating a trap!  You almost caused me to spring it.”<br>
“That would have been unfortunate,” she whispered menacingly.  He nodded and the door opened with an audible click.<br>
<br>
Paintings, ornate statuary and finely carved woodwork decorated the large room the group entered.  Great shelves filled with bound texts and lacquered bookends lined the walls.  In the center, a huge teak desk and high-back cushioned chair completed the appearance of opulence and power.<br>
The Guildmaster walked around to the back of the desk.  Denan hopped up onto the desk, his boots creating dirty scratches in its polished surface.  Harfred’s squeak of protest was cut short by the point of Denan’s sword against his throat.<br>
“Carefully, Guildmaster.  No unfortunate accidents.”<br>
The thief thought better of what he was about to do, and slid his hand further to the left under the desk.  Another click and a small drawer popped open at the bottom of the desk.  Pulling out a small, brown cloth bag tied with a red string, he presented it to Greeneyes.<br>
“Open it and pour the contents onto the desk.”<br>
He did as he was told, hands shaking as he fumbled with the string and upturned the bag.  A large amulet and chain dropped to the desk.  “That’s it.  That’s all I have.  I’ve told you all I know.  Please let me go.”  His pitiful pleas were beginning to grate on Greeneyes nerves.<br>
Dundare took a step forward and waved his hand while whispering a word.  The guildmaster’s eyes rolled shut as he fell to the floor, his head thumping loudly on the desk as he fell.<br>
“Assuming he didn’t bang his head too hard, he should sleep soundly for a few bands,” Dundare said quietly.<br>
Lora slipped up beside the healer and grasped his hand as Pippen peered over her shoulder.  She then moved into the room and, looking towards Greeneyes and Denan, picked up the medallion and chain.  A tear fell from her eye as she clasped it tightly to her heart and closed her eyes.<br>
After a long moment, she again looked at Greeneyes, this time with expectation in her eyes, and held the medallion out to her twin. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub141.ezboard.com/bthemithrilheartbrigade7573.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dorraxx>Dorraxx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br>  Posts: 2059<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/14/03 6:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=7>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 50</span><hr size=1> The sun was setting as six shadowy figures moved slowly across the clearing that surrounded the temple.  Deep in the Drirrowmire Forest the structure rose from a damp, forbidding patch of land that defeated all attempts at the forest’s encroachment.  Mist rose from this ground, making each step uncertain and breathing difficult.  So thick was the fog that one could pass within fifty paces of the temple and not realize it.  Many creatures, both natural and unnatural, made the forest their home and only the most determined traveler could have made it to the clearing.  Many of the beasts of the Drirrowmire were dangerous predators, and not all of them were living, for the foul mist that surrounded the temple of Dierguroth slowly drained any life it touched.  When all life was gone the fog gave back a twisted and malignant life force of its own.<br>
<br>
Wordlessly, one of the six collapsed into the mud, chest heaving for breath, his young face twisted in pain.  A companion held a small flask of thick, clear liquid to his mouth.  The young woman, her black hair tied back revealing a pale but lovely face, held him up to her dingy breastplate and rocked him slowly, her leather and plated armor creaking in time.  She smiled briefly to give him the strength the potion could not.  The others kept silent vigil for long minutes as the young cleric regained some color in his face and finally signaled his readiness to continue.<br>
<br>
Eyes continually scanning the mists for the unliving guardians of the Black God, they continued on until the gray stones of the temple appeared suddenly before them.  Their wards had worked this far, the guardians had not been alerted by the destruction of the zombies further in the forest, but all were wary of the traps and all knew the unnatural creatures could strike at any time with the silent, single-minded determination of the undead.<br>
<br>
Reaching the wall of the structure, Fastag Morolen, the stocky, dark-haired dwarven priest of T’ro’adon, put his oversized warhammer at his belt and began moving along the stone, searching for the secret entrance he knew would be there.  The temple was built by dwarves after all.<br>
The High Priest of Dierguroth, Cruzaz Ror, had spell-slaved a small clan and set them to work building the God of Death’s shrine.  Forced to build a structure so inherently twisted and evil, the dwarves slowly died of sadness and despair, but not before they completed their own task.  They installed secret passages and doors that it’s vile inhabitants and their master knew nothing about.  Though they would not live to see it, they knew someday their kin would come and turn the temple against its master.  Fastag knew this as all his brothers knew, for the tale was held in the Stones, and he searched for the place that would give him passage.<br>
<br>
Forming a ring around the dwarven priest, the other five peered through the mists and above where the wall rose into the fog.  Though all were seasoned, the evil in the mists was so tangible, they had to continually fight off the feeling of utter hopelessness, the desire to give in to the silent voice of the fog.  Carlan Josh, the young human priest who had fallen, had only his faith in T’ro’adon the Stone God and the holy symbol he held in a death grip at his breast, to keep him going.  Jillian Corbet, another human and the warrior who had supplied the lifesaving potion to Carlan, silently recited the Seven Disciplines over and over while her eyes darted about at every imagined specter and ghost in the mists.  Miles Hardan, stoically silent and calm, seemingly unaffected by the will stealing haze, was in mental turmoil.  The way the fog warped sound and stole vision was driving him into an internal frenzy.  He longed for battle again so that his thoughts could be turned away from the intangible danger of the mist to the tangible bloodrush of the melee.<br>
<br>
Turning a corner as he continued his search along the stonework, Fastag leaped backward as a skeletal hand burst from the mud beneath the dwarf’s feet and grabbed his right boot with amazing strength.  The muddy skull of a long dead dwarf rose and snapped jagged teeth inches from the priest’s thigh.  Yelping in surprise, he scrambled for his hammer with one hand while delivering ill-aimed blows with the other.  Reaching the haft of the mithril and steel warhammer he gripped it in his broad hand and even as muscles tensed to swing the weapon he called ‘Stonesplitter’ another hammer of similar size but longer reach, came streaking down into the creature’s skull.  Bone fragments, mud, and rock exploded outward from the impact as the unholy bones were driven back into the ground.<br>
<br>
The dwarf looked up at the wielder of the hammer, Bryan, a young priest who had just been granted his title a month earlier.  His expression bespoke annoyance that the new priest though him incapable of handling a single undead.  In reality, the dwarf had been shocked at the suddenness of the attack and the dwarven features that had stared back at him.  The human read this in the older priest’s eyes but wisely kept to himself.  He also saw thanks in those eyes as the dwarf turned back to his probing.<br>
Dwarven High Priest Dalgoth Garun watched the silent exchange between his priests and thought about how well they worked together.  Each moved in compliment to the other.  He hoped they would do the same when it came time for the final step of the mission.  The High Priest turned his thoughts back inward as he contemplated what was ahead.<br>
<br>
Cruzaz Ror had come to these lands a century before and enslaved the children of T’ro’adon to do the work of Dierguroth.  This had angered the Stone God greatly, yet He had waited until now to direct His priests to action.  Perhaps time was no matter to the gods, or perhaps they waited for the proper time and circumstances for action.  Whatever the reason, Dalgoth’s faith in his Lord was unwavering and he knew that if he did all he had been directed to do, his small band would succeed.<br>
The task set forth for them though was not easy by any means.  After traversing the deadly forest and fighting the mists, they would have to gain entrance to the temple.  If indeed Fastag was right and his kin had built secret entrances into the temple, their mission had a better chance of succeeding than if they had to find a way in themselves.<br>
Once inside, if all went well and they hadn’t yet alerted the enemy, they would have to find a defensible position and prepare for the ceremony.  Cruzaz Ror had acquired a relic called the Circlet of Mists, an ancient construct that gave access to other planes and realities.  Ror’s purpose was the fulfillment of prophecy, the summoning of a god.<br>
<br>
It seemed like hours before the dwarf’s efforts were rewarded by the almost silent snick of a locking mechanism and the faint grating of stone on stone that seemed as loud as thunder.  Returning the hammer to his eager hands, Fastag crouched low and led the way in searching the blackness beyond with his dwarven vision.<br>
With a wave of his hand signaling all clear, the others followed.  Jillian ran a gloved hand across the stonework as she followed the dwarven priest in, noting that the walls were dry and clean, as if the passage had never been exposed to the wet air and fog of the forest.  Carlan was next, bending low to clear the opening he realized that though the passage was built by dwarves, its ceiling was almost six feet high.<br>
<br>
Stonepriest Dalgoth came after the young man, his thoughts only on the ceremony he would lead, leaving his personal safety in the hands of Miles Harden, the warrior who would willingly protect him even at the cost of his own life.  The inner turmoil that had been driving Miles to the edge of his sanity had disappeared within moments of his entry into the secret passage.  Stone walls, no matter how dark and dusty nor where they led, were something solid he understood and his mind quickly shifted to the task at hand.<br>
In the rear was Bryan who, like Fastag, would assist Dalgoth in the ceremony.  His thoughts were on the consequences of failure and all the good people whose lives depended upon their success.<br>
Such thoughts weighed heavily upon all in the little band as they made their way through a maze of passages and tunnels, each seeming to twist upon itself at impossible angles. Time and time again the party came to a sloping passage or stone stairway that led them deeper below the temple.  Led unerringly by the dwarf’s senses and stone knowledge, just as all thought themselves hopelessly lost, they came to a dead end that with a few touches in the right places, opened into a small, empty corridor.<br>
“Evil is near,” Dalgoth whispered, the first words spoken by the High Priest since they left the tree line.<br>
<br>
The band rounded a corner and, as if in answer to the high priest’s words, the dim orange glow of reflected torchlight appeared far down the passage, and a low, chanting murmur could be heard.<br>
“This is close enough,” whispered the High Priest.  “Stone Guardians,” now speaking to Jillian and Miles.  “Keep us safe…at least until the ceremony is complete.  We must finish before the priests of the Dark God conclude their summoning or all will be lost.”<br>
Receiving silent acknowledgement from the two warriors he looked to the young cleric.<br>
“Carlan, you must keep us secure from the creatures that may be sent against us.  May your faith be as stone my son.”<br>
“And yours as granite, Stonefather,” the young man said in reply as he gripped his holy symbol even tighter.<br>
<br>
Bryan and Fastag began creating a circle of protection around them and the high priest by spreading a thin line of obsidian and diamond dust from a small crystal cruse.  He laid another circle, larger than and encompassing the first, around the remaining three members of the group.<br>
Dalgoth began placing candles of gray, hard tallow at eight equally spaced points around the inner circle.  Once laid, he lit them with quiet words of magic until eight points of light cast flickering shadows on the stone walls.  Digging into the pack again he pulled a small platinum censure and a large, leather bound tome and set them before him as he kneeled on the cold granite floor.<br>
Lighting a small, white stick of incense, the High Priest motioned for his two fellows to kneel by him and join hands.  Placing the burning incense in the censure he grasped Fastag’s hand with his right hand and Bryan’s with his left.  Closing their eyes they began a quiet chant.<br>
The heavy atmosphere of evil lifted from around them.  The small band’s burden of depression and sadness was lifted from their souls, and they steeled themselves for whatever was to come.<br>
<br>
The Circlet of Mists stood upright in the center of the great chamber.  Already, a light mist rolled through its circular opening and darkness played from the depths of the portal.  Cruzaz Ror stood before the stone ring, arms raised and eyes closed.  His chanting echoed throughout the chamber.  Surrounding Ror and the Circlet were his acolytes and the undead minions who served him.<br>
<br>
The murmuring chant of the summons was interrupted by a roar of anger coming from both the Circlet and Ror himself.  Such a display of anger was common with the tall, gaunt man.  However the sound that issued from his mouth was no sound a human could ever voice.  Instantly, lesser servants of the Black God began sending out the undead creatures to find the cause of the disturbance they all felt.<br>
Silently, the decaying remains of humans and humanoids alike shuffled down the many passages throughout the temple.  Unseeing eyes moved in empty, rotting skulls as the creatures slowly, yet unerringly sought the cause of the interruption.  Moving more swiftly, passing the zombies, came the loathsome ghouls, cunning and cruel beasts whose twisted forms barely resembled the humans they once were.  Fiends long dead, pale things with fangs that could tear carrion or live flesh with equal viciousness loped down dark corridors.  Great white eyed brutes, barely humanoid, with flesh as dense as rock defiled the stone of the temple by passing through the walls as if they were water.  These and creatures far worse searched for the disturbing presence of good that had invaded their domain.<br>
<br>
A faint, golden mist issued from the mouth and nostrils of the Dwarven High Priest just as a hunched figure entered the hall.  Upon seeing the object of its hunt it leaped eagerly toward the party, green spittle running down its chin in anticipation of the soft flesh it smelled.<br>
Standing slightly apart, the two Guardians took defensive positions with swords at the ready, waiting to see if the circle of protection would hold.<br>
Cruzaz Ror continued his chanting as the mists roiled like a living thing.  A sickly mauve light lit the mists from deep within the gateway.<br>
<br>
Leaping for the closest two living beings, the ghoul was brought to an abrupt halt just short of its goal and with a shriek of frustration, recoiled from the barrier of protection surrounding the fleshy creatures.<br>
Miles and Jillian allowed each other a brief smile at the ghoul’s frustration but their satisfaction was short lived as four more of the foul creatures appeared.  One of these, unlike his drooling, gibbering fellows, had eyes that revealed an intensely evil intelligence.<br>
<br>
The gold mist slowly thickened and swirled until it entirely hid the three priests in the inner circle from view.  Carlan, mesmerized briefly by all that was taking place, was startled into action.  Grasping his god’s symbol, Carlan held it out towards the ghouls and chanted the words he hoped would turn away the undead creatures,  “Vile beasts of death and darkness turn away from the faithful servants of stone, turn from T’ro’adon.”<br>
The symbol of the hammer engulfed in flame flashed briefly with a low, fiery light.  Two of the ghouls shrieked in frustration and scrambled off into the darkness.<br>
The one, ghoul-like creature didn’t flinch.  “Nasty white fleshy thing cannot scare off I so easy,” said the ghast in a maddeningly high pitched voice.  “Our powers strong here,” it shrieked even as it moved closer, sensing the circle of protection.  “We are strong, we are many.  Soon Deathfather will be here and we will taste your flesh.”<br>
<br>
Carlan raised his symbol again, ready to attempt another dismissal.  A gray hand shot downward, into the circle of protection.  Its gray, stony flesh emerging from the ceiling above Carlan and grabbed his shoulder in a crushing grip.  Bones shattered and a cry of dismay and pain came from the young priest.<br>
Turning quickly at the cry, Jillian witnessed in horror the head of a creature emerge from the rock itself and clamp fierce fangs into the young man’s arm, then with a vicious twist of its head snapped the bone.<br>
With a scream of rage the young warrior raised her sword and struck at the wight’s head.  Steel bit into stony flesh as long claws raked across the dying priest’s face exposing bone and muscle.  Releasing the mutilated man, the creature dropped from the ceiling, ignoring the circle’s magic and advanced on the Stone Guardian.<br>
<br>
As the wight crossed the barrier of protection it failed and the ghouls and ghast began cautiously advancing toward Miles.  The warrior stood ready, his bastard sword glowing softly with its enchantments as he bounced it lightly in his mailed grip.<br>
“Fleshy thing not protected now,” said the ghast as it crossed the first circle. “Do fleshy things taste good I wonder?”<br>
The mist inside the inner circle was now a solid mass as it swirled in a silent gale.  No chanting could be heard from the priests within.<br>
<br>
In the chamber, the Circlet of Mists was now glowing brightly and a hot, foul breeze could be felt flowing from beyond.<br>
Claws narrowly missed Jillian as she thrust her long sword at the gray wight and sliced open its side.  The other clawed hand raked across her chest, opening her mail and slicing deep furrows in her skin and muscle.  When the thing struck her she felt the life flow from her body briefly and only then did she remember the stories of the deadly wight.  The weakness left her barely able to block the blows of the creature and she backed up to where Miles stood.  Miles was busy fending off the two ghouls and ghast.  Deep cuts across his face and legs had left him weakened and struggling to defend himself.  A final swing left one ghoul dead, yet he knew there would be others.<br>
<br>
The thick mist grew still.  The chanting peaked, then stopped.  Silence filled the chamber as Cruzaz Ror slowly lowered his arms.  The energies of the High Priest and his acolytes focused on the Circlet as a lazy ripple formed in the center of the mist.<br>
The two Guardians could barely lift their blades as the undead moved in, the smell of victory and sweet, living flesh at hand.<br>
The mist began circling the center of the Circlet.  A vortex formed and spiraled inward.  Deep within the depths of the whirlpool a dark form appeared.<br>
<br>
A wave of warm air wafted past the two exhausted warriors.  They looked back to see the gold mist explode outward like a hurricane, though they felt only a breeze.  The mist expanded, moving through air and stone, engulfing and destroying each of the creatures closing in upon the faithful defenders.<br>
Undead howled even as they turned to dust, acolytes bolted and ran in all directions, another supernatural scream of fury came from both Ror and the gateway as they were overcome by the cleansing gale.<br>
Ror was flung backward like a child’s doll.  The form beyond the gateway disappeared and the swirling mists vanished with a thunderous roar.<br>
<br>
“We are leaving NOW!” cried Dalgoth.  Grabbing the censure and book, he began running in the direction they had come.<br>
“We can’t leave Carlan,” yelled Jillian.<br>
Fastag stopped.  Hefting the lifeless man across his broad shoulders said, “Indeed it would not do to leave so faithful a Stoneson to this vermin.  Come girl, move those feet.  The unliving will gather again, for the ceremony will not have reached them all.”  The Dwarf turned and pushed on down the passage.<br>
Dalgoth, knowing stealth was not possible, lifted his symbol and murmured a few words causing it to glow with a dim, torchlight.<br>
Unerringly tracing their steps back, they came to the hidden doorway they had left ajar.  The pale face of a zombie appeared from the opening with others pushing from behind.  Holding out his symbol of the hammer and flame Dalgoth said simply, “By T’ro’adon, begone!”  The zombie instantly turned to gray dust, clearing the way for the party.<br>
<br>
Outside, as the five made their way across the clearing, the ground burst before them.  The skeletal remains of humans, dwarves and great beasts answered the call of the still living Cruzaz Ror.<br>
Miles tripped across the great bones of a giant as it rose from the ground and grabbed him by the legs.  Swinging his bastard sword around he sheared off the top of the thing’s skull, but before he could lift his blade for another attack, the giant lifted him in the air and flung him into the wall of the temple.  A dark stain appeared where his head met stone.<br>
“Miles, NO!”<br>
The giant turned empty eyes toward the girl and lumbered forward.  Bryan grabbed Jillian as she turned to run back, “Leave him, it’s too late!”<br>
“NO. No, not him too!” she cried, a mad look on her face.<br>
“Unless you want to join him we have to go!”  Not waiting for an argument he grabbed her arm and dragged her along until he felt her ripped from his grasp.  Turning, he saw her face down on the ground, fingers clawing at the dirt as a dozen rotting, skeletal hands dragged her down, into the soil.  Jillian was screaming insanely as she fought to keep herself from being buried alive.<br>
<br>
Bryan swung his hammer again and again at the corpses, crushing their bones into dust, but more burst from the ground to replace those destroyed.  He grasped her hands and pulled, urging her to hang on, but the supernatural strength of the hands continued to drag the woman down.  Even as he dug his heels in to give him leverage, more corpses burst through the soil.  Hands grasped and clawed at his legs, pulling him off balance and causing him to loose his grip.<br>
“Jillian!”  He broke free and lurched forward, trying to grasp her hands.  Their fingers touched briefly.  Then, she was gone.  “JILLIAN!”<br>
A huge ivory fist impacted inches from his face.  Bryan rolled away, breaking free of the grasping hands and pushed himself up.  The giant turned and raised its fist to strike again.  Bryan only spared a brief glance at the ground where the Stone Guardian had given her life before sprinting off after the remaining members of his band.<br>
<br>
Bryan found Fastag as the dwarf was crashing through the brush.  The dwarf was limping badly and one arm hung limply at his side.  He saw the shaft of an arrow protruding from the dwarf’s shoulderblade.  Dalgoth was nowhere to be seen.<br>
“Fastag!  Fastag!  Where is Dalgoth?”  Bryan grasped the dwarf’s good arm and lent him speed through the bush.  “Where is-“<br>
“DEAD!”  Fastag roared.  “Dead…like all tha others.  As we will be if we do not keep movin'.”<br>
<br>
The two priests could hear their pursuers.  Gibbering cries and taunts followed them for over a mile before they came to a deep ravine.  The brush crashed nearby and an arrow shot past their heads.  Fastag tripped, dragging Bryan to the ground with him.  The human could see the dwarf’s arm had turned a blackish-purple.  The veins in Fastag’s neck were bulging and turning the same color.  Poison.<br>
Bryan helped the dwarf stand and turn toward their pursuers.  Fastag readied Stonesplitter in his good hand then looked at Bryan.<br>
“Go.  I will hold them here.  I cannot continue.”<br>
Bryan gave the dwarven priest the look one would give the insane.  “No.  I’ve left too many of-“<br>
“No argument Stone Priest!  Go!  You must go!  You…” he hesitated, leaving words unsaid.<br>
“I will not!  If we must both die then so be it!  I will not-“  <br>
<br>
Fastag grabbed Bryan by his collar and pulled down, face to face, hoarsely whispering as he shook the human to emphasize his words.  Bryan’s jaw dropped, even as he slowly shook his head.  When he tried to speak, Fastag would interrupt with a shake and more words.  When he finished, Fastag looked into Bryan’s eyes with an intensity the human had never seen before, and pushed his fellow priest into the ravine.<br>
Bryan tumbled down the steep slope and landed hard on his shoulder.  Stunned momentarily, he finally shook his head and rose.  The sounds of steel and a Dwarven battlecry jarred him into motion, but just as he reached the base of the slope, ready to scramble his way back up, he heard a crash.  For one long moment the world around him came to a halt as a helm of Dwarven steel, a dark stain lining where it had been cloven in two, slowly bounced down the slope and landed at his feet.  In slow motion, Bryan reached down with numb fingers to lift the helm.  Only the gibbering laughter above his head broke the trance he had fallen into.  Grasping the helm tightly in one hand and his hammer in the other, Bryan Shahnra turned and silently moved away from the temple of Death and its minions.  In his head, a dark and overpowering presence spoke.<br>

Greeneyes gathered up the crying girl and held her tightly.<br>
Denan cleared his throat quietly.  “What did you see, girl?”<br>
“Our father,” the older Shahnra whispered.  “His failure…what started all of this.”<br>
“He was a priest,” Lora said, then pulled away to look at Dundare.  “Of T’ro’adon.”<br>
Dundare swallowed and came closer.  “May I see it?” he asked, indicating the holy symbol Lora held.<br>
She held it out to him, loosening the grip she had on it, its imprint bright on the palm of her hand.  Dundare took it and peered closely at it.  A round disk of pure platinum chased with gold filigree and imprinted on both sides.  One side held a war hammer enshrouded in flame and engraved with symbols and words too tiny to see.  On the other, more symbols and words in ancient Daergan, the High Dwarven language.<br>
Dundare nodded, “Indeed your father was a priest in service to the Stone God.”  He took the chain in both hands and placed it around Loreana’s neck.  “It is fitting for you to wear it, Child.  Now tell us what you have seen.”<br>
Lora held the symbol tightly again.  “A dark temple, in a forest.  He and others, priests, traveled to it to stop a ceremony.”<br>
“A summoning,” Greeneyes interjected.<br>
Lora nodded.  “They stopped it, but-“ she sniffed, “they all died…all but my father.”<br>
Denan shuffled one foot in hesitation.  “This Barradurn of T’ro’adon that your father said to seek…he may have more insight to the meaning of your vision.  He may know what mission your father was on and how he failed.”<br>
“The priest, Cruzaz Ror,” Greeneyes answered.  “The one in our vision who conducted the summoning.”  She looked at Lora then Pippen.  “It was he our father was to destroy.  That was his failure, for it was Cruzaz Ror who, in the end, destroyed me.”<br>
<br>
“But why?” Lora asked of no one in particular.  She sat with Greeneyes and the rest in the main room of the Griffin.  “Why does this Ror want you – me, dead?”  No one answered for a few moments.<br>
“Revenge?” Pippen finally whispered.<br>
Greeneyes shook her head.  “I don’t think so.  If it was he who ordered our father’s death, but to spare us…” She shrugged her shoulders<br>
“Why wait so long, and with-” Lora hesitated.  “With L’ree so powerful.  Why take the risk?”<br>
“That’s why we have to find this Barradurn,” answered Greeneyes.<br>
“In Daerga Ka?”  Pippen looked at his love incredulously.  “That’s leagues away…it would take weeks even by horse.”<br>
“What else can we do, Love?”<br>
He sighed, then nodded, “I’m coming with you.”<br>
She smiled and took his hand.  “As if you had a choice.  You still haven’t married me yet.”<br>
“I…why you jade eyed little…” he grinned and kissed her.<br>
“As am I,” Denan spoke out.<br>
“But…”<br>
He didn’t let the older Shahnra finish.  “You’re going to Dwarven lands.  You’ll have that much an easier time if there’s a Dwarf with you.  I know where Derek is, been there a time or two.”  He took a drink.  “And though it may not be much o’ a vacation, Megda may want to go as well.”<br>
They all looked at Dundare.<br>
“As I said, Child, I’m too old to travel now.  Just this little adventure today has made me feel ten years older even.”  He looked at Lora’s crestfallen expression and hung his head.  “Well, I guess it would be better than sitting around my home worrying if I’d ever see my two green-eyed girls again.”  He sighed and grinned as the girl threw her arms around his neck and squeezed.<br>
“Thank you, Dundare.”<br>
“Ah Child, I don’t think I could stand to worry about you and your older sister.  Anyway,”  He paused.  “I’ve always wanted to see the Dwarven lands.”<br>
<br>
Denan signed over management of the Griffin to Sarah, who had become quite a businesswoman in the years she worked for Megda.  Moving up from server to barkeep to assistant, she was a solid part of the inn and would moved easily into the management of it.  Kirken, on Dundare’s suggestion, would become her assistant, as well as ensure the establishment remained unharrassed.<br>
Megda wasn’t sure about the mission they were undertaking, but said she would not pass up a chance to return to the homeland.  Between turning over the inn to Sarah, getting their things ready for their journey, and making preparations for Greeneyes and Pippen’s second try at their marriage ceremony, Megda was in constant motion.<br>
Dundare insisted the young couple marry before their departure and despite the reappearance of Sapphire L’ree, Pippen was steadfast in his desire for Greeneyes hand.  The old healer oversaw their promises with Denan and Lora as witnesses.  Denan also stood as the bride’s father, extracting the promise from Pippen to care for his daughter.  Megda stood in as Pippen’s mother to receive the same promise from Greeneyes.  Pippen’s parents were from Oakfjord deep in the Southlands and could not come.  They wished the happy couple well though.  Pippen explained his father was infirm and couldn’t travel.  He had not told his parents the details of the couple’s meeting and unusual courtship.<br>
All went as planned this time.  Greeneyes and Pippen did as Lora suggested and, on the last day before they were to leave for the Dwarven lands, rented a lovely apartment overlooking the Walk of Faith.  Denan’s gift to the couple.  As the couple enjoyed their accommodations, and each other, on the far end of town, and the wedding guests lived it up on fine drinks and good company, Lora excused herself early.  This time, she fell fast asleep, undisturbed by the distant connection she shared with Greeneyes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub141.ezboard.com/bthemithrilheartbrigade7573.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dorraxx>Dorraxx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br>  Posts: 2061<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/14/03 6:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=9>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 52</span><hr size=1> “They have broken the Pact!” Kremak Trennor yelled out in ire, as if his brethren didn’t understand.<br>
“We do not know this for certain, Kremak,” Maeldon Stennis replied.  The Master of the Assembly rose to restore order to the hall.  “Nothing indicates a mass uprising of the Torain Wichta.”<br>
Triesta Wilstire spoke this time, her tone, as always, level and with little inflection.  “One or all, the Pact is broken, deny that Master Stennis.”<br>
Maeldon sighed, “I do not.  But even if it were an entire caeban, we cannot just act indiscriminately.  Then the Pact would be broken at our hands as well.”  He looked across the table at the twenty mages gathered in the tower hall.  “The law states that the Pact <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>is</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  It is no truce or treaty, it is Law!”  He pounded his fist on the table.  “Any who break it are answerable.”<br>
“Do not preach to the choir, good Master,” Thenmark Tor Pragtor said quietly, causing the din to fade.  “We need a plan of action to bring those who <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>have</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> broken the Pact to justice.  The Wichta themselves may deliver these to us.  The Council of Diamonds is not eager to start a war.”<br>
“The Wichta Council’s thoughts are not open to us,” Triesta said.  “They have not approached us in this matter yet.  Have they?”  Her eyes turned to Maeldon.  He shook his head.  “Surely they are aware,” she continued, “that one of their lesser covens was obliterated.”<br>
Thenmark answered, “That in itself indicates that the whole of the Nine Pale Hands were not involved.  So far we have only been able to locate one who survived.  The Council of Diamonds may view this as an internal matter.  Perhaps they will deal with it to show the Pact still stands.”<br>
“Has this one been approached?”  Keandu Mackwell asked.<br>
“No.” Thenmark replied.  “We chose to wait until this meeting to decide a plan of action.”<br>
“Is she the one under suspicion of causing this, calling upon the forbidden Powers?”<br>
“That is difficult to ascertain, and the greatest reason I waited for this assembly.”  Thenmark waved his hand before him causing an image to rise above the table.  The mages leaned forward to study the young, chestnut-haired human girl.<br>
“She is too young,” Triesta said matter-of-factly.  “Fifteen, maybe sixteen.”  She sat back.  “Even if she were in her twenties the power we saw loosed was too great.”<br>
“However,” Rynor Willton, one of Thenmark's fellow investigators interrupted.  “She has been most difficult to observe.  Too often we have been cut off by some form of interference.”<br>
“Active defense?” another mage asked.<br>
“Unknown.  An item perhaps, but the times are random.”  He rose from his chair, gathering their attention.  “I propose she warrants further investigation.  I have additional information that this assembly will find interesting.”<br>
Thenmark spoke up, “Have you withheld anything?”  He did not like being surprised or upstaged.<br>
“Of course not.” Rynor said dismissively.  He had, but it didn’t matter.  “This is new.  Observe these images of the human girl.”  He waved his hand and they saw a burnt building with the girl standing nearby.  The image was shadowy and details were difficult to make out.  “This building was the home of the druid Maralaya Selthai.  The druid whom we believed watched over the Nine Pale Hands coven.”<br>
<br>
A minor uproar burst from the assembly.  Rynor waited dramatically for a few seconds then waved again.  “And this is what we found three days ago when we scried the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>young</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->,” he stressed the word, looking at Triesta, “human Wichta.”<br>
The image of the great hall of the Iron Key rose before them.  Dundare, Pippen, Denan, the former guildmaster and Lora stood amongst the wreckage of the deadly storm, again the image was shadowy and indistinct.  They all saw the bodies though, that and the same young girl with the striped chestnut hair.<br>
“There are others with her,” Triesta said once the uproar subsided.  “Have you identified them?”<br>
Rynor looked somewhat deflated.  “No.  They are of little import though.  They are not Wichta.”<br>
“Not Wichta, but they may be aiding one.”  Keandu said.<br>
Maeldon waved away the image and motioned for the assembly to calm.  “So with one suspect, however slim the accusations may or may not be, our next action is to conduct a personal investigation.”  He got the agreement he wanted from the assembly.  “Who is to conduct the investigation?”  When no one leapt to suggest a person, Triesta spoke.<br>
“One in my sphere, Alek Kabrok, is well trained in this form of investigation.”<br>
“He’s not much older than this girl!” Rynor snorted.  “What use is he?”<br>
“As I said, he is well trained in investigation, he is very adept and has excelled in my study.”  The corners of her mouth tilted upward ever so slightly, the barest hint of a grin that was the most emotion any had ever seen from the mage.  “And as you said my esteemed colleague, he is not much older than she and quite a comely young man…if I do say so myself.”<br>
Rynor sat back down, barely surpressing a shudder at what he thought the mage’s studies might consist of.<br>
<br>
The boy fumbled with the three packs he carried.  He was overloaded and trying to carry all three large pieces of luggage up the gangway almost ended with him and those items in the Miera Kiy bay.<br>
Lora caught one of the smaller packs before it went over, saving the young man from diving in after it.<br>
“Uh, thanks,” he stammered, trying to put the bags down and shake her hand simultaneously.  “I think I carried too much.”<br>
She giggled.  “Seems so.”  He shyly looked away when their eyes met.  “Do you need help?  I mean…”<br>
“N-no,” he replied, embarrassed.  “I’ve got them.  Now that I know I’m not going to have to swim after them.”<br>
Lora laughed again.  He was cute.  Older, maybe sixteen or seventeen summers, and had sandy blond hair that didn’t lay in any one direction, light blue eyes and a crooked, shy grin that made him look younger.  He was about half a foot taller than she was, but not lanky.  The loose clothing he wore seemed more appropriate for warmer weather, but he didn’t seem to notice.<br>
“Well, ok,” she said, sliding away and grinning.  “See you.”<br>
“Bye,” he said as he tried to pick up the three packs again.<br>
Lora spun around on one foot and went back into the ship’s berthing area where she and her companions had been assigned.<br>
Pippen watched her come into the room they had designated their ‘common’ room, actually his and Greeneye’s room.  “You sure perked up suddenly.”  Her wide grin was infectious and he smiled broadly.<br>
“Oh it’s nothing,” she sat on the bench that took up almost half the little space.<br>
“Uh huh,” he grinned wider and went back to his writing.  He was working on a ballad to while away the time aboard.<br>
<br>
The Crimson Spinner got underway just as the sun touched the water that evening, when the winds moved back over the water from land strong enough to carry the galleon lightly through the water.  Almost immediately, Greeneyes was green in more places than her eyes.<br>
“Why are you sick and I’m not?” Lora asked, more than a little amused as she saw her sister lean over the rail a second time.<br>
Greeneyes shot a look that told Lora it was lucky she couldn’t move at the moment.  “I think I’m paying for my transgressions.”  She paused, almost heaving again which caused Loreana to wrinkle her nose.  “I could have swore I knew a spell that would fix this, but I can’t for the life of me remember it.”  This time she did heave, and Lora moved away.<br>
“I’ll go get you a wet cloth…or something,” she tried not to grin.  “Sorry,” she said as she turned away.<br>
“So am I.”  She leaned over the rail again.<br>
<br>
Pippen found Denan standing on the bow of the ship, feet on either rail, leaning into the wind as if he owned the world.<br>
“I thought Dwarves didn’t like boats,” he said after a few moments of enjoying the sunset.<br>
Denan turned his head slightly and grinned at the young human.  “No less so than anyone who’s never seen the ocean before, young Pip.  Boats are not foreign to us.  There are many underground rivers and lakes we traverse regularly.”  He jumped down and turned to face the bard as he leaned against the rail.  “It’s the wide open sea that gets many o’ us for the first time.  But remember,” he took a deep breath and exhaled noisily.  “I’ve been around for a while young pup.  I’ve done my fair share o’ travelin’.  Quite a bit o’ it on the wide-open ocean.<br>
“The ocean?  You mean Marin’s Sea?” Pippen asked in awe, referring to the sea that lay past the Southlands.<br>
“Aye, that and the Western Deep.”<br>
Pippen nodded and grinned.  He had taken the riverboats south to his home a few times but had never been out on the ocean.  He loved it.  It made him feel a little guilty when he saw how sick it made his love, but she wanted to suffer, at least this, alone.  Penance, she said, and he left her to her misery.<br>
“Where are we going?” Pippen asked after a few minutes of silence.<br>
“Ael Byrnra.  Miera Kiy’s counterpart in Tye Basra.”  Denan paused to run his fingers through his beard.  “They call it the Jewel of Miera.  A wondrous city of spires and white stone.”  The Dwarf closed his eyes briefly.  “They’ve got a temple on every other major road it seemed, spread throughout the city instead o’ all crowded in one spot.  Beautiful mosaics, streets tiled in scenes from their history or myths.  Ponds and gardens where animals walk without fear amongst the people.  A true feast for the eyes I think you’ll enjoy.”  Denan nodded at Pippen’s grin.<br>
“From there we’ll take a river trader along the coast to the river that empties into the East Stone of Kire’”<br>
“East Stone?” the bard asked.<br>
“Aye, the three huge lakes are called the Three Stones of Kire’, from an ancient myth so I’m told.  All three lakes are interconnected and fed by several rivers, then ultimately empty into the great Kire’ River which ends at Marin’s Sea.  We’ll cross the East Stone to Corpridge then get off in Selterton, Tyrna.”<br>
“The many-headed snake,” Pippen said, referring to one of the nicknames for the Independent Duchies of Tyrna.<br>
“Aye.  In any given year there’s a dozen or so Duchies, all involved in a game of politics that makes King’s Crook look like child's-play.  I went through Selterton three times in one year and paid traveler’s tax to a different Duchy each time.  The people don’t pay much attention and pay their tax each year to whoever’s collecting.  The guilds don’t even deal with the dukes because it’s too much trouble to keep track o’ who owns what city when.”<br>
Pippen laughed, “So we have to pay when we go through?”<br>
Denan nodded but waved his hand dismissively.  “Aye, but it’s a paltry sum as are their taxes.  It’s the only way to keep the people from revolting and establishing a stable government.  Other countries leave ‘em alone for the same reason the guilds do.”  He pulled out a flask of water and took a drink, then offered it to Pippen.  “From there we travel overland to Tyrna city, then cross into Daerga Ka.”<br>
“How far to Derek from there?”  Pippen handed the flask back to the Dwarf, who tucked it back in his shirt.<br>
“Still a few days.  We can’t take the underground routes, so we’ll take the trade routes.”<br>
“Why not the underground route?”<br>
“They’ve been off-limits to outlanders for a while, since before I was born.”  Denan looked out over the waves.  “Times were that all travel and trade was welcome to the Tunnels under Daerga Ka.  Ah I wish you could see them, young Pip.  Fifty Dwarves could stand side by side and on top o’ another in those tunnels.  Whole cities lie along the routes, just like the human countries above ground.  Great granite gates are spread throughout for defense, but I’ve never seen one closed.”<br>
“Why are outlanders forbidden from the tunnels now?”<br>
Denan shrugged, “Some say because of attempted incursions by Dak Kaska Tar to the North, but that’s only up North, and only in the last hundred years or so.  We’re told that it’s in our best interest to keep outlanders from despoiling our cities and lands, but…” he trailed off.<br>
<br>
He didn’t believe it, Pippen could tell.  “What do you think?”  Pippen prompted when the Dwarf didn’t continue.<br>
Denan looked at the young human, his expression indecipherable.  “I think we’re afraid.”<br>
“Afraid?  Afraid of what?”  Pippen couldn’t believe a Dwarf could be afraid of anything.<br>
Denan shrugged again.  “Of loosing our identity.  Loosing it amongst the rapidly growing and changing younger races.”  He hung his head, ashamed of his next words.  “Of loosing ourselves to the ways of humans.”  He looked at Pippen then back to the sea.  Pippen could only stare at his hands awkwardly, not finding the words to ease his friend’s shame.  “I’m fascinated with your race Pippen.  So colorful and varied.  Every human I’ve ever met, for good or bad, is a world of beliefs, habits, attitudes and contradictions.  Like you and Greeneyes.  So very different yet drawn to each other like bees to the flowers.  Even Lora, who is by some amazing twist, the same person as your Greeneyes, yet she too is different in her own unique way.”<br>
“Part of growing up.  I don’t imagine you’re the same person you were before you left Daerga Ka for the first time,” Pippen said as he too stared out over the waves.<br>
“Aye, and you’re right.  But for those who never leave, never travel as I have, they see humans as a threat.”  He looked at Pippen.  “We live a long time, Pip.  Many times what your span of years will be, but children are rare for us, while-“ he turned away, fearful he had said too much.<br>
“I know, Denan.  I’ve seen families with a dozen children, all fighting for a single meal a day.”  He placed his hand on the Dwarf’s broad shoulder.<br>
Denan nodded.  “That’s what scares us.  Some of us anyway.  We see a race that is still young, growing and spreading across our lands and outnumbering us a thousand to one and more and we wonder how much longer before we’re pushed aside.”  He sighed.  “So we close our gates and outlaw settlers and turn in on ourselves.”  He turned toward his human friend again.  “I can’t tell you you’re gonna get a warm welcome, Pip.  Outright rudeness is not our nature, but you may be stared at, or ignored, by some.  More so as you get deeper in the lands.”  He shook his head.  “I wish I could say it won’t be that bad, but it’s been almost a hundred years since I’ve been home.  I don’t know how it’s going to be.  That’s why I insisted on going.  Greeneyes and Lora would not likely make it far unless they traveled on foot or on their own transport.”<br>
Pippen nodded and patted the old Dwarf’s shoulder.  “We’ll do fine Master Denan.  They’ll do fine.”<br>
“Aye, I hope so boy, I hope so.” <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub141.ezboard.com/bthemithrilheartbrigade7573.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dorraxx>Dorraxx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Gat Slinga</span><br>  Posts: 2062<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/14/03 6:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub141.ezboard.com/fthemithrilheartbrigade7573frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter 53</span><hr size=1> Kruk’s shift was almost over.  The Guerga swung his hammer against the stone splitter twice more, then paused.  He heard a whisper, even against the background of pounding hammers and falling stone, but didn’t see anyone near him when he looked over his shoulder.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>…almost there.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
Kruk looked back to where the stone splitter hung in the crack in the wall.  Picking up the hammer, he swung.  Again and again.  Corded muscles stood up beneath his splotched yellow skin.  Every hair on his hide stood straight up.  It was calling him, whispering promises of arcane power.  Kruk’s muscles screamed with pain as he hammered furiously to widen the crack in the stone.  His ears were numb from the sharp echoes of steel on steel in the tight tunnel.  Other workers were just now ending their shifts; glad they were not the ones who would have to break down the walls and shore up the ceiling before the next tunnel excavation.<br>
<br>
They were miles deep within the mountain, though they had only dug downward maybe a hundred paces.  Each week the workers dug fingers off the main tunnel.  When the Osanni foreman deemed the fingers deep enough, they reinforced the ceiling then broke down the walls between the fingers.  They had no idea how long they would be digging, Dempurgast Mangst never told them, but the work paid well and kept them fed.  The human priest had long ago gotten bored with watching the excavation, leaving that dry task to the Duke’s Osanni Lieutenant.  This last week though, the High Priest of Dierguroth had made more than one appearance, twice arguing with Mangst then storming off.<br>
<br>
Kruk swung the hammer even faster, muttering ‘Scresg’ between each breath. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Almost.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Just when he felt his muscles were about to explode from the effort, he heard a sharp crack as the stone splitter drove through to its head.  The right side of the stone shook then fell inward.  Kruk jumped back to avoid getting crushed beneath the tons of stone and rubble that fell into the tunnel.<br>
Waving his hand to clear the dust from his eyes, he saw a small, black hole in the wall.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Almost.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Taking the hammer to the wall, Kruk broke away the stone, making the hole larger.  He could feel it now, pulsing, beating in time with his heart…or was his heart beating in time with it?  Kicking loose a final stone, he dropped the hammer and squeezed into the man-sized hole.  He couldn’t see it, the thought of bringing a lantern never crossed his mind, but he could sense it.  Walking into the dark cave, he knew the object was only a few paces in front of him.  Fearlessly he reached out his hands and took the last steps toward his destiny.<br>
<br>
Ror kicked aside the dry husk of the Guerga that had broken through to the Circlet’s resting-place.  “Fool.”  He waved away the workers who moved to retrieve their fellow.  “Leave him, as a warning to any others who cannot otherwise resist the urge to touch.”  He looked at the ebon stone ring, then up at Mangst and nodded.<br>
“Shore up and break away the last of the walls,” Mangst’s deep voice echoed through the tunnels.  “We move the artifact on the morrow.”  The Osanni gave the High Priest one final glare before turning to direct his workers.<br>
<br>
Carefully placed in a wide, iron-banded crate by Ror’s undead servants, the Circlet of Mist’s power pulsed softly.  The black stone of the artifact packed safely away, forty workers standing shoulder to shoulder lifted the crate onto the specially constructed wagon.  Those forty, and forty more, took up two stout ropes and started the long haul back to the surface.<br>
<br>
<br>
“What is it you want, Wizard?”  T’ara, the new Mistress of the decimated Nine Pale Hands, stood defiantly before the White Robe’s representative.<br>
“You know what I want, what the Assembly wants.  The same thing you want: the Wichta who did that.”  He waved his hand dramatically toward the doorway that led outside the ancient tree’s chamber and to the ruins of the Caeban’s encampment.  “Your Caeban broke the Pact.”  He quickly raised a hand to stay T’ara’s protest.  “By the actions of your former Mistress and this Wichta.”<br>
<br>
“You must know she is not here,” T’ara replied finally.  “We are not even sure who it was.”<br>
“You know who it was.  The Shahnra child.”<br>
“L’ree?  It could not have been her.  She was only inducted that night.  She’s a child, there’s no possible way she could have that kind of power.”<br>
“That you know of,” the mage said cryptically.  “Why do you think the Pact was brought about?  The Dark Craft cares not for age or station.  She obviously had dealings with it long before now.”<br>
T’ara shook her head.  She and C’ara had heard the disturbance at the center of the camp just before all hell had broken loose.  She only briefly saw the one who had called the demon to confront L’cia.  A quick glimpse of white streaked hair was all she had of apprentice L’ree, but something hadn’t seemed right.<br>
<br>
“The Assembly seeks an answer.  If you cannot deliver Loreana Shahnra, then I must deliver you and those that remain of the Nine Pale Hands.”<br>
“Those that remain have no dealings with the Dark Craft.  L’cia kept her secret even from me, and she is now dead…as are those who served her.”<br>
The mage sighed and clasped his hands before him.  “I understand that Mistress T’ara.  I am only a messenger of the Assembly’s desires.”  His black eyes twinkled briefly.  “I have no wish to see the innocent brought to trial.  We both seek justice.”  He paced a short distance before continuing.  “I need your help to bring Shahnra to the Assembly.”<br>
T’ara hung her head.  She had few options.  The Council of Diamonds had already spoken concerning the incident.  They did all but disband the Caeban.  She would find no further aid from the Diamond Wichta.<br>
The mage raised a hand, palm forward and his eyes rolled back in his head.  “I know where the she is going.  We must move quickly if we are to catch her.”  He glanced at the doorway leading outside the chamber.  “But they must all come.  The whole of your Caeban must stand before the White Robes with the accused.  Only that way can their innocence be verified.”<br>
“But they are not involved,” T’ara exclaimed.<br>
“I know that, you know that, and I suspect the Assembly knows that, but…” he leaned closer to whisper.  “The Assembly themselves are not the ones driving this.  The Druid Maralaya is dead.  It is the Children of Gaervalen who guide the Assembly’s hand in this.  If we do not deliver the Pact Breaker…we will all answer for the druid’s murder.”<br>
<br>
<br>
“We did not anticipate the Black God’s minions moving to acquire the younger Shahnra so quickly.  For that, you have our deepest regrets.”<br>
Mara’s shade bowed to accept the apology.  “It was Gaervalen’s will that I train the elder Shahnra instead of the younger.  His eyes see further and deeper than ours.”  The twelve Druids nodded at the Thirteenth’s wisdom.<br>
“The Child of Shadow’s path is strewn with hazards.  Even now she missteps again.”  The First rose from her seat, her beautiful, ethereal form towering above the heads of the other druids.  The Elan took two gliding steps to stand before Maralaya.  “Our part in this act is complete.  Whether we have any further part is now up to which path the Elder Shahnra leads the Child of Light.”<br>
“The Black God will not stay his minion’s hands in this,” a stout, bearded druid whispered.<br>
“If the Elder Shahnra chooses to walk in Gaervalen’s shadow, she will overcome.”<br>
“And if she does not?” he asked, knowing the answer as they all did.<br>
The ghost of Maralaya Selthai looked into the pale, golden eyes of the Elan.  “There will be no third chance…for any of us.”<br>

<br>
Sometime in 1986 (or there-abouts), while going to a Navy school, I was Game Master for a group of AD&amp;D players. We played what was probably the best session I had ever Game Mastered using the Ravenloft Module.  Because my mind was on undead, vampires and the lot, when I picked up a Dragon Magazine that had a ruleset for a Witch type of character, I decided to see what I could come up with for a good NPC to play against my players.<br>
<br>
Thus was born the Witch, Sapphire L'ree. Sapphire being an indication of her power level which I found appropriate to my campaign. I frankly don't remember if the name Loreana Shahnra was thought of before or after, but I suspect before.<br>
<br>
I didn't have a chance to use her in the campaign though. But I *was* very interested in my creation. Something so beautiful and so evil was fascinating to me.  I wrote my first short-short about her sometime in 1987/88: the demon summoning, which is in Chapter 9 as a flashback.<br>
<br>
I had written a few shorts about her and thought about how to use her in a campaign once I started playing again, but she didn't develop much beyond that for a few years.<br>
<br>
Around 1990, I wrote a short-short: The Beginning (now Chapter 50). It has been heavily modified because it was not originally part of any story, just some background information on the source of L'ree's evil. Her father's part in it was added several years later.<br>
<br>
Around the same time I wrote the 'The Bear Tamer' short-short (now in Chapter 6). An origin for Sapphire L'ree's path of darkness she would take in her life.<br>
<br>
In 1992, I chose to use L'ree in a game GM'd by a friend. Because she had no use in the game as a totally evil character, I softened her a bit. Defined her evil, if you will. Instead of evil for evil's sake, I filled out her tortured past. Her search for power, convinced it could right the wrongs, drove her to the darker side of power.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the creation that had originally fascinated me, now had captured me. In 1994, I began to wrack my brain. How can I change this totally evil creature to a hero? I wanted to write about her, wanted it desperately for reasons few people know, reasons I myself didn't know until about a year ago *hugs Ninou tightly*.  But I didn't want to change Sapphire L'ree.<br>
<br>
That was when the dual nature of Loreana/L'ree was born. I gave my evil Sapphire L'ree her 'Second Chance'. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Once I topped that peak, the writing flowed. The story wrote itself, things I never intended, never thought of writing, got written. Pippen, Denan and Megda just happened, Cruzaz Ror, Sandrak Desmane and Guptras Den's stories are just starting (and still needing to be filled out in what I have already written, though the story stands fine as-is).  I wrote in a frenzy from 1994 to 1998.  A frenzy because the story often came to me in bits and pieces, chapters coming out of sequence and horribly written in pencil on a steno pad while I was out to sea on another submarine.  Not only was the story written, but the world of Andar more fully fleshed out, the races and rules of magic defined (and separated from their AD&amp;D origins), the gods created, the history and politics written.  The Dwarven language is still being created, an extremely difficult process for somebody who only knows one language and isn't particularly interested in the rules behind that one. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (gods I hated High School English). I even designed the written, Dwarven, base 12 number system (don't ask why, it will most likely never be used).<br>
<br>
All of that to write this story that wanted to be written.<br>
<br>
Aside from bits and pieces in the future of the story, the writing frenzy stopped sometime around 1998/99. The two Lora's finally discovered their beginnings, their connection. There's more to be written, but the part that really needed to come out, did.<br>
There's a whole lot more to their story however...I just need to write it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Oh yea, and sometime in late 1999 I discovered Evercrack, created Dorraxx from a previous AD&amp;D character nowhere near as old as L'ree, then created the Necromancer Loreana Shahnra.  You will see Dorraxx sometime in the near future in The Second Chance. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center>
