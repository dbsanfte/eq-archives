<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Ninou rubbed her blurry eyes,muttering she pulled herself up...<br>
<br>
Where was she?<br>
<br>
Blinking,her vision cleared up,the dock.....she was at the Butcher Block docks.  Grumbling she pulled out her flask and took a sip...<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn,&quot; She tossed the empty flask to the ground,and stretched her neck. She couldn't remember leaving Freeport,she must have been passed out for most of the journey. Sighing,she lifted her heavy back pack and slowly made her way off the dock. She didn't go too far,her legs were numb,she had been sitting for too long. Frowning she leaned up against a hut,her head throbbed. Closing her eyes she rubbed her temples.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ninou&quot; A voice rang out in the silent night.<br>
<br>
Not opening her eyes Ninou slid to the ground,her head felt heavy,&quot;What?&quot;she snapped.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ninou,open your eyes child,look at me!&quot;The voice was gentle,almost a loving tone...<br>
<br>
Gritting her teeth Ninou blinked open her blurry eyes,&quot;What do you wan.....&quot;she stopped in mid-sentence.  A child-like figure stood in a radiating aura of golden light. Whether it was male or female was undeturnable,a smile so innocent covered the smooth face while bright eyes seemed to pull you into their blue depths.<br>
<br>
Ninou's eyes widen,she pushed her way back up the wall,watching as the being floated up to be eye level with her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your..your...&quot;she stuttered.<br>
<br>
The little eyes saddened,&quot;Ninou,my poor poor child. I have tried everything to keep you following the right path. I have failed,so,I shall give you one more choice.&quot; Quellios reached out,gently caressing Ninou's tear streaked face.&quot;You have become so bitter,so much hate has consumed your heart. I'm afraid you are hurting yourself more and more each day by living the way you have.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ninou wiped at the tears in her eyes,&quot;What shall I do?&quot;her voice was but a whisper.<br>
<br>
Quellios sighed,as if what would be said would be even more painful,&quot;I understand the hurt that is buried deep within you,but my child....you can not go on like this.....&quot;a small hand pointed to the empty flask on the ground.<br>
<br>
The voice become stronger,demanding,&quot;The true way of a Paladin is through forgiveness. So what I ask of you is to forgive....<br>
<br>
&quot;Forgive you parents for abandoning you, forgive your younger sister for having the comfort of a family while growing up.<br>
<br>
Forgive the warriors who enslaved you as a child,who abused you,who used you to satisfy their own personal needs.<br>
You must forgive the Rogue who stole your heart,only to crush it,.......&quot;<br>
<br>
Ninou's dark eyes widen as her hands flexed,the blood pumping through her veins,began to pump faster. &quot;No....&quot;She shook her head,&quot;No...I ..cant, I...no...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ninou,you must forgive everything. You have to find peace in order to for fill your duty as a Paladin...&quot;<br>
A<br>
s Quellios spoke,Ninou's mind raced,her memories flooding through......<br>
<br>
The grinning faces of the warriors as they held her down,each taking their turn........<br>
<br>
The feel of the Rogue's body pressed against hers as they kissed passionately.....<br>
<br>
More and more memories,torture,beatings,kisses,love.....<br>
<br>
A heated rage surged through her,she screamed,and struck out,only to strike thin air....Quellios was gone..<br>
<br>
Breathing hard,she slumped to the ground,trying to calm the rage that held her......<br>
<br>
From some where in the darkness another voice rang out....calling to her...tempting her....fueling the hatred that had finally reached it's limit......<br>
<br>
Ninou nodded,she understood,she was scared but she understood.....<br>
<br>
&quot;I hear you,&quot;she cried,&quot;Please....just take me!&quot;she sobbed as a faceless monster approached her. He reached a ghastly arm out and touched her forehead.<br>
<br>
A tingling sensation swarmed through her..and she felt it transform what little bit of hope and love she had into hate......everything went black...<br>
<br>
The sound of running water woke Ninou,jumping up she remembered the events of the night before....glancing around she is amazed to find she is now in Erudin......<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh dear..what have I become?&quot;She breathed..realizing her power was now different too....she no longer felt the need to heal..only the need to destroy....<br>
<br>
Once again,Ninou has become a pawn....this time there is no escape,only the path of darkness is before her.....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mistress Ninou<br>
Shadow Knight of the Tribunal<br>
<br>
May your heart be filled with hatred,for that is the true powerful emotion!<br>

<br>
This may be a totally off the wall post, but Lady Ninou (Sorry in advance for spelling errors) seems rather &quot;lively&quot; for a female Paladin. I also should wonder, is she a human? <br>
Either way she is quite unusual with all this talk of &quot;Pets&quot; and &quot;Whipping&quot;. I wonder what she is all about? If she could do a little explaining I would be most appreciative. <br>
Fare thee well,<br>

<br>
------------------------------------------------<br>
Ahhh the story of Mistress Ninou,<br>
I be Ninou's sister,I be alittle mad and all,but I be a good person.<br>
Ninou,and I did not grow up together....<br>
She be older then me.<br>
Ninou be born in Erudin,our parents being poor folk and all did not have time to take care of a child. So,they left Ninou by the dock,in hopes that she be taken in by a kind traveler. Kind traveler indeed,what collected Ninou was a group of warrior men. One of the wenches they traveled with took her in. She be raised as a slave,her duty was to please,in more ways then one. After years of abuse among these men,my sister be able to escape. She headed to Qeynos,there she vowed she would never be used by another man. Growing up among the warriors Ninou learned to fight. Though her kind could not be a warrior,she could be a Paladin. she wanted to help others,protect them from the abuse that she under gone as a child. Only the bitterness and hate be instilled deep into her soul...<br>
The day I met my sister for the first time again rocked her into more bitterness. For you see,I was raised by our parents....and she was raised by these men. I use to not be crazy...I was a good soul...a happy soul. We became friends,I be the closest friend Ninou has,though even she does not fully trust me. I met a rogue in Qeynos who was a good friend...I adored him,but I did not take up a relationship,for my heart belonged to another. The man I loved was a cleric....he was strong on his holy standings. A night together,brought our world to a tumble. He was a fallen man,and he needed to repent his sins. He left me,and my heart broke so much that I became mad....<br>
I had to leave Qeynos,I traveled across Norrath in a daze..I not knowing where I be going..I be just going. Ninou,chased after me...she followed me all the way to Greater Faydark. It is where I reside now. Upon this travel to GF,my sister ran into the Rogue. He was charming,dashing,all that a Rogue should be...<br>
She fell in love,but that not be the end of the story at all that be the beginning. This Rogue be a married man....<br>
Ninou's heart turned colder,and the bitterness flooded to the top.....she came to drinking more. It seems that once again a man had used her.....<br>
Once again she made a vow,this time that no man, no matter who he be will have control over her again...this time...she be the one in control! From then on she has been Mistress Ninou......a woman who will never let a man run her life again......<br>
So,as you see,no she isnt very paladin like,but....would you be?<br>
Maybe some day,her heart will mend from all that has been done to her...maybe not...one can only hope and pray.....<br>
So in part..Ninou is a good woman,she does have a good heart,it just be trapped under years of pain and abuse..... <br>
