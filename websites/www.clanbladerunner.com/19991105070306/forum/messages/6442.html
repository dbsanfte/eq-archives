: I asked what their recommendation would be, and this is what I got out of it.

: They all say the same thing, TNT2 is the best product to buy, IF YOU GOT THE HARDWARE FOR IT. This is not because the TNT2 is superior in performance, they’re pretty close to each other, but because the TNT2 is prepared for the future technologies like AGP X4, it has 32MB onboard memory etc. Just remember that the TNT2 (or any other non-3dfx based product) does not support the Glide API.

On the other hand it’s not likely that we’ll see any future games that does not support D3D and/or OpenGL as well, but one should be aware of this.

: Their recommendation for a TNT2 rig is a CPU running at 400MHz or better to be able to get good performance out of it. Not even the latest of Intel's CPUs, the P3 500 MHz, is enough to make the gfx card the bottleneck in your system.
: If you've got a slower CPU, and you're not thinking of upgrading for a while yet, the Voodoo3 is most definitely a better product when it comes to performance. Should you already have a Voodoo2 card in your not so TNT2 friendly =) machine, and you have a PCI slot available, buy another Voodoo2 card and make an SLI rig. That's by far the best price/performance configuration since the price of the Voodoo2 cards dropped significantly when the Voodoo3s arrived.

: Hope this helps,
