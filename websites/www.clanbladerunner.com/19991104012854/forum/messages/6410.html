Hey guys...<p>I started the new job on Monday this week.  It's great and I know I'm going to learn a lot.  School + commute+ work + family life = tired GIP.  They're already trying to figure out what days I'm going to be available for training.  I'll be spending several weeks in FARGO, ND for some of this stuff... they're already talking about sening me for 4 days in the middle of May.<p>So my question is... do any of you Canadian BR's live near Fargo?  I don't have a clue what my schedule will be like there, but if any of you are close by, I'd love to visit.<p>My wife used to live in Buffalo and I went up there once during the Summer.  Other than that, I've never been that far North, and NEVER been that far west (I live in North Carolina).  I'm just glad I'm not going up there in February (one of the new guys was there).<p><br>See ya,<br>GIP<br>

: Hey guys...

: I started the new job on Monday this week.  It's great and I know I'm going to learn a lot.  School + commute+ work + family life = tired GIP.  They're already trying to figure out what days I'm going to be available for training.  I'll be spending several weeks in FARGO, ND for some of this stuff... they're already talking about sening me for 4 days in the middle of May.

: So my question is... do any of you Canadian BR's live near Fargo?  I don't have a clue what my schedule will be like there, but if any of you are close by, I'd love to visit.

: My wife used to live in Buffalo and I went up there once during the Summer.  Other than that, I've never been that far North, and NEVER been that far west (I live in North Carolina).  I'm just glad I'm not going up there in February (one of the new guys was there).
