<center><font size=+2>About Silver Blade..</font></center>
<font size=+2></font>
<p>For quite some time, I've been wanting to take a few minutes to sit
down and type up a page telling people who don't know who we are, or what
we are about, all about us.
<p>For many years I have played online games over the internet, and have
enjoyed myself tremendously. I have played many games, and all the games
were fantastic, but the game was not what hooked me, It was the company
that I kept while playing the game.&nbsp; The way I see it, the games that
we play together, are mostly just a tool, an interface for many friends
to get together, and hang out, talk, cut up, laugh, and learn about one
another.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, all the games are independantly great,
it's just the comraderie of our guild that makes the games truly addicting.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>The guild now knows as ASB started out in Diablo, about 3 years ago.&nbsp;
We were two seperate guilds, one called Clan Bladerunner, and the other
called Order of the Silver Star.&nbsp; Each guild consisted of great members,
which in turn became great friends.&nbsp; As life in Diablo progressed,
our seperate guilds found something lacking, and that was the need for
more trustworthy people we could venture with.&nbsp; A few members of OSS
contacted a few members of BR, some negotiating with rules and other things
took place, and as a result, an official alliance was created between the
two guilds.&nbsp; Our rules, and game styles were identical, the only thing
different was the people in the guild.&nbsp; At first, the two guilds were
reluctant to play together, as everyone in some form or fashion fears change,
but eventually, games started forming where many of the players were of
both guilds.&nbsp; Many new friendships came about, and trust was being
gained daily.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>We then turned to the world of Ultima Online, the game was very different,
but the companionship was the same.&nbsp; In both games, we had set rules
about what we could and couldn't do.&nbsp; We played neutral-good aligned
characters with no player killing allowed.&nbsp; If you carried yourself
in a KeWlDooD fashion, chances were, we had no need for you.&nbsp; Some
of us, mainly myself, had tendancies to lean towards the neutral-evil side.&nbsp;
This was not feasible in the world of Ultima Online, because it went against
what our guilds were all about.&nbsp; To be on the evil side of the alignment
scale, usually meant you were recognizing player killing as a part of game
play.&nbsp; Being evil, versus rampant pkilling, is not the same thing.&nbsp;
I hold the concept of honor and trust as the highest form of being in anything
I do, as does my kin in the Silver Blade. Pkilling is not a form of honor,
nor trust.&nbsp; Duels are fights of honor, where both parties agree and
adhere to certain rules, and that both parties are in agreement of the
fight.&nbsp; This, in my eyes, is not an act of malice.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>As you probably know by now, we have ventured forth in the new game
of Everquest.&nbsp; Here, we have changed our concept and philosphy a bit.&nbsp;
We no longer set restrictions on good aligned characters.. You may play
whatever you wish, hence the "Adventurer" part of Silver Blade.&nbsp; We
have no calling to rid the land of evil, nor of good, we have no set vendetta
to do anything, other than enjoy each other's company, expand our playstyles,
and reap the benefits of an online evening with our friends in a game that
we all enjoy.&nbsp; Enjoy your time in the world of Norrath, and help each
other out.&nbsp; Start up the tool of friends called Everquest with the
intent on enjoying your evening, day, or night, with people you know you
can trust, and carry yourself honorably.
