  <p>For quite some time, I've been wanting to take a few minutes to sit down 
    and type up a page telling people who don't know who we are, or what we are 
    about, all about us. </p>
  <p>For many years I have played online games over the internet, and have enjoyed 
    myself tremendously. I have played many games, and all the games were fantastic, 
    but the game was not what hooked me, It was the company that I kept while 
    playing the game. The way I see it, the games that we play together, are mostly 
    just a tool, an interface for many friends to get together, and hang out, 
    talk, cut up, laugh, and learn about one another. Don't get me wrong, all 
    the games are independantly great, it's just the comraderie of our guild that 
    makes the games truly addicting. </p>
  <p>The guild now known as ASB started out in Diablo, in early 1995. We were 
    two seperate guilds, one called Clan Bladerunner, and the other called Order 
    of the Silver Star. Each guild consisted of great members, which in turn became 
    great friends. As life in Diablo progressed, our seperate guilds found something 
    lacking, and that was the need for more trustworthy people we could venture 
    with. A few members of OSS contacted a few members of BR, some negotiating 
    with rules and other things took place, and as a result, an official alliance 
    was created between the two guilds. Our rules, and game styles were identical, 
    the only thing different was the people in the guild. At first, the two guilds 
    were reluctant to play together, as everyone in some form or fashion fears 
    change, but eventually, games started forming where many of the players were 
    of both guilds. Many new friendships came about, and trust was being gained 
    daily. </p>
  <p>We then turned to the world of Ultima Online, the game was very different, 
    but the companionship was the same. In both games, we had set rules about 
    what we could and couldn't do. We played neutral-good aligned characters with 
    no player killing allowed. If you carried yourself in a KeWlDooD fashion, 
    chances were, we had no need for you. Some of us, mainly myself, had tendancies 
    to lean towards the neutral-evil side. This was not feasible in the world 
    of Ultima Online, because it went against what our guilds were all about. 
    To be on the evil side of the alignment scale, usually meant you were recognizing 
    player killing as a part of game play. Being evil, versus rampant pkilling, 
    is not the same thing. I hold the concept of honor and trust as the highest 
    form of being in anything I do, as does my kin in the Silver Blade. Player 
    killing is not a form of honor, nor trust. Duels are fights of honor, where 
    both parties agree and adhere to certain rules, and that both parties are 
    in agreement of the fight. This, in my eyes, is not an act of malice. </p>
  <p>As you probably know by now, we have ventured forth in the new game of Everquest. 
    Here, we have changed our concept and philosphy a bit. We no longer set restrictions 
    on good aligned characters.. You may play whatever you wish, hence the "Adventurer" 
    part of Silver Blade. We have no calling to rid the land of evil, nor of good, 
    we have no set vendetta to do anything, other than enjoy each other's company, 
    expand our playstyles, and reap the benefits of an online evening with our 
    friends in a game that we all enjoy. Enjoy your time in the world of Norrath, 
    and help each other out. Start up the tool of friends called Everquest with 
    the intent on enjoying your evening, day, or night, with people you know you 
    can trust, and carry yourself honorably. </p>
