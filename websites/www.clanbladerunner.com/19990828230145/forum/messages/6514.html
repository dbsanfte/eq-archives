Hail,<p><br>    When I first instaled EQ I had some similar problems.  What I did was went to the EQ official home page (www.everquest.com) and went into the Tech section.  When there go and look at the video card FAQ and it will list a bunch of video cards.  Find your card and make sure that you have the proper driver that is compatable with EQ.  It would also be helpful if you listed your type of video card and what mode you are running it in (3dfx, Glide, Open GL...).  Hope this helps.  BTW, You can get to the EQ site by going to www.clanbladerunner.com/asb.<p><br>-Cendaenea/Amallana....Formerly Ishamael<p>
