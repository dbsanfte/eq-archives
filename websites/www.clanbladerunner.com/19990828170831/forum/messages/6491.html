: Muna, Alex left UO and transfered me his houses...  So if you still play enough to refresh the house that you used to share, I'll transfer it to you.  Otherwise, is there anything inside that is yours and that you don't want me to sell and do you want to be refriended to the house?<p>I got some shit in there.. my potions and weapons and armor etc. I guess I could start playing enough so I could refresh the house.<p>I gotta meet you in IRC someday, so we can meet in UO :)<p>
