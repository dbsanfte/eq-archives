: The SMTP Server emma.WhyWeb.com was attacked from a AOL user, causing the outbound email servers to be &quot;Black Listed&quot;.
: WhyWeb has since closed this security hole from allowing any additional relaying by any non WhyWeb accounts.
: If you are experiencing any returned email please send a copy of the returned email along with the address to whom it was sent to.
: To: Techsupport@WhyWeb.com 

: Due to the recent rely and spam attacks, we have increased once again our security filter to stop this type of activity.
: By doing so, this has put a limitation of some email clients to pass the filters.
: If you are not receiving bounced email stating &quot;denied access&quot;, but are however receiving a error message while sending new email,
: check your settings. If you have a non WhyWeb.com email account set for your reply-to-address, then only the email clients
: listed below will allow you to support a third party email account for your reply-to-address.

: 
: Netscape 4.o or higher built in email
: Microsoft Outlook 98 or higher
: Outlook Express (build 4.72.3310.5) or higher
: and MS Internet Mail & News, that supports &quot;Reply to address&quot; under the advanced setting.


: 
: OK, so WTF does all that mean??

: Are those the ONLY clients i can use?

: Do i need to change the server addresses or go with pop.clanbladerunner.com?
