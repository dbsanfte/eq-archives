<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="arial" size="2">Well Keepers, as you know it is REQUIRED
for you to have the ability to port to Thurgadin... the ONLY exception to this requirement
is if you are a porting class.&nbsp; The reason we require this is for a few reasons:
&nbsp; If we need to mobilize the guild fast, we can get everyone together no matter where
they are...&nbsp; If you go LD in a bad spot and aren't able to get in far after the guild
has left the area, this will save you and us from a hard CR.&nbsp; This is a quick and
easy method to gain the ability to port.</font></p>

First off, you need a pottery skill of around 120, where these are trivial ( <a
href="#pottery">See guide at bottom to get this skill up</a> ) <br>
<br>
Go to Crystal Caverns and start farming! &nbsp;You need Crystilline Silk, Small Bricks of
Velium, &nbsp;Small pieces of Velium. &nbsp;You will need these on a ratio of 3 : 1 : 2. <br>
<br>
The components you need for each potion are as follows: <br>
<br>
</font><font face="arial" size="2" color="#FF80C0"><strong>Velium Vial</strong></font><font
color="#FFFFFF" face="arial" size="2"><br>
Combine on a pottery wheel: <br>
3 Crystilline Silks (from spiders in CC) <br>
1 Small Brick of Velium (from orc miners in CC) <br>
2 Glass Shards (from left-most vendor in Thurga bank) <br>
<br>
This results in an <strong>unfired vial</strong>. <br>
<br>
Combine in Kiln (oven right next to wheel): <br>
1 Unfired Vial <br>
1 High-quality Firing Sheet (from left most vendor in thurga bank) <br>
<br>
This results in a <strong>velium vial</strong>. <br>
<br>
Now, go out of the bank take a right and head towards the church (stay left at the fork). <br>
<br>
Inside the second merchie building on the left is Frundle Frenkler. &nbsp;Hail her and say
&quot;What velium vapors?&quot; &nbsp;She tells you the recipe and gives you: <br>

1 Velium Vial <br>
2 Small Pieces of Velium <br>
<br>
The purifier will poof and you will be holding the Thurga gate potion... woot! <br>
<br>
The potion will gate you onto the bridge you cross when you enter Thurga.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="arial" size="2">Easiest way to always have one in inventory
is keep a few velium vials in the bank at all times and everytime you use one, grab your
velium vial and 2 pieces of velium and go make another one.</font></p>
