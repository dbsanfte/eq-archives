                INFO</strong></font> <br>
                You are NOT qualified to roll or be awarded loot until you pass your probationary
                membership... unless noone else on the raid can use the dropped loot or everyone in the
                raid from that particular class has received something. The probationary membership lasts
                for approx 3 weeks from initial invite to the guild. What this does is attempt to keep out
                the guild hoppers who are interested only in loot. We are a guild built on fairness,
                friendship and family... we know everyone loves a nice piece of loot, but this should not
                be a determining factor as to why you are in the guild... if it is then this is not the
                guild for you. If you are willing to come, help and be a part of a great family of
                friends, then waiting a few weeks won't be too much to ask. <br>
                <br>
                If you are not in probationary period the following loot rules apply to you. <br>

                case of an open raid; guests and probationary members will have the same rights to roll on
                items as full members would (see below for 'full member' rules). Prior to starting a raid
                it would be announced if open rules apply to that function. <br>
                <br>
                <font color="#FFD2D3"><strong>NEED BEFORE GREED</strong> </font><br>
                All members will qualify for loot following these guidelines. Once a member has won a
                roll, they will then drop out until the next round. In the case of class specific loot...
                all members in attendance who CAN use the item and WILL use the item, are allowed to roll.
                If none of the specific class wish to use the item, any others who want to roll for said
                item may do so. In the case of members not wanting the item, the guild will keep for
                either a person unable to attend, put in guild bank or to use to boost guild funds.
                (please see exceptions on rolling for loot below) <br>
                <br>
                WILL USE the item is defined as having an item of lesser worth in either usefulness or
                value than the item in question. While we want to equip our members with the best
                equipment, we also do not want to have items going to members who will bank/sell the item
                at the first opportunity, especially if there is someone who can and will make better use
                of the said item. <br>
                <br>
                <font color="#FFD2D3"><strong>BP's and LEGGINGS </strong></font><br>
                The guild assigns ALL BP's and Leggings. This is due to the rarity of their drops. These
                items are to be awarded BY the officers in charge or the guild leader. <br>
                <br>
                <font color="#FFD2D3"><strong>PLANES LOOT </strong></font><br>
                Class specific loot will go to the appropriate class attending the hunt. If more than one
                of the same class is in attendance they will then role to decide the winner. The winner
                will then drop out of the roll until the next round. Only exception here is with BP's and
                Leggings as described above. <br>
                <br>
                <font color="#FFD2D3"><strong>THURGA QUEST LOOT</strong></font> <br>
                In the case of a Kael raid where the Thurga quest armor drops, all classes able to use
                said piece of armor will roll... you MUST have at least amiable faction with the Coldain
                in order to roll on a piece. Only exception here is with BP's and Leggings as described
                above. <br>
                <br>
                <font color="#FFD2D3"><strong>BENEVOLENCE QUEST LOOT</strong> </font><br>
                The Benevolence quest in Western Wastes... all folks in attendance are able to roll on
                this great piece of gear but you MUST have Ally faction with Claws of Veeshan to roll on
                it. If you do not know the quest <a
                href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1255" target="_blank">check here</a>
                for more info. <br>
                <br>
                <font color="#FFD2D3"><strong>AWARDING CERTAIN LOOT</strong></font> <br>
                For the most part only BP and Leggings will be awarded... on occasion the raid leader may
                decide to award certain items in the case that it would better benefit the guild as a
                whole. <br>
                <br>
                <font color="#FFD2D3"><strong>CASH LOOT </strong></font><br>
                All cash loot that drops will be looted by your group leader... then all coin and gems
                that drop will go to the raid leader at the end of the raid. This cash then goes to the
                guild bank to help pay for stones, peridots, coffins, etc. <br>
                <br>
                <strong><font color="#FFD2D3">UPGRADING GEAR</font> </strong><br>
                If you are 'awarded' an item we REQUIRE you to donate the item you upgraded from so
                another guildie will be able to upgrade from what they have. If you win a 'roll' on an
                item you are NOT required to do so, but it is always appreciated. (EXAMPLE) Soanso the
                Enchanter is wearing a Siren Scale Robe and is on a Hate raid... a Insidious Robe drops
                and is awarded to them... Soanso is then required to hand over the Siren Scale Robe to a
                guild officer in order for it to be awarded to someone else in the guild who is in need of
                an upgrade. <br>
                <br>
                Also if you have gear that you no longer need and would like to donate it... we do have a
                couple guild banks that store gear, spells and such for these purposes. <br>
                <br>
                <font color="#FFD2D3"><strong>ALTS</strong></font> <br>
                If you are playing your alt and are on a raid (i.e. you are not hydraing) your alt will
                have all the rights and privileges as a full member. If you are hydraing an alt on a raid,
                you are automagically moved to the end of the loot list, which means you are not allowed
                to roll on loot until all mains have received something. Also, please do not ask if your
                alt can have a specific piece of loot that drops, as it is most likely a main in the guild
                will be able to use.<br>
                <br>
                On occasion, the raid leaders may ask for you to bring your alt on a raid instead of your
                main, due to needing that class more... in this case, if you so wish, you can opt to be
                there for loot as your main. (example: we ask player_01 to bring their warrior on a raid
                instead of their druid... player_01 has the option of being there for rollable druid loot
                instead of warrior... which means they would not be included in the roll table for
                warriors.) This would be taken on a case by case basis and only at the request of the raid
                leaders... this would also be announced prior to raid.<br>
                <br>
                <font color="#FFD2D3"><strong>TROUBLE WITH NON-GUILDIES REGARDING LOOT</strong></font> <br>
                While the guild will do all it can to protect its members, we will not get involved in
                loot issues while members are grouped with other individuals. Ninja looting, training and
                Kill-stealing are looked upon with GREAT distaste by the community as a whole and we will
                not tolerate any individual within the guild carrying out such acts. If you find yourself
                the victim of such an act, then the guild officers or leader will act on your behalf to
                try to resolve the situation as fairly as possible to all parties concerned. If you find
                yourself accused of such acts as detailed above then be aware this is grounds for
                immediate removal from the guild, however we would need proof of such an act being carried
                out be it in the form of a screenshot or substantial, eyewitness testimony. <br>
                <br>
                PLEASE NOTE: We like to keep such things out of open forums such as the Saryrn Tavern and
                if you are brought into a flame fest on the Saryrn boards... don't fight back as that just
                fuels the fire and makes everyone involved look childish. If such a situation occurs,
                notify a guild officer and they will try to take care of it. <br>
                <br>
                <font color="#FFD2D3"><strong>TROUBLE WITH GUILD DECISIONS REGARDING LOOT</strong></font> <br>
                If you are upset with a decision regarding loot distribution please take your grievances
                to a guild officer or the guild leader and it will be discussed at that point. Lets keep
                such things out of open forums or guildchat as most problems can be resolved privately. <br>
