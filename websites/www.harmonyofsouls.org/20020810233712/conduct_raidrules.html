                    <P><B>Key People on the Raid</B><BR>
                      It is imperative to know who the following people are, what 
                      their functions are, and how to interact with them appropriately: 
                    </P>
                    <P><B>Raid Leader (RL)</B><BR>
                      The RL is the responsible for the raid and has ultimate 
                      authority over the raid. It is the raid attendees' responsibility 
                      to listen to the RL and follow the RL's instructions. The 
                      RL has final say in all matters concerning the raid. The 
                      RL is the only person with the authority to request a cleric 
                      to camp. </P>
                    <P> <B>Loot Master (LM) </B><BR>
                      The LM is responsible for distribution of raid loot. HoS 
                      issues loot by merit. The LM may or may not be the same 
                      person as the RL. All questions about loot and requests 
                      for item awards should be directed to the LM in the form 
                      of a direct tell. </P>
                    <P><B>Main Assist (MA)</B><BR>
                      The MA is the main tank. Unless directed otherwise by the 
                      RL, all raid members should assist the MA using an assist 
                      hot key with auto attack turned off. (The obvious exception 
                      pertains to individuals providing mezzes and other forms 
                      of crowd control.)</P>
                    <P><B>Secondary Assist (SA)</B><BR>
                      The SA is the secondary tank. Depending upon the tactics 
                      dictated by the RL, the SA may be the backup MA (in the 
                      case of the MA's death, LD, AFK, etc.) or the SA may be 
                      required to tank "add" mobs. All raid members should assist 
                      the MA unless directed otherwise by the RL. </P>
                    <P> <B>Tertiary Assist (TA)</B><BR>
                      In some raids a TA is identified. The TA is tertiary tank, 
                      which is a logical extension of the SA above. </P>
                    <P><B>Group Leaders (GL)</B><BR>
                      The GL is responsible for his/her group. The raid leader 
                      should ensure that his/her group understands and follows 
                      the RL's directions. The GL is responsible for announcing 
                      group member deaths, LDs, and relevant AFKs in the raid 
                      channel. The GL is responsible for responding to the RL's 
                      requests for group status in the raid channel. The GL is 
                      responsible for looting his/her group's kills and reporting 
                      loot to the LM. The GL will only loot droppable loot. </P>
                    <P><B>Buffers </B><BR>
                      Buffers are identified in the raid channel. Individual buff 
                      request should be made by a direct tell to the buffer. Group 
                      buffs are made by the GL in to form of a direct tell to 
                      the buffer. Requesting a non-essential buff during a pull 
                      is considered bad form. </P>
                    <P><B>Puller(s) </B><BR>
                      The puller runs out and brings back the mobs. Do not follow 
                      the puller. </P>
                    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><IMG SRC="images/bord1c.gif" WIDTH="361" HEIGHT="26"></FONT></P>
                    <P><B>Channels and Raid Communication</B><BR>
                      With the introduction of raid channels, raid communication 
                      has become much easier. However, different channels are 
                      configured for different purposes. HoS uses the channels 
                      listed below. An explanation of channel usage accompanies 
                      each channel listing. </P>
                    <P><B>Raid Channel</B><BR>
                      The RL will establish a Raid Channel. All raid attendees 
                      must join this channel. The raid leader will use this channel 
                      to issue raid instructions. It is crucial for raid attendees 
                      to pay attention to the directions delivered in this channel. 
                      Chatter on the Raid Channel must be minimized. One more 
                      time, chatter on the raid channel must be minimized. Assists, 
                      pulls, mezzes, debuffs, snares, etc., should be called in 
                      the Raid Channel. Important raid related announcement should 
                      be made in the Raid Channel.</P>
                    <P><B>Specialized Channels </B><BR>
                      Depending on the raid tactics, specialized channels (e.g., 
                      a Healer Channel) may be configured at the discretion of 
                      the RL. </P>
                    <P> <B>Group Channel</B><BR>
                      The Group Channel is used for group coordination. Mana and 
                      other status should be reported to the Group Leader using 
                      this channel. Raid attendees that need to go AFK should 
                      inform the GL using this channel. Heal messages should be 
                      issued in the Group Channel unless it is a cross-heal. Any 
                      questions concerning the raid should be asked in this channel 
                      first. There is a very good chance that a group member will 
                      know the answer. </P>
                    <P><B>Guild Channel </B><BR>
                      Chat that is non-essential to the raid may be conducted 
                      in the Guild Channel. Guild-specific issues or concerns 
                      should be directed to the Guild Channel. </P>
                    <P> <B>Direct Tells</B><BR>
                      Buffers expect direct tells. The LM expects direct tells. 
                      A very urgent issue or emergency may be handled by a direct 
                      tell to the RL. </P>
                    <P><B>Other Channels</B><BR>
                      Raids should be fun. A couple of clever emotes can lift 
                      spirits after a nasty CR. </P>
                    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><IMG SRC="images/bord1c.gif" WIDTH="361" HEIGHT="26"></FONT></P>
                    <P><B>Engagement</B> <BR>
                      A raid is assembled to take down mobs. That's why there's 
                      a raid, after all. Each raid employ's its own strategy, 
                      but common tactics are listed here. </P>
                    <P> <B>Assist</B><BR>
                      Unless directed otherwise by the RL, assist the MA by using 
                      an assist hot key with auto attack turned off. Do not engage 
                      the mob before the MA calls for the assist. One more time, 
                      do not engage the mob before the MA calls for the assist. 
                      Yet once more, do not engage the mob before the MA calls 
                      for the assist. (Again, the obvious exception pertains to 
                      individuals providing mezzes and other forms of crowd control.) 
                    </P>
                    <P><B>Nukes</B><BR>
                      Do not nuke early. Nuking at 50% health is a reasonable 
                      rule of thumb unless otherwise directed by the RL. Be very 
                      care when using DoTs.</P>
                    <P> <B>Pets</B><BR>
                      At the discretion of the RL, pets may or may not be permitted 
                      during a raid. No pet may be summoned unless authorized 
                      by the RL (with the obvious exception of wizard familiars). 
                      Any player using a pet must maintain control of the pet 
                      at all times. If a pet owner goes AFK, the pet must be destroyed. 
                    </P>
                    <P><B>Positioning</B><BR>
                      In general, unless directed otherwise by the RL, stand behind 
                      the MA while waiting for a pull; the only individuals that 
                      should be in front of the MA are the pullers and, possibly, 
                      individuals engaged in crowd control. When fighting, be 
                      aware of what is happening to the mob and how your actions 
                      may affect the mob's position. The MA or the RL may call 
                      for re-positioning the mob (pushing or centering the mob).</P>
                    <P><B>Stand up</B> <BR>
                      At this level of play, stand up upon the pull call. </P>
                    <P><B>Looting</B><BR>
                      Only the GL may loot his/her group's kills. The GL may only 
                      loot droppable items. </P>
                    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><IMG SRC="images/bord1c.gif" WIDTH="361" HEIGHT="26"></FONT></P>
                    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Lag Mitigation</B><BR>
                      It is important to minimize lag. Lag causes fights to be 
                      lost. Lag causes wipes. Whereas computer configurations 
                      vary widely from individual to individual, the following 
                      are suggestions to reduce lag: </P>

                  <P><B>Common Courtesy </B><BR>
                    The following are common sense items that make a raid pleasurable 
                    for everyone. </P>
                  <P> <B>Fun<BR>
                    </B>Have fun. Enjoy the raid. Crack jokes in the appropriate 
                    channels during downtime. Make new friends. See new zones. 
                    Take down that big bad boss mob. Gratz on that uber loot!</P>
                  <P><B>Language</B><BR>
                    HoS does not tolerate profanity, racial slurs, or raid attendees 
                    engaging in personal attacks. Of course, gnome-bashing is 
                    fully encouraged. Bragging or complaining about experience 
                    gained during a raid is in very poor taste.</P>
                  <P><B>Promptness</B><BR>
                    Raids are listed with a specific time. This is the time that 
                    attendees are expected to be at the raid, not en route to 
                    the raid. The raid start time is not a good time to be asking 
                    in the Guild Channel for a port. However, due to real life 
                    responsibilities and time zone differences, it is understood 
                    that members may wish to join a raid in progress. This is 
                    permissible upon approval by the RL.</P>
                  <P><B>Patience</B><BR>
                    The Key People listed above usually receive a zillion tells. 
                    An immediate response to a question or buff request is sometime 
                    not possible. Be assured, it is nothing personal. Polite requests 
                    usually are answered expeditiously, but occasionally tells 
                    pile up or an emergency arises. During a Corpse Recover (CR), 
                    let the RL and people actively engaged in the CR perform their 
                    tasks with minimal interruption. </P>
                  <P> <B>Listen</B> <BR>
                    Listen to directions in the Raid Channel and follow them immediately. 
                    If something is not clear, it is much better to ask a question 
                    than to do something that wipes the raid. </P>
                  <P><B>Understanding</B><BR>
                    All raid attendees are human beings including the RL and LM. 
                    Not everything goes perfectly and mistakes do indeed occur. 
                    This is all par for the course. If all encounters were easy, 
                    EQ would be quite dull. </P>
