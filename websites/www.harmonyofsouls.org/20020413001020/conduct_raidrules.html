                      There is a sign up sheet for every event on our board. If 
                      you want to be included in the event, you MUST sign up. 
                      You may send me an e-mail, or a tell in-game. But I may 
                      forget to add you. It is the attendees responsiblity to 
                      make sure they are on the list, not mine. Feel free to remind 
                      me- some people do, but the only way to guarantee a slot 
                      is to sign up on the board. </FONT></P>

                      being said, I will add people at the event itself. I give 
                      preference to Guild, then allies, then friends, then friends 
                      of friends, then strangers- in that order. I only do this 
                      when it is apparent people are not showing up. If enough

                      enough organizing and moving 20+ people without worrying 
                      about fitting someone in. On the other hand, after 2 hours 
                      or so, people start to leave. You may find it easier to 
                      get into a group at that point. </FONT></P>

                      After that, it is up to the group leader to coordinate with

                      be looted by any person, but any item must be reported to 
                      the group leader. Group leaders are to turn these items 
                      in to the raid leader. NOONE is to loot a no drop item unless

                      Every raid has one raid leader. Each group has a group leader. 
                      There is a specific chain of command. ONLY group leaders 
                      are to speak with the raid leader. If you have an issue, 
                      give it to your group leader.</FONT></P>

                      At the beginning of the raid, the protocol for assistance 
                      is called. There are two types of assist; main assist and 
                      party assist. Either the raid leader or puller will OOC 
                      what type of combat is to be used at each battle. The raid 
                      leader will designate a main assist, and the group leader 
                      will designate a group assist. You are expected to use assist 
                      keys and NOT attack keys.</FONT></P>

                      will make an effort to set up a raid that is appropriate 
                      for your level, but once the raid begins, the raid leader 
                      will not be involved in experience issues. The group leaders 
                      are expected to coordinate kills and spawns to maximize 
                      the experience for all memembers.</FONT></P>

                      The raid leader will announce the end of a raid. If it is 
                      a deep raid with significant dangers, all parties will be

                      any other person at risk. If you decide to stay, you understand 
                      that the resources of the raid may no longer be available 
                      once we leave (rezzes, ports, invis, etc.). </FONT></P>

                      you are in a group, but more than that you are a footman 
                      in the army. Monks pull, clerics rez, bards feed manna, 
                      tanks take beatings, druids buff and damage shield, etc....
