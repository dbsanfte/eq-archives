                    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">With 
                      more and more people on Prexus getting to raiding level, 
                      the planes will become more and more crowded. I would recommend 
                      all HoS in need of items from Fear or Hate attend not only 
                      all HoS raids, but use the Prexus raid calendar to get on 
                      other people's raids as well. Remember raid leaders give 
                      preference to people they know and people that work well 
                      with others and help the raid the most, so it will get easier 
                      as you go--as your personal rep spreads among the non-HoS 
                      raid leaders. Good raid ettiquette can make the difference 
                      in whether you are asked back to another raid. Remember, 
                      your conduct on a raid, or in any group, reflects on the 
                      entire guild. Here are some tips for good raid ettiquette 
                      when trying to get on a raid... When trying to get on: </FONT></P>
                    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">1) 
                      Make your request formal and polite...take some time with 
                      it. Don't just /tell a_raid_leader_00 "I want to come". 
                      Something like, "Pardon me, sir (or ma'am) I understand 
                      you are leading Hate this evening and I was wishing to offer 
                      my services." </FONT></P>
                    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">2) 
                      Never tell the raid leader in your request to join *what* 
                      you need from the plane--like, "Pardon me, can I come with 
                      you? All I need is the legs." Don't mention what you need, 
                      only that you want to come. Raid leaders get a big red flag 
                      up in their head when they see you asking about loot before 
                      you are even up there. It tells them that you might be trouble 
                      later if a drop is awarded to someone else. Raid leaders 
                      wil normally anounce the general rules for how loot is handled 
                      before the raid (class-random, merit, and exceptions included). 
                      </FONT></P>
                    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">3) 
                      Stay at the rally point (for Hate this is traditionally 
                      Sro) and stay visible. Make occasional jokes and relaxed, 
                      lighthearted comments over ooc to show the raid leader that 
                      you are still there. Don't go for long periods AFK in case 
                      you are called for a group or asked by the raid leader to 
                      go get supplies. </FONT></P>
                    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">4) 
                      Offer your help where you can: For Hate, for instance, if 
                      you are an inky, watch for someone to say they need hate 
                      stones and offer to go get them if needed. </FONT></P>
                    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">5) 
                      *Don't* pester the raid leader: Once you have put in your 
                      request, assume that the leader has your name written down. 
                      The raid leader is in tell hell when running a raid and 
                      continual requests for whether or not you have a slot can 
                      get quite irritating--even to the point of losing your spot 
                      if the leader is in an exceptionally foul mood. </FONT></P>
                    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">6) 
                      Say thanks, or be gracious: Once you hear your name called 
                      send the raid leader a simple tell saying, "Thanks!" If 
                      the raid leader finishes calling groups and you are not 
                      in the mix by that time, tell them, "No room for me?" He 
                      will likely say something to the effect of, "No, Im sorry." 
                      In this case simply say, "No worries. Good luck up there. 
                      I'll catch you next time." Raid leaders pay close attention 
                      to people's repsonses to not being picked. And if you handle 
                      yourself well, even when you don't go, you are much more 
                      likely to be on their next one. </FONT></P>
                    <P>&nbsp;</P>
                    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Once 
                      the event starts:</FONT></P>
                    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">1) 
                      Don't whine: Deaths are going to happen in the Planes, maybe 
                      several times. how you handle getting killed is important. 
                      No one wants a whiner on their raid. </FONT></P>
                    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">2) 
                      Follow orders: The raid leader's word is law on a raid. 
                      If he tells you do to something just do it, without hesitation. 
                      </FONT></P>
                    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">3) 
                      NO LOOT WHINING: Absolutely imperative. You never know what 
                      the raid leader may have done behind the scenes to make 
                      the raid happen. Let's say there is you, a level 50 rogue, 
                      and a level 47 rogue and the raid leader awards the 47 a 
                      piece of armor without even a random roll. This is the raid 
                      leader's perrogative and should never be questioned. That 
                      level 47 rogue may well actually be the wizard that ported 
                      you all up there--enticed by the raid leader to do so with 
                      the promise of the first armor drop for his rogue. This 
                      is only one of many side deals a raid leader might make 
                      to make the raid happen and get you all up there. Most commonly 
                      you will see a raid leader shout, "ClassX send me tells 
                      now for DropY!" In this case all you do is send a tell saying 
                      only, "I'm in please." nothing more. If it's not you that 
                      wins that piece, simply congradulate the winner over ooc 
                      and move on. "I'm in" and "Congradulations!" are the only 
                      thing a Phoenix should ever say about raid loot. Well, of 
                      course, "THANK YOU" is what we all want to be saying but 
                      you can't count on that. </FONT></P>
                    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">4) 
                      Never talk to the puller: The pull team is extremely busy 
                      and is pulling the plane in the fastest, safest way they 
                      can. Never request pulls. </FONT></P>
                    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">5) 
                      Never complain about drop rates. Raid leaders are hypersensitive 
                      to this. Ulitmately every raid leader wants everyone to 
                      come away with something, but that is rare (REALLY rare). 
                      Raid leaders have no control over what mobs are up there 
                      to pull, or what they drop. Even commenting over ooc, "Damn 
                      where are all the Clerics?" sets the raid leader on edge 
                      as well as the pull team. </FONT></P>
                    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">6) 
                      KSing: This is a sticky point. You don't go to the planes 
                      for exp. If exp is what you are after, Sebilis and Chardok 
                      are open 24 hours. The raid leader may have groups set up 
                      for kill speed or safety and so one group may get EVERY 
                      kill for the entire raid. Never whine about exp. And LIKEWISE, 
                      if you are in the KS team, keep it quiet. Shouting about 
                      how proud you are that your team got the kill AGAIN erodes 
                      the morale of the rest of the raid and may cause the raid 
                      leader to split up your group. </FONT></P>
                    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">7) 
                      Stay Alert: Raids can go long and the thing that kills more 
                      people than anything is someone not paying attention. One 
                      person out of position or not paying attention can wipe 
                      the raid out. Watch for orders in battle and comply with 
                      them immediately. This is especially important when you 
                      see, "Pull it back!" or "Get behind me!" Have fun, make 
                      jokes: Once the raid is rolling people will relax and start 
                      to joke around. Don't be afraid to join in. Having a good 
                      attitued and displaying that good attitude through lighthearted 
                      comments elevates the morale of the raid overall. Careful 
                      not to run at the mouth though. :</FONT></P>
                    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">8) 
                      At the end of the raid, simply thank the raid leader for 
                      having you along. Those are the basics. Do this and getting 
                      on non-guild raids will become easier and easier. </FONT></P>
                    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">9) 
                      Stay the distance: When you join a raid you have made a 
                      commitment to stay as long as you can and help everyone 
                      get their goodies. I see way too often--for example in Fear--that 
                      the MOMENT the last gorgon dies, half the druids, suddenly 
                      and simultaneously get called away because their apartment 
                      is on fire. That goes for any class. Bailing as soon as 
                      your mobs are killed will ensure you are not invited back.</FONT></P>
