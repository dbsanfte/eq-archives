The extremely high concurrency numbers that we&#39;ve seen since the game&#39;s launch have required us to double our total number of servers over a four-day period, which is much faster than we had initially planned. This caused some issues with a few servers, and some players had difficulty logging in to the game during this period. <br><br>We are determined to provide our players with the best experience possible. It is for that reason that we are extending the one-month trial-period for players who created accounts before or during the downtime. The length of the trial-period extension will be based on when the player&#39;s account was created: <br><br><li>Accounts created on November 23 will receive a 4-day extension <br><br><li>Accounts created on November 24 will receive a 3-day extension <br><br><li>Accounts created on November 25 will receive a 2-day extension <br><br><li>Accounts created on November 26 will receive a 1-day extension <br><br>Our sincere apologies go out to all who experienced service disruptions. As always, we appreciate your patience and support, and we wish you good luck in your adventures in Azeroth!<br>  <br><br></td></tr><tr><td id="boxCell">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td id="boxCell"><a href="news.php?news_id=21">1238 bytes in body</a> </td></tr></table></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="newsTable"><tr><td id="boxTitleLeft"><img src="images/new.gif" alt="New" border="0">  <a class=titleLink href="news.php?news_cat_id=10&action=view_cat">World of Warcraft</a> :  Free Trial Extension</td></tr><tr><td id="newsSubTitle">Posted by <a href=users.php?action=view&user_id=4>Ra</a> on Nov-25-2004 21:25</td></tr><tr><td id="boxCell"><img src="images/news/topicwow.gif" alt="World of Warcraft" border="0" align="left">  From Ordinn on the WoW boards:<br><hr><br>Since its release two and a half days ago, World of Warcraft has already seen incredible concurrency numbers across all active game servers. To keep up with the demand from our players, 47 new servers were made available, increasing the total number of servers to 88. Doubling our server capacity in such a short period of time created issues in existing servers. We immediately recognized the issues and began implementing fixes. However, some players were unable to log in and enjoy the game during this period. <br><br>We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience and are dedicated to providing World of Warcraft players with the best play experience possible. Therefore we&#39;ll be adding a small trial-period extension for players who created accounts before or during the downtime. In the days ahead, we&#39;ll provide additional details on how the trial-period extension will be determined. As always, we appreciate your continued patience and support; we&#39;re still monitoring the servers very closely and making adjustments as needed in order to ensure that World of Warcraft continues to run smoothly for everyone playing.<hr><br>See the full thread <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-general&t=45561&p=1&tmp=1#post45561" target=_new>here</a>.  <br><br></td></tr><tr><td id="boxCell">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td id="boxCell"><a href="news.php?news_id=20">1310 bytes in body</a> </td></tr></table></p><p>&nbsp;</p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" id="box-invis"><tr><td id=boxCell></td><td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td id="boxCell-right"><a href="news.php?action=browse">older news stories...</a></td></tr></table>        </div>
