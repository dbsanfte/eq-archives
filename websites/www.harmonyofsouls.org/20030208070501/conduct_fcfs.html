                    First Come First Served. Prexus, in general, follows a policy 
                    that allows the first force to engage a mob the rights to 
                    kill it unencumbered. You must have a force capable of killing 
                    the mob and be in the vicinity to engage it. If you do not 
                    have a force sufficient, and another group has gathered who 
                    does have a force, you should politely step aside. </P>

                      its basic level, every single engagement on Prexus is FCFS. 
                      In practice, it only applies to large scale encounters, 
                      and rare, roaming spawns. FCFS does not apply to experience 
                      camps and the nameds they generate (assuming the force doing 
                      the exp can kill the named). By definition, the exp group 
                      is already there, and can kill the named mob. If they cannot 
                      reasonably kill the named mob, it is then subject to FCFS 
                      rules. </FONT>

                        the mob Even if you sit watching a spawn for 3 days straight, 
                        you have no more right to the mob than a wandering player 
                        does. Sitting at a spawn point only gives you the advantage 
                        of information. You will be the first to know the mob 
                        has spawned. If you cannot muster your force before another 
                        guild is ready, you have lost your FCFS rights. </P>
                      <P>Kiting is not allowed to secure a mob. If you are kiting 
                        a mob without doing damage, you have absolutely no rights 
                        to it, and it can be taken from you at any time. What’s 
                        more, kiting to prevent another guild from pulling the 
                        mob is considered bad form. </P>

                        Do not interfere with another guild’s muster. Let them 
                        gather their force with as little hindrance as possible. 
                        Move into a reasonable position in the zone, but do not 
                        enter the mob’s aggro area until you have a force ready 
                        to engage. </P>
                      <P><B>Pull it or step aside </B><BR>
                        When you are ready to move on the mob, announce it to 
                        the other raid and move your troops. An honorable guild 
                        will let the first one ready to go try first. By the same 
                        token, once you announce you are moving in, do so. Engage 
                        the mob within reasonable time, or forfeit. It is perfectly 
                        fair for the prepared guild to send a message of “pull 
                        or move aside” to the competing guild. HoS will issue 
                        this twice. The third time, we will move ahead and pull 
                        the mob. </P>
                      <P>Once one guild is ready to engage, the competing guild 
                        should move out of the line of sight so as to reduce lag. 
                        If the first guild loses, they have forfeit their rights 
                        to the mob, and the waiting guild can step in and finish 
                        it off. </P>

                        Once a guild engages a mob, no other guild should interfere. 
                        Let the group live or die on their own. FFA is NOT FCFS, 
                        trying to out-damage another raid is considered bad form.

                        have to do CR to re-engage, you lose. </P>

                        If you stepped over corpses, have the courtesy to assist 
                        in the CR. Send the competing raid the status of the mob-
