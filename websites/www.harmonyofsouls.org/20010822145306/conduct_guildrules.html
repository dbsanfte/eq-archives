                    punitive retaliation against another player. In the cases 
                    of a legitimate grievance, seek the assistance of a GM. If 
                    you are not sure how to manage a situation, consult one of 
                    the Harmony officers. It is the officer's role to seek a peaceful

                    Norrath is made up of a completely mixed population men, women 
                    and children. Therefore it is improper behavior to use profanity

                    guild say and say. It is also frowned upon in tell. </font>

                    individuals that may be most bothered by these types of conversations 
                    are also unlikely to voice a protest. It is contrary to our
