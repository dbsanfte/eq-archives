<br>
<p>
"By now, I am sure you are all painfully aware of how special HoS was. What an impact we had on each other as well as the community. The reputation of HoS was built upon so many players. Some still here, many gone. But all of them sharing a level of character quality that was hard to surpass.<br><p>
I really didn’t think that HoS was so different. That we were unique. But I have had time to reflect, and I do think we were. I think HoS represented something very unusual in an environment that challenged people to do the right thing. Even when it’s hard. For those of us who have been here for years, it is an amazing history. An amazing experience. It is not something that we will quickly forget. It has been unique, in the greatest sense.<br><p> I have pained over this day for months. But now that it is here, I am very much at peace with it. HoS is going to end with dignity. With the grace that we had at our height, and be remembered that way. The band of friends that is here now represents some of my most respected mates. People I have lost a lot of sleep with and looking back, I wouldn’t trade a minute.<br><p>
I have said it in other places, and I will repeat it here. Thank you. Thank you for the trust, faith and dedication you gave me. It is something I will cherish forever. I am hoping that when you move off on your own paths, you carry the spirit of HoS with you. Live the way you have, play the way you have. You will always be HoS."<br><p>

The evening would not have been complete without a visit from our long lost favorite gnome, Bonecaster. He joined us after engaging in one of his favorite activities: pit jumping<BR><br>
