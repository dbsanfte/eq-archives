                    more and more people on Prexus getting to raiding level, the 
                    planes will become more and more crowded. I would recommend 
                    all HoS in need of items from Fear or Hate attend not only 
                    all HoS raids, but use the Prexus raid calendar to get on other 
                    people's raids as well. Remember raid leaders give preference 
                    to people they know and people that work well with others 
                    and help the raid the most, so it will get easier as you go--as 
                    your personal rep spreads among the non-HoS raid leaders. Good 
                    raid ettiquette can make the difference in whether you are 
                    asked back to another raid. Remember, your conduct on a raid, 
                    or in any group, reflects on the entire guild. Here are some 
                    tips for good raid ettiquette when trying to get on a raid... 
                    When trying to get on: </FONT></P>
                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">1) 
                    Make your request formal and polite...take some time with 
                    it. Don't just /tell a_raid_leader_00 "I want to come". Something 
                    like, "Pardon me, sir (or ma'am) I understand you are leading 
                    Hate this evening and I was wishing to offer my services." 
                    </FONT></P>
                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">2) 
                    Never tell the raid leader in your request to join *what* 
                    you need from the plane--like, "Pardon me, can I come with 
                    you? All I need is the legs." Don't mention what you need, 
                    only that you want to come. Raid leaders get a big red flag 
                    up in their head when they see you asking about loot before 
                    you are even up there. It tells them that you might be trouble 
                    later if a drop is awarded to someone else. Raid leaders wil 
                    normally anounce the general rules for how loot is handled 
                    before the raid (class-random, merit, and exceptions included). 
                    </FONT></P>
                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">3) 
                    Stay at the rally point (for Hate this is traditionally Sro) 
                    and stay visible. Make occasional jokes and relaxed, lighthearted 
                    comments over ooc to show the raid leader that you are still 
                    there. Don't go for long periods AFK in case you are called 
                    for a group or asked by the raid leader to go get supplies. 
                    </FONT></P>
                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">4) 
                    Offer your help where you can: For Hate, for instance, if 
                    you are an inky, watch for someone to say they need hate stones 
                    and offer to go get them if needed. </FONT></P>
                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">5) 
                    *Don't* pester the raid leader: Once you have put in your 
                    request, assume that the leader has your name written down. 
                    The raid leader is in tell hell when running a raid and continual 
                    requests for whether or not you have a slot can get quite 
                    irritating--even to the point of losing your spot if the leader 
                    is in an exceptionally foul mood. </FONT></P>
                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">6) 
                    Say thanks, or be gracious: Once you hear your name called 
                    send the raid leader a simple tell saying, "Thanks!" If the 
                    raid leader finishes calling groups and you are not in the 
                    mix by that time, tell them, "No room for me?" He will likely 
                    say something to the effect of, "No, Im sorry." In this case 
                    simply say, "No worries. Good luck up there. I'll catch you 
                    next time." Raid leaders pay close attention to people's repsonses 
                    to not being picked. And if you handle yourself well, even 
                    when you don't go, you are much more likely to be on their 
                    next one. </FONT></P>
                  <P>&nbsp;</P>
                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Once 
                    the event starts:</FONT></P>
                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">1) 
                    Don't whine: Deaths are going to happen in the Planes, maybe 
                    several times. how you handle getting killed is important. 
                    No one wants a whiner on their raid. </FONT></P>
                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">2) 
                    Follow orders: The raid leader's word is law on a raid. If 
                    he tells you do to something just do it, without hesitation. 
                    </FONT></P>
                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">3) 
                    NO LOOT WHINING: Absolutely imperative. You never know what 
                    the raid leader may have done behind the scenes to make the 
                    raid happen. Let's say there is you, a level 50 rogue, and 
                    a level 47 rogue and the raid leader awards the 47 a piece 
                    of armor without even a random roll. This is the raid leader's 
                    perrogative and should never be questioned. That level 47 
                    rogue may well actually be the wizard that ported you all 
                    up there--enticed by the raid leader to do so with the promise 
                    of the first armor drop for his rogue. This is only one of 
                    many side deals a raid leader might make to make the raid 
                    happen and get you all up there. Most commonly you will see 
                    a raid leader shout, "ClassX send me tells now for DropY!" 
                    In this case all you do is send a tell saying only, "I'm in 
                    please." nothing more. If it's not you that wins that piece, 
                    simply congradulate the winner over ooc and move on. "I'm 
                    in" and "Congradulations!" are the only thing a Phoenix should 
                    ever say about raid loot. Well, of course, "THANK YOU" is 
                    what we all want to be saying but you can't count on that. 
                    </FONT></P>
                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">4) 
                    Never talk to the puller: The pull team is extremely busy 
                    and is pulling the plane in the fastest, safest way they can. 
                    Never request pulls. </FONT></P>
                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">5) 
                    Never complain about drop rates. Raid leaders are hypersensitive 
                    to this. Ulitmately every raid leader wants everyone to come 
                    away with something, but that is rare (REALLY rare). Raid 
                    leaders have no control over what mobs are up there to pull, 
                    or what they drop. Even commenting over ooc, "Damn where are 
                    all the Clerics?" sets the raid leader on edge as well as 
                    the pull team. </FONT></P>
                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">6) 
                    KSing: This is a sticky point. You don't go to the planes 
                    for exp. If exp is what you are after, Sebilis and Chardok 
                    are open 24 hours. The raid leader may have groups set up 
                    for kill speed or safety and so one group may get EVERY kill 
                    for the entire raid. Never whine about exp. And LIKEWISE, 
                    if you are in the KS team, keep it quiet. Shouting about how 
                    proud you are that your team got the kill AGAIN erodes the 
                    morale of the rest of the raid and may cause the raid leader 
                    to split up your group. </FONT></P>
                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">7) 
                    Stay Alert: Raids can go long and the thing that kills more 
                    people than anything is someone not paying attention. One 
                    person out of position or not paying attention can wipe the 
                    raid out. Watch for orders in battle and comply with them 
                    immediately. This is especially important when you see, "Pull 
                    it back!" or "Get behind me!" Have fun, make jokes: Once the 
                    raid is rolling people will relax and start to joke around. 
                    Don't be afraid to join in. Having a good attitued and displaying 
                    that good attitude through lighthearted comments elevates 
                    the morale of the raid overall. Careful not to run at the 
                    mouth though. :</FONT></P>
                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">8) 
                    At the end of the raid, simply thank the raid leader for having 
                    you along. Those are the basics. Do this and getting on non-guild 
                    raids will become easier and easier. </FONT></P>
                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" COLOR="#FFFFFF">9) 
                    Stay the distance: When you join a raid you have made a commitment 
                    to stay as long as you can and help everyone get their goodies. 
                    I see way too often--for example in Fear--that the MOMENT 
                    the last gorgon dies, half the druids, suddenly and simultaneously 
                    get called away because their apartment is on fire. That goes 
                    for any class. Bailing as soon as your mobs are killed will 
                    ensure you are not invited back. </FONT></P>
