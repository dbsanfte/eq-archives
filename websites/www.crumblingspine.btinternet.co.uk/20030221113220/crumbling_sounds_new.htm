<p>Otley Labour Club<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="1"><span style="font-weight: 400">This was a riotous 
affair played on home territory with lots of friends and beers present.<br>
We hired the Labour Club out for the evening, and by the time we came on stage, 
just about everybody was out off their head in some way or other. That is with 
the exception of our front man Andy, who was running round like Norman Wisdom on 
speed, with two foot lengths of toilet paper hanging from each ear, shouting 
&quot;sheep&quot; and wailing Elvis songs.<br>
Goaded on by the Otley crowd, Jellyman gave a rare and blistering performance of 
'A Real Man in Action' <br>
Also playing that evening were Vibracathedral Orchestra and Ronald Arthur 
Dewhirst. </span></font></p>

<p>The Packhorse, Leeds<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="1"><span style="font-weight: 400">A much more 
deliberated and controlled performance, which added to it's intensity.<br>
Performed in darkness, with light coming from a gloomy video backdrop and a 
single halogen.<br>
Thriving under these conditions, Andy delivered a mesmerising message about the 
darker side of the human condition entitled 'Waste', against a stark and 
atmospheric sonic backdrop.</span></font></p>
