Many of you know this person, this Cett MorCellan. He has long aspired to be the Royal Court Jester, but had herefore been unable to procure that fabled Norrathian relic known as the "Kobol Jester's Crown". Since this item is the only recognized symbol of office, he had been content to be only a "future" Jester. As of this day, let all Knights rejoice, for Sir MorCellan does in fact possess the relic he has so often sought. As such, by the power vested in me, as a member of the High Council, I do hereby promote Sir MorCellan to Royal Court Jester, with all priviledges that such rank infers from this day forward. May the floppy hat forever grace your head and may the apple throwing begin.<br /><br />Wanawanda Goretusk<br />Jester Tormentor Extraordinaire<br>ooc Also, he got his Jester's Cap delivered to him in real life, which was also an amusing event, and Cett, change your sig, ya got the floppy hat with bells, both in game and out. =)<br><br></font></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><font class="pn-normal">This article comes from Knights of Luclin<br><a class="pn-normal" href="http://www.knightsofluclin.org">http://www.knightsofluclin.org</a><br><br>The URL for this story is:<br><a class="pn-normal" href="http://www.knightsofluclin.org/article.php?sid=30">http://www.knightsofluclin.org/article.php?sid=30</a></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></center></body></html>
