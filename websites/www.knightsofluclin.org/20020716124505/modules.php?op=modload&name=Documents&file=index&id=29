				</table><BR><b><u>Raid Procedures</u></b><br>
<br>
Please understand that a raid must be very rigidly structured to succeed. Discipline and patience are necessary, as you may have to wait for long periods of time, even hours, without taking any action. It is also very important that you listen to the raid leader and do exactly as they say, without any hesitation. Raids should work out like a military exercise. We're not saying don't have fun, but we are warning you that if anyone behaves carelessly or recklessly they may be asked to leave the raid immediately. It only takes one accidental pull or silly error to turn a raid into a five-hour corpse recovery mission.<br>
<br>
When you are at a raid, expect to sit bored for long periods of time. Don't think about loot, and don't think about experience, as these things are never guaranteed. It's a good idea if you come into a raid expecting to lose experience, that way you won't be disappointed when it happens, and you can be pleasantly surprised if everything goes well.<br>
<br>
All raids and events are announced in the message of the day at login, as well as being sent to your characters via the mailing lists on the website. Please check out the raid calendar on the website on a weekly basis. Most raids will take place on weekends.<br>
<br>
Our guild has a habit of forming totally impromptu groups of between six and eighteen players at a moments notice to just go out and raid something, complete a quest, or spend a night grinding away at leveling. These aren't formal raids; so don't feel you've been left out. If something like this is happening you'll know over guild chat. A good sign is seeing six or more knights in the same zone. If you are within the level range to join them, feel free to ask, but don't expect them to halt their activities to get you there once they are well underway.<br>
<br>
<u>Raid Calendars</u><br>
<br>
KoL honors the server-wide raid calendar at www.luclin.com. There are raid calendars there that allow the reservation of everything from spawns to zones to planes for specific guilds or open raids. If we wish to run a raid, it must be accepted on the calendar. If another guild already has the zone we want reserved, we will reschedule our raid accordingly. The officers will handle this. We do not care that Verant does not officially recognize raid calendars. The vast majority of the server does, and so we must.<br>
<br>
There are a few guilds that do not recognize the raid calendar. In the event that we have a run in with claim jumpers, the officers will mediate a settlement with a GM present if necessary. Please respect the final decision regarding the raid. We have little tolerance in general for behavior that shows this level of lack of consideration, and we are not above taking the raid by force if it is necessary and we feel we have been done an injustice.<br>
<br>
<u>Running a Raid</u><br>
<br>
Anyone can run a raid on KoL. Simply read all of the guidelines below and understand them. If you want to run a raid you will be filling the role of the raid leader as described below. Formulate your plans and then have a meeting with the officers, and they will decide if they want to go through with it, and when.<br>
<br>
<u>Arrival and Departure</u><br>
<br>
Please do your best to get to the raid location before the event actually starts. It's a good idea to attempt to be there thirty minutes early. Ports to the raid location will begin one full hour before the event starts. Once the event is over, we will transport you to any set of spires or rings you choose. Late arrivals will not be given ports if the event is underway. If you are late you must arrive under your own power.<br>
<br>
<u>Raid Loot Rules</u><br>
<br>
A designated Master Looter will collect all loot. Only the person designated as the master looter will be allowed to loot anything from the corpses. The Master Looter may choose to allow others to loot corpses, but all such decisions must go through the master looter. Anyone who is ever caught ninja-looting corpses or attempting to steal loot will be ejected from the raid and almost certainly from the guild. We have a zero tolerance policy for thieves. Don't even think for a moment you can get away with it, we can and will petition GMs, they will tell us exactly who looted what and at what time. That's one area where you can count on Verant's customer service. GMs will not require you to return stolen items, but they will tell us who has done it. Their logs are very thorough. And don't even try to tell us it was accidental. Turn your ability to loot off in options before you go on these raids.<br>
<br>
All loot that is garnered from the raid will be split up by the officers and handed out to the people who can benefit the most from it. Please understand that even in a big raid on a plane like hate, 10 high level items may drop at most. There are going to be 50+ people on the raid. This means that only 10 of them can get items. We are making a policy that only officers can decide who gets the loot, otherwise the greed and anarchy that follows will cause a lot of hard feelings and kill morale. The officers will take all the heat for their decisions. If you feel that you have been slighted, let an officer know about it immediately. At the very least we will always provide satisfactory explanations as to why loot is split up the way it is.<br>
<br>
Some raids may incur very high expenses to operate. These expenses come from coffins for recovery, gems for spells and for transportation to raids on the planes, and many other annoying facets of raid management. The cost of the raid will be taken from the platinum and gems looted to reimburse those who financed the raid. All the rest will go to the guild members, or possibly into the guild treasury if we ever see fit to start one. It costs 250pp for the gems needed to port a single party into the planes. A stack of 20 Peridots so your clerics can buff you costs 240pp.<br>
<br>
On other raids where there is no need for master looting (mainly on zone and xp raids) the loot will be divided amongst the groups as governed by the Need Before Greed policy outlined above for standard guild grouping.<br>
<br>
<u>Types of Raids</u><br>
<br>
<b>Experience Raids:</b> These raids are usually set in any given zone and a level range of players who can attend is assigned. If you are not within this range, it means that the zone is too tough for you. Attending it at a lower level than recommended is certain death. During these raids, our higher-level members will be there to buff groups, pull MoBs for them, and generally help them level. We may power level certain individuals in certain circumstances. This arrangement is entirely between the power leveler and the power levelee. Loot for these raids is free for all, need before greed. The purpose of this raid is to get as many dings as possible during the raid.<br>
<br>
<b>Zone Raids:</b> These raids target a certain zone. There may be many reasons such as good loot, good experience, or just that it's a fun zone to bust up. Experience is not guaranteed on these raids but it usually happens. Loot rules may be free for all and need before greed, or there may be certain items in the zone we want for certain people. If this is the case, loot normally unless one of the specific items is discovered, in which case please make sure the one who needed it gets it.<br>
<br>
<b>Quest Raids:</b> The purpose of this raid is to either complete a specific quest or obtain quest items for certain people. All epic quests will need several of these kinds of raids. You are not guaranteed any loot or experience from these raids, and they can be quite a pain at times, involving long waiting and buffing periods. The purpose of these raids is always to get a specific person an item for a quest, although it may be more general, such as camping an epic item for all players of a certain class to get as many quests accomplished as possible. If you are not of that class or not that player, expect the pickings to be slim. Please attend and help out, one day we will be doing this raid in your honor and your service to others will not be forgotten.<br>
<br>
<b>Planes, Gods, and other high level raids:</b> These raids are an order of magnitude tougher than any others. The rewards are very great, and the risk is equally high. Expect to die several times on these raids. You will die at least once, guaranteed. We'll get you rezzes but you will have less xp going out than you did coming in. These raids are conducted with military coordination and precision, as one wrong move can easily wipe out an entire guild. Be at least ten times as serious on these raids as you are on any other. Understand every aspect of your character and how to use him expertly in a group before coming on these raids, there is no room for dead weight. Be aware that these raids can be very, very lengthy and highly specialized. <br>
<br>
For example, on the plane of air, there are seven islands.  Half the plane takes a full day of playtime (roughly four to five hours) to clear. If the guild does this raid, your characters will be online in PoA for two to three consecutive real life days in a row, a few hours each day. There is no way to leave and come back to where you were. Another example, Veeshan's Peak, is a zone with many powerful dragons. It has some of the best loot in the game. The caveat is that not only do you need a key to get in, but also once inside you are bound there and no spells (gate, teleport) can get you out. The only way out is to clear the entire zone of MoBs or jump off the platform. These are extreme examples, but they help illustrate our point. These raids are not for the faint of heart.<br>
<br>
<b>Guild Events:</b> These are where we get to have fun and show off. Drunken newbie runs through Kelethin, silly parties with gnomish fireworks, guild treks across Norrath, bachelor parties, and just about any crazy idea our members can come up with are fair game here. These are strictly social events, just show up and have fun.<br>
<br>
<b>Fight Club:</b> Usually held on the second Sunday of every month, everyone goes to the Arena in Lake Rathe for an insane day of dueling and beating each other into the dirt. Any social guild conflicts are resolved here in duels. You may be asked to fight to defend your honor, rise to the challenge like a true knight. Everyone is encouraged to bring something fun.<br>
<br>
<b><u>Nightly Guild Activities:</u></b> The majority of our players are online around 8pm EST. Between the hours of 7pm and 8pm EST is when we usually decide what we want to do for the night, be it questing, level grinding, or spur-of-the-moment raids. If you want to participate in these activities please try to be online by 8pm EST. It's best for a guild to have a normal time assignment for setting up evening activities so that we have a base time to plan from; this is ours.<br>
<br>
<b><u>Raid Organization</u></b><br>
<br>
In any large, organized raid there will be several guild members assigned to handle the different tasks of a raid. Here is a description of some of the more basic raid roles.<br>
<br>
<b>Raid Leader:</b> The raid leader is the person responsible for the majority of the work that is done for the raid. Raid leaders must research all information necessary to accomplish their objective and then formulate a plan for everyone at the raid to follow that will ensure success. The raid leader assigns all other roles for the raid. During any raid, the raid leader is to be obeyed without question. Anything they tell you to do, you should do. The success or failure of the raid primarily depends on their ability to formulate a strategy and coordinate the actions of the guild to follow through on it.<br>
<br>
<b>Main Assist:</b> There will be one person who is in charge of determining what gets attacked from the monsters pulled. This is the main assist. During a raid encounter, you will attack only the creature that the main assist is attacking and nothing else unless expressly told to do so. The main assist will likely have the finest support group in the raid, and it's very likely the Master Puller will be in his group, as well as the Raid Leader. You never attack any creature until after the Main Assist attacks it first. Give him a few seconds to build up his hate before joining in on the battle. When getting ready to attack a mesmerized creature, wait until the Main Assist breaks the mez. He will need time to build hate so the creature doesn't instantly kill the enchanter who mesmerized it.<br>
<br>
<b>Master Puller:</b> Someone has to go out into the zone and carefully choose what monsters can be brought back to the groups safely. The Master Puller holds the sole decision making power on what MoBs are to be pulled, how many, and in what order. Do not attack any MoBs attacking the Master Puller unless told to do so. The Main Assist will choose his target from the MoBs that the puller brings and that is the one to attack. Master Pullers are usually Monks, but may be anyone with an excellent ability to pull. The Master Puller may at times consist of a two-person team in the event that chain pulling is necessary to split the MoBs successfully.<br>
<br>
<b>Master Looter:</b> When something drops, he loots it. No exceptions. The Master Looter will hold all high level items until the end of the raid. He will also be responsible for keeping track of what drops, and deciding whom to give what loot to when more normal loot drops. The Master Looter may delegate this responsibility to group leaders or other raid attendees at his discretion.<br>
<br>
<b>Damage Control:</b> There will likely be one group on large raids designated the Damage Control group. It is their job to handle anything unexpected. If a wandering MoB joins the fight, their job is to control it until the rest of the guild can deal with it. They are responsible for keeping an eye on things and making sure everything goes well.<br>
<br>
<b>Buff Groups:</b> If we have the need for extreme buffing before fighting a MoB (a god or dragon for example) we will form a group called the Buff Group. Each person on the raid will join them and get buffed to the hilt, then camp out and meet in the chat channels. If you are part of a group, make sure that all of your group members camp near each other so that it is easier to reform groups once you log back in.<br>
<br>
<b>Group Leaders:</b> Group leaders are responsible for the actions of everyone in their group at raids. Group leaders should keep group members apprised of what is going on and if they have any questions about it themselves they should ask the raid leader immediately. Group leaders are responsible for making sure their groups work efficiently as a team. Make sure the buffs are up when necessary, and if anyone goes link dead, /shout it immediately. If the raid leader asks questions such as "Is everyone buffed" or "Are we ready" the group leaders are expected to answer for their entire group.<br>
<br>
<u><b>Everyone Else:</b></u> Everyone else will form into groups as designated by the Raid Leader. Most of the time you will be sitting in safe areas buffing and killing. Some of the time you will simply be waiting (for hours on some occasions) for things to happen. Don't run around and cause trouble or you will be asked to leave the raid. Be patient. Don't think about loot or items, just focus on the objective at hand.<br>
<br>
<u><b>Chat Channels:</b></u> Only the Leader, Assist, Pullers, and Damage Control members are allowed to use the /shout channel during a raid. Everyone else must use /ooc. Anyone may use guild chat. This is simply to make sure that the important messages stand out more; when you see a shout you know it has important information. Please, try to keep things on topic. Raids that degenerate into chaos usually do so because everyone gets so caught up in chatting that they forget to pay attention to what is really going on.<br>
<br>
<u><b>Everquest Chat:</b></u> It may be necessary on some large raids for everyone to camp out of the game after being buffed. This has the advantage of allowing everyone in game to buff up and log out so that once everyone has been buffed, we can all log in at the same time and get the most usefulness out of the buffs. It may also be necessary for everyone to camp out (especially clerics) to avoid getting killed by bad trains. The Everquest chat channels will be where we meet when raiding and camped out. Look for a channel called "KoL-RaidName" there and join the channel. If a server crash occurs, it is imperative that we meet in chat immediately to decide what to do about it.<br>
<br>
<u><b>Camping Out:</b></u> If the raid leader shouts out "everyone camp" first defend all of the clerics to make absolutely certain that they camp out. If you have to die to make sure they get out, do it. Once the clerics are out, everyone else may camp. Meet in the Everquest chat channel and wait while our scouters recover corpses and bring them to a safe location. Once we're safe again, everyone log in and we will wait for the clerics to get everyone else rezzed. This tactic is absolutely necessary if something goes wrong in the planes. Do not run away and get yourself lost if the raid is getting wiped out. If you go far out it may make it impossible to recover your corpse.<br>
<br>
<u><b>Pets on Raids:</b></u> On some raids, pets are vital for success. On others, even one single pet can spell certain death for the entire raid party. Never, ever, under any circumstances, summon pets on a raid unless you are instructed to do so by the raid leader. Do not use your own judgment on this. Always talk to the raid leader first. This includes charming monsters to use as pets.<br>
<br>
<u><b>If you Accidentally Pull Something:</b></u> Hopefully, it's only one small MoB and not the God of Fear you ticked off. Either way, chances are very good that in most cases the raid party will be involved with something else and unable to help you. If you're lucky, the damage control group can handle it. If not, you are expected to do anything necessary to keep that creature from attacking the raid party if they can't handle it. If this means you have to run away from the raid, taking the MoB with you, and die, so be it. It's easier to resurrect you than it is to recover the corpses of everyone on the raid and start the whole thing over from scratch. Also, your chances of being allowed on future raids if you do something this foolish are fairly poor, especially if you develop a history of reckless raid behavior.<br>
<br>
<u><b>If you hear "Move it BACK!":</b></u> Do it. There are a hundred occasions when fighting a creature against a wall or near uncleared areas of the zone can cause trouble. If it's a 50+ creature and it falls in a pit, for example, it will summon people down one at a time and kill them. If it is backed up against a wall and there are creatures on the other side, you can expect a train to follow. If someone shouts for the creature to be backed up, everyone should move backwards immediately. If even one person stays, the creature probably will as well. We will simply wait while it kills the unfortunate who cannot follow orders, and then runs over his corpse back to where the rest of the group is waiting. This is serious business.<br>
<br>
<u><b>Proper Assisting:</b></u> When you find out who the Main Assist is, you are <b>rigidly required</b> to make a hotkey that contains the command /assist playername. This is absolutely essential on raids. There's very little chance you'll be clicking on the creature you're about to fight because your framerate will be low, your lag with be very high, and there will be twenty players between you and your enemy. The only way to guarantee you can get on the right foe is with an assist key. This factor can generate incredible amounts of trouble and it is so easy to avoid if everyone simply makes a key. The key should /assist the Main Assist, not the puller as in a normal group. If you are having trouble assisting often or break the mez on a MoB because you didn't do this you will find yourself in a great deal of trouble. In the event that there is a Secondary Assist present on the raid you are required to make a button for them as well.<br>
