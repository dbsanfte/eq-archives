			<h4>We are a guild of friends who are loosely organized so we can have fun while we play. Hey, most of us have enough stress in real life! We pay to play this game to relax and have some fun! We try to maintain a family type attitude with each other and would ask you do the same. Do not use any fool lanague<br>

				<br>
			</h4>
			<h4>We all help each other with game mechanics and leveling. This doesn&#x2019;t mean that we will do everything for you. If you want something, show some initiative.<br>

				<br>
			</h4>
			<h4>We will have leaders for Raids and Quests. Lets face it, it is impossible for many characters to achieve a single goal without leadership. Try to cooperate with them.<br>

			</h4>
			<h4>We have officers to maintain stability in the guild. Remember, they were chosen because they have demonstrated that they are leaders, have wisdom, and follow the guild policies to the best of their ability. <br>
