		<p>Hello all, on this side you find a new Forum for a small test. I want to now how it works and how you like it. I found 1 possible problem but im not sure that it happens for all members. At the end of the Forum page you see the topics. When you see a denied message in this part of the Forum pls click again on the forum folder called Sacred Knights of Hearts. After this you normaly can see all postings. There are still some German words on this side but that is nothin you need for Forum so i think it will be ok.</p>
