			<h2>Raid &amp; Event Rules<br>
			</h2>
			<h3>These guidelines will encompass how SKOH members are expected to act on raids and events. Understanding and remembering these guidelines are essential to raids, events and operations for maintaining an environment that is equitable to everyone involved. Remember, you are an ambassador of our guild.<br>
			</h3>
			<h3>There are 3 categories for our activities:<br>
			</h3>
			<h3>1. Official Guild Raids/Events<br>
			</h3>
			<h3>2. Quad/Multi-Guild Raids/Events<br>
			</h3>
			<h3>3. Raids/Events:<br>
			</h3>
			<h3>Pre-Raid/Event Guidelines:<br>
			</h3>
			<h3>1. Check the Forums: Make sure you know the time and place of the Raid/Event in question, what the it is about and the staging area where everyone will be waiting.<br>
			</h3>
			<h3>2. Background Check: Use the links and other information provided in our forums to read about the Zone. What notable mobs there are, what resists are good, what drops and by whom, mob vulnerabilities, strategy and most importantly: the Target MOB(s)/Loot.<br>
			</h3>
			<h3>3. Inventory Prep: A some point in your EQ day, before the raid/event, go to town and bank. Pick up any resist gear you need, have at least 1 to 3 full stacks of food and water, buy all the spell components you need, arrows or throwing weapons and extra peridots for the clerics/enchanters.<br>
			</h3>
			<h3>4. Locomotion: If you can't get to the raid/event yourself and need a pickup, make sure that you are at Wizard Spire or Druid Ring. Pay attention to other members who also need transportation and try to gather in as few locations as possible. For Quad/Multi-Guild Raids/Events, a point of contact will be provided so you can get this necessary information in the event none of our Guilds porters will be attending.<br>
			</h3>
			<h3>5. Configuration: Change your settings to keep lag and battle spam down. It&#x2019;s imperative that you be able to read guild/shout/OOC/Auction instructions during combat. We recommend the following actions if you have any problems with either lag or spam:<br>
			</h3>
			<h3>Turn your Luclin Textures to low and off &amp; Reboot.Others getting hit - offTurn your Clipping Plane down.Others hits - off/particledensity offBard songs - off/showspell offNPC spells - on/serverfilter onPC spells - groupMy misses - offOthers misses - offPC names - offDamage shield - off6. Assistance: Find out who the Main Assist and Secondary Assist are and make assist keys. If this information is not known, make the keys and fill in the information at the staging area. For Quad/Multi-Guild Raids, this information will be provided by your point of contact.<br>
			</h3>
			<h3>7. Etiquette: Be in place, on time. We cannot overstress this: make every possible effort to be in place, on time.<br>
			</h3>
			<h3>8. Rock n' roll: Be patient. You have done your part and it's now up to the Raid Leader, Captains and Group Leaders to do theirs. Wait patiently and pay attention.<br>
				<br>
			</h3>
			<h3>Raid/Event Guidelines:<br>
			</h3>
			<h3>1. The Big Boys: Know who your leaders are. Things will sometimes change during the course of the raid/event. Make sure you know who the Raid Leader is, his designated Captains (those who will be calling out Loot Drops, Groupmate designation, etc.), Main Tank/Assist and Secondary Assist, Primary Healer, Pullers, etc. Set your pride aside and be prepared to take instruction.<br>
			</h3>
			<h3>2. Grouping: The Raid Leader or a designated Group Captain will call out for class and levels. Make sure you have removed /Anon and /Role. Groups will then be formed by numbers. The first person named in a Group will be Group Leader and provide all group invites. Know your Group Number. If there is a problem with your group due to class/level combinations or other issues, send a /Tell to your Group Leader to discuss it. The Group Leader will contact the Group Captain for more information. Please be patient, considerate and understanding. You will not always get grouped with the people you want to be grouped with or get grouped in an optimal group. Do your best to do your part and have fun, considerations will always be made when possible.<br>
			</h3>
			<h3>3. Communication: Everyone has to know what's going on. Communication will be handled as follows on all Open/Quad/Multi-Guild Raids/Events. Please keep in mind to pay attention so you don't miss anything during the downtime at the staging area and be ready to go when its time to move out. Follow Directions explicitly: Raid channel or any other channel will be set by Raid Leaders.<br>
			</h3>
			<h3>Tell should be used to let the appropriate individual know you need a particular buff or series of buffs. Issues/Problems/Tell to the Group Leader who will handle the issue or relay information to the Raid Leader or Designated Associate/guUsed to speak to guild mates. Should be used exclusively on a SKOH Only raid in order to keep Zone spam down.<br>
			</h3>
			<h3>4. Experience: Raids/Events are rarely for experience.  Since the objective is to keep casualties to a minimum while working towards a common goal or series of goals, balancing groups to get experience versus balancing groups for survivability will not be considered. We want to achieve our objectives without causing the loss of too many live's.<br>
			</h3>
			<h3>5. When MOB's Attack: Make sure you are Assisting the Main Tank/Assist or Secondary Assist and have the correct MOB targeted. If there is a forced switch, be sure to re-determine your target and /assist again. Casters should be in the back unless being in melee range is required to damage the MOB with spells. If an Add occurs, a single /auction or /ooc should be all that is necessary to make sure someone is alerted to its presence. Make sure all Debuffs, Mezzes, Charms, Dispells, Entanglements are called properly so everyone knows the MOB's status Most importantly: everyone should hold off attacking until the Raid Leader directs them to do so or the Main Tank/Assist or Secondary Assist call for assistance after they have built up sufficient Aggro. <br>
			</h3>
			<h3>6. The Witch is Dead: The designated Loot Captain should be the only one looting. Loot will be called in /acution or /ooc. NO DROP loot should be left on the MOB so the Loot Captain can either hold the MOB or designate someone to do so. Make sure you know the Loot Rules so you are not confused as to what is going to happen with the loot. Do not loot until the Loot Captain has expressly told you to do so. Do not loot anything except the specific object you have been told to loot. If the loot was misscalled or a mistake was made, inform the Loot Captain. If you are unhappy with how the loot was distributed, talk to your Group Leader and remain polite and considerate. It may be too late to do anything about it, but know that your comments will be remembered for next time. On random MOB drops along the way to the Main Target MOB(s)/Loot, the Group Leaders should do all looting. Loot worthy of note will be distributed by the Group Leader and/or Raid Leader. Loot that is not NO DROP will either be distributed at this point or held until it can be distributed later, based on the Loot Rules.<br>
			</h3>
			<h3>7. Wipeout: In the event of a wipeout, be patient and considerate. Organizing resurrections and corpse recoveries can be a daunting task. Make sure you /consent to whoever is in charge of actually moving corpses to a safe area. Details on who will be doing this will be in /shout or /auction or /tells. Your corpse is important and do not doubt that someone is attempting to recover it. Be ready to accept that rez the moment it appears on your screen. Mana is always a premium after rezzes and rebuffs so be patient. Wipeouts will seriously affect raid momentum so continue to pay attention and be ready to move again as quickly as possible.<br>
			</h3>
			<h3>8. All good things: Calling the end to a raid, especially one that has not met all of its objectives is not easy. Please do not complain, argue or comment out of line when the Raid Leader calls the end of the raid. Along the same lines, if individuals must leave before a raid is over -- do not hold that against them. We all have lives away from EQ. Now is the time to take as many people as possible with you if you are a porter and get them to a safe area or translocate individuals if you are a wizard. The Last Group to leave should always contain at least 1 cleric, 2 melee's and someone who can port or evac. We want to make sure no one is left behind and provide cover for the wizard who stayed late to do the final translocates out before taking the Last Group to a safe spot in case re-pops or wandering MOB's come to visit. In some cases, the Kill Group should additionally stay behind with at least one of it's members capable of providing an evac.<br>
