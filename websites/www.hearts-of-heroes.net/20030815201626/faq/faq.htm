<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><a name="1">1</a>: What's up with Hearts of Heroes
anyway?</font><font color="#00FF00"><br>
&nbsp;Hearts of Heroes was formed in February of 2002 when a number of members
of another large guild began coming to terms with difficulties and tensions
present within.&nbsp; The decision was made to spawn a new Guild built on
principles and ethics of the highest order. Please take a look at the Guild's <a href="../charter/charter.htm">Charter</a>
and see what these principles and policies entail.&nbsp; We seek only </font><font color="#00FF00">to
play EQ with integrity and honor, and have a good deal of fun in the process.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0"><a name="2">2:</a>: How big is this Guild?<br>
</font><font color="#00FF00">Hearts of Heroes is currently a small guild
consisting of approximately 50 characters.&nbsp; Our roster will show you
exactly who and how many belong to our Guild family, so check back and watch us
grow!</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><a name="3">3</a>: Why should I join Hearts of Heroes
instead of another, bigger Guild?<br>
</font><font color="#00FF00">Huge and Uber Guilds offer their advantages ~and~
disadvantages.&nbsp; Weigh carefully what your expectations are from a Guild and
research it thoroughly before choosing.&nbsp; A wrong choice can lead to frustration
and disillusionment&nbsp; Hearts of Heroes stands for quality before quantity,
for success through honest effort, and for caring for others.&nbsp; We foster a
family type relation within the guild.&nbsp; Members look out for each other and
help out to the best of our ability.</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;<a name="4">4</a>: What must I do to become a member?</font><font color="#00FF00"><br>
Seek out an officer.&nbsp; Do a &quot;/who all Hearts&quot; to find a member and
simply state your desire or interest.&nbsp; Someone from the guild will put you
in touch with an officer.&nbsp; The officer will likely ask you some down to
earth questions and may well wish to observe&nbsp; you fight with one of our
groups to observe your methods.&nbsp; There are no character restrictions in
place to join Hearts of Heroes, but we seek to accept members who are skillful in
both game-play and </font><font color="#00FF00">in getting along as a team
member.</font></p>
<p align="right"><font color="#00FF00">[<a href="#top">Top</a>]</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><a name="5">5</a>: Do you class-balance this Guild?
</font><font color="#00FF00"><br>
No, there are no class, race, or level requirements.&nbsp; Your main and alts
are all welcome regardless of their types.&nbsp; Note that during a Raid, you
may be asked to balance a group if you have an especially needed alt available.</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><a name="6:">6:</a> How do I find out about Guild

</font><font color="#00FF00">Guild events are announced in advance using the
Guild Message of the Day (type &quot;/guildmotd&quot; ) and on our Webiste's <a href="../calendar/calendar.html">
Calendar of Events</a>.&nbsp; Sometimes, in-game Word-of-Mouth is also in progress
if something special is in progress (i.e. a GM event).&nbsp; E-mail notification
of special events is possible, but not set up at this time.</font></p>
