                  death (flatulance) from saxonn on moes head, (revenge is sweet 
                  (or foul) i guess) we had a blast. Our only regret was that 
                  we didnt have time to go see everyone in the guild. (actually 
                  fuck that, one more second in that car i would have killed myself) 
                  Note: when in a car with saxonn, place him by a window so he
