<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000040">I play RPG online these days,<br>
  RPG, you know, role-playing games.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dungeons and Dragons,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wizards and warriors,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knights and necromancers,<br>
  Elves, and dwarves, and trolls, and humans,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; battling monsters, giant spiders, and the undead,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sometimes side-by-side,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sometimes toe-to-toe.<br>
  <br>
  I'm living in the midst<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of a legend, a fairy tale,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more complex, more fantastic<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than any of the many<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I devoured as a child.<br>
  In this world of magic and heroes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not all the races are human,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so some folk have pointy ears and golden skin and can
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; see in the dark,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while others are 7 feet tall and have steel-blue eyes
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and blonde flowing locks.<br>
  But we all share a thirst for justice and knowledge,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are all involved in the universal struggle<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of Good vs. Evil.<br>
  And what counts is not what divides us,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but rather, what side are you on?<br>
  <br>
  And I, Guerilla, level 5 Paladin,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; roam the forested hills<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and haunt the dusky taverns<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with my rusty bastard sword<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and my trusty brass buckler,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; looking for kindred spirits<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who will watch my back<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as I offer them aid and encouragement.<br>
  <br>
  But, until I find them,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I travel alone<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seeking to grow ever stronger and wiser<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so that I may be worthy of strong and wise
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  companions.<br>
  I toil ceaselessly in the killing fields<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so that I may add to my modest store of<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; silver and gold,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; food and drink,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; armor and weapons,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in short, my all-important stuff.<br>
  <br>
  I move further and further away<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from that ignominious day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when I was born,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like some kind of clone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an adult in size and stature,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but ignorant and defenseless,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no money in my pockets and no boots on my feet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vulnerable to the bite of the weakest snake or rat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and stone dead in seconds<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; against mightier foes who ambush me in the dark.<br>
  <br>
  Sometimes I take a break from all this killing and being killed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to query innkeepers, merchants, and temple guardians<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who were set on my path<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to help me find<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arcane spells and magical helmets,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amulets of invisibility and rings of invulnerability,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weapons of great power and unerring accuracy.<br>
  I seek just the right words for my questions,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; words that will unlock their mouths<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and let them reveal to me my next quest.<br>
  Then I puzzle over their answers<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wondering how in the world<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they might mean anything of significance.<br>
  <br>
  But the most fun of all<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is playing alongside<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the alter egos of my fellow gamers.<br>
  We try to get into the fantasy aspects of our characters,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; saying corny things to each other like,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Hail all ye brave soldiers of fortune,&quot; and<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Where might a weary traveler find an inn in this fair
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; town?&quot; and<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;May the gods grant thee gentle breezes and bless all
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thy ventures.&quot;<br>
  Most of the time, though,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we communicate like the 21st century geeks<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (translation - young white computer nerds) that we are,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Hey, dude, wazzup?&quot; and<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Let's go kill us some critters,&quot;<br>
  and, most frequently, &quot;HELP!&quot;<br>
  <br>
  What most amazes me about the game is<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how often my online comrades respond<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to my cries and the cries of others for assistance.<br>
  For no immediately discernible reason,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for I know it keeps them from their own quests,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they stop to explain the rules,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; show me the way through the maze,<br>
  heal me with a therapeutic touch from afar,<br>
  give me possessions just because I asked.<br>
  And I know this is quite macabre,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but when I die,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they help me find my corpse.<br>
  Somehow there's nothing quite as satisfying<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as reuniting with my empty shell<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and recouping all my worldly goods.<br>
  <br>
  The last time a stranger helped me<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; find my way out of the dungeon<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when I was helplessly lost<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and surrounded by merciless enemies without number,<br>
  I thanked him<br>
  and offered a few pieces of silver as a reward.<br>
  He merely replied,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No problem. I was helped out of there<br>
  3 or 4 times myself before I learned my way around. &quot;<br>
  He asked me to pass on the favor when I could<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and I promised to do so.<br>
  <br>
  If only the quote-unquote Real World<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; worked like my fantasy world.<br>
  Would that the dangers were so clear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the evils so obvious,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that we would all join hands to conquer them,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forgetting our race and class differences,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remembering only that the strongest party includes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doers and thinkers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fighters and lovers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; teachers and learners,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leaders and followers.<br>
  Or, would that the quote-unquote Real World<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suddenly disappeared on day as we were all online<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and we played together,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all day and all night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; watching the sun rise and set,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the seasons change,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and kingdoms rise and fall,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forever and ever amen.</font></p>
