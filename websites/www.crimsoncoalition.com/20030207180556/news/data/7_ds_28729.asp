							The Associated Press<br><br><br>COLUMBIA, S.C.<p class="nitfp">After being accused of dithering over his military commitment, Gov. Mark Sanford said Tuesday he will ship out with his Air Force Reserve unit if it is deployed.</p>
<p class="nitfp">"The bottom line for me is that I made a commitment and I am going to keep it," the freshman governor said in a letter to Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer. "Therefore, as to any orders I receive I will do just as anyone else in my unit and follow them."</p>
<p class="nitfp">Sanford, a Republican, was commissioned last January as a 1st lieutenant in the 315th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron stationed at Charleston Air Force Base. He says he joined because he came to admire military service during his three terms in the U.S. House and wanted to provide an example to his four young sons.</p>
<p class="nitfp">But Sanford, 42, said recently he couldn't deploy if his squadron was called because he is governor and even suggested he might resign his commission.</p>
<p class="nitfp">That generated a flurry of criticism from people who accused Sanford of joining the reserves as a campaign ploy. One critic writing to a newspaper called the commission "resume padding."</p>
<p class="nitfp">Sanford has said he was not considering a gubernatorial bid when he joined the reserves.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Bauer has long maintained he would step in as governor if Sanford is called.</p>
<p class="nitfp">"If he's called, we're going to continue to do the work Mark set out," Bauer said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Sanford's unit has not been notified it will be called up, according to an Air Force Reserve spokesman in Charleston.</p>
