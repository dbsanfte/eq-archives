			I was bored, so I decided to check EQprices to see what everybody said about my weapon. JEEZ, this site attracts some of the biggest morons, I gotta say.  Seriously though, this quest is tedious, but it isnt very hard. Only really hard part is finding Faydedar.  He is very rare, and despawns within an hour. I would say your best shot at getting him, is to camp bait at the cheesboard island. There are many guilds and such looking for him, so dont expect to get him as soon as you need him. When a few of my guild friends went to kill  him and help me out while I was kiting him, there were plenty of people that were trying to take him away...Nonetheless, my friends got there, and engaged first, and getting the kill. Oh, and also, Venril Sathir. He isnt necessarily a hard or rare spawn. I mean Faydedar is random, so it is VERY hard to find him. But VS spawns every 3 days I believe, and can be taken with 2 groups of GOOD players. I mean players who are level 60 and have a well refined tactic for him. I believe we killed him in 15 seconds when I went to get a stone. The problem is, many other servers have waiting lists for him. There are plenty of druids/rangers who need him for their epics. Also, he drops top-of-the-line greaves for plate classes pre-velious. Of course now there are many better greaves quested for in Kael and such, but they are still nice nonetheless. It took me about a week straight to finish the quest AFTER I found Faydedar, BUT, that is because my guild dominates the server, and there are no waiting lists for any raids. So, Good Luck.<BR>

			Here is the Quest:<br>
This quest starts in the Burning Woods. Locate Telin Darkforest and ask him "what action". He will hand you a note, if not your faction is too low. Once you have the note, head over to Greater Faydark and hand it to Faelin Bloodbriar, who can be found wandering around the northern part of the forest, near Crushbone. She will reward you with a Ring. Now hand this ring to Giz X'Tin who can be found roaming along the paths in Kithikor Forest. He will hand you back a Dark Metal Coin and then a Dark Elf Reaver will spawn and attack you. You do not need to kill this creature so run away safely. <br>
<br>
Now head back to Telin Darkforest and hand him the Dark Metal Coin. He will hand it back to you as the Worn Metal Coin and then instructs you to locate Athele. She can be found in East Karana with three other druids. Hand her the coin and you will receive a Worn Amulet. Hand this amulet to Sionae, then to Nuien, and finally to Teloa. This will cause two Darkelf Reavers and a Darkelf Corrupter to spawn [-1500, -1000]. Yoo must find and kill the dark elf corrupter fast as he will depop after about 10 seconds if not attacked. You only need to kill the corrupter, to loot the Tome. Hand this tome to Athele and she will reward you with an Earth Stained Note. The last step is to head off to the Misty Thicket and locate Ella Foodcrafter. Hand her the note and she will give you her mixing bowl. <br>
<br>
The next step is to forage four items and combine them in the bowl to create a Hardened Mixture. The four items you need are as follows. The Frozen Tundra Root, can be foraged in Everfrost. The Sweetened Mudroots are found in the Misty Thicket. For the Sweetened Mushrooms, head over to Innothule Swamp and the Heartfruit can be foraged in Greater Faydark. Combine all four items in the bowl and you will create the Hardened Mixture. <br>
<br>
Now we have to head off to the Chessboard Island, which can be found in Timorous Deep. Talk to Alrik Farsight and ask him "how do you make an ancient bowl". He will hand you a crushed pot and tell you to head off to Felwithe. In the high elf town, talk to Farios Elianos. If he doesn't respond to you then you will need to increase your faction. Hand him the pot and you will receive a grocery list. Run over to North Felwithe and hand the list to Merchant Nora. She in turn will hand you a Bag of Provisions. Return this to Farios and he will hand you a Receipt for the Ancient Bowl. Head back to Timorous Deep now and hand the receipt to Alrik, who in turn will reward you with an Ancient Pattern. If you read the pattern, it will tell you to combine a Piece of Enchanted Clay and some Platinum Speckled Powder in a Pottery Wheel. <br>
<br>
To obtain the platinum speckled powder you will have to do a small subquest. Head over to Firiona Vie, and try to forage a Rose of Firiona. Once you have obtained it, hand it to Merdan Fleetwood who can be found in Surefall Glade. He will hand you an Old Wooden Painting. Now head off to the Frontier Mountains and hand the painting to the human skeleton that roams around the western part of this zone. It will hand you back a Silver Chained Locket. Head back to Surefall Glades and hand this locket to Niera Farbreeze. She will reward you with the Platinum Speckled Powder. <br>
<br>
The enchanted clay can be obtained through a small subquest as well. Talk to Kinlo Stongarm who can be found in the Everhot Forge in Kaladim. If you ask him "what mud" and then say "do it for me" he will tell you to bring him a Colored Axe. This axe is actually the Jade Reaver, which can be found in the City of Mist. Hand him the axe and he will reward you with the Enchanted Clay. Now combine the Pattern, Enchanted Clay and the Platinum Speckled Powder in the Potters Wheel and you will create the Rune Crested Bowl. You do not need to be a potter to combine the above items. <br>
<br>
Now head back to Misty Thicket and hand Ella Foodcrafter the Hardened Mixture and the Rune Crested Bowl. She will make you a Softly Glowing Stone. Now head off to Firiona Vie and talk to Foloal Stormforest, ask her "are you one such as myself" and then "what answers", and "what about venril sathir". She will tell you to bring her the Softly Glowing Stone and a Rare Gem that can be found on Venril Sathir. Venril Sathir is a very high level Necromancer that lives in Karnor's Castle. Hand both stones to Foloal and she will return a Warm Pulsating Stone. <br>
<br>
Head back to the Misty Thicket and hand the stone to Ella. She will in turn reward you with a Elaborate Scimitar. She will tell you to collect to Cleansed Spirits of Antonica, Faydwer and Kunark and hand them to Xanuusus with your Scimitar. <br>
<br>
The Withered Treant who lives in North Karana will tell you to find the corruption in the land and destroy it. The corruption he is talking about are the Corrupted Mammoth who can be found in Everfrost [2000, -4000], the Corrupted Aquagoblin Shaman in Lake RatheTear and the Corrupted Hill Giant in the Rathe Mountains. You will need to kill Tainted mobs in order to get the corrupted ones to spawn. Kill all three beasts and hand the Withered Treant the Pure Water, Ancient Rock, and the Chunk of Tundra that you looted off their corpses. He will reward you with a Warm Pulsating Heart. Now head over to South Karana and hand Yeka Ias the heart [2340, -2350]. He will give you the Cleansed Spirit of Antonica. <br>
<br>
Now talk to the Pained Unicorn who can be found in Lesser Faydark. Once again you will be required to kill the three corrupted beasts that pollute the continent. These beasts are the Corrupted Seahorse in Kedge Keep, the Corrupted Cyclops in the Ocean of Tears and the Corrupted Brownie in Lesser Faydark [0, 0]. Hand in the Green Cracked Branch, Kedge Cave Crystal, and the Ocean of Tears Vine, that you looted off the corpses, to the unicorn and you will receive the Gleaming Horn. Hand this horn to Silox Azrix who lives in Ak'Anon and you will receive the Cleansed Spirit of Faydwer. <br>
<br>
Now head off to the Swamp of No Hope and talk to Ulump Pujik, a named Froglok [-100, -1775]. He will tell you to give his essence along with the Green Tree Bark, Pure Lake Water, and the Pod of Sea Water to the Gnome that Hurts the Land. Kill Ulump to loot his essence. The three corrupted beasts are the Corrupted Gorilla in the Emerald Jungle, the Corrupted Barracuda in the Lake of Ill Omen [-900, -900], and the Dragon Faydedar that can be found in Timorous Deep. You will need to kill Tainted mobs in order to get the corrupted ones to spawn, except for Faydedar. Hand all four items that you looted off the corpses to Nekexin Virulence who can be found in The OverThere [3675, 800] and he will reward you with the Cleansed Spirit of Kunark. <br>
<br>
Now head back to North Karana and hand Xanuusus, the named Treant, the Cleansed Spirit of Faydwer, the Cleansed Spirit of Antonica, the Cleansed Spirit of Kunark and the Scimitar and you will receive the Nature Walkers Scimitar.<BR>

			Hey Crunchy. Can I have some of what you're smokin'?<br>
You went a little overboard moron. Your inbread sisters litter of puppies cant be that stupid. This seems to be an obvious ploy to get shit started with someone on your server.<br>
Sorry you seem to hate EQ so much. But a little advice... Try pulling your head out of your ass and you just might be able to see the monitor a little better.<BR>

			This weapon is a pain in the ass to get... it involves a large chunk out of any mortal humans live.. However the final benefit is well worth is.. for a RIGHT-CLICK on any target... and with a high level spirit of cheetah spell, you could kite anything on norrath. even a gm if he was so inclined to turn off his ring of infinite hitpoints.. Now, not to mention the free spell this thing has INSANE stat bonuses too... god i would give my husband and kids for this thing<BR>
