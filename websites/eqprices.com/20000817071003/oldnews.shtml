		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it may not look like much has changed on the surface, I have been going through a lot of the scripts fixing errors and making major improvements in execution speed.  The site is becoming stable and a lot faster, but there's more work to be done.  You will notice that some of the pages with entry forms have changed slightly to reduce workload on this end and make database updates easier.  Instructions about bad prices have also been added, since people continue to think its funny to add a lot of bad prices.  Funny... ha ha.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spent many hours tonight making a large site update.  First, I fixed a nasty, disgusting, sickeningly... well you get the idea.  It was a blindingly obvious bug in the code that I had somehow missed and it was preventing all the items from showing up in the searches.  Someone sent me an e-mail and pointed it out, so it's fixed now.  Expect a lot more items to show up in your searches.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition the price database has been cleaned up.  If you still see any bad prices, please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:feedback@eqprices.com">feedback@eqprices.com</a> and I'll fix it.  I also added a bunch more items to the database, which can be viewed from the recent items drop-down menu above.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge item update today (I finally got some time, and some net access).  The <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=neck&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Kunzar+Hex+Amulet">Kunzar Hex Amulet</a> is an amazing neck for any tank.  The <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=arms&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Adamantite+Armband">Adamantite Armband</a> also comes out of Howling Stones and has +3 WIS.  Tinkerers can look foward to making the <OPTION VALUE="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=back&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Thermal+Cloak">Thermal Cloak</a>.  AC6 SV COLD+20 is awesome against Vox, but unfortunatly it's only wearable by Gnomes.  Clerics can get a <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=shoulders&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Glowing+Pauldrons">+6 WIS Shoulders</a> in the Plane of Air, Necromancers get the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=back&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Cloak+of+Spiroc+Feathers">Cloak of Spiroc Feathers</a>, Bards get the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=neck&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Fae+Amulet">Fae Amulet</a>, and Enchanters get both the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=neck&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Necklace+of+the+Whispering+Winds">Necklace of the Whispering Winds</a> and the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=waist&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Sphinx+Hair+Cord">Sphinx Hair Cord</a>.  Seems like the place to be.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since they took the Mosscovered Branch/Twig out of the Frontier Mountains, I guess they replaced them with the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=1hs&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Cracked+Branch">Cracked Branch</a>.  Not quite as nice... oh well.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's an interesting weapon, the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=2hb&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Poison+Wind+Censer">Poison Wind Censer</a>.  First off, it's devistatingly powerful (20/28).  But, it has a huge negative SV POISON component, and appears to cast a Poison-based rain spell.  Ouch.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look for the images for these items, and more items, soon.  I am out of time!

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been out of internet access for the past couple days, but am back now and have cleaned up the price database and entered some more items.  On the Veeshan server, the Fires of Heaven have slain Trakanon and found the amazing <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=chest&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Singing+Steel+Breastplate">Singing Steel Breastplate</a>.  Most of us will never see armor like that.  The <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=head&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Gem+Encrusted+Circlet">Gem Encrusted Circlet</a> is a nice +6 INT head piece.  I also added another Plane of Air item, the Necromancer's <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=wrists&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Rotted+Griffon-Hide+Wrist+Guard">Rotted Griffon-Hide Wrist Guard</a>.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price entry script has been modified to allow prices up to 40,000 pp.  Apparently, some items are worth more than 20,000 pp (the old maximum).  How do you get that much cash anyway?

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent the past couple hours cleaning up bad prices in the database.  I refuse to let the quality of the prices decline, because it will become totally useless.  If you see any bad prices in the Price Info section, PLEASE use the "Report a Bad Price" link to let me know before moving on.  It takes 1 second to click it, and helps a lot.  I have filters in place that warn me when bad prices are entered, but they can never be 100% accurate.  Thanks!

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just completed a move into a new apartment, and have not had internet access for the past few days, so the updates have been a bit spaced apart.  I had to reinstall a 56k modem in my computer after leaving my cable modem behind (quite a painful experience).  I have a ton of user submissions to go through, so if you submitted a new item or item update, give me a few days to get it up on the site.  Life at 56k is painful after having the cable modem for so long.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Added even more items to the database, including some out of the higher level Kunark zones.  Check out the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=chest&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Mryolkar's+Breastplate">Mryolkar's Breastplate</a>, the Rogue breastplate that drops off of the dragon Trakanon in Sebilis.  Most of these items are quite powerful, but some seem a little underwhelming.  Since just getting <i>into</i> Howling Stones is an accomplishment, why is loot like the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=fingers&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Gem+Enlaid+Band">Gem Enlaid Band</a> dropping in there?<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems they went a little overboard when adding Ykesha items, as another one has been found in Howling Stones (the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=1hs&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Acid+Etched+War+Sword">Acid Etched War Sword</a>).

Any time I leave the site for a few days some people take notice and start entering a bunch of bad prices.  I guess that's entertaining, but I went through and cleaned it up.  My suggestion to all those people is to try to spend some more time outdoors.  If you still notice any bad prices send me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:feedback@eqprices.com">feedback@eqprices.com</a> and I'll check it out.<br>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am working on two major upgrades to the site. The first will be a printable price guide for all items.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with an item-wipe, test-server players have been revolting, and sending in items that were given to them by GMs and received through other questionable means.  These items are the best of the best, from the toughest areas in the game.  This update includes items from deep within Veeshan's Peak and the Plane of Air, and stuff off of the dragon Trakanon and Venril Sathir in Karnor's.  It doesn't get any better than this, and most of these items are unattainable by most players.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's see... we have a <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=2hb&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Shissar+Elementalists+Staff">wizard staff</a> with +12 INT and +60 mana.

I decided it would be a good time to go back and make corrections to a lot of items that needed it, and also add some new items.

Two more Plane of Air quest items have been added, the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=shoulders&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Raiment+of+Thunder">Raiment of Thunder</a> for Wizards and <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=shoulders&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Bloodsoaked+Raiment">Bloodsoaked Raiment</a> for Necros.  The database was also somehow missing two pieces of Cobalt armor for warriors, so I added the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=feet&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Cobalt+Boots">Cobalt Boots</a> and <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=hands&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Cobalt+Gauntlets">Cobalt Gauntlets</a>.

Also interesting is a caster robe with haste (<a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=chest&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Tolapumj's+Robe">Tolapumj's Robe</a>).<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The item sort is still in the works.  I have more time for coding now, so look for it soon.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also went through and cleaned out any invalid prices.  If you see any incorrect prices, please report them with the link that is shown on the 'Price Info' screen.  Thanks!

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I somehow forgot to upload the main page yesterday, but items were updated both yesterday and today out of Kunark.  More nice Sebilis items continue to filter in, including some great haste items (check out the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=waist&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Keywords=Runebranded+Girdle">Runebranded Girdle</a>).  Also out of Sebilis with this update comes some amazing cleric armor, including <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=legs&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Keywords=Donal's+Leggings+of+Mourning">Donal's Leggings of Mourning</a> and <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=feet&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Keywords=Donal's+Boots+of+Mourning">Donal's Boots of Mourning</a>.<br>

		<BR><BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made some updates to the item listing script so it rounds prices.  If it's less than 20 pp, it leaves it alone.  Otherwise, it will round it to the nearest 10 or 100 depending on what range the price falls into.  It's a lot nicer seeing 15000 pp than 15034 pp (at those prices, it's not broken down to a single plat anyway).

		<BR><BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This update includes a lot of items coming out of Sebilis.  It's a tough dungeon to get into (and you don't want to have your corpse stuck in there), but the risk seems to pay off nicely.  If the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=1hb&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Keywords=Rod+of+Annihilation">Rod of Annihilation</a> is real, it is easily the most powerful 1-hander in the game. 60 damage, 40 delay! It does come with a nasty -50 INT penalty though and that really hurts the classes that can use it.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadow Knights will definetly be interested in the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=wrists&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Keywords=Blood+Ember+Bracer">Blood Ember Bracer</a> (a bracer with 16 AC), or the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=arms&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Keywords=Blood+Ember+Vambraces">Blood Ember Vambraces</a>.  Unfortunatly, the effects on these items are just low-level spells that Shadow Knights already have.

I have updated the new price submissions box and cleaned out bad price entries from the database.  I also was able to get through all of my e-mails so if you wrote, you should have a response now.

		<BR><b>Date: Friday, May 12th at 3:43 PM EST</b>
		<BR><BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friday is finally here, and with it a bunch of spectacular new Kunark items. A devastating new two-handed blunt weapon for warriors and monks, the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=2hb&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Keywords=Runed+Fighters+Staff">Runed Fighters Staff</a>, jumps straight to #2 on the <a href="2HRank.shtml">Most Powerful 2-Handed Weapons List</a>.  The <a href="1HRank.shtml">Most Powerful 1-Handers List</a> also has a new entry in the top 10, the deadly <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=piercing&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Keywords=Bladed+Katar">Bladed Katar</a> for rogues.  Kunark is proving to have weapons that make Planar drops look like toys.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I finally got around to alphabetizing the New Prices list, so it's not so sloppy now.  I'd like to thank everyone who is helping out and adding prices, the price database has grown incredibly in the last few days.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the daily Kunark updates, today I have something more.  I wrote some scripts that will generate, in realtime, a list of the all the weapons in Everquest ranked by their power!  So, do you really want to know which weapons are the most powerful, and how your weapon stands up?  Well, you can check out the <a href="1HRank.shtml">1-Hander List</a> or the <a href="2HRank.shtml">2-Hander List</a>.  9 out of the top 10 2 handers are out of Kunark (the only other in the top 10 is an item from the Plane of Hate).  Hmmmmmmm.  Well, enjoy!

		<BR><b>Date: Wednesday , May 10th at 1:39 PM EST</b>
		<BR><BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another daily Kunark item update.  This time around, we have an amazing haste belt (the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=waist&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Keywords=Runebranded+Girdle" onMouseOver="return overlib('Is this for real?  Send me info!', FGCOLOR, '#122134', BGCOLOR, '#FFFFFF', TEXTCOLOR, '#B7B8C9');" onMouseOut="nd();">Runebranded Girdle</a>).  I don't have an image or location for it, so I can only assume it is real.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I added weapon damage/second and "effective percentage" calculations to the weapon listings.  The "effective percentage" is based on the most damaging weapon currently known (the awesome <a href="http://pat/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=2hb&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Keywords=Tranquil+Staff" onMouseOver="return overlib('The most powerful weapon found in Everquest to date.', FGCOLOR, '#122134', BGCOLOR, '#FFFFFF', TEXTCOLOR, '#B7B8C9');" onMouseOut="nd();">Tranquil Staff</a>), which has a damage/second ratio of 19.667.  All percentages are based on this number being 100% (until a more powerful weapon is discovered!).  Please note that these calculations do not account for any stats ont he weapon (including haste), so they may be a bit off.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A site like this will always be visited by the terminally bored, who feel it is there job to enter bad prices and screw up the database.  What fun.  I have put in scripts to maintain the quality of the database, and they will flag prices that deviate too far from the average so I can remove them if necessary.
