<br>
** Demise of the Classic/Velious Interface **<br>
<br>
Over the last six months we have been keeping the Classic EverQuest interface as
well as the Velious interface working through all of the features that we have
added (built-in MP3 player, item links, compass, enhanced /bug reporting tool,
and others). However, with the release of some of the new features in this
patch, such as running EQ in a window, we must now say goodbye to the older
interfaces. They have been disabled as of today.<br>
<br>
They served us well.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
** EQ in a Window **<br>
<br>
EverQuest can now be run in a window. To place EverQuest in a window, simply
press Alt-Enter. You can also switch out of EverQuest to another program by
using the familiar Alt-Tab. It is important that you do not do this until you
are in-game, do not do this during the login process.<br>
<br>
It is important to note a few things. Running the game in a window may reduce
game performance a bit. And, as always, the more programs you have running at
the same time the more resources they use.<br>
<br>
At this time, due to some changes that need to be made on the front end, it is
not possible to run two instances of EverQuest. We will be working to make the
necessary changes over the next few weeks.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
** Songs Window **<br>
<br>
We have added a new window to the interface along with new game functionality.
The Songs window is a new buff window that holds up to 6 bard song buffs. This
increases the potential maximum effects that a character can have to 21 (15
standard and the 6 new ones). The new window only holds certain bard songs
(generally the 3-tick songs). Only beneficial songs will qualify for the new
buff box, and not all of those. Any buff in the new Songs window is considered
temporary and will not be saved when you zone.<br>
<br>
Songs that qualify to go into the new window will go into that window first. Any
qualifying songs over six will be rerouted to the main Effects window. Cancel
Magic effects will see these new buff slots as buff slots #16-21.<br>
<br>
Note for User Interface skin creators: The Label EQTypes 80-85 are the Songs
window song names.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- Some magical effects on Planar class armor have been altered. In most cases
the effects were upgraded, but a few items were given weaker effects that were
more in line with the difficulty of obtaining them.<br>
- Fixed a bug that was causing a few Planes of Power NPCs to take too long to
respawn.<br>
- Wu's Attack should now work correctly.<br>
- Incoming damage now interacts with Wrath of the Wild and other rune-type
spells in their proper order.<br>
- Pact of Shadow and Shadow Compact will once again heal player characters.<br>
- Charmed Pets will no longer remain charmed after the owner dies.<br>
- Sending special characters (such as &lt; and &quot;<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) -->
<img alt=";)" src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="15" height="15"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->
 via EQIM will no longer freeze the game.<br>
- Hitting Autoattack when in explore mode at Character Select will no longer
cause the game to crash.<br>
- The Loadskin window will now load skins other than the default properly.<br>
- Fixed and issue that caused some NPC's text to be cut short.<br>
- Fixed (but did not rename) the Broken Golem. He should no longer be hated in
Fear, just feared...<br>
-Lowered the duration of calm-type spells that effect creatures level 50 and
over.<br>
