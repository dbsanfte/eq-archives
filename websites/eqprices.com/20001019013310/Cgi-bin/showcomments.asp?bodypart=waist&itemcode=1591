			why should ANYONE sell this girdle ? All classes can use it, it has super AC for a girdle ( AC 11 being the highest at the mom  I think ), it has haste and nice stats. Apart from it being THE belt for any hybrid all classes would be happy to have one and I would say if, and only IF someone should be so lucky as to get two of these and win both rolls they are trade only. Worth 10k and up. 10k being the lowest bid below no one should even bother.<BR>

			Well anyone that thinks that a caster shouldn't be able to roll for one is an ass.  Have youever stopped to think that maybe they have another character & it is a tank???  Also, this item is good for caster with all those stats, or is good for trade, for like lets say.... a better robe or something.<BR>

			The point that I was trying to make is that if this item was intended for melee class only, then it wouldn't have the class listed as ALL.  Yes I am a caster and I would love to have this item for several reasons.  I would love to have the extra stats in AC STR DEX STA HP AND MANA.  Think about it for a second, if this item did not have the effect haste on it, do you really think that melee classes would cry about casters rolling for it.  I dont think so.  I am just tired of all the melee classes crying and pouting that items like this are for them only and casters have no business rolling for them.  Besides, even if casters dont need it, I am sure that they would like to have it so they might be able to sell for something that they need.  After all....20k is a lot of plat!<BR>

			most people would a agree with me in saying that "anon" is a greedy guy. it is worth some cash, but if u r not going to use it, it should be reserved for tanks. i doubt a pure caster would need str sta dex and haste as much as a tank.  i say, casters dont roll, but tank that wins pays them off :)<BR>

			Casters should be welcome to roll on this item Number one it is the second highest mana belt for casters who gives a rats ass about haste that enchanter you are bitchin about Can Caste haste on your sorry human warrior ass.  So relax Class specific stuff shouldn't be rolled on by anyone but class but something that is ALL/ALL everyone should roll you greedy ass.  Just my 2 cents <BR><BR>

			For those of you that are agreeing with me...I would just like to say thank you.  It is nice to see that not all people are brain dead.  And for you Aauin, you seem to be the one that is "greedy".  Just because the item has effect haste on it, you feel that casters should not benifit from the stats, or the platinum they could get from selling it.  I am sure that when you look for a group, you try and get into one where you are the only tank so you can get all the drops.<BR><BR>As for everyone else that disagree's with me, lets start a poll on this and find out for sure.  It will be a simple poll, just a yes or no.  If im wrong then im wrong, but it wont change the way I feel about the subject.  I will still feel that casters should be able to roll for such and item if they choose to.  Now on with the poll, but PLEASE be honest...........<BR><BR>CASTERS..would you/could you benifit from wearing this item?  Do you think that this is a Melee only item because of the haste?  Could you use the 20k that it is worth?<BR><BR>Tanks(although i know most of your answers already)...Do you REALLY think that casters have NO business rolling for this item?  Do you think that melee classes are the only ones that should benifit from the "sale" of this item?<BR><BR>

			All hail Wrecka, the mighty tank that has a bank account so large that he dosn't need 20k.  Must be from all the "melee" only items that you got.  Do me a favor and think before you make a post.<BR><BR>Seems like some of you are missing the point.  A few people have called me the "greedy" one.  Yet the way I see it, it is that the tanks that are the greedy ones.  Just because this item has effect haste on it, DOES NOT mean that it is melee only.  If Verant meant for it to be melee only, then the class/race WOULD NOT say ALL/ALL!!  But because it has the haste, tanks feel that they should be the only ones that benefit from the stats (which really arn't that bad for a caster) or the platinum they could get from selling it. Yet I am the greedy one huh?  Sounds a lot like the tanks that are greedy to me.<BR>

When i get in a group i find out form the get go what that loot rules are for that group and live by them , i ve lost a a green jaded broadsword to a wizzy.. Hmm can he swing that ?? i doubt it .. But the loot rules were everyone rolled and he won it fairly .. Just my two cents. <BR>=)<BR>

			just my 2cp worth...One if you dont like loot rules, dont group with those people.  Two, any intelegent group, guild, or raid would say yes i feel that "As a group" this item would most benefit the melee classes and they should role on it.  Most god, dragon loot is all all, why, because Verant wants everyone to have a chance at these items, however lets turn the tables casters...My warrior wants to roll on Tobrin's Mystic Eyepatch droped by Vox, 15 wis 15 int, but hey its all so a war can use right, common people, think with your fellow mate inmind and not your pocket books.  I say what goes around, you let that tank roll on that tank item, and he lets you roll on that caster items, your odds are better, think about it =)<BR>LoL, one more thing, its funny that some of you people are using Verant to back your selves up, more and likely most of those people also bitch about Verants bad CS and nerfs, hehe.<BR>

			Ok Just a few comments:<BR>1 - what does a warrior need with mana? excluding the bone clasp girdle it is the highest mana belt that I have seen.<BR>2- Neotyre as for the eye patch.. It is priceless period and if you traded it you would more than likely be banned from ever being on a plane raid again, not a good example.<BR>3- there are plenty of other items out there for a warrior to use that has haste that can not be worn by casters.<BR>4- I agree that class specific items should be rolled on in most casses but this should be open to all.<BR>5- And why all the anons? I mean are you to chicken shit to say your opinion and people know your identity?<BR><BR>Anyways thats my thoughts on it.<BR>Dethloc E'ci<BR><BR>

			First, I'd like to say my group while camping Guardian got 1 of these fine girdles off a shaman.  Everyone in the group but myself were various caster types, with no argument / pouting / etc... all the casters agreed unanimously that the item is more for a tank so, without hesitation, the item was given to me.   Thank you Codex the Cleric, Axelen the Enchanter, Chriorn the Necromancer,<BR>Aanilia the Magess and Tanini the Druid all from the Innoruuk Server.<BR><BR>Now to respond.. heheh<BR><BR>Dethloc - True a warrior doesn't need mana, but a ShadowKnight (which I am) or any hybrid does.  Eyepatch  was a fine example, but just to cover bases here are a few other items that are ALL CLASS useable but are obviously ment for casters and, atleast on my server, tanks do not usually roll for UNTIL all casters in the group(s) have gotten 1 :  Golden Efreeti Boots, Golden Chitin Bracer, Polished Mithril Mask, Molten Cloak, Impskin Gloves and the list goes on....  How woulkd any Caster like to be in an Efreet group and watch all the EBoots that load goto all the tanks FIRST because they rolled better?  heheh<BR><BR><BR>Anon - Jusat some comments, Going by your logic, if a group in Karnor were to kill Venril Sathir and get the Blood Ember Greaves, even if there were only 1 SK in the group all should roll.  Why?  Because Anyone could use these to get  1) alot of cash that as you pointed out anyone could use  or 2) their own class leggings.  <BR><BR>Now before you scream  Those are class specific so don't count, let me stop you.  Yes these are class specific ONLY because verant wanted them to be unique to the class, as with all the new class armors, BUT they are also not NODROP which means it was intended for classes to trade pieces around to get thiers or sell them, etc... Unlike Most plane class armor which is NODROP because verant wanted the player/class getting them to actually be there.  Hence, because ANYONE can/would benefit from winning the random on these it would not be fair to only allow the classes present that they are for to roll.  <BR><BR>This is BULL!!  <BR><BR>If a piece of armor dropped that was made for a shaman then any/all shamans present should be the only ones rolling, even if ANYONE could benefit from obtaining them.<BR><BR>So even though the item is  ALL/ALL anyone with half a brain can look at it and see it is ment for tanks, only the tanks should roll, which is the same for EBoots, Impskin Gloves, etc.., they are obviously ment for casters even though they are ALL/ALL, only the casters should roll (once all the casters have some, then the tanks can roll)! ....  <BR><BR>Well, I've rattled enough, back to EverQuest to play with my new Girdle..<BR><BR>Balrizangor the Sexiest ShadowKnight<BR>54th Level<BR>

			Ok Balrizangor, I agree that you being a SK have a right to one of these belts and I do think that tanks should have a chance to get this belt but I still feel strongly that a caster should have a chance to get this also 1 because the bone clasped belt costs 100k+ and you have to obtain it in POF. Much harder to get than this belt is. Ok say you have a group of 1 Warrior, Shaman, Ranger, Enchanter, Cleric, and a Wizard everyone in the group would benifit very much from this belt. Do a search sometime on wizard wearable belts. There are 24 total, how many of those are even worth a damn for a caster? I'll tell you... 7 and out of those know how many drop in the planes? 4 so that leaves 3 belts that are not harder than hell and take an uber guild to obtain. Of those 3 belts how many add mana? 2 of those  one has + 10 mana + 10 hitpoints. The other one is the one that we are debating about. Warriors have about 40 belts to choose from. Out of those 40 15 are very benificial to warriors ( more for hybrids) out of those 15 , 5 have a haste effect. So, if I was in this group I would demand before hand that I get a chance to roll for this belt. Not for the cash but for the benifits that it offers to my class. Thats my rant.<BR><BR>"Of the things that I lost I miss my mind the most"<BR>ozzy <BR><BR>Dethloc E'ci<BR>

All Group members are FIGHTING right? THeyre ALL contributing to the "Cause".....so theyre ALL eligible for the ROLL!!! (Many of your group members have SEVERAL other race/class Charcters, that they are ALSO playing)......I Say the ones Crying about 'Tanks Roll Only' or 'Casters Roll Only' .....need to shut UP.....and just go SOLO......your group members ALL have a purpose and a function....so live with it....or TAKE OFF!! and THATS my 2pp worth!!<BR><BR>

			With all the bickering here it's kinda funny. Glad my guild doesn't have these harsh loot problems..We go by the simple philosophy of Guild leader and Officers decided where it goes and if none are on then as a GUILD we decide who can best benefit from it.  To put it simply we aren't LOOT WHORES.  We are a collection to do things as a GUILD and split the loot as a guild to most benefit those that need it.  First thing has to be said is this belt was meant for ALL/ALL which all can best benefit from it.  First group is Hybrids..they get automatic first shot at it..come on guys look it's haste with caster boosting stats it was tailor made for them and i gotta tell you SK's got a tough time finding good equipment that doesn't go to Warriors or Pali's first. Of course Pali would be next on the list. Bards fall into the next slot of getting this although it's kind of a toss up.  Now here's where i know i'll get bashed,to be honest after much debate this item should go to pure casters following the hybrids and bards..simply put there are ALOT better haste and stat boosting items for Warriors out there already. If anyhting Tanks get it dead last, although if that many in your guild are dropping then you guys are sick.  To all you out there that group with people randomly or in Pickup groups and don't Exsclusively hunt with just guildmates or perhaps one other closely tied guild then you should all make a loot policy BEFORE you do things like Sebilis and such..save HOURS of arguements. In closing i see both sides of this issue but i feel STRONGLY that warriors have no business owning this item as do the rest of my guild. In fact most warriors pass on it keeping there other belts being that they are more superior and also the fact that they are attached to there CoF's.<BR>    Thanx<BR>
