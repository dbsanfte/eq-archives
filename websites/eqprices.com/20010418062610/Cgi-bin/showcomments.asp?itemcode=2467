You say, 'Yes I have come for the words of Magi'kot.'<br>

Jahsohn Aksot says 'The Words of Magi'kot can only be shared with those elementalists whose minds are of balance. The Words were separated into three pieces by a high council of Magi who feared that the story would bring an end to elementalists throughout Norrath.

If you truly wish to continue, here is what you must do. Gather the Power of the Earth, warded by a fae creature. Then seek the Power of Fire, held by an elemental. Next you will need the Power of Wind, held by a twirling and prancing wanderer who has been corrupted. Finally, the Power of Water, held by a ravenous beast who is the minion of a fallen Sarnak. Bring them all to me, and I shall give you the Power of the Elements. <br>

"An Elementalist's power comes from the Orb of Mastery. The Elements of Earth, Fire, Wind, and Water are contained within the Orb. The Master of Elements hold the Orb.<br>

<br>
He can be found in the Plane of Air. No mortal has been able to contain the true power of the Orb. Trilith Magi'kot presented himself to the Master of Elements and the Orb of Mastery. The power of elements brought agony to his mind and body. Magi'kot was not of Balance.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Fire burned his eyes unto blindness, Wind put his mind into a spin, Earth entered his body and aged him like the mountains, and finally, Water washed his memories of mortal life away. Failing his test, the Orb exacted its terrible price, and now Magi'kot is part of the Orb.<br>

			Okay, I was just in the hole today with a group of 6.  By the end of 2-3 hours 4 of these dropped in the doorway off of creatures blue to a level 45.<br>
<br>
Yes, for it's stats it is worth 1kpp easy as compared to a nightshade wreath.  The only problem really is that it has 8wt.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, this is a really common item.  Not only that, but it is worthless to anyone but a mage.  These factors drops it's price in half or more.<br>
<br>
Moral of the story, sell it for what you can get for it.  ~600pp sounds pretty high.  I saw one being sold for 400pp, but honestly it's probably not about what it's worth in platinum but finding a buyer.  I have no opinions about the price, just things to think about.<BR>

In the hole for every one picked up 3 rot, this with a group of 6 only just hacking all day.  Soon the only thing left will be to give them to newbies...   <br>
