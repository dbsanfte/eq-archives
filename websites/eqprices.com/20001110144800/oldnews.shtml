		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another stack of user submissions has been added to the site.  Thanks for pointing them out and if you see any other items that are missing feel free to send me a note.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price adding code continues to be tweaked and has been very succesful so far in cutting down the number of bad prices.  Some people are very persistant, and will enter bad prices for an item day after day.  But they will just continue to be deleted so it's a waste of time.  Enjoy!

		<BR><BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new section has been put in, for misc. Items that don't fit in the other categories.  Such items are inventory items with clickable effects, smithing dyes, etc.  I didn't include any NO DROP items for now, since the purpose of this site is to track the economy.  If you know of any more items that belong in that section and aren't listed, please submit them.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I added many more user-submissions (100+), and cleaned out some bad prices.  Some of the required items for the new Partical Weapon quests are insane.  You have to turn in items that are very desired by a wide variety of classes.  For example, for the Shaman quest you have to turn in <a href ="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=feet&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Black+Fur+Boots">Black Fur Boots</a>, a very nice item on their own!

		<BR><b>Date: Wednesday, September 27th at 11:20 PM EST by Soliptic D'Ception</b>
		<BR><BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since last February, when this site first launched, I have been running banner advertisements as part of the <a href="http://www.gamefan-network.com">GameFan Network</a>, so I can offset my hosting and high bandwith costs.  As months went by, I realized that I wasn't getting any money for all these ads I was showing.  In fact, as of today (SEPTEMBER 27th), I have yet to recieve a single penny from GameFan, and have had to cover all costs associated with this site on my own.  I learned I'm not alone, and that NONE of GameFan's affiliate sites have been paid in months.  <a href="http://www.somethingawful.com">Something Awful</a>, one of the sites I frequent, has also decided to take action against GameFan Networks.  So while I'm figuring out how best to sue them, I have had to switch the site over to per-click banners.  Yesterday, I made $0.36 from these banners, not even coming close to my daily bandwith cost.  'Nuf said.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you appreciate the hours of effort I put into this site every day, please click on the banners and help me pay for the cost of this site.  And you can also shoot off a few e-mails to the kind folks over at <a href="http://www.gamefan-network.com">GameFan Network</a>, showing your support and letting them know that they should PAY ME.  Thank you :)

		<BR><b>Date: Sunday, September 24th at 10:04 PM EST by Soliptic D'Ception</b>
		<BR><BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The code has been updated to deal with people trying to ruin the price database.  Much stronger checks are in place to make sure that prices make sense.  The last resort will be to make the site require a log-in to add prices, so I can ban people who enter bad prices.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I added hundreds of user item submissions tonight (and I have a bunch left to do tomorrow).  I plan on adding two new sections soon, a Range Slot item section and a Misc. Item section.  The Misc. section will contain anything that doesn't fit in the other categories (tradeable quest components, smithing dyes, etc).  Look for it soon.

		<BR><BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain items in the database have been flagged as "Priceless" (see the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=chest&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Cobalt">Cobalt Breasplate</a>).  Basically, these items are so rare than they would never be sold.  Even prices like 20,000 pp would be way too low.  If you see any other items in the database that would never be sold (only a couple per server, for example), <a href="mailto:feedback@eqprices.com">let me know</a>.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain scripts have been optimized, including the comments scripts.  Now, when you enter a comment it will take you straight back to the comments page, rather than an annoying in-between page.  Also, the maximum price entry has been raised to 50,000 pp and all errors associated with entering high prices have been fixed.

		<BR><b>Date: Friday, September 15th at 11:13 AM EST</b>
		<BR><BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fixed a major bug in the code this morning that was causing it to reject all price entries on certain items.  Also, when you went to view the price details on those items, it would display an error message.  It's been un-nerfed.  It only occured on certain items, which is why it took so long for me to notice.  If you see <i>any</i>error messages on the site, <i>please</i> send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:feedback@eqprices.com">feedback@eqprices.com</a> and I'll fix them ASAP.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for the lack of updates is because my job is taking up a lot of the time that I used to devote to the site (what else is new).  So I decided to put in a bunch of remote administration stuff so that I can fix bad prices, update items, and repair code on this site from work.  So expect more frequent updates and postings of user-submissions (I'll just have to keep my fingers on ALT+TAB so I don't get fired).<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if you see any bad prices, please use the report link on the Price Details page to tell me about it.  I clean out bad prices daily, so that the quality of the site remains high.

AC6 SV COLD+20 is awesome against Vox, but unfortunatly it's only wearable by Gnomes.

There is also a warrior Plane of Air item, the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=waist&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Belt+of+the+Four+Winds">Belt of the Four Winds</a>, which is rumored to have the fastest haste in the game.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, The Hole opened in Paineel.  I got there immediatly and, after a few zone crashes, started to explore.  The zone looks very impressive, and is not easy.  The stuff near the entrance was hitting for well over 100.  We picked up a bunch of new items, and those have been added.  A couple items of interest are the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=shoulders&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Imbued+Granite+Spauldors">Imbued Granite Spauldors</a> and the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=1hb&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Smoldering+Brand">Smoldering Brand</a>.<br>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is, without a doubt, the most amazing update this page has ever seen.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with an item-wipe, test-server players have been revolting, and sending in items that were given to them by GMs and received through other questionable means.  These items are the best of the best, from the toughest areas in the game.  This update includes items from deep within Veeshan's Peak and the Plane of Air, and stuff off of the dragon Trakanon and Venril Sathir in Karnor's.  It doesn't get any better than this, and most of these items are unattainable by most players.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's see... we have a <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=2hb&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Shissar+Elementalists+Staff">wizard staff</a> with +12 INT and +60 mana.  A <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=2hb&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Ton+Po's+Bo+Stick+of+Understanding">stick for monks</a> with 44 damage and 40 delay, plus a nasty effect (no, that damage/delay is not a typo).   Rangers get a <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=ears&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Thunderforged+Earring">+8 AC earring</a> loaded with stats.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there's a whole lot more where those came from.  Check out the Recent Updates dropdown box above for the rest of the list.  And wipe up that drool while you're at it.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When wandering around the web this morning, I noticed that <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/index.shtml">EQ'Lizer</a> had posted a huge item update.  I decided it would be a good time to go back and make corrections to a lot of items that needed it, and also add some new items.  Check out the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=wrists&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Golden+Bracer">Golden Bracer</a>, with +7 INT and other stats.  Then there is the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=neck&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Necklace+of+Defiance">Necklace of Defiance</a>, and even though it has no stat bonuses, the 8 AC makes it a very nice tank item.  Two more Plane of Air quest items have been added, the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=shoulders&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Raiment+of+Thunder">Raiment of Thunder</a> for Wizards and <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=shoulders&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Bloodsoaked+Raiment">Bloodsoaked Raiment</a> for Necros.  The database was also somehow missing two pieces of Cobalt armor for warriors, so I added the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=feet&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Cobalt+Boots">Cobalt Boots</a> and <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=hands&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Sort=alpha&Keywords=Cobalt+Gauntlets">Cobalt Gauntlets</a>.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besdies the new items, over 100 items had their info updated.  So all those items that had comments like "Where can I find this???", there is probably an answer now!

Well, you can check out the <a href="1HRank.shtml">1-Hander List</a> or the <a href="2HRank.shtml">2-Hander List</a>.  9 out of the top 10 2 handers are out of Kunark (the only other in the top 10 is an item from the Plane of Hate).  Hmmmmmmm.  Well, enjoy!

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another daily Kunark item update.  This time around, we have an amazing haste belt (the <a href="/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=waist&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Keywords=Runebranded+Girdle" onMouseOver="return overlib('Is this for real?  Send me info!', FGCOLOR, '#122134', BGCOLOR, '#FFFFFF', TEXTCOLOR, '#B7B8C9');" onMouseOut="nd();">Runebranded Girdle</a>).  I don't have an image or location for it, so I can only assume it is real.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I added weapon damage/second and "effective percentage" calculations to the weapon listings.  The "effective percentage" is based on the most damaging weapon currently known (the awesome <a href="http://pat/Cgi-bin/showitems.asp?bodypart=2hb&race=any&class=any&stats=any&price=any&NoDrop=yes&Keywords=Tranquil+Staff" onMouseOver="return overlib('The most powerful weapon found in Everquest to date.', FGCOLOR, '#122134', BGCOLOR, '#FFFFFF', TEXTCOLOR, '#B7B8C9');" onMouseOut="nd();">Tranquil Staff</a>), which has a damage/second ratio of 19.667.  All percentages are based on this number being 100% (until a more powerful weapon is discovered!).  Please note that these calculations do not account for any stats ont he weapon (including haste), so they may be a bit off.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A site like this will always be visited by the terminally bored, who feel it is there job to enter bad prices and screw up the database.  What fun.  I have put in scripts to maintain the quality of the database, and they will flag prices that deviate too far from the average so I can remove them if necessary.
