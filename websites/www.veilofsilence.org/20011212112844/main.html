        into our halls of silence… as you enter, you noticed even your
        footsteps seem muffled and un-eerily quiet. You hear whispers, yet see
        no one…as you continue deeper into the halls, the mist departs and you
        see a gathering of people.<br>
        <br>
        We are a group of people built on family and friendship, not the greed
        that has permeated much of Norrath. We are built to help everyone in the
        guild to grow strong, not a few.<br>
        <br>
        If you are looking for a group of people to become friends and family
        with, please make a post in the Join VoS forum and tell us about
        yourself. Currently we are looking for people levels 53+ of various
        classes. But if you are not of 53+, but have an interest in us and are
        of 50+, you are welcome to come with us sometimes to see if we fit each
        other. The dedicated have come to enjoy what we have to offer and made
        the minimum requirements.<br>
        <br>
        But our activities are our own, and much of it is not talked outside of
        it. That is our primary rule.<br>
        <br>
        Welcome to our hall.&nbsp; If you have never been here before, feel free
        and look around,<br>
