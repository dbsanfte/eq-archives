<h3>Guild History</h3>

<p>The beginning was a vision. Zhokaii saw Cazic Thule himself standing beside
Rallos Zek the Warlord, Innoruuk the Prince of Hate, and Bertoxxulous the
Plague Bringer. Zhokaii quickly fell to her knees and lowered her head in
anticipation of her dark lords fearsome voice. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>The great voice of Cazic Thule rang out and echoed, &quot;Zhokaii, you serve
me well. Though you would serve me better by serving all of darkness. Only
darkness united shall overcome the light gods...Together we shall destroy our
enemies. Together we shall spread fear, hate, plague and carnage unprecedented!
A black wind is needed Zhokaii! A black wind to sweep over all of Norrath! You
are the blood seeker Zhokaii! Amass your horde and serve us well!!!&quot; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>With out leaving her knees or even raising her one good eye to view her
lord, Zhokaii quickly replied, &quot;Zhokaii weell serve darknezz well oh
Mighty Cazic Thule! Zhokaii weell see the Gods of Light fall in the name of
darknezzz! You weell be proud Mighty one!&quot; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Cazic Thule and the dark gods disappeared with out a further word. Zhokaii
had no intentions of failing the dark gods. That very moment, she set out to
amass a dark horde, a Bloodhorde, and swore to herself that she would not fail.
She vowed to see every city of light in ruin and every Light God fall. All that
did not succumb to darkness would fall to it. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Zhokaii immediately thought of the tales she had heard of a Greenblood
Shadowknight of Oggok whose thirst for blood was unmatched, a female ogre whom
the men of Oggok cowered before. It was said that across the land she had come
to be known as Kolu the Warfiend. Zhokaii knew this shadowknight would see her
vision as true. So Oggok would be the first dark city of her quest to amass a
bloodhorde. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Kolu Warfiend was every bit as fearsome and savage as the tales had
promised. Zhokaii was wise, she quickly promised Kolu that the land would be
soaked in blood and that she would always have a belly full of human flesh if
she joined her Bloodhorde. Kolu became Zhokaii's loyal guardian that very
moment, and from then on the two were rarely seen apart. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>They set out for Neriak soon there after, slaughtering those who were
unfortunate enough to find themselves in their path. Small villages and bandit
camps across the land were left in ruin. There came a day that Zhokaii and Kolu
stumbled across two ogres and a troll warrior battling the Deathfist Orcs in a
rather large Deathfist camp. The heaps of orc bodies were piled about their
feet but the orcs kept coming and this band of three was greatly out numbered. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Zhokaii quickly let loose a fearsome warcry and Kolu charged into battle.
Zhokaii stood back reciting incantations that healed the young war band from
the swamplands and left the orcs screaming and clutching their ears. Soon blood
painted the tents and made dry ground into mud, the battle was over. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>The dark gods had smiled on this war band from the swamplands and shown
their discontent with the orcs of Deathfist. That evening they feasted on the
flesh of orcs as Zhokaii shared her vision with the young war band. Their
Shaman, Zuku Snakebiter of Oggok nodded in agreement with Zhokaii through out
the tale of her vision and when morning came, they all set out together. This
is how the ogres Zuku Snakebiter and Balborus Ironarm, and the troll warrior
called Boilybut Stinkfist came to join the horde. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Upon reaching Neriak they encountered members of a Tier'dal house known as
Quellar del Oloth. Their leader, a Tier'dal necromancer called Vengerax Veldrin
swore that they would be the Army that saw the light gods fall. Zhokaii and her
band decided that among this army they would be stronger, so they joined this
house of darkness. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Soon Zhokaii grew unsatisfied with the lack of blood shed. She watched those
with weak hearts infiltrate the house. She knew then she should have never been
swayed from her vision, so with her band she left, and the true followers of
darkness saw her vision as truth and soon sought to join her horde. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>From the depths of Neriak came the necromancer Nulliira Valsharess and the
wizard Ordeith B'muun. Nulliira Valsharess soon became known as the whisper in
Zhokaii's ear. From the festering swamps of the south came Kazrak Everhate, and
the ogres Rmok Gorefist and Ulul Doomonger. They became the fists of the horde,
leaving corpses everywhere they went. From Erudin came a necromancer who had
sworn to never hear his true name again after being exiled from his home, he
was now only known as the Rotting Incarnate. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Again Zhokaii swore she would not fail, she vowed to see every city of light
in ruin and every Light God fall. All that did not succumb to darkness would
fall to it. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>The horde continued to grow, and word was spreading across the land. Many
aligned themselves against the Horde. An army known as the Watchmen became
quite vocal about their intent to destroy the Bloodhorde. There were also
whispers of an unseen group plotting against them, and it was one of these
Unseen who first planted a seed of dissent among the Horde. Nulliira introduced
Zhokaii to a high elf cleric of Tunare named Guile, with whom she enjoyed
&quot;playing with&quot;. Zhokaii had far too much faith in Nulliira and the
strength of her hatred. She thought it impossible Nulliira could ever love
anyone, much less a cleric of Tunare. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>The years went on and many battles had been fought. The Horde still grew,
but already the wizard Ordeith B'Muun had been slain in a raid on a village
near Freeport and the ogre Rmok Gorefist had been rumored to be killed by the
hands of a band of crusaders while on a quest Zhokaii had given him. Nulliira
had born a daughter named Velrana many years past, and she was becoming a very
vigilant disciple of Hate. Zhokaii looked upon her as a neice of sorts. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Then the turning point came. Zhokaii had believed her Horde to be only the
truest followers of the Dark Gods. Those who could never be swayed. But upon
journeying through Kithicor forest with only Kolu by her side, a band of a
dozen assassins ambushed them. Kolu went into a rage the likes of which even
Zhokaii had not yet seen, and in the time Zhokaii had begun reciting an
incantation Kolu the Warfiend had slain half their attackers, the combined
might of the blade of Kolu and the magic of Zhokaii proved too much for the
would be assassins. The remaining few scattered and fled. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Zhokaii examined the bodies of her attackers and was shocked to find the
symbol of the Unseen upon each of them. The same symbol Guile, the cleric of
Tunare Nulliira had kept for amusement and for so many years had worn. It was
then Zhokaii realized, Nulliira was the only one who knew of the path Zhokaii
would take this night. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>&quot;GRAAAARRRRR!!! BRANG ME NULLIIRA KOLU!!!&quot; It took many months but
Kolu did return with Nulliira Valsharess. Upon hearing of the failed plot she
had went into hiding, and when finally found she had put up quite a battle. Two
Greenblood ogres who accompanied Kolu had been slain. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Nulliira found herself bound and gagged on to what appeared to be some sort
of table in the center of what she knew to be dining room of the Horde. One by
one, minions of the horde, Boneguards, Bloodknights and Circle of Bones members
entered. Nulliira's own guard, Kazrak Everhate could be seen viewing her with
great disdain. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Zhokaii took the head of the table. Her words rang clear and there was
little doubt she was a true prophet of Cazic Thule, as even the most fearless
of these followers of the Dark Gods felt fear in the very pits of their
bellies. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>&quot;Tonight Zhokaii feasts on one who betrayed her!&quot;, Zhokaii roared.
<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Strong as Nulliira was known to be, her eyes watered with fear and she
screamed beneath the gag as Zhokaii began cutting into her live and dining upon
her flesh. Many Tier'dal cringed at the sight. Kazrak Everhate stared intently
as though feeling the need to prove his loyalty to the Horde, having once been
the personal guard of Nulliira. And though all remained silent, the Rotting
Incarnate was obviously delirously pleased as he had plans to take Nulliira's
place at the side of Zhokaii. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>When Zhokaii finished licking the last bone clean, the Rotting Incarnate stood,
turned and faced Zhokaii, bowed and spoke &quot;My mistress Zhokaii, now that
Nulliira is no longer your high advisor, you will need a new right hand shall
you not? I would like to volunteer to serve you in this position.&quot; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Before Zhokaii spoke Kolu the Warfiend stood from directly across the table,
unsheathed her massive sword and split the table in two. &quot;RAAAAARRRR!!!
KOLU BE DA RIGHT HAND!!!&quot;. Upon this obviously hostile action, all of the
horde scattered and stood back, Rotting quickly summoned a quite fearsome
undead soldier by his side, and suddenly none but Zhokaii, the Rotting
Incarnate and Kolu the Warfiend were left around the remaining splinters and
shards of the table. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Zhokaii's eyes gleamed with the prospect that presented itself. All of the horde
would now witness the two most feared of her ranks battling to the death to
stand by her side. It could only serve to make them all the more loyal and
fearful of her. Both the Rotting Incarnate and Kolu the Warfiend looked to
Zhokaii for any sign that she would stop them from doing battle, when there was
none they engaged! <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>The battle was long lasting. The Rotting Incarnate was dumbfounded when he
cursed Kolu with diseases and venoms and they did not so much as slow her swing
or even cause a sweat. The undead soldier had fought well but Kolu finally
split it much in the same manner as she had split the table. The Rotting
Incarnate shadow stepped and began desperately trying all he could manage but
Kolu was too mighty and too blood thirsty. She found him behind her and with
with an upward swing of her sword she disembowled him from his groin to his
neck. The Rotting Incarnate had fallen and surely all now knew to fear Zhokaii
and her fist, Kolu the Warfiend. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Kolu approached Zhokaii and took her place by her side. Zhokaii shouted out
&quot;NOW FER LEETLE VELRANA! SHE IS OF DA BLUD OF A HIGH ELF AN' AH BETRAYER!
SHE MUST PAY!&quot; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>It wasn't long before Velrana was found. It was well known that Nulliira had
claimed the Kithicor Forest as her own and had many undead servants there.
Velrana had been found in a ruined shack there, starving and trembling with
fear, ashamed of her mothers betrayal. Kolu returned her to Zhokaii, and again,
there was a feast. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>With the new found fear spreading through the horde, and the dissenters
dead, there was but one course of action. Inflict brutal and fear inspiring
acts across the land that would leave none questioning if the Horde would grow
weaker with the loss of Nulliira. With out her scheming whisperer Zhokaii had
become blood thirsty like never before. Her horde roamed the land aimlessly
with but one intent, blood shed. There was no longer any hint of the tactics or
planning Nulliira had encouraged. All that was left was carnage, and Kolu the
Warfiend, more than any, was quite pleased by this. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>The constant raids and battles of the horde had Norrath in panic, but with
every raid and battle, more of the Horde fell. Zhokaii knew there must be
change or soon there would be no horde left. And just as their numbers began to
diminish and their power with it, the dark gods intervened. Vengerax Veldrin,
the leader of Quellar del Oloth, and his followers arrived at the Bloodhorde
encampment. Vengerax explained that they had heard tale of the deeds of the
Bloodhorde and recognized the fear Zhokaii inspired, and that all along, her
vision had been true. He further explained that he and his followers had
travelled far to join the ranks of the Bloodhorde and further the cause of the
dark gods. Zhokaii was quite pleased, as she knew Vengerax to be a powerful and
revered necromancer, both within his dark house and in the dark elven city of
Neriak. Quellar del Oloth was taken into the Bloodhorde and Vengerax
immediately became a member of the Circle of Bones. Zhokaii also promoted two
of her own children of the horde to the Circle of Bones. They were Kajen
Tai'Shan, the tier'dal enchanter and Runja, the troll shaman who carried no
surname, but whose shaman powers were said to be growing at a rate unheard of,
and whose blood red eyes were said to hold the fear of Zhokaii Blackblood
herself. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>With the new found leadership and numbers, the raids and battles continued.
Only now, with the counsel of the Circle of Bones, they had become more aimed
and more tactical. Morale grew as the hordes ogres and trolls grew fat with the
flesh of humans. The enemies they engaged were but a trail of marred bones.
Towns and villages lay in ruin. Notable temples to Mithaniel Marr, Erollisi
Marr, Rodcet Nife and Tunare were seized and burnt to the ground. It was a dark
time for Norrath, surely the dark gods were smiling. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Zhokaii had amassed a Bloodhorde that seemed invincable. Small villages had
fled to the large cities for protection. Armies of Templars had amassed to
protect the cities of Freeport and Qeynos. Zhokaii was pleased with her years
of reign and the destruction she had caused in the name of the dark gods. She
knew it was time for her to unveil her secret now, and let her heir, the child
of Innoruuk, lead the horde. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>This secret began at the time of Zhokaii's first vision. She had been a
respected shaman of Grobb, but none called her a dark prophet then. Even the
darkest hearts can fall prey to love, and Zhokaii Blackblood had fallen for a
shadowknight of Grobb known as Cho'gall Warfist. Cho'gall Warfist was a feared
member of the Shadowknights of Grobb. It was his wish that their romance remain
secret. He could not allow trolls to know he had a weakness for anything, but
the dark heart of Zhokaii made him weak. In private, he served her like a slave
to show his devotion. They were content with their secret romance and then the
vision came to Zhokaii. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Zhokaii recieved her vision of Cazic Thule himself, as stated in this
history, and as said he did standd beside Rallos Zek the Warlord, Innoruuk the
Prince of Hate, and Bertoxxulous the Plague Bringer. But when his voice echoed
there were more words than those Zhokaii had shared with her followers
&quot;Zhokaii, you serve me well. Though you would serve me better by serving
all of darkness. Only darkness united shall overcome the light gods...Together
we shall destroy our enemies. Together we shall spread fear, hate, plague and
carnage unprecedented! A black wind is needed Zhokaii! A black wind to sweep
over all of Norrath! You are the blood seeker Zhokaii! You will amass your
horde and serve us well!&quot; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>The faceless paused, then continued. &quot;But Zhokaii, first you must
complete a task that will both prove your loyalty to darkness unwavering and
also further the means of darkness in ways I will not yet reveal.&quot; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>With out leaving her knees or even raising her eyes to her lord, Zhokaii
quickly replied, &quot;Zhokaii weell serve darknezz well oh Mighty Cazic Thule!
can Zhokaii prove her loyaltiez to her lord?&quot; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Zhokaii, whilst still kneeling, head bowed, could not see her dark lord but
she felt him smiling upon her. &quot;You must first put an end to your lover
Cho'gall. While feared he is, he is too stubborn and foolish to accept you as
my prophet Zhokaii. He will seek to discredit you to stop you from leaving
Grobb. Such is his way. This is your first task Zhokaii.&quot; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Zhokaii, still with head bowed, hastily replied &quot;Zhokaii weell do thiz
fer you my dark lord.&quot; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Cazic thule, still grinning then said &quot;Zhokaii, you are with child. Your
son will not be the son of Cho'gall Warfist, but the son of Innoruuk, the
Prince of Hate.&quot; If she dared look up, she'd have seen Innoruuk wearing a
mischevious and hateful grin. A grin that gave away the carnage the dark gods
forsaw coming of this. Cazic Thule continued &quot;You will travel to a hidden
temple of Innoruuk, it is there you will give birth to your son, and it is
there that you will leave him to be raised. You shall not fear that he will not
learn your shaman ways, as we will see to it that he becomes a shaman of
Innoruuk like never before seen. When he is of age, fate will lead him to you.
You will not reveal this secret to him, but you will be proud as you watch him
earn the fear and respect of all of your followers with out bearing your surname.
This will also serve to protect the child of Innoruuk, as should your enemies
know of your son and heir, they will surely hunt him down and slay him. When
the child of Innoruuk grows to match your power, he shall take your seat as
Warlord Zhokaii. This will seal the pact of darkness. Do you understand
Zhokaii?&quot; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>&quot;Yez'm my dark lord. Yez'm. These thingz Zhokaii weell do. Zhokaii will
make you proud!&quot; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Cazic thule nodded, content with the response he heard a thousand years
before she spoke. &quot;Once you have done these things Zhokaii, you will be my
prophet, you will need not await my word to amass your Bloodhorde.&quot; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>That very night Cho'gall Warfist died by the dark magic of Zhokaii. She wept
over his corpse, before consuming it so that he may always be with her. And the
day did come that her child Runja had matched her power, and it was then that
Zhokaii shared with her son the secrets of his existence. It was then that
Runja took the feared surname of her mother, Blackblood. It was then that
Zhokaii amassed her horde and announced that her heir, Runja Blackblood, would
take her throne and position as Warlord of the Bloodhorde, thus sealing the
pact of the dark gods. Zhokaii would forever sit beside her son, and be known
as the dark prophet. <o:p></o:p></p>

horde by the demand of Zhokaii Blackblood, Warlord of the Bloodhorde</i></b> <o:p></o:p></p>
