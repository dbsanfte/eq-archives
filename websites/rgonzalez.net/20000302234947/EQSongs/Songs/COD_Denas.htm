I would like to make special mention of this song as it is frequently
discarded by young bards (myself included).&nbsp; When you find out that without
the lute, it only does 2 points of damage per tick, it is easy to dismiss
it.&nbsp; But, at level 2, I had not come to grips with the fact that all bardic
abilities are a &quot;slow-burn&quot; type of thing.&nbsp; 2 points per tick -- 6 points
total is an immense amount of damage against a level 2 mob.&nbsp; If only I had
known.

This song also represents a young bards first opportunity to learn:

a)&nbsp; how to use area effects and not die.
b)&nbsp; How to twist in combat.

I highly recommend that all bards immediately practice twisting at level 2.
AT level 7 (or whenever you get the stringed skill) [lvl 8 -R], a young bard should also
start practicing the advanced tactic of switching weapons/instruments during
Melee.&nbsp; An appropriate twist -- and extremely powerful is:

Jonathons / melee weapon
Chords / Lute
Hymn / melee

Not only will this twist GREATLY increase the efficacy of a young bard, it
will also prepare them later in life where such things separate out the
masters from the amateurs.

I post this obvious information because, at level 2, it wasn't obvious to me
and I foolishly wrote off this song all the way until level 18 where the
Chords/DDD twist got my attention again.&nbsp; Oh, if only I had known.
