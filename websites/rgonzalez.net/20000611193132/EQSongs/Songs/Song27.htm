<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#FF9933">SOLON's SONG OF THE SIRENS<!--mstheme--></font></h2>
<p>Level: 27</p>
<p>Effect: Charm</p>
<p>Skill: Wind</p>
<p>Target: Single</p>
<p>Location: Kelethin</p>
<p>Does not stack with: Enchanter's mesmerize line of spells</p>
<p>Taunt: Very high</p>
<p>Quantified: Charms the target turning it into your pet for anywhere from 0 to about 15 seconds.  Using a wind instrument has an unknown effect,
if any.&nbsp; This song is <u>highly</u> dependent on your charisma.</p>
<p>Analysis by Kaearia &lt;Platinum Sphere> Karana server:</p>
<p>Comments: This song will revitalize your ability to solo.  At this level nearly anything that isn't green to you will tear you to shreds with
their overpowered melee capability (thanks Verant) if you try to fight them with
your now-pathetic melee skills.  You know what I'm talking about - casting mobs that are nearly impossible to interrupt, casting mobs that double
attack for 40+ damage, mobs that backstab with their fists, etc.  This song lets you turn a mob's overpowered attacks against its comrades
instead of against you or your party.  Used smartly, you can avoid taking any damage at all.<br>
Your new pet seems to default to a "follow me" and "guard me" state. This has both advantages and disadvantages.  Pet commands start with "/pet"
followed by the actual command.  Useful commands are "attack", "back off" (to stop it from attacking a party member), "sit down" (just fun to see
some things sit), "guard here" (if you don't want it to move from a spot), and "follow me" and "guard me" for impressing others by having
the feared mob call you master.  :-)</p>

When a mob becomes uncharmed, it and whatever it was fighting will all charge
    and attack you.  So it pays to recharm the mob as quickly as possible. Charm, order it to attack, then BACK OFF.  The song has a
    tremendous range so you want to be far enough away to give yourself plenty of time to
    recharm as your former pet and the mob it was fighting both charge you. Given enough open space or a long enough hallway, it is possible to
    completely avoid taking damage while using this song.<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>

Immediately after re/charming your pet (and making sure it's attacking
    the right target), start up another song.  If your charm lasts the full duration, shortly after your other song pulses twice the charm will
    expire.  You can use this to recharm the mob almost instantly with a bit of practice.  You probably don't want to cut it too close though, since
    if you're early, the mob will uncharm right after your song pulses, meaning it will beat on you for a full song-start-up cycle.<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>

That means you can leave your pet targeted and
    concentrate on other songs instead of retargeting and re-ordering it to attack.  I
    usually heal (Hymn) or prepare to run (Accelerando) while the pet is busy attacking.  If I'm in a group, I may sing some party buff songs.<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>

Because it wipes the hate list of everyone but you, it is guaranteed to
    work if it isn't resisted.  The only exception is if someone is very close to dying, in which case nothing I know of (short of healing the person)
    can get mobs off him.  Even orc pawns will attack a high level person who is very close to dying.  Clerics and casters love bards who use this
    song to pull mobs off them.<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>

Casters tend to stand their ground and nuke you instead of walking into the deathtrap your party
    has set up for it.  If you charm a caster and tell it to "follow me", it will
    happily follow you right into your party's blades.  Make sure your party is aware that you're charming it, otherwise they may waste mana trying

    several cancels without it going aggro on him.  This doesn't work so well with
    casting mobs since they usually just rebuff themselves.  I suppose you could do try using this to drain their mana (cancel tends to be a cheap

    would not recommend using charmed mobs to kill named mobs, unless you make it clear to your group to let the pet make the kill.  Sometimes I'll
    order a pet to attack a different target every time I recharm it.  That way it
    softens up the horde of mobs, without doing enough damage to any specific one to steal the kill.  You get Pixie Strike next level, which is
