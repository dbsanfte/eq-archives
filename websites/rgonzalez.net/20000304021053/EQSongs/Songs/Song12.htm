<p>Analysis by Kaearia &lt;Platinum Sphere> Karana server:</p>
<p>Comments: Basically a bard's version of kick.  It's a little extra damage you can apply at the cost of giving up one of your songs.  It
is rarely resisted by anything that isn't red, but the higher the monster /cons, the less damage the song will do on average.  Against
low reds, it's not unusual for the song to do just 1 point of damage when not resisted.  The damage and resistance rate also seems to vary
between mobs of the same level, probably depending on the mob's magic resist.</p>
<p>Strategies:</p>

Ideally these should be rooted or snared, but sometimes it
    just doesn't work out that way.  Due to Internet latency, it can be  difficult for you to stay in melee range; and in twisty dungeons a
    caster might not be able to stop to cast while keeping line of sight with the mob.  But you can chase mobs through twists and turns while  hitting them with this song, as long as you have clear line of sight  when the song fires (doesn't matter when it's started).<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>

Have Accelerando running, hit your pull with this song, turn and run and  start up Accelerando again at the same time.  You should be able to  do this fast enough that you don't slow down at all.<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>

As  long as you began in a straight line between the mob and your party,
    the mob will not get within melee range during the trip back.  It will however stay in Bellow range (which would not be the case if
    you'd used Accelerando).  So you can Bellow it continuously as you  bring it back to your party.  Beware that the damage from this will  make the mob more angry at you, and it'll be harder for your party
    to pull it off you.<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>

A lot of non-bards complain about grouping with a bard who does nothing but bellow.  This song  has the same effect whether you're solo or in a full group.  Most of  our other songs have an increased effect in a group (since it  affects more people).  Buffing your tanks and increasing everyone's  magic resist can easily outweigh the benefit of the extra damage you  can do with Bellow.&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>

Personally I'd rate it  as low, but a lot of people complain that this song seems to attract  other mobs in dungeons.  My opinion is that this song is the first  ranged attack available to most bards (having neglected throwing
    knives), and thus they're not used to a ranged attack drawing  multiple critters that are within aggro radius of each other.  And  so they're wrongly attributing the trains caused by their  inexperience to a perceived taunt effect of this song.  Whatever the  cause, it can be dangerous until you learn the hang of it so perhaps
    a moderate taunt rating is appropriate.<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>
