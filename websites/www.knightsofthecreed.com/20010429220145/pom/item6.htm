      <p>Found by Merloc of the guild Tindi'Losi on The Rathe server</p>
      <p>This item was created using the following PoM card combination:</p>
      <p><b><font size="5">Red Throne, Blue Throne, Blue Crown, Blue Knight</font></b></p>
      <p><font size="5">Identifies as: Piety before greed</font></p>
      <p>These are combined in the Deck of Spontaneous Generation. This is a
      container that holds 4 slots and is obtained by saying the phrase
      &quot;take turn&quot; to the female halfling vendor in Rivervale, at the
      fruit stand in the garden. She gives you a &quot;sack of turnips&quot;.
      You then give that to the NPC in PoM &quot;Ferjeneror&quot; and he gives you the
      Deck of Spontaneous Generation container. The cards are found by killing
      NPC's throughout PoM. The &quot;Throne&quot; cards seem to be coming from
      the &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; area. Other cards are obtained by
      killing different NPC's throughout the zone. </td>
