      <p>This item was created using the following PoM card combination:</p>
      <p><b><font size="5">Black Throne, Blue Throne, Blue Crown, Blue Knight</font></b></p>
      <p><font size="5">Identifies as: Big small in between</font></p>
      <p>These are combined in the Deck of Spontaneous Generation. This is a
      container that holds 4 slots and is received by obtaining a King Cod Card,
      found on &quot;Dinner&quot; NPC, or fishing.
      You then give that to the NPC in PoM &quot;Ferjeneror&quot; and he gives you the
      Deck of Spontaneous Generation container. The cards are found by killing
      NPC's throughout PoM. The &quot;Throne&quot; cards seem to be coming from
      the &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; area. Other cards are obtained by
      killing different NPC's throughout the zone. </td>
