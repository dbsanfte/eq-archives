      <p>You must first get a library card dropped by NPCs in PoM. You then turn
      it into The Librarian in the Library, who gives you a &quot;Book of
      Mischief&quot; 4 slot container. You then must get the four corners of the
      missing page found on NPCs thoughout the PoM. Once combined they form
      &quot;Words of Weath&quot;. You turn in your &quot;Words of Wealth&quot;
      to &quot;Bob The Painter&quot; who will give you a &quot;Pot of
      Gold&quot;, 2 slot container. You then must create more words of wealth
      and items form the Cards Quest By combining &quot;Words of Wealth&quot;
      with any 2 Throne Card Quest item (including Mask of Melodies - only 1
      card quest that combines) you receive Funny Money. When you turn in 2
      Funny Money to Peaches at the entrance to the PoM castle you will receive
      a Gift Box (each Gift Box is colored, 1 for each class) which has 5
      Charges of gift. When right-clicked you produce a Doll (each doll is named
      for each class). When this Doll is combined with the 5 main Armor of
      Distraction types (Gloves, Breastplate, Legs, Arms, Feet) you get the
      Class Specific Doll Quest Armor specific. </td>
