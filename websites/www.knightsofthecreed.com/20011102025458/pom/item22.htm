      MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>
      Slot: PRIMARY SECONDARY RANGE<br>
      Skill: Piercing Atk Delay: 23<br>
      DMG: 12<br>
      STR: +10 SV DISEASE: -10<br>

      <p>Found by Merloc of the guild Tindi'Losi on The Rathe server</p>
      <p>This item was created using the following PoM card combination:</p>
      <p><b><font size="5">Black Throne, Black Crown, White Throne, White Crown&nbsp;</font></b></p>
      <p><font size="5">Identifies as:&nbsp;its quite dangerous.</font></p>
      <p>These are combined in the Deck of Spontaneous Generation. This is a
      container that holds 4 slots and is received by obtaining a King Cod Card,
      found on &quot;Dinner&quot; NPC, or fishing.
      You then give that to the NPC in PoM &quot;Ferjeneror&quot; and he gives you the
      Deck of Spontaneous Generation container. The cards are found by killing
      NPC's throughout PoM. The &quot;Throne&quot; cards seem to be coming from
      the &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; area. Other cards are obtained by
      killing different NPC's throughout the zone. </td>
