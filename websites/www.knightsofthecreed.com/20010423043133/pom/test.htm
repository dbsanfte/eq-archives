      trying to figure out puzzles 8-(<p align="left">Special thanks to the guy
      on the test server who gave us these pics and had this to say ...<p align="left"><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">I
      also noticed that Donk and Eightysix were back, but I didn't want to risk
      attacking them.<br>

      Good luck all, hope we solve some of these puzzles soon !<br>

      And say goodbye to the PoM we had all come to know. The second one of
      those petals attacks me at my bind spot in the courtyard, I'll just go afk
      for a few hours. A death loop back to level 1 should be a fitting end in
      Mischief. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) -->

      I'm glad Verant consults those of us who actually know the zone... Rather
      mind boggling the things they do, but hey, that's Verant for you. I'm sure
      all the NPCs have been upgraded to 60+ and flurry for 500 now. *sighs*
