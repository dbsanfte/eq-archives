    <td width="129%"><p align="left">Basic Strategy: Use a Monk with a Rez Stick
      to Sneak / FD and drag a CoH Mage corpse to PoM enterance and Rez.<p align="left">Classes
      Needed:&nbsp; Monk (runner), Mage (CoH corpse), Cleric (Rez / Buff), Necro
      (Summon), Shaman (Buff / SoW)<p align="left">*******************************************************************************************<p align="left">This
      is the beginning of how to make your way through ToV (without killing all
      NPCs) to get to the PoM entrance. First use a CoV faction Mage to CoH an
      FD Monk past Arreken Skyward and cast invisibility on him. Or if the Monk
      is CoV faction you can just run up to the NORTH entrance door and have
      someone cast invisibility on the monk. Past the first door of NORTH ToV,
      everything appears to be KoS to everyone, including CoV faction people.
      The first section (top 3 pictures) you can go through with invisibility on
      as long as you don't run into any roamers. There is also a see-inv NPC
      (top - center picture) that is on the far left wall, but can be avoided by
      going straight down the center of the hall to the second door. Once past
      the second door go straight down the hall past the hatchlings and up the
      ramp to the right (still ok with just invisibility on) and head down the
      hall toward <a href="http://www.swtoys.net/pom/aaryonar.html">Aaryonar</a>.
      This is the first named of 5 that you must pass. He and his guards see
      invisible. You can run up and FD past a small ledge and veer toward the
      right up the stairs. Now you can Sneak / FD your way following the right
      wall past a firepot and named guard Nir' Tan, (center - center picture).
      Then follow the right wall toward a large rock (center - right picture).
      Be careful as there are 2 see invisible Drakes just past the rock on the
      right.<p align="left">*******************************************************************************************<p align="left">This
      was sent to me to help ppl get to PoM. The author is anon atm ... but ok'd
      it's release. So thank you 8-)<p align="left">&quot;When you get to
      Aaryonar, you can just sneak past that drake by the fire pot.&nbsp; Just
      make sure you are clear of wanderers...there are a couple that path by
      here.&nbsp; So once u sneak by that black drake by the pot, you will see a
      large boulder by the wall...it's in the left side of the 6th pic on your
      new page.&nbsp; With sneak up you can climb up this boulder and be behind
      the 2 drakes along the wall...you can keep sneaking by them and up the
      next boulder thats at the opening to the cubby with the big yellow dragon
      in there.&nbsp; Wanderers everywhere so be careful. Once at the top of
      this boulder you will have a good perch to scope things out...but kinda
      high up so you might get ghosting so be careful.&nbsp; So you can get from
      Aaryonar to this point with sneak ONLY...as long as there are no
      wanderers....so you'll still need to use feign to wait for the wanderers.<br>
      <br>
      Ok so now to get by the cubby with the yellow dragon.&nbsp; This cubby has
      the big yellow dragon, like 2 static guards by him and a static guard at
      the opening to the cubby. You'll have to feign flop past this part till
      you are out of LoS of the yellow dragon. Keeping your eye out for
      wanderers you can sneak up to the corner before dagarn the destroyer.
      Above you there will be a static perched on a ledge and right below that
      another static. You can sneak up to close to under this ledge but he will
      see you so you need to feign flop from here till you get past the
      destroyer.<br>
      <br>
      On the far end of the destroyer cubby there is a static, once you are
      behind this static you can do alot of sneaking. You can sneak all the way
      up to the cave portion.&nbsp; Before the cave portion there will be a
      raised platform with 2 drakes on it...i was able to sneak around the front
      of the raised platform without those 2 drakes seeing me even though i was
      walking right in front of them basically.&nbsp; Only reason i didn't sneak
      behind them is the raised portion they are on is too high to jump onto so
      i had to go around the front.<p align="left"><br>
      Once in the cave portion you can sneak up to the apex of the path till you
      find 2 drakes faceing each other...no way past this sept feign flop.&nbsp;&quot;<p align="left">This
      will bring you to the final stretch to PoM, and it's thought that either
      Evasion or Maybe DA Idol is the best way for the final run down the hall
      ...&nbsp;<p align="left">*******************************************************************************************<p align="left">I'm
      just starting to do this run and am trying not to use Invulnerability
      Idols (I have one .. just not using it yet) and trying to just use Sneak /
      FD as I've been told it can be done this way. As I progress I will post strategies here and let
      you know.<p align="left">&nbsp;Well Castrinas and myself made the PoM run finally. The last
      part is filled with lots of casters and SK's. My suggestion is to use a DA
      idol to do this last section of the hallway, although Castrinas made it
      without SoW and without any Disc or DA Idol, but it seems to take a lil
      luck at the end if you dont use a DA Idol. Castrinas and I had 3 bugged
      corpses last attempt, so be warned and try not to leave corpses in wall,
      etc .. 8-)<p align="left">*******************************************************************************************<p align="left">Another
      strategy was posted and here it is:<p align="left">&quot;Well using your
      guide i found my way there, but if you want to be sucessful<br>
      alot easier heres how its done<br>
      2 Shiny Brass Idols, and Buff order<br>
      Poison, Coldain Ring, Cold, Fire, Dex, Agil, Sta, Kraag, Aegolism, Rune V,<br>
      Bedlam, Avatar, Regen, Sow, Invis<br>
      <br>
      CoH mage / corpse,&nbsp; Run to the first See invis KoS &quot;elder
      wyvern&quot; I<br>
      believe, and use idol, run past Aayorana, and to the LEFT, training him to<br>
      an unused area, FD before the Invul wears off, have mage coh, rebuff, get<br>
      second idol from group mate.<br>
      Next, run with invis to Aayorana's hall, the 2 guards at the base of his<br>
      stairs see invis, but with sow, you can haul ass past em, and veer right,<br>
      you will be able to get to the top of the stairs and past the firepot
      before<br>
      they are aggrod on you.<br>
      FD there, wait for em to return to thier spots, then stand, run, use
      second<br>
      divine idol, and run, youll be at the ent to the tunnel where the roaming<br>
      drakes are, hang out there till mend pops, if you used it, and move down<br>
      JUST using mend and FD flopping till your at the corner where you will see<br>
      the wurm guarding the ent to PoM.<br>
      Stand (when your full life) pop voiddance, and walk your way home.&nbsp;
      Dont<br>
      forget the mage corpse like i did when i was happy i had finally got there<br>
