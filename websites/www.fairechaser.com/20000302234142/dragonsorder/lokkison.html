<br>Lokkison says, 'Listen up and listen good'
<br>You say, 'Nor can I talk.'

<br>Lokkison says, 'You are frozen'
<br>Wolfen says, 'I'm logging this entire event'
<br>You say, 'Can I put my '
<br>You say, 'Manstone away?'
<br>Lokkison says, 'I am going to explain this to you all so you understand exactly what is going on'
<br>Lokkison says, 'It is not your jobs to decide when and why a zone needs to be repopped'
<br>Lokkison says, 'you are not qualified to do so.'
<br>Lokkison says, 'you have no idea how this game works and why we would need to do something'
<br>Lokkison says, 'It is not my job to explain to you why I do what I do'
<br>Lokkison says, 'My job is to fix problems with the game'
<br>Veny says, 'in that case, we have a problem'
<br>Lokkison says, 'I am now wasting my very valuable time explaining this to a group of immature individuals who want to spout off thinking they are "in the know"'
<br>Lokkison says, 'Yes you do have a problem ..'
<br>Wolfen says, 'I have no problem with you needing to repop the zone.'
<br>Veny says, 'we can no longer play tonight becuase we are stuck in a room fiukk of fish'
<br>Wolfen says, 'my problem is your attitude towards us'
<br>Veny says, 'full of fish'
<br>Lokkison says, 'Wolfen, my attitude towards you is
directly related to your treatment of me'
<br>Veny says, 'all we said was that repopping the zone left no consideration for us'
<br>Lokkison says, 'I didnt ask for your opinions, I gave you warning that the zone was going to be repopped, I dont repop zones on a whim'
<br>Wolfen says, 'I did nothing to you annd you came and insulted us...'
<br>Lokkison says, 'I dont care about considerations'
<br>Lokkison says, 'the zone was broken and needed to be fixed'
<br>Lokkison says, 'bottom line'
<br>Veny says, 'you obviously considered there feelings otherwise you would not have repopped the zone'
<br>Lokkison says, 'Just because your particular corner was ok .. does not mean that the rest was'
<br>Serieux says, 'what about the fgs in solb today gms repoperd for the same guild?'
<br>Lokkison says, 'you guys are being selfish and cras'
<br>Lokkison says, 'I had nothing to do with that .. and I have no idea why that was done'
<br>Lokkison says, 'but '
<br>Lokkison says, 'In kedge'
<br>Lokkison says, 'I didnt repop "for them" '
<br>Lokkison says, 'I tried to do what I could to not have to repop it'
<br>Lokkison says, 'I realized that if I had just /killed the stuck mobs '
<br>Nabben tells you, 'Hello Apenance, Guide Nabben repsonding to your petition'
<br>Lokkison says, 'as your so vocal friend here suggested. '
<br>Nabben tells you, 'the repop was well warned and needed as the zone was buged'
<br>Lokkison says, 'I would have had to clear far too many mobs out of the zone .. thus making it easier for that other group '
<br>Lokkison says, 'and that is not fair'
<br>Lokkison says, 'You guys have no idea how many mobs were clustered'
<br>Lokkison says, 'now'
<br>Lokkison says, 'next thing to talk about is this'
<br>Veny says, 'so you fixed thier problem by creating one for us, can you kno now help us fix ours?'
<br>Lokkison says, 'just because you are customers does not mean you can treat us with dissrespect'
<br>Lokkison says, 'I will not stand for it'
<br>Veny says, 'i think that goes both ways'
<br>Veny says, 'you were most disrespeactful'
<br>Lokkison says, 'I agree Veny'
<br>Lokkison says, 'but '
<br>Lokkison says, 'I give respect where I get it'
<br>Lokkison says, 'I certainly dont respect you when you disrespect me first'
<br>Wolfen says, 'did we insult you in any way? did we call you names? I remember you insulting us ... I have both the text logs and screen shots of it.'
<br>Serieux says, 'as do i, maybe we didnt start out on the best of terms in that case'
<br>Lokkison says, 'obviously not '
<br>Lokkison says, 'that is why I brought you here for this pow wow'
<br>Lokkison says, 'I am not a bad guy'
<br>Lokkison says, 'I am not some malicious GM that does things as favors'
<br>Lokkison says, 'No GMs are'
<br>Lokkison says, 'if they were .. they wouldnt be GMs for long'
<br>Lokkison says, 'But you guys have to realize that we
cant always explain every little detail about why we do what we do'
<br>Lokkison says, 'if I didnt have to repop the zone .. I wouildnt have'
<br>Lokkison says, 'that is all you guys need to know '
<br>Serieux says, 'just seemed a bit fishy, that they had firegiants, then moved to kedge and another gm came :?'
<br>Lokkison says, 'and you should understand that'
<br>Lokkison says, 'I know nothing about SolB today'
<br>Lokkison says, 'that is a completely unrelated incident'
<br>Lokkison says, 'and I assure you that it had nothing to do with why I repopped Kedge'
<br>Veny says, 'so back to our original question, since you popped the zone for them can you help us break the spawn again? that is what we asked int he first place. we stated how the repop was going to affect us and asked how you could fix it'
<br>Lokkison says, 'if you had asked in the same manner then as you do now .. we wouldnt be here'
<br>Lokkison says, 'but the way the conversation started ... there was no way I was going to help you'
<br>Lokkison says, 'now'
<br>Veny says, 'i dont believe that the tone of our resquests was that bad to begin with'
<br>Veny says, 'you can understand that we were angry about the repop right?'
<br>Lokkison says, 'if you guys want to .. we can agree that this is settled and we all understand eachother'
<br>Lokkison says, 'I may be willing to help you break that room again safely'
<br>Lokkison says, 'Apenance, you are no longer silenced by the way'
<br>Lokkison says, 'does that sound reasonable?'
<br>Serieux says, 'sounds okay to mee, think we got off to a bad start is all'
<br>You say, 'Personally, I spoke nonoffenceive the first 3 teims I tried to inform you we cvoouldnt get out.'
<br>You say, 'And if they spoawned on us, we surely would die.'
<br>You say, 'And not having backspance is aggitating...;)'
<br>Lokkison says, 'but they didnt and you didnt'
<br>You say, 'We hid.'
<br>You say, 'Luckyly.'
<br>Lokkison says, 'in the amount of time we were there until we came here'
<br>Wolfen says, 'What I want to know is y  why you is insulted us. ?'
<br>Lokkison says, 'wolfen, you can take what I said as
an insult.. only if what I said were true'
<br>You say, 'Aye, there was no need for thsat I did not attacki you in anyway.'
<br>Lokkison says, 'yes you did Apenance'
<br>You say, 'Again, that is backhanded.'
<br>Wolfen says, 'calling us Crappy Assed Customers was totally uncalled for?'
<br>Lokkison says, 'yes it s'
<br>You say, 'Then what is your justifcation?'
<br>You told Nabben, 'I wouldnt mind a nother gm monitoring what Lookson is doing to us.'
<br>Lokkison says, 'I called you guys whiners .. and told you not to complain'
<br>You say, 'Yes, and that is acceptable?'
<br>Wolfen says, 'Excuse me but I have a screen shot of what you called us.'
<br>Lokkison says, 'now we can go back and forth about who said what .. I have my logs .. you have yours .. it is irrelevant'
<br>Lokkison says, 'bottom line is this'
<br>You say, 'I merelyt informed you we could not depart, as you asked.'
<br>Lokkison says, 'I can drop you off in Cauldron... wave good bye  and you do what you want '
<br>You say, 'And you attacked.'
<br>Lokkison says, 'or I can take you back to kedge and help you break that spawn'
<br>Lokkison says, 'Not true Apenance'
<br>Lokkison says, 'You attacked my decision making ability and my GM ability'
<br>You say, 'The 5th or so ooc was desperate.'
<br>Lokkison says, 'accused me of favoritism and much worse'
<br>You say, 'What?'
<br>Veny says, 'his first ooc was then can you tp us out of here and help us break thae spawn again?'
<br>Lokkison says, 'ok find'
<br>You say, 'I think you mistoke me for someone else.'
<br>Lokkison says, 'I dotn think so'
<br>You say, 'I watch my words areound authority.'
<br>Lokkison says, 'but I am done wasting my time'
<br>You say, 'Thank you,'
<br>You have been summoned by the gods!
<br>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...
<br>You have entered Dagnor's Cauldron.
<br>
<br>This is a convesation held in tells between myself (Veny) and one of the guides during the incident.
<br>
<br>You told Tarskok, "You think this is fair?"
<br>Tarskok tells you, "Let me explain..."
<br>Tarskok tells you, "He is a GM."
<br>Tarskok tells you, "I am a guide."
<br>Tarskok tells you, "If he says something, right now, it's a rule I have to follow"
<br>You told Tarskok, "He has the power to call us names and kick us offline for stating our opinions rationally?"
<br>Tarskok tells you, "I will report what happened here, and hand it to my superiors."
<br>Tarskok tells you, "It will be their decision - I will simply tell them what I saw."
<br>Tarskok tells you, "Listen... Sigh..."
<br>Tarskok tells you, "I am being put in a rock and a hard place."
<br>Tarskok tells you, "I am going to offer no opinion on this situation either way."
