      <h2> North Temple of Veeshan, Day #2... </h2>
      <p>After killing Aaryonar for the first time as well as putting down a few 
        more NToV named the day before, we ventured father and farther and got 
        a chance to get &quot;up close and personal&quot; with a few more NToV

<h2>North Temple of Veeshan... </h2>
<p>In spite of not having a uber primal equiped force, we pushed our way to entrance 
to NToV to give Aaryonar a real shot after having slight argo problems due to 
the patch the day before. After wasting more then a hour of time (time that I 
will never get back) in mediation for who will get the first shot at Aary, we 
finally got things moving.</p>
<h2>Buffing, a three hour tour....</h2>
<p>While buffing and waiting for our linkdead peeps, Eashen of the Sky decided 
to grace us with his presence, so we put him down.</p>

<h2>That Aaryonar just drains on you....</h2>
<p>After buffing and knocking out the chickens, we pulled Aaryonar, and beat him 
down with a virtually flawless vicotry. The fight was long, everyone did their 
jobs, and no one screwed up. Mucho props to everyone that was there!</p>

a guild, waxed some flurry drakes, and oh ya, a few other important folks.</p>

<h2>Patch Day! ooooh, that argo!</h2>
<p>We were looking forward to a relativley fun day as always due to the patch. 
Our fun was spoiled as the Lead GM's re-popped all of the zones due to issues 
with items having incorrect stats. After this there was not much up. We did get 
a painful win over Eashen of the Sky, and boy was it painful, thanks to issues 
with maintaining argo.</p>

<h2>Sunday, SUNDAY, SUNDAYYYY!!!....</h2>
<p>What seemed to be the end of a utterly borring and ridiculously un-eventful 
weekend, there was a hint of some mobs up. We started it off by wacking Zlandicar 
who dropped some nice loots for us.</p>
<p><img src="zland6.jpg" width="244" height="183"></p>

<h2>Ding! Dong! The Dain is dead!</h2>
<p>Hearing that King Dain Frostreaver IV was up while we were on our escapade 
of killing Zlandicar, we rolled in and dropped a house on his ass (house, Roggel.. 
you get the picture).</p>

<h2>Break camp... oh wait what about Rumblecrush, Doomshade, Donkey, Vinidi.....</h2>
<p>After breaking camp and sending everyone on their merry way to eat in real 
life, experience/AA, or bake cookies (more meat pies Alueriniel.. pls thx), it 
was learned that there were more mobs looking for a beatdown. We quickly regrouped 
to kick some ass.</p>

<p>Because of the way we rolled over and crushed mobs, and it was Sunday, these 
kills deserve a dedication to then no other then that of the classic &quot;Moster 
Truck Events&quot;. We were the BigFoot of Norath today!</p>

<p>This was the song that members were humming while we all were sitting on our 
thumbs in Plane of Fear waiting on Cazic Thule to spawn. After hours and hours 
of waiting past his spawn time, and a unexplained &quot;repop&quot; in front of 
us, he never showed. We did pop Dracholiche in the chops for a belt, which was 
the only decent score of the day, but hardly worth the time.</p>

      <p>Yeah, lame pun but I honestly can't think of anything remotely funny 
        to post other then this. In our weeking rounds, Lendiniara the Keeper

      <p>Plane of Fear you say? After knocking out one of our favorite dragon 
        in WTOV, we took a stroll into the old world to get our first guild shot 
        at the master of fear itself, Cazic Thule. After a plowing for a few hours 
        to kill every mob in the plane, and a few complicatins on the first pull, 
        we punked him and punked him hard. (1-1)</p>

        cast damage shield a on the group that our monk was pulling for on the 
        incomming, and got litteraly ass raped by the Statue. I still think that 
        somehow I should be able to blame this on Dabamf's inept monk skills for 
        not being Feign Death, but whatever. We took the statue with no contest.

      <p><strong>Ssareahza is on the Rhag...</strong></p>
      <p>Word was out that the Rhag's were up in Ssareahza Temple so we mobilized 
        to take them out. It has been a while since we even had the chance to 
        kill them, let alone a second guild-only chance at Rhag Mozdezh. We gave 
        them both a good punking in what I believe were flawless victories!</p>

      <p>While I am quite sure I won't be able to match the witicism (is that 
        a word?) of the famous Ciliem Sitewrita, I will do my best to keep things 
        updated on a regular basis.</p>

      <h2><strong>Lions, Tigers, and Dragons ... oh my</strong></h2>
      <p>We decided to stop by and pay a friendly visit to our old pal Gozzrem, 
        who wasn't interested in smalltalk, so we ended the relationship. (6-3)</p>

      <p>It's been a while since we had a chance to witness the bad breath of 
        Trakanon, but we had members needing teeth for their Veshan's Peak keys. 
        After getting impatient, we decided to just pull him to the cave rather 
        then waiting on the juggs. Manaburn = thx!</p>

      <p><strong>Eashen of the Sky with diamonds</strong></p>
      <p>Once again we plowed out way into very start of North TOV. Eashen and 
        Ikatiar offered us little resistance for our forces. We missed our window 
        at Aary, raid forces were dwindlin due to people needing sleep (??), so 
        we will save him for a rainy day.</p>

      <p><strong>Drive-by gankin!</strong></p>
      <p>With a few people left we did a quick drive-by on Telkorenar, knowing 
        that he was up and a easy kill. (4-2)</p>

      <p>Wow. After doing that update I now realize I have alot of hard work ahead 
        of me. Because of this I think it would be only best that we dedicate 
        these kills to the men that made Appotus Dominus possible, you will be 
        remembered!</p>
