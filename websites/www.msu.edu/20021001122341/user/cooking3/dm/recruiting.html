      <h2>Primary Membership Requirements</h2>

      <p>The minimum level limit to join Appotus Dominus is nominally 55. This 

        limit may vary depending on class (please see our Class Restriction and 

        Diesirability List below). The level limit is imposed due to the face 

        that we do not guild people who cannot group or raid with the guild, as 

        this is not fair to either the guild or the prospective member. </p>

      <ol>

        <li>Must be Level 55+<br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li>Must have your Old-Seblis key and actively working on both your Charasis 

          and Veeshan&#146;s Peak keys. <br>

          <br>
        </li>

        <li>Own or have access to an enduring breath device (such as a Fishbone 

          Earring or Aqualung). The reason for this is that zones like Kedge Keep, 

          The Grey, Sirens Grotto, and other epic encounters require these.<br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li>Achieve an unbuffed 100 magic resistance in addition to 100 in either 

          fire resistance, cold resistance or poison resistance with respective 

          resistance equipment. (e.g. Fire resist gear which would include rings, 

          earings, neclace, braclets, etc.)<br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li>Attend guild raids and obtain 25 points from these raids.  This number is subject to change in both directions depending upon timing circumstances, and overall raid attendance.<br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li>Fully agree to the various guild policies such as raid, loot, and 

          membership. Ignorance is not an excuse. If you don't like them, feel 

          free not to join. <br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li>Be a required Class. We recruit for a guild balance, so not all classes 

          have openings all the time. See our class level requirement and desirability 

          list below. <br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li>Members are recruited for their primary character and are expected 

          to play these most of the time, feel free to play an alternate character, 

          but they will not be guilded unless both the primary and secondary characters 

          meet the requirements from alternate characters section listed below.<br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li>Keep your Magelo (<a href="http://www.magelo.com">www.magelo.com</a>) 

          profile updated on a regular basis.</li>

      </ol>

      <p>Please note that this list is subject to change, and is not a strict 

        guideline of AD's recruiting policy. Please note that the level requirements 

        are <b>minimum</b> level that we would accept in each class. </p>

      <h2>Joining the Guild</h2>

      <p>In order to achieve these aims, and avoid the mistakes of many other 

        guilds, we have a fairly strict and somewhat slow recruitment policy. 

        However it is done for a reason, as we do not want to recruit the wrong 

        people, and experience has shown that the right people are willing to 

        wait, and go to that extra effort required. All recruitment is administered 

        by the officers in charge of recruitment and is a 4 step process. </p>

      <p>Step 1. Application to Join</p>

      <p>In Order to submit an application for membership to the guild, you must: 

      </p>

      <ol>

        <li>Meet the membership requirements <br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li>Be officially sponsored by at least 2 active members who are currently 

          in good standing with the rest of the guild. It is YOUR responsibility 

          to talk to existing members, and obtain sponsors, not the guilds. <br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li>Post your application on our message board, including why you wish 

          to join, and who will sponsor you. </li>

      </ol>

      <p>This application is reviewed by the guild recruitment officers, and a 

        decision made weather to accept it, reject it at this time, or delay decision. 

        You will be contacted by one of the officers in charge of recruitment 

        and told the result. </p>

      <p>Step 2. Evaluation period</p>

      <p>If your initial application is accepted, you will start an evaluation 

        period. During this time you will have similar privileges, as well as 

        guild expectations as a guild member as regard to raid attendance, groups, 

        etc. It is expected that during this time, associate members will actively 

        seek out guild members for groups and at the same time, guild members 

        will actively invite associate members so each can evaluate the other. 

        During the evaluation, each recruit will have a thread started on the 

        Guild Applicants Discussion forum, so members can discuss them, post comments, 

        and offer there support for them. You are expected to raid with the guild 

        exactly the same as a member. The officer keep a list on raid attendance 

        and this will be used to evaluate attendance.</p>

      <p>Depending on the person, this period may be waived entirely or very short 

        and voting may start immediately on the person&#146;s application. However, 

        this will only happen if they are well know and have raided with us often, 

        or perhaps we have a hole with a certain class that needs to be urgently 

        filled, etc and is solely at the discretion and judgment of the recruiting 

        officers and the guild leader. </p>

      <p>Step 3. Guild Vote</p>

      <p>At some stage after your application, request for voting by the guild 

        on the private Applicant Voting Booth forum. Voting is not like an election, 

        certain numbers don't guarantee you will or won't always be accepted, 

        and other factors are still taken into account by the Officers. </p>

      <p>In order to ensure a majority of the guild is happy with a new recruit, 

        voting is as Follows. </p>

      <ol>

        <li>Voting will normally be open up to a week and members may Vote YES, 

          NO, or MORTAL ENEMY. <br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li>A applicant needs 75% of the currently active guild members vote YES 

          to be accepted. (Regardless of how many vote, 75% of the guild). <br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li>Voting *MORTAL ENEMY* is reserved for people that will quit if a person 

          is recruited, or hates them, etc. This MUST be explained to the recruit 

          officers or the guild leader in private however if reasonable, then 

          the application will be rejected. We will NEVER recruit someone that 

          will result in a current guild member quitting. Abuse of this vote just 

          for someone you don't like, but no concrete reason, will not be tolerated, 

          and the vote will be considered as a *No*. This is at the discretion 

          of the recruitment officers and the guild leader, but allows even a 

          single member a strong say in who is recruited. <br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li>Voting is done by Secret Ballot, however voting IS compulsory. 

          <br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li>If there is not enough yes votes then the application will be waived 

          for another few weeks to allow the person to get to know more people, 

          and voted on again. Again, recruiting officers will use their discretion. 

          A recruitment officer will contact you to inform you of the outcome. 

        </li>

      </ol>

      <p>Step 4. Get Invited into the Guild</p>

      <p>How and where this is done will be decided at the time. The ONLY people 

        that can execute a /GUILDINVITE for a person are the recruitment officers 

        and the guild leader, no one else. </p>

      <p>Step 5. Ongoing Membership </p>

      <p>After one month, the officers will revue all new recruits to determine 

        weather they really were suitable for the guild, and the guild for them. 

        Any decisions about continued membership are solely at the discretion 

        of the guild leader. Every member should continually works to earn their 

        guild tag and better the guild. No more or less is expected of new or 

        existing memebrs. </p>

      <h2>Recruitment Officers</h2>

      <p> Currently the recruitment officers are <a href="mailto:dapper@appotusdominus.com">Dapper</a>, 

        <a href="mailto:yamile@appotusdominus.com">Yamile</a>, and <a href="mailto:ciliem@appotusdominus.com">CIliem</a>. 

        Contact one of us in game for further information. </p>

      <h2>Alternate/Secondary Characters</h2>

      <p>It is understandable that members, especially at a high level, need/want 

        to play secondary characters. This provides a number of benefits, including 

        diversity, reducing stress, and any other number of good reasons. That 

        being said, we don&#146;t want a guild full of &#147;Twinks&#148;, nor 

        do we want people playing their alternate characters and not leveling 

        their primary characters. </p>

      <h2>Secondary Character Policy<br>

      </h2>

      <p>All full members of the guild who are level 60 may have one (1) alternate 

        character guilded as well; however the following requirements must be 

        met. </p>

      <ol>

        <li>The primary character must be Level 60. <br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li>The second character must be level 50+. This is somewhat arbitrary 

          level; however it provides a good balance between the effort required 

          to achieve, which shows the character is not just a &#147;Twink&#148;, 

          but is a true, secondary character. <br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li>The Person has been a Guild member for at least 2 weeks. (We want 

          to get to know your primary character in guild chat and have everyone 

          comfortable with them, before adding alternate characters. <br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li>Secondary characters are guilded by the recruitment officers or the 

          guild l leader only and the secondary character information will be 

          noted on the membership roster under your primary character name. <br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li>In order to have your secondary character guilded, please contact 

          a recruit officer in game, and they will be happy to oblige. </li>

      </ol>

      <h2>Leaving / Discharge Policy</h2>

      <p>Managing to get kicked out of Appotus Dominus is fairly hard, but it 

        is doable. Only the guild leader will remove people under advisement from 

        the officers. The process goes.</p>

      <p>&#149; Warning<br>

        &#149; On probation 1-4 weeks.<br>

        &#149; Bye Bye.</p>

      <p>NOTE: De-Guilding as a form of protest over some issue is NOT an acceptable 

        form of protest.</p>

      <h2>Final Note</h2>

      <p>In order to prevent repetition of the mistakes of the past/other guild, 

        this recruitment policy will be adhered to, however is still at the discretion 

        of the officers and guild leader. Guilds are meant to last forever, players 

        come and go, if it takes that little bit extra time to ensure we have 

        the right people, then so be it. We understand we run the risk of loosing 

        potential good players to other guild because they don't want to wait, 

        however we are not here to cater for everyone, but to build up a good, 

        solid guild of loyal, trustworthy friends.</p>
