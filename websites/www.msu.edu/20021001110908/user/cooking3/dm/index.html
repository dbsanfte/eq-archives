      <p>While there wern't many big daddy mobs up this Saturday, we did get a 
        chance to make a quick swoop-in kill on Ikatiar and Eashen. I know your

        make a appearence. No worries, we will get back to our regularly scheduled

      <p>Well, actually, we did, and quite well. Again with little effort Appotus 
        Dominus put Grieg in the dirt. The only real issue was Roggel complaining 
        that he was still snared by Gravel Rain like a hour later... but who listens

      <p>Yeah, lame pun but I honestly can't think of anything remotely funny 
        to post other then this. In our weeking rounds, Lendiniara the Keeper 
        is dead. WTOV dragons are but trivial these days, but still drop loots 
        we can use. Gratz us! (5-1)</p>

      <h2>Phear us, baby!</h2>
      <p>Plane of Fear you say? After knocking out one of our favorite dragon 
        in WTOV, we took a stroll into the old world to get our first guild shot 
        at the master of fear itself, Cazic Thule. After a plowing for a few hours 
        to kill every mob in the plane, and a few complicatins on the first pull, 
        we punked him and punked him hard. (1-1)</p>

      <p>Again, another patch allowed us to take advantage of many mobs being 
        reset and ready for the killing. We started out by making a quick stop 
        with minimal forces in Ssra to off Rhag'Zhezum.</p>

      <p>I was planning to get alot of really nice screenshots but in all the

      <h2>Grieg's End.. of the line!</h2>
      <p>With time to spare for the evening, and named mobs still up, we were 
        dedicated to putting another notch in our belt by killing Grieg and his 
        henchmen once again. With a substantial force and a few mages making many, 
        many, many, many (did I say many?) rods, we were able to punk this bish. 
        Please pay no attention to the numerous people that died to the 50 Hit 
        Point Greig that pops out of the monstrosity. What can I say, he's a fast 
        little bastard!</p>

      <p>No its not some cyber relationship like the title suggest but just the 
        normal dedication portion of our updates. This week, it gives me much 
        privelage to dedicate our kills to the one that has stood by us (litterly)

      <p><strong>Vinidi... dead!</strong></p>
      <p>We started out the evening making a quick stop by Vindi and rubbin' him 
        out. I didn't take any screenshots of loots and probably won't even mention 
        him in future updates because he is becomming a normal encounted. Gratz

      <p>In a classic Yamdown* (see below) maneuver, I pulled a jackass move and 
        cast damage shield a on the group that our monk was pulling for on the 
        incomming, and got litteraly ass raped by the Statue. I still think that 
        somehow I should be able to blame this on Dabamf's inept monk skills for 
        not being Feign Death, but whatever. We took the statue with no contest.

      <p>Being ever interested in expanding our list of accomplishments, and in 
        getting better loot, we got Rumblecrush today. And, with only some minor 
        difficulties we dropped him. It was nice to get vindication after having 
        a previous run in where he touched us off two times. Anyway, a special 
        shout out is due to Topster for hitting the ninja enc slow and savin the 
        day. (1-2)</p>

      <h2>Doomwho?</h2>

      <p>After we punked out Rumblecrush we decided to kill Doomshade as well, 

        since we were in the area. Doomshade gets no props from me, as he offered 

        up not much resistance and generally got kicked in the face. (1-0)</p>

      <p>In a bittersweet dedication, I am dedicating these kills to my school. 

        Basically, because the doom and trepidation of the beginning of my classes 

        is about the only thing I can think of at the moment. Damn school, damn 

        it to hell. On the other hand, go Spartans. /yay</p>

      <h2>Oops, There's Another One</h2>

      <p>In another groundbreaking first for the Notorious A.D. crew we bounced 

        Grieg's ass around today. It was some moderately rocky business at first, 

        but after a few tries, tribulations, ideas, bad ideas, yelling, and blind 

        pallies we got him down. Because I bit the dust embarassingly early, I 

        have no action packed in fight screenshots. Regardless, it's all about 

        the loots, baby. So, without further ado: (1-2)</p>

        B.I.G. A lot of these dedications are more poorly conceived jokes than 

        anything else, but in this case it's a true dedication meant in high regard. 

        We love and miss you B.I.G., indeed, the best who ever did it. </p>

      <h2>More Lendi</h2>



      <p>We killed Lendi once again last night in the neverending struggle to 



        get more ST keys. Although the loots were also snapped up with no complaint. 



        With one minor mishap, we got Lendi down again. Since you know what Lendi 



        looks like, I'll just make it short and sweet and get to the loot.(4-1)</p>

      <p>In celebration of this kill of Lendi, and of classic video games, I dedicate 



        this Lendi kill to the hammer brothers of the Super Mario Brothers series. 



        The hammer brothers were indeed a challenge to be reckoned with in any 



        Mario game. However, much like Lendi, with a little practice, they became 



        trivial. Although their drops suck.</p>

      <h2>Right in...to.. the Danger Zone!</h2>







      <p>As the snappy title would indicate tonight, indeed, we took it right 







        into the danger zone. My cryptic quoting of old movie soundtracks will 







        be clear by the time you finish with this update. That, my friends, I 







        promise you. Anyway, being angry at Eashen of the Sky for denying us loot 







        over three percent life we demanded a rematch. Round 2: AD. (1-1)</p>

      <h2>Not quite so Far Into the DANGER ZONE!</h2>







      <p>Before peanut butter, there was jelly, before chocolate there was vanilla, 







        and before Eashen was Ikitiar. We pounced on this fellow once again on 







        the way to Eashen. He did teach some great lessons on agro control however, 







        and he was only charging exps to teach the lesson. Many brave souls were 







        ripped a new one senselessly. /sigh a win regardless. (2-0)</p>

<p>Because I enjoy the song about the danger zone, and because Eashen of the Sky 



kind of flies and the like I have dedicated these kills to the movie &quot;Top 



Gun&quot;. In related news, my &quot;boss&quot; at the library despises Tom Cruise 



on a very personal level. Anyway, I am making it clear that this is not a Tom 



Cruise dedication, but one to the film &quot;Top Gun&quot;. Which, incidentally, 



may have been written by an alumni of Michigan State (<em>Yam: It was</em>). Although, 



that may be a different film. Whatever, we killed mobs and got loot. </p>

      <h2>That Mob is Poison! (poison! poison! poison!)</h2>







      <p>Tonight we decided to punch into the outer edges of NToV and pulled some 







        of the wyverns and lesser named. We got Ikatiar the Venom down with not 







        too much trouble, and fought Eashen as well. We almost got Eashen, but 







        since you don't come here for sob stories I'll just focus on the Venom. 







        Well, yeah, we killed him. Err, we looted him also but I forgot once again 







        to take a SS of that. </p>

        (Dabamf) </i></p>







      <p>Because apparently somehow Ikatiar is linked with poison I have decided 







        to go with cheap wordplay and dedicate this kill to Poison. In addition 







        to the cheap wordplay I would also like to give Bret Michaels props for 







        having more sex in 1987 than I could hope to in a lifetime. But, does
