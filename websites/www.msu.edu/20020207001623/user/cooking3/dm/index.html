      <p>The Plane of Growth raid was perhaps the most anticipated raid in the 
        short existence of AD. Many people had hoped that growth would be a repeat 
        of Hate or Fear with more mobs, more loots, and better loot. With our 
        hopes high, we broke into the plane, in hopes of destroying faction with 
        homo elves everywhere.</p>
      <p>What we found were mobs that weren't terribly difficult, and a lot of 
        them. We cut bloody swathes through an ungodly amount of mobs. Dabamf 
        aided us in his trademark Velketor pulling style by keeping mbos flowing 
        in a steady stream. At nights end, with only a couple of preposterous 
        gates to sour the evening, we had cleared 75% of the plane. Perhaps these 
        miscues were caused by a severe dampening of enthusiasm that comes with 
        shit drops. </p>
      <p>We came out with no legs, and no BPs for our efforts. We killed many 
        of the miniboss type mobs only to find that they had either research pages 
        or nothing on their corpses. While there certainly were some upgrades, 
        the loot situation turned out to be downright sad. These growth mobs are 
        stingy and they gave us the royal shaft.</p>

      <p>At long last we completed the final stage of Dabamf's epic today. We 
        had a good showing of 16 people come out to destroy the last few mobs 
        that Dabamf needed killed and he proceeded to get his bubbly cool fists. 
        Grats Dabamf, AD, on epic number 2! More to come, stay tuned!</p>

      <p>On Friday night we attempted our first foray into the Western Wastes 
        (aka &quot;dub dub&quot;) with 16 people, succor, and an open mind. In 
        terms of loots we did okay. In terms of corpse runs we did okay. In terms 
        of killing dragons we did okay.</p>
      <p>As far as loot goes we found that many of the fabulous dragons and large 
        named mammoths give you fat Johnson across your face many times. However, 
        the loots were not completely a bust as we retrieved some devent spells 
        and a pretty tight talisman for Whiteout. </p>
      <p>We only had one corpse run. This, was caused by (Ladi Dadi) Glati (likes 
        to party) gating all the way to the northeast corner of the zone and summoning 
        three lucky people to their deaths. This was fairly easily resolved by 
        some tricky monk work.<br>
        <br>
        With all of the technical stuff out of the way, the most glorious fight 
        that we attempted was Von. We were able to beat Von due to the dedication 
        of two rangers, a drood, a leezard, and a cleric. Battas, Vashen, Zeban, 
        Carraaki, and Dapper were left to kill Von when he was left at 20 percent 
        life. Apparently, Von had run out of mana from Gfluxing everyone else 
        to hell because he was content to melee with Carr and the rangers for 
        quite some time. However, being slowed he was doing enough for Battas 
        to keep up with. For long moments we wondered if Von would get enough 
        mana to begin Gfluxing people again, but it never happened. The braver 
        rangers, warrior, and uhh, druid were able to melee Von down and gain 
        us a stupendous victory. </p>

      <p>At long last Appotus Dominus was able to secure our first epic. Early 
        Monday morning I finally turned in all four pieces of the Serpent Staff 
        and Jeb Lumsed was kind enough to make me the staff. </p>
      <p>Over the last month or so many lame things have been done to achieve 
        this aim, and finally the Staff of the Serpent will be casting Speed of 
        the Shissar on our guild members. This, however, is only the first of 
        many epics we hope to achieve. Next up are the monk epics.<br>
        <br>
        I would like to thank guildmates and guests of raids who helped me get 
        my epic pieces. I appreciate all the effort and sacrifice that everyone 
        put forth in order for me to get the snake. If you need me for epic encounters, 
        I'll be there with the snake&#133;that moves.</p>

      <h2>Thou Will Regret thy Actions Swine!<br>
        *thunk*</h2>
      <p> We had some small epic raids on Friday night for enchanter, druid, shaman, 
        and monk epics. We visited the City of Mist and Plane of sky in our lust 
        for epics.</p>
      <p> First, we went to the Plane of Sky. We were able to cut through the 
        mobs on the first island with no problems and then slice Gwan deep wide 
        and frequent. Dabamf was able to gather his epic piece with no -real- 
        problems.</p>
      <p>Although, akin to the Ultima Online guards, genies below the first island 
        will proceed to rip people a new one if a spell is attempted on a group 
        member. This helpful tip was gained through the school of hard knocks. 
        We were run down a few times and many harsh AOE accusations flew before 
        we realized this. One question, if people are &quot;protected&quot; from 
        my spells why the hell do these foolish genies give a rats ass?</p>
      <p> Next, the City of Mist was on tap. We traversed there and killed a few 
        black reavers. To Dapper's orgasmic delight, a Jade Reaver was found fairly 
        early in the game. However, in our initial trip to Action Jaxion we were 
        run down due to cocky charging of a room with perhaps 14 mobs in it. This 
        concluded the first night of raiding, and everyone was fairly downtrodden 
        after such mediocre efforts. Nonetheless, we got a couple epic pieces.</p>

      <h2>AD Breaks Up in Game Marriage!</h2>
      <p> During our sometimes frustrating Plane of Sky excursion, we were offered 
        some comic relief. It all started as we were buffing to continue killing 
        happy fairies&#133;</p>
      <p> Dapper received a tell stating something to the effect that we were 
        &quot;breaking up a marriage&quot;. This fellow claimed we had invited 
        his significant other to a raid and that he had been spurned because of 
        this. The emotional victim of the Appotus Dominus raid recounted how special 
        this lady was to him and how he looked forward to spending time with her. 
        He sent tell after tell berating Dapper and our guild for holding a raid 
        and inviting this wonderful lady to our raid. <br>
        Needless to say, Duridain, Yamile, Dapper, and I were in absolute tears 
        at this fellows' antics. We were rofl for at least 10 minutes waiting 
        with baited breath for the next tell of this colorful character. Eventually, 
        I suppose, their differences were resolved. However, that doesn't stop 
        this from being perhaps the most hilarious thing that has ever happened 
        in an EQ raid. The guy was legitimately red hot over the &quot;loss&quot; 
        of his in game wife.</p>
      <p>The names and guilds have been withheld to protect the innocent. And

      <h2>Hole: It's Big</h2>
      <p> This afternoon the Appotus Dominus crew rolled into the hole and handled 
        it with no deaths. We rolled down to the Ghost and busted her chops with 
        little resistance. We did well in our handling of multiple unmezzable 
        mobs. </p>
      <p> Good work especially tanks: Carraaki, Simna, Duridain, Vanswer, Zeban</p>
      <p>We used 12 people to get this done. </p>
