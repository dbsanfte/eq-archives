      <h2>Primary Membership Requirements</h2>







      <p>The minimum level limit to join Appotus Dominus is nominally 55. This 







        limit may vary depending on class (please see our Class Restriction and 







        Desirability List below). The level limit is imposed due to the fact 







        that we do not guild people who cannot group or raid with the guild, as 







        this is not fair to either the guild or the prospective member. </p>







      <ol>



        <li>Must be Level 55+<br>







          <br>







        </li>







        <li>Must have your Old-Seblis key and actively working on both your Charasis, 



         Veeshan&#146;s Peak , and Emporer keys. <br>







          <br>



        </li>







        <li>Own or have access to an enduring breath device (such as a Fishbone 







          Earring or Aqualung). The reason for this is that zones like Kedge Keep, 







          The Grey, Sirens Grotto, and other epic encounters require these.<br>







          <br>







        </li>







        <li>Achieve an unbuffed 100 magic resistance in addition to 100 in either 







          fire resistance, cold resistance or poison resistance with respective 







          resistance equipment. (e.g. Fire resist gear which would include rings, 







          earrings, necklace, bracelets, etc.)<br>







          <br>







        </li>







        <li>The time it takes to join Appotus Dominus can vary largely.  



		You are encouraged to group with guild members and attend raids as much possible regular as attendance indicates commitment.  



		For this reason you should be able to attend at around 70% of raids during your application period and obtain 25 points from these raids.



		These number are subject to change in both directions depending upon timing circumstances, and overall raid attendance.<br>











          <br>







        </li>







        <li>Fully agree to the various guild policies such as raid, loot, and 







          membership. Ignorance is not an excuse. If you don't like them, feel 







          free not to join. <br>







          <br>







        </li>







        <li>Be a required Class. We recruit for a guild balance, so not all classes 







          have openings all the time. See our class level requirement and desirability 







          list below. <br>







          <br>







        </li>







        <li>Members are recruited for their primary character and are expected 







          to play these most of the time, feel free to play an alternate character, 







          but they will not be guilded unless both the primary and secondary characters 







          meet the requirements from alternate characters section listed below.<br>







          <br>



		  <li>If you are in another guild you will not be considered, you may raid with us but until you are unguilded you will not be considered for membership.  



		  If you are applying to join another guild you will not be considered. <Br><BR></li>







        <li>Keep your Magelo (<a href="http://www.magelo.com">www.magelo.com</a>) 







          profile updated on a regular basis.</li>







      </ol>

      <p>Please note that this list is subject to change, and is not a strict 







        guideline of AD's recruiting policy. Please note that the level requirements 







        are <b>minimum</b> level that we would accept in each class. </p>







      <h2>Joining the Guild</h2>







      <p>In order to achieve these aims, and avoid the mistakes of many other 







        guilds, we have a fairly strict and somewhat slow recruitment policy. 







        However it is done for a reason, as we do not want to recruit the wrong 







        people, and experience has shown that the right people are willing to 







        wait, and go to that extra effort required. All recruitment is administered 







        by the officers in charge of recruitment and is a 4 step process. </p>







      <p>Step 1. Application to Join</p>







      <p>In Order to submit an application for membership to the guild, you must: 







      </p>







      <ol>







        <li>Meet the membership requirements <br>







          <br>







        </li>







        <li>Be officially sponsored by at least 2 active members who are currently 







          in good standing with the rest of the guild. It is YOUR responsibility 







          to talk to existing members, and obtain sponsors, not the guild's. <br>







          <br>







        </li>







        <li>Post your application on our message board, including why you wish 







          to join, and who will sponsor you. </li>







      </ol>







      <p>This application is reviewed by the guild recruitment officers, and a 







        decision made whether to accept it, reject it at this time, or delay decision. 







        You will be contacted by one of the officers in charge of recruitment 







        and told the result. </p>







      <p>Step 2. Evaluation period</p>







      <p>If your initial application is accepted, you will start an evaluation 







        period. During this time you will have similar privileges, as well as 







        guild expectations as a guild member in regards to raid attendance, groups, 







        etc. It is expected that during this time, associate members will actively 







        seek out guild members for groups and at the same time, guild members 







        will actively invite associate members so each can evaluate the other. 







        During the evaluation, each recruit will have a thread started on the 







        Guild Applicants Discussion forum, so members can discuss them, post comments, 







        and offer their support for them. You are expected to raid with the guild 







        exactly the same as a member. The officers keep a list on raid attendance 







        and this will be used to evaluate attendance.</p>







      <p>Depending on the person, this period may be waived entirely or very short 







        and voting may start immediately on the person&#146;s application. However, 







        this will only happen if they are well known and have raided with us often, 







        or perhaps we have a hole within a certain class that needs to be urgently 







        filled, etc and is solely at the discretion and judgement of the recruiting 







        officers and the guild leader. </p>







      <p>Step 3. Guild Vote</p>







      <p>At some stage after your application, Your application will be put up



	  



	    for a vote. Voting is not like an election, certain numbers don't guarantee 



		



		you will or won't always be accepted, and other factors are still taken 



		



		into account by the Officers. </p>







      <p>In order to ensure a majority of the guild is happy with a new recruit, 







        voting is as follows. </p>







      <ol>







        <li>Voting will normally be open up to a week and members may Vote YES, 







          NO, or MORTAL ENEMY. <br>







          <br>







        </li>







        <li>A applicant needs 75% of the currently active guild members to vote YES 







          to be accepted. (Regardless of how many vote, 75% of the guild). <br>







          <br>







        </li>







        <li>Voting *MORTAL ENEMY* is reserved for people that will quit if a person 







          is recruited, or hates them, etc. This MUST be explained to the recruitment 







          officers or the guild leader in private. However, if reasonable, then 







          the application will be rejected. We will NEVER recruit someone that 







          will result in a current guild member quitting. Abuse of this vote just 







          for someone you don't like, but no concrete reason, will not be tolerated, 







          and the vote will be considered as a *No*. This is at the discretion 







          of the recruitment officers and the guild leader, but allows even a 







          single member a strong say in who is recruited. <br>







          <br>







        </li>







        <li>Voting is done by Secret Ballot, however voting IS compulsory. 







          <br>







          <br>







        </li>







        <li>If there is not enough yes votes then the application will be waived 







          for another few weeks to allow the person to get to know more people, 







          and voted on again. Again, recruiting officers will use their discretion. 







          A recruitment officer will contact you to inform you of the outcome. 







        </li>







      </ol>







      <p>Step 4. Get Invited into the Guild</p>







      <p>How and where this is done will be decided at the time. The ONLY people 







        that can execute a /GUILDINVITE for a person are the recruitment officers 







        and the guild leader, no one else. </p>







      <p>Step 5. Ongoing Membership </p>







      <p>After one month, the officers will review all new recruits to determine 







        whether they really were suitable for the guild, and the guild for them. 







        Any decisions about continued membership are solely at the discretion 







        of the guild leader. Every member should continually work to earn their 







        guild tag and better the guild. No more or less is expected of new or 







        existing members. </p>







      <h2>Recruitment Officers</h2>







      <p> Currently the recruitment officers are <a href="mailto:dapper@appotusdominus.com">Dapper</a>, 







        <a href="mailto:yamile@appotusdominus.com">Yamile</a>, and <a href="mailto:dabamf@appotusdominus.com">Dabamf</a>. 







        Contact one of us in game for further information. </p>








      <h2>Final Note</h2>


      <p>In order to prevent repetition of the mistakes of the past/other guild, 



        this recruitment policy will be adhered to, however is still at the discretion 



        of the officers and guild leader. Guilds are meant to last forever, players 




        come and go, if it takes that little bit extra time to ensure we have 







        the right people, then so be it. We understand we run the risk of loosing 







        potential good players to other guild because they don't want to wait, 







        however we are not here to cater for everyone, but to build up a good, 







        solid guild of loyal, trustworthy friends.</p>
