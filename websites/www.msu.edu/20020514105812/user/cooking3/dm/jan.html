      <h2>The Road We Trod Was Long and Hard</h2>
      <p> At long last Appotus Dominus was able to secure our first epic. Early 
        Monday morning I finally turned in all four pieces of the Serpent Staff 
        and Jeb Lumsed was kind enough to make me the staff. </p>
      <p>Over the last month or so many lame things have been done to achieve 
        this aim, and finally the Staff of the Serpent will be casting Speed of 
        the Shissar on our guild members. This, however, is only the first of 
        many epics we hope to achieve. Next up are the monk epics.<br>
        <br>
        I would like to thank guildmates and guests of raids who helped me get 
        my epic pieces. I appreciate all the effort and sacrifice that everyone 
        put forth in order for me to get the snake. If you need me for epic encounters, 
        I'll be there with the snake&#133;that moves.</p>

      <h2>Thou Will Regret thy Actions Swine!<br>
        *thunk*</h2>
      <p> We had some small epic raids on Friday night for enchanter, druid, shaman, 
        and monk epics. We visited the City of Mist and Plane of sky in our lust 
        for epics.</p>
      <p> First, we went to the Plane of Sky. We were able to cut through the 
        mobs on the first island with no problems and then slice Gwan deep wide 
        and frequent. Dabamf was able to gather his epic piece with no -real- 
        problems.</p>
      <p>Although, akin to the Ultima Online guards, genies below the first island 
        will proceed to rip people a new one if a spell is attempted on a group 
        member. This helpful tip was gained through the school of hard knocks. 
        We were run down a few times and many harsh AOE accusations flew before 
        we realized this. One question, if people are &quot;protected&quot; from 
        my spells why the hell do these foolish genies give a rats ass?</p>
      <p> Next, the City of Mist was on tap. We traversed there and killed a few 
        black reavers. To Dapper's orgasmic delight, a Jade Reaver was found fairly 
        early in the game. However, in our initial trip to Action Jaxion we were 
        run down due to cocky charging of a room with perhaps 14 mobs in it. This 
        concluded the first night of raiding, and everyone was fairly downtrodden 
        after such mediocre efforts. Nonetheless, we got a couple epic pieces.</p>

      <h2><a name="marriage"></a>AD Breaks Up in Game Marriage!</h2>
      <p> During our sometimes frustrating Plane of Sky excursion, we were offered 
        some comic relief. It all started as we were buffing to continue killing 
        happy fairies&#133;</p>
      <p> Dapper received a tell stating something to the effect that we were 
        &quot;breaking up a marriage&quot;. This fellow claimed we had invited 
        his significant other to a raid and that he had been spurned because of 
        this. The emotional victim of the Appotus Dominus raid recounted how special 
        this lady was to him and how he looked forward to spending time with her. 
        He sent tell after tell berating Dapper and our guild for holding a raid 
        and inviting this wonderful lady to our raid. <br>
        Needless to say, Duridain, Yamile, Dapper, and I were in absolute tears 
        at this fellows' antics. We were rofl for at least 10 minutes waiting 
        with baited breath for the next tell of this colorful character. Eventually, 
        I suppose, their differences were resolved. However, that doesn't stop 
        this from being perhaps the most hilarious thing that has ever happened 
        in an EQ raid. The guy was legitimately red hot over the &quot;loss&quot; 
        of his in game wife.</p>
      <p>The names and guilds have been withheld to protect the innocent. And

      <h2><a name="hole"></a>Hole: It's Big</h2>
      <p> This afternoon the Appotus Dominus crew rolled into the hole and handled 
        it with no deaths. We rolled down to the Ghost and busted her chops with 
        little resistance. We did well in our handling of multiple unmezzable 
        mobs. </p>
      <p> Good work especially tanks: Carraaki, Simna, Duridain, Vanswer, Zeban</p>
      <p>We used 12 people to get this done. </p>

      <p>We managed to clear the entire first floor, again, and wax the three 
        minibosses that resided on the first floor. We wiped twice:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The &quot;Master of Spite&quot; made a run for the border and summoned 
          people all over at shaves of life. </li>
        <li>An Ire Ghast that appeared not to have been under the influence of 
          snare broke out from camp and brought more mobs than you can shake a 
          stick at back to camp. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The clearing of the plane was cut down time wise significantly as we 
        were closer<br>
        To 7 hours than the 10 it previously took. This isn't prime, but it is 
        better. Next time, we should be even faster. </p>
      <p> Many of our members got phat loots, but the highlight of the night was 
        when Grandmaster R'Tal dropped the Rakusha Cloak. A bidding frenzy between 
        Keepson and Dabamf began that finally ended at 24 points with a Dabamf 
        victory. Gratz Dabamf!</p>

      <p>We set up quickly, got an LFG monk who happened to be in the zone and 
        proceeded to punk the turtle straight out. Nobody was run down and Yamile 
        still had 40 percent of mana left when we finished. Who says pallies can't

      <p> In my quest for my epic snake staff, I would let nobody's whining and 
        complaining stop me from forcing everyone to kill the tangrin today. The 
        first valiant attempt saw us reduce the tangrin to &quot;the&quot; in 
        the tangrin. These people performed this task:</p>

      </table>
      <p>After we came so close, we sent the call out to the guild, and they responded 
        by sending a couple more brave soldiers into the fray. These peeps were 
        added for the second run at the tangrin:</p>
      <table width="90%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
        <tr> 
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
          <td> 
            <p>Battas 55 Cleric</p>
          </td>
          <td> 
            <p>Carraaki 53 Warrior </p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>On this second attempt we ran the tangrin into the ground with little 
        remorse. Battas ended up with 90 mana and Yamile had 40 as superior tactics 
        and firepower spearheaded a cleaned up effort on the tangrin. The newbs 
        rejoiced as their long time foe was vanquished!</p>
