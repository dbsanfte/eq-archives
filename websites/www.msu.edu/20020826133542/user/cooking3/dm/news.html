<h2>Right in...to.. the Danger Zone!</h2>
<p>As the snappy title would indicate tonight, indeed, we took it right into the 
danger zone. My cryptic quoting of old movie soundtracks will be clear by the 
time you finish with this update. That, my friends, I promise you. Anyway, being 
angry at Eashen of the Sky for denying us loot over three percent life we demanded 
a rematch. Round 2: AD. (1-1)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/eashenloot1.jpg" width="186" height="87"></p>
<h2>Not quite so Far Into the DANGER ZONE!</h2>
<p>Before peanut butter, there was jelly, before chocolate there was vanilla, 
and before Eashen was Ikitiar. We pounced on this fellow once again on the way 
to Eashen. He did teach some great lessons on agro control however, and he was 
only charging exps to teach the lesson. Many brave souls were ripped a new one 
senselessly. /sigh a win regardless. (2-0)</p>
<p><i>The Loots: Ancient Wyvern Hide Tunic (Dabamf), Cloak of Venom (Mindark), 
Ancient Wyvern Hide Sleeves (Vasilik)</i></p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/ikiatarloot2.jpg" width="206" height="127"></p>
<p>Because I enjoy the song about the danger zone, and because Eashen of the Sky 
kind of flies and the like I have dedicated these kills to the movie &quot;Top 
Gun&quot;. In related news, my &quot;boss&quot; at the library despises Tom Cruise 
on a very personal level. Anyway, I am making it clear that this is not a Tom 
Cruise dedication, but one to the film &quot;Top Gun&quot;. Which, incidentally, 
may have been written by an alumni of Michigan State (<em>Yam: It was</em>). Although, 
that may be a different film. Whatever, we killed mobs and got loot. </p>

<h2>That Mob is Poison! (poison! poison! poison!)</h2>
<p>Tonight we decided to punch into the outer edges of NToV and pulled some of 
the wyverns and lesser named. We got Ikatiar the Venom down with not too much 
trouble, and fought Eashen as well. We almost got Eashen, but since you don't 
come here for sob stories I'll just focus on the Venom. Well, yeah, we killed 
him. Err, we looted him also but I forgot once again to take a SS of that. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/ikiatar1.jpg" width="440" height="282"></p>
<p><i>The Loots: Ikatiar's Stinger (Vestanpance), Ancient Wyvern Hide Sleeves 
(Dabamf) </i></p>
<p>Because apparently somehow Ikatiar is linked with poison I have decided to 
go with cheap wordplay and dedicate this kill to Poison. In addition to the cheap 
wordplay I would also like to give Bret Michaels props for having more sex in 
1987 than I could hope to in a lifetime. But, does he have phat loot?</p>
<p>..</p>

<p>..my god somebody kill me. </p>

<h2>Sorry Lendi.. kinda.</h2>
<p>Once again we were able to secure a victory over Lendi the Keeper with relative 
ease. Thanks to all the guests who helped us out on the Lendi kill. No thanks 
to the walled drake that summoned people.. including me. (3-0)</p>

<h2>Bring Da Rukus</h2>
<p>Because of the similarity of the kills and of the days I decided to go with 
another Wu-Tang themed title. The first kill of the day was Zland. Once again 
we pulled him, oops, I guess. Nonetheless you can see by this pic that we have 
pinpoint control over the mobs positioning. We can spin him, push him pull him 
on a dime. This time we wanted him.. halfway in the wall. (3-2)</p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/zland3.jpg" width="450" height="189"></p>

<p>&quot;ME, Cause I'm PERFECT!&quot;</p>
<p>While clearly not the best day ever, I decided to dedicate these kills to Mr. 
Perfect because they went exceedingly well. Lendi is good, but he's not PERFECT!</p>

<h2>Triumph</h2>
<p>After careful consideration, I have decided to go with a second Wu-Tang themed 
update for two reasons. One, I had more dandy Wu-Tang ideas. Two, it's late and 
I want to finish this update. Nothing really too groundbreaking here, only that 
we got Zlandicar again. Thanks to some Fantasy people and some others who I have 
regrettably forgotten for helpin us out when the goin got tough and the tough 
got dead. (2-2** This is a new and interesting feature I had decided to add. I'll 
keep track of our record as honestly as I can bear versus named mobs)</p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/zland2.jpg" width="393" height="247"></p>
<p><i>The Loots (upon close inspection you can see my uber stats and my rapidly 
dwindling 60 exps bar, woot!): Sleepaz Key (Battas), Zlandicar's Heart (Nadilye), 
Frakadar's Talisman (Cameljon), Gauntlets of Mortality (....), Cowl of Mortality 
(Fobas)...more stuff....spells....a castle deed...a boat deed....2 mandrake roots...a 
level 4 treasure map.</i></p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/zlandloot2.jpg" width="239" height="249"></p>
<h2>The Sage Continues.... (Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)</h2>
<p>Next we went into the west side of the Temple of Veeshan and kilt Telkorenar. 
Okay, I'll give Telk his props, he tore us off one time. Nonetheless, we got it 
under control, and proceeded to gang rape Telkorenar with enthusiasm and more 
greed for loot. (2-1)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/telkloot2.jpg" width="208" height="129"></p>
<h2>Killenin is Whats Happenin</h2>
<p>Finally we took a happy little stroll, on which I managed to get myself killed 
around 50 times, over to Gozzrem. We love Gozzrem and we love her sexy hybrid 
loots. Except Dabamf, who hates hybrid loots, and hates hybrids. Not on an individual 
level per se, but more en masse. Despite the fact that Dab hates on hybrids, we 
got them some loot. Anybody need any food? (3-3)</p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/gozz3.jpg" width="353" height="189"></p>

<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/gozzloot3.jpg" width="207" height="88"></p>
<p>I have decided to, once aagain unsurprisingly, dedicate this batch of kills 
to the Old Dirty Bastard (ODB). The ODB has provided us all with hours of priceless 
entertainment and has indeed only been burnt once but that was only gonorrhea 
(a likely butchered spelling of STD, but at 3.56 am I'm not gonna break out the 
Webster's). </p>

<h2>He's not a Machine!</h2>
<p>Klandicar has been a massive pain in the ass of Appotus Dominus for a long 
time. We have tried Klandicar 12 separate times, and only sacrificed out our own 
exps. I'm not going to go into gory detail here or give any passionate excuses 
about why or how we lost, but the bottom line is we won this time. And, just as 
Rocky was inspired when he made Draco bleed in Rocky IV, we are inspired by this 
first kill of Klandicar. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/kland1.jpg" width="391" height="326"></p>
<p><i>The Loots: nothing, nothing, some shitty spells, Sleepaz Key (Voidd)</i></p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/klandloot1.jpg" width="259" height="246"></p>
<p>Because of the long odds, the history of us with this encounter, and because 
of the miracle enchanter slow, I have decided to dedicate this kill to Rocky. 
Not only has Rocky inspired hundreds of thousands during low times, but he has 
offered us endless inspiration and a soundtrack that has yet to be surpassed. 
Indeed, this night, there was no easy way out..or shortcut home. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/rocky.jpg" width="300" height="200"></p>
<h2>Lendi</h2>
<p>We stepped up on Lendi and killed her again today. Everything went much smoother 
and we got some more loot that people could use. Although, really the Lendi part 
of the night is kind of a blur to me as what I really remember was the killing 
of Klandicar. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/lendi2.jpg" width="501" height="225"></p>
<p><i>The Loots (once again I basically forgot to get a good loot SS, but I got 
a pic of the helm...): Truesight Helm (Dianna), Velium Maul (Blackfayth), Sleepaz 
Key (Blackfayth)</i></p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/lendiloot2.jpg" width="145" height="88"></p>
<p>I am also dedicating the Lendi kill to Rocky, because no matter what any asshole 
tells you, the Rocky movies are classic. You just remember that shit, they're 
classic. Don't let any stuck up wannabe intellectual go off telling you that you 
can't enjoy Rocky movies. </p>

<h2>Protect Ya Neck</h2>
<p>Shame on Vindi when he tried to step through to the Ad clan. Recently, I discovered 
some of my old Wu-Tang cd's. Also recently, we killed Derakor the Vindicator. 
I decided to merge the two into one sexy upate. Once again we cut off Vindi's 
head..<i>tiger style.</i></p>

<h2>Whoops, uhh, KILL IT!</h2>
<p>We quickly pulled Zlandicar flawlessly on our first successful Zland raid. 
This is bad because you're not really supposed to pull him. Luckily with some 
well placed nukes we were able to prevent a tragedy by just beating his ass like 
he stole somethin'.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/zland1.jpg" width="397" height="237"></p>

me), Spells, Quest Gem.</i></p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/zlandloot1.jpg" width="239" height="248"></p>
<p>I have decided to dedicate this fight to Rob Zombie, who, if you look closely 
enough vaguely resembles Zland. </p>

<h2>Only the Strong Survived</h2>
<p>And, heres a hunt, Vindi wasn't one of em. After the giants provided us with 
100s of pieces of armor we decided that they hadn't given us enough Bp's so we 
pried one of them off Vindicator's stinky ass. </p>

<h2>Trifecta!</h2>
<p>In what we consider a big step, we put the last two notches in the WToV trifecta. 
Finally, we got Gozzrem, Telk, and Lendi. Thanks to all the old and new members 
for sticking with it -- finally we're getting some good ass loot and its starting 
to pay off. </p>
<p>I dedicate the trifecta to, who else, but Larry Bird:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/bird.jpg" width="247" height="294"></p>
<h2>Lendianara the Keeper</h2>
<p>After mastering Gozzrem we decided that perhaps Lendi was within our grasp. 
As a sort of sad bit of trivia Lendi is the first mob we have attempted and killed 
on the first try. Everybody did a great job and we got some nice loot. Unfortunately 
in the excitement, despite many reminders from my trsuty comrades I forgot to 
get a pic of the loot. However, I did get a pic of Diddy posing poster style with 
Lendi.</p>

<h2>Telkorenar</h2>
<p>Every sorry sad soul who has ever sat in the hub hopelessly farming silk bracer 
after silk bracer has ached deep within their loins to find and kill Telk. At 
long last, after monitoring him for months we got our chance to take a piece out 
of his Nagafen-esque ass. /rude Telkorenar</p>

<h2>No, No No No No No We Didn't</h2>
<p>Yes, in fact, we did kill Gozzrem once again. In celebration of this kill I 
would like to offer up this <a href="http://www.cashmoney-records.com/frameset_home_lo_res_popup.htm#">Big 
Tymers</a> themed update. In a performance worthy of the title of nothin else 
none other the #1 Stunna we knocked out Gozz. </p>

<p>Naturally this kill is dedicated to the Big Tymers:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/bigtymers.jpg" width="514" height="308"></p>
<p>You have to respect, if not love, the Big Tymers for no other reason than they 
successfully rhyme &quot;rolex&quot; and &quot;mosaics&quot;. Mannie Fresh teams 
with Brian &quot;Baby&quot; Williams to create some of the most raunchy, yet strangely 
appealing rap music on the shalf today. </p>
