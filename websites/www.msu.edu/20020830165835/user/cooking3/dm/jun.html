      <h2>V. Diddy</h2>
      <p>After posting somewhat regularly and pleasing my adoring fans, I sort 
        of fell off the past couple of weeks. The reason for this istwo-fold. 
        One, how many times do people really want to read about Trakanon, Wuoshi, 
        and Dracoliche? Perhaps I have breathed life into these mundane kills 
        one time too many, gotten excited about one too many cobalt bp, or had 
        one too many disappointments with the Dracoliche's drops. Nonethless, 
        I became complacent and failed to document some kills. For this, I am 
        sorry. Doubltess many of you have been checking the site religiously to 
        see which fantabulous drops we got off Wuoshi. The second reason (lest 
        you forget <i>two-fold</i>), is because I am a lazy son of a bitch. I'll 
        leave it up to you to decide which of these compelling arguements has 
        more bearing on why the site has gone to the dogs (once again). </p>
      <p>Anyway, the point of this sexy update was not for me to wax philosophical 
        about the lack of recent updates! It was to announce that we ventured 
        into Akheva ruins to kill some buoulder looking fellow: The Va'Dyn. You 
        know the mob has to be a badass when he has &quot;The&quot; in front of 
        it. Anyway, he has about 365904957398560743680 HP, and as you can see 
        we got an add or three. Luckily the smaller rocky fellows only have around 
        9034759359205 HP, so they fell comparatively quickly. </p>

      <h2>Another Day, Another Draco</h2>
      <p>Since we love going to Plane of Fear till all hours of the night, we 
        decided to head in and see if Draco was prancing about. Luckily for us, 
        he was prancing about. We pulled him to camp, and as has happened many 
        times in the past and hopefully many more times we killed the large Dracoliche. 
        I didn't take a new screenshot and I never plan to. However, I will recycle 
        this old one because I like to cut and paste. Thanks Draco for robe and 
        hybrid shield. </p>

      <h2>Dr Wily Returns!</h2>
      <p>Oh, wait this isn't the creation of the nefarious Dr. Wily from the classic 
        Megaman series for the NES, it's thinly veiled plaguarism by VI. Nonethless 
        we killed it in embarassingly easy fashion which brings up another classic

      <h2>In Unrelated News...</h2>
      <p>Don't you feel for the low end celebrities on MTV cribs? They're showing 
        their house like it's something special and you're thinking, yes my friend 
        in high school had a pool table too, so what? They always have one bangin 
        house on Cribs then the two afterwards have to follow up with their houses 
        that were either built in 1988 (the last time they sold a record) or leaving 
        you with the only one logical conclusion: &quot;Dude, you're just not 
        that rich, are you?&quot; I will leave the low end celebrities who were 
        victimized today on cribs nameless. But suffice it to say I know people 
        with a big screen TV and a refrigerator full of beer in their basement. 
        In the words of Shania Twain, &quot;that don't impress me much&quot;. 
      </p>
      <p>Granted, getting to level 60 in Everquest probably don't impress them 
        much either, but I don't have a God damn show called Ciliem's AA where 
        I talk about the next AA ability I'm going to get (Gather Mana, for anyone 
        interested). As a disclaimer to any of my low end celebrity friends, please 
        do not let this quip discourage you from inviting me to your crib...as 
        long as you have cable internet service.</p>

        most of the tanks to death, and gated. What new and exciting buffs is

      <h2>Zelnithak</h2>
      <p>For the first time we spied a named mob up in Umbral Plains. Unfortunately, 
        it was this goofy ass motherfucker. I'm not ashamed to say that we zerged 
        this mob with ~23 people and it was enjoyable. A mob that looks like this 
        does not deserve the respect of anyone. To see this raggedy fool stagger 
        and warp through the choppy UP landscape is truly a sight to behold. A 
        for effort on trying to make a unique looking mob, E for the preposterous 
        gayness that resulted from those well meaning creative juices. </p>

      <p>In order to remind ourselves just how gay deathtouch really is, we decided

        most preposterous mob ability in the game. Note: this becomes exponentially 
        more gay if you have really poor DPS. There's really nothing quite so 
        satisfying as killing a mob like this to loot up a Rallic Pack.</p>

      <h2><b>Updates -- WTF?</b></h2>
      <p>To avoid being beaten by my guildmates I have decided to update the website. 
        Originally, I had this idea that I would dramatically dress up the web 
        site and make it more pleasing to the eye. Then, it dawned on me that 
        I really don't know a god damn thing about really making web sites. Undeterred, 
        I heisted a copy of DreamWeaver with hopes of the tutorials making me 
        a web master in ~30 minutes. Then I decided to play EQ. So to make a long 
        story long, but not as long as it could be -- I have, in the great tradition 
        of students everywhere, done just enough to get by and learned enough 
        to update the web site on my own accord. So, flashy new look -- pipe dream, 
        more frequent updates -- perhaps. </p>
      <h2>Welcome New Members!</h2>
      <p>Over the past few weeks we have been lucky enough to get some really 
        high quality people in Appotus Dominus. A hearty (in some cases quite 
        belated) welcome goes out to Blackfayth, Dianna, Sonicbeat, Drekken, Achelous, 
        Merloch, Sinaee, and Mindark! </p>
      <h2>Bard Epic</h2>
      <p>In a move that will likely ignite a guildwide bloodlust for epics we 
        finished up Sonicbeat's epic and earned another fabled yellow check. Congratulations 
        are certainly in order for Sonicbeat. On a side note, here's a tip that 
        may save someone somewhere a lot of pain one day: Bard Trakanon is identical 
        to regular Trakanon. </p>

      <h2>Dracoliche</h2>
      <p>As we pondered a trip into fear, late in the afternoon a bold and decisive 
        warrior made the call for us. In a selfless move to end the debate Judelce 
        strode into Fear and put a corpse on the ground. Luckily, this gamble 
        paid large dividends. We discovered Dracoliche up, and after waiting for 
        eternities for him to path all around Fear, busted his chops. </p>

      <h2>Trakanon</h2>
      <p> After being beaten like a d<b></b>rum a number of times by Trakanon 
        it was an especially fun to finally not end up blind, in the shrooms, 
        or just back at the bind point with no gear. We busted Trak's chops twice 
        this week and these were the drops that he donated.</p>

      <h2>Rhag 1</h2>
      <p>We continue to kill Rhag1 whenever we can find him up and lately we've 
        snagged him a couple more times. Rhag1 is slowly providing the guild with 
        all the Luclin spells they need in addition to providing us with some 
        nice upgrades.</p>
