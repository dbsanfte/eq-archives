      <p> More epics - this time it's Slackin. Much love to everyone who helped 
        Slackin with his epic. Special thanks to Carraaki &quot;no named up&quot; 
        Petsrus for preserving the Shissir for Slack. Great job everyone, and

      <h2>TOV</h2>
      <p> A wise man once said &quot;the party don't start till I walk in&quot;, 
        and if that's true, the party at Temple of Veeshan has officially begun 
        with the arrival of Appotus Dominus. Denying rumors that we are not uber 
        enough to hang in TOV we took our rag tag 18 man crew in and got some 
        drops and killed a good number of mobs. This translates into us rolling 
        into TOV &quot;til the wheels fall off&quot;. </p>
      <p> I'll leave you with a quote from another wise man: &quot;Strategy &gt; 
        Mass&quot;.</p>

      <h2>Incoming &lt;&lt;Epics&gt;&gt;</h2>
      <p> Saturday we spent happily galavanting around to all sorts of God awful 
        zones trying to complete peoples epics. The highlight was Plane of Air 
        as we were able to get a few Ranger stones and help a couple guests get 
        epic pieces. At the end of the day we had finished Whiteout's epic, Keepson's 
        epic, and Zeban epic. </p>
      <p> Thanks to Promethian Order who allowed Whiteout to loot the Iksar tear 
        and set up the three epic night! </p>

      <h2>Venril Sathir </h2>
      <p> Early Friday evening we found that Venril Sathir was up. After some 
        debate over the possibility of failure we decided that it had to be tried. 
        We picked up a couple of guests in hopes of filling some needed spots 
        and rolled to Karnors. And, at long last, we were able to kill Venril 
        Sathir. He dropped shit Pally legs. Nonetheless, this was a goal we had 
        for a long time, and now we know we have what it takes to kill Venril.

      <h2>Epics and Levels Oh My!</h2>
      <p>Congratulations go out to two new Druids with their epics. Both Dapper 
        and Alueriniel received their epics this weekend after a few fights. Some 
        of the more interesting highlights include, spending many hours in the 
        best zone in EQ, Kedge Keep, and and epic fight with 2 Black Reavers at 
        the same time, only for them to both drop Jade Reavers (grats to Zeban 
        for the second reaver).</p>

      <p>Also continued grats go out to everyone else that has leveled this week. 
        We have continued to level at a fine pace and our average level is now 
        up to little over 58. Officially we have 5 Epics competed, and 5 Level 
        60's in the guild. Keep up the good work all. </p>

      <p>Things have been a little slower here at AD lately. We have been laying 
        low and gaining levels, but there have been a few recent accomplishments 
        of note. First off we have two new 60 in the guild so congratulations 
        go out to Dapper and Ciliem for reaching this plateau. Both raced to the 
        level but it was Dapper who was able to reach 60 first, thanks to some 
        help from thousands of little sea creatures. Also congratulations go out 
        to Vashen for completing his epic in a record amount of time. Vash now 
        has now given even more meaning to the intended ranger sacrifice on every 
        good mob. Also congrads to recent dingers all to numerous to list...but 
        grats all and keep up the great progress. </p>
      <p>Also because I have your attention please remeber to create and/or keep 
        your magelo profile updated. </p>
