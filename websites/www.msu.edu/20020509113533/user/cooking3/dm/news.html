      <h2>Epic/ToV/Lodizal</h2>
      <p> This weekend we put in some good time in ToV, gathering more fabulous 
        loots. (gratz Dapper BP) We've got most people down to where they are 
        looking for pants and breastplates, and we're hoping to complete these 
        few (but most important pieces) within the next few weeks. ToV this weekend 
        coulda been better, but conversely coulda been worse also.</p>
      <p> Next order of business, we killed General V'Ghera for Kinolen's epic 
        in a rather bloody affair. Congratulations on your epic Kino, the first 
        real Appotus Dominus rogue! We were insanely lucky and he did drop the 
        quill giving us a rogue that can now really damage mobs. This affair coulda 
        went better, but then, coulda been worse as well.</p>
      <p> Finally we were lucky enough to get and kite Lodizal till we could get 
        enough people on the scene. In a case of mistaken tortoises Forsaken Unity 
        actually got the kill, but they were kind enough to give us the loot when 
        they realized we engaged first. We give FU mad props for giving us the 
        loots and being cool about the whole issue. Once again, Lodizal coulda 
        gone better, but then could also have been worse.</p>
      <p> In a mixed bag weekend we managed to not do our best work and still 
        come out with a lot of really nice loot and an epic. Next weekend, we're 
        hoping things will go a little closer to plan. (and if they don't you 
        can bet Dapper will take it out of someone's ass - hey I sieved MOST of 
        the glimmer drakes, what's the problem?) </p>

        enough to hang in TOV we took our rag tag 18 man crew in and got some 
        drops and killed a good number of mobs. This translates into us rolling

      <p> Saturday we spent happily galavanting around to all sorts of God awful

        as we were able to get a few Ranger stones and help a couple guests get 
        epic pieces. At the end of the day we had finished Whiteout's epic, Keepson's 
        epic, and Zeban epic. </p>

        and set up the three epic night! </p>

      <p> Early Friday evening we found that Venril Sathir was up. After some 
        debate over the possibility of failure we decided that it had to be tried. 
        We picked up a couple of guests in hopes of filling some needed spots 
        and rolled to Karnors. And, at long last, we were able to kill Venril 
        Sathir. He dropped shit Pally legs. Nonetheless, this was a goal we had 
        for a long time, and now we know we have what it takes to kill Venril.

      <p>Things have been a little slower here at AD lately. We have been laying

        of note. First off we have two new 60 in the guild so congratulations 
        go out to Dapper and Ciliem for reaching this plateau. Both raced to the 
        level but it was Dapper who was able to reach 60 first, thanks to some 
        help from thousands of little sea creatures. Also congratulations go out 
        to Vashen for completing his epic in a record amount of time. Vash now 
        has now given even more meaning to the intended ranger sacrifice on every 
        good mob. Also congrads to recent dingers all to numerous to list...but 
        grats all and keep up the great progress. </p>
