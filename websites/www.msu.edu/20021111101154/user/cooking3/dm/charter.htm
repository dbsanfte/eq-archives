      <p>Appotus Dominus was founded by 5 real life friends who have many extra 

        accounts. At its inception, there were 6 seperate members. These members 

        were Ciliem, Dapper, Duridain, Whiteout, Yamile, and Dabamf. The foundation 

        of the guild is the RL core of Yamile, Ciliem, Dapper, Whiteout and Duridain. 

        Although, since Dabamf was there for pre-guild, we have a special love 

        for him. </p>

      <p>Let me give a rather lengthy dissertation that should clear up some questions 

        you may have. </p>

      <h2>General Information</h2>

      <p>This is information that I consider not 100% necessary to know, but it 

        explains things that happen sometimes. On the weekends, Dapper, Ciliem, 

        Yamile, and Whiteout all gather at Dapper's home to play EQ. We start 

        early and end late. This means a number of things to other guild members:</p>

      <p>Most times, we want to group together. We began playing EQ so that we 

        could all hang out together and group and do phat things. Obviously, we 

        need the help of everyone else to help us get to where we all want to 

        be. However, we also want to have fun. The most fun for us is honing our 

        skills and playing together every week. While admittedly sometimes this 

        arrangement leaves the odd members screwed, this is not by design. We 

        sincerely are hurt when our members get left out in the cold on groups. 

        We want to work up to where we can have two workable groups. However, 

        for now, we take the people who are (a) on and who are (b) going to coincide 

        most closely with what times we want to play. </p>

      <p>Sometimes, when you group with us on these days we may not be chatty, 

        or even unresponsive. This is kind of tough. We chat a lot amongst ourselves 

        and with battle spam and everything going on we sometimes miss things 

        that are said to us directly or indirectly. This is simply a consequence 

        of the circumstances. If this happens, PIPE UP AND SAY IT AGAIN. We are 

        not trying to ignore you, and don't want you to feel like you're being 

        ignored. We are not ripping on you, or laughing at you either. If we thought 

        you were stupid, a poor player, or generally lame you would not be in 

        the guild. So, don't take it personally, and be persistent please.</p>

      <p>Essentially, the guild is ruled by committee. This means that we have 

        loud arguments on a frequent basis. Dapper, Ciliem, Yamile, and Whiteout 

        will decide the course of what will happen. While this may seem like an 

        &quot;us&quot; and &quot;you&quot; scenario the way it is written it is 

        really no different than most successful guilds. In order for everyone 

        to get where they want to be, we need a power structure. As such, we do 

        want everyone to get phat lewts. The guild members are not simply pawns 

        in our own schemes, but important in game friends. We have interest in 

        getting loot for everyone. I sincerely hope that nobody feels at this 

        point like they are getting shanked on loot. </p>

      <h2>Long Term Goals</h2>

      <p>In the long term we want to kill big daddies and take their loot. While 

        member wise and level wise we are a little short, we can fix this. We 

        are not looking to recruit people who we find to be lame. </p>

      <h2>Qualities of lameness</h2>

      <ol>

        <li>Poor Player</li>

        <li>Undesirable Personality</li>

        <li>Greedy Loot Whore</li>

      </ol>
