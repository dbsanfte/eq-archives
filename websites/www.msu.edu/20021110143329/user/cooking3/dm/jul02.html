<h2>Grand Slam!</h2>
<p>In life, there are really a few different types of grand slams. Understanding 
this is really a prerequisite for getting the most out of this snappy quip. </p>
<p><i>The first type:</i> The bases are loaded, you're down by three runs, there 
are two outs, the count is 3-2, you have fouled off 10 consecutive pitches to 
stay alive, it's game 7 of the World Series, you sit on fastball, and boooooooom! 
You're a hero! </p>
<p><i>The second type: </i>The Denny's Grand Slam breakfast.</p>
<p>This fine accomplishment certainly fits more into the second type of &quot;Grand 
Slam&quot; than the first. It was a pretty good deal, it filled the void, but 
to keep it real you know there was probably a better breakfast available somewhere.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, I give you Wuoshi, Severilous, Talendor, and Va'Dyn, 
and a dracoliche! Fuck, I wrote that whole story thinking there were only four 
kills. My grand slam metaphor is shot right in the ass. Bah fuck it, it's still 
a grand slam. </p>
<p>I'm doing this from memory and without my normal selection of prime screenshots 
so I'm going to haphazardly list all the loot. Bear with me loyal AD readers. 
</p>
<p><i>Wuoshi: Tanglewood Shield (Scubasteve), Some scales, a stupid ass scimtar.</i></p>
<p><i>Severilous: Green Scale, Torpor, Malo, probably some other preposterously 
shitty drops.</i></p>
<p><i>Talendor: Red Scale (Nife), Red Dragon Shield (Voidd), a bard horn or some 
shit.</i></p>
<p><i>Va'Dyn: Shaderock Robe (Nadilye), Shaderock Girdle (I forgot), Luclin Ball, 
a shitass spell</i></p>
<p><i>Dracobishe: Crimson Robe of amazing shittiness x2</i></p>
<p>So, once again, like the Denny's grand slam, we got an amazing deal but most 
of it is in the vault.</p>
<p>I dedicate these 5 sexy kills to:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/dennys.jpg" width="378" height="285"></p>
<p>Who else, but the Denny's Grand Slam breakfast! Let me also assure you folks 
that there is not a Denny's Grand Slam Breakfast in all the world that even slightly 
resembles that picture. </p>
<p><i>- <a href="mailto:ciliem@appotusdominus.com">Ciliem</a></i></p>

wishes to point out the obvious frugality in its construction. </i></p>

<h2>Time for Dyner</h2>
<p>After a weekend that was less than ideal, we spotted the Va'Dyn up and kilt 
him. I would personally like to thank Va'Dyn for dropping some of the shittiest 
loot on his table, much of which we have gotten before. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/vadyn2.jpg" width="420" height="226"></p>
<p><i>The Loots: Gold Inlaid Ulak, Shaderock Girdle (Scubasteve), Ervaj's Composition 
(Sonicbeat), Luclin Ball (Nadilye)</i></p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/vadynloot3.jpg" width="227" height="135"></p>
<p>After some deliberation, I have decided to dedicate this Va'Dyn kill to the 
Big Pun - both are large and deceased. There's also a call to give props to really 
fat dudes that score bitches. Much love to Big Pun!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/bigpun.jpg" width="400" height="340"></p>
<h2>Wuoshi</h2>
<p>There's just no feeling so silky fine as killing Wuoshi ONCE AGAIN! We ported 
in and killed Wuoshi one more time! It is now once again safe to port into WL..</p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/woushi2.jpg" width="468" height="103"></p>
<p><i>The Loots: Crescent Blades (Judelce), Emerald Scales x2, Tanglewood Shield 
(Sylor), Aego (Azari), Potg, Arch Lich, Death Peacve</i></p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/woushiloot2.jpg" width="261" height="208"></p>
<p>In an unprecedented move, I have decided to dedicate this Wuoshi kill to BIG 
PUN! If anyone deserves the double dip, it's Pun. </p>

<h2>Back to the Regularly Scheduled Trak Killing...</h2>
<p>Well, even if we have proven that we can go at least a step above Trak, that 
doesn;t mean we're going to stop killing Trakanon. A lot of people in the guild 
can use the Trak BP's until we can scrounge them up something better. </p>
<p>Tonight we took a force down and killed Trakanon to get some BP's that people 
can use. Luckily, we were able to hook up a member who was in need. Thanks to 
all the guests who tagged along to help us tap Trak. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/trak8.jpg" width="545" height="176"></p>
<p><i>The Loots: Ranger BP (Sylor) WILD LORDS TUNIC (Some insanely lucky beastlord 
in the future), 2 teeth (Fobas, Tybrus)</i></p>
<p>I have decided to dedicate this kill to Mike Tyson, a once feared man that 
time has dulled. Indeed, similar to Trakanon in a lot of ways.</p>

<h2>Gozzrem</h2>
<p>&quot;<i>Don't join AD unless you just wanna kill Trak and Sev all the time...&quot; 
--some dumb fuck</i></p>
<p>For some reason, even though all we are trying to do is kill mobs, have fun, 
and get ourselves some loot people feel the need to hate on us. We gathered at 
least a small measure of revenge tonight by killing Gozzrem. I refuse to trivialize 
the fun we had by making this into a revenge/angst/rivalry thing, but I will say 
that this was one of the reasons the Gozz kill was so sweet for many of us who 
have worked hard to get to this point. </p>
<p>Moving on from that we had a really good time killing the mob, and while we 
had tried it before, tonight we really seemed to be clicking. With the help of 
our new members, some recruits, and some guests (36 people in total I know you're 
dying to know) we got it killed. Thanks go out to all of the people that helped 
us move on to the next level. The first attempt was close, the second attempt 
was flawless victory.</p>
<p>Sadly, the mantle of greatest tier 1 guild of alltime must now be passed on 
to another deserving guild. We have now become just a face in the non tier 1 crowd 
as we violate the agreements of the tier 1 monarchy. Never fear, we'll get back 
to killing Trak and Sev soon enough because we are addicted and we have fun killing 
them and getting our people some loot. </p>

<p>I dedicate this pathbreaking kill to Jerome Bettis, the greatest big back of 
alltime. Note: I was at this game next to Duridain and enjoyed this touchdown 
immensely, perhaps comparably to how I enjoyed killing Gozzrem.</p>

<h2>We Did It All for the Donkey</h2>
<p>In our neverending quest for donkey loots we killed the donkey aka Zelnithak. 
As always he dropped covted donkey loots and people were excited about them!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/quote9.jpg" width="399" height="17"></p>
<p>...damn Yamile for gathering in all the sweet donkey loot goodness.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/zel2.jpg" width="364" height="150"></p>
<p><i>The Loots: Bracelet of Donkey Beauty, Book of Donkey Lore (Yamile), Teeth 
from Donkey</i></p>
<p>I dedicate the kill of the Donkey to &quot;Mr Wonderful&quot; Paul Orndorff, 
for teaching us that you don't actually have to be able to say wonderful to be 
called &quot;Mr Wonderful&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/orndorfflogo.jpg" width="100" height="125"></p>
<h2>Severilous</h2>
<p>Kind of like Hardy Boys case files or Encyclopedia Brown novels, there seems 
to be a nevernding amount of times that we can kill Severilous. This time though, 
no green scale. Fuck you Severilous.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/sev6.jpg" width="509" height="142"> 
</p>
<p><i>The Loots: Drums, Book (Cydian), Dragon Hero Bracer (Tybrus), Torpor (Adaria), 
Lure of Ice (Nadilye), other spells. </i></p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/sevloot6.jpg" width="211" height="230"></p>
<p>I dedicate this kill of Severilous to the Hardy Boyz, perhaps one of the most 
exciting tag teams ever. Incidentally, typing Hardy Boys at the title of the article 
reminded me of these high-flying WWE superstars as well.</p>

<h2>Trakaniddy</h2>
<p>Cause there wasn't much better to do and because we could use the breastplates 
we went ahead and killed Trakanon. It was fun as always and we were able to score 
a bp for Sorhab. Thanks to all the guests that came along.. hope you guys had 
a good time!<br>
<br>
<img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/trak7.jpg" width="497" height="178"> 
</p>
<p><i>The Loots: Deepwater Breastplate (Sorhab), Cobalt Breastplate, some damn 
teeth (various needers of teeth), Dragon Sinew (Adaria).</i></p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/trakloot7.jpg" width="215" height="231"></p>
<p>I would like to dedicate this kill of Trakanon to the Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, 
because I have enjoyed their music for years and I was enjoying it during the 
trip down to Trak and during the kill.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/bone.jpg" width="364" height="165"></p>
<p>Note: I can not really recomment Resurrection as a favorite album. During the 
Trakanon fight I was enjoying The Art of War, if you must know.</p>

<h2>Severilous </h2>
<p>So, someone walks up to you in an alley and says guess what mob AD just killed 
and I will give you one million dollars. If you don't say Severilous you're a 
god damn fool. When Severilous spawns the first thing he does is / all app. We've 
killed Severilous with a lot of people, with a few people, with an average amount 
of people. We've seen him drop 2 RBB's, 1 RBB, no RBB's and countless shitty bracers. 
We have more green scales in the bank than you can shake a stick at. Hell, warriors 
are contemplating doing their epics. </p>
<p>Anyway, we fuckin kilt him again, because it's a stone cold addiction.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/sev5.jpg" width="449" height="171"></p>
<p><i>The Drops: Pally Book (Sorhab), Green Scale (Blackfayth), Shitass Bracer 
(the ground), some decent spells. </i></p>
<h2>Trakanon</h2>
<p>If that same person gave you two guesses, the smart second guess would be to 
say Trakanon. While our relations with Trakanon have sometimes been rocky, he 
does frequently yield BP's and many Trak teeth. Well, we cemented our rep as THE 
GREATEST TIER 1 GUILD OF ALLTIME, by killing him again.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/dm/trak6.jpg" width="423" height="204"></p>
<p><i>The Drops: Donal's Breastplate of Mourning (Yamile), Jaundiced Bone Breastplate,

<h2>Ruk You</h2>
<p>Because we got sick and damn tired of killing minibosses for the faint hope 
that Zeban could decrease his DPS by getting his other epic, we decided to finally 
just knock it out cold. We were determined to kill Innoruk and get the emerald 
and some RACIAL LOOTS BITCHES. Anyway, we engaged Innoruk and he tossed us about 
for a while as we continued to stab him. He continued to toss us around aggroing 
shit from god knows where. (Luckily for us floor2 mobs have no clue how to get 
to players thanks to uber programming to be sure) Then he tossed us again and 
again till his life bar reached 0. Then we retrived our RACIAL LOOTS BITCHES and 
no shattered emerald. Fuck you Innoruk, and fuck you Plane of Hate.</p>
<p>After this kill, we proudly proclaimed that AD is .. ... . .</p>
<p>THE GREATEST TIER 1 GUILD OF ALLTIME. </p>
<p>(let me give you a moment to digest that..)</p>
<p>THE GREATEST TIER 1 GUILD OF ALLTIME</p>
<p>Other tier one guilds wish they could run it like we do. Trak + Inny = pure 
tier 1 nirvana. Don't hate hate on us because we have the racial loots that cause 
you to cream in bed, come get your own biatches. If you dare take on this pinoccio 
like fellow let it be known he grav fluxes for 100 points. No, I'm not joking 
fools, it was 100 that wasn't a typographical error. </p>

Congratulations Sylor! We can't get any of the slowing swords because for some 
reasons none of the Plane of Hate minibosses, or hell, even Innoruk himself (see 
above) will do us the kind courtesy of dropping the emerald so we can <i>get the 
fuck out of Hate</i>. If you have Shattered Emeralds of Corrution you want to

<h2>Severilous</h2>
<p>Last night, as we've been known to do, we killed Severilous. The only moderately 
interesting part of the fight was that I failed to Dire Charm Severilous' Pet. 
Anyway, we got some loot. As I wrote this update I was forced to log on again
