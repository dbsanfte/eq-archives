      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">Y</font>our guild 

        has a FAQ? Are people really asking you questions on a frequent basis 

        about your guild? </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">Q</font>uiet, you. 

        I won't lie; I made up all the questions myself.</p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">W</font>hat does 

        Appotus Dominus mean?</p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">T</font>here is 

        actually a story about how we got our name that has a modicum of entertainment 

        value. </p>

      <p>Originally, we wanted to be called &quot;Cobra Kai&quot; after the sinister 

        Dojo in the loved Karate Kid movies. However, we submitted this name and 

        it was denied because it was supposedly &quot;media&quot;. Despite our 

        moans of protest the powers that be crushed our name and left us to curl 

        in the fetal position. Many tears were shed, and bitter words were spoken 

        about Verant.</p>

      <p>Next, in out attempts to get a cool name past the 'thought police' or 

        'Gestapo' at Verant we came up with &quot;Drunken Masters&quot;. The rejoicing 

        began. This was our name, this was us, this was our true calling. As we 

        talked more we discussed how we would like to kill large mobs in-game 

        drunk. The excitement rippled through our small group as we patted ourselves 

        on the back. Surely, this name would make it through! </p>

      <p>Then, like an anvil from the sky, the slam down fell upon us. It nearly 

        crushed us. I personally wanted weep for days in my room with a hearty 

        supply of Bon Bons and Wendy's hamburgers. For what its worth they told 

        us we should not have any reference to being drunk in the game. </p>

      <p>/rant on <br>

        This is the most preposterous thing I have ever heard of in my whole life. 

        These morons walk around in the game and HAND ME ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES. 

        I can brew them if I want. I can drink them at any time. I can get drunk 

        in game. However, I can't make a guild mentioning being drunk in a humorous 

        way. <br>

        /Rant off</p>

      <p>This really crushed our spirits. However, Whiteout took it upon himself 

        to do a little scholarly research. He translated Drunken Masters into 

        Latin, and lo and behold it sounded cool. Next Verant asked us what this 

        meant. We kindly told them it meant &quot;clumsy masters&quot;. Whether 

        out of stone cold laziness, the lack of desire to deal with our angry 

        emails, or because they simply approved of this we were approved. Hence 

        Appotus Dominus was born. It means &quot;Drunken Masters&quot; in Latin.</p>

      <p><br>

        <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">W</font>hat is the 

        basis for the guild?</p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">T</font>he guild 

        is based around four friends (?) who like to play EQ together. Those founding 

        fathers are Dapper, Whiteout, Yamile, and Ciliem.. What makes the guild 

        special is that on weekends we all go over to Dapper's house (much to 

        the chagrin of his wife) and play EQ for something like 20 hours. We operate 

        in a highly efficient way and we are good at what we do. </p>

      <p>We have the guild tag for guildchat. If that's all we ever have it for, 

        we frankly do not care. We are not desperate for your ass, or to change 

        how we operate. If you suggest a lot of changes you will not be revered, 

        bottom line. We are dogmatic and we all get angry quickly. The way to 

        our hearts is through stone cold ass kissing. Don't want to? Good, we 

        didn't need you anyway. </p>

      <p><br>

        <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">W</font>hat are the 

        goals for the guild?</p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">W</font>e don't 

        know, okay? Basically, we have these raging fights every weekend. Occasionally, 

        I have wanted to blacken the eyes of many of my dear guildmates. We have 

        problems getting along most times, so that makes it very hard for us to 

        decide where we want it to go. There are only a few key things that we 

        want to do right now:</p>

      <p>(A) We are going to 60, asap.<br>

        (B) We want phat lewts.<br>

        (C) We will try almost anything. We did efreeti lord with our highest 

        character at 48 (a druid no less). We went to Seb with a 43 cleric in 

        tow. We camped Frenzy in the high 30s. </p>

      <p>So, whether we grow or not is up in the air. If you are cool, and we 

        like playing with you then you will probably get an invite. If you have 

        an interest in being a part of a small elite team, then we are interested. 

        We are not Epic Heroes (No disrespect to Epic Heroes, but a full 50% of 

        morons I've met in game carry that tag.), or any such similar guild. We 

        want quality, not quantity. </p>

      <p><br>

        <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">W</font>hat cool 

        things do you have planned?</p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">I</font>n the future, 

        we plan to have fabulous videos of us killing mobs. These mobs should 

        have in game footage and will be set to our favorite music. We realize 

        this is not a unique idea, and we frankly don't care. We think it's cool 

        and we're doing it. </p>

      <p>We are also planning to punk out large mobs. Anything that can be done 

        with a single group we will be doing soon. </p>

      <p></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">W</font>ant to come 

        on a raid with my uber guild and get uber lewtz?</p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">Y</font>es, we do. 

        If you are going on raids and need some people, we will come along. Generally, 

        we do not like to be broken up from our group. However, we will do it. 

        We are interested in allying with other guilds. However, currently we 

        are completely uninterested in joining someone else's. We won't get you 

        killed if you invite us along, we promise. </p>

      <p>That said, we're an exping guild right now. We want to gain levels. So, 

        generally, we don't care if we get any invites right now or not. People 

        will know about us soon enough. </p>

      <p><br>

        <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">Y</font>ou're quite 

        the cocky dickhead aren't you?</p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">T</font>his is our 

        rhetoric, of course I am. I'm really much nicer in game, unless you're 

        a moron or want me to make you velium jewelry for 200pp. </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">W</font>hen do you 

        normally play?</p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">M</font>ost of the 

        guild is in the Eastern and Central Time Zones. Most member play during 

        the night time areas in their time zone and then much of the weekend. 

        There is also a AD nightshift that is &quot;run&quot; by Whiteout who 

        works third shift so there is usually a few players on during the night 

        time hours of EST. </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">H</font>ow do I 

        get points? </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">P</font>oints are 

        awarded for attending &quot;raid type&quot; events. These events REQUIRE 

        MORE THAN 1 GROUP TO DO, otherwise the single group loot code applies. 

        Only Dapper, or I (Ciliem) have the power to award points. Unless specified 

        in advance, there will be no points awarded for small enocunters, such 

        as epic ones. The points are divided as follows:</p>

      <p>A Small Raid Type Event is worth 3 points. </p>

      <p>These are smaller events that take a minimal amount of time, but take 

        a few groups to do. Killing some smaller dragons, easy to get to big daddies 

        etc etc. There are special situations which can affect how many points 

        you receive: </p>

      <ul>

        <li>(-3) You get no points for being late to these events. If we are doing 

          something and you make it late, after all of the action is over, or 

          are no help to us because you are late you will receive no points, bottom 

          line. </li>

        <li>(-3) You leave early, you get no points. Since most of these events 

          are fairly straightforward you are either here or you're not. </li>

        <li>(+.5) You are level 55 or greater. If you have busted your ass to 

          get to 55+ we give you a bonus because we want the guild to be high 

          levels. </li>

        <li>(+1) You get a full point bonus for being a level 60. Again, we want 

          the prestige and being 60 makes everything as easy as it can be. </li>

      </ul>

      <p>A large raid event is worth 7 points. </p>

      <p>These are raids of the planes and are long term commitment events. They 

        take a lot of time so you get more points. Again, before we embark the 

        size of the event will be determined. Here are the adjustments:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>(-2) You are late to the event. You arrive early enoug where you can 

          be of service, but we have already done a lot without you. </li>

        <li>(-2) You leave early from the event. In some of these events the need 

          to leave early is inevitable. While we realize this is not your fault 

          sometimes, you must be penalized so the &quot;hard core&quot; don;t 

          get sleighted. </li>

        <li>(+.5) You are level 55 or greater. If you have busted your ass to 

          get to 55+ we give you a bonus because we want the guild to be high 

          levels. </li>

        <li>(+1) You get a full point bonus for being a level 60. Again, we want 

          the prestige and being 60 makes everything as easy as it can be. </li>

      </ul>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">H</font>ow do I 

        use points to buy items? </p>

      <p><font size="+3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">W</font>hen we are 

        in a raid situation, items that are Uber will drop. No Drop items will 

        be bought and paid for on the spot, and other items will be collected 

        for an end of raid auction. If you see an item you want, it <b>must be 

        usable by your class for you to bid on</b>. There will be a starting bid 

        assigned, and if you have the points, you bid on the item. If others in 

        the same class want the item, they can overbid you. Starting bids will 

        be determined based on relative desirability of the item. </p>

      <p>A few rules apply: </p>

      <ul>

        <li>If you bid and win an item you may not bid on another one until people 

          of your class have either passed on what else is there, or have purchased 

          one themselves. This prevents longtime members from forcing new guild 

          members to attend raids for months while they get nothing. </li>

        <li>No Drop Items are an oddity. If a No Drop item drops, and you want 

          it but do not have the points for it YOU MAY GO INTO THE HOLE TO GET 

          IT. This prevents people from having possible upgrades to them rot on 

          the ground. IE you have 3 points, a tight item drops and you are the 

          only one of your class there, its a 10 point item, you may go to minus 

          7. However, people who have points and want the item will be given priority. 

          Obviously, when you have minus points you can;t bid on regular items 

          because you have no points. There is no further negative to having minus 

          points. </li>

        <li>If items are not bid on by anyone they go into the guild vault for 

          two weeks. During these two weeks ONLY A CLASS THAT CAN USE THE ITEM 

          may purchase it at any time for a price that will be determined. If 

          after two weeks, the item remains in the vault, it is opened to ANYONE 

          WHO WANTS IT at the set price. The items in the guild vault will be 

          published on a regular basis. Ciliem (me) controls the guild vault and 

          any questions come to me regarding this. </li>

      </ul>

      <p>How many points each guild member has will be posted on a regular basis. 

        If you have a question or a mistake was made in your points, please post 

        a reply to the message that lists the points in it so I can get it fixed 

        immediately. </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">A</font>re there 

        raids fees? </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">N</font>o</p>

      <p><font size="+3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">D</font>o I have 

        to use the points system as well?</p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">Y</font>es, the 

        points system applies to EVERYONE IN THE GUILD. Dapper will have to accumulate 

        points as anyone else will have to. Points and items will be published 

        on a regular basis. We don't play favorites, if you come to hella raids, 

        you get hella points. </p>
