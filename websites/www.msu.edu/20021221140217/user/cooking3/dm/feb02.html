      <h2>Select Few Spots Still Open</h2>

      <p> As a guild with purpose, pride, and a <a href="http://pub33.ezboard.com/fappotusdominusdrunkenmastersfrm5">growing 

        list of accomplishments</a> we have a certain idea in mind about what 

        we want out of people to join our guild. The initial push has ended for 

        people. We have most of the numbers that we need to do most of the things 

        we need to do in the short term. However, there are some important holes 

        in the <a href="roster.html">roster</a> that we are looking at filling. 

        We are in need of: </p>

      <p><b>Rogue</b>: We need a rogue on the team to open certain doors, do awesome 

        backstab damage, and to disarm traps. You should be able to raid during 

        the weekend, be friendly, and not be satisfied with your level unless 

        it is 60. </p>

      <p><b>Wizard</b>: We need some wizards on the team to port us to certain 

        planes as well as finish off some large gating mobs. The nuking power 

        of wizards as well as the convenient porting is a service that AD is in 

        desperate need of. In terms of the same playstyle ideals apply as with 

        the rogue. </p>

      <p><b>Bard</b>: We need a bard to give us occlusion of sound and give us 

        access to some nice stacking effects. We also need a bard so we can stop 

        letting multiple BP's rot wherever we go. For whatever reason we have 

        stupid luck with bard loot. </p>

      <p><b>Necromancer</b>: When things go wrong, we need someone with coffins 

        ready to summon us out. While Vanswer works in the short term, a necro 

        is also needed for DMF and the plethora of mana enhancing abilities they 

        can provide. </p>

      <p><b>Cleric</b>: We need one more cleric to round out our squad. You have 

        to know how to heal enchanters, and you have to be able to save yourself 

        when you get agro. Also, you have to read your screen to know when to 

        camp.</p>

      <p>These are the spots that we need. If you have questions about the guild, 

        our <a href="recruiting.html">recruiting procedures</a>, or anything else 

        please don't hesitate to <a href="contact.html">e-mail</a> or post on 

        the <a href="http://pub33.ezboard.com/bappotusdominusdrunkenmasters">forums</a>. 

        In addition to this, it should be noted that we are looking for these 

        classes and not begging. This means that you will not get (a) loot precedence, 

        (b) special treatment, or (c) skipped over steps in the recruiting process. 

        We don't mess around with people that aren't on the same page as the rest 

        of the guild. We all have goals, and we need a certain type of person 

        to help us reach those goals. If you are not helping us, you are hurting 

        us. </p>

      <h2>Hate: Floor 2</h2>

      <p> After a rather late night at the royals, the plans to take on the second 

        floor seemed to be in some rather dire straits. However, we did manage 

        to push through the first floor in quick order and make it to the second 

        floor. </p>

      <p>We killed many of the minibosses and survived some strange agro incidents 

        in some cases due to the laughable pathing of the zone. Nonetheless we 

        got quite a stash of prized loot including the Darkmetal Falchion for 

        Fenlaorn. It was rather uneventful save a strange corpse that we found 

        near the Maestro. </p>

      <p>Fadorn, 55 Rogue (Unbroken Spirit), made a bold penetration into Hate 

        alone the night before to recover his note and was run down. We chatted 

        with him for some time and eventually he did come up and get his note. 

        Appotus Dominus congratulates Fadorn on his note, and wish him the best 

        of luck getting his epic! Unfortunately, the corpse was too old to receive 

        a rez.</p>

      <p>With our plans of destroying other exciting loot dropping mobs destroyed 

        for the evening, we had no choice but to turn our attentions to a new 

        threat. Since our inception the raid on the royals has been a goal we 

        always wondered if we would be able to accomplish with limited numbers 

        (18 people, average lvl: 56). Since everyone's spirits were already in 

        the shitter, we decided upon a raid to the king for 2 cleric notes.</p>

      <p>Certainly, everything did not go 100% peachy, but in the end we did emerge 

        with two of the prized notes. We did recover from almost a complete wipeout 

        in very quick order to preserve the raid thanks to some heads up camping 

        by the clerics. The first king pull was really a botched operation, and 

        the night did end rather sourly as our chances at the queen were undermined 

        by some ill-fated agro. </p>

      <p>Nonetheless we were able to defeat the king and his vaunted dispelling 

        fire AOE with minimal difficulty. </p>

      <p>Special thanks to Fenlaorn for dual comping of Thoron for the majority 

        of the time</p>

      <p>The Plane of Growth raid was perhaps the most anticipated raid in the 

        short existence of AD. Many people had hoped that growth would be a repeat 

        of Hate or Fear with more mobs, more loots, and better loot. With our 

        hopes high, we broke into the plane, in hopes of destroying faction with 

        homo elves everywhere.</p>

      <p>What we found were mobs that weren't terribly difficult, and a lot of 

        them. We cut bloody swathes through an ungodly amount of mobs. Dabamf 

        aided us in his trademark Velketor pulling style by keeping mbos flowing 

        in a steady stream. At nights end, with only a couple of preposterous 

        gates to sour the evening, we had cleared 75% of the plane. Perhaps these 

        miscues were caused by a severe dampening of enthusiasm that comes with 

        shit drops. </p>

      <p>We came out with no legs, and no BPs for our efforts. We killed many 

        of the miniboss type mobs only to find that they had either research pages 

        or nothing on their corpses. While there certainly were some upgrades, 

        the loot situation turned out to be downright sad. These growth mobs are 

        stingy and they gave us the royal shaft.</p>

        that Dabamf needed killed and he proceeded to get his bubbly cool fists.

      <p>On Friday night we attempted our first foray into the Western Wastes 

        (aka &quot;dub dub&quot;) with 16 people, succor, and an open mind. In 

        terms of loots we did okay. In terms of corpse runs we did okay. In terms 

        of killing dragons we did okay.</p>

      <p>As far as loot goes we found that many of the fabulous dragons and large 

        named mammoths give you fat Johnson across your face many times. However, 

        the loots were not completely a bust as we retrieved some devent spells 

        and a pretty tight talisman for Whiteout. </p>

      <p>We only had one corpse run. This, was caused by (Ladi Dadi) Glati (likes 

        to party) gating all the way to the northeast corner of the zone and summoning 

        three lucky people to their deaths. This was fairly easily resolved by 

        some tricky monk work.<br>

        <br>

        With all of the technical stuff out of the way, the most glorious fight 

        that we attempted was Von. We were able to beat Von due to the dedication 

        of two rangers, a drood, a leezard, and a cleric. Battas, Vashen, Zeban, 

        Carraaki, and Dapper were left to kill Von when he was left at 20 percent 

        life. Apparently, Von had run out of mana from Gfluxing everyone else 

        to hell because he was content to melee with Carr and the rangers for 

        quite some time. However, being slowed he was doing enough for Battas 

        to keep up with. For long moments we wondered if Von would get enough 

        mana to begin Gfluxing people again, but it never happened. The braver 

        rangers, warrior, and uhh, druid were able to melee Von down and gain 

        us a stupendous victory. </p>
