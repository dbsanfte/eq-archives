      <h2>Primary Membership Requirements</h2>
      <p>The minimum level limit to join Appotus Dominus is nominally 50. This 
        limit may vary depending on class. The level limit is imposed due to the 
        face that we do not guild people who cannot group or raid with the guild, 
        as this is not fair to either the guild or the prospective member. </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Must be Level 50+<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Must have your Old-Seblis key and actively working on both your Charasis 
          and Veeshan&#146;s Peak keys. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Own or have access to an enduring breath device (such as a Fishbone 
          Earring or Aqualung). The reason for this is that zones like Kedge Keep, 
          The Grey, Sirens Grotto, and other epic encounters require these.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Be actively working on your Epic. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Achieve an unbuffed 100 magic resistance in addition to 100 in either 
          fire resistance, cold resistance or poison resistance with respective 
          resistance equipment. (e.g. Fire resist gear which would include rings, 
          earings, neclace, braclets, etc.)<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Attend at Least 5 major raids with the guild.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Fully agree to the various guild policies such as raid, loot, and 
          membership. Ignorance is not an excuse. If you don't like them, feel 
          free not to join. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Be a required Class. We recruit for a guild balance, so not all classes 
          have openings all the time <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Members are recruited for their primary character and are expected 
          to play these most of the time, feel free to play an alternate character, 
          but they will not be guilded unless both the primary and secondary characters 
          meet the requirements from alternate characters section listed below.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Keep your Magelo (<a href="http://www.magelo.com">www.magelo.com</a>) 
          profile updated on a regular basis.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Joining the Guild</h2>
      <p>In order to achieve these aims, and avoid the mistakes of many other 
        guilds, we have a fairly strict and somewhat slow recruitment policy. 
        However it is done for a reason, as we do not want to recruit the wrong 
        people, and experience has shown that the right people are willing to 
        wait, and go to that extra effort required. All recruitment is administered 
        by the officers in charge of recruitment and is a 4 step process. </p>
      <p>Step 1. Application to Join</p>
      <p>In Order to submit an application for membership to the guild, you must: 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Meet the membership requirements <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Be officially sponsored by at least 2 active members who are currently 
          in good standing with the rest of the guild. It is YOUR responsibility 
          to talk to existing members, and obtain sponsors, not the guilds. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Post your application on our message board, including why you wish 
          to join, and who will sponsor you. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>This application is reviewed by the guild recruitment officers, and a 
        decision made weather to accept it, reject it at this time, or delay decision. 
        You will be contacted by one of the officers in charge of recruitment 
        and told the result. </p>
      <p>Step 2. Evaluation period</p>
      <p>If your initial application is accepted, you will start an evaluation 
        period. During this time you will have similar privileges, as well as 
        guild expectations as a guild member as regard to raid attendance, groups, 
        etc. It is expected that during this time, associate members will actively 
        seek out guild members for groups and at the same time, guild members 
        will actively invite associate members so each can evaluate the other. 
        During the evaluation, each recruit will have a thread started on the 
        Guild Applicants Discussion forum, so members can discuss them, post comments, 
        and offer there support for them. You are expected to raid with the guild 
        exactly the same as a member. The officer keep a list on raid attendance 
        and this will be used to evaluate attendance.</p>
      <p>Depending on the person, this period may be waived entirely or very short 
        and voting may start immediately on the person&#146;s application. However, 
        this will only happen if they are well know and have raided with us often, 
        or perhaps we have a hole with a certain class that needs to be urgently 
        filled, etc and is solely at the discretion and judgment of the recruiting 
        officers and the guild leader. </p>
      <p>Step 3. Guild Vote</p>
      <p>At some stage after your application, request for voting by the guild 
        on the private Applicant Voting Booth forum. This will most likely now 
        only happen twice a calendar month, depending on requirements. This allows 
        new people to integrate into the guild as opposed to a steady stream of 
        new people. Voting is not like an election, certain numbers don't guarantee 
        you will or won't always be accepted, and other factors are still taken 
        into account by the Officers. </p>
      <p>In order to ensure a majority of the guild is happy with a new recruit, 
        voting is as Follows. </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Voting will normally be open up to a week and members may Vote YES, 
          NO, or MORTAL ENEMY. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>A applicant needs 75% of the currently active guild members vote YES 
          to be accepted. (Regardless of how many vote). Also if more than approximately 
          10% vote NO, it will be looked at very closely as to why. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Voting *MORTAL ENEMY* is reserved for people that will quit if a person 
          is recruited, or hates them, etc. This MUST be explained to the recruit 
          officers or the guild leader in private however if reasonable, then 
          the application will be rejected. We will NEVER recruit someone that 
          will result in a current guild member quitting. Abuse of this vote just 
          for someone you don't like, but no concrete reason, will not be tolerated, 
          and the vote will be considered as a *No*. This is at the discretion 
          of the recruitment officers and the guild leader, but allows even a 
          single member a strong say in who is recruited. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Voting will shortly become Secret Ballot, however voting IS compulsory. 
          <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>If there is not enough yes votes then the application will be waived 
          for another few weeks to allow the person to get to know more people, 
          and voted on again. Again, recruiting officers will use their discretion. 
          A recruitment officer will contact you to inform you of the outcome. 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Step 4. Get Invited into the Guild</p>
      <p>How and where this is done will be decided at the time. The ONLY people 
        that can execute a /GUILDINVITE for a person are the recruitment officers 
        and the guild leader, no one else. </p>
      <p>Step 5. Ongoing Membership </p>
      <p>After one month, the officers will revue all new recruits to determine 
        weather they really were suitable for the guild, and the guild for them. 
        Any decisions about continued membership are solely at the discretion 
        of the guild leader. Every member should continually works to earn their 
        guild tag and better the guild. No more or less is expected of new or 
        existing memebrs. </p>
      <h2>Recruitment Officers</h2>
      <p> Currently the recruitment officers are <a href="mailto:dapper@appotusdominus.com">Dapper</a>, 
        <a href="mailto:fenlaorn@appotusdominus.com">Fenlaorn</a>, and <a href="mailto:whiteout@appotusdominus.com">Whiteout</a>. 
        Contact one of us in game for further information. </p>
      <h2>Alternate/Secondary Characters</h2>
      <p>It is understandable that members, especially at a high level, need/want 
        to play secondary characters. This provides a number of benefits, including 
        diversity, reducing stress, and any other number of good reasons. That 
        being said, we don&#146;t want a guild full of &#147;Twinks&#148;, nor 
        do we want people playing their alternate characters and not leveling 
        their primary characters. </p>
      <h2>Secondary Character Policy<br>
      </h2>
      <p>All full members of the guild who are level 60 may have one (1) alternate 
        character guilded as well; however the following requirements must be 
        met. </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The primary character must be Level 60. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>The second character must be level 46+. This is somewhat arbitrary 
          level; however it provides a good balance between the effort required 
          to achieve, which shows the character is not just a &#147;Twink&#148;, 
          but is a true, secondary character. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>The Person has been a Guild member for at least 2 weeks. (We want 
          to get to know your primary character in guild chat and have everyone 
          comfortable with them, before adding alternate characters. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Secondary characters are guilded by the recruitment officers or the 
          guild l leader only and the secondary character information will be 
          noted on the membership roster under your primary character name. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>In order to have your secondary character guilded, please contact 
          a recruit officer in game, and they will be happy to oblige. </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Leaving / Discharge Policy</h2>
      <p>Managing to get kicked out of Appotus Dominus is fairly hard, but it 
        is doable. Only the guild leader will remove people under advisement from 
        the officers. The process goes.</p>
      <p>&#149; Warning<br>
        &#149; On probation 1-4 weeks.<br>
        &#149; Bye Bye.</p>
      <p>NOTE: De-Guilding as a form of protest over some issue is NOT an acceptable 
        form of protest.</p>
      <h2>Final Note</h2>
      <p>In order to prevent repetition of the mistakes of the past/other guild, 
        this recruitment policy will be adhered to, however is still at the discretion 
        of the officers and guild leader. Guilds are meant to last forever, players 
        come and go, if it takes that little bit extra time to ensure we have 
        the right people, then so be it. We understand we run the risk of loosing 
        potential good players to other guild because they don't want to wait, 
        however we are not here to cater for everyone, but to build up a good, 
        solid guild of loyal, trustworthy friends.</p>
