      <p>There really were few deaths to speak of save one unsavory incident with 

        a &quot;very unpleasant&quot; hand. We wiped the entire floor clean of 

        loot bearing mobs and collected 2 Cleric BPs, 2 Warrior BP's. 2 epic pieces, 

        and countless other pieces of armor to improve our guild. The raid overall 

        was fairly uneventful and ran smoothly.<br>

        <br>

        Perhaps the biggest accomplishment of the day was beating Maestro like 

        a drum. We pulled him to the safe spot and waxed him with only a few deaths. 

        (Tip: he really hates the Rune line of spells). Our mass tanking monking 

        pallying power was too much for him and he was broken off with no melee 

        casualties. In addition to Maestro, we also beat down the monk mini boss 

        who was kicking it on the first floor. </p>

      <p> Aside from this eventful moment there really isn't too much to say. 

        We broke in, broke off mobs, and broke out. However, it did take us a 

        fairly lengthy 10 hours because of levels and numbers. Next time, (soon) 

        we are shaving off HOURS because our monks will be familiar, our enchanters 

        will know what mobs mex easily, and our tanks will have levels and phat 

        gear. Second floor: soon. </p>

      <h2>Welcome New Members!</h2>

      <p> At roughly the same time we gained two new members into the Appotus 

        Dominus crew. The first recruit we officially guilded was 54 Warrior Mycro. 

        Mycro had been along with us on a couple raids and many long boring exp 

        groups (and even the Xalgoz camp). We found his tanking to be admirable 

        and more importantly his COMMITMENT and his no nonsense playstyle to be 

        a fit with us. Mycro busted Hate's azz with us on Sunday and this was 

        a great start to his AD career. </p>

      <p> 54 Cleric Battas was a long time friend who initially joined us in the 

        Seb Disco a month or two ago. After grouping with him on and off over 

        the past month both parties eventually came to the conclusion that we 

        were like-minded in terms of loots and in game goals Battas has never 

        failed us in battle and has many of the same traits that led us to recruit 

        Mycro. </p>

      <p>We broke the portal with two groups and after chipping away at the mobs 

        a couple of times and many casters running in buck ass naked to assist 

        in the fights we were successful. After the portal break we wondered how 

        long it would be before Yamile was able to get the cleric epic as perhaps 

        25 corpses lay ready for rezzing.</p>

      <p>After we broke the portal it was pretty much smooth sailing. Dabamf, 

        Keepson, and Dapper were able to keep the pulls coming at a steady rate 

        and we cleared most of the zone, leaving only the fright fingers in the 

        depths of the zone because we had no wizard. </p>

      <p>Overall, it was a successful night and we got Dapper, Whiteout, and Slackin 

        some nice gear as well as spying a glimpse of Cazic Thule. It's only a 

        matter of time, bish. We will not only be 'tainting your plane' but tapping 

        your azz and bringing home your phat lewts. The next step: 2 group fear 

        raid. </p>

      <h2>This Just In: Bones on the Floor is Trouble</h2>

      <p>On Friday night, we attempted to make it to the Prince in Chardok. None 

        of us really knew much about Chardok, and this cost us a few times throughout 

        the course of the night. We were able to penetrate fairly deep the first 

        time when our enchanter got lambasted by a couple of undead Sarnak fellows.</p>

      <p>We re-upped our forces, got some coffins and rolled back in for a second 

        attempt. We got even closer to the noble areas this time, only to find 

        bones on the floor and insane pathing bring a healthy 6 mobs our way. 

        We fought valiantly, but they got the better of us. Next time, we are 

        making it to the prince come hell or high water!</p>

      <p>While it may have been somewhat ill advised for us to venture into Chardok 

        with only two groups, that is what we are about. We have no interest in 

        zergling rushing Chardok with 55 people in tow and singing our praises 

        afterwards. We almost made it, and soon you will see a story similar to 

        this one that has some catchy title involving the Prince's head. Appotus 

        Dominus: down but not out!</p>

      <h2><a name="lava"></a>Us to Mr. Lava: You Suck.</h2>

      <p> After our Chardok plans came crashing down, we decided to do a piece 

        of the monk epic. We took on Eejag, a preposterous fellow who lives in 

        lava. After finally being able to successfully find him and stay with 

        him (and Cral's summoning of useful items), we killed this fellow. At 

        about 5:15AM the evening concluded, and we all thoroughly hate Eejag and 

        his shenanigans. </p>

      <p>If you think fighting a mob in lava is fun or cool, you have clearly 

        never killed Eejag. </p>

      <h2>Loot Code</h2>

      <p>We have released a <a href="bylaws.html#loot">new loot code version 2.0</a>. 

        Everyone should read and understand what is in the code and if you have 

        questions or problems with this we need to know it about it now. Please 

        <a href="contact.html">e-mail us </a>or visit our <a href="http://pub33.ezboard.com/bappotusdominusdrunkenmasters">forum

      <h2>Want in?</h2>

      <p>For whatever reason, we have been getting requests to join Appotus lately. 

        We have created a procedure that will determine who is in and who is left 

        to join Agony. This procedure works as follows:</p>

      <ol>

        <li>Let us know you're interested</li>

        <li>We will group with you as much as we can for a period of two weeks</li>

        <li>After the two weeks there will be a voting from all guild people.</li>

        <li>Options are No, Nuetral, Yes. </li>

        <li>If you are voted neutral there is another two week period</li>

        <li>If you get another neutral it will be translated to a 'no'.</li>

      </ol>

      <p>Some people who we have already been recruited may simply be admitted 

        if we have previously determined we like them. However, expect to go through 

        this procedure to be admitted. We want to be a top quality guild, so we 

        want top quality people. Contact <a href="mailto:dapper@appotusdominus.com">dapper@appotusdominus.com</a>

      <h2>A Monster Mash</h2>

      <p>After getting a late start due to internet problems, we decided to make 

        a trip to Sebilis in hopes of gaining some loot. While the weekend turned 

        out to be largely a bust by recent standards, we did have an especially 

        good night in the crypt.</p>

      <p>The attendees to this fiesta were:</p>

      <p>Ciliem 53 Enchanter<br>

        Dapper 54 Druid<br>

        Yamile 50 Cleric<br>

        Whiteout 54 Shaman<br>

        Thoron 53 Rogue<br>

        Fenlaorn 56 Paladin<br>

        Dabamf 54 Monk</p>

      <p>Thoron was dragged along by his roommate, Fen for the majority of the 

        evening until he got home from a movie. (Harry Potter, I suspect!) While 

        I would love to tell harrowing tales, if you've ever been to the crypt 

        you know that the potential for exciting mob killing action is really 

        at a minimum.</p>

      <p>However, the chances for phat lewts, are significantly better. We got 

        many named spawns throughout the night and the highlight of the night 

        was 2 Heirophant Cloaks. The cloaks went to Whiteout and Yamile, congratulations!</p>

      <p>We plan to revisit the crypt many times in the future as well as expand 

        our raiding plans. </p>
