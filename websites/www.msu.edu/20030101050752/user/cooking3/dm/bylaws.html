      <h2>Rules of Conduct</h2>



      <ol>



        <li>Everyone should be treated with respect regardless of affiliation. 



        <li>When grouping or on a guild raid, do not engage in trading petty insults 



          with other players over /OOC or /SHOUT. Obviously friendly teasing is 



          permitted but should be limited. 



        <li>Do not use guildchat for petty arguments or disagreements. Use tells. 



        <li>When grouping or on raids, make sure you understand and abide by the 



          looting rules. If you don't know, ask. Please see the <a href="#loot">Loot 



          Code below</a> for further guild root rules. 



        <li>Training others is not allowed. This includes training to get revenge 



          on someone. This obviously sometimes happens by mistake, but if it is 



          found that it was intentional, the issue will be looked into. 



        <li>Members are dedicated to play that puts Appotus Dominus - Drunken 



          Masters in the best possible light. That means avoiding arguments in 



          the shout and out of character channels with other players and guild. 



          If you have a disagreement with another person, please take it to tells 



          and try to work out an amiable solution between the two of you. If need 



          be, please contact an officer and discuss the situation. 



        <li>Intentional looting out of turn, ninja looting, disband/loot/log, 



          and Kill Stealing are strictly prohibited and can result in de-guilding. 



      </ol>



      <h2>Continuing Membership Requirements</h2>



      <ol>


<li>Actively working towards level 65</li>
       
	   
	    <li>Must have your Old-Seblis key and actively working on both your Charasis, 



         Veeshan&#146;s Peak , and Emporer keys. </li>



        <li>Own an enduring breath device (such as a Fishbone Earring).</li>




        <li>Achieve an unbuffed 100 magic resistance in addition to 100 in either 



          fire resistance, cold resistance or poison resistance.</li>



        <li>Fully understand to the various guild policies such as raid, loot, 



          and membership.</li>



        <li>Keep your Magelo (<a href="http://www.magelo.com">www.magelo.com</a>) 



          profile updated on a regular basis.</li>



      </ol>



           <h2>Alternate/Secondary Characters</h2>







      <p>It is understandable that members, especially at a high level, need/want 







        to play secondary characters. This provides a number of benefits, including 







        diversity, reducing stress, and any other number of good reasons. That 







        being said, we don&#146;t want a guild full of &#147;Twinks&#148;, nor 







        do we want people playing their alternate characters and not leveling 







        their primary characters. </p>







      <h2>Secondary Character Policy<br>







      </h2>







      <p>All full members of the guild who are level 60 may have one (1) alternate 







        character guilded as well; however the following requirements must be 







        met. </p>







      <ol>







        <li>The primary character must be Level 60. <br>







          <br>







        </li>







        <li>The second character must be level 50+. This is a somewhat arbitrary 







          level; however it provides a good balance between the effort required 







          to achieve, which shows the character is not just a &#147;Twink&#148;, 







          but is a true, secondary character. <br>







          <br>







        </li>







        <li>The Person has been a Guild member for at least 2 weeks. (We want 







          to get to know your primary character in guild chat and have everyone 







          comfortable with them, before adding alternate characters.) <br>







          <br>







        </li>







        <li>Secondary characters are guilded by the recruitment officers or the 







          guild leader only and the secondary character information will be 







          noted on the membership roster under your primary character name. <br>







          <br>







        </li>







        <li>In order to have your secondary character guilded, please contact 







          a recruitment officer in game, and they will be happy to oblige. </li>







      </ol>



      <h2>Leaving / Discharge Policy</h2>



      <p>Managing to get kicked out of Appotus Dominus is fairly hard, but it 



        is doable. Only the guild leader will remove people under advisement from 



        the officers. The process goes.</p>



      <p>&#149; Warning<br>



        &#149; On probation 1-4 weeks.<br>



        &#149; Bye Bye.</p>



      <p>NOTE: De-Guilding as a form of protest over some issue is NOT an acceptable 



        form of protest. Any member may leave the guild at any time for any reason, 



        if they want to do so. Please give guild officers prior notice before 



        leaving. If you leave the guild only under extreme circumstances will 



        you be let back in. Please make sure to think long and hard before making 



        this important decision. </p>



      <h2><a name="loot"></a>The Loot Rules</h2>



      


      <h2><a name="raid"></a>Points System</h2>



     <p>The question of uber loots comes up in every guild. We are getting to the point 

	 in which we will be raiding and getting awesome items. In the past we have distributed 

	 items we get in a free flowing and easy manner. This is not a long term solution, 

	 therefore this code was implemented. Rather than a simple dictator system, in which 

	 unpleasantries would inevitably ensue, we elected to create a &quot;points&quot; system 

	 based largely on the experiences of Whiteout and Dapper. Without further ado, the point system will work like this:</p>

	 <p>How do I get points? </p>

	 <p>Points are awarded for attending &quot;raid type&quot; events. These events 

	 REQUIRE MORE THAN 1 GROUP TO DO, otherwise the single group loot code applies. 

	 Only Dapper, Dabamf, or Yamile have the power to award points. The points are divided 

	 as follows:</p>

	 <p><strong>A Small Raid Type Event is worth 3 points. (Normally Weekday Raids)</strong><br>

	 These are smaller events that take a minimal amount of time, but take a few groups to do. 

	 Killing some smaller dragons, easy to get to big daddies etc etc. There are special situations 

	 which can affect how many points you receive: </p>

	 <ul><li>(-1) You get negative 1 points for being late to these events</li>

	 <li>(-1) You leave early, negative 1 point. Since most of these events are fairly 

	 straightforward you are either there long enough to help or you're not. </li></ul>

	 
<p><strong>Mid Size raids are worth 5 points. <br>
</strong>These are real and full. 

	 Here are the standard adjustments:</p>

	 <ul><li>(-2) You are late to the event. You arrive early enough where you can be of service, 

	 but we have already done a lot without you. *if you are really late expect to lose more 

	 than 2 points, this will be done at the digression of the points assigner. </li>

	 <li>(-2) You leave early from the event. In some of these events the need to leave early is 

	 inevitable. While we realize this is not your fault sometimes, you must be penalized so 

	 the &quot;hard core&quot; does not feel slighted. *if you are dipping 

	 really early expect to lose more than 2 points, this will be done at the

	 digression of the points assigner. </li>

	 <li>(+.5) You are level 55 or greater. If you have busted your ass to get

	 to 55+ we give you a bonus because we want the guild to be high levels.</li>

	 <li>(+1) You get a full point bonus for being a level 60. Again, we want

	 the prestige and being 60 makes everything as easy as it can be.<br>

	 Note: the bonuses do not apply to guests of the raids. We do not care about

	 the prestige of non-guilded people or care to reward them for it. The bonus

	 for levels is to promote leveling within Appotus Dominus. </li>

	 <li>(+1) You weren't at the raid but people used your character for one

	 purpose or another. </li></ul>

	 
<p><strong>A Large raid event is worth 7 points.<br>
</strong>These are

	 lengthy type raids that are long term commitment events. They take a lot of

	 time so you get more points. Some Saturday raids may occasionally be cut

	 short or shortened due to unforeseen circumstances. This doesn't change

	 their point value. It is a general trend and the point system is intended

	 to reflect the majority and not each situation. We are not getting into a

	 situation where raids are pointed by the hour or any of that bullshit. It

	 is EQ, it is not 5th hour Physics class, we are not taking role. Again,

	 before we embark the size of the event will be determined. Here are the

	 adjustments:</p>

	 <ul><li>(-2) You are late to the event. You arrive early enough where you

	 can be of service, but we have already done a lot without you. *if you're

	 really late expect to lose more than 2 points.</li>

	 <li>(-2) You leave early from the event. In some of these events the need

	 to leave early is inevitable. While we realize this is not your fault

	 sometimes, you must be penalized so the &quot;hard core&quot; does not feel

	 slighted. *if you are dipping really early expect to lose more than 2

	 points. </li>

	 <li>(+.5) You are level 55 or greater. If you have busted your ass to get

	 to 55+ we give you a bonus because we want the guild to be high levels.

	 </li>

	 <li>(+1) You get a full point bonus for being a level 60. Again, we want

	 the prestige and being 60 makes everything as easy as it can be. <br>Note: the bonuses do not apply to guests of the raids. We do not care about the prestige of non-guilded people or care to reward them for it. The bonus for levels is to promote leveling within Appotus Dominus. </li><li>(+1) You weren't at the raid but people used your character for one purpose or another. </li></ul><p>How do I use points to buy items?</p><p>When we are in a raid situation, items that are upgrades will drop. No Drop items will be bought and paid for on the spot, and other items will be collected for an end of raid auction. If you see an item you want, it MUST BE USABLE BY YOUR CLASS FOR YOU TO BID ON. There will be a starting bid assigned, and if you have the points, you bid on the item. If others in the same class want the item, they can overbid you. Starting bids will be determined based on relative desirability of the item. </p><p>A few rules apply: </p>
<ol>
<li>If you bid and win an item you may not bid on another one until people of 
your class have either passed on what else is there, or have purchased one themselves. 
This prevents longtime members from forcing new guild members to attend raids 
for months while they get nothing. The exception to this rule is that any item 
that is purchased for under 10 points will not count towards this rule. Items 
that start above or at 10 points will automatically count as a claim towards that 
days ability to claim loot. </li>
<li>No Drop Items are an oddity. If a No Drop item drops, and you want it but 
do not have the points for it YOU MAY GO INTO THE HOLE TO GET IT. This prevents 
people from having possible upgrades to them rot on the ground. IE you have 3 
points, a tight item drops and you are the only one of your class there, its a 
10 point item, you may go to minus 7. However, people who have points and want 
the item will be given priority. You may only go into the hole to prevent items 
from rotting. If you are in a bidding war with someone, you may not go above your 
total points simply to get the item. In bidding wars the maximum points you have 
is the maximum points you can bid. There is no negative to having minus points. 
</li>
<li> If items are not bid on by anyone they go into the guild vault for two weeks. 
During these two weeks ONLY A CLASS THAT CAN USE THE ITEM may purchase it at any 
time for a price that will be determined. If after two weeks, the item remains 
in the vault, it is opened to ANYONE WHO WANTS IT at a higher set price. The items 
in the guild vault will be published on a regular basis. Dapper controls the guild 
vault and any questions come to him regarding this. </li>
<li>Guild Fire sale -- if the vault is building up an annoying amount of items, 
we will clear it because its cumbersome and lame. The guild earned those items 
and they will be distributed back into the guild for whatever people are willing 
to pay. If items do not sell in the fire sale we will sell them ourselves and 
take the plat and deposit it into the newly created &quot;Guild Fund&quot; in 
order to buy peridots and the like. Items will go down as low as 1 point so the 
junk that does not sell is really absolute junk. </li>
<li>How many points each guild member has will be posted on a regular basis. If 
you have a question or a mistake was made in your points, please post a reply 
to the message that lists the points in it so it can get it fixed immediately. 
</li>
<li>The /ran clause -- If we get what we determine is a stupid amount of an item 
that is not overly desirable in the guild vault we will just /ran for it because 
we don&#8217;t want our bank crowded with the items. These items are completely 
up to our discretion and will probably never be very good. If we end up with 12 
silk robes we will find a way to loot the 13th and vault it. Although, this should 
never feasibly happen. Examples of this shit are leather gloves, silk bracers 
and silk pants from ToV. </li>
<li>The junk clause -- Sometimes items drop on a raid that nobody cares about. 
These items will be absorbed by the guild fund unless someone wants them. They 
will not be formerly announced or go through any points system because its clear 
that they are really poor to average items that would not be worth spending your 
points on. We will do our best to make sure they are announced, but they may not 
always be. If you want these items, it is first come first served and may many 
times end up going to the looter just because people forget. </li>
<li>The Whiner Clause -- do not whine about the loot code or try to point to places 
where it has failed. It has failed in places and it will continue to fail in places. 
It is the best we can come up with, and generally, it works well. It has problems, 
but not as many problems as Dapper handing out loot as he sees fit. If you have 
a legit concern, please bring it up, but always ask yourself before you do 'is 
this really serious, is there a feasible way to fix it, has it previously been 
considered, in essence, is this really a concern or am I just whining for the 
sake of whining?'. </li>
<li>The points cost of certain items may change over a period of time with changes 
with in the guild. Something that dropped 3 months ago does not have the same 
value to most people as it did during that time. For this reason, the price of 
items will change as the guilds access to certain loots progresses. An attempt 
to keep the point differential to a minimum will be exercised. </li>
<li>Guests of raids will bank points that can only be used when they become full 
members of the guild. The only items non-members get must be awarded specifically 
to them by the officers. </li>
<li>Guest Points: While you are an applicant to the guild points are tallied for 
you and are saved in case you get in. If you should get into the guild these will 
be added to your totals. If for whatever reason you enter the guild and leave, 
or cease to be an applicant these points will be voided. If you are an applicant 
again, you will have to start from 0 points. </li>
<li>What order is the loot auctioned in? When a big daddy mob is killed we will 
completely list all of the loot and stats for everyone. Then we will start bidding 
on the items in what seems like best to worst order. This is so people are not 
wondering what the mob has and if they should or should not bid on a current item. 
</li>
</ol>
<p> Does everyone have to use the loot system?</p>

<p> Yes, the points system applies to EVERYONE IN THE GUILD. Dapper will have 

to accumulate points as anyone else will have to. Points and items will be published 

on a regular basis. We don't play favorites, if you come to more raids, you get 

more points. <br>

</p>



</p>



      <h2>Final Note</h2>



      

<p>In order to prevent repetition of the mistakes of the past/other guild, these 

policies will be adhered to, however is still at the discretion of the officers 

and guild leader. Guilds are meant to last forever, players come and go, if it 

takes that little bit extra time to ensure we have the right people, then so be 

it. We understand we run the risk of loosing potential good players to other guild 

because they don't want to wait, however we are not here to cater for everyone, 

but to build up a good, solid guild of loyal, trustworthy friends.</p>
