      <p>Appotus Dominus was founded by 5 real life friends who have many extra 
        accounts. At its inception, there were 6 separate members. These members 
        were Ciliem, Dapper, Duridain, Whiteout, Yamile, and Dabamf. The foundation 
        of the guild is the RL core of Yamile, Ciliem, Dapper, Whiteout and Duridain. 
        Although, since Dabamf was there for pre-guild, we have a special love 
        for him. </p>
      <p>Let me give a rather lengthy dissertation that should clear up some questions 
        you may have. </p>
      <h2>General Information</h2>
      <p>This is information that I consider not 100% necessary to know, but it 
        explains things that happen sometimes. On the weekends, Dapper, Ciliem, 
        Yamile, and Whiteout all gather at Dapper's home to play EQ. We start 
        early and end late. This means a number of things to other guild members:</p>
      <p>Most times, we want to group together. We began playing EQ so that we 
        could all hang out together and group and do phat things. Obviously, we 
        need the help of everyone else to help us get to where we all want to 
        be. However, we also want to have fun. The most fun for us is honing our 
        skills and playing together every week. While admittedly sometimes this 
        arrangement leaves the odd members screwed, this is not by design. We 
        sincerely are hurt when our members get left out in the cold on groups. 
        We want to work up to where we can have two workable groups. However, 
        for now, we take the people who are (a) on and who are (b) going to coincide 
        most closely with what times we want to play. </p>
      <p>Sometimes, when you group with us on these days we may not be chatty, 
        or even unresponsive. This is kind of tough. We chat a lot amongst ourselves 
        and with battle spam and everything going on we sometimes miss things 
        that are said to us directly or indirectly. This is simply a consequence 
        of the circumstances. If this happens, PIPE UP AND SAY IT AGAIN. We are 
        not trying to ignore you, and don't want you to feel like you're being 
        ignored. We are not ripping on you, or laughing at you either. If we thought 
        you were stupid, a poor player, or generally lame you would not be in 
        the guild. So, don't take it personally, and be persistent please.</p>
      <p>Essentially, the guild is ruled by committee. This means that we have 
        loud arguments on a frequent basis. Dapper, Ciliem, Yamile, and Whiteout 
        will decide the course of what will happen. While this may seem like an 
        &quot;us&quot; and &quot;you&quot; scenario the way it is written it is 
        really no different than most successful guilds. In order for everyone 
        to get where they want to be, we need a power structure. As such, we do 
        want everyone to get phat lewts. The guild members are not simply pawns 
        in our own schemes, but important in game friends. We have interest in 
        getting loot for everyone. I sincerely hope that nobody feels at this 
        point like they are getting shanked on loot. </p>
      <h2>Long Term Goals</h2>
      <p>In the long term we want to kill big daddies and take their loot. While 
        member wise and level wise we are a little short, we can fix this. We 
        are not looking to recruit people who we find to be lame. </p>
      <h2>Qualities of lameness</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Poor Player</li>
        <li>Undesirable Personality</li>
        <li>Greedy Loot Whore</li>
      </ol>
