      <h2>Chardok: Who Knew?</h2>
      <p> This weekend we decided after we had camped the Seb Crypt and some ridiculous 
        monk drop in Karnor's that we wanted to do something a little bit out 
        of the ordinary: have a dungeon crawl. We decided that we were going to 
        attempt to penetrate as deep into Chardok as our mediocre levels would 
        carry us. This week the, uhh, winning team was:</p>
      <p>Simna 51 Warrior<br>
        Ciliem 52 Enchanter<br>
        Dapper 53 Druid<br>
        Keepson 51 Monk<br>
        Whiteout 52 Shaman<br>
        Yamile 49 Cleric</p>
      <p> Discovering (the hard way most times) that Chardok repops at an insane 
        rate we were able to run in quite deep. There were many strange (mostly 
        caster, yay!) drops that were upgrades for many of our ranks as well as 
        some cool weapons. Killing the mobs proved decent experience, and it was 
        exciting to slip into the perilous depths of Chardok. Well, it was exciting 
        and fun until we all got run down.</p>
      <p> You see, we found this rather big daddy, and decided to camp him for 
        a shoulder piece that we picked up. We sat in this breast shaped enclave 
        and awaited our lewts. Well, as it turns out, Chardok pops extremely fast 
        and there were wanderers. So, while I was messing with my insipid strength 
        staff, many mobs came onto the scene at a quick rate following Keepson. 
        Dapper and I were able to escape but Yamile was left behind to: MELEE 
        THE MOBS!</p>
      <p> Yam put up a grand fight and scored the &quot;money shot&quot; on the 
        named mob. She quickly looted the item and proceeded to get ripped to 
        shreds. A lengthy necro telling session ensued and finally we got our 
        corpses. In addition to this, &quot;Gotzcoffens&quot; was born: a level 
        1 DE warrior who gotz our coffins. We got some loot, got run down, and 
        generally had fun. While we would have loved to get more loot and get 
        run down one less time, it was still quite a fun time.</p>

      <p>It's true. This weekend we did an all out rape job on the Tower of Frozen 
        Shadow. With unforeseen circumstances breaking up our Disco camp and leaving 
        us with a lack of tanks, we decided to go to ToFS and simply rape it. 
        Because some of us had never been there before, and it was a cool zone, 
        we ported to Iceclad and entered the monstrosity.</p>
      <p>We entered the early floors and killed many, many mobs. We grabbed the 
        mobs, applied cleaner, and wiped the floor with floors 1-5. All 6 of us 
        took off in different directions and proceeded to kill as many mobs as 
        possible. Even I (Ciliem) was able to get involved in the slaughter, with 
        limited success.</p>
      <p>The first notable event of the evening, was that we got a Student's Homework. 
        While not blockbuster fantabulous, this piece is pretty nice and allowed 
        us to throw more plat into the guild coffers. I wish we could tell you 
        what it dropped from, but I don't remember. </p>
      <p>Next, Whiteout was unfortunate enough to get run down by some angry cooks. 
        The healers searched for the unfortunate shaman to no avail. Needless 
        to say, the laughing was racous and Whiteout became enraged at the pleasure 
        we all took in his demise. </p>
      <p>As we advanced up the tower, we reached a key holder holding a bowl. 
        After kicking this key holder and taking her candy we found this bowl 
        to be one of sorcerous nature. I (Ciliem) took the bowl immediately and 
        put it in my hands. For the rest of the evening, I also hit mobs with 
        the bowl doing 1 damage on more than 1 occasion. I also raised my 1hb 
        skill to 1. </p>
      <p>Finally, we made it to a strange room wherein an efreeti spawned. Throwing 
        caution to the wind we charmed this efreeti, shrunk it, and took pictures 
        of us with it (see above). The efreeti is simply adorable, however his 
        drops are absolute shit.</p>
      <p>After a short attempt to find Tserrina, we finally ported out. However, 
        some decent experience did come at the top of the tower where the torches 
        and the bats spawn. While the tower doesn't have top quality loot or experience 
        really it was fun to go there for a change of pace. </p>
      <p>The winning team for this event was:</p>
      <p>Ciliem 52 Enchanter<br>
        Dapper 52 Druid<br>
        Dabamf 52 Monk<br>
        Keepson 52 Monk<br>
        Yamile 47 Cleric<br>
        Whiteout 52 Shaman<br>

      <p>Well, this isn't actually true, but we certainly could have in the amount 
        of time it took these bumblers to put together a Nagafen raid. I (Ciliem) 
        got a tell on Friday night as we were about to head into Sebilis asking 
        if I wanted to attend a Nagafen raid, which I accepted. I brought my friends 
        along and we proceeded to..wait. Next, we waited. After this, we waited...Finally, 
        we penetrated into Sol B. The fire giants were cleared and we made it 
        to the prep room. Next, the buffing fiasco began. A third rate buff circle 
        began and groups spent well over an hour wandering around in a confused 
        fashion. Next we logged out, put a haphazard strategy together and logged 
        back in. </p>
      <p>After quite a lengthy prepping session in which many peoples' buffs began 
        to fade, we charged Nagafen. We won by sheer numbers. Nagafen was destroyed 
        and we rejoiced (more because we wanted to go to bed than anything else). 
      </p>
      <p>After loads of drama with a ninja looted Flame Cloak we finally were 
        snug in our beds after losing many rolls. We posed for a picture under 
        Nagafen's head and bounced (see Left). This raid was poorly run because 
        of a lack of people being quiet and a lack of the leader taking charge. 
        Should Appotus Dominus ever organize anything like this people will be 
        forced to STFU and the leader will be in constant communication with the 
        masses. </p>
