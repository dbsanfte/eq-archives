      <h2>Rules of Conduct</h2>

      <ol>

        <li>Everyone should be treated with respect regardless of affiliation. 

        <li>When grouping or on a guild raid, do not engage in trading petty insults 

          with other players over /OOC or /SHOUT. Obviously friendly teasing is 

          permitted but should be limited. 

        <li>Do not use guildchat for petty arguments or disagreements. Use tells. 

        <li>When grouping or on raids, make sure you understand and abide by the 

          looting rules. If you don't know, ask. Please see the <a href="#loot">Loot 

          Code below</a> for further guild root rules. 

        <li>Training others is not allowed. This includes training to get revenge 

          on someone. This obviously sometimes happens by mistake, but if it is 

          found that it was intentional, the issue will be looked into. 

        <li>Members are dedicated to play that puts Appotus Dominus - Drunken 

          Masters in the best possible light. That means avoiding arguments in 

          the shout and out of character channels with other players and guild. 

          If you have a disagreement with another person, please take it to tells 

          and try to work out an amiable solution between the two of you. If need 

          be, please contact an officer and discuss the situation. 

        <li>Intentional looting out of turn, ninja looting, disband/loot/log, 

          and Kill Stealing are strictly prohibited and can result in de-guilding. 

      </ol>

      <h2>Continuing Membership Requirements</h2>

      <ol>

        <li>Must have your Old-Seblis key and actively working on both your Charasis 

          and Veeshan&#146;s Peak keys. </li>

        <li>Own an enduring breath device (such as a Fishbone Earring).</li>

        <li>Be actively working on your Epic. </li>

        <li>Achieve an unbuffed 100 magic resistance in addition to 100 in either 

          fire resistance, cold resistance or poison resistance.</li>

        <li>Fully understand to the various guild policies such as raid, loot, 

          and membership.</li>

        <li>Keep your Magelo (<a href="http://www.magelo.com">www.magelo.com</a>) 

          profile updated on a regular basis.</li>

      </ol>

      <h2></h2>

      <h2>Alternate/Secondary Characters</h2>

      <p>It is understandable that members, especially at a high level, need/want 

        to play secondary characters. This provides a number of benefits, including 

        diversity, reducing stress, and any other number of good reasons. That 

        being said, we don&#146;t want a guild full of &#147;Twinks&#148;, nor 

        do we want people playing their alternate characters and not leveling 

        their primary characters. </p>

      <h2>Leaving / Discharge Policy</h2>

      <p>Managing to get kicked out of Appotus Dominus is fairly hard, but it 

        is doable. Only the guild leader will remove people under advisement from 

        the officers. The process goes.</p>

      <p>&#149; Warning<br>

        &#149; On probation 1-4 weeks.<br>

        &#149; Bye Bye.</p>

      <p>NOTE: De-Guilding as a form of protest over some issue is NOT an acceptable 

        form of protest. Any member may leave the guild at any time for any reason, 

        if they want to do so. Please give guild officers prior notice before 

        leaving. If you leave the guild only under extreme circumstances will 

        you be let back in. Please make sure to think long and hard before making 

        this important decision. </p>

      <h2><a name="loot"></a>The Loot Rules</h2>

      <p><b>Single Group</b></p>

      <ol>

        <li>All plat is split at the end</li>

        <li>All items that are usable CAN BE CHOSEN IMMEDIATELY by classes that 

          can use them. However, this will lose you a first round roll on the 

          rest of the loot. </li>

        <li>At the end of the night all items that have not been chosen as upgrades 

          for the classes that can use them will be rolled on. If you have chosen 

          an item that is an upgrade, you cannot participate in these rolls. (IE 

          - you are shaman in crypt, jaundiced drops - you choose it. This prevents 

          you from rolling on the remaining loot). 

          <ol>

            <li>All of the loot is listed</li>

            <li>All people who have not yet gotten an item (IE who have not chosen 

              to take an item that they can use as an upgrade) get to roll 0 100.</li>

            <li>The highest roll will choose an item, then next, and so on. </li>

            <li>If there is an insane amount of loot, this extends to a second 

              round where everyone (even if they have gotten a piece already) 

              rolls and the process is repeated until there are no pieces left 

              for choosing. </li>

          </ol>

        </li>

      </ol>

      <p>Note: This is for single group all guild only. Clearly, we can't dictate 

        how loot is distributed in pickup groups. Also, if you don't want to do 

        this guild members can do what they like. This is simply a guideline to 

        help us determine a code so that we don't have to discuss it all the time.</p>

      <h2><a name="raid"></a>Points System</h2>

     <p>The question of ubber loots comes up in every guild. We are getting to the point in which we will be raiding and getting awesome items. In the past we have distributed items we get in a free flowing and easy manner. This is not a long term solution, therefore this code was implemented. Rather than a simple dictator system, in which unpleasantries would inevitably ensue, we elected to create a &quot;points&quot; system based largely on the experiences of Whiteout and Dapper. Without further ado, the point system will work like this:</p><p>How do I get points? </p><p>Points are awarded for attending &quot;raid type&quot; events. These events REQUIRE MORE THAN 1 GROUP TO DO, otherwise the single group loot code applies. Only Dapper, Dabamf, or Yamile have the power to award points. The points are divided as follows:</p><p><strong>A Small Raid Type Event is worth 3 points. (Normally Weekday Raids)</strong><br>These are smaller events that take a minimal amount of time, but take a few groups to do. Killing some smaller dragons, easy to get to big daddies etc etc. There are special situations which can affect how many points you receive: </p><ul><li>(-1) You get negative 1 points for being late to these events</li><li>(-1) You leave early, negative 1 point. Since most of these events are fairly straightforward you are either there long enough to help or you're not. </li></ul><p><strong>Friday night raids are worth 5 points. <br></strong>These are real and full. Here are the standard adjustments:</p><ul><li>(-2) You are late to the event. You arrive early enough where you can be of service, but we have already done a lot without you. *if you are really late expect to lose more than 2 points, this will be done at the digression of the points assigner. </li><li>(-2) You leave early from the event. In some of these events the need to leave early is inevitable. While we realize this is not your fault sometimes, you must be penalized so the &quot;hard core&quot; does not feel sleighed. *if you are dipping really early expect to lose more than 2 points, this will be done at the digression of the points assigner. </li><li>(+.5) You are level 55 or greater. If you have busted your ass to get to 55+ we give you a bonus because we want the guild to be high levels. </li><li>(+1) You get a full point bonus for being a level 60. Again, we want the prestige and being 60 makes everything as easy as it can be. <br>Note: the bonuses do not apply to guests of the raids. We do not care about the prestige of nonguilded people or care to reward them for it. The bonus for levels is to promote leveling within Appotus Dominus. </li><li>(+1) You weren't at the raid but people used your character for one purpose or another. </li></ul><p><strong>A Saturday raid event is worth 7 points.<br></strong>These are lengthy type raids that are long term commitment events. They take a lot of time so you get more points. Some Saturday raids may occasionally be cut short or shortened due to unforeseen circumstances. This doesn't change their point value. It is a general trend and the point system is intended to reflect the majority and not each situation. We are not getting into a situation where raids are pointed by the hour or any of that bullshit. It is EQ, it is not 5th hour Physics class, we are not taking role. Again, before we embark the size of the event will be determined. Here are the adjustments:</p><ul><li>(-2) You are late to the event. You arrive early enough where you can be of service, but we have already done a lot without you. *if you're really late expect to lose more than 2 points.</li><li>(-2) You leave early from the event. In some of these events the need to leave early is inevitable. While we realize this is not your fault sometimes, you must be penalized so the &quot;hard core&quot; does not feel sleighed. *if you are dipping really early expect to lose more than 2 points. </li><li>(+.5) You are level 55 or greater. If you have busted your ass to get to 55+ we give you a bonus because we want the guild to be high levels. </li><li>(+1) You get a full point bonus for being a level 60. Again, we want the prestige and being 60 makes everything as easy as it can be. <br>Note: the bonuses do not apply to guests of the raids. We do not care about the prestige of nonguilded people or care to reward them for it. The bonus for levels is to promote leveling within Appotus Dominus. </li><li>(+1) You weren't at the raid but people used your character for one purpose or another. </li></ul><p>How do I use points to buy items?</p><p>When we are in a raid situation, items that are upgrades will drop. No Drop items will be bought and paid for on the spot, and other items will be collected for an end of raid auction. If you see an item you want, it MUST BE USABLE BY YOUR CLASS FOR YOU TO BID ON. There will be a starting bid assigned, and if you have the points, you bid on the item. If others in the same class want the item, they can overbid you. Starting bids will be determined based on relative desirability of the item. </p><p>A few rules apply: </p><ol><li>If you bid and win an item you may not bid on another one until people of your class have either passed on what else is there, or have purchased one themselves. This prevents longtime members from forcing new guild members to attend raids for months while they get nothing. The exception to this rule is that any item that is purchased for under 10 points will not count towards this rule. Items that start above or at 10 points will automatically count as a claim towards that days ability to claim loot. </li><li>No Drop Items are an oddity. If a No Drop item drops, and you want it but do not have the points for it YOU MAY GO INTO THE HOLE TO GET IT. This prevents people from having possible upgrades to them rot on the ground. IE you have 3 points, a tight item drops and you are the only one of your class there, its a 10 point item, you may go to minus 7. However, people who have points and want the item will be given priority. You may only go into the hole to prevent items from rotting. If you are in a bidding war with someone, you may not go above your total points simply to get the item. In bidding wars the maximum points you have is the maximum points you can bid. There is no negative to having minus points. </li><li> If items are not bid on by anyone they go into the guild vault for two weeks. During these two weeks ONLY A CLASS THAT CAN USE THE ITEM may purchase it at any time for a price that will be determined. If after two weeks, the item remains in the vault, it is opened to ANYONE WHO WANTS IT at a higher set price. The items in the guild vault will be published on a regular basis. Dapper controls the guild vault and any questions come to him regarding this. </li><li>Guild Fire sale -- if the vault is building up an annoying amount of items, we will clear it because its cumbersome and lame. The guild earned those items and they will be distributed back into the guild for whatever people are willing to pay. If items do not sell in the fire sale we will sell them ourselves and take the plat and deposit it into the newly created &quot;Guild Fund&quot; in order to buy peridots and the like. Items will go down as low as 1 point so the junk that does not sell is really absolute junk. </li><li>How many points each guild member has will be posted on a regular basis. If you have a question or a mistake was made in your points, please post a reply to the message that lists the points in it so it can get it fixed immediately. </li><li>The /ran clause -- If we get what we determine is a stupid amount of an item that is not overly desirable in the guild vault we will just /ran for it because we don&#8217;t want our bank crowded with the items. These items are completely up to our discretion and will probably never be very good. If we end up with 12 silk robes we will find a way to loot the 13th and vault it. Although, this should never feasibly happen. Examples of this shit are leather gloves, silk bracers and silk pants from ToV. </li><li>The junk clause -- Sometimes items drop on a raid that nobody cares about. These items will be absorbed by the guild fund unless someone wants them. They will not be formerly announced or go through any points system because its clear that they are really poor to average items that would not be worth spending your points on. We will do our best to make sure they are announced, but they may not always be. If you want these items, it is first come first served and may many times end up going to the looter just because people forget. </li><li>The Whiner Clause -- do not whine about the loot code or try to point to places where it has failed. It has failed in places and it will continue to fail in places. It is the best we can come up with, and generally, it works well. It has problems, but not as many problems as Dapper handing out loot as he sees fit. If you have a legit concern, please bring it up, but always ask yourself before you do 'is this really serious, is there a feasible way to fix it, has it previously been considered, in essence, is this really a concern or am I just whining for the sake of whining?'. </li><li>The points cost of certain items may change over a period of time with changes with in the guild. Something that dropped 3 months ago does not have the same value to most people as it did during that time. For this reason, the price of items will change as the guilds access to certain loots progresses. An attempt to keep the point differential to a minimum will be exercised. </li><li>Guests of raids will bank points that can only be used when they become full members of the guild. The only items non-members get must be awarded specifically to them by the officers. </li><li>Guest Points: While you are an applicant to the guild points are tallied for you and are saved in case you get in. If you should get into the guild these will be added to your totals. If for whatever reason you enter the guild and leave, or cease to be an applicant these points will be voided. If you are an applicant again, you will have to start from 0 points. </li><li>What order is the loot auctioned in? When a big daddy mob is killed we will completely list all of the loot and stats for everyone. Then we will start bidding on the items in what seems like best to worst order. This is so people are not wondering what the mob has and if they should or should not bid on a current item. </li></ol><p>Are raids free? </p><p>Yup. </p><p> Does everyone have to use the loot system?</p>
<p> Yes, the points system applies to EVERYONE IN THE GUILD. Dapper will have 
to accumulate points as anyone else will have to. Points and items will be published 
on a regular basis. We don't play favorites, if you come to more raids, you get 
more points. <br>
</p></body>

</p>

      <h2>Final Note</h2>

      
<p>In order to prevent repetition of the mistakes of the past/other guild, these 
policies will be adhered to, however is still at the discretion of the officers 
and guild leader. Guilds are meant to last forever, players come and go, if it 
takes that little bit extra time to ensure we have the right people, then so be 
it. We understand we run the risk of loosing potential good players to other guild 
because they don't want to wait, however we are not here to cater for everyone, 
but to build up a good, solid guild of loyal, trustworthy friends.</p>
