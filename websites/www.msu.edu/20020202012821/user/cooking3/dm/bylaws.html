      <h2>Rules of Conduct</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Everyone should be treated with respect regardless of affiliation. 
        <li>When grouping or on a guild raid, do not engage in trading petty insults 
          with other players over /OOC or /SHOUT. Obviously friendly teasing is 
          permitted but should be limited. 
        <li>Do not use guildchat for petty arguments or disagreements. Use tells. 
        <li>When grouping or on raids, make sure you understand and abide by the 
          looting rules. If you don't know, ask. Please see the <a href="#loot">Loot 
          Code below</a> for further guild root rules. 
        <li>Training others is not allowed. This includes training to get revenge 
          on someone. This obviously sometimes happens by mistake, but if it is 
          found that it was intentional, the issue will be looked into. 
        <li>Members are dedicated to play that puts Appotus Dominus - Drunken 
          Masters in the best possible light. That means avoiding arguments in 
          the shout and out of character channels with other players and guild. 
          If you have a disagreement with another person, please take it to tells 
          and try to work out an amiable solution between the two of you. If need 
          be, please contact an officer and discuss the situation. 
        <li>Intentional looting out of turn, ninja looting, disband/loot/log, 
          and Kill Stealing are strictly prohibited and can result in de-guilding. 
      </ol>
      <h2>Continuing Membership Requirements</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Must have your Old-Seblis key and actively working on both your Charasis 
          and Veeshan&#146;s Peak keys. </li>
        <li>Own an enduring breath device (such as a Fishbone Earring).</li>
        <li>Be actively working on your Epic. </li>
        <li>Achieve an unbuffed 100 magic resistance in addition to 100 in either 
          fire resistance, cold resistance or poison resistance.</li>
        <li>Fully understand to the various guild policies such as raid, loot, 
          and membership.</li>
        <li>Keep your Magelo (<a href="http://www.magelo.com">www.magelo.com</a>) 
          profile updated on a regular basis.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2></h2>
      <h2>Alternate/Secondary Characters</h2>
      <p>It is understandable that members, especially at a high level, need/want 
        to play secondary characters. This provides a number of benefits, including 
        diversity, reducing stress, and any other number of good reasons. That 
        being said, we don&#146;t want a guild full of &#147;Twinks&#148;, nor 
        do we want people playing their alternate characters and not leveling 
        their primary characters. </p>
      <h2>Leaving / Discharge Policy</h2>
      <p>Managing to get kicked out of Appotus Dominus is fairly hard, but it 
        is doable. Only the guild leader will remove people under advisement from 
        the officers. The process goes.</p>
      <p>&#149; Warning<br>
        &#149; On probation 1-4 weeks.<br>
        &#149; Bye Bye.</p>
      <p>NOTE: De-Guilding as a form of protest over some issue is NOT an acceptable 
        form of protest. Any member may leave the guild at any time for any reason, 
        if they want to do so. Please give guild officers prior notice before 
        leaving. If you leave the guild only under extreme circumstances will 
        you be let back in. Please make sure to think long and hard before making 
        this important decision. </p>
      <h2><a name="loot"></a>The Loot Rules</h2>
      <p><b>Single Group</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>All plat is split at the end</li>
        <li>All items that are usable CAN BE CHOSEN IMMEDIATELY by classes that 
          can use them. However, this will lose you a first round roll on the 
          rest of the loot. </li>
        <li>At the end of the night all items that have not been chosen as upgrades 
          for the classes that can use them will be rolled on. If you have chosen 
          an item that is an upgrade, you cannot participate in these rolls. (IE 
          - you are shaman in crypt, jaundiced drops - you choose it. This prevents 
          you from rolling on the remaining loot). 
          <ol>
            <li>All of the loot is listed</li>
            <li>All people who have not yet gotten an item (IE who have not chosen 
              to take an item that they can use as an upgrade) get to roll 0 100.</li>
            <li>The highest roll will choose an item, then next, and so on. </li>
            <li>If there is an insane amount of loot, this extends to a second 
              round where everyone (even if they have gotten a piece already) 
              rolls and the process is repeated until there are no pieces left 
              for choosing. </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Note: This is for single group all guild only. Clearly, we can't dictate 
        how loot is distributed in pickup groups. Also, if you don't want to do 
        this guild members can do what they like. This is simply a guideline to 
        help us determine a code so that we don't have to discuss it all the time.</p>
      <h2><a name="raid"></a>Points System</h2>
      <p>This is the Uber loot code, this portion is not optional </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">H</font>ow do I 
        get points? </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">P</font>oints are 
        awarded for attending &quot;raid type&quot; events. These events REQUIRE 
        MORE THAN 1 GROUP TO DO, otherwise the single group loot code applies. 
        Only Dapper, or I (Ciliem) have the power to award points. Unless specified 
        in advance, there will be no points awarded for small enocunters, such 
        as epic ones. The points are divided as follows:</p>
      <p>A Small Raid Type Event is worth 3 points. </p>
      <p>These are smaller events that take a minimal amount of time, but take 
        a few groups to do. Killing some smaller dragons, easy to get to big daddies 
        etc etc. There are special situations which can affect how many points 
        you receive: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>(-3) You get no points for being late to these events. If we are doing 
          something and you make it late, after all of the action is over, or 
          are no help to us because you are late you will receive no points, bottom 
          line. </li>
        <li>(-3) You leave early, you get no points. Since most of these events 
          are fairly straightforward you are either here or you're not. </li>
        <li>(+.5) You are level 55 or greater. If you have busted your ass to 
          get to 55+ we give you a bonus because we want the guild to be high 
          levels. </li>
        <li>(+1) You get a full point bonus for being a level 60. Again, we want 
          the prestige and being 60 makes everything as easy as it can be. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>A large raid event is worth 7 points. </p>
      <p>These are raids of the planes and are long term commitment events. They 
        take a lot of time so you get more points. Again, before we embark the 
        size of the event will be determined. Here are the adjustments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>(-2) You are late to the event. You arrive early enough where you 
          can be of service, but we have already done a lot without you. </li>
        <li>(-2) You leave early from the event. In some of these events the need 
          to leave early is inevitable. While we realize this is not your fault 
          sometimes, you must be penalized so the &quot;hard core&quot; don't 
          get sleighed.</li>
        <li>(+.5) You are level 55 or greater. If you have busted your ass to 
          get to 55+ we give you a bonus because we want the guild to be high 
          levels. </li>
        <li>(+1) You get a full point bonus for being a level 60. Again, we want 
          the prestige and being 60 makes everything as easy as it can be. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">H</font>ow do I 
        use points to buy items? </p>
      <p><font size="+3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">W</font>hen we are 
        in a raid situation, items that are Uber will drop. No Drop items will 
        be bought and paid for on the spot, and other items will be collected 
        for an end of raid auction. If you see an item you want, it <b>must be 
        usable by your class for you to bid on</b>. There will be a starting bid 
        assigned, and if you have the points, you bid on the item. If others in 
        the same class want the item, they can overbid you. Starting bids will 
        be determined based on relative desirability of the item. </p>
      <p>A few rules apply: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you bid and win an item you may not bid on another one until people 
          of your class have either passed on what else is there, or have purchased 
          one themselves. This prevents longtime members from forcing new guild 
          members to attend raids for months while they get nothing. </li>
        <li>No Drop Items are an oddity. If a No Drop item drops, and you want 
          it but do not have the points for it YOU MAY GO INTO THE HOLE TO GET 
          IT. This prevents people from having possible upgrades to them rot on 
          the ground. IE you have 3 points, a tight item drops and you are the 
          only one of your class there, its a 10 point item, you may go to minus 
          7. However, people who have points and want the item will be given priority. 
          Obviously, when you have minus points you can;t bid on regular items 
          because you have no points. There is no further negative to having minus 
          points. </li>
        <li>If items are not bid on by anyone they go into the guild vault for 
          two weeks. During these two weeks ONLY A CLASS THAT CAN USE THE ITEM 
          may purchase it at any time for a price that will be determined. If 
          after two weeks, the item remains in the vault, it is opened to ANYONE 
          WHO WANTS IT at the set price. The items in the guild vault will be 
          published on a regular basis. Ciliem (me) controls the guild vault and 
          any questions come to me regarding this. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>How many points each guild member has will be posted on a regular basis. 
        If you have a question or a mistake was made in your points, please post 
        a reply to the message that lists the points in it so I can get it fixed 
        immediately. </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">A</font>re there 
        raids fees? </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">N</font>o</p>
      <p><font size="+3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">D</font>o I have 
        to use the points system as well?</p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">Y</font>es, the 
        points system applies to EVERYONE IN THE GUILD. Dapper will have to accumulate 
        points as anyone else will have to. Points and items will be published 
        on a regular basis. We don't play favorites, if you come to hella raids, 
        you get hella points. </p>
      <h2>Final Note</h2>
      <p>In order to prevent repetition of the mistakes of the past/other guild, 
        these policies will be adhered to, however is still at the discretion 
        of the officers and guild leader. Guilds are meant to last forever, players 
        come and go, if it takes that little bit extra time to ensure we have 
        the right people, then so be it. We understand we run the risk of loosing 
        potential good players to other guild because they don't want to wait, 
        however we are not here to cater for everyone, but to build up a good, 
        solid guild of loyal, trustworthy friends.</p>
