      <h2>V. Diddy</h2>

      <p>After posting somewhat regularly and pleasing my adoring fans, I sort 

        of fell off the past couple of weeks. The reason for this istwo-fold. 

        One, how many times do people really want to read about Trakanon, Wuoshi, 

        and Dracoliche? Perhaps I have breathed life into these mundane kills 

        one time too many, gotten excited about one too many cobalt bp, or had 

        one too many disappointments with the Dracoliche's drops. Nonethless, 

        I became complacent and failed to document some kills. For this, I am 

        sorry. Doubltess many of you have been checking the site religiously to 

        see which fantabulous drops we got off Wuoshi. The second reason (lest 

        you forget <i>two-fold</i>), is because I am a lazy son of a bitch. I'll 

        leave it up to you to decide which of these compelling arguements has 

        more bearing on why the site has gone to the dogs (once again). </p>

      <p>Anyway, the point of this sexy update was not for me to wax philosophical 

        about the lack of recent updates! It was to announce that we ventured 

        into Akheva ruins to kill some buoulder looking fellow: The Va'Dyn. You 

        know the mob has to be a badass when he has &quot;The&quot; in front of 

        it. Anyway, he has about 365904957398560743680 HP, and as you can see 

        we got an add or three. Luckily the smaller rocky fellows only have around 

        9034759359205 HP, so they fell comparatively quickly. </p>

      <h2>Another Day, Another Draco</h2>

      <p>Since we love going to Plane of Fear till all hours of the night, we 

        decided to head in and see if Draco was prancing about. Luckily for us, 

        he was prancing about. We pulled him to camp, and as has happened many 

        times in the past and hopefully many more times we killed the large Dracoliche. 

        I didn't take a new screenshot and I never plan to. However, I will recycle 

        this old one because I like to cut and paste. Thanks Draco for robe and 

        hybrid shield. </p>

      <p>Oh, wait this isn't the creation of the nefarious Dr. Wily from the classic 

        Megaman series for the NES, it's thinly veiled plaguarism by VI. Nonethless 

        we killed it in embarassingly easy fashion which brings up another classic

      <h2>In Unrelated News...</h2>

      <p>Don't you feel for the low end celebrities on MTV cribs? They're showing 

        their house like it's something special and you're thinking, yes my friend 

        in high school had a pool table too, so what? They always have one bangin 

        house on Cribs then the two afterwards have to follow up with their houses 

        that were either built in 1988 (the last time they sold a record) or leaving 

        you with the only one logical conclusion: &quot;Dude, you're just not 

        that rich, are you?&quot; I will leave the low end celebrities who were 

        victimized today on cribs nameless. But suffice it to say I know people 

        with a big screen TV and a refrigerator full of beer in their basement. 

        In the words of Shania Twain, &quot;that don't impress me much&quot;. 

      </p>

      <p>Granted, getting to level 60 in Everquest probably don't impress them 

        much either, but I don't have a God damn show called Ciliem's AA where 

        I talk about the next AA ability I'm going to get (Gather Mana, for anyone 

        interested). As a disclaimer to any of my low end celebrity friends, please 

        do not let this quip discourage you from inviting me to your crib...as

        this mob with ~23 people and it was enjoyable. A mob that looks like this 

        does not deserve the respect of anyone. To see this raggedy fool stagger 

        and warp through the choppy UP landscape is truly a sight to behold. A 

        for effort on trying to make a unique looking mob, E for the preposterous 

        gayness that resulted from those well meaning creative juices. </p>
