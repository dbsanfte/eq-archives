      <p>Quick warning, gonna try some new stuff with links and such in this update. 
        So, cut me some slack while I figure out what will work best. Back to 
        the regularly scheduled update:</p>
<h2>Honey I'm Hoooooome!</h2>
      <p><img src="valor.jpg" width="194" height="18"></p>
      <p>Finally, Shylah has returned home. I just hope Mithaniel has the tea ready, 
        he and I need to have a nice long talk.</p>
<h2>Now the Good Stuff</h2>
      <p>I'm gonna go a little outta order today, just because AD has accomplished 
        another first for ourselves. I sat like a fool since 9am waiting for King 
        Tormax to show up to hand in a head. Well, 12 hours later he decided I 
        had been laughed at long enough and was kind enough to trade an icky dead 
        head for <a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/zone.php3?tag=drakkal&item=3747"> 
        Gauntlets of Dragon Slaying</a> for Drekken and myself. After I thanked 
        him many times, we killed him. I mean the gaunts are nice, but a corpse 
        is even better!</p>

<h2>Rumble Incoming?</h2>
<p>After a slight, erm, mishap, we punked Rumblecrush and got us our first robe drop!</p>

<h2>Yaaaawwn</h2>
      <p>Well, it *is* called SLEEPER'S TOMB. Get it? /giggle Anywho! We had a 
        quick field trip to the tomb and took down the Master of the Guard and 
        The Progenitor. Grats Kinolen on <a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/zone.php3?tag=sleepers&item=10132"> 
        Ancient Prismatic Spear</a> and <a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/zone.php3?tag=sleepers&item=10141">Rime

        Prismatic Axe</a>.</p>

<p>Over all, we got treats for many and played a few tricks on others. Not to mention, we were able to keep
a few of our AD hoodlums inside and away from the innocent children on the street. Happy Halloween!</p>

<h2>TKO</h2>
      <p>Jorlleag was the final match of the evening. Grats AD on a TKO of suck loots. 
        I think Toppy wins the prize for the most non suck loot of the night.</p>      <p><img src="jorloot.jpg" width="213" height="109"></p>
<p><i>The Loots: Helm of the Crawler (Battas), Crown of Resilience (Plain)</i></p>
      <p>All in all another good weekend for the AD crew. Started out strong with some 
        great drops, ended kinda weak. I blame Dapper, just because I can.</p>

<h2>Sleepaz</h2>
<p>Today we took a quick trip over to ST to get some more primal/prismatic (call it
what you will!) in our hands. So big grats out to our newly equipped members that will
be screaming with the power of Avatar at a zone near you: Fobas(spear), Tybrus(spear), 
Vashen(claidmore), Sonicbeat(stilleto), Scubasteve(the 1hs one) and Shylah(axe). That 
brings our count up to 10! Hell, now we can finally kill Aar.. nm!</p>
<h2>ZERG 101</h2>
      <p>For this course we receive a big, fat F! After a slight mishap during 
        our second match against the Lord of the dragons, some complications arose 
        and we found that Zerg(tm) does not pay. Kids, don't do Zerg(tm)! We recouped 
        and decided that our strategy and tactics would be better to use. Flawlessly, 
        we were correct.</p>
      <p><img src="yeliloot1.jpg" width="232" height="184"></p>
<p><i>The Loots: Head (Shylah), Craslith (grats rot!), Soul Defiler (Krannuk), 
Celestial Essence Robe (x2) (Anjuskahn and Maige), Sleepaz Key (Gonuso)</i></p>
<h2>Farming is Fun!</h2>
      <p>Since NToV was calling our name we headed over to lay a bunch of the inhabitants 
        to rest. First up was Eashen. You know, right now I'm drawing a blank 
        since my mind is on other things. I just wanna give Mithaniel Marr a damn 
        hug, but I can't. So you think up of something funny, insert it here and 
        laugh about it. Thanks for saving me the trouble.</p>

<h2>Aaryonar...</h2> 
      <p>uhm yeah. Grats Fobas on Reaper's Ring and Bates on Circlet of Summer 
        and Rocksmasher /wink Moving on!</p>
<h2>Lord Feshlak</h2>
      <p>He's cake. That is all. Please refer to Eashen.</p>

<p><i>The Loots: Amulet (Topster), Vambraces (Plain), Boots (Whiteout)</i></p>
<h2>Dagarn the Destroyer</h2>
      <p>You know, I think next time we return to NToV, I'm gonna take some pretty 
        pictures of the dragons we kill. Loot is cool to see, but some of these 
        dragons and wurms are kinda neat. Feshlak = pretty dragon imo. Dagarn 
        = gimp wurm graphic. Both are dead yay!</p>

<p>A great second day in our raiding weekend. We'll see what Sunday has in store.</p>

<p>Trying to figure out what date to put on top is rather tricky. Do I put the 
date that we killed stuff? OR Do I put the date that I update? Someone answer that 
for me!</p>
<h2>Woah where'd you come from?</h2>
<p>That's the question of the day in regards to our trip over to Zlandicar. As we all
sat complaining to the rogues to disarm the traps Zlandicar popped up on us. Senniia said 
it was a goof, but I know she was laughing and was probably bummed when we wrecked him up
for jumping us early.</p>
      <p><img src="zlandloot.jpg" width="244" height="194"></p>
<p><i>The Loots: Zland Heart (Anjuskahn), Cracked Claw of Zlandicar (Lalienaya), Frakadar's
Talisman (Senniia), Massive Dragon Claw Shard (Grats Bank!), Sleepaz Key (Dianna)</i></p>
<p><i>Vaniki: Willsapper (Simna)</i></p>
<h2>When you wish upon a star..</h2>
<p>Many wizards dream of the day that they have their bane spells. Specifically, dragonbane.
Myga is unforgiving and ruthless and very very sneaky, she eludes the best of them. But not today!
As we left DN, we found her roaming the wastes and put her to sleep nicely. Here we see Anjuskahn
with the dead dragon.</p>
      <p><a href="mygacorpse.jpg"><img src="mygacorpse.jpg" width="382" height="224" border="0"></a></p>
<h2>Last Call</h2>
<p>Klandicar was also in his usual position today. I guess the bar finally kicked him out. With a nose
that red, he's drank one too many in my opinion.</p>
      <p><img src="klandloot.jpg" width="269" height="153"></p>
<p><i>The Loots: Peerless BP (Plain), Worked Gaunts (Bank), Reinforced Boots (Bank), Sleepaz Key (Conx)</i></p>
<h2>ToV Lovin'</h2>
      <p>First, was a quick stop at Lendiniara the Keeper and got our 3rd Sleepaz 
        Key of the night!</p>
      <p><img src="lendloot.jpg" width="228" height="150"></p>
<p><i>The Loots: Breastplate (Lalienaya), Girdle (Cerrelia), Gloves (Cydian), Sleepaz Key (Nife)</i></p>
<p>Then we ran over to Ikatar the Venom. "Where did you come from?" reoccured, but it didn't slow us
down one bit.</p>
      <p><img src="ikyloot.jpg" width="260" height="154"></p>
<p><i>The Loots: Ancient Wyvern Tunic(Purfection), Ancient Wyvern Greaves (Senniia), 
Cloak of the Venom (Krannuk)</i></p>
      <p>By now, it's getting late, the numbers are dwindling. Eashen was too 
        scared to show his face, so we flew down to Telk and picked on him for 
        another trip down memory lane.</p>
      <p><img src="telkloot.jpg" width="217" height="151"></p>
<p><i>The Loots: Circlet of Suffering (Conx), Transparent Eyepatch (Dianna), Mithril BP (Thorryn)</i></p>

<p>I just want to take a moment and let everyone know the great job Senniia did last night for us. I mocked
some things here, but really, she was our only puller and put on the spot. We usually have 3-4 working for us.
So great job Senniia and don't kick my ass!</p>

<h2>Wow, the updates are really on time!</h2>
<p>Why yes, yes they are. It's just too bad that I'm tired today, so expect
a "plain jane" report of the AD Crew's happenings last night.</p>
<h2>Sssssso Many Ssssssnakes...</h2>
<p>So little time. We hit up Ssra Temple today to find Rhag Zhezum waiting for
our arrival. He even made tea and crumpets for Vashen to make him feel at home.</p>
      <p><a href="rhag1loot.jpg"><img src="rhag1loot.jpg" width="239" height="225" border="0"></a></p>
<p><i>The Loots: Earring of Resistance (Mindark), Bone Golem Vambraces (Yamile), 
Mana Twined Staff (Nimrae)</i></p>
<p>Of course, once Zhezum was put to rest, Mozdezh came out to play. Unfortunately,
he had no time to prepare any treats for us.</p>
      <p><a href="rhag2loot.jpg"><img src="rhag2loot.jpg" width="253" height="227" border="0"></a></p>
<p><i>The Loots: Rei's Battleworn Dirk (Shou) , Scale Mesh Leggings (Plain)</i></p>
<h2>Rumbleroni</h2>
<p>Cuz I couldn't think of anything wittier, Rumbleroni wins. Our trackers scouted
and found that RC was up and for the taking. So we scurried over to UP and sacrificed
Topster and Xainn for kicks.</p>
      <p><a href="rumbleloot.jpg"><img src="rumbleloot.jpg" width="188" height="160" border="0"></a></p>
<p><i>The Loots: Tunic of Kinship (Sonnas), Ring of the Ages (Cydian), Chooser's Cap (Whiteout)</i></p>
<h2>Omg, there's more?!</h2>
<p>Clearly three mobs are not enough to wet the palette on a Thursday night. A little birdie
told us that Lord Yelinak has returned to his throne. Well, okay so it was a gnome.. birdie.. gnome
is there really a difference?!</p>
<p>AD also took a little trip down memory lane and decided to portal bomb Wuoshi on our way to the daddy
of the dragons. Ahhh, just like old times.</p>
      <p><img src="wuoshicorpse.jpg" width="277" height="207"></p>
<p>He dropped stuff that no one wanted and will just go to buying us more coffins. So onward we travel to
Skyshrine. This was our first shot at Yelinak and needless to say we've added his name to our 
official "AD Bish List."</p>
      <p><img src="yelinak.jpg" width="375" height="230"></p>
<p>Isn't he cute?!</p>
      <p><a href="yelistrat.jpg"><img src="yelistrat.jpg" width="380" height="214" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Be sure you note my l33t hotkey and spell line ups. I'm positive it is the key to all of our 
success, along with me standing way too far from the target.</p>
      <p><img src="yelicorpse.jpg" width="444" height="214"></p>
<p>Like there was ever any doubt...</p>

Taming Whip (Zeban), Dragon's Eye Sage Ring (Topster), Sleepaz Key (Alueriniel)</i></p>
<p>Was a good night all in all.. but tomorrow is Friday. Be ready for some more action!</p>

<h2>A New Look for the AD Crew</h2>
<p>By now you can see a new layout up and running for our glorious
homepage. I do hope you enjoy it and I welcome you to look around
and get to know the place. However, with a change there are always
critics, and I welcome you all. Questions, comments, suggestion, bribes 
and death threats about this change can be sent to <a href="mailto:Yamile@appotusdominus.com">Yamile</a>.
hehe jk You can really send them to me at <a href="mailto:shylah@appotusdominus.com">Shylah</a>. Anyway,
on to the update!</p>
<p>Lendi holds the true power of the ONE RING. Much to our chagrin she dropped the Ring
of Crap again, but also gave us a nice pair of gloves and her talisman. I looted the 
tali in haste cuz I was excited, so it's not in the loot shot. sue me!</p>

<h2>Back on Track!</h2>

<p>After snooping around all the stuff necessary to maintain the page, I'm semi 

up and running. Please excuse the lack of screenshots, in the confusion and haste 

of getting the page up to date, many weren't sent in. So without further slacking, 

the weekend update:</p>

<p>Another lazy day for the AD crew. Took some time to get in last minute xp's 

before the PoP release, but still managed to take time to visit the good ol' Dain 

again. While preparing for the pull, Dabamf opened up to us:</p>

<p><img src="dabquote2.jpg" width="560" height="13"></p>

<p>Dain heard him of course and decided to be a little fiesty. Which in turn, 

Dab was ready to tear his eyes out, along with many others as well. Nonetheless, 

I made sure the Dain paid for the emotional stress he brought upon Dab.</p>

<p><img src="shydain.jpg" width="205" height="14"></p>

<p>And now for another loot shot that I did receive!</p>

<h2>Grieg.. weeee!</h2>

<p>After we had enough of freezing our butts in Icewell, we headed to warmer climates. 

Grieg was happy to see us as always, and just short of /suiciding and giving us 

loots, we killed with ease.</p>

<p><i>The Loots: Bonecurse (grats rot!), Belt of Virility (Kaytani)</i></p>

<p>Slow weekend as we anxiously await the release of Planes of Power and all the 

screw ups VI has to offer. Stay tuned as we get back in the swing of things and 

I remember to take loot shots!</p>

<p>We started the night with some giant action. Ran over to KD to find 



	  everyone's punching bag up and ready to be put down. Vindi died and gave



	  us a cougar claw earring... er, I mean an <i>Earring of Living Thunder



	  (Grats bank)</i></p>



	  <h2>Statue of Rallos Zek</h2>



	  <p>Of course we don't go to KD for just Vindi anymore... Statue was up and



	  greeted us with open arms.</p>

	  <h2>Lendi</h2>



	  <p>To close the night, we headed over to ToV to get another AD'er into ST. 



	  Again, no screenshot of loot: <i>Ring (grats rot!), Truesight Helm (Sorhab),



	  Sleepaz Key (Maige)</i></p>

<h2>On Time Updates?!</h2>
<p>Well, not yet but soon. Due to extra duties in the horrible world known as 
Real Life(tm), I'm gonna start taking over updates on this wonderful site. While 
I'll never be half as witty as Dapper, who was only half as witty as Ciliem, I'll 
do my best to screw up this page so that it's down for a few weeks. Then no one 
can complain about updates while I receive the software from Yamile. All part 
of my master evil plan. *insert evil laugh here*</p>

<h2>Death of dragons</h2>
<p>I would like to apologize for the lack of updates lately, work has been killing 
me and my overall Everquest time has been limited.</p>
<p>Again we got the oppurtunity to venture into NToV this Friday and punk some 
named dragons that drop uber phat loots.</p>
<p><img src="ikath6.jpg" width="245" height="110"></p>
<p><i>The Loots: Poison Soaked Tunic (Grats Rot!), Ancient Wyvern Hide Tunic (Vashen)</i></p>
<h2>Aaryonar</h2>
<p>Again the fight went flawlessly and Aaryonar was killed with less people than 
our first attempt a week ago. Grats again to everyone and the hard work and dedication 
it took kill these end game mobs.</p>
<p><img src="aary2.jpg" width="244" height="152"></p>

<h2>Vindi, Statue, and Lcea Katta</h2>
<p>Weekday madness continues! After knocking out both Vindi and the Statue, we 
took on Lcea Katta who has got to be one of the most fun fights to have. Nothing 
like having your melee turn on you mid fight and kick your arse! </p>
<p><i>The Loots: Vindi BP (Blackfayth), Swiftblade of Zek (Conx), Iron Scroll 
of War (Adaria), Cloak of Falling Stars (Shou), Girdle of Magnificence (Mindark), 
Amulet of Pure Heart (Sylor)</i></p>
<h2>Piercings, to die for... </h2>
<p>Well I blame Yamile for not having any screeshots of the above loots, but I 
did get the following... I don't know what to say, however I am feeling a bit 
'uncomfortable' after reading it. However Battas (the dirty old man) was shouting 
&quot;woot!&quot; in /guild. Beffled!</p>

<h2> Telkorenar and Dain... </h2>
<p>Pretty much the tittle says it all. We busted both Telkorenar's and Dain's 
chops for some loots since they were up. No issues as usual.</p>
