      <h2>Guild Recruitment Policy</h2>
      <p>Our <a href="recruiting.html">Guild Recruitment Policy</a> has been updated 
        and changed significantly. For those of you interested in joining our 
        guild the first place to start should be there. Other place with useful 
        information are our <a href="charter.html">Charter</a> and <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> 
        (which has also been updated), which will both hopefully answer some of 
        the questions that you might have. </p>
      <p>Another quick note, for as much as I have ragged on people to get the 
        profiles up and updated due to the fact that<a href="http://www.magelo.com"> 
        www.magelo.com </a>is down, you are all off the hook. When (if) they come 
        back I will again to rag on people to do this so just be prepared for 
        it.</p>
      <p>- <a href="mailto:yamile@appotusdominus.com">Yamile</a> </p>
      <p>Just as soon as I post something about Magelo being down, they decided 
        to come back to life so the ragging resumes. Again if you haven't please 
        go to <a href="http://www.magelo.com"> www.magelo.com</a> and fill out 
        your character profile. If you have done so please make sure to keep your 
        profile updated with your current level and equipment. Maybe most importantly 
        please make sure that you key ring is accurate, this allows us to find 
        out who is able to go were and if you have a key but it is not on your 
        list you might just get left out in the cold, so please attempt to keep 
        this up to date as possible. </p>

      <p>In the hopes of beginning what should become a regular Appotus Dominus

      <h2>Tangrin AKA Newbs on Parade</h2>
      <p> In my quest for my epic snake staff, I would let nobody's whining and 
        complaining stop me from forcing everyone to kill the tangrin today. The 
        first valiant attempt saw us reduce the tangrin to &quot;the&quot; in 
        the tangrin. These people performed this task:</p>

          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>After we came so close, we sent the call out to the guild, and they responded 
        by sending a couple more brave soldiers into the fray. These peeps were 
        added for the second run at the tangrin:</p>
      <table width="90%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

            <p>Carraaki 53 Warrior </p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>On this second attempt we ran the tangrin into the ground with little 
        remorse. Battas ended up with 90 mana and Yamile had 40 as superior tactics 
        and firepower spearheaded a cleaned up effort on the tangrin. The newbs 
        rejoiced as their long time foe was vanquished!</p>

      <p>There really were few deaths to speak of save one unsavory incident with 
        a &quot;very unpleasant&quot; hand. We wiped the entire floor clean of 
        loot bearing mobs and collected 2 Cleric BPs, 2 Warrior BP's. 2 epic pieces, 
        and countless other pieces of armor to improve our guild. The raid overall 
        was fairly uneventful and ran smoothly.<br>
        <br>
        Perhaps the biggest accomplishment of the day was beating Maestro like 
        a drum. We pulled him to the safe spot and waxed him with only a few deaths. 
        (Tip: he really hates the Rune line of spells). Our mass tanking monking 
        pallying power was too much for him and he was broken off with no melee 
        casualties. In addition to Maestro, we also beat down the monk mini boss 
        who was kicking it on the first floor. </p>
      <p> Aside from this eventful moment there really isn't too much to say. 
        We broke in, broke off mobs, and broke out. However, it did take us a 
        fairly lengthy 10 hours because of levels and numbers. Next time, (soon) 
        we are shaving off HOURS because our monks will be familiar, our enchanters 
        will know what mobs mex easily, and our tanks will have levels and phat 
        gear. Second floor: soon. </p>

      <h2>Welcome New Members!</h2>
      <p> At roughly the same time we gained two new members into the Appotus 
        Dominus crew. The first recruit we officially guilded was 54 Warrior Mycro. 
        Mycro had been along with us on a couple raids and many long boring exp 
        groups (and even the Xalgoz camp). We found his tanking to be admirable 
        and more importantly his COMMITMENT and his no nonsense playstyle to be 
        a fit with us. Mycro busted Hate's azz with us on Sunday and this was 
        a great start to his AD career. </p>
      <p> 54 Cleric Battas was a long time friend who initially joined us in the 
        Seb Disco a month or two ago. After grouping with him on and off over 
        the past month both parties eventually came to the conclusion that we 
        were like-minded in terms of loots and in game goals Battas has never 
        failed us in battle and has many of the same traits that led us to recruit 
        Mycro. </p>

      <h2>Verina Tomb: Bia Bia</h2>
      <p> Last night we were able to track down and run under Verina Tomb. After 
        weeks of searching for her lame cleric azz and patches messing with her 
        spawn she was finally up and we ran her down. And, one enchanter is happier 
        today because of it.</p>
      <p> Much love to the Tomb Crew:<br>

      <p> Needless to say, we punked her out. She may not be spawning for a while 
        due to embarrassment. For the love of God, she complete healed and we 
        still ran her down. </p>
