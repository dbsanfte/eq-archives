      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">Y</font>our guild 



        has a FAQ? Are people really asking you questions on a frequent basis 



        about your guild? </p>



      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">Q</font>uiet, you. 



        I won't lie; I made up all the questions myself.</p>



      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">W</font>hat does 



        Appotus Dominus mean?</p>



      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">T</font>here is 



        actually a story about how we got our name that has a modicum of entertainment 



        value. </p>



      <p>Originally, we wanted to be called &quot;Cobra Kai&quot; after the sinister 



        Dojo in the loved Karate Kid movies. However, we submitted this name and 



        it was denied because it was supposedly &quot;media&quot;. Despite our 



        moans of protest the powers that be crushed our name and left us to curl 



        in the fetal position. Many tears were shed, and bitter words were spoken 



        about Verant.</p>



      <p>Next, in out attempts to get a cool name past the 'thought police' or 



        'Gestapo' at Verant we came up with &quot;Drunken Masters&quot;. The rejoicing 



        began. This was our name, this was us, this was our true calling. As we 



        talked more we discussed how we would like to kill large mobs in-game 



        drunk. The excitement rippled through our small group as we patted ourselves 



        on the back. Surely, this name would make it through! </p>



      <p>Then, like an anvil from the sky, the slam down fell upon us. It nearly 



        crushed us. I personally wanted weep for days in my room with a hearty 



        supply of Bon Bons and Wendy's hamburgers. For what its worth they told 



        us we should not have any reference to being drunk in the game. </p>



      <p>/rant on <br>



        This is the most preposterous thing I have ever heard of in my whole life. 



        These morons walk around in the game and HAND ME ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES. 



        I can brew them if I want. I can drink them at any time. I can get drunk 



        in game. However, I can't make a guild mentioning being drunk in a humorous 



        way. <br>



        /Rant off</p>



      <p>This really crushed our spirits. However, Whiteout took it upon himself 



        to do a little scholarly research. He translated Drunken Masters into 



        Latin, and lo and behold it sounded cool. Next Verant asked us what this 



        meant. We kindly told them it meant &quot;clumsy masters&quot;. Whether 



        out of stone cold laziness, the lack of desire to deal with our angry 



        emails, or because they simply approved of this we were approved. Hence 



        Appotus Dominus was born. It means &quot;Drunken Masters&quot; in Latin.</p>



      <p><br>



        <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">W</font>hat is the 



        basis for the guild?</p>



      
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">T</font>he guild is based 
around four friends who like to play EQ together. Those founding fathers are Dapper, 
Duridain, Whiteout, Yamile, and Ciliem.. What makes the guild special is that 
on weekends we all go over to Dapper's house (much to the chagrin of his wife) 
and play EQ for something like 20 hours. We operate in a highly efficient way 
and we are good at what we do. </p>



      <p>We have the guild tag for guildchat. If that's all we ever have it for, 



        we frankly do not care. We are not desperate for your ass, or to change 



        how we operate. If you suggest a lot of changes you will not be revered, 



        bottom line. We are dogmatic and we all get angry quickly. The way to 



        our hearts is through stone cold ass kissing. Don't want to? Good, we 



        didn't need you anyway. </p>



      <p><br>



        <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">W</font>hat are the 



        goals for the guild?</p>



      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">W</font>e don't 



        know, okay? Basically, we have these raging fights every weekend. Occasionally, 



        I have wanted to blacken the eyes of many of my dear guildmates. We have 



        problems getting along most times, so that makes it very hard for us to 



        decide where we want it to go. There are only a few key things that we 



        want to do right now:</p>



      <p>(A) We are going to 60, asap.<br>



        (B) We want phat lewts.<br>
(C) We will try almost anything. </p>



      
<p>So, whether we grow or not is up in the air. If you are cool, and we like playing 
with you then you will probably get an invite. If you have an interest in being 
a part of a small elite team, then we are interested. We want quality, not quantity. 
</p>



      <p><br>



        <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">Y</font>ou're quite 



        the cocky dickhead aren't you?</p>



      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">T</font>his is our 



        rhetoric, of course I am. I'm really much nicer in game, unless you're 



        a moron or want me to make you velium jewelry for 200pp. </p>



      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">W</font>hen do you 



        normally play?</p>



      
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+3">M</font>ost of the guild 
is in the Eastern and Central Time Zones. Most member play during the night time 
areas in their time zone and then much of the weekend. There is also a AD nightshift 
that is &quot;run&quot; by Whiteout who works third shift so there is usually 
a few players on during the night time hours of EST. </p>
