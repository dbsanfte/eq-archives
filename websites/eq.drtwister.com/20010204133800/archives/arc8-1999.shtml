So it appears that at least the Network/Packet information will be obtainable eventually, even (I Hope) Ashran and Jarret can give the information for a EQ Emu Server, or at least start work on one. But we all know what they're best at, creating tools to "Enhance" your gameplay.

                According to a recent email I received, it <I>is</I> possible, and it <I>has</I> happened.  This sounds pretty plausible to me, but then again, I'm a moron.  Take a look for yourself.<br><br><font color="yellow"><br>A friend of mine who happens to be a guide on another server told me about this happening last night. <br> <br>he received a call from a player stating that her race had permanantly changed. Well when he arrived she had told him that not more than an hour ago she had been a dark elf, yet to him she showed as a highelf. He cast the GM dispel magic spell on her and sure enough she was a highelf. <br>Here is her explanation as to what happened. She was in a HighElf illusion. She was fighting and got charmed by the creature she was fighting. Not more than a minute after she was charmed she ended up dying. One of her Friendly party members ressurected her and voila she was now a permanant highelf. she could not change back to a dark elf. So she decided to test the new body and ran into Freeport. Suprisingly her faction had changed also. She ran through Freeport as free as any highelf would be able to. <br> <br>So my theory is this. if those conditions are met, this would be an interesting way to change your faction hits and still have the powers of the illusion you cast upon yourself. So all of you enchanters out there check this out and let everyone know your results.</font><br><br><br>Interesting, no?  I'm not sure if the illusion spells can be cast on others, or just yourself, but if you <I>can</I> cast them on others, haven't you always wanted a troll monk?  Try this out and give me results.

                I recently received this email, and it made me think about what I have said about dying from a DoT while gating/zoning.  In the past, I have brainstormed up ideas about how this could lead to a possible corpse dupe, and while that lead went virtually no where in the dupe category, it looks as though somebody actually has found a use for dying from a DoT while gating.  Take a look.<br><br><font color="yellow"><br><br>I have a level 8 necro.  My pet and I were fighting a giant spider in East <br>Commons.  The pet is killed and I'm poisoned.  I finish off the spider but <br>am left with barely 1/4 bubble of health.

All of my buffs are gone, as if <br>I'd died, but otherwise I'm fine.  All spells are still memorized and no <br>loss in exp.<br><br>I tried this technique again last night, and it worked.  This seems to be a <br>way to cheat death.<br><br>I don't know if you can gate and have this same effect under other <br>circumstances, for instance, poisoned but with most of your health.  It <br>would be interesting to find out.<br></font><br><br>Now, this could <I>possibly</I> lead to a very nice thing indeed.  If you have an exploitative mind like myself, you probably have already figured out what I am getting at.  For those who haven't, let me lead you on a little further.

Do any of you have level 50 warriors?  What's that you say?  No(and don't email me saying you do, because I really don't care...Unless you want to give it to me or something; then it's cool.)?  Why not?  Well, I'll tell you why not.  Because warriors are boring as hell to build, and it is impossible for them to solo, or even join a smaller group, without waiting 20 minutes inbetween fights - at least.  Try a variation of this out.<br><br><I>Step #1)  Figther and druid/necro/shaman, any class with a DoT line team up.<br>Step #2)  Fight something that you can barely handle together, and that gets the fighter low on HP, but doesn't kill either of you, while still giving nice xp.<br>Step #3)  After the monster fight is over, go near a zone border and duel.  Cast a DoT on the fighter.  When the next tick is going to kill the fighter, zone.  Hopefully, the DoT will kill him before the duel disengages, and the DoT is removed.</I><br><br>This method could prove troublesome, seeing as how it possibly may not work, because the duel may be checked before your health is, and because it is broadcasted to the whole world every time you flee, but hey, maybe it will work.  If this doesn't work, try getting poisoned, and then doing it.  Maybe that will work, if this doesn't.  Less chance of anybody suspecting you, as well.<br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                Now, I know this is not a bug, and not a method to get 1,000 plat in 15 mins, but it is still a pretty good method of power-levelling a low level char up to a somewhat respectable level in much less time than it would take otherwise.  Combine this with other methods(feign death method for necro/monk, memory blur method for enchanter, etc), and you can have a damn fine character in considerabley less time than it would otherwise take, with the proper support.  This leads to the funnest part of the game, and the only part of the game that I have ever really enjoyed - going out on guild hunts.  If you have never done this, I suggest you try it out.  Even if you are in a low level dungeon, it is very cool when you and 15 of your closest EQ friends are beating the living snot out of a level 20 mob.  This leads me to another interesting idea of mine(or maybe not so interesting...who knows) dealing with guilds.  However, I will post that lil' rant seperately, and also put it on the Petitions forum of the board when our boards come back online.  Anyhow, here is another nice trick for more efficient power-levelling.<br><br><font color="yellow"><br>I read all the powerlevling trix on your site and I must say some of<br>them<br>are pretty good.

It is a little harder for the other player to hit the MOb, but at least they will survive the battle in one piece.<br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                Now before you read this, know that you now lose xp from drowning deaths.  Now that you know that, do not totally dismiss this trick yet.  Instead of depositting summoned items in your bank before logging, like the old days, try putting it on a level 6 character, killing that character(should lose very little xp), and using him as your new "keep summoned items" bank.  Take a look at this post on the message board, submitted by Elfstar.<br><br><font color="yellow"><br>Found this out by just sheer frustration. I had just gotten about 10 summoned food and water and then died in Najena. An my way back from Neriak I got smacked by a Dragoon. Well frustration set in and I camped, thinking I would have to get my stuff and then head to FP for Provisions. Well The next day I relog in and go get my stuff and to my suprise the summoned food and water was still on my corpse. So here's a possible way to keep all those summoned items you may have. When you die from a duel or drowning you are supposed to lose no exp. So just before you log go take a dive into a pond or duel a friend you trust (don't wanna lose that nice weapon and all your duped Plat) and then camp by your corpse and when you come back in just loot your corpse and the Summoned stuff will be there.</font><br><br>-Baggle<br><br><br><br></blockquote><br>

                Well, there was discussion going on the message board all of this and last week about a working dupe.  Xenon had one, and was preparing folks on the board with clues as to the origin of the dupe for when he was going to post it Friday.  Well, apparantly, these clues were just a little <I>too</I> good, and the dupe was fixed this Wednesday, before it was even completely explained to the public.  The dupe worked like this, as taken from the message board;<br><font color="yellow">Fixed IN Last Verant Patch<br><br>The expediential money dupe…..<br>Not easy so read and print .

Get a friend, must be trusted, if u don’t have one refer to step 13<br>2. Go to a zone any zone preferably 1 where people aren't around because it will be obvious what you are doing.<br>3. Have dropman come thru zone to triggerman's side but not move 1 inch, so he is right on edge of zone.<br>4. Trade all money to drop man.<br>5. Make sure the drop man has less then 30 hp, either he can nuke himself or use a lvl 1 character.<br>6. Initiate a duel between the 2, /duel command.<br>7.

Repeat till your satisfied you have more money then you can ever spend, and really want Verant to suspend your account…<br></font><br><br>Now, this being said, let me get something else out.  Xenon has supposedly received an email from another reader, and this reader has gotten the bug to work.  I encourage you all to read the message board regarding the details of this.  You can get there by clicking the "Message Forum" link on the left hand side of the screen.<br><br>Now, as a side note, look at this I received this week regarding duping corpes.  Sounds very, <I>very</I> interesting.<br><br></font color="yellow">Hello there! I was just reading your article on duped bodies, and the<br>same thing happened to a friend of mine. We both play Necros on<br>Fennin-ro, he was fighting an emperor drake, and had one or two DOT<br>spells cast on him. He must have been killed by a DOT just as he tried<br>to gate back to steamfont(where he was bound) because he arrived looking<br>down at his body. When he went back to Lesser fay to the spot where he<br>had gated from, a dupe of his body could be found-with ALL items and<br>money intact. Dieing in mid gate must have caused this(we think)</font><br><br>Now, this sounds a lot like previous dupes having to do with dying while zoning that worked, only, this time, you actually die <I>while</I> zoning, and not just before you zone.  Try this out.  My suggestion would be this; two friends, a very low level that just got the ability to gate, and a high level necro or druid start a duel.  Have the high level cast a powerful DoT on the lower level.  Just when you are to the point where the next tick of the spell will be  the lower level player's death, cast gate.  Now, if timed correctly, you <I>should</I> die from the DoT while gating.  If the above theory is correct, you may get a duplicate corpse.  If this works, it would probably work best if you dueled one zone away or in the same zone as your bind spot.  Try this out and drop me a line about it.<br><br>-Baggle<br></blockquote><br>

                Okay, I am way too lazy to respond to all of the emails I get about this, so I will just post it here, and get it over with.  This has to do with exploring the zones of EQ while offline via the tutorial.  I wasn't too clear the first time I posted about this, and I know the message board can get kind of cluttered and hard to read sometimes, so I will post a revised version of how to do this here.  I'll try to be as straitforward and detailed as I can without confusing anybody, but sometimes I can get carried away, so who knows.  If you still have problems after reading this, post a message on the message board and see if ya can't get some of those folks to help you out.  That method usually takes much less time than waiting for my *cough* response.  So, anyhow, without further ado, here are some revised instructions(which includes a way to view zones offline with names longer than 6 chars).<br><br>1)  First of all, make a copy of tutorial.exe and save it as tutorialorig.exe or whatever you wish, unless you feel like redoing this every time you want to explore a given zone(since EQ <I>will</I> patch your tutorial.exe to the original).<br><br>2)  Open up tutorial.exe in your hex editor.  If you don't have one, get one at <a href="http://www.bpsoft.com">bpsoft.com</a>.<br><br>3)  Go to line 00197790 in the code.  It should look like this;<br><font color="yellow">00197790  65722E2E2E0A0000536F616E64736F00  er......Soandso.<br>00197790 7475746F7269616C000000004552524F  tutorial....ERRO</font><br>If you don't know how to go to a certain line in the code, do a search(alt+f3 in hex workshop) for "tutorial".  There should be 4 or 5 matches, and the line I posted above should be the last.  Just keep on using the "Find next" command until you come to it.  You should now be at the line I posted above.<br><br>4)  See where it says "tutorial...."?  That is the key to our mission.  Simply change "tutorial...." to "hateplane..." or "freeport....".  Go to the space where the first "t" is, make sure Overwrite, and not Insert is on(in hex workshop, it will say which is on the bottom right hand corner.  Press the "insert" key just above the delete key on your keyboard to change this.  <I>See the note on the bottom of this post regarding zone names.</I><br><br>5)  Now, save tutorial.exe, exit the hex editor, and run tutorial.exe.  You now </I>should</I> be in the zone you wrote in.  If you aren't, and the program gives you an error, delete tutorial.exe, make a copy of the backup, paste it into your EQ directory, rename it to tutorial.exe, and repeat steps 1-5 over again.  You probably accidently didn't do something correctly.<br><br>6)  When you want to play online, rename tutorial.exe to something else, and your backup to tutorial.exe.  Now, you don't <I>have</I> to do this, but if you don't, it will be patched to the original state, and you'll have to redo what you just did if you want to keep exploring that certain zone.<br><br>Now, there is another way to do this that I know works, but it is harder to do, and requires more editing, not to mention being more limited.  There also might be a different way that I have thought of, but haven't had a chance to try yet.  This envolves the updated version of <a href="http://rpginside.8m.com">EQInside</a>, and renaming s3d and wld files.  In theory, you could simply rename tutorial.s3d, go to fearplane.s3d(or whatever you'd like) in EQInside, rename fearplane.wld to tutorial.wld, save it, exit the program, rename fearplane.s3d to tutorial.s3d, run the unedited tutorial, and it <I>should</I> work.  I've never tried this method, but I think it </I>may</I> work.  Go ahead and try it, then send me some feedback on it, since I am too lazy to try it.  Yeah, I know you all love me.<br><br><I>Note mentioned above</I><br><font color="yellow">TOWNS<br><br>Ak'Anon         akanon<br>Erudin erudnext<br>  Erudin Docks         erudnext<br>  Erudin Palace         erudnint<br>Felwithe:<br>North Felwithe felwithea<br>South Felwithe felwitheb<br>Freeport:<br>East Freeport freporte<br>West Freeport freportw<br>North Freeport freportn<br>Grobb grobb<br>Halas halas<br>Kaladim<br>North Kaladim kaladima<br>South Kaladim kaladimb<br>Neriak<br>Foreign Quarter neriaka<br>Neriak Commons neriakb<br>Neriak 3rd Gate neriakc<br>Oggok ogguk<br>Rivervale rivervale<br>Surefall Glade qrg<br>Qeynos<br>North Qeynos qeynos2<br>South Qeynos qeynos<br>Qeynos Catacombs qcat<br><br>WORLD ZONES<br><br>Arena arena<br>Butcherblock Mtn butcher<br>Dagnor's Cauldron cauldron<br>East Commons ecommons<br>EastKarana eastkarana<br>Erud's Crossing erudsxing<br>Everfrost everfrost<br>Feerrott feerrott<br>Greater Faydark gfaydark<br>High Hold Keep highkeep<br>High Pass highpass<br>Innothule innothule<br>KerraRidge kerraridge<br>Kedge Keep kedge<br>King Xorbb's Maze beholder<br>Kithicor Forest kithicor<br>LakeRatheTear lakerathe<br>Lavastorm lavastorm<br>Lesser Faydark lfaydark<br>Misty Thicket misty<br>Nektulos nektulos<br>NorthKarana northkarana<br>North Ro nro<br>Oasis of Marr oasis<br>Ocean of Tears oot<br>PermafrostCaverns permafrost<br>Plane of Air airplane<br>Plane of Fear fearplane<br>Plane of Hate hateplane<br>Qeynos Hills qeytoqrg<br>RatheMountains rathemtn<br>Runnyeye runnyeye<br>SouthKarana southkarana<br>South Ro sro<br>Steamfont steamfont<br>Toxxullia Forest tox<br>West Commons commons<br>WestKarana qey2hh1<br><br>DUNGEONS<br><br>Befallen befallen<br>Blackburrow blackburrow<br>Cazic-Thule cazicthule<br>Crushbone crushbone<br>Guk:<br>  Guktop guktop<br>  Gukbottom gukbottom<br>Mistmoore mistmoore<br>Najena najena<br>SplitPaw Paw<br>Unrest unrest<br>Solusek'sEye soldunga<br>Lord Nagafen's Lair soldunb</font><br><br>Thanks to an anonymous emailer and the guide manual for this zone info.<br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                That's right.  New 3rd party program.  "Big deal" you say?  Well, this one is actually different from the others that have been coming out lately.  First of all, the author of the program is Ashran(I'm really starting to consider asking Ashran to marry me), and that should tell you something.  This application is called EQSpells, and, you guessed it, lists every spell in the game, what level each class has to be to get it, the mana it requires, base damage of the spell, and the messages you get when the spell is cast.  The program simply(okay, wrong word maybe) deciphers spdat.eff(spell data file in your EQ directory) and gives you the results.  For this reason, you won't need to get an updated version of the program every time a new spell is added to the game, or a change is made to a spell.  Currently, it doesn't tell you the delay of the spell, etc, or have a supporting web page, but Ashran is working on the page right now, and I am sure enhancements will be made to the program.  As a side note, spdat.eff also contains guide/GM spells, and spells that aren't(yet?) available to players.  Download the program.  You'll see what I mean.<br><br><a href="http://www.uoplugin.mcb.at/EqSpells/EqSpells_MFCStatic.zip">EQSpells_MFCStatic.zip</a><br><a href="http://www.uoplugin.mcb.at/EqSpells/EqSpells_MFCDyn.zip">EQSpells_MFCDyn.zip</a><br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                Well, I asked a Guide about the petitioning process, and here was his response. Basically from what I can tell, they determine what is easy to fix and can be fixed now. So yeah it would be understandable that if a GM is on any problems with the Boats tend to be answered first, because they're alot easier, usually moving someone to an island or moving their corpse to them (if they even do that anymore).<br><font color="yellow"><br>Your GM screen appears like normal EQ screens. As a guide, you can press G and bring up a petition list. The petitions are in no certain order (not from what I could tell anyway). A guide can "check out" a petition by clicking on it. This will bring up a box showing the users character currently in the game world, what zone they are in, and their chat name. You can click another button to see what the petition was about. God, I wish I had a screenshot or something, it would explain a lot. Basically there are buttons for the following (while in a petition): Escalate urgency, downgrade urgency, ammend/add comment, dismiss, and check in. I think they're pretty self explanitory. Sometimes petitions take a long time to solve. Even mundane tasks like summoning a corpse out of a wall can take a while. The speed at which petitions are answered has to do with how many guides are online, and how fast the guides resolve the situation. </font></blockquote><br>

It's not much but actually the FASTEST non exploiting way I've found to level is with an enchanter.  Get some insanely high level enchanter to charm two monsters for ya and havem beat each other down to near death. Then have him cancel the charm and you kill off both extremely weak monsters for double the experience.  Works great for certain areas where there are 2 mobs of same level positioned relatively close, for example in butcherblock mountains near the elven merchant are 2 level 25 dwarf guards.  Another great tactic for making gobs of money is to go to the ranger camp in lesser faydark.  There are about 8 rangers there that spawn every 5 minutes and are exactly level 25.  These rangers drop 2 weapons that can be sold for 15pp there with max cha.  Best thing to do is have a dupe character waiting there and fill all your inventory up and drop your bags and relog and sell to the merchant conveniently placed right inside the hut!  ANY high level player around 40-44 can easily wipe out the entire camp because there's a huge pathing bug there.  Seems like lesser faydark is split into several zones and if you run a few paces towards the road near the camp the rangers wont follow.  Run back toward the hut wait a few and they run back at ya.  I have personally seen level 49 pets just walk in there and kill the whole camp with some help from the player though, but for parties or weaker level soloer's using the pathing exploit is great way to make money.  Just saying the rangers are only 25, have about 700 hp so if youre high one nuke/dot, harmony, lull, etc. can easily destroy the camp.  If you got a good strategy worked out you can milk the camp real nice.  Hope I contributed something. Keep up the good work.</blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

                Alright, this is getting downright crazy. I have now an average of 4 - 6 emails every 3 hours hitting my mailbox about that thread and how-to do it. I've explained it 4 times, others have explained it multiple times as well and we still have several readers that either a) can't get it to work at all or b) keep offsetting their tutorial.exe and causing it to fail. Upon realizing the overwhelming response to this and that unfortunately even after multiple explanations some people simply can't get it, I'm going to have to decline anymore emails on this subject. I'll post 1 more thread on the message board with as detailed instructions as I can, no promises. And NO I will not give out my Tutorial.exe, why? Read your EULA, I might be able to modify it at my house even though it borders on legality, I'm not going to distribute altered copies of the Tutorial. So I'm going to answer these last few messages, post 1 more thread to the message board and thats it on "teaching" people how to do this.</blockquote><br>

Then the next step is to allow us to twink to Level 50, get all the items we ever wanted and still have no monsters or annoying players! Yes that is what I want! *j/k*.

                Okay, well, I just started messing with the files again, and as it turns out, the exe must do a CRC(checks to make sure you don't mess with the file.  Terminates program if it has been screwed with) when it starts up, and if you use a s3d/wld name longer than 6 characters each(not sure what happens if it is shorter.

That's it for now, though.<br><br>However, I wouldn't be <I>too </I>worried about this being a huge setback or disappointment.  Remember that Ashran is coming out with his program soon, and let's just hope that he will include the feature of not just decompressing and saving the files in the EverQuest databases to our harddrive, but also allow us to put things into the database file.  If you don't see what I am getting at, let me be a little more direct.  You open fearplane.s3d with his program, extract fearplane.wld, rename it to tutorial.wld, put it back into the fearplane.s3d file, rename fearplane.s3d to tutorial.s3d, and then run the original, unedited tutorial.  See what I'm getting at now?  We could do this currently with just renaming files, but we cannot rename the .wld files that are inside the databases.  In the mean time, while we are waiting for Ashran's big come back, have fun exploring s3d's/wld's that are 6 letters each.<br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                I received this email today.  Certainly sounds plausible and very interesting, if nothing else.  If this could be replicated, it could mean some very nice things for quite a few greedy gamers.  Read on.<br><br><font color="yellow">Here's of how a friend ended up with duplicate corpses complete with all his gear.<br> <br>A buddy of mine was fighting down on level 3 of Befallen and gets killed by a train that someone runs right to his group. He returns to his bind point in West Commons in the tunnel to Befallen. After retrieving the equipment from his corpse and continuing to fight, he gets a tell from someone who had just zoned in. The guy tells my buddy that he just saw his corpse just outside Befallen. So my buddy is confused but curious. He goes to the coords he was given and sure enough his corpse is there and it has all of he equipment on it. The only thing is, he never died there. He looted the corpse and ended up with copies of every item in his inventory. No of the equipment went poof when he looted it and he was able to sell the items to shopkeepers.<br> <br>What we think happened was that the last time he died a bug caused duplicate corpses to be created one at the point of his death and one at his bind point. I don't know what this means, how or if it can me exploited but I certainly find it interesting what he didn't seem to have the problem that I've read most people do with duplicated items. Perhaps when I corpse is created, the items on it are created by the server based on the items in your inventory. If they were in fact not the actual items  from your inventory (i.e. items of the same ItemID#'s) that could account for the items from the two corpses not being counted as dupes. <br> </font><br><br>If anybody out there has a similar story, go ahead and send it in.

                This is actually a pretty good tip if you are starting a warrior character and don't have any high level caster friends to heal you(or you could just buy the Druid account that I am selling and heal yourself) while you build.  Just keep in mind that you can only lay hands on somebody who is 6 levels or less above you.  No biggie.  Once your friend gets to level 7, powerlevel up to level 5(pretty easy to do..and you still don't lose xp for dying at this level), and heal them until level 11.  <I>OR</I> another possibility would be to just get your higher level Paladin friend to do this for you(if you are a warrior who is higher in level), and every time you need a big heal, just have him utilize the "drowning=no xp loss" bug...<br><br><font color="yellow">I was thinking of this last night in ButcherBlock. The folks who are<br>killing NPC's are Wizzies and Druids mostly. and I though that it was<br>too bad a Warrior, Rogue or other Meleer couldn't solo them.

If you are in the same zone<br>this could mean a complete heal every 3-5 mins.

                As most of you(I know some of ya aren't this fast, but try to keep up) have gathered by the title of this update, there is a new EverQuest application coming up soon.  However, this won't just be some thrown together peice of crap with little to no functionality or use, it will be great.  Actually, I have no proof to back this up, and I don't even know the exact features that will be bundled with this upcoming download.  I do, however, know who the author is, and know his past work.  The author is the fellow who originally decoded the EverQuest database files, and sent me the skeleton.wav.  The author also has a very popular 3rd party program for UO to his credit.  <br><br>As many of you have probably guessed, the man I am talking about is Ashran.  Ashran is the author of the program UOPlugIn(UOP) for UO, and happens to be one smart cookie.  After speaking with Ashran last night, I got a little insight into his plans for the close future.  <br>In a short amount of time, a program, authored by him, aimed towards EQ is going to be released.  Although he would not give me a specific list of features, he led me to believe a couple things about the program.  <br><br>First of all, the program is going to have all of the features of EQInside.  That's a given.  I asked him to include a "preview bmp/wav" window.  We'll see.  <br>Secondly, Ashran told me that he has found out a lot of information about .wld files.  I'm guessing that these are the actual frame work for the level.  Sounds exciting.<br>Last, and probably most exciting, Ashran has told me that he will include the ability to decode spdat.eff in his application, and that it contains much information about EverQuest.  This file reportedly holds information about spell effects, damage, casting time, level, etc.<br><br>Expect to see Ashran's new program and new webpage(dedicated to such things) up and running in the near future.  I know I'm looking forward to it.  I'll keep you all updated.  In the mean time, please don't find his email address and spam him asking to beta test his application.  First of all, it is irritating to get 50 emails a day asking that.  Secondly, it ain't gonna happen.  Bah.<br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                I know this has been posted before, but I haven't heard of anybody trying to do it with quite this spin before.  The person claims it is legit, and works.  Try it out and tell me...<br><br><font color="yellow">This duplication is simple.  You need two people good timing and patience to do this. One person is the Tradee or the person who puts the item in a trade window. The other person is the Trade canclee.  How this works is on the premace of Lag.. Simple concept that it takes time for the packets to be sent from here to server back to here and vice versa with the other player.. So what happens is the Tradee puts his ruby breastplate in the trade window. The Trade canclee does a  timed countdown say 3 . 2 . 1 . and cancels the trade, at the same time the trade is cancled, the Tradee left clicks on the item in the trade window putting the item on his curser.. I'M sure every knows what happens to items when a trade is cancled... It goes back into your inventory first slot.  Well if your timing is right on and there is alot of lag it will be successful and you will end up with the Ruby BP on your curser and also one in your first slot... thing is you have to pull the modem plug immediately or the write back will drop you and destroy the item... if you try and trade the duped item without pulling the modem you are immediately dropped and the original item is given to the person your trading with..</font><br><br>Well, if you want to lag yourself to try this out, there are a couple easy things you could do.  Number one is to start downloading a file or two(they're gonna have to be big) before you enter EQ.  Another would be to install(software install, not hardware) an old, generic modem(win9x has the drivers for them...) that runs at 14.4, or 9600.<br><br>Happy hunting.<br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                Just so you all know, I read the message board pretty frequently.  While I don't read every single post, I do read the vast majority of them, and all of the posts that seem to get popular very quickly(ie; 10 replies in under 5 hours...).  Recently, there has been a huge flood of people there posting things about getting bug mailing lists going, and not posting them publicly, or trading bugs/exploits with each other.  While this <I>does</I> sort of offend me and it <I>does</I> go against the principles of what this network was built on(freedom of information), I will allow these posts to continue...Under one condition!  If you are going to post something which has a line <I>anything</I> like, "I've got a great bug.  Give me an email with your bug and maybe we can trade."  Or, "I am putting together a mailing list to keep these bugs private..."  Keep it out of the General Discussion forum, and, instead, post it in the Trade forum.  This part of the message board was designed for trade skills in-game, but it is dead, so I really doubt that you guys posting that stuff there will get any of the *cough* regulars of that forum angry.  From now on, if I see posts in General Discussion that relate to this in any way, they will be deleted immediately.  If they contain a useful(key word here!) bit of information(besides, "Well, I'm not going to tell you how to do my great dupe, but I'll let you in on a secret.  It has to do with replicating money or items!"), I <I>may</I> let it slide.  Don't expect it, however.<br><br>Much thanks to Micah for being the person to push me over the edge on this issue(not because he posted any of that; he just emailed me about it.  Don't hate him please! hehe), and getting me to finally take a stand on it.  I've been thinking about what to do about it for a while now, and this person made a good suggestion.

                Well, I recently decided to exchange my v550 PCI for the *cough* slick v770 AGP.  Everything was fine until I decided to do a FPS test in Quake 2 with my nifty new card(got a new cpu as well.  yay!).  So I install Quake 2, load it up, and, like always after just install it, it is at the default 320x200 Software settings for video, so I decide to change it to 800x600(I've got a 15" monitor, leave me alone) default openGL.  I apply the settings, aaannd...greyness.  The system freezes.  I proceed to repeat this process many more times, each time having to reset in order to regain control.  Luckily, I was in a pretty good mood, and didn't smash the monitor into the ground(although I'm sure that the 120,000 volts into my heart and brain would have been quite exhilarating).  Soon after, I searched the newsgroups, and found that this is a common problem with the card.  I found one post that said if you go into the Diamond 3D tab of the "Advanced" menu in the display control pannel, choose Quake 2 from the pulldown menu, turn off all Direct 3D effects, and then turn on the options in the openGL section, the problems will be gone.  I tried this.  I was unaware of it at the time, but this would be more difficult than expected.  I went into the tab, and unchecked a few boxes until only Mip Mapping and Single Pass Multi-Texturing were left.  As soon as I try to uncheck these boxes, my computer freezes.  When I try to simply view a sample of what each does, my computer freezes.  By this time, my monitor is still in tact, but it probably shouldn't be(I was in a really, really good mood I guess).  So, to sum this rant/whine up, if anybody has had this problem before, or knows wtf I am doing wrong, drop me a line.  <br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

Give them their notes and you will get in return Rebby's Rat Whiskers and a Note to Harkin.

For thoes people looking to do trade skills this will be a VERY nice thing to have.  Prices are much cheeper on these vendors than they are when conned Indifferntly.  Also things can be sold for higher prices as well.  Paladins will want to do these quests while earning thier Testimony of Knighthood as it requires many negative faction hits to the Freeport Militia.  Also new quests are being added with every new patch and you never know when a new quest could arrive and you wish you had some of the more odd factions in your favor.  On a side note.  An indifferent vendor will sell me a Steel Bracer for 334pp 7gp 5cp.  About a half hour later when he conned only Kindly the price had droped to 314pp 9gp for the same bracer.  This might not seem like much but for Jewlers who's gems and metals can cost into the hundreds of plat.  A meer 20pp savings on each purchase can quickly add up.</blockquote><br>

It has been described as the "digital version of crack" (Hunter Godfrey, quoted in Wired Online), as many players spend as much of their free time as possible playing the game. Since the adventure of the game is completely dependent upon the interaction between the players, EverQuest has put to rest the commonly held assumption that computer gaming is a solitary activity.  So what will happen when these online aficionados get together in flesh and blood for a day of merriment in the real world?  We will soon find out.<br><br>The event began as a casual post by player Kevin Scott on an Internet site devoted to the game, inviting fellow players in the Los Angeles area to "come hang out at a park or something".  Over the course of the following few days, the scope of the event grew to include over 150 attendees.  Some attendees will be coming from as far as Florida to attend the event.  The get together has also drawn the attention of several representatives of Verant Interactive, one of the three<br>companies responsible for bringing EverQuest to life. These members include the <b>Verant CEO, John Smedley</b>, and several members of the game's development team, who will be attending the event.<br><br>For a description of the game, please visit www.everquest.com. <br>To keep up to date on the developing plans for this event, please visit: <a href="http://www.csunbooks.com/eq">http://www.csunbooks.com/eq</a></p><br></blockquote></font><br> <br></blockquote><br>

In other words you will be running twords what ever is at the very edges of your screen.  For what ever reason MOB's have a very hard time following you like this.

                Okay, this is just a rant, and not really news, but I just gotta say this.  I think the idea of a DTN tee shirt is just too cool.  If the good doctor decides on making these, I would definately order myself one or two(or hey maybe since I'm a big celebrity, I could get one for free...hmmm).  I can imagine it now on CNN.  <br><br><I>"Dr. TwisTer gear - the new Tommy/FUBU/Gucci/Polo?  NEXT, on CNN!"</I><br><br>I could be decked out in it, from hat, to shirt, to cologne(if Michael Jordan can have his own fragrance, why can't TwisTer?), to underwear, to socks, to pants, to shoes.  The staff of the DTN would be booked at hollywood parties, talking to Larry Flynt about how our subscription to "Busty" hasn't been received yet(anybody who knows who I am taking this from, send me an email and I'll do something nice for ya), and Larry would reply that he'll send us the back issues that we've missed.  What a wonderful life that would be.  <br><br>However, there is still one logo that I want to see; one for a white shirt.  Doc, you know it is still hot out here in Cali, I can't wear a black shirt! ;)  Something I would like to see is logo #1(on the merchandise page) with a white background, black trim on the white letters and on the 'lil twister, keeping the red letters the way they are.  Anybody else think it'd be pretty damned cool to be walking down the street and have somebody tap you on the shoulder and say, "You read the DTN, too?!  COOL!"  After that, I could say something like, "Ya, I'm Baggle, so I 0wN j0o d3wD.  b0wD0wN m0f0."  Having a couple hundred walking, talking(hmm...okay, scratch the talking part.  Don't open your mouthes, guys, or people might not want to visit, if they knew the kind of people are here) advertisements wouldn't be such a shabby thing either.  Sorry if I just made an ass of myself(like you guys aren't used to it by now...and I just like to keep my bases covered), but I think that this could be pretty cool.

                Not much I can say about this one.  The first part of this email deals with an invisible wall in South Ro, while the second part deals with a really nasty way to get some free stuff in a trade.  So, without further ado...<br><br><font color="yellow">Anyway, here's the bug:<br><br>First one is a simple but highly useful bug for level 6-10s.  In SRO, by<br>the Inno Swamp zone line is a safezone.  Why is it only useful for that<br>low levelers? Because there's a ton of orc camps nearby, and not much<br>else.  There's a few derv camps, and dry bones skels along with a single<br>sand giant, but those are typically a long ways off.  I'm sure anyone<br>who's hunted down in SRO for orcs knows about it...<br><br>Second is not really a bug, but a major way to get some nice items.  It<br>might work best with an invisible friend.  First, ask to trade with<br>someone. Second, goto the person and when he is about to initiate the<br>trade, you must move back out of range from him.  What happens? The guy<br>drops the item on the ground at his feet, and you or your friend quickly<br>picks it up.  Is it really a bug? No.  Is this really assholish? Hell<br>yeah. : )<br>I'd like to add that this is a bannable offence, but you can't get<br>caught unless the guide is actually watching.<br><br>Anyway, hope those minor exploits have some substance...<br><br>-Titan SV<br></font><br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

It should now be converted to copper.

The npc is around lvl 24-25, But I was able to kill him with ease with my lvl 22 sk. So here it is, make the pet have it guard the spot where the npc spawns goto a safe location where things wont attack you that walk by, and let your pet kill this by itself over and over while you are out doing something else. Im not sure if a lvl 24 pet would be able to beat it, but try this with a lvl 28 pet, im sure that would do it. The npc would still be blue for at least another 2 lvls. </font></blockquote><br>

If this works, it could mean big bucks.<br><br><font color="yellow">I'm not going to jack around here this time, just going to post it. As we all know, there may be up to 2 days for this bug to remain in existence. I tested this one out last night, and was able to duplicate the results without fail. The duped corpse basically dupes all of your items and money, and all items were normal, can be sold, traded, etc.<br>1. Get to Erudin's Crossing, and go to the dock. Force a save by dropping something. Bind there too if you can cast the spell just in case you screw this up like I did at first.<br>2. Note the Kerran standing on the dock. Do not do anything yet. Wait for the boat.<br>3. Time this just right. When the boat is JUST pulling out, from the dock (note you can not attack from the boat so must be on the dock) ATTACK the kerran with a spell or whatever, and JUMP ON THE MOVING BOAT.<br>4. Go linkdead before the thing kills you (don't try this if you have less than 150 or so HP - they hit for 50+ damage if you are weak and could kill a newbie before they can linkdead).<br>5. You die while linkdead on the boat.<br>6. Log back in. You will have timewarped back to the dock.<br><br>Hurdle: Your corpse will now be somewhere on the bottom of the ocean and you will not know the location because you booted yourself out. Get a necro/bard to point in the direction of your corpse and start swimming. I did not run into any sharks but that doesn't mean they aren't out there. Start swimming on the bottom of ocean toward corpse and drag it back to shore when you find it.<br><br>I only tried this last night at this location. It probably works at any boat location as the warp seems to come from going linkdead on a moving boat. This one is a bit more risky because it involves an uncontrollable aspect - the timing of the boat. I don't know what would happen if there was a system-wide save just after you died while linkdead, but there is no way to wait till after the save because you rely on the boat timing. I think you just have to risk it and go for it.<br><br>Dont' screw up and miss jumping on the boat! You will just die. I found it best to stand right on dock just behind the kerran and facing the boat. Soon as I saw it move I hit autoattack and then ran and jumped on boat.<br><br>Happy duping.<br></font><br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                Welp, this email is pretty self explanatory.  Most people won't have the first idea on what to do with this information, but I am sure that some folks might find this information useful.  Does it seem like rumors about character information being stored on your hard drive just keep coming and coming?  Maybe there is some truth to it.  I suppose only time will tell.<br><br><font color="yellow">Hi Baggle,<br><br>A post on Sept 1 stated that if U disconnect your modem, U will keep<br>your no rent items. Same deal if u use the QUIT command.  So when U R<br>in Befallen with key #3, have your party watch your ass and U do a<br>quit.  When your guy vanishes, then your buds can camp. The /QUIT<br>command will allow you to keep your items.  Verant will figure a way to<br>nerf it soon :-).<br><br><br><br>Here is some info:<br><br>1). DBG.TXT .. the debugging text log that Verant can use to determine<br>where your problem is .. one little mistake. Told me that it does a<br>checksum (ding ding)<br><br>2). EQ.TMP .. the temporary file that saves your characters important<br>info (just like a windows program, always keep the info in a tmp file<br>.. just in case).<br><br>3). EQUCHK.TXT .. A CHECKSUM NUMBER (ding ding).<br><br>K .. here it goes. I do some serious programming with Lotus Notes. The<br>way that I keep 2 files (u can have the same file on 2 different<br>servers) synchronized is using a checksum #. Lotus calls it<br>"Versioning" but it is the same deal. I think that the Verant Server<br>keeps a "save file" on you. It saves whenever u do something important<br>(save, drop, pick up, trade, etc). Well .. when U pull the modem cord,<br>the server can't save shit (obviously).  BUT YOUR PC CAN SAVE AND IT<br>DOES. As a matter of fact, the moment you hit trade, a part is written<br>into the temp file that u did it. So you can't outrun the "logging" of<br>the fact that u traded the item. Now, when U log back on. The server<br>pulls your last server save and says "your checksum is 1001". Your PC<br>responds and says "OK" or "WRONG".  If you log out correctly, the<br>server and the PC have the same checksum #. If u yank the modem cord,<br>then the server uses the EQ.TMP file to figure out what should be in<br>your inventory and what shouldnt and merges that with the server's save<br>file.<br><br>We need to find a way to "decode" or change the EQ.TMP file.<br>We need to figure out how the check sum works.<br><br>** I plan on fooling with both files (just deleting them) to see what<br>happens.<br><br>And a final note:<br>On the idea that the Verant servers keep an individual ID code on EVERY<br>item. I do not believe this is true .. u would need some SERIOUS server<br>power there .. I just do not believe it is true.  I feel that the<br>"tracking" is accomplished on the client side and the "quick<br>disconnects" are a result of the client saying "I did something bad,<br>must reset".  The client is able to determine a "dupe" item.  That, I<br>am pretty sure of.<br><br>Enjoy .. more ideas on the way<br><br><br></font>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                Well, I knew it would happen sooner or later, and now it finally has.  Earlier today, Lum, of <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/">Lum the Mad</a> posted the official EverQuest guide manual on his site.  Needless to say, Verant did <I>not</I> like this one bit.  He was immediately e-mailed by the Smed-man himself(John Smedley, President and CEO of Verant), ordering him to immediately remove the manual.  Well, needless to say, it was removed soon after.  Lum ain't stupid, and he knows that he couldn't win a battle with a major company, with major lawyers(or just didn't care to pay for one, which I can't blame him for).  However, many folks downloaded this file while it was up, and I am sure that mirrors, containing the file, will be up soon.  As I have proved in the past, I am no wiz when it comes to law(or basically anything else), but for legal reasons(mainly being that I don't own this domain, or anything inside of it), I will not be supplying this file for you folks.  I will provide a link to mirrors when they become available(and you guys need to let me know when they do), but just know this now; there is basically nothing interesting contained in this .doc file.  I have been in pocession of this file for something like a month now, and it contains very little information that most people who read this site would be stimulating.  It is basically just info on how to handle the customers.  <br><br>On a more personal note(well, on a ranting tangent..), I have got to say that I have no clue why this file is so highly guarded by Verant.  From what I have seen in it(I've read about 70% of it - skipped some of the more boring sections), there is no information that you could use to possibly exploit the game with in any way.  I guess Verant just doesn't really like us being informed about what their customer service staff has the rights and obligations to do.  For those of you who have read it, notice the section on name changing, and what it instructs the staff to do in case one is needed?  That certainly doesn't apply to the situations that I have heard of, and personally experianced(poor Loveboat the enchanter;( ).  How about the section on guides and using anonymous?  I've seen them /anon many times.  Now, if everybody had access to this file, or the information, do you think they could get away with this without a potential PR disaster every time their customer service staff fooled up?  I sure don't.  <br><br>Check out Lum's site(link at the beg. of this update) for the most recent and best information.  Lum kicks my ass when it comes to just about everything;)<br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                This post is going to be short and to the point, but the information contained inside is still useful.  Currently, as I am sure you are all aware, nearly ever bug/exploit here is unconfirmed.  There is just simply no possible way that I could confirm all of the rumors I receive every single day via email.  However, I understand that everything I post being untested can be frustrating for a lot of people, including myself.  So, I am going to try and take some steps, small at first, then progressing as I go along, to make this information more trustworthy to the readers.  I've got a few ideas floating around so far.  One possibility would be to include the status of each rumor in the header of the day's update.  This could be something like; <br><br><font color="red" size="2"><B>Topic: UNCONFIRMED - Get rubi armor from bats!</font></B><br><br>Another possibily would be to add another page to this site.  The page would be the current/past bugs/exploits, and the email I received with them.  There could be an icon next to each for you to see what the status on it was, and a date next to it.  <br><br>Another possibility, although much less likely than the previously stated ones, would be to have a small team of people(who do not have accounts at this site)that vary in class/race to get the bugs the day I get them, have them test it that day/night, then email me back and tell me if it works or not.<br><br>It would be possible to implement any or all of these, even though some are more likely than others.  I would be happy to consider any of your ideas, however, the final word on this comes from the big man himself, Dr. TwisTer.<br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>
