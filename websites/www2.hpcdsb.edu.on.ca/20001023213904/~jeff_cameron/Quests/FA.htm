        <strong>What it boils down to is this:</strong><br>
        <br>
        Inte will tell you that he needs four things and upon you handing them
        to him he will give you the blade he wields. These four things are two
        blessings, the head of Miragul and the Robe of Miragul. The blessings
        are received from Inte when you give him items that prove a) your
        nobility and b) your sacrifice.<br>
        <br>
        The first blessing, nobility, is received from giving him a Soulfire.<br>
        <br>
        The second blessing, sacrifice, is received from giving him a Ghoulbane.<br>
        <br>
        The head of Miragul can be found by killing the Lich of Miragul in
        Everfrost.<br>
        <br>
        The challenge to obtain the final component, the Robe of Miragul, is
        where things get interesting. Indeed it seems it will be necessary to
        bring back Miragul from the dead (or undead as the case may be) and
        defeat him to obtain his robe. But how to do this? Well, it seems the
        two book parts dropped from the dragons can be combined to form the book
        of scale. The book of scale can then be given to the Oracle in OOT who
        will then present you with a most interesting item. No, it's not the
        robe itself but it seems instead a key component to getting Miragul
        reincarnated. How to actually do this though I have no idea.<br>

        &quot;...Miragul then left Paineel, using a small portion of his
        dwindling life energies to make a portal back to his cache hundreds of
        leagues to the north. Upon arrival, he withdrew silently to his most
        secret laboratory and prepared his final spell. Dreaming all the while
        of endless exploration and discovery, he slowly made ready his ultimate
        experiment. The enchantment laced with necromancy was finally made, and
        Miragul hid his remaining and fragile life within the phylactery, a
        small device he had pilfered from the other necromancers. Clouds of
        mystical energy gathered and then dispersed, revealing a shell of the
        man Miragul once was, an undead mage, what ancient scripts and legends
        called a lich. In his haste, however, Miragul had made a miscalculation.
        The lich, while retaining all the mystical power of his formal self,
        lacked a spirit. Only the mage’s soul, now locked within the
        phylactery hidden deep in the cache, retained the ambition and desire to
        amass knowledge and power. The spiritless lich possessed none of these
        human traits, and Miragul’s soul screamed in silence as the undead
        creature began to aimlessly wander his menagerie of wisdom and
        enlightenment, his rooms filled with artifacts of power.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Facts:</strong><br>
        <br>
        He is a necro skeleton mob in the caves in Everfrost(The ones you need
        to swim to get to) He is not hard for a 40+ group of 6. Was blue to me
        at level 49. He often wanders and tends to stay close to the entrance to
        the caves near the water. He drops his head when killed. I would assume
        that his spawn time is about 4-5 hours like most all other quest mobs
        but this is not confirmed.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Information about the Book of Scale as related to Miragul:</b></font><br>
        <br>
        <font size="2">&quot;We combined the books and gave the &quot;Book of
        Scale&quot; to the Oracle, who then tells you something about
        ressurecting yourself will lead to total chaos in Norrath (whats wierd
        is he refers to you and not Miragul). What he gives you is in fact
        &quot;Miragul's Phylactery&quot;. The item is no drop so whoever turns
        in the book must be able to do the next part of the quest. The person
        who completed it on our server was an SK. I, like you guys, figured the
        first thing to do with the item would be to give it to Miragul, the
        problem is he is KOS to everyone. Some things I would like to try are to
        see if a necro in their skeleton form is KOS, also the item has a blank
        effect on it. My guess is that this time its not a mistake on the item
        unlike many other new items in the game. I think you click on miragul
        and then activate the item with a right click. This is just a guess
        though, and I look forward to seeing what other people try.&quot;<br>

        Here are some definitions of a phylactery submitted by Beldukil

        OF. filatire, filatiere, F. phylact[`e]re, L. phylacterium, Gr. ?, fr. ?
        a watcher, guard, ? to watch, guard. Cf. Philatory.]<br>
        1. Any charm or amulet worn as a preservative from danger or disease.<br>
        2. A small square box, made either of parchment or of black calfskin,
        containing slips of parchment or vellum on which are written the
        scriptural passages Exodus xiii. 2-10, and 11-17, Deut. vi. 4-9, 13-22.
        They are worn by Jews on the head and left arm, on week-day mornings,
        during the time of prayer. --Schaff-Herzog Encyc.<br>
        3. Among the primitive Christians, a case in which the relics of the
        dead were inclosed.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>A speculation about liches:</b></font><br>
        <br>
        <font size="2">concerning liches...you can kill a lich as much as you
        like but it is never truly destroyed until you destroy their &quot;soul
        jar&quot;...basically a high level necro discorporates their soul and
        stores it in a holding device, most often referred to as a jar, that way
        if their body gets destroyed, they still have their soul and can then
        inhabit another body, then discorporate again, etc<br>
        <br>
        now the plane NPC says he was never able to defeat miragul, and would
        love his head as a trophy...ok fine, done deal go kill the lich and get
        a head<br>
        <br>
        suppose for the other part (robe i think?) you have to *truly* destroy
        miragul, which means destroying his soul....so how exactly does one do
        this? just drop the &quot;jar&quot; and break it and poof he's dead?
        probably not...i can just see having to find some special NPC who knows
        how to destroy the soul of a lich (for 2000pp of course) and then
        rewards you with the robe or something....just a thought but sort of
        makes sense a bit...of course, maybe giving miragul his soul would
        corporate<br>

        &quot;There are NPCs in Paineel who respond to questions about Miragul.
        Actually they refer to him as Myragul. Also, there is a &quot;tormented
        soul&quot; there that will not respond to my erudite shadowknight. One

        <br>
        HOW? Well there are lots of ways. You can have the Lich Harmonied and
