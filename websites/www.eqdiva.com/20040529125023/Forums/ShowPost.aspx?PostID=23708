				<td colspan="2"><span>A few months back I posted a thread about soloing Mephits in PoN. Since then I've put together some more useful information ... 
<br />

<br />
      Every class has an abundance of weapons with which they can do some amazing things if they work to figure out how to do it. But no class rivals the Bard in sheer number of options. From fear kiting, to gating mobs, to charm kiting, to charm burning, to AE kiting, to working miracles with Fading Memories, the Bard can be an amazing asset. But if you don’t know all his weapons, or you don’t care to use your head to see how you can be most effective, the Bard is a second-rate tank, horrible healer, and horrible damage dealer. Every time you face a new situation, you must have the ability to mentally run through every ability that a Bard has, to see if it can possibly be soloed. 
<br />

<br />
Part Two: You can solo almost everything
<br />

<br />
There are some targets that you just can’t solo – they are impossible. And all of them summon. So if it’s a named mob and it summons, the odds are you can’t solo it. But sometimes you CAN, but with work. So, if you see a new named, your first job is to see if it summons. 
<br />

<br />
Your second job is to analyze that named’s abilities, to develop a strategy to kill it. Are there adds, and if so, can you separate them from the named using train/fade or charm burning? Do you need to kill the adds, or can you kill the named without dealing with them? My main point here is that do not assume that you can’t kill something unless you’ve tried it a couple times. I used to have a 10 death rule: if I died 10 times trying to kill a named and made no progress, I gave up until I had a new weapon or ability, then I tried again.
<br />

<br />
Part Three: To make money, you need to sell 
<br />

<br />
Your trader is a vital link in the chain. This may seem self-explanatory to you, but it can make a HUGE difference in your cash profits. Here are some of the rules I lived by to maximize my income:
<br />
1)	Try to keep a trader going as much as you possibly can. Who knows why some people go on 4am spending sprees. Maybe they are delirious with sleep, maybe they are drunk, maybe they are Australian. I don’t care, as long as my trader was up to cash in. I ran my trader account on an old laptop. 
<br />
2)	Know the market. The more often you check to see what your main cash crops are selling for, the better you are able to adjust your prices accordingly. 
<br />
3)	Two selling strategies: Price War and Low Price Matching. You conduct a Price War with someone when you notice that they are selling their Fungus Vest for 83,999pp and you had yours at 84,000. If you want to Price War them, you set yours at 83,998 which gives you the advantage until they check the list price again. The disadvantage of this strategy is that it is energy-intensive, especially if that is their big-ticket item and just one of many in your inventory. You can go tit-for-tat forever, and people tend to get testy if you do that too much – you could be alienating a future customer. The advantage is that you have a price advantage for a short time, and your actions are likely to drive the price down and clear the items more quickly, and you can just go farm another one. If you want to employ Low Price Matching, you just match their price and let the customer decide. If the customer recognizes your name, then they will pick you. You will most likely be on more often, so you have a better chance of making the sale, and the competitor will not likely price war you, most are content with matching the lowest price. 
<br />
a.	An exception to this rule – every big guild has their mule, which likely does not adjust their prices very often. Price War the crap out of these vendors, you will always win.
<br />
4)	Don’t be a smart a$ in the auction channel. It may be tempting sometimes (at least it was for me), but this is business. Don’t start fights, don’t pick sides, be a mute, or be friendly. 
<br />
5)	Auction your gear in the auction channel and in the Bazaar. Don’t do it every 2 minutes, but keep a constant presence if you have the time. You will sell more. 
<br />
6)	Bargain! If people want to trade, and it looks somewhat fair, do it! The biggest problem you’ll face is a back-up of Lore items to sell. Diversify, keep a constant stream of pp coming in. 
<br />
7)	Last thing – if you notice someone standing right in front of you and they send you a tell, ignore it. They want you to lower your price and will most likely just buy it from you anyway in 30 seconds. 
<br />

<br />
Part Four: The Secrets
<br />

<br />
On to the good part – here are the spots where I made all my money. 
<br />

<br />
Plane of Justice
<br />
I made maybe 70% of my money from this zone. You can solo every trial for the named, one right after another. Keep in mind that there are warping problems, so please do them in the order I specify, and Fade when I tell you to. Also, make SURE you have a hotkey that reads /say return.
<br />

<br />
Cycle 1: Hanging, Lashing, Stoning, Torture
<br />
Songs to memorize: Chant of Fire, Chant of Ice, Chant of Poison, Chant of Disease, Chorus of Marr, DA, Psalm of Veeshan, Charm of Banshee
<br />

<br />
Hanging: You say “I am ready to begin the trial of hanging” and you zone into the middle of the room. Immediately put up PoV and move to one side of the gallows structure. Soon, three meanies will pop. One Spirit of Suffocation (or Phantom of Asphixiation which is the named), and any combination of fungusbeast dudes and air elemental guys. The safe strategy is to run around the room with PoV up and let them nuke you if there are no named up. If there is a named (Phantom or damniforgotthat-------name) up, target it and start to dot-kite it, all the while making SURE that PoV stays up. If PoV drops and they start landing stuns, you will have some trouble. Those fungus dudes proc 100blows, which stuns and spins you for 8 seconds. A couple of those in a row and you are finished. 
<br />

<br />
I actually started using a different strategy which alleviated the boredom a bit and reduced my failure rate to 0%. Once they pop, target the nearest fungus dude and charm him. It may take a few times to make it stick. Make sure PoV does not drop. Once you charm him, sic him on an elemental dude, or just wait for them to nuke you and your pet will automatically defend you. That way, you minimize the chances that you will take a proc. I found this way more interesting, and I occasionally was able to get to the 2nd level of the trial (you need to kill the suffocation guys before the prisoners drop). 
<br />

<br />
After maybe 30 seconds, another suffocation spirit will pop (making 4 mobs and you in the room). If there are no named, target the Sentry and press your “Return” hotkey. You will warp back to the trial room. 
<br />

<br />
This is a really good trial, as it drops one of the best droppable shoulders in the game (I sold for 20-40k each), a 2hb staff with regen on it or casters, and a casters secondary book. Check Allakazahm for details. 
<br />

<br />
Lashing
<br />
Head to the Lashing trial, zone in, open the door in front of you, and run up the stairs. Don’t go all the way to the top, the second landing from the top is fine. (If you go all the way up you risk Hanging mobs warping on top of you). 
<br />

<br />
Use track to watch for what mobs pop down below. If you get a Named (obvious from the names), then head downstairs, DA near the bottom, and then target the Named whilst you are DA. Once you have the target, run around that little room and twist your dots. I usually kept PoV up while kiting, as the Named can nuke the crap out of you. The Bard’s resists are good, but there is an off-chance that a snare could stick, and then you are -----. 
<br />

<br />
If there are no named up, stay up top until they despawn and then head back down and exit the trial. (you can also DA and end the trial early, but I liked to let them despawn – it happens quickly.)
<br />

<br />
Stoning
<br />
Once you zone into this trial, keep PoV up and quickly run to the prisoners and stand directly behind the one in the middle, against the wall. You are facing 3 doors – straight ahead, to the left, and to the right of you. Soon, 4 mobs will spawn (in pairs of two), and charge the prisoners. If there is a named up, you will hear it casting. The mobs should agro the prisoners and not you. Once they have started wailing the prisoners, move back to the sentry and get ready to press your Return key. 
<br />

<br />
If  a Named is up, wait until the prisoners die and poof, and start your dot kiting routine. Keep PoV up, there is a named there who likes to snare you and also has a mez that can land if you aren’t singing resists. DA to loot. 
<br />

<br />
Caution: Sometimes, the mobs will agro you instead of the prisoners. If this happens, move away from the one charging you and FM. They will reagro the prisoners if you are not too close. 
<br />

<br />
Caution2: After you exit this trial, FADE. If you don’t, they have a chance to pop on your head in Torture. 
<br />
Torture
<br />
Once you zone into this trial, DO NOT MOVE. If you move, you will die. Stay right where you are and check tracking to see if a named pops. If no named pops, wait until they despawn and then Return out. 
<br />

<br />
If there is a named, it’s a good idea to swap songs really fast. 
<br />
1)	Swap out any song and swap in Selos. Sing a pulse of Selos, then swap it back.
<br />
2)	Swap out Charm and Mem Druzzils, the Cancel Magic song. 
<br />

<br />
Timing is essential in this trial. Keep tracking up and watch for the mobs to despawn. Most often, 3 mobs despawn at the same time and leave the Named up alone. If so, good. Occasionally, the Named and another stay up. No worries, CHARGE!
<br />

<br />
First thing you do is Cancel Magic both of them twice at least. Keep PoV up, as they WILL be nuking you. The Named can be a Druid, and that Winged Death sucks. Once they are cancelled, they won’t have SoW and you can click off your Selos. Now make turns around that circular inside room, and chant kite that Named down. 
<br />

<br />
This trial can get hairy, but when in doubt, run in circles, keep PoV up, and twist in Chorus. With a lute, I heal at more than 150/tick.
<br />

<br />
Cycle Two: Trial of Fire
<br />
This trial is supposedly the hardest, but it is not too bad at all. Recent changes have made it even easier. 
<br />

<br />
Song lineup: Chant of Poison, Chant of Disease, Chant of Ice, PoV, Chorus of Marr, DA, Dispell
<br />

<br />
Zone in and have PoV up. Back up against the wall. I liked to stand right next to the Sentry on the other side of the room. 
<br />

<br />
Four mobs will pop. If you get a named, he will stop to buff himself up. They will all move towards the center ring if there are no named. About 20 seconds later, a hard-to-resist dot will be AE’d. If you get hit with it, dispel yourself. Once the mobs poof, you are clear to zone back and try it again. 
<br />

<br />
If you get a named, run around the edge of the room until you are near him and start to dispel him. Dispell him once or twice and then DA. If you’ve timed it right, the timed dot will bounce off your DA and you won’t need to worry about dispelling yourself. While you are DA, turn on “Walk”. Back up to the wall and make sure the Named follows you. He should be trying to take your head off. 
<br />

<br />
Now, you are going to walk backwards around the edge of the room in a circle and chant kite him down. Stay against the wall! Be sure not too move too far from him, or he will lose interest and move to the center, regenning FAST. It takes some practice, but you can absorb some blows if need be. Twist in Marr if you want to regen a bit as well. I always used Bellow AA to disrupt his spellcasting. 
<br />

<br />
Fungus Grove
<br />
This is a good camp if you are doing something at the same time, like reading. 
<br />

<br />
Song lineups: Kite – 3 chants, PoV, Marr, DA, Mez, Charm
<br />
		Melee – Rizlonas, Warsong, PoV, Marr, DA, Mez, Requiem, Charm
<br />

<br />
Withdraw some cash from the FG bank and head to Trader Snogrot (or something close), in the first village to your right as you exit the tunnel. Buy 20 or so bottles of Blagrot, and track to the Callers. 
<br />

<br />
Give 3 each (unstacked) to Groo and Torgal. While you wait for them to start moving, delete all the contracts they give you. Once the Callers start moving, follow them down to the kiting area. The Callers will proceed to their tunnel, where all 3 will poof and turn into one rooted version. Immediately Bellow this one. 
<br />

<br />
Next, move to the other tunnel and dot the other rooted version. Now you’ve established agro on yourself, and you can move away. Move to the plant sticking up almost in the middle of the cavern floor down a little ways from both Callers. Invis if you like at this point, to make sure that none of the beasties that they call agro on you – you won’t lose agro. 
<br />

<br />
And it’s agro that is important here, because if the Callers hate you, then the fungusbeasts that they call will not agro on them, which makes your job MUCH easier. After the waves rush the Caller, every once in awhile go back up and re-bellow him, so you keep agro. Mobs automatically lose agro after 10 minutes if they do no damage. So there you are, standing on the plant, watching the Callers call sets of fungusbeasts. Keep checking tracking until you see the MAGIC NAMED. His name is Tiako, and you will learn to love him. 
<br />

<br />
Once he pops, it’s showtime. You have 2 options at this point, Charm burn him down, or melee him. 
<br />
	Charm burn: Once Tiako has moved next to the Caller, mez him and run for the red dudes. Train a good majority of them to the red dudes up top, where they will brawl. FM and run back down. Charm Tiako and have him face off with the ones still left down there. Break charm at 10% with mosquito boots, and then chant him down the rest of the way.
<br />
	Melee: Same thing, except instead of mezzing, you will bellow him and train them all up top. Highsun Tiako back to his spawn point, and immediately Fade. Run back down and melee him, he should be alone and defenseless. 
<br />

<br />
Tiako drops Swollen Fungusbeast Glands (common), and Fungus Patch Vest (rare). It may take awhile to build a market for the Glands, and I only sold them to guilds who used them to give to their tanks when they needed instant agro (glands are AMAZING for that). I sold em for 10k each, and couldn’t keep em in stock. Vests are the Beastlord’s Fungi Tunic, and sold for around 80k. 
<br />

<br />
Plane of Nightmare
<br />
Here you are farming Nightmare Mephit blood, and practicing your charm kiting skills. I did this a bunch when PoP came out, and I was surprised to find that the value of the blood never really went down. The last time I sold a bunch (recently), they went for 1k each. The reason for this is that they are simply a bitch to get to due to pathing and the set-up of the zone. And they are needed to make Nightmare armor as well as the Nightmare bows. 
<br />

<br />
So check out your maps, we are headed to the Plain where Vhaksiz resides, via the tunnels. Selos up, Levitate with your boots, and get PoV going. You are basically going to make a mad dash, agroing everything in the way. Rarely, you will get a few warping on top of you when you are almost home free, so I would usually DA when I am running up the final tunnel leading to the Plain. As soon as you get past the last mephit, and are around the corner, Fade. 
<br />

<br />
Wait a few minutes for the mephit s to walk back to their spots, and then begin. 
<br />

<br />
Song lineup: Fire, Poison, Disease, PoV, Selos, Marr, Requiem of Time, Charm
<br />

<br />
You CAN charm regular mephit s. You cannot charm misery mephit s, and they are casters. So, you depending on the spawn order, you may need to do a little fancy footwork to get enough regulars to kill all the casters. 
<br />

<br />
Basically, when dealing with the casters, sic the regular on them and slow them. Drop a dot near the end so you get full exp credit. If there are a bunch of regulars, just do your regular charm kiting thing – burn down your pet, break charm, dot kite em dead. Repeat. 
<br />

<br />
I would work all the way down to the big room at the bottom and then work that room for as long as I wanted. Nearly all drop blood, and they drop BDs and gems also. The blood sells for 1k each or so. 
<br />

<br />
Also in the Plane of Nightmare, I was able to solo Vhaksiz the Shade once. But, I also found out while it is possible, it wasn’t worth my time. Most of the drops are No Drop, and the droppable shoulders are on par with Hanging shoulders, which are much easier to get. 
<br />

<br />
Nadox
<br />
Back in the day, my friend and I would take turns AE kiting almost the entire Halls of Honor zone. Nearly 120 mobs, which amounted to 3-4 AA’s per kite, and some semi-decent droppable gear. Alas, we got greedy and disrupted the zone on occasion. Groups that got in the way of our trains petitioned, eventually the Stormhammer Lead GM sat invis and watched me AE the whole zone, and wrote a report about it. Soon after, the zone was nerfed into what it is today. 
<br />

<br />
But AE kiting is not dead, and in Nadox you can get both good experience and good cash and drops at the same time. Assuming you don’t exactly know what AE kiting is, here’s what you do: Mem Denon’s Discord, Denon’s Bereavement, Melody of Mischief, Chords of Dissonance, Marr, DA,  Warsong, and Requiem. Practice turning in a tight circle with your left hand and twisting nonstop with your right. You have to develop a rhythm, like playing the piano. Start off with kiting 2 or 3 mobs, and have the dot reporting on so you know when your circles are tight enough to hit them. The perfect place to practice this is in Nadox, deep inside. There is a room with 8 pillars, set in groups of 4. In the room are undead trolls, and there is a rock tunnel that leads up to a large room full of luggalds. If you make your circle just large enough to fit it inside of these 4 pillars, then you are set. This is where you will AE kite. 
<br />

<br />
Ok, now when I kited there, I would separate the zone into two distinct pulls, each with their challenges. 
<br />
	Pull #1: I would start just before the room where Inny spawns, just outside. I would drop my invis (tiny cloak), and as soon as the two guarding the room agrod, I would start running back out while re-invising. You don’t want to agro anything with your personal proximity agro – you want them to agro because they come into contact with their agro friends. See the difference? If they agro you, then they will come charging at you, and that’s certain stunned death when there are 80 mobs following you. So charge out of the tunnel, and swing to your left and round up the room up the stairs. Follow that by rounding up the other room up the stairs on the other side. Then make big circles around the main room, collecting all those luggalds. I made a large figure 8 that would snag all of them. Then run up the tunnel to the other main luggald room and wait for the train to catch up to you. Then do a similar loop through two of the upper corner rooms, picking up an additional 12 or so mobs. Take a large loop around that main room to collect all the ones hanging around in there. Now, head down to your kiting area. 
<br />
	This is a tricky part. Run straight down and angle off to the right once you enter the room, run up against the wall and wait. If you’ve done it right, you won’t agro any undead in that room (who see past your invis). Wait on the wall for the train to come down the tunnel. As soon as you see them, make a circuit around the room, and be careful! Some of those will see you! After the room plus the train is agrod on you, circle around the outside of the 4 pillars once, and then make your circle inside. Keep turning and burning until they are all dead. Loot up if you like. In Nadox, sometimes a Named will pop from one that died, so be aware of that. If you have one Named left, slow him and melee him down. This nets you over 1aa if you do it right. 
<br />
	Pull #2: This pull is much harder. You are going to run to the zone of Hate’s Fury, collecting the two rooms off the side of the pier in the process. They will all see past your invis, so you’ve got to be on your toes. Your choice of path is crucial here, and if you get stunned, FM and get out of trouble. You might want to DA on the way back down the pier – I tried to save it for the undead caves, but it’s up to you. After you get down the pier, take a right and collect as many as you can in the undead caves. Run up the rock tunnel back to the large luggald room, and pick up the last two rooms of luggalds before you head back down to your kiting area. Don’t be discouraged if you die during the pull occasionally – it’s hard to avoid those every once in awhile. 
<br />

<br />
The loot here is pretty good – you can easily make 5k an hour on gems alone, and I’ve sold some of the droppable loot for 20k or more. 
<br />

<br />
I’ve camped for fungi tunics in Seb – it’s definitely doable. Run down to the king camp, FM, charm kite or melee the PH, wait. The tunic is very rare though, and I didn’t do that for long. 
<br />

<br />
You can AE kite in fire – pull everything that doesn’t cast from Fennin’s spawn to the tables, and kite there. But there was usually a group there, and it takes so long to kill them that I would have some jackass start rooting them or trying to pull from the train. Usually I would then accidentally train them past him and FM. But conflict is never productive in the long run.
