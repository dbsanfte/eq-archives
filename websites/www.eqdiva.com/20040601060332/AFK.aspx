					<div class="ErrorMessage">
						Either you have entered a page that doesn't exist, or the page is currently
						being taken down for maintenance
						while I deploy the latest
						changes.
					</div>
					<p>

						Usually I will deploy site
						updates around 12-3am, however, since I've been currently actively working on
						the website and
						rewriting many features, I may deploy updates/bug fixes at any time. If you see
						this message, give it a few minutes while the site uploads new content.
						<br>
						<br>
						Site Maintenance typically only lasts a few minutes, shouldn't last more than
						10 minutes. If you are getting this message in the middle or the day and/or
						this page keeps coming up, feel free to <a href="mailto:admin@eqdiva.com">email
							me</a>.<br>
						<br>
						Thanks for your patience!!! </p>
					<h4>Note: March 8, 2004 10:30pm CST - parts of the site were shut down to
						analyze site performance.</h4>
					<h4>I'm told my database is hogging all the resources&nbsp;(not that I
						noticed it was slow this past week). It could be an indexing
						issue.<br><br>Thank you for your patience as this gets resolved.</h4>
