<br />
<i>&quot;Good bye I am hangin up my drum because of the Yes I’m leaving do to the recent PBAE nurf&quot;</i> 
<br />
type messages. 
<br />

<br />
On one hand I shake my head, thinking &quot;I think that person was just looking for an excuse, they must be really burned out. They should take a step away.&quot;
<br />

<br />
On another hand I shake my head thinking &quot;Yep bandwagon jumper.. cry FOUL and make threats and maybe they will fix the game feature. Understandable, they are frustrated too&quot;
<br />

<br />
On another hand I think to myself.
<br />

<br />
-Yes I have played EQ on and off since beta, with a long 2 years straight around the time Velious went live and a solid year when PoP went live
<br />

<br />
-Yes lots of aspects of this class have changed.
<br />

<br />
-I have never once seen a Bard AOE kite in my life. I loved chanting and grouping. I hate raiding its boring.
<br />

<br />
I also think back to the stealth nerf in DAoC and think. &quot;No way does a change to the AoE functionality equate the complete devastation of my stealth minstrel in DAoC when in March of 2002 they killed my favorite character's primary skill spec with no recourse&quot;
<br />

<br />
I am not saying anything negative towards those folks who post those &quot;That's it I quit!!&quot; messages.
<br />

<br />
The AoE thing is more than likely, a great opportunity to exit a tired, old, uninventive leveling grind game that's changed and shaped itself over the years into a odd tactical &quot;stuph whore mutual dependency-zerg for teh win addiction&quot;
<br />

<br />
A lot of players have put years and months of REAL time in their human lives into EQ. Consider it an experience. It's not  really that great of a game. But it is a matured game, and even a crappy bottle of cheesy California Merlot can taste smoothe after 5 years. Especially when shared with friends.
<br />

<br />
I am posting this quasi rambling post, mostly inspired for a few reasons. It is not intended to hurt anyone's feelings, but some of the things I say may strike a chord with some of you. (no pun intended)
<br />

<br />
-EQ is and was the first real time 3d MMP game. Prior to beta Ultima Online was pretty much the only game of its scale or magnitude. EQ is and was then *very* different character advancement model from UO. In fact no developer has even tried to emulate either since. They are both unique animals with tremendous innovations, and tremendous lack of progressive innovation in the same light.
<br />

<br />
-EQ won the sales war over the years for a number of good reasons. It hooked hardcore players, but being hardcore did not necessarily mean anything more than dedication. To reap rewards of outstanding proportions such as well this..
<br />

<br />
<a target="_new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=365770">http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=365770</a>
<br />

<br />
Nice stuff yes? Sure it is! This person played a long long time. They probably have thousands of memories, hundreds of raids, many many many stories about their years as a great EQ Bard.
<br />

<br />
Everyone knows character power equals rewards of outstanding proportions (stuph!) and of course EXP (AAs) or time.
<br />

<br />
You can't buy the truly great &quot;stuph&quot; in the bazaar, it is a trophy of exquisite power from raids. When you and your guildmates band together and using your superb knowledge of team work, understanding of what your class is supposed to do in a militaritsic execution format, and well, everyone's &quot;stuph&quot; and lots of hard work and time to get more &quot;stuph&quot;
<br />

<br />
Stuph increases your character power. It is a nice trophy of sorts to show your friends, spend time setting up a neat-0 Magelo profile so people can see something more interesting and unique than
<br />

<br />
&quot;You have played 228 days 17 hours 6 minutes and 11 seconds&quot;
<br />

<br />
or
<br />

<br />
&quot;you have killed 49,550,299 MOBs&quot;
<br />

<br />
or
<br />

<br />
&quot;You have participated in 688 raids where you pulsed 7,255,410 tics of various songs&quot;
<br />

<br />
Every game has &quot;rewards&quot; I am not making fun of the accomnplishements of many of the players out there, especially the ones who are a little tired of things &quot;constantly being messed up&quot; for years on end.
<br />

<br />
But go try Lineage 2. And you will appreciate the finer art of group combat that exists in EQ because Lineage is about as well designed as a wet paper bag in the lingere department. You will shake your head in disbelief at how such a game with so few features even has subscribers. 
<br />

<br />
For me I have been a unique animal. I have played all the MMP games with UO, DAoC, and EQ being the 3 that earned permanent residency on 4 computers over 5 years. My personal experiences were that I loved my infiltrator and my envenom minstrel in DAoC more, but lord my Bard in EQ sure is versatile. But there isn't much I can do, and I just don't want to 2 box again like I used to. I'm happy grouping from time to time where I can earn AAs. but now a race to 70 begins, so maybe I will grind some exp in pick up groups. it won't affect my guild, they all left the game when Elements of Darkness expired on CT and I just could not stand the DKP whores on Stormhammer (even adults can be selfish little kids for $40 a month)
<br />

<br />
I am rambling quite profusely so let me try and make a few points.
<br />

<br />
-If you have been a hardcore EQ player for eons and you want to &quot;hang up your drum&quot; sure get it off your chest. Go try some other MMP games. some have nice features and they all have much better graphics. They are not as complete as EQ quite simply because of the 5 years that EQ was able to mature and got constant development beyond a &quot;token live team&quot; like most MMP games end up with.
<br />

<br />
-Tell everyone.
<br />

<br />
<i>&quot;Hey folks. Gosh I don't know what to say, but inside I feel frustrated and EQ is not living up to that magical dream it once had for me. I am going to leave the game. I may be back, but I am not sure. If I don't come back I wish you all the best&quot;</i>
<br />

<br />
I think that is a nice exit with style personally.
<br />

<br />
Some of the other postings, well.... they have a tad too much Captain Kirk in them. Don't be offended, it just &quot;comes off&quot; that way with how things are phrased.
<br />

<br />
&quot;KHHHHhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan&quot;
<br />

<br />
Ok ok I am being mean sorry<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" /> I am just teasing. take break from EQ, while you were here you missed the see hidden stealth nerf in DAoC, the 1 on 1 assassin wars to zerg festivals, the implementation of spell crafting utterly and completely nerfing melee damage.
<br />

<br />
You missed seeing UO turn from a PvP murder count game of tension into a happy land with two shards!
<br />

<br />
You missed seeing kiting removed from Anarchy Online where all mobs teleport contantly on you for free hits if you try and run.
<br />

<br />
You missed the Hero system in AC2
<br />

<br />
You missed seeing triple strike daggers become god in AC1 and then each combat skill getting so much love they all ended up too powerful.
<br />

<br />
You missed using splitpea to figure out your second taper for Imperil VI in AC1 and the removal of comps in the game.
<br />

<br />
You missed a Diablo 2 expansion! It was pretty fun!
<br />
 
<br />
You missed the launch of NWN using the 3rd edition ruleset, and that in itself is nothing, but there are hundreds of USER persistent worlds, h*ll I designed 3 for fun on my own time when I was not designing real games making other people wealthy! 
<br />
<i>http://sibe.zftp.com/gallery1.html</i>
<br />

<br />
Probably some of the coolest rock paper sscissors PvP you will ever see.
<br />

<br />
You missed world of disney.. er.. I mean warcraft ...well you have to admit it looks like Disney!
<br />

<br />
You missed SIMS online going from a quirky single player game into the #2 cyber sex game<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-4.gif" border="0" alt="Tongue out" hspace="2" />NWn is still number 1
<br />

<br />
You missed some whacky space online games and some silly anime online game which I will not waste strokes on my keyboards typing in their names.
<br />

<br />
You missed a lot of stuff. Atlan weapons, Lifebane boost, itemization of Albion, player apartments in a futuristic rubi-ka, devastating criticals, and weaponmasters!
<br />

<br />
So hang up your drum, or blue noter or other &quot;thingie that works like a musical instrument but refuses to actually look like one&quot; and take a step back.
<br />

<br />
Go farm adena, see how worthless a wolf pet quest can be, meet interesting people from Korea with character names like ggggggggggggk, or &quot;redlove&quot; or aZnK1ll()ChInese
<br />

<br />
There are kids in MMP games now that were what 10 years old when some of you got your Epic. So go expand, try some other games, focus on your real life even better! I feel sure there is someone out there who would love to have their old friend back, or wife or husband who has buried their nose at &quot;some camp&quot; for far too long!

				<td colspan="2"><span>Myscha, first off I want to apologize for using your post to base what I want to say.  I just needed to get some things off of my chest, and many statements here sparked my thoughts, so I replied.  I just wasn't sure where else to post.  That being said, I agree with you that many posts have that &quot;Soe nerfed me personally so I'm leaving!!&quot; feel to it, but there are a few points I have to disagree with.
<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">On one hand I shake my head, thinking &quot;I think that person was just looking for an excuse, they must be really burned out. They should take a step away.&quot;
<br />

<br />
On another hand I shake my head thinking &quot;Yep bandwagon jumper.. cry FOUL and make threats and maybe they will fix the game feature.</span></blockquote>
<br />
Some of us fall into a different category.  Okay, maybe it's just me, but the reason why my drum has been gathering dust is because I'm just plain tired of it all.  
<br />
- I'm tired of needing to be in a top end guild just to get flagged for content, let alone better equipment. 
<br />
- I'm tired of being required to be online at a certain time just to be able to join a raid for a shot at further content.  
<br />
- I'm tired of the endless xp/aaxp grind.  Sure, I have no problem getting groups or soloing to get the necessary xp.  But that's just it, I'm pursuing xp not as a result of exploration and/or fun, but just so I can meet guild requirements just so I can be with friends.
<br />
- I'm tired of the fact that gear and flags and xp (and songs) is what gets you into groups and guilds, and not pure talent and a likable personality.  
<br />
- I'm tired of the fact that all of these flags, xp, and gear is required to join your friends in a guild.  Guilds are generally not looking at folks based on skill and personality.  But even if they did, one cannot join said friends without flags at the very least.
<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">-I have never once seen a Bard AOE kite in my life. I loved chanting and grouping. I hate raiding its boring. </span></blockquote>
<br />
I have not ae'd for xp at all in my 65/170ish career.  I have solo'd about 2/3 of that xp.  That is not to say that I haven't used it for other means though such as ts item farming or factioning.  Given a few more aa to up the mods on my instruments, I was looking forward to having ae kiting as another option for xp besides swarming gargs/hobs in pon, or chanting elsewhere.  Now that is not possible.  To me, the truth of the matter is not the fact that ae kiting needed to be fixed, but the fact that it was removed from the game.  A skill that has been around since the very beginning.  SoE could have just reduced the affect, not remove it entirely.  What would happen if SoE took quad kiting from druids and wizards?  It is one of their class defined abilities but they both would still have other options to be able to solo.  Think they would accept it?
<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">-Yes lots of aspects of this class have changed. </span></blockquote>
<br />
I have been playing since just before Kunark came out.  Once Luclin was released, I rolled my bard which has since then been my main character.  I have seen many things change.  One of the reasons why I love the bard so much is the fact that I have been able to adapt to each and every change.  Even though change is good, and I welcome it, I do not welcome change in the wrong directions or for the wrong reasons.  Imho, since SoE took over, changes to EQ has been about the almighty dollar and not about the player base.
<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">-If you have been a hardcore EQ player for eons and you want to &quot;hang up your drum&quot; sure get it off your chest. </span></blockquote>
<br />
Harmonea was a very respected person on these forums.  I'm not sure if she considers herself hardcore, but she was definitely a strong voice in this community.  To see her go is definitely a sign of the times.  She is not the only one that has had too much and decided to finally quit.  I may not be hardcore by anyones definition, but I was incredibly dedicated to the class, and have always tried to post positive replies on these forums and those over at tCH.  But I am a nobody, which is why I didn't make a post about my retirement. 
<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">Go try some other MMP games. some have nice features and they all have much better graphics. They are not as complete as EQ quite simply because of the 5 years that EQ was able to mature and got constant development beyond a &quot;token live team&quot; like most MMP games end up with. </span></blockquote>
<br />
I'm going to see how Saga of Ryzom plays out, and have signed up for the Wish Beta 2.0 coming out in December.  Wish is touting itself to be the anti-eq, with a seamless world (yes, done before) and a dedicated online team of DM's who continuously introduce new content.  When mobs die, they die for good.  When quests are completed, they are completely finished.  The world will evolve based on players actions, and not what sells the most expansion cd's.  But this is just based on what I have read.  I hope to see how all of this works sometime around 2Q 2005.
<br />

<br />
As I said, I'm tired of it all, and now I'm tired of rambling, so I leave you all with a fond farewell.  I may however post still on occasion.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>I thought I'd add my feelings to this thread. EQ is a game, hobby, entrtainment venue, whatever you prefer to call it. As such, SOE is primarily a service company. When said service company decides to announce the pushback of an expansion release for the express purpose of adressing community concerns (read: to improve customer service) and then fails to deliver on its promise to do so, people get upset. 
<br />

<br />
Me, I finally took a hard look at exactly what I was recieving from sony in the way of customer service. Would I accept any service company I deal with ignoring communications of dissatisfaction? Would I accept any service company lying baltantly and unabashedly about any manner of things (no new nerfs, delay of ooW to deal with issues, things on top 10 issues lists under consideration)? The answer is obviously no. I would take my business elsewhere.
<br />

<br />
Now, I'm not considering cancelling my accounts due to the PBAE nerf, I thought it was well-considered and probably overdue. Also, I'm not considering cancelling because I find the current state of the game uninteresting and unchallenging. Or because I feel that all 10 of our issues should have already been acted upon and implemented, frankly some I think will hurt our class more than help. All that said, I find the lack of meaningful communication to resolve dissatisfaction within the playerbase to be both demeaning and arrogant. THAT is why, if I hang up my drum (not decided yet), I will do so. Their business model obviously accepts the loss of longtime customers due to lack of resolution of difficulty. It must. If it didn't my concerns would not exist. There would BE customer service.
