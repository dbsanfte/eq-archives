<br />

<br />
Looking at all other classes the diff between lvl 60 spells and 64 are HUGE compared to bard song, I hope this changes with new expansion they don't seem to know what high lvl bards need.
<br />

<br />
I think high lvl bards need an AE stun song for upper levels CC, i find it odd that we don't have one, i often do ldon without enchanters and are on pulling/CC.
<br />

<br />
Since our whole sta regen is now gone i think an AE stun song would add to our CC abilities.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Let's look at this in terms of haste songs:
<br />

<br />
At level 60, your choice of main haste song is between Vilia's Verses of Celerity and McVaxius' Rousing Rondo.  Vilia's is 45% group haste, no stats, good for when you lack an enchanter's haste.  Compare this to McV's, which is a much smaller haste but includes STR and ATK buffs and a DS component.  It is better for grouping with an enchanter or other main haster.
<br />

<br />
Now let's look at what you get at level 62 from an ethereal parchment turn-in:  Warsong of Zek.  It is 60% group haste and is also a buff to STR and ATK and a DS.  In other words, this song is like slamming Vilia's and McV's together at 900mph in a nuclear fusion reactor.  The difference is huge:  with a decent brass instrument modifier, WoZ can crank out some crazy ATK and DS numbers considering that it is only a single song in your twist.  It's far more effective at being a haste or a buff song than any of its predecessors.
<br />

<br />
Now let's look in terms of overhaste and spell focusing:
<br />

<br />
At level 60, you have access to Warsong of the Vah Shir (25% overhaste, exceeds cap, and has a better duration than most bard songs) and Composition of Ervaj (10% stacking haste that does not exceed the cap and a minor AC buff).  If you've done some LDoN, you may also have access Rizlona's Fire, a random 0-30% DD focus that nukers will adore.  That's all well and good, but if you want to buff your group to the max with this line, you're looking at twisting at least two (maybe three) songs from this category alone.
<br />

<br />
And then, at level 64, you get Rizlona's Call of Flame (cross your fingers on the spectral parchment turn-in).  This song is 30% overhaste, beyond the cap, and it is also a random 0-30% DD focus.  One song now takes care of the functions of the entire preceding line from the 50s (the additional 5% haste from Ervaj is pretty negligible since it doesn't raise the cap, as melees at this level start hitting the cap pretty easily with their nifty haste items plus WoZ or an enc haste.  Its AC component is generally negligible as well).  At 65, if you've been in love with LDoN like I have, you can get Call of the Muse, which is the exact same thing as Rizlona's Call of Flame except that it ALSO has a random 0-30% DoT focus component.  That's three awesome DPS-boosting effects in one song, as opposed to the multiple songs that are necessary to achieve anything like it at a lower level.
<br />

<br />
Now let's look in terms of damage shields and resists:
<br />

<br />
At level 60 you have access to your AE chorus resists.  Elemental Chorus and Purifying Chorus are both extremely useful raid songs and I have no intention of saying a single bad thing about either of them.  You also have access to the five basic Psalms, which will buff <i>one</i> resist stat very nicely (especially with a singing mod boost) while giving your group a fair DS.  This is pretty nice.
<br />

<br />
And then at level 63 you become the GOD of resist batteries, courtesy of a spectral parchment song.  Psalm of Veeshan adds huge resist bonuses to ALL FIVE resists at once.  With a good singing mod you can single-handedly pump a decently-geared group's resists to near the 500 cap.  It is also a DS of the same strength as your previous psalms.  Don't forget Warsong of Zek with its DS component.  With 2.4 mod (1.8 from Troubador's Mace or Epic, .6 from IM3), you can tack on an additional 36 point DS with little effort.  If you stack a decently modified Psalm of Veeshan and Warsong of Zek together, the amount of DS you create with quickly surpass that attainable by a mage or druid--and it will <i>stack</i> with theirs!!
<br />

<br />
Now let's look at Chants:
<br />
Instead of being longwinded again, I'll just refer you to the song list:
<br />
<a target="_new" href="http://www.dotnetdiva.com/eq/songlist.aspx">http://www.dotnetdiva.com/eq/songlist.aspx</a>
<br />
Even without instrument modifiers, the damage/tick from the 61+ chant line blows the old chants out of the water.  With a good percussion mod (and all the upgraded chants, which I admit can be a pain to get), you're looking at dealing obscene amounts of DoT with a 4 chant twist.  And as for Fufil's Curtailing Chant being dinky on damage, try the level 60 Fufil's Diminishing Dirge from Tak LDoN.  It deals damage that is equivalent to the 61+ chants and debuffs MR like mad.
<br />

<br />
Now let's look at the issue of Wind/Chorus of Marr giving a maximum of 20 mana per tick:
<br />

<br />
So what?  That mana regen is up there with KEI and VoQ and it <i>stacks</i> with them.  It is over twice as good as Spiritual Dominion, and it stacks with it as well!  The HP regen component from Wind/Chorus of Marr is huge, especially with a good modifier, and it can reduce the amount of mana necessary for healing if utilized properly.  Marr is also very good at giving shamans a steady Canni supply, and it is great for keeping necros healthy during Lich or for healing mod rod damage.  In other words, with the kind of FT and other mana regen buffs that casters are running around with, our mana should be a good bit of help but doesn't need to be better than 20 per tick.
<br />

<br />
Therefore, bard song upgrades do not suck.  QED.
<br />

<br />
On the subject of bards deserving a PBAE stun:
<br />

<br />
No way.  PBAE stun should be reserved for the enchanter.  It would be far too powerful for bards to be able to run up and slam crowds with stuns, especially if their durations were long at all.  We can already do a PBAE 45% slow (admittedly with a DoT component that prevents mez) to buy time when huge pulls occur.  We also have deftdance to protect us from large groups of mobs that are trying to kill our faces off while we're trying to mez them.  Enchanters do not, so they need PBAE stuns to compensate.
<br />

<br />
As far losing our stamina regen effects...how often were they really useful?  For me at least, they certainly weren't useful enough to have PBAE stuns given to us as a replacement.
<br />

<br />
Conclusion:
<br />

<br />
Bards are not meant to be the absolute best at doing everything, or even good at doing everything (especially trying to do it all at once).  Our forte lies in making the other classes better at what <i>they</i> do, filling in holes in a group's abilities when needed.  We take melees and make them swing faster and harder.  We take tanks and give them insane DSes and (if we like) AC boosts.  We take nukers/DoTers and make their spells hurt even more.  We give anyone with a mana bar a better mana supply.  We facilitate healing by providing HP regen and resists.  We help manage mobs using lulls, mezes, and slows.  We make escape or travel quicker and safer.  We make soloing look ridiculously easy.  Best of all, we can change these effects on the fly, remapping our twists to suit a changing situation.
<br />

<br />
Good bards are like good business managers:  they make sure the job gets done smoothly, quickly, and efficiently.  Though their assistance is usually indirect, they're always giving their support.  They are also rare.</span></td>

<br />

<br />
And now, allow me to rebut some of Thott's arguments from <a target="_new" href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/Thott/retune.php">http://www.afterlifeguild.org/Thott/retune.php</a>
<br />

<br />
Before I start, though, I'd like to point out that Thott's arguments are old.  They seem to be from the Luclin era (&quot;And now what do we see in Luclin?&quot;).  Many things have changed since then.
<br />

<br />
Let's discuss the subject of Bards being &quot;out-parsed&quot; (i.e. dealing less DPS, or damage per second) than other classes.
<br />

<br />
DPS is a beautiful thing.  To prove the worth of the bard class (and enchanters and shamans for that matter), I feel it is important to think of DPS in terms of two factors:  direct DPS and indirect DPS.
<br />

<br />
I define direct DPS as any damage dealt by a character solely as a result of his own attacks, spells, and buff effects of his own, cast on himself only.  In other words, bards have a very low direct DPS rating, with our highest coming from our chants.  Even though we can wreak serious havoc with those, there's not much that's spectacular about directly-generated bard DPS.
<br />

<br />
And then we get to indirect DPS, and suddenly bards are one of the strongest classes in the game.  I define indirect DPS as any increase in DPS that another character receives as a result of a buff or action from another character.
<br />

<br />
Before I give my examples, bear with me on these given rules:
<br />
Lenowill's First Rule of DPS:  Any time not actively spent in combat with mobs attempting to deal damage to them has a DPS of zero damage/sec.
<br />

<br />
Lenowill's Second Rule of DPS:  Accurate average DPS calculations <i>must</i> take periods of zero DPS (i.e. downtime) into account.
<br />

<br />
Lenowill's Third Rule of DPS:  In the end, it really doesn't matter which group member is <i>directly</i> causing damage to happen as long as the group pumps out damage well enough to eliminate downtime.  Therefore, when setting up a group, it is better to look at indirect DPS increases that occur due to interactions among classes.
<br />

<br />
Typical examples of indirect DPS from grouping:
<br />
-An enchanter/bard/shaman gives a melee character a haste buff.  Any DPS gained from the haste should be credited to the enchanter/bard/shaman when determining overall DPS value.  This is the DPS-increasing aspect of haste buffs.
<br />

<br />
-A warrior keeps mobs from hitting anyone but himself, preventing the cleric from having to heal the less-armored characters and preventing downtime.  He may also allow casters to nuke harder and more safely.  This is the DPS-increasing aspect of aggro management.
<br />

<br />
-A warrior turns a mob so that the pets have the mob's backside.  Any DPS increase due to the pets not getting parried/dodged/riposted/killed by enrage counts toward the warrior's indirect DPS.  He also ensures that the mob is never pressed into a corner, allowing for flawless melee action against its backside.  This is the DPS-increasing aspect of good mob positioning.
<br />

<br />
-The puller for a group (perhaps a bard) keeps the mobs coming, preventing any unnecessary downtime by ensuring that the group is constantly in combat unless a med break is needed.  This is the DPS-increasing aspect of steady pulling.
<br />

<br />
-A druid roots a mob that's about to try to eat the cleric.  The cleric can continue medding and does not have to waste mana healing herself.  Also, she is able to heal the tank when he needs it and thereby prevents a drop in DPS by avoiding downtime (from death or low mana).  Because he rooted the mob, the druid gets credit for that increase in DPS.  This is the DPS-increasing aspect of crowd control.
<br />

<br />
-A tank is wearing a bunch of uber gear and is taking (comparatively) tiny damage from the mobs.  The cleric only rarely has to heal him and even has enough mana to drop the occasional nuke and melee.  The tank has increased DPS by preventing downtime (through his AC and high HP count).  His tanking also happens to be good enough that the cleric literally has too much mana, allowing her to do things other than healing (a phenomenon I like to call &quot;overtime&quot;).
<br />

<br />
-An enchanter in PoK sells a wizard a hit of KEI, and the wizard goes and joins a group that lacks an enchanter.  The wizard has a nice boost to his mana regen, allowing him to nuke more often, translating to an increase in DPS.  The DPS increase, then, is attributed to the out-of-group enchanter (even though the wizard's group is given credit for it).  This is the DPS-increasing aspect of outside buffing.
<br />

<br />
-<b>A bard</b> sings a nice song named Call of the Muse in his group with a warrior, a rogue, a monk, a druid, and a cleric.  The warrior, rogue, monk, and cleric (if she's meleeing) gain a 30% overhaste effect.  Their melee DPS ratings increase.  The druid nukes or casts a DoT on the mob.  His spells are focused by Call of the Muse, meaning that the bard is indirectly adding an average of 15% damage to eat nuke or tick of DoT.  The amount of indirect DPS that bards can deal with this song is absolutely immense...and that's just one song!  This is one of the many DPS-increasing aspects of a well-played and well-twisting bard.
<br />

<br />
Bards are, hands down, the mighty kings of indirect DPS, with enchanters and shamans coming in as runners-up.  As I expressed in my previous post, bards have numerous means of increasing group DPS.  Usually, the bard isn't increasing his own DPS--but he's vastly increasing the DPS of his groupmates!  This means that a bard's overall DPS is largely determined by how powerful the other characters in his group happen to be.  If he's grouped with a bunch of wimps, then his indirect DPS increase will be slight.  If he's grouped with powerful characters, then his DPS goes through the roof--once you take indirect DPS into account.  People talk all the time about parsing individual DPS, and they whine constantly about not being as individually strong as random_class03, but really, who care's where the damage is coming from as long as it's there?  So what if I'm &quot;out-parsed&quot; by a rogue in my group?  I can rest assured that <i>I</i> am part of the reason his DPS is so good.
<br />

<br />
Therefore, our DPS does not suck.  QED.  We are by no means out of balance when it comes to putting the hurt on mobs, not because we are an army of one, but rather because we are the ones who harness and <i>increase</i> the power of a force of many.
<br />

<br />
Now let's talk about Thott's graphs.
<br />

<br />
My biggest argument against everything Thott is saying with his graphs is that he appears to be looking at the problem in terms of ONE SONG versus the most effective single spell of another class.  This is a dire mistake, as any bard worth his salt knows that twisting songs together is the key to producing powerful effects.
<br />

<br />
Also, as Thott himself points out, his graphs lack instrument modifiers.  Instruments are the original focus items of EverQuest.  They are the workaday tools of the bard class.  They must be taken into account!
<br />

<br />
On the subject of the healing graph being a flat curve, I do believe he isn't being very creative with his healing songs.  Let's look just at the level 55 part of that graph:
<br />

<br />
At 55 we get a lovely song known as Cantata of Replenishment, the joy of late fifties groups around Norrath.  With no instrument modifier, this song heals 11 HP per tick.  Even I will admit that this isn't much.  Assuming a tick occurs every six seconds, you're looking at a measly 1.83 HP/sec from Cantata--just as Thott's graph shows.  But wait, let's stick a 1.8 mod lute onto it...nothing fancy.  It now heals 20 HP/tick (assuming the formula rounds properly), or 3.33 HP/sec.  That's still not a lot.
<br />

<br />
However, that's calculated using only one song.  He neglected to mention that, at level 47, we get a song known as Niv's Melody of Preservation that also increases HP regeneration.  By level 55, its regen increase would be about 7 HP/tick with no modifier, or 1.17 HP/sec.  Now let's stick a basic 1.8 stringed instrument mod on it...again, nothing fancy; I know how much of a pain those &quot;phat lutes&quot; (pun intended) can be to acquire.  The result is that Niv's Melody of Preservation now heals 13 HP/tick (assuming the formula rounds properly).  We're now looking at 2.17 HP/sec from Niv's alone--a total of 5.40 HP/sec once we add the value from the modified Cantata.
<br />

<br />
That's still less than a paladin.  But wait!  We can slow; a paladin cannot.  Neither can druids or clerics Our slows get better and better as we level up.  Slow reduces the DPS of a mob, and damage prevented is damage healed!  The same goes for Shield of Songs and Nillipus' March of the Wee, which are minor runes (though Shield of Songs does not stack with Niv's Melody of Preservation).
<br />

<br />
Also, let's think of bards in terms of grouping.  Assuming that every member of a bard's six-person party is hurt, the bard is no longer healing 5.40 HP/sec, but rather 32.4 HP/sec--and this is without mentioning the handy mana regen bonus from Cantata.  Yes, this means that bard healing, like any other group regen healing, is most effective when everyone is taking a bit of damage.
<br />

<br />
Hm.  Bards just jumped over clerics in terms of HP/sec!  Remember, though, this effect is over time rather than instantaneous like most clerical healing.  Also, the condition of my figures is that the bard must be twisting at least two &quot;healing&quot; songs with a 1.8 mod (or better), and the whole group has to be at less than 100% HP--this situation isn't exactly common, and it limits haste twisting options. Then again, if you're going to be the healer for a group, then you're not in a common situation anyway, so you might as well get creative!
<br />

<br />
Bards do not stagnate in healing ability with level.  On the contrary, our ability to regenerate group HP or prevent its loss goes up pretty dramatically--but it only does so when you look at the whole picture rather than at a single song.  Alas, you can't have a symphony orchestra with just a wind section!
<br />

<br />
The same is basically true for the rest of Thott's graphs, and I think I've already beaten the subject of our DPS into the ground, so I'll move on.
<br />

<br />
On the subject of slows, poisons, and disease and our apparent inability to cure them:
<br />

<br />
We can.  Use Aria of Asceticism from LoY.  It works like a charm.  I'm aware that Thott is talking about Psalm of Purity and Psalm of Vitality which were supposed to have disease- and poison-curing components.  Maybe they'll be fixed someday, but in the meantime, we have Asceticism, which does a darned nice job at curing Tash, slow...the works.  Aria of Innocence is also great as a curse remover.  They can also be twisted in without dropping four of the five Psalm of Veeshan uber-resists, whereas using Vitality or Purity to cure diseases/poisons would leave only one base covered.
<br />

<br />
On the subject of focus items/FT not affecting bards:
<br />

<br />
As I stated above, we have EQ's original focus items.  We have instruments.  Why would we need any others, especially considering what I've already stated about the nature of our class?  Also, FT -does- effect bards.  So what if our songs don't generally use mana?  Use Fading Memories a few times and you'll see why FT is such a lovely thing for us to have.
<br />

<br />
Yes, Denon's Desperate Dirge needs to be changed to be affected by singing mods.  That's a minor thing, though.
<br />

<br />
As for the &quot;Christmas light effect&quot;:  Yep, we don't have a snare that works on unslowable mobs.  Consider bringing a snaring class with you when you want to fight things that run but can't be slowed.  Yep, our mez pushes don't work on mez-immune mobs.  Instead, use Brusco's Boastful Bellow, Saryrn's Scream of Pain, or the Boastful Bellow AA to shove no-mez mobs around.  Or, perhaps, you could just tell your tank to reposition it.  If you're going for an interrupt, though (on CHeal or gate), keep shoving it with those songs and the AA bellow.
<br />

<br />
Conclusion:
<br />

<br />
Sorry, but we're not underpowered.  Please do explain what you mean by &quot;our shield line&quot; and its getting progressively worse.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>WOW Lenowill, I DEFINITELY haven't studied bards as much as you have, and I consider myself to be well versed in the bard class...  Bravo! You obviously have spent a great deal of time thinking about the topic.  Thank you!
<br />

<br />
The only comment I can make is that much of Thott's information IS old, very old. He knows it and hasn't bothered to update it.  Overall I think he's been very good for bards. He's got SoE's ear and is pro-bard.  YAY!  I've read threads thrashing his way-outdated material before, but none as convincing as yours!  
<br />

<br />
To the folks bringing up old, ancient even, information from Thott, things have changed!  Just look at your UI message after xxx patch and you'll see that.  I'm sure Thott has some very current and relevent things to say these days, but using old information to make a point today is silly.
<br />

<br />
I think most bards realize that we don't add that much individually to a group in terms of DPS, but most bards and group members realize that without us, there's no them!  hehe.
<br />

<br />
From one that has never bothered to download a parsing program to see what my DPS is or isn't, thanks Lenowill, you made me realize you did it for me =).  I just know I do more damage if I'm meleeing than when I'm not, but as my last LDoN group realized, when I wasn't playing Zek and Warsong, there WAS NO HASTE! and when I wasn't playing Assonance (don't have Requium yet) there WAS NO SLOW. We won that LDoN because a bard was there, not for any other reason, and everyone that thanked me for working my butt off to earn them points realized that.  All in a day's work for a jack of all trades bard. <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif" border="0" alt="Big Smile" hspace="2" />

				<td colspan="2"><span>Thanks Aam (he and I are guildies on Inny).  I had to defend our class, and you know I can get a bit passionate about that.

Also, Sinfonian:
<br />
I was in a hurry making my last reply, so I'll use this chance to respond to your post.  Yes, I've spent four or five hours on this topic, all told, but I feel like it it's been well worth it, especially with positive feedback from one of the most frequent posters of this board.  <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif" border="0" alt="Big Smile" hspace="2" /> 
<br />

<br />
You're right on target with your LDoN example.  You basically said what I said, only you said it much more concisely in the form of a quick example.
<br />

<br />
And as for parsers:  I have never used a parser of any kind, either.  The only &quot;numbers&quot; I used in my arguments came from the song list here at EQDiva, my basic knowledge of instrument modifiers, memories from my grouping experiences, and, in my second post, Thott's own numbers (which, in the conditions and era he was using them, appeared accurate).
<br />

<br />
(Multi-paragraph argument against DPS parsing omitted in a desperate attempt to preserve the sanctity of the topic).

Level 60 bard = 114 per tick

Level 65 bard = 145 per tick

That's 28% increase in damage, guaranteed.
<br />

<br />

<br />
As for wizard damage increase....
<br />

<br />
Shock of Magic is a random 1200-3000 hit. More often than not it hits in the 2000-2500 range. It is the worst lvl 65 nuke due to the huge range in damage.
<br />
The most reliable 'big hitter' level 65 nuke is SoS which has a base max of 2740.
<br />

<br />
Compare that to Garrisons which has a base max of 2100.
<br />

<br />
On average, you're looking at a damage increase of roughly 31%.
<br />

<br />

I guess it's a little more balanced than you think.</span></td>

Bards do so much more then damage, and all that stuff scales up as well.

I dont mind being almost as good as every other class at almost everything that makes that class special.
<br />
I dont mind that there are only 3 or 4 things that we CANT do (Built in gate, Rez, CoTH, Port)

In short, I will be happy if they dont break us with next expansion.  Leave us just the way we are thank you very much.

Say a mob agros on cleric you cast mez a few times and it memblurs the mob letting tank take over the agro again.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Only a single mez song has a memblur component. Memblur on Ayonae is an anomaly, not the norm. 
<br />
Since mez is a bards most reliable way to interrupt mobs (gate, complete heal, etc)... having a memblur component in mez is not exactly something most bards would want, I would imagine.
<br />

<br />
The nicest thing about Morell is that it has no pull.  
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
PoV and WoZ are pretty freakin huge dmg shield upgrades over previous songs, so I have no idea what you're talking about... show me a level 60 bard with a 70 point damage shield.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
I really cant see what your issue is with our post 60 songs.
<br />
There is not a single song post 60 that I wouldn't consider a major upgrade.
<br />

<br />
- Chorus of Marr is almost twice as effective as Chorus of Replenishment.
<br />
- Chants do nearly 30% more damage.
<br />
- Harmony of Sound is a 50% improvement over OOS. 
<br />
- We get a long duration slow with no DOT or snare component.
<br />
- SSoQ was a long overdue lull upgrade
<br />

<br />
Druzzil's and Melody of Mischief have their situational uses but they are still very good songs.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Note: Please don't use ancients in your arguments as they are so bloody rare that only a very small percentage of bards will even have just one of them.

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">at lvl 60 our chants max damage is 42, at lvl 65 our chant damage is 42</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
Without an instrument mod:
<br />
The max damage of the sub 60 chants is 33.
<br />
The max damage of the post 60 chants is 42.
<br />

<br />
With max AAs and an elemental instrument:
<br />
The max damage of the sub 60 chants is 133.
<br />
The max damage of the post 60 chants is 170.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Let's do some math.
<br />

<br />
If you can maintain all 5 post 60 chants on a mob, you will be doing 850 per tick (142 dps).
<br />
If you can maintain all 4 sub 60 chants plus Fufil's, you will be doing 620 per tick (103 dps)
<br />

<br />

<br />
I don't know about you, but in my reality a 40% dps increase between 60 and 65 is pretty impressive.
<br />

<br />
Another thing to keep in mind is that bards can sustain this DPS indefinately as we are not tied to manapool and mana regen limitations.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
You also mentioned our 'shield' songs a number of times... could you elaborate on that? What songs are you talking about?

That you posted earlier, And I can see where you are coming from I think anyway, how we dont get a boost at healing and dmg output per sec... as much as other classes do. But consider for healing Chorus of marr, thats 20hp a tick to everyone in a raid. Say you have a small raid of 18 people... thats 360hp per tick to the raid without epic. Now take a dru/pal/clr and have them heal even just that 20hp to every person in the raid not only would it take more than a tick but it would cost mana and quite a bit of it im sure. But bards cannot really be compared by hp per sec to healers because it has always been my view that although over the course of a night a bard will heal more raw HPs than any healer, but healers can do it when someone is about to die, which sets them appart.But back to the point, the other graph thing that caught my attention was this 
<br />
<i>&quot;What does this show? It shows that bards need a 120% boost at level 60 to keep up with a naked wizard.&quot;</i>
<br />
Underneath the 3rd graph. Although I agree the statement is true but a bard is not exactly suposed to be as good as damage as a wizzy. Our other songs at the high end I belive make up for the lack of a steep increase of precentage of raw power. Because we can do so many different things if they all were raised in power as much as other classes that are &quot;suposed&quot; to do them we would be godly...</span></td>
