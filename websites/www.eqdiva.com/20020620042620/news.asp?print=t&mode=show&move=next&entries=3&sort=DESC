<tr><td colspan="2" bgcolor="#eeeeee"><br><blockquote>I took off the temporary site freeze. You may now add new hunting zone strategy guides and song comments. Go crazy!<br><br>I am currently building a fitness-related website to experiment building my first C# website using the .NET platform. I also built a family site using .NET and VB.NET last fall. I want to have alot of experience using these new technologies before I tackle upgrading EQDiva due to its high traffic. I already feel very comfortable, and have built lots of modules for websites, including user authentication systems, news, forums, although I'll probably keep EZBoard for the next year or so, they do take alot of traffic. <br><br>I can't wait though, it'll be full of cool new features! Of course, it will be free, and banner-free. Registration will be encouraged but not required, but you will need to be a registered EQDiva member in order to post hunting guides, song comments, etc.. (although you can choose to be anonymous if you post guides). You'll be able to keep a profile, and interact with the site in much more ways than currently.<br><br>I'll be selecting EQDiva website admins (from the EQDiva EZBoard forums), who will have certain privileges to add updated news and items. It will always have fresh new content, due to the knowledgeable Admins posting the latest news, articles, item info. <br><br>I'll keep you all updated on my plans of upgrading EQDiva! I know I keep saying soon, but now, I'm actually building parts of it...</blockquote></td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2" bgcolor="#eeeeee"><br><blockquote>June 6th, 2002. 3:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>** Gameplay **<br><br>- In hopes of providing more things for more people to do, certain raid level encounters in the world now return to existence a small amount faster than they used to. This was actually included in last night's patch but was not mentioned.<br><br>- <b> To address the competition between epic-seeking bards and other classes, the infamous White Dragon Scale is no longer used in the quest given by Karam Dragonforge in Rathe Mountains.  The quest now requires a White Dragon Hide. We did not reduce the rate at which White Dragon Scales enter the world, but rather added new potential for the new White Dragon Hide to be found.</b><br><br><br>** Focus Items **<br><br>- Spell casting time foci should report their new casting time properly.<br><br>- Spell duration foci designed to affect DoTs (the Affliction line) should now work reliably.<br><br>- Spell duration foci affecting beneficial spells are no longer random. They now always extend the affected buffs for their maximum. (We never wanted to make it harder to time your buffs.)<br><br>- The Affliction focus line should now only be affecting spells that do damage.<br><br>- <b>  Bards should no longer get focus item messages that weren't actually affecting them.</b><br><br>- We've re-assigned quite a few of the focus items to have their originally intended effect. <br><br>All of the same items have focus effects. However, as many people noticed, quite a few effects were mis-assigned due to a tools error. (Common, mid level items were frequently being assigned high level effects, and vice versa.) <br><br>This situation has been fixed, and the items now have the effects that we originally planned for them.<br><br><br>** Firiona Vie **<br><br>- Your server should once again have Trivial Loot Code enabled. Sorry for changing the rules on you.<br><br><br>** Chat Channels **<br><br>- Should once again work reliably for people who are using NAT or IP Masquerading via certain networking devices.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</blockquote></td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2" bgcolor="#eeeeee"><br><blockquote>June 5th, 2002 3:00 am <br>------------------------------ <br><br>** Acrylia Caverns ** <br><br>- The Chieftain has gone on a vacation. We're retuning this encounter, and beg your indulgence while we work on it. <br><br><br>** Spells ** <br><br>- Fixed magician summoned focus earrings <br>- Characters on horses are no longer immune to Ignite Bones <br>- The Shadowbond series of spells can no longer be dispelled by the Necromancer <br><b> - Nature's melody and Song of the Deep Seas should now stack with Dance of the Blades </b><br><br><br>** Items ** <br><br><b> - Added 'focus' effects to over 150 existing items </b><br>- Mischievous Chainmail armor is now Dwarf wearable (for those lil Bristlbane worshipin' dorf rogues) <br>- Changed several of the new cultural chain skirts from Leg slot to Waist slot <br>- Keys for Veeshan's Peak, Sleeper's Tomb, Vex Thal are now no-drop on the Firiona Vie server <br>- The key to the Plane of Air should now disappear when the character leaves the plane <br>- Fixed Sifaye, Owlbear Feather, Grimling fang and Rockhopper talon darts to use the Throwing skill rather than the Archery skill <br>- Added a 4 second casting time to Golem Metal Wand <br>- Added a 3 second casting time on Egg Shaped Pumice <br>- Added a 4 second casting time to Oil of Fennin Ro <br>- The effect from Hammer of the Sun (Dawncall) now has a longer range <br>- Fixed it so you can't fire fishing grubs with a bow (we know this had a lot of you worried...) <br>- Smithed Acrylia Chain and Plate armors are now magical <br><br><br>** NPCs ** <br><br>- NPC casters should be a little bit smarter now. They will choose their spells a little more carefully. <br><br><br>** Quests ** <br><br>- Arbogast and Miller should be responding properly now <br>- Sir Lucan's skeleton should be available again <br>- Fixed spawns in the Grey for Beastlord Epic <br>- The Neriak Initiate Breastplate recipe should now work <br>- Freeport Monk Guild Master Klom Jyson should be responding now <br>- Made several adjustments that should fix issues with the 10th ring war <br><br><br>** Tradeskills ** <br><br><b> - Made some changes to the General Blacksmithing difficulties to make the progression in this trade skill more logical and to allow for more variety in that path </b><br>- Added more than 200 smithing recipes <br>- Enchanted Clay is now stackable <br>- Sheet of Fiery Metal, Essence of Fire, Imp Blood, and Fiery Temper are now stackable <br>- Enchanted HQ Ore can now be worked into rings, jointing, sheets, bricks, and blocks in a standard forge <br><br><br>** Pet Changes ** <br><br>With this patch we've made some rather sweeping changes to the way pets work. <br><br><b> - Pets will not attack mesmerized creatures. Pets basically treat mesmerized NPCs as if they were dead <br>- Pets are neutral to NPCs. Monsters will not attack pets first unless the pet is being aggressive to something <br>- Pets take 75% of the experience from a creature if no player does damage to that creature <br>- Pets take ZERO experience from a creature unless no player does damage to that creature </b><br>- The exception to the above rule is Dire Charmed pets, which will take a share of the experience scaled by the amount of damage they do. In most situations (with an active party, for example) the Dire Charmed pet will not take experience. Like all pets, they will take 75% of the experience if no PC does damage to the target. As long as a player does damage to a creature, a Dire Charmed pet will never take more experience than it used to. <br><br>- Charmed NPCs will now respond to the /pet report health command <br>- /pet sit down command should now work on charmed NPCs <br>- Fixed a bug that was preventing reclaim energy from working on Magician Epic pets. <br><br><br>** Miscellaneous ** <br><br>- Fixed a bug that was causing a person that logs out with &quot;damage shields: OFF&quot; to be unable to see damage shield even when they turned them back on <br>- Fixed a problem that was causing crashes when /following someone on a horse if they went out of range <br>- Fixed a bug that prevented targeting an invisible NPC from horseback, even with See Invisible</blockquote></td></tr>
