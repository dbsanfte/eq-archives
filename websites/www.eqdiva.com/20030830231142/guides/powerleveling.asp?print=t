<h3>A Guide to Powerleveling other Characters with a Bard</h3>

What? Yup, Here doeth lie a guide for you as 
a bard to powerlevel other characters ... 
<br><br>
Recently I've had a friend powerlevelling 
another character for me (Ickle 25th 
Warrior). He as a druid can basically pop a 
few spells on me and a damage shield and 
away I go, hack slash hack ... 
<br><br>
I needed a way to return the favour and 
level his character. At first I thought about 
using another character, then I thought 
about using my Bard. 
<br><br>
Well, lets just say there are 2 ways to 
Powerlevel with a Bard. 
<ol>
<li>Snare/Fear (Boring and annoying). 
<li>Charm Leveling. 
</ol>
<h4>Snare/Fear</h4>
Snare/Fear is the general tactic that you, 
snare and fear while they batter it or cast on 
it ... Pretty simple really. 
<br><br>
I'm more interested in the second form of 
powerlevelling. 
<br><br>

<h4>Charm Leveling</h4> 
First of all decide on your fighting location. 
To start with I recomend beasts that won't 
run away. Lets say Skeletons. 
<br><br>
I'd also recommend a dungeon that you are 
familar with, lets say Befallen. Once in the dungeon, decided on a place to 
set up camp. Get the powerlevelee, to sit 
around and wait, go pull a skeleton and bring 
it back to them.
<br><br>
Now you need to kick the living **** out of 
the skeleton, until it is almost dead. Once it is within a slither of life (You should 
have taken nominal damage), Charm the 
beast using Solon's Song of the Sirens (27). 
<br><br>
As skeletons don't run it should just sit 
there. Feel the power heh, '/pet who leader'. 
<br><br>
Once the charm has broken, do not hit it. 
Your powerlevellee should now cast/hit and 
bingo they will receive all the experience. 
<br><br>
Remember to have Selo's Consonant Chain 
(23) ready, especially if fighting beasts that 
will run (eg animals etc). 
<br><br>
NB. If you snare, then charm, they will 
ignore the charm and start to run away 
slowly ... (This is a pain) 
<br><br>
Although not as good as druid leveling or 
shaman leveling, this is a feasible way to 
help a low level friend gain experience etc. 
<br><br>
NB. This tactic can also be employed if you 
have someone who is trying to Kill Steal 
you. If you have a none friendly character 
being a silly b*****d, just before the mob 
dies, pop on the charm, the beast will forget 
who has done the damage, and all you have 
to do is make sure that the unfriendly 
character does no more damage.
