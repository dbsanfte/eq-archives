				<td colspan="2"><span>Two years or so ago I quit EQ.  I am a classic casual player.  Unable to play more than an hour or so a night and I am not always able to play ever night.  I left EQ because of the level grind.  The game was always group oriented.  To solo up to your 40s might have been possible but only by a few select classes.  Levels 40+ ment either bringing your own group or sitting in a zone shouting /lfg for 30 minutes.  If you do the math 30 minutes of lfg and 30 minutes fighting didnt really make for fast leveling.  I had more alts then I knew what to do with and at level 45 my bard main and my account ended.
<br />

<br />
I waited a little while and then DAoC was released.  I was really interested and got the game as soon as it was released.  This game was new and had some innovative ideas, no matter what people say they were original ideas.  The team based PvP was fun and the ease of leveling was great.  The idea that you had three realms that essentially made three different games was awesome.  Classes were fun and growing in a game from the beginning kind of gave you a connection with it.  If you played the game you know there were certain times when you would just sit back and think how awesome it was.  Example:  I played a Shadowblade.  My guild was doing well and we were all in our high teens and low twenties.  We went to Ygg forrest for the first time and the sight of the snow falling and the sounds of the wind blowing tied together with the possibility of having an invader attack was incredible.
<br />

<br />
In technical terms DAoC's graphics were great.  This is all before the EQ upgrades so the games didnt compare.  It just looked like eq was a bit outdated.  The Exp tables in DAoC was awesome.  The longer something was alive the more exp it was worth.  Awesome way to get people to travel more.  At the beginning there was no level limit to people grouping.  The added bonus to fighting multiple mobs just made the exp fly.  All this compared to a very slow and painful system that EQ had in place.  I mean h*ll levels come on now.  My favorite line was h*ll levels were not programmed in it was just a mathimatical flaw they were unable to fix with out screwing up the whole system.
<br />

<br />
In time though it became very apparent that EQ was willing to change and evolve for the good while DAoC was falling into a rut that killed many other games and companies.  EQ started by getting the graphics upgraded.  Then they started evaluating the exp system and the different class issues.  They (meaning Sony)  really put forth an effort to make the game fun again.  While all this was happening DAoC was changing.  Class balance, EXP system changes, loot issues, PvP changes and a general feel of classes being nerfed hard instead of the game being made better.  (I also want to state that I had charcters in all three realms.  This is not a case of me whining about nerfs.)
<br />

<br />
I think the main difference between these games will be how they evloved.  EQ has actually looked at making their game better.  Eventually the game will run its course but they are doing everything possible to make the game live as long as possible and remain fun.  DAoC has had issues because they have not been able to make those same steps to move forward.

Anyway, DAoC and EQ really can't be compared straight up. DAoC has (until ToA expansion and will once again with the free Frontier expansion) focused a lot more on Realm vs Realm than PvE. The RvR system beats the h*ll out of PvP in EQ which was nothing but an afterthought. Yes there are definitely problems with class balancing and nerfing (I pity Shadowblades yet plan that as my next character.. ugh), but how often hasn't people whined about that in EQ as well?
<br />

<br />
If you are to compare the two games you need to start of explaining the differences of the games, which are huge. Also don't forget the ToA and Frontier expansions (Frontier expansion is looking d*mn good, and will be free!) when you consider DAoC.
<br />

<br />
Overall, I like DAoC. The RvR part is a lot of fun and not dominated by a certain type of population like Zek servers are (at least not the DAoC server I am on). The fact that you can go out and do RvR whenever you want to (including the Battle Grounds for lower levels), it takes away some of the feeling of doing stuff over and over and over that EQ has.</span></td>

<br />

<br />
EQ is fully focused on PvE encounters.  PvP, like Andi said, is an afterthought.  Also, PvP in EQ is more about ganking and just killing the other guy first.  DAOC requires teamwork to be successful in most aspects of RvR.
<br />

<br />
Something that's always been dissed with DAOC is that it's a PvP game.  People think of the l33t d00dz that populate the Zeks and UO when they think PvP.  DAOC changed all that - it made PvP enjoyable for the average player.  It also merged PvE and PvP remarkably well.  You can have all PvE guilds, strictly RvR (or ganking) guilds, and you can have a collaboration of casual gamers that fill both needs and be more or less self-suficient guild.  It's remarkably tight - to RvR well, to be on the top of your game, you need a combination of player-crafted and mob-drobbed gear, both activities require PvE combat.
<br />

<br />
In DAOC, RvR combat is a daily activity - you will always see people in Emain willing to fight, and the battles can range from 1 on 1, to 8 on 8 (max single group size) or massive 30-40 man (or more, depending on how big the Albion zerg is) battles.  It can be frustrating with population issues, DAOC certainly put population balance into a new light, on all servers for example, Albion has equal or greater numbers of players per the other two realms.
<br />

<br />
Growth in DAOC is much different than EQ - there is no single destination in DAOC like there is EQ (everyone's racing to the TOV/VT/the planes, etc.)  Twinking and mudflation is controlled via item decay and money sinks such as housing and item/character upkeep.  (When you die in pve, you have to spend some money to restore your constitution.)  Many actions in RvR cost money too - buying seige equipment, potions and other disposable items helps trim the fat off of the economy.  With every new character comes a hefty money investment as well that has to be maintained (especially in pve). 
<br />

<br />
However, all that being said - if you know that PvE isn't for you, DAOC is probably not your game.  There is always Geahris, but to be honest, EQ does PvE better in the long run than DAOC.  Even those that enjoy primarily PvE have to be ready for attack by an enemy player - at some point, you WILL enter Darkness Falls or the Frontier.

DAOC is boring I'm afraid.  I gave it the old college try (literally, ahahah, Elbereth, queen of bad puns) for a few months back a couple years ago, but I just couldn't get into it.  RVR might be fun on occasion, but in general it just doesn't work quite right imo.  I only got up to about lvl 40 or so, but my best friend was 50, and neither of us really had fun.
<br />

<br />
DAOC has no replay value either.  A new character really doesn't feel new compared to eq.  Not that eq doesn't have tons of problems too, but in general its better all around than any other mmo i've tried.
<br />

<br />
And I dont know why someone said ldon was lame.  It's an extremely original concept, to have a dungeon created just for your group, I think it was easily the best expansion ever just for sheer uniqueness if nothing else<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />  I'm a little discouraged that GoD is just gonna be another &quot;oooh we found a new continent we somehow missed before&quot; just like kunark and velious.  Maybe there's a plot aspect to GoD that I don't know, I dont keep up on everything.  Hopefully it will be fun, but I definitely wont buy it right away.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, how was your daoc vs eq paper?  hehe, maybe I picked the wrong topic for my master's thesis.....

I can say this as I am a teacher.

What you really need to do is once you have figured out that  a teacher is incapable of original thought outside of their carefully protected little box, that they percieve reality to be; give the teacher exactly what they want and learn inspite of them.
<br />

<br />
Dont ever let a teacher's short commings become your own.

<br />
Learn how to milk every bit of knowlege and life-experience out of the class and move onto the next.

<br />
Getting a bad grade because of idealistic differences with an instructor is childish and will only hurt your chances of getting into situations (schools and classes) where you can REALLY learn.  Use that bad teacher as a predictablely easy way to get to the next teacher who may be more free thinking.

				<td colspan="2"><span>DAoC is a fun game.. sorry. The EXP Grind in DAoC is very very dull. Worse than EQ I think. The Uber Mobs in DAoC are a pitiful comparison to EQ and most just require numbers.. the PvP Aspect of DAoC when I played was astounding.
<br />

<br />
I played as part of an Infiltrator/Minstrel team, on the Iseult server. When we started there were not too many lvl 50s. Me and my roomate would roam and kill full grps of people just the two of us. THIS was fun. I also led many raids on keeps and relics etc which were fun. Nothing like 150 people fighting over a castle (and you better hope you have 125 of that 150 =). Old School RvR in DAoC was a LOT of fun. You could build up a reputation for being skilled... Lots of peeps disliked me due to my rules on the first albion keep raids (im sorry but 200 man keep raids fail due to lag..so bye bye if yer under level 25...) but people could see that me and my friend played well and many respected that. 
<br />

<br />
Sadly now the game has become a zerg fest. I sold my DAoC accounts. There is no longer skill involved so much as numbers and classes. I wander in enemy territoy alone. Usually this was a good way to pick up lots of RPs.. now all I would meet would be groups og 6+enemy stealthers. Sure if yer lucky you can kill one..but then what? you die..you wait 15mins and head back.. yay. Bout the only fun I had in DAoC near to when I quit (year+ago now) was PvP in darkness falls.
<br />

Anyways if anyone played on Iseult fromt he start..hi =) </span></td>

<br />

<br />
There is definately skill involved in online games. Sure some classes can seem unskilled.. you might think a warrior is an unskilled class... but I can think back and think that XxXx is a good warrior but yyyyy was a sucky one. </span></td>

<br />
Knowledge or experience isn't always skill.  Now it's all well and good, I've had a lot of fights in daoc that were fun, or close (or not close), but &quot;skill&quot; had little to do with it.  None of them required timing, or accuracy, or physical condition that could be attributed to &quot;skill&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Either way, yes, it's more fun to play against someone how has experience.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, EQ's whole schtick is PvE - it d*mn well better be enjoyable. :p</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>ok this is something i typed up shortly after DAoC came out and after SoL, pre loy pop ldon or anything since.  so its a bit old, but still holds truth.
<br />

<br />

<br />
<i>Well I played EQ from beta4 until summer 01. So I have a good idea of what EQ can offer you. 
<br />

<br />
EQ plusses 
<br />

<br />
1. Established game. This means that 95% of the game to 99% of the game is known to the internet world and you can find out just about everything you need/want to know about a Quest, item, mob, ect... this is a plus for the power gamers and the newbie who just wants to be less of a newbie.
<br />

<br />
2. Stability. EQ is for the most part stable until VI runs a patch, then it is messed up for a day or so, then they run an emergency patch and things smooth back out. the insistent patching that messes things up is one of the reasons i left EQ. but as far as crashes in game and things like that. Very little.
<br />

<br />
3. Eye candy. A lot of it and with kunark, and SoV the eye candy is even nicer.
<br />

<br />
4. Game play. Yup this is a very easy game to learn and can be lots of fun to play.
<br />

<br />
5. Great game for the power gamer. If you want that then this is your game. Be a dr00d and you will never have to worry about if you have a group or not and you will be rich with phat lewt.
<br />

<br />
6. Zones. Great place to run if you are under attack and cant win the fight.
<br />

<br />
EQ negatives
<br />

<br />
1. Its run by VI (verant interactive) a bunch of greedy money hogs who do not care about their customer base other then the dr00ds and whiners. This is the biggest reason i left the game.
<br />

<br />
2. Lag spikes even with 1.5 DSL and a Cable modem connections i would lag out and go LD (link dead). Now a few years ago this was not a bad thing because VI had a nice little bit of programming that allowed you to get back into the game in under (i think) 1 min (could of been 2 min) and you would get right back into were you were when you went LD. this was nice if you are a caster or were fighting a mob because you had a good chance of still being alive. Now if you go LD the games insists that you are still in the game and will not let you back in until after 2min has passes and almost guaranties you will be dead if you were fighting. You will then be making a nasty CR (corpse run) and dealing with the lost xp you just spent 4 hours getting is now gone and VI will do nothing for you even if it is (99% of the time it is) their fault because their server dumped you.
<br />

<br />
3. Way way way over camped. VI slowed the spawn rate down (acroding to them) to slow ppl from making levels and money to fast. Like i mentioned above VI is greedy. They were afraid that if ppl hit level 50 to fast with too much money they would leave the game, so they slowed down the spawn rate and reduced the quality of drops off of a lot of the teen level mobs. This forced small groups to &quot;own&quot; a camp and fight for the right to be the only ones at that camp. VI has a play nice rule and this 'own' of a camp can get you in trouble, but no one ever listens and the GMs are so slow to respond who cares. So if you are not lucky and get a good hunting spot or get into a group at a good hunting spot you SOL (not the new expansions set for the game, but the sh*t out of luck)
<br />

<br />
4. CR if you die you have to run from your spawn point (could be many zones away) avoid all of the KOS mobs nekid and then hope you can get to your body without dieing again, then loot your body before you can be semi safe again. Or you have to shout for the next 30min for a high level cleric to give you a rez and pay em from 40-100p for the rez. Either way it’s a royal pain.
<br />

<br />
5. DOWNTIME way way way to much downtime in EQ. i will give you 2 examples. Warrior at level 36 will have close to 1500hp. if you are solo and get down to low health, lets say under 100hp, and survive the encounter and have to sit and rest up because your out of bandages after a long day of fighting. You will sit there (hopefully not attacked again) for 20min to get all of you health back. That is a lot of doing nothing time and your paying for this??? Just think how bad it will be at level 60 with over 4000hp for that same warrior. He will be sitting there for close to 1 hour to get to full health without a heal from a nice cleric. Pure caster (not enchanter or any caster above level 35) a low level 30's caster will sit for about the same amount of time as that warrior while hoping for his mana to regen and staring at his book, not able to see what is going on around him.
<br />

<br />
6. Meditation. Pure casters don’t get it until 4th, and hybrids get it at 9th. This is not bad, but until you hit 35th level you are forced to stare at your spell book and see nothing going on around you. 35 levels is a lot of game play before you can put the book away.
<br />

<br />
7. Solo. Only a few classes can solo all the way to endgame. Dr00ds, Necros, Wiz. Are about the only ones that can solo to endgame at level 60. If you are not one of these classes then there is no way you can solo all the way to endgame. All classes can solo into the mid 20s if you know what you are doing, but beyond that there is no way. If you are a casual player, then EQ is not for you unless your part of an ubur guild (and they don’t take low level players for the most part) then you will have days that you will spend more game time looking for a group and traveling to get to that group then you do hunting. I am talking as much as 2-4hours looking and traveling before you even start to hunt.
<br />

<br />
8. Trade skills. The only trade skill that will make you a true profit is alchemy and that is for high-level shammy ONLY. some ppl will argue that smiting is profitable, but you will spend close to 100k+p to learn the skill before you turn a profit, and forget making an item and selling it to merchants for a profit. That will not happen. Trade skills in EQ are only for downtime or for high-level players with cash to waist.
<br />

<br />
9. CS (customer support) what is this for EQ. they have no clue the GMs have no power to do anything other then change your name or ban your account or yell at you. And forget calling into VI for TS. You will sit there on the phone for hours on hold before you get to some nut that will tell you to uninstall and reinstall and update your drivers for your vid card and sound card. They will tell you this even when they know it is programming at their end. Yes they bold face LIE to you.
<br />

<br />
10. Class balance. Does not exist. See the Solo point above. Also if you are not a Cleric, Warrior, Enchanter then you are NOT needed in high-end groups. You will be just a place filler. VI built the game to only need those 3 classes with a little support to take mobs down.
<br />

<br />
11. Zones. ...Please wait Loading... could take from 30sec-3min to zone depending on your system.
<br />

<br />
___________________________________________________________
<br />

<br />
DAoC positive
<br />

<br />
1. New game. This means for both the power gamer and the casual player there are things to learn and explore. Its all new and exciting.
<br />

<br />
2. Stability. From release this is the most stable MMORPG in the world. Not even EQ on release was this stable.
<br />

<br />
3. lag what is that? Have not seen any lag in game yet even in the big cities with 40+ppl near me.
<br />

<br />
4. Game play. This game is very fun and easy to learn. The game play is phenomenal. (i really cant spell)
<br />

<br />
5. Great game for both the power gamer and casual player. if you do not want to be a power gamer, then you don’t have to, but if you want to power game. There is great opportunity for that too ;-).
<br />

<br />
6. Solo. All classes can solo all the way to endgame. This is huge for both the power gamer and casual player. If you don’t want to play long enough to group, then go solo if you’re after loot or xp, if you have the time, then group for the better xp and little less loot.
<br />

<br />
7. Group bonus that works. Even small groups will level much faster with the ability to kill much harder mobs and get great bonuses for killing those mobs at a faster rate. Example. Solo I kill blues for about 800-1000xp, not bad for a 10th level Thane, but then i have a little downtime between each kill. In a group with 2 healers and 2 other tanks we can take out purple++ mobs with little or no downtime for 2500+xp to ea member in the group. This makes for much faster xp and leveling.
<br />

<br />
8. Trade skills. You can profit off of your MASTER trade skill ASAP. So you really don’t have to HACK &amp; SLASH to have fun and gain loot. There is no XP for trade skills, but you can make plenty of $. i have a trade skill in armor making over 300 now and can net 2-3g per consignment. In EQ money that would be about 30p Very fun and all of the recopies are in the game. The ones that you can make with your skill level appear on your list; those you cannot make yet, are not there. Fun and a good way to get to know your capitol city.
<br />

<br />
9. CS. Mythic has paid professional CS both in game and on phone. in game = 24/7 this is a nice plus, and the only game on the market that has this at the moment.
<br />

<br />
10. Eye candy. Yup its there. No it’s not as nice as AO, but look how shitty that game turned out.
<br />

<br />
11. Class balance. 99% of the classes are balanced. I hear there is one class that is a little weak, but even with it being weak; it still can solo all the way to endgame.
<br />

<br />
12. RvR is awesome. Once you hit around level 20 or so you can start grouping in the frontier lands and kill members of the other realms. Once the game has been out long enough groups will go after the other realms Relics. These give big bonuses to the realm that captures and keep em.
<br />

<br />
13. Realm points. The more PC you kill from the other realms the more points you get. Mythic has said that as you gain realm points you will be able to turn them in in time for special gifts. Like horses that you can control, or housing, ect.
<br />

<br />
14. Guild emblems. Not only do you get your guild tag, but you get a guild emblem that everyone in your guild gets. These are very nice looking and add a bit of flavor to the game.
<br />

<br />
15. NO ZONES. No more waiting for ... Please wait loading... other then when you enter the capitol city of your realm.
<br />

<br />
16. Lots of ppl are willing to res others in their realm without charging. They just do because it is the nice thing to do.
<br />

<br />
Ok ill stop listing the positives here. There are still many more, but here are some of the negatives.
<br />

<br />
1. Not supported on windows 2000pro or XP. Yes it runs on those OS, but you will have issues.
<br />

<br />
2. Very high system specs. If you do not meet the min specs do not even try this game without upgrading. It will not run well for you and you will not be happy. There is a fair amount of complaints about loss of frame rate in game. From ever person who has complained of this they are all near the low end of system specs. i run the game on a AMD 1.1G with 512MB ram, and a GF2 MX 32MB vid card. i have only once or twice had a loss of frame rate, and that was due to my system crunching on something in the background that had nothing to do with DAoC. When I run nothing but DAoC, i have never had a FR loss no matter how many ppl are near me.
<br />

<br />
3. Minor issues with the Nvidia detonatorXP drivers. i run this set of drivers, but have no issues. There are a lot of others that do. *shrugs* no clue.
<br />

<br />
that’s about all of the negative things that i can think of about DAoC. Hope this gives you a bit of help.
<br />

<br />
</i>
<br />

<br />
after reading back over that it shows its age, but still weed out the old stuff with VI and replace that with SoE.  you still have the downtime isuses, etc.  so a lot still holds true.  again hope this helps.</span></td>

yeah a bit out of date.

some basics are still there though.  downtime, zoning, group classes vs solo classes, and trade skills in EQ are still pathetic compaired to DAoC.

from what i hear of DAoC it is now having some issues, but just like EQ is still very fun for many of its players.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>DAoC now has some issues with forcing people to PvE to be good in RvR, something which I really don't have as big a problem with as others seem to. I also am really looking forward to the free Frontiers expansion which will basically redo RvR completely (and imagine that: They will give us free respecs of our abilities because they change them a bit! Read and learn, SOE!).

EQ is the best PvE game out there still.

DAoC is (imho) the best balanced PvE and PvE game out there.
