<b>Unaffected by Amp - </b>6/27/02 10:26:09 AM<br>~ <b>Mandallin</b><blockquote>I bought this song in North FreePort wanting to try it, but not wanting to lose alot of mana.  That made me hesitant to use it for awhile.  Then I got a port from a druid to NK, because I was going to start (and finished now) the relay part of our bard epic.  When we arrived in NK, I see a Griffon and say &quot;Lets take it.&quot;  Well, we do...  The druid roots it.  I ask him if I should use my new song and he says go for it.  I start up Amp, and then blast this guy from a distance.  I didn't take any dmg because of how Kocho explained it, but I was dissappointed that it did the minimal 311 dmg even with amp.  So my discovery (sorry if someone already said this and I missed it) is that this song is Unaffected by Amp.  <br>Sorry for the long post <br>-Mandallin<br></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>What a waste - </b>2/1/02 12:34:50 AM<br>~ <b>Joannea Heartsong</b><blockquote>This song has saved me once or twice but I seldom waste a slot for it. If after grouping for a while I see there is a risk and I need a way to dump alot of damage fast I might add it but usually not.<br><br>Having the Bard med skill capped at 1 make it for the most part useless.<br><br>Joannea Heartsong 45 bard <br></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Question about the level dmg increase - </b>1/30/02 5:05:44 PM<br>~ <b>Starrsong</b><blockquote>If the amount of damage increases 10 per level, why does it say (on mine) that at level 51 it does 327 damage?  Also, could it be noted on the song info that the song does do dd to the Bard singing it, as well?  The initial comments that brought that to our attention are way down the list, and may not be seen by those who are just getting this song.  Thanks!</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Does Amplification increase dmg??? - </b>1/29/02 2:40:27 AM<br>~ <b>Chimer</b><blockquote>ok for all who do not think this song is usefull....<br><br>think on how AoE nukers use their rain spell...at a distance...it has 150 feet range from which u can stay away and blast ur target......watching out for adds of course.....If amplification would increase its dmg proportional to the increase it gives  bellow hehehe watch out...this would be one mean dueling song.... turn on selo's...run to max distance...play amp (while runing away)...now nuke them!! hehe wish i could try that out...to bad im only 29 atm..</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Not amplified by Amplification - </b>1/27/02 6:25:47 PM<br>~ <b>Szylvestro</b><blockquote>Unfortunately, as of January 25th, this song is NOT benefitted by the use of the Amplification song, even though Brusco's Boastful Bellow is.<br><br>Everyone, PLEASE do a /bug about this. MAYBE if we are lucky, they may one day look into it.<br><br>Its too bad, because at level 51, I was hoping that with Amplification up, I'd be able to do between 600-750 points, based on the increas Amplification awards to the Bellow.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Rarely useful - </b>1/16/02 1:51:41 PM<br>~ <b>Steppy</b><blockquote>It came in handy once for me, but frankly at this level you can't kill anything with this song that isn't almost dead before you sing it.  I guess if you REALLY REALLY need to taunt, it could come in handy, but at the expense of nearly all your mana, you can charm and click hide and get taunt just as easily for only 20 mana.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>This is how the song works: - </b>1/8/02 7:08:58 PM<br>~ <b>Kasreyn Giantharrow</b><blockquote>It's a ranged pillar-type AE effect.  It affects as many as 4 mobs, plus the bard.   Unless it's changed since I tested it, trust a bard who sang it with 15 mobs in his immediate vicinity - and hit 4 of them, plus himself.  It does hit the target and in the case it didn't appear to, I suspect the message would have appeared just after you died.  It also hits up to 3 more mobs if they're close enough, as well as the caster, and is identical, except being crippled, to the ranged AE capabilities of druids and wizards.  Marginally useful for finishing up a dual charmkite or after tagging the next in a serial dotkite, or for really pissing off the enchanter in an average dungeon group.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Costs too much mana - </b>1/4/02 8:16:02 AM<br>~ <b>Elli</b><blockquote>Just another crappy song. Mana is better spent on charms. Why would u want to waste one slot for this song when it's only good for certain situations. It also takes up nearly all your mana at level 43. I think bards need little bit higher meditation and lower the mana of this song to 600.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>one tick? - </b>11/12/01 10:58:44 AM<br>~ <b>yoinkeh 31 Bard on Cazic :)</b><blockquote>I was just wondering, when you fire up this song will it last for one tick only then drop off like charm does? or will it just keep ticking?</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b> - </b>11/10/01 3:22:16 AM<br>~ <b>Wayanoru Lunarsong</b><blockquote>This song first tested out good at trainer hill in Crushbone..ahem....managed to slay 4 orcs thinking they would have the best of me...then I went out to eastern wastes and tried it on an Ulthork...needless to say he didnt  feel nice...the song has descent range....so dont get close...*ouch* other than that use wisely....800 mana and with a bard and no meditate...sigh LOL<br>                          -Wayanoru Lunarsong 43rd Season</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>This song is like an AE spell - </b>10/22/01 1:08:15 AM<br>~ <b>Yackov Eaglehead</b><blockquote>Silly bards - this song is just like any wizard/druid casting his/her AE spell.  Sing the song a small distance away from your target ---- and it will hit them and all of their surrounding mobs.  There is no reason to 'suicide' anytime you use this song, just us it cautiously.  (I can't say anything though, cause this took me a while to get used to also =P)</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>bard Harmtouch :) - </b>10/19/01 8:01:00 AM<br>~ <b>Woland</b><blockquote>I call this song bard HT - mem this one in place of<br>your Selos Accelerado in indoor dungeon - maybe it can save ur life, and prolly will give u more chance to survive if u r in green dungeon.<br><br>Woland Kanly<br>52 ministrel from &quot;Order of Silver Circle&quot;<br>Drinal</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Epic? - </b>10/10/01 1:39:20 AM<br>~ <b>Nalya</b><blockquote>Does having the Singing Shortsword strengthen this song?  If so... *Insert villanous laughter here*</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Sullon Zek - </b>9/8/01 1:45:20 AM<br>~ <b>Awful</b><blockquote>imagine using this on a group of greens sitting down and chilling...lol quite a shocker coming from a bard</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b> - </b>9/7/01 11:14:54 PM<br>~ <b></b><blockquote>this song is pretty good later on... since you will never be OOM from charm (or at least i hope not...) and u have extra mana lying around... why not just use it to do about extra 400 damage?</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b> - </b>9/7/01 12:40:21 PM<br>~ <b></b><blockquote>If you target yourself and sing this song, you will take damage, so I'd advise against it.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>A little technical detail - </b>9/6/01 11:33:51 AM<br>~ <b>SourT</b><blockquote>This song - like some other targeted AoE songs- will do damage to everything AROUND the target but not the target itself.  If you want to cast it while in melee range target yourself before singing.  If you want to cast it to help your tank - target the tank then cast it.  If you want to cast it while kiting - aggro some nearby greanie mob and target on him once you have both mobs chasing after you.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Song range/effect - </b>8/22/01 4:10:04 PM<br>~ <b>Kocho Divah</b><blockquote>This is one of the few songs that is targetable area effect. If you are standing within melee range of a mob, you will get nuked too. Just back away to a safe distance, let off your moan, then only the mob will be hit (and not your party members).<br><br>Just like other classes can nuke/root themselves accidentally, but not accidentally do this to their groupmates, that is how this song behaves.<br><br>At level 54, I can do 423 damage to all mobs within range. I think I have to update/fix the song formula for this song, hehe.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Last Resort - </b>8/22/01 11:55:46 AM<br>~ <b>Aranel</b><blockquote>I've read in Dragon Raid guides that when you (the bard) become close to unavoidable death (how does one figure that out heh -- you know that's happening when Raid Leader says charge lol) to go ahead, target dragon and &quot;suicide&quot; by casting dirge.  But wanted to make sure that should I do this, it only smites me for dmg and NOT my group members.  That would really suck to kill entire party on a dragon raid. heh<br><br>Aranel of the Epic Heroes<br>Bard of the 45th song on Vazaelle</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Why do you get hit, too? - </b>8/10/01 8:43:24 AM<br>~ <b>Starrsong</b><blockquote>Is it true about this song hurting you, as well as your target?  A couple comments below say this.  Why would that happen?  Was it just a glich?  Or is this something you really must plan on?</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Same thing happened - </b>7/21/01 5:56:45 AM<br>~ <b>TS</b><blockquote>When I first got it, I hit myself for over 200 as well (had half a bubble of life left when the thing I was killing died), but that's no reason to never use it.  It WON'T hit you if you're out of it's range.  So just use it, then replace it until you have enough mana to use it again.  Remember to not get too close tho.  It is area effect.  I love going around, then seeing a low lvl about to die yelling for help and I just kill em ALL in one shot!  =D</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b> - </b>7/15/01 1:21:37 AM<br>~ <b></b><blockquote>Before I forget, this song did 399 damage to all the ice giants in Permafrost that were around me tonight. I'm a level 52 bard. So I need to update this song formula sometime.<br><br>~ Kocho</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Quite a surprise - </b>7/13/01 3:11:40 PM<br>~ <b>Andre</b><blockquote>So, although I love my bard, and would not trade him as my main for anything, this song was a true disappointment. While meleeing in a relatively low zone - Runnyeye - I caught site of the Lord PickClaw on track. I make my way down and commence to fight him. We are both at around 2 bubbles of health and I decide to blast with my song. Well, to my surprise, he took no damage at all. He did not resist, as no message came up. But I took damage which killed me. Needless to say this song has been removed from my lineup now (I had two more incidents happen that ended exactly the same). If you use this song, please, oh please be careful. You will take damage. As to why the mob took no damage and no resist message came up, I do not know and either did the GM whom I petitioned on this. <br><br>Taleesin Spiritsinger<br>Erollissi Marr<br>Bard of the now 42 song :-(</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>This will hurt you too =P - </b>6/28/01 7:17:36 AM<br>~ <b>Devard</b><blockquote>Foolish me, once I hit 43, I happily memmed this song! Knowing it'll take 800 mana (which was basically 85% roughly, me a 43 bard with the INT of 77), I pulled an ulthork and started fear kiting. After a while, I sang this song, and whaddya know? The ulthork gets hit for 311-DD instantly (w00t!), then it hits me for 243-DD, heheh =P<br><br>Well, I suppose it is non-party, but please remember not to sing this when meleeing, you'll just get yourself hurt, and 243 (and more if resists low or your high-level) means a G-Heal cast for your cleric beacuse of your stupidity =P I learned the hard way, but the ulthork still died, heheh ;)<br><br>Anyway, use with care, I now sing this to pull whenever I have enough mana to sing, cause it's just nice to see 311 pop up on the screen! =D</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

At the lvl we get this song the damage this song does is pretty wimpy compared to the mobs we're fighting so basically the only thing I use it for is to agro mobs off of casters in a jam.  In most cases its not worth the spot in the hot key menu.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
