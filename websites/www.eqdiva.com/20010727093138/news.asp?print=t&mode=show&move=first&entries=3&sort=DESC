<tr><td colspan="2" bgcolor="#eeeeee"><br><blockquote>(As commented by Espio Idsavant)<br><br>***Item Changes***<br><br>- Silver Chitin Hand Wraps' haste effect has been repaired. <br>- The Smite scroll no longer lists Enchanters as a class that can use it. <br>- The Augment Death scroll no longer lists Shadowknights as a class that can use it. <br><i>*twirls his fingers in the air, yippee*</i><br>- Many pelts have been made stackable. Those that are not stackable now are quest items that will not be made stackable. <br><i>Wooot! Great news for tailors!</i><br><br>***Spell Changes***<br><br>- Focus of Spirit will now stack with Voice of the Berserker. <br>- Barrier of Force will now stack with Protection of the Glades. <br>- Manaskin and Protection of the Glades will now stack. <br><i>*shrug*</i><br><br>***Trade Skill Changes***<br><br>- Repaired some class/deity combinations on two of the deity specific pottery Idols. <br><br>***Changes to Sullon Zek***<br><br>- There are no faction hits for killing half-elves in any city. <br><i>So half elves no longer have any 'safe zone'? Thats pretty messed up...</i><br>- If an Erudite of Paineel is killed in Paineel the killer takes a faction hit (existing rule). <br>- If an Erudite of Erudin is killed in Erudin the killer takes a faction hit (new rule). <br>- Bards can't cast harmful spells on boats. <br><i>I assume this means we can still sing buff songs, and that this *only* affects Sullon Zek.... guess we will find out.... And I have to be a jerk about this, but what about harmful <b>songs</b>? hee hee</i><br>- If a character kills a higher level character, the higher level character will always lose experience. This is in addition to the fact that any player killed within the + or - 5 level range will lose experience. <br>- Goods and Neutrals will now be able to turn in Greater Insignias for a Magician only summon corpse potion usable only at levels over 45th. <br><i>Something that wont be used for awhile...</i><br>- Characters under level 6 will no longer be immune to PvP in many adventure zones. Players will be notified when they enter such zones. <br><br>***Misc. Changes***<br><br>- /target playername will now work on invisible targets as long as the character doing the targeting has the ability to see invisible. <br><br>***Note***<br><br>Boisterous shouts can be heard across the lands as carriers herald the arrival of the latest volume of their city's newspapers. Citizens rush to get a copy of these publications to read the featured articles, latest gossip, and community news for their hometowns.<br><i>Cool, I like these newspapers, good to see they are updating them.</i><br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br><br><br>In other news... Castersrealm reports that the Stonebrunt Mountains have been released on test.<br>Quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> Reports indicate they are accessed via the Warrens, and are using Trivial Loot Code.<br><br>The zone appears to be a hilly Wakening Lands type of environment. There is a couple of open camp areas also. A number of new models are in the zone including Panda's, Rabbits, Catmen and Tigers.<br><br>The zone appears to be a little dark and overcastish, but seems like a decent place for mid level players.</blockquote></td></tr>

This will be an exciting event and good opportunity for screenshots. The first ever event of its kind, where bards from all servers gather to celebrate and promote the Bard class. We will be performing an awe-inspiring bardic concert, complete with Percussion, Wind, Brass, and String sections! We will be holding riddle contests, and drunken Selos runs, and lots more! It will be a party to remember!<br><br><a href='http://pub45.ezboard.com/feqdivabardsofeverquestfrm1.showMessage?topicID=1139.topic'>http://pub45.ezboard.com/feqdivabardsofeverquestfrm1.showMessage?topicID=1139.topic</a><br><br>Gathering of the Muse event will be held on Tuesday, July 31, exact time and location to be determined...</blockquote></td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2" bgcolor="#eeeeee"><br><blockquote>As we all know EQ is so addicting no one can stay away for long... As I was meditating in the mountains, what? bards don't meditate! As I was running up those mountains, my boyfriend started reminiscing about his EQ days, which got me started as well.<br><br>When I got back, eventually I logged onto EQ, to try and make my way through 52 to reach my most anticipated level - 53! It was great fun performing for my group, and again, I got lots of compliments on my play style. The next night I did my first raid with my new guild 'Evening Reign' - Naggy went down and my Group 2 got the Experience! Congrats to Erinonz for her Red Dragon Scale for her epic! If I stay at 52 for a wee bit more, maybe I'll get mine soon too!<br><br>Thanks Gaedan for popping onto Druzzil Ro to say 'Hi'! I challenged you to meet me in Naggy's lair, but I guess you aren't as Fearless as you claim to be. At least I met you in Lower Guk as a level 1 nekkid bard! :P<br><br>Its kinda funny when I log on, and everyone asks me how my vacation in the mountains was. I guess people read the news here...<br><br>Updates on the site: <br>I updated a few screenshots for your enjoyment. Because of your kind donations, I am able to re-activate this section, and not have to cringe about the bandwidth it takes. But a few screenshots, even though they were good, had to be turned down. I am only accepting bard-related screenshots.<br><br>I also updated a few song comments. Again, I learn from all you other bards, so keep the comments coming, and let me know if there's anything I need to update regarding songs/skills/etc...<br><br>I notice we have lots of new Hunting Guide strategies in. These are updated automatically so I haven't read them all, but I hope you all enjoy them.<br><br>Take care, and maybe I'll be popping in a bit more often!<br></blockquote></td></tr>
