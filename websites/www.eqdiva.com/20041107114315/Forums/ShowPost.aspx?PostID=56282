				<td colspan="2"><span>Well, I've been reading these boards a lot lately, and have seen a great deal being said in favor of improving the power of bards.  However, as we all know, the Dev giveth and the Dev taketh away, so with our improvements, will likely come a nerf.  So...why not have BARDS decide what should get nerfed?  Here's what I'd suggest to start with.
<br />

<br />
1.  Practice, practice, practice.  Being a musician in real life, I know the value of practice.  If you don't practice music, you get WORSE at it!  What I would suggest, is that, without constant practice in various instruments, we will actually LOSE skill (or recieve a temporary negative modifier).
<br />
Effect on the average player: They can't just be an afk Marr bot, and expect to be able to pacify with maxed woodwind skill because they were afk practicing 3 months ago.  I know if I tried to play a flute after 2 years (that's 36 days of EQ time), I would suck miserably.  This may encourage bards to diversify more, and actually USE some of those obscure songs.
<br />

<br />
2.  A 25% penalty on a  P/S instrument while wielding a weapon in secondary.  I know I play guitar a LOT better using two hands  <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-5.gif" border="0" alt="Wink" hspace="2" />.  
<br />

<br />
3.  Consider lowering Psalm of Veeshan effects in PVP.  I don't play on a PVP server, but from what I hear, Bards are to PVP what Amazons are to Diablo2 (cheap and overpowered).  Any PVP server bards able to confirm or deny?
<br />

<br />

<br />
I submit these suggestions, not because I hate bards, but because I love them, and would rather see us get nerfed in ways that don't totally ruin our effectiveness.  Anyone else have ideas on this subject?  Flames?  Bueller?</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>1) well then by that logic i would want melees to loose skill in their weapon skill..chances are a warriors 2hb doesnt get used much when he gets hit BoC and such...casters should loose some of their abjuration every once in a while.  In any event, i think the only instrument that would have a chance of going downis winds, even then i doubt it.  I tend to use every instrument type daily.
<br />

<br />
2) The mod on an instrument is due to its magical nature..does tha magic stop working?  What about our epic? i dont see any strings, a mouthpiece, and i doubt its hollow enough to drum with.
<br />

<br />

<br />
3) could care less, most people dont play on PvP.  EQ's PvP systems sucks, i don't understand why anyone plays it.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I think you are misunderstanding the reason people want these modifications.  The simple fact is, bards are being trivialized in certain areas.  Our melee damage output is horrid, our damage mitigation is almost non-existant, i've seen casters tank better than most bards.  Even when we can tank..we cant.  We cant hold aggro, one heal and its gone.  Our ability to boost the groups efficiency are being edged out by some the new insane gear and AA's.  Sure we can grind out lots of AA solo, IF the areas that dont have summoning mobs arent taken, but it's usually faster with a group anyway.  
<br />

<br />
Sony has done a horrible job with keeping the class defining lines from being blurred.  With each expansion, the classes are becoming more alike. Bards being the jack of all trades,  get left out.  We're tired of being left out.  We want to be brought up to the rest of EQ.  Personally i would like to see the rest of eq brought down. The numbers have gotten out of hand.  There should be no reason why items/stats/skills that exist in the old world should be considered utter trash by todays standards. </span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Surely you are not suggesting that we go all the way back to the days when a warrior dual wielding SSoY was considered uber.
<br />

<br />
The main thing that keeps me coming back to EQ (even after trying other games) is the fact that the game is constantly evolving.
<br />

<br />
To my understanding a Bard was never supposed to be a tank.  It was a role that we could fill in a pinch (and I used to in the beginnings of the game), but a Warrior, Paladin, or even a Monk or Ranger was a better tank.
<br />

				<td colspan="2"><span>Getting numbers under control does not mean we have to loose playability.  However, there does need to be a design paradigm that can keep some of this mess in check.  There could be a happy medium where things were not as weak as they were in old world, but no where near as strong as current standards.  Velious content comes to mind.  Its still good without being overly powerful.  But some of this new GoD stuff..a bracer that has more ac and stats than breastplates that were considered uber not long ago...it doesnt take a genious to follow the pattern.
<br />

<br />
tanking: your confusing should and could.  Given a better alternative the bard should not tank, however we ARE a plate class.  We should be able to tank if the situation arises, but our lack of damage mitigation and ability to hold aggro seriously hamper that.  As i said before, there are silk wears that can tank better than we can.  Silk vs plate..this physics just doesnt add up.
<br />

<br />
Bards becoming little more than a mana battery? We're barely that now.  With all the new spells and the huge amount of mana regen items, we're slowly becoming less needed.  Sure people wont mind having another 20 mana regen, but when they start regenning 100+ points a tick, and can be at full mana in  just a couple minutes anyway it becomes far less important.</span></td>

Every class has specialization skills of some sort and off hand useage to some degree -- you cannot seriously suggest that only musicians are affected by these aspects.  It would be extremely unfair to penalize bards in this way and not penalize every other class in a comparable way.

Like someone else said, PvP sucks and has never been balanced (in EQ) and is a very small percentage of the EQ players. It's hardly a priority unless you play on a PvP server.

				<td colspan="2"><span>EQ1 has gotten out of hand.   And as such we can see numbers skyrocket and things will NEVER be balanced.  h*ll, the code isn't even that great.  You see its like building a city.  If you have a good longterm plan, then you can end up with a nice organized city.  But if you just kinda throw things everywhere all haphazard like, then you will end up will a confusing mess of mixed up crap that doesn't work as well as it should.  Unfortunetly, EQ1 is the mixed-up-to-h*ll kind of city.  It wasn't very thought-out from the start and adding so many unplanned-for expansions only added to the wackiness.  I liked the simpleness of original EQ and Kunark (which was a pretty interesting place), SoV was O.K. in this aspect.  
<br />

<br />
Here's some examples of bad planning.  Advantages of twinking (or just getting strong items cheaply)?  None.  Because devs made new content assuming twink stuff, making non-twinks to suck.  Haste?  Nope no advantage there.  It has been said that encounters were developed assuming PCs would have best haste available to them.  So you see.. really your &quot;advantages&quot; make you about square.  That's not to say extreme twinking isn't overpowering and any twinking is nice in the old content areas.  
<br />

<br />
Ok back to the point....I love new content.  New things to explore, do, kill, and quest.  But it should all complement the game that is already there, not alienate it.  
<br />

<br />

				<td colspan="2"><span>No game, no matter how hard any designer tries is ever &quot;balanced&quot;.  If a game were &quot;balanced&quot; then it would be absolutely boring, because every class would be able to succeed at every task without the benifit of any other different class.  That is absolutely not the case.
<br />

<br />
I tried a game that was designed using the &quot;different but equal&quot; philosophy.  Classes were balanced, but unfortunately they were all basically the same, and all basically boring.  You may have heard of it, it was &quot;Horizons&quot;.
<br />

<br />
I also tried a game that was designed so that the classes were pretty much mutually supporting, absolutely dependent on one another for survival.  A great feature of this game was also its &quot;ease of play&quot;.  Unfortunately &quot;ease of play&quot; means that the game is not even challenging for my 10 year old, which definately removes the fun after about a week.  Though visually stunning, being blinded by beauty only lasts so long.  You may have heard of it, it was &quot;City of Heroes&quot;.
<br />

<br />
I tried a game that was focused on item decay and evolving player driven storyline.  This game was interesting enough to hold my attention for a good long time, because the classes worked very well with each other, but every class was able to play on their own as well.  The classes were very unbalanced however, and the prime hunting areas were very log jammed, and overall the game world was quite small.  Item decay was very expensive, and quite a bit of time was spent on keeping gear in tip top shape, becuase to do well in the game it had to be.  Unfortunately this game was run by a company that accepts nothing less than market domination in its games, and just when a major retail expansion could have been used to expand the game, fix alot of problems and advance the storyline, it was dumped.  You may have heard of it, it was &quot;Earth and Beyond&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Plain fact is that many games have tried to do things &quot;better&quot; than EQ.  To correct all of these &quot;problems&quot; that you have highlighted.  None of them are doing particularly well, and none of them have advanced beyond the &quot;niche&quot; market.  EQ provides a diverse environment, but changing its basic substance to &quot;balance&quot; the classes should not be a priority.  Beyond all other games what EQ is really about is the people, not the gear.</span></td>

I didn't make  this post to be a sensationalist.  I made it, because I thought bards might enjoy an opportunity to see things from a different perspective -- thereby balancing themselves.  Apparently, all are content to leave well enough alone, and allow people with no earthly grasp of music or barding to dictate their class.
<br />

<br />
My first point was not meant to be exclusive to bards, necessarily.  I agree that melee, and caster skills could also decay.  Annoying?  Yes.  Realistic?  A bit.  OMG!  (reaches for his troll-bat)
<br />

<br />
After having played Diablo 2 for a very long time, and seeing what the developers did to improve the game, I noticed the following:
<br />

<br />
1.  Rather than improving monster AI, they would increase hit points.
<br />

<br />
2.  Rather than allowing a sliding scale for things like magic find, they would instigate a hard cap (or a cap with such diminishing returns, as to make it rediculous).
<br />

<br />
3.  Rather than having customer service, they chose a complete &quot;hands-off&quot; policy.  
<br />

<br />
This third was the greatest shock to me when I came to EQ.  Wow, there are GMs, and you can SEE them!  It is apparent to me, that due to the large amount of money that EQ generates, SOE is interested in keeping its customers.  With all of the improvements that have been demanded, and asked for nicely for bards, it seemed sensible to me to make some concessions in return.  I don't think we're underpowered.  I don't think we're greatly overpowered either, but if half of the changes proposed go live, we may well be, and be dealt a crippling blow with the dreaded nerf-bat.
<br />

<br />
If you don't agree, that is certainly your right.  Perhaps now you at least understand the reason.</span></td>

IMO, it would be better to prepare the classes to the new content being thrown at us (GoD and OOW comes to mind), so that forming a KT group or GoD Trial doesn take hours because you need this and that class before you can even start. That way, the new content can even be enjoyable by everyone.

				<td colspan="2"><span>The basic thesis seems to be that Nerfing is inevitable, so perhaps we should pick out some nice Nerfs for ourselves.  The premise does not work for me.  Any hits with the Nerf Bat of Doom will happen no matter what we might suggest.

<br />
As for the ideas...
<br />

<br />
Skill decay:  What would that do in the game exactly?  Increase downtime is all.  Instead of being out playing the game, you would have to sit and train.  Would it encourage the use of alternate songs?  No.  You use the right tool for the right job.  Trying to use second best is just going to make you ineffective.
<br />

<br />
I must also note that this would not do a *thing* to Nerf the class.  It would just create a nuisance.  I submit that adding things to make the game less fun is a bad idea.
<br />

<br />
Lowering our effectiveness when holding a weapon and an instrument:  What would this do in game?  Make the benefit of Primary Hand instruments irrelevant.  It would also drive the price up on items that have an instrument mod, since it would make actually using an instrument even *less* attractive than it already is.

My take on things is sketchy at best, to be honest.  It seems to me like making characters higher maintenance would be pretty detrimental to most people's enjoyment of the game.  Even if you see it as more realistic, or interesting, I see it as a Pain in the a$ that I wouldn't want to deal with.  But really, I think it could be funny.  So here I go!
<br />

<br />
You want realistic?  Here's EQ gone real...  Give everyone a gun cause swords just suck.  Mobs don't respawn; once you kill em, they're dead for good.  Bards?  Don't get me started on them.  The last time I tried Chords of Dissonance on my guitar, the guy in the room next to mine just got pissed off and told me to turn my amplifier down.  So bards are useless now.  No more magic, no more rezzing the dead, etc etc.  So really the only thing you can do is go around killing things with your gun.  Since mobs in the real world don't respawn, there's not gonna be many of them left at the rate that they're hunted.  So you're not going to have any good targets.  No targets, no money.  Well, at least there's tradeskills to make money from, right?  Let's choose brewing, that's a good one.  Except you're nobody but some poor hunter with no targets, so you've got no market appeal on your beverages.  So what do you do? Get drunk.  Since you have no money, you'll be living with your parents.  So you'll stumble in at 4am, after brewing for hours, selling nothing in the bazaar, then drinking yourself stupid, while your parents are sitting there waiting for you, screaming &quot;Why couldn't you have gone to Erudin and studied!?  Look at yourself!  You could have been a researcher for crying out loud!&quot;  Then you'll pass out and wake up at about 2pm in a liquid you don't want to identify.  Of course, you'll have some horrible hangover so all your skills will be impaired for when you go hunting next weekend for targets that probably won't be there.  You'll probably shoot off a finger (or at least put a hole in your foot) when you mistake a friend sneaking around in the dark of blackburrow for a gnoll and try to score it big.  Then you'll somehow stagger back home and call for a healer.  But since magic has gone bye bye, and magic is all that clerics know, you'll probably call for someone who knows how to bandage instead.  Who better to bind wound than a monk or warrior?  Then one day, your life seriously changes.  A big hunter's guild invites you to a raid.  Raid style is a little different now.  Just think of an advancing army or something.  Anyway, they decide they're gonna go after a god.  They're not happy with their diety anymore, and they need all the manpower they can get.  So you strap on your kevlar helmet, grab your trusty shotgun, and head out with your buddies.  Now magic may be dead, but gods are still gods.  They're going to be omnipotent.  So your advancing army is going to start firing, and Mithaniel Marr is just gonna look at you and say &quot;Aw crap, here we go again.  Stupid people.&quot;  Then you would all die in a huge fiery blast.  Is this the kind of game you want?  Cause it's actually starting to sound like fun now that I think about it.
