<br />
Yelhun's Mystic Call is the same as Call of the Muse (30% overhaste, 15% to DD and DoT focus) and it adds full spell focus effects up to level 70.
<br />

<br />
Eriki's Psalm of Power is the same as Echo of the Trusik (30% overhaste, 25% to DD and DoT focus) and it adds full spell focus effects up to level 70.
<br />

<br />
Ancient Call of Power (30% overhaste, 30% DD and DoT focus) is an upgrade to anything we get as it adds 5% more to the current best bard focus song (Echo of the Trusik).
<br />

<br />

<br />
Maybe you don't see adding 5 more levels of focus effects as being an upgrade? What about a wizard with an Improved Damage-I item? Should he keep that item threw his life? It stops working eventually and he must get ID-II, then ID-III, then ID-IV, and now some kind of ID-V item.
<br />

Bard songs are just the same. We will have to upgrade to our new Improved Focus songs as we level. Big deal.</span></td>

However, new skills/songs/spells are what people expect with expansions.  Getting a new song that merely does what old songs do, but does it for 5 more levels is merely maintaining status quo for the new expansion.  It's not adding something.  It would be no different than modifying existing songs to handle the new levels.

if i understand it well, our muse song does nothing for any spell lvl 66 + or am i wrong? (i do hope so)

<br />
This raises another question in my mind, does a lvl 70 rogue get the 30 % uber haste from Muse?
<br />

<br />
I could live with it if the effect of the muse song would scale down with other foci effects, eventhough principally i think a song is a spell, and not a foci

Our focus line of songs are just another focus. Mages, clerics, bards all must upgrade. (Berzerkers too I think, not sure tho). So why the big deal?

SOE didn't start retireing our spells for upgrades untill they started running out of effects to give us.
<br />

<br />
Bards were supposed to get effects that lasted the lifetime of the bard, and got better with age.  Unfortuneately the short-sightedness of the developers caused them to change how we were handled rather then actually fixing anything (I need a new charm rather then making the old one not work on anything +5 levels from my current?  That was the one that started it and still to this day were stuck)
<br />

<br />
My spells are supposed to grow in power as I do, not get weaker.  If the fools at SOE could just hammer out some decent equations and allow things to progress at a decent rate they wouldn't have to hack around everytime they wanted to add something new.</span></td>

<br />

<br />
I have to beg a humble difference to this quote, I am from a different end of the spectrum. Because my lowly (main)  character is 51 bard after 3 off and on years of gameplay, and because my &quot;alt&quot; is only a (barely) 32 SK I must differ with this, I have never noticed the effects of a &quot;nerf&quot; of either class.  Then again, since I do not play just EQ it is a little easier to come back and just have fun. I am also not a raid bard and have full sympathy if the PL group has hurt your experience.
<br />

<br />
  I am pretty sure this last change of AE was not the first change in the Bard class before my return some months ago, but feel free to educate me as needed.
<br />

<br />
I sat and watched a group of 3 LB and one yellow (to me as a 51 bard) last night. They pulled, one at a time, a mob LB to me. For a very long time they pulled, many were green to me. 
<br />

<br />
   Good thing the Devs at some point saw my mana as a problem long before I was aware of it. That group would have had nothing to hunt if I had been a jerk with or without the mana. 
<br />

<br />
   When my mana was back to speed I went and killed I do not know how my DB in record time, not even using that particular groups time reference. 
<br />

<br />
I have noticed the mobs with the swarm kite procedure in other zones. I have also seen bards AE well more than 30. I personally think both are an exploit of the AI system. 
<br />

<br />
    Neither nerf would affect a hack like me, but both have the potential of ruining the best character I have ever played in any game I have seen, a Bard in Norrath.
<br />

<br />
Ever play a skald in DAoC? Tis the same as a bard, but they cannot run when it gets to hot. In fact, a mob can stop your song, and make it impossible to run again. Bards be aware, there are worse things than not allowing the type of play being discussed lately.
<br />

<br />
    I suggest Dungeon Siege for any that wish to be GoD. Set it at easy and you can take a hundred without even the adreniline rush, Good Hunting to you, I found the game amusing for a time.

   My point would be that I already think Bards are overpowered compared to the one other class I play, a 32 Human SK. And I am afraid they will take away the very reason I chose a bard to begin with so many years ago. The Devs made it clear in the beginning the game they were trying to create and because they did such a fabulous job I stand next to them. Care to join me or fight me? Personally, I do not care. At the moment, I am a Bard and do not need you anyway<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />

<br />
Which is true, but didn't we already do that? From lvl 60 to lvl 65 and for lower level bards they even add rizlona line in ldon. Why do we have to do it again? its kinda lame to do the same thing again and TWICE in a row (2 focus songs 1 level apart). I know what you are saying, its an upgrade no agruement there. But my view is *is this how I want to progress?*
<br />

<br />
Is this how you want to progress? getting new focus songs and which are, I might add, are NO different AND worse then the original. And do them again and again and again etc etc etc.
<br />

<br />
I am glad I didn't level from ldon rizlona, but if I did... i would be even less amused by this.
<br />

<br />
Oh and btw Brialla I appreciate your comments but it has nothing to do with this focus songs or anything here ... if you want to talk about how overpowered bards are you are more then welcome to start another post.</span></td>

   I am sorry, but I do believe what I am saying is relevant to this argument due to the very nature of the bard.
<br />

<br />
    We have 2 things that no other class has, a low use of mana given the correct twist of songs, and we can move at any time. Combined with charm this is a deadly skill available to no other class in any game I have seen so far. 
<br />

<br />
   Given the seemingly endless ways of combining bard skills and songs, I am not surprised that it is hard to give this class new effects. An imaginative use of the songs already given opened at least one new door, as the AE bards discovered. I am assuming the swarm kiters will find the same thing in time if it is abused.
<br />

<br />
   I am worried that some will get what they wish for, better and more powerful songs that will also be easily abused. And in return we will sacrifice our mobility, the one and only thing that continues to bring me back to my Bard. Mobility has had a precedent started this very week, and it seems to me it is a natural progression independant of the forsight of a Dev, who by the way, is not God. But dang they made a blast of a game<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />.

I mean wow... first of you are talking about things that isn't even happening yet. I am sorry me and the other people here like to talk about real facts and form opinions around that fact. I am sorry that we are not fortune tellers that can see the future and realize we will abuse things before it even happens.

Hey Brialla I don't know what kind of crack you are on. But if you want a make some kind of argument here you might want to be specific about &quot;why&quot; our focus songs makes us overpowered. Show some numbers, give some facts. No one likes a village idiot dancing around saying things that he can't proved.
<br />

<br />
I already said in my post i appreciate your comment, seeing as how you are only 51 I definiately can see where you are coming from, I understand every bit of why you would say something like this. However, you can't see pass your level and try to understand how we higher levels operate. I am not saying you are inconsiderate no, I am saying you won't lift a finger to read the stuff we have to go through.

Brialla uses drugs... it's the only way I can explain someone playing a class to 35% and another class to 10% could think they have enough experience to make informed opinions.  90% of EQ is after 55...

Brialla, you realize a SK is a Knight class right?  Your DPS sucks, and most of your spells revolve around agro generation.  In the end game you will stand and get beat on... that is your job.  And you will take that beating in a way that bards can't.  Will you then say &quot;OMGzorz! My SK is so overpowered compared to my bard cause he doesn't take teh damage like a gnome wizard!&quot;?

If they ever took selos, or made bards stand still to cast they would have to put the Devs in witness protection cause that would seriously piss a lot of people off.
<br />

<br />
And just an FYI, it makes it harder for Devs to make drastic changes to our class when there aren't people who have only dabbled in the class, hanging on the sidelines cheerleading for the nerfs.
<br />

<br />
===========================================
<br />

<br />
As for our focus songs:
<br />

<br />
This is a chart of how much they will focus different spells based on their levels:
<br />

<br />
lvl*******65****66*****67***68*****69*****70
<br />
Muse*****15%**13.5%**12%**10.5%**9%****7.5%
<br />
Echo*****25%**22.5%**20%**17.5%**15%***12.5%
<br />
Yelhun****25%**25%***25%**25%****22.5%**20%
<br />
Eriki******25%**25%***25%**25%****25%***22.5%
<br />
Ancient***30%**30%***30%**30%****30%***30%
<br />

<br />

<br />
This is like if a Wizard was lvl 8, and had a nuke that did 100 damage.  Then at 9 that nuke did 90 damage, then at 10 it did 80 damage, then at 11 did 70 damage, and then at 12 did 60 damage.... and then if that wizard got his lvl 12 upgrade spell in the same line it would do 100 damage again.  It's BS plain and simple.
<br />

<br />
Focus songs cannot be &quot;overpowered&quot; Brialla... exactly how do you propose that a bard use his focus song to be super powerful?  The uba supa overhaste?  The focus that doesn't focus any of our songs?  No, these songs are only useful when grouped.  As a matter of fact, if a bard wants to put out the best melee DPS it involves getting a few of the right items, the right AAs, and not being hasted in anyway... tell me when you are high enough to figure it out... AKA a bard would decrease his power by using this song while melee'ing solo.
<br />

<br />
If they made bard focus a seperate type of focus, that didn't scale down as it was applied to spells higher than the lvl of the song, our 68 and 69 songs would be exact duplicates of our 64 and 65 songs.  They changed focus in a way that nerfed us, and then told us we could regain the utility we had already possessed, if we just farmed some spells in their new expansion.
<br />

<br />
Bard focus should not scale down.  It should not be stacking, it should apply after all other focus effects are applied.  Our focus songs should see a steady increase in power as we progress, just like every other smurfing class in the game.
<br />

<br />
As for the one song/one skill crowd, it is NEVER going to happen.  Don't hold onto that impossible ideal, and not try and improve the line as it stands now.
<br />

<br />
I have made a proposal that I believe it a reasonable compromise between the system of upgrades SOE has decided to give us... please visit it and support/comment.

				<td colspan="2"><span>&quot;Maybe you don't see adding 5 more levels of focus effects as being an upgrade? What about a wizard with an Improved Damage-I item? Should he keep that item threw his life? It stops working eventually and he must get ID-II, then ID-III, then ID-IV, and now some kind of ID-V item. &quot;
<br />

<br />
That's silly!  It's a  more appropriate analogy to wonder how wizards would feel if their Blasts did 100% damage at 65, then 90% at 66, ... to 50% at 70. Using the same, ancient blast that they spent dozens of hours trying to get. 
<br />

<br />
Musiques has it exactly right.  This is an indirect nerf.  They give us EXACTLY the same songs, and stick in one ancient version that is a miniscule upgrade. I'm absolutely stunned that they did this.  
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hey, I know, instead of giving bards new overhaste songs, let's just give 'em exactly the same ones again!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;What?  That's crazy, they'll never go for it!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Sure they will. We'll just limit what levels the old songs work on.  That way, since we've decreased their power, they'll feel like they're getting an upgrade again.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Woot!  Yer a genius!&quot;

<br />
I can't believe I have to spend hundreds of hours trying to get spells that I already have!  It's very frustrating.

<br />
What would clerics say if complete heal only healed for 3750 on level 70s?  Or Shammies if Ferine Avatar only added 50 atk on level 70s?  Or if Rangers had their tunare and  predator lines add half?  Or if Protection of the Nines only gave 4 mana regen at level 70?  Don't think it would be 'woot, we get an upgrade back to where we were!

<br />
</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
But they don't gain power.  In fact they DECREASE in power as they go above level 65.  If they were to maintain power at an even level, they would continue to effect the spells all they way up.
<br />

<br />
IF you look at all the songs up to level 50 and even most of the ones up through level 60, each one is significantly different.  Why? because they do scale.  The only ones that don't scale are the hastes and the slows. And even those do scale, just not enought to keep up with the curve.  Compare this to the caster classes.  I will use the nukes because that is the most easy to show it.  Level 16 Wizard gets a new nuke. and it does 102 points of damage.  By the time he reaches level 20 (his next spell level) that same nuke is only doing 110 points of damage.  In essence, it hasn't changed a lot in power.  Now, take a level 65 wizard that casts that same nuke.  Baring the addition of focus effects and crits, how much damage does that nuke do?  110 points of damage.
<br />

<br />
We bards, on the other hand get a dot at 18 that does 18 points of damage per tick, without an instrument.  After 4 levels it does 20 points of damage per tick.  No prob.  Roughly the same percent of increase in power over 4 levels.  BUT a level 60 bard (sorry dont' have level 65 info) sings that same song and how much damage does it do?  It does 39 points per tick.  It continues to improve the whole life of the bard. 
<br />

<br />
Same for Mez, mostly. Same for charm... we have 3 charms that last 4/5 of our career!
<br />

<br />
But lately they have mved us over to the Caster model for some unexplained reason. Every song released since PoP came out is based on the caster's model.  You get a spell that is good for a limited duration, then you get an upgrade.  Now, I am trying to be nice here, but it Looks like they don't want to add in new effects to the game and don't want to add in new abilities to classes, but they want us to feel that we are getting new toys to play with.   Ergo, they really only give us one new spell, and cut it into sectons so that we are happy when we get the &quot;upgrade&quot;.  That is what we are missing in our new songs, and what the original post was about.
<br />

<br />
Personally, I don't expect us to ever get any new abilities.  It seems that sony isn't thinking about breadth of ability but in terms of roles.  They have only 4 roles in mind for us, puller, Mezer, Overhaste/spell haste, and Damage shield.  Sure, we can still do a lot of things, but look at the new spells...what are we doing?  these are the same songs that I have been singing for about 10 levels already.  If I wanted that, I would have made a Druid or a Wizard.  I wanted variety, I want to enter a group and have to debate over what is the best set songs to sing!
<br />

<br />

<br />
/sigh  What I really want is an honest, and direct explanation why they chose to switch us from songs that last a lifetime to the caster model where you upgrade every few levels.
