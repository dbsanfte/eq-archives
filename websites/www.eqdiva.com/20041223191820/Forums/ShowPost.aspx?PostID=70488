				<td colspan="2"><span>The Nameless is down noticeably too, but I think it started to wane even before &quot;black Tuesday&quot;.   There may be a lot of factors there (not in any particular order):
<br />

<br />
1) People are just getting tired of EQ and ready to move on to other things, not necessarily computers games.
<br />

<br />
2) People were preparing to move to another game, selling their characters and gear.
<br />

<br />
3) People pissed off by the &quot;nerfs&quot; in OoW.  As far as game content goes, it was a good release, but I think the spells, at least for bards and rangers, were way less than good.  They are weak and boring, not to mention removing some abilities for rangers (which Sony is finally agreeing to address).  The AA's weren't interesting either.  So for spells and AA's this release clearly states, &quot;we're out of ideas&quot;
<br />

<br />
4) Epic h*ll.  Epic 1.5, and 2.0 farming has been brutal to guilds.  A lot of people don't even want to log on because of the constant begging for epic groups, or will log prematurely if an epic raid is called.

<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">It's really very simple. EQ 1 is dying under the weight of poor management. Things like holding player conferences and agreeing to make improvements then going stonewall once the new expansion comes out, prioritizing nerfs over new features, releasing new software that is so badly bugged that it practically makes the game unplayable, then not fixing it for months.
<br />
 
<br />
I've said it before, and I'll say it again. SoE has shot themselves in the foot. No, it's worse than that. They've shot themselves in the head. Once upon a time they were the market leaders in the online gaming space. Everquest was revolutionary, and the momentum they got from being the first out of the gate was tremendous. Over the past year, through ridiculous mismanagement, they've pissed it all away. The people are out there...the market is ripe. The fact that Blizzard was able to sign up over 500,000 people for their beta test is clear proof of this. Why aren't those people coming to EQ 1, or EQ 2? Because they've already been to an SoE party, and they don't relish going to another one.
<br />
 
<br />
From November 23rd, Blizzard is going to take over this space with their new offering, WoW. It won't be long after that that the people who have left for EQ 2 migrate there as well. In the meantime, EQ 1 servers will likely be consolidated, and then consolidated again in a vain effort to keep player populations high as people steadily give up the ghost and move on to greener pastures.
<br />
 
<br />
I'm glad now that I resisted the temptation to buy the OoW expansion. The feedback for it has been miserable, and with the player populations declining as fast as they have, its clear that I wouldn't have been playing long anyway. 
<br />
 
<br />
SoE, if you're listening, you did this to yourselves. Maybe if you had listened to your players, focused more on making the game FUN, rather than just time consuming, things might have been different. Maybe instead of nerfing everyone to death, if you had addressed balance problems by INCREASING the capabilities of other characters, things might have been different. Maybe if you had focused more on keeping your software release quality standards high, rather than dumping out new stat-inflating expansions all the time things might have been different. At the end of the day the players are paying for entertainment. Piss them off, as you have done so zealously this past year, and they will go away.

That, perhaps, is the problem we should be working on, rather than insulting the designers and developers on these forums. Lets try to maintain a productive and positive attitude here, it really does go a long way towards good communication.
<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
I have to say, this statement floored me. How can people maintain a productive and positive attitude when you guys release crap quality software and take months to fix it? How can we be nice when you castrate our characters, comprising months and years of our effort, in the name of a new release that actually DOWNGRADEs our usefulness? How can we be gracious when you promise us that you're going to listen to us, and deliver on our well-considered requests, then go off and hide for six months while delivering nothing? And remember, we're all paying for the privilege of being treated this way. Just exactly who do you think you are that you should be treated with respect and dignity when you so clearly do not return the favor?
<br />

<br />
What is needed is for you to pay attention to your PAYING player community. You are getting abuse because your customer service sucks. Instead of rubbing your bruised egos and whining that we should be nicer to you, you should be listening to what these players are saying. The sooner you do this, the sooner you will soothe the ruffled feathers and stop the slide you are now in. Remember Wordperfect? Novell? Lotus 1-2-3? They were market leaders, innovators in their time, like you. All of them dropped the ball and allowed their groundbreaking advantage to be overcome. You're well on your way to becoming the big story of the MMORPG world...how SoE lost their edge and slid into bankrupt oblivion. To quote (and bastardize) a popular line from Clinton's first campaign, &quot;It's the CUSTOMER, stupid&quot;!
<br />

<br />
What does it take to get through to you people? You don't have a government job. The money that you're making comes from us, your CUSTOMERS. You're not selling packaged consumer goods either. With your business model, you interact with the customer for hours a day, every day of the week. You need to be top notch at managing those customer relationships. 
<br />

<br />
The first steps you need to take, in my opinion, are:
<br />

<br />
- Drop the &quot;we're doing you a favor here&quot; attitude. We're the ones doing you a favor by paying for your game, even when it doesnt actually work.
<br />

<br />
- Get off your heinies and give us answers to our top ten list. Then do something about them. Like NOW.
<br />

<br />
- Stop indescriminately nerfing things. Find another way to solve balance problems, like, say, improving the capabilities of other classes, or reworking the content thats causing problems.
<br />

<br />
- And finally, fire whoever it was who got you into this mess. Someone is responsible for the crappy quality of releases. Someone is responsible for managing customer relations. Someone is responsible for designing content that requires nerfs to be made. Fire these people and get new ones who will do their jobs properly.

my server boards. And to fill you in, Kane Bayle is one of the least populated servers. Pretty much all progressing guilds folded with the lack of people to recruit from and there are just 2 guilds left. Evolutia and Midwinter (being US and Euro in that order). Nowadays theres even less people. I'm guessing, probably around 300-500 active people of all levels. Bout 100 traders in the baz and from this the market is crap, nothing to choose from and everything is such low prices cause nobody has money or Gear to sell for high. Saturday morning (the highest concentration of people on for us) the most people in pok is 45. Tranq is dead with nobody in it. Wos might have 1 or 2 groups same with mpg and thats about it. 
<br />

<br />
Anyways, this is one of our server reps and to get this kinda of bs from sony is really.... just atricious. How to blindly ignore a problem that plagues the server to only fill their wallets more with transfer money is real disgusting. If it wasn't for the guild im apping to actually making things fun again for me, i probably would of quit as with the other 50 people. Dwindling the population even lower.

I'd post this on the eqlive boards, but of course, this will be nazi'd so.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Hey Adem.  I'm also on KB, and agree that if sony doesn't allow for free consolodation, they are going to lose even more revenue.  It's getting really hard to keep things together.  There are basically two guilds that raid on the server - Evolutia (US time) and my guild, Midwinter (Euro time).  Considering that KB  is one of the two or so servers listed as <i>European</i>, I'm shocked.  Good news is that I can duo north wall pretty often with my cleric....gee that's fun, playing with myself...
<br />

<br />
As it is now, with half the guild disappearing, I'm forced to clean up the roster and recruit massively, probably setting us back a ways in progression.

I think KB is the lowest pop server, but, well, I have deep roots, so won't transfer unless I have absolutely no other option.</span></td>

You must be new around here...
<br />

<br />
Joking aside, I can see this happening, but just not quiet yet.  No doubt they'll be watching to see how the trickle rate BACK from the other games (it's going to happen, just no-one knows how much/how quick).  
<br />
I play on AB, and Black Tuesday decimated the uber guilds on our server, LOTS of merges happened quickly to keep momentum going but it wasn't perfect for alot of people.  Our guild didn't get hit as bad as we thought, I can only think that we're so close to alot of stuff (very close to EP, just taken down emp and about to enter VT) that alot of people are still getting alot out of the game and are looking forward to seeing lots of new stuff.  Nonetheless, recruitment is always an ongoing thing and to alleviate the pain for both us and other guilds, we're doing alot of raiding alliances to see how it plays out. So far, it's working well.
<br />
Here's to 5 more years of gaming, no matter what world you choose to play in.

Thursday we wanted to do LMM but Iceni beat us to it, and

Saturday while we're in RCity doing the sharpshooters, SR zones

in and crashes the zone because there's too many people.

am really enjoying a lot of the quests it has to offer; it reminds me

Has anyone found Guttertusk the Cruel btw?  I've done both the

revenge on the ikaavs and the revenge on the kyv quests, hoping
<br />
to do the third one but I haven't found the little bastard yet.

If you're not EP geared I would really work on my loyalist faction
<br />
to get the arms.  It's got a decent string mod and cleave I on it.

The ring for revenge on the kyv was just made for bards, as well
<br />
as the zone-wide ultra rare ring from RCity.

I think it'd be more fun if we had more discussion on those things

				<td colspan="2"><span>Well I think there's a lot of talk going around about a lot of things. I agree that SoE dropped the ball, that much is true. However, there's a helluvalot more to it than that. Far and away, EQ has been the most pleasureable gaming experience I've ever had. I can't think of another game I played even HALF as long (4 years ain't beans). With that said, it's also important to note that after 4 years it's just not the same for a whole lot of reasons. Now I don't need to get poetic or preachy here, but there are two major reasons I don't play anymore. 
<br />

<br />
-Slowly, very slowly, EQ forced the casual player out. I'm sorry but I don't have 6-12 hours a day anymore for EQ. I'm not going to waste your time listing all the reasons why this is the case but anyone who's gone from 8 or more hours a day to less than 2 knows the difference. It's very difficult to have a rewarding game experience in EQ when you have an hour or less. 
<br />

<br />
-Bad management as detailed above. I can't agree with this more. You can smell bad management from miles away, usually in the form of good ideas gone horribly wrong somewhere in the implementation process. I've seen companys with millions in potential profit drop it all at the finish line and crash like a 747 because of bad management, usually during development. You can tell these kind of people straight to thier face that they're going down the tubes and all they'll do is put a knife in your back because you bruised thier ego, these are not the right type of leaders but they get hired anyways. 
<br />

<br />
No point in rambling more I'm just going to get carried away. I'm not going to bother with EQ2, I'm sorry but it's not happening. It's a d*mn shame too because a lot of my very good EQ friends are moving to EQ2 but I am most defenitely into WoW now. I'm not here to convice you to give up EQ but I'll defenitely tell you that WoW is amazing for my needs and I haven't enjoyed a game this much since I started EQ over 4 years ago. I'm thoroughly impressed, so good for me!
