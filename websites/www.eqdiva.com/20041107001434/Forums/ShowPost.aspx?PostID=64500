<br />
I know that bards can do many things (more than any other class).  I also know that they are restricted on how many things they can do at once (up to 4 twisting songs I hear).  I know that bards make great pullers.  I know that they used to be great solo, but not sure how they are now.  I also know that I rarely see a bard lfg.  Casting Mez and other spells while running sounds awfully nice as well.  I also can imagine that twisting songs constantly is a pain.
<br />

<br />
So with that in mind, I have some questions
<br />

<br />
What is the downside to bards?  What are the limitations that you constantly run into, and wish you were as good as other classes?
<br />
Besides what I listed above, what are your upside?  Do you get invited to be the slower of groups?  Do you fulfill roles other than puller in group?
<br />
Can you effectively solo after the AE nerf?
<br />
Can you macro your twisting, or do you have to hit hotkeys for each spell each time that you twist?
<br />
Any advice for a new bard?
<br />

<br />
Thank you in advance for any advice that you can give me!</span></td>

<br />

<br />
QED there are no cons.  Apart from carpal tunnel syndrome.  And the lull/mez/charm hole in the 50's.
<br />

<br />
Some bard songs last longer, so we can twist more than 4 but you need to be some kind of idiot savant to do it.  Twisting 4 reliably, with no dropouts, is the mark of a good bard, imho.
<br />

<br />
We can solo very well without AoE.  Swarming is possible well into the 60's.
<br />

<br />
There's macroing and then there's Macroing...  One is legit and one is not.  It is the Macroing that dare not speak it's name...
<br />

<br />
We can haste, overhaste, slow, DoT, DS, buff resists, Dex, AC, all sorts - have a quick perusal of teh song list on the left there...
<br />

<br />
My advice for a new bard is put all your points into Stamina.  The rest is covered by the guides here.  But learn to twist as soon as you can, and then learn to swarm as soon as you can... prolly not possible at 27 anymore.  The longer charms, DoTs and a good drum make it a bit easier later on.
<br />

<br />
The real secret to being a good bard isn't in the technique - it's in the creativity of the individual player who knows his or her class.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Well I am a level 67 bard with 370ish AA in an elemental guild struggling to get into PoTime at the moment. Here is my take on your questions:
<br />

<br />
<b>Bard Downsides/Limitations</b>
<br />

<br />
DPS DPS DPS. We can't put out much DPS. Twisting all the time can make your hands sore and can be boring at times too. Nothing we do lasts very long. So our &quot;tash&quot; (HOS) lasts only three ticks. Although we are a plate class, we don't tank very well. Even if we have the HP and AC to tank in some limited circumstances, we can't hold aggro.
<br />

<br />
<b>Bard Upsides</b>:
<br />

<br />
I do notice that bards are not as much in demand as they once were, but I can't back that up with any data. Some folks think that we are still much in demand. I find that I am wanted in most groups except where they need another DPS toon.
<br />

<br />
Yes, I am often the only slower in a group (PoEarth, BOT, GOD, PoFire). It works pretty well until you get to some crazy GOD or Proving Ground mobs. Remember that bard slow is VERY low aggro and we can land it on a mob when we are bringing it back to camp or if I am not the puller just as it arrives in camp. That fact coupled with being able to add another DPS toon in place of a slower means bard slow is pretty viable in most situations.
<br />

<br />
It is quite fun to play a bard. We can do some pretty crazy things given DA, Fade and being able to cast on the run. In some situations I think bards are better at CC than chanters because we can run and cast and take more hits. Just remember that our mez doesn't last long so we have to keep refreshing it.
<br />

<br />
<b>SOLOING ABILITIES </b> 
<br />

<br />
Bards are traditionally one of the top solo classes. This may be changing from levels 65 to 70, but I don't know yet if that is true. The new charm (level 70) may restore some ability to solo and get decent experience. I can still get decent experience in PON swarming hobgoblins with higher level mobs, but I don't expect that to last when I advance another level.
<br />

<br />
If mobs don't summon, we do have a unique ability to kill most mobs solo. But this may get you some nice loot, but won't get you fast experience.
<br />

<br />
<b>MACRO TWISTING</b>
<br />

<br />
You really can't do it. It won't work unless you are talking abotu a Nostromo Game pad. You can make a key that is :
<br />

<br />
/stop song
<br />
/cast 1
<br />

<br />
and do this for all the songs you will twist. That will cut your key strokes in half. Realistically, you can twist at most four songs. When twisting four songs, it is not possible to avoid one song from dropping from time to time due to server tick, lag and missed notes issues. 
<br />

<br />
<b>STATS FOR A STARTING BARD</b>
<br />

<br />
I know a lot of folks disagree, but I think the best stats to put your points into are DEX and CHARISMA. At the early levels, you will wish you had put the points into stamina for the added HP, but if you can afford decent HP gear this really shouldn't be much of an issue. As you level up, I found that stamina and strength were trivial to rais compared to other stats. Most parses show that charisma (and dex to a lesser extent I think) materially influence the number of your missed notes.  Plus charisma can be harder to max out than other stats. I think that the measure of a bard's power is how many songs (buffs) he can keep on his group or raid. Fewer missed notes means you can keep more songs up longer. More dex and charisma means fewer missed notes. 
<br />

<br />
Anyway I put all my points into dex and charisma and I have never regretted that decision.
<br />

				<td colspan="2"><span>I agree, but I just wanted to put a few words in edge-wise. 
<br />
The biggest limits on bards don't come from the developers, they come from the folks who play them. The hardest part about being a bard is knowing what to do and when to do it. The routine changes all the time, every group is different and as soon as the group make-up changes, so does your play style. Most bards try to fill in the gaps and would say that is what we're best at, I agree with this somewhat but I argue that a lot of people limit themselves in what they can accomplish, some due to laziness, others due to simply being misinformed. The more you know about <u>all</u> the classes, the better you will do as a bard. The challenge comes in chosing which abilities to augment for the group, which ones to save for important situations (IE Deftdance, FM, DA Song) and which ones to not bother memming because you will constantly be faced with the choice of one song over the other and we all know that hindsight is never 20/20. There are a lot of choices and no matter how hard people try to say &quot;all I do is pull&quot; or &quot;all I do is play mana song&quot; it's just a matter of perspective, if you accept that and limit yourself to it, that's all you're going to be doing. In reality, you're going to experience more variation as a bard than as any other class, forget the fact that we might not be able to do everything as well as everyone else, the only thing that matters is that we <u>can</u> and it's so much fun. 
<br />
Try it you won't regret it. You're going to level from 1-55 very fast but then everything changes, lull and mezz caps start getting to be a real pain, little details like that start forcing you to get very crafty when you pull, especially in LDoNs, or forgo pulling all together in places like PoV until you get to 61. You'll have fun no matter what, just expect some big changes along the way, your role and powers will be constantly shifting as you level.
<br />
The only real way to cover everything is to try it, which I wholeheartedly reccommend, especially if you've played an enchanter, you're already used to puliing your hair out over things like broken mezzes and missed target calls. You'll love it, but if you're losing hair as a chanter already, you might want to go out and just get plugs or a wig before you start playing a bard, maybe some shoulder pads and a helmet so you can bang your head into the wall a few times, it always helps me.

				<td colspan="2"><span><b>Some bard Downsides:</b>
<br />
1) Minimal feedback - you dont have any gee wiz abilities except selos.  You do what you do and everything goes smoother but no one will ever say things like &quot;wow nice backstab&quot; etc.  It is why many uninformmed people dont think bards are any good (&quot;Bards suxxor!&quot;).
<br />
2) You won't be able to talk to your friends.  If you do you will say things like &quot;k11223344&quot;
<br />
3) The mez hole which hits at 59-61 really hurts - at 61 no one wants me because I cannot mez - One of our strengths is that we can play multiple roles and not having a workable mez in these levels is a pain.
<br />
4) There are a lot of bad bards.  This may change now that AE kiting is dead but the reputation of bards is not good.
<br />
5) bards are hard to play.
<br />

<br />
<b>Benefits:</b>
<br />
1) You will never ever get bored.  You will never want to &lt;insert chore here&gt; while you play eq.  You will always be in the thick of things.
<br />
2) Selos.  Once you get used to it you cannot go back.
<br />
3) You can do really cool stuff - find and watch mitchypoo's movie.
<br />
I have played all tank type classes, cleric and wizard up to the low 50s, then I went back and played my bard in earnest.  I never have gone back.
<br />
4) you are usually the last in your group to die - Our songs generate almost no agro.  To give you an example my druids flame lick stole agro after I slowed, and dotted a mob.  You will never get post mez agro.
<br />

<br />
<b>Groups:</b>
<br />
I have a regular group that I play with on Saturdays.  It consists of two Rogues, SK, Druid, Necro (or monk or shaman) and myself.   I usually pull, haste, slow and CC.  When the monk plays I mana, haste, slow and CC.  There is almost no where we cannot go.
<br />

<br />
I also do guild raids (rarely) and pickup groups.  The key here is to be flexible.  This is where being a bard is hard.  You have to change songs and styles to suit and best benefit your group.  You probably have to change your twist during a battle depending upon how it goes.  Basically, you fill the gaps and to do that you have to know what the gaps are.
<br />

<br />

<br />
<b>My advice to new bards</b>
<br />
For the first 20 levels you are a crappy tank who can run fast.  The 20s define your group abilities with haste, slow, and mez.  The 30s start the solo era and this lasts up until 55 or so if you want.  I would suggest that you group and test out all of your songs.  I also suggest that you group with different people to get a feel for how you play your bard in different situations.  You can get game exp solo but you can only get &quot;Bardly&quot; experience by grouping.
<br />

<br />
Give it a try - you wont regret it.

				<td colspan="2"><span>&quot;Twisting 4 reliably, with no dropouts, is the mark of a good bard, imho.&quot;
<br />

<br />
I disagree.  I find that in most cases, twisting 3 songs is just fine.  I encourage any new bard reading this not to fret over whether or not you can twist 3 or 4 or 5 songs.  It's definitely not some sort of &quot;good bard&quot;, &quot;bad bard&quot; mark.
<br />

<br />
Knowing what to twist and when ... now that is where you find the good bards.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I find soloing gets boring MIGHTY quick, especially as a Bard.  I find soloing monotonous, a LOT of work compared to a Root&amp;Rot class, for arguably lesser gains (at least with AE Kite nerf in place).  Grouping is what being a Bard is all about.
<br />

<br />
The real beauty of the Bard is being a Jack of All Trades, the one class that can plug practically any hole.  The sheer pleasure of the variety of ways you can play your class.  The only thing really putting a dent in this ability is that we can ONLY MEM 8 (9 now) songs.  Its amazing how often I adventure in small groups and I am counted on to:
<br />
- Pull
<br />
- Slow
<br />
- Mez
<br />
- Interrupt gaters
<br />
- Haste
<br />
- Mana
<br />
- Snare
<br />
- Melee
<br />
- Debuff
<br />
- Damage Shield
<br />

<br />
I feel this is lost in large raids.  You don't really get a chance to show your wares, yet you still work just as hard usually.  I certainly am not called on to pull on raids.  Monks do that.  Twisting 3-4 songs is twisting 3-4 songs no matter which environment you are in.  The Bard is just another cog in the wheel, a cog which never seems to shine like the Clerics or Tanks or Nukers.  Undoubtedly you will be raiding with other Bards, so, you will probably be doing a couple tasks at most, since your skills really don't stack all that well.
<br />

<br />
I often play &quot;beat the Shammy&quot; on my raids.  My goal is to land my 53% slow LONG before the Shaman land theirs.  Sure, its usually on the trash mobs, but even unslowed trash mobs can quickly tear through players.

Thats a bit misleading. Any mob that doesnt summon will most likely be killed quicker by a decent ranger / shaman / Necro .. maybe even a druid.

The casters rely on mana, rangers are probably the only class that will kill a high end mob quicker (assuming they have the archery AA)

				<td colspan="2"><span> Upside is very good, bards really are the jack of all trades class.  Seloes and fading memories are 2 of the best abilities in the game. We can avoid death better than almost any class (FD classes amy disagree with this). I went from level 38 to 52 with no deaths. We can solo at any level above about 30. I still can get decent experience chant kiting at 66, not as good as in a group but almost as good. If you have only an hour to play, you can get most of an AA just chanting with no risk. 
<br />
 Downside, other classes sometimes do not realize what a bard brings to a group. I was in a level 66-67 group in walls of slaughter the other night where the mellee toons didn't know that bard haste can get them over cap. So pickup groups at times can be hard to get. Of course we have it pretty good, since we are known as being good pullers, that alone is enough to get group invites. 
<br />
 Twisting 3-4 songs constantly even with a nostroma pad wears you down. My hand gets sore and that is a bad thing since I play guitar. You don't get much rest or get to chat when you are in a group. You really can't chat and joke around to much if your group is grinding. Of course you can always stop and chat between pulls but most people want you to bring mobs as fast as you can.
<br />
 A bid downside is that our equipment is hard to come by and as a plate class we are competing with other classes that feel that they deserve it more. In most cases, you will want to have your warrior have better gear than your bard. The upside is that we may be the least gear dependant class out there. I could chant kite solo if I had to. I have noticed that Oow seems to have some really nice droppable bard gear so far. I just traded for a ranged 1.8 percussion mod Bloodstone of the dance last night with decent all around stats. 
<br />
 So is you like to be busy when you load up EQ, a bard is definatly the class to play. But you will always be busy. I have not been in a heavy raiding guild but I hear you really only need a couple of bards on a raid. I hear bards here complaining that their role is diminished in the high end game.
<br />
 As a bard you have to be very aware of your surroundings or you can get your group killed. You said your main is an enchanter so you share some of the same responsibilities. A good bard is a great addition to a group, whereas a bad bard can cause alot of trouble. </span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>You can chat a little more easily if you remapp your hotbutton keys to F1-F10.  You need to pick other keys for group member targetting (I did ctrl-F1 -ctrl-F10).  You can then build up a chat sentence in between twisting, since the F-keys do not affect the chat.
<br />

<br />
Every class has a downside.  Bards have low DPS and also can't taunt well at all. I think low taunt is great in a lot of situations.  I can HoS (resist debuff) and slow a mob on a pull and almost any class can pull aggro from me.  But this can be a disdvantage.
<br />

<br />
It is funny that as I was leveling my bard I'd read about the 'missed-notes' complaints thinking 'stupid whiny bards :p'.  It is true, being a 67 bard with few AAs(26) I can say that missed notes blow chunks<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-4.gif" border="0" alt="Tongue out" hspace="2" /> It is still livable, but it is about the only thing I wish would be changed with a bard.
<br />

<br />
I have found macro-ing completely useless in most sitations because of missed notes and also because I like to flow with the sitation.  It is nice if you are in a completely controlled situation though.</span></td>

Calinn I appreciate your viewpoint, but I apparently could have been clearer. Per your magelo and an earlier post you made,  your bard is not your main character and your bard is level 63 with 14 or so AA. Some other bards may have some experience that would add to your views. When I said that bards have a unique ability to solo many mobs, I meant it. Let me give you some examples:
<br />

<br />
1. I used to pull Glykus (a raid mob in Tactics) and kite the entire pit and all his spawned adds for loot. There are a tremendous number of casters there. Sometimes I soloed it and sometimes I duoed it with one of the top necros on my server. If you can't cast on the run, crank out mega resists and DA and fade/fd, you are not going to be able to solo this camp. I can't envision how other classes could solo this.
<br />

<br />
2. Try soloing the mephits in PON. Getting there solo is next to impossible without POV and selos. Staying there without a death pretty much requires fade. Maybe a good necro could get there and solo the camp, but I doubt it and I have never seen a necro try.
<br />

<br />
3. Unsnareable and unrootable mobs. Druids and necros and rangers usually need a mob snared or rooted. If a mob runs at SOW speed or better and it can't be snared, these classes usually won't try to solo them. Try the hobgoblins in PON for example. Some pet classes (Beastlords) solo them, but that is the only other class other than bard I have ever seen solo the hobgoblins.
<br />

<br />
4. Mez-heal. Bards can start a fight and mez the mob and heal up. This has permitted many bards to solo mobs that many other classes couldn't do.
<br />

<br />
To be sure, rangers, necros, druids, wizzies and beastlords all do more DPS than a bard as a general rule. They may be better solo classes after 65. We won't know the answer to this question for a while because it will take some time for this to shake out with new songs, spells and abilities and zones.  But from 1 to 65 if bards are not the best solo class there are few competitors. Even with the nerf to AE kites, swarm kiting up to level 65 is still some excellent experience.
<br />
