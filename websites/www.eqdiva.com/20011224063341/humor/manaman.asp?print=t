<h4>Dedication to Bards: The Mana Man (by Deirdre Sadiqa)</h4>
Here's a little something I wrote for my virtuoso friend, Danilo. Thought you bards would like 
it...<BR><BR>
<I>to the tune of Piano Man, by Billy Joel</I>
<BR><BR>It's time for the raid on a Saturday 
<BR>The regular guildees log in <BR>Theres a couple of n00bs sitting next to me 
<BR>Making love, the cybering sin <BR><BR>I get stuck with the caster group 
right away <BR>So I sit and practice my tone <BR>I won't need to twist battle 
melodies <BR>Cause they'll ask for one song alone <BR><BR>La la la, di de da 
<BR>La la, di de da da dum <BR><BR>Sing us song, you're the mana man <BR>Sing us 
a song tonight <BR>'Cause we don't want to sit down and meditate <BR>And you'll 
keep us ready to fight <BR><BR>Now Jonna the cleric's a friend of mine <BR>She 
gets me my buffs for free <BR>And she's quick with a heal, and slow to shout 
"Peel!" <BR>And there's no class that she'd rather be. <BR><BR>She says, "Dan I 
can't stand that they're nerfing me, <BR>And they never will fix Mark of Karn. 
<BR>Well I'm sure that it could be much better, <BR>But it's better than being a 
bard." <BR><BR>Oh, la la la, di de da <BR>La la, di de da da dum <BR><BR>Now 
Poal is a tanking enchanter <BR>Who's still getting over his wife <BR>He's 
chatting with Mavy, a druid slut-baby <BR>Who's prob'ly a guy in real life 
<BR><BR>And the guildmaster's practicing politics <BR>As the planes were all 
booked for a year <BR>And I try to play Niv's Harmonic <BR>But it's not what 
they all want to hear <BR><BR>Sing us a song, you're the mana man <BR>Sing us a 
song tonight <BR>'Cause we don't want to sit down and meditate <BR>And you'll 
keep us ready to fight <BR><BR>It's a pretty good raid for a Saturday <BR>And 
the raidleader gives the okay <BR>We'll smack the damn sod that thinks it's a 
god <BR>And forget about life for today <BR><BR>And I draw my weapons and face 
the thing <BR>I can tank, buff, debuff and melee! <BR>But I'm stuck with a 
wizard, and a twink necro lizard <BR>That say "Dan, can't you play clarity?" 
<BR><BR>Oh, la la la, di de da <BR>La la, di de da da dum <BR><BR>Sing us a 
song, you're the mana man <BR>Sing us a song tonight <BR>'Cause we don't want to 
sit down and meditate <BR>And you'll keep us ready to fight<BR><BR><BR>
