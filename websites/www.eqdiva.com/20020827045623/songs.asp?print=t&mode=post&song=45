<html><body bgcolor=#000000><br><br><font color=white face=verdana><h3>EQDiva's Future</h3>Depends on you! I'm wondering if my time justified in rebuilding the site so that it will never go out of date, will be worth the effort. Please voice your opinions and vote at <a href='http://pub118.ezboard.com/feqdivabardsofeverquestfrm1.showMessage?topicID=5862.topic'>The Future of EQDiva poll</a>. In the meantime, I'd also like to ask that you update your EQDiva bookmarks to the forums, if you are using the forums more than you are using the site. This will help me keep the site free forever! <a href='http://pub118.ezboard.com/beqdivabardsofeverquest'>EQDiva Forums</a> <br><br>EQDiva site will be down for two more days so that I can get everyone's attention and feedback. During this time I will be making my decision to pull the site down forever and move on with my life, or put it back up as is, or put it back up and update/rebuild it either ASAP or as my time allows. Your voice counts, and will be heard. </font><body></html>
