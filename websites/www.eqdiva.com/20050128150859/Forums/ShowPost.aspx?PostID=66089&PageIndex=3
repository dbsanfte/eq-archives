				<td colspan="2"><span>Well.. i can only comment on what i read, cos i have not attempted the DN fights myself..
<br />

<br />
But from what i read, it IS completely out of whack if compared to most(all) of the other epic 1.5's around.
<br />

<br />
My main is a Ranger.. Ranger 1.5 epic includes some foraging and soloable mobs to make some weapons that &quot;capture&quot; a animal to get its blood. Making of theese weapons require a skill of 15 fletching.. i am, as many other rangers, a GM fletcher with 250 + mod. Even tho the skill is only 15, it at least uses a &quot;ranger-typical&quot; tradeskill.. Imo inline with a class spesific quest.
<br />
After that i duoed 3 of the mobs.. me 66 ranger and a 55 druid on second computer. For last of the &quot;captured&quot; mobs i got help from a 67 chanter in the guild.
<br />
After that, there is 2 lvl 64 or so mobs that need to be killed. Also did that with 3 (Me, druid and chanter). 
<br />
Then some turnins.. and i am ready for 3 final battles requiring around 4-5 groups for me.
<br />

<br />
My guild is not in elementals yet (Missing RZ atm). We do however have EP/Time+ geared people, but they are not majority of the guild.
<br />

<br />
The 3 last fights happens in Bloodfields (Druid/wiz ports aviable), Natimbi (druid/wiz port aviable) and Ruined city of dranik..
<br />

<br />
So.. 2 of the 3 final TOUGH fights are easily accessible with porters too..
<br />

<br />
Compare that with Bard epic.. Honestly, the DN part should be skipped, or tuned down to be 1 groupable at MAX(Non EP geared). Tune the dragons to be MAX 2 groupable, and you suddenly have 2-3 fights left that require guild help. This would be inline with the other epics.. as things are today, it is WAY out of whack compared.

				<td colspan="2"><span>As of this morning, the official Sony response is that they have fixed the Kithicor bug and the DN &quot;bug&quot; with too many guards spawning with patches to those zones yesterday.  This is the e-mail I had in the in-box this morning from Brenlo:
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">I am very happy that you find the current flow of information helpful.  We, unfortunately, did not push the changes to the Kithicor Forest live on Friday, they are live as of this correspondence, along with the changes to Dragon's Necropolis.  
<br />
 
<br />
With Necropolis, the NPCs were spawning incorrectly, in that too many were spawning and they were not despawning correctly.  This resulted in more NPCs being involved in the encounter than we had planned.  This should now be corrected.  Please let me know of any new feedback related to the changes we made today.
<br />
 
<br />
As to comparisons between the steps in the bard epic and other epic quests, we feel that we have parity between the quests.  We are comfortable with where they are currently.  However I will bring your concerns to the team for consideration and should we come to any conclusions that involve a change in the quest, I will let you know.</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
I've been telling a lot of my guildies that there will be no changes to the structure of the quests and I have been telling them that for two weeks.  Sony has no problem, after you present them with evidence, in admitting there is a bug and then attempting to fix that bug.  Sometimes, they still can't find the answer after three years but they at least admit there's a bug.  However, in EverQuest, one thing that simply does not exist is a design flaw.  They NEVER make a mistake in developmental design.  So despite the fact that the bard epic requires three to seven times the man-hours in group/guild help that several other epics require, we have &quot;parity&quot; between epics.  Because Sony cannot possibly make a mistake in design.
<br />

<br />
I give the team at SOE props for fixing the bugs and communicating with me on this one.  But their stubborn refusal to even consider the possibility that their design is flawed on these quests is troubling.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>I am clearly mising something here. The 2.2 mod is nice,especially when grouped, but how is it going to be especially helpful on raids? On raids I either debuff, play resists, do mana, play MA songs or just do group songs and melee (oops forgot pulling). For the first 2 of these I use a drum. If we need more regen with mana I use a lute. Several of us have the 2.0 singing mod drop from Sarryn in torment so if we need increased singing mod for MA songs this is a very margina increase. If I am in a dps grp this will give a small extra increase to attack. The click effect lasts for one minute and gives about 5 to 10 extra dps from the folks I have chatted with. So, in summation it seems to me that this is a weapon with really nice stats for a pre-Time bard but its effects provide minimal benefit to a guild. A nice upgrade for the bard who only groups but even there it still seems lacking compared to other epics. (Yes, I did the math and its downright depressing to think that I would have to drag people to 8 raids for such a small increase in AC and resists).

				<td colspan="2"><span>Well the epic  is still a nice item as it is still a nice weapon even for time guild level and it releives the pain of of choosing other pieces of equipement with instruments mods on them.
<br />

<br />
But YES the epic difficulty is not in par with other classes. 
<br />

<br />
7/8 multi group encounters is nowhere the same as for other classes. We finished epics for two wizzies last night in guild and we only had to kill 2 raid sized mobs.
<br />

<br />
Any event with more than 2 groups requires the same thing as a complete guild not in term of force but in term of organization.
<br />
If you need 15/20 or 25 people you cant do that during off time when most of the people are sleeping or at work. You need to do it when a good proportion of the guild is up. That means peak times. And at peak times, taking 15/20 or 25 people to do an encounter is preventing the guild from doing anything else. So its like if you were recruiting your whole guild.

Well it seems clear that a 2.2 mod to all instruments is just a wee bit Overpowering to the class, or 95% of the Bards....and very few Bards will ever see it.  The ones that do see it, won't need it.
<br />

<br />
For the rest of us, just keep instrument switiching for that fat 3.2 mod vs. 2.2
<br />

<br />
Oh and that melody might just make instrument switching that much easier when a 4 song group is playing without server lag spikes, and you just target/switch instruments/move around....I can't wait.  If it works real nicely...screw this pathetic quest known as 1. freaking 5

I helped others, with fights, that even with travel and staging all took under 2 hours.  I couldn't even get people to DN in that time.

Total waste of time.  There might even be a chance, if the MIC's (morons in charge) at Sony would just drop a druid/wizzy port into WW.  They've decided they needed instant ports everywhere else, why not that one part of Velious?

				<td colspan="2"><span>in my opinion.  the quest and the epic itself are very adequate.  if you consider that this weapon is better then any weapon we get in time.  None of the encounters are even close to as difficult as most of the gods required to get into time.  while they are a bit unbalanced as far as other classes difficulties, i dont foresee sony making the other quests harder.
<br />

<br />
as far as the epic itself.  2.2 mod is not great if you ARE time+ and have all the high end instrument mods, however remember also this is 1.5,  and if they gave us all 3.0 mods on epic 1.5, where we have to go at 2.0.  its just like the particle effects, many people believe the cool effect graphics that are displayed in the concept art are what will occur at 2.0.  
<br />

<br />
as far as casual vs raiding.  i believe these encounters are ALL appropriately leveled for the casual player.  for years i was in a casual guild.  most of that guild is now elemental.  it may take a bit longer then raiding guilds who can get entire epics done in a day or two, it is still much easier then the gods, and easily attainable by casual guilds, casual groups of players.  specially after OoW has been out a while and the WoS flocks have fully equipped on near elemental quality loot.  Sony never said it was attainable by the casual player the first week or two of release.
<br />

<br />
edit - as a side note.  i completely agree with the general sentiment that sony is completely inconsiderate in their treatment of our valid complaints.  they could respond alot better.
<br />

<br />
another edit - 
<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">The 2.2 mod is nice,especially when grouped, but how is it going to be especially helpful on raids? On raids I either debuff, play resists, do mana, play MA songs or just do group songs and melee (oops forgot pulling)</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
its not.  hardly any of the effects are very useful on raids,  maybe druid, and definitely cleric.  the rest are more minor boosts, conveniences.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Interesting feedback from Sony.  I can understand how they feel our epic is balanced, in a convoluted kind of way.  If you use strategies, and don't go in undermanned, our epic is probably one of the fastest to do.  A little too fast in my opinion.  If you hit the bazaar for diamonds, get the enchanted bars of velium, and farm the dragorn blood, you can do your epic in one night.  
<br />

<br />
Lots of other classes have frustrating, time consuming camps.  My pally friend was on hour 22 of camping Screambringers in Barindu.  This requires less than a group, but you have to keep people there for a long time.  I don't want to spoil too much, but I will try to put our epic into perspective:
<br />

<br />
- Gathering bones is simple for a bard.  All three ground spawns can be picked up solo.  All the mercs can be chant kited solo.  Both Excavator and Tarm are trioable with tank, bard, healer.  It's up to the bard to get Tarm solo, but easily doable with our tools.
<br />

<br />
- First DN fight is very easy if you set up right.  I know some people have said that they got the hall adds when the pulled Vasthon, but I have done this twice, never saw that.  The three zombies are kited, leaving Vasthon/Draco.  Vaston is a sissy, draco is tougher.  Every priest class has AE heals now, use them.  The ramp sounds worse than it is.  Just keep everyone aware to move out of range if you getting beat on too hard.  Really the Draco's atk rating must be very low.  Maybe 5pct of his hits were for max,according to the MT that did it.
<br />

<br />
- Second DN fight is the tough part.  I do agree this could use some tuning.  However, is SoE's note to Steppy is accurate, then maybe each lich only has one minion, which would put this fight back in line.  This is our big epic raid fight, which many classes have (Clr in WL, Wiz in SD and WoS).  It sucks that our raid is at the beginning, which roadblocks progression, but it is what it is.
<br />

<br />
- 4 dragons scale in difficulty.  From my experience, Swamp, Mountain, Plains, Forest.  Swamp and mountain are a simple tank fight that is just a strugle to maintain mana levels, depending on gear.  Plains was tougher, since the AE requires more healing.  A warrior is best to use defensive; the dragons don't hit hard and can be killed before defensive drops.  A note on Forest, do not melee.  It is wasteful of the healers mana, just use range damage only.  Bring rangers and casters for fastest killing.  I had 3 Trueshot rangers, this dragon dropped faster than any of the others.
<br />

<br />
- Bazaar farming and blood gathering is self explanatory.
<br />

<br />
- Kithicor fight isn't bad.  I setup at WC zone line, which was probably wrong in hindsight.  He moves east to west, which means we were chasing him down.  We also did it at night, which meant lots of trash adds from undead.  He stays on the trail, just hail him twice, then have people pick up the adds.  The mobs hit weak, like 300 or 400.  I had one warrior, one pally, 2 ranger tanks for this.  Just systematically use assist to kill them quick.  Keep an eye out for named thief, he will add like a normal shade.  Mez or tank mez the normal shades, get whole raid on thief.  Shades depop when thief is killed.
<br />

<br />
- Torment is also easy.  You basically wont resist the AE silence, so hide the healers and casters.  Otherwise, straight tank fight, no damage AE's.  
<br />

<br />
This is our whole epic 1.5.  Compare this to some other classes, and see how very short ours is.  In exchange, we require more multi-group assistance.  I don't think this is bad, just different.
<br />

				<td colspan="2"><span>The more I study it, the more I think Kanarian is right.  Instead of 5 or 6 long, boring farming camps we can do solo or with a couple of patient friends, we get 4 dragon fights.  I think our epic requires more people to assist us than any other epic.  However, it DOES demand a lot less time than most of them.  Sony probably sees this as parity in terms of some abstract quanta called &quot;challenge.&quot;  What they fail to realize, and this is universal - not just specific to the epic - is that for some players at their level of the game, getting together 30 elemental-geared friends for even one fight is far more challenging than 30 hours of camping farmed mobs with a friend or two.  I will get my epic, but it will take months because the resources available -- my guild -- are going to be spread way too thin over the weeks ahead doing 60-some epics and maintaining our normal raid schedule.  We have a couple of people already epic because they could do 90% of theirs without the involvement of a guild.  And this is where the lack of &quot;parity&quot; really exists.  Sony's evaulations that X amount of farmin = Y amount of raid fights is skewed heavily toward the notion that something like six hours of framing for a necro solo is equal to one hour of gathering a 30 person raid and executing it.  The fact is, the solo farming is significantly easier, just more time consuming.  Some of us have time to spare but getting the manpower together for these fights will strain our relationships with guild and friends, especially right now when everyone else in the guild needs raids done for epics too.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>The way our guild resolved this problem Steppy is to dedicate one night a week to Epics.  You get charged a certain loot value in exchange for renting the guild's time.  We got 7 Epic raid fights done last Friday. The rules are that you come prepared with everything needed to trigger, and know the general event.  
<br />

<br />
We did 2 Wiz fights in Scarelt Desert, the WL event for clerics twice, my DN2 fight, and a few others.  It goes surprisingly fast, and people are paying loot points, so you get raid credit.  
<br />

<br />
With regards to parity between few multi group fights vs. long solo/group farming camps, it is a double edged sword.  People in a raiding guild do not have tons of free time, especially since some of the camps are contested (had fun in Quinimi racing others for Spiritmasters for pallies).  On the other hand, people not in a raid guild do not have access to a large roster of people to call on.  
<br />

<br />
What I have seen on my server is akin to a /openraid channel, but for epics.  People join the channel and help, then in return get help from others.  People not in a guild act like only guilds can gather groups of people, but this isn't true.

I have  a shaman friend who's a contract game programmer and he has a lot of free time on his hands during the weekdays.  His epic is already done while all I have done is the Tarn Macklin fight and the gathering of stuff that is buyable.  So I totally agree that what is feasable for one person is not necessarily feasable for another.  I really see Sony basically trying to equate epics by the total number of &quot;character/hours&quot; required to complete them.  The problem with the bard epic as I see it, is that it requires a whole lot of OTHER PEOPLE'S characters hours and not as many of mine.

				<td colspan="2"><span>My two bit observations to all of this - keeping in mind that I'm still relatively early in the process.
<br />

<br />
My expectations for Epic 1.5 - as set by Sony - was that a guild such as mine would be able to do all of them. A solid turn out for a raid including bots for us is 18-20. I expected to be somewhat stretched to do it, and to quite likely have to wait until a good hunk of us were level 70 with some degree of average oow gear (with our numbers, elementals is not something we'll ever see). This, to me, fit inline of the notion of some soloing, some group encounters, and perhaps a few *small* raids. By definition, the fact that it was labled as not being the one for raiding guild members means that you can't expect 30+ toons to show up, nor can you expect time+ or even elemental gear IMHO (though, looking at some of the very obtainable OoW drops, maybe you can expect elemental).
<br />

<br />
Some have complained that 1.5 is underpowered. Personally, I agree that the ratio is just a tad weak relative to other 1.5's (hoping for the improvement there), but it otherwise seems pretty spot on for the level of player it's targeted at. The reason for the raiding guild bard to go get it is that is is part of the larger 2.0 epic - that's the one I expect to be simply awesome (much as 1.0 was back in Kunark). You simply can't put epic 2.0 expectations on 1.5. I honestly never expect to see 2.0 - it's meant for raiding guilds, and that's not where I'm ever going to be. For me, it's &quot;Thank you SOE for remembering the little guy&quot; this time around.
<br />

<br />
Now, that begs the question: &quot;What did we really wind up with?&quot; From what I can see early in things, the fights seem all to be reasonable except DN2. The jury is still out on just how hard that one will be after the fix. What I'm after out of all these encounters is that they are doable by 18 or less people equipped with the gear/spells available to the &quot;common player&quot; in OoW. Level 70 needed for everyone? Fine, that's fair. Need those nice BF, PG, WoS, etc. drops in your equipment list? OK, cool - I'm jiggy with it. What I was seeing out of DN2 was something not doable without raw headcount, and that was my tweak on it (it's worth noting that SK's definitely have a fight that is headcount dependent too).
<br />

<br />
Stay tuned - I hope to be at DN2 this week.</span></td>

<br />

<br />
Steppy, this is incorrect. Some bards may have the money and luck to buy the planes drops they need to complete their epic, but others will not. Therefore, they will be required to camp these items with friends. (Most can not be soloed well.) Additionally, we are required to camp Dragorn Blood. Which does not always drop at a fast rate. We by no means have the chalenge of our fights off-set by not needing to camp drops. 
<br />

<br />
There are a few other things that come up for me after reading this thread.
<br />

<br />
1. Getting people to DN is not a huge time sink. Port to CS and run through SG and your almost right at the DN zone-in. Any player that can't get through SG might not be up to doing the DN fights. (Though folks seem dumb enough to trigger the bone traps as they run in. <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-13.gif" border="0" alt="LOL" hspace="2" /> ) No way does it take two hours to get there. Additionally, the last SK fight is in WW so we're not alone.
<br />

<br />
Personally, the hardest place to get a raid force to is the monk's 7th Hammer fight. I don't know about others, but not many players I know completed all six PoJ trials. So now your not just asking a few players to take the time to get flagged for this fight, your asking a whole raid force to take time to get a very old and unused PoP flag. I'm not going to complain about asking them to run to DN after this.
<br />

<br />
2. The effort to complete these epics are by no means equal. The last fight for the Nec. and SK. are about as tough as our first shade fight in DN. The rougue and warrior final fights are slightly more chalenging. The BL and ranger one looks to be a slightly more simple then of last DN fight. The cleric final fight is very hard and I don't see a casual player doing this fight. 
<br />

<br />
Therefore, I don't think the fights themselves are more chalenging then all other class epic, I just think that we have twice as many that require raids.
<br />

<br />
The bards epic 1.5 is very doable. Will a truely casual player be able to complete it. I really don't think so. But the bard 1.5 epic is not the must have that the first bard epic was.

Dragorn blood is easy to get in WoS.  Just ooc for it while grouping near dragorns.  I got 4 bloods from mobs I killed, 4 from people offering it.  Be very sure not to train though, I was denied one blood because the group that got it was trained earlier by another bard.

7th hammer flagging is fast to do.  My guild is already doing this.  Take one group through all 6 in about an hour.  Yes it sucks for monks to have to push people through, but this is how you get help for your own epic.  Get flagged, help a few monks, and now you have some additional bodies for your own fights.  
<br />

<br />
It is easy for us to complain about the number of raids our epic takes, but check the forum on the original Epic, and look at the multiple threads on Phinny kills to backbones ratio.  The epic must be hard, or it isn't epic.  Every class has some point of the epic that is a headache.  Necros are going nuts camping an uncommon drop off an uncommon mob in PoI.  Good luck if another necro is hunting it too.  We have zero competition for our epic mobs.  
<br />

<br />
Yes, the DN2 fight is a bit too much.  I suspect that the problem in the script was too many minions per Lich, and this may get tuned down to one per lich.  This means you will have to mez 4 blue con mobs, and off tank 3 while kiling liches.  Further, as you kill the liches, the minions despawn, so it gets easier as you go along in the script.  
<br />

<br />
The Vasthon/Draco part of DN2 is not too bad if you are smart about it.  A few healers with MGB heals and group heals, warrior with defensive, and ranged DPS make this simple.  You just have to use tactics on this fight.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I think we need more soloable parts.  Every other epic has solo parts to it, most of the other epics are very easy.  Ive seen a ton of warrior, necro, SK, druid, and wizard epics on my server, and not 1 bard epic yet.
<br />

<br />
I would much rather camp an item or do tradeskill combines then try to get 20-40 people together for 8 different mobs.  I am the leader of my guild, and we can complete this epic, but I am asking 40 people to help me for 8 different encounters w/o a single thing to offer them (for other epics, at least a loot drops for their raid events).
<br />

<br />
Epic 1.5 is supposed be able to be completed by &quot;a casual player&quot;.  This epic requires at least EP quality gear to stand a chance.  No way a casual player is going to get 40 people together to beat the second DN raid.
<br />

<br />
Epic 2.0 is supposed to be for the raider.  They are really hard and need end game access (we need Tacvi access to do 2.0 for example).
<br />

<br />
DN raids should be eliminated and have something else put in its place (rare drop off spiders maybe, and combine the 4 bones with that item and hand in for example).  Either way our epic requires WAY too many raid encounters for the casual player.</span></td>

Just not true.  I thought this same way until I did the epic.  The DN2 fight yes; but most everyone agrees it is out of balance.  The other fights just aren't.  Two dragons are one groupable, one is 2 groupable, one is three groupable.  I had 18 people for Kith and Torment, had zero deaths, so I could have done it with less.  Half were Time+, but other half were crappy geared bots, so I would call it about EP time average.  
<br />

<br />
As for solo stuff, the 8 bloods is our tedious solo camp.  You can get them in any OoW zone, including DS and NC.  I tried soloing for it in NC, but it was just too slow. If you enjoy endless hours of chant kiting, you can solo this part.  Grouping not required, just faster.  
<br />

<br />
I think that people complaining about the difficulty of it should consider other class epics, aside from Shaman and Necro (I think that these are too easy, but not really looking for a flame fest).  Clerics have to camp 4 lore random drops in Ferubi.  Crap exp at 70, and I was there 5 hours.  We have 9 more clerics to get epics for, so they have to gather help for this, and they are envious of how fast and not tedious ours is.
<br />

<br />
The grass is always greener:  classes with long rare camps want short fast fights (even if it means multi-group).  We have that, yet are complaining that we don't have more long rare camps.  I think we should accept what we got, and work wth it.  You will have no problems getting help with your epic if you do a lot of 5 hour Ferubi camps.  Plus, you will appreciate rolling through triggered fight after triggered fight after many a long rare camp.

10k, <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-14.gif" border="0" alt="Devil" hspace="2" /> don't assume you can get these items for this much on all servers. On my server you have someone chargeing 10.5 for ONE diamond. The hardest to collect items were also not for sell in the bazaar. I basicly, had my guildies clear out their banks to toss together the items I needed. They were VERY kind. In terms of the blood, everytime I log on I get tells about some rotting. <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-13.gif" border="0" alt="LOL" hspace="2" /> They never drop while I'm there chating. Guess I'll have to work for my last two.  <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-5.gif" border="0" alt="Wink" hspace="2" />

<br />
The bard epic quest is cool as it is. The lore and fights are very fun. I'm just a few steps from being done and if I cried more I'd be done. I just feel for those that can't get the pp or people to do it.

<br />
I, for one, dont think the epic is overly unbalanced to be honest.  I'm in Gwenwyvar's guild, and the only thing that stopped us doing the DN encounter 4 times was the lockout timer.  THATS the biggest blocker from what I see.
<br />

<br />
If anything, the lockout timer on the 4+ group events (for all epics) should be removed.  Its hard enough getting people there once let alone 4 or 5 times.  Use the right tactics, the 2nd DN fight is a 5-7 min fight.
<br />

<br />
The entire epic 1.5 is very straightforward, same as our original one.  Straightforward doesnt mean easy, just uncomplicated.  And if you think your tactics out a little, the supposedly hard fights are not as hard as you think.
<br />

<br />
It IS a Time level weapon.  It's allready been confirmed its being changed to 24/22, which is exactly the same ratio as the Songblade of the Eternal - a bards Time weapon.  It's not something that a pre elemental person should find easy to get.  And its still gettable for pre elementals if you think things out.
<br />

<br />
Use some common sense and think the encounters out a little, zerg rushing isnt always the answer.  DN, pre target the mezable mobs, and take out the liches whos minions cant be mez'd first.  I also suggest a /hidecorpse all hotkey in case you get spider adds...
<br />

<br />
JPF dragon, use ranged tactics.  Those are the 2 hard fights.  The rest are relatively straightforward.  And for a weapon thats the same ratio as SotE, it sure takes a lot less people to kill the needed mobs.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>I too feel that our epic is out of balance for pre-elemental bards aka the Casual Player. I am what I would consider an elemental bard and I think that the 4 dragons yielding no loot to those that help you just plain stinks. It doesn't help the fact that not only do we have to call on those same people for 4 dragons but to call on even more for the 2nd step in our epic, if you follow the progression correctly, and then again 2 more times for the fight in kithicor and the final fight in torment. The DN2 fight is too dificult for the chance that 1 chest may or may not spawn and that (from my observation) would take between 30 and 40 of the people from my guild (similarily geared as myself) to complete successfully. Take the cleric final battle as an example with 24 people similarily geared to myself we won. It wasn't pretty, in the end the skeleton adds were kited off and everyone was rezzed and we ported out, but it was doable with what I would consider a mini-raid. The bard epic requires 4-5 mini-raids, 2 2-3 group encounters, 1 1 groupable encounter, and 1 full blown raid (2nd step mind you) to get an item that is decent (post 10/13/04 patch) and probably useable up until Time when Songblade becomes an option and will undoubtedly do more dps due to the damage bonus being applied more often. I am not saying it is impossible to achieve for a elemental guild, because its not, but it does require that bard to basically steal a day of raiding to drag enough people out to DN to get an intermediate piece in the epic.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>While none of the fights may be &quot;too hard,&quot; the problem remains - there are too many of them.  I have no reservations about spending hours of my time to farm a rare drop, but I feel entirely different about mobilizing my guild 6 times or so to get 1 item for 1 person.  It's just too much of a PITA for too many people for too little reward.  Either provide alternate item quests for some of the steps, or add OoW spell drops to the loot tables, as suggested above.</span></td>
