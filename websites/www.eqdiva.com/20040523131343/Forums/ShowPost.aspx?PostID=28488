				<td colspan="2"><span>There are very active conversations on the shammy, wizzy, and of course cleric boards(haven't checked druid's), about druid/shammy heals in relation to cleric. Arguments that i see for clerics to remain the undisputed champs of healing:
<br />
1. Little to no soloability
<br />
2. No movement increasing buff
<br />
3. No invis
<br />
4. Offers almost nothing else in groups and raids other than hp buffs, rez, and heal, including insanely low dps.
<br />

<br />
Arguments that i see for druids and shammies to draw closer to clerics in terms of healing:
<br />
1. Both classes, druids more can be soloed
<br />
2. High dps
<br />
3. Brings many things to a grouping situation including slow and DS respectively
<br />
4. In most cases druids and shammies are very undesirable in grouping situations
<br />

<br />
Maybe these are all way off but i tried posting on the cleric's forum and got eatten alive. I just wanted to discuse and argue (friendly) in a nice, safe environment<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-13.gif" border="0" alt="LOL" hspace="2" />
<br />

<br />
I suggest reading some of the threads on the wizzy, shammy, and clerics boards cause they are very interesting and both sides have some very good points. I myself am in support of druids/shammies drawing to withing 75%-80% of clerics. Maybe they'd even get a full cheal like clerics, only it'd cost double the mana and double the casting time. /shrug.
<br />

<br />
Your thoughts on it all.

Let me just say that if druids or shammies got what you are suggesting, then the only time my cleric would see any use is when someone needed a rez or my guild was raiding.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I actually switched from a shaman to my bard.  Started out as a 'spur of the moment' thing to level up my 2nd ever created character.  He'd been sitting inactive on my account for around 4 years<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />  Anyway, to cut the story short, you're missing a couple of details in this with regards to the shaman perspective.
<br />

<br />
Currently, the healing ratios are: (this has been confirmed as the 'healing ratio' by SoE representatives)
<br />
Cleric 100%
<br />
Druid 68% (with respect to cleric)
<br />
Shaman 47% (with respect to cleric)
<br />

<br />
I am less familiar with the druid argument, and personally (&lt;- shaman bias still) I don't feel they have as much need for improvement. However, most shaman are asking less to encroach on the cleric realm, as they are asking to get closer to druids healing capability.
<br />
The problem for shamans is that they are being penalised for having a slow capability. However, with the introduction of slow mitigation and immunity, and, especially in higher-end PoP and most of GoD, mobs have huge DPS, but low hps, making for short fights. In these fights, you need fast powerful healing capability.  Clerics have this, and druids to a lesser degree. Shaman, have a 300/tick (360ish if you have the GoD spell) HoT, and a mana inefficient 1300 base direct heal casting in 3.8 seconds. With AA's and focus, this reaches around 1700 direct, with 3100ish crit heals. Don't even mention that piece of crap called a 'percentage CH' shaman get - 10 second cast to heal max of 1950 is so worthless on anything past tier 1 as to be insulting. On mobs that hit 1300+, and can triple or quad, even with a tanks' mitigation, a shaman cannot hope to ever heal a main tank, and is relegated to spot heals on MT, or 'trying' to heal the cleric if they get agro. 
<br />
In a game that is supposed to allow a bit of diversity in healers, GoD especially is making a cleric or two (or cleric and druid) a 'must have', and the extremely short fight times (with slow immunity or mitigation) is marginalising the slow capability of shaman.  So Shaman are understandably upset with the state they're in, where they are fairly useless healers, people prefer a beastlord for slowing, (h*ll, since playing my bard *I* prefer a beastlord for slowing) and they are not equipped spell wise for burst damage, where a druid at least has some decent nukes.
<br />
Sure, shaman can heal well enough in BoT, or tactics etc, and well equipped ones with well equipped tanks can do EP's, but in GoD, they are repeatably being passed over for groups, and asked for 'buffs please' by guildmates before they enter a trial.
<br />
Not to mention that fact that shaman spells have increasingly become more and more mana inefficient to make up for the ability to canabalise, they cannot do anything for a reasonable period of time without having to constantly canni. In GoD, pausing to canni is a luxury you sometimes just don't have.
<br />

<br />
Shaman recently received an improved heal, 1550 or so if memory serves me correctly, but even that is a stop gap, and doesn't really address the real problem; shaman are designed for extended fights, and the trend these days for short, high damage fights is simply making them less and less needed.
<br />

<br />
I hope that helps to somewhat explain the shaman perspective.  </span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Eaten alive on the cleric board? wow there usually a nice calm bunch, but i guess when healing is the thing you can do really well and others try to take some of it away you get a bit protective.
<br />

<br />
As for shamans i guess slow is a very powerfull thing, and canni is nice to so i guess there is a penalty somewhere to balance it, after all clerics have been told over and over that they have complete heal, no need for invis/better soloability and so on.
<br />

<br />
As for GoD that expansion seems to be aimed at the 60+ crowd so for people below that shaman healing is not that bad, and a cleric is not exactly a must for an xp grind in dl at karnor or  overthere while slow is a nice thing, can't say my cleric is super equipped at 51 but not that bad either, i still have problems with a lightblue mob in overthere so the soloability is crap pure and simple.
<br />

<br />
I liked a suggestion that shamans/druids could get a better heal only usable in GoD zones, would not wreck the balance in normal xp zones.</span></td>

If not a typo then a pretty controversial assertion, IMO.  Our regular group regards the healer slot as very interchangable -- we'll take a druid, a cleric, even another shaman.  But the slower &amp; buffer slot is always fixed.  No shaman = find something else to do.</span></td>

Better yet, raise a clerics and give them better soloability, so more folks play them. Lets face it, /heal /sit/med/stand/heal/sit/med can get boring after the 9000th time or so I would think.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Shaman are pretty overrated.  Their slow is not materially better than chanter or beastlord slows (especially with mitigation), heals are bordering on hybrid quality (paladins were disturbingly close in healing ability, the lastest changes help though), DPS ranks behind almost any class (including clerics), and other priests perform CC as well or better.  There's basically no reason to add a shaman to most groups if there is a chanter or BST available.  I only pull my shaman out anymore if there is no other healer available... and a weak healer he is.  If the first slow is resisted a shaman can find himself in the dreaded &quot;Tnarg chain&quot;... you can do nothing but keep spamming your weak blast heal, can't even get time to attempt another slow or to canni.  That means the &quot;superior mana regen&quot; that shamans are touted for and has become a necessity to fuel some highly inefficient spells is not available.
<br />

<br />
Now, I'm not trying to say shamans suck, they are still a decent class.  But they are very, VERY replaceable.  ENC and BST slow as well as is needed for 99% of situations, and bring more to the table in other departments.</span></td>

Shammy vs. Enchanter -- in a group with a bard.
<br />

<br />
Shammy brings:  best slow in the game, backup heals, strong DOTs, buffs, avatar, haste
<br />

<br />
Enchanter brings:  slow albeit not as good, better haste, KEI, mez/charm
<br />

<br />

<br />
Shammy wins.  Bard covers the mez.  Chanter haste is superior but not so much so as to make up for the total inability to heal.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Shammy vs. BST:  Comes down to DPS vs. heals.  This depends on the rest of the group I suppose.  My regular group never has any issues with DPS, so we always prefer the shammy.
<br />

<br />
Also, don't lose sight of the value of those shaman buffs.  Focus + Boar + Wrulan + FA make a big difference.  Maybe you don't need them if you're in Time gear.  Not being in Time gear myself, I couldn't say.  For me, they make a big difference.
<br />

<br />

<br />
In hard LDONs or GOD trials, I think an &quot;almost as good&quot; slow is not adequate.  IMO, every 1% more the mob is slowed makes a big honkin difference when the mob hits in the 1K range.</span></td>

From reading it (and re-reading so as to really understand what people were saying)  and others, the encounters are different from what has typically been experenced in EQ.  This has caused some of the classes to be less useful (and in single groups trials to be detrimental).  Hense many classes are clamoring to find ways to make themselves more useful in these situations.  I have seen these types of threads on the Palidin, Bard and now Shaman boards.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Personally I rarely group with shamans - in many places they are not up to the healing load except as a secondary healer, and the slow isn't really that big a deal - 70% is not all that huge of a difference from the 53% I have as a bard, or the 65% that chanters get (not sure % on beastlord slow but that's sufficient too, and DPS blows away shaman).  That plus I don't think shaman DPS is even as good as cleric DPS for short fights - most of their damage seems to be from longish dots, and their DD's are VERY weak.
<br />

<br />
Generally cleric is preferred due to rez, rebuffage, group heals, and cheal, and their DD's are almost equivalent to druids, esp. if a chanter is tashing.  Believe it or not, the summoned hammer can also do some pretty nice damage with its procs.  Sometimes if a paladin is in the group, a &quot;secondary&quot; healer is sufficient, depending on what we're doing.
<br />

<br />
Of course the shaman melee/hp buffs and slow are useful, but I'd say better DPS and healing on druids + evac capabilities give druids a slight edge, of course dependent upon what one is attempting.</span></td>

For me, chanter wins.  Shammy spot heals are irrelevant 99% of the time if the main healer is paying attention.  Bard can cover mez sure, but a chanter typically can do it better, freeing you up to do other things.  Need I mention the gutwreching DPS a chanter can add to a group by charming?

More DPS is always good.  It always stacks.  Beastlords also buff about as well as shamans, and Ferocity is better than FA.  Shamans can buff AGI higher than BST, but AGI's value is widely debated and Wrulan widely regarded as a waste of a buff slot.  A Beastlord can cap most melees stats, or close enough, even in Bazaar gear.  Paragon is extremely nice.

<br />

<br />
Let's look at 50% mitigated slows on a mob that triples for 1k with an unslowed delay of 20 (hitting every 2 seconds).  I don't know what GoD trial mobs hit for, as I have yet to buy Gates, so let me know if this would be a poor example.
<br />

<br />
Shaman = 37.5% slowed.  Mob delay 32 hitting every 3.2 seconds.
<br />
Enchanter = 35% slowed.  Mob delay 31 hitting every 3.1 seconds
<br />
Beastlord = 32.5% slowed, mob delay 30 hitting every 3.0 seconds.
<br />

<br />
Or, if you prefer DPS numbers, this mob is 1500DPS as a baseline...
<br />

<br />
Shaman slowed: 937 DPS
<br />
Enchanter slowed: 975DPS
<br />
Beastlord slowed: 1012DPS
<br />

<br />
On lesser damaging mobs the gap is much smaller, BSTs generally can get a mob slowed faster than shaman as well, so the overall damage output for the mob over the course of the fight will be very similar, especially for shorter fights (which is the trend these days).  The more the tank mitigates a mob's damamge output, the less of a gap there is as well.  But shamans get Malo(s) and Beastlords don't, you say?  How much does that matter in your group with a bard?  How about the 5sec cast time on Malos?  More time a totally unslowed mob is pounding your MT.  Is the beastlord able to offset that 75 point difference in mob DPS by increasing the DPS of the group significantly more than a shaman can(remember Ferocity is more attack than FA, not to mention the beastlord's own DPS)?  Probably.  Shaman can add DPS with DOTs, you say?  Disease DOTs take so long to do anything that they're only useful for soloing, poison DOTs generate so much aggro that you have to wait a good while before casting them, and using more than one almost guarantees you're tanking the rest of the fight (shamans are not necros, they can't FD off their poison counter aggro).  But shamans can nuke... yes, the worst of any priest or caster class.
<br />

<br />
Sure, there are some group compositions that benefit greatly from a shaman.  There are many many more where a shaman adds little or nothing.  The healing upgrades are a bandaid, it's the game design philosophy that's outdating the class.  The more the game drifts towards high DPS short fights, the less a shaman has a place in it.  It's good for a class to replaceable.  It's not good if another class is typically a better choice.</span></td>

Perhaps its just my personal opinion but it’s a minority of Druid or Shamans that seem to be vocal about wanting to be a healer, my question to them is always why?

<br />
As stated already, most druids are soloists and don't have good grouping skills.
<br />

<br />
Chanter haste is nice, but with bard haste, item haste and shammy haste, you can get pretty high up there anyway.  They can nuke, but guess what, they are too busy doing CC to matter most times.  They have a pet that is basically worthless, it only attacks when the chanter is attacked, totally uncontrollable, with the exception of charmed pets.  They can give you mind candy.  Well, most people these days buy it in PoK prior to going to adventure.  I've had plenty of groups where once formed and had the adventure, temporarily unformed to allow casters to go get KEI, then returned and in we went.
<br />

<br />
Shaman has over all the best buffs hands down.  No other class has as many buffs.  HP, DEX, STR, CHA, AGI, STA, Haste.  No other class slows as well per level.  They also have good pets, better than good when they buff em up.  They are not reliant on KEI or VoQ, they can canni and self heal.  A good shaman is quite perferable, IMO.
<br />

<br />
Oh, don't forget there are a LOT of poor excuses for enchanters, and a poor enchanter is a death bringer waiting to happen.
<br />

<br />
Turgur's Insects: lvl 51 shammy slow, ranges from 66% to 75% slow.  That means mobs are slowed by 2/3 to 3/4 their normal attack speeds.  So, a mob delay of 32 becomes 53.12 at low end or 56 at high end.  2/3rds possible damage mitigated to 75% possible damage mitigated.
<br />

<br />
Put into pure damage numbers, if we allow that the mob hits no matter what for 1000hp damage each landed swing with a delay of 32 and hits each swing (far fetched but let's go with it) then a battle lasting 32 seconds (all this is highly arbitrary) means that the mob would have hit a total of 10 times doing 10000damage.  Using just the low end of the Turgur's insects that damage is reduced automatically from 10000 to 3333damage.  High end it would be reduced to 2500 damage.

<br />
In my experience, group with a shammy has considerably less downtime than group without a shammy.  Neither group tends to die disproportionately--i.e., neither group has issues with the heals being adequate per se.  But the shammy free group needs med breaks where the shammy having group does not.
<br />

<br />
I attribute this to two things:
<br />

<br />
1st, those irrelevant spot heals reducing the burden on the primary healer's mana.
<br />
2nd, the difference in slow effectiveness.
<br />

<br />
Neither an enchanter nor a beastlord can provide those spot heals or a slow of equal capacity.  
<br />

<br />
Additionally, I am unconvinced by the argument that shammy DPS sucks.  Maybe it's because I'm in the same room with our shammy, but we have a regular drill established under which she VPs an add and starts dotting it early.  She gets a lot of value out of those dots.
<br />

<br />
Also, as an aside, the same argument you make about why Malo is a bad factor to consider -- delay during which you have an unslowed mob -- also cuts against an enchanter's slow utility.  I have watched enchanters who try to slow in hard LDONs or GOD trials without tashing first.  With shocking regularity, the pattern is: slow bounces and chanter dies before anyone even knows what hit him.  Robes crumple like tin foil.  So they tash first, then wait a sec, then slow.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">Bard can cover mez sure, but a chanter typically can do it better, freeing you up to do other things. Need I mention the gutwreching DPS a chanter can add to a group by charming? </span></blockquote> 
<br />

<br />
On a two pull, how is the enchanter's mez better?  It costs me one song and about 1 second's dps every 3 ticks to keep an add iced.  That's not enough loss of my utility to justify giving up the shammy's spot heals and superior slows.  Also, arguments about a beastlord's buffs don't matter when the comparison is an enchanter -- so we also give up shammy buffs to save me that one song + 1 second's DPS.
<br />

<br />
In hard LDON or GOD instanced zones, I refrain from bringing 3 or more pulls.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">There are many many more where a shaman adds little or nothing. </span></blockquote> 
<br />

<br />
I think this is the key spot where we part ways.  Maybe you spend a lot of time in groups where the shammy really does add little or nothing.  I generally don't find myself in perfect or even well-balanced groups.  I find myself in groups of whichever friends happen to be online.  As I say, I absolutely despise having to go fishing for a specific class to fill out a group.  
<br />

<br />
So, for me, the overall versatility of the shaman is indispensable.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>   As I see it, the difficulty with Clerics isn't that they are the best healers, but that they have too many supplemental abilities which are irreplaceable.
<br />

<br />
   For example, let's say your only Wisdom caster is a Shaman.  While Shaman get a variety of good buffs, the major buff (hp/ac) is the province of the Cleric.  Nothing a Shaman does can match a Cleric's performance in this area.  But why not give the Shaman a buff that- while not as good as Virtue- is reasonably close, and doesn't stack with Virtue?  This means that if you're in a group with only a Shaman, you'd have more hit points than if you were in a group with only a Cleric.  But you'd have even more if you were with both.
<br />

<br />
   Or consider Divine Arbitration.  Let's imagine we give this ability to Monks.  Now, Monks would never get a group invite because they were going to be the main healer.  Equalizing life totals is great- but somewhat pointless when you don't have any group heals to back it up.  But put a Monk in the same group with a Paladin, and suddenly a Druid healer doesn't look that bad.  The Monk can cover the emergencies Arbitration is useful for, the Paladin can group heal to recover from the Arbitration, and the Druid can function as the main healer.
<br />

<br />
   How about percent runes?  We could give Enchanters a better, non-stackable, percent rune than Clerics receive, and replace the unuseably bad Nillipus/Song of Shields with percent runes for Bards.  So if you just had a Cleric, you'd be pretty well off.  But if you had Enchanter + Druid or Bard + Druid, you'd have solid mitigation to help out your weaker healing.
<br />

<br />
   Or how about adding 'Healing Focus, Complete Heal excluded' to songs like Rizlona's and Call of the Muse?  Such an effect wouldn't be particularly helpful for Clerics (who tend to outheal damage anyway), but it would be an enormous equalizer for Shaman/Druids.
<br />

<br />
   Essentially, you give non-healing classes abilities that can bolster the Shaman/Druid sufficiently that they can operate as main healer in high level content, but designed so that they only minimally bolster a Cleric.  The Cleric would still be the better healer and a more convienient group slot.  But if you picked the right mixture of other classes, you'd be able to get away with a 'lesser' healer, because they'd have the right abilities to cover the gaps.

Clericking is a long, hard road, we pay for our abilities in a lot of ways, the least of which is the complete and total inability to solo.

I'm not saying that a cleric should have a complete monopoly on group healing, but there has to be a reason to keep them around.  They provide little else but the best healing, and often the most healing experience.

Moreover, so what exactly is the problem here? Are druids and shammies not getting groups? I don't think so. Can they not fill in for a cleric in hard LDON? Well, a druid can, and I like having shammies along anyways in hard.

It's a paradox. Druids and shammies bring a lot to groups, but are often not desired because of their healing abilities. Many people don't play with pickup groups but at such a low lvl i have to. Haven't you ever sent a tell to someone and they respond, &quot;Do you have a cleric?&quot; sometimes i respond, &quot;well we've got 2 spots open not including yours so if one goes lfg we'll get him, if not though we have a druid who can heal&quot; usually they laugh and tell me to respond if they find a cleric.

<br />

<br />
Parse those dots and see what they're actually doing.  Those dots also stand a good chance of breaking root unless the shaman is using all dots with no initial DD.  Additionally, if the mobs summons this isn't a very wise strategy.  How does your tank find pulling the mobs off the shaman afterwards?

<br />
This is more a function of gear than class in today's EQ.  The gap between haves and have-nots is large and copious amounts of hit points are on everything at the higher end.  My friend's chanter is in a guild that farms VT and is 1 kill from EPs.  Far from uber gear but... my shaman is a Bazaar Wonder as I am in a friends-and-family guild that raids stuff like Chardok and CoM.   The chanter has notably more HP than my shaman, and with runes is far better at taking a pounding.

<br />

<br />
Bard has to re-mez more often.  Are you never resisted on a re-mez?  I don't have ancient mez myself, and probably never will.  I wouldn't be so quick to discount the value of whatever song you're dropping, either.  And again, the difference in shaman and chanter slows is not generally noticeable.
<br />

<br />
Shaman buffs are readily available in PoK, are you so willing to give up only FA to forego a chanter's charmed mob DPS, superior CC, and superior haste?
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">I think this is the key spot where we part ways. Maybe you spend a lot of time in groups where the shammy really does add little or nothing.

As I say, I absolutely despise having to go fishing for a specific class to fill out a group. </span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
I think you're probably right.  You see, I generally play with my friends also.  It so happens that the group consists of a 2box warrior-wizard, a ranger, a chanter, a cleric, and (til recently) my shaman.  I found I was able to contribute much more as a bard.  But even still: when that group isn't available, my GF and I log on my bard and her ranger, we grab a plate tank of any type, a cleric or druid, and 2 dps, and we go.  If we need heavier slows than requiem of time, BST and ENC can provide it, and a ton more DPS than a shaman.  After 120 days /played on my shaman, they don't usually even make my list unless it's an /lfg friend or guildy.  Sad but true.

<br />
True certainly, but IMO not a valid comparison.  Enchanters are silk classes, shammies are chain classes.  With equivalent gear, therefore, shammies should always be able to take more abuse than enchanters.
<br />

<br />
Agreed a VT-geared enchanter can take more damage than a bazaar shaman.  Run the test between a VT-geared enchanter and a VT-geared shaman though -- I suspect shammy will win.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Of course I'm resisted.  But Lullaby lasts longer than a regular bard buff.  Every once in a while I drop a second song for one cycle as I have to resing mez.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">I wouldn't be so quick to discount the value of whatever song you're dropping, either.</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
&quot;Whatever song&quot; almost invariably means Warsong of Zek.  So, on this hypothetical, the question really boils down to this:
<br />

<br />
Is the loss of Warsong of Zek for under half of the time the group spends meleeing (I generally don't pull triples, and can do my full twist once we finish the first mob and start on the second) more harmful to the group's overall success than the loss of a shaman's superior slow and spot heal capacity.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">And again, the difference in shaman and chanter slows is not generally noticeable</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
I'm not sure you meant the word &quot;noticeable&quot; literally, but I will nevertheless seize on it :P.  One may not notice the difference in the slows, but it's there and it's affecting the group's long-term efficiency.  As I say--groups without the shammy tend to run oom and need med breaks, while groups with the shammy just don't.
<br />

<br />
Maybe my experience is atypical.  
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">Shaman buffs are readily available in PoK, are you so willing to give up only FA to forego a chanter's charmed mob DPS, superior CC, and superior haste? </span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
1.  Bought KEI lasts longer than bought Focus &amp; other buffs.  A bought KEI can easily last 2 adventures, 3 if we're fast.  Not so shammy buffs.  Not to mention blessing of replenishment and FA.
<br />

<br />
2.  Chanter charmed mob DPS is very very situational.  Maybe I have not grouped with the best charmers, but most of the chanters I group with tend to take the position that they WILL charm if we need it to win, but they prefer not to because the risk and chaos factor is so high.
<br />

<br />
3.  Superior CC is marginal as discussed above.
<br />

<br />
4.  Superior haste is also marginal.  Even if shammy never casts haste, most people I group with have either 36% or 41% haste items.  Isn't SLTW 60%?  So, at the abolutely maximum, superior chanter haste adds 4% haste.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Fair enough.  Nobody on this board is likely to argue that shaman &gt; bard :P.
<br />

<br />
I also accept the proposition that you don't want to boot either your enchanter friend or your ranger friend.  But wouldn't the group perform better in the long run if you did?  Query:
<br />

<br />
What happens when the cleric dies?  Unlucky heal agro, bad placement, whatever -- the cleric dies.  What do y'all do?  What we do is keep killing with the shammy on heals, then have the pally rez the cleric back in.  I see 0 backup heals in your standard configuration.
<br />

<br />
Wouldn't the group perform better if everyone had Focus, Boar, Wrulan, and Blessing of Replenishment running 24/7?  Wouldn't that ranger pump out more damage with FA?
<br />

<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">After 120 days /played on my shaman</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
Meaning zero disrespect whatsoever, our group's shaman recently topped 320 days /played.  Our different assessments of the shaman's value may have something to do with play style.  I know ours is very adept at being a mana efficient spot healer, keeping everyone in the proper buffs, and putting out pretty d*mn respectable DPS.  I have no reason whatever to believe you didn't play your shaman quite well--maybe ours just plays exceptionally well, or integrates with our play style exceptionally well.  Who knows.
