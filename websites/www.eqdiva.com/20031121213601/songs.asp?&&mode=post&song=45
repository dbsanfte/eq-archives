This song, however, actually lasts long enough to be effective - I am current;y level 41, and if I charm a mob and have it attack a similiar leveled mob(38-39), I can usually kill off the target before my charm breaks, then I can just fear kite my remaining (and now weakened) former pet :)</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>Great fun - </b>2/25/03 6:21:41 PM<br>~ <b>Offkee</b><blockquote>I love this song. I am a level 61 bard on the Saryrn server and sometimes charm kite in Skyfire for boredom easy AA xp. This charm was lasting far longer then 18secs as in the description, and generally the way i charm kite is charm mob A. target mob B and send pet in to attack. while still targeted on Mob B kick on a chain song of your preference. Leave chain song going nonstop while hitting F1 twice to select pet. wait for charm to break. This has worked great for me as when charm breaks only one mob has a chance of getting near me to attack, and my pet can go through two other mobs before it's low enough on HP to kill it. I generally fear kite the pet, and I never let the pet be charmed when mob B is about to die, I will kick on invis song or hide, to break my charm, and then Nuke/chant kite the almost dead mob until it's dead and i can recharm my pet. I'm sure others have better strategies, but this works well for me. I generally kill the Mature chromodrachs and lavawalker type mobs. And get about 1 blue for every 4-5mobs of AA, maybe more, i'll have to watch more closely. AA run 3 is helpful for the chromo's that like to dispel, but you can always avoid those if need be, and usually right before i charm my pet, i kick on the level 49 selos that last for two minutes which has always been plenty long enough to last me through the fight. Good luck my fellow bards!<br><br>Offkee, 61 Virtuoso of Saryrn</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Lasts way longer than 18 seconds (3 ticks) - </b>1/8/03 1:10:18 AM<br>~ <b>Syreen</b><blockquote>This song is a lifesaver. It does not charm &quot;up to 18 seconds,&quot; it lasts for minutes. Maybe 2 or 3 minutes, I haven't timed it. Maybe it is Charisma dependant, my CHA is 124. Anytime I get adds, I use this song on the mob I'm already working on and turn it into a pet, then sic it on the add (the charmed critter will actually immediately fight whatever is hitting you, completely taking the attention off you while they beat each other up, so you really don't have to &quot;sic it&quot; on the add in this case). If you make the mistake of charming the add, the one you were beating on will continue to beat on you for quite some time, at least untill your pet has outdamaged you. Trust me on this, charm the one that is most P.O.'d at you, the one you were working on when the add came along. The best way to use it is to charm a mob, sic it on another mob, then help your pet kill the mob with Tuyens Chants. When the target mob turns, slow it with Selo's Consonant Chain.<br><br>     It is important NOT to hit your target critter with any songs or melee yourself until AFTER your charmed pet has started whacking on it. This way, the aggro is on your pet from the start, meaning the mob isn't chasing you and your pet chasing it. If charm breaks, re-charm your former pet and sic it back on the target, then slow the target with Selo's Consonant Chain, as the target will be chasing you now. Just keep the target slowed and your pet will whack it from behind. I have had up to 3 HG's beating on my pet in Rathe Mountains, instead of beating on me. When HG's went green at 51, I went to Eastern Wastes and charmed Manticores to do my bidding. Manticores make GREAT pets, I ran around killing up to 5 mobs per Manticore, I just let the manticore chase me once charm broke while I tracked a new victim... when the manticore was about to catch up, I charmed it again and sic'd it on the mob I'd tracked. Tell your charmed pet to sit down immediately after the kill and loot your mob. Keep your distance from it. You don't want charm breaking with it right next to you.<br><br>One further tip, always know where your manticore is, and don't let it hit you. Mine hit me once, poisoned me for about 700-800 HP over time. In a day of hunting, that was the only time I had to put down my trusty drum and strum my guitar.<br><br>Syreen Valkyrja, 51 Bard, Xegony</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
