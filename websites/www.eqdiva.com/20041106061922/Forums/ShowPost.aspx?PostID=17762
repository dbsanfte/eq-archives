At one time banded and bronze was serious twinking.  Given different prices on bazaar goodies the amount of plat really doesn't tell you anything.  I'm thinking it would be more along the lines of how long it will last.  If a toon has gear that will last till the mid 50's that would be serious twinking.  If the gear's good till the mid teens thats barely twinking at all.

What's your opinion?

we have all seen undergeared folks kick serious butt, and folks twinked to the gills who couldnt play thier class worth squat.  Twinking is not a problem, its the person behind the toon that can piss you off.

I have no problems with seeing a level 15 bard with a TDoK, white Dragon helm, CoF, and all Diety armor.  As long as that person is having fun, and not ruining other people's fun, more power to em.  I do have a twinge of anger at them having that gear, but that is more envy then anything else.  I didnt access to the kind of gear folks do know, its a vastly different game now.  There are very few true newbs anymore, and almost every character you see below 50 is someone's alt</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>The issue from twinking was that it would give people an advantage over people that are just starting.  I know that isnt a big deal now but about three years ago you couldnt find a message board that didnt have at least one post complaining about a twink dailey.
<br />

<br />
Now its the reversed.   On alot of the old servers people who want to start will find that they are there swinging A Short Sword* for 1 or 2 damage while another level one standing next to you is doing 10 damage every swing and killing things like its nothing.
<br />

<br />
I spend some nights in Gfay to reminisce about the old days.  That was my starting city as well as it was the the /auction zone on Tunare.  On an average night there would be 100+ people buying and selling this zone.  I would put a bunch of gear not worth selling in the baz but worth not destroying in my packs and run laps around the starting areas in Gfay, Ak and BBM.  If I happen to find a newb that is not completely twinked that tells me they are thinking of switching servers I give them a couple items to get started.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Generally I find the people who complain most vociferously about twinking/powerlevelling fit into three categories:
<br />

<br />
1.  Die hard roleplayers
<br />
2.  Broke people
<br />
3.  People who think twinks/powerlevelled chars don't know how to play their character.
<br />

<br />
Frankly I feel that the game should be played by everyone in whatever fashion they desire.  If that includes spending 1 million plat on gear for their new Berserker, so be it.  If they want to powerlevel him up to 65 in 1 day using their 4 other accounts, more power to them.
<br />

<br />
If they want to dye their character in as many eye searing dayglo colors they can find, or roleplay as a Klingon wizard, that is also their perogative.
<br />

<br />
Number 3 above is the only one that really deserves some attention, since in many cases it is true.  However, there are many people who have played this game long enough that picking up a new class does NOT take a year of grinding slowly through 65 levels.  Also, depending on personality and intelligence, many people will do some serious research on a class before playing them, either via Castersrealm/Lucy or via boards such as this one.  Plus, many of the better players already have a good idea of the roles and responsibilities of the other classes they are grouped with, giving them a head start on learning that class.  Granted, these factors do not give you the reflexes necessary to know exactly what to do in any given situation, but it gives you an enormous advantage over the newbie with the Yantis-bought Time-geared beastlord.  
<br />

<br />
Also, interestingly enough, many classes become far easier to play at 65 than they are prior to that, because spell choices narrow down to a select few, often superceding several inferior previous spells.  Or certain 61-65 spells are just so good that you will almost always have them in your lineup, making the alternatives less attractive and more situational.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I recently started a Monk, and since I had some spare plat, decided to twink him some.  While choosing my armor for twinkage, I thought a lot about the philosophy of twinking, and wish I had written down those thoughts at the time.  Note: I include in the term Twink, anyone that powerlevels a character up, as the goal is basically the same.
<br />

<br />
I have two problems with twinking, one of which is my problem, and the other of which could easily be theirs, and everyone they meet as well.
<br />

<br />
The first problem I have is basic jealousy.  My main is my bard, and at level 56 I don't have wads of plat sitting around to just throw away.  When I see a character in their 20s wearing 100Kpp in twink armor, I get jealous. I wish I had that much plat, not for my alt chars, but just plainly for my main.  But this isn't their problem, it is mine, and I need to deal with it.
<br />

<br />
The second problem, and the one that lead me to such depths of philosophy when I did twink (to the impressive amount of 300pp! <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-4.gif" border="0" alt="Tongue out" hspace="2" /> ) is that so much of this game is premised upon taking time through those lower levels to work on the skills you need.  These days, you level at more than twice the rate of when the game first came out.  But the rate of skill advancement, particularly in those skills that you can't boost with skill points (defense, offence, dodge, parry etc.) has not changed.  Twinking, and powerleveling just accelerate the leveling process without doing anything, or even hurting the skill advancement process.  It no longer takes you a year to reach 65 even with normal play.  My bard is only 6 months old, and I haven't played all that hard, since I have college classes I still have to deal with as well as a full time job.  My played time is now approaching the amount of time I spent on other, earlier characters on other servers and I am nearly twice their level!
<br />

<br />
The person who twinks has already shown impatience with the lower levels.  The reason they twinked and powerleveled is to get past the &quot;boring lower levels.&quot;   I can understand and respect that.  But it also shows that they are not likely to have the patience to work on their skills properly.  I am reminded of the time when I ran into a level 35 SK in OT and grouped with him, twice (unfortunately).  When asked to pull he said he couldn't since his defence was only 50!  (yes 50, when it should have been 180) The cleric was having to heal him way more than needed, and just having him in hte party slowed us all down in our leveling.  We asked him why it was so low, and he said that he had been powerleveled.  Even if you buff your character to all the glories and back, you sill need a considerable period of time being hit to raise the defensive skills.  You CAN help this along by taking the time early on and deliberately get hit a lot, but a person who twinks/powerlevels has already show a shortness of patience.  I can't trust them to have taken the time to work on their skills which are needed to make their character effective.  This same thing goes for casters, and the spell skills take the same amount of time, in even more boring situations of just casting and casting AND then going out and getting hit.
<br />

<br />
This is why I don't like twinks, I just can't trust them to have done even a decent job at creating their character.

bards on the other hand if someone has never played a bard, go die and learn what not to do as well as what to do before you twink that bard.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I don't really see anything wrong with twinking alts.
<br />

<br />
BUT
<br />

<br />
I think if someone's first character is twinked (by a friend that plays or what have you) then they are missing out on a lot of what makes this game fun and gives our characters... character.
<br />

<br />
I dunno if the experience was the same for everyone else, but I remember collecting that full set of cloth armour from the orcs, then slowly upgrading each piece to leather... then replacing that leather with studded leather.  I remember oggling the bronze plate in freeport and wondering, &quot;How on earth do you save up that much plat?&quot;
<br />

<br />
I remember dragging my friends to all over Norath on giant boats that took forever to show up so that we could maybe get 1 drop for 1 piece of my lambent set.  I remember camping the PGT for a day, and hangin out in EC lookin for what I could buy with 100 plat.  I remember finally getting all of the lambent armour (except the BP actually).
<br />

<br />
Around that time I was in my 40s and the Bazaar had just arrived.  I remember toiling in DL and saving up to replace my lambent piece by piece with singing steel.  I remember spending hours preparing and participating in Vox raids on the off chance I might win something.
<br />

<br />
So, I'm rambling.  The point is, this all might have been frustrating at times.  But it was also fun, and definately memorable.  You just don't get that sort of history with a twinked newbie or an alt.  No character I start will mean anything close to what Hackworth does... to me anyway.  </span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Ah.. twinking....
<br />

<br />
Well, Hackworth, my first character was twinked.  I didn't know I was twinked.  All I knew was a friend of a friend was working on tailoring.  My third day I had a full set of Wu's for my monk.  I had no clue that monks at level 1 shouldn't have Wu's armor (this was 2 months before Luclin came out).
<br />

<br />
Now, looking back, I'm glad I had that buffer, as I don't think I would have stuck with EQ given the rules at that time.  I remember thinking that I would die if I had no food or water (I took those messages very seriously).  But the rules were differnent then.  And today, I don't bother even looking at peoples' gear.   Why?  because I can usually get an indication of how well they play by grouping with them.
<br />

<br />
Bards are a new class to me, although I've tried them several times over the last 2 years.  And finally I think I understand the game well enough, that I can play a bard decently.  I took 2500 pp, bought LDON armor, HP rings and some decent waepons (not too good else my weapon skills would suffer) and some decent instruments and went to town.
<br />

<br />
I've bookmarked EQDiva as part of my daily reading, try to remember which song uses which instrument and learn about the various kiting methods.
<br />

<br />
Sure, I have more HPs and more AC then most bards at 18, but I want to focus on twisting, not worrying if I'm going to be killed.  I want to see what a song does in a situation, even if I risk the chance of dying.  I want the chance to work on the things I think make the difference between a great bard and the rest.  
<br />

<br />
Will I get there? who knows. But last night on the other side of the ridge, I had to practice mezzing and kiting and learned alot even if I did die 3x times.
<br />

<br />
I don't expect my 2500 to last past my 30s, but if it does, great.  All I know is that I am enjoying my bard, enough that I want to play and be the best bard I can be.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>I'll admit to having my bard twinked at his current level, but I've twinked him just enough to tank a little longer to develop his offensive/defensive skills and to not get crushed when practicing how to twist songs while fighting.  But in regards, to how acceptable twinking is...  I think it depends on the player behind the toon.  Like somebody said in an earlier post, those who twink/p-level without paying mind to developing the essential combat skills is unacceptable, but those who twink and still spend the time to learn their characters ability is acceptable.  Take it as you will, there are always going to be bad toons out there who are guaranteed to get you killed, you just gotta watchout for them.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I am twinked with about 16k in gear.  I collected it doing LDoN with my cleric (65.177 over 3.4 years) and decided to start a new class from the ground up.  As a cleric I was addicted to grouping, but as I love questing I was hampered by the cleric class itself.  Bards are MUCH more versatile and I do not regret this choice at all.  
<br />

<br />
Since I love grouping I took my cleric and bard at level 1 to Paludal caverns, invited 5 other noobies buffed em all with temp, gave them basic instructions (hit each mob once) and proceeded to train them with Mark of the Righteous.  After 4 hours we were all level 24/23 (sk class).  I still group with most of these people (it has been only 3 weeks after all).
<br />

<br />
My point is that with the right gear an attitude and a willingness to help others you can really have a lot of fun.  The constant dinging wears off quickly as you learn your class, do the research and ask advice from the long term bards who reside here.  While most is good advice, having been a cleric for a long time also makes you glean a bunch of stuff from your own experience.  Leveling up these days is really too easy but only if you know all the things learned from ages ago and retained them.
<br />

<br />
Having a cleric as PL machine also eliminates fear of dying.  Now that I am 55 I can group with him and do all those quests (double a lot) for both characters at the same time.
<br />

<br />
Twinking has made me appreciate a sometimes misunderstood and often confused class (most newer players wont risk a bard/druid CC heal team over a cleric enchanter) and a much happier cleric with the help i can give to myself for questing.  Regardless of questing I still love grouping more than any solo thing and I still HoV every group I join where I can.
<br />

<br />
I am not trying to buy anyone's favour.  Just helping guarantee that the entire group benefits to the max from having a twinked bard in their group with an ever-close-by guardian angel.
<br />

<br />
Is this acceptable twinking?  I don't know.  I do know though that not once was the help offered by my cleric not appreciated.  I have more fun now in EQ than ever before, and all the people on this board are very helpful to my queries.  I am guilty of one thing a previous poster in this thread posted.  Long held assumptions and expectations.  Some players do not have all HP or Mana gear and so their mana pool will run out a lot faster or they crumple in a 4pull.  Not having a fear of death/dying is not a universal trait<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />  However a great deal of patience I have in abundance and almost without fail most groupees love advice or an explanation as to why things are the way they are, wrt game mechanics.  Expectations that people should know how to play their class at 50 55 60 65 have to be tossed out since it is way too easy to get there.  Just the odd tip here and there and a /tell discussion will often yield a way more positive grouping experience for everyone if every one sees value in the change.

Too many times I have come across powerlevling people and was either TOTALLY ignored, or was ordered (or sternly asked) to move elsewhere.  I must admit that part of my deep distaste for powerlevling and twinking is a result of jealousy that is the result of 1) that I only have one char, and one account and can't PL myself and 2) that too many of the twinks/powerlevelers won't share of their bounty.

Even with all those tons of mobs, sounds like they weren't getting hit much nor were they hitting much.  I am wondering, even now, what your bard's Defense is looking like.  I know that I leveled probably too fast, even without powerleveling, and that my Def is several shades of horrible.  Is a character short on combat skills all that they can be?  This is the intellectual question that is the other side of the coin on which resides my jealousy.  
<br />

<br />
Yes, there are things you can do to conteract the short coming of not getting the skill ups the regular way.  But, with you (the twinker in general, not you specifically Reignne) having already proven your impatience how can I trust you to have taken the TIME to do those things?  There is a simple principle here: Faithful in a little, faithful in much.  By showing that you don't want to take the time to up level slow enough to get your skills up, how can I know that you have taken the time to conteract your weaknesses?  And if you haven't take the time, how much can I rely on you in battle?  Like I said in my earlier post, if you can't do your role because of those weaknesses, the group, and I with them, are better off without you.

				<td colspan="2"><span>For a number of high-end players, alts are literally born out of a bag full of gear.  Friends leave the game and hand over goodies, or loot is acquired with nowhere to put it.
<br />

<br />
Virtually gone are the days where high end players can unload their lower-lvl gear on genuine noobies and lowbies.  I truely miss the enjoyment I'd get heading into Crushbone or Lfay and seeding the mobs with gear from Infected Paw, or Kunark, and eventually Velious.  Nothing like seeing the joyful shout or /ooc from a noob that's gotten a spider fur belt or cloak off a crushbone legionaire.
<br />

<br />
For a lot of high-end players, the only upgrades they're going to get are no drop.  Buyable upgrades are generally too slight to be worth paying for.  Not many would drop 100k to get 20 more HP and 2 more AC.  So with nothing really to buy for main, plat becomes fodder for tradeskilling, and if you're not into that, once you've covered the cost of your 10 pound pies and grobb liquidized meat (and Quints of Knowledge if you've got a PoK gate clicker) where else is your money going to go but to shamelessly twink an alt or two?
<br />

<br />
As mentioned above, it goes to attitude.  Personally I'm embarressed when my twinks are inspected by lower lvl characters wearing gear more suited to their level (and that's become a relative thing since Wallmart opened on the moon.)  In a way it's not fair to them to have to see that.  I don't encourage inspections on my toons.  I don't talk about my stuff.  I certainly don't lord it over other players.  That's just wrong, and the people who do do that very quickly find their way onto my never-gonna-group-with-em again list.
<br />

<br />
At the same time, don't hate somebody just because they're twinked to the hilt.  Hate 'em if they're crappy at their class or are unpleasant to group with.  I say this because although my alts didn't earn their gear themselves, I sure as h*ll did.  I lvled my bard up in leather and banded.  In my 40's I did my grinding in the Dreadlands in full lambent, swinging Icetooth Claws and a Berzerker Sword.  My first true instrument upgrade didn't come until the Nostrolo's Tambourine and boy was that a long, ugly quest back in the day, particularly the Dalnir and Kaesora part of it.  Kaesora...shudder.
<br />

<br />
I say twink as much as you can as long as it doesn't prevent you from learning the class you're playing.  If you started with a bard, then everything else is a step down in skill level and there's no excuse not to play it the best you can.

<br />
I've been playing my bard since April 2000, I played from crushbone to high hold pass... did my time in Lake rathe and in south ro against the chickens and splitpaws gnolls!
<br />
Was chased around karanas by the undead cyclops and across west karana by broon or proon whichever that is. 
<br />
Experianced the game in full every step of the way, now I'm poking my nose into every corner of the elementals. 
<br />
Now... i want to play a cleric, not because I don't intenssely love my bard, or would ever consider laying aside my bard for such a boring class but because sometimes I need a little break. Something very easy.. and boring if you will even. I find myself at times doing a little powerleveling for her. The people playing at the lower end game are not skilled groupers and I&quot;m extremely critical, I find the lower end groups anymore are frustrating at best and unproductive. So I've switched to grouping with guildies alts and powerleveling her. I feel no issues in the slow PL process I use, because I commonly play her as she's intended.. a cleric of other players her level. 
<br />

<br />
If we're talking about twinking and Powerleveling an alternate when you already have fully experianced the lower end game I'm all for it. If your power leveling a newb that wants to go play with his friends.. i sure as h*ll hope his friends aren't in my guild. Because we've slammed the door on bards that are so inexperianced their a huge detriment to the people who earned the class and level they represent. </span></td>
