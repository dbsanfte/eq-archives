				<td colspan="2"><span>Quote from patch Septembet 14th, 2004
<br />
- Bard PBAoE spells will no longer damage targets that are moving, however any other spell effects from the PBAoE spell will still be applied to the targets as usual. 
<br />

<br />
With AE kiting gone, I feel sort of cheated. I don't really have alot of time to play anymore, and AE kiting was  away for me to advance without having to commit myself to a group or try to carefully separate a spawn. I suppose it was a somewhat 'impolite'? thing to do, but MOST of us have never purposely brought on the death of another player or group while we were AE kiting... Did they change this because people were abusing it? Or was it another instance where SOE decides that something they implemented as a 'feature' suddenly being conveived as an 'exploit'? *ahem* Fear kiting into walls? Maybe I'm reading too much into it. I know that bards are versatile, and that we have many, many other ways of soloing, but why take away AE kites?

				<td colspan="2"><span>Ah, I have posted the same disappointment.  AE kiting was always so much fun because of the danger.  And it was a unique ability of the bard.  It develops some important skills that are useful in pulling.  Someone who is willing to run tight circles around 30 dark blue mobs is going to have more perceived options when a pull goes bad.
<br />

<br />
That said, I can understand why AE kiting could be an aggravation for the rest of the zone.  Once I pull 30 mobs in Dulak and am ready for the next group (immediately), I have to scour ships to just get 20 or so.  I try to be careful to not pull from areas where other groups are fighting.  
<br />

<br />
I think that Sony made a mistake here.  AE kiting was a wonderful challenge and a way for bards to sporadically jump start their progression.  With proper etiquette, it is not overly expoitative.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>..Not to mention the fact that AoE kiting was the only purpose for Chords of Dissonance et. al.  SOE doesn't SERIOUSLY expect us to believe it was intended in any way, shape or form for crowd control/aggro-focusing, do they?
<br />

<br />
Not that I could ever get the 30-range PBAoEs to hit all the critters in the kite (lvl 52 bard) on a consistent basis (never mind resists).  It was certainly exciting to hit a lag spike while kiting.... My question is now, how long before SOE changes the mana-free charm, or charm-kiting in general?

				<td colspan="2"><span>Some are dissapointed....problem is some is a few when there are 15 bards per server, and maybe 2 of them area kited.
<br />

<br />
SONY needs to evaulate risk vs. reward.   They need to do a better job planning their nerfs.  Calling something a problem is ridiculous if it really does not happen in reality.  Area kiting did not needed to be nerfed, simply because it was not the disturbance some crack smokers claimed.  
<br />

<br />
How about some kind of rule Sony, maybe you need some kind of checks and measures to see if the pre nerf is worse situation than the post nerf.  Yay...a few Bards no longer area kite....big F deal.
<br />

<br />
What has this done for ya&gt;??  How big a problem was it?  You fixed something that was chicken sh*t in the big picture of this game.
<br />

<br />
You broke something that was 6 songs out of our songbook.  You failed this time in evaluating risk vs. reward.   What did you get from this....only Sony can answer this one.  What did you lose...again Sony has to answer this one.
<br />

<br />
Seems pretty clear to me that the nerf was pointless.  Gang up on 2 people per server to nerf an entire class out of 6 songs in every situation...it is being proved that the songs are just plain back of the book useless now.
<br />

<br />
What was the benifit of the nerf again?? Nothing has changed the method has changed,(big experince somewhere else) but not a freaking cash paying eq member has noticed anything change.  
<br />

<br />
Wait the dude getting all the mobs solo is now taking advantage of the bards nerf...less competition to wipe the zone of every mob solo.
<br />

<br />
Your make believe problem was sold to you by a pimply kid on his first project at SONY...any seasoned employee would have seen the big picture on this one and left it alone as a non issue.  I laugh that you bought into the crap story in the first place.
<br />

<br />
If this nerf affected 50% of the game due to the same 2 per server area kiting,,,,and maybe 2 out of 50 servers 2 that cause disruptions....think the nerf would have been a priority.
<br />

<br />
Druids have at least 2 knobs per server....think that that class will see two knobs get an entire ability nerfed due to there stupidness.  Not likely...it would be a non issue. 
<br />

<br />
The ability to kite 50 mobs is overpowered.....then why did hardly anybody do it?  Nothing can be called overpowered unless alot of people are doing it...this making sense??
<br />

<br />
How the F--- can you with a straight face call something unballanced and ovwerpowered if NOBODY does it!!!!  2 or 3 is nobody.

Head check yet again....SOMETHING was making the majority of the bards choose not to do this...if it was soo goood and broken WHY did nobody do it&gt;&gt;&gt;WHY!!!
<br />

<br />
BECAUSE the experience was not worth the risk vs reward!!!  You can get to 65-70 in 20 hours grouped....why the h*ll would I spend 75 hours area kiting????  
<br />

<br />
It was CHOICE you took away from the sometimes non raiding, non grouping, has a real life, got an hour to play, want to solo for a quick hour, want to be able to unplug the game and do something else without screwing your group over.  Bards do what makes sense....and NOT everyone area kited...it was not OVERPOWERED&gt;  
<br />

<br />
You could have banned people for 1 week even and taken care of this 1 in a million problem bard.  Screw everyone instead of tuning up a handfull of people for a week of ban.  Idiots!!

				<td colspan="2"><span>Moose, your entire post is anchored by the supposition that 2 or 3 bards per server AE kite.
<br />

<br />
That is a supposition that has no basis in fact, you have no means to obtain 100% accurate information as to how many bards are on each server, how many bards on each server AE kite, and how often do those bards AE kite.
<br />

<br />
People had issue with bards AE kiting, that is a verifiable fact.
<br />

<br />
A Bard AE Kiting 50 mobs caused server lag, that is a verifiable fact.
<br />

<br />
SOE said they were going to &quot;fix the issue&quot;, and presented thier solution, that is a fact.
<br />

<br />
Bards here, at TCH, and on the EQ Bard forums said that solution sucked, and offered alternatives.  SOE then revised thier &quot;fix&quot; to better suit thier customers, that is a fact.
<br />

<br />
SOE cant make all the people happy all of the time.  They try to make a game that keeps most of the people happy most of the time.  They dont code EQ for Moose.  They code EQ for the other 500,000 subscribers en masse.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I believe that it is safe to assume that the percentage of bards who primarily AE kited to level or AA is pretty small.  But there are 6 65+ bards in my guild alone.  Whenever I do a /who all 65 70 Bard on my server in primetime, I always run out of room, so there are more then 20.  I know a lot of them, I helped a lot of them when they were wee bardlings.  I know that problaby 25% of the bards that I know that are 65+ AE kited to level or get AAs for a large portion of thier bard existance.  
<br />
It is a lot more then 2 or 3 per server unless you are just talking about the Zeks.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Point #1 -- If no other class CAN kill 40 mobs at one time like AE kiting can, then AE kiting is overpowered no matter how many do it.
<br />

<br />
Point #2 -- I know for a fact that more than &quot;2 or 3&quot; bards used AE kiting on Luclin server.  Try a dozen or more.  I have no reason to think my server is unusual.  Entire threads at Diva were devoted to AE kiting with many participants.  I freely admit it is hard.  I freely admit it isn't something everyone can do.  But I also remember creating a newbie bard on a new server about a year ago and watching in amazement as another bard ran out, killed 5 bats, memmed Chords of Dissonance, and then proceeded to kite every mob in the Freeport newbie zone, to the dismay of about 15 other newbies there.  Sony had an obligation to make that stop happening.  You can say their solution is bad but you cannot say they weren't justified in trying to eliminate the practice.
<br />

<br />
Point #3 -- While I am not exactly thrilled with the solution, I have to give Sony props for listening to us and changing their method of applying the nerf.  I am still not sure whether or not this nerf is going to seriously impact anything other than AE kiting.  The one time I have tried Melody of Mischief in a group situation, it worked just fine with no problems sticking damage on all the mobs, even one that was rooted.  Not sure about that.
<br />

<br />
Point #4 -- So far, if you believe Moose, bards are leaving the game in droves, Diva and Concert Hall are losing all their customers, and bards are paralyzed to non-functionality.  Reality suggests everything he has posted on these subjects so far is an emotional exaggeration of fact.  The nerf is annoying.  It has had zero effect on my game so far.  It may NEVER have a negative effect on my game.  I know of NO bards who have quit because of the nerf, though we have had a whopping 3 announce at Diva that they were.  They continue to post here, however, so it's a little hard to point to message board traffic to support the claim that the class is dying.  Message board traffic is not down.  At all.
<br />

<br />
Bottom line: This nerf effectively stops a practice that, even if it wasn't widely done, wasn't necessary or desirable from an overall game balance standpoint.  Whether or not the nerf has wider reaching negative impact still remains to be determined.  But realistically, unless you DID AE kite, this nerf has ZERO impact on 99% of what you do in the game.  That's the part the loudest ranters are overlooking.</span></td>

What needs to be done to make us bards feel better is to replace those PBAoE songs with a song thats useful, so like moose says they dont get shoved into the back of the book-never to be used again. How about a song that allows me to summon some no drop arrows. Seriously though,maybe new songs to replace the old are in order, how about a song that regenerates mana for a bard(with restrictions so this song doesnt get abused like the AoE songs).</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>I got to thinking after reading about the maybe no more invis to break charm nerf on test.  The list of Bard changes is getting so long, I have trouble prioritizing which ones even are worth mentioning anymore.
<br />

<br />
Question that comes to mind.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Just what would SONY have to do to make you stop playing a Bard?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Now I know some will not want to answer this....but hey man, only you know what it would take.
<br />

<br />
Some may quit if they took away Fade?
<br />

<br />
Some maybe if we had to stop for a song to land?
<br />

<br />
I regret that some would stay NO MATTER WHAT.  Is there no limit for some?  Sony might just be on to the fact that if they please 95% of the game by taking away things that bards can do and they can't.....lots are happy and the 5% just keep on playing.
<br />

<br />
With all the take aways...botting a now played auto twist Bard WILL be that much closer to a non bot Bard...eventually all that seperates the Bot vs Real will be gone.
<br />

<br />
Hypothetically that is.  
<br />

<br />
I would estimate that we have had a 20% reduction vs other classes from this expansion.  While some are now 120% of what they were at 65..we are pretty much the same as before 105% maybe?
<br />

<br />
I think Sony knows that they can package any nerf and we will eat it smiling.
<br />

<br />
SO....go ahead...too afraid to admit that there is no limit to what would be taken away to get you to say stop it??  
<br />

<br />
Lets hear what it would take.....for some it was enough months ago...I realy want to know from the ones that will stick with the class till the end.
<br />

<br />
For me...there is no way I play a Bard if I have to stop moving to sing.  Dick with Fade too much, and that would be enough as well.
<br />

<br />
If I can only chant kite 4 crap dots at 70 solo with zero other solo options....hmm that is a tuff one.  so close to the truth, maybe it is enough...grouping at 70 might just make that one go away.

We all have limits, as you say.  Sony has to estimate what those limits are when they go about making changes.  Now, the real question is, WHY do they make changes?  If we surmise they do it because they hate us and want to make us angry and quit, then the above quote should discourage them.  If, on the other hand, they make changes that they believe are for the benefit of the overall game balance, they probably don't think too much about what we are willing to eat.
<br />

<br />
The news we just got from test is that mage/necro/shaman pets don't poof when they go invis.  This, on the surface of it, is great news.  The shaman I group with on a regular basis refers to me quite often as &quot;The Puppy Slayer&quot; for my tendency to forget I have Song of Travel in a song slot and killing his pet.  The mage in my group has not been nearly as good-humored about it.  So this specific aspect - invis not killing summoned pets - is very good news for US!
<br />

<br />
If/when someone actually confirms that this keeps us from breaking charm with invis - and I have see no confirmation of that yet - then we can bitch about having to mem dispel.  
<br />

<br />
It's a nice use for that 9th song slot.</span></td>

<br />

<br />
I just wanted to post because some of the other peoples posts here make cases to nerf other classes which probably won't happen. While still having some very good ideas and sound advice. But I'm just going to pick one for now.

<br />
Not all classes can Quad like a druid and wizard, should those be nerfed. Classes such as rogues and warriors have extreme difficult soloing, should all other soloing classes be nerfed cause they can't. This point is not a reason to nerf a class. I personally only played my bard to 53, but when in a good group it was better exp and more fun then AE kiting.

I'm not screaming about the nerf per se, it was a big deal and I am NOT pleased but it is not enough to make me quit my bard.  In fact, NO amount of nerfing to soloing, even if EVERY MOB IN THE GAME summoned and stunned and I couldn't solo anything I couldn't melee down, would be enough to make me quit my bard.  I play her because I love to group and raid.
<br />

<br />
Yes, making me stand still would make me quit.  Primarily because it would cripple me badly in terms of what i can bring to a raid or group.  Yes, messing up Fade badly would make me quit for the same reasons.  Dead on there.
<br />

<br />
Before the flames start, I know that not everyone plays that way and that some people love to solo.  Just answering the question.</span></td>

This nerf maybe will shut the mouths of all the other whiners out there who complain that bards are way overpowered.
<br />

<br />
Fact is AE Kiting requires some skill but not enough skill to make it truly hard. Anyone without alot of lag spikes can take a group of green mobs and practice on them long enough to cut the circle close enough for the AE to stick. We have so many uses for our skills, some of which require good multi tasking which is the real skilled bards forte. Another fact is alot of people just used the Auto-Cirlce and pretty much watched TV while AE kiting....I did. I dont miss it and actually stopped AE'ing before the nerf went thru. Charm Kiting is still a very effective way to lvl. Even at 66 I can pop an AA in less than an hour in PON so its not all that bad folks. In reality I dont know many solo classes who can aside from wizzy druid quadding. I am sure once I perfect the timing on charm break I could prolly do an AA in half an hour in PON. I would imagine that in better xp zone it would be even faster.
<br />
This is just my 2 cents.</span></td>

Level 60 and under yes, we are the gods of soloing, but only because we can still swarm kite.  After level 60 things change.  Oh sure you can still charm kite, but finding a group is a more effective use of your time.  You can get a solo instance of tipt which is decent AA if you can get one without a lot of ukuns or stonemites on the pull path, but your reduced to chant kiting, easy but man is it time consuming.  
<br />

<br />
Post 60, assuming the player has fire access, necros and wizards FAR out solo us.  With some of the new AA's, a good necro can make a kill every 3 minutes, banging out an aa every 35-40 minutes or so.  Wizards arent quite as effecitve, but they still kill 4 mobs at once, getting an aa every 45 minutes or so.  Now a bard can go in there, assuming they have crit afflication aa's they might get a kill every 5 minutes if they are good.  If you know how to take down 2 at once, you can make that 2 kills in 9 minutes, but that is a long time twisting, and you will want to rest afterwards.  You might get an aa in an hour and a half.</span></td>

Now, if you TRULY want class balance, then do it right.  Make ALL AE spells work the same way our songs now do (Bye bye quard kiting all you wizzies and druids).  THAT would be balance.  Show of hands as to how many people think that will happen?  I didn't think so...

				<td colspan="2"><span>Given that everything in OoW seems to summon (maybe not in HS or NC - haven't hunted there much), the timing of this decision is indeed quite odd.
<br />

<br />
Overall, I think the biggest reason for the nerf was its high visibility - and the occasional (rare) idiot who would not play nice and share a zone / camp with xp groups.
<br />

<br />
I leveled an alt in Dulak back when the &quot;hotspots&quot; first came out.  Zone was more populated (with level appropriate toons) than probably at any time since LoY came out.  One bard was aeing a large group in the open, and another had a ship to him/herself.  The one in the open would occasionally screw up and train the zone.
<br />

<br />
It's possible the number of complaints increased - but with SoE's history of listening to customer feedback (or should i say not listening) I'm not convinced this was the motivator in this case.
<br />

<br />
The arguement made about moving npcs creating server-side lag - it's a fact.  Still, I doubt massive numbers of AEing bards were to blame for the horrible lag problems that arose with DX9.
<br />

<br />
What does seem true is that unlike the OoW charm nerf (which negatively affected high end enchanters) - this nerf would seem to be most detrimental to bards at level 60 and below.  I wouldn't imagine too many 65+ bards ae kiting to get experience (or needing to).  Then again, as you can see from my sig - my knowledge of high end bards is negligable.
<br />

<br />
As far as leveling the playing field with druids and wizards - give the classes who can't get an insta-tell for a group in WoS or MPG a break.  Looking at the implementation of OoW (slow mitigation, trackers key in non-instanced zones, problems reported with pacify in the high end zones), Bards shouldn't have too much trouble grouping.  Plus - with the new charm songs (IF they work in PoP and GoD) - you will soon be able to swarm kite in tactics, Vxed and other zones fairly soon.
<br />

<br />
Just my thoughts and it's quite possible I'm wrong. Feel free to flame.</span></td>

I'm trying to understand exactly what it is you think is unbalanced. Targetted AEs can only hit a maximum of four mobs, that is already balanced. PBAEs can theoretically hit an infinite number of mobs, but show me a wizard who is going to solo PBAE (with a different category of PBAE, mind you) 35-45 mobs for exp grinding; they'd be bugnut insane (and I do believe that is the clinical term). Possible, but likely to end with less experience than a stripped ebay'ed bard trying to learn AE kiting.
<br />

<br />
Would you prefer the PBAE nerf to function as targetted AEs do? Having only a maximum of four targets being affected at all, moving or otherwise? Or do you want to remove targetted AEs completely?
<br />

I say again, there is nothing to balance against. Bards were the only ones with these kinds of effects.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Ok, let me try to explain it this way.  The problem wasn't that we were using AE songs to kill, The problem was that we were killing too many mobs at once.  That was the beef other classes had with us.  Yes, we were doing this with PB AoE songs but it was the fact that we could kite half a zone at once that upset people.  With this change to our songs, we are now limited to being able to damage one mob at a time when kiting (chant kiting), while other classes (druids and wizzies for example) are capable of damaging 4 mobs at a time when kiting.
<br />
The fact that they are doing it with DD spells rather than dot is irrelevant.  Bottom line is they can kill 4 at a time with their spells, and we have been reduced to 1.  I guarantee you if suddenly lightning strike (and whatever other druid spells are used to kite, sorry I haven't played my druid in 2 years lol) only did damage if the targets are not moving, there would be a huge uproar by the druids.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I think an easy fix to our AE nerf would be to lift the soloing nerf in the first place. the only reason i started AE kiting was because it was the quickest way to get EXP after the nerf for bards. but if they take that away, the only 2 real ways left to solo are Chant kiting and Swarm Kiting. and seeing as how chant kiting takes forever, instead of getting 1-2% per mob in HoH you could be back to getting about 4-6% per kill solo at 70.. this is just assuming. but that would lessen the blow that we take from the AE nerf.
