<h3>Mask of Deception - Walkthrough Guide</h3>

NOTE: I will often refer to Upper-guk as live 
side and Lower-Guk as dead side. While this 
is not technically correct it is something that 
is functional. Also the way I suggest to get 
to the Assassin/ Supplier (ass/sup) room is 
not the only way, but the way I have found 
best. 
<br><br>
A good suggestion for lower bards 
attempting this is to get a bind in Freeport 
and bank everything but food and hand 
drums. That way when you die you can 
forget the corpse retrieval business, which 
can be a nightmare. It is also important to 
invest in some Invis to Undead, (INU) 
potions. You can buy these from Shaman 
over lvl 34. Buy them in the 10 pack, expect 
to pay about 100pp for the potions. SPECIAL 
NOTE: If you loot something while invis you 
will reappear and lose the invis. 
<br><br>
Things to know. The Assassin is lvl 35 and 
spawns in the Ass/Supp room. He drops the 
Mask of Deception common and the Serrated 
Bone Dirk rare (rouge only). The mask is 
Bard/Rogue only and NO DROP. The spawn time on 
the Assassin is about 29 minutes and he has 
a placeholder that will spawn more often. 
<br><br>
Anyone may go through Upper-guk with relative 
ease, so long as they have NEVER killed a 
froglok before. 
<br><br>
The very first thing you MUST do is go get 
the maps to Upper-Guk and Lower-Guk from 
<a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/upperguk.html" target="_new">Upper Guk</a> and 
<a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/lowerguk.html" target="_new">Lower Guk</a>. I 
will be referring to map location based on 
the maps from EQAtlas.com. Also it is 
important to read the write ups on this 
dungeons. Up-Guk is a 4-25 lvl dungeon 
while Lo-guk is a 30-50 dungeon. 
<br><br>
After you 
get the IVU potions and bind in FP do the 
naked run through Nro, Oasis, SRo and 
Innothule Swamp. Traverse through Up-Guk 
to the Live side/Dead side entrance at 
location 7 (1200,-200). Make sure there is 
not a crowd hanging out here, if so it may 
mean there is a bunch of nasties on the 
other side. Go ahead and enter dead side. 
You will enter at location ‘C’ (1200, -200). 
<br><br>As 
soon as you zone do a camp check. If 
someone is camping the Ass/sup room ask 
them, politely, if you may be added on the 
wait list for the mask. Since it is bard and 
rouge item no-drop they should have no 
problems adding you to the list. Don’t be 
surprised if you are number 2 or greater on 
list. Also the assassin does not always 
spawn so you may have a long wait.
<br><br> After 
you have been added to the list you have 
two options. You can go ahead and go to the 
ass/supp room or you can try to collect 
some shin greaves and gloves from the shin 
knights. The shin greaves and gloves are no- 
drops that are often left to rot, and are need 
for Lambent quest. The knights spawn near 
the entrance and are often hunted or dead 
by groups entering. Ask politely, if you may 
loot the shin items. Must groups have no 
problems with this. 
<br><br>When you are ready to 
go to the ass/sup room, get IVU either by 
potion or by a cleric if one is available. After 
you are invisible proceed from the entrance 
down the hill to first intersection. Turn right 
and go down till you come to a stream, enter 
stream and go right. Go down stream until it 
ends get out of water, you are now in the 
Bedroom. Take the left most entrance way 
(1000, -600). BE CAREFUL HERE. As you 
walk down the hallway make the left wall 
your new friend. Hug the left wall and when 
you enter the BAT room go left ASAP. The 
bats are alive and can see you, however 
they usually are on other side of room. 
When you turn left hug the right wall. There 
are Greater Skeletons in an alcove on left 
that should be avoided. Follow the right wall 
down until you enter a large area with a 
bridge. Run across the bridge ignoring the 2 
undead guards. Run into castle and go 
straight back. When you reach far wall turn 
left and go to the ladder on the far wall. Go 
up the ladder and you have entered the 
Ass/Sup room. 
<br><br>If you have a long wait, ask 
to join group and play mana song for them. 
If you do this they may agree to pull a Basalt 
Gargoyle who drops the Basalt Carapace part 
of the Lambent BP quest. After you get your 
mask, DONOT use it until you exit the live 
side, it will make you KOS to live frogs. To 
get out just reverse the way in, it is pretty 
easy when you see how it is done. If all has 
gone well you can leave the dungeon with 
your mask, shin greaves, shin gloves, and 
basalt carapace and be half way to 
completing 3 lambent quest. 
Good luck and have fun. 
<br><br>
Special consideration: if you get detected 
and start getting hit. Either run to zone if 
you can or stay where you are and die. 
DONOT take a way you don’t know in hopes 
of losing them, you will just get lost and die 
in some horrible god forsaken hole and 
never find your body again (trust me).
