				<td colspan="2"><span>Well when zeb was locked last night, I and a friend went to Tunare and created new chars. She made a chanty, and I a bard. I am not a terribly  experienced player, but have played for about 9 months and have multiple chars in their 30's/40's on zeb, so I do know how the game works. However, I never played a bard....
<br />

<br />
Anyway, last night we had a blast with two new chars on a server where we dont know anyone, running through the new tutorials and  levelling up to 5 in the Gloomingdeep. Got all my songs there and collected a full set of burlap armor<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif" border="0" alt="Big Smile" hspace="2" /> . 
<br />

<br />
Both of us realized that we missed quite a bit of  Everquest from when we started -- we each have some high level friends that gave us a boost at the beginning. With that (and PC -- for me at least) we feel like we missed a lot of the game. 
<br />

<br />
Sooo, what we have chosen to do is take these two toons and play them and try to discover the original Everquest. What was it like before PC? What put the &quot;quest&quot; in Everquest? Not that we are going to try to do the &quot;OLD WORLD&quot; routine that I have seen some people talk about (no zones post luclin/velious/ etc. etc.) We both just want to take invest some time in these chars.  We're going to concentrate on the newbie armor quests for now and maybe the postal quests, but what else is out there?
<br />

<br />
I know quite a few of you have played since day one -- or shortly thereafter. What do you remember? What was fun/different/frustrating etc? 
<br />

<br />
This game is fun and extraordinarily addicting, but I just would want to learn a bit more about it before I find that I am 65 and bitching about the trains by all the ebayer's in BoT (h*ll or before I become one due to lack of experience <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-5.gif" border="0" alt="Wink" hspace="2" /> ). 
<br />

<br />
So if anyone could help keep another jackass out of BoT, please chime in with your thoughts, tips, experiences, etc. 
<br />

<br />
And on a final note, I have read through all of the guides on this site, and in advance would like to thank the site owners and the guide authors for those! They have to be the most complete and comprehensive class guides I have ever seen! <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />  
<br />

<br />
edit:Well now I am only the lonely. Zeb is back up but I want to still try to do this, so I decided to pick a whole new server and ran through the list up and down and randomly landed on E'ci -- which is where I can be found now.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Hehe, He mentioned that they were going to start with newbie armor quests.
<br />

<br />
Anywho, I don't remember any lower level quests worth doing really...but for fun, you could run the old Stein quest with the enchanter after about lvl 12.
<br />

<br />
Really the only fun quests I can think of start at lambent. Twilight Sea armor is decent as well and can be started in the mid 20s in the Scarlet Sea. Twilight level armor also has options for casters so it would be beneficial to both of you.
<br />

<br />
&lt;Out of context&gt; I've tried the start all over and do it differently thing a few times, never did make it past the newbie levels. I guess I'm just too used to twinking that I'm addicted to it...

<br />
It's kind of neat to see someone realize that they missed a lot of the game due to new found friends helping them out so much.
<br />

<br />
I know a bit about what it was like, the feeling you're looking for.  I started just before Luclin was released.  My first ever character was a halfling druid on FV server, didn't realize you can only have one toon there... he lives on to this day, napping away happily, sub level 10.  His purpose in life is to remind me of when I started the game, 18 November, 2001.
<br />

<br />
*note: the following, unintentionally, became a short story.  I hope you enjoy it.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, he charged out into the world, killing beatles, spiders, bixies... and killed by the very same.  One day he made a friend who had been playing for a few weeks, and this friend wanted to go to Freeport and take the boat to Butcherblock Mountains to the home of the Dwarfs in Kaladim.
<br />

<br />
So, off we run from Misty Thicket home to Rivervale, and out into Kithicor.  You have heard of Kithicor, haven't you?  Tis a dark and forboding place for many.  Filled with undead, darkelves, and their nasty pets, all with the intent of making you pay for tresspassing.
<br />

<br />
The daylight hours aren't so bad, during that period of the day the undead go away to slumber until night calls them forth once again.  This is usually the safest time to run the gauntlet.
<br />

<br />
Here we are having just stepped inside Kithicor and my friend tells me, as I was clueless, stay up on the wall and follow.  Which I did; I'm glad he was in his 14th season and had gifted me with Spirit of the Wolf.  As we were running I had my first encounter with one of the undead hordes.  Fight him, are you mad!?!  He could have killed me with both arms behind his back.  Ran around him, found more of his friend, (I told you it's crawling at night and this was about 2am).
<br />

<br />
We ran and ran, hearts pounding, legs aching, lungs and throats burning with the effort, even with SoW.  I'm wishing I had bought a map at this point; later I learned where to get them, and only then did I find out, to my horror, what I had attempted.  I'm not one for suicide, and this run was exactly that, a suicide run.  Finally, the valley out of Kithicor is at hand, we've made it.  Into the Western portion of the Commons we enter, stopping to catch our breaths and thank Karana for our good fortune.
<br />

<br />
Nice clean open, and friendly looking Commons.  Turned out not to be so friendly.  Between the Orc and Dev camps, the big cats, and giants,yes, giants once inhabited the area, (though I have not seen them in ages, then again I don't go there much any more), it turned out not to be quite so friendly.  So we're off and running again, but this time straight through the zone, running around all the nasties we see.
<br />

<br />
Eastern end of the valley, and it's a bit better, but the noise!  More orcs, but they are on one side and easy to avoid.  Some undead in the sandy areas, also easy to avoid.  Dang cats again, and they are hunters, and you are definately food for them, in their minds.
<br />

<br />
Back to the noise.  You'd think you were in a huge market from all the shouting and yelling going on.  In fact, that is exactly where you are; rather were, back then.  You see, there is a tunnel between the eastern end of the valley and North Ro.  In this tunnel were people selling anything and everything.  I think I even saw someone selling their grandmother! &lt;grin&gt; Hagling going on everywhere.  It's nuts I tell you.
<br />

<br />
Well, I didn't have money to speak of and we had a goal.  Freeport here we come!  What's this?  I thought we'd be safe once in the boundries of the city.  Someone is playing a bad joke on me this day, it seems.  Why, you wonder?  I'll tell you why.  Bats, huge bats, I mean these things are big enough to pick me up and carry me away!  And then the rats, my lord they are huge.  Not to mention the undead skeletons and the orc pawns and centruions.  So we run for the gates and make it; the guards holding fast and strong against our agressors.
<br />

<br />
Freeport, it's hard to imagine, for one like me back then, just how big it is.  After all I come from a rather small and tight community, nothing like this place.  Hearing is one thing, seeing is another, and I'm glad I was with my friend.  Though after what he just put me through, I was wondering just how much of a friend.
<br />

<br />
To the docks we go, waiting on the boat over to Faydwer and Butcherblock.  Not much to do while waiting.  Sure, you could go to the bar and get drunk, but we didn't want to miss the boat.  Would be nice if someone would post a schedule for it.
<br />

<br />
Ahh, there it is, and it is a fine ship.  Well, I think it is.  Remember, ships are something of legend to me.  Most water I've ever seen is enough to swim in, put a small rowboat in, and to fish in.  Later I would see true majesty in the Maden Voyage.  *side note: It is a shame that these great ships have been drydocked and cannot be seen plying the seas any longer.  Who knows when or if they will ever feel the spray of waves crashing against their bows.  Gnome punters just are not the same.* We board the ship and are off to our destination.
<br />

<br />
Land, oh I am so happy to see land again... *retch!*  Sorry, I'm a little sick at the moment.  If you have never been on a ship, on heavy seas, you don't know what you're missing.  I have since gotten my sea legs, but that first ride was a horror what with the storm and all.
<br />

<br />
Staggering off of the ship onto the docks, which I nearly fell off of, we make our way onto the firm ground.  Yes, I did kiss it, as well as relieve my poor stomach of more of this morning's meal.  I don't think the merchant was happy about that, but he seemed ready for it as he had a shovel and took care of it.  I'm glad I wasn't wet, the look he game me would have frozen me on the spot.
<br />

<br />
Goblins!?!  But, but this is supposed to be safe!  &quot;Run,&quot; I say to my friend, and we head for the gates to the port where we can see some guards.  Sure enough, the goblins, so intent on us, miss the fact that the guards are waiting for them.  There was no battle to speak of.  The guards of Butcherblock are stout hardy men, and women.
<br />

<br />
We ask directions and are told to just follow the road, it passes right in front of the city entrance.  We thank the guards again for saving us and for the directions, and we're off and running again.  Running, always running.  Doesn't anyone walk?
<br />

<br />
Opps, that's right it's not exactly safe everywhere, so it is best to run.  Sometimes, if you run fast enough, the creatures who might be interested in your flesh and hide won't notice or bother with you.  Too much trouble to run after a meal and new shirt.
<br />

<br />
Kaladim, finally we are here.  It is different from home, and from Freeport.  This city is under the mountain, yet a city it is.  We finally manage to find what we came for, a <a target="_new" href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=11816">sharpening stone?</a>  My gosh, we traveled all the way here for that?  Ah well, we did and it was an adventure.  Since then Bodbin Gimple has been selling them.  Or maybe he was all along and I just hadn't taken the time to find out.
<br />

<br />
I thought you would enjoy hearing about my youth in Norrath, a youth I'll never have again here.  Exciting and fun.</span></td>

Hi and welcome to the boards.
<br />

<br />
Instead of typing out a lot of stuff that has already been typed up over and over again, let me instead guide you to a few choice portions of our boards.
<br />

<br />
First is the <a target="_new" href="http://www.eqdiva.com/eq/guides.aspx"><b>Guides</b></a> section.  You will find a plethora of information here, starting with our <a target="_new" href="http://www.eqdiva.com/EQ/Guide.aspx?id=106&amp;ForumID=132"><b>FAQ</b></a>, it was posted by me, but is not my work by a long shot.  It is the work of many who are even more experienced than I.
<br />

<br />
Next are the forums for the various levels, found here: <a target="_new" href="http://www.eqdiva.com/Forums/ShowForumGroup.aspx?ForumGroupID=2"><b>Divas and Rockstars</b></a> Just about anything you want to know about the various levels will be found here under the appropriate heading.
<br />

<br />
I hope you find the information helpful.
<br />

<br />
If you cannot find what you are looking for, then before asking in a new thread, use the <a target="_new" href="http://www.eqdiva.com/Search/default.aspx"><b>SEARCH</b></a> feature of our boards, if done correctly you can usually find what you're interested in.
<br />

<br />
It would be really nice, if you do start a thread on a question if you would post it in the appropriate forum.  New to the game, probably belongs in the <a target="_new" href="http://www.eqdiva.com/Forums/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=8"><b>Nilipus' Newbies</b></a> forum, and so on.
<br />

<br />
Enjoy your stay.
<br />

<br />
Once again, Welcome to <a target="_new" href="http://www.eqdiva.com/Default.aspx"><b>EQDiva</b>, your source for all your Barding needs</a>.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>That's also what I was afraid of (well I guess afraid may not be the right word for it -- I was just sort of hoping that I may have missed them<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" /> ) .
<br />

<br />
Anyway, the twilight sea and lambent quests are two that I have never looked into -- thought I have looked at the armor here on this site. I think I may go and give those a try.
<br />

<br />
And to respond to your OOC -- I have tried this a couple of times too -- I really want to do it, it's just too tempting to go grab a temp and a Centi, some low priced armor  and go kick the crap out of those poor fiends in PC. POOFTA you're lvl 22...... (This almost seems to work better and faster than /testbuff on the test server...)
<br />

<br />
And Mose -- thanks for the info on the gnoll fang quest and gnoll slayer I have done the first and helped a friend do the other -- but never ran the quest myself. As a matter of fact BB is prolly one of my favorite zones! I tend to like the Lisbett McNeal (?) version for the fangs a bit better -- three fangs for a ton of xp and some random items. There truly should be a barbarian bard -- Could you see us now walking the fields of Karana with our bagpipes -- the focus should be an immediate AOE fear......
<br />

<br />
And thank you Shass for the information and the story! I know Kith only too well.....
<br />

<br />
You ever hear about how people dont read things fully -- you know, when the closed sign is on the door, but people still knock and ask &quot;Are you open?&quot; -- well I am guilty of the same. At first I thought I had committed a major faux pas on this board with my original post, even got that &quot;Great I am gonna get booted from the forums!&quot; feeling in the pit of my stomach.  And then, only after a bout 5 readings did I see the first line of Shass's post hehe. Well I might sing purty good, but noone ever told me I had tuh read.....
<br />

<br />
To counter with a little story of my own -- from my first days of playing (granted that was only Sept/Oct and trust me, my prose will not equal that of Shassiah -- I wont even try):
<br />

<br />
Well I entered the world as a ranger after having read that wood elf rangers are a GREAT class!  They get Bows and Arrows and EVERYTHING. I remember dreaming dreams of Robin Hood and my old days of D&amp;D where I always loved the ranger and reading of the rangers DS and SOW and and and..... (well you know the rest)
<br />
SO I first zoned into EQ and found myself inside a hut and followed through the initial steps of joining my guild -- getting my tunic and so on.... And then I stepped out the door onto a giant platform around a tree and 50 feet off the ground. Ahhh Lothlorien in game form I thought! Well enough reminiscing about how this game brought back memories of youth for me -- now was the time to find something to stomp on.... So I began to wend my way accross the platform. What I remember was a bridge.... I remember the rails on the bridge. I remember thinking &quot;well the rails are there for a reason&quot;.... I remember not really paying attention to where I was running. I remember thinking &quot;the rails wont let me fall -- they wouldnt build a bridge with rails that dont do anything&quot;. And then I remember my first of many &quot;LOADING PLEASE WAIT......&quot;
<br />

<br />
Only after many more of these deaths did I finally make it to the ground.  On that day I am sure that there were a few PC's sitting around on the floor of Gfay singing &quot;It's raining woodelves&quot;  to the tune of A Donna Summer song  as another incarnation of me went splat......
<br />

<br />
Needless to say the ranger didnt last that long..... And I will never have to listen to the bad ranger jokes (you know the type like &quot;Did you hear about the new ranger only zone? -- Shadowrest&quot;).
<br />

<br />
Well I have blabbed on long enough -- probably completely derailed my own post, but just thought I would add a little more story to the post.
<br />

<br />
So keep coming with the ideas and memories please! Maybe this is the right place to post so that true newbies get an idea of what they are heading out into.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Not to be overly negative, but the reason you never see anybody wearing Twilight Sea armor is that it's too much of a PITA to get it. Each piece requires a drop off of a rare spawn; many of the rare spawns are in the 40s and some hide out in the middle of difficult camps in dangerous zones (like Scarlet Desert). (The Bravado breastplate IIRC requires a drop off of an Honored Spire Spirit, a level 45 mob that spawns adjacent to the Spire Lord, a level 50 boss mob). The fact that Luclin mobs undercon just mades it harder.
<br />

<br />
And, no, you can't do the Twilight Sea armor quests in your 20s. Mid-30s, maybe.
<br />

<br />
I'm just bitter... A while ago I thought it'd be fun to go get some Bravado Armor and even though my bank still has boxes full of the common drops (like jewels) I don't have a single piece. 
<br />

<br />
If you think it'll be fun to camp out for a month in Twilight Sea and Scarlet Desert in your early-mid 40s, running around killing random light blue mobs hoping something interesting spawns, then go ahead and give the Twilight Sea armor quests a try.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>ahh, the ol' days, when i was but a wee barbarian lad, practacing the shamanic arts. I reacall running around in the frozen tundra of Ef, trying to find someones killer, feed a polarbear some icecream, running to tundra jack to get him to kill my train, or atleast slow it down.
<br />

<br />
Ah, Iceberg, jundra jack, snowflake, to many these names mean naught, to the ol' schoolers they are fond memories of quests completed long ago, but a gimmering of rememberance.
<br />

<br />
If/when i start a new toon on a new server, i usually get my first few lvls in Everfrost, spiders/bears/skellies/wolfs.
<br />
They drop spiderling silks, pelts, bones. these can usually be sold in bazaar or though /OOC. nothing like lvling till lvl 8, then selling all your loot for 1k in /ooc.
<br />

<br />
If ya have decent halas faction, ya can turn in the polarbear belts for xp in the kilt shop, and ya can collect wooly fungus of the spiderlings and turn them into &quot;Walter&quot; one of the shaman guild leaders.
<br />

<br />
If a friend makes a barbarian, the barb newbie armor is a piece of cake, the hardest thing to find is spider venom sac (just pok over to mistythicket and buy one off vendor)

				<td colspan="2"><span>A note on the Lambent Quests...
<br />

<br />
If you like questing, then by all means do em!  If you are really looking for gear, and not spending a lot of cash, Lambent is not the way to go.  The gems for the quest are expensive.  Far more expensive than many things you can buy in the bazaar.  (RyGorr Armor is an excellent option)
<br />

<br />
If you are a do-it-yourselfer, and again, don't mind spending some money, hehe, take up Blacksmithing.  Check out eqtraders.com for guides on learning and skilling up.  Banded Armor will be a significant AC upgrade to the newbie armor.  The LDoN armors, (Gothic Steel, for example), is pretty darned good stuff, and should last you up into your 40s.  You can also likely find this stuff in bazaar, or have someone make it for you.  Also check the vendors around PoK, especially near the forges.  People do LDoN stuff for skillups, and just dump em on the vendors to get some of their cash back.  I forget what the vendors charge for em, but it isn't ALL that bad (compared to LOTS of vendor sold stuff)
<br />

<br />
Another idea, while you are still lowish level...  Make a run to Katta Castellum.  Bring about 150pp if you can.  Get a Combine Lute there, and all your songs they sell there.  Check the vendors for some DIRT cheap items:  Sturdy Grimling Mining Pick (a good newbie piercer), and look for Coterie armor.  It sells REAL cheap, and has some HP on em.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Also if you do the gnoll fang quest its better to turn them in, in hallas. That way you get no negative faction. One of the warriors in the puit area takes four at a time as well. You will enough qeynos faction by just killing the bards. I think 2 stacks of fangs at 10 got me to 11. Can't remeber if it was a full level or just most. You do seem to get more xp turning in in Qeynos tho. But it can take yer bloodsaber and Corrupt Guards faction way down. And at lower levels if you become KoS it sucks. By the way Qeynos sewers is a good xp sprot for low levels as it has and always has had a modifyer. I use to sing down there for faster skill ups

My old school level guid goes something like this. Qeynos (5), Qeynos hills (5-8), Blackburrow (8-10 15-20)/Hallas(10-14), North Karana (20ish), South Karana, (20ish to 29), GD (29-40), EW (40-47) from there I'v been running around alot and not playing alot more
