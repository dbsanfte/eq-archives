This month I hope to bring all the updated, new content back to EQDiva.com domain.<br><br>What's new? I am working on an EQ Item database. Well, actually I have the database all ready, I just have to create the code and interface so we can view/play with it!<br><br>Also I will work on enabling all Spells for all classes. You may notice I let you peek at a few class lists, but they might have some broken images and such. I'll be finishing this soon. Why? I just want to be prepared in case Lucy (which got bought out by Allakhazam) starts charging you to become a premium member to view their spells/items. So us lucky bards at EQDiva will be prepared!<br><br>Yes, life is settling down so I can get stuff done with the site this month. Remember to use the new forums, I'm really starting to hate EZBoards, with their putting ads on and charging us thousands a year. Also, add your guides, add song posts, and update your PROFILES!!! :)<br><br>Here's the URL for the next month until it all comes back here.<br><a href='http://www.dotnetdiva.com'>EQDiva New Site</a>.<br><br>Have a Happy New Year!<br>Kocho Divah</blockquote></td></tr>

Membership at the new site is going far better than I ever imagined! We now have 3,283 registered members (not counting 8530 on EQDiva EZBoard forums) and we get about 10 new members each day. <br><br>As most of you know, I recently starting working on the site again. At the same time, I'm sharpening my web skills so that the site is fast and efficient, and I only work on the site as I find the time. So progress may be slow at times. However, I'm looking forward to January as a banner month to updating EQDiva and adding lots of features. I will be working extra hard this month to migrate all the existing EQDiva content over to the beta site, adding new features/content/guides, and finally, moving it all back to the EQDiva domain so you will have only one website to get all EQDiva bard information. <br><br>And now, for the patch message.<br><br>==================<br>December 18, 2003 <br>------------------------------ <br><br>Headlines! <br><br>Melee Enhancements Part 1 <br>New Spell Effects Live <br>Casino Now Open In Shadowhaven <br>HEAR YE! HEAR YE! Check with your Town Crier for new editions of your hometown paper! <br><br>*** AA REFUND *** <br><br>- Extended Notes 3 and Sionachie's Cresendo have been refunded (More details below). If you had these bard AAs and were close to 30 AA points stored, make certain that you spend enough points to have 30 or less unspent AA points before you zone. All AA points over 30 are removed when you zone. <br><br>- Improved Reclaim Energy has been refunded to magicians due to changes with the amount of energy received when cannibalizing their pets. If you have this Magician AA and were close to 30 AA points stored, make certain that you spend enough points to have 30 or less unspent AA points before you zone. All AA points over 30 are removed when you zone. <br><br><br><br>** Melee enhancements ** <br><br>We have been building an enhancement to the melee system, and the first part of it is now Live. <br><br>The yellow bar now represents endurance rather than stamina. <br><br>All Disciplines now require an expenditure of endurance to use. They still have a re-use timer, and they can't be used more often than the timer allows. <br><br>Disciplines have now been divided into a few different timers. <br><br>We have also added a few of the new melee skills to the game. These are the skills that do not use the new &quot;opening&quot; system, but can be used without an opening present. The &quot;reactionary&quot; skills and the opening system will remain on Test for further tuning. <br><br>Warriors have been given a mitigation boost. This affects all warriors at all levels. <br><br>Monks have been given the ability to dodge blows from attackers behind them. This affects all monks with the Dodge ability. <br><br>All existing disciplines can be purchased as tomes in either East Commons or the Plane of Knowledge. To learn a discipline, the Tome must be turned into your guildmaster. <br><br>Several new disciplines have been added for warriors, monks and rogues who are above level 60. <br><br><br><br>** Play King's Court in Shadowhaven! ** <br><br>Shandeling's Roost in Shadowhaven now houses a game of chance. To play you will need to buy a King's Court Token. You then take this token and turn it in to any of the dealers. Based on what your hand turns out to be, you will be awarded a prize. The highest hands will return a gold ticket as the prize. This Ticket can be turned in to win prizes such as a Guise of the Deceiver, Fungus Covered Great Staff, or Holgresh Elder Beads. Good luck to all that play! <br><br><br><br>** Items ** <br><br>- Purchased augments, that have not been bound to an item yet, can be sold back to Dible Hedledrap in South Ro. <br><br>- Caerlyna in the Bazaar will trade your containers for tokens and will trade tokens for containers. This will allow player characters to sell those tokens in the Bazaar. Folks that buy the tokens can then take them to the Caerlyna and trade them in for the appropriate container. You can exchange most weight reducing tradeable containers for a token. <br><br>- We've changed the +12 Wis on the Copper Medal of Rapture to +12 Int. Really, we have! <br><br>- We have lowered the minimum duration to 5 ticks on Affliction Efficiency I-IV and Affliction Haste I-IV foci. <br><br>- Timeless Coral Greatsword will no longer claim to be out of charges when it procs. If you own one of these swords, you will need to petition a GM and ask them to replace your current Coral Greatsword with a new one. <br><br>- Phylactery is no longer useable by all classes, only MAG NEC ENC WIZ CLR SHA DRU. <br><br>- The Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic now only procs for characters level 35 and above. <br><br>- The following items that had the Invigor effect now have Serpent Sight or Ultravision: Orb of the Crimson Bull, Abram's Axe of the Stoic, Tolan's Darkwood Boots, Mrylokar's Greaves, Singing Steel Vambraces, Crown of Rile, 5 Dose Potion of Wolves Blood, 5 Dose Potion of Fleeting Languor, 10 Dose Potion of Wolves Blood, 10 Dose Potion of Fleeting Languor, Potion of Wolves Blood, Potion of Fleeting Languor, Spiroc Wingblade, Spirit Caller's Boots, Spirit Weaver's Boots, Frozen Efreeti Boots, Ring of the Crimson Bull, Rune Crafter's Boots, Wolf Caller's Boots and Camii's Bracer of Vigor. <br><br>- The effects on Abram's Axe of the Stoic and Spiroc Wingblade are now Worn to activate, not procs. <br><br><br><br>** Spells/Songs ** <br><br>- New spell effects! Just about every spell in the game has been given a new spell effect. If you have your spell effects turned off, you may want to turn them back on. <br><br>- Fixed the bard AA Channeling Focus. It was allowing 100% recovery from missed notes in most instances. We have restored it to the 5%/10%/15% values as documented in the AA window. <br><br>- Fixed a problem with short-duration pets (Rage of Zomm, cleric hammers, wizard flaming swords and such) so that they will no longer dissipate before engaging the target NPC. <br><br>- Reclaim Energy will now return 75 percent of the mana used to summon the pet, 95 percent if the caster has Improved Reclaim Energy. <br><br>- Lull spells with duration less than 5 should no longer be lasting as if they had duration 5. This will reduce the duration of some lull-type spells to their proper duration. <br><br>- Fixed a problem that caused Protection of the Nine to block Blessing of the Nine. <br><br>- We corrected an issue where the same druid damage over-time spell cast on an NPC by two different druids would not stack. <br><br>- Bulwark of Vie was reducing spell damage as well as melee damage. It now only reduces melee damage. <br><br>- Eye of Zomm will no longer cause players summoned pets to suicide if commanded to kill the eye. <br><br>- Improved the melee damage on pets focused by Ritual Summoning. <br><br>- The magician epic pet can now Enrage when focused by Minion of Darkness. <br><br>- Increased the offensive capabilities of most pets when focused by Summoner's Boon. <br><br>- We have removed the Stamina effects from many spells. <br><br>- Fixed a bug that would cause issues with pet hit points, and could cause them to be unable to move if their hit points got too low. This may also address other issues with pets using hit-point boosting items. <br><br><br><br>** Alternate Advancement ** <br><br>- Extended Notes 3 and Sionachie's Cresendo have been refunded. If you had these bard AAs and were close to 30 AA points stored, make certain that you spend enough points to have 30 or less unspent AA points before you zone. All AA points over 30 are removed when you zone. You may, of course, repurchase these AAs. <br><br>- Extended Notes and Sionachie's Cresendo no longer affects harmful area-of-effect spells. <br><br>- Jamfest has been fixed. It will now affect the bard's group, not just the bard. <br><br>- The Archetype AA ability Spell Casting Deftness was not reducing the casting time for the wizard spell Harvest. It does now. <br><br><br><br>** Tradeskills ** <br><br>- Merchants will not pay more for a tradeskill product than the cost of the components needed to make it. However, they will still sell those products for the same amount. <br><br><br><br>** Zones and Quests ** <br><br>- Maelin will now respond as though you have the Quintessence, as long as you are flagged for time. It is also now possible to receive any of the earlier progression flags, even if you have already earned access to the Plane of Time. <br><br><br><br>** User Interface ** <br><br>- Tell windows now log the name of the person sending tells in the chat log. <br><br>- Tell windows now blink when a tell is received, even when the window is not minimized. <br><br>- Fixed a problem that caused users some ATI cards to be unable to see the /find path or the targeting ring. <br><br>- We have added a new combat ability windown which allows you to make up to eight hot keys for disciplines and other new melee abilities and displays any current melee effects. The window can be opened by pressing Alt+C. The keys are accessible using either the mouse or Ctrl+1-8. <br><br><br><br>** Miscellaneous ** <br><br>- Added some explanation text to the targetindicator.ini file that help explain how to modify the targeting ring. <br><br>-Bard nerfs were not a result of whining on monk boards as some believe but a result of Sincatt being so damn good looking. <br><br><br>** UI Files ** <br><br>AttackIndicator.tga <br>EQUI.xml <br>EQUI_CharacterCreate.xml <br>EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd.xml <br>EQUI_CombatSkillsSelectWnd.xml <br>EQUI_GroupSearchWnd.xml <br>EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml <br>EQUI_SkillsWnd.xml <br></blockquote></td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2" bgcolor="#eeeeee"><br><blockquote>November 05, 2003 3:00 am <br>------------------------------ <br><br>** Quests, Adventures and Encounters ** <br><br>- We have added one more new LDoN raid to Stormhammer. This raid was created with Elemental capable characters in mind. <br><br>- Changed the minimum required number of group members to request an adventure from 4 to 3. <br><br>- We have increased the consolation prize on level 65 hard adventures from 19 to 26 to match the increase in reward points for success (raised from 76 to 105 with the last update). <br><br>- Verrell Cogswin can help convert red dragon scales into green dragon scales. <br><br>- Fixed the Undead and Fire event in the Plane of Time. There was a bug that could cause some of the minions to fail to spawn. <br><br>- Raotin Teawel will always give out the correct robe for completion of his quest. <br><br>- Thought Destroyer has returned to the Plane of Hate. <br><br>- Check with the Town Crier of your home town for news. There is information about the recent activities of the Wayfarers that should prove interesting. <br><br>- We have made some improvements to the Plane of Air avatar rings. We have added a random interval to the respawn time of the Plane of Air avatar rings, placed apparitions at the avatar spawns so that it is possible to tell when the event is available, and the Avatar of Smoke will now respawn properly. <br><br>- The Mujaki event in Plane of Nightmares was completely rewritten.  It should now be a lot more intelligent about where it sends players. <br><br>- Increased the number of items found at the end of a successful LDoN raid. <br><br><br>** Skills and Alternate Advancement ** <br><br>- Channeling Focus was not giving bards the proper reduction to the chance of missing a note.  It is now fixed and gives messages to indicate when it is has helped. <br><br>- Corrected a problem that was causing Alternate Advancement buff duration increase abilities and duration focus effects to negatively affect lull spells. <br><br>- We have fixed a bug that could cause pick pocketed items to not show up on your cursor until you zone. This could also sometimes cause the client to crash. <br><br>- Added /stoptracking command so that you no longer have to re-open the track window and hit cancel if you want to cancel your tracking quickly. <br><br>- Activated AAs from Planes of Power were not working if the user did not have Shadows of Luclin registered. This has been fixed. <br><br><br>** Spells and Pets ** <br><br>- The Aura of Pain Recourse can no longer be removed by Radiant Cure. <br><br>- When the character changes size (through illusion), other players will no longer see the mounted player separate from their horse. <br><br>- Magician Pets will no longer attack the caster who summoned them. <br><br>- Hitting your own pet while in a PVP area or while you have the PK flag on will no longer kill it. <br><br>- Cataclysm of Ro has had its movement rate bonus removed to fix a stacking issue with the Selo's line of movement rate songs. <br><br>- Cassindra's Chant of Clarity and Cassindra's Chorus of Clarity now lasts 3 ticks instead of being instant. <br>  <br>- Cloak of Luclin, Cloak of the Akheva and Frostreaver's Blessing will no longer be overwritten by Call of the Rathe. <br>  <br>- There are still some issues with Frostreaver's blessing being overwritten by some spells.  We are aware of the issue and hope to get it resolved soon. <br><br>- Protection of the Cabbage, Protection of the Glades and Protection of the Nine will block Temperance, Aegolism and Virtue. <br><br>- Ice Flame of E`ci now has the standard 2.5 second recast time. <br><br>-Reclaim energy should now function properly on the pet summoned by Child of Bertoxxulous. <br>  <br>-Beastlord warders focused by Summoner's boon should now look as they should. <br><br><br>** Interface ** <br><br>- We have added the consider color to the Target window. The art used to display the consider color can be removed or edited via XML by custom skins. <br><br>- We have also added a 3D target indicator.  The ring color indicates the con color of the target.  This can be turned off in the Options window. A new settings file in the UI folder can be edited by players to customize the appearance of the indicator, including different animated textures for each con color and other interesting settings. <br><br>- Added /fontface command (usage /fontface <fontname>, e.g. /fontface Courier). This will change, on the fly, the fonts used by the interface (and over character's heads). Fonts can also be selected in the General Options page. <br><br>- Added /tell windows. Each time you get a &quot;tell&quot; from a new character, a new chat window would open. That window will only display &quot;tells&quot; from the particular character, and any message sent from the chat window would automatically be sent as a &quot;tell&quot; to that character. You can turn this option on and off in the Options window. If you have the maximum number of chat windows open when a new tell is received, the tell will go to the main chat window <br><br>- Temporary pets will no longer send their buffs to the pet window. Generally they have none, and they would replace the buffs of any standard pet. <br><br>- The buff display portion of the pet window will now fade. <br><br>- The Auto-inventory area of the Inventory window now fades with the parent window. <br><br>- The Dump button in raid window now creates the proper, non-blank, file. <br><br>- We have also added time-stamp to Raid Dump output file. <br><br>- Pop-up dialogs no longer close when you press ESC. This will prevent the rez dialog from being closed accidentally. <br><br>- Lay on Hands will no longer &quot;gray out&quot; the Inspect and Open hot keys in the Hotbutton window. This was fixed earlier in the Actions window, but now it is fixed in the Hotbutton window as well. <br><br>- Alt-tabbing in and out of EQ should no longer cause mouse issues. <br><br>- Fixed a bug that sometimes left charmed pets health bar in the group window after the owner of that pet is killed. <br><br>- Find trader can now be cancelled in bazaar. <br><br><br>** Items ** <br><br>- The Copper Medal of Rapture now gives a bonus to Int. instead of Wis. <br><br><br>** For the New Player ** <br><br>- Left-clicking on an NPC prints out a message indicating what type of NPC they are and indicating that you should right-click on them. This message can be turned off in the Options window. <br><br>- New characters will now start with a bag. <br><br>- Added a tip window that pops up when you invoke the Quantity window that explains the use of Shift and Control when selecting items. <br><br>- All characters will gain a Sense Heading skill of 200, if it was below 200. All new characters will start with a Sense Heading of 200. <br><br><br>** Miscellaneous ** <br><br>- Explore mode works properly again. <br><br><br>** UI Files ** <br><br>* Changed * <br><br>EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml <br>EQUI_TargetWindow.xml <br>EQUI_Animations.xml <br><br><br>* New * <br><br>Targetindicator.ini <br>TargetBox.tga <br>TargetIndicator.tga <br><br>----------------------- <br><br><br>- Channeling Focus was not giving bards the proper reduction to the chance of missing a note. It is now fixed and gives messages to indicate when it is has helped.</blockquote></td></tr>
