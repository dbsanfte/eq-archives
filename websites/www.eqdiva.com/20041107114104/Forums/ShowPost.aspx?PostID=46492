				<td colspan="2"><span><img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" /> Hello, I just recently started a character on the AB server (my original character is a 63 cleric on Aro). I decided on a bard because I was intrigued by the class itself, and then decided on a different server so that I would not be tempted to &quot;twink&quot; this character. Anyway, I have managed to level up to 12 so far, and finished the quests that my guildmaster has given to me. I have my armor (songweavers from Freeport), and I just completed the quest for the sword (orc chief warbeads). 
<br />
~~First off, are there any other armor quests that can be done for upgrades (lets call them newb) past the songweavers armor?
<br />
~~And second, I am still hunting in EC, which is giving me somewhat good xp, but is there a better place that I can go that will help me learn to play the class? (I have done crushbone, Pc, all the xp camps with my cleric so I am not interested in visiting those places again). I really want a place that will let me solo while gaining good xp (I am not looking for a quick level, rather a good learning experience). 
<br />
~~Last, I have looked at the links that are here, read everything that was there, but I am still confused about some things. Mainly, the art of twisting songs and the usuage of instruments. Both have left me extrememly  confused. I would imagine that the art of twisting comes more with practice than anything else, but I am missing the basics somewhere in all the posts that I have read. And instruments, well, I am completly in the dark. If we have a weapon, and if we do not need to purchase and instrument to gain skill (wind, percussion,etc), then why do we need to buy instruments at all? 
<br />
 I would really appreciate any help that can be given to me ...as I said, I am not looking to quickly level this character, I would rather take the time to learn how to play it correctly. <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-10.gif" border="0" alt="Blushing" hspace="2" /></span></td>

<br />
Well, yes and no.
<br />
The next step up from Songweaver's armor is Lambent, which you can do in your late 20s and early 30s. Lambent armor is decent if you really like doing quests, unfortunately completing the quests requires that you turn in gemstones, and for the the money you'd spend on the gemstones you can buy comparable or better armor in bazaar.
<br />

Anywhere you can get a group, really. This might mean going to the &quot;xp camps&quot; since that's where the groups are. I personally do a lot of LDoN adventures.
<br />
Your life and duties as a bard are going to change throughout the levels as you get new songs. For instance, you don't get mezz until 15, and being able to mezz an add while twisting songs in one of the more important skills to learn. Later on, you'll get charm, resist songs, damage shields, over-haste, and spell-haste. 
<br />
Just try each of your songs as you get them and get a sense of what they do, how long they last, whether or not the buffs stack, etc. Do some research in the guides and song lists if you're unsure of what a particular song does.
<br />

<br />

This is going to turn into a flame war if we're not careful. There's another thread on this board that's pretty much dominated by an argument over whether or not soloing IS a good learning experience. There's a lot of bards who believe that if you solo too much you'll miss a lot of learning experiences that come from grouping.
<br />
Make sure you group a lot, is all I'm going to say here.
<br />

Twisting is simple. Let's use Chant of Battle and Hymn of Restoration since I know you have both of those.
<br />
Start Chant of Battle. The casting window will go away after a second and the Chant of Battle icon will appear in your song buffs. Once the icon appears, start Hymn of Restoration. After a second, the heart icon for Hymn will appear next to the muscled arm for Chant of Battle.
<br />
Now you have the bonus for BOTH Chant of Battle and Hymn of Restoration. This is a simple two-song twist. Every bard should be able to do a three song twist without any of the icons fading.
<br />
Does that make sense?
<br />

<br />
Well, our instruments make most of our songs more powerful.

<br />

<br />
Well, I don't want to start a heated argument based on the merits of soloing and grouping. I am not technically a newb, been playing EQ since beta, BUT, this is the first time I have tried to play a bard (so, in my mind, that makes me a newb, lol). I know the merits of grouping, and the invaluable experience one can gain from doing so, I also know the merits of soloing and that it is one of the best ways to discover what your character is capable of. So, that said, lol, let me try and clarify what I was asking. ~~Is there a place that is recomended to &quot;practice&quot; soloing for those times you don't want to be in a group~~that's the best way I can put it, I guess. 
<br />

<br />
<i>~~The next step up from Songweaver's armor is Lambent~~</i>
<br />

<br />
I have seen the stats and what is needed for this armor, I would have to agree with you that it is not really worth questing for<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-6.gif" border="0" alt="Sad" hspace="2" />...Has anyone gotten the armor that is bought through points in LDoN? And if so, is it worth the points that you have to spend?
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Ok, so, next question is this...How do you know which instrument to buy, when to use it and when not to use it, and whats the best that you can recommend for my level at decent price. I don't want to twink this character out, I am trying to do this as if it was my first character ever played, lol, which may sound silly, but that is what I am trying. So, here I am, a level 12 bard, almost 13, with about 30 plat in the bank so far. What would be the best recommendations for purchasing an instrument and why that particular one?

Not cheep, but not overly expensive, and all are off hand so swapping them out is easy enough.
<br />

<br />
Start with the lute, I'd say, and get a drum asap.  You will need the wind instrument for invis.

Hope this helps a little.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I spent most of my early bard life in Kurn's Tower.  It's good for soloing or grouping.  I mostly grouped though.   At about 14, I went to the Hollowshade area of Paladural.  Easy to get one or two pulls from the beetle looking things there.  Then I went to the Shadowhaven side of Paladural until 21.  It was about this time I went to Lake of Ill Omen and started AEing the sarnack fort and goblin ruins.  This was great experience (about 20%-30% a pull) and I stayed there off and on until about 30 doing some grouping in OT when I got tired of soloing.  
<br />

<br />
As far as grouping and soloing, I switch between them both.  I do a LFA then solo until I find someone looking for a bard my level.  Once you get mid 30s, people will find you for LDONs.  I've managed to keep all my skills maxed following this strategy.

<br />

<br />
You know what? I do agree with you.
<br />
If I were playing a newbie toon and grouping with a newbie bard, I'd rather they have learned their songs and capabilities on their own, then futz up the group messing around with songs that they don't know anything about.
<br />
A good place to practice skills on your own is the Sarnak fort in Lake of Ill Omen. It's rarely camped, and you can practice breaking the camp apart and pulling singles out to the lawn.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">Has anyone gotten the armor that is bought through points in LDoN? And if so, is it worth the points that you have to spend?</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
Well, all the LDoN armor is decent, but most of it is way too expensive for what it gives you. The devs are considering the possibility of either increasing LDoN point awards or decreasing the cost of some armors, but it's not really certain how that's going to turn out. I guess if you were doing a lot of Tak dungeons the 20-point Tak armor is a decent upgrade from Songweaver. Unfortunately even if you do hard LDoN straight from 20 you might get one piece of Tak armor at 25.
<br />

<br />
I kept my newbie armor until my late 30s when I could start doing other things for income like kite Hill Giants for coin, or when Rathe Mountains were way too camped I'd go to Tenebrous Mountains and quest a Rallic Pack for sale in bazaar (easy 1k). Then I just spent several nights accumulating platinum, and went to bazaar and bought some decent mid-level gear.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">How do you know which instrument to buy, when to use it and when not to use it, and whats the best that you can recommend for my level at decent price.</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
Shass already listed the Combine instruments, which are good. If you are really cheap, you can camp Cht'Thk Ash Beetles for Ivory Horn (wind instrument) and Cht'Thk Swarmers for Flawless Ivory Horn (brass instrument) both of which drop in Shadeweaver's Thicket off of the Shar Vahl PoK book. You won't need either until level 20 or so anyway.
<br />

<br />
During your early levels, you're not going to be using instruments that much. You'll wield your drum when travelling (Selo's Accelerando makes you even faster with a drum equipped), a wind instrument when invis is needed to travel through a difficult area, and a stringed instrument during group downtime while singing Hymn of Restoration. You only need a brass instrument at your level for AE kiting, which is a form of soloing that provides xp very very fast - but since you've already said you don't want to solo for xp, I doubt you'll be doing that.<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" /> While in a group, you'll probably be melee-ing a lot until your higher levels, when your melee damage starts to suck and you can benefit your group a lot more by equipping an instrument while playing a song.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Cht`Thk Swarmers drop both.  I camped these instruments when I was around lvl 12 or 13, EXP was good too.  And While going for the Flawless Ivory Horn drop I managed to get about 12 Ivor Horns, all of which sold pretty fast in the bazaar for about 50pp each.
<br />

<br />
As for Lute, and Drum, the Combine ones are really hard to beat for a non-twink Bard.
<br />

<br />
As for Armors, You'll be lvl 50 before you can manage a full suit of ANY of the LDoN armors hehe.  The prices on the low level versions are ridiculous.  Look in the Bazaar for some low level gear that isn't overpriced (recommended level items are good, they grow with you.), get a general idea of the price, and start Farming trash drops for plat.  I farmed stacks of droppables from lvl 1, by the time I was lvl 10 I had well over 700pp in the Bank simply because I looted and vendor sold everything That could stack, by the time I filled up 3 or 4 backpacks full of gear it was time to visit the trainer again anyway.
<br />

<br />
Don't really go to Paludal.  No cash at all drops there unless you get a Bandit group, then you have to deal with mr ninja looter.  Not worth the hassle to me.  Just keep doing what you are doing.
<br />

<br />
At this level do alot of melee soloing if you are gonna solo.  As soon as you get your first Slow/Snare song, you can twist it with Haste, and regen, and you should do fine.  Don't want to let your defense skill get behind.  You can also practice Lull pulling and general puller skills etc.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Going into Kurns Tower would be great for you, try to get in a group, or solo the first floor till you outgrow it.  Once you are confident enough in your abilities you can start working your way down to the Ikky Berserkers Club Camp, and get yourself a not too shabby weapon that tends to sell for a couple k in the bazaar, along with some terrific EXP.  There are also some minor gear items that drop down there occasionally that you might can use.
<br />

<br />
Once you outgrow Kurns you can head over to the Estate of Unrest, and solo inside the building, there you can get some very good pulling/lull practice, and deffinately get your defense up.  But groups prefered inside unless you are decently geared.  A good healer along with you would make it nice though.
<br />

<br />
By the time you leave here you should be at a minimum of lvl 28 or 29 if you stayed in the right areas.  Then head over to highkeep a couple levels.  Once you ding 32/33ish follow your little hearts desire.
<br />

<br />
As far as working instrument skills if you can leave your computer on all night, the best way to get em up is go to PoK before you log equip an instrument, play the appropriate song to raide skill, turn off your monitor, and go to sleep, you'll wake up with Max skill most of the time.  I also do this with swimming<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif" border="0" alt="Big Smile" hspace="2" />

Anything else you might need to know right now has already been covered.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Ever since they started putting a number on instrument descriptions indicating the modifier, non-bards are starting to figure out what instruments are good.  However, there are two very common LDoN drop instruments that are worth looking for in bazaar:
<br />

<br />
Trueborn Drum of Dark Rites, Primary, 2.4 mod
<br />
Bloodstained Flute, Primary, 2.2 mod
<br />

<br />
Swapping instruments into your Primary slot is MUCH easier than secondary (one click instead of three).
<br />

<br />
A Primary Lute is the toughee though.  If you can convince people to do Guk LDoNs, there is a cheap 1.8 Primary Lute you can get there with points.  (A REAL nice 2.6 mod Primary Lute in Rajukan, hehe... 570 points though)
<br />

<br />
For armor, you might consider having someone make you some Gothic Steel Armor.  It is blacksmithed, and trivials somewere around 170-200.  If you do LDoNs, forage as much as you can.  Each of the LDoN smithed armors require a foraged component for the tempers.  These can be bargaining tools with the person making your stuff.
<br />

<br />
People also do those LDoN armors for skillups.  Dumpster Dive (check the vendors) at the PoK forges, and see if people have dumped off their LDoN skillup pieces there.  I don't recall the prices the vendors give you, but I think they aren't as silly as what vendors want for fine steel etc.</span></td>
