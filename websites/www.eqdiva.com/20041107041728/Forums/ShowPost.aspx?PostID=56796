<br />
Originally, I played a bard called Mozi on Veeshan.  I started around the release of Velious.  I was a member of a loose guild at first, and then a mid-level raiding guild.  I got tired of the game and quit, leaving my character and a guild that was farming the east wing of Temple of Veeshan just before PoP came out.
<br />

<br />
<i>2. Why did you join Molto? </i> 
<br />

<br />
I had stopped playing the game for several months, but I still frequented EQDiva's boards.  I saw Klapton's thread about starting a group of bards that would work and fight together, and it really got me interested.  A month later, Sony sent me an email, giving me a free month of play time in order to hook me back in, and it worked.  I created my new bard just after the guild was officially started.
<br />

<br />
<i>3. What are your favorite memories of Molto? </i> 
<br />

<br />
Wow... quite a few here, I'll list some of the most notable:
<br />
My first really great memory of Molto was of Pajaull helping me with my newby armor.  He was extremely generous with his time, and remains to this day one of the kindest people I've met.
<br />

<br />
My first true all-bard grouping experience was in Splitpaw, where as part of a 6-bard team (aka a rolling ball of death), we handled content that some groups 10 levels higher than us often struggled with.
<br />

<br />
Growing up as a guild often involves a lot of pooling of resources and time.  We brought it together in a big way to get ourselves some Thunderous Drums of Karana.  It was a frequent thing for everyone online to smash their savings to help buy a TDoK for a guildie.  The selflessness of the guild was frequently and redily tested, and we shined.  It was beautiful.
<br />

<br />
I have several fond memories of being part of a bard charm kite-team in Eastern Wastes in my 40's, and in Western Wastes in my early 50's.  One time, Pajaull and I teamed up and killed the big named mammoth there when we were both 52 (that's a level 63 mob).
<br />

<br />
Later, as I approached 60, I decided that I would go and get a Lute of the Howler in Velks.  I led 12 different groups down there.  The last one had 4 bards in it, and I had the distinct pleasure of winning it in the company of some very good friends.  
<br />

<br />
One of my most personally rewarding roles in the guild is being an armor smith.  When LDoN came out, the smithed armor that came with it helped my smithing career to take off, and a lot of bards in Molto continue to wear pieces I've smithed for them.  
<br />

<br />
My fondest memory, and greatest honor, was to be Molto's first epic bard.  In a sense, my epic is very much the guild's epic, as I had tons of help getting it done, and a number of people either gave me some of the quest pieces, or helped me camp them.  The culmination of the epic quest, the Trakanon raid, was a real breakthrough for me and for the guild, and the effort helped set the stage for a number of other Molto bards to get their own epics.  We even have some bards outside the guild asking for our help with their epic quest.
<br />

<br />
<i>4. What is your typical day in Molto like? </i> 
<br />

<br />
I raid a lot with AWNN, our high-level raid ally.  We do mostly PoP stuff.  When we're not raiding, I do a wide variety of things, from tradeskills to recruiting to grouping with alliance and guild members.  I try to vary my game up week to week.
<br />

<br />
<i>5. Any other comments you would have about your time in Molto are welcome. </i> 
<br />

<br />
I wouldn't be playing this game if it weren't for Molto Espressivo.  I've never heard of a guild that works like we do, and the experience and challenge of the guild has been terrific.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span><i>1. What was your EQ experience prior to joining Molto? </i>
<br />

<br />
I started EQ with the Velious expansion.  Klapton was my first toon, a Bard on Vazaelle server.  My playtime back then was much more limited than it is now, and I levelled slowly.  I did have lots of downtime at work, however, where I could hang out on the eqdiva message boards.  There I studied the art of barding outside the game to maximize the little bit of playtime I had.  I also became well known for providing helpful answers to newbie questions on the boards.
<br />

<br />
<i>2. Why did you join Molto? </i>
<br />

<br />
Orignally, my idea was simply to have SIX bards play together once a week, to see what a full group of Bards could do.  I had not idea at the time that it would be big enough to be a guild.  When we became a real guild, since iIt was my crazy idea, everyone made me be the leader of it too.  I didn't really have any desire (nor do I now) to be in CHARGE of anything.  So, you will notice that Molto has very few rules, and a very care-free atmosphere most of the time.
<br />

<br />
<i>3. What are your favorite memories of Molto? </i>
<br />

<br />
The first real &quot;Rolling Ball of Death&quot; was a run through the Warrens when we were somewhere around lvl 10.  It was insanely fun seeing all those Kobalds jumping all over and &quot;Wincing&quot; from six bards singing Chords of Dissoance, lol.
<br />

<br />
When we were all very young, and had next to no money at all, Stretto made a brave dash to Katta Castellum to get two Combine Drums and a Combine Lute.  That was all we could afford at the time, having pooled all our cash together.  I got the Lute, since I was the designated Instrument Twister of the group, hehe.
<br />

<br />
That night in Splitpaw was a BLAST.  Paw has always been one of my favorite zones, and I have the spawn memorized to this day.  It can be charm-pulled in pairs beautifully.  We learned many things in that dungeon, including the fact that 5 bards singing mez on a caster makes it pretty much impossible for them to cast... EVER, lol.  We were almost all still in our 20s, and well below the proper levels to be hunting in there,  (AND untwinked, mind you!), and we KICKED BUTT.
<br />

<br />
It was Vyvache that spotted that TDoK in bazaar that night.  It was actually within our reach, if we ALL gave what we had.  So we did.  We gave it to Ayuir, who was our highest level bard at that time.  She had been waiting patiently, working on AAs and tradeskills to pass her time while waiting for us to all level up.
<br />

<br />
Our first allbard LDoN mission was another memorable moment.  We have done many of them since, but I remember 5 of us doing a Mistmoore mission in our 50s, and kicking butt.  And we did NOT kite.  (We have successfully aggro-kited mobs in LDoNs as well).
<br />

<br />
<i>4. What is your typical day in Molto like? </i>
<br />

<br />
Well, I generally log on, say hi, and see what's happenning.  I also raid frequently with AWNN, so I usually see if they are keeling anything.  If anyone in the guild is doing and epic camp, I will almost always head straight there and help out.  
<br />

<br />
After checking what's up, I usually go LFG.  I used to solo a lot, but have grown tired of it over the years.  I love the interaction of group play best, of all the activities in EQ.  I like it better than raiding, better than soloing...  I especially love pulling and crowd controlling for groups.  Needless to say, I get frequent invites to pull for LDoN missions.  If it is a hard mission, I usually die a couple times, and whine a lot about how much my armor sucks.
<br />

<br />
<i>5. Any other comments you would have about your time in Molto are welcome.</i>
<br />

<br />
I have had a blast.  I feel very good about what Molto has become: something much larger than my original vision ever dreamed it would be.  This is the most generous, fun-loving bunch of people I have ever encountered in my EQ experience.  Thank you all for making my little dream a reality.</span></td>

<br />
Started playing EQ in Beta 4. Made first character on March 19, 1999. Dorf Cleric. PLayed to 54 when level 60 became avail then got burnt. Played a druid and mage to 40. Moved to another server fresh start characters. Made a 57 shaman and 54 monk combo dou box. Went to FV and now have a 65 BST and this newbie Bard.
<br />

<br />
2. Why did you join Molto?
<br />

<br />
I joined Molto to have companionship in chat and in community. To at least have someone that understands the bard if something should go wrong and I cant figure out whats wrong. Molto seem full of helpful peoples and it seemed like fate. 
<br />

<br />
3. What are your favorite memories of Molto?
<br />

<br />
Still fairly new so will have to get back on this one later. 
<br />

<br />
4. What is your typical day in Molto like? 
<br />

<br />
Funny chat, kite, ask questions and kite some more. Rinse then repeat when another guildie of Molto or another in our chat channel comes online.
<br />

<br />
5. Any other comments you would have about your time in Molto are welcome.
<br />

<br />
So far I am happy with things. My BST was a starting member of Legacy of Sha guild long ago. So, I know what its like to be in a restricted class enviroment and to learn to play a certain way. Its a challenge but fun if all goes well. Its like making history happen. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
I started playing right after the kunark expansion came out.  Since then I have been playing off and on depending on where I'm living and working at the time.  I played a enchanter, monk, shaman, SK (2 of them actually), and bard all into their 40s, but have never gone 50+.  I usually get bored of a class in the 40s and start something new.  Anyway, I loved the bard the most, and FV rules.. Ill be here for while. <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />
<br />

<br />
<i>2. Why did you join Molto? </i> 
<br />

<br />
Ive been reading the EQDiva boards/etc for a loooong time.  Ive known about Molto since it was first made, but I was playing on Tholuxe at the time, and didnt want to have to start from scratch again. Lately, however, I have noticed a change for the worst in a lot of the other servers (I wont rant about it here, heheh), so I made my move to FV and Molto. If I hadnt read about Molto on these boards, I might have just quit EQ all together instead of making the switch.
<br />

<br />
<i>3. What are your favorite memories of Molto? </i> 
<br />

<br />
So far, just being guilded! It was wicked to see how much of an effort the officers make.
<br />

<br />
<i>4. What is your typical day in Molto like? </i> 
<br />

<br />
Well, I'm still relatively new to the server, so Im just killing everything in sight and scrounging for every spare plat I can get my hands on. The guild has helped a lot with getting a couple good lowbie items for me.  Hurray!
<br />

<br />
<i>5. Any other comments you would have about your time in Molto are welcome. </i> 
<br />

<br />
The kindness the people in this guild show their fellow members is simply amazing.  I've never seen anything like that in this game, and has restored my faith in a lot of things EQ related.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, time for me to get some more levels!
<br />

				<td colspan="2"><span>1. What was your EQ experience prior to joining Molto?
<br />
Oh lets see....After a buddy of mine harped about Eq for a year (he has been playing since beta) I finally buy and start playing a Bard on Terew Mar (Who is still only 47). This is before luclin came out. I have no other toons that I play. Except a few mules. I had a bit more time back then so I was able to play more. Also My work schedual was different so I had some early morning I was able to play while everyone else was gone. I still leveled really slowly as I liked to explore, tradskill, and Chat with RL friends. 
<br />

<br />
2. Why did you join Molto? 
<br />
To learn from other bards. I was there in the beginning when we decided to do this. I believe I was the one to recomend Firiona Vie due to the no drop code. And the fact that it was a RP server. I felt this would benifit a guild like ours. Unfortunatly I was deployed to Iraq aoon after guild formation. And I missed those early days of Figuring out what 6 bards could do. I wanted to be one of the few who would test the limits of hte bardic ways. I still kept in touch on these forums from Iraq so I wasn't totally in the dark when I got back.
<br />

<br />
3. What are your favorite memories of Molto? 
<br />
The warm welcom I recieved when I returned from deployment. How Proud I am of what this guild has become. 
<br />

<br />
How even to this day Feroce who GM Smithing, Raids with Allies, Helps with Guild Raids or mob hits, Still finds time to Make Armor for all the new recruits. 
<br />

<br />
How Scherzo Has led us to where we are today (with some help from his officers of course)
<br />

<br />
How Cantilena Seems to always be there to answer the youngers bards questions. (and some of mine)
<br />

<br />
How Sonatta Basically powerleveled me from 2 to 10 cause I wasn't on the week our guild got taged. 
<br />

<br />
Of course there are others but this is enough for now.
<br />

<br />
Oh yea
<br />
How Scherzo who use to be Klapton had a sig with this in it

4. What is your typical day in Molto like? 
<br />

<br />
Log on, do a /Who all Molto then a Who all Nell. Well no one on with in 10 levels of me. Back to kiting. Head somewhere and kite for 20 minutes then log back off. Sometimes saying a few words in guild chat. (the 20 minutes is normal. sometimes I get an hour or even a hour and a half but not frequently)
<br />

<br />
5. Any other comments you would have about your time in Molto are welcome. 
<br />

<br />
For all those that have come and gone and will come. I wish the best luck. For those who leave, I hope they take with them some of the kindness, some of the willingness to teach and help others. Not just in EQ but in anything they do. For those who stay I would like to see this guild grow. Not into an uber Time+ guild but into a bigger strongetr family of bards. A place where bards can learn to be the best bards. Where there is always the willingness to help your guild mates. (not neccisarily droping your curent raid/kite/group to help someone who just logged in, but with a bit of planning or notice.) And not just your guild mates but others as well. Cause really, thats what bards do. At least in everything I read. There always the rouge but still do the right thing. A selfish bard is jut...well tacky.
<br />

PS I like the fact we take up almost two pages of the EQDiva bard roster for Firiona Vie

				<td colspan="2"><span>1. What was your EQ experience prior to joining Molto? 
<br />
I started playing EQabout one month after release, started with a wizard DE on CT server, moved to Prexus when it came online as a newbie server, there i have a 59 cleric (my highest char), and a 55 bst.  Got a better job that takes up more of my time, good for real life but bad for EQ, suddenly i was in a situation where I would never again have the time to put into hours and hours long raids, and quests.  Was looking at never again gaining any of those nice NO DROP items..... then i remmbered that there are hardly any no drops on FV.
<br />
2. Why did you join Molto? 
<br />
I came to FV and chose to be a bard as I had not really played one before and it seeemed like a well rounded class able to fill many different rolls and functions.  LIttle did i know how darn great barding was, had i a clue before i would have beeen a bard these passed five years !!!
<br />
3. What are your favorite memories of Molto? 
<br />
I like SInfonia, Sonnatta, Feroce, Starpoint, Scherzo, and Klapton heheh..... they are always helpful with information and very willing to help each other out in a pinch.  sorry if i didnt spell your names right, and sorry if i left someone out, in truth i like you all very much.
<br />
4. What is your typical day in Molto like? 
<br />
Typical day is like this... try an AoE pull in dulak, get too close to the mob bundle, die.... ask advice to guild while doing my CR, recieve good advice and try again,  pull mob bundle, get a lag spike, die.... relay funny story to guild while doing CR #2.... try pull again , all goes well, mob bundle is down to 4% life, random monk_01 walks up to me watching in wonder, gets in my way, I bump into him , my circle is interupted just enough .... mobs kill me and then kill monk.... Random_monk_01 tells you WTF!
<br />
I splain to monk why he should form now on stay back from an aoe'ing bard from now on.  He understands and tells me he is sorry. I do CR #3, .... total exp lost so far = 1.75 yellow bubbles.
<br />
I pll one last time before bed, all goes well and mobs die, total exp gained = 2 yellow bubbles .... total gain for the day after factoring in deaths, = .25 of a yellow.....
<br />
But at least I are having fun!!!
<br />
5. Any other comments you would have about your time in Molto are welcome.
<br />
I helped kill Ragefire in skyfire mtns at level 38, was not second guessed at all due to the reputation of Molto.
<br />
Helped kill Phinny in Kedge Keep at level 48 with only two other molto bards, (think it was Scherzo and Starpoint ... memory bad but am almost sure)  was a great learning experiencee for me to see how bards can work together to take down mobs that otherwise take one or two well balanced groups of other classes.
<br />
I have learned more about the alternate ways of approching the game and had a better time playing the passed month or so with Molto than my entire 5 years playing any other character on my other servers.

Laugh it up, but this is my very first character ever. I wanted to play since forever ago, but i never had a comp that could support EQ til now....so im reeeeeeeal late. 
<br />

<br />
2. Why did you join Molto? 
<br />
I joined molto because I love bards, and I would feel very alienated in a guild that didnt appreciate my class as much as I did. Maybe if they conceded their classes were not as cool as mine, I would join them...hehe JK. Really though, I liked the idea of being able to ask anything anytime and get an answer...even at 4am. You think a cleric could tell me my mana song was in the EC tunnel. I feel that I have an advantage over a non-Molto bard: before I joined, if i didnt know something, I would ask a high level bard for the answer and do what he said....thats if he could remember, wasnt to busy, or was even willing to answer me. Now if I dont know something I /guild and get ten high level bards telling me so much info...it's great. Who wouldn't want that kind of resource. I also was looking forward to grouping with other bards and learning some new tricks.
<br />

<br />
3. What are your favorite memories of Molto? 
<br />
I am very new to Molto, and I have very few experience...but I have gotten nothing but lots of help and kindness since I joined (even when nobody thought I was listening they were so kind<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" /> )
<br />

Die...ask what I did wrong.....Die....ask where I can go where I wont die.....Die there too... get sick of dying, and hope Molto doesnt get sick of questions....ect.
<br />

<br />
5. Any other comments you would have about your time in Molto are welcome.

I am really looking forward to getting up to higher levels and being able to go on raids and help people out as much as they help me. Unfortunately I keep dying <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-6.gif" border="0" alt="Sad" hspace="2" />.

				<td colspan="2"><span>1. What was your EQ experience prior to joining Molto?
<br />

<br />
I first started playing EQ about 2 years ago when I picked up a copy of PC Gamer that had a free 30 day trail of New Dawn.  I remember letting my 56k download the 8 hour update thinking &quot;this had better be worth the wait!&quot;
<br />
Since then I have played nearly all of the classes trying to figure out what I wanted to do.  I took a (forced) break during the 2nd Gulf War due to an RAF reserve callup, which lasted about a year.
<br />
I came back a started a Pally and made a good friend in a mage on the VS server.  Unfortunatly he was able to put in more time than I could and he was soon 20+ levels ahead of me and in a good raiding guild ( I am still trying to tempt him into making a bard<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif" border="0" alt="Big Smile" hspace="2" /> )
<br />
I re-rolled a bard after the pally got boring - searched the net for a good bard site and the rest is history<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />
<br />

<br />
2. Why did you join Molto?
<br />

<br />
I joined Molto because I wanted to fell a part of something.  I had never been in a guild before and after reading the Molto board I decided that I should give it a shot.
<br />
Also, I wanted something that would keep me interested.  I have had so many toons up to 25-30 but lost interest in them.  The idea of an all bard group sounded like something that could be alot of fun.
<br />
My final reason for joining was that after reading guide after guide, I knew that playing a bard was not going to be straight forward and easy... I was going to need help, and who better to help than people who have tons of experience in the class?
<br />

<br />
3. What are your favorite memories of Molto?
<br />

<br />
Well, I have only been in the guild for 3 weeks and am still very new.  During my time here, people have always had time to answer my questions and help me out.
<br />

<br />
4. What is your typical day in Molto like?
<br />

<br />
Get home from work - load up EQ - dive in a pond and practice wind and swimming while I have dinner and a shower - run around for a while until I settle on what zone I want - kill/die/run to zone etc <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif" border="0" alt="Big Smile" hspace="2" /> 
<br />

<br />
5. Any other comments
<br />

<br />
I am really looking forward to leveling up and seeing just what a bard can do.  I have never made it to the middle/high end of the game and cant wait to join the &quot;higher ups&quot; raiding etc.
<br />
However, I dont intend to level too fast as I want to make sure I keep my skills high (a lesson a have learnt from previous characters).

3 Years on Karana, in that time I have raised a 65 Ranger, 57 Bard, 54 Shaman, 54 Druid, and 47 Warrior.  Just got bored with the same ole same ole.  The Bard was one of  my newest toons, and I found the Bard one of the most fun.  But quickly bored of typical gameplay.

New Challenges, New People, New goals, and a New Outlook.  Hopefully all that will transfere into new fun.

				<td colspan="2"><span>1) I started EQ 3 years ago, on Sept 1, 2001.  One of my sons had &quot;borrowed&quot; the account of a friend and was playing.  I was looking over his shoulder while he negotiated the tree city in Kelethin-- drunk.  I thought at the time that it was a very strange game.  He talked about wizards and clerics and good and evil.  My youngest was dying to play, so on a whim I bought the game, installed it on my computer at work and tried it (testing it out of course for it's appropriateness for young minds!)
<br />

<br />
My first character was a wizard.  I was so dumb that I put all my points into wisdom and immediately drowned my character in the lake in Felwithe, losing my newbie note.  I couldn't figure out how to get out of the water.  I was standing, bewildered and depressed when a very kind lady wizard saw me, and actually talked to me!  Even more surprising, she helped me, showed me the trainer, gave me money and clothes and directions!  I was so impressed that there was another human being playing the same game as me who was helpful and kind that I was instantly hooked.  I never forgot that lesson-- the people playing EQ are real.  Every single char has a human being behind it.
<br />

<br />
2) I was playing my 55 bard on Saryrn when I read about Molto Espressivo.  Also, one of my Guildies, Scat(who is now Raadil in Molto), had made a char on FV for the first all bard get together and he had related the antics of a group of bards who could not understand each other's language, had no weapons or gear, and were zerging the pit in Shar Val.  I was facinated at the prospect of learning the things I had only read about on eqdiva, so I made a bard and joined them the very next week.
<br />

<br />
3) Oh my favorite memories of Molto, gosh lets see...  Scherzo drowning in Oasis while Krescendo and I died laughing.  Errrr, Scherzo drowning in the pool in PoK, while afk training... Our first excursion into Split Paw, where Scherzo was practicing intimidation and it actually worked!  (We all died laughing!)  Trying to kill Misterioso on his first day in Molto by using him as an experimental subject as Scherzo and I tested songs on him in the arena.  Misterioso showing me the secrets of Norrath, the windmills in Steamfont (one of my favorite memories...) and the heights of Felwithe (a stunning view.)  Some of the greatest groups I have ever had-- fear kiting in LOIO, and I got to be the puller!  The memories are many and wonderful...
<br />

<br />
4) In the beginning, my day was: Log in and start hunting for bone chips and CB belts to level up new members.  I also spent many, many hours creating tarnished weapons and converting them into ore, selling the ore and buying backpacks and songs for the new members who joined daily.  Huge chunks of time were spent on language lessons for all.  Now I log on, say hi to everyone and get to work.  I talk to new bards, give out gear if I have it, invite new members, check the raid channel for upcoming events, solve guild problems (not many of those but they do pop up from time to time.)  I am an Officer, a Diplomat, a Mommy, a Teacher, a Translator and a Cheerleader.  I wear many hats in Molto.
<br />

<br />
5)  I love Molto.  I have watched it grow from the very beginning of its existence to now.  I have enjoyed every single minute of being a bard on FV.  I love my friends.  I thank Misterioso and Freedym for dying for me and for putting up with me in all my idiocy as I try to learn to be a better bard.  I thank you all for making Molto what it is-- the most unique experience in all of EQ!

				<td colspan="2"><span>1) I started playing EQ shortly after Velios came out, 3 1/2 years ago.  My first guild ever was a very lowbie, &quot;nobody knows what they're doing so let's all work together&quot; very family-oriented guild on the Nameless.  To me, that's exactly what a guild should be like, everybody friends, actually spending time together doing stuff and having fun (NOT soloing all the time for the xp).  I've grown my own crop of characters, a 49 wizard, a 42 warrior, 34 cleric, etc.  To my friends I'm known as &quot;the man with the thousand alts&quot; Lol.  I've trained people in playing EQ several times, from EQ newbies to people that just wanted to learn t0 play (insert class here) better.  
<br />

<br />
2)  Every time I try a new class, the first thing I do is go to the class-specific web site and read as much as I possibly can, in this case EQDiva.  After reading guides and such, I made my bard on the nameless and tried to do them, I was miserable at playing a bard, lol.  Practice, practice, it was a challenge, barding was THE most concentration and skills and total-knowledge-of-the-game intensive class I've every played.  So, it became my turn to learn.  I saw the post for the bard-only guild on FV and just had to join!  I haven't looked back since.  (Well okay, I look back all the time, but Koda keeps me looking forward too, so I don't run into those blasted trees!)
<br />

<br />
3)  Of course, the drunken parties we used to have!  Playing truth or dare and me daring Ayuir to run nekked through Felwithe from one zone to the other while playing DDD (and she lived!).  All-bard (well, five and a cleric) grouping in splitpaw, most fun I've ever had, even though I died once (or twice).  Spending a week (or was it two) teaching Cantilena how to play EQ, and then how to play a bard.
<br />

<br />
4)  My typical day in molto.  I tend to do one of several things lately... say hello in guild and be afk the rest of the night (or so it seems)....  call out to see if anyone wants to group, end up running to cobolt scar to solo wyverns....  call out to see if anyone wants to group, end up working on tradeskills (trying to figure out fishing-the bait spinning side right now)...  or going on a raid of some type (not really a huge fan of raids but they're necessary at some point).
<br />

<br />
5)  I'm the self-appointed &quot;trainer&quot; of the guild, so if you ever, I mean EVER, want some help with the &quot;how to&quot; of barding, please please please just ask, save me from my own self-inflicted punishment of tradeskilling!  Hehe</span></td>
