<br />

<br />
This is a guide that I'm taking time to write down so other bards can learn from my experiences. This guide is the honest truths behind how to pull well… so well that your group members will remember your name and ask you to join their future groups. Pulling is an essential part of being a bard, and it is essential that you do it well.
<br />

<br />
<b>Tools:</b>
<br />

<br />
The bard has a huge repertoire of pulling tools, but it is how you use them that makes them potent. Our basic pulling tools are: Mesmerize, Lull, Snare, Selo’s, Harmony of Sound / Occlusion of Sound, Bellow, Fading Memories, and finally, Yourself!
<br />

<br />
<u>Mesmerize</u>: This is the essential powerhouse for splitting in most cases. Pulling is Crowd Control (CC), therefore it shouldn’t surprise you that Mesmerize is an essential part of pulling. It’s all about eliminating mobs from the camp, controlling the one(s) you have, and making sure they’re focusing their attention on the right characters. 
<br />

<br />
The way you actually use Mesmerize in a pulling situation is simple: Most mobs run at the same speed, and those that don’t, will still run toward those that aggravate (aggro) them. I would say that 80% of all pulling situations can be reduced down to two mobs that need to be split. By mesmerizing one, you have just split the two mobs with no need for a tagger.
<br />

<br />
<i>“But I'm not level 63! I can't fade! What good will mezzing one mob do for me?” </i> 
<br />

<br />
This is a simple, yet seemingly common question. By mezzing one mob, you only have one mob following you back to camp at any given time. If you don’t have Fading Memories, you simply bring the un-mezzed mob to camp, mez it there (so the tank can get aggro without you getting hurt) and run back to the now awaken (or shortly awakening) mob you left behind. He’s going to follow you back to camp as well, where you mez him in a nice spot. Now you only have one mob in camp that’s active, allowing your group to kill off the first mob, and then they’ll have a second mob patiently waiting for them when they’re done. 
<br />

<br />
<i>“But where I am, the pulls are huge! I have to run for ages!”</i>
<br />

<br />
Re-aggro range in almost every zone in about the same as max line of sight. So if you’re pulling mobs that are super far away (Sol Ro’s Tower for instance) the mob that you mezzed wont aggro your camp. He WILL however re-aggro you when you move back into range. 
<br />

<br />
<u>Lull</u>: This tool is a huge advantage and a huge crutch at the same time. Lull is any spell that reduces the aggro range of any mob. Therefore when you lull all but one mob, and aggro the un-lulled mob, the others won’t assist. Easy cheesy right? (We’ll come back to this in a minute). 
<br />

<br />
<u>Snare </u> (Targeted): Can't lull? Can't mez? Say you’re level 65 and you’re pulling in MPG and you don’t have your new mez. Your wonderful beloved Lullaby of Morell doesn’t work. So all you have is fade, but fade doesn’t split very well now does it? So you’re f**ked. Right? Wrong.
<br />

<br />
Getting new spells is a pain in the butt. And even when you get those spells, they don’t always work 100% of the time. So, when you can't mez, and you can lull, you most likely can SNARE. So, how does snare work for splitting? Refer above. Remember how I said almost all pulling situations can be reduced down to one single split? Well, snare sure makes one mob run a whole lot slower than the other one doesn’t it? Well there you go. Use snare to place some distance between the mobs and fade off the one in the rear. Bam, there you go. Can't fade? Well, unless there’s some other form of CC in the group (e.g. root, chanter mez, ect) just kite the 2nd mob around while the group deals with mob 1.
<br />

<br />
Advanced uses for snare: Say you’re in a situation where there’s a zone full of mobs and a single unmezzable named in the middle somewhere. Now, you can't really mez every single one of those mobs can you? So you’ve *just got to* kill all the mobs between your group and the named in order to get to him right? Wrong. If the named isn’t immune to changes in run speed, just gather the whole mess of mobs into one gigantic train. Bunch them up and have the named on target. Snare the named, and run away with the train. Guess what? Now you’ve successfully placed a great deal of distance between the named and the train. Run towards the named, fade the train, and tag the named single. You win EQ!<u></u>
<br />

<br />
<u>Selo’s</u>: This is an easy one. If the mobs can't catch you, then there’s nothing to worry about. That’s what makes us the superior outdoor pullers in EQ. The reason I mention this is because you don’t exactly have Selo’s indoors (and I'm not talking about Selo’s Rhythm of Speed either – since that’s slower than Run 5 with a max percussion mod). If you can't use Selo’s, that doesn’t mean you can't pull! It just simply means that you’ve got to use your brain a bit more. Use snare, use distance, use mez to delay mobs… just don’t assume that because your ‘Uber Selo’s Speed’ stayed outside, that your pulling skills should as well.
<br />

<br />
<u>Harmony of Sound / Occlusion of Sound</u>: These are your major range attack tools. When you’re pulling a mob to camp, it’s important to have some distance between you and said mob, and it’s also important to lower their resists. In the majority of experience group situations, you’ll be expected to chain pull. Because of this, lowering the resists of a mob could mean all the difference in the world.
<br />

<br />
For example, if you’re pulling in Wall of Slaughter, you may have an incoming mob reach the camp before the previously pulled mob is dead. If you’ve used Harmony of Sound, you’re almost 100% guaranteed to land mez on the mob you just pulled. Now the mob you pulled is nicely parked in the middle of the camp, allowing the group to finish off the first mob, and start on the second at their leisure. You should also aim to slow mobs on incoming before you mez them, and de-buffing them is almost required to land slow on mobs.
<br />

<br />
Advanced use: If you to happen to pull a mob into your camp before the last one is dead, and the tank is farther out than he/she should be for you to place your pull in a central location, you might just end up training the tank with the second mob (that is for a second or two before mez lands). Now you don’t really want to keep mezzing mobs further and further out to prevent training the tank, so what do you do? If you’ve used HoS or OoC on the mob, you can be confident enough to run deep into your camp and sit while your mez finishes casting. Yes I said SIT. If you sit down, the mob will ignore everyone but you, and come directly for you. If you time it right, mez will land right as he’s about to smack you. Placing the mob in the center of the camp, and amazing your group mates.
<br />

<br />
Advanced use two: If you use mez / fade to split a mob, usually, you’ve got to fade in order for the mezzed mob to forget about you. But, if you fade while running to camp, you might end up losing your single mob, and if you fade in camp, you run the risk of other characters transferring aggro from you through buffs / heals. The best way to combat this problem is to fade with half a second left on your HoS cast. That way you fade, and finish casting HoS a half second later, reaggroing the single mob, and allowing you to run safely (invis’ed) back to camp.
<br />

<br />
<u>AA Boastful Bellow</u>: Bellow is a wonderful pulling tool. First off, it’s instant; secondly, it’s got a huge range; and thirdly, it does direct damage. Say you’re tagging single mobs from a monk… That three second cast on HoS may very well take too long, and before you know it, the mob is resetting into a mess of adds. Use bellow! Say you need to aggro something that’s very deep inside a mess of mobs (like the snare situation I explained above). Use bellow! Say you aggro a train, mez the target mob, run the train away, fade them, and now you’ve got to break the mez on the target mob. Use bellow! Say you mezzed a pull too far out from your camp. Cast mez and with one or two seconds left on the cast, use bellow!
<br />

<br />
<b><u>Please do NOT post exploitative uses of bellow here.</u></b>
<br />

<br />
<u>Fading Memories</u>: I’ve gone over the majority of uses for this tool, so I’ll leave it with a few basic tips. Make sure you fade a good deal away from see invis mobs. Don’t fade when brining a mob into camp (You want to keep aggro until it’s exchanged to the tank. If you die, you get a rez – if the cleric dies, you get a corpse run). Don’t fade in range of casters. Don’t use fade like it’s Feign Death, because it’s not. If you’ve got nice mana regen, use fade to invis while playing songs (Selo’s, regen, ect). Use fade as a REALLY EXPENSIVE invis if you don’t have a spare flute, and if you can't use Song of Travel due to zone levitation restrictions.
<br />

<br />
<u>Yourself</u>: Now I don’t mean, <i>“You can do it! You are your best tool!” </i> I mean: you. As in, a sack of meat and bones inside that armor. Let me explain. Remember how I said that lull is a crutch for most bards? There’s a reason for this. Lull is nothing more than a nice comfort tool. It’s not something we actually need. Aggro is a tricky subject, and if you don’t understand it fully, you will never be a good puller. When you aggro a mob, other surrounding mobs on the same faction line assist. Now, if you walk into a crowded room, pull out Dennon’s Desperate Dirge (our quad nuke), and blast a mob in the center, you’re going to get the whole room. That’s because: 1. You used a quad nuke and hit multiple targets, and 2. You used a song that creates a large yell for assist. Depending on the method of aggro you use, the mob will call for assist. This is generally called a mob’s “yell” (it has other names, but we’ll use yell for the sake of simplicity). Now, the severity of a mob’s yell for help is directly dependant on what you’re doing to him. If I walked into your house and nuked you, you would say really loudly, <i>“WTF OUCH!” </i> Which would cause you to get up, yell some more, and cause your mom, dad, brother, sister, dog, and goldfish to assist you. Which would be bad for me, since I would have a massive family of mobs training after me.
<br />

<br />
Now if you just saw me walk by your window, and I was KOS to you, you might get out of you lazy boy and run out the door chasing me. If you happen to run by your mother, she might add, and I would have pulled two mobs from your house instead of one.
<br />

<br />
But, if I saw your mother in the kitchen, and stood in front of just HER window, she might run out of the house via the backdoor attached to the kitchen. Allowing me to run her back to camp. Now I have successfully pulled your mom out of your house, single.
<br />

<br />
So, how the h*ll does all this work? It’s simple. Say you’re doing a LDoN adventure and you come across a room with several mobs. Now in LDoN, resist rates are insane for lull if you’re not level 70, and if you’re not sporting a healthy amount of charisma. So you’re screwed. Right? Wrong. You DON’T NEED LULL TO PULL! Remember how I said almost all pulling situations can be reduced down to a single split? Well my fine bard friend, use proximity aggro to nab the outer most and closest mob. Just walk in, and inch your way forward towards said mob, inch by inch, and he’ll eventually see you, aggro with hardly any yell, and most likely come single out of the room. If you get two, mez one! Mob spawns are DESIGNED to be split by pullers. There’s always a pattern to pull them using proximity aggro, and get singles all day long. Will you get hurt by these mobs doing this? Yep. Will you die multiple times trying to perfect this skill? Yep. Will you be renowned for you amazing pulling skills after learning how to do this effectively? You betcha. 
<br />

<br />
<b>Further basic tips:</b>
<br />

<br />
If the mob is going to hit you (like in a LDoN adventure where Selo’s isn’t an option), walk backwards. Your defense is almost doubled when you’re looking at a mob, as opposed to having your back turned.
<br />

<br />
Get that charisma up! So you’ve got 10k HP’s unbuffed, and you’ve got a billion +attack items, but your CHA is 102… Have fun trying to CC… have fun trying to do anything detrimental to a mob. CHA is our MOST IMPORTANT STAT, PERIOD!
<br />

<br />
Make use of the mouse scroll wheel 3rd person camera. This will easily allow you to ‘peer’ around corners, and target mobs without them seeing you.
<br />

<br />
Make use of levitation. Can't cast on what you can't see, and levi makes this a whole heck of a lot easier
<br />

<br />
Running a moderate system? Guess what guys? If you can't have shadows, reflective water, all the high models, complex sky, maxed out spell effects, bump mapping, and high quality textures on without having lag: Turn that crap off. Lag can make or break a puller. It’s more important to have zero lag and have the game look like crap, than it is to have a ton of lag and be able to see a “prettier” EverQuest.
<br />

<br />
Use Song of Highsun creatively. You can gate almost anything in the game with this song. This makes pulling a single named mob from a room full of named mobs much more plausible. This is very situational, so I won’t go into specifics.
<br />

<br />
Don’t damage mobs on incoming. Just get it out of your head. Later on, you’ll end up generating too much aggro, or dropping a mob into summoning HP’s. It’s just a bad idea.
<br />

<br />
On raids, learn how to discern between something that you’re capable of, and something that you’re suited for. Some pulls are more geared towards monks, some pulls are not. Admitting a pull is more suited for a monk doesn’t denigrate you in any way, it simply shows that you have what’s best for the raid in mind. (So don’t trot off and expect everyone to let you pull everything just because <i>“Mitcheypoo said bards can do anything!”</i>)
<br />

<br />
----
<br />

<br />
Well, I'm pretty sure this covers the art of pulling. With these tools you can easily pull most of EverQuest. Use them, enjoy them, die attempting them, and learn from them. You’ll never have to put up a LFG tag ever again.
<br />

PS. If you’re going to reply to this posting, please refrain from posting argumentative comments. I am end game. My credentials are very real. Most people that chose to argue on boards have no idea what they’re talking about. This guide is 100% true, and 100% accurate. Feel free to add in anything I may have missed, but please make sure you’re adding HONEST and TESTED methods. Don’t post stuff like, <i>“well this d00d i n0 says ___________ is teh l33test pullin strat!!!111oneoneone.”</i>

Hope this helps,

One thing I forgot to mention is the importance of a pulling pattern. There's an old saying that has warmed the ears of many students during their shop class: &quot;Measure twice, cut once.&quot; This little bit of knowledge can be used to help us pull more efficiently. More often than not, groups tend to stay stationary in the form of &quot;camps&quot;. This allows the puller to control the rate in which the group fights, while the group sits in a relatively safe location. If you start off by splitting and pulling the surrounding mobs, eventually you'll either run out of mobs, or start to get repops. To make your job a whole lot easier, simply do all of your splitting the first time you pull a spawn cycle, pulling a &quot;key marker&quot; mob first. A &quot;key marker&quot; mob is something that can be seen from camp, which will let you know when the cycle has completed itself. So, what you're literally doing is: Pulling your key marker mob, pull surrounding mobs in a logistical pattern, and when your key marker mob repops, you know that in the time it takes for 1 mob to respawn, you can kill X amount of mobs. When your key marker repops, pull him, and then start your logistical pattern over, grabbing mobs as they repop. You'll essentially pull twice, split once. (Using this tactic will cut down your pull times dramatically – since you’ll know exactly where your next pull is coming from, and you’ll only have to split once, in the beginning– and significantly reduce the chances of adds during pulls). </span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Nice guide.  Something to add here though is use Kazumi's Note of Preservation if you are pulling mobs that are faster then you.  This song has saved me many times on certain pulls.  Also use jump to gain distance.  If you jump and run, you will move quicker then what you are pulling.  If you are pulling a mob like an anuek in rs, you might want to try to use snare to gain some distance.  I really don't use lull anymore even on old school stuff.  I prefer mez pulling.  Mez a mob pull what you get if its too much mez another then bring rest to group.  Have tank get on one and mez other.  Then you can either fade or have some fun by mezzing everything.  One thing to remember is not be playing any songs or have healer heal you til you fade.  You kinda need a good FT pool to use this technique too.

No arguements at all with this information.  Very well written wisdom from someone I have never met, but has obviously been there and done that.
<br />

<br />
Pulling tool I would like to add is the use of Bind Sight.  Lull needs no Line of Sight, so bind sight + F9 a couple times and lull can ease the pull in a difficult room or where there is no room to mez/fade before you get back to the party.  Also, simple use of bind sight lets you study what needs to be done for a successful pull without risking accidental agro while snooping.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Just one advanced tip.
<br />

<br />
Mobs who are aggroing you because they are assisting the mob you make mad, don't normally make assist calls themselves.
<br />

<br />
Basically, if you tag/aggro mob A, and mob B adds, Mob C will not generally aggro off mob B.
<br />

<br />
Why is this relevant? It keeps entire zones from landing on top of you on a bad pull.  It also lets you do some funky things with pulls.
<br />

<br />
Lets say you want to run thru a zone full of mobs, and drop your target at the zoneline, you can.  
<br />

<br />
Example: Deep in the zone are 3 mobs.  Your target, and 2 adds.  Step 1.  Lull possible add A.  Step 2.  Youre down to a basic split.  But instead of splitting, Mez add B.  Your target will assist off the mezed mob, and begin to chase you.  This is pretty normal.  Step 3.  Click/Cast invis and start high-tailing it to zone in.  You have one advantage that no other class has, you can run and cast.  Step 4. Pray.  Step 5. Pray some more, cause its crucial you time this right.  As soon as your intended target is past all the mobs that would have taken hours to clear.  Mez/snare (if possible) and pound fade.  Mob is stopped dead in its tracks for the next 12 secs, allowing you to reaggro, while a HUGE train of mobs is sitting slightly back from you wondering why they are there (they assisted the mob you mezed, which has worn off by now, and began the Train of Doom).  Step 6. Pull it the rest of the way and beat it into submission.
<br />

<br />
How often you will use this is minimal, but it gives you food for thought.

<br />
Another thing to add to your posting is the importance of distance. In this situation you offered, if there's a decent distance between you and the mob you mezzed to split, when mez wears off, your chances of him running at you when he wakes up is decreased.
<br />

<br />
All of the tips in the above reply posts are accurate. Thanks for posting them guys.

Got another tip.
<br />

<br />
Walking the Dog.  Basically using Mez (Wind based, not Sing) with a push component to position a mob where you want it.
<br />

<br />
Granted this is a pulling guide, so here's how I use it in such situations.
<br />

<br />
Sometimes you'll find yourself with 4-5 mobs sitting in a room that cant effectively be split or lulled.  No distance to break line of sight, etc makes it tough to get singles.  
<br />

<br />
Tag the mob you want with your Wind Based Mez (or your highest level to ensure a lock).  Everything aggros, and you immediately Fade.  A mezed mob doesn't make a assist call.  Use your wind mez to walk the mob back to you (or at least outside assist range).  Since bard mezes overwrite each other regardless of level, you can use your highest level mez to maintain solid control of it, and just pulse your push mezes to get the mob where you want it.  If you get resists, reapply best mez.
<br />

<br />
I remembered this from last nights Rathe Council Run, when i was primary mezzer (arg), and had to position the mobs.
<br />
