From my experiance, Lev Tunnel and Observer has been the best xp places, due to the constant pulls and stuff. Some very nice bard stuff does drop here, such as Symphonic Saber, Desicated Halfling Mask, Ankelsmasher, Jade Inlaid Spaulders, and Tribal War Boots. If you don't wanna hunt here, there is also a few quests you can get that result in some nice stuff, if your faction is right with the sarnaks.

I have to say, it is the best EXP/Loot of my life. I have made aproximately 1.5k today due to the gems that sell for 50pp to the merchants IN ZONE. I also went through level 51 in 2 days here. That's right, I said it, 2 days. Here is how I have done it...<br><br>Songs to mem: Selo's Accelerating Chorus, Tuyen's Chant of Flame, Tuyen's Chant of Frost, Fufil's Curtailing Chant, Selo's Consonant Chain<br><br>Steps to success:<br><br>a) Sing SAC and grab a single wyvern near the SS zone<br>b) I like to chant them down in one of 2 ways depending on how I feel. The first method is to kite them around a rock about 100ft from SS tower. Just circle around until they die. The second, is to kite them up and down the long strip between SS tower and the dragon circle. The mobs will die in 2min or so, and I recommend that once they hit 1 bub of health, twist SCC and 2 chants. This way, they cannot gate back to their bind point (can loose mob sometimes)<br>c) If you do the above, you will not get hit. you can continuously pull the wyverns, they repop rather quickly, and using track it is not difficult to find a mob. However, if you cannot find a mob thanks to the quad kiting dr00dz that steal them all, simply run up into the SS tower, target one mob, then run down to the entrance to the tower and stick on your first DoT. This should pull 2+ mobs, sinse I am regarded as ally and 2 came down. However, if you get more you can always charm kite: show dem dr00dz what dey ain't neva saw!!!<br><br>You WILL do great here, I can not stress it enough: COME TO CS (just not on Karana, because I rule the zone on Karana!) Good luck, and I guarantee my method will work for you. Feel free to contact me on Karana (Triky) if you have any questions or suggestions. Thankyou :)<br><br>Triky Troubadour</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>HollandBard</b> (<i>1/30/02</i>) you can kill non-named wyverns and drakes here without taking down faction with CoV<br><br>1. Charm a Wyvern<br>2. Make him attack the Named Wyvern (Yvolcarn)<br>3. Charm breaks<br>4. Recharm and make him attack again<br>5. After 2 times the pet wyvern is very low on health (10-20%)<br>6. Now begin chantkiting the Wyvern with dots till he dies<br>7. Charm a new Wyvern and put it on the Named Wyvern(Yvolcarn) <br>8. Go loot the corpse when they are busy fighting.<br><br>Keep doing this till you are either almost out of mana, OR when the named Wyvern is nearing dead. You do NOT want to kill him! It gives a bad faction hit that will also effect the way the Wyverns and Drakes are looking at you... will give irritating adds. I killed the named Wyvern and my faction droped down alot, I now have to use the faction song to put them to doubious (non-kos).</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Guederian</b> (<i>1/16/02</i>) Cobalt Scar was made with bards in mind. Wow! Like everyone else has said, charm/chant kiting is the most killer solo exp I've seen. Loot is great. <br><br>Here is the recipe for success:<br><br>(1) Selo's Accelerating Chorus<br>(1) Pair Singing Steel Boots<br>(1) Set of CHR gear<br>(1) Nostrolo Tambourine (or better)<br><br>Let me take a moment to thank the EQ gods for creating Selo's Accelerating Chorus. IMHO it is the best song in my lineup. Imagine the possibilites kiting could have had for us if we had..... Hindsight is 20/20. Anyway<br><br>Get about 8 Wyverns mad at you. Yes, I said 8. Then charm one of them. Let him defend you and start getting beat to a living pulp by his bird friends. Once he is down to 1/4 health triple chant him. Dead bird. Kite the others away from the birds corpse, go back, loot the bird, and then try to pick the wyvern with the lowest health and charm him. Keep repeating until all are dead. About 10% of the time you will get a gem of some sort. The whole process takes about 10-15 minutes.<br><br>MAKE SURE YOU REPEATEDLY REPLAY SELOS. Dont wait until it's too late. If selos drops on you when 7 wyverns are chasing you, well bye bye bard. Get it playing each time the birds are slugging it out.<br><br>If a druid or other pesky mana muncher decides to pull steal you, dont say anything. Just go over and dispell his rooted Wyvern or quad kite. That does the trick. Remember this, the symbol for Svylian's Anti Magic really does look like Fufil's Curtailing Chant. That is a good way to explain your actions  during a petition. &quot;<br><br>Singing Steel boots help out a bit as well.<br><br>Gued - Bristlebane Champions, Bristlebane Server<br><br></span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Kenning Bubblebum</b> (<i>12/29/01</i>) I absolutely agree with Volumo (or whatever, sorry :P)<br><br>I went through 1 yellow from 49 to a yellow into 50 in two days. <br><br>Some tips:<br><br>GET the new selos! I have to only cast this twice during a normal wyvern kite, and only using mm drums.<br><br>DO NOT wander around unless you're ready for some action. I was walking down by the shore near the SS tower, got jumped by two bulthars, they must have atleast 20k of HP, took me 10 minutes each, crap loot too, not worth the effort soloing.<br><br>Once you get the hang of it pull 2 or 3 at a time. This way you only have to snare the last one since when in a pack the injured will not run nor pop back at spawn point. This will also save you from having to lev back up the cliff and worrying about no mobs. Only the really cocky, arsehole druids will try to pull one off yours.<br><br>I get about 1/4 blue per kill in 49 and 50, not too bad, but nothing better that I know of soloing. The gems are definitely worth it. I have managed to get both my arm and leg gems for when I'm ready to do vel armor quests, saves me about 3k right there. I've also made about 2k just looting change and cash gems and dropped pages and selling them to otters, then zone into SS and bank, pretty convinent!<br><br>Watch out for sirens and the foolish wizards and druids who get charmed by them.

I have spent 90% of my time from 49th to 54th (hit 54th last night) in CS.<br><br>There is generally many people here looking to kill wyverns (by the way, haunted seachests are few & they repop too slow to be good exp) So...1st step is to locate a dragon-birdie (my pet name for wyverns) ALL of them are blue to you at 51st, most at 52nd & well over half at 53rd. At 49-51st you will need to avoid the drakes during your pulls, but thats pretty easy & thier agro range is fairly small. <br><br>*side note* Bards who dont use SOW potions are not kiting to thier full potential. Twisting in Selo's or snare is a waste of a twist slot. I mean, keep them memmed, but dont use them unless your SOW wears off.<br><br>Back to the killing. Grab your dragon-birdie, pull him to the rock near the SkyShrine zone tower. If you could only find one, thats ok, run him around the rock till you he is about a bub away from death <br>IMPORTANT NOTE: Once a mob begins to run away from damage, if you are not near it, it will pop back to its spawn point. Once it starts running BE CLOSE to it, or you will lose it. If this seems unclear, you will understand what I'm talking about the 1st time it happens. You'll learn quick...you're a bard, you gotta be smarted than the average ogre ;-)<br>OH...another note...if you have 2 or more dragon-birdies chasing you, none will run, no matter how hurt they are.<br><br>Charm kiting here, is unreal...be SURE you take your 2 or 3 victems behind the rock near SS (I call it &quot;my&quot; rock...but I'm nutty like that)...if the drake wandering up & down the field sees your pet fighting, he will jump in & you will prolly have to zone.<br><br>You can begin single pulls with no worry of adds at 52nd (altho my faction *may* have had some bearing on this, but I dont think so)<br><br>DON'T mess with the named wyvern or drake (Yvolcarn & Azureake) They undercon & they hurt your CoV faction.<br><br>Wyvern Hides : 10pp per. Wait & some PC will come looking for them. (or use them for tailoring, if thats your gig)<br><br>Wyvern Meat : makes a +3 vs Magic meal using the Oyster Spices & Seaweed vinegar sold at the otters (they have an oven there too)<br><br>Non-quest flawed/chipped gems : 44-46pp per from vendor.<br><br>Quest Gems : Varies...but I will not sell one for less than 500pp. I've gotten 1000pp for one in the past. Quest Gems that drop here are : Nephrite, Chipped Onyx Saphhire, Flawed Topaz, Flawed Emerald, Jaundice Gems, Flawed Sea Saphhire. These are the Arm/Leg quest gems.

Seemed like my blue bubbles were being filled completely with every 5 or so kills, since I was in the group getting exp each time. If you were to sit in the beginning of the zone, and have someone pull Phase Spiders to your group, you could make some awesome EXP. You can't go much farther than this though.

Good easy exp from kiting manticors and the bigger wolves and mammoths.  A few tricks you will need to have mastered (which you probably already have):<br>(1) Know how to side-slip to out run 'normal' speed mobs (all the ones listed above are).  <br>(2) Weave the 3 standard targetable dots.  <br>(3) If your like me and don't have Selo's drum, get the tambourine!  This will drasticly cut down your kiting time.<br><br>For even better exp and a little excitement (not to mention nice loot):  Kill elites and the Chief.  Here's the tricks to get it to work:<br>Songs I have mem'd: Selo's 5, HoR 6, SSC 19, SBB 39, SAA 40, FCC 30, TCF 38, and TCF 46.<br>(1) Use SSC to invis into the thrown room, from there pick a likely target, don't worry if the oracle is there, we'll fix his wagon later.  Move to just outside the main building, you'll find with some experimenting that there is a spot on the gate's side that no orcs will argo you when you become visible.<br>(2) From that point switch to your drum and strike up a hit of Selo's, If you've picked a spot close enough, you'll find that your Dots can land on the target.  This will really piss them off, but they tend to have trouble getting around in their own building.  Your should run at this point, they will pop on you soon.<br>(3) Switch back to Selo's and make a quick exit of the compound.  Run around to the back of the fort.  Be sure to stay close to the wall.  Within a matter of seconds your target and probably his friends that were close will pop on you.  This is really the only risky part.<br>(4) As soon as they pop, make a mad dash South so as to avoid getting any more to pop on you.<br>If you only pulled one elite, and the oracle wasn't up, you should be able to just kite him or charm him onto a nearby manti.  If the oracle was up, you'll need to hit him twice with SAA to drop his sow, this will put him at normal speed.<br>If you pull multipul elites, just use our standard charming methods.<br>If you pull the Chief, keep in mind that he runs naturally at sow speed, so if you have to kite him you'll have to do the TCF+TCF+Selo's kite (fyi: be sure to shout to the zone just before he dies to warn of Avengers).<br>If you should pull the oracle with an elite or more, I will usally just ditch the oracle by dropping his sow, then just run'n his sow'd buddy to another corner of the zone to kill.  Alternately, just send an elite after him, I've found that one can usally get him really low, don't bother with him as a pet when he's low, just like the snow grif's, he'll heal himself first thing as your pet, a waste of your valuible charm time.<br><br>FYI: If you don't plan on using the ry'gorr armor, give it to lowbie guildies or them poor Rangers.  =)<br><br>Octun &quot;The Foolish Bard of... what's this server again?&quot;</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>kyepez</b> (<i>8/3/01</i>) Went to EW at 51.

When you zone in you'll notice that everything on track is green. Do not be alarmed. Make sure you've a guide with some keys though or I imagine you could spend some time with no exp to show for it. <br>Once you hav a guild procede to the top floor (you may or may not pick up alittle exp on the way). Once there, be mindful to avoid the traps that your guide should know about. Sorry I can't be more specific but I'm not an expert on the zone yet myself. Pull the various Familiars these should be low blues with the ocasional greenie mixed in. Finally, you'll start pulling the shadowed torches. These were all blue to me and fifty and quite a few were still blue to our 55th level rogue. When they've all been cleared out, you can procede into Tserrina's hall. Here you kill the Shrouded bats and the enraged vampires that spawn after the bats die. These and the torches will be the bulk of your exp but occasionally instead of a vampire, Tserrina herself will be the spawn that pops out! Tserrina is 99% resistant to all magic attacks so don't bother with debuffs. However, she is Excellent Exp. I got a full blue bubble from each time we killed her and an additional blue bubble from the torches and familiars inbetween spawns. Tserrina also has some great loot drops, including a unique robe for you're caster friends. <br>(During Tserrina fights I would take out my Lute and play Hymn and SoS to keep the tanks a live and help out the cleric. But make sure your group doesn't lack a few melee's, a cleric, and helpfully some pet casters. Tserrina can be tough.)<br><br>Raido<br>Bard of the 51st Song<br>Solusek Ro<br></span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#9999cc"><td colspan="2" nowrap><b>Trakanon's Teeth</b>&nbsp;<font size="1">Type=World Zone</font>|<font size="1">Tag=traksteeth</font></td><td align="right" valign="top">|</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"> (<i>8/6/01</i>) Also consider the 2/3 damage reduction for kiting. <br><br>As a 54th bard in a perfect world I would do 180hp/tick, but this<br>becomes 120hp/tick with the anti-kiting code.
