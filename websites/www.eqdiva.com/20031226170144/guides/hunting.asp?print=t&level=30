Grab your flute and invs your self to the graveyard.  While in the graveyard stay on the right side and kill the single spawn.  do NOT FEAR kite.  Tank it it not to hard to tank.

Between levels 30 and 34, you have several choices of places to group, and even solo if you're feeling adventurous.  Note that this is an outdoor zone, so Selo's is available if you run into trouble.<br><br>1. Gator Alley: This area, reached via the doorways above the entrance into the courtyard, contains roughly 15 alligators which will spawn between levels 20 and 30 and one rare spawn with placeholders that will spawn level 35 for the most part.  This is wonderful experience for a balanced level 30 group, and can be done, with difficulty by even a duo at level 34 or so.  Alligators, because they drop no loot to speak of, have an unusually high experience modifier.  Solo, you can try and charm down here, but adds during a break may make this a risky proposition.  The Steel Golem which is the rare, drops a piece of Ravenscale (rogue only armour) rarely.<br><br>2. The Sewers: This area, almost always camped, offers tremendous experience for a balanced group averaging their low 30s.  Alligators and the high level spawning lizards populate this area and multiple mob pulls are frequent.  Many of the lizards in this area (Judicators and Justicars) are clerics.  Additionally, Lizard Crusaders, which drop quest components for Darkforge (Shadowknight only armour) spawn here and are shadowknights and will Harm Touch your puller.<br><br>3. Throne Room #1:  This area offers roughly 15 or so lizard spawns and two hulking gorillas, along with the Tae Ew Templar rare and Tae Ew Diviner rare, which both drop a piece of Ravenscale (rogue only armour).  Action is almost always constant because of the sheer number of spawns, and can provide outstanding entertainment when you defeat that six or seven lizard battle.<br><br>4. Throne Room #2:  Usually only camped when TR1 is, there are more lizards and a Clay Golem rare with a Ravenscale rare drop, that spawn just behind the main throne room, which are, for the most part, a few levels higher than those in TR1.<br><br>5. Avatar of Fear: The &quot;boss&quot; of Cazic-Thule, a level 40 Shadowknight which is the god Cazic-Thule's incarnation on Norrath, lives in a green globe and has multiple lizard guards.  This area is good for a level 35ish group, and connects to the sewers, so lizards and alligators can be pulled from the sewers while the AoF room is empty.</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Gilgurth</b> (<i>3/2/01</i>) CT is an interesting place to hunt. If you go there earlier and hunt the entrance/courtyard/maze, you'll probably have to deal with some trains from the deeper areas. Also, as Whee pointed out, alot of the areas in CT will be fighting against multiples. With the recent changes to Pixie Strike, it is definitely possible to play crowd control in CT, and I would recommend it as a good learning grounds for such.</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#9999cc"><td colspan="2" nowrap><b>Crystal Caverns</b>&nbsp;<font size="1">Type=Dungeon</font>|<font size="1">Tag=crystalcav</font></td><td align="right" valign="top">|</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Lyrisa Nightingale</b> (<i>8/10/01</i>) 29-35 fight from the entrance of zone all the way down the ramp to the pit killing orcs.

Great experiance and bards are in high demand there. <br>35-45-Geonids... I know many of you are saying ack my geo faction. Did you know that Geonid faction goes up with time played. I've killed hundreds of them there. The geonids are at this point 3 levels from last time I killed one indifferant to me.

It's a fairly small dungeon, so a zone line isn't too far in case things get ugly.  There are a lot of casters, so oure resist songs are highly desired.  I've never had a problem finding a group; you'll generally end up grouping with monks because a lot of them go there for Crescent Armor.

If you are traveling thru and see Froon or Choon, look around for a griffawn. Charm the griff and have it beat on the cyclops. It will get him down to half before dying then its an easy kite from there. Bring them both by the bridge and you will have an appreciative audience. &quot;Wow, look at the bard get that griff to fight for him&quot;</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Tomias Wintersong</b> (<i>5/1/01</i>) Although, very easy... Charm kiting Froon and Choon isn't all that profitable for EXP or Loot. They have like a 20 minute spawn time, so that's a lot of waiting around. I like to hit them as I am running through the zone to Qeynos and then again on the way back.</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"> (<i>3/2/01</i>) Charm kiting Froon and Choon</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#9999cc"><td colspan="2" nowrap><b>Eastern Wastes</b>&nbsp;<font size="1">Type=World Zone</font>|<font size="1">Tag=ewastes</font></td><td align="right" valign="top">|</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Lulak</b> (<i>12/14/03</i>) I came here at level 30. I was on my way to Iceclad when I noticed some blue. And I also noticed a blue Rygorr scout. I then realized this place was a good source of money. First time I got in there I foudn a HQ Kodiac Pelt which sold for 350pp. I also found about 3 orc fang earrings, a frozen mantel, and other things that are worth some PP. PLus the exp is great. I normally switch back and fourth from fear kitting and charming (because i get bored if i do just one thing) But I also made great exp, im lvl 31 now and still killing, very close to level 32<br><br>-Lanolwen 31st Bard</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Profundo Basso</b> (<i>8/22/02</i>) At level 33 or 34.  Once the Frost Giants in Iceclad turn blue, head to Eastern Wastes.  <br>Remember to change your bind point from the dock at IC to Thurg.  Once you are across the bridge, take a right (north).  Go past the orc camp and leave them alone.  There's a mystic that will be a major pain if you try and kite the whole camp.  He'll SoW the biggest centurion orc, who will chase you down and eat your lunch.  Skip them and continue until you see the herd of Wooly Rhinos.  They should con yellow or red to you, perfect for charm kiting.  There are Ulthorks too, but you could be generous and leave those to the lv 40 druids that are always working on them.  <br><br>Rhinos are slow and there are a bunch of them, perfect for charm kiting.  Pick a yellow one and sic him on a red.  When your pet is down to 15% health, chant him to death.  Find another yellow rhino and repeat.  Think of the red con rhino as the anvil that you are bashing the yellows against.  When the red is down to 10%, chant him.  Don't try this without a good charm hotkey setup.  You will get your ass handed to you if you can't keep Selo's up and your pet targetted.<br><br>The loot is ... basically ... nothing.  But I went from 33 to 35 in 5 hours.  <br><br>Since you're there, kill those pesky Ulthorks too.  Walrus tusks and Ulthork hide armor.  Velium weapons.  Try for the yellow cons, won't resist much, but good exp.  Swarm kiting these is SO much easier than cougars.  They run like molasses in January.  Zone to dump aggro if you confuse your pets and target the wrong mob.  IC zone line is closer and has better visibility.<br><br>What I didn't do was kill Coldains.  Everyone else in my guild has Giant faction except me.  They sell Coldain heads for lots o' plat.  If I understood the faction implications better, I'd have advice on that subject.</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Kludark</b> (<i>10/3/01</i>) Yes,  I was grouped with a 43 druid at Ry'Gorr fort and got mint exp at 30 by playing mana during downtime and helping mezz so she could medd.  They also drop about 4pp each and common Velium weapons.  Oh yea, and Ry'Gorr armor as well which is nice.<br><br>-Kludark</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Ruldar</b> (<i>3/2/01</i>) On a side note, with the recent changes in the way exp is divided in a group (i.e. by level instead of by exp needed to level), if you want to level fast try to get into higher level groups fighting stuff thats red to you. I went through 30 in no time fighting with some of my higher level friends in the Queen room in CC and the Ry'Gorrs in EW. Got some good loot there too.</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Gilgurth</b> (<i>3/2/01</i>) Keep on charm kiting.

The catch was to be in a group that had at least one person who knew what they were doing, and 5 others who knew to listen to him. If you have that, exp runs quickly. If you don't have that, exp runs AWAY quickly. Some notes:<br>(1) Clear your way down the hall, and after you've established yourselves in the ghost room, keep the hall cleared.<br>(2) Always keep your backs against a wall (ie, not to the pit) when fighting a tentacle or dark terror.<br>(3) Go all-out nuke on the hags. Clerics stunning is nice... bards should prolly either repeatedly strike or twist anti-magic songs (or charming them is fun, too).<br>(4) Snare/Chain EVERYTHING.<br>(5) Never fall into the pit. If you need to catch a runner, go out the hall exit, not the pit walkway exit. If you've snared/chained it and it's on the walkway, nuke/dot it dead... running onto the platform risks accidentally falling into the pit.<br>(6) Druids in wolf form are not KOS'd... let them take a look to see what's around.<br>(7) There is a single mob spawn point in the little passage that goes from the main room to the ghost room. Root, stun, nuke quickly. Do not let him run, or you're going to have to deal with whatever is in the ghost room, also. Then, med up at the spawn point, and get ready for the ghost room assault. Go in with Clouding up, so everyone can get in position. (Charm or mez the TT/DT while the party drops the Ghost/hag. Then, mez the TT for a few minutes while your party rests up to break the room spawn.<br>(9) I've heard people say you have to clear the pit to (a) make the ghost spawn or (b) prevent the pit from coming up when something runs up the platform. This is false. Pulling the pit is only done for exp. If you use the passageway to chase runners instead of the platform, you don't even need to worry about the pit. (PS -- be careful when charming something against TT's... one almost threw my hag pet into the pit, and I'm not sure what that would have done).<br>(10) It's hard to get a good angle to Lament/Harmony the pit from the platforms above, but it can be done.<br>(11) Again, keep that hall clear between ghost spawns. You don't want to be running through mobs if you have a runner (and the ghost moves pretty well even when snared when he runs). Besides, it's all about exp... why miss any?</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#9999cc"><td colspan="2" nowrap><b>Firiona Vie</b>&nbsp;<font size="1">Type=Town</font>|<font size="1">Tag=firiona</font></td><td align="right" valign="top">|</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Barnard</b> (<i>11/1/01</i>) well lots of people who have heard of the outpost here think the out post is the only thing here, that and the spiders on the way to loio.  well thats not the case.  there is a nice little temple to the east that is referred to as the dog temple.  great xp if you know what you are doing.  bard right?  well tell your group to bring the drovlargs to the side of the entrance of the temple.  once they are on the side, fear song fear song fear song, they run straight into the wall.  i had a group of 4 here, all were 30 to 32 and i, the bard of the group, sat there w/ my brass instrument fearing everything into the wall watching brass go up.  we were able to take on about 5 dogs at a time and i gained my lvl in less then 4 hours, and it was hell lvl 30 too.  try it, it works ;)</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#9999cc"><td colspan="2" nowrap><b>Frontier Mountains</b>&nbsp;<font size="1">Type=Town</font>|<font size="1">Tag=frontier</font></td><td align="right" valign="top">|</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Tulamien</b> (<i>1/7/02</i>) Get a druid.

Even with a charisma of 105 they rarely resist. Even easier to do if you get a druid to sow you. Trouble is its fairly well camped but if you get on at a quiet time the place is yours....</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"> (<i>8/4/01</i>) People who suggest going to Ill Omen Instead of FM are whacked. Although you will probably have to spend some actual real money (dollars not pp) and get a control pad. This aliviates stress from to much kiting and you don't have to run backwards anymore :). Just switch to a wide angle view and kite giants on relativly flat grounds (I prefer the north wall of the Giant fort). Experience is good, loot is good and soloing is easy. If you want be greedy and pull everything in the fort (long as your ping sustains it). I pulled 7 giants at 29, (including craig) and after 30minutes of charm kiting 1.5 yellow plus a heck of a lot richer.

Get a melee class (a monk for example) and some sort of healer (druid?) and go to work!  I found exp was best when I got an equal lvl melee class and MUCH lower lvl healer.  Between your healing song and mana songs, the healer stays good on mana, and the melee type takes most of the abuse during battle.  Fast exp!  If you do want a group of 6, focus on the craigs and braes.  Make sure you have a good puller though, its tough work to charm 2 or 3 consequtive braes while the rest of your group is getting battered.<br><br>Loot is GREAT!  You can make a huge amount of plat if you stay here a few hours.  I only saw one forest loop in many lvls of action here, but the 10 or 15 Giant Foreman's Tunics I sold for 64plat each to vendors makes up for it!<br><br>Another great activity for you in FM is corpse location.

If you're lucky and you're the only one hunting them at the time, you can grab 10-12 at once and AoE kite them by twisting Selos, Chords and Dennon's by the igloos. Not much loot but very occasional cougar claw earring or bloodstained fang, but the xp is great!

Found two very sweet ways to kite here.  1st is AE kiting.  Basically you get a SOW (you can do it with selo's but if you mess it up you get your A** kicked everytime)  Your going to be casting Dennons discord and Cords of dissonance and probably twist in heal now and again.  The idea is to go to the far side of TOFS (you'll find a nice area between the second and third islands near TOFS by the waterline) to kite.  Run up the hill and pull 3 cougars... you can pull more but 3 is the magic number since only 3 can attack you at once (keeps others from wondering off when they get too close)  Next you want to pick a camera view that allows you to see the entire hillside.  Next run in large circles keeping the cougars behind you or near you but not hitting you.  Now twist AE damage songs.  Cougars are very nice for this because they are quick and are easily hit by the AE spells)  You will find very quickly that you'll be able to take 3 yellow/low reds in about 20 minutes of kiting.  Please note you MUST Practice this on some blues somewhere else first... even greens or you will get slaughtered.  The other thing is you need a good link... lag will kill you and linkdeath will kill you.  It's risky but with a little practice you'll do well.  The key to this is practice ;)  Ok secondly Once you get your two cougar claw earrings (if you want) you can move on over to the bridge.  Charm kiting is an excellent means of exp.  Go find a yellow or lower frost giant set up a hotkey /pet attack a dire wolf (make sure you set the mob name exactly as it appears when you target it).  Next charm a giant point it at a dire wolf and get selo's up quick.  Stay back and watch the fun.  When either the giant or wolf start to walk away (after the charm breaks) run in big ol circles round them both and bellow the weak one to death (use amp here as well jacks your bellow dammage up about 20 levels ;) )  Full exp and ready to pull the next.  I've got it down now to the point where I can pull 5-6 giants 5-6 dire wolves and slaughter the mass of em.  Not bad for level 32 and good exp.  Just another way to apply the methods others teach.  Remember Bards, played right, are unstoppable.  Get used to handling and running around 30 things and nothing will shake you again after that :)  Best of luck to you all.<br><br>                                                       Overture InDMinor<br>                                                       Bard of the 34th song<br>                                                       Terris-Thule</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"> (<i>2/2/02</i>) Charm kitting cougars near the igloos at lvl 33. 1 yellow, 20 minutes.

I explored around a little, and found my own private paradise.<br><br>2nd island, NE corner (near TOFS) there is a long empty space, with only rare wonderers.  The plan is this..and do this only if you are good at Charm kiting:<br><br>Locate the safe spot, right near the sea cliff, and then range out and look for prey.  I usually run around a bit ,and gather as many Cougars as possible..usually around 10.  Run back to the safe area, and pick any cougar out of the crowd.  Charm, hit F8, /pet attack, /pet target (so you don't lose your pet in the crowd) and watch the grp of cougars melt your pet.  You will be running from the ones that didn't agro your pet, but stay close to your pet, otherwise you wont get an accurate health count. Have Invis song up, and if it looks like you are going to lose your pet, invis, break charm, then bellow, or chant your former pet to death, then repeat.<br><br>Why swarm kite when you can just pull singles?  Swarming is much, MUCH faster.  Normal kiting takes about 4 charms before I have to finish them off.  Swarming takes 1-1.5 charms (1.5 = breaking charm with Invis) to nearly finish your pet.<br><br>I rarely got hit, and when I did I just twisted HYMN in a bit.

Not hard but just slow. My best advice for Bards in LOIO is not to group unless you suck at kiting/fear kiting/chram kiting. With the following strategy i leveled from 30-31 in about 4 hours. <br><br> First off, set up your song hotkeys with 1) Selos, 2) Hymn, 3) Jons Whistling Warsong, 4) Bellow, 5) Solons Song of the Sirens, 6) Selos Consonant Chain, 7) Fufil's, 8) Invis or Fear, 9) /pet attack, 10) /pet target. <br><br>Then, make sure you have your drum in hand and head towards the mill. From the mill, go to the Skeleton Ruins where the higher end MoBs are. The, facing the ruins, take a left and run up the hill till you go down into another ravine/valley. Then, take a right through the mountains onto a long stretch of flat land. Keep running straight until you see a big weird looking ruin. Inside of it lay 5 or 6 Goblins. The flat area to the left side of the ruins will be your kiting grounds.<br><br>Make sure you have about 5-8 minutes to spare to kite them. If the phone rings, do not answer it. If there is a knock on the door dont even blink. This process needs your full attention because even a small mistake and you will get hit by about 6 HIGHLY pissed off goblins.<br><br>That said, start off with drum in hand and selos for a tick, then charm the highest con goblin(warlord). Then press F8 and then press 9 on your numpad for you pet to attack that gob. The entir pack should beat the living bjesus out of the warlord until charm wears off. After you press F8, press 10 to target your pet. Then, when they rush you, either start twisting Selos, Fufil's and Bellow on him till he dies or charm him for another round. With the higher cons, you can usually have them stand up for 2 rounds, then finish it with a kite. Then, target another gobby of the pack and do the same with it. Keep doing this until you have 1 MoB left. Melee the snot out of that by either twisting Hymn,Warsong,Chains or Fear,Chains,Warsong. <br><br>After this, you should have about 5 or 6 bodies to loot, and about 1-2 blues of exp. Then, heal up if you were hit by the pack or last gobby and start doing regular charm kiting on the passing MoBs or swarm kite them/swarm charm kite them again. All in all, if you have a good hour or so, you can usually keep the pack going for about 20 mins because there is no real competition over there and MANY MoBs wander there. The spawn time on the Gobs is about 10-15 mins, so they are a steady, safe source of exp if you need to take breaks in between kills.<br><br>This strategy is very effective for many other places most notably OT, DL, IC, EW, and CC.

Well, that's a blessing in disguise for us.  I went here at 32 to get the two new quest items (Gilded Silver Skull earring and Emerald Cloak of the Faydark).  No XP for the Earring MoBs (frightlings at the pixie tower, approximately p1200, p2700) but killer XP for the Cloak.  <br>     The fairy village has been corrupted.  This is the mushroom village at approximately p1100, p3600, the place has Gearheart at the center of the village.  There is a hill with a tree to the East of the village, just orient your self so you are looking at Gearheart's face and you can see all 5 guard spawn points.  DON'T get too close to the village, unless you like eating harm touches for 161-181 from annoying green MoBs, the Undead Sprite Horrors.  Basically all you want to attack are the Undead Sprite Guards and Bloodboil.  At 32-35th levels the guards and BB were blue to me and until 35th level every 2-3 guards gave me a blue bub of XP.  You can use lull to split the 4 outer guards, they ring the village one at each compass point (N, E, W, and S).  The center guard, to the right of Gearheart if you are facing him, is the placeholder for Bloodboil.  The guards seem to be on an approximate 17 minute timer.  So if you split the spawn well, you have about 3 minutes between each pop once it is broken,<br>          OK, the Item you need for the Cloak is Bloodboil's broken wing.  Bloodboil is a high 20's-low30's SK.  Has a harm touch for 271 then likes to try to fear and clinging dark you.  Notice I said tries, in 16 kills he only feared me once.  He also tends to run if you chant kite him below 33% HPs, but he doesn't run if you melee.<br>    Melee?  Yep. :)  Here's the bonus for this area.  All the guards are basic warrior types, but you can solo melee them at 32.  I could usually handle 2, by using instill doubt to &quot;ping pong&quot; them, i.e. melee one and keep hitting ID until it ran, then switch to the second and melee and ID it until it ran, by then the first was back, rinse, lather and repeat.  In the 3 days I was there, my defense went from 130ish to 157, my offense maxed, I was able to keep dual wield and slash maxed, work up  piercing from 70ish to 150, and bash from 20ish to 57 (still have to work on bash).<br>    There are only a few dangers in the area.  Thistlefoot spawns near the village and he's mean, just ignore him and he should ignore you.  There are occasional wandering horrors and even though they are green, the WILL agro and attack which means a harm touch for 150-180.  In over 20 hours there, I never saw a brownie scout.  However, there is a new mob, Equestrielle the Corrupted.  She's a mean SK, 401 harm touch hits fast for 60-80 damage, life taps for 25 and all the other nasty SK stuff.  Equestrielle CAN keep up with Selo's, so make sure to equip a drum to outrun her.  The Mistmoore zone line is almost due south from the mushroom village so you can flee there to clear aggro (yeah, I know it seems weird to run TO Mistmoore for safety).<br>     The goodies: most guards carry from 5 gold to 3 plat.  About 50% have fine steel weapons and about 25% have medium range gems and jewelry (pearls, topaz, mithril earrings, jade earrings), plus some have lesser gems and words/runes.  In about 5 hours I could get half way through a level and collect enough coin and loot to get about 100pp.<br>     The songs I used: Kelin's Lugubrious Lament (level 8), Hymn of Restoration (level 6), Selo's Accelerando (level 5), Melanie's Mellifluous Motion (level 21), Selo's Consonant Chain (level 23), Fufil's Curtailing Chant (level 30), Jonathan's Whistling Warsong (level 7), and Alenia's Disenchanting Melody (level 22).  I used hymn, chain and warsong for melee; accelerando and Fufil's for kiting; and Melanie's and Alenia's for emergencies (some of the wanderer's along the route to the mushroom village like to DoT and root/ensnare).<br></span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#9999cc"><td colspan="2" nowrap><b>Lord Nagafen's Lair</b>&nbsp;<font size="1">Type=Dungeon</font>|<font size="1">Tag=soldunb</font></td><td align="right" valign="top">|</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Phrank Sinnatra</b> (<i>6/28/02</i>) Go to Bugs & Bats and take a right down past the lava to a hallway right before the lava beetle spawn and the path to the efreeti lair.

But, some people don't know about the hill-spawn if you can't get a spire. I haven't been kiting here because I've found it easier, actually, to just melee solo the gnolls.

Neither is the case. In this zone, there are the gnoll spires, an dthe aviak town. Aviaks usually aren't camped too bad and you can usually find something your level to fight near there. The spires may be camped, but running gnolls are considered fair game for everyone, and there are usually 1-4 runners if you can get them quick enough. The best way to gain XP in this zone is by using charm kite on either Tesch Mas Gnolls, or aviaks. With good charm hotkeys, this can be EXTREMELY easy... and lucrative. Not only is the experince amazing up to at least 33 (thats what level Im at and Im still getting excellent XP), but the loot is VERY good (I usually come back from trips with about 150+pp in money/items). If you can't find anything to charm kite, just go Selos/Fufil's/Bellows/Denons (any combo that has selos in it will work well enough) until the creatures start to run (because both aviaks AND the gnolls run). Don't forget about fear kiting either (another good strategy if there isn't anything to charm)!From the North karana zone, the spires can be located directly due north of the stone bridge. Past the spires, you will find the aviak village (where theres a vendor who will sell to you if you sneak behind him). From the Lake Rathe zone, the aviak village is South/Southwest, and from the aviak village, the spires are north. Another bonus about hunting here, is that the arena zone, highkeep/highpass, and Split Paw (which is REALLY close) are located near the zone so as to make CRs and zoning away from monsters easier. Also, this zone can be gotten to by basically aynone. Just look at maps and whatnot for way to get there.

After shouting for a camp check several times and even asking specifically if the hill was camped, I found a nice spot just north of the Gnoll Hill and settled in.  There are two gnolls that spawn on a little flat spot there.  One will sit there until pulled, the other runs immediately after spawning.  They are both on about a 5 or 6 minute timer, so if you break it right, it is good steady experience until level 35.  It would only take about a minute or two to chain/fear kite these guys (at level 33) leaving plenty of time to rest and heal up for the next one.  If the north spire group was weak, you would occasionally get the pair that spawns there for you to charm kite.  If one of the spire groups was very strong, they would sometimes try to grab my spawn thinking it was an escapee from another spire.  I found that some groups didnt even know there was a spawn spot there.  Most groups would leave me alone if I explained that the hill was camped.  (If not, there was always charm pulling.)

I didn't kite in the traditional sense, but was just as effective. I'd pull two aviaks form a roost with a charm, and start an all instrument weave of Denon's, Chords, and Heal. Keeping the charmed one as my target means that as I'm DoT'ing his friend, I'm ready to Charm him in a drumbeat when he breaks. As soon as his buddy dies, I finish off his friend with the double damage/heal twist. Quite effective.<br><br>I wouldn't recommend this on Avocets tho -- Snare/Fear them.</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"> (<i>3/2/01</i>) Centaurs</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#9999cc"><td colspan="2" nowrap><b>Stonebrunt Mountains </b>&nbsp;<font size="1">Type=World Zone</font>|<font size="1">Tag=bruntmtns</font></td><td align="right" valign="top">|</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Alerka-TZ</b> (<i>12/17/03</i>) Great zone to charm kite in. I play on PvP and its usually empty so no wasting time while exping. In the snowy, moutain part of the zone (in the north?) there are highland kobold camps. You can kill those until it gets boring. You can also roam around the rocky slopes at the base of the mountain and charm mobs there. The best are the mature and elder pandas which will pretty much tear through anything in the zone. Some of the highland gorillas can hit pretty hard too. I dont even waste time twiasting selos...I charm a mob, sick it on another and keep the enemy mob in target while watching my pets health in the pet window. I dont sing anything, just keep charm on rotation (it will keep singing on your pet even with the other mob targeted). Keep your distance and when charm breaks run with normal speed on...charm will usually restick before they catch you and if its resisted regular run speed is still usually good enough to keep these slow mobs behind you. If your pet is low on health and looks like the enemy mob is going to win, stop casting charm and charm the enemy mob when the 1st charm breaks. Make sure to hit any mob at least once to get exp without big penalty.</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Chalaht</b> (<i>8/21/02</i>) Finally someone else gets it. :) Stonebrunt is awesome.<br><br>Actually, in addition to the great experience, the coin loot here is quite good for this level range. The highland kobold camps in the northern part of the zone (the one I prefer is near +3800, -1000) will fill your coffers very nicely with coin, etched iron and bamboo weapons, and fine steel weapons to sell at the kejek village. And with our above-average charisma, we bards will get top plat from the vendors there. Hunting the highland kobolds is viable until around level 35, when most will be light blue (and some green). In fact, my higher level characters sometime come back here just to suck up their loot, since no one else on my server ever bothers to come here. Their loss.<br><br>The pandas and granitebacks are the ideal animals to hunt in the zone, whether you fear-kite, charm-kite, or chant-kite. They occasionally drop gems, rarely expensive ones like star rubies and fire emeralds. Solo or grouped, this zone is great. In addition to the dead-end tunnel on the east wall, you can safely set up camp at the highland kobold camp I referred to above, slightly behind it up on the hill or behind the tree. This is off the path of wandering animals, so adds shouldn't be a problem unless someone else aggroed them before you.</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Marlic</b> (<i>9/5/01</i>) This zone fills in the spot for 28-35 bards that have outgrown LOIO, great exp here, no coin loot though.

If you are just starting your kiting career then this place is ideal to practice in while earning xp. Nice long straight to kite the mob without fear of any aggro. Get your drums up and pull whatever you fancy (obviously apart from the dreaded Goons!) Have your Fufil's Curtailing Chant,  Brusco's Boastful Bellow and your Selo's Consonant Chain up. Sing your chains to slow the mob and then back off while twisting in Bellow's and Fufil's. Every so often, twist in Amplification to do extra damage. I find it better to use the third person view rather than the standard 1st person view. If the chain breaks, be prepared to take a few hits but don't panic and twist in your chains again until it sticks. Kite the mob down the 'alley' towards the Frontier Mountain zonline (be careful not to zone out!) and turn around and back along towards 'the ledge' This was the way I learned to kite and after a while I used the 'alley' to start kiting in circles. Just be careful of the Goons but you shouldn't have too many problems if you have your Selo's Accelerando up and ready.<br>Hope this helps :)</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>DemvaDisabunch</b> (<i>6/22/02</i>) Have to agree with everyone else Charmkiting here is good.<br>  A real Good way to do it is get your mask of deception go DE.<br> Turn selos on grab a stonegrazer , or knight , let them kill about 3blue mobs while you get xp.

I can charm kite safely near the Skyfire zone, as i'm agnostic the Goons leave me alone unless i'm grouped :). Best XP is in a group, this is where us bards can really shine for 2 reasons: -<br><br>1. Our versatility means we can nearly always fit into a group.<br>2. We are the masters of reducing downtime, and in a good group this can mean almost constant pulls.<br><br>I would be interested if anyone knows of a similar place in Velious, as i'm always looking to move on, it's the bards wanderlust I guess.

They are just really hard to finish off after they win.</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Devamaru</b> (<i>3/15/01</i>) Let me echo Kocho, here. The Overthere is just plain good charm kiting. You have five different types of creatures to choose from: Rhinos, Cockatrices, Succlants, Sarnaks, and Sabretooths. All but the highest level of these will be charm-able to you at 30. For a while, I stayed away from charming Stonegazer Cockatrices and Sarnak Knights for fear they would be too high level for my song. But after some experimentation, I found that most of the time they were quite susceptible to my charms. :) Admittedly, a lot of resists, but if you get your CHA up there (mine is at 156 with all my CHA gear on) it works well.<br><br>The greatest thing about the Overthere for charm kiting is the variety of mobs.  You want to charm a mob of a different type than the one you want to kill, so they'll automatically remember who to attack when you re-charm them. With 5 different varieties, it's possible to charm-kite non-stop for 4, 6, 8, or more mobs. Just as your target dies, look around. There's probably another suitable target nearby. I remember once I started a charm-kite just as dusk was falling in the game. When I finally killed my last creature, the sun was coming up. Half a yellow bubble of XP in Hell Level 30. <br><br>Words of caution: Some Sarnak Knights move at SOW speed, and will outrun you without your drum. Pick on the Knights that move at a normal pace. Also, you can usually outrun rhinos without your drum, provided you aren't weighted down. When you get within 8-10 stone of your max weight, avoid the rhinos or just swap out your flute for your drum.<br><br>Excellent XP and decent loot. Cockatrices especially are good for a few plat each. Highly recommended.</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Lenadas</b> (<i>3/2/01</i>) I moved to OT at 35, but I regret not going sooner.

All you need to do is get a healer and head in.  Then just pull away from the first floor, anything you want.  Bring your victims back to the entrance and start up the good ole fear song.  The mobs will run up against the entrance, then they have no place to run.  So just stand there and whack 'em till dead.  I could pretty much do this by myself at 31, but a healer is good for the initial beating you take as you're pullng.  I was usually getting 2-6 mobs at a time, all blue to me.  Hear on the songs that I had up, 1. Hymn, 2. Screech, 3. Jonthan's, 4. DDD, 5. Chant of Battle, 6. Selo's (incase you have to zone out), 7.
