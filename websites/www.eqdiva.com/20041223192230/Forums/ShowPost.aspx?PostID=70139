				<td colspan="2"><span>Hi guys. I got a bit temperd 1 day about people degrading everyone that plays everquest so i wrote a statement for all the people who quitted everquest and decided to blam it( i get insulted easy :P)
<br />
i wrote the following:
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Ok this is really annoying. I have read every single word on this page and every single person sounds like they don't have any prioritys(sorry for spelling) I play everquest every moment when I am not doing somthing, and I'm not ashamed to say i am addicted. But It's very rude with you people saying &quot;the people in everquest are just d*mn rude and only go for the best items&quot;. This is totally wrong. Seriously if that was the case, Everyone in everquest would quit. Still today, i meet lots of fun, respectable, reliable,adventurous,role-played based people. So DON'T blame your communication problems and life problems on a game that people enjoy. You have quit and you're no longer a horrible person? YOU ARE! you're insulting everyone that plays everquest just because of your misfortune of controlling yourself. Seriously GROW UP. 2 more things, 1. Kids are playing everquest insted of commiting sexual acts,drugs other stuff that a OVER-excited teen would think of doing 2. This can be done by any hobby. Let's use HUNTING as a example. You could take up hunting and risk getting killed or more importantly KILLING innocent animals. SEE!? there is a con to every thing in life. Making a big page about your online addictions is just childish and unwitty.
<br />

<br />
Thank you for reading and i hope you get it in your head.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Well, Daniel, I applaud your efforts to defend everyones &quot;geek-hood&quot; that plays EQ.  However, I have to somewhat agree with the &quot;quitees.&quot;  Everquest, from what I have learned from personal experience, is more of a way of life than a game.  I have been playing on and off for Four years, after one of my close friends MADE me start it up(he beat me in SC, which was a first).  Anyway, after these four years I don't really enjoy everquest, I NEED everquest.  When I think if things I wanna do on everquest I dont say &quot;I wanna get 63!! That would be great!&quot; I say, &quot;I need to get 64&quot;.  The keyword being NEED.  It 's more like a chore than anything else.  
<br />

<br />
When I start playing everquest again after a long break I start to become enthralled with it again.  I usually start off saying &quot;Okay I'll only play an hour a night.&quot; Within a week or two its up to two and three hours a night, eventually even 4 and 5.  This is unacceptable for me, I have 1.) A Part time job 2.) 18 Credit Hours of School 3.) A Girlfriend who lives with me(which is the most extruciating, humilating, degrating, and all other negative descriptive words, job that anyone could ever have)  4.) And a dog. The dog is not like a normal dog, he's like a CHILD, thanks to my GF.  Anyway, when I am playing I stop wanting to go out to parties and what not with my friends and of course that causes my GF to suffer because she generally does not go anywhere without me.  
<br />

<br />
When I quit, however, my life is full of good times, in a strictly Non-pixelated way.  I hooked up with my gf when I wasn't playing (blind date at a party, later she asked me to her prom and well, everyone knows about prom nite parties.)  Yes, Daniel, I generally do things like Drink(as in alcohol) and RARELY some non-legal drug.  However, I was a full blown POT head my senior year of high school while I was playing EQ.  EQ has no bearings on drug use, this is from personal experience, I used to watch my friend snort an OC(oxy cotton) and then go play his SK on EQ.  EQ also interferes with my personal health.  During my junior years of high school I was a very talented soccer player, until i sustained a nasty knee injury.  However, I soon recovered and was on the way to being a good player again until I got into EQ.  I became out of shape, out of touch with my skills, and I have asthma which worsens when I am not physically up to par(not weight wise, stamina wise).  
<br />

<br />
So let me put it you frankly:
<br />

<br />
Eq is a great game to play, but everyone needs to have an outlet, some sort of hobby, and a limit.  YOU NEED TO TAKE BREAKS.  I cannot stress that enough.  The h*ll with flagging your character for planar access, I guarantee you when you come back the planes will still be there and if your guild surpassed you, find a new one.  Don't let EQ overrun your entire life, especially if you're still a teenager(which, by reading your first post, I am guessing you are).  If your under 18, go have fun for god sakes.  Save EQ for the late night after a party.  Play it half drunk.  But these are the best years, you need to go out and meet some girls(and guys for you girls), have fun <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-5.gif" border="0" alt="Wink" hspace="2" />, and beat some people up =).

				<td colspan="2"><span>I couldnt agree with you more Resil, everything you said applies to me as well...the only real chance i have for playing eq consistantly is summer break, the rest of the year i have so many other things on and if i want to do well in college studying has to take up a lot of your eq time. I havent been playing for a month or two now, mainly cos my gaming computer died on me but now i look back i think its probably a good thing that this happened. 
<br />

<br />
I was getting slightly hardcore and had just applied to a big guild on my server which would have taken its toll on other parts of my life im sure. I'm positive that i'll start again when i get some free time, and no doubt my usual chain of eq will start again like it has for the last few years...play-&gt;play more-&gt;get pretty addicted-&gt;take a long break-&gt;repeat cycle
<br />

<br />
As for the guy who started the posts question, people who have left eq and look down on the others still playing it all day every day, i think they have no business to do that but i can understand that it makes them feel better about themselves knowing that they have beat the addiction whereas most cant do it. I sometimes feel envious about the people at the very top of the game with like 10khp unbuffed etc.. but then i think sensibly that i have others things in life to look forward to and that by taking regular breaks i can keep my life..

				<td colspan="2"><span>Simply put,
<br />

<br />
RL &gt; EQ.
<br />

<br />
EQ = ANY other hobby (&lt;insert your hobby name here&gt;), no more, no less (with the exception of having good sex  <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-5.gif" border="0" alt="Wink" hspace="2" /> )
<br />

<br />
The problem with EQ (or any other hobby) is that when people&#180;s lifes get fooked up, some of them resort to EQ as a way to forget their screwed up life. In that respect, drinking, doing drugs, or even playing soccer is just as bad. Again, no more, no less. Once you are done with EQ, drinking, drug haze offes, or soccer game gets over with, you are back to your screwed up life you didn&#180;t take care of, which continues to be fooked up cause you chose to hide your head under the sand instead of facing your problems and fixing your life, either by palying EQ, drinking, or any of the before mentioned hobbies.
<br />

<br />
Eventually, those who finally get around to fix their lifes, either by choice or by chance, computer breaking up, they tend to regard the hobby they chose to hide upon as the worst thing ever in their lifes, instead of blaming themselves for not getting out of the self-destructive loop sooner, by themselves or by seeking the help of others.
<br />

<br />
If EQ, or any other hobby is not used as a &quot;hiding&quot; from RL tool, then as far as you enjoy it, go for it. The only but I would add is that, if you are a teenager, and still developping your social skills, EQ or any &quot;solo&quot; hobby, could hinder further developping of social interaction, which can affect you later on in life. Why I said sex is prolly the exception to the rule, not cause I am a pervert, but cause it not only allows for social interaction, but you feel da*n good about yourself, as well as boosting your self-steem.
<br />

<br />
If you have to chose between EQ &lt;insert hobby here&gt;  or RL, because of lack of self control, then RL &gt; all. Work &gt; No money in the bank (money = freedom of choice). Friends &gt; Hobbies.
<br />

<br />
But there is really no reason while you can&#180;t combine the 2 of them. If your social and working-study life is pretty time intensive, then you will have very little time left for EQ play. As long as you keep your priorities straight, everyone should be allowed to have at least 2 hours a week of own-personal time, even if kids, wife, work and all.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I agree with your points Manizhe, everything pretty much coincides with my thoughts.  I don't really know about the whole hiding from your life theory though, perhaps because I have had a relatively good life, the only troubles were once I infilicted upon myself which I later remedied.  Oo ya, and THREE CHEERS FOR SEX. I am also not a pervert, just to clear things up =)
<br />

<br />
Ooo ya..venolas,I agree, I hate that when you come back and everyone is higher than you! Sucks! I've helped out alot of my friends on Tunare and Rallos Zek, I'd quit and come back and they'd be level 65 and I was still 53...stuff like that sucks, but who cares /shrug  Make new friends your level, and ignore those PoTime people, either their good or they value the game more than you.

				<td colspan="2"><span>It is a bad habbit that some just naturally take part in.  Ever heard a previously overweight person lay into the currently overwieght person.  
<br />

<br />
Everyone knows how disfunctional a game eq1 is for life balance, and to point fingers at the ones that have not kicked the crack habbit is not cool.
<br />

<br />
EQ2 is showing to be much less of a need, and much more of a want.  It is easy to unplug from eq2.  Now since the game eq2 is not nearly as addictive, some will say it is not as fun.
<br />

<br />
Well at least you can partake in RL and play eq2 vs. living in eq1 to obtain soon to be very useless virtual items.  EQ1 will be a thing of the past someday, so have something left for when the day comes.  Platinum and flags/gear will not mean much to your buddies when 15 people log in a server instead of the old 50,000.

<br />
(funny eh...look everyone...w/all in zone comes up empty...I have 12k hitpoints dam it...bah, go solo some old world mobs for platinum/farming.)

<br />
Nice posts above, the older crowd seem to be very in touch with the real effects of EQ.

				<td colspan="2"><span>This has turned into an interesting thread.  I'll have to agree that EQ can do a lot to ruin life balance if you let it, but you can also enjoy EQ as part of a fun life.
<br />

<br />
I was fortunate because I'd never been a gamer when I started playing.  I started because everyone at my karate school played and my husband had gotten sick and needed a diversion.  While he was battling to get his Graves Disease under control and couldn't windsurf, go out on the Hobie, or run, he played EQ all the time.  It was better than staring out the window at the ocean and knowing his heart would beat out of his chest if he tried to do the things he truly loved.  I played simply to join him in his new-found hobby.  My karate instructor had a guild and everyone in the guild put martial arts, work, and real life above the game.  
<br />

<br />
If you play with people who share your sense of balance and even who share your RL hobby, it helps keep the game in its proper place.  I eventually joined a raiding guild and we're in the top end of the game (Txevu in GoD, one d*mn puppy from Anguish in Omens), but I chose the guild because raid times are only 3 days a week and don't conflict with my karate schedule.  The guild is filled primarily with other adults who work for a living and have families and other priorities.
<br />

<br />
Learning to moderate your life is an important skill.  Learn it as young as you can and keep practicing.

				<td colspan="2"><span>This is a very interesting thread indeed. 
<br />
   I like what you guys have had to say about this so I want to throw a few pennies in too while there's still water in the well. I'm 23 and I've been playing EQ off and on for over 4 years. I defenitely have to agree that more good things have happened to me when I break from it than when I sit in my room and grind for 6-10 hours a day. I'm not saying this to preach I'm saying it because for me it's a fact of life. Now, I still played EQ up until about a month ago when my roomate started playing WoW, which is what I now play. When we quit EQ I was playing every 4-5 days for maybe an hour or two at a time, whenever I didn't have anything to do really. Since getting WoW my roomate has lost his job, smokes REDICULOUS amounts of ganj, (and come on now I love my spinach too but some things are more important, like putting pants on) hasn't taken the trash out or fed the cats in 2 weeks and hasn't washed a dish in the sink in the same amount of time. 
<br />
    I know what's going on and it's not completely due to video games, I'm not here to blame my dirty dishes on Blizzard.  <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-5.gif" border="0" alt="Wink" hspace="2" />
<br />
    It's the nature of the beast, some people are affected by online games more than others. Since I stopped playing EQ I met an amazing girl, bought a new jeep and took a vacation to Alaska. I didn't get up one day and say &quot;let's see what happens if I don't play EQ&quot; it just happened. I play WoW on weekends mostly, and that's if I have time, but I would probably be sitting at my house playing right now if I hadn't met my girlfriend at a buddy's party by chance. 
<br />
   I agree with the starter of this thread on one thing only, I hate preachy people so I'm not trying to do that, rather I wanted to share my experiences with similar problems. For some people it just takes a jumpstart to get back into life, for others it takes a free fall. 
<br />

<br />
What can I say man people are inherently lacking, not to get into philosophy or psychology but some people just need <i>something</i> and 90% of the time they don't even understand why. I don't think anyone here could tell me they've gone through life feeling complete at all times. Not that anyone needs a video game to feel complete, but it sure takes your mind off it doesn't it?

				<td colspan="2"><span>I started EQ'ing at a time in my life when I was both unhappy in my work and recovering from a physical injury.  I do find that I turn to EQ to take my mind off things, I sometimes jokingly call it &quot;self medicating.&quot;  And, I've noticed, quite a few people I've met in game have physical challenges, so perhaps I'm not the only one.   But I do the same with reading, music, and to some extent TV.

If you have a need for distraction, EQ or other videogames can play that role all too well....

Balance is key but not always easy to reach. Still working on that one myself... I'm &quot;only&quot; playing EQ 4 days a week now... If I spent as much time practicing as playing EQ I'd probably be good enough to play semi-professionally, lol.</span></td>
