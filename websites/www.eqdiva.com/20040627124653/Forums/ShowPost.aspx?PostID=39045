				<td colspan="2"><span>Here are the expansion in no specific order:
<br />

<br />

<br />
<b>EQ Classic</b> I was enthralled from the moment I created my 1st character, a troll shaman. The ambience of the swamp creatures, the crackling of the campfires, the troll guards scanning around. It was amazing
<br />

<br />
<b>Ruins of Kunark</b> Once again, enthralled. The zones were created with passion and forethought. The addition of new material without selling out was a tremendous achievement.
<br />

<br />
<b>Scars of Velious</b> Great new mobs, a neat faction system to play with. Great new quest armors and spell drops. The promise of a mapping system that never came through was disgusting as far as customer service, however.
<br />

<br />
<b>Shadows of Luclin</b> I didn't buy this one until about a year after it was out. The zones are beautiful but repetative and boring. The addition of the nexus spires was the first taste EQers got of a movement away from a role playing game closer to a Nintendo game. This is when Sony began to destroy an already established physical system  in favor of one that catered to players who wanted a video game, not a mmorpg.
<br />

<br />
<b>Legends of Ykesha</b> I can't say one positive thing about this expansion. It was so horrid that they needed to bundle it with perks such as expanded bank slots, armor dyes and a mapping system (all things that were promised in earlier expansions) just to get people to buy it without reporting Sony for fraud. The zones are nice looking (albeit buggy as heck) but it seems liek they ran out of steam when it came to mob placement. Its almost as if some programmer at Sony just randomly clicked, dumping mobs in places that lack any sense of real world mechanics. They were too lazy to even code a hometown for the Frogloks. The troll/froglok war was just an afterthought. When have you seen an expansion released where the programmers had to spend a day playing NPCs in innathule swamp just to explain why the Trolls were being shoved into 2 or 3 tunnels in the butthole of neriak?
<br />

<br />
<b>Lost Dungeons of Norrath</b> I can sum this expansion up in one sentence. &quot;We are unable to program game content fast enough to house our player base, so we have devised this Nintendo-game scenario where random dungeons will be created.&quot; It took my about 1 month of LDoN before I went insane and hid in my basement. After looking for a group for about 3 hours players get to spend the next hour racing through what amounts to a maze. I feel like Im in a Flintstones cartoon in LDoN, where the same exact scenery keeps flashing by no matter how long I run. They promised us we would be able to interact with everything. The only thing you can interact with is a barrel, a coffin and a chest....all of which blow up like a jihadist, all for a reward of some crappy potion a lvl 34 shaman could make for 5pp. 
<br />

<br />
<b>Planes of Power</b> Cool idea but somewhat less appealing execution. The zones are great looking but the content is somewhat missing. Surely Sony can make zones that challenging without just creating mobs that have 50k hitpoints, quad for 500 and aoe stun every 6 seconds. Look at the old zone of Kedge... was challenging as h*ll, but all the mobs were average. Kedge was an example of a zone built to be challenging by creativity, not numbers. The PoK books were a blessing and a curse. Sure its great to zip around norrath like a commuter on a Greyhound bus. Just realize you ain't in Norrath anymore baby. You are in the nintendo version of Norrath.
<br />

<br />
<b>Gates of Discord</b> Never bought it and will never buy another expansion.
<br />

<br />

<br />
<b>Closing remarks</b> Some other things that suck about EQ now. Ever notice there is no penalty for playing an evil race anymore? Every town in every expansion nowadays welcomes all races as if they are blind (another episode of role-playing shot to h*ll). All the items and equipment in Everquest keep geting bigger and more powerful. You can purchase an item with no level requirements in the bazaar now for 50pp thats better than a whole suit of EQ classic class-specific armor. Oh well, I'm still playing, just like to bitch is all.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Mostly agree, except for LDoN and PoP. LDoN gave the people what the people wanted, and the majority of players love LDoN. PoP was my favourite expansion hands down. Comparing the boss mobs to Kedge is kind of whacked though since Kedge was a single-group exp zone while what you talk about were raid targets.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I think that to some degree, the game needed to evolve some.  I understand the wonder and so forth when you first started the game, I had it too.  But by the time you had played the game for a couple of years, much of that had worn off.  The honeymoon can't last forever.
<br />

<br />
I was GLAD to see the PoK portals etc.  A more flexible UI, ingame mapping...  Lots of things that made the game &quot;easier&quot; for newbies, also made the game less of a pain for experienced players.  Why SHOULD it take a half an hour for me to get where I want to go?  Yeah, there is more &quot;realism&quot; that way, but what I want is to log on for a couple of hours in an evening, get a group within the first 20 minutes or so, and have some fun before I have to log and go to bed.
<br />

<br />
I LOVE LDoN.  Yes, I get a little burnt out on it at times.  I get burnt out on solo play even faster.  LDoN revived the pick-up group.
<br />

<br />
I loved this game when I started, and I still love it now.  Perhaps the honeymoon is over; the world itself doesn't wow me the way it used to.  But it is the content, the character progression, and the interaction with other players that keeps me hooked.  EQ still has all that AND a bag of chips.</span></td>

The game was cool at first because what you did sort of mattered.  Your gear mattered.  Stats mattered.  Faction mattered.  Quests mattered.  Spells/songs were obtainable.  You actually needed to ID items.  You could reasonably set your sights on max/leveling your toon.
<br />

<br />
Now nothing matters.  You exp grind 50 billion hours like a drone (and still never fill your AA), join a guild and zerg mobs that hit for 3 K to collect the &quot;phat lewtz&quot; that are marked all/all to remove any individuality from the game while they max out your near useless stats.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>You know I am usually one of the first to complian of shoddy craftmanship. This goes into games as well. Also customer service and support is top priority where I am concerend. 
<br />

<br />
I injoy EQ to while away a few hours here and there. It is also a good stress reducer (for me at least. Games always have been along with books and woodworking) I don't need all the expansions. What are there now? 9? However I hope that OoW has all previous expansions in it. Cause what new player would want to buy all of them??? (yes you can cut it down with evolutions) (so it would be Evolutions, LDoN, GoD, And OoM thats still 4) 
<br />

<br />
If Omens is the full game with all previous expansions then yes I will buy it. If not Theres no way I will get it. Due to the fact that half of what each expansions should be patches. (ie maps, bankspace, ect.) An expansion should have ZONES and new playable races and the content to go along with it. (ie expansion specific AA, Disc's. Story lines.) But they don't. I am glad I was deployed for 13 months (in which THREE expansions were released.) Now that I am back I see that I really dont need the current expansions. (I do have everything up to PoP) 
<br />

<br />
I believe that all the expansions up to SoL were decent expansions that offered great game play and new zones. Looking back on SoL some people may disagree. (but when it came out it was good) PoP??? I think its great Major high level content. Maybe not so great the way only the best of the high end guilds can reach the last few zones. and the way they camp them for all the major loot. But this dosn't bother me really. I don't need The best gear there is. Why? Cause if I do my job as a bard I don't need it. Gear with decent Resists is a must of course. But thats easily come by now adays.
<br />

<br />
There is so much content in this game (yes it is a game folks. Shut up Fattguyy Inlilcoatt ) as is, that they HAVE had to buff up some of the expansions with stuff that should have been free with patches. Just so they can release some piece of crap every 6 months. I would be happy with mor velios like expansions or even another PoP wich is what Omens sounds like it is gonna be. (Crosses fingers) I'm not in a raiding guild (and I hope I never am) its not the way I play. But If the continue to expand with rediculus expansions I dont see my self buying them. 
<br />

<br />
Now saying all this let me give a brief run down on my opinions of all the expansions
<br />

<br />
Original..........<b></b> Great idea
<br />
<b>SoV..............</b> Great add on with Great factions to twist it up.
<br />
<b>RoK.............. </b> Don't go here often due to SoV and original being so great
<br />
<b>SoL..............</b> I like it more high end content...Bazaar Rulles now that it is up
<br />
<b>LoY..............</b> Won't buy it. Even tho as a tradeskiller extra bank space would rock. And maps are cool
<br />
<b>LDoN............ </b> Great expansion Low to high end content with out worying about people campping mobs or KS'ers ninja looters. Yea having to get two other to group with you to be able to do it kinda sucks for the socialy-enept.
<br />
<b>GoD...............</b> Still havn't gotten it. Not much to say about it. Won't get it unless Omens has it. 
<br />
<b>OoW.................. </b> Only reason for me to get it is if it has all privious expansions with it. (like Luclin did and evolutions) If it dosn't I will wait till Evolutions two comes out 6 months down the road.
<br />

<br />
Even with all the negatives in the game. I still enjoy it. I have a group of people on TWO servers I like to talk to. Theres enough content in the game thru PoP that I never really need a new expansion. Heck i could kill just gnolls from 1 to 55 if I wanted too. (We have a love hate relationship starting with Fippy Darkpaw)
<br />
 
<br />
Oh well better finish this rant up it IS mothers day better go spen time with the wife.

Either you do the flags or you don't. I see no problem with guilds camping Time, they did earn the right.

Now that Uqua has been fixed, maybe GoD will become a respectable expansion (any bets on the next zone being buggy?).

I remember in 1999 creating a human bard and being unable to play with any of my friends. I couldn't get to their zones without waiting an hour for the wizard bus. Once I got there, I died due to faction. By that time, I'd be damned lucky if I could group with them at all since each character levelled at wildly different rates based on race/class and the amount of time each player is willing to put in.
<br />

<br />
I think that the current game is a little easier than it really needs to be. (Do we really need a zone like Paludal?) I think that the POK books and soulbinders are a little too commonplace. (Two books in Greater Faydark? A Soulbinder in Iceclad?)  However, I'm glad there IS a teleportation system because if I EVER have to run from Freeport to South Karana for the wizard bus again, it'll be too d*mn soon...</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>The simplest reason that the game has been &quot;dumbed down&quot; at the lower levels is the introduction of other MMORPG's to the market.
<br />

<br />
&quot;The Vision&quot; that Verant had for the game was very slow progression, treadmilling, long walks across the world, etc. They could get away with that sort of slow, sometimes frustrating process when they were basically the only man on the block.
<br />

<br />
Once other games and competition started to pop up, the neccessity to bring in and keep new players arose. Now under the control of SoE, these changes are obvious. Newer players are spoiled a bit, yes, but really only at the lowest levels, when the game is basically just a treadmill process anyway.
<br />

<br />
While the old school, one-level-a-week, 5hp-on-an-item-is-uber, 7/21-is-a-hot-1-hander-ratio was great back in the day when the MMORPG market was new and fresh and unfamiliar to us all, I don't really think a lot of people would be happy with it anymore.</span></td>

I have only seen the front end of GoD -- Natimbi, Qinimi, Barindu, Ferubi, and Riwwi.  It is challenging, high XP, decent loot, and basically makes EQ pretty exciting for a group or small raid like the ones I have been on.  I hear there are awful bugs with some of the later zones but I cannot comment on that since I have not experienced them.  I certainly don't regret buying GoD and enjoy it.</span></td>

It's not really. However when the top three guilds are on a rotation and kill all the mobs with all the good stuff well that leaves room for no one else to progress thru the game. 
<br />

<br />
Tho I am not in a elemental raiding guild there have been plenty of times when I or the group i was with wnated to go after a item but couldn't because the item was camped 24/7 by a guild who merly sold the drops. 
<br />

<br />
Might or first one there dosn't always make right. But thats just my opinion. Baahh stay and loot yer leet gear. I'll just go kill fippy over and over.

You don't quite understand how POTime instancing works, do you?
<br />

<br />

<br />
At the rate guilds enter Elementals, gear up in Elementals, kill Fen/Xeg/Coir/Rathe and then 'learn' Time... most servers will never see any conflicts in Time.
<br />
Now that there is 'higher' end content in GoD, Time+ guilds have something to progress through.... thus clearing out room in the Elemental planes for other guilds.
<br />

<br />

<br />
The only players who can rightfully complain about GoD are the ones who had to deal with the c*ckblock in Uqua.
<br />

<br />
I bet you could count the posters who have been to Uqua on one hand.
<br />

<br />
Some of you whining about GoD have never been past Natimbi.
<br />
I've done every raid in Ferubi, solod in Riwwi, killed named in Barindu, swarmed in Qinimi, done all 4 sewer trials, Vxed/Tipt and messed around some in Kod Taz... and I <b>really</b> like the expansion. It's challenging, interesting and fun.... and there's still a lot of GoD content I have yet to see.

				<td colspan="2"><span>my server has five guilds actively farming Time (three that just arrived in the past month), another that is working Coir and Rathe now,  and two time/Discord guilds/alliances that recently called it quits (Afterlife and the &quot;Japanese Coalition&quot;). So we could have had 7 guilds in Time easily and 8 soon. Even with the instancing that requires some scheduling. We have (so far) worked out an amiable rotation. 
<br />

<br />
So it is not as easy as just saying &quot;Time is instanced...&quot;
<br />

<br />
anyway Discord allows for a nice place for us to go on our non-Time nights... though it's a bit awkward fielding close to 72 for Time on Mon and Wed. then smaller groups on Friday for Discord... we're new to it so I'm not sure how that works but I understand Discord has a 54 person raid limit? if so that will be a bit awkward....
<br />

<br />
On topic, 
<br />

<br />
EQ was addictive at first for some of us, but if you started near release, I bet you a donut you remember a ton of folks who never made it past 20 or so before quitting.  It was HARD. too hard to be fun in some ways; those of us who stuck with it have some kinda masochistic issues I think ;p 
<br />

<br />
My husband's best friend is an avid gamer, he started with us at release in March 1999 and quit. He's come back several times and left again; he has less patience for what he calls EQ's &quot;**** you factor&quot; than we do. 
<br />

<br />
Over the years in addition to adding content (MUCH NEEDED CONTENT in all cases), many changes have been made to make the game more friendly. Many, many many of them were adopted out of other games and IMO, in direct reaction to competition. Competition is good! yay free market.
<br />

<br />
Soulbinders = good. Why should melees be screwed if they can't find a friendly caster? Easy transport... I was thinking they went a LITTLE overboard with it but then when we had to ride the boat to Abysmal I changed my mind<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-4.gif" border="0" alt="Tongue out" hspace="2" />Portals= good. LDON? awesome. It's an option for folks like my friend who don't have 6 hours to play, but want to advance their characters anyway, just at a slower pace. No one forces you to go there if you don't like it. 
<br />

<br />
Discord? eh. I'm iffy on Discord. It didn't catch my attention after the first few weeks, but then I'm kind of burned out on EQ right now anyway.  And being that my main (paladin) currently has some issues doing her job (tank) it's a bit discouraging.
<br />

<br />
Story line? POP's is kinda goofy, Discord's is kinda dumb, but heck that has never been EQ's strong point.</span></td>

You know, I thought about this while driving to work today. I understand the indictment that alerka was going for by repeatedly using the Nintendo analogy, but I think he doesn't realize that it's not an indictment after all. Nintendo has a 20-year-history of some of the finest game design in the industry. Some people dismiss Nintendo games as being for kiddies but if you look at any magazine list of the top 100 games of all time usually the plurality are games by Nintendo.
<br />

<br />
The game that Verant originally made was poorly designed. At least, it was not designed for fun - it was designed for obsessive, hard-core players. Yes, the current game is a little bit more like a Nintendo game - in that Nintendo games are accessible, well-designed, and fun. IMO, there's nothing wrong with that.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>I play on TP in an elemental guild trying to get to Time. I say that there are lots of good things and lots of bad things about teh evolution of the game.
<br />
Good:
<br />
1. Lots of new places to hunt if you want to be alone, its not hard to find a zone where Noob_01 isnt KS'ing you and you can play in peace
<br />
2. Quests are easier to complete as now there is so much content, you dont have 100 people permacamping named mobs.
<br />
3. Team work is a must at higher end as strategy now is &gt; than Zerg. Skill is actually needed on end game mobs or you die fast.
<br />
4. Instanced zones and encounters are nice to plan around like LDON, No more zoning into Fear to find out it was cleared out by Euroguild_01 while you were sleeping ( or vise versa for US guild )
<br />

<br />
Bad:
<br />
1. Epic weapons are still a PITA to finish off (mage/warrior) as hardly any guilds still actively raid old world planes. ( I was utterly baffled other day when Me cleric ranger sk roamed Hate with no worries of death. (OMG could not believe after so many wipes in my lower years, we walked through and WTFPWND! even names less bosses )
<br />
2. Epic weapons are now useless compared to high end weapons (exclude bard cleric monk) epic 2.0 way too late in content imho
<br />
3. No challenges in old world. Gore PWnD! by single grp ?  Bard / Mage solo Phinni
<br />
4. Tradeskill armor no longer contends with Ldon and higher end armor ( with the time dump you would think that the stats would be better or superior and nodrop )
<br />
5. EQ has evolved as players and newer zones but the older content has become obsolete. ( other day ran through fear and hate and only items worth looting were epic drops for the done that factor) or to get new toys ( skelly neck )
<br />
King tormax should not be done by two groups. And sleepers should not be done without death with 13 for MotA and 26 for all 4 ancients.
<br />
6. We actually had lots of sleepers loot rot.  With the difficulty in getting that key and then to get enough folks in to raid there, You would think that the zone needs to be revamped to perhaps add some effects on gear.
<br />

<br />
It's a travesty to be able to loot a 54 ac bp in ldon that a lvl 1 can wear. bejewled architech chestplate beats out any old world chest plate.
<br />

<br />
Lots of ballence issues and I think that If they were to ballence the loot tables, You would have to drop some crazy loot from Emp crush.
<br />

<br />
I still enjoy the game. but some of the old quests are all but obsolete. Look at the Dizok ring quest. Killing all those gobbies just to find out that the final portion of the quest is not 
<br />

<br />
I also dont see younger guilds doing much these days. It seems we are in the age of PL'ing where tons of content is skipped.  
<br />

<br />
Getting FFA'd by elemental folks is a common occurance
<br />
the days You never see 20/30 lower level folks forming outside of DL tunnel to engage Gore.  You end up se'ing a one group pally / cleric / mage / wiz / bard killing him off for ebay fodder.
<br />

<br />
It would be awsome to see old world dragons banish on engagement to keep some hard encounters open for lower level folks to still atttempt.</span></td>

<br />
&quot;I think that to some degree, the game needed to evolve some. I understand the wonder and so forth when you first started the game, I had it too. But by the time you had played the game for a couple of years, much of that had worn off. The honeymoon can't last forever.
<br />

<br />
I was GLAD to see the PoK portals etc. A more flexible UI, ingame mapping... Lots of things that made the game &quot;easier&quot; for newbies, also made the game less of a pain for experienced players. Why SHOULD it take a half an hour for me to get where I want to go? Yeah, there is more &quot;realism&quot; that way, but what I want is to log on for a couple of hours in an evening, get a group within the first 20 minutes or so, and have some fun before I have to log and go to bed.
<br />

<br />
I LOVE LDoN. Yes, I get a little burnt out on it at times. I get burnt out on solo play even faster. LDoN revived the pick-up group.
<br />

<br />
I loved this game when I started, and I still love it now. Perhaps the honeymoon is over; the world itself doesn't wow me the way it used to. But it is the content, the character progression, and the interaction with other players that keeps me hooked. EQ still has all that AND a bag of chips.&quot;

My regular XP group has hunted in Ferubi and Barindu many times without being elemental-equipped or having ever gotten Vex Thal gear, let alone time gear and we do it without an enchanter or a cleric.  Yes the mobs hit hard and there are some mean wanderers, but it is challenging and certainly doable.  The XP is great and the rare random drops make it worth the time spent.</span></td>
