<b>Amplification does not affect this. - </b>6/25/02 4:22:04 AM<br>~ <b>Ethanos</b><blockquote>Amplification only puts a percent increase onto songs which utilize the Singing skill.  Since Cantata is a string based song, Amplification will not affect this at all.  However, Amplification WILL affect Chorus of Clarity.  Even at lvl 30, using lvl 20 breeze song with Amplification yields nice results, using Amplification with lvl 32 clarity song is highly in demand vs a regular Clarity (but only in groups.  *grin*)</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b> - </b>2/7/02 10:15:25 AM<br>~ <b>Acrylamide</b><blockquote>Not got this song yet, but I presume stacking Amplification, Chorus Clarity and Cantata should yield some pretty impressive results as far as mana regen is concerned... anyone tried this particular stack?<br><br>Acrylamide Acrylia</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>Get lvl 55... - </b>12/20/01 7:58:19 PM<br>~ <b>Benalan Windsong</b><blockquote>Get lvl 55 and then poof! problem solved. Song is totally useless after 55 =) Good for lower lvls I guess...twisting 4 songs tho....I 'd rather twist 3, save energy, and have 3 constant songs up rather then try to be a hero.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>It doesn't last 3 ticks - </b>11/23/01 12:43:16 PM<br>~ <b>Dida</b><blockquote>This song may have an icon, but it only provides mana when it is auto recast or recasted, giving out the same amount of mana as the lvl 32 song. The trick to produce extra mana is to twist 2 songs with a cast time of 3 seconds, vs the auto recast of a tick of 6 seconds. I am a 4 song twister, and i find using this method i am able to produce 50% more mana than 1 song alone. Unfortunately with all this twisting, arthitis is setting in.<br><br><br>Dida the daughter of Shokoaida</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Finally I can get a break! - </b>11/13/01 1:43:21 PM<br>~ <b>Pulbas Prophett</b><blockquote>While the song doesn't give the highest regen rates stand alone, it does give me a break from twisting. To me this is a blessing as a guild leader, I am usually in several chats. So I can finally talk and twist badly needed songs at the same time! <br>Not to mention you become rather popular with peeps which is handy for getting into groups with a list!<br><br>Woot!<br><br>Pulbas Prophett<br>Pawns of Prophecy<br>Brell ~</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>downtime twist - </b>10/27/01 9:50:06 PM<br>~ <b>Tzinger</b><blockquote>First, it's proved that Cantata and Chorus of Clarity do stack.  The combo is faster than either Cantata or Chorus depending one which lute you play.  Cantata has a slightly larger radius than Chorus. A good downtime twist is Cantata, Clarity, Niv's. Regen's mana very nearly as fast and heals quite a bit. This is esp. good if you have a shaman who is trying to canabalize or a necro in your group.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Song available in Thurgadin also - </b>10/12/01 1:42:01 AM<br>~ <b>Bere</b><blockquote>A much easier place to obtain this song is in the Clerics guild at Thurgadin.

As far as stacking, no clue I'll leave that to the people playing it to decide.<br><br>Incidentally the AE range is 60ft, but that's a 30ft radius.

<b>twist in battle - </b>9/5/01 9:07:15 AM<br>~ <b>Rapsodi</b><blockquote>In my opion, there are 2 things that makes this song great.<br><br>1. Downtime can you can get a break from twisting, all though you do loose some hp regain, as a oposed to twisting hymn and clarity!<br><br>2. Battle you can twist this song as it last 3 ticks as most of our songs , and becouse of the range of this song I can keep mana/hp regain on the hole party while I twist 2 other songs<br><br>The other day in DL, group was 3 warriors, a necro, a cleric and me, tactic was taking the mobs,  <br>I found our cleric had more mana if I played this song insted of slowing the mobs.

<b>Use this during battle - </b>5/28/01 3:10:20 PM<br>~ <b>Nolus</b><blockquote>Problem that I see is that you guys said this song isn't that useful since it looks like your focused more on mana regeneration.  This song is great for just using it during battle, and twisting the mana song and regen song while resting.<br><br>Because it's a stackable song, you can sing other types of song during battle along with cantana, like singing cantana, anthem, and snare... a great way just to twist songs.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>RE: Cantana of Soothing problems - 5/8/01 12:10:59 PM - </b>5/15/01 5:31:19 AM<br>~ <b>renadin makeadin</b><blockquote>Just to clarify : <br>From a pure mana gaining pont of view twising this with our 32 couterpart is not worth it, the best results from mana in a test my friends and I did were :<br><br>No.1 lev 32 (clartity)<br>No.2 lev 34 (catana)<br>No.3 2 pulse 32(clarity), 1 pulse 34(catana)<br><br>From a mana regen point of view 2 and 3 were within 5 seconds of each other on the tests we did so it's not that bad. (on a 1min20sec med time for no.3 for 60% mana. result 1 was 1min I was level 47). I would imagine having a better lute would help too, my tests were done using a +5% gypsie lute.<br><br>From my test results I can only assume that this song is tic based even though it displays the icon for a longer duration. Of course having two bards in the group one doing 32 and the other doing 34 stacks nicely, but I am unsure of optimum dual bard mana twists due to lack of bards to help me test.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Cantana of Soothing problems - </b>5/8/01 12:10:59 PM<br>~ <b>Renadin Makesadin</b><blockquote>I would like to say that this song has an error as listed. it does not regen stamina as indicated. It does regen mana and health, but as this song is a compromise and does neither aswell as just mana or healing songs. Also my friends and I have done some tests and you cannot twist this song along with our mana song as it does not seem to stack. Two bards doing it does seem to have the desired effect, so if you want people just to get the most mana I would recomend doing ust the mana song if you are the only bard in the group. This song is best used when more than two people in the group are injured and you want to give mana aswell or when you need the added range of this spell effect when the casters won't sit close enough together.<br><br><br><i>Kocho~ Hmmm.... This song does stack with mana song. And it does regen stamina. As for exact stamina regen, its hard to tell. This song does not stack with Hymn, and I doubt it stacks with another Cantana from another bard.</i></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>. - </b>5/7/01 12:52:55 PM<br>~ <b>Kaotix Flux</b><blockquote>couldn't you twist THIS, hym, and manasong all at once for TOP speed mana/health regen? or is there something im missing?<br><br><i>Kocho ~ Hymn doesn't stack with this, although mana song does...</i></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>After testing... a great song indeed. - </b>4/9/01 4:36:22 PM<br>~ <b>Belark Songstrider</b><blockquote>It took me almost 10 levels to figure out what the best use of this song was. I have it figured out now.<br><br>The biggest advantage to this song: Range.  In a normal battle, you can hit every member of your party easily while singing this song, even if they are sitting on the sidelines. Even if YOU are sitting on the sidelines. Easily three times the range of 32 - manasong, thus making your life much easier.<br><br>In theory, you can also boost your party's mana regen by careful use of this song. Here's how that works:  Sing the following:<br><br>1. Catana of Soothing – 34<br>2. Cassindra's Chorus of Clarity – 32 (manasong)<br>3. Cassindra's Chorus of Clarity – 32 (manasong)<br><br>Why is this better than just manasong? In my testing (level 47) the Catana of Soothing seems to give 5 mana per tick. However, it lasts for 3 ticks, unlike manasong. Manasong gives 8 mana per tick, but doesn’t last for longer. <br><br>If you do the math, you see that if you sing just manasong, you provide your party with 8+8+8 = 24 mana per three ticks. If you twist as above, you provide (5*3)+8+8= 31 mana per three ticks. The only downside to doing this is that it is a lot of work, but it can help particularly when everyone is completely out of mana.<br><br>Once you get level 47, there is an excellent twist you should do during downtime, or even during battle with your lute:<br><br>1. Catana of Soothing - 34<br>2. Cassindra's Chorus of Clarity - 32<br>3. Niv's Melody of Preservation - 47<br><br>This provides approximately 66 points of health regen, and 23 points of mana every THREE ticks. Compare that to just singing manasong straight (24 per three ticks), and you can see the advantage. <br><br>Finally, consider singing this song during battle. If you are going to be using instruments anyway (chanting or messing, perhaps), twist in a pulse of this. It gives stamina to the tanks, regen to all, and extra mana regen for the casters. It helps, believe me!<br><br>-Belark Songstrider, 51st Minstrel of Drinal<br><br><br><br></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>This is meant to be an alternative not replacement - </b>3/23/01 2:55:10 PM<br>~ <b>Lyrak</b><blockquote>This song was intended to be a nice alternative to twisting 2 songs for times when you might need/want to go AFK.  It's healing is NO where as nice as our 6th level song with instrument and the 32 mana song seems way better.   Basically I only use this song if I am the most efficient healing in a group.  If you have a cleric just sing the mana song and let them do the healing.<br><br>I am curious though does a magic lute have any affect on this song?</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
