<b>Why it is resisted more - </b>7/6/02 1:53:43 PM<br>~ <b>Mierin</b><blockquote>As a response to why this song is resisted more than Bellow, it is probably due to the combination effect of an AC debuff added in with the damage.  If you look across the spectrum at other classes, you will find that the resist rates on combination damage/debuff spells/songs is always higher than either one alone.  Ask any druid how the Ro DoTs compare to the Swarm line and they will tell you, or for that matter, compare wisdom based root spells to int based ones.  Wisdom based roots have a damage component added in, and they break alot easier than wizard/chanter roots.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>Re: trouble increasing brass skill - </b>11/19/01 8:44:13 PM<br>~ <b>Ariaa</b><blockquote>Regarding earlier posts by some who have played and played this song without seeing brass skill increase, let me tell you my tale ....<br><br>At 18 I bought an unfinished brass horn in Halas, then found a secluded spot in everfrost to practice brass.  Shortly after I began playing, I observed that my SINGING skill had increased!!  What on Earth (Norrath?) was going on?<br><br>Then it hit me - my singing skill goes up on instrument-skill songs when I do not have the appropriate instrument equipped.  Postulating that my unfinished brass horn had to be &quot;finished&quot; or something to count as a brass instrument, I went to Qeynos and bought a horn at the Bard Guild there.  Back in EF, my Brass skill began to rise soon after I began playing this song.<br><br>Moral of the story:  Make SURE you have a working brass instrument.  I don't think an unfinished horn or a horn mouthpiece will do the job.  buy a plain ol' horn, and watch your skill increase.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
