				<td colspan="2"><span>Maybe it's just me, but I'm noticing drastic changes between being uber and being a newbie...
<br />
Yeah, all right, I'm not uber. I'll admit that most definitely, but they're pampering the newbies like babies. I know they need help because they're new, but... gah!! A free stack of bandages!? I remember when I had to tailor my own from spiderling silks! All spells scribed and memmed!? Armor equipped?! TIPS!? Whoa there! Hold on killer! Let's not get too far! A friend and I were joking about how sooner or later newbies won't even have an Auto Attack key -- They'll just look at a mob and get EXP. :P
<br />

<br />
On uber terms, which is a bit more of what I'm talking about (I don't mind the newbies much), I was thinking about what my cleric friend had linked to me a few days ago. It was <a target="_new" href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19052">An Oblong Seashell</a>, something I thought was pretty uber, since I'm only 54, and I know I'll never see the Elemental Planes or any gods. That being said another item popped into view, <a target="_new" href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17400">Black Collar of Boundless Might</a>. It appears to me that the more expansions there are the harder it is to reach out to what you would call &quot;uber&quot;, because the weapons and armor are just getting stronger and stronger. I've seen twinks that are 20 levels below me with better stats and everything (sadly. Sadly. Yes). 
<br />
Though most of the particularly uber stuff is no drop, a vast majority of uber items are droppable, and sell in the bazaar for a good amount of PP. I'm not complaining about twinks at all (I twink my alts myself), it's just that maybe they should tone down a bit on all the uber stuff. And epics... they used to be godly back in pre-Luclin expansions and everything. Now they suck and almost all POP weapons are better (of course). They should atleast upgrade the stats on epics to make them worthwhile. -.-
<br />
Am I wrong to think this because I'm not uber like the rest of the world on Karana? :\ Or is it just me? I need opinions... I know a lot of 65 friends who are what you would call uber, and the equipment they twink their alts with is just insane. I know it isn't very hard to make money at 65, and I'm EXP grinding like mad to be just like them. Am I jealous, and is this why I'm ranting on about stuff being too uber? Oi. -_-

				<td colspan="2"><span>It does suck seeing twinks with better gear then you.  The only way to get jaw droping gear is to quest it, or get into a raiding guild.  You arent going to get great gear soloing, and you arent going to get great gear grouping in zones that dont have quest armor drops.  Fact is, almost all of that great gear requires a Raid force to kill the mob that drops it, or flag you for the zone that it drops in.  The only exception is Ornate armor that drops in Bot, you dont need a flag to zone in there, and you can group there quite easily once you hit 63 (Possible earlier, but unlikely).
<br />
At 54, i would say Velious quest armor is your best bet.  Or start raiding in ToV for drop/quest gear.  
<br />
On the positive note though, Bards do not need great gear to be effective.  Great gear helps, that is for sure, but it is far from a requirement.  Our ability to sing to a raid or group doesnt require mana (except for Fading memories). Our ability to sing doesnt require us to break a certain amount of HP.  I have sung stark naked with rez effects in SSRA, VT, BoT, and helped my group or raid through a tough fight before looting my corpse.
<br />
Hang in there, be an effective bard and the gear will come.  You just have to be in the right zones to get it.</span></td>

Take Fansy.  He ran around Oasis stark naked with only a MM drum.  Sure he died every so often, but darned that guy is a hoot.

Take that unkown warrior that showed up to group with you in DL that had all this nice equipment, but couldn't hit anything for beans or keep aggro then blames his death on the cleric for not healing enough.  This is not uber, this is twinkie land and the guy probably diserved to lay out there but our cleric rezzed him anyway.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Uber is only the way you see things...  I guarantee you there is nothing comparable with time equipment that is droppable.  However I do understand what you are talking about in terms of twinks.  I myself have a beastlord twink with some pretty nice gear...

<br />
With time and levels comes money and equipment to twink other characters with.  If you are new to the game, then I am jealous of you.  I wish I still had the ability to be wowed by the vastness of the game.  To explore zones I've never seen before.  To go dungeon crawling and not know what is around the next corner...
<br />

<br />
Instead now I am relegated to trying to get my new twink to a high enough level where he can raid with my guild and get the &quot;uber&quot; equipment.  Which by other guilds standards is not &quot;uber&quot; at all.  There used to be a day when clearing NToV, killing Vindi, Statue, Tormax and AoW was a huge accomplishment.  Now it is for guilds that aren't able to get flagged for the elementals or kill emp ssra to get into VT yet.  Enjoy the game for all its worth, because eventually you will get to a point where you wish you could be a true newb again.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>And think about what we (the higher level populace) have done to the newbies before you complain about what SOE has done by giving them tips and bandages.  A newbie usually fights spiderlings at some point... and people pay 5plat for every spiderling silk, or spider silk, thats 100pp each stack!  Now that is pampering far more than a few tips and a single stack of bandages.  That means that with silk sales and careful shopping, I could get a level 10 warrior a full set of validus or crusty armor without twinking with my high level characters.  By the end of one week if I was willing, I could afford a centi LS or other &quot;ultimate&quot; weapon as we believed them to be back years ago when we were level 10 and saw the high levels using them
<br />

<br />
EQ has changed.  And it is not just SOE that is changing it.  We the players have changed it.  But that does not make it bad.  I LOVE talking with my wife about our newbie days and how much fun it was argueing over who got to use the FS morningstar today (our only decent weapon between us).  However, our son LOVES using PoK to go places and that he can dye his armor any color he wants (provided we buy dyes for him).  Each new generation of newbies will have fun in a new way, just as in RL we had fun in different ways that our children do.
<br />

<br />
So enjoy it, don't knock it =)  And go shopping in the bazaar if you want gear as uber as the newbies, thats where they got it.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Well said Solkarr.  I have been playing this game entirely too long now lol (since beta 3) and I still at times catch myself shaking my head at what newbies have today.  I can remember at level 17 saving up all my money (60 plat!) and borrowing 75 plat from a friend so I could...drum roll please...buy a full set of banded armor!!!  <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-3.gif" border="0" alt="Scared" hspace="2" /> 
<br />
Of course, I had to wait a few days til I caught one of the few blacksmiths online who could make banded (I'm not joking lol).  The only reason my friend had so much money (75 plat at level 20) was cause he would kill willowisps and sell the greater lightstones to players! <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-13.gif" border="0" alt="LOL" hspace="2" />
<br />
Yeah, times have changed.  But like Solkarr I just try to keep it in perspective and not let it bother me.  It's all about having fun regardless of your level or gear.  I also agree that there should be new epic quests....perhaps ones that require you to be 65 to begin and take as much effort to do now as the original epics did back when they came out.  Now that, to me, would be fun <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />

				<td colspan="2"><span>Sunflora, i totally agree with you. I started playing EQ the hard way, no gear, no weapon but the one i started with, no armor, nothing. I earned my items piece by piece. Am i uber ? God no!! But at least I've learned d*mn fast how to twist 4 songs in combat, i had to in order to survive in the hard world that Norrath is.
<br />

<br />
Today noobies starts with Sense Heading caped, a backpack, a stack of bandage, food &amp; water, spells scribed and a little yellow message telling them when they have ''new spells available at a local guildmaster near you''.
<br />

<br />
As it has been told in that post, EQ has changed. My theorie is that there isent such things as ''noobs'' anymore, at least very few. Now the noobies are the ''alts'' of some 65 other character. If they have not such a character, they know EQ cause a friend and/or parents that have one told them about it, so this friend helped him getting started.
<br />

<br />
I once saw a friend of mine grouped with a bard who was lvl 35. this guys was in Singing steel all over, had a battledrummer main-gauche, a troubadour's mace and the Delf, iksar mask...this bard was singing his personal haste song alone in battle, he didnt knew how to actually play a bard.
<br />

<br />
Am i jealous ? h*ll YES !! I can only dream about such gear for now...on another hand, i'm far more competent then this guy and thinking about it, who would you rather like to have in your group ? The twinked noob with uber equipement, or the not so bad equiped real bard ?</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>As someone who began playing Everquest 3 months after its release &lt; does that make me old? &gt;, I am continually shocked at the amount (and quality) of gear that can be purchased for so little platinum now.
<br />

<br />
I know that SOE / Verant think that adding &quot;more and better&quot; gear and items makes the game more attractive.  I would personally disagree.  I think that more content (new zones or revamping old zones) would have been better.  It's true that they have added more zones, but they also up the level of the items and such.  Regardless, I think that you do not make a game better by making it mindlessly bigger or by giving new players everything on a silver platter.  One of the biggest joys of EQ in the early days was the exploration and learning.  Entering a zone and being awed by what you saw.  Getting lost and having to hunt for your body.  It may have been difficult, but I think it added a grittiness to the game that is missing now.
<br />

<br />
A little more expansion to the areas we know and love would be better a better strategy.  They should take a chance and actually CHANGE zones.  Take the risk and make the world more dynamic.  The original zones/ the politics / the layout of cities and such have all remained stagnant. (( example:  Why haven't the orcs in Crushbone and the Elves of Kelethin had a war yet?.... Why haven't the Paladins of North Freeport pushed out the corrupt militia or vice versa? ))
<br />

<br />
Anyway... enough rambling and back to the question.  
<br />

<br />
NO...  You are not wrong for being jealous about the gear that others toss about so freely.  If you were not envious of those things, you would be satisfied with what you have/are and you would not have the desire to improve yourself.  I am NOT uber and I will never be uber.  I have worked hard to get where I am with all of my characters and never been in the position to toss around thousands of plat twinking my alts.  They tend to get the hand-me-downs from my other mains.  
<br />

<br />
What will I be??  I will be the most competent bard I can be.  I will learn my skills, my songs, and my strategies.  I will listen to the words of those wiser than myself and take their experience as my own.  I will take what I have learned (whether through my own discovery or the experience of others) and pass it along to others that might benefit from it.
<br />

<br />
I would trade 1 competent Bard (or cleric, or warrior, or enchanter, or anything) over 5 heavily twinked idiots that don't know what they are doing.  The professions in Everquest have so many subtle skills and styles that most never explore.   
<br />

<br />
So.. don't be jealous of those that have more.  Aspire to be like those that KNOW more.  Gear may make up for a lot of things, but it doesn't replace the brains, experience, or intuition that a skilled player has.</span></td>

I have never had cash, though recently have scrounged enough to catch up a bit on gear upgrades.  It was so bad, that at 61, I was still wearing a cougar claw earring!!!  I've had guildies (that know and love me for my competent skills as a bard and EQ player), look at my magelo as recently as a month ago and say OMG how on earth have you done so well with such crappy gear!
<br />

<br />
Now, I'm a tad better off but by no means uber.  I did it with a few lucky rolls on greed drops that allowed me to grab several decent items, but by the level restrictions on them, I should have had them at 45 not 62...
<br />

<br />
That being said, I don't mind that my pocket cleric got two levels in a chain pulling group with a twink ogre warrior that must have  had close to 250,000 plat worth of gear on him.  Sure my cleric has roughly 2k spent on him (just so I could buy the cheapest wisdom gear I could to get him close to 200 wisdom, disregarding all other stats).  
<br />

<br />
What makes me proud is going into a totally new LDoN dungeon with me a 62 bard, and 5 65 guildies (thus a 65 dungeon) and them having me, the lowbie newbie pull.  Only twice did I pull adds, both from my first two critical failures on lull (with a 190 cha)?  I'm new to pulling so this is an area I'm still working on, so it was a thrill for me to do it well.  All boils down to skill.  I love the comradery with my friends, I rarely do pickup groups and play for the love of the friendships.  I'm happy where I am, sure I'd love to advance but with the help of my friends I'll get there.  If people want to twink, fine, just don't put me down for not being uber, hehe.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I agree totally with you all. Things have changed but things have remained the same also. No matter how well you twink your toon you have to be able to &quot;play&quot; the game. If you have no idea how to &quot;be&quot; your class, you look like an a**. I myself have twinked  up 6 toons with my now 64 druid (my main  for the time being). I started a bard, twinked him, began playing him, (completely new class to me) and fell directly in love with him. Currently i am only lvl 38, i am equipped prolly as good as some upper 50's maybe even 60's bards. I don't care who thinks i am a twink. I am learning my class by leaps and bounds. Hopefully when i hit 39 and 40 i will get this swarm technique down. right now i just chant kite mostly. But my goal is to become the best bard i can be to benefit myself, friends, and my guild. I am in a great raiding guild on prexus, my bard is unguilded because alts are not allowed until 51, so i have a way to go. but when we go kill rumblecrush and doomshade, i am permitted to bring my bard for the bard only drops as we only have a couple of bards in the guild and they are not always on the raid. 
<br />

<br />
I guess the point i am trying to make is don't hate the player for his gear.....hate the player for his inability to play his toon for the benefit of the group, guild, etc.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I think one problem on the items standpoint is that excpecially on the older servers there is just to much Platinum on the servers total...I mean look around on the net and you can pic up plat for less than a buck a grand. I think they need to seriously consider downsizing the plat pool on every server. I dont know exactly how they would do this but one way ive thought about is have npc merchants that sell gear that is acctually usefull and make the gear no drop. Another one I just came up with is for all the quests with uber armour and such make people turn in money as well as the quest items, they kind of did this with the ornate armor quests where you pay 500pp or something to get the emblem. they should have more things like that.</span></td>
