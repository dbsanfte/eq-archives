<b>Introduction</b>
<br>There’s a lot of confusion about playing a bard.
I’m writing this document to try to clear up some of those misconceptions,
and tell you what a bard can do. You’ll group much better with one (I am
consistently surprised at the number of mid-30’s players I group with who
don’t understand what we do), and you may even be tempted to try it.
<br><br>First of all, I want to stress one thing about
playing a bard. Don’t do it unless you are willing to almost ALWAYS be
doing something. It’s often said that after a tough battle, the tanks sit
down, the casters open their spellbooks and all the players go grab a snack.
The bard’s still standing there twisting the mana song and healing. Even
when simply running around, you’re often twisting songs (say to bring up
your strength if encumbered, or levitate, or ultravision). Don’t play one
if you have carpal tunnel syndrome, you’re going to need more manual dexterity
for this class than any other.
<br><br>
<b>Song Twisting</b>
<br>For those who don’t know what twisting songs means,
this is the act of keeping more than one song active. All songs have a
casting time of 3 seconds, and work on a 6 second pulse timing. The large
majority of these songs last 3 pulses. That is to say, you hit the hotkey,
the song takes 3 seconds before you see the text message, and then is active
for the next 18 seconds. Only a few songs (Bellow, Charm, and Target Mesmerize
for instance) don’t have an affect over time. These songs last 6 seconds
and usually have an immediate affect (Bellow is a target damage for instance).
For these types of songs, the song can be stopped immediately after the
effect is seen instead of waiting for the full 6 second cycle. That means
you can be pumping these songs out almost once every 3 seconds (missed
notes (like fizzles) and lag will delay you a bit).
<br><br>When playing a bard, it’s expected that you are
able to keep at LEAST two songs going at all times, and three if you want
to be considered a knowledgeable bard. Three is the standard, and to truly
play the bard you need to do three. Slower computers and networks can sometimes
prohibit this, as can certain zones (most bards find Unrest so lagged that
two is often the norm, for instance). This is why lag is death to a bard.
There are other reasons lag is death to a bard, which I’ll talk about below.
<br><br>It is possible to twist four songs. On a really
good day I can maintain a four song rate without dropping any effects about
1 out of every 4 or 5 twist cycles. Most times I can’t keep them all going
at the same time. But for the one or two seconds you might lose that other
buff, in certain circumstances it works just fine. Four song twists are
usually used for tougher instrument-only soloing. It’s definitely not a
requirement of the class. But be aware that it can be done. Some bards
even claim 5 is possible, but I’ve never tried it. I suspect they’re on
much faster machines than me.
<br><br>Now, it is also possible to twist instruments.
Most people freak out at the concept of this at first, but it’s really
not as tough as it sounds (although there are varying degrees). For the
most part, this means starting a song with an instrument equipped, waiting
for the text message, starting the next song, switching the instruments
before the next text message, and repeating. Usually this is done with
three songs and two instruments, and it’s simply a matter of having one
of the instruments on your cursor and the other in your melee 2 slot (all
instruments are like 2-handed offhand weapons. You can’t dual wield with
them), and leaving your cursor there during combat and clicking the mouse
button to swap. I have an extensive discussion of twisting instruments
and weapons below.
<br><br>All of this is not designed to scare you off from
the bard. I just don’t think that very many people who never have played
one past about 7th level really know how demanding it can be. The price
you pay for little downtime is constant action.<br><br>There
is a fairly new alternative to many of our twisting problems. Using a gamepad (I
use a Sidewinder Pro USB) with appropriate software you can map keystrokes to
hotpad keys, and have those keystrokes repeat if the button is held down. Using
these you can set up macros that will automatically twist songs, and recover
(though not as well) from missed notes, bashes, etc. Essentially, it's not good
for combat purposes, but for downtime, it'll really save you twisting that mana/heal.
I'm not going to go into great detail about the way it works, but I can say that
it's quite easy with the Sidewinder, which cost me around $50 CDN. You can find
more detail about this in the message forums of The Concert Hall, linked
below.&nbsp;
<br><br>For precise listings of songs and
skills, their effects, places of purchase, levels, and all the gory detail you
could ever desire, check out the Bard Song Reference Sheet by Rokenn Swiftsong
of Karana server. This document is here to serve as advice for the techniques
and nuances of playing a bard.
<br><br><b>Bard Abilities</b>
<br>Now what can a bard do? Well, the jack of all
trades/master of none label is pretty appropriate. We get a bunch of cool
skills, but most of them are capped at ridiculously low levels (sneak at 75 when we get an invisibility song for instance, or hide at 40 when all
wood elves start with it at 50 anyway). Probably the most useful skills
a bard gets are track (at level 35, capped at 100) and
safe fall (capped low, but it does what it needs to). We get completely
stiffed on the melee skills for a supposed hybrid (dual wield and dodge
is it). And of course our songs can’t compare to caster’s spells. Or can
they?
<br><br>There are a few factors that make the bard almost
as powerful as true casters. Most important of these is to not ignore the
fact that almost everything a bard does is area effect to either party
or mobs. I now heal about 15 points of damage every 6 seconds with a lute
equipped. Not a big deal right, considering that clerics at my level have
greater heal and other mega-heal songs. Then consider that as a party effect.
This amounts to 150 points of healing per minute per person, and in a six
person party that is all taking damage this amounts to 900 points of healing
per minute! Not bad - when you consider that this is without mana as well.
How long does it take a cleric to meditate the mana back used to heal 900
points at this level? I have no idea, but I’d wager it’s probably about
a minute.
<br><br>Similarly, most people don’t realize the magic
based damage that bards are capable of doing. By twisting two songs with
two different instruments, I usually do somewhere in the range of 30 points
of damage every pulse. Amounting to 300 points of damage per minute. Once
again, not bad at all.
<br><br>What’s the catch to these? It always happens OVER
TIME. Sure, we can heal 900 points per minute. But we can’t heal 900 points
in 5 seconds. It’s not 300 points of damage in 5 seconds. And this is why
we’re second to all the other classes in terms of our abilities, just this
simple over time effect.
<br><br>Now, bard buffing. Bard buffing, for those of
you who have never noticed, is incredible. A level 29 enchanter casting
Endure Magic on me (wood elf, base magic resistance 25) raises it to about
45. At the same level, by twisting two songs I can raise it to about 63.
93 with a drum. And 103 with a Mistmoore drum. This is amazing buffing,
the best in the game most likely. It affects the entire party all the time.
What’s the catch? Well, if I’m buffing magic resistance like that, there’s
not much else I can do. I can add some healing in there for instance. But
a shaman can lay down those 8 buffs while my maximum is 3, and go on to
DoT the mob. I’m stuck doing it for the whole fight, or at least until
the casters are dead and I can switch to another combo.
<br><br>I’ve said this so people realize that a bard can
seem very powerful sometimes, but is always very limited. So I’ve established
that a bard can be incredibly effective over time. This is why a party
with a bard often never notices they’re there, yet don’t realize how the
bard effects are sort of just smoothing everything over in the background
constantly, buffing them up a bit, healing them a bit, damaging the mob
a bit.
<br><br>Where do we excel? The answers here may surprise
some. Not any surprise is our speed. Selo’s, the bard running song, is
acquired at level 5 and you basically never stop singing it except when
standing or fighting (and even then a lot of the time). Many people are
confused as to how fast Selo’s is, and let me tell you, it’s fast. Before
level 10, with a drum we’re outrunning similar level SoW. By the time you
hit the high 20’s, you can outrun any SoW without even an instrument. At
level 40 with a regular drum we make Spirit of Cheetah look pretty slow,
and with a MM drum we make level 40 bards look slow. I can’t even conceive
of what a bard with the Drum of Selo’s March (Nagafen loot) could do. So
we’re very fast. There is eventually only one mob in the entire game that
can catch us, and that’s shadowed men. I've now even heard of some level 50
bards claim they can just barely outrun them.
<br><br>Where else? Well, believe it or not, bards are
amongst the best solo classes in the game. A bard’s true potential is found
in a party, but we can kite with direct damage not that far behind a druid’s.
It’s often slow, but since Selo’s doesn’t wear off as long as it’s sung
and we don’t need mana to deal direct damage, it can be done as long as
the mob doesn’t resist or outrun us (which is possible sometimes, Grimfeather comes to mind..). And when we get charm it’s a deadly
combination with Selo’s. We can basically stay well out of range and just
keep two mobs smacking on each other until one’s dead. The charm only lasts
10 seconds, but Selo’s can keep us safe and the song can be sung as many
times as needed. And you can always switch targets to the one that is winning
to make sure you get the kill. This is where lag is tremendously dangerous
though, because sometimes mobs will pop on you and stun you (making it
impossible to get Selo’s started) in a lag bubble, or a song’s effect will
wear off (the server for some reason things you’ve switched songs in the
lag) unexpectedly. So I only do this when I’ve got a good solid connection
with no lag.
<br><br>We are the only class in the game other than enchanters
that have notable powers of crowd control. It’s not at all uncommon a sight
to see a bard standing in the middle of a bunch of mesmerized mobs playing
a lute while the group picks each one off one at a time. I’ve successfully
mesmerized 11 mobs at the same time with a lute equipped. And we even get
to wear nice armour to take some beats when the mesmerize is resisted.
Crucial to this is a group that understands how to assist and not be picking
on multiple targets. We also get charm and target mesmerize, which lets
us crowd control a smaller number very effectively. And if things are looking
ugly and you’re underground and can’t sing Selo’s, you just pull out the
area of effect Fear and run for your life.
<br><br><b>Starting Stats</b>
<br>A brief note on important stats to a bard before
I discuss hotkeys below. Basically everything is important to a bard in
some way except for wisdom and intelligence (other than for trade skills and
skill increases). Strength is needed for when
using weapons (yes we do use them often, especially at higher levels when
we get some very powerful voice-only songs), and for wearing armour. Stamina
becomes critical at higher levels in extended melees, and I’ve heard many
level 50 bards say they wish they’d spent a little in stamina. Agility affects
AC, and should be comfortably high enough (mine is 95 base) to assure you won't
have to wear any AGI-increasing items for a long time, if ever. Dexterity is
somewhat critical to a bard, as our skill checks
for playing songs on instruments are done against it. Many bards like to use
weapons that proc (have a magical effect) and DEX affects how often weapons will
process. And Charisma is checked
for sung songs according to some sources, and most definitely affects resist
rates on mesmerize, lull and charm. Missed notes are calculated off of dexterity
and charisma, but any score over 95 in both should be sufficient for missed
notes.
<br><br><b>Hotkeys</b>
<br>I’ve included screenshots of my own setup to help
illustrate things a little, but this can be confusing. You will be playing
with hotkeys constantly as a bard, and cursing Verant for not letting you
have more banks quite often.
<br><br>Each of my hotkey banks has a sort of encompassing
purpose to minimize swapping between them if possible. You still do a lot
of hotkey bank swapping. Make sure you use the Shift-hotkeybank key and
not the arrows you click, or you’ll drop instruments and weapons constantly.
<br><br>Swapping is simple enough. You just click the
instrument into the Melee 2 slot before you see the text message for whatever
song you just started. If you’re swapping two instruments constantly, you
just need to keep the cursor over the melee 2 slot in your hotkey bank
and click to swap them. It’s the timing that takes a little practice.
<br><br><img SRC="images/imgHotkey1.jpg" width="111" height="177" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="3" border="0" alt="HotKey setup 1">
Bank 1 is my travelling bank usually, and often
when camped in a dungeon or in a dangerous spot for awhile it’s my evacuation
bank. 1 and 2 are usually skills or hotkey macros (the ones in that shot
are sense heading and my run hotkey). 3 and 4 are usually the songs I need
for evacuation or travelling. Selo’s is almost always in 3. 4 is often
Fear for evacuation, or invisibility for travel as well. If I have to twist
something while travelling, like Selo’s and a strength buff at the same
time, 4 is where it would go also. 5 is almost always my Melee 2 (left
hand, instrument hand) slot, on most banks. 6 is an inventory slot with
the instrument most likely to be needed in it.
<br>
<br clear="left"><br>
<img SRC="images/imgHotkey2.jpg" width="105" height="171" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="3" border="0" alt="HotKey setup 2">
Bank 2 is my bank for twisting instruments and
weapons. The drum is equipped in the picture, but usually this would most
likely have a lute equipped. 1 is Anthem, the haste/STR song. 2 is my damage
shield song. 3 is healing. 4 is the melee 1 (primary) slot, 5 is the melee
2 (secondary, instrument) slot, 6 is my primary hand weapon in a general
inventory slot. How I’d do this usually is start off with the weapon I
use in my offhand on the cursor (picked up from hotkey bank #5). I start
the healing song, and wait ‘til I see the message. I then click on the
instrument in the melee 2 slot, click on the primary weapon in the inventory
slot (which puts the lute in inventory), and then click the primary weapon
onto the melee 1 slot. Of course I was starting the next song (Anthem)
while doing this. After I start heal on the next twist round, I just reverse
the swap, wait ‘til I see the message and then twist the weapons back in.
This is the trickiest twist in the game.
<br>
<br clear="left"><br><img SRC="images/imgHotkey3.jpg" width="113" height="175" hspace="10" vspace="3" border="0" align="left" alt="HotKey setup 3">Bank 3 is usually my primary screen during most
combat. This is where I put all the songs I want to use with instruments,
90% of the time.&nbsp; Sometimes this bank is used in situations (dungeons
where my AoE is a really bad idea for instance) where it’s purely weapon,
but most likely I’m not using instruments at all except for a few specialized
things (lull, charm) or during resting in those situations. You can probably
picture pretty much how this works.&nbsp; 1, 2 and 3 are my primary songs
that I intend on twisting. Ignore what’s in the one above, 1 would usually
be 1 DDD (brass, DoT), 2 CoD (string, DoT) and 3 healing. 4 will often
be snare. 5 is usually something I don’t need to use often, but use one
of the two instruments I’m twisting (in this case brass and string) such
as lullaby. 6 is the melee 2 slot. I pick up the instrument I need from
bank 5 usually and keep it on my cursor while I swap the instruments and
twist the three songs. If I need to switch to weapons, I have to quickly
switch to bank number 5 to do so.
<br><br>Bank 3 is also my kite bank when I’m kiting. 1
is always healing, 2 is always Bellow (DD), 3 is always Selo’s. I don’t
twist instruments when kiting. Just twist one tap of Selo’s with drum and
two taps of Bellow over and over again. If you get tagged, forsake a pulse
of bellow for a pulse of healing, and you can even switch to lute if you
feel lucky to heal quick. If I’m hurt bad, I’ll switch to lute full time
and run back and forth with undrummed Selo’s and full lute healing, although
I wouldn’t recommend this until you’re sure you can outrun the mob without
a drum. I don’t like messing with instrument swaps kiting.
<br>
<br clear="left"><br><img SRC="images/imgHotkey4.jpg" width="111" height="173" hspace="10" vspace="3" border="0" align="left" alt="Hot Key Setup 4">
Bank 4 is my charm bank. You won’t have to worry
about this one for awhile. Before charm, it was basically another bank
like 3 with alternate setup. This one has the /pet attack and /pet back
off commands hotkeyed, the charm song in 3 and whatever else I want to
twist with it in 4 (usually Selo’s when outdoors). You might want to set
this one up as a kite bank until you get charm, if you intend to kite much
or at all.
<br>
<br clear="left"><br><img SRC="images/imgHotkey5.jpg" width="113" height="173" hspace="10" vspace="3" border="0" align="left" alt="HotKey setup 5">
Bank 5 is my inventory bank. This is the all-purpose
swapping screen. I only have room for two instruments, unfortunately, but
I usually find one of my instruments (like the flute) can be put into it’s
own bank with the specialized songs I have memmed (the flute is in my charm
bank in this setup). 1 and 2 are always my melee 1 and 2 slots, 3 and 4
are always my secondary and primary weapon respectively (just to keep me
organized), and 5 and 6 are instruments that change around depending on
what I need.
<br clear="left"><br><br>One warning: if you click on the little spaces
between the hotkey boxes you will drop what you’re holding. So be careful,
I’ve lost a dragoon dirk that way.
<br><br>You can also twist three different instruments
and three different songs. You’ll find this is incredibly rare, the songs
just don’t match up that way for the most part. I’ve done it a few times
(brass/DDD, lute/heal, drum/Chant) though. You just use the same type of
hotkey bank that 1 and 4 looks like (with the melee 2 slot in 5 and the
inventory slot in 6) and start with the third instrument on your cursor. You may
want to use this twist past level 42 or so, using Beserker Crescendo (brass),
Chant of Flame (drum) and heal or another string-based song.
<br><br>The important thing to remember is that the instrument
ONLY has to be equipped when the song actually pulses, which is when you
see the text message. It doesn’t have to be equipped when the song starts
or ends, just when that text message actually appears. Also, something
that helps sometimes if spell effects and so on are causing you lag to
switch to a 3rd person view, things go much smoother then. Turning down
the clipping plane, sky effects and particle depth helps a lot as well. Bard
songs can cause tremendous lag past 39, once the full range of particle effects
are unleashed.
<br><br>Also, these hotbanks are ALWAYS changing for me to
whatever suits the purpose at the time. I now often have an extra button which
is simply a social key that is the /stopsong command. While you use this
essentially never in regular play, it's used for my gamepad macros. My guise of
the deciever now occupies a slot, as do assist keys and even, at times,
equipment swapping keys. These are just to provide you some ideas of how bards
should be using hotkeys to their utmost.
<br><br><b>Important Songs</b>
<br>Bards get one song per level, but not all need
to be explained. Here are some of the abbreviations and more important
ones you’ll see. It should also be noted that skill increases in singing,
percussion, string, brass and wind instruments have SIGNIFICANT effects
on each song. This is why many level 50 bards will often have a level 1
song memorized. Some of our songs are useless, but those that are useful
tend to always be useful.
<br><br><i>Chant of Battle</i> (CoB, or just Chant) -
percussion song that buffs party strength and dexterity. Wonderful if lots
of people are using proc weapons, or you have an enchanter who’s alacritying.
Not used much otherwise.
<br><br><i>Jaxan’s Jig of Vigor</i> (Jig) - percussion,
refreshes stamina. Becomes handy with heavy weapons. But mostly included
to stress here that the myth that this song regenerates mana faster is
just that, a myth. It’s a graphics glitch, and don’t let anyone boss you
into singing it. Handy for dungeons where you can’t sing Selo’s, as it
will let you jump the whole way to zone.
<br><br><i>Selo’s Accelerando</i> - the running song,
percussion. Usually just referred to as Selo, and the reason we need safe
fall and levitate.
<br><br><i>Hymn of Restoration</i> (HoR or Hymn) - stringed
instrument, healing. Starts at about 6 points per pulse with a lute, eventually
in the 20’s at higher levels.
<br><br><i>Anthem de Arms</i> (Anthem) - party strength
buff and haste effect. Speeds up attacks by about 10%, nothing like
Alacrity but nice if you don’t have anything else. Does not stack with
Chant. Later replaced with an AGI/20% haste buff that DOES stack with Chant of
Battle. There are more party haste buff upgrades in the 40's and at 50, and
likely will be in expansion, as providing party haste is one of the bardic
staples in groups.
<br><br><i>Jonthan's Whistling Warsong</i> (Warsong) - sung,
SELF-ONLY buff and haste effect. Haste effect is around 25%. Many people stop
using this song (level 7) once they get Anthem at level 10, but this song is FAR
superior when soloing. It's our only self-only song, and it provides
considerably more haste than Anthem. It buffs STR comperably to Anthem, also
buffs AC, and IS stackable with Chant of Battle. It's quite some time (level 50,
actually) before any of our party haste buffs exceed the haste benefit of this
song.&nbsp;
<br><br><i>Brusco’s Boastful Bellow </i>- target direct
damage. Does level/2+1 points damage max (16 at level 30). Very useful
for kiting, but most of our area of effect/damage over time songs are much
more effective. Doesn’t get resisted much, and will interrupt spellcasting.
<br><br><i>Chords of Dissonance</i> (CoD) - area of effect,
damage over time. Been a long time since I’ve tested it, and the various
PvP changes make it tough these days. In the mid-teens, it did about 11
points per pulse with lute equipped, for a 33 total over the twist cycle.
If being used on several mobs becomes that much more efficient, as you’re
doing equal damage to all mobs.
<br><br><i>Denon’s Disruptive Discord</i> (DDD) - area
of effect, damage over time, AC debuffer. First brass song and basically
an upgrade to CoD. Does about 18 damage per tick, and debuffs AC by about
5 points at level 20 with brass skill maxed. Stacks with Chords.
<br><br>Rhythms series - a series of percussion songs
that all buff magic resistance, and buff different saves depending on the
song. Standard strategy is to always sing Guardian Rhythms, which just
buffs magic resistance, and either Purifying or Elemental rhythms depending
on the type of magic you’re facing. Purifying protects against the poison/disease
type lines of spells, Elemental against the fire/cold based.
<br><br>Psalm series - a series of voice songs that add
protection against a specific save (cold, fire, disease and poison), a small
amount of AC and in some
cases add a damage shield to the entire party. Psalm of Warmth and Cooling, the
cold and fire resistance songs respectively, have the damage shield. Can be incredibly efficient,
especially if you have stuff attacking you that hits fast, and multiple mobs
beating on you happens occasionally. Shield stacks with all other damage shields except
those of the opposite type (fire-based damage shield won’t stack with cold-based
damage shield, basically). Warmth also grants infravision, and Cooling grants
ultravision, which human party members
appreciate.
<br><br><i>Selo’s Consonant Chain</i> (Chain) - sung target
snare and attack speed debuffer. Definitely not as good as the true snare
line due to resist rate, but the speed debuffing is a nice addition and
can make it useful to twist from the very beginning of combat. Will cancel
ALL other snares and root effects, so make sure you’re the only one in
a party snaring. Can be deadly in combination with fear, allowing you to
"reverse kite" a mob.
<br><br><i>Kelin’s Lucid Lullaby </i>(Lullaby, nod song)
- stringed instrument AoE mesmerize. Without a lute, will lull a maximum
of 4 targets. No maximum when lute equipped. Also erases the mob’s aggro
list, leaving ONLY the bard on it. For this reason bards take a LOT of
punishment when this song is resisted, and a cleric is almost a must to
watch the bard’s health. They usually can NOT twist this song, but rather
keep the entire pack lulled while everyone else focuses on one mob at a
time. Can be incredibly impressive, incredibly useful, and incredibly dangerous.
Your party MUST understand that they have to all be hitting the same target
at all times for this to work. This song does appear to be somewhat broken, and
it's not advisable to use it much at all past the high 20's or so.
<br><br><i>Kelin’s Lugubrious Lament</i> - stringed target
lull. Makes you invaluable for breaking spawns. Make sure you lull the
mobs in the back, as drawing the unlulled ones past will often wake them
up. Very short duration, but possible to lull as many as three targets
and pull successfully with practice. Resisted a LOT less than the enchanter
line, but be ready to run if it is resisted as you’ll probably pull the
whole camp.
<br><br><i>Cassindra’s Chorus of Clarity</i> - the famous
mana song. Does us no good, but the casters sure love it. This is sung,
but it does NOT have a continuous effect. You only actually get mana back
each time you see the text message, so twisting this song reduces it’s
effectiveness. Very slightly better than the enchanter Clarity with similar
caster levels according to most tests, but tough to really pin down. Unlike
ALL other bard songs, this one WILL stack with itself, so two bards singing
it will increase mana even faster. Will also stack with Clarity spell.
<br><br>Chants series - this series of songs all do a
combination targeted DoT and resistance debuff, and are percussion-based. While
these songs were once considered rather inferior, the bug that stopped
percussion instruments from increasing their effect was fixed recently. These
songs are now extremely damaging with a drum, especially a magic one, equipped,
and the resistance debuff is significant. These songs have reopened kiting
options up to high level bards, and made pure-instrument fighting much more
viable at higher levels.
<br><br>Bards can also target mesmerize/stun, charm (in 2
versions at 27 and 39), fear,
levitate, breathe underwater, sing a party invisibility song (WAY too short
range for travel though), improve faction, see invisible and get ultravision,
locate corpses, teleport short distances, and even eventually sing a 300+
point AoE damage song, which is uses 800 mana. We even
get a wisdom/intelligence buffing song in the 40’s.
<br><br>Many of the instruments songs claim to use don't
actually have an increased effect when using that instrument. Levitate, for
instance, works no better with a flute, nor does water breathing. You can use
these songs to train the skill, but there's no need to use the instruments
otherwise. Check Rokenn's bard song reference sheet for which songs are actually
enhanced by an instrument. At the time I made the screenshots above, I was under
the impressions that the flute enhanced the charm song - data given by GZ in
Arch-Mage Answers now shows this to be otherwise, and I never bother with a
flute for charm anymore.
<br><br>A quick note on mana - most people are confused by
bardic mana. Bard mana is based on intelligence. It is NOT affected by our own
or the enchanter Clarity line. It was placed in-game more as a timer for our
level 43 AoE damage song, and does not function like anyone else's mana. I'm
unsure if our recently added ability to meditate (added just to make song
memorization faster) increases our mana regeneration, but it would be a very
small increase. Very recently, an upgrade to our charm song that lets us charm
mobs as high as at least level 52 was added, and it uses a small amount of mana
now as well.
<br><br><b>Twists</b>
<br>There are a few commonly used twists that should
be mentioned. First and foremost is the DDD/CoD/Hymn twist, using a lute
and a brass horn. This is incredibly effective, allowing you to do almost
30 points of damage and heal 10 ever 6 seconds. This is often more effective
in solo direct combat than using even high-end weapons. Many people don’t
believe that - test it sometime. Of course, hand to hand melee is used
here but doesn’t make that big a difference.
<br><br>Guardian Rhythms/Purifying OR Elemental Rhythms/Hymn
- Purifying and Elemental don’t stack with each other, but both stack with
Guardian. Using drum and lute, you can heal your party and buff magic resistance
up into the 90’s.
<br><br>Chant/Jonthan’s Whistling Warsong/Hymn - your
first 3-song twist combination, possible at level 7. Jonthan’s is basically
a self-only and slightly better version of Anthem. You won’t use it much
once you get Anthem, as you’ll be mostly grouping at this point. This is
where to master your 3-song twisting. This twist would be done while fighting
with weapons.
<br><br>Denon's Disruptive Discord/Chords of Dissonance/Hymn -
one of the staple bard twists. Pulse of Denon's with a horn, and a pulse each of
CoD and Hymn with a lute. Incredibly efficient in the high teens through low
20's, especially if soloing. Stays very viable into high levels - at level 35 I
was using this to kill green frogs in Upper Guk MUCH more efficiently than with
my weapons. Adding one of the Chants to the mix with a drum - turning this into
a 3-instrument twist - can provide us a total DoT damage of 900 damage per
minute or higher at level 38, when we get Chant of Flame.
<br><br>A very standard party twist once you pass into the 20's
is Anthem/Psalm of Warmth or Cooling/Chains. Chains is usually dropped in favor of Bellow
or something else when there is a snarer in the party. I still use a comparable twist at
43, with Celerity/Chant of Battle/Psalm. Yes, I'm still using the level 1 song
at level 43.
<br><br>One of the biggest twists you'll eventually use is
fear/snare. This will allow you to keep a mob running away from you slowly while
you beat on it's rear end with weapons. While it can take awhile to get the
technique down, and it's far from perfect, this will enhance your soloing
abilities almost as much as charm. Only advisable to use on blue cons.
<br><br>For
soloing, charm/selo's and some form of direct damage will be your staples.
Standard technique is to find 2 mobs of equalish level (2 HG's, 2 cyclopses,
etc.). You start Selo's, run up to the mobs, charm one of them, and then switch
to Selo's again as you run past the mob you didn't charm. When it agros you,
your pet will default to a guard mode and attack the second mob. You then
continue to use Selo's and back up away from combat. When charm breaks, you
immediately reapply charm and then restart Selo's. Don't try to charm twice in a
row if you're resisted, keep twisting Selo's immediately afterwards. Once you've
charmed a few times, start running in close and switching targets to see if you
can figure out which mob is going to win. When you've decided on your winner
(whether it be your original pet or the one you agroed), switch your charm
target to that one. Continue to Selo away and recharm (changing pets will often
force you to move constantly) until one is dead. You can then zone from the
second, use a direct damage/Selo's twist (Bellow at lower levels, Chant series
at higher levels) to finish it off, or go find another pet that will kill it off
for you. You can string together many kills in heavily populated giant areas
using the last method. As long as the mob is low enough level to get the song to
stick period, red and yellow mobs can be handled easily with this method. Choon
and Froon, the level 30 cyclopses in West Karana, are a fantastic training
ground for this song once you get it at 27. The only downside is that there is
little room for error. You will die if you lag out, and you will die if you get
caught too many times, as most mobs you'll do this with stun horrendously.
<br><br>Play with twists. Don't be shy to try new combinations,
and experiment to see what stacks with what. A complete knowledge of your
song's abilities is crucial.
<br><br><b>Conclusion</b>
<br>So what do bards do with this broad range of skills?
Anything that is needed. If your group is short on tanks, wade in there
with the weapons and the heavy taunt songs like Chain. No enchanter? Make
crowd control your duty. Snare if you don’t have a druid or ranger around,
and do some DoT if you’re caster light. Lots of tanks in the party, make
sure you keep those attack speed, strength and stamina songs in there.
Change your songs as the combat changes, don’t just stick with the same
3 songs you started with. While your party might not be aware of what you’re
doing when you’re there, they’ll sure be aware of you when you’re gone.
I try to play the jack of all trades thing up as much as I can, as it’s
our strength, both in combat and role-play. I learn as many languages as
I can, I try to use blunt, piercing and slashing weapons.
<br><br>Being a bard is more fun than I ever thought it
could be, but it’s not a class for everyone. I stress all those who want
to play them, stick with it for awhile and begin to get a taste of the
different things we can do. At very least, it will give you an appreciation
for what that bard in the corner of the room is doing.
