<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">Feedback is good. This threads on the various forums are getting big, but I'll try to address what I can. I've started this thread in order to try to keep track of at least my involvment in this topic.
<br />

<br />
Personally, I'm hoping to see a different solution than the one currently on test because I'm not sure that particular fix is truly able to prevent PBAE kiting in the first place. It seemed like it would, but as someone else noticed there might be a way to play with the timing to do it anyways. Even so, I expect the current code on test will probably go to live servers because we're already locking things down for the Omens release to try to make sure things are as stable as possible. Nothing says we can't change it later if &amp; when we decide there is an alternative that is healthier for the game however, and this is where the feedback comes in. We just want to solve what we consider to be a problem with the game.
<br />

<br />

<br />
So let me go down the various threads I'm aware of and try to categorize main points people have made.
<br />

<br />
---------------
<br />

<br />
* First and foremost, why did this even come up when there are the top 10 issues lists? This is a very appropriate question. For a long time now we have been aware of PBAE being a problem we wanted to have fixed, but we hadn't yet thought of a good way to do it. Over time, conversations occurred about this and many other game balance topics, and we realized what be a good solution to this specific problem that wouldn't be too hard to implement. It's not like we scheduled a meeting on this - the topic has come up over and over again for a long time now with no solutions presenting themselves until recently. The fix was all code based, and a programmer had some free time one afternoon and was asked to implement the change. Most of the top 10 issues are more design issues than code issues, and as such require the design team to work on them. Sometimes we realize we can fix a problem with a few lines of code in just the right place though, and this is one of those things.
<br />

<br />
--
<br />

<br />
* This change is specific to the PBAE songs that bards can memorize and cast with a gem, and should not be affecting anything else.
<br />

<br />
--
<br />

<br />
* The 10 mob limit suggestions - The HoH fix involved a fairly time consuming script addition to the NPCs in the zone and I don't expect anyone to choose to do that over a global fix.
<br />

<br />
--
<br />

<br />
* Adding special NPCs or modifying NPCs to make PBAE kiting difficult/impossible. The notion of adding zone specific NPCs to complicate bard kiting is something I don't believe the design guys will want to do (mostly due to time constraints and the fact a code solution is probably as good or better). On the same note, any changes that would require design team to modify the inventory or spell capability is of NPCs in general is unlikely to happen due to the sheer number of NPCs in the game that would need to be edited. Moreover, this has the risk of affecting other classes. We'd like this fix to be as targeted on the problem as possible with a minimum of side effects. Also, adding NPCs to all the zones isn't a practical one for us due to the time involved. This particular idea, while it may sound simple, is quite a hassle for the designers. All these issues point us in the direction of modifying the specific spell behaviors directly since it is a global solution.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
If I overheard the conversations correctly, I believe Rytan did some calculations about the DPS potential of a bard using PBAE it was a pretty amazing and substantial amount of DPS that a bard can produce. I will try to get Rytan to give me the specifics on this but I'm sure someone could do that math before I talk him into stepping aside from the crunch time tasks he's in right now. Basically, the DPS that these songs can produce far exceeds every other class's DPS ability by a *lot*. It's out of whack and has to be fixed.
<br />

<br />
--
<br />

<br />
* As I said originally, this does not include all PBAE songs. It only includes ones that do damage. Yes this does mean most of the PBAE songs. &quot;Most&quot; is not the same as &quot;All&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
--
<br />

<br />
* The server side lag due to PBAE kiting *is* substantial and *does* affect other players. I happen to be the exact person who knows exactly what I'm talking about here because I am the person who 1) helped write the new pathing system, and 2) wrote the new collision system, and 3) have spent literally weeks running server profiling tools testing server loads and identifying what causes server lag. It just so happens that running a bunch of NPCs around in a circle is bad for CPU server loads, and does affect everyone else that happens to be on the same hardware. This is server lag, not video lag. The server doesn't care how many corpses are sitting around stationary. But when the server is asked to run path finder code on dozens of NPCs as they do full collision math as they run over the zone geometry, the server slows down and everyone in the zone &amp; other zones on the box is affected. As a player you generally only notice tell lag or NPC warping, but it does affect gameplay in many ways. Minimizing server lag is an ongoing task for me and the other programmers, and when stuff like this hits the radar as being a problem it's a priority for us to fix it.
<br />

<br />
--
<br />

<br />
* It does seem reasonable to have the 54 slow scale up to the 62 MoM if this change stays in place. I'll forward this suggestion.
<br />

<br />
--
<br />

<br />
* Leaving the range of the song intact while nerfing the damage component is unfortunatly a lot more complicated than it sounds. The damage is a dot, which means it's a buff, and spells only leave one buff on a target. Not having the dot component means anything else that was on the buff would have to go away also. We'd have to make some fairly deep changes to the spell system to support this kind of change. 
<br />

<br />
--
<br />

<br />
* The extended notes related comments are pretty much off topic - that AA was always intended only to work with beneficial spells. 
<br />

<br />
-- 
<br />

<br />
* Making mob movement more random, or doing other similar changes to the movement code is a possible alternative to this change. But not really likely due to the complexity of the pathing system in general. It's a possibility though.
<br />

<br />
--
<br />

<br />
* The fact is, bards can solo just fine without PBAE kiting. Personally, I'd like to see all classes have the ability to solo at some productive level that generates slightly less experience than grouping - but that's just my opinion. I think being able to solo is an important part of the game because not everyone can commit the time to a group every time they want to log in for a random amount of time. This change has nothing to do with any other classes ability (or lack of ability) to solo. 
<br />

<br />
--
<br />

<br />
* Call it a nerf if you want, but being able to kill 30+ NPCs at a time is flat out broken and is going to be fixed. It is plainly obvious that this is unhealthy for the game, and we are going to fix it. 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
------------
<br />

<br />

<br />
Keep in mind I'm just a programmer here, and I don't speak for the design team, but I'm trying to help make sure that the solution to the problem we have decided to fix is the best of the available options. I'd rather just see the system behave in a way that is fun and not exploitable. 
<br />

<br />
My current favorite solution to this problem is to add a new component to the PBAE line that would give the NPC a random chance to have the ability to summon the person who landed the DOT on it that granted this ability (ie the bard). Seems like if we did this, the spells could be left largely intact and it would stop PBAE from being the problem it is. And bards wouldn't ever have a reason to stand still (I don't like that part either)
<br />

<br />
If you have other suggestions that are different from the ones proposed above, please let me know. I'll try my best to keep up with this thread and to forward useful comments to the right people.

I'm not following it too closely, but from what I can gather they basically nerfed AE range down to melee range.  This means that while I can't AE kite, I also can't even slow all the mobs in a Ssra mines AE group anymore.  In this context, it is a nerf due to the fact that it was a poorly thought out fix that makes most PBAE spells fairly useless at this point.  The very least they could do is make the songs full range if you aren't moving when the song finishes casting, but I haven't read anything on that.</span></td>

Not sure if this would even help, just an idea I was thinking about.  I kind of liked the idea too about changing it to a DD instead of a DoT, but looking at what was said sounds like that would remove the effect as well?  Though what about spells that have an innitial damage and then a DoT or a lasting effect after a DD like the Druid root line that keeps a mob rooted but also does a DD when cast.</span></td>

<br />

<br />
I have posted many times in the past about the complete idiots doing auto kites....and this is the result.  NO one doing manual area kites has brought this crap onto our class. Nice freaking job you few knobs have done.
<br />

<br />
SONY, fix auto circle and 99.9 of your problem disappears.  None of these gimps can even manual kite 3 mobs chasing them...
<br />

<br />
AT 65 this is not overpowered, if you think it is, you need to find a new job.  HOH was nerfed to balance, leave it out of this.  Last night I did 3aa in HoH over almost 2 hours...was the only one in the zone.  Who got hurt?  Well I could have made 4aa in a group, but then again we choose to do what we want to depending on the night.
<br />

<br />
Do nothing to area songs....the fix is in the movement of these oportunistic Assholes who run a circle in auto and click a few buttons for a half hour.
<br />

<br />
Just code no auto run plus turns, just plain auto run.
<br />

<br />
or Turn quicker so that at no speed can you get the circle big enough to not get your a$ pounded.  There done.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I have to go with Sadiki on this.  Just received my new slow song and now it's nerfed!  Drop the damage the song does so it's not effected.  Every 'fix' implemented has some undesired effect we end up living with...sometimes permanently.
<br />

<br />
Personally I don't care about removing our ability to AE kite, but you've now created a new problem for those of us NOT AE kiting.  Having that AE slow song made me more useful in my group.  I challenge you to fix this new problem you've just created.  
<br />

<br />
The frustration SOE creates with these patches is, I believe, much more extensive than you realize.  At the very least, you could post an anticipated 'fix' and read the comments regarding the plan.  This way you might discover an undesired result and re-think the method.
<br />

<br />
It is going to be very difficult to jump into EQ2 knowing these things will still happen.  Repeatedly SOE has 'fixed' class problems only to create new ones and then refuse to remedy their new creation.  I can only hope the dev's will start following the problems through to the end.  It would be greatly appreciated.
<br />

Its the PL monkeys who caused the problem, the level 48 folks making a level a kite, the newbs AEing LoY for hours, or doing Freeport, the people PLing an alt or a group and charging plat for it...Those folks know what they are doing already. Yeah they use autocircle but guess what, remove it and they will still be out there, macroing the same dealie, after it takes them 5 minutes to set the interval. You will not stop the hardcore players, but will encourage folks to cheat this game even more when they see it can still be done.

However I will suggest that singing PBAE songs roots you, that sounds better than giving NPC's a chance to summon you. It just a sounds a little more roleplaying-ish. Like saying &quot;So-and-so starts to jam, viberating the grounds around him&quot;, or something to that degree.

I have posted many times in the past about the complete idiots doing auto kites....and this is the result. NO one doing manual area kites has brought this crap onto our class. Nice freaking job you few knobs have done.

This isn't the point at all. Its AoE people PERIOD. Look at what he said. Running 30 mobs in a circle is hard on the servers and cause lag all over when they do it. Whether you are Auto or Manual you are still running mobs in a circle. This will also be with Chant kiting. Swarm kiting. No matter how you look at it a Bard runs mobs in circles when ther are Kiting. 
<br />
I use Auto circle Sure its there why not. I also Swarm Kite and Chant kite. I don't just Auto 100% of the time. It is rather boring so i like to mix it up. 
<br />

<br />
I have a better solution here. Why don't all us bards come togther and at a set date and a set time go out and pull a zone all over on every server. no zone be left unpulled. Lets just bring down the d*mn servers. Show them we won't take this lightly. If there Servers can't handle a few bards running mobs in circles Let see how they like ALL bard everywhere running them in circles. </span></td>

Then at least it would be a shift in abilities and not a complete removal of the ability to kill multiple mobs at once.  Many bards play for their ability to solo, and for the fact that they have more than one way to effectively solo.  Wizard and Druid AE songs have traditionally been weaker if used against a single mob but better overall when used against multiple, why couldn't bard songs be adjusted to be similar?  </span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>This saddens me alot. I get 20 minutes to an hour to play most days. I can not find a group that quickly and be productive only to leave them a few pulls later. SO I solo. AoE is the most non-mindnumbing way to do it. Yes I die when I get a lag but that is the choice I make. If they do do this it will seriously hamper my soling ability. 
<br />

<br />
This is not the last straw for me but it is the next to last straw. 
<br />

<br />
I believe the 10 mob limit on the damage portion of the song would rock. this way you can still get some xp without causing so much server lag. 
<br />
If they do do this Something better happen to raise our effective solo techniques in other areas because Other clases can kill more than 10 mobs in the 25+ minutes it takes to do a 10 mob AoE kite. 
<br />

<br />
THe sowed mobs would screw other classes. Same with somoning mobs. But a chance to self slow when using these songs is pretty cool too I guess tho I wouldn't like it at all.

Well I beter not go to further into this or it will turn into a rant.

I think this change is rather pathetic considering how long AE kiting has been in the game. The only reason I started playing a bard is because server population is so far down finding a group at the time I play is hard.(I play on Sullon Zek) But once this change comes I can thank sony for making it really easy for me to delete my character and never think of playing one of there games again.

<br />

<br />
Find me one.
<br />

<br />
They aren't there.  I have tried game after game and none of them offer the depth of gameplay that EQ does.  All of the games that are touted as &quot;next generation&quot; are only next generation in graphics.  Graphically EQ stinks, but as far as a gaming aspect it is still pretty much the Gold standard.
<br />

<br />
Asherons Call, Earth and Beyond, Star Wars Galaxies, Horizons, City of Heroes.  I played all of these games, and none of them offers the same game play depth that Everquest does.  All of them tried to change EQ standards in various ways.  Tired of Mana and Resting for Health, City of Heroes has all your skills on recharge timers.  Don't like the Bazaar and twinks, try Horizons out for size, just hope you got in on the ground level and power gamed to the top so you can control all the market.  EnB anybody, oops EA dumped that game, not to mention all the fun of WH h*ll and Job Terminals.  Star Wars Galaxies is not even worth mentioning as it sucked all the fun out of gaming entirely.
<br />

<br />
All these games changed from EQ, but none of it worked to create the same sort of magic feeling.  That is really a shame too.  So saying there is always another game out there that will fill your gaming needs is not always true.  Some games came close for me, but all of them always left something to be desired.</span></td>
