<b>Dragon Steaks - </b>2/6/02 1:00:42 PM<br>~ <b>Naito</b><blockquote>If this song keeps you fed, then it should cut down (eliminate) the actual use of stat foods.  So those rare stat foods, like Dragon Steaks, or whatever, should last a lot longer.  And given the difficulty in getting fresh dragon meat (without having it charred or chopped into hamburger), this sounds like a good thing.  Again, a rare and extreme case, but hey, it happens.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>strings issue - </b>1/16/02 9:30:06 PM<br>~ <b>Kylos</b><blockquote>I was getting the &quot;you are hungry&quot; message while singing the song (not using strings).  Before, I'd never gotten it, but I'd always used a lute (used to song to max out strings skill, heh).  Maybe it refreshes drink while sung, and both while played on a lute?</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>An understanding of hunger and SOng of Sustenance - </b>12/25/01 3:21:27 AM<br>~ <b>Tenamin</b><blockquote>Ok I had a lot of time to play with this the other day while on three corpse runs through the Nexus and from what I saw here is how it works.<br><br>There are 3 levels to each category of food and thirst.<br>Category 1: you have more than 2 items of the appropriate comestible--this is our normal stat and you get no message.<br>Category 2: you have only one of the item you need to eat.--This is when it starts to send you the &quot;you are low on food/drink&quot; message.<br>Category 3: you are totally out of the comestibles,--This is when the game starts to tell you &quot;You are hungry/You are Thirsty&quot; <br><br>What this song seems to do is lower your need one level.  So if you have one food and no Water, you would normally see&quot;You are thirsty and you are low on food&quot; (or something of that type)  With the song all you would get is &quot;you are thirsty&quot; which is, in my estimation, just a misprint for a lowering of you need state.<br><br>Hope this helps and does not confuse, if it does confuse post on the boards and I will try to notice and explain more.<br><br>Tenamin 21singer on Firiona Vie</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b> - </b>12/18/01 2:19:04 PM<br>~ <b></b><blockquote>I believe this song to also be broken, because I have, on several occasions, still gotten hungry/thirsty messages while playing only this song.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>This song is useless!!!! - </b>12/17/01 10:42:37 PM<br>~ <b>Chrome Slayer</b><blockquote>Ok I haven't played this song yet myself but from what I read it has no practical need. For all those who keep saying its great for a caster out of food and can't med due to hunger our level 3 song Jaxon's Jig of Vigor will do the same thing. The caster can't med because his sta bar is empty refill that and he can med again. Now if you didnt get that hunger/thirsty spam while you played it might have some value. But if you run out of food or on a corpse run and you lose your sta bar entirely play jig it is more useful in those cases.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Timing confirmed, plus small silly question... - </b>12/17/01 2:38:00 PM<br>~ <b>Aeryon</b><blockquote>I timed this one just now, and it does indeed last 1.5 minutes. <br><br>I'm wondering about one thing though: if this is a group song, why does it have a yellow spell-icon? Or is Verant just too lazy to make us one of those with a nice purple background? ;)<br><br>Greetz,<br><br>Aeryon,<br>52 Minstrel on Brell,<br>Honourary Vah Shir Troubadour.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b> - </b>12/14/01 11:16:31 PM<br>~ <b>Samrith 60 woodelf bard</b><blockquote>I decided to use this song tonight as i sat waiting to raid chardok. <br><br>I am just really sick of my food disappearing. So i figured well if i am just sitting here doing nothing i may as well play this song so i don't waste food. That is the only reason i would ever play this song. when raiding in that boring down time!<br></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Near useless - </b>12/14/01 6:32:20 AM<br>~ <b>Ell</b><blockquote>This song could be much better if it gave stat buff food and drink that increases from snack to feast at level 60... too bad it's not like that :(</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>More info... - </b>12/14/01 2:47:14 AM<br>~ <b>Kocho Divah</b><blockquote>Okay, just used this song tonight on a CR. While waiting for the rez, I played the song without string, so definitely string is not required. It lasted 1.5 minutes, which is nice. But its not an AE song, if you're not grouped, nearby players *won't* benefit. At first, the 41 target message in SpEff.dat file threw me off. I'll delete that off the restrictions when I get a chance.<br><br>However, in a bit, the &quot;You are thirsty/hungry&quot; spam started, added to the &quot;You are sustained&quot; message over and over. :( Hope they fix that someday. But it might have its uses if someone is suffering from starvation/dehydration it might help them regain mana, stamina, etc... until they get food.<br><br>However, like all the new Luclin songs that I have tested, it doesn't work in the planes. I tried it in Fear tonight, and got the message &quot;This spell does not work on this plane.&quot;</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Spam - </b>12/13/01 3:51:34 PM<br>~ <b>Espio</b><blockquote>This song creates more spam then the &quot;You are hungry, you are thirsty, you are out of food and drink&quot; does, especially as it gives you one line per party member (or at least was the last time I tried it).  While yes, you could just hit it once every 3 minutes or so, I'd rather just deal with the hungry spam.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>HUH? - </b>12/13/01 8:11:59 AM<br>~ <b>Mameluke</b><blockquote>So let em get this straight somebody in the grp is hungry and thirsty and u fire this up and they are hungray and thirsty no more........For 1 minute and 30 seconds?><br>What is this?<br>I am gonna keep a slot taken with this song just to keep the ppl fed well that makes sense.<br>Easier to trade food with a group member that has more. I fu have a shaman cleric magician or druid (a group will have at least one of these) then they can summon u some food and it does not cost that much mana. Only use is for rezzes.....which is not a huge issue anyway. U wait in a safe spot while cleric rezzes u. When u are back ya corpse had food on it so no worries. All in all not a very useful song at all. Bah new bard songs except the enw selo suck :(</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b> - </b>12/12/01 11:39:26 PM<br>~ <b></b><blockquote>well it isn't completely useless, a caster is out of mana and they no longer regen mana you can ding this let them med up for fight or for them to get enough to gate to a town or something and buy some.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>41 target - </b>12/12/01 3:37:02 PM<br>~ <b>Elty</b><blockquote>apparently, all AE spells end up with this new 41 target thing. thats apparently is special coding design for the new skill: Mass Group Buff which turn normal group buff into AE buff. It is impossible for bard to have AE spells besides the last 3(which is special design to use as AE). Think about Shield of Song + Psalm of Warmth + Verse of Victory + whatever in your local orc camp to a group of newbie. bard will be too good to PL otehr with these!</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>String Not Required - </b>12/12/01 12:44:07 PM<br>~ <b>Kocho Divah</b><blockquote>I just updated the info here, and String is *not* required. Whew, on corpse runs you might not have your lute.<br><br>I got my info from CastersRealm, and it was wrong.<br><br>However, the SpDat.eff file says it has a 41 target limit. Has anyone confirmed if this is one of those AE songs? Also, it says that it lasts for 15 ticks, (1 minute 30 seconds), can anyone confirm?</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>String Required? :( - </b>12/12/01 9:12:36 AM<br>~ <b>Aranel</b><blockquote>This song *could* be useful when waiting for rezz, especially those long CR's on PoF etc.  But if it requires string, that shoots that one good use out of the water.<br><br>Aranel</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
