<h4>It's All About the Songs </h4>
by Kieni Hopebringer
<br><br> 
Your group is dying. It’s just a matter of 
time. The healer is out of mana, the 
enchanter is being swarmed, and the tanks 
have too many mobs to handle. You’re 
getting desperate. Everyone is doing their 
best but it’s too much to handle, and if 
something doesn’t change soon, you’re all 
making a run for the zone after you lose the 
tanks. You’ve probably been there a couple 
times or maybe a couple hundred. It’s time 
for new tactics. Maybe the paladin can root 
a couple, or the druid can kite one if you’re 
outdoors or maybe the bard can change her 
tunes. 
<br><br>
In order to understand and appreciate the 
bard, you need to know how truly versatile 
the class is. In fact, bards can do so many 
things, it’s sometimes hard to know which 
things to do, which songs to play, and 
whether to use instruments or weapons. 
Few classes can turn the tide of battle as 
effectively as a well-played bard, because 
the bard is so versatile and so complex. 
Notice I didn’t say a bard is powerful. Bards 
are powerful in a very few situations, but the 
true power of a bard lies in her versatility 
and in her songs. The songs a bard plays 
will often change each time a person leaves 
or joins the group. This makes the bard the 
ultimate team player in Norrath, because she 
has to constantly ask the question "what 
does my group need me to do now?" While 
this is true for a few other classes, bards 
take it to the extreme. When a bard knows 
what is needed for a group, she then figures 
out which songs to play to draw out the 
group’s strengths while minizing its 
weaknesses. Bards generally never sit 
(why? we can regenerate mana, stamina and 
health very quickly even when standing). 
However, I guarantee you that if you’re 
playing with a good one, you’ll see them sit 
down occasionally to memorize a few new 
songs when your group goes from being 
tank-heavy to caster-heavy. Being this 
versatile requires a lot of work. 
<br><br>
If you’ve never played a bard, or never 
played one well ;), here’s the kinds of 
thoughts that are always going through the 
bardic noggin. Do I have the right songs 
loaded for crowd control? Should I be 
buffing the tanks? Hasting the tanks? What 
about healing? Do I add bardic health regen 
or just supply mana song for the healer and 
casters? What’s my job if we overpull? Do I 
need to lullaby or mezz? I could always kite 
one away from the group, but that means the 
rest of the group won’t be getting the benefit 
of my songs while I’m gone. Maybe I should 
just stop playing healing and play haste now, 
because we have to get this thing killed and 
if we don’t that tank is dead anyway. But 
then, maybe if I play mana, it will give that 
wizard just enough mana for one more nuke 
which will kill it quickly. And then there’s 
slowing and debuffing the targets… if I had 
been doing that, then we all wouldn’t have 
taken so much damage in the first place. 
Hmm, I wonder if I’ll be more effective 
playing with instruments now, since the 
improved buff to the tanks will result in more 
damage than my pathetic melee skills. But! 
If it’s a nasty caster, I should try 
interrupting it with bellow or pixie strike, or I 
could just be playing my magic resistance 
songs. 
<br><br>
Confused yet? Welcome to being a bard! (I 
hope you’re all not rushing back to your 
warriors now ;) As you can see, we have a 
lot of choices to make that are very 
dependent on the situation and not always 
clear. The terrible truth is that we can only 
reliably play about three songs at a time. 
Why is this terrible? Because every time we 
play one song, that’s one less other song we 
can’t play! How unfair! We have to tradeoff 
a song we’d love to play for a song we 
*must* play. If we’re doing crowd control, 
we can’t very effectively be replenishing 
mana with the 32nd song at the same time. 
Of course, all this changes as a bard 
progresses to higher levels and gets new 
songs. We start out thinking that we are 
going to melee everything through 60th 
level. Later on we realize, that our true 
power is in the songs we play. Even later, 
we learn that we are most effective playing 
the right songs at the right time. 
<br><br>
Herein lies the challenge and the attraction 
of being a bard. It’s a lot of thinking, a lot of 
dexterity and a lot of just plain guessing and 
learning. Over our years, we develop a feel 
for what works and what doesn’t. Being a 
bard is not a science. There is no one right 
answer for the songs to play. This is good 
news, because a young bard learns that it is 
an art and a challenge. This challenge 
comes with a price of hard work, but rewards 
us with a vast amount of abilities that no one 
other class has. If I want to beat an orc into 
submission, I’ll play a warrior. If I want to 
show you five different ways of killing that 
same orc, I’ll take the bard. :)
