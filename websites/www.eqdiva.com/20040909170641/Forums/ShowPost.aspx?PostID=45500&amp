				<td colspan="2"><span>Posting this as a rant on just things in EQ that bug me(players), mostly pet peeves that you probably can't identify with<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-4.gif" border="0" alt="Tongue out" hspace="2" />
<br />

<br />
1) People that say &quot;Shiz&quot;, &quot;kewl&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;thx&quot; etc. The not quite leet speak terms that somehow made the general vocabulary list of the large majority of sub 60 EQ folk. Don't see it much in groups at 65, but I see it all the time on alts. Im a bard and I spend the time to articulate ideas better than this! I HATE IT!!!! <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-12.gif" border="0" alt="Mad" hspace="2" />
<br />

<br />
2) People who don't watch their grammar! Why oh WHY must you type your garbage with no regard to whether or not its even mildly comprehensible or even assume people would think your the &quot;shiz&quot; when they can't even understand you!!!
<br />

<br />
3) People who use &quot;gay&quot; as a derogative term. Ok, homosexual people are different. Ok, they are a minority and history has a habit of persecuting the minority. But this is a GAME. All you see is a pixel by pixel representation of another person's roleplaying persona, regardless of whether or not the person is roleplaying they are not acting as they would in real life. People who try to belittle others using this are truly the lowest dregs of the gaming community. And above that they think they are &quot;kewl&quot; which makes me even more pissed off. Society sucks!!
<br />

<br />
4) People who don't pay attention. Your in my group, your purpose is to help the group complete whatever goal it is that initiated the creation of the group. Is it TOO hard to sit down, mem spirit of wolf and cast it on me? I asked you a hundred times over the last hour, I see you moving around casting nukes and what not, can you NOT just sow me?! And thats not it! Melees too, especially tanks, can be COMPLETELY clueless. YOU ARE OUT OF RANGE!!! Im getting beat on here, turn your head AWAY from the pr0n and move back in range, you unattentive bastard!
<br />

<br />
5) People with problems with constructive criticism. Ok, you made a mistake. Happens. Heres how you can fix it so it wont happen next time so just maybe you'll learn something from this. Why do you think I care if you have a lvl 65 character with 10 billion AAs and flagged for TimeZ?!!? I offered you constructive advice with no aim to patronize or condescend. Your calling me names and making an a$ out of yourself sure makes you seem a whole lot more knowledgable and I was OBVIOUSLY out of line when I tried to, god forbid, HELP you!!
<br />

<br />
6) People who inadvertantly(or not) grief others through training, KSing, etc with no apology. There ARE other people playing this game! You, believe it or not, are NOT the only people out there. We are not computer controlled non-thinking non-feeling blocks of wood running around for your enjoyment! Is it so HARD to be CIVIL now and then?!? I can only assume you were so poorly treated or so exponentially SPOILED that you just no longer give a crap what other people feel. These are the only people I truly wish would just die and leave this world to people who actually have positive contributions.
<br />

<br />
7) People who become leaders of the group and are continuously afk or just plain dont pay attention. This is one of the most aggravating thing EVER. You have a responsibility to your group when you are leader, you need to be attentive to the management of your group including actively inviting new members. You CANT invite people when your AFK!!!! If your going AFK give leadership to someone else or you just MIGHT comeback to find yourself without a group. Also, if your leader and are not AFK, PLEASE invite people within the next HOUR. Its highly discurteous to others when you force them to wait because your dumb butt can't find the invite button or you just dont pay attention to your group screaming at you to INVITE.
<br />

<br />
8) People who leave the group for another zone but don't disband. Your leaving the group, fine. Take care. Have fun. See you later. Now DISBAND!!! Don't go sitting AFK in PoK while your group is in the middle of nowhere TRYING to invite another player!
<br />

<br />
9) People that beg. Ok fine, theres beggars in every town. But find the DECENCY to do it WITHOUT your guild tag showing!! I feel sorry for the guilds that have chronic beggars sending tells to anyone and everyone in PoK. I don't give to beggars, not in real life and sure as h*ll not in a game. Donate to charity, fine. Do it all the time. Good causes certainly beat feeding your LAZY a$!! And this isn't even an issue with generosity, I've given plenty of things to people, but they DIDNT beg for it!
<br />

<br />
10) Random invites. I don't know who you are. I didn't even see you until that &quot;Soandso has invited you to group&quot; message. Why do you think I will accept?! And for the love of GOD, if I decline once, REPEATEDLY inviting me over and over for the next 5 minutes will NOT change my mind!! /ignore.
<br />

<br />
11) Greed. So you aren't allowed to roll for an item for an ALT when people in the group need it, you accept that, albeit I can see you fuming behind the pixelized exterior. WHAT makes you THINK that the person that won owes you ANYTHING?!!? I won the flute for myself, WHAT makes you think I suddenly OWE you my old flute for your ALT?!?! Are you THAT greedy that you go make an ALT every time you see an item drop just so you can roll on an item?!?
<br />

<br />
This is all I can think of for now. I know for a fact theres more that make me angry. Feel free to post pet peeves here, I certainly felt a little better after that.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Pessism... optimism. I for one found a cure to most of the complaints that you have. I  am not the type of person to tolerate that level of stupidity so I make changes so I don't have to. 
<br />

<br />
#1 .. your grouping with strangers of various ages and intellects try being a little more selective. Same as in your real life you don't hang out for hours with just anyone you choose your friends and associates and if someone drives you nuts... well don't hang out with them. 
<br />
The way I handled this is I joined a family guild with high aspirations and I group exclusively with guildies. I do not go LFG.. I make a group as the leader therefore I am responsible and not leaving it in the hands of the less intelligent and capable or willing. I make a group of my guildies and friends lists.. I do not group with strangers unless they come attached to someone I trust. And then I hold that person fully responsible for any stupidity that may erupt from the unknown person. 
<br />

<br />
#2 Regarding the lame kid speak, well .. lame kid speak yup ever listen to a group of 13 year olds chatter at each other? Why would you start speaking to them in the same way in RL? Why do you consider doing it here and why does it bother you more here than there? .. easy because we can not tune them out quite as easily in game without putting them on straight ignore which is an extremists solution. So.. I speak to people that use teenybopper speak in complete sentances conducting myself as an adult and I don't even try to decipher their silliness if its not readily understandable I ask them to repeat themselves in a more mature fashion. 
<br />

<br />
#3 Don't let the term gay get to you, My middle name was Gay initially, my mother was a little odd. Gay means happy and joyful.. or the alternative in the last 30 years to also mean one that is of an alternative lifestyle. It also is used as a referance to something that is  strange or odd. Yep.. homosexuality is a little odd it is not the Norm but then again who's defining norm anymore? Typically the people I've met in life that are considered Normal I am bored to tears by. I'm of a bisexual or a non oriented sexual orientation you could say, I find nothing offensive in either sex and am equally intrigued by the intellect and attractiveness of both genders. I'm married to a wonderful man but that does not change the fact that I am not offended or repulsed by either lifestyle. If those that are 'gay' are not offended by the alternative uses of the word either should the people who are not 'gay'.
<br />

#4 Constructive criticism.. I get really annoyed when people give me constructive criticism because their wrong often. I just ignore them though. I have a 65 bard with over 200 aa and I have played for 5 years and I did spend years testing computer programs and have a d*mn good handle on the game and when some snot nose upstart tries to tell me how to play I ignore them unless their polite and kind and know how to have a conversation not a debate or insult.
<br />
It really irritates me when someone tries to critisize me and They consider it constructive critism but to all others eyes it sounds like their bitching and complaining and throwing in some of their suggestion of how to fix your stupidity. Those constructive critisizers that have no tact are the ones removed from my groups.. ( bonus as group leader you have control of the disband button use it ) 
<br />
.. ... 
<br />
Beggers? .. selective hearing anyone asking me for anything I treat them like their a telemarketer .. sorry dont' have time /hangs up
<br />
Who cares what guild their in.. I never even notice I don't look at them any closer than I do a salesperson on the phone. 
<br />

Your getting yourself all keyed up over things that are insignificant and are just as present in RL as they are game, you need to be more selective about what you pay attention to and what you strategically ignore.  </span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Ok, I'm trying not to flame, but your post gets me a little worked up.  The majority of things you've listed as being your pet peeves are just things that people say or slang that people use.  I'm not a &quot;dewd&quot; by a long shot, but sometimes it seems so formal so say &quot;Thanks.&quot;  when I could get by with something like &quot;thx~&quot; and also, do you get upset when people don't capitalize their sentences and use proper punctuation at the end?  This isn't English class.  I can understand getting a little upset about people who just consistently spell most words wrong, but as long as you understand what they're saying, why get so worked up about it?
<br />

<br />
As to the comment about people not apologizing for trains, the last time I apologized for making a train I was met with such hate.  I don't see that I need to apologize for getting aggro from mobs, I mean as a bard I do everything I can to try to fade it off before it gets to another person.  But still, part of the responsibility lies in those who tend to &quot;sit on the tracks.&quot;  Especially in zones like PoI (Plane of Innovation; just for you), where people just group at the zone out/in.  Trains happen, and not every class can do anything about it, in fact only about 3 or 4 can.  If people were more understanding about it, then apologizing would be appropriate.  But why should I apologize to someone who will just prove to me that they don't deserve an apology anyway?
<br />

<br />
I'm sorry, but I try to play my bard as a light-hearted type of person.  Complaining till the day's end about the little things doesn't make me happy or make me a fun person to be around.  Especially I would like to go back over the point about the phrases people use.  If you can't find yourself getting used to them, it's gotta be hard to log in.  I mean even in my guild chat are people who talk like that (not like dewds but use shortened words like &quot;u&quot; or &quot;ne&quot; )  It's everywhere, and it's part of being a community.  You don't seriously think everyone in RL talks with proper grammar or writes with proper spelling do you?  Certainly not, so why expect them to all type with proper grammar and spelling?  Sure &quot;they can go back over it&quot; but why should they when you know what they're talking about?
<br />

<br />
When you ask for sow, I'm assuming you say &quot;I would like spirit of the wolf cast on me, please.&quot;  Because saying &quot;SoW please.&quot; is just slang and is therefore inappropriate.  Even though if you said &quot;sow plz&quot; everyone would understand what you are saying, you have to put yourself above others by making it into a full complete sentence.  I'm not saying it's right to disregard grammar rules, but have some sense.  It's a waste of your time to type out something if everyone knows the abbreviation, and a waste of the caster's time to have to read the whole sentence.  Not everyone cares about making sure their grammar is up to your standards, and not everyone who reads it gets so upset about it because &quot;I can read it but that doesn't mean I have to put up with it.&quot;  And not everyone knows how to spell every word right.  Please be a little more understanding of those around you.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>For the most part, I couldn't give a crap about grammar or spelling from others.  Sentences that are extremely wrong and not thought out to any extent, however, tend to make my brain hurt.  Sure I type full sentences most of the time.  I do this when I have time to type fully.  When I'm twisting, or if I'm busy otherwise, then it's time for abbreviations.  omw, omg, brt, gtg, lol, etc, etc.  I can understand being a little annoyed with abbreviations and poor grammar, but what I can't understand is being angry enough to rant about it.  Relax, try to enjoy the game a little.  You pay for it, you spend your time at it; if it's only serving to make you angry, find something else to occupy the hours... simple...</span></td>

Grammatically speaking, I understand some people cannot type as well and I have seen some VERY blatant missuses of the variations of &quot;there, their, they're&quot; and such like that. I just ignore them however much it might irritate me but I sound it phonetically to see what they were thinking.

				<td colspan="2"><span>#4 Constructive criticism
<br />
Well it depends on how the message was sent in the first plave. If it was a tell a they say try this thats cool. Or if they ask in group why was i doing something this way they have seen a bard do it this way and it seemed to work ok. 
<br />
However if they are rude about it i usually give a quick respons saying thats the best way for me. Not gonna debate with them
<br />

<br />
As for abbreviations acronyms don't really bother me. However repeated use of leet or simi leet does get to me. I try to respond in full sentances but 9 times out of 10 it dosn't make a difference. So i usually keep quiet and twist.
<br />

<br />
Trains. Most the time its not that bad in most the zones i have been in, but when it happens I'v been known to derail it. (when its not mine.)  Or at least slow it down for a bit so zone can clear. If it is mine and there are people at entrance I am using Train social. How ever if some one repetedly trains me I note there name and guild and find one of the officers. A few times its been the players sister/brother/girlfriend playing and not doing to good. But there are a lot of times its like STFU some people just don't care about other people. to them i say eF u.
<br />

<br />
Grammer dosn't really get me (probally cause both my grammer and spelling blow) However if I don't understand what there saying I let em know.

U - Unless you're Prince, you don't have the right to shorten &quot;you&quot; to &quot;u.&quot; You save two keystrokes (from keys that are close to one another) and end up looking like an idiot. So, unless you're a grammy-award winning, multi-platinum musical genius who writes, sings, produces, and plays bass, guitar, drums, and the piano, you don't have the right to use &quot;U&quot; in a sentence... or wear purple velvet in public, for that matter. In fact, if you ever say &quot;u&quot; instead of &quot;you,&quot; I immediately imagine you in a purple velvet leisure suit with the butt cut out of it. Then I immediately wretch. Then I put you on my ignore list, because if you're that d*mn lazy, I probably don't want you in my group. Oh, god, it just pains SO MUCH to type that Y and that O, doesn't it? I bet with all that arthritis or lupus or lyme disease or whatever it is that prevents you from hitting the 'y' key you're probably going to take ten minutes to hit your complete-heal key, huh?
<br />

<br />
Thx - I assume if you're telling me &quot;thx&quot; it's because I just did you a favor. Maybe I dragged your sorry naked a$ back to your body with Selo's and Lyssa's. Or maybe I just tracked down an epic named mob for you. In any case, whatever I did for you is worth the extra 2 seconds it's going to take you to type &quot;thanks&quot; rather than &quot;thx.&quot; Hmmm... my time and energy, your three keystrokes. Seems a fair trade to me. Besides, THX doesn't even STAND for &quot;thanks.&quot; It doesn't stand for anything, unless you're George Lucas. I'm not asking for a platinum donation or your first born or something. All I ask is that if I put my time and energy out to do you a favor, the least you can do is type out the entire d*mn word &quot;thanks.&quot; Hey, maybe if you really like me I might get a &quot;thank you.&quot; Jeeze, those extra six keystrokes must have given you carpal tunnel, huh?
<br />

<br />
On that note, let me conclude with this:
<br />

<br />
&quot;Recruiting is closed unless you are a totaly hotshit cleric or bard who doesn't feel the need to shorten words to single letters or replace words with numbers - or a combination of both.&quot;

Please never forget that EQ is played all over the world, not just by native speakers of English. I get really worked up when someone in game tells me that my spelling or grammar is bad (Don't use 'd00d speak'). Why? Because I'm from the Netherlands, my native language is Dutch, I speak French and English, understand Italian, Spanish and German. So say about 6 languages I comprehend, though not perfectly. Sorry that my grammar isn't perfect, but hey, it's not like I've been using this language all my life, right?

I find it strange that many foreigners are so much better with our own language.

<br />

<br />
12) This ones a little weird<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-4.gif" border="0" alt="Tongue out" hspace="2" />, I hate being so nice. Sometimes I wish I could just say no(or just keep quiet like most other people) to someone who needs help. I'd have more time to do stuff for me, but instead everytime a guildy asks for help with this or that I find myself running over right away. Altruism sucks, even though it is generally considered a good trait. People like me are easily abused by those with lesser morals...
<br />

<br />
13) People who don't think for themselves! I don't care if its laziness on their part or just plain ignorance, theres no reason for not using your noggin sometimes!
<br />

<br />
14) People who lack gratitude and are just rude in general. I give away stuff I farm frequently, usually things I don't wanna waste the time to bazaar, things like the named drops in Dulak. So I take them to a newbie zone like Gfay and auction them out for free. I once got a SK that came by and said &quot;Give me the d*mn thing&quot; I was shocked. How can someone be THIS rude when I am doing something nice for people?
<br />

<br />
15) People that use poor logic. These people arrive at a conclusion that benefits themselves and will bend reason and logic to such far extremes as to defy understanding. &quot;The guild rules say no alts are allowed in any other guilds, but it also states that we are only allowed 1 alt in guild. Therefore since I have an alt in guild already I can have another alt in another guild.&quot; This was someone's actual reasoning. SAY WHAT?!
<br />

<br />
16) Along with poor logic, these same people lack the ability to admit being wrong and will defend their position with lies, threats, and vulgar language. I can't stand these people, they feel that even though their argument lacks substance and they have no evidence or proof of their case that they have undoubtedly in their mind 'pwned' you. 
<br />

<br />
In response to the above, its perfectly normal to play a game and be bugged by things you see. I feel irked by many things, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying the game. It adds flavor.
<br />

<br />
This is a rant forum, theres no point putting stuff you like in a rant forum so you only see things I don't like. That doesn't mean I'm a 24/7 pissed off bard running circles in PoK out of frustration. Besides, it'd be too long a list to name things I like.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>New items that bug me...(remember, things that bug one person does not mean it is annoying to everyone else, its a matter of opinion)
<br />

<br />
17) Other bards that go AFK in frequently traveled places and play brass AE songs for training. I see them all the time sitting in and around the main bank in PoK. It is so freaking annoying when your trying to bank and you keep getting &quot;Soandso tries to cast a spell on you, but you are protected.&quot; Its annoying to everyone. Its very inconsiderate.
<br />

<br />
18) Higher level players that ignore people. I say higher level people because thats usually who it is, not a stereotype but an observation. I play alts frequently in the 30s-40s and often I would ask people in camp for a clarity or some such before an adventure. I usually use say first, mentioning that I would be more than willing to compensate them for their time. If thats no good I'll send a gentle tell to someone of proper level, &quot;Could you cast a clarity on me? I'd be happy to donate.&quot; The usual response is being ignored, especially from the 65 crowd. I see them moving around, they are obviously at the keyboard and not AFK. It would take 2 seconds to reply with a simple, yes or no. I wouldn't have my feelings hurt if you don't want to cast clarity on me, but say something! Being ignored is worse than being denied.
<br />

<br />
19) People who link their twinked items every 5 seconds. These people also tend not to be as skillfull as the rest.Your equipment means diddly squat to me. I'd frankly be more happy with a poorly equiped character that didn't break mezz every pull or stand around chatting the whole time. I never feel the need to link anything, if I get asked, fine I'll send a tell to the person with the item. I guess I'm just a modest person.
<br />

<br />
20) People who zone wide chat when they are standing next to you. These people annoy the heck out of me. They keep shouting or /oocing their messages even though I'm standing right by them. Look, not everyone CARES about your business. Heck, I'm not sure I care and your talking to me! Use /say, huh?</span></td>

I'm a nice guy, I genuinely am.  But when I am in the game I am never sitting around looking for people to chat with.  I am either with my regular XP group where I am the puller and the sole cource of crowd control or I am on a guild raid where I am the raid leader and often involved with pulling.  In other words, I don't have time to spend participating in friendly conversation - I am busy.  When I am in game, I make a point of ALWAYS being busy.  Had a newcomer to our guild talk to me after a raid one night - concerned that I wasn't a &quot;people&quot; person because I wasn't responding in warm, friendly fashion to his tells during the raid.  I explained that 1) I was a bard, 2) I was leading the raid, and 3) I was pulling.  All three are normal and all 3 preclude coherent conversation.
<br />

<br />
Here are the facts of life when it comes to Steppy -- just so you understand that I really am NOT being rude:
<br />
First, I'm busy.  If I am not busy, I'm probably AFK.
<br />
Second, my bank space is precious.  I don't have any left over gear to give you.  My roommate and I have a third account just for our trader and if I stop using a piece of gear that is droppable, it is on the trader and it has a price attached.  Sorry.
<br />
Third, if I can answer your question in one or two quick sentences, I will.  If it takes a protracted conversation or you have a list of things to ask me, please ask in a serverwide or server chat channel for bards.  You will have a much better chance of getting your questions answered.
<br />

Oh, and I still catch myself calling things &quot;gay.&quot; It's not that I have anything against homosexuality, it's just an expression that was ingrained into my language as I was growing up.
