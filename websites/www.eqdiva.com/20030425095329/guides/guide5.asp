<h3>The Bard’s Guide To The Lake of Ill Omen</h3>

This page is geared primarily for the Bard Class, however if you are just looking for a place to hunt between the levels of 18 to 30, The Lake of Ill Omen is one of the best in the game.
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>How to Twist</STRONG>
<BR><BR>
This strategy will teach Bards how to solo from level 18 to level 30 in the lake of Ill Omen. 
The first thing any Bard should learn is how to do is twist songs. Twisting songs is the ability to play 3 (some times 4) songs and 
receive the benefit from those songs constantly. If you don't know how to twist songs please visit this page to learn. Once, you have 
twisting down you then want to learn how to twist songs while changing your instruments to match that respective song. For example, 
using a Horn (Brass instrument) for Denon's Disruptive Discord, a Lute (stringed instrument) for Hymn of Restoration and Chords of 
Dissonance. Keep in mind you must have the instrument in-hand when you see the song message in your chat box, NOT when you start the song.  Once you have learned the basics, practice, practice, practice. How well you twist songs will be the judging factor of how people think of you. 
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Ready for Battle</STRONG> <BR><BR>

The 3 combat songs you want to memorize and use are Denon's Disruptive Discord, Chords of Dissonance, and Hymn of restoration. You always want to keep Selo's memorized for those evacuation situations just in case something goes wrong or you pull something into the AoE of your songs. Once you have those memorized and hot keyed, then hotkey you’re off hand (Instrument) slot, and two inventory slots that you will keep your other two instruments in hand. This will allow you to keep 3 instruments visible (Drum, Lute, Horn) at all times to correspond to your songs. I know none of the 3 mentioned songs uses your drum but I keep it there so I can put the drum in hand and switch to another set of hotkeys (one that contains Selo's) and evac myself from a bad situation. The following is a small screen shot of what this should look like:
<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="images/imgGuide5Hotkeys.jpg" width="73" height="175"><br><br>
You can see from the screen shot above that you have all the necessary inventory slots (I have chosen 2 inventory slots and my two hand slots) and songs readily available to you.  As you can also see the top slots are for Melee, and the bottom slots are General Inventory slots.  I would recommend setting another hotkey macro up similar to this one.  However on the second one you want to put the opposite 2 inventory slots (use the 4 General Inventory slots on the left) on the bottom.  This will allow you to keep 2 instruments and 2 weap10:00 PM 3/26/2001ons readily available to you at all times.
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Where to fight</STRONG> 
<BR><BR>
After arriving in the Lake of Ill Omen from FV follow the Stream down until you find the opening to the lake. Follow the beach around to the left and find a nice spot for you away from the broken buildings. Another good spot is behind the runes; there you can scout your next pull while resting. At level 18 you have a wide variety to pull from, but what makes the Lake so appealing is the tigers! Why do you ask? Because Tigers don't stun! I have always said, "A stunned bard is just a real crappy tank". Since you are relying on your songs for all the damage you want to stay stunned as least often as possible. Once you see what it is you want to pull (tiger) use Selo's and pull it to the area you where resting at. DO NOT fight the mob in the open area; there are too many wanders. Use a 3rd person view from above so you can see your mob. Using this view will drastically reduce lag, since your computer has less to take in. It takes next to nothing for your computer to process the ground because it doesn't change, move, and will take up the greatest amount of room on your screen. Always remember [Bard + Lag = Death] easy as that. While fighting your mob go head and hit your auto attack and work on your hand-to-hand while twining your songs. Begin with DDD, then CoD, then Hymn. Don't worry if DDD is resisted, just continue with your twining and start your next song (which would be CoD). Do not try over and over again to get DDD to stick if it keeps being resisted because you are relying solely on your songs to do damage, which means you want CoD to stick. CoD is very rarely resisted at level 18 and will always do damage. 
<BR><BR>
Lets break this down. If you stack DDD, CoD and the mob, then you stack Hymn on yourself you are doing far more damage then the mob can do to you because it will miss quite often. When the tiger misses it is not doing any damage to you, and you are healing at 8 - 11pts. per tick because you are using your lute to sing Hymn. The entire time the tiger is missing you are still doing damage because your songs don't miss, and you’re healing yourself considerably! Between these songs and a green tiger that still gives experience I have often finished a fight with more health than I started. 
At level 20 you get Largo's Melodic Binding which is a very nice slowdown. Use this as you see fit while in the lake, if you pull a tiger and a stunning creature (Gob, Sarnak) you can play either Largo's or Hymn. Its up to you really to use your discretion on which one to use. It’s a two edged sword really, heal the damage with Hymn? Or prevent the damage with Largo's. I almost always go with Hymn, but there are specific circumstances that require Largo's. If I pull one or two creatures that stun I will run off and stop then start Largo's when I know they are almost in range. This does a number of things. First and most importantly it allows the creatures to get to you at the same time. Why is that important you ask? Well that whey if they are both stunning Mobs you only have to worry about one stun. They start attacking at the same time when they catch up to you, so their stuns will be at the same time. It also allows you to take a look at the situation and decide if this is something you want to get yourself into. If not then zone to clear the argo list (this is something I will talk about in just a minute). This strategy will start them both swinging at the same time and after Largo's is stacked on them both they will swing very slowly, 38% slower to be exact. There will be several occasions where both will miss with there stunning blow so that will allow you to continue to stack DoT upon DoT on them as well as heal your self. 
<BR><BR>
After level 23 there is no reason for you to stay at the runes on that side of the lake. It is time to move to the other side, closer to the Sarnak Castle. Continue the same strategy on that side of the lake just with Sarnak Recruits (stun) or Sabertooth Grims (do not stun). This strategy will take you to level 30 easy in the zone at which time you can stay, or move to Frontier Mts. and group for giants. 
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Mindful </STRONG>
<BR><BR>
Always keep in mind the argo status of each mob (other than that of a Tiger). If you have to run from a Sarnak or a Goblin it is better to zone than die. Don't think other wise just zone, or log. You have to clear the agro list of that beast. Let me explain why. Mobs in this zone wander everywhere, from one end of the zone to the next. Speaking from experience on this one: If you get on the argo list of a Goblin beside the runes and have to run it is very possible for us as Bards to outrun our pursuer. After sitting and healing I decided to go back (without clearing the argo list) and sit in the same spot I was before getting jumped by the Goblin. I healed up and fought two or three fights and was healing again when I noticed a Goblin coming at me from half way between the runes and the windmill. I sat sure of myself he wasn't coming to me because I was way to far away from him to argo him. Well the Goblin that argoed on me left, and every goblin he past on his way put me on there argo list, then every goblin that he past put me on there argo list.... etc. (this is very dangerous because of the stone buildings that are next to the Runes full of goblins) Well as soon as I step out to meet the goblin every other Gob in the area (from the stone buildings and from the yard area) came running at me. I was using 3rd person view so I could see behind me and saw that there was probably around 20 - 30 goblins chasing me. I out ran them all (as to not send a train to the zone where people where resting or AFK) and immediately camped and came back. I finally learned what was doing this after 3 or 4 times this happened. Trust me it is worth a few minutes of zoning to clear an argo list than it is to not clear it and have something fall from the sky on you, or literally run across the zone for you during, or just after a hard fight and die. Remember ALWAYS CLEAR THE ARGO LIST IN THE LAKE OF ILL OMEN.

There are several different techniques you can use in the lake, this is just one of them. My advice to any Bard is play around with your songs; see which ones work the best for you in any given situation. If you don't solo then this is not a problem for you. If you do solo then this information, and the information you get through experience can and will save your life. If you don't want to use Selo's for an evac then use Melanie's Mellifluous Motion and hope it teleports you far enough away to get Selo's up. It took me only once to learn not to use it near the water because we all know that we run faster than we swim, and there are a lot of high level nasties at the bottom when having to CR because we used Melanie's too close to the water to avoid death. These are all things you can and will learn on your own while learning to solo in the Lake of Ill Omen.
