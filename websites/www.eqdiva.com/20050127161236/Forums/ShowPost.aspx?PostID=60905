				<td colspan="2"><span>Did my first Vxed attempt the other nite, since i been more or less away from the game for about 6 months or so, and need to get flagged to join my guild again.
<br />

<br />
So . . . 
<br />

<br />
What exactly am I supposed to be doing in that event?
<br />

<br />
First impression, it seemed as though the enchanter charmed pet was doing between 50 and 75 percent of the total damage output of our group.  Not much need for me to sing any kinda haste or focus effect.
<br />

<br />
Great, so I thought gee these mobs are pretty low resistances, mezz always sticks it seems, maybe I can mezz an add if the chanter is busy, or mezz his pet when charm breaks, etc.  Only problem is that my mezz is about a 4 second cast, if I am really sharp targeting.  I can't count how many times the tank and cleric both died in less than four seconds.  Musta been four or five times at least we had two to four mobs  in camp, all mezzed, and everyone dead but me and the necro.
<br />

<br />
When we got to a named, it was decided to let the chanter pet tank the named, I presume thats the normal procedure?  Anyway the named ate the pet in about 5 seconds or less, then he ate the chanter, then the cleric, etc, etc.
<br />

<br />
I never felt so useless in my life as a bard.  What exactly am I doing in this event, anyway?
<br />

<br />
I mean, I could pull I suppose, but what for?  Even single mobs chewed our a**es.
<br />

<br />
Oh, and mana song?  The way the cleric was chain fast healing the tank on just normal mobs, i doubt very much that mana song made any more difference than haste did.
<br />

<br />
So, what the heck am I supposed to do in this event?</span></td>

<br />

<br />
Basically, our only use there is to pull and play CHA for the tank so DI fires...
<br />

<br />
Crowd Control isn't needed as a Chanter is garunteed to be there, and they don't need us to Mez their pet when Charm breaks since it will be Snared.  Our Haste and Overhaste songs are near pointless as the pet does all the real damage.  And Resists are not a real issue.  So we're left with pulling, basically.
<br />

<br />
Best thing to have in Vxed is a Necromancer.  Nothing worse than having the Cleric go down and every dieing except the Bard.  But with a Necro, you are back in business.</span></td>

He should also tell the group when snare fades so you can stop, break charm, mez, snare and recharm.  As far as what you should be doing --- Pull, pull, Pull.  I go pull as soon as the mob is under control.  Just keep your drum equipped, selo up, hos the next mob, preslow on the way back, mez and snare.  By that time the group should be finished with the last one.  Do your best to single.  A lot of stuff cant be lulled but they all can be mezzed and faded.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>I 've done a lot of Vxed trials, and while a charmed pet seems well, all i can say is not to use them for the reason you have experienced. If your groupmates are not geared decently the pet will rip through them as you experienced. I found it best to grab some friends, and hang out in Vxed and kill, take your time, but not too much time. Nameds in Vxed hit for about 1400? its been a while maybe 1600 I know they are hard and Knight Classes *paladins/Shadow Knights* have trouble tanking them if not geared well, and by well I mean Ele plane Knight classes had trouble tanking them when i did the trials.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Pets are too risky, 6 ppl, no enchanter, unless your friend is an enchanter then invite them but you're losing Dps, or you cant find anyone else, you provide haste and mez and mana regen, getting an enchanter in your group is causing a loss of Dps.
<br />

<br />

<br />
your role in Vxed is as it it anywhere else, Haste/Mez/Mana regen/ puller. 
<br />

<br />
Anytime I am in a trial/LDoN or group I'm puller and lead the pace and the success or failure.
<br />

Good Luck.</span></td>

<br />

<br />
There's no real reason to rush here, we stayed at the zonein for a while and killed there, after about 30 mobs we started proceeding to the Stonespiritist. I was pulling, except when we got to the room with Stonespiritist, we found it to be less painful to have the SK FD pull that room due to the casting snakes. Usually we only had 1 mob in camp, sometimes 2, at one hectic moment 4. Warrior tanked all the way thru, SK offtanked a bit when we had 4 in camp. We also killed the named pooka who dropped greaves for the cleric. You don't need to mess with charmed pets or suchlike, bring a good solid group that knows what they're doing and it should be easy. You don't have to kill any named to get the flag, just spawn the spiritist and get to her.
<br />

<br />
We even spawned her yesterday just doing exp at zonein and helped a few guildies to get their Vxed flag with selos+kazumis run up to the spiritist.</span></td>

Void tanking works fine on nameds, make sure noone else does anything but send the pet, hit deft and pray the tank is fast when you call it dropping. Nameds will be ~30% when it drops.
<br />

<br />
One tip, keep largos up if you dont trust your snarer. A kyv got away next to the spiritist and ran into the room, it was only half pulled so we had ~five mobs on us. The chanter died quickly. Some roots, lots of mezzes (and quite a few resisted :(), a rez, a dead mob, six tends and clicks later we were flagged and out<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Hi there!
<br />

<br />
I play both, bard and chanter (both KT flagged, both got Tipt and Vxed flag in under 5 attempts). I can assure you a SoVed charmed pet is the easiest way and most DPS you can have at a Trial (Tipt or Vxed) by millions of light years.
<br />

<br />
That being said, the chanter has to be not just good, impressive good. I have help flagged a good portion of my guild with my charmed AND SoVed companion, and quite a few times, specially if pick-up groups, they have sent tells during or at end saying they have never seen such pet control, to which I tell them:
<br />

<br />
<i>If the pet controls the master, the master is the pet.</i>
<br />

<br />
Here are some tips about pets and bard role in Trials.
<br />

<br />
MEZZ: chanter mez is 2.5 sec cast. Bard mez is 3.0 cast (as all songs are).
<br />

<br />
While CC might be less of an issue with a chanter in group and the mob being snared, when playing chanter I always welcome a bard mez while recharming. 
<br />

<br />
The reason being, sometimes Cleric just happen to land a biga$$ heal as charm breaks, guess who gets agro? Right. And even though the 1st thing I do is to recast TASH on the loose pet to avoid just that, or to keep agro when snarer lands the snare so that my half channeled Charm doesn&#180;t get OOR should be ex-pet be more interested about snarer, still cleric or nuker or Tank might end up with agro. So bard mez? Sure, I&#180;ll take it any day. Grants me the time I need to wait for snare while retashing and recharming. Specially, if I am the slower and mob is incoming.
<br />

<br />
PET: Have a designated snarer, in my case most times it has been a druid (here is when it comes handy to cast TASH, 1.0 sec cast spell on mob, so snarer is 90% of the times agro free when snare lands and can resume patch healing tank), sometimes has been a ranger.
<br />

<br />
I have a CHARM BROKE key to let snarer know I need snare ASAP, and I tell Snarer to make one to let me know snare landed again and was not resisted, if he doesn&#180;t have it or use it.
<br />

<br />
Place the mob slightly ahead of Tank, and have tank slightly ahead of group, and as chanter, keep enough distance. With charmed and SoVed pet, you kill them so fast, you always have room for recharming. One thing NOT to do is, take forever to pull, I stress the need to pull and make room for my charmed pet. If group wants to go get some named in Vxed that requires staying put at one place because of the lenghty pulls required, I will let the group know bad things will happen due to repops and lack of mobility (being in a corner, nowhere to go, etc). 
<br />

<br />
If after killing something the pet stays put at the point where mob died (instead of going to the designated guard point, as he was supposed to) I will reposition the mob slighty ahead of tank again and lets say, away from cleric?, and while doing so, will try to pass by it as close to wall and far away from it as possible should he break as I am passing him to reposition the mob (this is the only real time of danger for me. If mob is ahead of group, waiting to be pulled, I target that mob, send pet to it, pet moves forward. When at desired spot, I tell it to come back, and right away to guard. This avoids passing by pet if I don&#180;t have to).
<br />

<br />
Pet number 1 cause of wipes? Only if chanter sucks, and yes, I have died to pet on occasions. Everytime I had pet we made it to the Tipt named though, some we won, some we lost. I also remind the group periodically that should I die, to please ROOT pet (bard mez would be welcomed here as well).
<br />

<br />
I have had a 5 ghost pull (pathing is horrible, one will come forward, and there you have it, a 5 pull) tanked-mezzed by pet alone. All agroed pet, while giving me enough time to mez them one by one, ghosts are pretty gimp hitters, when compared to what is around.
<br />

<br />
Pally in group stunning pet helps with pet control? Sure do, but if they ask me at the beginning of the trail what do I need for pet control I always say, SNARE ASAP. And if bard in group, assisting with mez on loose pet will not hurt any either.
<br />

<br />
NAMEDs: Sending pet to tank named only works with Momma Cragbeast. Vxed Pooka named will indded tear the pet away, Tipt final boss kills pet in 3 or 4 secs.
<br />

<br />
Yes, sometimes there is a red con named popping at the right side camp in final room with flagging NPC.
<br />

<br />
Having a ranger in group pretty much guaranties Tipt final boss kill. Have ranger pull named and hit WS. Ranger has to be away from camp a bit so that AE rampage doesn&#180;t hit healers.  Send pet. Now the tricky part, NO ONE cast anything on named or ranger, as in NOBODY. No heals, no slow, no nothing. WS offed, bye ranja. Now mob is on pet, mob still needs NO spells (slow) casted on him. Pet has been previously buffed with Virtue. Healers start spamming heals on pet. Bye named. Gratz.
<br />

<br />
BARD ROLE: If anyone still things pet is a waste of DPS and you better off not invitnig a chanter over for flag. Think again. NOTHING pulls faster than a bard, and charm clock is ticking, so chain pull to pet and tank (without killing them), no reason to have pet sitting for 20 secs, pet can kill a mob in around 10 secs. When my slow gets resisted (chanter slow is 6.0 cast, mine is lat ike 5.1 or something like that) sometimes I do not have time for the second slow to land! Thus, as someone said, PULL PULL PULL, and assist with mezzes on loose pets.
<br />

<br />
I have no preferences on pets, I pet the first Hynid, Pooka or Cragbeast that comes along (I don&#180;t give them mage weapons, stuns are bad).
<br />

<br />
Necro? Yes, necro is nice for FD-rez recovery. Summon Corpse? Sure, but if no necro bard can ninja drag the corpses to zone (you can drag 2 corpses at a time using /corpsedrag).
<br />

<br />
Overall, I like Tipt or Vxed trials because I enjoy charming, and its about the only place where charm is allowed in GoD.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: When no snarer in group I still get charmed pet, since snarer place is most likely being taken by shamman, I just don&#180;t haste it, and I have to be twice as far from pet. I will mez it while he is coming at me, Tash it again, nuke mob a few times, and before mez fades, recharm pet (again, bard mez would safe a h*ll of a lot of time wasted with pet doing nothing, cause even if I mez pet first, as I should, I will still ask for SNARE - granted, bard snare - and after mob is bard snared, nuke mez off, recharm, and there you go, pet back at mob in no time. Sure beats waiting for 1 min and about 15 secs for mez to break anyday).</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Good adivice above about the pet management.
<br />

<br />
I kinda disagree that you have to be a stellar enchanter to pull it off (not saying you're NOT stellar, but I've managed it and gotten compliments while playing my hubby's chanter, and it was about the second time I've ever played a chanter other than to buff).
<br />

<br />
I would say that the biggest things with using a chanter pet are 1. chanter must stay alert and not have RL stuff going on, seems simple enough; 2. chanter must park pet at the front of camp and then stay far away from the pet; 3. people must understand the rule of 3 if the pet is tanking (pet will hold agro if three or fewer PC's are on the agro list, if a 4th gets on agro mob will ignore pet).
<br />

<br />
I've done both Vxed and Tipt with and without chanter pets -- as my paladin, who is EP and a few Time pieces (we are newish to Time still).  With a sharp healer and a back up healer I can tank the stuff, but it's no picnic.  When we have a pet we usually have me tank anyway and just use the pet for DPS and to tank if I need a break or am dead - that way mobs die so fast, I dont have time to die usually.
<br />

<br />
Bards are great for a few reasons but one important one is that the bard mez lasts 18 seconds, that is enough time (if folks are paying attention) to re-tash, re-snare, re-Malos the pet and re-charm, and then your charmed pet isn't standing around mezed for a while.
<br />

<br />
A tip I found in Vxed  or Tipt as a paladin: all mobs that are charmable, are stunnable. I keep my longest lasting stun memmed and I keep the chanter pet as my second (toggle last two targets) target, and if the chanter yells or I see the pet's agro message I toggle and stun it, that gives up to 10 seconds of the pet standing around, and with luck I can do this even while in combat with the current target. You might could use the Brusco's song for this, I haven't played with it much since I got it on my bard (who is now 61). 
<br />

<br />
If you have a spare paladin (two tanks actually work out pretty well here), they can babysit the pet (being ready to stun, healing the chanter, etc) and make things a lot easier.  I actually do the same when I'm playing my cleric in the trials (Tarnation lands); I always clear it with the chanter firt of course.  
<br />

<br />
One of the smoothest Tipt runs I ever had was with Warrior, Paladin, Cleric, Necro, Ranger and Shaman. The warrior (who is equivalently geared to my pally) could tank though it was still a challenge. Without pet breaks we made good progress -  even though the mobs took longer to die, they really don't have THAT many hp - and the Ranger Weaponshielded the named at the end, then we just burned him down.

I recently completed the 4 sewer trials, and I want to now begin working on Vxed.
<br />

<br />
I was gonna take a test group (all people who had never been there before) in last night just for an hour to dick around and get a feel for the zone and mobs, but the plans got cut short (I'm sure we'll go back, nothing beats first hand experience).
<br />

<br />
What I'd like to know... for Vxed and Tipt... what do you really NEED?
<br />

<br />
We're all in raiding guilds... breaking into the Elems... but we're not exactly &quot;Ele geared&quot; at this point.    Starting to be.
<br />

<br />
So we have a 9k-ish tank.   Will that cut it?    I don't mean will life be super easy... but what can you expect with that kind of tank?
<br />

<br />
I can see the benifits of charming... but it sorta sounds like CHARM ONLY is the feeling... and then everyone else kinda does nothing.... is that just because it's easier... or because it's needed?     As it happens I have a time geared enchanter friend who would most likely be doing this with me... but maybe not always... so I just want to get a feel for that... do you dare go without a charming enchanter?
<br />

<br />
No matter what the deal... I do intend on trying it out myself... I'm never afraid to take a death or 20... I'd just like to get a little more info / feel before we go in.

I do Vxed quite often with all kinds of groups.  You don't really need a chanter if the group has decent dps.  A 9k tank will be cutting it awfully close even on fast heals, though, unless your Cleric (and it will have to be a Cleric - I have yet to meet a Druid who can keep up, although I'm sure they exist) is really on the ball.</span></td>

We've snared the mobs, I've dotted em up, and I kept selos and numlock (autorun) on. They would summon me, hit me a few times, and I'd run out of range in time for the heal to land. Rinse and repeat. We never really did it to complete it so much as to get the various trinkets for BiC #6 -- but its doable that way too I would imagine, though maybe not worth the effort.</span></td>

Stay at zone for the entire time, pull until the Stonespiritist pops. Mem DA and wait till it pops. Get HP buffs up, lev the group, invis the group via a caster class (helps to delay aggro), fire up selo's and start running. Run along the walls, don't get stuck, and don't stop. When you get to the 2nd to last dog before the last room slow down a split second, warn your group (you should've been auto'running the entire time and just using left/right to change direction), and hit DA. The DA enables the people who need the flag to stop and either hit the hotkey they've prepared or say the key word (all they have to say is &quot;tend&quot; ) and the rest of you to click out in a timely fashion. Hopefully they've all been hit at least once on the way up so their invis has dropped automatically... but if they haven't make sure they all realize they have to take it off before the Stonespiritist will give the flag.
<br />

<br />
As the bard, don't be afraid to fade every so often because you are the only one that HAS to be alive at the top to DA the group and give them a chance to live.
<br />

<br />
You don't have to be only EP or better, although that's who I've done it with mostly. If you wanted it to work with worse gear the easiest way would be to send the already vxed flagged people first, then the bard (you need to live to group DA) and the people who need the flag last, which is how we did it when we wiped at the top and said &quot;F*** it&quot; and just ran. Basically the more unimportant people get initial aggro and so have a better chance of getting smacked, stunned, and run over leaving the people behind them to run on and leave the first people (and their mobs, briefly) behind.
<br />

<br />
It can be suicidal if you're not on your toes though. 
<br />

<br />
Pros: -you don't need an enchanter or shaman, the bard can single pull everything to entrance and slow
<br />
-can be done if you've wiped countless times and people are ready to give up
<br />
-can stack the group with non-flagged right before you kill the last mob before the spawn (the hynids at the entrance ARE kiteable bye a group of pure casters, for example)
<br />

<br />
Cons: -it's not the right way to do it
<br />
-it's dangerous and the possibility of people dying is probably significant, especially if you don't usually do stuff like that
<br />
-unless you have a bard in group this won't work, there isn't time for a DA class to stop and cast self DA so it has to be done on the run and you HAVE to have selo's to do this, soe/sow/billy just aren't fast enough
<br />

<br />
Anyway, just my 2 cents... but I live for the adrenaline rush lately *lol* Have fun!!</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Most of my successful Vxed / Tipt runs are withOUT enchanter charming pets. I have to admit that when everything goes smooth, enchanter charmed pet makes those trials much faster. However, unless I know the enchanter can handle charming, i would perfer to go petless.
<br />

<br />
As for our roles, as usual, chain pull mobs to group one at a time. I always try to slow the mob on the pull. Even if there is enchanter in group, I still mez adds until enchanter's mez lands. If group is using charmed pet, I make sure I have the pet on my target buffer and mez pet on charm breaks. If no charmed pet, I make sure group is moving at a decent pace and stay ahead of respawn. (if the group can't stay ahead of respawn, this group is very unlikely to be able to pass the trials)
<br />

<br />
For Vxed, usually my group kill about 30 mobs at the zone in, then start plowing up. Usually by the time we are about to reach the NPC room, the NPC would spawn. This saves time, and much safer than the DA run method. I have bad experience with DA run method. 2 out of 3 times I've tried it, somebody died during the run, and they were the ones who actually needed the flags <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-13.gif" border="0" alt="LOL" hspace="2" /> .</span></td>

<br />

<br />
If you're not out pulling when their charm breaks, MEZ the pet.
<br />

<br />
If you are the cleric, and you see charm break, STUN the pet.
<br />

<br />
If you can cast root, and you see charm break, ROOT the pet.
<br />

<br />
If you are the chanter, always ask for a snare on the pet... and if snare wears off before charm does, BREAK charm and get it re-snared.
<br />

<br />
If you make management a group effort you retain insane DPS with much lower risk.
<br />

<br />

<br />
As for a bard's role in vxed.. there is no reason to pull multiples in vxed, and if your group can't handle a single pre-slowed mob, you should seek your flag elsewhere, or wait until they can.

<br />
-I keep my drum and cha and singing gear equipped.

-I pull with HoS, and then keep HoS going on the pulled mob while killing it.  I also twist mana and focus while the target is being killed.
<br />
-I keep the chanters pet targeted at all times that I am not pulling (well except when singing HoS in twist I switch back for cast), and then just hang back singing keeping an eye on the pet and handling any CC that needs to be done.

<br />
It can get a little tricky pulling and CCing while keeping tabs on the pet... but not hard.  If you have someone else who can pull and then you can keep full-time tabs on the chanter pet and CC you can almost run through vxed, lol;  especially if the pet has toys and haste.
