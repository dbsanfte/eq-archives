<b>How is this better than charm? - </b>7/9/02 9:20:07 AM<br>~ <b>Klapton Groovemaster</b><blockquote>They both last 15 seconds, they both use a wind instrument, they both put you on top of the aggro list--why mez when you can charm?<br><br>two distinct advantages to charm over mez:<br><br>1.     The mob is now on YOUR side (hehehe)<br><br>2.     Idiots in your group CANNOT hit your pet (unlike breaking your mez)<br><br>Klapton Groovemaster<br>lvl 37<br>Charming Groupies on Vazaelle Server</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Group Macros - </b>1/31/02 5:15:50 PM<br>~ <b>Chill</b><blockquote>In response to the post about the MEZZING macro, you might actually consider a two line macro that compines the cast & saves time.  For example:<br><br>/g I am MEZZING the %T, No one attack it!<br>/cast 1 (or whatever slot you keep your mezz apell in)<br><br>Cuts down on work a lil & keeps you from forgetting to tell the group.<br></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Mez relies on CHA - </b>1/16/02 1:13:58 PM<br>~ <b>Steppy</b><blockquote>Both Pixie Strike and Song of Twilight at level 53 rely on charisma.  These songs really have 3 great uses.  The mez function is obvious, but Pixie Strike also debuffs magic resistance which means you can really set the table for casters.  Also, if your cleric is being battered by a mob and you want to taunt it off, this is a great way to do it!  Mez is a major taunt and debuffs are, too-- this song does both.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>are bard mezzes based on charisma, they give the same emote as charm songs - </b>1/14/02 8:43:35 AM<br>~ <b>susperia sacristsoul</b><blockquote>just wondering if this and the level 52 mez rely on high charisma. they both give the same emote when the mob is effected. <br><br><br>susperia sacristsoul<br>46th bard of the vazaelee server</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Why this is better then the aoe song. - </b>10/12/01 5:23:43 AM<br>~ <b>BOB</b><blockquote>The Aoe song is resisted 99% of the time. This song is resisted 98% of the time. That and AOE spells are very bad in many situations. But lets face it, bards are crap at mezzing till 53.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Answer to Menadana - why this one - </b>8/10/01 4:52:03 PM<br>~ <b>Arathros</b><blockquote>Menadana,<br><br>The level 15 Lullaby song is a nice song, it's true.  However as it sounds from your description, you've discovered its main drawbacks, which is, it's often resisted.  This becomes a real problem if you're trying to mesmerize multiple high level monsters.  In addition, the ones that break from it due to resistance or you not getting it to stick again all attack YOU.<br><br>I prefer to take Pixie Strike because it seems to be resisted less.  Also, if it sticks, it has a nice side-effect of interrupting any caster you use it on.  This is a good strategy to keep applying it to a caster mob (think complete heal types or gating types), even if your party is bashing on it and breaking the spell.<br><br>I seem to use it well in a situation where there are two or three mobs for my group to contend with.  In this situation, I'll stop attacking, pull back a little, and Pixie Strike my first target (and hit the text macro I posted about below).  Then, I'll either fit in a round or two of party buff songs and reapply the Strike, or mes a second target.<br><br>The song does have drawbacks.  For one, if your target has a damage-over-time (&quot;DOT&quot;) spell on it, then it won't stick.  Also, it will break many of the enchanter spells.  But it is a great backup if you have no enchanter and merely need to draw off one or two opponents.<br><br>Alternatively, Charm type songs can often accomplish the same things, plus put your pet in combat with the group's target.  But you have to be organized in terms of targeting and hot keys.<br><br>Crowd control isn't easy for bards, but knowing the techniques of what works and what doesn't is what separates true bard players from the powerleveled twinks.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>This song is fun - </b>8/3/01 4:29:32 PM<br>~ <b>Ecredes</b><blockquote>on Tullon Zek, i used this song outside high hold in EK at the top of the big ledge on a evil necro trying to PK me, i just used this reapetedly until eventually i knocked him off the ledge, LOL! haha that guy bitched to me about it for over an hour.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Why this one? - </b>7/25/01 5:44:19 PM<br>~ <b>Menadana</b><blockquote>Hi all, I am a fairly new Bard and just had a quick question.  As a bard working crowd control, what would make this song superior to the L15 AE song?  The duration of the mez effects?  I don't have this song yet and haven't found myself in a situation where I need any crowd control, but I have played with the L15 song and didn't have too much success.  I had a high level cleric friend watch over me as I pulled about 3 MOBs on me and tried to keep 2 sleeping and pick em off one at a time.  I think I just chose bad mobs because they stunned...resists and stuns kept my little plan from working .. at all.  The cleric had to step in and hit me with Reolution/Words/Symbols to make his job easier.  Several CHeals later the MOBs were finally dead.<br><br>Menadana<br>21 Bard</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Use a text macro to help out - </b>7/13/01 4:38:15 PM<br>~ <b>Arathros</b><blockquote>You can really help out with crowd control if you add a couple of text macros to your hot key boxes.  One that I use with Pixie Strike is a macro that basically says:<br><br>I am MESSING the %T, please don't wake it up!<br><br>Hit this button before or after you use the song on your target (by the %T) and it raises the chances your group will leave it alone.  I have a similar text macro for my charm hot key box group.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b> - </b>5/3/01 2:36:02 AM<br>~ <b>skulrag</b><blockquote>I love this song on hate raids, those dumb Clerics of inny always CH and i just chain mez um :) record is 5 inturrutps w/one cleric of inny =) also good for rogue/bard group, you chain mez, they chain backstab :p</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Some tips for using this song. - </b>4/16/01 1:49:15 PM<br>~ <b>Belark Songstrider</b><blockquote>This is an excellent song, and one that you will really begin to use a lot once you get into dungeon settings. <br><br>A few tips- If there is a capable enchanter in your group, let them handle messing. For some reason, your mes overwrites theirs, and doesn’t last nearly as long.<br><br>If there is not an enchanter, it's up to you to be crowd control for the group. Get out your wind instrument - it doesn’t make it more likely to succeed, but it lowers magic resistance by a greater amount when it does succeed, making it easier to re-mes. <br><br>Realistically, you cannot keep more than two things messed at once. Resists and the difficulties of retargeting make it really tough. Make sure your group knows this, and has a plan to deal with more than 3 things. <br><br>Group coordination is critical - It is VITAL that your group assists the lead, so that people aren't bashing your messed target. If you have a shaman who can slow, make sure they know that slowing your messed targets will really help you keep them messed. (They usually don't know this.)<br><br>Other uses of this song:<br><br>As mentioned, this song will interrupt a spell caster if he is still in his 'windup', and the song is not resisted. GREAT song for preventing healers from healing. <br><br>The other use of this song is the knock back effect. In testing, this song actually pushes the target a little bit in the DIRECTION YOU ARE FACING WHEN THE SONG TAKES EFFECT. So you can actually &quot;steer&quot; the target by singing this song. Need to pull him towards you? Target him, turn around so he's behind ya, and sing away. Bump him to the left? Target, turn left, and sing away. Can be useful for nudging things off of ledges or keeping them in a certain spot. <br><br>-Belark Songstrider, 51st Minstrel of Drinal<br><br><br> </blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Mezz - </b>3/14/01 12:08:43 AM<br>~ <b>Kocho Divah</b><blockquote>I always have this song memmed now. It acts as a Mezz, so if you get multiple pulls, you can mezz one for a good chunk of the time while you're fighting the first one. I love acting as crowd control with this song and Charm songs!</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Usefulness is against casters - </b>1/29/01 6:08:20 PM<br>~ <b>Quelionis</b><blockquote>This song is to be used against all caster types, when it hits it will disrupt the casters concentration 99% of the time, very good against any casters who heal themselves or others. I cast this song repeatedly while the group maims the mob. A top notch song to have in a casting situation.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Interrupting Casters! - </b>1/29/01 5:31:35 PM<br>~ <b>Kocho Divah</b><blockquote>If you're up against any kind of caster, mem this song. If you see them starting to cast a spell, hit this song, and you'll likely interrupt them. If not provoked, the mob will stand there stunned for up to 18 seconds. So when fighting a caster, don't be afraid to chain sing this song. It also adds a nice MR debuff.</blockquote></td></tr></table></blockquote><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href="/songs.asp?&song=31">Back to Normal Mode</a><br><br><br><i>Printed from EQDiva.com on 11/5/02 2:41:40 AM.</i><br><br></td></tr></table>
