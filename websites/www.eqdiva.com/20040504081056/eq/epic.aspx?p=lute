<H3>Forpar's Mystical Lute</H3>
<P>Baldric Slezaf tells you that Forpar Fizla has this lute but will not speak to 
		him. You must get this lute as your final item to return to Baldric. This is 
		rewarded as head, body and strings. It is confirmed you may do these in any 
		order (can hand in scales and bits to get the lute body before the lute head). 
		However, do make sure you are a minimum of level 50 before the lute body 
		turn-in, else Forpar will eat your items. If he doesn't respond when you say 
		"What Mystical instrument" below, then wait until you are sufficient level.<BR>
		<BR>
		Forpar Fizla is unwilling to talk to you and even other gnomes. To get him to 
		talk you help his friend, a female half elf bard named Vedico at the docks in 
		Butcherblock.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		<IMG alt="Vedico Windwisper" hspace="2" src="/images/epic/imgEpicVedicoWindwisper.jpg"
			align="right" vspace="2" border="0"> Vedico Windwisper may be found on the 
		docks in Butcherblock inside one of the shops at loc (1010, 3010). She lost her 
		horn to a cyclops named Quag Maelstrome in the Ocean of Tears. If you kill him, 
		you will get the "Alluring Horn" which you then return to Vedico in 
		Butcherblock.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		<B>You say,</B> 'hail Vedico Windwisper'<BR>
		<B>Vedico Windwisper says</B> 'Hello Kocho . Have you seen the port master? I 
		am here to complain about the shoddy service.<BR>
		<B>You say,</B> 'What shoddy service?'<BR>
		<B>Vedico Windwisper says </B>'I was sailing from Freeport on one of the boats 
		when a giant cyclops attacked the boat! No one lifted a finger as he stole the 
		horn I was playing and ran off. Someone here has to answer for the loss of my 
		horn.
		<BR>
		<B>You say,</B> 'what giant cyclops?'<BR>
		<B>Vedico Windwisper says</B> 'He was a huge cyclops! He came rushing up out of 
		the water and stared at me with his big eye and said, 'Me like horn me take and 
		play pretty music!' before he snatched my horn and disappeared back under the 
		waves.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		<IMG alt="Quaq Maelstrom" hspace="2" src="/Images/epic/Quag.jpg" align="left" vspace="2"
			border="0">Find Quag Maelstrom in the Ocean of Tears on the Seafury Cyclops 
		island. I was all prepared to solo chant-kite him (I was 49 at the time), when 
		a 45 shaman wanted to help me out. I knew I didn't need his help, but thought 
		it couldn't hurt. We found Quag at loc (1914, -6600). He was blue to me, and I 
		could see him carrying my horn, it was very obvious. The shaman buffed me all 
		up quite nicely, and gave me a sow and a levitate. The cyclops island is 
		crowded with cyclops of course, so I pulled him to a nearby island. I quickly 
		found he could run almost as quick as sow, so I just kept running round and 
		round the island, chanting at him all the way. The shaman sicced his pet on 
		Quag's behind. Looking back, it was quite humorous. Quag kept casting mana 
		drains at me, which I resisted all but one, not that it affected my bardic mana 
		anyway. A few times he was able to hit me, but I cast snare on him, which fixed 
		that. When Quag did hit me, he hit anywhere from 30 to 117 points damage, but 
		he didn't get close to me for the most part, only when I was dumb enough to 
		turn around and look at him. I did use my Denon's Desperate Dirge, which hit 
		him for 363 points damage. The entire fight took less than 7 minutes, and he 
		dropped the Alluring Horn, a Pearl Necklace, and 4 plat. I am sure there are 
		other ways to kill him, I just prefer to chant-kite when I solo (this was back 
		in 2001, so there may be better ways now).
		<BR>
		<BR>
		Take the horn back to Vedico in Butcherblock and she will then give you a note 
		to give to Forpar.
		<BR>
		<EM>[Hand Vedico 'Alluring Horn']</EM><BR>
		<B>Vedico Windwisper says</B> 'Where did you find this? I thought the cyclops 
		took it. I am in your debt Kocho. This horn has always been special to me.'
		<BR>
		<I>Vedico reaches into her pack and pulls out a note. </I>
		<BR>
		'Do you think you could deliver this to my gnome friend Forpar. I have not 
		spoken to him in a while and unfortunatly I will be unable to make the trip to 
		visit him. If you are looking to have an instrument made he is the man to ask.

		<IMG alt="Forpar Fizfla" hspace="2" src="/images/epic/imgEpicForparFizfla.jpg" align="right"
			vspace="2" border="0">Head to Steamfont Mountains and find Forpar Fizfla 
		hanging out in one of the windmills, the second one from the druid ring. His 
		loc is (pos 128, neg 600). He was apprehensive to me, so I used Cinda's 
		Charismatic Carillion and then he was amiable to me. Hand him the note from 
		Vedico and he talks about his mystical lute he can make. NOTE: Make sure you 
		are of sufficient level, if you are too young of a bard, he will say "This 
		matter is far too advanced for you to handle... come back after you have killed 
		a few more large rats." He will take your note but won't tell you about the 
		next part of the quest. I have received an email (as of 04/22/2002) saying you 
		do get the Lute HEAD, but stop there until level 50, as you won't get your Lute 
		Body or strings without being sufficient level.<BR>

<H4>Mystical Lute Head</H4>This is the next big part of the quest. Forpar tells 
you he is willing to make you an instrument, but only tells you how to make the 
Neck and Head of the instrument - the Mystical Lute Head. From what he says 
above, the list of items he needs includes (all these items are NO DROP): 
<OL>
		<LI>
			<B>Backbone of an Ancient Fishman </B>
		- Phinigel Autropos's spine (Kedge Backbone) from Kedge Keep
		<LI>
			<B>Amalgym Tentacle</B>
		- Amygdalan Tendril from Plane of Fear
		<LI>
			<B>Petrified skull of a Lycanthrope</B> - Petrified werewolf skull from 
			Karnor's Castle on Drolvarg Warlord
		</LI>
	</OL>
<P>All these three&nbsp;items may be MQ'd.<BR>
		<BR>
		<IMG height="167" alt="Phinigel Autropos" hspace="2" src="/images/epic/imgEpicPhinigelAutropos.jpg"
			width="100" align="right" vspace="2" border="0"> <B>Backbone of an Ancient 
			Fishman </B>- Off Phinigel Autropos in Kedge Keep<BR>
		<BR>
		<B>Phinigel Autropos</B> requires a well-organized group or two to take down, 
		and be sure and bring a good puller and mezzer with you. If the pull is not 
		100% successful Phinny might bring some Swirlspine Seahorses and Swirlspine 
		Guardians with him. Our 28th level Pixie Strike mezz will not work on the adds, 
		so you need to have the 53th level song to mezz, or bring along an enchanter. 
		Try to pull the Swirlspine Seahorses one at a time, as they cannot be stunned, 
		which means we cannot mezz them. Thankfully, the Swirlspine Guardians can 
		easily be mezzed as a bard.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		It is recommended that the best combination of songs to mem for the Phinigel 
		raid (if you have them) are: 55 Occlusion of sound, 53 Song of Twilight, 55 
		Cantana Replenishment. Since this is an underwater dungeon, you might want to 
		mem the Enduring Breath song just in case, and Jig (stamina) song if you are 
		not level 55 yet. The Occlusion of Sound is very useful in stripping the 
		seahorses and Phinigel of their Magic resistance. The casters are better able 
		to land their nukes.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		My guild has killed him 25 times, and about 5 times has a <B>Kedge Backbone</B> 
		drop. Two groups seemed to be sufficient but a high level bard or enchanter is 
		suggested just in case the pull brings back Phinny and friends. Phinny backbone 
		will fit into any container that can hold medium or larger items, or so I'm 
		told. The Eye of Zomm exploit has been fixed, so I will not cover that here, as 
		it no longer works.
	</P>
<P>Update from 2003: Some bards can solo Phinny now that they have better gear, 
		higher levels, more songs... He&nbsp;can be&nbsp;both mezzable and soloable. 
		Check the bard epic forum sections for any updated information on current 
		techniques. I believe he will spawn every 12 hours. After scouring all bard 
		forums pertaining to epic, it appears that of all the epic 
		drops,&nbsp;the&nbsp;mage staff is most common drop, the robe the most rare, 
		with the bard epic spine and wizzie staff somewhere in the 
		middle.&nbsp;Spine&nbsp;seems to average a 20% drop rate, but the range of bard 
		experience could be as bad as 32 kills and no spine, or a 75% drop rate in your 
		Phinny hunting career.

		<BR>
		The <B>Drolvarg Warlord</B> spawns inside Karnor's Castle just below the Hand 
		Room. His location is at spot #10 on the EQAtlas map of <A href="http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/karnors1map.html">
			Karnor's Castle</A>. He is around level 51 to 54, and will summon. (The 
		Warlord also has a rare Harmonic Dagger drop.) His placeholder is a Drolvarg 
		Bodyguard and, in fact, there are 5-6 that spawn in his room. There have been 
		cases when I have seen more than one Warlord spawn at a time. People have 
		emailed me saying he spawns every two hours or so.&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
		<BR>
		A good party in the Hand room can pull the Warlord when they clear all the 
		mobs. I'd say 50+ for all with a good healer and mezzer. He will drop the 
		Petrified Werewolf Skull, I believe about half the time.

<H4>Body of Mystical Lute</H4>When you receive your Head and Neck from Forpar, 
he will give you the quest for the body, which requires the following items: 
<OL>
		<LI>
			<B>Large red Dragon Scale</B>
		- Lord Nagafen (52 or below level), Talendor of Skyfire,&nbsp;or Ragefire(?) in 
		Naggy's Lair, or&nbsp;Echo of Nortlav&nbsp;in The Hole
		<LI>
			<B>Large white Dragon Scale</B>
		- Lady Vox in Permafrost (52 or below level), or Gorenaire of Dreadlands
		<LI>
			<B>Metal bits</B> - 1 smithed metal bits, from smithing Tradeskill, trivial at 
			21
		</LI>
	</OL>
<P><IMG alt="Gorenaire - White scale" hspace="2" src="/Images/epic/Gore.jpg" align="left"
			vspace="2" border="0">The white scale can be a bottleneck for the bard epic, 
		as it is usually the hardest item to get, in terms that your guild is either to 
		old for Vox, or too young for Gorenaire. If you do obtain a white scale, you 
		are very close to finishing your epic. <IMG alt="Talendor - Red scale" hspace="2" src="/Images/epic/Talendor.jpg" align="right"
			vspace="2">Red scale has many sources, of which are relatively easy 
		obtainable. A new update to the quest is that Echo of Nortlav (recently 
		replacing Nortlav Scalekeeper) is a new source of red scales, he is in the 
		Hole, same room as Master Yael, and he lifetaps and stuff.
	</P>
<P>A few notes regarding these scales in case you decide to buy your scales. Don't 
		get scammed by someone selling you 'Dragon Scales', these are for the 
		Wurmslayer quest and are very common. You want 'White Dragon Scales' and 'Red 
		Dragon Scales'. As of recently, the icon may have changed, it is a red scale on 
		the item icon, even for the white scale.<BR>
		<BR>
		Based on reported loot drops, a scale will drop about 50% of the time for 
		Vox/Naggy, and 33% of the time, multiple scales will drop, I've heard up to 6 
		white scales dropping from Vox. Some mobs like Nortlav are pretty much 
		guaranteed to drop a red scale, not sure about Talendor. Talendor's spawn time 
		is 7 days.</P>
<P>Check the "Other Resources" to discuss dragon-killing techniques, as these can 
		change due to new levels, songs, and better gear...</P>
<P>Regarding the metal bits, I've had lots of emails saying that they've used 2 metal 
		bits. You can use 1 or 2 metal bits, it doesn't matter, both have been reported 
		to work. The item itself is smithered 'Metal Bits' which is plural.<BR>
		<BR>
		Once you have these 3 items, port over to Forpar in Steamfont. If you are not 
		at least level 50 (as of 10/20/02), Forpar will say "How did someone so 
		inexperienced get a hold of this? I'll see that it gets to the proper hands." 
		So make sure you are level 50 or above.<BR>
		<BR>
		[<I><B>Hand Forpar the red dragonscale, white dragonscale, and 1 metal bits</B></I>]
		<BR>
		<BR>
		<B>Forpar Fizfla says</B> 'Wooooooo! You are doing a wonderful job, Kocho. I 
		wish I could go out and gather these things myself.' Forpar sits back down at 
		his desk and pulls several very strange looking tools out. Eventually he looks 
		up at you and says, 'The body is done! Only one more piece to go!'

<H4>Mystical Lute Strings</H4>Finally, get the strings for the Lute - Trakanon 
Gut Strings. These drop from Trakanon himself (Level 65 dragon in Sebilis). 
There have been some recent changes to the quest. The Trakanon guts <B><I>no longer drop</I></B> from the regular Trakanon, rather the epic-hopeful bard 
spawns Trakanon with the lute body.<BR><BR><IMG height="230" alt="An Undead Bard" hspace="2" src="/images/epic/imgEpicUndeadBard.jpg"
		width="100" align="right" vspace="2" border="0"> You get the bard epic copy of Trakanon to spawn by talking to the 
Undead Bard. The undead bard spawns approximately 18 +/- 4 hours after Trakanon 
is killed, although he has spawned immediately after Trakanon is slain as well. 
It may be unnerving to setup a whole raid party not knowing whether the UDB 
(Undead Bard) is up or not. His approximate location is neg 2100, neg 700. A 
ranger could not track the Undead Bard until the raid party reached the location 
neg 1600, neg 200. This means tracking range seems to be about 700 units. In the 
Jugg's castle before reets, Jumpy was trackable, UDB was NOT. With bard 
tracking, the UDB will only be trackable from the bridge to the lair. Emails 
have reported the UDB being tracked from the crypt, middle of Disco camp, but 
I'm not sure if this was bardic or ranger tracking. There was a trick using the 
Eye of Zomm/Lyssa's Solidarity of Vision, I'm currently researching this and 
will post the method shortly, hopefully the first week of January 
2004.<BR><BR>You turn in your epic lute body to this UDB. He returns the lute 
body immediately (appears in your inventory), becomes enraged, he needs to be 
killed. He is around level 55-56. Ask to have Rune V cast on you, as the Undead 
Bard will hit hard, this way you can make it back to your group alive. When the 
enraged undead bard is killed, Trakanon spawns. He drops Trak guts 100% of the 
time, and also drops a Trakanonian BP or class chest item (random) but no teeth. 
If you don't kill this Trakanon in time,&nbsp;the Trak clone&nbsp;will despawn 
after 20 minutes. UDB will not respawn until another 18 +/- 4 hours. If the real 
Trakanon spawns during this time, he will kill the UDB.<BR><BR>Here is how the 
conversation will go with your Undead Bard: <BR><BR><B>You say,</B> 'Hail, An 
Undead Bard' <BR><B>An Undead Bard says</B> 'Hail, Kocho . Are you perchance a 
minstrel?' <BR><B>You say,</B> 'I am a minstrel' <BR><B>An Undead Bard says</B> 
'I, too, am a bard, or was rather. I have been cursed by that blasted pile of 
bones who calls itself, Trakanon' <BR><B>You say,</B> 'who is Trakanon' 
<BR><B>An Undead Bard says</B> 'He is the undead dragon who rules this realm. I 
came on a quest seeking strings for my new instrument.' <BR><B>You say,</B> 
'what new instrument' <BR><B>An Undead Bard says</B> 'I sought to create a 
Magical Lute.' <BR><B>You say,</B> 'what Magical Lute' <BR><B>An Undead Bard says</B> 'One that would make me the greatest bard in all the lands! Are you on 
a similar quest?' <BR><B>You say,</B> 'I am on a similar quest' <BR><B>An Undead Bard 
		says</B> 'Well then, I would ask you a favor for one in return. If I bring 
that cursed dragon here, will you kill it for me?' <BR><B>You say,</B> 'I will 
kill it for you' <BR><B>An Undead Bard says</B> 'Excellent. I have stayed here 
far too long and I wish to go to my eternal slumber. But before I do so, I ask 
for one last request' <BR><B>You say,</B> 'what is your one last request' 
<BR><B>An Undead Bard says</B> 'Give me the Mystical Lute Body you have. I will 
return it, don't worry. I only wish to hold an instrument one last time before I 
leave.' <BR><BR><IMG alt="Trakanon spawn for Bard Epic" hspace="2" src="/Images/epic/Trak.jpg" align="left"
		vspace="2">When you hand your lute in, UDB 
will return it and will enrage. Kill the UDB, and Trakanon will spawn 
immediately. Kill Trak and he will drop your guts. With your newly acquired
