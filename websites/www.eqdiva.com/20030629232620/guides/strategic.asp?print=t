<h3>Using the Strategic Commander as a Bard in Everquest</h3>
Hello all, Kocho asked me to put something together to help anyone who may be interested to setup the Strategic Commander for Everquest bards.  To start off, for those of you that do not have the controller I am referring to, you can get info about it on the Microsoft site.
<br><br>
Personally, the only time I ever use the keyboard while playing is while traversing difficult terrain (Ex. The thin boards found around Upper Guk.) and to chat.
<br><br>
My setup is as follows:
<br><br>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" width="500">
	<tr>
		<td nowrap><b>No Shift:	</b></td><td>1- Sing Song 1</td><td>2- Sing Song 2</td><td>3- Sing Song 3</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;<br></td><td>4- Sing Song 4	</td><td>5- Sing Song 5</td><td>6- Sing Song 6</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Shift 1:</b></td><td>1- Sing Song 7</td><td>2- Sing Song 8</td><td>3-Location and Corpse Pull</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;<br></td><td>4- Auto-attack</td><td>5- Assist Target</td><td>6- Announce Incoming Target</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Shift 2:</b></td><td>1- Change Screen Mode</td><td>2- Twist 1 </td><td>4	3- Inventory</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;<br></td><td>4- Pet Attack</td><td>5- Pet Report Health	</td><td>6- Pet Back Off</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Shift 3:</b></td><td>1- Sit and Sing Song 1</td><td>2- Stand</td><td>3- Duck</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;<br></td><td>4- Call for Run</td><td>5- Shout train & yell</td><td>6- Call for a heal</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br><br>
<b>Zoom In Button:</b> Change View Point<br>
<b>Zoom Out Button:</b> Autorun<br>
<b>Push Forward & Pull Backward:</b>  Move the Corresponding Direction<br>
<b>Twist Right & Left:</b>  Turn the Corresponding Direction.<br>
<b>Push Left & Right:</b> Empty.
<br><br>
The reason that I have each song setup to be sung separately (Except for Twist 1 & 4 which is used for downtime and/or travel.) is that if you are bashed or miss a note, you can recover more quickly.   As far as I can tell, there is not a way to setup the commander to automatically twist songs continuously.  You still need to hit the button for the song as if you are doing a twist using hot keys except you only need to hit each once to stop the last song and start the new song.
<br><br>
Below you will find links to my personal setup for the controller.  I am sure all of you will find it necessary to make at least one change or another to better suit your play-style and or Everquest setup, if you decide to use it.  For example, I changed the auto-attack key from A to Q.  This prevents me from doing what every one of us have done at one time or another, that is accidentally attacking an NPC because we thought we were in chat.  So, in my setup, you will need to change the auto-attack from Q to whatever key you have setup as auto-attack.  In the profile notes you will see that I normally have Hymn of Restoration in spell slot 1 and Selo's in spell slot 4.  This is why the only 2 song twist is for spell slots 1 and 4 and why the Sit and Heal button is setup to cast slot 1.
<br><br>
The Incoming, Heal, and Run buttons are all set up so that you will say these in your selected default chat mode.  So, if you are on Group default you will say in group. This allows for more flexibility in the use of these buttons, such as in multi-group raids you can use shout or guild speak.  Also, the Incoming button will return your target in the message.  Similarly, the Train and Yell button will return your target in the message.
<br><br>
Programming the Commander to do other things is relatively simple.  The hardest thing is to simply remember to use Insert Special for enter and pauses.  You should easily be able to add or alter commands by examining the current setup.  
From my observations, a 0.2 second pause is required between /stopsong and /cast # or you will always get the "You have not Recovered Yet" message.  Sometimes, you will still receive this message with a 0.2 second pause if under laggy conditions.  Using this current setup, I have not managed to achieve a 4 song twist.  I believe this is due to the pause that is required between /stopsong and /cast #.  If you wish to twist songs as if using hot keys (in other words by hitting each button twice, once to stop last song and once to start new one) you can simply remove the /stopsong command and pauses from each of the cast buttons.  I have attempted to have one button use two /cast # commands to simulate this, but it seemed to increase recovery time if you are stunned or miss a note.
<br><br>
I believe this should be enough to get everyone up and running on the Strategic Commander.  I would encourage everyone to try different setups and command lines in the profile to get the controller configured better to your own play style.
