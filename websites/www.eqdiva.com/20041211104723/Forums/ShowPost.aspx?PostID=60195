				<td colspan="2"><span>Hello
<br />

<br />
Just wanted to drop in and clarify the situation a bit. I'm not the programmer who worked on this change, so I may not have this exactly right, but if I properly understood what I heard the change to the bard AE songs has two key parts to it.
<br />

<br />
1) The change should only be affecting the range of unlimited-target-count (PBAE) songs that cause damage. This was not a change to all AE spells.
<br />
2) The range is only reduced if the bard is moving about. If you are stationary then the range should be the same as before. We did this specifically for the purpose of retaining as much of the group &amp; raid usefulness of the spells as possible. We really wanted to minimize the impact this had to the other uses of the spells, and did this in order to specifically stop what is considered a balance problem of being able to kill literally as many NPCs as a player could collect. 
<br />

<br />
I'm posting here because I just didn't want the false rumors about the nature of the changes to continue since things really aren't as bad as the rumors would suggest. 
<br />

<br />
Cheers
<br />

Question.
<br />

<br />
What constitutes moving about? 0.00001 feet/sec movement?  50 feet/sec?  I can't think of a group or raid where I am NOT moving about, even if just for the case that tanks, nukers and pets are always pushing the mob around.</span></td>

Grumbuk, 
<br />

<br />
nice post but it would have been better if something was given back to the bards who's ability to AE kite is taken from them.
<br />

<br />
Fair or unfair AE kite has been around for 5 years now, just like being able to twist 4 songs at once which was not dev's first intention, become an ability for bards so was AE kiting.
<br />

<br />
Now you are taking away an ability from us, we use it alot or non at all is not the issue here.
<br />

<br />
Give us something in return like extended notes apply to all songs including targeted dots.
<br />

<br />
We are all paying customers, it makes perfect sense to keep your customers happy.
<br />

<br />
best regards
<br />

<br />
Metin

OMG.
<br />
These worthless unskilled devs just didn't destroyed EQ enough. They are now even saying that bards should be stationary.
<br />
This is so.....wrong.
<br />
After extremly bad bugged without fun expansions. After making the game dull and boring. After revamping zones that were once cool. Now they are making the not-moving-to-cast bard. It is a joke or what lol.
<br />
Granted i don't care i canceled some time ago but seeing a dev saying that bards can still sing without moving so it is ok is amazing.
<br />
I am sure that the not-moving-to-sing thing will please them a lot. Be ready they found another cool idea.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>We're not saying bards should be stationary. Being able to move about and cast spells is part of what bards have always been able to do and while I can't speak for the design team I really don't expect that to change. The problem with the PBAE is that people were using these spells to gain experience at a rate far beyond what the designers felt was reasonable. Quite a lot of time was spent discussing this, and dropping the range of damage causing PBAE spells to melee range of the NPC when the bard is running around seemed to be the only practical way to solve this fairly substantial balance problem. Not only is it a balance problem, but it's also a general server load problem since this PBAE kiting puts a fairly large strain on the server clusters and does in fact cause server lag for other players.
<br />

<br />
That said, if you feel there is a better way to stop people from being able to AE kite dozens/hundreds of NPCs at a single time that would have less side effects to gameplay than the change currently in place, please let us know. We just want to solve the problem. Personally I think this is a reasonable solution but I will be happy to pass ideas off to the design team. Like all code on Test, it's subject to change so now is a good time to come up with better ideas.

				<td colspan="2"><span>The 10 mob HOH code is the fix.  It is not unbalancing at 10 in any way...ever see a chanter clear the HoH with a pet, they can get the same 2 aa an hour with less risk than a 30 radius area kite.
<br />

<br />
Group experience is almost as good as a perfectly performed area kite at 65.
<br />

<br />
10 would eliminate the 50 mob stuff going on in low lv bards.  
<br />

<br />
Add in this to the 10 limit. Make the range lower, but with extended notes maxxed let it be the same as current.  This means at low lv the range is not good enough for an area,  at 65 it still might not be enough, since you have to spend a butt load of aa to get the range to workable levels.
<br />

<br />
You tell us, where is the problem?  Is it the low lv bard getting a lv ding every 5 minutes, or the lv 65 getting 2aa an hour?  You can get 2aa an hour in lots of groups when 65 with 100aa.  So it is mearly choice at that point, of how to spend your time.
<br />

<br />
The fix has to be how to fix the truely disruptive to zones kites, the gaining LV (not aa) way to fast kites.
<br />

<br />
The gaining aa too fast is not really there as I see it.  we are talking 2aa an hour at 65...this is not worth breaking the game over.  NOTE pre extended notes nerf it was maybe 3aa an hour, and pre HOH nerf maybe something even crazier...it is like 2aa now there.

I agree with Moose's idea.
<br />

<br />
reducing the AE range then making up for it with extended notes aa will prevent the so called &quot;L65 in one month bards&quot; from doing it with EA songs.
<br />

<br />
There is always other ways to PL so let them figure it out.
<br />

<br />
And reducing the mobs which can be hit with AE to 10 sounds reasonable to me.

Well, since a Dev decided to open up this can of worms:
<br />

<br />
Since us non-important-customers, err I mean non-raiders can't get the xp gain rate that you based GoD AA on (PoFire xp rate), we should all get a reduction in AA cost since its less than what you felt was reasonable.  If you are going to d*mn us on one side, give us the benefit on the other side.

There have been working solutions offered on this since AE kiting first came into the spotlight.  You people over at SOE either 1) don't give a rat's @$$ or 2) are lazy and nerfing it to uselessness is easier.  Add in the random caster and/or summoner and the problems is solved without touching the use of the song.  That was offered since day 1.  You fixed HoH without screwing up the songs, yet can't here.

I don't even care about AE kiting, because I find all forms of play that involve running in circles for hours at a time to total drag.

THERE HAVE BEEN DOZENS OF SUGGESTIONS THROUGHOUT THIS THREAD.
<br />

<br />
Sorry for caps but you need to see these suggestions and read them again.  The easiest soloution is the LIMIT THE NUMBER OF MOBS TO 10.  Seriously.  When you have more than 10 mobs chasing you taknig damage, make them gate. That's what you did in HoH a few months ago.  It seemed reasonable back then, right?  What drastic change has made it unreasonable since then?
<br />

Mobs with different runspeeds.
<br />
Mobs that stop to cast.

Mobs that snare kiting Bards.
<br />
Mobs that summon.

<br />
Any ONE of those kinds of mobs added to the locations where the activity is happenning will make it VERY hard to do.
<br />

<br />
I recommend that these mobs be plentiful enough among static spawns, and/or wander, so that Bards can't just &quot;avoid THAT corner where caster_01 spawns&quot; and continue to do the same thing.

<br />
<u><b>The perfect solution!  (Read this, seriously, it rules)</b></u>
<br />

<br />
h*ll, add random Named Orc Pawns with 300 HP (enough to survive two ticks of AE zappage) who hit for 3 hp, that also just happen to <b>summon when you aggro them</b> (green mobs won't aggro unless you run past them, oh i dunno, singing an AE song?).  Not only would this stop AE kiters, but would be funny as h*ll.  Plus, it would little or no affect on groups or other players.  Even if they accidentally aggrod the wussy summoner, two smacks later they are on their way.  The AE kiting Bard, however, will get hit by the other 50 REAL mobs he was kiting...
<br />

<br />
Heck, name the mob something like &quot;A Bard Hater&quot; or &quot;A Bard's Bane&quot;.  Or give him a weak snare and DS, and call him &quot;A Whiney Dr00d&quot;.  Or have the mob FD after summoning you, and call it &quot;A Crybaby Monk&quot;.  LMAO</span></td>

<br />

<br />
I wonder about the solution of the 10 mob limit.  I think it is interesting how the server lag due to AE kiting was brought up.  I lag a lot so anything about reducing lag interests me.
<br />

<br />
Lets say that songs can only hit 10 mobs at most.  If your AE kiting, can't you still collect 50+ mobs and work your way through them 10 at a time?  I had done quadding on my wizard like this on occasion back when quadding made sense.
<br />
Yes, your exp rate is reduced by 80%, but total xp gained remains the same. You generally have to wait for the zone to repop again anyway, don't you?
<br />

<br />
I don't know about the gating thing that was mentioned in HoH.  That sounds like a good way to create zone wide trains.
<br />

<br />
I like the explaination given by the dev regardless if it is on test as stated yet or not. Provided that the &quot;moving&quot; part of what he said allows for small positioning corrections.  Don't ask me how that would be implemented.  Or you could just remove the DoT portion of the AE slow songs.
<br />

<br />
I also think that if this nerf is implemented as stated, Extended notes should be returned to what it once was. The first nerf didn't work so try again, but roll back the first nerf as it no longer serves any purpose but to piss people off.
<br />

The options all come down to whom is affected.

1) sole bard

2) guild/raid
<br />
3) other soloers and groups

<br />
The changing of our PBAE spells will affect (1) and (2).  Changing mob characteristics, snare/summon, affect (1) and (3).
<br />

<br />
Even with bright idea_009: the anti-moving spell changes will limit our ability control mobs while raiding and grouping.  The only solution, which only affects (1), is the PBAE mob limit.
<br />

<br />
Why not handle this on a situational basis?  Problem in Dulak/Nadox: limit to 12.  Problem in PoV: same thing.
<br />

<br />
Why do you insist on fluffing us with this exp limit banter?  I have a rogue who gains way more exp grouping in KT than my bard can do in PoV, PBAE'ing.  And PBAE'ing is a lot of friggin' work compared to smashing my backstab/evade/discipline keys.

				<td colspan="2"><span>In the last 10 levels or so, I've done a lot of AE kiting in Dulak. I can tell you exactly how many times I've seen a bard monopolizing the whole zone. 1. 1 time. Unfortunately, I can't tell you how many times I've seen a high level BL, shaman, or necro kill everything in the zone, regardless of what anyone else was doing.  I ran out of fingers and toes a long time ago.  What's being done about this?
<br />

<br />
As someone else said, there's really only two issues with AE kiting. One, low levels getting new levels very fast. Anyone with a high level caster friend can do this, so I assume corrections for these methods will be included also. Two, gaining aa quickly at 65. As has been said, there are few places this is possible, and it is comparable to group exp rate. What's the problem?

No matter what they tried to do this must be considered a nerf since we lost power on all out PBAE without gaining anything. The &quot;legitimate&quot; use also got hit hard, how many here will remember to stop for AE songs?

I believe you have hit upon the single most important issue here.
<br />

<br />
I realize I will be flamed for saying it, but flame on anyways as it is a fact.
<br />

<br />
That any SOLO experience approaches GROUP experience is what is considered unbalancing.  It has been a long standing policy of Sony to try to incentivise players to group.  Classes that could solo have been repeatedly limited to try and force them into grouping.  Fixes have been put into place to try and make those solo pet classes fit into groups better (Mage Pet fix anybody).
<br />

<br />
Like it or not, EQs vision is for players to game as a group first and foremost, with a possibility to solo on the side.
<br />

<br />
Thank you Grumbak for the assurances that at least some thought was given to keeping the AE songs secondary effects in place.
<br />

<br />
In my opinion saying that limiting the number of mobs to 10 as a fix is pointless.  It still would allow AE kiting to be quite profitable, which is not the point of the change.</span></td>

Lets see some equal opportunity here bro, because as I mentioned somewhere above,  chanters can clear as many or more mobs per 30 mins in HoH as I can....and I know how to area big time.  It is not fun or easy, but it is a good way to spend an hour in the hotseat where I could be pulled away at a moments notice and not screw my group over in a LDON, or wherever else.
<br />

<br />
It is bull.... to say this is about fast aa solo at 65.  Some classes can not solo, some can.  2aa an hour solo is not uber in the least,  and considering the Bard is the least played class, then go nerf the crap out of the other solo classes first till they have as few members on the server as bards....don't stop your nerfing of these classes until we see balance in the numbers....???? idiotic 
<br />

<br />
Seeing any class quad is gonna make my brain bleed. Can't beat them join them, works as long as your not a bard.  No one joined us lately, but we can all solo are asses off as chanters and necros.  Join them.
<br />

<br />
Assuming some may actually want to solo....sounds like the &quot;fix&quot; in your freaking pea brain is people who want to solo roll a chanter, necro, druid, and get 2 aa an hour the so called harder way....I am laughing so freaking hard at that it makes me wana puke.
<br />

<br />
Is it really better to terf a 5 year old Bard for a newbie solo class and do the same thing???? clueless.  
<br />

<br />
It is a bit freaking late to be deciding at this point that only 50% of the classes are &quot;allowed&quot; to solo for 2aa an hour,,,,and we are not one of them anymore.
<br />

<br />
Soloing these other classes by hiting 99.9 fewer key strokes is by some way the moral way, and seeing that it has zero risk vs 10 mob at 500 hitters 30 feet from you is just easy.  Maybe 5 bards oper server can even pull this off 100% of the time.  The ones yelling here for the nerf fixing things, can not area worth a crap, or have 5 hours a day to raid, or have their own excuse as to why this won't hurt them.
<br />

<br />
Lets see some real sweeping change.  No soloing allowed for any class that is lv65.  Think anyone will leave the game??  They have had enough  log in questionaires to know the results....guess pissing off 50 bards per server is better than pissing off say 1000 druids, or 1000 chanters, or 1000 necros?
<br />

<br />
Bards are the hardest class to play, BAR NONE. I am talking busy, attention span, timing, all aspects rolled into being a really good bard.  I would gather there are not as many lamer bards at 65-100 as there are lamers in other classes.  The lamers play a Bard for a month and say...tooo much work, and go back to there other toon. 
<br />

<br />
THIS IS the reason that so few plays them.  It is also the reason that a few chioose to play them and not a cracker jack class that we got bored of.
<br />

<br />
Lets hear the rules we are trying to work to here Sony...the 10 commandments that are just for Bards.  I will start you off with the first one...
<br />

<br />
shall not solo
<br />

<br />
too bad other classes do as they please.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I am a 65 bard. I've played solo and small group for most of my career. I have never AE kited in that time. Any bard who claims to have lost the ability to solo because of this fix is quite simply mistaken. There are still plenty of other ways to solo a bard.
<br />

<br />
I happened upon a bard who was soloing Dulak this past weekend with AE kiting. He was a level 52 bard, and he had pulled a large fraction of the zone into the wide open area just as you enter the zone. Inside 10 minutes or so, he'd killed all of them, and he was now a 54 bard. Gained over a level in a single kite. Yes, absolutely, that is horribly unbalanced.
<br />

<br />
Personally, I don't think your fix is going to work. You said the range was unchanged while the bard stands still, but limited to melee range while moving. Fine. The new tactic is to pull the whole zone, run far enough ahead of the bunch, stop, cast, and get moving again as soon as the song goes off, before they catch you. You were not moving during the cast, and the mobs quite happily moved into the full stationary range without quite getting close enough to hit you. Yes, it's more risky, but you'll still have bards in Dulak gaining levels at a time, just running around more of the zone to do it.
<br />

<br />
The one place that I do use my AoE songs is for green farming. I'm perfectly willing to let 40-odd green mobs beat on me for the 4 or 5 ticks it takes them to die. So in that case your fix would not affect me. Limiting the number of mobs I can hit to 10 would affect me. It would be annoying, but hardly intolerable.
<br />

<br />
Why not just put a hard cap on the EXP gain rate? Seems to solve the problem without changing the rest of the song dynamics. Also solves the problem of 65's powerlevelling low characters. (Assuming you see that as a problem.) Then again, I suppose a patient bard could just run around with a huge kite in tow waiting for more time before killing again, but why? It's far more risky then running a few small kites in the same time. </span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>No you cannot still pull 50 mobs and continue to kite. In HoH the mobs gate over 10. That is the fix. It does not create trains, as if the mob runs back chances are he will smack you, not just get right back in line. Welcome to squished bard.
<br />

<br />
 As I mentioned on another board, This is imo the most reasonable fix, the 10 mob rule. This could be balanced and lessened even further. Nerf the range on the songs, and let EN work it back up to its current range.
<br />

<br />
This does two things-
<br />
It negates the use of AE as viable until 51. Ergo, no level a kite at level 5, or 30, no low level zone monopolizing. No one will save the aa necessary to make this viable again until they get the levels first. Perhaps very very few will spend on it once they hit 51, but it won't be worth it, if the 10 mob rule is in effect.
<br />

<br />
It drastically reduces the amount of zones AE will have to be adjusted to the 10 mob rule, making SoE lives easier. Here are the zones as I know them. Please folks, if you know others, mention them- it is for our benefit.
<br />
Dulak, Gunthak, Nadox, PoV, PoN, ME. If it is the lower level bard that is the problem , no zones need adjusting at all.
<br />

<br />
2aa an hour is not overpowering nor unbalanced. Work a solution around that premise. If SoE thinks it is, state so.
<br />

<br />
Standing and casting is unfortunately, not a workable solution for these reasons- First of all, Bards are always moving, it is second nature. Second of all, in groups and raids there is a matter of position. It is not a targeted AE, where we can stand back and cast, we have to get in the middle, that means moving, and due to the lag generated by a raid, you are asking for an exact instant in time to be synched, ie stopped when the song hits, or it now becomes ineffective. Our comps must recognize it, the servers must recognize it. If you have to be stopped when the song is started and ends, chances are we will not be in position, that happens at the last second on AE encounters and groups, especially as the bard is often the puller. The current range is not so much that we are guaranteed a hit unless we are in the middle.
<br />

<br />
Extend the AE range to pre-nerf HoH levels to solve the above mentioend issue, and you will still have AE kiters btw, the only difference is that the motion will be stutter step, the circles will be bigger is all. It will get rid of autocircling however, but it would not solve the root issue. It will just mean a new technique to learn.
<br />

<br />
I am however glad to see that indeed the squeaky wheel does get the grease, fix it right. If any of my posts seemed incendiary to you, good, they were intended to be. We have someone talking to us now, at the very least.

<br />

<br />
Thanks for taking the time to explain what is going to happen.  I hope you're 100% right on how you say this change is going to be.
<br />

<br />
To everyone else, yeah, there are other fixes that could have been put into place, such as the fix for HoH or turning our AE Kiting into Quad Kiting... but even that comparison is wrong.  We use no mana, can run the whole time, and AE Kite... that's not quadding at all.  So, maybe there were a couple other possible fixes, but I fail to see how this fix (if done as stated) will affect anything other than the AE Kiters.
<br />

<br />
I have AE Kited some myself, to see what all the buzz was about; honestly, I think it probably did need a bit of a nerf.  I'm not saying it's horribly over-powered in my case, since I'm not that great at researching and timing things, but someone who was, could get tons of returns with very little risk... I can see that being a problem.  Due to areas being cleared constantly, some of the inconsiderate Bards out there who will take all mobs from in front of people, and thanks to the many Bards who got tons of levels and had no clue how to play their class, I think this is a change for the better.  I will be sad to see the 30-40% lvl exp per kite at ~lvl 40 go, but it really was ridiculous... I had been justifying it with the number of deaths I take, but I still out leveled my Wizard, SK and Monk friends almost 2 levels to 1.  
<br />

<br />
I do hope that maybe the developers start looking at ways to give a bit of a boost to Bards since it seems to be the consensus that you need hundreds of AA in order to be decent, and that was only bearable before because of the nice exp we could solo.  There are still other methods of soloing and getting good exp, I'm sure, but probably not much faster than other classes... so we should have the same dependence upon AA's that other classes do.  That is to say, maybe some of our regular abilities need a little tweaking.  
<br />

<br />
Overall, I'm very happy to play a Bard, and this change seems like it is only going to defeat the one thing it aimed to defeat, so nothing wrong with that.  I wonder if they figured for the fact that there would still be a way (even more dangerous) to AE Kite at least at lower levels ( &lt;55 ).  All it would take is even more precise timing of the songs and various 'manuevers'.  If they did take care of that in the code, it may unintentionally step on some of the other ways the songs can be used... we'll see.
<br />

<br />
Personally, if it only affects AE Damage songs (and hopefully only the damage portions of mixed AE damage/effect songs) and only if you're moving, I don't think this is bad at all.
<br />

<br />
I hope the friendly, helpful, mature Bards among you who play Bards because you want to be Bards stay with the class... those who wanted fast levels or whatever else... make your way over to the quadder classes now.  And on that note, Druids and Wizzies, now that people are going to stop bitching about us (I would hope) I wish you the best of luck at being a target once again now that you can effectively kill the most mobs simultaneously of the classes.
