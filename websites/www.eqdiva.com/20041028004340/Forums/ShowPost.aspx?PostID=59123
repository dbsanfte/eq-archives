				<td colspan="2"><span>I know the topic is highly disputed.  Some Bards wanna see it made easier so they can get mad XP and others wanna see it nerfed because a pure AoE bard has a good chance of being a poor bard and making the class look bad.  Now I've AoE'd some in my Norathian life, but done ALL the rest as well but can see both sides of the argument.  This post is not meant to be a discussion on that topic.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I was thinking, what did they have in mind when the songs were originally introduced?  Now I don't know the answer to that question, but I can speculate it was so bards could do damage to several mobs at once.... with some of the higher level AoE slowing as well..... but, I don't think they invisioned a bard running around with many many mobs in tow.  Sooooo.  Why not make the AoE song range like 50-60 and then reduce that range by 2 for every mob that the bard has agro on in the zone.  The numbers could be switched to whatever was desired.  You could easily adjust the numbers to make it so no more than X number of mobs could be kited and it would improve the usefulness of what I believe the original intent was.  Don't know how difficult it would be to program within there current design.... hehehe but it's computers.... it's doable.... just how difficult.  Dunno just an idea.  <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif" border="0" alt="Big Smile" hspace="2" /> </span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>OK, OK the easiest fix is make the dam songs range 20 so at low levels you can not area...once 65 and you have your wits about the class...and played it more than 1 weekend...you do your aa get extended notes and bingo now you have the same as now.  30 to 35 range which takes a bunch of talent to do in some zones..at least manual kites.
<br />

<br />
Best of both worlds.  It alows seasoned bards to get the needed aa for an otherwise gimp class, and it stops the yaho's from getting to 65 terrorizing zones and giving our class a mud reputation. aka caster wants a mana batery lamer to 2 box....or whatever else.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Listen SONY!! if you are gonna nerf this....reduce the range then make EN give it back for 65s.  You have been warned, but go ahead and experiment with some stupidness.

				<td colspan="2"><span>If they were to nerf AoE kiting, I would suggest limiting the mobs affected to 4 mobs like with other classes that kite (i.e. quad kite).  In comparison to chant kiting high level mobs that you can't charm, I think AoE 4 mobs is still faster.  
<br />

<br />
CHANT kiting one mob
<br />
4 chants w/ IM2/TDoK lvl 65
<br />
4x140 = 560 per tick
<br />

<br />
AoE kiting 4 mobs
<br />
4 AoE songs w/ IM2/LotH lvl 65
<br />
49+46+78+98 = 271 x 4mobs = 1084 per tick
<br />
assuming every song lands.
<br />

<br />
Now if you are down to only landing about 50% of the damage per tick while AoE kiting, then you are basically doing the same amount of damage as chant kiting.
<br />

<br />
Now for charmable mobs, swarm kiting will probably the best kiting method.
<br />

<br />
I wonder how this damage per tick compares to other kiting classes (i.e. wizards, druids, necros, shamans...)</span></td>

Quadding is irrelevant.  Since when did quadding become the standard to live by.  Make me kill 4 in a row, and I want some freaking casters abilities like root or some invis undead&gt;????see the point.  I am a Bard!  Other classes have things we don't have....it is called balance.  NOT measured by how many aa you have, but how usefull the 100aa warior is compared to a 800aa bard or a 300aa wizzy.  The bard with aa is just a bard.  Would you rather be a healer with 300aa or a bard with 900aa....if any crackhead says the cleric your arguement is freaking wrong....Is there massive ammounts of bards on your server???This is the measure of balance, the overpowered easy to play classes have the most of them in circulation...this is the only measure.  Supply and demand,  Whatever, if no one play the class, how freaking overpowered can it be.
<br />

<br />
We are bards and killing 10 mobs at once does not make us anything but a bard with more aa than a rogue maybe.  The goal is not to be max aa, it is to be usefull, and the bard needs the aa to be usefull when crap like EB5 costs nearly 100aa.  All of our aa abilities are crazy expensive since they know we can make aa quicker.</span></td>

The only time I have ever used AE songs in melee was on one Ldon where we had an uber bard that twisted 7 songs and I played 4 AE dots.  That was the only time ever.
<br />

<br />
These songs need to remain &quot;Useful&quot;.  Nerfing their range down to melee is not useful.  Unless you guys have some secrets to share.  
<br />

<br />
AE kiting takes practice, saccrifice (few learning deaths), and skill.  Maybe some of you can run circles for hours but I can't.  AE kiting is good XP but at a high cost.

				<td colspan="2"><span>  I am highly curious how an uber bard can twist 7 songs at once. It has been my experience that 4 is hard to uphold (but possible, depending on the songs involved). I know I surely cannot hold 7 with a continuation of the songs involved, no matter their name. Of course, I am discounting the clicky thing, any twink can pull some serious gear in for their Bard. 
<br />

<br />
   I suppose I would be happy to hear of the twink gear involved, and happy to bow to the first that will carry 7 songs without a clicky. Maybe that is where I am confused? Could someone please tell me where my &quot;hacking&quot; problem is?
<br />

<br />
I guess I should mention my bard is 51 and in no way twinked, just play my songs as I see fit depending on the players I choose to group with. I will also mention I have not been impressed with the majority of twink Bards I have met, and they give the idiots like me a really bad name in my limited experience. And it is always a pleasure to meet the true bard, so much can be learned.

   A few things bug me about the whole AE ordeal:
<br />

<br />

<br />
1.  Why have AE at all if it isn't meant to be used?
<br />

<br />
2.  Why have zones that are clearly designed for AE purposes nerfed when all the non-AE classes whine?
<br />

<br />

<br />
   Another thing is that people like to complain without knowing the risk vs. reward.   I remember people bitching when an enchanter soloed the dragon in WL, when shamans were soloing WW dragons, etc.   Did these people even understand what it entailed to accomplish the task?  No.    Were tons of people of that particular class doing it?   No. 
<br />

<br />
   Everyone just wants to bring down another class that might be able to do more solo than the class they play. 
<br />

<br />
   If you can get a semi-decent group you can usually blow through more EXP/AA EXP than the average soloer can no problemo.
<br />

<br />
   I'm all for the bard class being more interesting to play in many aspects, but if they take away a lot of the soloing techniques I'll bet that the bard population will further dwindle.
<br />

<br />
   Regarding twisting, there are several articles that outline how many songs can in theory be twisted.    Even if you do some simple digging around you'll see that there aren't songs that will last in succession to allow for many to be sustained.

				<td colspan="2"><span>One thing about 'limiting the mobs affected to 4 mobs like with other classes that kite'...
<br />
Actually all classes work the same, there are targeted AEs that alow you to stay outside of hit range, but those are limited to 4. (We got Desperate Dirge in that line of spells/songs.)
<br />
And there are point blankAEs that dont have a restriction in the number of targets.
<br />
Making a bard the only class with a restriction on PBAEs would be a bit strange in my opinion. The main difference between a bard and a caster is the bard's ability to run and cast at the same time, allowing him to cast, stay in AE range *and* not get hit. Restricting the number of targets on PBAE would unblance the game in a way it shouldn't be in my opinion. You would fix one mistake in game with another one.
<br />
From my point of view, the only real way to get rid of pure AE Bards would be (as I read in some posts already) fixing the Mob AI. For example programmers could code in some irregularities in mobs pathing. Let a mob run slower sometimes, let them chose different ways, let them pause etc. All this would easily dispatch any afk AE Kiter and make the game much less artificial and lively. (From a roleplaying point of view: The strange thing isnt a bard running and singing at the same time, the strange thing isnt a bard being able to harm a lot of monsters at the same time with his songs, the really strange thing is that not a single mob no matter how stupid it might be would always run after the bard in the same little circle.) One caster in a swarm can disrupt AE Kiting already when it stops at the wrong point of time and gets a bash in. Let melee mobs do the same and the problem should be solved.

   I also see a lot of complaining about 'weekend bards'.   At this stage in the game, you should probably have about 5 alts if you've been playing for a long time.   Couple that in with lower levels being able to get crazy experience as compared to the original and first few expansions allows anyone with barely any skill at all to level to 65 in a very short amount of time.
<br />

<br />
   Why does it matter if low levels can or can't AE?   All these skills have been there for a long time and they scale to higher levels where in the last few years people have started to become concerned with them ( AE and charm ) because of the inherent mudflation that makes the mobs and PCs stronger.   As an enchanter I could charm effectively at level 12 and do quite well, but who cares?    The same goes for several other classes at lower levels.
<br />

<br />
   The majority of the players in this game are high level, so what benefit is there in trying to keep people in lower levels for extended periods of time?   Reaching 65 isn't some huge deal that should reward players greatly.   Pretty soon the cap will be level 70 and beyond and it won't take anymore skill than reaching level 2 did.
<br />

<br />
   To play the game as any class takes very little skill on average.   To accomplish certain things solo/duo or with smaller numbers does take cooperative skill, but to play as well as to not being recognized as a 'weekend' player of any class doesn't take much skill at all.
<br />

<br />
   If the majority of players want a nerf to bard AE then they should get a major positive change in return.
<br />

<br />
   If you look at the history of bards and AEing in general, I very highly doubt that anything will be done.    I don't anticipate a major change to how songs work, how bards AE as compared to any other class that has AE spells, etc.     These issues aren't new by any stretch of the imagination.
<br />

<br />
   Changing AI would be interesting, but at this point I highly doubt they'll be changing much of the AI for the standard zone exp mobs.   I recall them making sweeping changes in the AI to caster mobs a few years back and the first iteration was a disaster.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Brialla, uber bards do not twist 7 songs.  They are much smarter than that.  They twist 4 and usually 3 songs...with the smarts to know which 3 or 4 actually are needed at any time.  Have different song sets that can be quickly loaded since saved.
<br />

<br />
Do not strive to sing more than 4, strive to sing the right ones at the right times.  Strive to be able to pull singles, doubles, triples or whatever is needed.  Strive to be able to accomplish exceptional things with your fade and songs.
<br />

<br />
I respect bards that keep 5 songs up at once, but it is 10% of the job.  All the credit gets dumped in the toilet if they screw up the other 90%.
<br />

<br />
75% of the time I sing 3 solid.  25% I sing 4, knowing that I can afford to let 1 of the songs drop out once in a while (like mana).  Have to be picky about which three are constant and which gets the drop.  Rarely I sing 5, but it is only in groups where we are 200% better than what is needed.  To sing 5 in a group where you are actually needed for sucess is likely bad judgement and setting the group up for a wipe....unless there are 2 bards and you are the dps bard.
<br />

<br />
50% of your glory will come from consitant CC in various situations.  Soloing can get you self satisfaction occasionaly when you go deep in a kos dungeon and take out some targets that leave almost zero margin for error.
<br />

<br />
There are times when you might even save the day by taking a wack of mobs and using your skilled kiting tactics to get adds/mobs off the raid.  A highly skilled Kiter makes Mitheral Marr, and the BOT boss Agnarr and friends a joke raid.  (throw in the HOH cronies flag mobs as well)
<br />

<br />
Anyway, no one has ever said to me,  &quot;Moose you are slacking with a 3 song, can't you fit in 4 or 5?&quot;  &quot;Instead I hear...OMG I can not believe we are still alive after that mob gated and brought 6 friends back&quot;
<br />

<br />
I respect chanters yes, but when you don't have one..you are the CC.  Too bad they nerfed our Lull, but then again it separates the greats from the average.

				<td colspan="2"><span>  Thanks Moose, but that was actually my (tongue in cheek) point. I certainly would not consider myself uber, but I was twisting my songs long before I knew that the technique had a name. I easily twist 3 solo, with an occassional 4 for healing, but find (due to my lack of exp in grouping) that I tend to drop the songs in pick-up groups. Mainly because the groups tend to expect me to chat in battle for some reason.
<br />

<br />
   My bard was started pre-luclin (I play lots of other games at times and sometimes I just tend to real life). I have spent 95% of my time solo and rarely have I run into another bard. Although, lately, I have begun to run into a lot of bards that, that....well, I will be nice and just shut up<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />.
<br />

<br />
I also do not mass Aoe kite (sorry, but I consider it an exploit myself) which will help explain why I did not go from 1 to 51 in 5 days.
<br />

<br />
   I just found the post odd about the &quot;uber&quot; bard twisting seven 7 songs at once and wondered if I missed something involving clickies. I did not think I had, but it never hurts to ask.

Hes on Seventh Hammer think his names Cackit sp?  Good guy just met him.  He said hes an old school player just came back and was sort of showin off for us.  I was impressed that he could do 7.
<br />

<br />
  During the fights of course you cannot manage that.  I think he ran 5ish on average.  He was workin hard and havin fun.
<br />

<br />
  I can do 5 max and that's with twisting in the long lasting buff song (dance of blades).  He managed 7 I am guessing with spell haste and clickies.  He put up the first 5 like I would then he did a couple quick cast clickies.  Ornate legs have 1 second cast selos.
<br />

<br />
Bottom line... he does not do it constantly throughout the entire ldon, but I did watch him put up 7 and hold it a couple rounds.

<br />
Well of course you can twist more songs using the different amounts of time songs last. For example a nice 5 song twist at lvl 60 is
<br />
1. Amplification
<br />
2. Verses of Victory
<br />
3. Niv's Harmonic
<br />
4. Cantata of Replenishment
<br />
5. Warsong of the Vah Shir
<br />
with extended duration on Amplification and WotVS
<br />
you can twist 1234523412345234....
<br />
And only drop WotVS for a few seconds before it land again.
<br />
This is what I still consider a 5 song twist.
<br />
Landing DoTs is another issue and you can land 5 constantly.
<br />
But singing Selo's Chorus, Clicking Levitate, using RoT and a few other things to get &quot;X Songs at the same&quot; isn't really what I consinder twisting.
<br />
What I consider twisting is what will be shown in the short duration buff box (and songs on enemies as long as they follow the short duration standards). 
<br />
With items such as <a target="_new" href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=5156">http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=5156</a> and it's insta clickie Niv's Melody of Preservation,
<br />
you can add another song to your twist. But please don't ask my why you would twist 7 songs else as for the purpose of showing off.
<br />
As Moose said, you detect a bards value seeing if he twists the right songs at the right time, not seeing how many he can twist at maximum if undisturbed.

In regards to what did sony intend when they created the songs?  I dont really care what they intended, alot of tools are used differently now then they were originally intended.  Sony never intended clerics to be casting complete heal on MT every 2 seconds (from multiple clerics) when they first created it.. but it happens.  Should this be nerfed?  Lets make it so that if a complete heal landed on a character then they cant have another for 10 seconds.  That would fit more in line with what sony thought when they made the spell.  (No, I am not suggesting this happen)  If we only used the tools given to us in the way they were intended, we would have very little to think about during the game.  
<br />

<br />
There should be no nerf whatsoever,  especially since this has been going on since day 1 of bards, waiting 5+ years to nerf something is just ridiculous.  If they do nerf it, they should also nerf cleric druid chanter etc lines of pbae nukes and stuns.

Fair enough.... the very nature of the song shows it was meant to be used on multiple mobs.... although I'm sure they thought it would be a last ditch tactic or would mean sucuide for the singer..... *OR* it's possible they made it to be a dangerous way to get experience.... bunch of mobs following you around and your on the verge of death.  Maybe, they just couldn't see anyone getting very good as people have using it as sucessfully as they have.

Also true and Sony took this to the next extreme.... actually building encounters that could not be beaten using a simple chain... I'd say they almost embraced the idea of the way CH was being used.

Now don't get me wrong.... I don't want a nerf either.  But, I know SOE lurks here and if they had decided to make a change (as all the other threads discussing things going on on test might show something is coming, shorter range then 30 makes this completely unviable) I would much rather they make one like I suggested.... or others in the thread have suggested other more acceptible corrections then range &lt; 30 .... IF they were going to change it.  Would it be brutal after 5 years certainly.... have they done something like this in the past.... certainly.

I guess to summarize.  If I'm going to be pushed off a 50 ft. cliff I'd much rather land in water then on concrete.  <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif" border="0" alt="Big Smile" hspace="2" /> </span></td>

     I am still looking for the passage I know I have read in Eqdiva's forums somewhere, and I am going to assign the quote I am looking for to Kocho (although I very well could be wrong on the original poster!).  Because I cannot find the exact phrase, I am going to paraphrase what I seem to remember and hope someone remembers this particular reference.
<br />

<br />
   &lt;quote&gt; Who knew (in the beginning) what could be done by the bard &lt;/quote&gt;
<br />

<br />
I had gathered from several weeks of reading (prior) that she was referring to the Fansy days, the character that by all accounts seemed to have changed the rules of a server (and a game) for a variety of reasons. Since this character dates to 2001, 2 or so years after the start of Eq, I am a little unclear as to how an AoE nerf affects players that have played for five years. Forgive me, but I am coming from the position assuming that no-one at start-up of EQ knew the full potential of AoE versus a social-swarming type of MoB. I am also pre-luclin so am sure Aoe kiting was NOT common leveling technique.
<br />

<br />
   And from everything I have read of the Eq designers positions they never intended one class to level from 1 to 65 in the matter of Real Life hours. I have had bards brag lately to me they have gained 6 levels that day, I have tracked one, he seemed to be lying but you all offer a decent amount of opposite testimony.
<br />

<br />
I also have to disagree with any caster nerf that parralles a possible Bard nerf. No pure caster can cast and run at the same time, so it is, in my opinion, a moot argument. There is no way to compare a Bards casting abilities and nerfs to a pure caster because WE CAN RUN AND CAST. They cannot. One may argue creduously a nerf on a pure caster only by comparing them to a pure caster and then, secondarily, adding the comparison to a bard's exp leveling, and then one must begin taking in account other classes leveling time. 
<br />

<br />
   From what I can tell, I think bards may want to hush on the whole caster comparison lest they start being compared to Warriors instead<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />

Should they have nerfed it? Probably not in the way they did... I like the target idea... since they can fix our pbae's to work similarly to a caster... add us back the code to move and land on targets, but make the maxtargets=10 or somethin.

				<td colspan="2"><span>7 song twist is mathmaticaly impossible using songs gems.
<br />
5 song twist is possibe with NO missed notes and perfect timing, but all 5 wont stay up all the time, song 1 will only be up a second after song 5 lands, more often then not (75% of time at least) you will have 4 songs up.
<br />
4 song twist is doable, but with missed notes and human error, I would say that about about a 3rd of the time you will have 3 songs up rather then 4.
<br />

<br />
With clicky song items, even insta clicky, you have to lose a song from a twist to ckick them.  
<br />
With a BoH, I personally have had 6 group songs (not Amp or Selos) up for a second or two in my window.  But that wasnt in combat, that was just messing around forming up for a raid.  I dont mess around in groups or raids, I usually do a 4 song twist, and often am HoS, RoT, Mezzing or snaring so that a lot of times I have NO group songs up.
<br />

<br />
I dont care how many insta clickes you have, you arent gettign 7,6, or even 5 normal duration songs up and KEEPING them up for any length of time.  And if for some reason you ARE, then you arent doing anything else....</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Moose, I admire your spunk but on the subject of AE songs I would strongly Disagree.  I see the removeable of Bard AE songs a result of level 60+ bards kiting all the mobs in a given zone.  I've seen an impressive 30 mob kiting done and sure was impressive but it is probably the reason why us lower level bard now pay the price.  
<br />

<br />
  My Bard just hit 39th was 1 gold into 38th when they removed AE kiting.  I never had any of this kiting of more than 4 mobs(heck kite 4 walrus in EW and if Temp wears off 4 hits can mean not only song disruption but stunning and a fast death).  
<br />

<br />
  I think the Bard AE songs should be fully restored up to 46th level.  Why 46th you ask? The Planes shouldn't be kite zones or have a balance like Magicians(Call of the Heroes) doesn't work in X zones.  Have AE songs no longer able to work on moving targets in X zones.  This would eliminate Bard out-balancing, and as for your comment on Bard's with XXX AA's... my main is a Magician... the most nerfed class in EQ 90% of a Magician's spells have limitation... summoned gear is usable by X class, Mod Rods and Mana Sticks are Lore Items, no Drop, AND have a 5 minute re-use timer on them, Rain Spells that cannot be used without killing yourself, LoS spells that can be blocked for partial or no damage from obstacles or other players, AA's such as MGB or Advanced Pet Discipline /pet nospell (oh yeah I summoned a fire pet now I want him to just melee...uh yeah and I want a bard to not play songs and become a Main tank). My old main is a Rogue SoS will be cool once I'm able to get it but NOTHING in game is as powerful as a Bard using Fading Memories. Wanna talk about the most POWERFUL AA in existance... you just aggro'd half a zone activate Selo's get a distance and Hit the Panic Button &quot;FADING MEMORIES&quot; poof you go invisible Drop ALL Aggro and can resume doing whatever you want.  
<br />

<br />
  I love playing my Bard and would love it if my AE songs once again had the normal effect and simply only affected stationairy targets in the Planes or Zones Sony feels AE songs become completely unbalancing.  Don't attack me yet.... these same zones ALSO would make Druid, Necro, and Wizard DoT's unfunctional as well... hey if Sony wants to PLAY FAIR then so be it Attack the druids(Sony's Favorite Class) and limit them as well.  But I do agree on most of what you say Moose just not on lower levels getting handicapped... this is when a Bard is learning to be Uber, once past 60 the fact that you are still playing your Bard means you have Uber skills and can kill more eefectively as a group player and AE more effectively stationairy targets.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Dyn, it is the lower lvl bards &quot;powerleveling&quot; through the levels that are the real issue now, they nerfed the ability to gain the 7 aa's in PoV from kiting the whole zone, they have nerfed HoH kiting etc. You gain more lvls and more exp doing this at lower lvls compared to higher levels.  As for kiting huge mobs in planes?  At lower lvls you can kite many things and live if you get caught, at higher lvls if that number of mobs catches you, you are dead.  PoP being AE'ed at 46???? since when?  most still do Dulak and such at that level.  PoP is generally what the lvl 65's would have done for aa's not as often regular exp.

<br />
As for FM being overpowering?  Yes i can see how its so much better than FD in every way since it works excellent on see invis mobs!  And it costs absolutly no mana!</span></td>
