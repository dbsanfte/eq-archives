			align="right" vspace="2" border="0">To get the bottom half of you need to 
		give Konia Swiftfoot Mahlin's Bongos. To start this, you learn about a little 
		girl who never got her doll and was hurt by a bad man. You don't actually need 
		to do anything in this part of the quest, but if you'd like to learn the 
		background, read up on <A href="epic.aspx?p=mystery">Detail on Braenar and his 
			daughter Serra</A>.
	</P>
<P>Talk to Braenar Swiftsong. Braenar is located in South Karana next to the well at 
		loc (-21, 88).
		<BR>
		<BR>
		<B>You say,</B> 'hail Baenar Swiftsong'<BR>
		<B>Baenar Swiftsong says</B> 'Please, I am trying to work here. If you bother 
		me I will write a horrible song about you and sing it from the mountain tops!
		<BR>
		<B>You say,</B> 'what doll'<BR>
		<B>Baenar Swiftsong says</B> 'What's that you say? You wish to have the doll I 
		was to give her? Whatever for? Bah! Nevermind me. I rant like an old woman 
		sometimes. I should let her memory go but I would stop my heart from beating 
		before I forget that child. Here, take this invoice. I have no further use for 
		it. Give it to Marfen Binkdirple.<BR>
		<EM>[You receive 'Solusek Mining Company Invoice']</EM>&nbsp;<BR>
		<BR>
		Go to Solusek A and give the gnome vendor, Marfen the invoice and you will 
		receive a doll. Marfen is the same vendor who sells the Tinkerer's bags, he is 
		found at loc (-304, -1083).
		<BR>
		<EM>[Hand the Invoice to Marfen.]</EM><BR>
		<B>Marfen Binkdirple says</B> 'Ah! 'Bout time ye got yer lazy bones down here! 
		I was beginnin' ta worry bout ya. Thought ye'd never pick the doll up. Me kin 
		worked and toiled over this thing fer days. That Baenar was sure exact in every 
		detail. For a special child, he said. Must be some child. He spent all he had 
		and some he didn't. Still owes us a show! Anyway, I heard she passed away some 
		time ago. Give the lad muh regards.
		<BR>
		<EM>[Marfen hands you a 'Mechanical Doll']</EM></P>
<P>Take the doll to the Estate of Unrest and give the doll to Serra, who is next to 
		the gnomish speulunker. She can be found by going through a underwater channel 
		at the right side of the zone. Serra will give you a note.
		<BR>
		<EM>[Hand Serra Mechanical Doll]</EM><BR>
		<B>Serra says </B>'Oh! You have the dolly! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! I 
		can go home now. Please give this to my father, Baenar. He will understand when 
		he gets it.' Serra begins to fade away. 'Bye bye!'
		<BR>
		<EM>[You receive 'Note for Baenar']</EM><BR>
		<BR>
		Then take the note from Serra back to Braenar, who will give a new note for 
		Maligar.
		<BR>
		<EM>[Hand Baenar 'Note for Banear']</EM><BR>
		<B>Baenar Swiftsong says</B> 'A note from the child? How can that be! How could 
		she know I was her father? Unless? Cyrah told her. Forgive me. Cyrah was the 
		name of the woman to whom I was betrothed. Unfortunately her parents forbade 
		her from marrying a lowly bard such as myself. Her father married her off to a 
		young merchant in Qeynos named Maligar. She married him only out of respect to 
		her father. Her heart was truly mine, at least, so she always said. When Serra 
		was born, I visited them both often. She was like no other, so innocent and 
		sweet. In those few years I watched her grow up to be more and more like her 
		mother and I saw none of the father in her appearance. I do not like Maligar, 
		but the least we can do is inform him of his child's death. I saw his caravan 
		pass by not more than a day ago headed to Qeynos.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		<IMG alt="Maligar&amp;apos;s Enraged Dopplganger" hspace="2" src="/Images/epic/EnragedMaligar.jpg"
			align="right" vspace="2" border="0"> Take the note from Braenar to Maligar. 
		Maligar is found in West Karana at loc (1179, -10878). His spawn is every 30 
		minutes or so, not bad, if you mess up (turn the head into the wrong guy), you 
		can try again in a bit. After you give Maligar the note, he will spawn his 
		Maligars Enraged Doppleganger.<BR>
		<BR>
		<B>Side Note:</B> This part of the quest was broken early April 2001, but is 
		reported to have been fixed.</B>
		<BR>
		<BR>
		<B>Maligar says</B> 'Hmmm. What's this? A note from that silly bard Baenar? I 
		wasn't aware that those of his kind could write, much less read.' Maligar lets 
		out a deep laugh. 'I see you do not share my sense of humor. Let's read it, 
		shall we? Oh, no! She's dead? I knew that already, you fool. It was by my hand 
		she died! Ooops! Did I let that slip out? Silly me. I guess I will have to kill 
		you now!'<BR>
		<BR>
		Updates made! As of early 2002, Maligar no longer blinds, he does cast boil 
		blood dot, Harm Touch, and nukes. Reports have come in saying that charming is 
		no longer required. His faction is indifferent with you. Bards have soloed, 
		duoed, and grouped to get him.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
		<P>Here's how my experience went, though now outdated: Maligar and his whole camps 
			faction can be changed using lvl 11 song, Cinda's Charismatic Carillon, 
			especially effective using the Dark Elf mask, I've heard it doesn't work 
			without one. I was told at the time to charm him, so my experience is below...
			<BR>
			<BR>
			When I killed Maligar and his Doppleganger, it was myself, a 47 bard, a 51 
			bard, a 53 wizzie, and a 45 druid. We pulled Maligar's friends first, who went 
			down easily one by one. They do not aggro if you pull one by one. Then we 
			charmed Maligar, ordered him to sit down, his Doppleganger spawned, and even 
			though I was twisting resist songs, we still were blinded. If your Magic Resist 
			is high enough (like over 150 MR) and you're high enough level, you should 
			resist being blinded. I did resist the Fear spell though. As of September 2001, 
			I hear reports that he no longer blinds, so maybe he was nerfed a bit...
			<BR>
			<BR>
			Anyway back when I did Maligar, I had my chants memmed, since I knew I was 
			going to be blinded, so I had my target, and hopefully was able to get him a 
			few times with my DoTs. From what I heard from the druid helping us, was that 
			the Doppleganger was smart and blinded everyone he could. It was a very close 
			fight, we brought him down though, and then charmed Maligar again, and got our 
			second Maligar Doppleganger's head.
		</P>
	</BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR>Once you kill the doppleganger, loot his head. Unless 
you want to kill Maligar, you can run at this point to the zone. <BR><BR>Take

honor of Serra, the daughter that was denied to me in spirit, I vow never to 
play this instrument again! It was her favorite and she listened to me play for
