	<h4>Page 24 Bottom</h4>
	<img src="/images/epic/imgEpicBaenarSwiftsong.jpg" alt="Baenar Swiftsong" border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="right">To get the bottom half of you need to give Konia Swiftfoot Mahlin's Bongos. Talk to Braenar Swiftsong. Braenar is located in South Karana next to the well at loc (-21, 88). He will give you an invoice after you ask "What doll". (If you have any info on how a bard knew to talk about a doll, please let me know.)
<br><br>
<a href="default.asp?part=mystery">Detail on Braenar and his daughter Serra</a> - New additional page!
<br><br>
<b>You say,</b> 'hail Baenar Swiftsong'<br>
<b>Baenar Swiftsong says</b> 'Please, I am trying to work here.  If you bother me I will write a horrible song about you and sing it from the mountain tops! <br>
<b>You say,</b> 'what doll'<br>
<b>Baenar Swiftsong says</b> 'What's that you say?  You wish to have the doll I was to give her?  Whatever for?  Bah!  Nevermind me.  I rant like an old woman sometimes. I should let her memory go but I would stop my heart from beating before I forget that child.  Here, take this invoice.  I have no further use for it. Give it to Marfen Binkdirple. 
<br><br>
Go to Solusek A and give the gnome vendor, Marfen the invoice and you will receive a doll. Marfen is the same vendor who sells the Tinkerer's bags, he is found at loc (-304, -1083).
<br><br>
<b>Marfen Binkdirple says</b> 'Ah!  'Bout time ye got yer lazy bones down here!  I was beginnin' ta worry bout ya.  Thought ye'd never pick the doll up.  Me kin worked and toiled over this thing fer days.  That Baenar was sure exact in every detail.  For a special child, he said.  Must be some child.  He spent all he had and some he didn't.  Still owes us a show!  Anyway, I heard she passed away some time ago.  Give the lad muh regards. 
<br><br>
Take the doll to the Estate of Unrest and give the doll to Serra, who is next to the gnomish speulunker. She can be found by going through a underwater channel at the right side of the zone. Serra will give you a note.
<br><br>
<b>Serra says </b>'Oh!  You have the dolly!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  I can go home now.  Please give this to my father, Baenar.  He will understand when he gets it.'  Serra begins to fade away.  'Bye bye!' 
<br><br>
Then take the note from Serra back to Braenar, who will give a new note for Maligar.
<br><br>
<b>Baenar Swiftsong says</b> 'A note from the child?  How can that be!  How could she know I was her father?  Unless? Cyrah told her.  Forgive me.  Cyrah was the name of the woman to whom I was betrothed.  Unfortunately her parents forbade her from marrying a lowly bard such as myself.  Her father married her off to a young merchant in Qeynos named Maligar.    She married him only out of respect to her father.  Her heart was truly mine, at least, so she always said.  When Serra was born, I visited them both often.    She was like no other, so innocent and sweet.  In those few years I watched her grow up to be more and more like her mother and I saw none of the father in her appearance.  I do not like Maligar, but the least we can do is inform him of his child's death.  I saw his caravan pass by not more than a day ago headed to Qeynos. <br><br>
Take the note from Braenar to Maligar. Maligar is found in West Karana at loc (1179, -10878). His spawn is every 30 minutes or so, not bad, if you mess up (turn the head into the wrong guy), you can try again in a bit. After you give Maligar the note, he will spawn his Maligars Enraged Doppleganger.<br><br>
<b>Side Note:</b> This part of the quest was broken early April 2001, but is reported to have been fixed.</b>
<br><br>
<b>Maligar says</b> 'Hmmm. What's this?  A note from that silly bard Baenar?  I wasn't aware that those of his kind could write, much less read.'  Maligar lets out a deep laugh.  'I see you do not share my sense of humor.  Let's read it, shall we?  Oh, no!  She's dead?  I knew that already, you fool.  It was by my hand she died!  Ooops!  Did I let that slip out?  Silly me.  I guess I will have to kill you now!'
<br><br>
Maligar and his whole camps faction can be changed using lvl 11 song, Cinda's Charismatic Carillon, especially effective using the Dark Elf mask, I've heard it doesn't work without one. I was told at the time to charm him, so my experience is below...
<br><br>
When I killed Maligar and his Doppleganger, it was myself, a 47 bard, a 51 bard, a 53 wizzie, and a 45 druid. We pulled Maligar's friends first, who went down easily one by one. They do not aggro if you pull one by one. Then we charmed Maligar, ordered him to sit down, his Doppleganger spawned, and even though I was twisting resist songs, we still were blinded. If your Magic Resist is high enough (like over 150 MR) and you're high enough level, you should resist being blinded. I did resist the Fear spell though. As of September 2001, I hear reports that he no longer blinds, so maybe he was nerfed a bit...
<br><br>Anyway back when I did Maligar, I had my chants memmed, since I knew I was going to be blinded, so I had my target, and hopefully was able to get him a few times with my DoTs. From what I heard from the druid helping us, was that the Doppleganger was smart and blinded everyone he could. It was a very close fight, we brought him down though, and then charmed Maligar again, and got our second Maligar Doppleganger's head. 
<br><br>
Once you kill the doppleganger, loot his head. Unless you want to kill Maligar, you can run at this point to the zone. 
<br><br>
Take the head back to Braenar and receive "Mahlin's Bongo's".<br><br>
<b>Baenar Swiftsong says</b> 'That vile dog!  I knew there was something not right with him, the way he stared at everyone with contempt!  Even his own wife!  I curse him!  I curse him to stay upon the realm and deny him what he most desires!  This is too much!  I cannot play or write this day.  The sadness overwhelms me.  In honor of Serra, the daughter that was denied to me in spirit, I vow never to play this instrument again!  It was her favorite and she listened to me play for hours on end.  Here take it!  Take it out of my sight!  Leave me be with my grief and my loss. 
<br><br>
Take the Bongo's to Konia Swiftfoot in West Karana to get the bottom of Page 24. 
<b>Konia Swiftfoot says</b> 'Mahlin's bongos!  Here, take the other half of the sheet music. I can not really make out what the signature was anyway.
