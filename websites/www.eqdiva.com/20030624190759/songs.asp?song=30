<b>New Rules for XP with Pets! - </b>7/2/02 1:29:02 PM<br>~ <b>Klapton Groovemaster</b><blockquote>To get the proper XP when charm soloing, you MUST inflict some damage yourself on the mob.  Charm, /pet attack, F1 twice to ensure your pet is targeted for recharm, then Chords, DDD.  Back off then as far as you can within sight with charm song on.  Space permitting, your pet will recharm before he gets to you.  Also, once he is on the mob, back off just enough to be out of the target mobs range, but still close enough to AE zap em.<br><br>It takes practice, and you must be able to switch instruments as you twist.  See some of the quality twisting guides available online.<br><br>Klapton Groovemaster<br>37 Rock Legend<br>Vazaelle Server</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Other strategies - </b>2/2/02 12:25:03 AM<br>~ <b>Aeronica Songweaver</b><blockquote>When charming kiting, apply songs like Largo's Melodic Binding or Brusco's Boastful Bellow to the mob your pet is attacking.  Be sure to keep your distance.  The reason why I have done this instead of charming the winning mob is because I have found that if I switch a charm target, the mob that was charmed will attack me and it becomes difficult to get mob off.<br>If I apply largo's to one mob and the charm breaks on my pet, I only have one mob to worry about.  Just re-charm pet, order it to attack other mob, and re-apply Largo's.  I find this strategy most useful against even con'd mobs because I know they are same level.  You can't be 100% sure of level if mob is con'd blue.  My charisma is 121 and wind skill is maxxed.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Great for many occasions... - </b>1/26/02 6:20:09 PM<br>~ <b>Fluellen Cadwaladr</b><blockquote>For some time, since I simply couldn't get the hang of charm-kiting, I used this to charm adds in battle, which was an adequate use.<br><br>After that, I began mixing it in with my all-instruments aoe attack--CoD, DDD, heal, charm whatever's attacking me, press ESC (new mob will be my target), CoD, DDD, heal... this was actually fairly effective in groups of high greens, but not really all that great.<br><br>Finally got the hang of charm kiting from 38 to 39 in Great Divide, against Drakkel Dire Wolves, and I must say it worked well.  I had best luck with the &quot;charm, run past uncharmed and take a hit, heal with lute, heal with lute, recharm, repeat&quot; technique, then polished off the remaining critter with FCC/CoF.<br><br>But the &quot;ding&quot; that got my 39 was my first real experience with swarm-kiting--better late than never!  Target pet, charm, be whomped by many wolves; by the time charm breaks pet has taken significant damage--either charm for another round or switch to drum, FCC/CoF/selo's to kill the ex-pet, then start again.  I was able to solo six drakkel dire wolves at once in this fashion, and while I did finish the experiment with only 1.5 bubbles of health, the XP and faction was fantastic.<br><br>Just got the charm &quot;upgrade&quot; at 39 and it does seem to burn mana pretty quickly--no matter, but it's a concern and something to watch for.<br><br>Still, the charm series can be fantastic both in and out of groups.  In groups, I STRONGLY encourage you to use a &quot;charming&quot; macro which lets your group know what mob you're charming; your melee types will thank you for not confusing them, and the casters will love you for not burning their mana.<br><br>:Fluellen Cadwaladr:<br></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Very funny exchange in Oasis - </b>1/21/02 2:24:51 AM<br>~ <b>Anon</b><blockquote>I was in Oasis today, and a level 12 SK was badgering me about how weak bards are.  We had a discussion about Duelling, and I told him that I would when I was higher level (me being an 18th level bard).  I told him that it didn't matter how strong he was, that bards could charm him and make him attack a sand giant or something.  He said this was unfair, and shouted for confirmation that this was no way to duel.  About 5 people in zone responded, all saying that all is fair in duelling.  One even suggested a new technique: charm him, sing EB song, then take him underwater to drown him.  I was FOFLMAO.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>in answer for comment down here... - </b>1/17/02 12:35:01 AM<br>~ <b>Laya</b><blockquote>well... guess most necros are just like that... well some of em... anyway.<br><br>This song is awesome for crowd control as sooo many time stated, preventing KS, doing KS if you're a bad boy and Pling people till lvl 40 or so when you're in the 50's.  <br><br>how to PL? I don't know if it has been written down earlier but I will again.  The song kinda erase the exp priority that is built up when you hit a mob (as the one that did the most damage to that mob get the exp when it dies) so you can easily get something down on hp till it's pretty low, you charm, once it gets back to normal, you snare and let your pled friend get the kill :) <br><br>Simple, useful, awesome :)</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>This rocks when dueling around 30 - </b>1/6/02 4:54:11 AM<br>~ <b>Rultrovos Lendroma</b><blockquote>I was in IceClad partnering cougars with my brother whos a 31 ranger while I am a 29 bard.  A necro asks for help and we take his add, then his pet dies and I help out by mezzing his pet then charming it(its health is at 27%) and helping it kill ours then breaking charm with hide and killing it so he gets exp.  He then complains to us in ooc to the entire zone about how I charmed his mob then killed it saying that we ksed him, I ask him if he got exp, he replies yes so therefore we didnt ks him.  Now he becomes an jackhole so I ask him if he wants to take to a duel.  He says he wont, then 15 minutes later while I am killing a cougar he accepts duel and starts dotting and snaring me, I got him bad but cause I was half health and had no real dueling songs memmed I got killed.  His dot killed me and I lost 3 blues of exp.  Time for revenge, I ask him for a reduel, I mem up guardian, purifying, selos, charm, mez, fear, and heal song.  Hes got his pet up so first thing I do is I equip my tambo and kick up selos, get far off and pet chases me, I fear pet and then run up to necro, mez him then charm him, then I run to gnomes and set him on Captain Nalot, boom nalot and gnomes all on his butt, I got selos up and run to tofs zone, then when he dies zone in to tofs and back out, he comes back and rants to the zone about how I did this and he lost exp, well I tell him I lost exp too and he says I didnt.  Well I end up contacting a guide about this cause the guy says I am gonna get warned.  Well I quote the guide - &quot;We can not do anything, it was between you and him in the duel, all goes.  So nothing happens.&quot;  Guy gets pissed off and trys to ks me, I notice this and charm  my mob, he trys to dot my mob and the gnomes chase after him.  Sweet revenge, what ya get for dueling a bard - and trying to ks him.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>effects - </b>1/4/02 12:08:35 PM<br>~ <b>Kocho Divah</b><blockquote>To the below question, your level relative to the mob, your charisma, your wind skill, will all determine whether a charm will stick or be resisted. As for an exact formula, we do not have. Its been debated how much charisma a bard really needs.<br><br>I myself use Charm (the higher level charm) alot at level 56. By this time, a few mobs are too high too charm (51+), but I find that out after trying it anyway. If they're charmable, I still get a few resists now and then. I have 180 charisma, Wind skill of 207 (yeah, need to max it out), and am always going to be more than a few levels above the mob.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>This song is deadly in deuls! - </b>11/23/01 4:40:57 PM<br>~ <b>Kimid Songweaver of the 31st Song of E'ci</b><blockquote>I was in Lake of Ill Omen a while ago, I was lv 28 and had just gotten this song and Crisson's Pixie Strike, and a Monk, also lv 28, was offering to deul, saying that no one could beat him.  I told him that bards are master deulers and he denied it, stating that his uber little monk could beat the snot out of me....  well, I had the Pixie Strike memmed, so I figured, what the heck... He challenged me, and right as I acepted I had a REALLY nasty idea... he was being a real jerk with his bragging, so I decided to take him out the HARD way lol.  I mezzed him with pixie strike, WALKED UP TO HIM AND SAT DOWN! and memmed Solon's.  I backed away and let the mez break and CHARMED him!  On his name, [LD] showed up.  That usually means he would be link dead, but I suppose it means he was successfully charmed.  Anyways, we were by the wind mill in LOIO, and I targetted the Professor, told him to attack, and got out my drum and RAN LIKE MAD.  He died, painfully I might add, and I escaped with the Professor REALLY mad at me.  I zoned and all was right with the world.  JERK, LOL!  To make matters worse, he lost lots of XP for it too. ;o)  Teach em to mess with us Bards!  Keep singing!</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Useful Situations - </b>11/21/01 4:52:00 PM<br>~ <b>Mikhalian Dantenius</b><blockquote>Well, i am still relativily new to this game, being a bard of the 28th song, and he being my main, but i think i have found a few helpful situations for this song.   First off in a group of mana eaters this song is great, if you do it correctly you can have one mob act as a surrogate tank, while the magic users nuke the other one.  whenever i use this song with casters there are always kudos afterwards, many of them did'nt even know this song existed.  The downside is that tanks HATE this song, well tanks that don't assist that is.  They don't catch on to the fact that one is my pet (even though i tell them before the battle that i will be charming one :b, and even have a macro button saying that i charmed one) and will just stand there staring at my pet trying to attack it while the main tank gets whalloped by the other mob in one on one(sigh). Oh well i hope that helps you all a bit, good luck and good hunting.<br><br>Mikhalian Dantenius(Cazic-Thule)<br>     Bard of the 28th Song</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Great song for soloing - </b>10/10/01 1:25:48 PM<br>~ <b>Mueril Mowadeeb</b><blockquote>This has to been one of the best songs we get for soloing.. Once i learned how to tell the mob to attack for me i have been in solo hevan. (</pet attack>while the crit u want it to attack is in your current target screen..)  I have mastered this technique now and love to solo.. To give u fellow bards a little hint on how good our charm songs are.  I will tell u that in Overthere i soloed through lvl 41 with this song in less than 5 hours.... I wish i would of been using this song for soloing when i got it.. Hinte for u &quot;use in open areas. charm mob have mob attack other mob. back away and put on your happy feet. once mob is uncharmed, quickly charm again while backing away. as soon as u get charm on tell mob to attack other mob again.. do this until u see one is going to die then charm the one thats winning and while the mob kills the other just use a damage song(bbb or fcc is more effective) on the dieing mob, and u should get all the exp for the kill. I now only use the upgrade charm song sence most mobs i attack is over 37.  Good luck to u all.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>Hehe, with this song, I don't even do anything.... - </b>5/8/01 11:53:00 AM<br>~ <b>Soulseekr</b><blockquote>This song is great. This is my strategy.<br><br>Charm one mob, send to fight another.

Anyways, after he beats down the mob, I continue to have him charmed and attack the next mob.<br><br>This is the great part, as my pet is almost dead (around 20% life), I switch off and charm the other mob, sometimes they both stand there confused... lol, but once the old pet breaks charm, I beat on him with my new pet.... and the cycle just goes on and on..... I didn't lift a finger for 5 lvls... hehe. But DOH, my skills in melee have suffered... hehe, who cares.<br><br>So for all you Divas out there that kill your pet after the fight.... don't, this is more fun, and less downtime... actually, its NO downtime....

<b>Great addition to the all-instrument attack. - </b>3/25/01 7:18:47 PM<br>~ <b>Tomias Wintersong</b><blockquote>Everyone knows what a great song this is... here's my strategy:<br><br>I use this song to pull some assistance while I'm twisting Chords (lvl2), Denons (lvl18), and Heal (lvl6). I keep my charmie as the target and area effect my intended victim. As soon as my target breaks cham, I twist charm into the lineup and continue on. Works wonders when swapping horn and lute! As soon as my vicitm drops, I continue my three song twist on my charmie, and soon after it follows the other to the grave.<br></blockquote></td></tr></table></blockquote><br><br><br><br>
