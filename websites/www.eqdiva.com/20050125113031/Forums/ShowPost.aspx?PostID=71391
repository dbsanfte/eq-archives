				<td colspan="2"><span>There are so many obvious things they could have addresses and havent. Im not sure why they will do anything now. look at our cap issue. We have to get very rare items to break the cap (much more rare than caster focus items) and then buy AA to make them useable. it has been argued that casters have to buy AA to get their crits but so do we (add up all our melee crits dot crits and spell crits) so I just cant see how this holds. The missed notes issue has never been officially settled and we dont know if they are gonna take the MOTP solution away or not. DPS issue has never been addressed even and if it wasnt for the lack of people playing it would make us a lot more udesireable for things like MPG trials. How can they not realize that our epic was unbalanced to begin with and now that their are fewer people on what is the chance tht a bard who could actually benefit from an epic is actually ever going to get one? If they need us to point these things out to them they are just frigging clueless.
<br />

<br />
       As a bard who has recently entered the EP's it seems that my resists are only occasionally of value, i can pull but so can monks and rangers and SK's, my CC abilities are so so and my DPS sux. My DS are puny compared to the mobs we fight and my mitigation seems awfully sucky for a plate class. i still have the mana song which we still need and I think the AC boost I give may help (still not sure about Niv's with its rune effect). I still enjoy getting together with my friends though so I will stay play a bit longer and certainly in a group situation i can fill in if there is a missing class. I am just skeptical that anything will be done when some of these issues have never been addressed at all.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I don't really want to admit that I've thrown in the towel just yet, but, lately, I'm finding many more reasons not to play (for all the reasons y'all have listed above and more).  I'm finding it harder and harder to actually convince myself to log on in the evenings anymore.
<br />

<br />
I'm just not sure that the &quot;grind&quot; is worth it anymore.  I've seen many others' posts on this board whom seem to share this sentiment (maybe to slightly more or lesser extents).  In the past 2-3 weeks, I've spent about 1-2 hours total on eq (helping a long time friend finish the 8th Coldain shawl).  I can't really say I've missed the game all that much.  That makes me a bit sad to say, but it's the truth.
<br />

<br />
From my perspective, and I'd classify myself just on the casual side of being a devoted eq player, the game started losing appeal (for me) around the GoD timeframe.  It has steadily gone downhill since then (OoW'ish timeframe).  I thouroughly enjoyed all previous expansions, but I can't really make that same claim (with any measureable conviction) for the GoD and OoW expansions.  I feel that my bard's value-add to my groups has decreased exponentially.  The bigest thing I bring to my groups now is my ability to pull well.  I'm just not sure that's enough anymore.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Why do people complain about our damage output? Proc some sort of haste on yourself, proc avatar, and sing 5 chants, swap your drum in as they land, and you'll be out damaging ANY other melee class. I outdamage entire groups doing this. If you're in a group, then direct damage output is not your role. Your usefullness comes from mana regen, spell focus, giving the best haste in the game, best resist debuffs in the game, best damage shield.. and the efficiency of your single, pre-slowed, pre-debuffed pulls, and capped resists. With my leadership, symphony of battle, and 3.3 Warmarch of Muram, I'm giving 250 or more attack to my group! Tank too weak for a named and you're pre-EP? Hit puretone and give him like 300 AC! That's crazy.

MT group bard, DS, AC, etc

AE bard, AE resists, mana etc

what is left after that.....melee dps.
<br />
adding more bards doesn't help much after the first one or 2 to cover needed roles, everyone else is DPS. in raids with lots of bards, or mobs that don't require resists or anything special for bard to do....we are just a halfassed melee class
<br />

i've decent weapons n aa's and only put out maybe 150dps all out full damage!!   i've some nice gear but even bazaar equiped class of other melee can do better then this.

basicly for having elem+ gear and 300ish AAs make us melee like a lower tier PoP melee class, give us something to conbribute when our songs are either covered or no required.

				<td colspan="2"><span>The usefulness of a bard in comparison to another class is completely relative to where you're fighting.  These days, the server population in general and of bards in specific is so low that we don't run into too many, but still many bard roles are unnecessary at the top end.
<br />

<br />
As melee DPS increasers, overhaste still improves things, but not as much as adding another melee class in our place.  The value of additional ATK has diminishing returns past a certain level and when all of your melees have 2500 ATK, adding 250 more isn't helping much.  
<br />

<br />
As caster DPS increasers, I can still give Eriki's to the pet classes and it helps some.  An additional *chance* at spell damage increases is nice but it's not nice enough to warrant giving a bard a raid spot instead of another wizard.
<br />

<br />
Looking at my songs, I feel like I should have a strong contribution to the raid as a debuffer.  But in reality the dots don't land because the mobs are too resistant so I shelve them and look for something else.
<br />

<br />
One bard for AE mana is enough.
<br />

<br />
AC is nice for tanks but when your MT has 2800 AC raid buffed, our extra 200 isn't changing the mob hits too much.  I've gone back to DS in tank groups half the time but that's paltry DPS in comparison to what a rogue, wizard, or even ranger can do.
<br />

<br />
Resists are next to meaningless with many of the resist adjustments in Omens.  Even when I'm capping resists at 600 for the members of my group with POV, Omens spells are still landing.  When AEs are doing 3000 DD on impact and 500 a tick, I wish I could add DoT Shielding or Spell Shielding and actually be useful.  But alas, I cannot.  
<br />

<br />
I know I have many options.  There are fights where I can cure but AEs land so often I can't make a dent on more than 1 person.  So why raid with a bard who can keep 1 person clean when a cleric can RC a whole group?  Heh, why not add group cure song to the Bardic Wish List, er Top 10 List.
<br />

<br />
On some raids, group DA is my most useful song.
<br />

<br />
In Omens, I don't have the same usefulness I did in PoP.  h*ll, I don't have the same usefulness I did in NToV.
<br />

<br />
I'm talking about raid usefulness.  I don't question my usefulness in groups because my sheer flexibility makes me wanted above other classes.  I can pull well, I can slow and not pull aggro off a lesser geared tank, resists matter against trash (read: groupable xp mobs), and so does overhaste and spell damage.
<br />

<br />
So if you're spending most of your time grouping and raiding things outside the top tiers, I can understand how you shake your head at the current crop of &quot;whiny bards.&quot;  But know if you plan to progress, you'll be glad we're here whining for change that hopefully will be in place by the time you get there.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Thanks Calli, and i think if you really pay attention you can see all of these things happening even in the lower tiers. Our DOT damage really sux compared to waht other classes have now. With my lowly TDOK and JF3 and IM4 I do 194 per tick. So we are talking only about 130 dps. By todays standards that is laughable and that assumes they all stick. I was carried thru a destruction trial by a friend and some of his buds. We just offtanked everything and killed like crazy. Even accounting for when my DS was on multiple mobs the group dps would have been better with another rogue or ranger. I guess if these had been lesser geared folks it would have mattered more.
<br />

<br />
      I am back to being the only bard on raids anymore most of the time and I find myself bagging AE resists as they just dont help very often. POV still seems to help sometimes but even when maxxing folks resists it seems the AE with anything at 300 or more neg resist check gets thru anyway. 
<br />

<br />
     Like Calli above I have given up on the cure songs as I can only cure one person at a time. So, at lvl 70 I am playing (on raids) HOS (old POP song), POV (old POP song), AE mana ( got the new one but i wonder how useful it is to bards post TIME), Niv's (Knark? Luclin? maybe even space invaders era?) or the new warmarch (Finally an OOW song, hard to think of AE mana as new). I am sorry but we just havent scaled up with everyone else. I would just like for our dps to be scaled up enough so that my group or raid doesnt take a hit by having me there. This can be done thru direct dps or by increasing the value of our songs. 
<br />

<br />
     I really will try to stop posting now on this topic. Anyone who has read the boards knows this is all old stuff. My final suggestion I guess would be that we tell SOE we have given them lists before and there has been essentially no response. What's different now? Either they just dont understand the way we play (e.g. they dont understand that adding 50 str on a song at lvl 68 is pretty useless most of the time) or they just don't really care. Lets face it if you are the dev in charge of bards it would take maybe an hour to troll these boards and get an idea of what the issues really are. I think i know when i am being strung along. So lets accept things as they are or move on as we do ahve other options now. no new lists til old issues (and some of these are realllllllly old) are addressed.

				<td colspan="2"><span>A bards contribution to the dps is not only what he puts out himself, but how he contributes to the overall dps of the group. Several classes can haste, you can get some one outside the group to haste. But only bards can boost 30% over the cap. With three or four melee, that's a lot of added dps right there. Not to mention the added nuke/dot focus which only we can add. For the serious melee dps classes, every +10 atk ais about +1dps. With warmarch I add close to 200 atk or +20dps for each of those monks, rogues, rangers. You think they don't like having us in their group? They go, whoot, we got a bard.
<br />

<br />
I went through destruction with an elemental group playing two PBAE songs (swapping in the lute when I could), Echo of Truslik and War March of Muram. With one mob in camp I swapped in mana/regen. I also dusted off the rarely used Denon's Desperate Dirge which I got off several times for a 575 * 3 or 4 mobs a blast.  
<br />

<br />
And I know I added more DPS to the groups total output then another monk could possibly have. And the PBAE and the slow meant less work for the cleric.
<br />

<br />
Groups don't &quot;carry&quot; bards through the trials. We carry our own weight just fine. I agree our melee dps should be improved, but I don't sweat it. Because I know it's not why I'm there. I'm there to improve the preformance of the entire group. And nobody does it like a bard.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>I think bards are still being under utilized in many situations.  Extra bards in raids are put with casters... but too often it seems odd to put a bard with 4 rogues + pali.  I aggre with dsavereide.  If you want to calculate Bard DPS you can't just look at melee dmg. or DOT's... you have to look at the influence we have in group situations.
<br />

<br />
I think bard capabilities are just fine.  Although the songs, aa's, and disc's we have been getting lately (or nullifing lately via lvl) have kind of been hit or miss it seems.  I think SoE could be a bit more creative with songs (i.e. Resist CAP raises, Stat CAP raises, etc.) and disc's.  But seriously dps pales in comparison with what a bard can do for the raid or group.</span></td>

<br />
Before anyone rants right after... no, I have not parsed, but I don&#180;t think the game calculates which mod is in effect when the song lands, but when it is casted. I have swapped a drum after starting selo when starting to travel across zones, and I just go slower than if I swap the drum and start selo.
<br />

<br />
About grouping, still everyone likes to have a bard regardless, mainly because we offer mez, mana regen, slow, debuffs, pulling, and increased group effectiviness with our songs (heck, I even tanked 2 days ago at NW caves in WoS because there were no tanks available. I have LR10, ID10, Dodge 1 and +8% dodge mods. With 8300 HPs and 1600 AC, so I am not uber by any counts. The cleric was good though. We used root for agro, killed the named 4 times, got 3 shields and 1 pair of leather shoes. Had no medding downtime)
<br />

<br />
When raiding, it has been a long time, seems that way at least, since we had to leave peeps out of raid because we are maxed (we prolly raid with 50+ peeps at peak raid times, and like 30+ elsewhere). Still, I find mostly singing resists, manasong, 30% overhaste, PoV, etc. When I get bored I mez everything monks bring (Qvic pulls). OOW raids are lame and boring, thx SoE!
<br />

<br />
My number 1 SoE rant for that list would be:
<br />

<br />
Fix LFG time (for everyone)
<br />

<br />
Designing content where you need a cleric and a warrior or bust is dumb.
<br />

<br />
If server populations are low, people stay LFG for 30 minutes or so, before they log and move on to doing something else, making that server population even lower.
<br />

<br />
I think SoE needs to address the LFG downtime before they do anything else. And if that involves investing in AI, making mobs smarter so that we are no longer fighting singles, but group of mobs (hiting for less), and if that requires merging servers, so be it.
<br />

<br />
Yesterday, playing my chanter, Warrior was pulling in MPG, and due to repops we had 2 adds. Adds got locked, everything got killed and everyone said &quot;That was fun!&quot;. Too bad it only happened once in the 3 hours I was there. Why I am playing my bard all the time, and haven&#180;t played my chanter in 3 months. 
<br />

<br />
Can you imagine zones where single pulls are next to impossible, and there are roamers addingh left and right? Where you are fighting 3+ mobs at a time insetad of single pulls? Where pet ghetto mez is an option? Where a monk can tank? Where a ranger can snare kite the adds if too many? Where a druid or shaman can heal? I miss that most of all.
<br />

<br />
Disclaimer: I am aware druids and shamans can heal in MPG content, monks and berserkers can tank and so forth. I have done that many times with guildies QVic+ geared, but that is not your every day LFG Joe.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Bards in my guild are low in numbers.  2 active bards and one thats going to be playing less.  I usually end up playing mana/ec and pov for raids and focus song if I have melee and casters in group.  Other bard plays debuffs.  If we get more then 2 bards they'll pick up something to make our job easier.  My guild is the number one on Tholuxe and I still think songs of bards are useful.  Not everyone is going to have max resists because of new members and apps.  Also I have came to the conclusion a while ago that on raids we just amplify peoples abilities which is very useful.  Also we are pullers.  
<br />

<br />
I agree though that there needs to be more ways of solo play then lfg for hours.  Thats what makes me sick is waiting for hours for a group because of low numbers of people.  I shouldn't have to log on 3 toons just to make a group for me.  I also need to add that I have used shaman as main healers in RSS.  You need a good tank to do so but its doable.  I use druids alot too.  Seems clerics only log on for raids now.  Anyway, I'd like to see our melee dps go up some to where we should be for group situations.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Personally, I think bards are tuned just fine.
<br />

<br />
Our DPS has never been stellar; but that's not why people invite us to groups; and it's not what guilds look for from us at a raid.
<br />

<br />
Some of our songs could use a bit of tuning (Verse of Versagren for instance).  Our snare is a bit subpar; and many of our songs have not recieved a revamp; while the same old same old's continue to get....the same old same old.
<br />

<br />
Read:  No new HoS, No new Nivs Harmonic, No new Jaxon's Jig of Vigor!  While Riz, etc stays the same.
<br />

<br />
However, imho, bards are the group, and the other 5 guys just fill in the missing classes.  We don't need them; they  don't need us.  But you don't need Ice cream in your cone either.  It just makes it a helluvah lot better.
<br />

<br />
Newer / more exciting songs/effects would be kinda nice to add a bit of &quot;suh weet&quot; or variability to our unique play style. That's about all i'd like to see.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Conaden, I'm curious about your perspective.  I would love to be convinced that I'm just being negative, and if your guild is the top on Tholuxe, I'm sure you're in Anguish or near enough to have done a lot of the Omens raids.
<br />

<br />
My issue with PoV was not that everyone is capped.  It's that even with capped resists, the AEs are nearly unresistable.  Have you noticed a marked improvement singing PoV in say, Specialization?  I keep my logs on all the time and the only dent in my damage was based on my Spell Shielding mods, not from resists despite singing POV.  The trial is designed to require fast curing or else eat the AEs and bard songs don't make a difference even with capping everyone at 600.  I'm not saying every trial should require the same tactic and that tactic should be bard resists, but I do firmly feel like my usefulness has eroded on raids since PoP and I'm looking at concrete examples.
<br />

<br />
And I would never argue that bards can't amplify a group.  In fact, I pointed out that we're excellent in grouping situations for that reason.  But in a raid that is limited to 54 where DPS is crucial to success, adding bards is not as useful as adding another pure DPS class.  Because the raid limits have forced us to require classes to sit out and to design for optimum success, bards have been cut in favor of other classes.  I can't argue with the raid leader's decision because he's right.
<br />

<br />
I'm curious to hear where your perspective has come from since I'd rather adopt it, but I'm sceptical.

I am glad your server has no low numbers issue, or that your guild is so well managed in terms of recruits that 60+ players show up for raiding on daily basis and your guild leader has to leave people out. My server is strugling population wise, we raided Qvic yesterday with 29 people (counting the boxed character for raid invites at Natimbi). I know it is holiday season and all, but I have never seen more than 50 peeps on any raid in the past few months (since EQ2/WoW). I know we are not the only ones experiencing this on our server, and prolly applies to a few servers as well.
<br />

<br />
In any case, you can easily make a case, since your guild has the luxury of choosing, that a bard in a group with 4 pure DPSers (rogues and wizzards) will easily grant more DPS than a 5th DPSer in said group. It is pretty straight forward:
<br />

<br />
30% + 4 = 120%
<br />

<br />
It can be argued that 30% focus on nukes is only the best case scenario and that often it is less, since 30% is chancy. If so, you can place bard with 4 rogues, that way the 120% is no longer a chance, but a sure thing.
<br />

<br />
The max number of bards I have seen raiding on my guild at any given time is 4. I would say the average is 2. As of late, with the holidays, it dropped to 1 or none.
<br />

<br />
I can&#180;t really imagine a guild not wanting at least 3 bards on a raid. 1 for Tanks group, 1 for manasong/resist, 1 for special DPS unit group. And if 3 bards is one too many cause between the 2 bards manasong and resists can be picked up, STILL bards are not inmune to dying on a raid encounter.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: STILL, you can say an extra 200 AC on tank AND an extra 250 ATK AND and extra 150 DS AND an extra 100+ CHA AND an extra 300 resists AND an extra 30% melee haste AND an extra 150 heal per tick will not make a difference. But when it DOES make the difference between lootz and wipes, to me it more than makes up for all the other times it didn&#180;t. It is a matter of seing the glass half full or half empty really.
<br />

<br />
Likewise, it can be said an extra DPSer will not make any difference either.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Every time I step into a group on a raid, I always get cool a bard.  I know I will save healers mana and amplify the damage output of my group members.  My guild is in Anguish and only killed Ture so far.  Thats due to some low numbers the past month.  We average around 40 people now per raid.  We kill King, Queen in RSS and do every single trial.  We also are in Tacvi.  As far as resists go, I resist alot.  I used to play VoV until I found out it had stacking issues.  Sometimes AEs will get through, but that extra 150 hps per tic adds up and you also have group DA to pulse.  Every time you pulse that DA song, you again just saved the healers mana.  Its especially useful for timed AEs.  Some fights require huge amounts of damage shields to win.  I won't say which ones, but thats the only way you'll win.  Guess whos needed for that?  Thats right... Anyway, bards are very useful and I wouldn't mind getting one more to make us 3 active bards to help us out.
<br />

<br />
Some other things to add here, not only do we buff people to make them more effective and save mana, but we are also very good debuffers and stack with shaman and chanter debuffs.  I am not the debuffer of my guild unless they aren't around.  Harmony of Sound and Chaos Chant stack.  Chaos Chant can get resisted though.  I do know that if they aren't played shamans and others will bitch about it.  If they have a hard time landing something, they will send you a tell and you'll hear about it.  Some mobs are still very resistant, even if you landed every debuff.
<br />

<br />
We are also pullers.  If we are outdoors, I usually get asked to pull.  I am still learning myself, but I have pulled Anguish and several other zones.  I'm excellent at pulling for groups but kinda suck for raid pulling atm.  Once I get some experience, I'm sure I'll be really good.
