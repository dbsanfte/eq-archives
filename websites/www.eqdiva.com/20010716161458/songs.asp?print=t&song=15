<b>Great in Highhold Pass - </b>7/13/01 5:30:01 PM<br>~ <b>Smegley</b><blockquote>Whether soloing or grouping, this song rules when faced with numerous opponents.  I'm only level 19, so what an earlier post said about this being resisted at higher levels may be true.  If you're in an *experienced* group of players (not characters), that know what they're doing, this song makes taking on groups or orcs or gnolls a piece of cake.<br><br>One warning.  Make sure you have tanks that can taunt well.  Because if they can't, or just don't notice it, as soon as a mob wakes up, it's coming after YOU.  I died once when that happened.  Everyone else had almost a full bar of health at when I kicked it.  That's why it's good to group with people that know what they're doing.  Everybody needs to know what you're doing before hand.  That way they don't each attack a separate mob and wake them all up to attack you.  So get ready to zone then disband if your groupmates are bumbling incomps.  </blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>worth it's weight in corpse runs - </b>6/9/01 12:03:53 AM<br>~ <b>Trius Deme</b><blockquote>This song is really a joke most the time.  At 46th level, I can sing this to a swaming group of rats in the Freeport newbie zone and have EVERY rat resist.  It makes 2 checks against magic each pulse making it twice as resistable.  Mostly a novelty item for pl'ing newbies<br><br>Trius Deme<br><br>46 Bard Xegony<br>One Hundred Swords</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Worthless - </b>5/30/01 1:39:25 PM<br>~ <b>Kassia Locita</b><blockquote>This song is mostly good for getting you killed.  Once you get past your mid-30s it's resisted 99% of the time and puts you high on the aggro list so you suddenly have a large number of mobs unmezzed and very annoyed with  you.  Good way to die.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>This song is quite effective... - </b>5/4/01 2:55:06 AM<br>~ <b>HuskerDuh</b><blockquote>I was grouped with my Monk friend (at level 25) in Cazic Thule... we were pulling to the first dead end in the maze and he brought about 5 mobs back with him... I pulled out the mez song and we were able to finish them all off.  </blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Look at them all sleep. - </b>5/3/01 11:40:59 AM<br>~ <b>Dalhari</b><blockquote>I used this song to help out newbies on orc hill in GFay and at times I had more that 8 mobs sleeping quietly.  From my experience with this song if you use a instrument it's unlimited on the number of mobs you can mez...   </blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Wonderful song... - </b>5/2/01 8:26:07 AM<br>~ <b>Bolil</b><blockquote>Just make sure your group knows what you are doing :)  Tell them over and over and over until they get it straight :)  Always /assist on the puller, always let the puller pick the next target once the first falls, then /assist again.<br><br>When I just got the song, I was fighting gnolls in East Karana.  The biggest problem I had was trying to get the group to coordinate their attacks when we had 3 or 4 gnolls on us :)  An overactive Warrior in the group kept attacking one of the additional gnolls, which would then aggro on me and backhand me upside the head :)  But after about 15 minutes, I had the fellow with an /assist hotkey, and the whole group was doing much better!  I can imagine how an Enchanter feels in this situation...at least I've got the AC and hitpoints to absorb some damage :)<br><br>In Santana mode (Mandolin equipped), it seemed that the song was a lot more effective.  Maybe it's subjective, but it seemed that the mesmerization failed a lot less, and that silly second resist also failed a lot less.  By twisting in a healing song, we were tearing through packs of gnolls at an alarming rate :)<br><br>Well, happy strumming all!<br><br>Bolil the Boy Bard<br><br></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>It definitely does more than four. - </b>4/30/01 8:10:10 PM<br>~ <b>Morrilin</b><blockquote>This song is a *must* if you don't have an enchanter, especially if you don't have a puller who can reliably single pull, like an overzealous ranger friend of mine.  The most difficult part is once the mobs all turn on you, it takes a full pulse from singing to the mez effect, during which they're all aggro on you, and a stun means you start over again.  But, last night I did briefly have 8 out of 8 dazed goblins out for the count in Runnyeye, so it can be done.  However, if you're wielding weapons instead of instruments (which seems less and less like the wise course every time I think about it) don't bother.  All this is then is a tauntsong.  Stick with Bellow and some buffs if you like your stickypokes.  Then again, why did you pick a bard in the first place, then?  :)<br><br>Morrilin<br>Bard of the 23rd circle<br>Xegony server</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>Great Song - </b>3/11/01 1:53:29 AM<br>~ <b>Zartomb of The Tomb,</b><blockquote>This song is a must have in the line up. <br><br>And you can mezz more then 4 creatures at a time. I was traveling through the Gorge from Eastern Karana and came upon a struggling group of players, they had about 3 mino's on them and several muddmites (they cant mind there own business). I decided to hold my travel and help out, thanks to my to the levitate I had on me I was out of range of the monsters attacks. I just fired up the song and put the mandolin in hand and the mob was undercontrol, suprisingly the group was organized and they began to pick off one by one.<br><br><br>                                        Zartomb, Bard of the Tomb<br>                                               of the 17th chorus<br>                                                     Morrel Thule</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>I will test it - </b>2/25/01 4:58:13 PM<br>~ <b>Kocho Divah</b><blockquote>I actually used this song today while I was practicing my PickLock skill in Befallen. (helping out newbies there) I didn't notice more than 4 mobs, but I will definitely try again, and post my results here.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>You sure about the cap? - </b>2/25/01 4:54:52 PM<br>~ <b>Philoscope</b><blockquote>I believe that the cap of 4 mobs is only for sung.  With strings it's unlimited.
