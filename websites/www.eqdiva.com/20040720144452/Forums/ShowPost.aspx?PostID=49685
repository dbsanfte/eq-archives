				<td colspan="2"><span>Howdy Folks!
<br />

<br />
Wiladancer here from the Torv Server, hoping, yet once again, to pick the brains of you wonderful folks. I have read the &quot;Pulling Hard LDoN&quot; guide here and thank you for that. I do need to fine tune what I am doing and this may be a rather long post, so please bear with me.
<br />

<br />
I finally got Fading Memories and our adventuring group decided we'd try a Hard LDoN last night.
<br />

<br />
To set the stage, I'm a 64th Bard, not very well dressed as I am a casual player in a family guild. I do not have my Epic although I am working on that as well. Group makeup last night was:
<br />

<br />
64 Bard (that would be me)
<br />
2x 65 Paladin's
<br />
64 Monk
<br />
65 Cleric
<br />
63 Warrior
<br />

<br />
My duties were initially:
<br />

<br />
Puller
<br />
Haster
<br />
Slower
<br />
CCer
<br />

<br />
Initial Songs Memmed:
<br />

<br />
Lull - Silent Song of Quellious
<br />
Debuff - Occlusion of Sound
<br />
Amp - Amplification
<br />
Resist/DS - Psalm of Veeshan
<br />
Overhaste - Rizlona's Call of Flame
<br />
Haste - Warsong of Zek
<br />
Slow - Requiem of Time
<br />
Mez - Dreams of Terris
<br />

<br />
Current Mods:
<br />
Battle Drummer's Main-Gauche - Percussion 2.0
<br />
Troubador's Mace - Brass 1.8
<br />
Painted Primal Mask - Stringed 1.4
<br />
Gravestone of Dire Melodies - Wind 1.6
<br />

<br />
Mana Pool allows for 2.5apx FM's
<br />

<br />
Mistmoore LDoN Halls of Sanguitary something or rather
<br />

<br />
The initial pulls consisted of 3 on the first lull resist, then 3 on the second lull resist. These were fought at zone in and we prevailed, albeit long battles as I had to keep 2 mezzed and positioned so landed RoT and sang WoZ. So the first room of 6 went well, considering the lack of room for FM.
<br />

<br />
We then moved in to the room and I proceeded to the next room. 3rd Pull was yet another resist and brought 3 with me. Same deal, mezzed 2 and had to try and keep PoV up with WoZ. We lost one Pally, then I had a ton of resists on my mez, even with OOS. Down goes the other Pally, then Warrior, then Monk. Cleric zones, then I run to zone and get out with 22% (thank you RUN3).
<br />

<br />
We rez, med and then do the Monk/Bard tag routine, which worked very well for the next 6-7 pulls. At this point, I am switching out tunes as we lost our Shammy buffs and many folks in group have vs Undead procs. 
<br />

<br />
Out with the Lull, in with the Katta's Song of Sword Dancing. This seems to add to the critical hits and procs, but our MT is taking quite a beating now. I then drop OOS for Niv's Melody of Preservation. This does help a bit for damage mitigation, but now I have to battle through the additional resists (why can't we have more songs at our disposal). 
<br />

<br />
The monk died on one overpull from a nasty DoT. I then died a bit later from an overpull of 4, hit FM, but got hit at the same time and must have been an undead somewhere in there. 
<br />

<br />
All in all, we lost the adventure due to the partial wipe, additional deaths and a LD moment. We were fairly close though. 
<br />

<br />
I also found, on our last pull, that Chain mezzing seemed to work great for singles. Anyone else use this?
<br />

<br />
I would love to hear your thoughts, questions and criticism. I have learned oh so much from these boards and do thank you in advance for all your continued education.
<br />

<br />
Wila...

				<td colspan="2"><span>Assuming you are getting slow to land consistently, the damage shield isn't really a critical part of your DPS as a group.  And if your sense is that the main tank is taking too much damage and over-burdening your healers, the answer despite what some will tell you, is NOT HP regen.  It's boosted AC.  Niv's Harmonic is your friend in hard LDON if your main tank is less than 1600 AC or so.  It can help you take less damage on that residual agro, too.  Seriously, the added AC of that song is superior to HP regen from other songs.  Warsong is a must if you need the haste -- POV is a must if you are dealing with a lot of casters and Mistmoore has a lot.  But Niv's Harmonic went into my lineup about the second hard LDON I tried and stayed there.</span></td>

<br />

<br />
I pretty much made the same mistake of relying on lull in the beginning. Its nice if it works, but never ever rely on it, I think you found that out the hard way like I did.
<br />

<br />
From looking at the levels I would assume the mobs were hitting in the 600-700 range? Its not quite a 65 avg group so its not a &quot;super&quot; hard, just a scaled hard. Even so, a 63 warrior without proper AAs might find tanking in this situation to be a little tough(I imagine it was the paladins tanking).
<br />

<br />
The monk is 64, he should have his lvl 64 lull which will work up to lvl 65 mobs. I have pulled LDoNs with my monk(albeit lower level, but the mechanics scale the same). With just the lull, the aggro ranges of mobs in MM are small enough that I could single 90% of the pulls. If you find your lull to be failing too often, it might be best to ask the monk to use their unresistable lull, or just have them take over pulls.
<br />

<br />
My thoughts on Chain mezzing are mixed, I only use it in desparate situations, With 3 or more hasted melees beating on a mob, your mezz wont last long enough to be of any use. Using the mezzes with a knockback component can push the mobs out of melee range and save your MA a few precious moments for that CH to get off. From personal experience the effectiveness of chain mezzing is not that great. It would probably be better spent twisting damage runes or AC, at least it will save your tank some hps each round of attacks opposed to a 0 sec stun.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Also if you get to the ones where they are hitting for 900+ a 63 warrior will not cut it.  Hard LDoN's are controlled by two things.  The pulling/cc (2-3 mobs and tank is dead unless doing furious till you land mezzes) and how good your tank is.  In a normal 65 hard generally I will not take any tanks that are not in an elemental guild unless I know them or have a spot healer and shammy (do pick up groups quite a bit).

If the pallies where chain stunning, that would be a good way to reduce damage.  Didn't have a snarer besides you either, which is not a good thing, esp. in EC.  
<br />

<br />
But there are tons of threads on how too pull and what to do in a hard ldon.  Would suggest you read them.  You really shouldn't have been pulling if doing everything else and you had a (decent) monk, since lull is worthless in a hard till you hit 250+ cha and if you died it would probably mean a wipe (no slow or CC besides root parking).  
<br />

<br />
Also if you are the only slower i would recomend having mischief memmed for when when RoT is resisted (recast time).  </span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Two things first of all...
<br />

<br />
1) For a Bard to be the only slower, you need an Elem+ tank and a good cleric with decent heal AA and manapool.
<br />

<br />
Remember that our slow is &quot;only&quot; 54% and thus the tanks eat an extra 21% damage compared to a shaman slow. Getting hit for 9xx's by Hard LDoN mobs, those 21% add up to alot quickly.
<br />

<br />
2) When you are lulling (i prefer to call it pac'ing tho) in Hard LDoN's, your Cha should be at least 200+. Mine is at 240 unbuffed, and I sometimes end up having as many as 7 resists in a row before the paci takes hold.
<br />

<br />
To counter that, keep your Solons Charismatic Concord ready.
<br />

<br />
As for song setup...
<br />

<br />
Regular twist...
<br />

<br />
1. Winds of Marr
<br />
2. Warsong of Zek
<br />
3. Call of the Muse
<br />
4. Psalm of Veeshan
<br />

<br />
Backup songs....
<br />

<br />
5. Requiem of Time
<br />
6. Silent song of Quellious
<br />
7. Solons Charismatic Concord
<br />
8. Lullaby of Morell.
<br />

<br />
I use the Requiem to pull after I paci'd. Also pulling with slow means less damage on YOU if the tank dont grab aggro fast.
<br />

<br />
As far as paci'ing goes, I heard some say that mobs wont aggro on your resisted paci if you arent in their line of sight. I havent tested this out much, I just know you can have loads of resisted paci's without aggro, and other times they jump you right away both while facing me and not facing me.
<br />

<br />
For paci'ing, its all about charisma and a bit of luck on the resist check the mobs get. But hey, FM is there if you get a crappy pull so no sweat &quot;)</span></td>

I won't argue that it is certainly easier to do Hard LDON with this combination.  I would not call it necessary.  My regular group started doing hard LDONs about 6 or 7 months ago.  We just killed Rallos last weekend and we have never hunted Ssra Basement or Vex Thal -- which gives you an idea of our gear.  So our warrior is not elem+ and our regular group doesn't even have a cleric -- druid and shaman.  Yes, most of the time, that means we have shaman slows, but we have endured pulls many times with just my slows for whatever reason and I can assure you that while it slows the team down a tad, it really doesn't make it impossible by any stretch of the imagination.  The max hit damage in hard LDON -- 992 -- can be survived easily by non-elemental tanks IF they have decent defensive AAs like maxed CA/CS and some LR and ID to add onto it.  That is also why I strongly recommend Niv's Harmonic.  Increasing your tank's AC by 60+ (80+ if I remember to keep Harmonize going) is going to cut down noticeably on damage taken.</span></td>

<br />
Sadly, this isn't the case :(
<br />

<br />
I think you did really well to nearly win the adventure given the group makeup. Pulling hards is not easy, and a good tank and healer is required; I don't think I've ever done a hard adv with myself as the main slower, haster and cc person.
<br />

<br />
I'd echo the sentiments on making use of the monk's unresistable lull. One lull is sufficient to reduce 90% of pulls down to 2 mobs. Those few times it takes a bit more, you've got the monk's FD, your fade, mezz, snare etc to shake off the extras.
<br />

<br />
Make sure you leave room between yourself and the group; a popular tactic is to mezz adds, run to group with the one or two left over, and then fade - so the mezzed mobs return to their spawn spots. Its essential your group understands this, an SK/necro doing a group lifetap or a healer spot-healing you on inc will lead to a wipe.
<br />

<br />
One thing I find hard to decide is song lineup on hards. Normal is pretty standard but with a hard, more compromises are required.
<br />

<br />
My basic lineup is probably:
<br />
1. PoV
<br />
2. Muse
<br />
3. Marr
<br />
4. Zek
<br />
5. HoS
<br />
6. RoT
<br />
7. Lull
<br />
8. Mezz
<br />

<br />
PoV - DS is nice, but more for resists as hard ldon mobs can really hurt you with dots and nukes.
<br />
Muse - Great dps boost, hard to miss this one out
<br />
Marr - Great for both mana and hp regen
<br />
Zek - DS, Atk, and if no chanter/shaman then more haste
<br />
5-8 are self-explanatory.
<br />

<br />
Unfortunately there are 2 gaps in this (at least!)
<br />
a) Niv's Harmonic. AC boost really helps - but is it worth sacrificing any of 1-4 for this? I'd consider dropping Zek if there's somebody else covering haste but I'm not sure it out-weighs anything else.
<br />
b) Snare. Snare is really useful for making more controlled pulls. Normally I rely on someone else snaring runners as I'll be off pulling before the old mob is dying. Again, I can drop Zek for this in some groups, the other option is to drop RoT but I really like the added safety of pre-slows with RoT - the slow on snare is significantly less and of course short duration too, not to mention it doesn't work on unsnareables. 
<br />
c) If charisma is low, you might want to throw in our charisma song. Goodness knows where you fit it in though ;)
<br />

<br />
Last adventure I dropped RoT and used snare/slow in its place; this seemed to work quite well with a chanter slowing.</span></td>

<br />
Every single mob in a hard LDON mitigates slow, though you won't see the mitigation message if you have a brass mod of 2.4 or more - I think that's the bug, anyway.
<br />

<br />
That cuts the slow difference down to about 17%, and since you're slowing on inc, not trying to land Malos and THEN slow after the mob is already in camp, your tank is fighting a slowed mob for its entire life, not just the last 2/3rds of it.

I totally agree with everyone else on the use of RoT.  I found that when lull pulling, tagging the MOB with Harmony and then following up with RoT worked great.

One thing I feel I need to get better at is judging how far back to leave my group.  Too much distance is bad.  Too little distance is bad.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Pulling hard LDONs is fun and it can be challenging. Do not rely on lull because it will usually be resisted. Now, that doesn't mean that there is never a place for lull. On some rooms where 4 to 6 mobs will come, I try to use lull. It works enough that I still try it. However, I sing our charisma song to max my charisma BEFORE I try to lull. With maxed charisma, aggro on a failed lull is unusual. If I get aggro on a failed lull, I just fade and then try a different strategy.
<br />

<br />
I prefer to leave a lot of room between me and my group when pulling. That way, on the tough pulls, I can mez one and get aggro of the room. Then I run while mezzing another. Then fade. Now I should have only two or three mobs near me from the original 4 to 5. Then I can either single pull or rinse and repeat. It is essential that you have at least a room in between your group and your pull when using this strategy. Some bards use snare too for splitting. I don't use that much because it is rare I have the song slot for it.
<br />

<br />
If you have a monk, you really should be working together on the pulls of rooms with a lot of mobs who will chain aggro and wipe your group. On the rooms with 4 to 5 mobs who will aggro, a monk friend and I use both of our lulls. I work to lull one in the aggro chain. When I get one lulled, then he lulls the next with his unresistable lull and he pulls a single or at worst a double. Room is split quite fast like that.
<br />

<br />
With a monk and a bard, pulling can be very efficient. For example, even on multiple pulls the monk can lull one and run and FD well outside of the aggro range of the group. Then you can mez one and the other one or two come. Then you should have only one or two mobs to manage if you can fade off the first mezzed one.  Also a good monk bard team should be able to have great control of the mobs. I love a smart monk who when pulling two mobs will always FD out of range of the group. Then I just mez one and the other comes. I slow it on incoming, and I can fade or remez the mob we are not killing. That speeds things up in an LDON too.
<br />

<br />
I rarely use dispell on pulls except for mobs with a DS.
<br />

<br />
I agree that bard slow (55% slow per Reeds spreadsheet with JamFest3) is sufficient. Bard slow can usually be landed much earlier than shammy/chanter/beast slow because we get less aggro from it, and we are often pulling so mobs are slowed when they arrive at camp. That makes up a lot for the difference in our slows. Although I have no data to prove it, I suspect that on hasted mobs that our ability to slow earlier makes bard slow at least comparable with the better slowing classes because any slow negates the haste.

<br />
All good suggestions here...
<br />

<br />
1st mistake...you were puller and just about everything else.
<br />
-have monk pull and have your assist set to him.  Tag teaming is a great way to pull hards and it allows you to OOS or HOS on incoming...thus giving you a better chance at landing slows.
<br />

<br />
2nd mistake was pointed out...you just can't rely on lull on the hard advs.  Learn the pathing of the adv and learn to remove lull as a pulling tool, trust me, you'll learn why later on in advanced stages of EQ.
<br />

<br />
3rd mistake also pointed out...for Hards, always boost the tanks AC with Nivs and do your best to get your casters VOQ prior to entering the adv... I rarely play Chorus during a Hard adv unless we have a downtime due to death.
<br />

<br />
LDoN Hards a great way for Bards to learn pulling techniques and I highly recommend them to everyone.  The normal advs are so dull you can pretty much charge a room and survive intact.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Wow, i had exactly the same experience in my first hard ldon. To many resists on paci, hard to keep 3 mobs messed, tanks going down etc.
<br />

<br />
first thing i did for myself was get me a tradeskill jewel: + 50 cha and augmented it with another +6 cha.
<br />
then i bought me the stein for an additional 25 Cha. and of course augmented it:)
<br />

<br />
now this close to an hundred extra cha, + our cha song brings me close to 300 cha in total. I hardly get a critical fail on blue mobs anymore. So i now paci blues, and pull whites.
<br />
This way i never have more then 2 - 3 mobs on a pull.
<br />
Next thing i did was JF 1. now i hardly get resists on mess either, and pulling/cc-ing hards has become mannageable w/o getting a headache:)
<br />

<br />

<br />
Now i am so far that i prefer mess pulling. Mostly i lul one in a chain, mess another, have three mobs incoming, mess one more, run to camp and fade.
<br />
Makes it a lot less a hassle, and even more fun:)
<br />

<br />
hope that helps a bit,

				<td colspan="2"><span>For those just hitting this topic since it hangs around the top of the LDON topic, I did write a guide on this a few months ago -- <a target="_new" href="http://www.eqdiva.com/EQ/Guide.aspx?id=79&amp;ForumID=132">http://www.eqdiva.com/EQ/Guide.aspx?id=79&amp;ForumID=132</a>-- been fairly well received.
<br />

<br />
To underscore thoughts of others -- Lull is semi-reliable at best.  Learn to function without it.  One of the most powerful techniques available to you is mez-fade.  Mez one target, when other target(s) agro and come to you, fade off agro from your mez victim.  Leave lots of room, as many suggested -- you need ample room to work on pulls so control where your group is standing at all times.  Yes, bard slow is sufficient since everything in LDON mitigates slow to some extent, it seems - the difference between Shaman slow and bard slow is probably small to nothing.  However, as others have said, you WANT to be pulling and nothing else -- not slowing and not CCing.  You will probably have to do some of this anyway, but the more you can concentrate on one thing, the better off you and your group will be.
<br />

<br />
I finally reached the point where pulling hard LDON became almost 100% routine, but it never got easy or even especially fun.  It was 45 minutes of work for 105 adventure points -- and it never stopped being more work than play.  We don't do a lot of LDON now in our group and I don't especially miss it.  But learning to master this can be the key to improving your gear quite a bit.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>I was totally embarassed in an EC (SRO) LDON the other night.  Mez pulling is not something I have had to use in the past, so still learning the ins and outs of its use.  The big issues I had were:
<br />

<br />
<u>MOB Speed</u>
<br />
I only have Run3.  Mobs run SOOOO fast.  My usual pulling method has always been to pull, see what comes, if it looks ok, turn around and take to group, if not, backpeddle and mez another one or two, turn around, run and fade.  I just can't do this in EC Hards.  I don't have the time to turn around, at least if I pull with a short range song like mez.
<br />

<br />
<i>(I am using Terris, 100 foot range.  I hadn't realized it, but Morrell has a 200 range.  This could solve a lot of my problems with being &quot;too&quot; close for mez pulling)</i>
<br />

<br />
I am thinking that I am going to have to &quot;blind&quot; pull.  Since a lot of people seem to favor singing mez for the pull, I would:
<br />

<br />
1) target 2 mobs.
<br />
2) Start singing mez, turn around
<br />
3) When song lands, run
<br />
4) Switch targets, sing mez.
<br />

<br />
When you have both mobs mezzed, bring what remains back to the group. <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />   I could fade, turn around and see what I brought, but it may be that those 2 were the only ones coming on the pull, so it would be a wasted fade (I only have FT5)
<br />

<br />
The other option I guess, is to make the group leave the dungeon when my SoE fades, reapply it, and then re-enter.
<br />

<br />
<u>Mez Aggro Range</u>
<br />
The aggro range on mez seems to be quite small.  That is, mez a mob.  Say you only get 1 aggro.  Mez this aggro.  Wait for the 1st mez to wear off.  The 1st mob and 2 others will come.
<br />

<br />
So, when ever I use mez to pull, it appears to me that I am forced to fade, because, I REALLY don't know if I will get 1 or 4 mobs when it wakes up.
<br />

<br />
<u>Aggro Messages</u>
<br />
I don't seem to be able to rely on the aggro messages.  Sometimes when I see 2 aggro messages, I may end up getting 4 mobs.
<br />

<br />
<u>Chase Range</u>
<br />
Hard LDON mobs don't seem to have a limit on their chase range.  Meaning, I can mez a mob, run 18 seconds out of range, and it will still chase me down.  I had assumed that LDONS worked a lot like the outside world and that if you run outside some chase range, they gave up, but would reaggro if you entered back into chase range.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Questions:
<br />

<br />
- Until I get Morrell, I am thinking a better strategy than mez pulling would be to sing my longest range, lowest aggro generating song, perhaps the lvl 40 cancel magic song?
<br />

<br />
- How much of an effect does range have on Lull resists?  I think I am going to test out this idea.
<br />

- How much of an effect does line of sight have on Lull resists?  I think I am going to test out this idea.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I have heard people say that range and los have effect on lull resists.  My personal experience -- over 100 LDONs, most of them hard -- is that there is no consistent improvement from breaking LOS and lulling at longer range. For mez pulling, a lot of times I move into a room invis or I send an eye (I use stalking probes - sold my SS Helm two years ago and never bought another one) pick a target and have the tank assist me.  Then I pick two other targets and load them into the toggle buffer.  Then I mez one and run back to camp landing mez on the other as I go.  At this point, you have one mezzed at the original room, one mezzed halfway back, and one, or maybe two, heading to your camp.  I then fade, remez the one halfway back, and take care of any adds in camp.  Makes a room of 4 very doable in hard LDON.  I forget the name of the spell shaman have -- it makes the mob sneeze violently and move back out of melee range and be stunned for a few seconds.  Our regular group includes a shaman who makes liberal use of that spell to help out in crowd control and it is wonderful.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>In our Dual Pally Group, we have a rather adept gent who ghetto cc's via root parking. He also saves my tail regularly by healing my tinfoil bard suit ladened butt. 
<br />

<br />
I have seen some really great advice, but it looks as though I need to do quite a few things before I alone can successfully pull a complete hard LDoN. 
<br />

<br />
1st - CHA, mine is way to low to make a difference at this point. I am not fond of sacrificing AC for CHA, nor am I enticed by the idea of losing a song slot to CHA tune.
<br />

<br />
2nd - FT items, I have none. I can Fade at most 2-3 times during and adventure. This just won't do it.
<br />

<br />
3rd - Most rooms have 6+ MoBs in it. Nothing to sneeze at, unless you're a Shammy and they do run d*mn fast. I need to be able to better separate them. 3 or 4 to split or park? fairly easy to do. With 6 and no fade, you might as well send the Freeport Press your obituary.
<br />

<br />
I guess it comes down to, practice makes perfect. I will have my monk friend pull more often so that we can do a bit more in the tagging department. I like the idea of a 2-pull feign then mez tag, prep SA Pally with Mez message. Toggle the incoming and nail with RoT and bring to MA Pally, attack target from angle so you can see Mezzed one coming in door. Have it root parked. If resist, mez, OOS, reland Root and focus on the first in camp. 
<br />

<br />
Maybe once I get my epic, this will become a tad easier as I might have a song or two more to play with. 
<br />

<br />
Thank you everyone for your thoughts. You really bring out the best in us.

Thanks Drumm for giving me the PoN tour the other night.

<br />
Virulent Paralysis - it's a 3 level AA ability that costs 3/3/3.  It's a knockback and root, but unfortunately doesn't have a stun component.  It's DR based so you can root things that are very MR, the glimmer drake models in ToV come to mind here.
<br />

<br />
It has a 2 minute refresh time, and at level three lasts just slightly longer than 2 minutes so you can keep something permanently placed if it's not particularly DR.
<br />

<br />
It knocks back something in the direction the shaman is facing at the time it lands, so you can do some neat positioning tricks.  It's good for getting clerics to stand up, all that sitting down they do isn't good for the circulation so parking a mob on them is really quite beneficial.

				<td colspan="2"><span>An update!
<br />

<br />
I pulled a couple of EC hards again the other night.  1 win, 1 loss.  In the loss, we had 6 drops needed in the last 30 minutes, and basically went on a 0 for 12 stretch.  Bleh.
<br />

<br />
Here is what I observed.
<br />

<br />
I used Lull a lot from max range when I had good ranged line of sight to 2-3 mobs.  My base CHA is 217.  Throw on my Grandmasters range item, it's 267.  I was still resisted quite a bit, sometimes 5 or 6 times in a row, but I think I only had one &quot;aggro&quot; resist the entire adventure.
<br />

<br />
I will say one thing about Lull.  Even with Lull, if the mob you pull runs too close to the lulled mob, it's going to aggro both.
<br />

<br />
In cases where I had &quot;blind&quot; pulls, ie, I know there are probably 4-5 mobs in there ready to aggro, but I can only see 1.  I tossed a mez on the visible mob from max range.  This normally resulted in a 1-2 pull.  Bring them to camp.  After they are under control, my mez would wear off.  This would usually bring 2-3 more.  I would try to line myself up while meleeing so that I had LoS in the direction the mobs would come from.  When I saw them stampeding down the hall for us, I would fade.  Hopefully, we could kill our current mobs and bring the next set of 2 before they started to wander back to spawn.  If we were able to, the next pull was usually a single, or at most a double.
<br />

<br />
One of the nice things I found out about this technique is that my long range visible mob was always one of the last ones killed, meaning, I didn't have to enter a crowded room to get LoS on the remaining mobs.  I could repull a 2nd time using debuff instead of mez using the original mezzed mob.
<br />

<br />
Morrell makes a huge difference.  That extra 100 range is a god send.
<br />

<br />

That's it -- honestly I never asked whether it was a spell or AA so that is good to know -- all I know is that it's an awesome ability!  I thought there was a stun because mobs would just sit there for several seconds and not attack -- guess they were just out of range.  But I can tell you that ability mixed in with normal crowd control is a tremendously useful resource.</span></td>
