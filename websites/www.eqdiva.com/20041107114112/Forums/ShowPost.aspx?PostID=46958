				<td colspan="2"><span>first of all, id like to clarify some things before i rant;
<br />
 
<br />
this is my personal feeling, and i do not say that things need to be change to suit me; ive been playing this game for far to long ( 3.5 years) to know that things doesnt change like this. also, i do pull, all the time, and i know i do a good job at it. i have a 65 monk that i used to love and enjoy playing, til i decided to make my bard main. ive been playing bard as main since 1.5 year now and i truely enjoy it.
<br />

<br />
but....
<br />

<br />
ive seen the monk community goes trough hard times. monks by definition is a dps class with some special abilities that allow them to cheat death. over the time it got changed, tweak, nerf to the point where the player-base, as a whole, when thinking of monk = obligatory puller. dont misunderstand me, i used to love it back then. but as time passes, there was no possible way to be anything else than puller. dont want to pull? no group for you. dont find a group? hmm have fun trying to solo. 
<br />

<br />
yes im getting to a point soon<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" /> 
<br />

<br />
so, monks became the puller in the game, wich was ok, but not for everyone ( dig up monkly-business posts.. i remember alot of complains, that most other class couldnt understand) but as time passed, monk became solely useful  (in other players eye) for pulling. now yuo can understand that uproar that happen when poop.. err pop came out. their last ability to find a pickup group was out of the way.
<br />

<br />
thats about when i dust off the bard and start playing her full time. when  i created bard ( almost as old as my monk) i thought &lt; hey, this is a group class that can solo.. i can stay at group and dont deal with pressure of too many or not enough, too fast of not enough fast pulling.. etc..AND i can go solo if i dont find a group&gt; 
<br />

<br />
HA! 
<br />

<br />
yeah right...
<br />

<br />
soon enough, the players  realized that the best way to survive in xp group in pop was a strong solid lull; why split when you can single pull each time? clever bards realized that their lull last forever, was stronger than anyone else etc...and then people realized that bard are more than resist and mana song weak dps class <i>(thats not my point of view, its what people used to think of us)</i> 
<br />

<br />
and as people gain AA, and invade upper tier zones, bards were getting THE spotlight in the game; people realized how powerful this *weak dps melee* class is. but what really tip over the power for bard was when LDON came out. the frenzy was so awful that monks got pushed aside, bards was required everywhere, and suddenly, there was no need to explain to group why you could be useful. 
<br />

<br />
my main grief is again, i am stuck into being what others want me to be; dont want to pull? what use are you good for then?
<br />

<br />
*flip the bird to ignorant people*
<br />
*sigh*
<br />

<br />
although, i must say that some things doesnt speak in our favor:
<br />

<br />
1- charm
<br />

<br />
i still mourn the fact that charm is capped to lvl 57; tell me, when was the last time ( at lvl 65) where you hunt in zones where you could find some sub 57 mob to charm? and when you do, where charm STICK on them ? 
<br />

<br />
2- mezzing
<br />

<br />
im so grateful for the lvl 65 mez that doesnt bump the mob all over the place, i have to say thanks for that ( even if i do find the lvl 64 one some utility now and then) BUT trying to mezz more than one or two ( gasp ) without getting a high % of resists is about impossible; twisting hos to get mezz to land is a necessity nowadays; shaman love to group with me as i land hos to let them stick a slow without debuffing, and i love grouping with them when they can land a malo on my mezz mobs so i dont have to deal with several mezz off due to resists.
<br />

<br />
i still remember time where i could lock down 4 mobs ( 3 mezz, one charm) i loved the fact we were a good choice when no chanter ( and with chanter of course lol); now i can see alot becoming monk 2.0 ( maybe because the people who used to make twink monk to solo with fungi and be puller are now mostly playing bard?..)
<br />

<br />
i know some of you will say stop whining you can get group at least ( if you get into puller type) yeah i guess i can, but i dont like it. and as time pass, i have even less options. i can still be a good substitute to chanter, but when a group want a bard, they want a puller only. 
<br />

<br />
we used to be the warrior-enchanter; i dont like to see my options cut off and once again i see that what used to be part of what define us are slowly taken away in the name of &lt; balance &gt; its a shame for a class reknown for its wide possiblities.
<br />

<br />
im not saying everything is doomed and we are screwed lol , i just say that i wish some other aspect of our class would be highlighted as much as our capacity to lull-pull.
<br />

<br />
i refuse to see my usefullness in group be define by one song and one aa (fade), and im blessed to have a good core of friends who understand that. i still pull when im the best class to do it, but when its not necessary, i let my friend pull, they enjoy too that change of pace.  ( word of advice tho, in some situaton, it STILL better to pull than let the pally do it... they tend to kill us by being overly feisty.. o.0)

				<td colspan="2"><span>I feel where your coming from, the fact that PoP and now GoD and soon to come Oow all have placed definitions upon us that prevents our personal versatility.
<br />
I hate the songs coming out in Oor their a rinsed repeated version of all the other 61+ songs, I don't want nor need upgrades to those I wish we had upgrades to the more versatile songs of lower levels. 
<br />
The warrior chanter role was a lot of fun to play with back in the vellious/luclin era. Take a beaten but mez n charm your way through it controlling the camp for your group was a great adrenaline rush and challenge. This is not a good option in the new zones that mob better not look at anyone that #1 can't take it ( anything less than a tank) #2 can't keep it off of everyone else. In a pinch #1 we can do circumstances pending, #2 good luck we just don't have a taunt, lots of agro stacking but nothing that plucks the mob off the fragile healers and casters when time is a constraint. We can't keep their attention if the healer hits us with anything more than a heal over time and takes the agro. That is deadly in GoD.. if that mob turns around many people are a fine paste before the first song is done casting.
<br />
When I join Ldon's .. I have one role, when I join elemental groups.. i have one role. I miss the days of mass versatility our own songs that are viably used at this level are limited in scope and sight. </span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>yes, i didnt cover that aspect of our new songs, as my post was already long and frankly it make me feel ills <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-9.gif" border="0" alt="Crying" hspace="2" />
<br />

<br />
we used to have song that was good for higher lvl mobs til we achieve some cap lvl where it was like a no-mans-land ( mostly during our dreaded lvls 58-61 where our mez and lull  are useless in pop tier 1 zones)
<br />

<br />
and after that, we get the same basic songs being upgrade to fit higher lvl mobs, rather than what we used to have; song that could affect higher lvl mob than us ( at the time we can use the song) but having to deal with a lots of resist til we gain lvl. 
<br />

<br />
i want someone at SoE eq with imagination that understand us as a whole and not as a defined role to come up with good songs, good aa, good understanding of our class; i want new songs that are totally different than what we have atm; we used to have hot discussoin about what we twist in group; now we all twist the same 4 songs and the hot discussion now is in wich order we play them depending of the group we have o.0 ( because since we are puller~ they dont benefit our songs all the time and we have to choose wich one we leave on the group pulsating til we come back with new mob)
<br />

<br />
i want to be able to save the day like i used to in frenzy in velk (lol) now even with maxxed cha, max whatever you want, i will see from time to time my cleric get beat the sh*t out of it because i accidentally pull more than one and she healed me and i cant stick a stupid mez on it without debuffing prior.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>I think you are overstating the mezz thing a bit. Yes it isn't seb anymore, but on the upper tier of things (GoD, hard LDoN,Elemental Planes) it really shouldn't be. I do get resists now and again, but I can still  be almost as good as a chanter (all we are meant to be really). And my other skills make up for lacks in places like dps. Personally, I think this is a whine about not being as overpowered as we used to be, and having a h*ll of alot better gear/songs, and not expecting the mobs to improve also. If you want, you can go back to seb or velk and be as overpowered as you like. I am as versatile as I always have been, it just isn't quite as easy as it used to be.Thats good, or I would be bored. And for having to debuff everything first, for some reason a trick that works for me often is to melee the mob while mezz is casting, for some reason it sticks a whole lot more often if the mob isn't at 100% and I am hitting it /shrug. This isn't a &quot;gee look at me&quot; kinda thing, but last night alone, 3 PoF adds mezzed while group did named, 3 Zels mezzed in Ssra while raid did HP(and Zels resist bard mez alot). It can be done, with resists, no malo. Its more impressive to mezz 3 500+ hitters, than 4-5 150 point hitters imo.

<br />
you miss the point tho; the mezz discussion was just a sub-subject. my grip is in regard of pick up group, people want a bard for a puller and rarely for something else. i can be whatever i want to be, but that usually imply soloing or waiting for friends to log on.
<br />

<br />
its my personal point of view of not liking that aspect, and im not wishing to change things, i know most bards like it. i just wish other aspect of bards would be taken in consideration too when you look for a group. most pick-up group dont give a ratass if you dont sing any song (i tested it several time) as long mana is good, and mob been chain pulled.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Well thanks, stare dreamily all ya like<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-4.gif" border="0" alt="Tongue out" hspace="2" />I was only commenting on the mez aspect to begin with, and like you, took a bit of a tangent. I don't expect to have people know my class well enough that they know everything I can do before they invite me. Most times in a pickup, the question comes, who is pulling? or 'is the bard puling?' Thats your chance! Don't want to? Tell them! &quot;I can pull if you like, but lets try with me upping the dps, mana and mezzing adds first, it may be faster.' 3.5 years in the game, and you should know everyone in a group has at least a tentative role in a pickup group, or an advantage for being there. As for a role, tell that to your healer, they are pigeonholed the worst of any class. We don't have it so bad, at least we can pull, cc,melee, offtank, etc.. Ask the next pickup group looking for dps if they want a bard, if they know our versatility, or you tell them what you can do if they don't. You may get a tell the first time 'Ok we can try it' But after the adv/whatever, with everything else you bring to the table, you will have illuminated yet another portion of the unwashed masses<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />
<br />
As for seb or velk, I was not saying to go there now, but was being facetious, as the days where mezzing 4 while eatin a sandwich and goofin around in chat is over, at least in the places you will find an exp pickup group.

<br />
Isn't that the truth?  Glad I'm not the only one that noticed that.
<br />

<br />
When I started playing eq in 99, I started a monk specifically because of the lack of need for weapons.  I liked that I didn't have to spend money on them.  I didn't know then what pulling was or that monks were good at it, that all came later as I leveled up.  I had similar experiences to what Casseopei had and after 4+ years and 64 levels, LDoN killed any ability I had to find a group outside of guildies or friends and I hung up the monk and started a bard.
<br />

<br />
Now the bard is 63, and just as Casseopei stated, in most situations people look to the bard for pulling.  Thankfully my guildies realize what else I can do and don't always make me pull, and even in ldon's it's sometimes the paladin or sk that does the pulling and does a fine job and let's me do cc when there's more than one.  But it wasn't till recently that I realized I had changed classes but still had the same job.  I don't mind so much as Cass seems to, but I do notice the irony.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Well, in my guild I have limited options for raid pulling.  I lead raids and we have two bards, one monk, and one SK.  The other bard is new to the guild and the level of raiding we are doing and so far I have primarily relied on her for group/raid functions other than pulling.  She may be a really good puller but I have not tested that yet.  The monk is possibly the best puller I have ever seen in EQ - but he's been offline with relocation/ISP issues for about 3 weeks and I am getting jittery waiting for him to be back on.  The SK is a very good puller, too but I haven't worked with him and relied on him as much so I tend to find it easiest, right now, to just do the pulling myself while also leading raids.  It's very taxing and I probably should either be training and evaluating the other bard or letting the SK do more.  I will say this -- when I need to go with our best precision pulling, the monk at point and me at slack is definitely our best shot, right now.  This notion that bards have become better pullers than monks is, I think, an exaggeration at best if not outright false.  I think that for some pulls, yes we are clearly superior.  I think for some pulls, monks are clearly superior.  But I think the quality of both bard and monk pullers is also dependent on the skill of the players as well as on the innate qualities of the class which means no matter how overpowered bards may seem to be, some of us probably suck as pullers.  Same was always true of monks when they were perceived as great pullers -- some of them were awful.  If I am in an XP group, odds are I am going to be the puller by default.  Sometimes that's great and makes it more fun and entertaining.  Sometimes that's bloody annoying.  But I do not consider it a design flaw of the game so much as a personal perference of myself and those around me.</span></td>

Other uses a bard has to a group:

So even if i'm grouped with a monk or ranger I always ask them if they want to pull because my usefullness goes far beyond pulling. (I do politely warn them if their pulls are consistently sloppy or they're not fast enough I'll take over)I'm not attacking you. I just think you're focusing on all the bad points of a bard.

<br />
Can you not do things while you're pulling? I'll admit, usually pulling takes such time that the song lineup will drop before I get back to the camp (where they are still finishing the mob), but in LDoNs that  is usually less than a tick. Even the most important song (in my opinion), Marr, would only add the group another 21 or so mana. Hardly measureable.
<br />

<br />
I simply wish to state that, aside from adding (comparatively) excessive dps from dots, everything we can do, we can do as pullers too.</span></td>

as for the other posts; im aware of all this, and i do all play this; when im pulling in ldon its usually my job to also enhance everyone roles ( duh) help the chanter ( if we have one *gasp* by locking the mobs down, or locking his pet who just broke charm, etc.. as for clerics, i also play one ( although lowbie still) and they do more than just healing, but you know right at start that your going to have a fixed job, not like bard.  i wouldnt start a cleric with the idea ill be the best nuker or puller the game ever saw <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-13.gif" border="0" alt="LOL" hspace="2" />
<br />

<br />
as for group; im probably the  most unlucky bard around as i never get the chance~ to group with a monk or a ranger or anyone else who could actually pull.. if im the best one to actually pull, im gonna do it. 
<br />

<br />
also, the day i wrote my rantwas the day where although i wasnt lfg, 3 persons sent me a tell for group, asking we need a puller for ldon.. bah! that means that even before i get to group, there will be no discussion on who will be puller, it will be me. 
<br />

<br />
*snicker* if i really want to play but really dont want to be a puller, i usually log the monk nowadays and subtly suggest that we get a bard for pulling...that is if i find a group o.0
<br />

<br />
have to keep in mind that this is about pick up group, with people you never really met; and since im playing mmpog to play with others, the statement dont do pick up group then is not really fun <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-8.gif" border="0" alt="Expressionless" hspace="2" /></span></td>

Hard LDoNs do require skill or gear to pull in though.  Or both ;o)
<br />

<br />
Was grouped with folks from a guild that were all time equipped (Pre GOD), from the &quot;Leet&quot; guild on our server.  The pali pulled.  He didnt paci or lull.  He just walked into the room and started killing stuff.  I was trying to CC and stuff, and the cleric said &quot;what are you doing?&quot;  I said mezzing the adds.  She said dont worry about it, just haste and DS.  
<br />
I was flabbergasted.
<br />
They didnt want me to pull.
<br />
They didnt want CC.
<br />
The cleric ask for haste and DS, NOT MANA.
<br />

<br />

<br />
What it boiled down to was this;  I was working with a group that practically lived in EQ.  They had the gear and the skills to make a Hard LGuK LDON look like a romp through the park.  No one took aggro from the pali for long, they either lost it, or he took it back.
<br />

<br />
Eventually I put in the AE slow/DOT Song, not sure how much it helped, but the cleric didnt mind healing me a little more.
<br />

<br />
Never felt so useless in a group before.
<br />

<br />
As for the original poster, hey if you are pulling ALL THE TIME, then something is wrong with your group selection.  We can, sure, but you dont HAVE too.  The beauty of being a bard is our adaptability, we can change our songs and the things we do in huge ways based on one party member change.  No other class has to pay so much attention as we do.  If you think the group is better served by you NOT pulling, then say so.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span><img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif" border="0" alt="Big Smile" hspace="2" />  that totally reminds me of a few nights ago.  I was playing on my alt cleric, level 50, my special little froggy.  We had a pickup group for an LDoN that was not bad.  Me, 2 rangers, a warrior, a chanter, and a bard.  We decided to do a hard, since really the normals at that level are way too easy and give too few points in reward.  Anyway, it all boils down to the fact that the bard had little idea on how to chain pull quickly and effectively.  When crunch time happened to pop up, he said he was going to try something new on the next pull.  He pulled the whole room!  I asked what he used... denon's desperate dirge...  <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-13.gif" border="0" alt="LOL" hspace="2" /> I told him to move over, I was pulling.  I loaded up pacify, atone, DA, and the level 1 nuke to pull with, and we were on our way.  I've done it before on LDoN's.  It's lots of fun to chain pull like a madman using a cleric.  Of course, it helps to have KEI <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-11.gif" border="0" alt="Cool" hspace="2" /></span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>I have a cleric at lvl 49 I used to play with, mainly to break the monotony with my bard and older warrior. At that level, clerics pull just fine, normal or hard. Even when not pulling I go all out on melee and have tanked adventures, using stuns and heals to hold aggro(boy does that piss off the tank). Fact was I was taking damage better, with shaman buffs and my own, I was putting myself up close to 3k hp and AC broke 1k. The deciding factor I'd say is 80% equipment and 20% ability.
<br />

<br />
You have to learn to balance mana and all that, but the fact is, if you don't have the hp/ac/mana pool from equipment no amount of ability to conserve mana will allow you to pull/tank and heal.
<br />

<br />
Its been hinted at and mentioned and I think its absolutely true. Equipment is a huge part of what a character can do, skill is generally the knowledge of how to do it, something thats not hard to come by.
<br />

<br />
This dynamic changes somewhat in a raid environment, certain events require certain strategies which would be made much harder or even impossible if using the wrong class for the situation. But in the general small group, I completely agree. Some classes have advantages, but it can be balanced by equipment and ability.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>In most cases, I agree with you.  Good gear makes a large difference.  I do have to disagree that &quot;skills&quot; are simply related to knowledge.  For instance... we all know it's possible to AE kite like friggin madmen, but not all of us do.  We all know swarm kiting is great exp and can be done very well by bards, but not all of us do that either.  Some people know what songs to play when, how to pull in adventures, how to keep several mobs under control at a time, but are still just mediocre at best.  Skill requires knowledge, but knowledge does not necessarily imply skill.  It's all about application of that knowledge.  Point being... an average player in uber gear is still just average.  They're not contributing all that they could be, and they're probably not trying that hard.  An uber player in average gear may be hurting a little because of his lack of hp/ac/mana/whatever, but I'll still want him in my group over some jackass who thinks he knows what's happening.

This is one of the great myths about uberguilds out there. I've actually had a few interactions with some of the 'top' bards on my server and I've not exactly been impressed. One was many years ago in Seb, a bard who was a lovely person but just a hopeless player - they are currently my server's top guild's second bard. The other was in Luclin where another bard from the top guild (who has since given up) swore blind that AA stacked with our other slows, and could visibly see a substantial difference between the mob hit rates.
<br />

<br />
That's not to say that all of the bards in the big guilds are poor. The oldest bard in the top guild is known as a good player by many, and whilst I have not seen him play I have no doubt of his talent. Also the best (current) bard I have ever seen is in the second guild on my server. I know he is good coz I taught him a little myself.  <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-5.gif" border="0" alt="Wink" hspace="2" /> :lol
<br />

<br />
Also, on the subject of LDoNs, I also usually do not slow or mez. And if we have a shammy or chanter along we ask them not to either. The DS is just far too good to waste that way. It does help to have a decent cleric though, and if it's not my partner I'll slow adds til we can assess their ability. Besides that though I have found that treating each pull as a mini Exe trial wave is the best way for speed and efficiency through the dungeon. And no it is not an equipment thing - none of my regular group has EP gear.
<br />

<br />
Now hard adventures though, that's a different kettle of fish completely...

				<td colspan="2"><span>I should also mention that the guild I am talking about has been in the top 10 of pretty much all of the guild listings I have seen. Not in the Afterlife/Triton/FoH tier, but definitely only 1 step behind. I think my experiences are going to be pretty typical of uberguilds across all servers.
<br />

<br />
What you do need in most top end raiding guilds is the ability to follow orders without making huge gaping mistakes, and a good play-time. You do not necessarily need class skills, and showing flair might actually be detrimental to the overall raid machinery.
<br />

<br />
So no, I stick with my view that players, and bards especially, can show much greater skill levels in single group encounters than in an uberguild. And furthermore I would argue that there was much more skill to be shown in playing a bard during the Kunark era than there is now.
<br />

<br />
I have not met any bards I would consider 'good' in over a year, and noone 'exceptional' in more like 2 years. Of course if you consider 'good' to be playing the songs they are told to and nothing else then anyone with a programmable joystick is a 'good' bard. Personally I have higher standards...
