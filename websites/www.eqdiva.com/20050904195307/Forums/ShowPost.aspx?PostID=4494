				<td colspan="2"><span>I just wanted to relate some of my recent experiences you the members of this forum.  I would like mention that I am playing on the Brell Serilis server and that my main is a 45th Bard.  I realize that doesn't make me an expert on bards but please bare with me anyway.
<br />

<br />
I created a Druid alt a few months ago to play with some friends of mine that recently joined EQ.  Every time a bard asked for a group I enthusiastically invited them, knowing how much they could help.  Here is a recounting of my experiences so far:
<br />

<br />
1)  The first bard to join our group was in High Hold Pass at the orc camp.  I noticed early on that, while he was a decent mezzer, he refused to twist songs.  I asked him if he knew how to twist and he said yes.  I asked him why he wasn't twisting and got no reply.  The entire time he was in our group he would have either Hymn, Anthem or the Mez song going.  Never two at once.
<br />

<br />
2)  The second bard to join us must have thought he was a tank.  Only two songs came out of him the entire time he was in the group.  He played Anthem while fighting and Hymn while waiting.  He was always in the middle of the fighting and never once mezzed.  Once again I attempted to educate him on the finer points of a Bard's capabilities but go nowhere.
<br />

<br />
3)  Last, but certainly not least, the other night a 22nd Level Bard joined our Unrest basement group.  She was the opposite of Bard number 2.  She refused to fight!  She sat back with the 2 clerics in the group and played mana song exclusively.  When asked why she refused to fight she said, and I quote: &quot;I don't want to die.&quot;  Yes, she was a bit low level to be fighting in the basement but there were 2 clerics and 2 paladins in there to keep her alive.
<br />

<br />
Sorry for the rant but nothing in this game drives me crazier than seeing someone play their bard so badly and refuse to take advise.  The last one really made me shake my head.  I keep trying to convince my friends that Bards are great for groups but I can tell that with each succesive Bard Flop they believe me less and less.
<br />

<br />
Anyone else seeing these things or have I just been really unlucky recently?

				<td colspan="2"><span>Yes I have noticed this as well, and I think that I know at least one of the reasons.  With PoP, people are actually starting to understand how powerful bards can be when used correctly, particularly in the aspects of swarm and chant kiting.  They look at bards doing these things and say, hey that is awesome I wanna do that, so they go and make a bard.  Unfortunately, the main problem with this logic is twofold, one, we all know you can't really swarm or chant kite effectively until higher levels, and two, they are completely blind to the amount of work necessary to play a bard correctly.  Hence you get people like the ones you met, they don't know their class and they refuse to take advice.  People like that typically don't make it past level 20 or 30 as a bard though.  Anyway, that is my take on why some of this is happening.  Now granted, not all people who make a twink bard are like that, but I have met enough people who are that I am convinced this is one of the problems.  Best thing we can do is to keep trying to educate them as we see them, its all we can do.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I know they declined taking your advice, but maybe the person did not know what you meant by twisting?  When I started my serious bard, I had already tried the class.  It is a difficult one to learn.  There are lots of good online guides but I remember when I first started playing EQ I went to lvl 20 or so with a shaman without ever reading a guide or having anyone offer me much advice.  I'm sure I looked like a fool to many other Shamans and players.
<br />

<br />
Or what I was about to suggest, before I became unusually serious, was that perhaps the player on the other end had a steel hook for a hand, no fingers.  Everyone always forgets about out or work pirates.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>LMAO.  I'm pretty sure that most of us could still twist at least two songs even with a hook.
<br />

<br />
Seriously though, I see where you're coming from.  Perhaps they misunderstood when I asked if they knew how to twist.  I don't know.  One thing I do know, is that if they don't start learning then they are going to end up hating the bard class.  A bard that doesn't twist is less than half as powerful as they should be.

I realize that I am somewhat biased when it comes to the bard class and that I still have a lot to learn myself.  If they were just willing to take advise then I wouldn't have had a problem with them at all.
<br />

<br />
Oh well.  Thanks everyone for putting up with my rant.  I feel much better having put my fustrations out there.  Now I can let them go. (At least until the next time.<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-5.gif" border="0" alt="Wink" hspace="2" />)</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>OMG this is soo true! And unfortunately it is not only the low level bards that don't have a clue what a bard can do and how to play one.
<br />

<br />
I had a run-in with a bard on my server that at the time was 48 and chant kiting in PoD.  Over a period of 2 minutes he:
<br />

<br />
1) Sent me, the bard swarmkiting with 10 flies rats and larva, no less than 4 tells asking me all sorts of get-ta-know-ya type questions, despite my afk message saying I was swarm kiting and unable to reply.  
<br />

<br />
2) Proceeded to start chant kiting AROUND the rock I was swarm kiting up against as my boundary, ignoring several polite but firm say's that he was in grave danger of getting aggro yadda yadda yadda.
<br />

<br />
3) Refused to take any responsibility for causing my train wreck that killed me (until the next day that is, to his credit).
<br />

<br />
4) Has since been the butt of a lengthy rant on our server boards about asking newbie raid questions at 50 something, NOT LISTENING, training the raid party, etc. such that apparently the entire raid party cheered when he left.
<br />

<br />
5) Has done more to give bards a bad name on my server than I could hope to undo in a year.
<br />

<br />
That may be an extreme example, but I have had several opportunities to group with other bards, and most don't even know the songlist, let alone want to discuss what we each are playing so we don't cancel each other out.  
<br />

<br />
In short, I have found darn few bards (in game, not here, hehe) that actually KNOW what they are doing. As Susperia so aptly put it, a bard that knows what he/she's doing, is a rare commodity, COMPARED to the sheer number of bards in existance.  It takes hard work to be a bard, if you don't want to work, go be a tank or nuker.  I've played both and they are cake (end game, soloing or pulling excluded).
<br />

<br />
IMHO

				<td colspan="2"><span>OK, Gotta put my 2cp in here since I'm a twinked newbie bard and you're all bashing me along with those others by grouping us in generalities. I spend at LEAST an hour a day here looking at info to better myself. I have printouts of ALL the info for songs, have made a seperate file &amp; printout that covers only the places to purchase each song. I purchase the next 5 songs that I will need before I reach those levels, I twist my A** off (which considering it's size doesn't really hurt that much). I've worked on my Baking alot, tailoring and Jewelry making a little, mainly stopped those because I was told it was a waste of my time. I've gone from level 1-25 in 4 weeks mostly soloing. I was PL'd for my first 3 levels, mainly someone healing me so I didn't die immediately, (this was before twinking). 
<br />
I meet people all the time who are nice and helpful, they give me tips, PP, and general help. I have what must be the world's biggest lag issue, but I've learned to live with it. If I group I warn people that if I die, it could be 10-15 minutes before I'm back with them, depending on if I have to zone alot. I've disbanded myself more than once so that the group could invite someone else rather than wait for me. Most of them wait for me anyway. I've made friends with numerous High level characters, from more guilds than I can name. I can't even group with these people, but they'll chat with me and sometimes go out of their way to come help me with buffs or equipment that they think is better than mine.
<br />
I also meet A**holes regularly. Yesterday, in Marus Seru (sp?) I grouped with both a cleric and druid who did NOTHING!! They sat at the top of a hill let me tank, and twist, no buffs, no help from them AT ALL! Then they complained when I told them I was leaving the group. Soloing today I died 3 times, but at least I knew it was my fault and not because my group wasn't doing their part.
<br />
People, It's not just bards who need educating. Some of us NEW bards work our butts off learning the ins and outs of what we can do with each new song, (BTW that cataloging song sucks, haven't found a good place to use it yet.) I try to keep all of my music skills maxed, only my slashing skill is any good for fighting....
<br />

<br />
Wow! I just looked at how long this was getting, sorry.. stepping down off my songstage...
<br />
just please, don't lump us all together. And anyone who wants to group with a lvl 25 bard who's always willing to learn more, come meet me on the Torvonillous server, I'm around fairly often.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Elysannda, please don't get me or the others wrong, we were not throwing ALL low level bards, twinked or not, into the category of being bad.  On the contrary. I find anyone that comes here is hungry for information to better themselves as a bard, and knows what it takes to be a great bard.  It only takes the willingness to work your A$$ off to do it and it is clear you do.  Folks should be honored to have you in their group.  Keep that up and you will be in tell h*ll all the time turning down groups.
<br />

<br />
If I came across as saying all the bards I've met suck, I appologize.  I just mentioned some notible problem children frm my experience to let folks know that just cause a bard is level 50+, doesn't mean they know their class (/boggle).  Grouping with them for 5 minutes though can tell you volumes if they are a good bard or not.  If not, RUN, selos a blazin' the other way.  Don't get thrown in with the folks giving bards a bad name.

  I think the answer to your question is;
<br />

<br />
Bards are hard to play well.  Begining players choose a race/class they think they can handle.  Established players, who have grouped with a well played bard are often in awe.  &quot;I did not know bards could do THAT!&quot;   Once they have that experence, they think &quot;It would be fun to play a Bard&quot; .. they twink one .. and then preceide to give us a bad name because they twink-get PLd and never really learn the class.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I know how a lot of you feel. My bard is my one and only character. When I was new I asked tons of questions from every bard I saw in Kelethin (at the bank pre-PoP days).
<br />

<br />
I learned a lot from them and from these forums and now have a good time helping others.
<br />

<br />
What I DO see, though, are a lot of twinked alts trying to act 'uber' and get the 'phat lewts' yada yada yada and not do much else to help their groups or themselves. Do all the twinks or new bards do this? Course not. But a lot of them do without a clue and it's a tad frustrating sometimes.
<br />

<br />
Case in point: Few months back I was in oot killing Allizesaur and heard in /ooc &quot;Need some help with Quag.&quot; T'was a level 42 bard wanting his epic piece. I immediately responded and went to help the lad. Minute or so later Quag is no more and he has his piece. Not only did the bard not know how to kite he also didn't have 2/3 of the songs of his level. 
<br />

<br />
I asked him how he got to his level without using our assortment of songs and his answer ...well...he said he , &quot;hadn't 'needed' them yet.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
Case in point as he rises in levels and sends me 'links' of the loot he's aquiring and he seems to be learning as he goes. It's a long road for everyone...just some harder than others.

				<td colspan="2"><span>As your first character, bards are one of the more difficult classes to learn to play well, so I wouldn't be too upset that you didn't learn to twist before 30.  You had a more difficult time getting to 30 than if you were twisting, but you did it.
<br />

<br />
As for twisting like there's no tomorrow, yeah its work, hard work at times.  But that's what bards do, that's what is expected of bards, and we can so why not?
<br />

<br />
That being said, I get downtime, I play manasong in downtimes, and if I go AFK in battle I chose one song to play and just head to grab a drink of water (letting group / raid leader know I'll be right back).  
<br />

<br />
When I want to take a break, I move to trader mode and go read a book, or if I want to still play EQ, I switch to my alts.  Sometimes I rest my fingers etc. by, heaven forbid, using the mouse to twist.
<br />

<br />
Our power is in our ability to twist songs on the run.  No other class can do it.  Take that ability away from a bard and he's a lousy tank, pure and simple.  We have litterally half the hps of a pure tank and hit for about half to 2/3 damage over time as they do.
<br />

<br />
I'm sure if you and your group agree, you can work something out, but rest assured that if your group has the choice of a twisting and a non-twisting bard, the twister will win out. IMHO, no one song is as powerful as 3 songs 5 levels below it.  So I'd rather have a level 55 bard twist 3 or 4 songs, than a level 60 twisting one (even Rondo).
<br />

<br />
I don't love it, but I love what it does for myself and my group.  Let's just say if they took away twisting, I am not sure I'd play my bard anymore.  If that means I love it than fine, but my mind is always racing on ways to cheat and have the computer twist for me, hehe.

I'll end with my guild's name... To each his own!

<br />
Never let it be said that I disapprove of all newbie bards.  I would love to group with any bard that played their class well or even those that played not so well but was willing to take a little advise.  And to keep things in perspective I can honestly say that the worst group member I have had with my newbie Druid was another druid.  I have no high level druids, though, and don't post on druid websites so I thought I would rant about the class that I do know something about.
<br />

<br />
Camdori,
<br />

<br />
I agree with you about the scarcity of the Human Bard.  I am one as well but I have yet to see another one.  Half-Elves and Wood Elves abound but the Human Bard is an endangered species.
<br />

<br />
Algebra,
<br />

<br />
As far as twisting goes, I have to agree with Sinfonian and Camdori.  Without twisting bards would be required to group to gain experience after 35ish.  I don't love twisting, but I love our ability to twist.  Twisting makes all of the hard work you put into a bard worthwhile.  I sometimes am placed in the dreaded tank role and it's like torture.  I get stunned so often that keeping 3 songs up is almost impossible.  I get so depressed after situations like that because I see how weak bards are at melee.  But then I go out and find a yellow and chant kite it without getting touched and all is right with the world once again.

My bard was twinked with what I could salvage off a 27 warrior and about 2k for instruments.  But then again, I work my tail off to be the best bard I can be.  There is where the distinction lies.  Work hard at any class and you will be great at it.  Bards are no exception. I don't even think of twisting anymore, I just do it. 11...22...33...44...11... hehe

I know this problem well. Normally I can keep my skills up with my level, but when I went to Paludal and leveled 3 in one day, all of a sudden I was BEHIND. And I didn't have a wind instrument or a brass one. I immediately bought both. Spent a day in POK next to the bank with the Charisma song trained on a guard getting wind up, then went out into GFAY and sang Denon's for a day. Nothing hurt me, they were to low, and I was able to pick up stuff needed for baking and tailoring skills. (silks, meats, and wings...) Now I try to keep up as I go, if I level, I train.

				<td colspan="2"><span>As I've said lots in the past, I'm a grouping bard by nature.  I'd swarm and chant kite more than I do if only my pathetic connection didn't drop me just about every time I set out to solo.
<br />

<br />
That said, I've never encountered problems with keeping my skills up to par (although I did have a minor ordeal or two raising brass when I first got it).  I have, however, run into entirely too many lowbie bards who don't know what they're doing (on my alts and when watching lowbie RL friends of mine play).  Most of these can be taught to twist, etc., however, and I don't mind helping 'em out.  What I -do- get irritable about is when I am grouped with a bard (on one of my alts) who knows how to twist but refuses to do it on the basis that &quot;low level songs suck.&quot;
<br />

<br />
In other words, he/she turns on Hymn of Restoration and melees without singing/playing anything else, despite knowing that twisting Anthem de Arms, Hymn, and maybe Jaxon's would aid the group considerably more while giving him/her good practice for twisting.
<br />

<br />
I guess what I'm trying say here is that I don't see how bards who refuse to work at playing the class at low levels expect to be able to play the class well at high levels, especially in a group situation where one has to know exactly what songs to twist and in what order to make the most of a given group setup.
<br />

I am proud of any bard who will work at the class and experiment with various twists in an attempt to figure out what songs best fit the situation and group type, and I don't mind if their twists fall apart due to lag factors (like my own on occasion), but lazy bards get on my nerves.  Thank goodness all of the bards in my current guild (we have more than a guild on my server usually has) are intelligent, hardoworking bards.  <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" /> </span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>As I've said lots in the past, I'm a grouping bard by nature.  I'd swarm and chant kite more than I do if only my pathetic connection didn't drop me just about every time I set out to solo.
<br />

<br />
That said, I've never encountered problems with keeping my skills up to par (although I did have a minor ordeal or two raising brass when I first got it).  I have, however, run into entirely too many lowbie bards who don't know what they're doing (on my alts and when watching lowbie RL friends of mine play).  Most of these can be taught to twist, etc., however, and I don't mind helping 'em out.  What I -do- get irritable about is when I am grouped with a bard (on one of my alts) who knows how to twist but refuses to do it on the basis that &quot;low level songs suck.&quot;
<br />

<br />
In other words, he/she turns on Hymn of Restoration and melees without singing/playing anything else, despite knowing that twisting Anthem de Arms, Hymn, and maybe Jaxon's would aid the group considerably more while giving him/her good practice for twisting.
<br />

<br />
I guess what I'm trying say here is that I don't see how bards who refuse to work at playing the class at low levels expect to be able to play the class well at high levels, especially in a group situation where one has to know exactly what songs to twist and in what order to make the most of a given group setup.
<br />
