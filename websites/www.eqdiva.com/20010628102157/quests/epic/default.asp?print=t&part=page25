	<h4>Page 25</h4>
To get Page 25, go to South Karana and talk to the wood-elf bard named Kelkin Mekia, she is between the centaurs and treants along the zone line that is a "drop-off". She needs the strings for her lute. The items she needs to make the strings for her lute are as follows:

<ol>
<li><b>Guts from a named chromatic drake in Skyfire Mountains</b>  - Eldric the Old: about level 51 and he summons 
<li><b>Guts from the named red wurm in Burning Woods</b> - drops off named wurms Nezekezena and Phurzikon
<li><b>Guts from the Huge Oynx Drake in Rathe Mountains</b> - Blackwing: level 40 something
</ol>

A few notes regarding these 3 guts:
<br><br>
<img src="/images/epic/imgEpicNezekezena.jpg" alt="Nezekezena in Burning Woods" border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="right" width="200" height="262">
To get the Red Wurm Gut you need to kill one of the named wurms in the Burning Woods - either <b>Nezekezena</b> or <b>Phurzikon</b>. Both will be high 40's to 51 in level, so at level 51, they can summon you and gate. Both these spawn at location (-470, -2550), so if you camp the spawn, you should be fine if they decide to gate back. A full group of low 50's can kill these wurms. Something spawns every two minutes, whether it be a PH or a Nekekezena or a Phurzikon...<br clear="right"><img src="/images/epic/imgEpicPhurzikon.jpg" alt="Phurzikon in Burning Woods" border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="right" width="150" >This is also a great camp for some fast experience, as the spawn time is 2 minutes, and there are lots of wanderers. You could convince a mage to camp it with you, as they also need the Burnt Embers for their epic, which is a much rarer drop.<br><br>The red wurm guts drop plentifully, so you'll get one for sure if you camp this area a few hours. I have heard reports that a recent patch has allowed a gut to only drop from one of these named wurms, so please let me know and I will fix it on the guide.
<br><br clear="right">
<img src="/images/epic/imgEpicBlackwing.jpg" alt="Blackwing in Rathe Mountains" border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="right" width="200" height="241">
<b>Blackwing</b> in Rathe Mountains will spawn after clearing out the drakes in that area. It is the south-western part of the zone, and will spawn out of the loc (-1700, -15). Keep killing everything that spawn at this loc, including drakes and basalisks, and you will get Blackwing within an hour or so. Be very careful of the named drakes in this area. Zazamouhk, an evil enchanter sphinx and her pet are up on the hill but don't seem to move around much. She is around level 40. If you are agnostic and wear your Dark-elf illusion, you can go right up to her. Rharzar, however, is a level 55 green drake. Every bard I talked to that has camped Blackwing has been killed by Rharzar, including myself, he hit me so fast I couldn't even run one step. If you have him on tracking and are alone, do your best to avoid him, or come back another day. He is for the SK epic, so convince an SK in your guild to join you and bring a few groups down to kill Rharzar.<br><br>
Stay at the spawn spot mentioned above and you should be fine. You can chant-kite Blackwing, or melee him. At level 47, I discovered that I could melee these drakes easily.
<br><br clear="right">
<b>Eldric the Old</b> in Skyfire Mountains has a spawn spot of loc (500, -4000). Eldrig is a named Chromodrac, level 51. He will cast spell on you, but will dispell it right away. 
<br><br>Go north from the OT zone until you hit the spot. Every 15 minutes a mob will spawn, and start walking towards OT. If nothing is spawning, you must track down the placeholder and kill it before the spot will start re-spawning. Once this is accomplished, Eldric will spawn regularly. I am not positive that this is the only spawn spot of Eldrig. I have seen him up once, and he walks a path from this spot to the Burning Woods zone and back.
<br><br>When I finally found him up, my group fear kited him. I played my fear song, and fear song only. He went down quickly. We had 2 bards (levels 51 and 53), 53 warrior, 53 cleric, and 57 druid.
<br><br>
More details to come as I finish this part of the quest... Please send me more info if you have it.
<br><br>
Give the three guts back to Kelkin in South Karana and you will get page 25.
