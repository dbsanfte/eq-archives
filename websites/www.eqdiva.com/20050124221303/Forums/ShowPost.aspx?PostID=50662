				<td colspan="2"><span> Lets here about your bad experiences with GM's/Guides.
<br />

<br />
 My most recent was a few days ago. I got stuck to the wall above the stairs in the Halfling bank in PoK. So I'm waiting to use the /rewind command. All of the sudden....You have fallen for 20,000 damage...........Loading please wait. 
<br />
 
<br />
 So I loot my corpse except one item and /petition. It says to /report. I am in PoK so I have lots of spam chatter on my screen. I realize my damage probably won't show in my first report so I scroll and do another report this time making sure the damage and death clearly shows in chat window. I also explained in detail what happened. 
<br />

<br />
 I check my petition the next day and there is a reply. It basically says he can't see the 20k damage or evidence of falling in my report. Therefore he cannot rez me.  WTF!!!!
<br />

<br />
 I then add a comment back requesting him to reset my rez timer so I can get a PC rez seeing how it expired waiting on a GM rez. That was two days a go and no reply or timer reset.
<br />

<br />
 What I can't understand is why they don't give the benefit of doubt in these situation and just do the rez. This 20k falling problem is fairly common there is actually a 20k damage topic built into the /petition system. Are people really that hard up they have to scam a free GM rez? I think they should do the rez and put your name in there data bank so if these things happen frequently they will figure out who the scammers are.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>When I was level 16, the lead GM on Luclin changed my name.  He actually hung around debating it with me for 15 minutes before finally saying, &quot;Look, this is how it is -- pick a new name and move on.&quot;  Despite the fact that I think the naming policy always was and always will be so much BS, he was very courteous about it.  The one other time I messed with a GM was when I did the General Bragmur walk for the 8th shawl.  The general got stuck in a pathing glitch and after spending a half hour trying to get him out of it, I gave up and petitioned.  Had a GM there with in 30 seconds -- I was almost unconscious from shock!  Replaced my turn-in items and said wait for the next patch.  He left and somehow, we figured out how to break the general loose so I never needed the spare turn-ins.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I have heard a ton of horror stories about GMs and Guides -- I have had to deal with them directly 2 times and had only positive things to say about how they conducted themselves.  I know that isn't always the case, but I guess I was lucky.</span></td>

<br />

<br />
Well Im a casual gamer and I logged on and get invited to an open raid against Saryrn. The raid is going fine all the named are up on the way. Our main targets were Saryrn and The Keeper of Sorrows, though. Anyway...We got to the part where we port up after killing Mareeq the Prophet or something like that. And then guess what happened? The server shut down. So I go to the chat and theres a chat room called Karana-KOS. We were all talking about what happened then server came back up 7 minutes later. Fastest patch recorded. When we got back up there we found out a few things. We ported down back to Mareeq, 10 people died where we all were after we got ported up, and Saryrn despawned. I checked on my track and all named are back up except Saryrn, and Sorrowsong was up instead. So we had 15 minutes or so to re-form the raid and re-kill the prophet. We have noticed that about 19 people are missing from the server resesting but we decided to go on anyway. We ported up and then we see the bodies popping away. So we lost another 10 people. Everything from there went fine and we killed KOS .. but im upset that Saryrn despawned and i didnt get my flag. Altogether we lost 29 people from a full raid but it's all better now I guess. 
<br />

<br />
By the way... GMs are ALWAYS on. It's just that they can hide from /who for various reasons.

Think about it... with nobody around to tell idiots how to do things, they'll either adapt well enough to figure stuff out on their own and stop bugging us, or give up!  Go a step further and remove all warning labels from potentially (and in some cases, not potentially) dangerous objects... Then all the stupid people who can't adapt just end up dead!  It seems a bit utilitarian, perhaps a little insensitive, but who cares!  At least those of us who are suffering because of the mistakes of others are living better lives.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Argh.  GM's want proof for everything now.  Check this out.  I was pulling the giants (including the named) in Storms for a little miniraid my guild was doing.  We cleared out the desert giant camp pretty well, then pulled a named.  Killed him.  Right before anyone can loot, the zone crashes.  Everyone's booted to character select.  As I was the puller, the zone last remembered me being in the desert giant camp.  So I log in to a bunch of pissed off giants whupping my a$.  Of course I die, and proceed to petition it.  I mean, not only did we lose three medallions for the BoT key, but I also got killed because SOE's server took a crap (oh yeah, and a paladin lost his pants somehow as well).  So the raid ends, my petition is left open for a while... time goes on, no answer... 24 hours, no reply... 48 hours!  Finally I get an automated answer.  Basically, it said &quot;Sorry, you have no proof so we don't have to believe you.  We're deeply sorry for your inconvenience though, really we are.&quot;  Yeah, right.  And monkeys will start flying out of my a$.  So no rez, no loot, and 48 hours of waiting... but I'm not angry.  No, I stopped getting angry at CS for not offering more help to people long ago.

				<td colspan="2"><span>S*%T Happens. Toons die. The difference between a 96 rezz and a GM rezz so small it's not even worth bitching about. The couple hundread plat you COULD end up donating if you cant find a nice cleric to 96 rezz you for free is also easily replaceable. --- Servers go down. It's happened since the begining of EQ. When the server resets all spawn timers (except elemental gods) are reset. If an item was never looted and a new &quot;character save&quot; was never done showing you in fact HAD that item, it won't be replaced - no matter what. I'd make a bet every single person to ever play EQ has been affected by this in one way or another. It's frustrating -- sure, but it's certainly not the GM's fault.
<br />

<br />
Guide's/GM have a certain set of rules that they are required to follow. They cannot simply give everyone whatever they ask for. In addition, as was stated above, THOUSANDS of people file petitions making insane requests and demands that will NEVER be filled, every single day. 
<br />

<br />
If you were in a PoP zone (they have GY's) just get a rezz. Don't wait around for a GM rezz that's a whole 4% better and let your corpse rot while you wait. That's assinine. If you let this happen you deserve to lose the full 100%. 
<br />

<br />
In my experience with GM's anything that was ever VITAL has always been taken care of by the GM, or an out of game email to customer support. It might have taken awhile, but it was taken care of. When something was not proveable and could not be confirmed, if it was REALLY THAT DIRE that it be done, it was done by the GM. They gave benefit of the doubt. If it was something that was EASILY replaced - ie 4% exp or a loot that drops EVERY SINGLE spawn on a certain mob, it might NOT be replaced if it was questionable. --- Frustrating as all h*ll, maybe, but certainly not the GM's fault. The GM didn't make the server go down. The GM didn't cause a bug through bad code writing. The GM didn't set up the rules they have to follow. Take it easy on these folks. They are doing their job and trying to fulfill any petitions that are reasonable, proveable, and IMPORTANT. 
<br />

<br />
It's not even worth sending in a petition for a GM rezz if a cleric is available to rezz you. I consider that a waste of a petition that clogs the que. In the time you have to wait for your petition to be answered you could have replaced your exp about 10 times over. You standing around waiting on a GM wastes a great deal more of your time than losing that exp did. You are more guilty of punishing yourself by NOT just taking a rezz and moving on than the GM is that wouldn't give you back your 4%. </span></td>

I have never heard of anyone dying to the 20k falling damage with levi on ~
<br />

<br />
There ARE zones where levi is not allowed, but to fall for 20k in a zone where it is is just laziness.  I shrugged, bit the bullet, and shelled out for my SS boots so I didnt have to mem spellsets all the time, but no one ever accused me of not being lazy myself.  They're decently nice to have anyway.
<br />

<br />
At any rate, the way that this pertains to this thread is that the GMs don't fix bugs, they only try to deal with the aftereffects.  Isn't it better to try to avoid the bug, especially a well known one like this, than to expect the GM to fix it every time it happens, to every player?</span></td>

You waste a heck of lot MORE of your time putting in a petition and waiting for an answer. And you potentially risk seeing your rezz timer expire altogether. So obviously wasting your time is not your main concern. Are you instead arguing on principal that the GM should come running in the flash of an eye any time you put in a petition, and you shouldn't have to wait, AND the the GM should just take it on faith that everything you say is absolutely 100% on the level?
<br />

<br />
Problem is, there are a LOT of people that play this game that use every cheat, hack, exploit, and dirty little trick they can come up with to try and &quot;beat the system.&quot; It's completely unfortunate that those people are ruining it for everyone else, but again - The GM has a set of rules they have to follow. Some of those rules were put in place specifically to discourage people from running to a GM everytime they want something, and using the age old &quot;I pay your salary, so I'm right&quot; excuse. 
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">They should be logging 20k dives anyway,</span></blockquote>
<br />
I agree completely. And the 2 times it's hapened to me I've been sure to say so in a /bug - and then I sent a cleric a tell for a rezz.

Actually, no it isn't. It's the GM's job to monitor the servers and enforce the rules of the EULA and the play nice policies. But-- yes, PART of their job is to pull petitions out of the que and respond to them as per the rules that have been set up for them. The new petition system also sets priority levels on certain kinds of bugs/mishaps/happenings to assist them in &quot;wadeing through the river of s$%t&quot; that is the petition que. Although I haven't personally seen the priorities, I'm willing to bet that making sure one individual player gets back the 4% of exp they lost to a 20k bug is somewhere around priority level 10,000. Why? because there are a LOT more OTHER things that could be affecting 10's or 100's or 10's of 1000's of people at the same time that need to be corrected, and their are only so many things a GM can respond to.

This is a PERFECT example of something that should be /report 'ed right away. Along with taking some SS's and logs of the ENTIRE conversation and Emailed to Customer Support -- to make sure that this particular GM is repremanded / fired. The GM's have a &quot;code of conduct&quot; that they must follow, just as you have one in the EULA. If they came out and insulted you through no provication of yours they won't be a GM for long. HOWEVER, If they instead explained to you that your request could not be fulfilled, and gave you a reason why BUT you disagreed and flipped out on them because of anger or frustration that's another issue entirely.
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------
<br />
No, I'm not a GM, I've never been a GM of a MMORPG, but I have spent the majority of my working adult life in a General Manager positions in customer service related businesses. I can't begin to tell you about the vast numbers of flat out insufferable customers with completely unreasonable DEMANDS - reguardless of a contract or set of rules they signed or verbally agreed to. And almost to a man, when they don't get their way they either throw a temper tantrum, or throw out the old &quot;I pay your salary&quot; line. -- To which my responce is , ---- No, you don't. I've looked at my check. Your signature is nowhere on it. XXXXXX company pays my salary. I'm sure of it, i've checked already. xxxxxxxx company has already given me a set of guidelines that I have to follow, and one of them says that I can't do what you've requested. Now since THEY pay my salary, Im going to listen to them, but here's a phone number/email/mailing address for you to contact them. Feel free to discuss with them any further issues you may have. If you'd like to report me, my name is xxxxxx xxxxxxx. Have a very plesent day --- NEXT!!---
<br />

<br />
Because I have the background that I do, I can completely understand the position that the GM's are in. And I also understand that if they are unable, or unwilling to give me what I want and I feel that is completely unfair, I can take it to the next level ...

<br />
I have never realy had a problem with GM service. I'v talked to a few about some little things but nothing to shatter my world. I'v fallen for 20k But it was off of the Ramp to keal. The one time I fell thru the world I had Levi on. And I was able to run back thru a wall. 
<br />

<br />
I did get stuck in a tree before rewind. A guild member came and cast everthing they could on me. Finally She nocked me out of it without having to resort to a port. I bug reported it and that was that. With so many people having the same issue they initialized the rewind comand.
<br />

<br />
THere should be a check in the system. If you fell for 20k and your not near a drop off or didn't just have levi on it should give you 1hp of health. 
<br />

<br />
In fact they should do that for all falls. If you fall and it would normally take you below your hp total it dosn't It stops at 1hp. This would solve alot of problems.
<br />

<br />
I like what a group of Clerics do. THey have a chat channle called 911 on Prexus. Its basically a emergency respons channle that people use for reses. Or better yet. A Sole binder type toon in certain zones for a price can sommon your corpse and rez you. It would be like 500 plat or so. This whould stop alot of peoples winning. So you have to spend 500 plat. However the Mob keeps a log of all such activities so maybe they can be used to prove where and what so that you may get reembursed. Bahh. 
<br />

<br />
For me Dieing is part of the game. So are bugs. Everygame I have ever played has had bugs. Dosn't keep me from injoying them. Everquest is a HUGE game. With a lot of code. And with such a huge player base I am suprised it works as good as it does.

I made a total of ZERO petitions in the 4 years before this stupid DX9 patch went in and introduced hundreds of bugs that should have been eliminated in testing and even then I ignored most of them, but enough is enough.  I provided the documentation they demanded and a number of GM's told be to go away, I wasn't getting the rez.  I tried the other options and they said largely the same thing.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Personally, GM's themselves aren't all that bad.  Most have a pretty good sense of humor, and fit the postition of customer service well.  There are exceptions of course, but for the most part they're courteous.  This thread should really be renamed to Rules GM's/Guides have to follow suck.  Yeah, I bitched and moaned about not getting my 4%, big deal.  In the end I know it's pointless, and I understand it's not the fault of the GM.  I took the cleric rez, I got on with life; it's a game after all.  I was just relaying my experience with how things are.

<br />
Zeri, I hate to break it to you but you're not special.  No GM is going to break or bend rules for just you.  That too harsh for you?  Too bad.  If you feel otherwise, then take your issues up to higher people.  Don't get angry at those who are doing the job that you claim to pay for.
<br />

<br />
You know what?  I have an awesome idea.  Let's just have GM's do what everyone wants them to do.  Every single petition is answered and every single wish is granted without question.  Deleted your epic on accident?  That's ok, here's a new one.  I don't need proof.  Someone called you a jerk because you trained them a few times?  No problem, their account is deleted!  You pay for me, so I'll do whatever it is you ask of me.  I'm the magic GM and I make life so much better for people like you who want their world to be perfect.  Have a nice day.
