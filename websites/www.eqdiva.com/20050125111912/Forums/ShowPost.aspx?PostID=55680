				<td colspan="2"><span>hello all.. have a few question about playing a brad and any info would help out alot. my bestfriend recently quit eq and left me his lvl 65 bard. and i for one dont have the slightest clue how to play him. was looking for some ideas on spell sets and such for different situations.
<br />

<br />
i play on a pvp server. normally play a monk. here is what im looking for.
<br />

<br />
1. spell sets for raiding.
<br />

<br />
2.spell sets for being a puller since i see bards do a h*ll of a job pulling for my guild.
<br />

<br />
3. spell sets for solo. i read something about charm and chant solo stuff.
<br />

<br />
4. spell sets for grouping.
<br />

<br />
5. must have spells. kinda like those you would always keep up in any rot.
<br />

<br />
6. pvp. looking for just the general spells that most would pvp with. mind you we often have guild vs guild and alot of 3 on 1 and such. 
<br />

<br />
the bard has over 300 aa needs one mob for time.has epic and i guess has all spell except proably god and such but does have the general 65.
<br />

<br />
thanks for any and all help givin to this thread..
<br />

People who play bards learn their skills from lvl 1.  This class is not one that you can inherit and expect to know how within a few days.  You'll make a fool of yourself, your toon's reputation, and above all you'll effect the good reputation if bards if you are terrible at playing yours.

One suggestion is to read all the guides here and practice with your bard in newbie zones by yourself.   <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-5.gif" border="0" alt="Wink" hspace="2" />

				<td colspan="2"><span>I must say, Saltydog's situation is not quite the same as an EBay bard, but the impact is the same. You have seen bards played well and not-so-well, and now you have an opportunity to jump into an uberbard.  Congratulations. What the posters above said is basically true, bards are one of, if not the hardest class to learn to play well in the game.  My primary advice is for you to ask your buddy as many questions as you can, and read this site like your bard career depended on it.  There are guides to do just about anything here.  Reasearch things yourself rather than ask questions. Folks that have carpel tunnel from working up to 65 themselves don't take kindly to newbie questions from uberbards.
<br />

<br />
My suggestion to you is to 1) learn to twist 3 or 4 songs constantly and set up hotkeys to help if you wish, 2) study the songlist and get Reed's spreadsheet and sleep with it by your bedstand, 3) practice practice practice, just like you were 12 and your parents made you play the piano, 4) start slow, maybe do some LDoNs with guildies that know you are new to this, twist, pull, slow, haste and maybe even CC for a few LDoNs and you will have a good feel for what you can do.
<br />

<br />
Good luck, if your goal is to fill vacancy in your guild by taking over the bard duties.

If you have a bunch of close friends in the game who are willing to help you learn and they know that you dont know what you are doing, then read the guides and understand the songs and try things out with your friends to back you up.  You should be a passable bard in no time (weeks).  Just don't inflict yourself on the unsuspecting until you have managed the basics.</span></td>

<br />

<br />
If you must do as you say you want to, please read the guides linked to the left. They will give you a much better idea of how to adapt your song lineup to different situations. Then, come here with your thoughts on what might work(or what you tried in game) and ask questions about how you might better play your bard. Asking flat out for tips and tricks and an end-all song list for every situation is a slap in the face for all the bards who worked up normally through the levels.
<br />

<br />
Heck, if I &quot;came into&quot; a 65 monk with 300AAs and nearly flagged for time and popped over to Monkly business saying I have no idea how to play my monk, they would not be so kind in their greeting either.
<br />

<br />
Ask thoughtful questions after you've given it a little effort, don't ask empty questions and think people will be able to explain all the little details that you can only gain through experience.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Hey Saltydog,
<br />

<br />
First off, gratz on the new account.  That's awesome!  I recently inherited a 65 chanter &amp; ranger myself so I know the feeling your going through.  Unfortunatly bards really are about the hardest class to play and even harder to play well.  That may be part of the reason for the not so friendly responses from the other bards on these boards.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, what you need to ask yourself is, am I going to make the bard my main?  If the answer is no, then you can probably go through the guides and try out the stategies they suggest.  Check out reed's spreadsheet to figure out what the songs are and what they do.  Unfortunatly a bard is not a class that lends itself to two boxing, so if you decide to use it in that manner, don't expect the bard to do much more thand minor dps &amp; mana.
<br />

<br />
If the answer is yes though, you may seriouly consider creating a low level bard to go through the basic training with, because you have a lot to learn.  For example, pulling is an art, and requires great amounts of practice and study.  Watch the pullers in your guild on raids, ask lots of questions, and try practicing in low risk area's like kael or veksar.  Twisting is childs play, after a day a monkey could do it, the secret to keeping yourself sane is hotkeys.  EG:
<br />

<br />
/stopsong
<br />
/cast 1
<br />

<br />
Make a key like that for each song you wish to twist.  Hotkey your first 4 inventory slots or get a ui that does this and use that for swapping instruments.  Then of course is crowd control.  Again, this is not easy, you'll have to develop an internal clock to know when to recast mezzes, charms, etc.  Though, if you've played an enchanter you have a head start.  This is just the very tip of the iceburg.  For now, just read as many guides as you can and every forum on bards you can find.  Here are the sites I read.

<br />

<br />
People who play bards learn their skills from lvl 1. This class is not one that you can inherit and expect to know how within a few days. You'll make a fool of yourself, your toon's reputation, and above all you'll effect the good reputation if bards if you are terrible at playing yours. </span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
This, in the first response, was really pretty harsh, if you ask me.  Yes, playing a bard is more complex than many EQ characters.  But playing an EQ character, in general, isn't that hard.  This is not an incredibly complex game to master and while there is a lot of player skill to factor in, I think anyone who has significant EQ experience can make a 65 bard that was just handed to them a fairly effective character in a very short time.  The key is recognizing exactly how much you don't know and then filling in the gaps -- which is exactly what the original poster did by posting here.
<br />

<br />
Use the guides, ask bards on your server if they have a few minutes to answer your questions, spend time in XP groups with people you know and trust and before very long, you'll be doing fine.</span></td>

<br />

<br />
He's still gonna suck!
<br />

<br />
It takes practice, knowledge and worked up skill.
<br />

<br />
Only way to get good, is fail, fail, fail, and learn from it.
<br />

<br />
In the lower levels, it doesnt matter if you fail your pull, or if you arent using the proper songs, cause mobs do so little damage.
<br />

<br />
I wanna see an untrained bard go ahead and pull through hard ldons, GoD trials, pulling the elems and so forth without making a &quot;piss-poor-bard&quot; reputation for himself.
<br />

<br />
Without the lower end failures which didnt matter, you have to make those failurs in the higher end, where it really matters, both for your group/raid's progress and for your own reputation.
<br />

<br />
As far as your song lineup's go, there are posts about that somewhere in these forums, you can go check there.
<br />

<br />
For a 65 bard it would be (you can figure out yourself whats the upgrades to these songs)
<br />

<br />
Zek
<br />

<br />
Marr
<br />

<br />
Muse
<br />

<br />
Veeshan
<br />

<br />
Requiem
<br />

<br />
SSoQ
<br />

<br />
Lullaby
<br />

<br />
Selo
<br />

<br />
...
<br />

<br />
As far as raid goes, switch out your Selo with HoS and your Marr with the Chorus version. Optionallly Ele/Pur Chorus for AE resists. Figure out which does what on your own.
<br />

<br />
Thats all the info I'll contribute with. Any tweaks, twists and twirls that makes all us Bard's a respected class to have in your group you can learn on your own. Thats just the basic song lineup that 90% or more of all 65 bards use.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>As you'll read in various guides, being a raiding bard is tough. Your role will be different depending upon who is leading the raid and what the mob is. Often, you'll be helping with resists for people so you'll play your Elemental or Purifying Chorus songs, which are AE resist songs. Almost always, you'll be playing Chorus of Marr, which is AE mana/HP regen. You'll want Harmony of Sound (single target resist debuff) up, for when Tash and Malo are being cast on the mob. Heck, if you're in a group of nukers or melee, you might be asked to play your overhaste (Rizlona's Call of Flames) which also is a DD enhancing focus. It'll take you some time to figure out how you can help the raid beyond what is asked of you.
<br />

<br />
As a puller, you'll be using Silent Song of Quellious a lot. That is your lull. With a high charisma, you're not as likely to get aggro even when it fails. I'd also suggest having Requeim of Time (single target, longer duration slow) for tagging. Psalm of Veeshan (group all-resist song) is also needed if you're pulling casters. 
<br />

<br />
For solo, you'll want Call of the Banshee, Selo's Accelerating Chorus, Tulyen's Chant of (pick 3 that the mob you're against is least likely to resist), Requiem of Time, Lullaby of Morell, Wind of Marr. That'll set you up to Chant mobs to mobs to death, and also charm-kite. Maybe you'd prefer to AE kite, or fear kite. Again, it depends a lot upon what you are soloing.
<br />

<br />
General purpose grouping, I keep Wind of Marr, Call of the Banshee, Lullaby of Morell, Requiem of Time, Warsong of Zek, Psalm of Veeshan, Selo's Accelerating Chorus, and Kazumi's Note of Preservation. Twist WoZ, PoV, and WoM in my typical fight, after slowing with RoT. 
<br />

<br />
For the must-have spells, you'll notice all of my line-ups had either Wind of Marr (group mana/HP) or Chorus of Marr (AE mana/hp) in them. I usually have Requiem of Time loaded as well, and outdoors, almost always have Selo's Accelerating Chorus up. 
<br />

<br />
I'm on a blue server, so I rarely if ever PvP, but Psalm of Veeshan and Selo's Accelerating Chorus have to be helpful there. You get like 180 to all resists with PoV, and nothing can outrun you with Selo's going. 
<br />

<br />
Now, all of that being said. Practice, practice, practice. Being a bard is easy. Being a good bard is very difficult. You have to know what all a bard can do, which you can get by reading the guides. You have to learn what you should do by playing. We can fill so many roles, depending upon what your group needs. Being a good bard means knowing what to do when. And you only learn that at the keyboard. </span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>well the response was normal i think. i take the good and the bad in stride and will do my best not to suck too bad. i have played eq for over 3years. so really not a newb to it. but honestly i dont know alot about a bard except that they are good at alot of stuff.
<br />

<br />
i play a monk very well. and for the most part most melee are all about the same.
<br />

<br />
i was just giving the option to take the account. didnt ask for it didnt want it. but my friend didnt wish to sell and he said that being he knows me so well he knew i would have a great time with the challenge of becoming good at playing a bard. 
<br />

<br />
and no its not my main. and maybe will never be. but the more people in life and game tell me i cant do something the more i will striive to prove them wrong.
<br />

<br />
but i see that i will have to do this the hard way. which for me is  and can be alot of fun. for those who understood what i wrote and gave any info they choose i applaud you for your kindness.. and for those who refer to this as crime against bards server wide. well hmmn. thanks for telling it how you feel and i respect your point of veiw on this. even though i may not agree with it.
<br />

<br />

<br />
ill continue to read this site and do my part to learn the way of a bard. who knows i may play him and decide i hate it. then again i may become a bard lover for all time. thanks to all for there thoughts.

<br />

<br />
Get on and do this with a new bard and play him for a while.  Maybe a month or two.  Put the time into it.  I think that way you will get some knowledge of the rythm of a bard.  It may not be the same as starting new and playing till 30 or 40 but at least you can get on and get the feel without going thru some of the unneeded stuff.
<br />

<br />
I too adopted an account with some high levs when a friend quit the game.  I had my own account with my bard as main but when I got his account also I was soo excited until I realized I had no earthly idea how to play them.  I picked the 59 Cleric and started to play him the most with dear and forgiving friends and slowly got the hang of it.  I am not an expert Cleric but my guildees have no problem with me as the main healer now.  With the practice and effort it can be done.  You can be an effective Bard, maybe not perfect but useful.  Don't listen to the negitivity here.  No one knows what you are capable of but you.  Who knows you could turn out to be one of the best.
<br />

<br />
Just playing from lev 1 does not make you a good bard.  I know 65 Bards that have played their char. from day one that stink royally but it does give you the experience.  As for how good you are and worried about making mistakes remember EQ is just a game. It is supposed to be fun and not a life changing, stress inducing, performance perfection thing, it is supposed to be a game.
<br />

<br />
My main is a 64 bard and I have played him all along but I still make dumb mistakes from time to time (thank god for Selos hehe) and no one goes down as fast as a swarming bard that trips up, I think it is only equaled by the amount of time between the light change and the @$$ behind you that honks his horn.  You will make mistakes and surely more than me but with time they will get fewer and fewer and the more you make the more you will think hey I don't need to do that again. Hence becoming a better bard.</span></td>
