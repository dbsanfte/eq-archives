<br />

<br />
I have enjoyed being a Bard up until this point, but I have a problem.
<br />

<br />
At this point, critters that con as dark blue to me are too dangerous to take on by myself.  Yeah, I can kite, but if I mess up even a little, I'm dead.  I can spend a couple hours kiting things to death, and lose everything I have gained if I miss a note at the wrong time and Selo drops.
<br />

<br />
In a group, I'm not much use.  That is really starting to bother me.  I do *pitiful* DPS.  My party enhancement songs are entirely eclipsed by spells other classes get.  People don't even want the mana song much unless they run out of KEI.
<br />

<br />
There must be something I can do that would make me a useful and valued member of a group, but I'm having no luck figuring out what it is.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Aye, LDoN is a good place for you, you are in the heck levels right now, when nothing's going for you but your skill.  Use it. Learn to pull, it's tricky at first but get a CHA buff and learn to use a combination of lull and a distance pull song of your choice (low aggro, non DoT, such as cancel magic).  Also, learn to use your mez and charm songs to the benefit of the group, filling in for chanters on crowd control. Learn to twist in mez with your standard battle twist, toggling between monsters.  Again it's tricky, but with practice you will become a great bard and folks will completely forget your (all of our) lack of melee DPS.
<br />

<br />
As for songs not being great, when haste fades, and the haster's lom, mention that you've been playing near comparable haste all mission long, as backup and for the other benefits that stack.
<br />

<br />
Lastly, as for manasong, just mention that it stacks with KEI and they'll want you to play it constantly... hehe.
<br />

<br />
GL and yeah, soloing (other than swarm kiting or AoE kiting) at your level is near impossible and horrible exp.  Groups are fun, do your jobs well and you'll make friends fast...

				<td colspan="2"><span>I am amazed you got to 56 before realizing you could not solo blues without kiting them. I was level 35 when I gave up trying to &quot;beat em down&quot;. But that was almost three years ago now.
<br />

<br />
What you add to a group is pulling power, overhaste, and mana song. You CAN do many other things but that is where what we do that is unique (well pulling is not unique but you get my point.)
<br />

<br />
Pull LDONs, you will hone your skills there and make a name for yourself. I did ldons for a long time. One day I was in one of the FEW raids I have ever been on and the monk was having a heck of a time splitting three mobs (before they had lull). He would pull.. FD and they would all walk away together. Finally I asked if I could give it a try, I lulled the three of them and hit the one we wanted with slow song. Poof a single pull in about 9 seconds.
<br />

<br />
Also don't be afraid to pre-mezz. The chanters will love you if you mezz any add so they can have time to get off their much longer mezz. Our mezz does not over write theirs so there is no danger.
<br />

<br />
Get Run3... you should be able to chant and swarm kite without having to use selo's. I made 10 levels in Nadox swarm kiting, that is an indoor zone and all I had was run3. PoD is the same thing.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Unless you group with regulars, its hard for a lot of people to see that actual benefits that bards are bringing to the tables. A warrior can see how much damage he is doing, a cleric can see how much she is healing, and a necro can see how much damage they are doing.
<br />

<br />
What the warrior doesn't see is how much more damage they are doing because you hasted them and boosted their strength, or how much faster the mob is dropping because you reduced its AC and put a damage shield on your tank.
<br />

<br />
What the cleric doesn't see is how much less she is having to heal because you buffed the armor class of the tank and slowed the mob.
<br />

<br />
What the necro doesn't see is how much more often her poison dots are landing because you debuffed the resist of the incoming mob.
<br />

<br />
Bards can do amazing things that the group will rarely, if ever, notice. When I see a room full of mobs and I know one of them is a caster, then I pull with my song that cancels magic. After the mob gets back to the group and has been engaged for a few ticks, you think anyone knows that the mob has had all of its buffs and damage shields removed? Doubtful.
<br />

<br />
What about when I tell the group to move up in the dungeon? You think any of them notice the trap that they just walked over that I disarmed, preventing them from being Dotted or damaged for 100+ points? Doubtful.
<br />

<br />
How about when that mob starts trying to complete heal or gate? Hardly anyone ever notices that you were chain mezzing, preventing the group from having to kill the same mob 3 or 4 times until its mana runs out.
<br />

<br />
Theres only 2 skills that the large majority of players recognize in a bard. One is the fact that they can play a mana song. The other is the fact that we can pull very fast and very well. All of our other benefits go mostly unnoticed by the group, you just have to take comfort in the fact that you KNOW the group is performing a lot better than they would if you were not there, even if they don't see it.

				<td colspan="2"><span>First of you need to change your attitude about yourself .   If you believe that you dont bring much you wont be convincing many groups.    You are a bard and you are a great class that bring alot of stuff to the table.
<br />

<br />
First you have battlecry of the vah'shir wich is a 15% overhaste .  This gives a nice dps boost , rogues and ranger loves this .  Even if they dont know what it is doesnt mean they dont get great benefit from it .   Educate them ,  tell them you are giving them a extra 15% haste that break the haste limit !  
<br />

<br />
Second you just got cantata of replenishement a level ago , this is a great regen song and mana regen that stack with KEI .  No self respecting caster will believe he has already enough mana regen ,  why do you think caster pay so much for FT items , cause they crave mana regen , they cannot live without it .  You bring in a additionnal 15 mana/ tick that freaking huge for a caster .  
<br />

<br />
You can mez stuff ,  you just got a 55 mez that can mez alot of stuff .   pratice holding 3-4 mobs , pratice locking mob down fast .   I have the time to lock down 3 mobs by the tmie a chanter mezzed one cause they dont have to be constantly re-targeting mobs wich make our targetting skill much superior to any standard chanter.  
<br />

<br />
Your melee may not be the greatest but it still theyre , do you see a chanter doing any sustained dps ? Nope you dont , in many case (with KEI buyable in pok) you are clearly superior to a chanter , you bring more to the table then them .  
<br />

<br />
Take pride in your class and dont get down because a newb who dont understand the greatness of a bard tell you otherwise .

				<td colspan="2"><span>Wow,
<br />

<br />
I just don't get this... What level was this bard 2 months ago when you started playing him?  If you levelled a bard to 56 in 2 months you either should have been kickin butt or been PLed to an incredible degree.  If you were kickin butt, you shouldn't have these questions, I would think.  That leaves me to one of 3 hypotheses:
<br />
1. You picked up this bard from someone else...so you are missing some skills...
<br />
2. You were incredibly PLed and/or twinked... so you are missing some skills...
<br />
3. You kicked butt as a bard for 2 months and had a recent brain injury...
<br />

<br />
To your points:
<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">At this point, critters that con as dark blue to me are too dangerous to take on by myself. Yeah, I can kite, but if I mess up even a little, I'm dead. I can spend a couple hours kiting things to death, and lose everything I have gained if I miss a note at the wrong time and Selo drops</span></blockquote>
<br />
Uh... yes and no... toe to toe, solo... yeah anything dark blue is gonna rip your arm off and beat you with the bloody stump.  This is true for almost every class.  But at 56, bard soloing can be AWESOME... which begs the question... If you can lose 2 hours of work in one death... how are you kiting, and where?  And do you know about rezzes?  At 56 I was swarming the stalkers in PON whenever I could.  I was PLing friends doing it sometimes and the XPs and loot were awesome.  Or if I wanted to solo and stalkers were camped, I would do flies in POD where the XPs were nice and the loot sucked eggs.
<br />

<br />
Your comments make me think you are aiming at AoE kiting though.  I could be wrong, but its that &quot;one little mistake&quot; thing that makes me think that.  AoE kiting is tough, no doubt, it can be rewarding XP wise but it can be frustrating too.
<br />

<br />
But even 1-on-1 charm kiting or chant kiting is passable XPs at this level (though not if you are accustomed to the pace of the others)
<br />

<br />
OK enough on solo.. on to grouping issues:
<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">In a group, I'm not much use. That is really starting to bother me. 
<br />
</span></blockquote>
<br />
HUH?!?!?!?
<br />
What class are we talking about again?  Not a bard right?  What kinda uber group is this?
<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">I do *pitiful* DPS. </span></blockquote>
<br />
Melee DPS, just yours, I guess you could say that.. its not unimportant DPS, depending on group makeup,  but its not your main function either.  But lets suppose the group has ALL the bases covered without you... All they need from you is DPS, they think...Mem those chants and see if the tank can keep the aggro... make it easier for him by throwing in the over-the-cap haste and mana song too, but shhh don't tell.  Your DPS equals your personal DPS plus the added DPS the group does because you are here, and that shouldn't be pathetic, you just arent giving yourself credit.
<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">My party enhancement songs are entirely eclipsed by spells other classes get.</span></blockquote>
<br />
This is true and untrue.  Chorus of Celerity is eclipsed by shaman and enchanter hastes, but thats OK.  SOW ain't got nothin on us.  Nothing in the game competes with our over-the-cap haste.  And our role is primarily to find and fill whatever gaps are present in the current group... no haster.. bards on it... no slower.. bards on it... need snare.. bards got it... need crowd control.. bards your man...need resists... nothin like a bard for resists... need a puller... step aside, bard comin thru... inc %T.  
<br />

<br />
In group situations, I am most often the puller.  If we have another slower, thats OK, I am STILL gonna slow on inc, group's better off that way... If we have other Crowd Control, and I get a multi pull, ones getting mezzed on the way in.  I group well with enchanters but don't need them.. I change my tactics a little to try to keep them awake, I have often had them complain of boredom when I was pulling.  I noticed no mention of pulling or crowd control in your post.  You should work on those.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote"> People don't even want the mana song much unless they run out of KEI. </span></blockquote>
<br />
Who ARE these people?  Group with smarter people.  All of our mana songs STACK with all of the clarity line and all other mana regen.  Whether they want it or not... give it to them, you are adding to the productivity of the  group unless every single member is FOM and not casting anything.
<br />

<br />
Ok what haven't we covered?  Occlussion of Sound is one.. You just got that at 55... I pull with a resist debuff followed by a slow and frequently will refresh the resist debuff in my twist until the  main slower lands theirs. Make it easier for them.. thats a big part of our functionality.. make stuff easier.  
<br />

<br />
Lulls in 3 seconds for no mana make us an excellent puller choice.  Learn to lull pull well
<br />

<br />
So theres haste, overhaste, slows, snares, mana, resist debuffs, resist buffs, crowd control, pulling, speed, and situational tools.  Yes some of these are overshadowed by other classes isometimes if they happen to be present, but others are unmatchable.
<br />

<br />
Look at the group make-up.. look for weaknesses in it... you almost certainly have a song, or a set of songs, that will fill that gap</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Everyone pretty much nailed it here. Right now you're in a lull, pun intended, and all of us go through it around lvl 55-56, things slow down and the class dynamics shift. Like the others said, you can't expect your role to be as noticeable quite yet, unless you're pulling. Being a good puller in LDoNs is really empowering and something I encourage all bards to strive for, it can really change the way you look at our class, but don't expect the xp to pour in. Check out the forum on lvls 51-60, there are Countless threads from people about the crawl from 55-60 and how much it sucks, you're experienceing a part of this. I've given a lot of advice in many threads about how to handle this, but my biggest reccommendation is, get your epic. Work on it while you /lfg and put a message in your /lfg window along the lines of &quot;Will pull for food&quot; or something catchy and try to take on as many LDoNs as you can. I really advise doing EF, the pulling is fun and you can learn a lot about how to target semi-hidden mobs and how to inch up to low visibility pulls. It also doesn't hurt that the armor in EF is awesome, second only to Tak, which is much more difficult imho, also look at the fact that Call of the Muse comes from EF and it's really a no brainer. If you want good xp in LDoN you pretty much need to be the lowest lvl in the group, which can also teach you a thing or two because you won't be able to mezz/charm a good deal of the mobs if you're lower than the others. Keep that Deftdance hotkey ready! I stopped soloing at 56 almost all together and started doing LDoNs almost full time, it's a huge ego boost when you get it right and it's a huge reality check when you screw it up. Lots of folks will tell you not to do pickup groups, but it's almost unavoidable so just try to have patience with people and take charge, you'll discover that you can do a lot more than you give yourself credit for, especially when you're the glue holding a rag tag group together. Keep at it man, this is the point where a lot of folks lose hope and make alts, don't do it! Get those blue notes going and try as hard as you can to meet as many people as possible, if it wasn't for the people I would have quit this game years ago.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Any bard mez used to interfere with chanter mez. This was changed a while back.  Pre-mezzing is  both safe, and an excellent tactic. 
<br />

<br />
Not entirely sure what happens if you mez a mob a chanter ALREADY has mezed, it may still overwrite (and then both mezes drop 18 seconds later), but I don't think so.
<br />

<br />
Pulling in LDON's is a great idea, but if you're grouping with folks higher than you, you may start running into situations where your lull won't take effect, you can't mez the mobs, you can't charm stuff, etc. My bard is 58 now and having some of the same issues... however, there's still a TON you can do, and the 60's will bring back a lot of that capability.
<br />

<br />
Even when we have chanter buffs, groups love it if I twist Cantata (mana), Overhaste, and Rizlona's Embers (LDON song that acts as a focus for nukes under level 60).  You can play with damage shields, resists, stat and atk buffs, you can be the groups' snarer, you can disarm traps in LDON, you can track.  
<br />

<br />
Good advice to get Run3, it will help prevent the &quot;selos dropped&quot; deaths. Also if you're using 49 selos (2.5 minute duration), refresh it a bit early and you will never have the problem. </span></td>

Nope.  I know for a fact that even after a chanter has mezzed something, if yours land then drops the chanter's mez will still remain.  I know because every once in a while a chanter beats me to the mez.  I should be ashamed, I know, but oh well.</span></td>

 Second of all, you came to the right place.  Most people know little about bards like the enchanter you grouped with.  You really need to know the class well to pull your wieght.
<br />

<br />
 You are really at a low spot for bard power at 56, soloing you are a god but your group buffs arent all that great.  A lot of cool stuff opens up later (fade, WoZ, PoV, Overhaste/focus, HoS) that increases bard power 10 fold.

 Read the boards here and find out what you have to look foward to.

Just wanted to add, enchanter mez and bard mez STACK.  Not only does bard mez not overwrite enchanter mez, but they stack.

Actually, I made a necro alt and play him when Im burnt out from my bard so Im not forced to play the bard all the time Im on EQ. If that were the case Id get sick of the bard, and wouldnt want to play him at all.
<br />

<br />
So make an alt, but dont over play him that you give up the bard, stick with it. Work on epic when bored, play alt when bored. Mix it up ya know?</span></td>

Hehe Sinfonian went from 1 to 51 in 30 days, long ago in a gallaxy far far away...  (ziltch PLing btw) But I agree, not knowing how to group at 56 is amazing, especially if not a swarm kiter (like I was through my 40s and early 50s).

Sure hope he got the answers he wanted, I sure learned from them myself!

				<td colspan="2"><span>Actually chanter mezz ovewrites our mezz, but we can then stick our mezz on top without ovewriting theirs..  It's kinda wierd, but means I can tell when the chanty has taken over mezzing my mobs.
<br />

<br />
I pre-mezz as a matter of course in many many encounters, wherever multiple pulls happen.  Makes life for the chanter much safer, if their mezz gets resisted, my mez is still holding it.   Once their mezz lands I get the 'Your Lullaby of Morrell has worn off' message and I know I can relax.  I never get complaints.  
<br />

<br />
One thing I WOULD recommend though.  Some chanters might feel that you are stepping on their toes and that you don't respect their abilities.  With a new person I will often send them a tell, saying that I am just pre-mezzing as a matter of course and that I assume they will take over.   I have never got a bad reaction and quite often a good one.  Just let em know.

				<td colspan="2"><span>yes, at 56th life gets rough for a bard.  our songs are not up to snuff for most mobs, but that does not make us worthless in a group.
<br />

<br />
there is so much a bard can do, and as for ppl not wanting mana song even if they have KEI they are nuts.  IIRC kei and our mana songs STACK thus they can burn though more mana and still have some left over for their job in the group.
<br />

<br />
my only real comment is to AVOID LDoN until you hit 60th.  get with your guild, at group, get in some raids and let your defense songs wow ppl, always nice to see all/most of your resists jump by 60-120points because the BARD is near...
<br />

<br />
the reason i say AVOID LDoN for now, is nothing there that will benifit you that a good xp grind group, or raid will not do BETTER.
<br />

<br />
from 54-59 LDoN suck.  plane and simple.  nothing good about them other then a few points for a win.  the xp is pathetic, the loot is not worth it for the most part.  both of those happend right before gOd was released and SoE nerfed LDoN into oblivion for the 50s.
<br />

<br />
pre-nerf i would agree that LDoN was the best thing that ever happened to EQ, but now i say avoid if unless you are not guilded or do not have a group that your can get with on a consistant basis.
<br />

<br />
if that is the case, then put up your LFG and put in your flag that you are looking for LDoN, then go swar/chant kite and solo to get your xp and levels.
<br />

<br />
getting out of the 50s is the hardest thing until you hit 64th.  those are all h3ll levels for the most part with 59th being a double h3ll level.
<br />

<br />
best of luck, and GRATE work on getting to 56th in only 2 months as a BARD, that is tough for being new to the game.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>For what it's worth, yes, I did bring this character up from first level.  I've gotten plenty of help along the way.  A level here or there powerleveled out, some pretty good twinking from a friend of mine who has a 65 Ranger on one account and a Bazaar Trader on another.
<br />

<br />
I've read most of the guides here, a fair chunk of the forum posts, and I ask a lot of questions in game.  I want to be good at what I do.
<br />

<br />
I have the advantage of a lot of free time.  I have many many hours invested.
<br />

<br />
Up until this point, I have enjoyed myself.  I like playing a Bard.  I like having Selo, my own Invis, Track, Sense and Disarm Traps, all the tools a Bard gets.  I'm a handy critter to have on LDoNs where I almost always pull and do it well.
<br />

<br />
I must be a traitor to my class in that I don't *like* to solo.  It's dull.  It's a lot of work.  It's got great potential to get me killed at a time when I have no back up.  I *dispise* haunting the PoK begging for a rez.
<br />

<br />
I'm in a guild.  It's a Fun and Friendship type guild, and I've passed the vast majority of them in level.  A few of them have Mains in my range, but they are usually playing their Alts.  I have no steady pool of people to join me in a group.
<br />

<br />
I've hit a point where my abilities don't seem to measure up to the mobs I'm facing.  I'm not getting xp to speak of.  Sure enough, the Doldrum Levels that everyone hates.  What I want is to be in groups so I can get some decent xp and have fun doing it.
<br />

<br />
Everyone knows they want a Cleric in their group.  They will take a Druid if they can't get one.  Everyone is always happy to have some good Tankage, a Warrior or two, a Paladin, even a Shadowknight.  Someone with some nukes is always appreciated.  What does a Bard bring to the group?  At this level, not a whole lot, and nothing anyone seems impressed with.
<br />

<br />
I feel like I'm doing something wrong.  Like I'm missing the songs that will make people go &quot;Glad we had a Bard in our group.&quot;  I'd almost be happy to just stand around and sing mana if it got me group invites and people who were happy to have a Bard added to their group.
<br />

				<td colspan="2"><span>you have a lot to bring to the group even at your level when your songs are IMHO about as out of ballance as they get until 65th or so with other classes.
<br />

<br />

<br />
you still have great mana regen, good healing for downtime and if you have a sham/nec in your group they will absolutly LOVE you for your heal/mana song that stacks with their canni/lich thus they can feed their mana more effectively and be better in the group.
<br />

<br />
you have stackable haste, you have some very nice DoTs that have great DEBUFFs so the nukers can land for more and more often with less resists.
<br />

<br />
you have a nice little (forget if its dex or agi, but i think its dex) proc that is buff/debuff.  buff for group, debuff for target.
<br />

<br />
loads of great songs that you can use.  your pulling skills atm are a bit weak due to not being able to CONTROLL overpulls like you could just 1 or 2 levels ago with charm/mez, but that is ok.  you will DIE and DIE more often now then you did in the past if you are pulling, but IIRC you also have a nice song or two to help reduce the agro you have.  keep that in your line up if you are pulling.  its great to help your tanks pull the mob(s) off your back when a pull goes bad and they will.
<br />

<br />
bards like necros are some of the most under appriciated group members in the game.  i have lost count how many times, when i used to play, that ppl would send me a tell after i left the group for what ever reason that things got REAL hard after i left with either my nec or bard.  that was partialy due to really KNOWING my class, and partialy due to the fact that those 2 classes are great support roll types in groups.
<br />

<br />
my only beef with LDoN is the xp and loot nerf for the mid to upper 50s.  for learning how to make a group go OMG how did we do so good, or OMG how did we live though that pull?  that is what a bard will do for a group both xp grind, and LDoNs.
<br />

<br />
a strong necro can do that too, but not as effectivly as a bard under ALL cicumstances.  a nec really shines vs undead, or were there is no other form of CC to be had (as long as mobs are sub 56 that is), and they make good supprice backup healers.
<br />

<br />
wish ya best of luck, sounds like you are on the right path.  keep up the questions, and keep up the hard work at becoming one of those bards that ppl will LOVE to see you log in because they KNOW once you are in their group, the xp and loot will fly faster then if you were not with them.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>In response to an earlier post on alts:
<br />

<br />
PLAY THEM!!! By all means, play them. My bard started out as an alt to my 55 (at the time) ranger. My ranger is now 57 and naked except for nodrop gear. I loved my bard so much I couldnt stop playing him until he hit 65. Now and again as I leveled my bard I would take time out to play an alt. (BTW, bard went 34-65 in 2 months, only playing after work/weekends) Doing this does two things: it prevents you from getting burnt out, and it gives you an insight into other classes. I find I am much more understanding of clerics after having played my wifes cleric off and on level 1-65. Playing other classes will let you know: 1-you are more uber then you first suspected, 2-you are much better at filling an empty spot then ANY other class PERIOD, 3-if you play an alt and group with a competently played bard, you will notice how very much that bard does for you and your efficiency as a group. I think you are getting too caught up in your weaknesses and not focusing on your skills. You see a ranger and ask: &quot;Why can't I do that dps?&quot; or at a chanter and say: &quot;Wish I could charm that mob for that long.&quot; What you don't know is the chanter looks at you and thinks: &quot;Wish I could run that fast and survive being hit more than 3 times&quot;, and the Ranger is thinking: &quot;I wish I could mez that mob and regen mana for the group and slow the mob and haste the group.... or be WANTED IN A GROUP.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
I can say, having played a mid-50's ranger, that it is nigh-impossible to find a group with a ranger unless it is with a group of friends, or you form the group yourself.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Not much really to add except for a few minor things to repeat and ramble on about:
<br />

<br />
1)  Katta's is great at this level for any melee.  Most do not have max stats at this level, so even with a dex buff, the additional dex from this song will max it out.  Any melee with a proc on his/her weap will luv the max dex.
<br />

<br />
2)  Largo's is great for pulling (which I am sure you already use in your normal song lineup).  Snare for the tank to have time to get agro, AC debuff, and preslow on the mob so the main group slower has time to get the mob debuffed (stacks w/ Occ) and slowed.
<br />

<br />
3)  Educate your group.  Most have no idea still to this day what a bard can or can not do except at lvl 5 when we get selos and lvl 65+.  Tell your melee to watch their proc before and after you sing Katta's for example.  Chances are if you group with them again, they will request it.  Tell your group's main crowd controller and/or slower what you are doing on pulls (see #2 above).  Tell all of your casters to compare their mana bar with and without your added song.  They will request it from then on (arrrgh...hehe!) because they are regen hungry.  State plainly that adding you as a bard to the group equals less downtime, which equals more xp in the same amount of time than without you.  Believe me, the groups will eventually get their head out of their arses and start preferring you over another class.
<br />

<br />
4)  At this level, just master pulling.  It takes awhile, but a group will completely notice the xp flow difference with you in group as opposed to you not being there.  Timing the pulls to have one mob inc just as the previous one is dying will equal nonstop xp, regardless how much you get per kill.  Nothing educates a group more than when they notice the difference in speed that their xp bar fills.
<br />

<br />
5)  Try getting groups in CoDecay.  IMHO it's the best xp at this level.  If you keep the pulls flowing, it surpasses soloing (sry, not sure about aoe soloing, i only swarmed).
<br />

<br />
6)  After lvl 63 and you get Fading Memories AA (you do have rs3 plus 6aa banked, right?), life is grand!
<br />

<br />
7)  Above all else understand this phrase:  &quot;Bards do not make a group.  Bards make a group BETTER!&quot;.  Because this really can't be parsed or distinctly noticed, most don't realize this.  Hence your dilema.
<br />

<br />
Stick to the grind for now.  Play an alt so you can realize you miss your bard.  It only gets better!</span></td>

<br />
All the things are adding up, and every single one is clearly noticable in my opinion, as it can mean wipe/extended medbreak or no wipe.
<br />
The main aspect of a bard in a group (apart from the increase in power that shows in numbers, such as haste, overhaste, attack buffs, DS, stats buffs, resistances etc.) is smoothening the whole process of fighting so far that some people tend to fall asleep. This is where your most important bardic ability, the one to entertain your group with your wit and charm should keep them going. ;)
<br />
As a bard you can even keep a weak group going and going well. You can (almost) guarantee single pulls and when the last mob is on 5% health, the new mob is already in camp, mezzed debuffed, preslowed, ready to be picked by the MT for example.
<br />
Being honest, the group would be better off dps wise with getting another ranger or wizard instead of a bard (if you arent group haster). Your songs (CotM, Zek) can compensate a bit for weakening the groups dps, giving a 15% damage boost. But still a Wizard would have added more dps. 
<br />
You see the bard's job is not to give the group a huge dps boost, the job is to make everyone's stay in the group more convenient.
<br />
A group without a bard might have wiped because of a bad pull, a slow not landing, a roamer adding, a mob gating. It might habe been unefficient because wasting too much mana on spell resists, on too long fights because of a CHing mob, the casters not having enough mana regen and the list goes on. And one bard takes care of all that. 
<br />
Of course other classes could take care of some of tasks as well, but to take care of all of them you would have to assemble your group very carefully, and there would still be things the group would be missing without a bard. 
<br />
(I've got to admit that things get a lot nicer once you have reached 65 and got certain equipment AAs and songs. Fading Memories, the 60+ songs (especially 65 mezz as well as HoS) and Epic make a Bard's life a great deal easier. But even earlier on you can add a lot to every group you join.)
