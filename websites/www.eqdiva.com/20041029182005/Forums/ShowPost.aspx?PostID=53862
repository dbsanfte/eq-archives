				<td colspan="2"><span>Trial 1 is to many the hardest of the four initial trials. The mobs hit hard, up to the 1k, they mostly all summon and some are unslowable. But no worries, with our  Bardic skills and songs at hand, we at ensure only getting singles, just like a Hard LDoN adventure.
<br />

<br />
<b>Where do I go, and how do I get there???</b>
<br />

<br />
Trial starts in Barindu, The Hanging Gardens. You can get here by using Magus' from any camp to Nedaria`s Landing, and then from the Nedaria Magus over to Natimbi, the broken shores. If you wanna be better safe than sorry, get a bind at the Natimbi camp, since you can't bind in neither Barindu nor Qinimi. Natimbi is the closest bind spot to the Sewer entrance.
<br />

<br />
The run from Natimbi to Barindu is pretty easy for us Bards. Get some maps downloaded from http://www.mapfiend.net/ and you should have no problems finding the zones. You need to follow this route to get to Barindu.
<br />

<br />
Natimbi, The Broken Shores ---&gt; Qinimi, Court of Nihilia ---&gt; Barindu, The Hanging Gardens
<br />

<br />
Through all 3 zones you will need Invisibility. Travel song works dandy until you hit Qinimi, where you got to switch to Selo&amp;Invis song cause it's a No Levi zone (hence no travel song). To get through Qinimi while naked on a CR you need either a) Buy a flute, b) Get invis potion/group member to invis you or c) Just hit your Fading Memories. For those with LDoN points to spare, you can pick up a Bloodied Flute for 10 LDoN points in the BBM camp.
<br />

<br />
Once you get to Barindu, the Sewer entrance (and the safe room, dont train mobs to here) is located inside the green temple/pyramid. Entrance is on the west side of it. Go inside, pass the little shrine with a tree on it on the southside and head for the South-East corner of the room. This is where the saferoom and stairs leading into the sewer is located (Also the GraveYard for people who are deadified in trials)
<br />

<br />
<b>How do I get a Trial, how does it work???</b>
<br />

<br />
Get your group together, then flip on Invis or Travel Song, and run outside of the pyramid again. Go left and run around the outside of the pyramid on the South side of it. You want to find a person named Gamesh. He hands out the first 4 of the 6 Trials.
<br />

<br />
The location is just outside the pyramid on southeast corner. Loc neg 373 neg 712.
<br />

<br />
Hail Gamesh, and he will give you 4 bracketed options. The plant, crematory, pools and lair. We want the plant since that is the first of the Trials. (Note: He does not list them in the correct order. Trial 1 - 4 would be Plant, Crematory, Lair and Pool, Gamesh however has the Lair and Pool switched around)
<br />

<br />
After you get the Expedition, you have a new window in front of you (Open/close this window with Alt+Z) Everyone in the group will be added to the expedition automatically and can zone in from the Safe room. If you have any latecomers and don't want to wait for them, simply use the following...
<br />

<br />
/dzadd &lt;name&gt;
<br />

<br />
This will send an invitation to the player asking if he wishes to join your expedition. Once he hits yes, he is able to zone into the expedition even if not grouped. (A nice little tweak that I wish LDoN had as well)
<br />

<br />
<b>Where do we go, what are we supposed to do???</b>
<br />

<br />
With your fresh maps from Mapfiend you should have at least 2 rooms that are labelled. To the East on the map, a short dead end should be labelled &quot;Ansharu&quot;. All the way South on the map, another circular room should be labelled &quot;Stonemite Room&quot;
<br />

<br />
Rundown on what to do to win/finish:
<br />

<br />
Preflag: You must fight your way to the room named &quot;Ansharu&quot; Rangers in the group should be able to track Ansharu as a blue &quot;con&quot; in their track. Once you arrive at Ansharu, go over to him and Hail him. He is the &quot;preflag&quot; to get the expedition underway. Only need to hail him once, then move on South towards &quot;Stonemite room&quot;
<br />

<br />
Main Objective: In the Stonemite room, there will be 9x An Aged Stonemite. These are all packed nicely together on 9 &quot;tiles&quot; that makes a sort of 3x3 square. They are singlepullable so no need to worry about adds (There is a slight bug, will get to that later) Instantly, and mark INSTANTLY, after the 9th Aged Stonemite is dead, the boss will pop in the room. The boss is Ancient Kayserops. Slay Ancient Kayserops and you get the Character Flag. Once he is dead, you can either a) Fight out, b) Port/Evac out, or magic option c) Hit Alt+Z and remove everyone from the Expedition. Takes about 1 minute after you leave Expedition before you are kicked out of the zone and back to the Saferoom in Barindu.
<br />

<br />
<b>How do we fight, what to expect???</b>
<br />

<br />
The first rule of thumb here is, go along the ledges, stay against the walls. Most rooms have mobs that are easy to bypass since there are ledges that are a level higher than the center of the room. This requires however that you stay close to walls and dont aggro the static and roaming mobs below the ledge.
<br />

<br />
There are two types of mobs that See Invis. These are the square blobs (A congealed mass) and the &quot;ghosts&quot; or &quot;phantoms&quot; that people commonly call them. Any mob in here that has the Gamesh type model is a see invis mob. Most people like to bypass as many mobs as they can to get the Trial done quicker, and with a stroke of luck, you can invis almost all of the way, stopping only to kill off a &quot;see invis&quot; mob here and there along the way.
<br />

<br />
<b>Pulling</b>
<br />

<br />
Things to look out for. 
<br />

<br />
Golems - They are unslowawble, fast heals pls &quot;)
<br />

<br />
&quot;Ghost&quot; casters - They might gate, spam mez, especially if they are roamers. Dont want a roamer to gate 3 rooms away and come running back with an army of his own.
<br />

<br />
Ukun dogs - They have their Ukun Chain spell... its a snare. Snared puller = frustrated bard = possible death.
<br />

<br />
Stonemites - They are hard to spot while pulling and moving up. See below for a tip on how to spot them.
<br />

<br />
Always check right around the corners for adds. There are several roamers in here and often some static spawns near corners. The biggest PITA however, is the stonemites. Stonemites are small, flat, grey and blend in remarkably well with the floor graphics, especially if they are an inch underwater (which they almost always are) If you dont pay attention, you most certainly won't see the #@#% stonemite when you do a pull. How to check easily if there are any Stonemites around?
<br />

<br />
Alt+O (options) ---&gt; Keyboard ---&gt; Targeting
<br />

<br />
Find the line with Cycle NPC, and bind it to a key.
<br />

<br />
Now hit this key repeatedly if you suspect there to be any stonemites around and it should cycle through all the nearby mobs within Line of Sight (might have to move a bit sideways to make sure you cover the entire Line of Sight (One might be behind some rubble))
<br />

<br />
Big thanks to my baby Lethy who was the one who told me about Cycle NPC! Love ya baby ^.^
<br />

<br />
Pull the mobs on the Ledges, and move on the ledges when moving through rooms. No need to kill off the entire room unless you are really exp. hungry. Its a fairly long way to get to the Stonemite room so you don't want to not spend your entire day killing trash mobs. Killing and moving up is easy as pancake, especially if you are accustomed to LDoN's.
<br />

<br />
Once you moved from Ansharu and head South, you'll soon find yourself in a sloped, ramp looking hallway which leads down to a room with a circular pool in it. On the map you should see this circle drawn inside of that room.
<br />

<br />
Clear the mobs near the circle (Dont need to clear the two in the SE and SW corner of the room, only the ones immediately near the pool) Put on EB if you dont like water, then jump into the pool, swim DOWN, then swim WEST. After a short swim (what seems like eternity for poor swimmers) you will exit the water after swimming up a ramp looking hallway (just like the one you followed to get down to the pool room). Stay at the waters edge once you exit the water, there is a static spawn on the top of the ramp.
<br />

<br />
From here, you can most likely invis the entire way into the Stonemite room. There are however, ALOT of mobs between your current spot and the stonemite room, so IF you invis, stay tight, move slow and move as one. There &quot;might&quot; be a see invis mob or two up in the last room to the South before you get to the Stonemite room. Thats the only room between the &quot;after swim&quot; spot and the Stonemite room that I have seen &quot;see invis&quot; mobs roam or spawn in.
<br />

<br />
Optionally you can kill your way there, but be very cautious when you pull from the water just after the &quot;after swim&quot; spot. There are 4 mobs in the water, and 1 will aggro instantly when you dip into the water. Go into the water and dont move far, and with luck, the Proximity aggro should only aggro the 1st one. If you swim slightly too far towards it, you will aggro an add on the left, behind the supports to the pipelines in the room.
<br />

<br />
<b>Last hallway before Stonemite room</b>
<br />

<br />
Just as you get to the turn in the hallway that makes it turn west and into the stonemite room, you will notice that there are alot of stonemites along the walls on each side. Killing your way there worked fine up until now. You can try killing the stonemites to move up into the room, but unless your DPS is very heavy, forget it. They respawn very fast, too fast to safely clear it and move up. At this point, invis everyone and move into the South East corner of the room, this is a safe spot away from the 9 Aged Stonemites and you wont need invis here.
<br />

<br />
<b>Stonemite Room</b>
<br />

<br />
For those afraid of water, you can swim over to the support of the pipeline on the South Side and walk up the east side of the support and onto the pipeline. At least you'll be on dry land here.
<br />

<br />
Pulling this room leaves you with several options.
<br />

<br />
a) Pulling them to the SE corner and fight in the water
<br />

<br />
b) Staying up on the Pipeline and fight them while they are in the water (You can cast on them even tho they are underwater and you aren't. You can also melee them from the pipeline and down into the water, go go long arms and weird Z-axis) Note however, that you CANT heal or recieve heals if you and your healer are on opposite sides of the water-barrier. No clue why the stonemites are excluded from the water-barrier rule.
<br />

<br />
c) Jump up onto the ledge to the South of the Southern Pipeline. You might need some run-up speed to make the jump onto the ledge, or a grow if your a short little bugger. Optionally, get an Invis, go back to the entrance to the hallway and the wall will be slightly sloped here so you gain some altitude then can run onto the ledge from there.
<br />

<br />
Or, what I suggest...
<br />

<br />
d) Do as last described in option C, but get onto the North side Ledge instead of the South side one... this places you North of the 9 Aged Stonemites (This is my fave spot. Again, thanks to my baby Lethy for finding this super spot. &lt;3 Lethy ^.^)
<br />

<br />
<b>Pulling the Aged Stonemites</b>
<br />

<br />
The BUG...
<br />
------------------
<br />
Sometimes the Aged Stonemites will not be on a tile of their own. If you get to the room and see that there are only 8, not 9 stonemites, then there is a dangerous element in place that you need to be aware of.
<br />

<br />
On one of the tiles, there are 2 stonemites on top of eachother. These 2 are NOT single pullable, and they will both come if you pull 1 of them. They are also NOT mezzable...
<br />

<br />
To find out which, use the Cycle NPC as described earlier and see which of the 9 tiles the 3d Target ring does not move away from even tho you hit Cycle NPC.
<br />

<br />
Once you figure out which tile it is, you still have to split them somehow...
<br />

<br />
They do NOT see invis (at least not when I was splitting the double) Pull them all 1 by 1, EXCEPT the double. Once at the double.. pull both... then Fade... hopefully one will walk back before the other... paci the walker, pull the one still standing and you should get them 1 by 1.
<br />
---------------------
<br />
If pulling to the SE corner or to the Pipeline, make sure you pull the south row first so you dont pull them over eachother. They WILL ADD if you pull one over the other.
<br />

<br />
If pulling up onto the ledges, always pull the ones closest to you, however... once you land your pull-song (I prefer HoS or Requiem) the mob will poof... Yep, it vanishes from its spot. It has a weird pathing in here, but it will either warp onto you, warp onto ledge and run to you, or warp up onto the pipelines in the roof and come running along an awkward pattern to get to you. Nomatter which, it will get to you and it shouldn't bring adds unless you pulled one over another.
<br />

<br />
Quick rundown of strategy,
<br />

<br />
The Aged ones will AE Rampage for up to 1k and they sometimes triple. Keep the casters AWAY from the mob. We had some bad incidents where the AE rampage hit the caster and healers and took out both our Druid and Cleric in the same instance. These Stonemites are smart... they know who to kill =)~ Having a necro with an EE with you is a good idea for any Trial, since you wont have to restart from Square 1 if you wipe.
<br />

<br />
Also they hit hard, so try avoid getting hit while pulling them. I usually just train them onto the tank. They are slowable, so if you can, preslow with Requiem. Saves the tank some pain and the healers some mana.
<br />

<br />
The respawn on the Aged ones is VERY slow, so you can safely kill one, then med up before pulling the next one. Just make sure your healers are FM before you pull the last one (which will spawn Ancient Kayserops)
<br />

<br />
In all of the three spots... SE corner, South Pipeline and South Ledge, Kayserops will aggro you right after you kill the last stonemite, because his patrol pattern covers these areas and you will get Proximity aggro. This is why I like the North Ledge better. Stay slightly NW on the ledge and he won't aggro you. He'll just run back and forth in his patrol pattern over and over... giving you time for a breather and a med break.
<br />

<br />
<b>Killing Ancient Kayserops</b>
<br />

<br />
The boss hits for 1416... at least it did on me as a Bard with around 1400'ish AC.
<br />

<br />
He flurries, did a double flurry on our warrior last time I killed him.
<br />

<br />
He has some sort of electric strike proc that hits for 200-300'ish.
<br />

<br />
He is UNSLOWABLE, dont even try.
<br />

<br />
He is UNSNAREABLE, no point trying this either.
<br />

<br />
Here is a little trick though... He does NOT summon !!!
<br />

<br />
If you watch his patrol pattern, you will notice that he pops his head into the hallway at one point. There is a roamer in the hallway that stops at the entrance to peek around for a minute before it walks off again. Make sure this roamer isnt there when you tag the Kayserops, else you risk 3-4 adds along with the named... w-i-p-e~
<br />

<br />
Your choices are now 2...
<br />

<br />
a) Tag and tank. Old fashioned way of healing the tank and beating the crap out of the mob. This works, but takes alot of healing, and if unlucky with the mobs flurries and being unslowable as it is, the tank might very well get pwned faster than you can say bacon.
<br />

<br />
b) Load your dots and kite the #$@%
<br />

<br />
This is what we did after numerous attempts where the Age old or AK ate our healers forcing us to restart the expedition or just simply ate the tank first then proceeded to eat the rest of us. Even with FM there isnt much you can do all by yourself this deep in a dungeon. We cant rez, and if lucky, you might get back to ZI with 1 corpse and still be alive. But pulling 1 corpse is pointless... starting expedition over saves alot of grief and pain.
<br />

<br />
If you have a necro, get DMF, otherwise get any Levitate you can from your group. Then put your drum on and your dots at the ready. (also mem levi song JIC). Kite him in wide circles while dotting him at the west side of the room. You dont want the roamer in the hallway to aggro. If you notice, there is some water falling down from a pipe high up, near the hallway entrance... I used this falling water as a &quot;landmark&quot; as to how far east towards the hallway I would allow myself to go. I stayed west of this water the entire kite and I never aggroed the hallway mob.
<br />

<br />
Rest of the group started using arrows, pets and nukes once I got the AK to 80%. Important that they watch their aggro, else they will get killed by the AK and might throw him off the kite-path which risks you getting an unsuspected hit and possible stun &gt;.&lt;
<br />

<br />
After you killed the AK, you should get the Character Flag and a message telling you that you should earn the respect of the High Priest or some yada like that &quot;)
<br />

<br />
End expedition to get kicked out or port/evac out.
<br />

<br />
You should now have the flag and be ready for Trial #2.
<br />

<br />
Hope this info helps anyone doing Trial 1 and save them alot of the trouble we encountered with the Stonemite room and the boss.

Well we did this last night.. just had the pally tank, and druid heal.    Pally died at 1% of AK,  but we had enough dps to finish it off (thank god for Deftdance)..    Unfortunatly..  we didn't have any rezors in our group.  (except for the pally who was now dead)
<br />

<br />
The interesting part of this is that at end, I decided to go revisit Anushara, and hail, (basically said go see the high priest)  the rogue also did the same.  we then exit the expedition.  so all of us went to hail the priest.  2 of us got the congradulations of taking down KT.  the others did not.  and when myself and the rogue hailed again. we got offer the second trial...  the other 4 did not and were offer the sewer trials 1 again.
<br />

<br />
I'm not sure.. but I think before leaving you need to go back to Anushrua and hail again...  at least thats what some of my guildies are saying now.
<br />

<br />
btw.. I didn't know about &quot;Gamesh&quot;   always got the expedition from the high priest.
<br />

<br />
Edit: btw... well written up..  its basically what we did was pull to the north ledge (i think it was north ledge left side from looking into room)  Used lev and climb the sloped entrance to get height to get on the ledge.
<br />

<br />
intersting thing about the kiting.. I'll have to see about trying that.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Still soloable.  
<br />

<br />
I followed the advice on the area to kite.  Great writeup. Basically stay west of the pipe water runoffs.  There's like 3 of them north to south.  For the first pass I loaded up Kazumi's to try to round up the three east most stonemites but only two of them agroed.  The third one agroed sometime in the middle of the kite.  The stonemites have an extremely small assist/agro range.  
<br />

<br />
This is a straight forward but extremely boring chant kite.  I generally saw the stonemites drop 2% per tick.  The AK dropped 1% per tick.  That's with 4 chants, TDoK, IM4, and JF3.  With the stonemites I also dropped Anglich's Assonance, but this won't land on the AK since he's immune to slow.  I don't have the crit DoT AAs yet as I hardly ever chant kite anymore.  I suppose a suicidal AoE kiter could try all nine stonemites at once but I never got the hang of AoE kiting.  
<br />

<br />
The AK dropped jack and crap btw. 
<br />

<br />
A couple points on the above.  The first post mentioned hailing Gamesh. It's my understanding that Gamesh only hands out the XP version of the sewer trials not the ones for advancement.  You need to hail the high priest for the trial to count towards advancement. 
<br />

<br />
Also, on the post about having to go back and hail Anshara again, I hailed Anshura on the way down.  I got the message about receiving the character flag on killing the AK.  I did not hail Anshura afterwards.  I used a gate potion to get out rather than just quitting the expedition thinking that I would go back and hail Anshura from the entrance.  I changed my mind and just went straight to the high priest.  I quit the expedition but when I hailed the high priest again he gave the expedition to the crematory trial.  I'm wondering if some of your group members were invised the first time they tried hailing Anshura and didn't get the pre-flag.  
<br />

<br />
For anyone thinking about soloing this, it's really pretty easy.  There's only a couple of tricks. The first is getting there which is basically just lull/invis.  The other is staying clear of agroing the roamer once you start kiting the stonemites/AK. On the other hand, I'm not sure how much good it does you to solo this trial other than good bragging rights.  <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-5.gif" border="0" alt="Wink" hspace="2" />

				<td colspan="2"><span>About hailing Ansharu post-AK kill...
<br />

<br />
Our groups Ranger, my gf, did Trial 1 with me without returning to Ansharu for a post-kill hail. Day after we did Trial 2, then we decided to do Trial 3... To get the Seal needed to turn in to the NPC in Trial 3, you must be flagged for Trial 1 and 2... She went and hailed the High Priest and he gave her the 3rd Trial without question.
<br />

<br />
As far as I understand from that, she then has Trial 1 and 2 and thus hailing Ansharu after killing the AK is not needed.
<br />

<br />
However you do need to hail him before you go and kill the AK.
<br />

<br />
And a small tip on the Aged Stonemites... If you did chant-kite them and succeeded you were very lucky, cause at least some of them, not sure if all do, but some of them Summon.
<br />

<br />
I did the Kite the same day as I posted the above guide part, and my aggro from the chants worked just dandy then.
<br />

<br />
I usually chantkite in PoFire at tables with my gf's ranger, and she cant take aggro off me unless she starts to snare excessively or otherwise try to take aggro. From pure shooting and sporadic nuking she wont take aggro off me. And she's an elemental ranger with 240 AA so I think her DPS is fine heh.
<br />

<br />
Just tell your group not to do anything stupid, like the shaman in my group who started to Malo the AK very early in my kite... just luck he didnt take aggro heh.
<br />

<br />
As far as loot goes the AK should drop Song/Spell stone at least. 
<br />

<br />
About the kiting part... We died so many times cause the stupid AK would either kill the Cleric right away from weird aggro or pathing, or it would just kill the tank pretty quick with its 14xx'ish hits and Flurries. I tried kiting it after I had faded earlier and entire group was wiped. Thats how I found out this sucker is kiteable...
<br />

<br />
When we came back later, we decided to just start kiting it right from start. At least that way only the Bard would die at start and not a crucial class such as cleric or the tank, and it would mean nobody would get hurt, except the bard :P
<br />

On a side note, I had tried earlier in the week and kept getting the pathing add from the hallway.  The kite on Friday I just cut that side shorter and stayed away from the entrance and had no problems.  I had to have been running almost directly above the others but they never agro'ed.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I did this last night, not because I planned to, but because my group got owned by an unsnared, fleeing Noc and one of my classic lag spurts.
<br />

<br />
Everyone besides me got creamed by a 4 mob train, but I managed to hit Kazumi's and ran forward toward the boss room.  I faded my train and went inside.
<br />

<br />
I was the only member of my group who already had the Sewer 1 flag.
<br />

<br />
My group was extremely ticked, so I loaded up my chants and told them I was going to try to solo the 9 aged stonemites and the AK.  They laughed at first, but they slowly realized it was doable as I killed more and more of the aged stonemites.
<br />

<br />
The aged kites took upwards of 8 minutes each, give or take a few minutes depending on whether I was trying to 5-chant + Assonance at the time, and whether it was working well.  I have JF3, IM4, and a TDrum.  This is pretty much in line with what previous posters have said, I think.
<br />

<br />
Having only RS4 I was able to keep ahead of the mites fairly well, though I did get caught a few times.  The boss actually caught me twice:  once right after he spawned (I used deftdance), and later when he had 8% health left.  Luckily he only hit me twice the second time.
