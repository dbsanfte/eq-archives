<b>Amplification and Chorus of Clarity - </b>6/28/02 3:37:28 PM<br>~ <b>Illudius</b><blockquote>Hail Fellow Adventurers, Illudius Latiaurlin, Bard of the 38th song, at your service.<br><br>I was wondering if Amplification also works with Chorus of Clarity, as Chorus is a song that uses singing.  So far, my tests on it have been inconclusive.  As for my tests on the effectiveness of the song, I only know that at 38, amplification does 1.5 times the normal bonus + 1.  For example, if with anthem, I have a strength increase of 18, then with amplification, I will have a strength increase of 28.  I don't know if this hold true throughout all levels, but in the 30's this is what is does.  <br><br>Thank you for helping me with the Clarity inquiry.

<b>Another thought - </b>12/15/01 9:20:13 PM<br>~ <b>Candlelight Dreamspinner</b><blockquote>I don't have it, but in reading the articles here.. has anyone tried testing the distance a song reaches? Amplification can cause a change in both the distance of a wave and amplitude. Maybe our songs will increase in their reach. Just an idea.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>Does seemingly nothing - </b>12/14/01 4:14:30 AM<br>~ <b>Kocho Divah</b><blockquote>Okay, played around with this a bit tonight. The song does last 5 ticks, a total of 30 seconds. Thus, it would allow you to twist an extra song, but I don't think it makes the other songs last longer, because I would have one drop when I tried to twist 5 songs with it, thus the other songs still have the same duration.<br><br>I tried playing it with my druid to experiment on its range, it doesn't seem to affect that either. It doesn't affect or amplify any songs. I tried playing self-only singing-based Jonathan's songs and didn't notice any stat difference.<br><br>/sigh</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>4 songs? - </b>12/13/01 1:48:04 PM<br>~ <b>Sychophantic</b><blockquote>i can twist 4 songs without it, with only a VERY minor lapse in the first song (less than 2 seconds). So why would they make a song to twist additional songs? That makes about as much sense as handing a short sword to a cleric and telling them to go fight, ie its not possible.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>Added Weapon Damage?? - </b>12/12/01 6:05:04 PM<br>~ <b>Mandallin</b><blockquote>I heard from another bard with SoL - Which I don't have : (<br>That either this song or the lvl 9 song adds damage to each of your weapons.  I did, however read the discription on the new lvl 9 song which says it only enables the weapon to hit magical creature like will-o-wisps.  I hope this adds damage to your weapons, because song range isn't all that important in most cases.  Range is mainly for pulling and kiting from a distance, but if this song has to be played as well, your number of kiting songs to twist has gone down causes less damage.  From the name of the song, it appears to logically &quot;amplify&quot; your song.  I am only hoping this adds damage to your weapons, but I won't know till I get SoL.  Sorry for the long post...<br></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

It should work just the same as playing a song with an instrument, that is based on that instrument's skill.

Anyway, some helpful info for you:  All the new bard songs up to the lvl 49 one can be purchased at Katta Castellum in a shop called Straight Music.  Just zone in and take a right.  Amplification seems to last longer than 3 ticks, maybe 4 or 5 ticks.  Too bad it doesn't work...would be a great addition.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
