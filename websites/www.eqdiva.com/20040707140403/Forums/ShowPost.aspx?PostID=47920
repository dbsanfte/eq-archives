				<td colspan="2"><span>First off.  This rant is casual vs. uber.  Saying it right off the bat, because I don't want any mistake about whether it is or not to be in anyone's mind.  I suppose I happen to be on the &quot;uber&quot; side of the argument, but I don't mean to belittle anyone or stereotype in this post.  So if you are going to flame, please be reasonable about what I'm going to say and take into consideration that I'm not upset about casual players as a whole, just those that do the things I'm going to talk about.
<br />

<br />
Ok, when the summit thing came out, there was a huge blowup on practically every board about the &quot;casual gamer&quot; not getting their money's worth out of EQ.  The line of reasoning as I can best come up with it sounds like this: &quot;I am upset at people who raid because they have better stuff than me.  I pay just as much for the game as they do and I want to get the same out of it.&quot;  This is usually the type of people who play one or 2 hours a day (or less), I'm assuming these kind of posts are just generally ignored.  So what if I get more gear in the game that I play?  I put a far greater amount of time into it than &quot;average one or two hours a day&quot; so it's only natural that I get more for my time.  It's like the guys who work 60 hours a week at a RL job.  Sure you may make the same rate of pay per hour as they do, but if you work less, you're gonna get a smaller paycheck.
<br />

<br />
Another thing I see is a lot of &quot;casual gamers&quot; decide that anyone who raids must be a fat loser with no life or girlfriend.  Sure it takes time to raid, but nobody says you have to raid every night.  The average member of an average raid guild has 60-70% attendance, which I believe would be something like 4-5 nights a week.  Not to mention that there are guilds that only raid a few nights a week, I came from a guild that raided 3 nights a week.  If you can't give 3 nights of your week up for this game, what makes getting loot so necessary anyway?  I mean, for instance, casters get high hp so they can survive AE's on raids.  The other side of this is those &quot;casuals&quot; that claim they can't raid because of their family.  I know a ton of people who play EQ with their relatives (son/daughter, mom/dad, cousins, grandparents even!)  It maybe is a sort of family ritual to have everyone in the same guild, on a big raid, surrounded by 50 or so of their closest friends.  Quality time spent with someone doesn't necessarily mean you have to be face to face IRL, could be on the phone, or even online.
<br />

<br />
The only other thing I can think of at the moment that bugs me is people who quit EQ.  Great, you quit EQ, you're obviously so much better as a person than I am because I'm still playing this game that's so broken and never going to work right.  It's my choice.  I want to play the game, and I'm willing to pay my $13 a month for a form of entertainment that has brought me many friends and good times.  If you don't want to pay to play, because you feel you aren't getting your money worth, that's fine too.  It's your choice.  You don't have to play the game, nobody is making you.  But when you quit, you don't have to act like everyone who still plays is &quot;consumed by the demon that is EQ&quot;.  It's one thing to hang around on boards because you know people or you still like to discuss the topics about the game, but when people just troll the boards with stuff like &quot;I quit EQ and I'm so much better off, you guys should all quit too because EQ sucks&quot;  it's just annoying.
<br />

<br />
Sorry to rant so much, and sorry if I offend anyone who actually read past the first paragraph.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I can definately understand where you are coming from.
<br />

<br />
Mostly, I consider myself a casual gamer.  But my definition doesn't match yours.  I play for fun, I play when I want, and I do what I want to, mostly.  Sure, I get get a little jealous seeing some of that gear from Time, and high end GoD.  But I don't complain about it, other than to say, &quot;I WANT!&quot;  LOL
<br />

<br />
I always figured that more time in equals more and better gear.  Anyone who plays 'casual' as you describe it is off their rocker to claim they should get as good as you, or heck, as me.  This isn't a freaking UNION where everyone gets the same as everyone else.  This is a situation where you earn everything you get/have.  You don't put the time into it, fine, STFU and stop whining about how &quot;unfair&quot; it is.  We earn our gear, it isn't a freaking hand out.

<br />

<br />
actually only a little percentage really think they deserve to get as good gear as the heavy raiders; what was mostly the grip, beside the bugs, is content.
<br />

<br />
we all pay the same amount to play, all pay the same amount to buy the expansion. but where *casual* start to mumble is being blocked to advance at their own rythmn because you have to get into heavy raiding guild to rise up in the planar progression or just put an X on it. although i must say that lately, on Quellious server, guild are more enclined  to let some outsiders get flag when they do back flagging.
<br />

<br />

<br />
in those last expansions, content were mostly axed toward heavy raiders, and little to none for those who solo ( except bard maybe ^_^) and those who like to quest and get somethign worth the time doing it.
<br />

<br />
now before you flame me, ive been in heavy raiding, where playing 8-10 hours a day 6 days a week was normal<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-4.gif" border="0" alt="Tongue out" hspace="2" />but i cant commit to that much time anymore
<br />

<br />
so im glad you guys who raid more get more stuff, the only problem is those who raid less, they have limited choice in what they can do. For the first time, casual player had a say in what the game could be. its not about cutting content to heavy raiders, its about ADDING some for the casual <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />

First off. This rant is casual vs. uber.
<br />
</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
No, it's raider vs. nonraider.
<br />
The difference between a raider and a nonraider is not the amount of time invested, it's how and when they choose to invest their time.
<br />
For example, I have a necro friend who has been playing the game since summer of 1999, has played the same toon for 5 years, and averages over 20 hours a week. While he is now in a raiding guild, he wasn't for a long time, and spent 99% of his time solo.
<br />
Was he &quot;casual&quot; up until the day he got his guild tag? Did this level 65 umpteen-million AA necro only become uber when he got his planar flags? I wouldn't say so.
<br />

<br />
The way EQ is designed, the only way he could get the best equipment was to join a raiding guild. Until LDoN came out, there was no way, even through dedication and hard work, he could get the best equipment, or even anything close to the best equipment, without raiding.
<br />
<b>Raiding does not necessarily need to equal &quot;uber,&quot; while nonraiding does not necessarily need to equal &quot;casual.&quot;</b>
<br />

<br />
Today, the bard epic is a piece of equipment that takes hard work and dedication to achieve, but can be completed without raiding. IMO we need more content like this - multipart quests that involve difficult mobs but can be done in groups of 6 or 12 players. Naturally, the reward should match the time and sacrifice involved.
<br />

<br />
Imagine if you could get a Songblade of the Eternal through a multipart quest that required 12 NO DROP turn-ins that are rare drops from really difficult named mobs at the end of hard instanced dungeons. Imagine that those named mobs would despawn if you don't get to them fast enough.
<br />
Wow, OMG, something that's hard, takes skill, time, and dedication, that cannot be done in one night, but CAN BE DONE by single groups, and produces a really awesome reward!
<br />
Am I the only person who thinks of these things?
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">

<br />

<br />
The best rewards come from the most difficult content.
<br />
<i>Nobody has a problem with this!</i>
<br />
What I, and a lot of casual players have a problem with is that the most difficult content in the game is structured so that it requires 40 people to be in the same zone at the same time.
<br />
However, most people aren't articulate enough to make this distinction. They say, &quot;Why do raiders get everything?&quot; rather than ask, &quot;Why is the game structured so that raiding is the only way that top players can get a return from their dedication?&quot;
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">&quot;I am upset at people who raid because they have better stuff than me. I pay just as much for the game as they do and I want to get the same out of it.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
This is not equivalent to saying, &quot;I want to get the same rewards for less effort!&quot;
<br />

<br />
We ALL need to get out of our heads the myth that raiding is the only respectable end-game strategy.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">I put a far greater amount of time into it than &quot;average one or two hours a day&quot; so it's only natural that I get more for my time.</span></blockquote>

What if I want to put in the same amount of time as you, but not have to do it in a zone filled with 40 other people?
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">It's like the guys who work 60 hours a week at a RL job. Sure you may make the same rate of pay per hour as they do, but if you work less, you're gonna get a smaller paycheck.</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
Naw. It's more like saying, &quot;If you want to get paid a lot of money, you have to be a rock star.&quot; What if I don't want to be a rock star? What if I want to be a doctor, a CEO, or a lawyer?
<br />

<br />
If we both &quot;work&quot; 60 hours a week in Everquest, but you do it in Time while I do it in Tak, who's going to have better gear?
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">Another thing I see is a lot of &quot;casual gamers&quot; decide that anyone who raids must be a fat loser with no life or girlfriend. Sure it takes time to raid, but nobody says you have to raid every night. The average member of an average raid guild has 60-70% attendance, which I believe would be something like 4-5 nights a week. Not to mention that there are guilds that only raid a few nights a week, I came from a guild that raided 3 nights a week. If you can't give 3 nights of your week up for this game, what makes getting loot so necessary anyway?</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
I play EQ 4-5 days a week.
<br />
However, I play on a pretty fluctuating schedule based on my job, my social life, and my health.
<br />
So, first off, I can't necessarily schedule playtime during prime time, when guilds are raiding. Maybe if I restarted my character on a Euro server or learned Korean and joined an Asian guild I could go on planar raids at 4 am.
<br />
But, realistically, I can't tell a guild, &quot;Yes, I will be able to help you raid at least 2 nights a week&quot; because I can't guarantee that I'm going to be on the right nights or at the right time.
<br />
Beyond that, when I do log in to EQ, I like having the option of doing different things based on my mood. I admit that I'm a pretty capricious creature; that's why I play a kitty bard. Sometimes I don't know whether I want to spend the evening tradeskilling, soloing, grouping, adventuring, working on my epic, or powerleveling a guildie. I don't want to have to be locked down to doing a specific thing on a specific night at a specific time.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">
<br />
The only other thing I can think of at the moment that bugs me is people who quit EQ. Great, you quit EQ, you're obviously so much better as a person than I am because I'm still playing this game that's so broken and never going to work right.
<br />
 It's my choice. I want to play the game, and I'm willing to pay my $13 a month for a form of entertainment that has brought me many friends and good times.
<br />
</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
I agree with this. Obviously, because I still play. But I have RL friends who are gamers who tease me because I went back to EQ while they've quit.
<br />
Gee, we're all geeks, we all waste time on computer games and nerdy pursuits. I guess it makes some people feel better about their nerdiness to know that at least their games aren't as nerdy as my game. Gamers who think that EQ is somehow less cool than, say, GTA, are like midgets arguing over who is the second tallest.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>I think the idea of Time gear through one group content for the non-raiding is an okay idea, if implemented correctly. Though something I think most non-raiding people can't see, is that the loot/month ratio for a raid is not as big as it seems. An avg. raider may get 2 items per month. He may get less, he may get more. In Time, this ratio is probably bigger. But let's play with numbers a bit.
<br />

<br />
A guild raids 5 days a week. Each raid yields 6 loots (I know this number is up for heavy discussion: A Time raid would surely yield much more, so would EP farming, however, EP god kills or other reflagging stuff would yield much less. So would GoD up to Uqua). That's 120 loots per month. We have 60 raiders in the guild. That yields 2 loots per month. 
<br />

<br />
Translate that to a group setting.
<br />
If a group of six players had the same online time as the people in the online guild, drops would have to be 10x less than a guild raid. Meaning each day, 0.6 loots per day, 12 loots per month, obviously exactly as many loots per person per month, 2.
<br />

<br />
Now, here's the fun part: imagine doing progression like group events with bosses and hard encounters to unlock a new level or something similar, then imagine only having 60% chance of even getting a loot, boss or no boss. Sound fun? Oh, and tribute would have to be calibrated with this as well, so no bought augments or the like for the points you accumulate, OR no points for the adventures involving progression. And I'm not talking 30 min. walk in the park dungeons, I'm talking 6 hours of difficult fights and encounters, which would have a 40% chance of not dropping ANY loot, and even if it dropped you'd still have 1/6 chance of getting it.
<br />

<br />
Compare that to the current group setting, like Tipt: 2-3 hours for one aug and one loot: ALL THE TIME. 
<br />

<br />
If a raid should be given the same advantages comparing to this group event, a 6 hour raid should drop 20 augments and 20 loots, giving a total of 800 loot related items per month, which would be 13 1/3 loots per player per month. That is 6 2/3 times a larger amount than what it should be.
<br />

<br />
Okay, so I know I'm a little out there, I'm just trying to prove that group content is more easy on the non-raiding players towards loot distributing than raid content, and that with group progression content you would have to imply the loot ratio of the raids in order to make it fair looking at time invested vs. reward. And I haven't even gone into progression speed...</span></td>

I'm just trying to prove that group content is more easy on the non-raiding players towards loot distributing than raid content, and that with group progression content you would have to imply the loot ratio of the raids in order to make it fair looking at time invested vs. reward. 
<br />
</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
I totally believe you. My above example of 12 NO DROP turn-ins from named mobs was just an idea - in no way did I mean to imply that 12 rare drops from nameds would equal the amount of dedication it would take to get a Songblade from Time. (Because, honestly, I don't know. Maybe it would take 12, maybe it would take 20, maybe it would take 100.) My point was just to elaborate on a concept that's been bouncing around in my head for some time: using incremental quests, like the epics, based on single-group content, while using the instanced zone features, would give nonraiders something to strive for. 
<br />

<br />
Maybe the reward wouldn't be quite Time-level gear, but something analogous but with 95% of the power of a comparable Time-drop. Like a Songblade with 1 less damage, 1 more delay, .2 lower singing modifier, and 90% of the stats.
<br />

<br />
Honestly, I kinda wanted to toss the concept out to see what people thought. To keep this from becoming a threadjack, I just want to reiterate, though, that the reason &quot;raiding=uber&quot; in a lot of people's minds is because EQ is artificially structured that way. The highest, toughest, more rewarding content is found in raid zones. It doesn't have to be that way.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Except to do Breakdown quest past even the first step of it you have to have at least small size raid forces, usually with people geared either at elemental farming stage or else full VT gear.  To get even the first aug from that you have to do I think 3 raids, 2 of which are full force elemental level raids.  The aug you linked comes after you have all the pieces up to and including Txevu, which is like the 2nd last zone or something in GoD, which means you have to plow through about 8 time level raid zones to even get a chance to get the drop for this aug, and that's assuming you had been religiously collecting the other bits for the quest.  That is possibly the worst quest I've ever heard of for risk vs. reward.  Sure the reward is godly, but the work it takes to get is outrageous.
<br />

<br />
I want to (I guess) contradict myself a little bit, although I wasn't trying to say anything against raiders vs. non-raiders.  I have no problem with people wanting equivalent gear when they put in as much time and effort as I do.  Some people just don't have the schedule availability to raid and I understand that.  My first post was more ranting against people who constantly whine that they hardly have any time at all to play the game and yet they want to be on par with someone who plays a whole lot.  
<br />

<br />
I agree that there should be more &quot;epic&quot; quests, and it doesn't have to be just one quest every 5 years for one item, and only for the players at the top end of the game.  I'm tired of boring one or two part quests that don't give a reward worth even running around a single zone for.  Personally I have been working on Secrets of the Planes quest, and I find it fun actually.  I haven't been working my butt off for it, just been doing the pieces of it when it comes to mind or if I see something is up and people are available.  It's nice to be able to do a quest like that casually, and the end result is a nice reward to make the time I spent on it worthwhile.  But there are only a few quests like that, and far between.  
<br />

<br />
I think that there should be more ways to gear up than raid.  I honestly think GoD has come a long way in that.  Take Tipt for instance, as long as you have a group of people who know what they're doing, it's doable without being incredibly geared up.  Although it may take a few tries, it's a good zone to group in for xp and the rewards from it are worthwhile.  Or Vxed for that matter, farming those named is a great source for equipment.  
<br />

<br />
May be a little hypocritical but I really hate when someone goes from a non-raid format to a raid guild and starts getting drops and flags, and immediately seems to forget where they came from and their old friends.  I personally don't mind to hang out in a group of friends in BoT or HoH or PoV or anywhere really, but there are people in my guild who won't xp outside the elemental planes and they act like they're too good for anything else.

<br />

<br />
The operative word there is &quot;today&quot;.  When the epic came out, it was a long and involved quest, that required multiple raids.  
<br />

<br />
I'll say again something I've said before.  The best rewards in the game have <i>ALWAYS</i> required raids.  As expansions come out and the level caps increase/mudflation happened, the old raid content can be done by smaller and smaller groups.  
<br />

<br />
The fact that the game has always required raids is why the &quot;uber&quot; guilds exist in the first place.  If you wanted the good stuff, you got together with increasingly larger numbers of your friends (on a similar schedule) to go and get it.  
<br />

<br />
Yes, they could have designed the game differently, but they had wild success with everyone wanting to get big enough to kill the dragons, and banding together to do so.  
<br />

<br />
Basic rule of marketing, if the demand is there, supply it.  
<br />

<br />
Things are changing now, and they are again reacting to that change.  The raids are designed for smaller groups (54 vs 72), and there is more single and 3 group content.  Which is what the demand is today, and they are listening (once they got the wakeup call :p).  But the rewards that you get still won't be as good as the highest raid content. 
<br />

<br />

I will agree that the game could use more quests like this, but it can't have too many quests like this or they lose their appeal.  Part of the value of an item is the sense of accomplishment at finishing a long task.   If you had to do that for every single piece of equipment in your inventory to get the best item available to you, then you'd likely just groan and play a different game. </span></td>

Just because a formula is successful doesn't mean it could benefit from change. The original EQ before Kunark was wildly successful, too. That doesn't mean that Kunark should never have been released. Heck, Ultima Online was wildly successful. If the computer game industry weren't about continual improvement and evolution, we'd be arguing about this on the forums at UO Stratics.

You bring up an interesting point.
<br />
If near-comparable rewards were available through incremental quests and single-group content, would people stop raiding?
<br />
If the answer is &quot;no,&quot; then you have nothing to worry about.
<br />
If the answer is &quot;yes,&quot; then it makes me wonder if you're having fun raiding at all.
<br />
However, even if the answer is &quot;yes,&quot; then the rewards don't need to be <i>quite-as-good</i> as raid rewards. The best rewards could still come from raiding... even if there was something non-raiders could do better than grinding out LDoN points for Royal Attendant or grinding out plat to buy raiders' hand-me-downs.

Yep. People demanded more single-group content, as well as more content that could be done in small chunks, so they came out with LDoN. However, LDoN has its flaws, the primary one being that although it's a relatively fun grind, it's still a grind, and there's really no sense of accomplishment beyond &quot;gee, I've finally amassed 760 points for a piece of Miragul's armor.&quot;

In any case, I think the Coldain quests are awesome. However, they're also over 3 years old. While there have been some additional incremental quests added to the game since then, there haven't been many.
<br />

<br />
You know what I never hear? I never hear, &quot;The Coldain quests suck! The Coldain quests ruined the game!&quot; However, I do hear, on occasion, &quot;I quit the game after PoP, it just burned me out,&quot; or &quot;I quit raiding because it's too much like a second job.&quot; Every comment I hear about the Coldain quests is positive - so why isn't there more content like that?

<br />
Sometimes the pressure to do something other than raid is not driven by whether or not it's fun but by practical necessity.  Not everyone can coordinate the schedules of 30 to 70 people effectively enough to pull off a raid.  The simple truth is, the majority of people would enjoy a variety of types of content -- soloing, grouping, AND raiding, if they were done right.  I find soloing slow, boring, and tedious.  But if it were made more fast-paced and less repetitious, I wouldn't.  I love grouping with a good group but hate grouping with idiots.  I love raiding when we move quickly and especially when I am leading the raids.  I hate sitting on my butt waiting for some other raid leader to finish 2 hours of prep for a 5 minute fight.  I think most people tend to feel the same way.  If near-comparable rewards were available, I think most people would prefer to pursue them in the simplest, least-complicated way they can.  Raids are seldom simple and uncomplicated hence, the answer to the question, as you framed it, would get a yes from a lot of people who really do enjoy raiding.

Uh no.. we've done the last shawl in iceclad with 5 people.. that's hardly a raid. Its such a simple effect.. he runs to spot.. spawns mobs you kill mobs. rinse and repeat. Crowd control dps tank and healer bam you've got your shawl.
<br />
Then again we're talking about vellious content the event needed a raid Then.. now with ldon equipped people you need A group 2 at most if you want over kill and a quicky event.
