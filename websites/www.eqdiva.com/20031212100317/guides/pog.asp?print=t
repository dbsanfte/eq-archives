<h3>Pulling in the Plane of Growth, a guide for Bards</h3>
by Keiz Dinzyar, Prexus server
<br><br>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
They say we Bards are the "Jack of all trades, Master of none" but pulling PoG will really give your bardic talents a chance to shine! No one can pull PoG as well as a Bard can and this guide can show you how. So read these tips and go out to impress your guild and your friends by making all of your raids a success! 
<h4>Your Group</h4>
First off, these are the people you should have in
your group:
<ol>
<li><b>55+ Mage </b>- I can not say enough good about Call of
the Hero.  Too many adds?  Agroed something you
shouldn't have?  No problem!
<li><b>Main Assist</b> - With the Main Assist in your group
you can communicate easier - tell them what and how
many you've got coming in.
<li><b>Main Chanter</b> - So they not only know what and how
many is incoming, but what the Main Assist will be
attacking first.
<li><b>Main Cleric</b> - Mainly to keep to the Main Assist
alive, but also to heal and buff you.  You're going to
need it.
<li><b>Main Shaman</b> - Makes it easier for them to know what
to Slow first, but also to keep you buffed.  Again,
you're going to need it.
</ol>
<br>

<h4>Buffage</h4>
Next, put on all of your best resist gear and get the
following buffs (you are going to get hit and you are
going to get nuked, no ifs ands ors or buts - you NEED
these):
<ol>
<li><b>Heroism</b> (cleric) - 400HP 20AC 
<li><b>Symbol</b> (cleric) - 700HP 
<li><b>Talisman</b> (shaman) - 380HP
<li><b>Stamina</b> (shaman) - 50STA
<li><b>Group Resist Magic</b> (chanter)- 55MR 
<li><b>Resist Fire</b> (cleric/shaman)- 45FR 
<li><b>Resist Cold</b> (cleric/shaman) - 45CR 
</ol>
Note: If your Cleric is level 60 you should ask for an Aegolism (1100HP 54AC) instead of numbers 1 and 2. And if your Shaman is level 60, ask for a Focus of the Spirit (405HP 67STR 60DEX) rather than number 3. 
<br><br>
A few of the mobs you'll be pulling like to dispel,
especially wisps.  Which will rapidly become a major
pain for your buffers unless you keep some "dummy"
buffs up in the first few slots.  I like to use Dark
Elf illusion (mask), Levitate (pegasus cloak), and
Shield of Flame (singing steel bracer).
<br><br><br>

<h4>Song Lineup</h4>
Now, for the songs you are going to want to have
loaded.  Use your best drum (epic bards may wish to
use that with a Sarnak Battle Shield or something
similar).
<ol>
<li><b>Selo's Accelerating Chorus / Selo's Accelerando</b> -
Careful not to get too far ahead of your pull or they
will stop following.  This can be used to your
advantage if you pulled too many or agroed something
you shouldn't have (you will need to /camp or a CoH to
clear the agro).
<li><b>Occlusion of Sound / Syvelian's Anti-Magic Aura</b> -
Both of these are great for pulling because they agro
without doing damage and have a long range.  I tend to
prefer Occlusion because I don't like stripping my
pulls of their SoW.  I also like to Occlusion whatever
the Main Assist is on before I head out for another
pull to help the Shaman land a Slow.
<li><b>Elemental Rhythms</b> - You'll need massive MR, FR, and
CR.
<li><b>Song of Dawn</b> - Most of the time you'll have a great
Main Assist and won't need this (a good one will use
arrows to peel mobs off you as you come in).  However,
if you find yourself getting beat on, pulse this once
or twice to be happily on your way.
<li><b>Melanie's Mellifluos Motion</b> - This song can save
your life if anything actually manages to Root you.
<li><b>Cantana of Replenishment / Cassindra's Chorus of
Clarity</b> - Even with C2 your casters and clerics are
going to need occational med breaks given the constant
pulls you as a Bard can provide.
<li><b>Selo's Song of Travel</b> - Exceptionally useful for
scouting or going for a specific mob.  Only the nameds
see thru it, making it disgustingly easy for you to
pull them single.  Be sure anyone in your group with a
pet also has SoW so you won't kill it.
<li><b>Song of Highsun</b> - 9 times out of 10 you will never
see anything you Gate with this again because their
spawn spot will be out of following range.  Use it to
zap adds while pulling or as crowd control if you've
got more than the raid can handle in camp. <i>"DO NOT Highsun a wounded mob for any
reason (it will summon)!"</i>
</ol>
<br>

<h4>Protectors of Growth</h4>
The next thing you'll need to worry about are the
Protectors of Growth.  One or two of these annoying
faun-type creatures will spawn every 23-25 minutes. 
They are level 53-57 and cannot be mezzed.  They have
zone-wide agro range, so no matter where you are or
what you are doing they will come for you.  If they
catch you unaware or in the middle of a big battle,
say hello to CR.  So either time them yourself or have
someone else do it.
<br><br>
Kiting. Standard procedure if the raid got wiped
out...  For the CR it is your job to keep the
Protectors of Growth off the clerics and freshly
rezzed.
<br><br>
Get a drum and HP & resist buffs and zone on in.  Once
the PoGs get to you, proceed to kite them by twist
Selo's with Elemental and Guardian Rythms.  Adding a
regen song (Cantata or Hymn) to the twist will be
necessary if the rezzing takes too long.  Also, be
SURE to have Mellifluos Motion memorized.  You are
very likely to get Rooted now that you are nekkid and
without your resist gear.  And if you die while kiting
the PoGs, say hello to CR #2 because the clerics and
freshly rezzed are next. 
<br><br><br>

<h4>Three Main "Safe Spots"</h4>
There, now that all of the preliminary stuff is out of
the way, we can get down to BUSINESS.  It's time to
talk about the three main "safe spots" or camps that
most every raids use, and the fourth (optional) one.
<ol>
<li><b>West Wall</b> - Right by the zone-in.  Everyone zoned
in invis to avoid the Whorl and ran west.  Here they
are.  Easiest way to pull to here is to first, if you
see a mob - bring it in.  Next, hit TRACK while in
camp (our short range is actually a blessing given
that we do not have distance sorting) and pick a mob. 
Repeat until you find yourself running so far you are
pulling from one of the other camps.  The mobs you can
pull are:
<ol>
<li type="A"><b>A rolling plains steed</b> -  These drop WIZ/NEC/MAG
boots, bracers, gloves, hats, and arms.  Also known to
drop BRD legs (rare).
<li type="A"><b>A gale wolf</b> - These drop CLR/SHD boots, bracers,
gloves, hats, and arms.
<li type="A"><b>A spirit flux wolf</b> -  These are not mezzable, so be
extra careful not to get too many of them in a single
pull.  They drop ROG/WAR boots, bracers, gloves, hats,
and arms.
<li type="A"><b>A sanguine kodiak</b> - These drop ENC/MNK boots,
bracers, gloves, hats, and arms.
<li type="A"><b>A glade stalker</b> -  These drop BRD/SHM boots,
bracers, gloves, hats, and arms.
</ol>
<br>
<li><b>Waterfall</b> - Keeping the west wall on your left, SoW
everyone and follow it to the waterfall.  Unplug your
speakers, that water noise gets real old real fast. 
Use the same pulling technique as you did at the West
Wall.  The mobs you can pull are:
<ol>
<li type="A"><b>An entoling essence channeler</b> -  One of the many
totem mobs.  These drop MAG robes/legs/arms.
<li type="A"><b>An entoling culler</b> -  Another one of the totems. 
These drop WIZ robes/legs/arms.
<li type="A"><b>An entoling harvester</b> -  Another totem.  These drop
NEC robes/legs/arms.
<li type="A"><b>A feral amalgam</b> -  Flowers.  These drop ROG/WAR breastplates/legs/arms. E. A sylvan protector.  These look like Protectors of Growth.  They drop ENC/MNK robes/breastplates/legs/arms. F. You will probably also find a lot of flux wolves and a few bears here as well.
</ol>
<br>
<li><b>Lake</b> - Follow the river out from the waterfall to
the lake.  Facing the lake, go left just over the
first hill.  Most raids set up shop right here as it
is pretty close to the thifling camps.  In order to
pull from the thifling camps you will either need to
have a Druid or Ranger friend come up and keep them
harmonized (they will not take faction hits, but it
will be boring as there really isn't any loot in PoG
for them) or have a Monk split them up - Lament
sometimes works, as well.  Everything else you can
just track and pull single like at the other two
camps.  The mobs you can pull here are:
<ol>
<li type="A"><b>A thifling sprite</b> -  Look like brownies.  They drop
CLR/SHD breastplates/legs/arms.
<li type="A"><b>A contemplative thifling</b> -  Same as above.
<li type="A">Ordro and his Assistant.  Same as the other
thiflings but with a higher chance of dropping loot. 
Pulling one automatically agros the other.
<li type="A"><b>A serene forest spirit</b> -  Wisps.  Yellow ones drop
BRD breastplates/legs/arms.  Green ones drop SHM breastplates/legs/arms. E. You will also find lots of flowers, sylvans, and wolves here.
</ol>
<br>
<li><b>Pumas</b> - Back at the waterfall, keep the wall on
your left and cross the river, heading away from the
West Wall camp.  Follow the wall up all the hills
until you find a nice flat place near Tunare's tree to
pull too.  Most raids do not come this way, given the
obvious proximity to Tunare and all of the treants. 
But it can be rewarding should you choose to come this
way as most of the robe/breastplate/leg/arm dropping
mobs can be pulled here.  You will find a ton of
pumas, wisps, and (if you pull from the tree) treants.
<br><br>
It should be noted that all treants will attempt to
Gate when low on health.  If they are successful you
will probably have a CR on your hands, seeing as they
will then summon and kill everyone one by one.
</ol>
<br><br>

<h4>Named Mobs</h4>
The named treants always drop
robes/breastplates.  These are:
<ol>
<li><b>Ail the Elder</b> - He SILENCES (as in no one can cast
spells of any kind - no heals, no nukes.. nuffin). 
Most raids stear clear of him.  He roams near the
Waterfall and Pumas  camps.
<li> <b>Rumbleroot</b> - Has an AE DoT that slurps around
100hp/tick.  If you take him on, just be sure everyone (especially casters) are majorly HP buffed and have maximum regen.  As a Bard you should twist Cantata or Hymn with Niv's for this fight.  He will summon all remaining wisps to his aid.
<li><b>Treah Greenroot</b> - She'll cast nukes but they are no worse than any of the other casting mobs.  Be sure everyone's MR CR and FR are buffed and you should be fine.  But she hits very hard.  Will summon all of the remaining sylvans to her aid.
<li><b>Fayl Everstrong</b> - Same as Treah, only he will summon all of the remaining entolings to his aid.
</ol>
The other named mobs are quite a bit easier to kill
and nice in that they are all garunteed to drop at
least one random piece of armor.  The ones I know of
are:
<ol>
<li><b>Galiel Swiftfoot</b> - A large horse, found usually at
the West Wall camp.  Drops random legs.
<li><b>Sarik the Fang</b> - A large gale wolf, found usually
at the West Wall camp.  Drops random arms.
<li><b>Grohl Strongback</b> - A large sanguin kodiak, found
usually at the West Wall camp.  Drops random arms.
<li><b>Keeper of the Glades</b> - A large puma, found usually
at the Pumas camp.  He will summon pumas to his aid. 
Drops random legs.
<li><b>Undogo Digolo</b> - A large totem, found usually at the
Lake camp.  He will summon totems to his aid.  Drops
random legs.
</ol>

<b>Named mobs summoning aid</b>
<br><br>
There has been a great deal of speculation and
controvercy over how this actually works, but first
and foremost forget the whole concept of "summoning" -
they really just yell for help.  Imagine a mob typing
/y.
<br><br>
When you first agro one of the mobs that summons aid,
it will shout for assistance.  All of the creatures
under its command (still alive) will then run in a
straight line to the SPOT WHERE IT YELLED and not (as
has been the common misconception) TO YOU, nor to the
YELLING MOB.  As long as you are not there by the time
they arrive, or pull past any on your way back to the
ambush, you will not get any adds.
<br><br>
Note: if you get too far ahead of the mob and have to
go back for it, it will yell for help again (and the
other critters will run now to this new spot instead).
 So be wary of that.  Also, as of a few months back
the mobs started to sometimes yell just before they
die.  Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.  If
they do you had better deal with the loot FAST and
have everyone move move move (the underlings are
heading to that final yell spot)!
<br><br>
Allow me to reiterate.  It does not matter how many of
the underlings are still alive, you do NOT need to
exterminate them all before you can pull the boss. 
All that is really required is a path clear of
underlings between the boss and you.  If you have a
clear path...  Pull!  And do not camp after the fight
to "clear agro" or anything along those lines.  It is
not needed.  The ONLY thing you need to worry about is
moving everyone if the boss yelled a final time before
it died, which does not always happen.
<br><br><br>

<h4>Quest mobs </h4>
These are extremely tough to kill and drop
no loot, so don't bother.
<ul>
<li><b>Guardian of Takish</b> - A suit of armor, found in a
building on the west wall if you head away from
waterfall instead of towards it.  Easy to avoid.
<li><b>Ancient Totem</b> - Found in a shrine near the Lake
camp.  A handful of mumbling totems surround him. 
Neither he nor they drop loot so don't bother.  You'll
need to be wary of him when pulling to the Lake camp,
but he's easy enough to avoid.
<li><b>Tunarean Earthmelder</b> - A large flower, found in a
cage if you go past all of the thiflings and wisps
away from the Lake camp.  Easy to avoid.
<li><b>Entrancing Water Nymph</b> - Found out in the lake. 
Easy enough to avoid, just don't go swimming.
</ul>
