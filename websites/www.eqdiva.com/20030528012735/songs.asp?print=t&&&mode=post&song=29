<b>Don't think cha has much to do with it.. - </b>6/28/02 4:20:55 PM<br>~ <b>Kiaba Twintones</b><blockquote>I'm wearing some crusty armor and not much else that would bring my CHA up, so it's usually at 82 (depending what weapon I'm wearing,) and the song works extremely well.  I noticed when I got my brass from 80 to 110 it stuck a whole lot more.<br><br>On the other hand my lullaby hardly works.  So I don't think CHA affects the fear a whole lot.  Dunno about dex.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Like Mezz? - </b>6/28/02 5:40:20 AM<br>~ <b>Samlander</b><blockquote>Does fear have the same requirements as mezz does?<br><br>As far as I know, mezz is affected by your equipped instrument, instrument skill, and Charisma.<br><br>So my question is, does Charisma affect how well Fear works?<br>Also, is there any evidence that high Dex affects Fear? Just curious. Thanks</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Good For Escape - </b>1/28/02 5:11:15 PM<br>~ <b>Elzih</b><blockquote>Fear Kiting with this is -very- difficult (i found) due to the fact that it is AoE. I tried Fear Kiting in Marus Seru, and eventually you end up aggroing more than you can deal with. However, i always have this song memmed when i'm in an indoor dungeon. If things go wrong and we get trained, i fire this bad boy up and we make for the exit. I've sent up to 9 baddies scurrying, giving us plenty of time to make for the exit.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>fear vs. mezz - </b>1/27/02 6:44:06 PM<br>~ <b>Bellosard Harpysong</b><blockquote>i really like fear kiting.  i read that some have a problem with it, but i think it is from low brass (had that prob when i tried to instrument fight with DDD) and i haven't even touched my charisma (70 or 75 i think).  But what i find really useful, is that it seems to work on mobs alot better than mezz.  Now i get alot of flack from over-cautious party members to not use fear when $#!^ is hitting the fan, but here are some things to consider:<br><br>1.  mezzes have more resists and don't last as long and seem to just resist more often than fear.<br><br>2.  once cast, fear last until it wears off, usually the full 18 secs instead of the mezz that usually last 3-5 secs at that.<br><br>3.  most say to NOT use fear in those dire circumstances because of the implicated chaos it will cause, bringing down the house so to speak.  but quite simply it boils down to this:  if you are in the situation where you have 8 adds, it can't get much worse (knock on wood).  the best analogy i can come up with (forgive me for rambling and the nastalgia but there is a point) is, if you ever wrestled in high-school and found yourself on your back, you have 2 options.  1)  you can conserve your energy for what might be the rest of the match, trying to get out or 2)  use everything you got to get out and not worry about the rest of the match, because if you don't, there won't BE a 'rest of the match'.<br><br>The point being that your quibbling party members miss is that,<br>yeah, using ae fear with cause great upheaval, BUT if you are in the situation where it is do or die, that is the least of your worries.  And in that last stitch effort, where my life and my party depends on it, i will use fear over mezz.  To me it is more reliable.<br><br>on a final note, it is funny while soloing to stop in the middle of battle, fear the mob and heal.  a friend looking over my shoulder commented on how amusing it was when the fear broke, the mob would come back and as soon as it hit the area of effect, would turn around and run again :)</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Fear Nerfed? - </b>1/21/02 6:21:09 PM<br>~ <b>Daidas</b><blockquote>I have tried to play this a couple time recently and it doesn't do anything, not missed note, not anything.  There isn't even text that comes up and my taget certainly isn't feared.  I want to try fear kiting in SM but got whumped on pretty good with out it working-thanks,<br>Daidas  <br>53 Bard-Xev</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Brass Skill Has to be high - </b>1/16/02 1:09:22 PM<br>~ <b>Steppy</b><blockquote>Most bards have trouble with missed notes on this because brass skill lags behind other skills.  You need to find a safe spot like the Arena or back in the EC tunnels near the NRo zone and practice, practice, practice until you get the brass skill maxed.  Otherwise, you will have this fail just when you think you have that Hill Giant running and you KNOW how much that hurts!</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>RE: help please! - </b>1/16/02 7:33:34 AM<br>~ <b>Aeronica Songweaver</b><blockquote>You may be having a problem because either your singing skill or brass skill is not high enough.  That's just a guess.  At level 26, I doubt your singing skill is low.  My singing and instrument skills are over 130 (for level 26 the cap is 135 I believe), though my charisma is only 93 and I am still able to start this song and have it stick about 80% of the time.<br>If any of your instrument skills are below 125, I'd advise to take some time to bring those skills up.  Sitting in a corner with instrument in hand, and playing a song that uses that instrument for a few hours really works for me.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>help please! - </b>1/14/02 8:14:13 PM<br>~ <b>Zarai</b><blockquote>I cannot get this song to work for me, singing or playing brass. My charisma and dex are both over 130.

<b>Fear can be silly fun if your so inclined - </b>1/11/02 11:59:39 AM<br>~ <b>Keyzz</b><blockquote>Fear is great for kiting and as an escape tool. Previous posts have said as much. But noone has covered its potential for fun and anarchy. Let me explain..<br>If your bored in , say North Karana, head to the undead spawn point and sweep them all away with fear, then jog over to the raider camp and wait. The undead will aggro the bandits and a large brawl will errupt (leaving you untouched). For more fun you can fear the whole lot of them and herd them around the zone. When I did this I got a small train of people chasing me, attempting to help me with my train.<br>Ok, ok this wont net you a bit of EXP or loot, but its quite entertaining. Tailor the concept to your location and you can fear pretty much anyone you choose, just for laughs mind you. When your done clowning, hit the zone with Selo's on to avaoid that fac hit.<br>So, go ahead, waste some time and play around. Its a game, isnt it?</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>this spell is incredible 8) - </b>1/7/02 9:17:01 PM<br>~ <b>Fuunky</b><blockquote>as soon as i got this spell i was able to solo yellows, and solo an entire gnoll spire in SK. i lvled so fast with this spell its not even funny. and the resist rate isnt bad either you get 3 trys for it to stick and unless you have really crappy brass skill it is very dependent. it is also great to twist in the lvl 23 chain song so that they are snared and makes fearing them that much easier, however i only use that technique in groups due to the reduced chance of fearing the mob becuase you would only be able to cast the fear 2 times instead of 3 becuase of the snare.<br><br>Fuunky, bard of the 30th song<br>Warrior on the Solusek Ro server</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Resists? Can it be Sung? - </b>12/14/01 7:07:12 AM<br>~ <b>Bitterman73</b><blockquote>What's the resist rate like on this song? Hopefully not as bad as Lucid Lullaby. And how effective is this song when sung, without the horn. I'm afraid I have two strikes against me as I LOVE my swords, and I cannot switch out instruments while twisting without lagging. Any and all help is always appreciated.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Big Help - </b>12/3/01 9:51:54 AM<br>~ <b></b><blockquote>I've soloed all the way up from lvl 1 and getting this song changed the way I played...  From going toe to toe with mobs and now snare, fear, DDD, and Wack them from behind.  Much easier.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Great to solo - </b>11/18/01 2:29:37 PM<br>~ <b>Thylarion Wintersong</b><blockquote>I don't know if it's right...but you guys can try it. Twist this song with Selo's Consonant Chain (Level 23 Song) and you can solo reds (If you have a high Charisma that the enemie wont resist the songs). But watch for adds !</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>Ping pong :) - </b>10/8/01 11:17:35 AM<br>~ <b>Leromeo Decesdames</b><blockquote>With this song and snare you can fight multiple mobs, every mobs will run far away but the one you are snaring.<br>So you keep all the adds and wanderers near for the time you will have finished your target, they just do some ping pong.<br>Best advice to use this tactic effectively is to only twist the 2 songs, so resists and missed notes don't put you in danger.<br>When you get the 2 songs to stick on the mobs you can add a little buff, regen or dmg song depending on the situation.<br>If you are in a group you will see your partners open wide eyes as you manage to put down 3 to 4 mobs at once :)</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>2 Chant Kiting - </b>9/28/01 12:25:03 AM<br>~ <b>Benway</b><blockquote>Just with regards to the info posted under Bard kiting, I've often found it to be more effective to use the two chants and Selo's Chain rather than Accelerando - there is the chance of it being resisted, but I've found if you keep your distance, then even if it is you can get it off again before the mob reaches you.  The advantage to using this rather than Selo's is just that you don't have to run around quite as much - having tried using accelerando it can get tiring pretty quickly, so this is a good alternative.<br><br>Benway, level 45 Bard on the Rathe</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Trumpet incomplete - </b>8/22/01 6:08:24 PM<br>~ <b>Basstone</b><blockquote>If you are using the Unfinished Brass Trumpet, it's not a complete Brass instrument even though it says brass.  I believe you can make a complete Trumpet, maybe magical in nature, or at least with some bonus, by combining it with one or more items.  Have no clue what to try though.  But that instrument will NOT allow you to use Brass-only songs, and songs that get better with Brass will not be any more effective as you are using your voice.  You will also increase your singing skills, not brass, with this equipped.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Be a hero! - </b>8/21/01 5:11:53 PM<br>~ <b>Borus</b><blockquote>This song is marvelous, and great to become a hero! Yesternight I on lvl 26 saved a lvl 30 paladin to survive a train by scaring away all the mobs, giving him time to recuperate. I even went and fear-kited some of them (they where blue to me) while he finished one. <br><br>Very cool way to save some one's life, just go there and show those ugly creatures who is the man!

<b>But at higher levels... - </b>6/1/01 1:35:18 PM<br>~ <b>Lyrik</b><blockquote>As a soloing tool this is becoming much less prefered than chant kiting. Even with a CSS and a Harmonic Dagger as weapons it takes a while to bring down low blues. And when fear is resisted or wears off you can get nailed for some serious damage.  However with a melee partner or 2 fear kiting is the way to go without question.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

No one takes any damage, so not much mana is expended for heals.  We were taking giants with little or no down time with me (33bard, 35 ranger, 35 shammy).

We were almost at the steps where the Archon pops when we were jumped by a lizard, then quickly flooded with adds.  We all thought we were finished, when the bard sang this song, sending all the lizards fleeing in terror. Of course, they came back with friends, but by that time i'd come up with a plan:  I targeted one of the lizards, rooted it as it got close, and had the bard sing his song again.  All the lizards ran...except the rooted one. He continued playing this song to keep the ads away as we picked them off one by one.  Dangerous trick, but neat if you can do it.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>If you're good a trumpeting... - </b>2/15/01 4:57:15 PM<br>~ <b>Gaedan Mentheren</b><blockquote>With a practiced brass skill, you can do quite effective &quot;fear-kiting&quot; in places that are fairly wide open, like Lake of Ill Omen or Everfrost (Frigid Plains).  Equip your horn, pull in a target with Constant Chains, then twist Screech, Denon's Discord, and reapply Chains.  Safe, effective, and fairly quick.  When the mobs go on the run at low hitpoints, pull out your lute, stack Denon's Discord with a shot of Chords of Dissonance, and let yourself heal while your target dies. :)</blockquote></td></tr></table></blockquote><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href="/songs.asp?&&&mode=post&song=29">Back to Normal Mode</a><br><br><br><i>Printed from EQDiva.com on 5/27/03 9:27:38 PM.</i><br><br></td></tr></table>
