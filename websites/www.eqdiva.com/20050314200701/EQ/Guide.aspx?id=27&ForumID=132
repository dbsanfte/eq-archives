<P>/salute bards</P>
<P>Ok, found most pieces of my old kite guide, and I've added some recent changes in terms of song line ups, mana requirements, mob behavior, etc.</P>
<P>I&#8217;ve fired up my high-speed MS Paint Accessory (ha!) and put together a few quick chalkboard-type drawings, now converted to animated gifs, displaying, and hopefully explaining, the full range of kite techniques available to the best class in the game. Additionally, these techniques can be used at 18 with a DDD/CoD AE Kite, at 30 with a DDD/Fufils chant, at 38 with a Fufils/Chant of Flame combo, or 46 with a Fufils/Flame/Disease/Frost Chant combo, or at 50+ with Flame/Disease/Frost/Poison Chant 4 Chants(assuming you can twist in Selos or have some SOW ability). You&#8217;ll see what I mean, but the techniques are essentially the same for all levels and available songs of the inquiring bard.</P>
<P>Of course, I don&#8217;t profess to know all the strategies or any of that, but I have been successful on kiting since 18 with DDD, CoD, and auxillary spells, and I quad kited a wizard into the 50s with Bonds of Force AE Snare spell and nukes. Now, some of that is different from the bard kites, but many of the principles are the same. I&#8217;m going to lay down a couple of techniques on chalkboards to help out any bard who is thinking about this thrilling form of combat.</P>
<P>While my guide attempts to be fairly thorough in its design, I am hopeful that my fellow bards will simply pick up on the basics of each tactic and generate their own approaches. And as unique as each of you are, Im sure you will. =)</P>
<P>Important Note: To all bards, please download a copy of Reed Stormwind&#8217;s Song Analysis Spreadsheet to understand your songs per level and the relative damage associated with them. This can be found at <A href="http://www.eqdiva.com/">www.eqdiva.com</A>, your bard Mecca, and tell &#8216;em Reinn sent you.</P>
<P>Well, lets get to it...</P>

<P></P>
<H3>BARD KITING: Names and Definitions</H3>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Target/AE</STRONG> &#8211; Target/AE kiting is generally employed by bards under level 18 who have not yet acquired Denon&#8217;s Disruptive Discord (DDD), their second AE damage song. In Target/AE kiting, the song twist is generally:<BR><BR>[{Selos &gt; Brusco&#8217;s Boastful Bellow (direct &#8216;target&#8217; damage) &gt; Chords of Dissonance (AE damage) &gt; repeat}]<BR>
<LI><STRONG>AE </STRONG>&#8211; AE kiting is generally employed by bards over level 18 who have DDD. In AE Kiting, the song twist is generally:<BR><BR>[{Selos &gt; Chords of Dissonance &gt; DDD &gt; repeat}]<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Chant/AE</STRONG> - Chant/AE kiting is generally employed by bards at level 30 who have acquired Fulfil&#8217;s Curtailing Chant, their first targeted chant song. <BR><BR>IMPORTANT NOTE: For some using Chant Kiting, Fufil&#8217;s is always used FIRST in the song pattern because of the inherent debuff to Magic Resistance (MR) applied to the mob when the song is landed, this helps to land the subsequent damage songs accordingly, however in upper level straight chant kiting a four chant rotation composed Tuyens' chants of flame/disease/frost/and poison is probably more effective.<BR><BR>In C/AE kiting, the song twist is generally:<BR><BR>[{Selos &gt; Fufil&#8217;s &gt; DDD &gt; repeat}]<BR>
<LI><STRONG>2 Chant</STRONG> &#8211; 2 Chant kiting is employed by bards who have reached level 38 and have acquired Tuyen&#8217;s Chant of Flame. In 2 Chant kiting, the song twist is generally:<BR><BR>[{Selos &gt; Fufil&#8217;s &gt; Chant of Flame &gt; repeat}]<BR>
<LI><STRONG>3 Chant</STRONG> &#8211; 3 Chant kiting, of course, is available to those bards at level 42 who have acquired Tuyen&#8217;s Chants of Disease. In 3 Chant kiting a bard must either (1) be able to twist 4 songs effectively, or (2) rely on SOW spells from friends, SOW potions, or Jboots. The song twist for a 4-song lineup is generally:<BR><BR>[{Selos &gt; Fufil&#8217;s &gt; Chant of Flame &gt; Chant of Disease &gt; repeat}]<BR><BR>The song twist for a bard with SOW, etc, would generally be:<BR><BR>[{Fufil&#8217;s &gt; Chant of Flame &gt; Chant of Frost &gt; repeat}]<BR>
<LI><STRONG>4 Chant</STRONG> - A bards first shot at 4 Chant kiting now comes at level 46 with the inclusion of Tuyen's Chant of Frost. At this point, a bard will either need to be sow'd/Jbooted, or capable of twisting selos and then 4 chants in one twist cycle (seriously, not very advisable in a kiting situation). <BR><BR>The song twist for a bard with without SOW is generally:<BR><BR>[{Selos &gt; Fufil's &gt; Chant of Flame &gt; Chant of Disease &gt; Chant of Frost &gt; repeat}]<BR><BR>The song twist for a bard with SOW, etc, would be:<BR><BR>[{Fufil's &gt; Chant of Flame &gt; Chant of Disease &gt; Chant of Frost &gt; repeat}]<BR><BR>Obviously, a bard could simply choose to drop the Fufil's Curtailing Chant from the twist line up at this level and simply go with a 3 Chant kite using the the higher level Tuyen's Chants accordingly.<BR><BR>The song twist for this apprach at 46 would be as follows:<BR><BR>[{Selo's &gt; Chant of Flame &gt; Chant of Disease &gt; Chant of Frost &gt; repeat}]<BR><BR><EM><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG></EM> At level 49 a bard will acquire the song Selo&#8217;s Accelerating Chorus (SAC), providing bard speed that remains in effect for 150 seconds (2.5 minutes). This awesome song ability allows for the most devastating forms of bard kiting, the unhindered 3 Chant Kite, the 4 Chant Kite, the Charm Kite, or the Swarm Kite. The only key is timing when to refresh the Chorus during the kite.<BR><BR>At level 50 a bard will receive another Tuyen's Chant, the Chant of Poison allowing for a full, and deadly, 4 Chant kite effort. With the use of SAC at 49, this chant method is extremely devestating.<BR><BR>The song twist for a 4 Chant kite at level 50+ would be:<BR><BR>[{SAC &gt; Chant of Flame &gt; Chant of Disease &gt; Chant of Frost &gt; Chant of Poison &gt; repeat or cycle through the Chants as SAC is 150 seconds in duration}]<BR><BR>Later, a bard simply 'upgrades' to the next level of Tuyen's Chant, and drops off the lower level one to scale up the damage on their chant techniques.<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Fear Kiting</STRONG> &#8211; In fear kiting, the bard will employ melee skills to eliminate the mob in question. In this technique, the bard will &#8216;pull&#8217; a mob to a defined, and hopefully isolated location, &#8216;chain&#8217; the mob using a slow song (Consonant Chain at 23, or Largo&#8217;s Absonant Binding at 51, for example), then apply the bard fear song (Angstlich&#8217;s Appalling Screech at 26) to &#8216;fear&#8217; the mob and thus send it slowly moving away from the bard, allowing for an unhindered attack upon it&#8217;s back. A self-only attack buff song (such as Jonathan&#8217;s 7 or 45 level versions) is usually put into the twist to maximize the bard&#8217;s melee output. One key in Fear Kiting is to know the &#8216;path&#8217; a mob will take once it is &#8216;feared&#8217;, to ensure additional mobs are not picked up along the way. This can be accomplished by a few quick test on lower-end mobs in the area. Quick notes: (1) if the mob breaks fear, always re-apply fear first, regardless of where in the twist you are. (2) &#8216;chain the mob before it reaches you following the pull, and try and time the fear accordingly so that you are not even hit by the beast. The song twist for Fear Kiting is generally:<BR><BR>[{Selos (to pull) &gt; Chain/Binding &gt; Screech &gt; Jonathan&#8217;s &gt; Chain/Binding &gt; Screech &gt; Jonathan&#8217;s &gt; repeat}]<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Charm Kiting</STRONG> - Certainly the kiting technique requiring the most skill and finesse, and resulting in the most potential damage and experience, Charm Kiting is pure bard mayhem. Starting at level 27, when a bard acquires Solon&#8217;s Song of the Sirens, a bard begins to learn this devastating form of combat. In Charm Kiting, a bard will use his Siren abilities to &#8216;charm&#8217; one mob, thus making it his/her obedient pet, and use that charmed creature to attack another. Generally, this pattern of charm/attack continues until the &#8216;pet&#8217;s&#8217; health is low enough for the bard to Chant Kite (pick a method) the mob to death and reap the entire experience associated. Charm Kiting is employed against two or more mobs and can result in considerable experience gain, but it requires considerable practice and skill. Additionally, a bard must employ pet command keys to ensure that their charmed &#8216;pet&#8217; attacks when appropriate and retreats if necessary. These commands are usually hotkeyed as /pet attack and /pet back off. The hotkeys may be programmed (re-mapped) to operate from different keys to the bards liking, through the Keyboard Options menu in the game interface. My /pet attack macro on my hotkey bank for Charm Kiting is also set to the 0 key as I use the number pad to move in the game, for example. Essentially, the pattern of attack is as follows:<BR><BR>{target desired pet &gt; Siren Song &gt; target desired mob &gt; /pet attack &gt; retarget &#8216;pet&#8217; &gt; reapply Siren Song when it breaks &gt; target desired mob &gt; /pet attack &gt; retarget &#8216;pet &gt; reapply Siren Song, or Chant down if appropriate &gt; repeat} <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Notes:</EM></STRONG> Many guides on <A href="http://www.eqdiva.com/">www.eqdiva.com</A> cover this technique so only the basics will be covered here. Understand, however, that being adept and familiar with kite strategies and patterns discussed here will enhance your effectiveness when you begin to employ the terror that is Charm Kiting. Finally, while Solon&#8217;s Song of Sirens is a viable Charm Kite tool, a bard receives Solon&#8217;s Bewitching Bravura at 39. While this is a much more successful charm tool, in terms of resists, it now consumes <EM><STRONG>60 mana</STRONG></EM> on attempts, yuck, while lasting a full 60 second duration, and may quickly run down a bard&#8217;s mana pool during use. <BR><BR>Additionally, Solon&#8217;s 27 will not work on level 37 and above mobs, while Solon&#8217;s 39 will not work on level 51 and above mobs. The bard ability HIDE or the Invisibility Song (19), Selo's Song of Travel (51), or a hotkeyed, clickable invisibility item (Tiny Cloak of Darkest Night for example) will &#8216;break&#8217; the charmed mob if the bard determines that it can no longer sustain damage. Pets that are killed &#8216;poof&#8217; and do not provide experience to the bard kiter. Also, a bard my assist his &#8216;pet&#8217; by applying Chants to the target or &#8216;chaining&#8217; the target as appropriate. The trick here is to be able to assist your pet and re-target him before the charm wears off or is broken. Practice makes perfect.<BR><BR><STRONG><EM>NOTE:</EM></STRONG> Due to the changes with Solon's Bewitching Bravura (39), in terms of its now <EM>significant</EM> 60 mana requirement per attempt, its is now widely suggested by experienced bards across Norrath that a kiter using the charm techniques described herein obtain either a) and item with Flowing Thought, or b) AAXP point in Mental Clarity in order to regen mana as quickly as possible.<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Swarm Kiting</STRONG> &#8211; A variation on Charm Kiting, swarm kiting is the most devastating and difficult form of bard kiting. The procedures for Swarm Kiting are essentially the same for Charm Kiting except that the number of mobs increases dramatically. In Swarm Kiting, the bard will attempt to pull as many mobs as possible into the pattern. There he will &#8216;charm&#8217; one mob and make it his servant, send it to attack the other mobs in the pattern, assist where necessary, evaluate the relative health of his pet, reapply charm if needed and re-send to attack, and finally Chant Kite the former pet to death, thanking the other mobs following for doing all the brute work. <BR><BR>Today's Swarm Kiting alllows for any number of mobs to be engaged and eventually destroyed. Understand that recently the maximum number of mobs that will 'swarm' on a bard's pet has been changed and is no longer the requisite 4 mobs that many of us became familiar with. As of this writing, any number of mobs will engage a Bard's charmed pet and proceed to beat it down. This does, however, provide for some increased attention that the bard must pay to the health status of his or her pet in action. If the swarm of mobs kills your pet, you will receive no experience from the encounter. <BR><BR>The keys for this technique lies in the ability to of the bard to employ effective patterns, target and retarget mobs, avoid being hit/stunned by mobs following in the pattern, assessing a pet's health status, and determine when to stop charming/break charm and then Chant Kite the former pet, or associated mob, to death. The progression in a Swarm Kite is as follows:<BR><BR>[{Selo&#8217;s/Sow (hopefully 49 Selo's Accelerating Chorus SAC) &gt; target desired pet &gt; Solons Bravura &gt; target desired mob &gt; /pet attack &gt; remain targeted on pet, or switch to better pet &gt; re-charm, or Chant Kite to death as appropriate}]<BR><BR>Re-targeting your pet is fairly simple by employing the Tab Buffer method discussed in EQDiva in various guides. The <STRONG><U>basics</U></STRONG> are as follows:</LI></OL>
<UL>
<LI>target mob/pet 
<LI>hit tab, charm 
<LI>target desired mob 
<LI>hit /pet attack hotkey 
<LI>target self (F1) 
<LI>hit tab to re-target pet (using the tab buffer technique)<BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Note:</EM></STRONG> This is all conducted as the bard is running a kite pattern around the group of enraged mobs. Also note that if you switch pets, the one you previously had charmed will almost always follow you regardless of what your new pet is doing. Charm songs and spells really generate aggro in EQ. This can be to your advantage though&#8230; Finally, and this is very important, when Swarm Kiting, and while your pet is engaged, it may be beneficial for a bard to twist in Hymn if he/she has taken damage. With the 4 mob swarm limit removed, bards are now finding more time to actually stand in one place rather than continuing to run the kite patter. Remember though, once a charm breaks, that former pet will want your throat more than anything, will follow you almost exclusively to get at it, that is until you recharm the beast. =)<BR><BR>Remember: pay close attention to your pet's health status, lifting the 4 mob swarm limit is now assuring that your pet will decrease in hp much faster than in the old style of swarm kiting. Outside of that, the tactics remain the same.</LI></UL>
<H3>Now for the Critical Elements</H3>
<P><STRONG>Strategy</STRONG> - A kiting strategy will allow you effectively employ your skills against multiple mobs, allow for quick advancement on the kite learning curve, and provide for a familiarity that will enable you to adapt whenever needed. I&#8217;m going to look closer on these kite strategies, or kite patterns, here in a minute. But understanding and implementing a good strategy will be half the battle. This guide attempts to provide you with the tools for a good strategy.</P>
<P><STRONG>Timing</STRONG> - Without a doubt, timing is the critical element in the kite process. You may have a good kite pattern and strategy, but if your timing is off you&#8217;re not going to be too successful. Again, timing is a learning curve that you can advance on very quickly if you pay attention and practice. Learn at what position in the pattern the mobs need to be, not only to cast the AE/Chant/etc but to land the song. We will look at this in a min, but realize the distinct importance of this element to all kiters.</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Note:</EM></STRONG> later when your able to run at a highly accelerated rate, timing will still be important in order for you to maintain accurate assessment of you pet, and your pet's target's, health bars. In addition, if you outrun your swarm theyll simply stop and eventually return to their points, so it always remains important for bard's to keep timing in mind.</P>
<P><STRONG>Connection</STRONG> - whoever said lag=dead bard was pretty much right on the money in terms of kiting. If your connection is poor, you experience tons of lag, or your swap file on your hard drive burns off every now and then, causing the framerate to decrease/system to hang/or freeze up, kiting will be very dangerous. This, of course, plays right into the element of timing as such events will throw you timing wayyyy off. Bad jojo.</P>
<P><STRONG>Skills</STRONG> - Again, kiting is a skill that takes time and practice. But I&#8217;m talking about the skills of understanding your class and your songs. Know how much that DDD/Fufils/Chant is doing per tick at your level, for example. How much does it increase with that Walrus Skin Drum, etc. And what if you upgraded to a Selos Drum? Hmmm. Know when that Selo&#8217;s Accelerating Chorus is going to drop and have the timing skill down to twist it in before it goes down. Realize that your AE songs such as DDD and Chords will only strike a maximum of 4 mobs, while your Chants are targeted to a single mob. You get the point, a greater understanding of your songs will provide you with greater confidence as you approach the solo kite. </P>
<P><STRONG>Mobs</STRONG> - Pay attention to the mobs you will be engaging in a kite. How fast do they run, how do they react when they are below 30% health or so, do they run or are they mindless (say normal mob vs. undead mob)? Do they cast (root is bad), are they heavy stunners, what is the relative aggro range for the mob? Knowing your mob helps tremendously as you progress on the kite learning curve, and not all mobs react the same. Take the time to figure it out.</P>
<P><STRONG>Set up</STRONG> - Figure out the best hotkey, and hotbank, configuration for you and become very familiar with it. Knowing how you have placed your spells keys etc will become critical as you spend most of your time running the patterns and calculating the timing for spells casts and spell hits. I know bards are the masters of hotkey/hotbank familiarity so I won&#8217;t belabor the point, but go with what is familiar and comfortable for you. You may chose to reprogram you camera angle adjustment key, F9, to be collocated on your keyboard (mine is the N key), or you may want to re-map your /pet attack key so that it has closer proximity to your finger placement. Some examples of hotbank setups are provided below.</P>
<P><STRONG>Twist</STRONG> - In the same vein as the set-up, a bard must be able to twist the songs in order to effectively kite. I suppose a 2 twist approach would work (DDD and Selos), but adding in the level 2 Chords moves the process along faster and is resisted less, this for the below 30 bard for example. Again, a Flame and Frost 2 Chant twist might work, but tossing in that Fufil&#8217;s will add increased damage and debuff the target&#8217;s magic resistance. Then again, maybe you want to toss Fulfil's and go for a full-on 3 or 4 Chant Kite? We&#8217;re looking at maximizing our efficiency and effectiveness here. Possible twist combinations were indicated in the definition section above.</P>
<P><STRONG>View</STRONG> - As a bard kiter, the camera view you use will be critical to your success. I use the &#8216;3rd and 4th camera angles when I kite (striking my re-mapped camera hotkey 3 and 4 times as necessary). For both angles, I adjust the view to be the farthest away (from my toon), then reduce the distance to about halfway, or so, location dependent. Additionally, I elevate the camera as far up as possible, that is, above my toon, and shift the view so that I see myself from the left-rear side, say about 8 o'clock for Angle 3, and at about 2 o&#8217;clock for Angle 4. </P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Note:</EM></STRONG> With the added camera angles you'll have to sort out what is best for you and be able to rapidly and efficiently scroll through the camera settings. The final rear shot in the angle array does very little for me in the kite.</P>
<P>This allows me to have a wide view angle, and also allows me (imho) the best view angle to set up and execute my kite patterns. These views may vary by terrain, and I use the &#8216;3rd and 4th angles&#8217; so that I might see all that is around me, switching when I need to. The point is, figure out what works for you best, but try your adjustments on green mobs first. Learn and use the multiple camera views and adjust them as needed, but become familiar with one or two angles so that it becomes very natural to play in those modes. </P>
<P>Finally, know exactly how many times to hit your key to switch camera angles without thinking about it. Just play around with the camera views until your familiar with the adjustment keys and comfortable with the multiple angles required. All key adjustments to multiple camera angles, zooming, and elevation are listed on the play card you should have received with the game. Basically, the Camera Toggle key is F9. The Zoom In key is the 7 on your num pad, while the Zoom Out is the 1 on your num pad. To rotate the camera left or right, you would utilize the Alt key in combination with the left and right arrow keys. To pan up and down in angle, utilize the 9 key for angle up, and the 3 key for angle down on your num pad. Try it out a few times and become comfortable with the switches and the adjustments.</P>
<P>Here is an example of how one of these angles (the one I kite in normally) might appear in-game. Yours may vary depending on what you are comfortable with (zoomed in, decreased elevation, etc).</P>
<P><STRONG>Angle 3.</STRONG></P>

<P><BR><STRONG>Hotkey Set-ups</STRONG> (examples)</P>

<H3>KITE PATTERNS:</H3>
<P>Ok, what is most important to note about these kite patterns is something called the RELEASE POINT (we'll call RP). Now, the RP is TWO THINGS:</P>
<P>A. The EXACT time you 'release' your song on the mob, which coincides with - </P>
<P>B. The moment you 'release' from the pattern away from the mob and begin to set up for the next round.</P>
<P>** The Release Point is they most important element about AE kiting as it determines IF you song hits based on its effective radius, and IF the mobs strikes you because you are in their melee radius. Later, as your bard run speed increases, the release point for Chants becomes less significant, true, but it is an important element of your skill that you should recognize and maintain, as its a helpful tool when you are chanting down mobs with a huge hit radius and dont want to get too close.</P>
<P>**Additionally, mobs follow an equation, in my experience, that forces them to path in a kite following the shortest distance rule, i.e., straight line. You can use this to your advantage because it will allow you the ability to set up the release point (RP) at the moment when the mobs are closest. You will see what I mean in the kite patterns below.</P>
<P><BR>Now, lets look at the first pattern to get a better idea of this whole kite process, the Release Point, and the straight-line approach of the mobs. At this point Ill assume you know how to get the mobs and group them by running around them in a large circle until they are fairly tightly grouped. This is not difficult and Selos allows you to do it quite easily, but it is important for the overall control of the kite pattern, and it becomes very critical when you graduate to Swarm Kiting!</P>
<P>To understand these chalkboards, start in the lower left-hand corner of each kite pattern image, at position Number 1, and work your way counter-clockwise around the image, following the progression and positioning of the kiting bard and his or her mobs. A by-the-numbers description is provided for each number of the kite pattern image, and you should be attempting to visualize the kite maneuver in your head as you walk through these examples.</P>
<P>The bard will always be the blue dot, while the mobs in the kite will always be the red dots. The corresponding colored directional arrows are included to help you 'visualize' the direction of travel (ie. the kite), and get an overall sense of the pattern we are discussing.</P>
<P>There is a learning curve involved with every style of kiting for every class, but what I attempt to do here is diagram the various approaches out for you on paper before you actually attempt to do them on the ground.</P>Let&#8217;s call the first one: <STRONG>Time to Make the Donuts</STRONG> 
<P><IMG height=300 src="/images/userdefined/donuts.jpg" width=400 border=0></P>
<P>And now, the animated gif sequence:</P>
<P><IMG height=200 src="/images/userdefined/donuts.gif" width=200 border=0></P>
<OL>
<LI>Bardie is beginning to enter into his/her first donut turn with the mobs following behind, Selos (without drum for Target/AE kiting, or drummed for Chant Kiting) is in effect, and bases the next AE/Chant/etc he/she will sing on the last one placed. For example, he/she prepares to hit with DDD because on the last donut he/she hit with CoD (see song sequence above), if using AE Kiting. 
<LI>Critical point as Bardie begins to sing the AE song and turns his/her donut nearly 180 degrees from the starting direction. The mobs, following a rough straight line to the Bardie are tightly grouped and following through a series of 'slow down points' or staggers which helps with your timing.<BR><BR>(There used to be this game with plastic shotguns and a projector that would 'project' a Skeet Target up on your wall - for those who know what Skeet or Trap Shooting is - and you would try to 'hit' the dot of light with your shotgun's light pattern burst when you fired. The thing is, the projected Skeet Target would make a rough triangle and at the corners, as it was trying to enter into a Straight Line, it would somewhat slow down. As children we learned to 'shoot' at the target when it hit these slowdowns on the corner as it attempted to enter into the straight aways.) I use this approach with the mobs when trying to determine and time the Release Point of my songs.<BR>
<LI>Bardie has timed the song to 'be released' at the point on the donut that enables him/her to hit most of the mobs and also allows him/her to 'release' from the kite pattern safely as they begin to set up for the next donut.<BR>
<LI>Bardie cast Selos as a follow up and begins to set for the next Release Point.</LI></OL>
<P>Making the donuts, along with Square Dancing, is probably the most well-known and basic of all the kite patterns for bards and non-bards. IMHO bards do it best and with the most control. The key here is practicing the placement of the Release Point to coincide with the point where the mobs have somewhat slowed in their attempt to reach the Bardie on the straight line, but are still within the song's radius of effect. Once the song hits, the Bardie must follow the second component of the Release Point and 'release' himself/herself from the pattern to begin anew. With time you wont even have to do much of a release<BR>but will be able to continue looping and laying on the tunes.</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>NOTE:</EM></STRONG> Bards that begin to employ Chant Kiting with Fufil&#8217;s, Flame, and Frost etc. will notice a reduced need to pay attention to the Release Point discussed above because the range (200 feet) on these songs is considerable, providing for continued circles around the mob or mob swarm in question. Additionally, as a bard levels the speed of Selos will increase, allowing the bard to maintain greater distance and control between their position and the positions of the mobs in the kite. But it is helpful to know the basic patterns early in your career.&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Let's look at Square Dancing</STRONG></P>
<P><IMG height=300 src="/images/userdefined/square.jpg" width=400 border=0></P>
<P><BR>And now, the animated gif sequence:</P>
<P><IMG height=200 src="/images/userdefined/square.gif" width=200 border=0></P>
<OL>
<LI>Bardie is setting up the kite pattern in a similar fashion to making the donuts and planning out his/her release point of the song. 
<LI>Bardie begins to sing the song, preparing to lay it on the mobs following the 90 degree turn in the square that allows for the time when the straight-line mobs to get close but out of melee range. 
<LI>Bardie times the release point perfectly to when the mobs are somewhat staggered on the corner following. The run Release Point for this pattern is on the straightaway when Bardie hits Selos. 
<LI>Bardie begins to time the next corner of the square and to place the Release Point of the song at the point when the mobs are closest.</LI></OL>
<P>*Careful with the Square Dance as the mob distance may be difficult to judge on the corners and too slow of a cornering will allow the mobs to strike you as they strictly follow the straight-line.</P>
<P>Lets look at one of the harder patterns and one I find myself using typically after I have 'released' from a donut pattern and the setup is perfect for this technique in order to add on a quick slap of notes.</P>
<P><STRONG>Eat My Dust</STRONG></P>
<P><IMG height=300 src="/images/userdefined/dust.jpg" width=400 border=0></P>
<P>And now, the animated gif sequence:</P>
<P><IMG height=200 src="/images/userdefined/dust1.gif" width=200 border=0></P>
<P><BR>1. Again, Bardie is kiting the mob preparing to enter his/her pattern OR just being released from his/her pattern (this is where I usually use this). Bardie is looking at the timing and feels that Eat My Dust will time perfectly with the mobs' position.</P>
<P>2. Bardie begins to sing (based on last one landed as above) and times the song release for the next loop in front of the mobs.</P>
<P>3 - 4. Bardie loops back in front of the mobs and releases the song and himself/herself from the pattern.</P>
<P>*This is a difficult pattern to get down, but allows the bard to release the song while kiting in somewhat of a straight line. This has its advantages if the bard does not want to loop or square because of another wandering mob that may join in the race. Again, this takes timing and practice to perfect, and can often place you in hit range of the mobs. I&#8217;ve found it to be most effective following the completion of a donut and the mob placement and timing is just right to lay on another song and then release from the pattern. Again, your looking at the slowing or staggering of the mobs trying to follow the straight-line to time you song release.</P>
<P><STRONG>A few quick notes</STRONG></P>
<P>1. As a general rule, and if not Swarm Kiting, try to kite around 4 mobs. Less than 4 wont maximize your effort, while more than 4 will increase the difficulty in completing a full pattern as several like to wander off but remain in the pattern area and jump back in when you least want them too, like when you have hit the Release Point. Additionally, mobs follow a straight-line approach to their bard target, but if they cannot reach you there is often a warp phenomenon that is dangerous and irritating. You will see this occur when the mob in question, being far behind you thanks to Selos, will instantly leap across the pattern on the straight line and assault you. Outside of potential stuns, its relatively harmless although extremely irritating. Lag can increase this in my experience.</P>
<P>As your skill grows you can easily increase the amount of mobs trailing you in the swarm from manageable to insane levels. Okay, yeah, we bards have a bit of the showoff in us...</P>
<P>2. Try and keep all the mobs of the same type in the pattern because 'runner' mobs will not begin to run when their life goes below 30% or so if there are others of their type in the kite. I don&#8217;t know, they don&#8217;t want to embarrass themselves or something. Some mobs will never run, like undead.</P>
<P>3. On multiple one-type mob runners: Often, even if you have multiple mobs of the same, errr, species, you will have those that will run off. Some you can round up again by passing the aggro kite by them (think of looping an invisible kite string over then to tie them back into the pattern), some you cannot. I think bards are going to have to identify this and figure out which mobs behave in what manner. I wanted to kind of indicate this in the Know Your Mobs critical section. However, if the mob is near death and wont come back in the pattern, I generally ignore the mobs currently in the kite and adjust my pattern to apply as many pulses of song necessary to kill the straggler. Then, just return to business on the followers.</P>
<P>5. On instrument twists during AE kiting. Now, often you may be in an area where there are just too many mobs to safely twist songs and manipulate the instrument twists. FOR GENERAL purposes, kiting can be done very well without an instrument twist, and, obviously, even better with one. Go with what is comfortable for you.</P>
<P>6. If you cant keep the mob from running off when his hp are low, just ignore those you are pulling on the kite string, and time your song releases to coincide with your passes of the runner mob. Take him out first by doing wide loops and passing just by him on the release of the song. Takes a little timing but not hard (twist in Hymn if needed on a break)</P>
<P>7. There are times when I need a two step edge or more on the mobs because Ive:</P>
<P>a. looped my path too close<BR>b. got hit by lag, etc<BR>c. heard my stupid hard drive kick in for a file swap<BR>d. lost my Selos due to losing the twist sequence, missed notes, whatever<BR>e. or most often, received an irrational tell from my friend that makes me spit out coffee and lose my concentration...</P>
<P>At these times I will loop the mobs AROUND an inanimate object such as a tree, a rock, a house, etc. This always gives me a few extra seconds as the goofy mobs tumble over each other trying to get to me around the object. It works and makes sense, and once Im done I just set off on another round of the pattern.</P>
<P>8. Make sure you twist in your other spells if needed such as Hymn if you&#8217;ve taken too much damage, or Jaxan&#8217;s Jig if your stamina bar is running low because your encumbered.</P>
<P>9. If Selos is going down, hit jump while you re-fire it up to stay ahead of the baddies.</P>
<P>10. If you loose track of your song sequence, hit Selos first to reestablish the pattern, the mob will only live a few seconds longer without that extra AE or Chant twist.</P>
<P>11. If hit and stunned, keep the num lock on to auto run and hit jump until you jump away and begin running again.</P>
<P>12. On BBB and CoD. These are definite viable twist songs for kiting at low level. While they have their limitations (BBB is single target in nature, CoD has a low effect radius) they are still effective learning tools in order to:</P>
<P>a. practice up for Chant/AE kiting, in terms of practicing the ranges, patterns, and camera angles. BBB may be slow, but it is effective and is a big assist when pulling a mob.</P>
<P>b. While it doesn&#8217;t give me a HUGE damage bonus, for lower level bards Chords it is still laying on the notes to all mobs within the kite radius. Damage efficiency compared to time is what I&#8217;m talking about here for lower level bards. Chords also has a lower resist rate when compared to BBB for bards below level 18 when DDD comes into play. Now, I think that if you practice the patterns and get very familiar with them, your surroundings, your camera view, and your mobs relative to your speed, you will find that you can lay on CoD very effectively.</P>
<P>The point is, both are effective learning tools for the considerable skills the bard kiter will need at later levels, whether doing Chant Kites or Swarm Kites, charm or otherwise. </P>
<P>13. Last but certainly not least <STRONG><U>get the best damned drum you can find, period</U></STRONG>.</P>
<P>Hmm, that&#8217;s all I can think of now, but I&#8217;m sure we'll find more to discuss here, and Ill be updating this occasionally. If I&#8217;ve forgotten anything, please forgive me, as the bard world we live in changes daily. =)</P>
