<b>Level and mez - </b>12/14/01 3:33:06 AM<br>~ <b>Teendream</b><blockquote>I really hope the 28 pixie strike works well because this song has already outlived it usefulness. Resist rates at level 27 are around 95%, so all it really ever accomplishes is getting me killed, no longer ever memmed obvisously. BTW CHA is 119 so maybe thats the problem but my CHA is gonna go up anytime soon, I have limited resources and higher priorities for gear than CHA stuff.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Usefulness is Level Based - </b>12/12/01 12:00:26 PM<br>~ <b>Kalypsa</b><blockquote>In my experience, the usefulness of this song truly is level-based.  Prior to around 35ish, this spell hardly ever left my bar, it was incredibly useful and saved my parties several times.  But as you get higher, you will find that resists dramatically increase and this song decreases in its usefulness.  I last used it successfully when I was in my mid-40s and I got resists probably about 75% of the time (but the 25% success rate sqeaked us through alive).  I've tested it in some of the low 50s dungeons where I have been fighting and it barely sticks, ever, even against mobs I can stick Pixie Strike to.<br><br>The sense I seem to get from what VI has said about Bards and crowd control is that they never wanted us to interfere with the enchanters, and AE mesmerize, as you can see in the lower levels, is amazingly powerful.  So while they stay master of AE mez, we stay at least competitive with single target charm and crowd control .. and with our awesome lull ability to single pull.<br><br>Bottom line, use this a LOT in the lower levels, and enjoy the power while you have it.  :)</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Handy - </b>11/28/01 5:57:22 PM<br>~ <b>Antonin Devorak</b><blockquote>It seems inevadable when I'm in a fort group that at some point be it a train, over pull or whatever we will be overrun.  I find that when this happens (when no chanter is there) I can do more good with my mandolin using ONLY this song than I can with my swords twisting other stuff.  Even if it fails, just keep recasting it, and eventually it will hold.  Granted you will get smacked now and again, but this buys time.  Bards aren't tanks, however we can take more of a beating than a druid or shamen.  Better to keep your healers alive, atleast you have a chance then.  More often than not with a solid group you and your party will get out alive and with  bunch of xp to boot.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>song at higher levels. - </b>11/26/01 1:02:48 AM<br>~ <b>Larrycor</b><blockquote>/cheer menaka<br><br>at 40+ this song is worthless.<br>at 54, I see greens resist this constantly.<br>granted, I only have 143 cha. But I try for more sta/hp than cha whenever possiable.<br><br>This song to me is level based.<br>At lower levels this would work great.<br></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>When was the nerf, and how bad? - </b>11/23/01 4:28:07 PM<br>~ <b>Kesha</b><blockquote>At castersrealm, it sounds as though this song was nerfed from overpowered to useless.  Is that correct, and if so, when did it happen?<br><br>My own experience with it is 100% resist on orcs in HH at 15, albeit out of only a few tries, and I managed to mez one orc for one tick at 16 or 17.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b> - </b>11/18/01 11:04:03 PM<br>~ <b>Wankarana</b><blockquote>was fighting at lakeoiimen as 22 bard, group overpulled...7 mobs(all con blue to me)if i remembered right. More than 4 of them got mezzed and our group survived with just 4 of us, one warrior, rogue, me and one cleric. Really like this song, tho you will get it resisted more when mez higher lvl mobs.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>BAH - </b>11/12/01 1:08:51 PM<br>~ <b>ME</b><blockquote>This song is GREAT....when it is not resisted and it gets resisted often i am a lvl 15 with a 99 CHA and i went to newbie are in kelethin and tried to mez lvl 1 monsters most of the time they resisted it.Yes it does work too but creates mad aggro when it wears off and when it failes to work u get screwed anyway stick to other spells get a chanter in your grp and let them do themezzing they are much better at it anyway.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Bard Taunt - </b>11/11/01 10:51:05 PM<br>~ <b>Bellosard Harpysong</b><blockquote>don't know much what to think about this song...<br>i don't use it much since the few times i have used it, it only worked half of the time.  i would love to use it more, but it doesn't seem that reliable.  i read from posts and hear alot and some say it works like a charm and some say it is a waste of cash.  i don't know how high your charisma has to be or whether you need a magic lute for it, but seeing as i am only of my 21st song, i wont be seeing significant stat increases or magic instruments for awhile....<br><br>what i do know however this song does come in handy for saving many a life.  my general rule of thumby while hunting is that if i go below 2 bubs of life, i kick on the run song and head for zone or run around twisting hymn and try to assemble a back up plan.  but in parties, coordination of this is poor.  first, ppl don't know what all bards can do.  second, even if they do, they panic and forget real quick.  and third, even if they are smart and prepared, and you do notify them of your gameplan on running, sometimes they straggle off, falling out of range of your song and into the waiting arms of ticked off mobs.  however with this song, you do not have to worry about depending on others in this situation.  just inform the party, that when the time and situation comes, to turn off attack and you will handle the rest.  kick on this song,  let them agro, and then bring it to zone :)<br><br>p.s.  you might want to make a TRAIN! button ;)</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>This song is the best! - </b>11/2/01 9:36:38 AM<br>~ <b>Menaka</b><blockquote>I have this song memmed all the time.  Anyone who says this song is a joke doesn't understand what mobs are resistant to what!  I have a 19th level bard that is my alt, my main being a 55th wizard; and I can easily mezz an orc camp in the oasis and solo or duo the camp even if they are yellow.  <br><br>End of story!</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>4 targets ya right! - </b>10/28/01 5:39:15 AM<br>~ <b>Mulamasi</b><blockquote>This is a point blank AE MEZ, meaning quite simply as many mobs that can get packed into the area of effect is the limit to how many who can be mezzed.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Great Song, What's wrong? - </b>10/26/01 9:50:17 PM<br>~ <b>illuvaten</b><blockquote>This song is very useful.  But you must make the people in your group understand it doesn't work 100% of the time, and when it is over, they are going to attack the bard!  Great for crowd control, though.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>This is weird - </b>10/24/01 8:21:55 PM<br>~ <b>-Tuleden-</b><blockquote>Well. You guys say that you can't mez for crap.. well i was at  90 charisma when i got this song at lvl 15 in oaisis. My friend over pulled .. and i played the sing even without the mandolin.. it mezed  2 of the caimen and kept them mezed..

<b>Hrmm... - </b>7/22/01 1:21:11 PM<br>~ <b>Mixx</b><blockquote>Not to take away from any of you 'seasoned' bards out there .. but every bard i've ever hunted w/in the high end use this spell to mez mobs better than most chanters i've hunted with. <br><br>I can not believe you all consider this such a poor spell.

<b>Great in Highhold Pass - </b>7/13/01 5:30:01 PM<br>~ <b>Smegley</b><blockquote>Whether soloing or grouping, this song rules when faced with numerous opponents.  I'm only level 19, so what an earlier post said about this being resisted at higher levels may be true.  If you're in an *experienced* group of players (not characters), that know what they're doing, this song makes taking on groups or orcs or gnolls a piece of cake.<br><br>One warning.  Make sure you have tanks that can taunt well.  Because if they can't, or just don't notice it, as soon as a mob wakes up, it's coming after YOU.  I died once when that happened.  Everyone else had almost a full bar of health at when I kicked it.  That's why it's good to group with people that know what they're doing.  Everybody needs to know what you're doing before hand.  That way they don't each attack a separate mob and wake them all up to attack you.  So get ready to zone then disband if your groupmates are bumbling incomps.  </blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>Wonderful song... - </b>5/2/01 8:26:07 AM<br>~ <b>Bolil</b><blockquote>Just make sure your group knows what you are doing :)  Tell them over and over and over until they get it straight :)  Always /assist on the puller, always let the puller pick the next target once the first falls, then /assist again.<br><br>When I just got the song, I was fighting gnolls in East Karana.  The biggest problem I had was trying to get the group to coordinate their attacks when we had 3 or 4 gnolls on us :)  An overactive Warrior in the group kept attacking one of the additional gnolls, which would then aggro on me and backhand me upside the head :)  But after about 15 minutes, I had the fellow with an /assist hotkey, and the whole group was doing much better!  I can imagine how an Enchanter feels in this situation...at least I've got the AC and hitpoints to absorb some damage :)<br><br>In Santana mode (Mandolin equipped), it seemed that the song was a lot more effective.  Maybe it's subjective, but it seemed that the mesmerization failed a lot less, and that silly second resist also failed a lot less.  By twisting in a healing song, we were tearing through packs of gnolls at an alarming rate :)<br><br>Well, happy strumming all!<br><br>Bolil the Boy Bard<br><br></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>It definitely does more than four. - </b>4/30/01 8:10:10 PM<br>~ <b>Morrilin</b><blockquote>This song is a *must* if you don't have an enchanter, especially if you don't have a puller who can reliably single pull, like an overzealous ranger friend of mine.  The most difficult part is once the mobs all turn on you, it takes a full pulse from singing to the mez effect, during which they're all aggro on you, and a stun means you start over again.  But, last night I did briefly have 8 out of 8 dazed goblins out for the count in Runnyeye, so it can be done.  However, if you're wielding weapons instead of instruments (which seems less and less like the wise course every time I think about it) don't bother.  All this is then is a tauntsong.  Stick with Bellow and some buffs if you like your stickypokes.
