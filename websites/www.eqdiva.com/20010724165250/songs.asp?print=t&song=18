<b>You dont need a target to raise brass. - </b>5/16/01 12:29:11 PM<br>~ <b>Bahab</b><blockquote>Just like most of your other songs (bar ones that need a target), just playing them causes you to get better at it eventualy.<br><br>Some things I would point out to the novice bard,  try and find a newbie zone to do this, seeing that there are only two things in the zone that can kill you ... Guards, and NPC merchants (which are in almost every newbie zone I can think off).<br><br>So you might not want to go too far from your little bard, as I have personaly witnessed someone training guards into my radius trying to kill me (luckly I was actualy at my computer and saw him comming :D)</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Exact dmg? - </b>5/5/01 1:26:38 PM<br>~ <b>KinvaS</b><blockquote>Can we try and get an exact dmg? I mean whats 20+ suppose to mean....thanks<br><br><i>Kocho ~ Area effect songs are a bit hard to measure. But the damage I had was meant per tick (every 6 seconds). It also does damage with and without horn. I took this damage information from a variety of sources, I should probably duel someone, test how much damage it does them, then multiply by 1.33 to compensate for PvE damage, then post it here.</i></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Range of DDD - </b>5/1/01 5:18:39 PM<br>~ <b>Kembas</b><blockquote>To the above post, I haven't noticed any problems with the range. The other night I was in SK fighting gnolls and was twisting this in with Largo's and Anthem. I was standing pretty far back too. Did not have the horn equipped either. Ah well... could just be your server.<br><br>Kembas, 25th season bard<br>Tholuxe Paells<br></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Range of this song is very short - </b>4/17/01 12:35:43 PM<br>~ <b>Tinvaran</b><blockquote>Don't know if the range on this song has been nerfed or what, but at level 37, before I had Tuyen's<br>Chant of Flame, I wa trying to twist this with Fufil's and Chainsong while doing Drolvargs in Firiona<br>Vie Zone in Kunark. I found that there was about a 3 pixel range (i.e. max 1-2 steps) within which<br>I could use this song and see the &quot;winces&quot; message, and not get munched by melee from the Mob.<br>Outside this range, the song would not affect (or did not appear to affect) the Mob at all. This <br>is due in part, of course to the absurd melee range which Verant has put on many of these Mobs,<br>as Drolvargs can hit you in melee combat from an apparent range of over 50 feet. Because of this<br>range problem, I rated this song very poorly. <br><br><br>Tinvaran, Level 40 Bard of Tarew Marr<br></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Raising Brass skill - </b>4/17/01 12:21:14 PM<br>~ <b>Tinvaran</b><blockquote>Two areas which I have used to raise this skill are:<br><br>[1]. Far wall of the room off the tunnel between EC and NRo, where the Shady Swashbuckler hangs<br>out. Never practised here completely unattended, in case some moron trained me for a joke. Did<br>however leave the computer for short breaks, or watch TV while doing this.<br><br>[2.] Went to Arena, where some guild was having an evening's fun...let the leader know what I<br>was doing (practising Brass skill) so players wouldn't think I was trying to attack them ;-)<br>Stood just inside the zone, NOT near the arena itself, then I turned on the Brass, and went to<br>bed. Got up next morning, skill had gone from 123 to about 165. Learn while you dream ;-)<br><br>If you happen to go LD instead, it's not a big loss ;-) Just repeat the next time you're in the area.<br><br>Tinvaran, Level 40 Bard of Tarew Marr</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Damage w/out instrument - </b>3/26/01 2:13:13 PM<br>~ <b>Kocho Divah</b><blockquote>Yes, it does damage without instrument as well, just not as much. It is tough to measure the amount of damage it does to the mobs. If anyone has any data regarding this, contact me and I'll add it to the formula. Right now, I looked at eqsongs analysis, Sylva's Song Damage chart and a few other websites and came up with this formula...<br><br>I can enter a PvP area and test it out on one of my other characters, but PvP damage is not as much as PvE (player versus environment). Then you have to add in other factors like ac, level difference, and resistances...<br><br>So any help on these would be appreciated.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>I am confused - </b>3/26/01 10:21:31 AM<br>~ <b>Dubwen</b><blockquote>Hello all, I just got this song and it seems I am killing the same critters quicker with it.  However, I am confused.  This site shows the damage as +18 &quot;with instrument&quot;.  Does this song do damage without an instrument or are we required to twist the Brass into it when we use it.  Any comments will be appreciated.<br><br>Dubwen<br>Bard of the 18th Concerto<br>Undying Union<br>Fennin Ro</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Where I did it... - </b>2/17/01 4:15:17 AM<br>~ <b>KK</b><blockquote><br>I also was mistaken that you needed a target for this song,  I was missing notes SOO much that it was unusable.  SO I parked in an less inhabited part of the queynos newb area tagged myself AFK and let it go for an hour or so. Got about 20 pt's which was less than I had hoped for, but not all that bad really considering what a pain skill 20-50 is for most.<br><br>It was kinda funny having a pile of snakes, klicknicks and bats around me,  Eventually the newbs who weren't newbs found me and starting pulling djerr and flippy near  for free damage :) others kept looting all the corpses for reselling so they can buy leather/ spells or whatever, I found it pretty funny...<br><br>this song tears into mobs and I can't wait to have a high enough skill to use it in everyday combat :)</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>You don't need a target for increases - </b>2/5/01 1:26:19 PM<br>~ <b>Lyrak</b><blockquote>I can say for 100% sure that you do NOT need a target to increase brass skill with this song.  I just did it in an out of the way part of FV.  I started the song and walked away from the PC for about 3 hours.  My skill went from 25 to 78 in that time and I am sure that no one walked past me.  Just thought I would metion this.</blockquote></td></tr></table></blockquote><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href="/songs.asp?&song=18">Back to Normal Mode</a><br><br><br><i>Printed from EQDiva.com on 7/24/01 12:52:40 PM.</i><br><br></td></tr></table>
