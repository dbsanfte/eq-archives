Ok here is the skinny on the 4th quest for the Coldain Prayer Shawl series. 
<br><br>
I was wandering near Kael Drakkel searching for this guy after hearing that 
the quest had been implemented on live servers and low and behold I get this 
message: <BR>
"the snow crumbles away revealing an injured coldain" or something like that.
<br><br>I saw and exclaimed with great relish.. oh my thats the npc that im looking 
for!!! I was wandering near this location: <BR>NEG 6644 POS 4337 
<br><br>
I hailed him and he requested that I aid him, I of course replied in the 
affirmative and he replied to me that he required a Vial of Velium Vapors. </P>
<P>When I asked what a vial of velium vapors were.. he was disapointed that I 
didn't have any and that I should go see Frundle in Thurgadin to make some. </P>
<P>Frundle is a coldain lady in a small building near the library. When she is 
hailed and asked "What about the velium vapors?" she hands you a 4 slot 
container "Velium Purifier." </P>
<P>She then tells you that you require 3 things to make the vapors when combined 
in the purifier: <BR>1) Velium Vial <BR>2) Small piece of velium STACKABLE 
<BR>3) Small piece of velium STACKABLE </P>
<P>Not knowing how to make the velium vial I asked her what indeed this was... 
she replied that to make a velium vial I had to: <BR>1) Combine 3 crystalline 
silks, small brick of velium NON STACKABLE, 2 glass shards on the pottery wheel 
<BR>2) Combine result with high quality firing sheet in the kiln </P>
<P>I got all the materials required from spiders(silk) and orc miners (small 
bricks NON STACKABLE/small pieces of velium STACKABLE) in the crystal caverns in 
about 4 minuts.. lucky I guess. </P>
<P>Well the velium vial required Im guessing a good pottery skill.. I wouldnt 
know because I have 135 skill in pottery and it was trivial. </P>
<P>I created the vial and combined it in the purifier with the 2 small pieces of 
velium and I received: 
<br><br><BR>
