<b>Yes it stacks - </b>6/23/02 8:55:52 PM<br>~ <b>Tahmay</b><blockquote>This song is designed to augment what haste you already have.  Sort of like the Amplification built to augment singing skill.  Whatever haste you have on at the time you sing this will be upped by about, like it says already, 15%.  I've heard up to 25% on this number but in my experience it's closer to 15% than 25%.  So yes it stacks with Jonathans Provocation if you're soloing, the lvl 54 haste if you're grouped; and yes it stacks with SCHW + Jonathans if you're soloing.  I've done that myself and just watched from an alternate camera angle as I never stopped swinging :)<br><br>This is a great song.  Just don't use it if you don't have either a haste item or spell already on you.  It DOES slow you WAY, WAY down if you pull it up first.<br><br></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Got this song today and tested it - </b>6/20/02 11:03:47 PM<br>~ <b>Oral Dilemma</b><blockquote>What I can personally verify at this point in time from using the song myself is that:<br><br>1. This song does appear to stack (and of course boost) the shammy and chanter hastes that I have had on me. A previous  comment stating that it boosts the existing haste about 15% seems correct, and does seem to improve my own hastes when twisted with them, but once the primary haste drops I become a sloth!<br><br>2. It does seem to make a small increase when using a brass instrument.<br><br>3. If you currently have no haste or haste item it does seem to slow your attacks down a great deal, a great great deal.<br><br>4. yes it is certainly a group song, boo, lol.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Villa's & Battle Cry - </b>2/8/02 4:39:49 PM<br>~ <b>The Maestro</b><blockquote>I have seen both Villa's Chorus of Celerity and Battlecry of the Vah Shir stacked together. I'm not sure if it was because there were two Bards in the group, one who was playing Villa's and the other  playing Battlecry. Anyhow, for a while only Battlecry was being played (very small change in haste), then the other Bard started up Villa's and the hast increase jumped in a major way. Both icons are displayed in your buff window so I can only assume that the songs, in fact, do stack with each other. Maybe this is only possible when two Bards in the same group are playing each of the songs and not stackable if one Bard plays both songs themselves.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>So, what's the verdict? - </b>2/6/02 9:19:48 AM<br>~ <b>Fintle Vicious</b><blockquote>Hello all!<br><br>Does this song stack with our level 54 haste or VoV?  Can someone please provide an informed opinion on this?  Please no speculation :)  I haven't gotten around to grabbing this tune yet, but have been wildly interested.<br><br>Fintle Vicious<br>53 Minstrel (Bertox)</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Stacking Issue - </b>2/3/02 6:23:03 AM<br>~ <b>Eskimo Icewind</b><blockquote>Found out last night that it won't stack with Song of the Deep Seas, which is the proc off my Sirensong.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Problem w/ song - </b>1/31/02 3:47:04 AM<br>~ <b>Serick Nightsong</b><blockquote>Is anyone else having trouble with this song?  All it seems to do is REDUCE attack speed with my primary weapon.  The weird thing is that when I use Lute of the Howler to become a werewolf the songs seems to work just fine for me.  Group members have also noticed a problem with attack speed.<br><br>Serick Nightsong (Troubador, Solusek Ro)</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>You would think... - </b>1/24/02 7:27:03 AM<br>~ <b>Visidia</b><blockquote>You would think this song would stack with our Vilia's chorus of celerity...but of course it doesn't.  So you need a shammie or enchanter speed spell on you or a haste item.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Song tested - </b>1/23/02 1:30:54 PM<br>~ <b>Harpar Battlesong</b><blockquote>Tested the song and thru 10 trys of one minute  of attacking each try same target yada yada yada. This gave 15 percent additional haste plus or minus one percent each time. So the additional haste is 15%. Also until verant fixes the slow problem do not use this song unless you have a shammy or chanter also hasting. Or anytime you lag hiccup and your main group haste drops the party will actually be slowed.Also always play your grp/self haste first.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Question About Haste - </b>1/16/02 7:32:49 AM<br>~ <b>Liedchen</b><blockquote>Could anyone explain me the difference between ATK and the haste?<br><br>Some songs are listen &quot;This songs at xx point to attack speed&quot; other are shown as 30% haste.<br><br><i>Kocho ~ Haste is how fast you hit. Attack is how hard you hit, it will let you hit or exceed your max damage, and also increase your chance of hitting the mob.</i></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b> - </b>1/9/02 10:53:34 AM<br>~ <b>Splitzer</b><blockquote>Well, I used this song for the last 2 nights in a row and everybody liked it.  So it must be fixed.  No problems with it either.<br><br><i>Kocho ~ It will work fine as long as everyone has a haste item or spell already on. If not, then it is reported that they are actually slowed. Verant is working on it now.</i></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b> - </b>12/28/01 7:48:04 AM<br>~ <b>Areo Ayonae</b><blockquote>I was playing this with a group in Chardok and with experiments, we discovered what people are considering the bug of this song. If you have a haste item/spell on, it adds to the % of that haste. Buf if you have no haste item, it seems to slow your main hand weapon down dramatically. I cant figure out why Verant is more interested in fixing a beard graphic over the entire set of Bard luclin songs but I hope soon they decide what is more important in the world of Norrath and start working on our songs.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>End of Month and song still not fixed! - </b>12/24/01 3:06:04 PM<br>~ <b>Tinasaer</b><blockquote>We were in The Hole on Friday night when this song halted our melee while we were being pounded by the mobs.  It's a good thing I'm a fast thinker, and said:  &quot;hey wait a minute, something is wrong with my song&quot;.

<b>Still busted - </b>12/20/01 10:25:02 AM<br>~ <b>Fallanthas</b><blockquote>The song is still broken as of 12/19.  Someone at Verant forgot a plus sign.  Rather than the song adding 15% haste, it sets your base attack speed to 15% of whatever your current weapon delay is!!!!<br><br><br>I am anxiously awaiting this one.  <br><br><br>/petition!<br><br>/bug!<br><br>/rant!<br><br>/rave!</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>I became a cuisinart! - </b>12/17/01 12:52:21 PM<br>~ <b>Britnee Golightly</b><blockquote>I borrowed a pair of 21% haste gloves, played Provocation(45) and this new song... OMG.  81% haste! I  was demolishing mobs.  It sounded like I had installed a food processor in my PC.  The hits were coming so fast that I was getting dizzy. Using the above combo, an epic monk and I were slicing through Small Mushrooms in Fungus Grove like they weren't even there.<br><br>Twisting this song in with the lvl54 haste will pretty much mean no need for chanter haste......  OMG!<br></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Brass - </b>12/16/01 6:27:58 PM<br>~ <b>Lulen the bard</b><blockquote>ok, does anyone know what effect having a brass instrument equiped will do for this song?  Or even more importantly, what will not having a horn equiped do?</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Still broken but very valuable - </b>12/14/01 5:16:05 PM<br>~ <b>Azael Azureberry</b><blockquote>This song is still broken in that it completely stops your attacks if you have no other form of spell haste on you.  However it is still EXTREMELY useful, especially on small raids (1-3 groups) where you can buzz around the camp and add haste to everyone.  We owned everything in Umbral last night with 3 groups, each group able to take a mob at a time.

Hopefully, they will fix this bug soon, but I'm not holding my breath.<br><br>This song sung with one of the Jonathan's and a haste item can get you some sickeningly fast solo damage going.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>This song is very nice - </b>12/12/01 6:44:58 PM<br>~ <b>Kasreyn Giantharrow</b><blockquote>I've had this song since the day Luclin came out here (that's the day _after_ it came out in the States) and while it was broken then it was fixed by the time I used it again on the 11th.  I can't speak for the haste % as I've not done timings but I noticed an improvement in my speed (had enchanter spell haste and Sky belt) and a number of others in my guild did too.  The real beauty of this and the other AE songs is what two bards in a raid can suddenly do to counterpoint one another.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
