	Camp your weary feet a bit. Both mentally and physically, you are always alert, adapting to every situation. So set your lute down and let your fingers relax...<br><a href="/screenshots.asp?image=188"><img src="/images/screenshots/thumbs/imgThumb3.jpg" border="0" width="150" height="113" alt="EQDiva Screenshots" align="right" hspace="3" vspace="3"></a>
	<br>I am <b>Kocho Divah</b>, Bard of the 58th song. Why do I love the bard so passionately? Bards are hands-down the most fun and diverse characters. Tired of going OOM? Want the freedom to either solo or group? Feel like a little melee action? Want to buff the entire group ten-fold instantly? Need to fill a role your group is lacking? Not getting invites to dungeon or plane raids? Want to nearly eliminate downtime? Want to fly like the wind? Be a rockstar - be a <font color="#000066"><b>Bard</b></font>!<br><br>
	<b>Not a bard?</b> Don't leave yet! This site was initially designed for YOU in mind! Please enjoy your visit, and hopefully you will leave with a better understanding and sheer appreciation for the hard-working, multi-talented bard.<br><br><b>~ Kocho Divah, bard of the 58th song</b>
