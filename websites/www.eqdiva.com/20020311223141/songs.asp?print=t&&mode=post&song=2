<b>Killing Them Softly With My Song... - </b>12/4/01 6:00:18 PM<br>~ <b>Aluania</b><blockquote>I just started being a Bard (only 7th lvl at this time) and I LOVE this song. Sure I made the mistake of forgeting to turn it off a few times while going to town but I have learned quickly.  It DOES do nice damage and pulls excellently. I was helping a low level out and I was using this song to attract monsters and I didn't even bother trying to hit them at all.  We found that sometimes I got the experience and ablity to loot and she didn't even though she was the one whacking on them.<br><br>&quot;I'm struming their pain with my fingers,..... beating thier life with my words,......  Killing them softly with my song,  Killing them softly, with my song,   la  la  la   laaaa.... &quot;</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Great in the right place - </b>12/3/01 6:55:52 PM<br>~ <b>Klapton</b><blockquote>USE F9 TO TOGGLE VIEWS--GET GOOD AT IT:<br><br>Read other comments about 3rd person camera view--all important.<br><br>CERTAIN AREAS ARE HIGH AGGRO ANYWAY:<br><br>In some areas, everything close aggros anyway, why not smack it, with lute equipped for maximum damage dealing?<br>Example:  Orc highway in Oasis.  Everything aggros except spiders which aren't that tough anyway.<br><br>DO NOT USE WHEN CASTER IS MEZZING/SLEEPING ETC.<br><br>Talk to your casters.  Ask if anyone is doing crowd control.  If they are, put TARGETED dmg song on hotkey, make a hotkey for /ASSIST.  A good chanter doing Mez can save your life, especially if you are doing a challenging camp of yellows etc.<br><br>TWO BARDS--ONE USE DRUM, ONE USE LUTE:<br><br>If you have two bards in your group, one equip the drum, do AC/resist buff, Chant of Battle, Selos when running/pulling.  Second bard equips lute, does Heal and Wince.  Either one can twist in singing only songs like Bellow and Anthem.<br><br>DON'T LET OTHERS DISSUADE YOU<br><br>You know your class better than others.  Try to educate them as best you can.  Don't let other bards tell you not to use your AE.  You have a wide 3rd person view to avoid adds, you know whether or not someone is mezzing--Wince the bastards!<br><br>Right as you hit the hotkey, just before six lines of &quot;Target Winces&quot;,    /g MOSH PIT!!!</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>One more perk - </b>11/28/01 11:17:58 AM<br>~ <b>Statia</b><blockquote>I'm a bard of the 13th season and I noticed while hunting bandits in the karanas that even if the chords aren't doing awe inspiring damage it is enough to disrupt casting mobs and that itself is usually worth the effort. BTW, this site rocks! <br><br>                                                                     Statia of Xegony<br>-I didn't die. I just got reeeeally sleeepy.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Very valuable song - </b>11/19/01 11:59:23 AM<br>~ <b>Agalorn (Test Server)</b><blockquote>I have often seen this song knocked down on many strategy guides, and I have seen several Bards shun this song.  I keep hearing how &quot;Dangerous&quot; it is.  <br><br>Phoey.<br><br>This is one of my favorite songs.  Especially when I dont' have time to group.  I use this song just about everywhere and anywhere.  The secret to safely using this song is to ALWAYS be in an external camera view.  Whenever I start a fight, I pull to where I want to fight, then I hit F9 4 times (to get to the last camera view..This is important).  I then adjust my camera so I have a nice WIDE view of the area.  While i'm twisting away, I constantly rotate the camera around keeping an eye out for anything wandering into range. If I see something, then I will simply drop a tick or two of the CoD out, so I don't get any adds. When my quarry decides to run, I hit F9 once to get back to 1st person (hence the reason for using the LAST camera view) and chase it down.<br><br>This tactic of camera views, is ESSENTIAL to a Bard, but it is also very valuable to any player.  There are many mobs who will come to the aid of thier companions.  If you keep an eye out with your external cameras, you can spot approching comrades before they decide to add.  Wandering kodiak?  Simply pulls yours a little further away and you'll never get an add.<br><br>It amazes me how people can go without this :)<br><br>So don't dump this song.  It is very valuable and very safe if you use your head a bit.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Useful if you're careful - </b>9/25/01 3:17:25 PM<br>~ <b>Mellifluous of Zebuxoruk</b><blockquote>I once had a bard and stopped playing because of this song.  It got me killed more than it ever helped.  I recently created another bard and while this song can cause some problems if you don't watch it, it's also been a big help recently.  Particulary at higher levels.  When you're starting out, all it does is attract more mobs than you can handle, but in the right setting it more than makes up for the lower level trouble.  I use it now for a little extra pain boost to white and the occassional yellow mob when I solo.  Also if you're fighting a blue mob and a buddy shows up to help, this song will wear them down together, so you're not facing a fresh mob when you kill off the first.  As someone earlier mentioned, change the view so you can see if something is coming close to the range that you don't want attacking you.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Song radius - </b>7/21/01 5:07:23 PM<br>~ <b>Yalten</b><blockquote>OK, I'm a level 4 bard so this may be a level thing but this song does not seem to have a radius of 30 feet. The range seems to be just about as far as my weapon can swing. So does this song's range increase with level or do I get the increased range with an instrument?</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Great with a damage shield, too... - </b>5/18/01 2:49:42 PM<br>~ <b>Calalene of Mithaniel Marr</b><blockquote>If you are grouped with a druid, they can cast thorns on you, and then you sing Chords to get all the little nasties in the area to aggro on you, they get smacked with the Chords damage as well as the thorns damage, and the druid is there to heal you...works wonderfully!</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Twist In Time Saves ... - </b>4/25/01 11:10:36 AM<br>~ <b>Telmarine</b><blockquote>At the time of writing this comment I am a Bard of 11 Songs a few kills short of my 12th.  It was readily apparent that this song has Serious potential for longevity.  I grew up using this song to solo white and yellow mobs in East Commons.  When I reached 7 I decided to head on over to West Commons to attempt to solo Orc Centurions as the camp there provides a solo Orc on the eastern spawn.   This song twisted in with Jonathan’s Whistling Warsong and the Hymn of Restoration gave me the edge to dispatch Orcs with relatively little pain (of course never forget Selo’s and the guards at Toll Booth when you find yourself getting smashed).<br><br>It wasn’t until I reached 10that I truly realized the power and value of this song.  When I hit 10 I ran myself over to North Ro to see if I could take a Derv as Derv 3 (Wall Derv) is a good spot for beginning Derv hunters.  When I arrived, there was a 14 Wizzy and a 15 Warrior who invited me to join them.  At first I was twisting Anthem de Arms, Elemental Rhythms, and Restoration.  For the first couple of fights we noticed that the wizzy would continually get beat within a red bub of HP as the warrior would be unable to taunt the mob(s) off of the wiz.  On a bad pull which involved a Thug and several Barbarians I decided that we were pretty much through and I was not about to abandon my partners; I decided what the heck and kicked on the Chords of Dissonance and try to at least take down the Thug before meeting the Reaper.   No sooner had I let loose the first note, every mob turned it’s attention on me.  As a low level Bard this wasn’t a good thing so I decided to kick in the Selo’s and see if I could pull the Mobs away from the group.  This worked like a charm and ended up saving the group. While I ran the train around in circles the other two were able to finish off the thug and begin to pick off individual mobs as I would run on by.  I have found this to work in several other groups since and it is a great way to get your group out of a bind or buy them time to meditate/heal.  In most cases with a basic drum equipped you can pull a train all day long and never get touched.<br><br>The Ability to use this song to essentially fulfill an enchanter’s job adds to your versatility and value to a group, especially when a group is without an enchanter and healer.  Also I have found that in all but a few cases you can agro a mob off of an enchanter with this song.   My primary character being an enchanter I can speak for most and tell you that this is an invaluable service.<br><br>May your feet be light and your songs joyous.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Songs &quot;Grow Up&quot; - </b>2/15/01 4:39:53 PM<br>~ <b>Gaedan Mentheren</b><blockquote>The best thing about Bards is that our songs for the most part all &quot;grow up&quot; with us, whereas most spells only &quot;grow&quot; in their level sphere before they are replaced.<br><br>Chords of Dissonance is an *excellent* example of this.  At level two, when you receive this spell, you'll be doing 1-2 points of damage, each tick.  At my current level, 28, I'm doing 9 while singing, and an impressive 27 while using a regular mandolin.  With a Princess Lute or Seven-Stringed Lute, you can well imagine the sheer power of this song.<br><br>Chords also provides another outstanding example of a Bard's power with dots.  This song *will* in fact &quot;stack&quot; with the level 18 power-house dot, Denon's Disruptive Discord.  If you've skill enough to change instruments AND songs at the same time (it's not all that hard, but does require a mouse), you can lay up to 50-80 points of damage per tick (not song duration, mind you!) by your mid-twenties.  Over a course of duration, this adds up to 240+ damage per 9-10 seconds (standard song duration), with only two songs being played.<br><br>Consider this when at best bet your damage output with weapons in this duration will be around 100-150 around your mid-life, and 200-300 in the late game (haste not withstanding.)<br><br>Also consider that this damage is added to ANY damageable NPC (or PC if you're +pvp) in the area, with almost no limit.  This is a boon (BIG damage), and a bane (you're the one ticking off all those monsters, remember), but with backup (tanks, chain stuns), has the potentional for use throught your career.<br><br>Remember this, younglings, when you're grouped with casters (enchanters especially) and healers, and they're expecting you to tank.  Using AOE becomes a very attractive option in your mid-twenties and beyond, especially with someone that can stun the mobs so they can't hit back.<br><br>Keep your lute tuned and drums crisp, fellows!</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Your first attempts at music - </b>1/28/01 4:09:34 AM<br>~ <b>Kocho Divah</b><blockquote>Many times I saw a young bard hanging out at W. Freeport gates playing the &quot;wincing&quot; song. Before I can react, the Guards bark &quot;Bards like you are an affront to my senses!&quot; and an early lesson is learned. Before you get close to town, or any NPC's first make sure this song is turned off. You do not see an icon showing its effect, so you'll have to double-check this song is turned off. Either do a /stopsong, or make sure your song gems are all inactive and greyed out. Then you can run to the guards with confidence. Also, if you are out fighting away from town, if is helpful if you change your views often, so you don't pick up any unwanted visitors.<br><br>For this bad experience early on, many bards put this song away, and never want to take it out again. With caution, you can turn these disgraceful chords to your advantage. It does better and better damage as you grow older. I still use this song in my 30's, as it stacks with Hymn nicely, and I can use Strings for full effect. It doesn't get resisted as much as the level 17 song Denon's Disruptive Dischord, so if you're fighting in a group that often finds itself surrounded by more than one MOB, twist Hymn and CoD and a few other songs of your choice for faster kills, faster healing, and overall reduced downtime.</blockquote></td></tr></table></blockquote><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href="/songs.asp?&&mode=post&song=2">Back to Normal Mode</a><br><br><br><i>Printed from EQDiva.com on 3/11/02 5:31:27 PM.</i><br><br></td></tr></table>
