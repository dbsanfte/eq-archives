I saw that and assumed it could only be purchased in the EC tunnels - but several postings below say it can be found in Erudin, Kelethin, Freeport, and Qeynos.<br><br>Are all these reports true?  I was just in Erudin and I would have picked it up if I'd have realized it was there (and of course now I'm in Kunark without a good way to return to Erudin and level 19 - too bad for the casters I guess.)</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>Song Stacking - </b>12/3/01 6:15:52 PM<br>~ <b>Qeynestri</b><blockquote>While the reasons this song stacks with the same song from another bard may be ellusive, think of it like this: This song is NOT a duration spell.  It only gives mana for the tick that it is sung.  It also has NO icon in the buff window, so you only know that it is working from the song message - &quot;Your mind clears.&quot; <br><br>Something else to keep in mind - it takes 3 seconds for the song to take effect once begun and 6 seconds for it to hit the next tick if sung continuously.  With little lag and a fast connection, one can stop and start the song over and get the effect to hit again before it would normally if it was sung continuously.  In this way, one can deliver more mana back over an extended period of downtime =).</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Stacks with itself? - </b>9/26/01 7:20:20 AM<br>~ <b>Tenamihn</b><blockquote>Ok, I was grouped with a major twink the other day, we were both level 20, but he had full lambent and Singing steel boots, (no I am not making a comment on twinking) so I figure that he has at least one high level character and knows what he is doing.  He has us both singing the Chant of clarity in the downtimes because &quot;they stack&quot;.  And sure enough, we both has the Mind clears message going, and none of our casters (caster heavy group) complained about being short of mana.<br><br>But still, this sounds contradictory to the way that most of EQ works, where the same spell won't stack with itself (see DOTs for many examples).  Does anyone have any hard facts about whether this really works or not?</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Where to get this song... - </b>8/24/01 6:09:35 PM<br>~ <b>Linadani</b><blockquote>It took a few nights to get this song, and yes it could be found in the Eastern Commons Tunnel.  Problem is, people seem to enjoy attacking the guy fairly often.  It was obtained for about 30 pp by a druid for me (hey, it's not like I need to worry about the mana).  His name is indeed Rushka.<br><br>I find this song is useful for casters who are not extremely twinked.  I once ran with an incompetent nature caster who had a Wisdom of 183 who could never get to full mana with this song when I was in my mid- 20s.  Of course, if he had actually done his job... well, anyway.<br><br>By the time you get to 32, you will need that Chorus of Clarity song! For fun, I suggest going out to North Ro and having younger casters let you into their group so you can run it for them as they prepare to fight dervs, then disband when they go off to fight.   They'll love it (except perhaps the group's chanters:).<br><br>Good hunting all,<br><br>Linadani Warsinger<br>Lanys T'Vyl</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Cost - </b>7/26/01 12:03:23 AM<br>~ <b>Antionne</b><blockquote>As of 7/25/01 this song costed 21pp at 100 charisma.  I don't know where this 29pp stuff came from, but he was indifferent.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

Once you have sung hymn, you can stop it and you will get the 3bursts of healing. This means its not a pulse effect. However both the 20 and 32 songs are pulse effects, so once sung the caster gets the mana.

Went to bard guild in Freeport, low and behold there it was!  Upstairs and the song did not cost 29pp, instead it was around 9pp.  Hope this helps.<br><br><i> ~ Kocho - I am wondering why so many people are having a hard time finding this song in the tunnel.

<b>Don't confuse others, look: - </b>6/1/01 4:17:19 PM<br>~ <b>Baridel</b><blockquote>Ok guys, since there are so many random posts on this song, allow me to summarize :<br><br>This song is bought off Rushka Delamoor inside the EC tunnels on the west wall of the chamber of Shady Swashbucklers.<br><br>This song DOES cost 29pp, and this is the ONLY place it can be found. The song that was found in Kelethin and Qeynos that cost about 16pp was our level 32 breeze'ish song, Cassandra's CHORUS of Clarity. Please, people, look : the CHANT of Clarity is our 20 song, the CHORUS of clarity is our 32 song.<br><br>On the note about non-efficient twisting : Hymn and Chant/Chorus of Clarity are both PULSING songs, which means that the effect ONLY happens when the song pulses, so if you stop singing it, and the effect icon is still there, it is NOT still healing you. You could say it is less efficient to twist both because, technically, you are losing one of either a +Health or a +Mana tick every two ticks. I still say twist both, when the casters say FM, switch to Hymn, but that's my 2cp.<br><br>Ok, I think i covered it all, if you have any questions about this PLEASE email me (mujisashi@home.com).<br><br>Stay safe all, and keep singing :),<br><br>Baridel<br>9th song Bard of Mithaniel Marr</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
