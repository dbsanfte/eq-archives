<h3>Nostrolo Tambourine Quest Walkthrough</h3>

<h5>Quest Level</h5>
<i>This quest may be started as a level 1 bard, simply gather all components from other players (none are NO DROP) and catch a ride to Fironie Vie to talk to the banker. If you wanted to quest this yourself, it is feasible around level 35. Some coins I would suggest getting a group together.</i>
<br><br>
<h5>Quest Walkthrough</h5>
Talk to Wellford Fargin, the banker in Firiona Vie, and ask him about his hobby. He will tell you that he used to collect rare coins and gems. If you say that you will help him, he wants you to first replace his prized Star of Odus which was stolen from him. 
<br><br>
Here's how the conversation goes:
<blockquote>
<b>You say,</b> "Hail Wellford Fargin"<br>
Wellford Fargin turns his frown around and begins to smile. "Oh! Hello. It has been quite some time since someone has been polite and greeted me. Most adventurers are quite rude. To think I gave up my [hobby] to work day and night here!!"<br>
<b>You say,</b> "What hobby?"<br>
<b>Wellford Fargin says</b> "I used to collect rare coins and gems. I came to Fironia Vie to do just that, but I never have the time to [collect rare coins] when I am always here working."<br>
<b>You say,</b> "I can collect rare coins."<br>
<b>Wellford Fargin says</b> "If you want to help, you can begin by replacing my prized Star of Odus which was taken from my vault when I stepped out to dine. Do so, and I may trust you to collect the coins. I will also reward you with an item a composer left here."
</blockquote>
You may easily purchase the Star of Odus for around 105pp from a few of the jewelers in a jewel shop in Erudin. Come back to Fironia Vie and hand the Star of Odus to Wellford and he will hand you back the "Tin Box", which has 6 empty slots. Be sure you have an empty slot because this box requires a slot all by itself. He will then tell you about the other six coins he has been looking for. 
<br><br>

<h5>Identifying your coins</h5> 
Start collecting these coins in various parts of Kunark. They will all say "An Ancient Coin", so use your Level 14 song <a href="/songs.asp?song=14">Lyssa's Cataloging Libretto</a> to correctly identify your coins. Simply pick up one of the coins with your mouse cursor, and play the song. You will see a message identifying the coin in hand. These coins are not LORE and NO DROP, so this means you can auction for them, and may hold multiple coins of each.
<br><br>

<h5>Coin Values</h5> 
Be sure to say "Looking for ancient coins", as many people will just give them to you for free. Some people might be greedy and will want to charge 100-200pp for them. Hopefully you'll get most of your coins for free, and pay only 30-40pp for the rest. The Kaesora coin might be a bit expensive, I paid 100pp. It really all depends on how much you want to pay, and if you can wait for a good deal.
<br><br>

<h5>The 6 Ancient Coins</h5>
<ul>
<li><a href="#ikgran">Ik Gran</a> - drops off the Captain of the Guard 
in the City of Mist 
<li><a href="#terrazton">Terraz Ton</a> - drops off the Failed Raider in 
Kaesora 
<li><a href="#danakgran">Danak Gran</a> - drops off the Scrounger 
Scorpion in the Overthere 
<li><a href="#veksargran">Veksar Gran</a> - drops off the Bloodgill Goblins 
in the Lake the Ill Omen 
<li><a href="#dalnir">Royal Crown of Dalnir</a> - drops off the Kly 
Implicator in Dalnir 
<li><a href="#torsiston">Torsis Ton</a> - foraged coin in the Emerald 
Jungle
</ul>


<h5>Completing the Quest</h5>
Once you have obtained all six items, put them in the tin box and hit combine. It will change into a chest and if you hand this back to Wellford, he will reward you with the Nostrolo Tambourine. This instrument will add about +25% to percussion songs. It is a nifty new percussion instrument that actually looks like a tambourine when held. Unfortunately, we still strum it like a lute.

<h4>Obtaining the 6 Coins</h4>
<a name="ikgran"><b>Ik Gran Coin</b></a> - drops off the Captain of the Guard in the City of Mist<br>
The Captain of the Guard is a high 30's undead skeleton that can spawn nearly anywhere in the first half of the City of Mist zone, but pops most frequently at the bridge gate or in the courtyard, and sometimes the temple. He seems to drop the coin every time. Just hang out at the zone or /ooc asking for it, usually no one needs the coin. - (Info submitted by Swyshing)
<br><br><br>

<a name="terrazton"><b>Terraz Ton Coin</b></a> - drops off the Failed Raider in Kaesora <br>
This coin seems to be the hardest coin to get. <br><br>
The failed raider is a random spawn in the Kaesora Library. If there are people in the library, they usually let you have to coin if they don't have a bard with them. You have to kill everything in the library and the failed raider will spawn eventually. While I was there, he spawned 1 time in a 3 hours period of time. - (Info submitted by Tirade Bunzofsteel)
<br><br><br>

<a name="danakgran"><b>Danak Gran Coin</b></a> - drops off the Scrounger Scorpion in the Overthere <br>
Grab a group and descend down the canyon. Stay near the canyon entrance. Start killing Scorpious, and eventually a scrounger will spawn and they always drop a coin. These scorpious will start out with a Harm Touch which seems to be unresistable which will bring you down a few bubbles. If you want to solo, I also hear it is effective to charm two so they use their HT on each other. There may be more scroungers near the temples, but it might be hard to grab just one and kite it out to safety.

<a name="veksargran"><b>Veksar Gran Coin</b></a> - drops off the Bloodgill Goblins in the Lake the Ill Omen <br>
Details to come...
<br><br><br>

<a name="dalnir"><b>Royal Crown of Dalnir Coin</b></a> - drops off the Kly Implicator in Dalnir<br>
Details to come...
<br><br><br>

<a name="torsiston"><b>Torsis Ton Coin</b></a> - foraged coin in the Emerald Jungle<br>
This is one of the items that may be foraged in the Emerald Jungle Zone. It will be very hard (but possible) for you to forage it yourself as a bard. There are a few options for you to obtain this coin:
<ul>
<li>Have a friendly druid agree to teleport you into Emerald Jungle (you must be in a Kunark dungeon for the druid to evac you here). Then, the two of you just forage until you get the coin. It might take some time. In my case, it took a 45 druid an hour and a half to forage one coin.
<li>Create a young Iksar, run to this zone, and start foraging. Many bards have done this successfully and have gotten their coin within minutes.
<li>Run to the zone yourself. Try and forage up the coin yourself. It has been reported that a bard has indeed foraged up this coin, so if you have time to kill, you might want to try yourself. It will just take longer, as you'll get many failed forages...  Emerald Jungle is a deserted place many times, just people teleporting in to get to The City of Mist, but if you notice a druid or ranger in the zone, you can ask them to help you forage. Be careful in this zone though, there are level 35-45 mobs that will hunt you. Emerald Jungle is alot like Jurassic Park in that respect. Most mobs cannot see through Invisibility or Superior Camo, except for the undead skeletons.
</ul>

<b>Good luck in getting your Tambourine!!! If you have any information regarding the parts of the quest that I didn't provide detail on, please send them to me.
