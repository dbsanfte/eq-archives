My gear is mediocre at best for a Virtuoso and I can sometimes kill them with no visible HP loss.<br><br>Disease resist gear is highly recommended. Mushrooms will cast disease based stun, nuke (with mushroom illusion/root), and slow on you ALL the time, so it's extremely important to be able to resist this. They cast even more than they melee.<br><br>STEER CLEAR OF - A Deep Cavern Lotus. These mobs are perma-rooted, but they will SUMMON you and they nuke VERY hard.

He will keep spawning mob after mob, which you must kill for him. Its crazy, as a bard I really had my hands full. I had a full group of 51-60 (cleric, shaman, warrior, wiz, bard, and rogue) and it was pretty fun. <br><br>The quest mob will keep spawning mobs you must kill (such as A Chakta Fungusbeast), and they'll cast snare on you and such. In the end, we had to call evac, but we'll try this again and see where this leads. I'm sure someone has already covered this quest, but for now, it was a unique experience.</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#9999cc"><td colspan="2" nowrap><b>Grieg's End</b>&nbsp;<font size="1">Type=Dungeon</font>|<font size="1">Tag=greigsend</font></td><td align="right" valign="top">|<a href="/guides/submitHunting.asp?level=55&zone=134"><font size="1">Add Guide for Grieg's End</font></a></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Aeadiin Byu</b> (<i>12/12/01</i>) I checked out this zone the night after Luclin was released, and it seemed to be a VERY interesting zone )<br><br>Set up to be a crawl dungeon, Grieg's End apparently gets its name from the demise of its occupant, who slowly went Insane. The zone mirrors this, as many of the mobs proc 'Tendrils of Madness' an illusion type spell that makes you appear as a different Luclin mob to each member of your party. The mobs also have this base effect on them. They hit normal for level 45-low 50ish mobs, and have chanters, shaman, warriors and clerics. 90% of the mobs are blue, with the rest being red to me at 56.

You can get GREAT experiene by root / dotting mobs by the zone in. Few things you need to worry about though: There is one mob (it used to be more) at the zone in. The bard should zone in first, with the druid lagging about 20 seconds behind him. Bard zones in, and keeps mob mezzed until druid gets there for root / snare. The spawn time seems to vary on him, and it also seems to be on a spawn cycle. After you get him killed, you should be able to just keep up with the spawn rate. Also, you may be tempted to use AE's; don't. You can aggro mobs on the floor below you, and get about 5-6 adds to the fight. There is a stair way that is a trap (you'll fall through), and make sure you've got a cleric friend with a key to rez you in case things go awry. With control, this can be the best xp you've ever had - without it, it can be a very very tedious corpse run.</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Moya Starsinger</b> (<i>10/4/01</i>) I have been main CC in here a number of times and it's a fun zone.  I recommend having a good monk puller.  We have done a hall with bard/druid/monk/ranger/mage/mage.  Not your  typical group at all and the HT's are the only thing that was a danger to us as they could drop a caster fast.  With a cleric, you should be okay.<br><br></span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Tenoro Allegro</b> (<i>7/31/01</i>) I recommend bringing both a rogue and a druid/wizard.  This will make your trip a whole lot easier.  The rogue can pick all the locks while the wiz/druid can evac you out.  53 song works quite well for crowd control here and has allowed me to be primary crowd control without problems.  The erudite illusion mask drops here in West Wing, in the room with the glowing gem that teleports you to entrance.</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#9999cc"><td colspan="2" nowrap><b>Icewell Keep</b>&nbsp;<font size="1">Type=Dungeon</font>|<font size="1">Tag=icewell</font></td><td align="right" valign="top">|<a href="/guides/submitHunting.asp?level=55&zone=39"><font size="1">Add Guide for Icewell Keep</font></a></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Kristinae Stormrider</b> (<i>7/17/02</i>) Absolute minimum level recommended for this zone: 51<br>Recommended to use the setups described: 57<br><br>I've hunted here a few times.  If you have decided to trash your Thurgadin and Dain faction, this is the place to go to get Kael faction.<br><br>First thing you may notice with these dorfs is that they are ALL magic-immune.  That means no mez, no snare, no nothing.  Should you get an add, the best thing to do is have another tank CC it, while you and the main assist (MA) beat on the one he's declared as his target and kill it as soon as possible then move on to the next.<br><br>In my experience, many pulls generally pull 1-2 each time.  This zone is ideal for 2 groups, as both can get xp fairly quickly.  Also, having a second group lessens the chance of an overpull forcing the people to evac.  The bard's role in this place is still important if you're there.  I have two tactics I like to use in this place.<br><br>First of all, standard setup.  For me, this would be:<br>-Amplification<br>-McVaxus's Rousing Rondo<br>-Battlecry of the Vah'Shir<br>-Largo's Absonant Binding (replaced with Melody of Ervaj due to MR)<br>-mana regen song (take your pick)<br><br>4 and a half songs in my lineup.  It's not hard if you get used to it.  Anyways, this is my standard setup.  Buff the heck out of melee in the group and let the beatdown commence.  I have my epic, so I have no need for VoV or the 54 haste.  I go with Rondo so my epic can take care of the haste for me if you don't have a Chanter or Shaman.  Another setup requires either a Mage or a Druid to make it truly effective.  Here it is:<br><br>-Amplification<br>-McVaxus' Rousing Ronso<br>-Psalm of Warmth<br>-Tuyen's Chant of Flame<br>-mana regen song (take your pick)<br><br>The end result with a Druid/Mage 25 point damage shield is a damage shield of about 72.  This is with epic and Amplification.  This is a more offensive setup, and the chant allows for better fire damage if you're light on melee in your group, as well as do a bit more damage.  I'd use Occlusion, since it's unresistable, but cold-based spells don't exactly work as well as fire in here.  Use your own judgement.  Anyways, the dorf essentially does all the damage to himself.  You'd be suprised how much that 72-point DS adds up after a while. :)  This setup works even without the epic, although I estimate you lose about 15-20 points of your damage shield.<br><br>(NOTE:  Those numbers did not include items or potions that add to a damage shield, like the 8th Coldain ring, SS Bracer, or the Shaman-made potion.  However, done right, you can see upwards of 150-point damage shields.  And yes, I have seen it done....well, it was 142, but still.  Even on ubermobs, that 150 damage each hit adds up FAST.)<br><br>This is for the castle portion of Icewell, not down the well.  I've never been down there, so I can't say what to expect.  I just know that whatever's down there is...ugly.<br><br>If you're a lower level Bard (IE: 51 or so), there's still room for ya to move around.  Just use your best judgement and adapt as needed.  Play the class, and you should be fine.  Plain and simple.</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#9999cc"><td colspan="2" nowrap><b>Karnor's Castle</b>&nbsp;<font size="1">Type=Dungeon</font>|<font size="1">Tag=karnor</font></td><td align="right" valign="top">|<a href="/guides/submitHunting.asp?level=55&zone=44"><font size="1">Add Guide for Karnor's Castle</font></a></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Rayquan-Veeshan</b> (<i>12/10/01</i>) I had a grp of all 48-54 , bard pally cleric druid monk pally (yes 2 pallys) and we did awsome , until i left for RL crap that is =/</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Silvendras</b> (<i>5/25/01</i>) Karnors starts to green out around 54 .

However, it took some practicing before I was able to charmkite up here.  The earlier post WAS right, there is a SK wanderer on toiler hill.  He passes through the area fairly often, and needs to be part of your calculations.  I tried to charmkite first thing after arriving in Maiden's, and discovered that an average kite could bash me and do about 1200 damage before releasing me.  It turns out that I got just a slight bit of computer lag in this zone (some of which was relieved by camping once entirely out of the game and returning).  With this in mind, I realized that the toilers were sometimes (often) closer than they appeared to be and I needed to keep more distance between myself and the pack throughout the charmkiting operation than I had in the Overthere or Dreadlands.   I got a very good feel for this distance by simply chant-kiting a few toilers.  I'd say that once you can chant-kite a toiler to death and only get hit once by your follower, you are probably ready to try a bit of charm-kiting.  Expect a death or two, and don't be too proud to go back to dawnshroud and request a lowbie rez if there isn't a good rezzer in Maiden's.  The extra kiting time you save by grabbing a 70 rez instead of a 96 will easily make that experience back, even in a hell level like 54.  I'm at 3y 3b right now in 54 -- I'm hoping to ding tomorrow or the next day.<br><br>Pratt<br>AB</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>susperia</b> (<i>6/22/02</i>) this is one of the best zones for charm kiting in the entire game. in my early 50's i spent a great deal of my time kiting othmirs in cobalt scar but when my faction went sour i started agroing everything in the zone every time i engaged a mob. If your not familiar with maiden's eye there is a giant xi fort right when you zone in about 100 &quot;virtual&quot; yards ahead of you. to the right of this fort is a huge open area with some small rolling hills. this area has several different types of mobs, some xi randomly have see inv so this area is not safe, they have an instant casting time nuke of somewhere between 500-100hp. beyond this, around the far corner of the xi fort is smaller area next to a lake with a big tree on a hill. this area has been dubbed the &quot;toiler hill&quot; because it has about 30 wandering toilers around it, and nothing else. an occasionaly xi may wonder over but its very rare. i simply charm a toiler, get it fighting 3 other toilers and then chant kite my nearly dead ex-pet when appropriate. remember F1 twice targets your pet. youll have about 20 adds so youll be constantly running around, dont do this if you have alot of lag youll be dead fast if they catch up to you. be very careful to NEVER touch the wall of the xi fort, they can aggro through it and youll die very fast. the loot here is pretty good, centi weapons drop all the time. if you have a caster friend some uber transient arms also drop...as well as strength of grodan a 2hs for you tank types. also toilers drop the bottle neck of the shield of bane warding quest, black flame charcoal. i have sold the multiquest for this for 3kp, ive only seen 1 in about 1000 kills. one last thing, if a kite gets out of control or you fear impending death go to zone wall at the back of the kiting area that curves around the lake (youll understand once your there) run to the corner of the zone and camp. with selo speed youll have time enough time to camp out before they get you. hope this helps you out. i put 55-60 but you can do this at lower levels i think.</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Saleran Fox</b> (<i>1/4/02</i>) On multiple occasions, I have wandered a bit too close to a white house filled with the specter guys (Xi Vius or something like that), and have been aggroed on by practically the whole house.  These mobs are shadowknights, so I ate about 7 700-damage harm-touches in under 5 seconds.. it wasn't pretty.  Vampires see invis, which is pretty annoying, so basically i reccomend that when travelling in this zone, you use Selos Accelerating Chorus.. atleast you have your speed if they start hitting you.  <br><br>Saleran - 59 bard of Tholuxe</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Dyahannah</b> (<i>12/24/01</i>) so far in this zone ive gotten Fordhels Gauntlets, Belt of Defense, Goranga Idol, Hoop of Magi'Kot, some other 10 ac belt and some decent altexp<br><br>very nice zone and connected to other places like umbral, akheva and close to town</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>Kocho Divah</b> (<i>12/20/01</i>) This is an easy zone to fight in, big grassy open spaces, lots of places to hold a camp. I came here a few days ago, and basically have been fighting with no healer at all, and only 3 people in group. Fear works great here. You get the occasional higher level mob that can't be feared or charmed, and even one that can't be bardic mezzed. But even if you get in over your heads, selos works here. :) <br><br>At first, I thought this zone was nothing but trains, but now, it isn't that bad. You have alot of solo-ers, and lots of mobs all around, so you have to watch out. Not all things see through invis, especially near the zone to Dawnshroud.<br><br>Its good experience, and very high chance for loot and spells. In 10 minutes of logging in, I got a Goranga Idol and a mage earring. Lots of pretty good weapons drop here too (Centi) that would be good for someone that is looking for an upgrade. Also, the Forhal's Gauntlets that are BRD/ROG only with 25ac and Lockpick 2% drop here, although I haven't had a chance to see those. I've been told they've dropped off of random mobs so far. Anyway, it seems every hour something nice drops here. Some are NO DROP, so I'm thinking of camping an alternate character here to loot in case no one wants.<br><br>A fun zone overall. :)<br><br></span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><span class="clsSmall"><li type="square"><b>sonnett</b> (<i>12/18/01</i>) This is like an OT for 51+.  Easy to find pick up groups a lot of wandering mobs, descent loot (centi swords, no drop 20AC +15 wis, str belt etc).  Figure this will now be the new progression for 51+ outdoor type players (IE LOIO, OT, DL, Maidens eye)  I tried charm kiting here, but ate a few HT's while running around, had to run for zone.

Also, they run really really slow, so circling back to loot your previous kill is no problem either.  Hounds will add quite a bit particularily if you kite in the center area of the zone.  this is a good and bad thing.  You don't have to look far for a mob, but the down side is they are chasing you.
