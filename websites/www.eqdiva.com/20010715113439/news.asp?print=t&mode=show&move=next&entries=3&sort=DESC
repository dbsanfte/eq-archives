<tr><td colspan="2" bgcolor="#eeeeee"><br><blockquote>As we all know EQ is so addicting no one can stay away for long... As I was meditating in the mountains, what? bards don't meditate! As I was running up those mountains, my boyfriend started reminiscing about his EQ days, which got me started as well.<br><br>When I got back, eventually I logged onto EQ, to try and make my way through 52 to reach my most anticipated level - 53! It was great fun performing for my group, and again, I got lots of compliments on my play style. The next night I did my first raid with my new guild 'Evening Reign' - Naggy went down and my Group 2 got the Experience! Congrats to Erinonz for her Red Dragon Scale for her epic! If I stay at 52 for a wee bit more, maybe I'll get mine soon too!<br><br>Thanks Gaedan for popping onto Druzzil Ro to say 'Hi'! I challenged you to meet me in Naggy's lair, but I guess you aren't as Fearless as you claim to be. At least I met you in Lower Guk as a level 1 nekkid bard! :P<br><br>Its kinda funny when I log on, and everyone asks me how my vacation in the mountains was. I guess people read the news here...<br><br>Updates on the site: <br>I updated a few screenshots for your enjoyment. Because of your kind donations, I am able to re-activate this section, and not have to cringe about the bandwidth it takes. But a few screenshots, even though they were good, had to be turned down. I am only accepting bard-related screenshots.<br><br>I also updated a few song comments. Again, I learn from all you other bards, so keep the comments coming, and let me know if there's anything I need to update regarding songs/skills/etc...<br><br>I notice we have lots of new Hunting Guide strategies in. These are updated automatically so I haven't read them all, but I hope you all enjoy them.<br><br>Take care, and maybe I'll be popping in a bit more often!<br></blockquote></td></tr>

But I have been updating Song comments, and even Screenshots now and then, as well as updating Reed's latest song analysis. (Thanks Reed!)<br><br>I will be on vacation in the Grand Teton mountains, backpacking and hiking for 10 days. So I will not be around to answer emails (not that I was good at doing that anyway), nor update Song Comments and Screenshots.<br><br>Have a good Fourth of July you Americans, and the rest, just have a good time in real life and EQ life! :)</blockquote></td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2" bgcolor="#eeeeee"><br><blockquote>I’ve a new (and beta) release of the spreadsheet: Release 2.0 beta.<br><br><a href='/files/songanalysis.asp'>Reed's Song Analysis Spreadsheet v 2.0 Beta</a><br><br>This is a major change; as I’m going full formula for all of the songs (and I’ve learned a heck of a lot over the past month.) Virtually every song has changed, and I’ve got a lot more resolution on levels and instruments.<br><br>I’ve also added the ability to select an instrument by name, and Singing Short Sword Support (Select SSS for Voice instrument).<br><br>THIS IS BETA<br>Please, if you can, do some testing of the numbers on this spreadsheet, and please report any differences. E-mail me (eqreed@yahoo.com) is the best way to get ahold of me.<br><br>Note that if the AC is off by one, it’s probably not a bug. (Just ask, and I’ll go into my findings on AC, it’s not as straight forward as one would think).<br><br>Enjoy, and please let me know where it’s wrong. It still consider this very beta and I make a lot of stupid mistakes /grin<br><br>- Reed Stormwind (54 bard of E’ci)</blockquote></td></tr>
