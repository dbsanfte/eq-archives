<h5>Stacotto's Swim Guide</h5>

We have all heard about using the Aquatic 
Ayre to train up your wind skill. But who 
says you have to be sitting on land when you 
do it? Using the following simple technique I 
increased my swim skill by over 50 levels in 
about 90 minutes. Here's how it works: 
<ul>
<li>Find yourself a safe body of water to 
practice in (I used the dock area in Freeport) 
<li>Jump in and start playing the Aquatic 
Ayre. Equip your wind instrument if you 
want to increase your wind skill at the same 
time. 
<li>Click on autorun (numlock) and swim into 
a corner underwater 
<li>Go to bed and check back in the morning 
(or do whatever else you want for awhile) 
</ul>
During this process you will see that your 
stamina decreases somewhat rapidly. Don't 
worry, you will not drown. When your 
stamina runs out you will take a hit on your 
strength and dexterity. But this only 
happens once. These values do not continue 
to decrease. 
<br><br>
When you come back you will have that lvl 
80 swim skill and be well on your way for 
future adventures in Kedge Keep! As you 
level, repeat for about 10 to 20 minutes to 
max out the swim skill. 
<br><br>
You can also provide this service to your 
group. Just be carefull not to disband or 
leave while a group member is afk. And be 
sure to warn them of the dangers associated 
with an LD condition on your part. 
<br><br>
Have Fun!!
