				<td colspan="2"><span>Thats right EverQUEST II is now EverCRAFT!
<br />

<br />
The name change isn't official yet but thats pretty much the reality of it. So if you are into crafting and want a game thats all about crafting?...it's  EQ II...er EverCRAFT. Pretty much all rules have been changed so adventurers exist to provide items, and a market for the crafters. (virtually all crafted quested gear is now attuneable)
<br />

<br />
The only hitch is where the players will get the money to buy the crafted stuff. Maybe foraging to supply the crafters?
<br />

<br />
There, I feel better now....
<br />

<br />
One of the funniest things I have heard in EQII was a couple of weeks in some guy ranting in ooc about a quest..
<br />

<br />
&quot;I didn't make an ogre monk so I could put on my overalls and sh$tkickers and go out and farm!&quot;
<br />

<br />
I'd really like to find this guy and see what he has to say now, lol.
<br />

<br />
An interesting thread on the changes appears at:

<br />

<br />
I personally agree more with Ookami on pg 3, but the crafters make their point as well. (I pilfered the EverCraft thing from Ookami..)

Last time I checked, the game was called EverQUEST.... not EverCRAFT.

I've made the personal decision.... as have most of my guildmates... not to buy any crafted weapons or armor, since I see them as the main instigators of this patch. I hear alot of other people who are going to do the same. 
<br />

<br />
This has been a perfectly viable option for the game since day one, and still is. Crafters have been crying all this time because they were promised that their goods would be desirable, that crafting itself would be more interesting than previous RPGs, and would actually be a legitimate form of gameplay, even if they had no desire to go out and kill mobs. 
<br />

<br />
Until crafted items are BETTER than quested items, or named mob-drops, folks can and will play the game without concerning themselves with crafting or crafted items in any way. Now if a crafted item is at least comparable to the above-mentioned stuff, and is more affordable, then that is an option for the non-rich or time-limited player. 
<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">

Personally, I could now care less if all the crafters go backrupt after this patch. The patch makes NO SENSE whatsoever. 
<br />

<br />
In real life, if you make 100 thingamabobs and put them for sale and people but 50 of them, you might not sell the other 50 if the demand isn't there. Or you might have to lower the price to compete with someone else selling thingamabob's.... or yet another person selling their used thingamabob on eBay for a fraction of the new cost. 
<br />
</span></blockquote> 
<br />
Crafters have most certainly been affected by very real supply and demand issues. Most importantly, the markets get routinely flooded with stuff because crafters have to grind 50 zillion items to skill up, and there simply is not enough demand for those items. 
<br />

This has taken any shread of realism and tossed it out the door. I'll play for a bit more, but apparently, this game is designed to be centered around crafters, not the REAL players. 
<br />

<br />
Yes... REAL PLAYERS. Those who play a ROLEPLAYING game to actually ROLEPLAY. There is no roleplaying in crafting. Think so? Computer roleplaying games are inspired from tabletop RPGs (D&amp;D, Gurps, etc).... that's REAL roleplaying. Name a tabletop RPG based around crafting? You can't. It doesn't exist. 
<br />

<br />
Why? Because crafting is in the games for greed. To make coin. No other reason. Was Gandalf a crafter? Was Aragorn? Is that what they're remember for? Hmm... what about Drizzt? Robin Hood? The 3 musketeers? Zorro? El Cid? Fizbin? Tasslehoff? Tanis Half-elven? King Arthur? Sir Lancelot? Conan? 
<br />
</span></blockquote>
<br />
Here I must HUGELY disagree with you. Crafting has no place in High Fantasy? BAH. Let's take Tolkien, for example. Feanor created the Silmarils which changed the entire fate of the Noldor Elves. At the core of Tolkien's understanding of Good vs. Evil (along with other stuff) was the temptability of the Noldor toward evil because of their craftiness, and the extreme evil being total disregard of nature and living beautiful things for industry and desire for power. Furthermore, it is Tolkien's foundational underpinnings of Good vs. Evil, as he represented them, that make Tolkien's world so much more compelling than most of the other stuff you listed. 
<br />

<br />
To continue listing the importance of crafting in Tolkien's world... 
<br />

<br />
The dwarves were renowned for their smithcraft, making Mithril armors like the one that saved Frodo's butt on several occasions. Gandalf, Frodo, Aragorn... the ALL used named weapons that did NOT &quot;drop from mobs&quot; or were NOT the results of quests. They were all forged by various good-guys etc. The elven robes and rope that the 9 companions used were tailored in Lothlorien. The lembas, without which Frodo and Sam would have surely perished, were baked there as well, and are ONLY given by gift from elven queens (see also Beren and Luthien). Then there were those Rings of Power and all that... 
<br />

<br />
Yeah, crafting has no place in High Fantasy... ahem. 
<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">
<br />

<br />
No... no one cares about crafters. They're no heroic. They sit in the safety of some house/building and...er... make things. In real life, creating a suit of armor might MEAN something, as it protected a great knight (or at least, rich knight).... but it took MONTHS to make! Sometimes even longer on ornate pieces for nobles or kings. If it took MONTHS for crafters to make items, then fine... I agree that it should be attuneable, because literally, it would be fitted to that person and someone else larger or smaller would have a difficult time using it. People could give you orders and you could fulfill them... wow... how about that?! REALISM?! 
<br />
</span></blockquote>
<br />
The argument for realism is a non-argument when it comes to a fantasy game. Sorry. The question of &quot;attunable&quot; etc. is one of game economics, and while decidedly NOT of any RP value (is class balancing discussion of RP value? Not really. It's all about stupid numbers etc.) it is necessary to make a game that is fun for everyone who plays it. 
<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">
<br />
But it takes you a few hours at most... the equivelent of a game day. You're cranking it out in assembly line fashion at break-neck speeds. That means you're making it generic. It SHOULD fit mutliple people. You're making armor size S, armor size M. It's off the shelf stuff. It should fit TONS of people. But no.... somehow... the armor will only fit the person who buys it. 
<br />
</span></blockquote>
<br />
As for the time required to make stuff, it is actually considerable. As for how MUCH of the stuff one must make, that is dictated by the amount of xp gained from making it. I would LOVE to spend less time crafting and still progress. 
<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">
<br />
I think this is terrible change. I think it's a stupid way of compensating for their overzealour attempt to cater to those who want nothing more from an RPG than the accumulation of goods. Sorry.... I prefer to something loftier. I want to be the known as the one who slew the dragon invading the countryside, or the noble warrior who helped stand off a horde of invading orcs, etc. 
<br />
</span></blockquote>
<br />
As for the &quot;loftier&quot; goals of crafting, what if I told you that the crafters in my guild do NOT craft for profit-- EVER. What if I told you that NONE of us have sold a single item on the market? We do everything we do for one purpose: TO EQUIP OUR GUILD. We rather enjoy this challenge, and the level of teamwork it has required to pull it off. None of us are rich. Hardly. We craft ourselves broke all the time. 
<br />

<br />
The changes made to the sellback prices of stuff (NERF) was specifically to shut down the greedy macro-crafters, and it's just fine by me. It is no longer possible for certain crafting classes to MINT COIN (this is BAD for the game economy, mmkay) by simply grinding simple combines and vendoring the stuff. This was HORRIBLE for the game in a multitude of ways which would take entirely too long to explain. 
<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">
<br />
So what's the solution? 
<br />

<br />
Item Decay. Argh! Yes... I hear the moaning and groaning.... but it's both more realistic and more fair. Damage mitigated by armor subtracts from the armor's health. The worse shape armor is in, the worse the protection. Everytime it's repaired, it subtracts some from the full health of the armor until eventually, they'll need an upgrade. 
<br />

<br />
Does this screw tanks? Sure. But on the other hand, if you fought a dragon and took MAJOR damage and were just kept alive by the favor of a healer's god.... you would probably expect your armor... and weapons... would be in bad shape. 
<br />

<br />
You'd still have people buying new stuff all the time, because some people MUST have the best.... they won't settle for repaired armor. But at the same time, you might have someone who wears their's for a long time. And it does stand to reason that a suit of plate mail might not outlive a wizard's robe.... unless the wizard is constantly being beaten. 
<br />

<br />
The only thing I would do is allow Heritage or other important quested items to be repaired to their full health. This preserves some of their uniqueness and prevents people from loosing something that's supposed to be special in the game. 
<br />
</span></blockquote>
<br />
I would be fine with Item Decay. I agree completely that such a system would remove stuff from the game, giving crafters (and players selling dropped stuff) a market for their stuff, and would be more &quot;realistic&quot; than attuning everything. 
<br />

<br />
I have to say though, that your hostility toward crafting in general is unwarranted, and completely disagree with your assertion that it has no place in a fantasy world / game.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span><blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">The name change isn't official yet but thats pretty much the reality of it. So if you are into crafting and want a game thats all about crafting?...it's EQ II...er EverCRAFT. Pretty much all rules have been changed so adventurers exist to provide items, and a market for the crafters. (virtually all crafted quested gear is now attuneable) 
<br />

<br />
The only hitch is where the players will get the money to buy the crafted stuff. Maybe foraging to supply the crafters?</span></blockquote>
<br />
This game can TOTALLY be played without having ANYTHING to do with crafting at all.  Quested and named mob-drops are superior to most crafted stuff.  The coin gain from regular-old grouping is better than most crafters make.  (ESPECIALLY now that certain crafting classes that WERE able to mint coin have been nerfed).
<br />

<br />
Making everything attuned now will indeed create a better market for the crafters.  On the more mature servers, like Permafrost that I recently left, I was forced to offer my crafted Carbonite armors at barely more than cost.  The market was SO flooded with junk from people trying to level up, and SO undermined by the lvl 20 armor quests, that it was just plain stupid.
<br />

<br />
The danger that the game was headed toward was that crafting would end up being nothing but a money-sink hobby for rich, high level players, and most folks could play the entire game and never bother with crafted stuff (exactly what it is in eq1).</span></td>

I nearly busted a gut listing to some economics grad student try and tell everyone how it was gonna play out (in crafters channel ooc) the other day.</span></td>
