		<h4>Forpar's Mystical Lute</h4>
Baldric Slezaf tells you that Forpar Fizla has this lute but will not speak to him. You must get this lute as your final item to return to Baldric. This is rewarded as head, neck, body and strings. 
<br><br>
Forpar Fizla is unwilling to talk to you and even other gnomes. To get him to talk you help his friend, a female half elf bard named Vedico at the docks in Butcherblock. 
<br><br>
<img src="/images/epic/imgEpicVedicoWindwisper.jpg" alt="Vedico Windwisper" border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="right">
Vedico Windwisper may be found on the docks in Butcherblock inside one of the shops at loc (1010, 3010). She lost her horn to a cyclops named Quag Maelstrome in the Ocean of Tears. If you kill him, you will get the "Alluring Horn" which you then return to Vedico in Butcherblock. 
<br><br>
<b>You say,</b> 'hail Vedico Windwisper'<br>
<b>Vedico Windwisper says</b> 'Hello Kocho .  Have you seen the port master?  I am here to complain about the shoddy service.<br> 
<b>You say,</b> 'What shoddy service?'<br>
<b>Vedico Windwisper says </b>'I was sailing from Freeport on one of the boats when a giant cyclops attacked the boat!  No one lifted a finger as he stole the horn I was playing and ran off.  Someone here has to answer for the loss of my horn. <br>
<b>You say,</b> 'what giant cyclops?'<br>
<b>Vedico Windwisper says</b> 'He was a huge cyclops!  He came rushing up out of the water and stared at me with his big eye and said, 'Me like horn me take and play pretty music!' before he snatched my horn and disappeared back under the waves. 
<br><br>
Find Quag Maelstrom in the Ocean of Tears on the Seafury Cyclops island. I was all prepared to solo chant-kite him (I was 49 at the time), when a 45 shaman wanted to help me out. I knew I didn't need his help, but thought it couldn't hurt. We found Quag at loc (1914, -6600). He was blue to me, and I could see him carrying my horn, it was very obvious. The shaman buffed me all up quite nicely, and gave me a sow and a levitate. The cyclops island is crowded with cyclops of course, so I pulled him to a nearby island. I quickly found he could run almost as quick as sow, so I just kept running round and round the island, chanting at him all the way. The shaman sicced his pet on Quag's behind. Looking back, it was quite humorous. Quag kept casting mana drains at me, which I resisted all but one, not that it affected my bardic mana anyway. A few times he was able to hit me, but I cast snare on him, which fixed that.  When Quag did hit me, he hit anywhere from 30 to 117 points damage, but he didn't get close to me for the most part, only when I was dumb enough to turn around and look at him. I did use my Denon's Desperate Dirge, which hit him for 363 points damage. The entire fight took less than 7 minutes, and he dropped the Alluring Horn, a Pearl Necklace, and 4 plat.
<br><br>
Take the horn back to Vedico in Butcherblock and she will then give you a note to give to Forpar. 
<br><br>
<b>Vedico Windwisper says</b> 'Where did you find this?  I thought the cyclops took it.  I am in your debt Kocho.  This horn has always been special to me.'
<br><i>Vedico reaches into her pack and pulls out a note. </i>
<br>'Do you think you could deliver this to my gnome friend Forpar.  I have not spoken to him in a while and unfortunatly I will be unable to make the trip to visit him.  If you are looking to have an instrument made he is the man to ask. 

<br><br>
<img src="/images/epic/imgEpicForparFizfla.jpg" alt="Forpar Fizfla" border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="right">Head to Steamfont Mountains and find Forpar Fizfla hanging out in one of the windmills. His loc is (128, -600). He was apprehensive to me, so I had to use Cinda's Charismatic Carillion and then he was amiable to me. Hand him the note from Vedico and he talks about his mystical lute he can make.

<br><br>
<b>You say,</b> 'hail Forpar Fizfla'<br>
<b>Forpar Fizfla says </b>'Get out you pesky Half Elf!  I don't need any Half Elf germs!  Out, ye filthy beast! <br>
[<b><i>Play Cinda's Charismatic Carillion. Once he takes a liking to you, hand him your note.</i></b>]<br>
<i>Forpar Fizfla judges you amiably -- looks like he would wipe the floor with you!</i><br>
<b>Forpar Fizfla says</b> 'So you know Vedico!  How is the lass?  If Vedico would give you the time of day, you must be something special.  What can I do for you?  I hope you have not come to have me make another [mystical instrument]. <br>
<b>You say,</b> 'what mystical instrument?'<br>
<b>Forpar Fizfla says</b> 'I have made many mystical instruments in the past.  Each one seemed to be better then the last.  I have always had a dream of building the world's best lute, but I have yet to find someone brave enough to gather the components needed to make the instrument. <br>
<b>You say,</b> 'i can gather components'<br>
<b>Forpar Fizfla says</b> 'To make a mystical lute I will first need to make several pieces.  If you bring me the backbone of an ancient fishman, a strong tentacle from one of the long lost amalgyms, and a petrified skull of a lycanthrope I may be able to create the head and neck of the instrument.  If you go out and gather these things, make sure to bring me the note I gave you or I might forget who you are.  I am getting quite old, you know. 
<br>
[<i><b>Receive Forpar's note.</b></i>]
<br><br>
<b>Mystical Lute Head</b><br><br>
This is the next big part of the quest. Forpar tells you he is willing to make you an instrument, but only tells you how to make the Neck and Head of the instrument. From what he says above, the list of items he needs includes: 
<ol>
<li><b>Backbone of an Ancient Fishman </b> - Phinigel Autropos's spine (Kedge Backbone) from Kedge Keep
<li><b>Amalgym Tentacle</b> - Amygdalan Tendril from Plane of Fear 
<li><b>Petrified skull of a Lycanthrope</b> - Petrified werewolf skull from Karnor's Castle on Drolvarg Warlord 
</ol>
<img src="/images/epic/imgEpicPhinigelAutropos.jpg" alt="Phinigel Autropos" border="0" align="right" width="100" height="167" hspace="2" vspace="2">
<b>Backbone of an Ancient Fishman </b> - Off Phinigel Autropos in Kedge Keep<br><br>
<b>Phinigel Autropos</b> requires a well-organized group or two to take down, and be sure and bring a good puller and mezzer with you. If the pull is not 100% successful Phinny might bring some Swirlspine Guardians with him. Our 28th level Pixie Strike mezz will not work on the adds, so you need to have the 53th level song to mezz, or bring along an enchanter. 
<br><br>
It is recommended that the best combination of songs to mem for the Phinigel raid (if you have them) are: 55 Occlusion of sound, 53 Song of Twilight, 55 Cantana Replenishment and 3 Jaxon's Jig of Vigor. Of course keep the Enduring Breath song memmed as well just in case. The Occlusion of Sound is very useful in stripping the seahorses and Phinigel of their Magic resistance. The casters are better able to land their nukes. When the monk is pulling do not play songs as it will aggro more than one mob. If two or more come you will have to mez, but if the pull is successful, only one or two mobs will come. You might either spend the raid debuffing Phinny and his seahorses, or mezzing the adds.
<br><br>My guild has killed him 25 times, and about 5 times has a Kedge Backbone drop. Two groups seemed to be sufficient but a high level bard or enchanter is a must just in case the pull brings back Phinnie and friends. Phinnie's backbone will fit into any container that can hold medium or larger items, or so I'm told. The Eye of Zomm exploit has been fixed, so I will not cover that here, as it no longer works.
<br><br>
I do not have first-hand info on the Amalgym Tentacle nor the Petrified Skull, so please send me what information you have. I got my Skull from a train in KC where my group picked the Drolvarg Warlord off and killed him. Drolvarg Warlord is around level 53-54. Seems to drop about half the time.
<br><br>
<h3><i>Please send information if you have it regarding the rest of this quest... I have not done this part first-hand, so I will need the text from the conversation with Forpar from here on.</i></h3>
<br><br>
Take all 3 items and the note back give to Forpar and he gives you back the Mystical Lute Head (a single item containing the head and neck of the lute).

<br><br>
<b>Body of Mystical Lute</b><br><br>
When you receive your Head and Neck from Forpar, he will give you the quest for the body, which requires the following items: 
<ol>
<li><b>Large red Dragon Scale</b> - Talendor of Skyfire, Lord Nagafen or Ragefire in Naggy's Lair, or Nortlav Scalekeeper in The Hole
<li><b>Large white Dragon Scale</b> - Gorenaire of Dreadlands or Lady Vox's 
<li><b>Metal bit</b> (smithed metal bit) 
</ol>

<br><br>
<b>Mystical Lute Strings</b>
<br><br>
Finally, get the strings for the Lute - Trakanon Gut Strings. These drop from Trakanon himself (Level 65 dragon in Sebilis). There have been some recent changes to the quest. It seems that the Trak guts no longer drop from the regular Trakanon. You get another spawn of Trakanon to spawn by talking to the Undead Bard. The undead bard spawns 18 +/- 4 hours after Trakanon is killed. You turn in the lute body to him. He returns the lute body, becomes enraged, he needs to be killed (don't know his details off hand, but it's not unlike triggering ragefire). He is around level 55. When the enraged undead bard is killed, Trakanon spawns. This spawned Trakanon is not as strong as the regular Trak, I believe this is mostly due to not being buffed by jumpy. He drops Trak guts 100% of the time, and also drops a Trakanonian BP (random) but no teeth.
<br><br>
Also, a new update to the quest is that Nortlav Scalekeeper is a new source of red scales, he is in the Hole, same room as Master Yael, and he lifetaps and stuff. 
<br><br>

Finally, give the following lute parts to Foplar to receive the complete Mystical Lute:
 
<ol>
<li>Mystical Lute Head 
<li>Body 
<li>Gut strings 
</ol>
