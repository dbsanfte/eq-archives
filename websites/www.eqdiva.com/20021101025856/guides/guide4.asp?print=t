<h3>Rina's Guide to Bardic Hotkeys</h3>
by Gaeerina Dua'Mustela, Druzzil Ro <br><br>
You probably already know a little about 
hotkeys, but for those who are true newbies 
to EQ: In the lower left corner of your 
screen is a bank with 6 or 10 (depending on 
your layout) squares. 
<BR><BR>
These are your hotkeys. They are numbered 
from 1 to 10, and you have 10 banks of 
them. You can access other banks by typing 
SHIFT and the number of the bank you wish 
to access. 
<BR><BR>
To put something in a hotkey slot... simply 
click your mouse on the item, spell slot, 
social, etc, and hold down until it pops up 
onto your cursor. Then place it in the hotkey 
bank. 
<BR><BR>
EXAMPLE: If you hold your mouse down over 
the "SIT" button.... you can put the SIT 
command in box 1. Now, instead of moving 
your mouse over to click on the SIT button, 
you just have to type "1" to sit. Got it? :) 
<BR><BR>
That's the easy part. Now, as a bard, your 
fame will depend on how well you can twist 
your songs. It's darn HARD to twist if you're 
trying to click each song, especially if you 
want to look around or move during the 
fight! Thus, you'll want to set up your 
hotkeys so you can twist three songs simply 
by typing: "1....1....2....2....3...3...." 
<BR><BR>
Your mouse is free for looking around or 
moving. You don't have to be constantly 
looking at your spellbar to make sure you're 
clicking the right place. Your fingers do all 
the work for you! 
<BR><BR>
Switching 
between instruments and weapons is easier 
than ever! Need to be the enchanter for a 
minute? Switch to another bank, type 1 to 
charm, 2 for /pet attack! You won't miss a 
beat! 
<BR><BR>

Have your first hotkey bank set up for your 
melee slots and instruments, and set up the 
bottom four slots for your most commonly 
used songs. (A Note for bards who seldom 
melee: My #1 hotkey is now where I keep 
my mez song. A VERY handy placement, 
IMO.) 
<BR><BR>
Experiment with different layouts... you'll 
eventually find a setup that works well for 
you. Hotkeys are a MUST for bards who want 
to be the well-oiled machine that a group 
needs. Learn em, use em, love em!
