<br />
Some friends of mine decided that for &quot;progression&quot; they needed to join an EP flagged guild. 
<br />

<br />
I looked at the guild's website and they want you to submit an application, a completed magelo profile, and explanation of what you can do for the guild.  
<br />

<br />
I just want to know when the h*ll a fantasy roleplaying video game started requiring a cover letter, an application form, and a resume to play?  
<br />

<br />
The scary thing to me is that most people seem to consider this the norm and have no problems with this.  Does no one else consider this over the top? 
<br />

<br />
P.S.  I'm still pissed that during my friends' app phase they have to be available for all raids.  The guild in question doesn't announce raids; they go after &quot;targets of opportunity.&quot;  So for the next month or so of the trial period,  my friends aren't doing anything except XP'ing in Tactics in case a raid comes up.  
<br />

<br />
To my &quot;phat-lewt whore&quot; friends:  I hope it's worth it.  
<br />

				<td colspan="2"><span>If 50 or so folks are serious enough about the game to dedicate 4-5 hours a night to it, and make a guild,  then they have a right to work recruitment however they want.  If you think their recruitment policies are silly or to detailed, then dont join that guild, it is pretty simple.  It sounds to me like you are pissed at some folks who left your guild to progress in the game.  Every time anyone leaves a guild to jump to a &quot;higher tier&quot; guild, folks always get pissed.  It is a fact of EQ, it will always happen. 
<br />

<br />
 What really sucks is if folks leave immediately after a major milestone has been acheived (IE: RZ kill), or major piece of gear has been awarded them (Aten Ha Ra Neck, Cursed BP).  If that happens, then bitch away, Im with ya.  But if they just left your guild to progress in game, then the best thing you can do is send em a tell to keep in touch, say hi when ya see em in game, and continue on and enjoy the game without them.
<br />

<br />
All RPGs, online or offline, solo or MMPORG, share a common theme of character progression.  You start with a relatively blank slate, and build the character up through equipment and/or skill selections.  Doing the same thing over and over gets boring after a while.  EQ can be just a chatroom with pretty graphics if you want, but it can also be an engrossing and challenging game that rewards large groups of folks who spend time online working together.
<br />

<br />
Once you have beaten EMP SSRA a few times, or tore through NToV a bit, then going back again and again seems to go AGAINST the idea of role playing doesnt it?  I mean, you can get AA exp, but that is about it.  If you want to see Rallos Zek the Warlord, or Fennin Ro, you have to make the commitment.  If you want to equip you character with better gear, then you have to make the commitment.  Folks who spend a lot of time playing and learning to work together arent likely to just hand out flags to someone who spends a few hours a week in Bot.  You have to jump through some hoops, spend a lot of time in game, and risk alienating folks you used to socilaize in game with.  If it is worth all that, then you will send in the letters and magelos.

Sapper gave a real response that was thought out and well developed. He listened to what you said and responded.  If you don't like what he said, no harm done. But to be honest with 800+ posts he's been around long enough to deserve a bit more respect than you showed him.</span></td>

All of this takes like 5 min to write .   Those who lead these kind of guild need this info to know if the person is what they need.

Like it or not raiding is a large part of Everquest .  It may not suite your type of playing but it does for other.   Alot of people like to play this game in a more cooperative and strategic way ... it not always about riding coattails or whoring loot like you may think .

I don't see how guild-hopping to guilds that are in the farm stage of the next tier can be considered anything other than loot whoring though.

If you wanted strategic and cooperative play (if grouping is not enough for you), you'd stick it out with people in the similar situation and break through yourself.

From that statement I can see that you are not even willing to accept other peoples views on this subject.

The idea of a rant page is to post something that annoys you then others offer thier views on why it happens. If your not willing to take opinions - dont post.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Crewner, it's clear that you have different goals and expectations in EQ. Perhaps progression isn't a huge goal for you, but others want to really see all there is in EQ. And it's not just riding people's coattails.

<br />
I'm in an elemental raiding organization (not really a guild, but I'll call it one), and we progressed on our own, starting with little stuff like BoT towers (in fact, we started out with the goal of farming BoT towers), and now we've passed Xegony. Sure, we take new recruits, and see people leave for the even higher-end game, but that's the nature of things. We don't ride coattails, nor do people ride ours.
<br />

<br />
Your characterization of your &quot;friends&quot; as &quot;phat-lewt whores&quot; is pretty pathetic though. People join high-end guilds for all kinds of reasons. It's not like getting into one guarantees loot or anything. I've never spent a point in over a year of raiding, for example. People often want to see, and beat the toughest mobs, work together with 71 other people to win, others want to see zones that most people can't. Sure, loots are nice, but few and far between. I think you should try to understand what the high-end game is like before calling people interested in it &quot;loot-whores&quot; or anything of the sort.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>I have found that applications are a needed part to guild recruitment.  However, the type of application I am talking about focus on how the person plays, their personality and the such.  These types of applications let the guild know right off the bat the kind of person they are dealing with and an initial expectation during a probationary phase.
<br />
Some guilds go beyond this and require nearly corporate resume's and they're noses are just pegged into the content they're currently exploring and won't have anything to do with anyone slightly incapable of that content.  For some this is acceptable and they don't mind the scrutinization put upon them to experience that particular piece of content.
<br />
On the other hand there are others that want an environment not biased towards who has the better gear or who zerged what uber mob.  
<br />
The glorious thing about this game is that we all fit into different game play styles and those of common like tend to find eachother, hang out and form or join guilds of similar like.
<br />
Just because someone you have come to friend in game leaves a guild to play the game the way they want to does not neccessarily mean they have revoked their friendship with you.  You might not be a part of their main ciricle, but you can still remain friends and do things if you chose to.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Steppy, the funniest thing is, that &quot;guild&quot; URON, isnt even aguild really.  At least I havent seen anyone walking aroudn Quellious with a &quot;URON&quot; tag.  It is a consortium of guilded and non guilded folks who raid together a few times a week, maybe more.  They are very accomplished, well organized, and pretty much respected on our server, although some people consider them a &quot;guild&quot;, they really arent.  There are a lot of folks from different guilds, and unguilded folks as well, who join URON.  URON is a great way for folks to see content and Raid, while still remaining in a family type or smaller guild.
<br />

<br />
And to the original poster, I seem to have pissed you off somehow.  It was not my intent to make it seem like Raiding bards are superior to non raiding guild bards. 
<br />
I wholeheartedly agree with your statement: <i>&quot; I don't see how guild-hopping to guilds that are in the farm stage of the next tier can be considered anything other than loot whoring though. If you wanted strategic and cooperative play (if grouping is not enough for you), you'd stick it out with people in the similar situation and break through yourself.&quot;</i>
<br />
Folks that &quot;guild hop&quot; like that pay the price by losing the respect of some folks on the server.  Maybe having a large friends list isnt important to them.  After all, it is just a game.
<br />

<br />
As for me having &quot;fun&quot; I retired Sapper in April.  I brought him back last month, although I dont really raid much anymore.  I just log on a few times a week and screw off for a few hours.  Raiding stopped being a lot of fun after VT really.  PoP raids are all right up to RZTWL, but after that they take too long.  Anything longer then 2 hours is too long for me anymore.

Point of fact: The bards in Molto Espressivo on Firiona Vie are probably very under-equipped and under-AAd compared to high end raiding bards on Luclin, but I would bet good money they have more skilled bards, in general, because of the way they play and the experimental nature of ME's tactics.  If an FV bard transferred to Luclin and wanted to join my guild, I would be almost 100% certain to endorse giving them a try.</span></td>

Personally I don't know the majority of you from Adam.  However the seven people I know still playing the game have convinced me that I need your guild tag under my name since they have it under theirs.  This being the case I am submitting my application to you.  Take it or leave it.

<br />
As far as my playstyle, I see that you don't bill yourself as raiding guild.  That's a good thing.  Since you aren't, I figure I can put up with raids twice a week since everyone I know is raiding those two nights.  Generally I'd rather be pounding my head against a brick wall than doing a raid since they feel like the same thing.  Since you're a DKP instead of a NBG guild, who knows I might actually get something for my trouble.  
<br />

<br />
Since you're interested in how many AA I have, I have a buttload. If you don't like where I spent them, tough.

There's an honest app. Instead I wrote the usual crap that you see on guild apps.  I'm guessing that the majority of apps voted down (based on the application alone) was where the person was too honest.  
<br />

<br />
I left the guild once I realized that I really hated raiding. I only thought I disliked it before.  It's one of those pet peeves I guess where little crap bothers you more than it should, but there you go.

Honest it may be, but it's your honesty, which in this case lets someone into my group of people that I have gotten to know, and says 'hey, I really don't want to be here, but am riding the coattails of my friends lol, who do'.
<br />
Some of us were excited and happy to meet new people of a similar mind and game goals, working together as a unit to achieve things not able to be done alone. An application is to make sure you are of the same mindset, and have at least marginal survivabilty and usefulness in the places we are going to go.
<br />
Applications aren't dumb, but applicants can be heh. Applying to a raiding guild of any sort isn't your cup of tea, I agree. Sorry your friends bolted too. But hey, in a raid setting a single person can blow two hours invested, if it were your two hours, wouldn't you like to know the person you apped wasn't a total idiot? Since even as apps they are going to raids, you have to know a little about them.
<br />
Poeple who guild hop piss me off. Thats another part of it too though. By apping, the guild makes sure you have read their rules and agree with their goals, ergo you are where you want to be. Thats the idea anyways. People agree to it, then just pop up to the next level sometimes when they get what they want or the flag they needed.

You're right.  I couldn't have cared less.  I didn't  know them at all.  
<br />

<br />
The net experience with the guild in question was positive.  I told the guildleader my reasons for quitting ( I hate raiding.)  I was also told I don't need to raid to be in the guild.  Like I said I still play with people from the guild and enjoy their company.  So you could say the bullshit paid off.  Or if there hadn't have been an app and I'd just played with them a bit, the same thing would have happened.  
<br />

<br />
Seriously, what are you measuring by an app that you couldn't tell in game from playing with the person?  
<br />

<br />
The person's ability to bullshit?  Their english and grammar skills?  If you can tell me how that affects a person's ability to raid or be in a guild, I'd like to know.  From what I can tell from looking at some of the raid logs, it doesn't.  I can tell you that I can bullshit even though I've been on relatively few raids. h*ll, I've even been known to display moments of tact, discretion and even, god forbid, charm.  
<br />

<br />
I'd also like to understand the thing against apping to different guilds?  
<br />

<br />
So say a person wants to raid, wants to join a guild, maybe knows a couple people in one guild and a couple in another.  Why shouldn't the person app to both and give them both a try and see which one they like better?  Which one they would be more dedicated to?  Yet a lot of guilds have a policy of only apping to their guild.  Do you really believe that your guild is somehow more special than all the rest?  Or do you believe that someone is going to leak precious raid secrets that are published all over the Internet?  Or do guilds go out and hire HR consultants to set their policies?   /jk (sort of) 
<br />

<br />
BTW, I'm done ranting.  I'm really not trying to change anyone's mind from this.  This is turning into more of a bad psychology experiment gone awry.  Really, I'm trying to understand this.  I'm also leaving this weird-a$ cult before someone makes me drink the kool-aid.  
<br />

<br />
And I apologize, Sapper.  I did read too much into your post.

				<td colspan="2"><span>What can you tell from JUST the application. (Making the assumption that the person filling it out happens to at least TRY to be honest)
<br />

<br />
<b>The average daily/weekly/monthly playtime that person has</b>.
<br />
-- In a raiding guild, especially with the limits on total raid numbers, it's very important to know that the people that are applying to your guild are going to be able to devote the time that the GUILD needs them to for the greatest benefit. If a guild has a roster with 500 players that can only play 10 hours a week there will be no cohesiveness in style from one raid to another. People don't learn to play together, or to &quot;trust&quot; in each others play styles and abilities. This MAJORLY effects the GUILDS abilities on raids, and their chances for success. THe guild NEEDS to know that there will be at LEAST a solid core of individual that are present for the majority of all raids, and can help to pass on knowledge and strats to those that are &quot;more casual&quot; . If, for instance, a guild knows that they are usually shorthanded on bards that they believe they NEED on raids.. that guild is going to want to recruit the LEAST number of bards that they can that will still fill the role they need. AND they want to know that the bards they recruit are going to be around often enough to get a good handle on the guilds style , strats, and become someone that other people on the raid can trust. While your individual ability to play is a BIG factor your Playtime itself also matters.
<br />
When players are recruited/guilded that have a bare min of play time, that means you have to recruit MORE of a certain class in order to fill the role you need filled. Which also means that, at times those players are ALL going to be online at the same time.. and you are going to go &quot;over&quot; the max cap of the raid. Meaning people have to sit out and wait. No one LIKES to sit out. It causes stress and bad feelings at times, and can lead to even worse. So recruiting a player that has the playtimes as well as the classes that the guild feels it needs is very important.
<br />

<br />
<b>The number of AA's, and more importantly, WHAT AA's that toon has.</b>
<br />

<br />
-- what AA's you CHOOSE to purchase is all about you, and your personal choise. BUT a raiding guild needs to know that their recruits have the RAID NECESSARY AA's that go a long way tword making that toon much more useful on a raid. 
<br />

<br />
For instance, a bard without Jam Fest, and Insturment Mastery is going to have &quot;issues&quot; on a raid. That bards songs are going to be overridden by other bards on the raid that have it. That bards &quot;overall contribution&quot; on the raid is a lot lower than those that have those AA's. When you set up strats for a raid you need to know that this toon or that toon can step up and fill a role. Now the last thing you want to do is put your weakest AA'd bard on AE Resist duty IF the success fo the raid can hang in the balance. If every single bard on a guilds current roster has Maxxed those AA's than recruiting a bard that HASN'T maxxed them means recruiting 1/2 a bard. The things that you can take over, and assist with are effected. Same with Singing Mastery and the MT group.. and on into Ayonare's Tutalige, and the GoD insturment and singing AA's.. etc.. 
<br />
No guild can expect a recruit to be on par with the rest of the guild gear wise, but AA's are a measure beyond that. Everyone can earn AA's.. guilded or not. AA's ALSO further show the average playtime that someone has, or weather or not they use that time constructively. If a toon has been around since the Velious expansion came out, and yet they only have 70AA's, chances are that person has no DRIVE to imporve themselves, or at least not a drive comparable to what that particualr guild may want.
<br />
Now, even if you don't have the specific AA's that a guild may like you to have, if I can look at a glance and see that you have earned 300 AA's in less than 5 or 6 weeks then I have full confidence that you have some drive, and when the guild lays down its &quot;required AA's&quot; to join the guild can be fairly confident that you can/will get them in short order. 
<br />

<br />
<b>Do you have the ability to read, comprehend, and follow instruction?</b>
<br />

<br />
-- Yes, this is a factor in an application. LOTS of guild set up applications that have specific instructions attached with them. What steps you should take to apply, the order you should do those etc...  
<br />
Some people simply can't, won't or don't have the ability to follow clearly written instructions. If you can't follow a simple set of instructions on how to apply, and comply with them.. chances are when it comes to in game instructions, when there is not only a time pressure, but a guild counting on you to do your job and do it correctly.. you are again going to fail miserably.
<br />
We all had that one teacher in school that passed out a test for use to do. Written clearly in the instruction lines was something like &quot;Do only problems 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 14&quot; or &quot;complete ONLY the odd numbered problems&quot; .. same kind of thing. It's an observation check. If can't follow simple instruction and are NOT taking your application seriously, chances are you don't REALLY want to be in that guild, and therefore that guild doens't REALLY want you wasting their time, flags, raids, gear, or effort.
<br />

<br />
<b>Have you read the guilds Rules and Regulations? Have you read and understand that guilds charter? Do your personal goals fall in line with those of that guild? After reading the policies and procedures do you agree with them, or is there something there that you simply can't live with?</b>
<br />

<br />
-- Most applications (at least from a guild that is thinking ahead) link you to rules and regs, policies and procedures, looting policy, guild charters, etc ) There is a very valid reason for this. When you apply to a guild it's not only a decision about if that guild wants YOU, but also if you want that guild. If you read their charter and see glaringly that they are a hardcore raiding guild, and you hate raiding.. the is no reason what-so-ever for you to put in an application. You won't be happy, you will burn out. The guild won't be happy, and in the end it's not going to be the place for you.
<br />
Same holds true for loot policies. If you absolutely cant live with how that guild distributes loot, then don't even bother applying. Chances are, if you are applying to an established guild that has been around for any length of time they are not going to change a policy for YOU. In fact, they are more than likely going to eventually tell you to piss off and Boot you if you continually argue about some rule, or regulation that they have set up. It goes well beyond loot. 
<br />
The links to policies in the application are there for you to read, and AGREE to. Submitting your application says to the &quot;recruitment people/ Officers / Guild Leader&quot; that you have read their rules/policies/REQUIREMENTS and agree to them. You may not LIKE them, but you agree to abide by them.
<br />

<br />
<b>Listed requirements are often part of the application. On paper is the best way to straight forward make sure that recruits meet them.</b>
<br />

<br />
--Lots of guilds have a list of REQUIRED things you MUST have in order to join that guild. It may be a list of AA's, a level requirement, access to certain zones, certain pieces of equipment (such as a shrink device, or ability to gate, or a haste item etc) 
<br />
Those things are usually listed in the application, or in the ensuing policies that are attached to it. Pulling aside every single recruit that guild ever has and walking them through all the requirements on an individual basis is a PITA, and things CAN and sometimes DO get missed. By writing them all down and making sure that the person applying has access to them you aleviate the problem when someone says later &quot;well, I didn't know I had to have a gate item. Im stuck on the 4th island of PoAir, and even though you are calling a raid I can't come until someone comes and rescues me&quot; or some other such BS. The requirements are listed for all applicants. If you don't , can't, or won't comply to them-- don't bother applying.
<br />

<br />
That's just a FEW of the things an application does for a guild. Could these items be taken care of in game? Maybe, but its a h*ll of a lot easier for the guild to put them all in one place for everyone to see. It allows the members of the guild to glance at your application and see that you understand, agree to, and meet all the requirements. Now, when it comes time for you to begin raiding/grouing with them they can judge you &quot;play ability and you ability to &quot;mesh with the whole&quot; and not &quot;cause major waves&quot; with the rest of the team. You will have a chance as an applicant to prove your worth and make friends. And don't think for a second you aren't being scrutinized during your applicant period.
<br />
The application process streamlines a lot of information that the guild needs about you, and that you need about the guild so that the members of the guild can instead FOCUS on your ability to play, and your personality; as opposed to putting effort into making sure you are informed and comply to all the rules.
<br />

<br />
Don't forget one big thing. YOU are applying to join a guild. You are not useful in any way to a raiding guild if you don't have access to the zones they raid in. The guild you are applying to, or at least some of its members all have to STOP advancing through the &quot;new content&quot; (new to them) that they are doing so that they can turn around a backflag the recruits. YOU are asking 50-200 people to stop everything they are doing and help you catch up to them so that you can join the fold and be a part of the guild. The last thing any guild wants to do is WASTE time backflagging, gearing, teaching strats, etc to someone that is NOT serious about wanting to be a member. You are pissing away the time of a LOT of people by applying to a guild, and that guild SHOULD take steps to make sure you are serious about being there. Any guild that doesn't is asking for punishemnt and wasted time. 
<br />
So, that is the main use of an application. It's NOT an elitiest attitue in any way. That application is there for the sole purpose of passing along lots of information in 2 directions in a short amount of time, as well as weeding out people that are not serious about wanting to be in THAT SPECIFIC guild. Which is also the same reason many guilds don't want recruits that apply to multiple guilds. If you want to apply to some other guild; go do it. But DON'T waste the time of ALL the people that invest time into a recruit, expecting a new promising member to be added to the fold. It's disrespectful to everyone in the guild. Applying to ONE guild at a time and making a personal decision about weather or not you want to be in THAT guild, before moving on and applying to another is not too much to ask.
<br />

<br />
You personally may not find raiding to your liking. A lot of people, including me, play this game soley to raid. Meeting new challenges side by side with my friends and working out a strategy to beat an encounter is the reason I log on to play. I'm SERIOUS about raiding and advancing. I dont want to be handed ANYTHING. I want to be a part of a team that learns an encounter for the first time, develops a strat and learns how to implement that strat to finally win that encounter. A wipe out on a raid is no big deal. It happens to everyone when they are learning. Pushing through wipes and learning things from them although, is a REQUIREMENT. If your raid wipes, and you were not obserent enough to learn at least 1 thing, you aren't serious about wanting to be there. If you are the kind of person that hates raiding, and doens't want to be there, and considers raids &quot;wasting your valuable socializing time&quot; I personally don't want you in the guild I'm in. 
<br />

<br />
Every guild is different. Some are hardcore raiders. Some are simply family guilds that either never raid, or very seldom raid. Some REQUIRE every person online to come to a raid when its called. Some could care less if you show up or not. Some guilds are DRIVEN by loot, others are driven by a desire to win and advance. Some guilds condone or even celebrate foul mouths, training other people, stepping on the backs of others etc all in the name of winning an encounter. Some guilds take a back seat and bow out any time there is a dispute about a mob or other piece of content; and some guilds are just a band of friends that want to get together and exp, or more aptly chat and fart around, and exping is just a backseat excuse or in common activity that brings them together.
<br />
 You need to choose the guild that has the same goals and desires that you do. And the guild needs to choose the players that have the same goals and desires they do. It's a 2 way street, and the application is a WONDERFUL tool that can inform BOTH parties in advance if the guild is the right setting for you, and if you are the right player for them.
<br />

<br />
And lastly.. Bottom line.. If you don't like raiding, and you aren't driven to see new places, and defeat difficult encounters through teamwork and planning then DON'T APPLY TO A RAIDING GUILD. You can group with your friends any time they are free, even if you dont have the same tag under your name.</span></td>
