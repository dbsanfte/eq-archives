		<h3>Forpar's Mystical Lute</h3>
Baldric Slezaf tells you that Forpar Fizla has this lute but will not speak to him. You must get this lute as your final item to return to Baldric. This is rewarded as head, body and strings. 
<br><br>
Forpar Fizla is unwilling to talk to you and even other gnomes. To get him to talk you help his friend, a female half elf bard named Vedico at the docks in Butcherblock. 
<br><br>
<img src="/images/epic/imgEpicVedicoWindwisper.jpg" alt="Vedico Windwisper" border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="right">
Vedico Windwisper may be found on the docks in Butcherblock inside one of the shops at loc (1010, 3010). She lost her horn to a cyclops named Quag Maelstrome in the Ocean of Tears. If you kill him, you will get the "Alluring Horn" which you then return to Vedico in Butcherblock. 
<br><br>
<b>You say,</b> 'hail Vedico Windwisper'<br>
<b>Vedico Windwisper says</b> 'Hello Kocho .  Have you seen the port master?  I am here to complain about the shoddy service.<br> 
<b>You say,</b> 'What shoddy service?'<br>
<b>Vedico Windwisper says </b>'I was sailing from Freeport on one of the boats when a giant cyclops attacked the boat!  No one lifted a finger as he stole the horn I was playing and ran off.  Someone here has to answer for the loss of my horn. <br>
<b>You say,</b> 'what giant cyclops?'<br>
<b>Vedico Windwisper says</b> 'He was a huge cyclops!  He came rushing up out of the water and stared at me with his big eye and said, 'Me like horn me take and play pretty music!' before he snatched my horn and disappeared back under the waves. 
<br><br>
Find Quag Maelstrom in the Ocean of Tears on the Seafury Cyclops island. I was all prepared to solo chant-kite him (I was 49 at the time), when a 45 shaman wanted to help me out. I knew I didn't need his help, but thought it couldn't hurt. We found Quag at loc (1914, -6600). He was blue to me, and I could see him carrying my horn, it was very obvious. The shaman buffed me all up quite nicely, and gave me a sow and a levitate. The cyclops island is crowded with cyclops of course, so I pulled him to a nearby island. I quickly found he could run almost as quick as sow, so I just kept running round and round the island, chanting at him all the way. The shaman sicced his pet on Quag's behind. Looking back, it was quite humorous. Quag kept casting mana drains at me, which I resisted all but one, not that it affected my bardic mana anyway. A few times he was able to hit me, but I cast snare on him, which fixed that.  When Quag did hit me, he hit anywhere from 30 to 117 points damage, but he didn't get close to me for the most part, only when I was dumb enough to turn around and look at him. I did use my Denon's Desperate Dirge, which hit him for 363 points damage. The entire fight took less than 7 minutes, and he dropped the Alluring Horn, a Pearl Necklace, and 4 plat. I am sure there are other ways to kill him, I just prefer to chant-kite when I solo.
<br><br>
Take the horn back to Vedico in Butcherblock and she will then give you a note to give to Forpar. 
<br><br>
<b>Vedico Windwisper says</b> 'Where did you find this?  I thought the cyclops took it.  I am in your debt Kocho.  This horn has always been special to me.'
<br><i>Vedico reaches into her pack and pulls out a note. </i>
<br>'Do you think you could deliver this to my gnome friend Forpar.  I have not spoken to him in a while and unfortunatly I will be unable to make the trip to visit him.  If you are looking to have an instrument made he is the man to ask. 

<br><br>
<img src="/images/epic/imgEpicForparFizfla.jpg" alt="Forpar Fizfla" border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="right">Head to Steamfont Mountains and find Forpar Fizfla hanging out in one of the windmills, the second one from the druid ring. His loc is (pos 128, neg 600). He was apprehensive to me, so I used Cinda's Charismatic Carillion and then he was amiable to me. Hand him the note from Vedico and he talks about his mystical lute he can make.

<br><br>
<b>You say,</b> 'hail Forpar Fizfla'<br>
<b>Forpar Fizfla says </b>'Get out you pesky Half Elf!  I don't need any Half Elf germs!  Out, ye filthy beast! <br>
[Play Cinda's Charismatic Carillion. Once he takes a liking to you, hand him your note.]<br>
<i>Forpar Fizfla judges you amiably -- looks like he would wipe the floor with you!</i><br>
<b>Forpar Fizfla says</b> 'So you know Vedico!  How is the lass?  If Vedico would give you the time of day, you must be something special.  What can I do for you?  I hope you have not come to have me make another [mystical instrument]. <br>
<b>You say,</b> 'what mystical instrument?'<br>
<b>Forpar Fizfla says</b> 'I have made many mystical instruments in the past.  Each one seemed to be better then the last.  I have always had a dream of building the world's best lute, but I have yet to find someone brave enough to gather the components needed to make the instrument. <br>
<b>You say,</b> 'i can gather components'<br>
<b>Forpar Fizfla says</b> 'To make a mystical lute I will first need to make several pieces.  If you bring me the backbone of an ancient fishman, a strong tentacle from one of the long lost amalgyms, and a petrified skull of a lycanthrope I may be able to create the head and neck of the instrument.  If you go out and gather these things, make sure to bring me the note I gave you or I might forget who you are.  I am getting quite old, you know. 
<br>
[<i><b>Receive Forpar's note.</b></i>]
<br><br><br><br>
<h4>Mystical Lute Head</h4>
This is the next big part of the quest. Forpar tells you he is willing to make you an instrument, but only tells you how to make the Neck and Head of the instrument - the Mystical Lute Head. From what he says above, the list of items he needs includes (all these items are NO DROP): 
<ol>
<li><b>Backbone of an Ancient Fishman </b> - Phinigel Autropos's spine (Kedge Backbone) from Kedge Keep
<li><b>Amalgym Tentacle</b> - Amygdalan Tendril from Plane of Fear 
<li><b>Petrified skull of a Lycanthrope</b> - Petrified werewolf skull from Karnor's Castle on Drolvarg Warlord 
</ol>
<br><br>
<img src="/images/epic/imgEpicPhinigelAutropos.jpg" alt="Phinigel Autropos" border="0" align="right" width="100" height="167" hspace="2" vspace="2">
<b>Backbone of an Ancient Fishman </b> - Off Phinigel Autropos in Kedge Keep<br><br>
<b>Phinigel Autropos</b> requires a well-organized group or two to take down, and be sure and bring a good puller and mezzer with you. If the pull is not 100% successful Phinny might bring some Swirlspine Seahorses and Swirlspine Guardians with him. Our 28th level Pixie Strike mezz will not work on the adds, so you need to have the 53th level song to mezz, or bring along an enchanter. Try to pull the Swirlspine Seahorses one at a time, as they cannot be stunned, which means we cannot mezz them. Thankfully, the Swirlspine Guardians can easily be mezzed as a bard.
<br><br>
It is recommended that the best combination of songs to mem for the Phinigel raid (if you have them) are: 55 Occlusion of sound, 53 Song of Twilight, 55 Cantana Replenishment. Since this is an underwater dungeon, you might want to mem the Enduring Breath song just in case, and Jig (stamina) song if you are not level 55 yet. The Occlusion of Sound is very useful in stripping the seahorses and Phinigel of their Magic resistance. The casters are better able to land their nukes. 
<br><br>My guild has killed him 25 times, and about 5 times has a <b>Kedge Backbone</b> drop. Two groups seemed to be sufficient but a high level bard or enchanter is suggested just in case the pull brings back Phinnie and friends. Phinnie's backbone will fit into any container that can hold medium or larger items, or so I'm told. The Eye of Zomm exploit has been fixed, so I will not cover that here, as it no longer works.
<br><br><br><br>
<img src="/images/epic/imgEpicDrolvargWarlord.jpg" alt="Drolvarg Warlord" border="0" align="right" width="100" height="159" hspace="2" vspace="2">
<b>Petrified Werewolf Skull</b> - Off the Drolvarg Warlord in Karnor's Castle<br><br>
The <b>Drolvarg Warlord</b> spawns inside Karnor's Castle just below the Hand Room. He is around level 51 to 54, and will summon. (The Warlord also has a rare Harmonic Dagger drop.) His placeholder is a Drolvarg Bodyguard and, in fact, there are 5-6 that spawn in his room. There have been cases when I have seen more than one Warlord spawn at a time.
<br><br>
A good party in the Hand room can pull the Warlord when they clear all the mobs. I'd say 50+ for all, and you need a cleric and chanter for sure. He will drop the Petrified Werewolf Skull, I believe about half the time.
<br><br><br><br>
<b>Amygdalan Tendril</b> - Amygdalan Warriors in Plane of Fear<br><br><img src="/images/epic/imgEpicAmygdalan.jpg" alt="Amygdalan Warrior" border="0" align="right" width="150" height="196" hspace="2" vspace="2">
The Amygdalan Tendril drops from the <b>Amygdalan Warriors</b> in the Plane of Fear. These mobs spawn in various spots around the zone. Best thing to do is let the raid leader know you need the tendril at the start of the raid. It's a substandard Warrior weapon, so it likely won't be an issue. Commonly referred to as the "amy whip".
<br><br>
<br clear="all">
Take all 3 items and the note back give to Forpar and he gives you back the Mystical Lute Head (a single item containing the head and neck of the lute).
<br><br>
[<i><b>Hand Forpar his Note, Backbone, Petrified Skull, and Tendril</b></i>]
<br><br>
<b>Forpar Fizfla says</b> 'Wow! I didn't think a Half Elf like you would be able to gather all of those things.' Forpar rambles around and works with small tools for a good ten minutes before handing you a very fine looking lute head. 'Now, do you want to gather the next pieces for me?'
<br><br>
[<i><b>Receive Mystical Lute Head.</b></i>]
<br><br>
<b>You say,</b> 'What next pieces'
<br><br>
<b>Forpar Fizfla says</b> 'The next pieces are a little harder to come by than those. To make the body of an instrument that will last for ages to come, I need something very special. The scales of a big red dragon and the scales of a big white dragon will make it unbreakable, as well as giving it a unique look. Some metal bits will allow me to hold the body together. Please, if you gather up these things, bring them to me as soon as possible. I have not felt this good in years! 


<br><br>
<br><br>
<h4>Body of Mystical Lute</h4>
When you receive your Head and Neck from Forpar, he will give you the quest for the body, which requires the following items: 
<ol>
<li><b>Large red Dragon Scale</b> - Talendor of Skyfire, Lord Nagafen or Ragefire in Naggy's Lair, or Nortlav Scalekeeper in The Hole
<li><b>Large white Dragon Scale</b> - Gorenaire of Dreadlands or Lady Vox in Permafrost
<li><b>Metal bit</b> - 1 smithed metal bit, from smithing Tradeskill, trivial at 21
</ol>
The white scale can be a bottleneck for the bard epic, as it is usually the hardest item to get, in terms that your guild is either to old for Vox, or too young for Gorenaire. If you do obtain a white scale, you are very close to finishing your epic. Red scale has many sources, of which are relatively easy obtainable. A new update to the quest is that Nortlav Scalekeeper is a new source of red scales, he is in the Hole, same room as Master Yael, and he lifetaps and stuff. 
<br><br>Based on reported loot drops, a scale will drop about 50% of the time for Vox/Naggy, and 33% of the time, multiple scales will drop, I've heard up to 6 white scales dropping from Vox. Some mobs like Nortlav are pretty much guaranteed to drop a red scale, not sure about Talendar.
<br><br>
Once you have these 3 items, port over to Forpar in Steamfont.
<br><br>
[<i><b>Hand Forpar the red dragonscale, white dragonscale, and 1 metal bit</b></i>]
<br><br>
<b>Forpar Fizfla says</b> 'Wooooooo! You are doing a wonderful job, Kocho. I wish I could go out and gather these things myself.'
Forpar sits back down at his desk and pulls several very strange looking tools out. Eventually he looks up at you and says, 'The body is done! Only one more piece to go!'
<br><br>
[<i><b>Receive Mystical Lute Body</b></i>] 


<br><br>
<br><br>
<h4>Mystical Lute Strings</h4>
Finally, get the strings for the Lute - Trakanon Gut Strings. These drop from Trakanon himself (Level 65 dragon in Sebilis). There have been some recent changes to the quest. The Trakanon guts <b><i>no longer drop</i></b> from the regular Trakanon. 
<br><br>
<img src="/images/epic/imgEpicUndeadBard.jpg" alt="An Undead Bard" border="0" align="right" width="100" height="230" hspace="2" vspace="2">
You get another copy of Trakanon to spawn by talking to the Undead Bard. The undead bard spawns approximately 18 +/- 4 hours after Trakanon is killed, although he has spawned immediately after Trakanon is slain as well. It may be unnerving to setup a whole raid party not knowing whether the UDB (Undead Bard) is up or not. His approximate location is neg 2100, neg 700. A ranger could not track the Undead Bard until the raid party reached the location neg 1600, neg 200. This means tracking range seems to be about 700 units. In the Jugg's castle before reets, Jumpy was trackable, UDB was NOT. With bard tracking, the UDB will only be trackable from the bridge to the lair.
<br><br>
You turn in your epic lute body to him. He returns the lute body immediately (appears in your inventory), becomes enraged, he needs to be killed. He is around level 55-56. Ask to have Rune V cast on you, as the Undead Bard will hit hard, this way you can make it back to your group alive. When the enraged undead bard is killed, Trakanon spawns. He drops Trak guts 100% of the time, and also drops a Trakanonian BP or class chest item (random) but no teeth.
<br><br>
Here is how the conversation will go with your Undead Bard:
<br><br>
<b>You say,</b> 'Hail, An Undead Bard' 
<br>
<b>An Undead Bard says</b> 'Hail, Kocho . Are you perchance a minstrel?' 
<br>
<b>You say,</b> 'I am a minstrel' 
<br>
<b>An Undead Bard says</b> 'I, too, am a bard, or was rather. I have been cursed by that blasted pile of bones who calls itself, Trakanon' 
<br>
<b>You say,</b> 'who is Trakanon' 
<br>
<b>An Undead Bard says</b> 'He is the undead dragon who rules this realm. I came on a quest seeking strings for my new instrument.' 
<br>
<b>You say,</b> 'what new instrument' 
<br>
<b>An Undead Bard says</b> 'I sought to create a Magical Lute.' 
<br>
<b>You say,</b> 'what Magical Lute' 
<br>
<b>An Undead Bard says</b> 'One that would make me the greatest bard in all the lands! Are you on a similar quest?' 
<br>
<b>You say,</b> 'I am on a similar quest' 
<br>
<b>An Undead Bard says</b> 'Well then, I would ask you a favor for one in return. If I bring that cursed dragon here, will you kill it for me?'
<br> 
<b>You say,</b> 'I will kill it for you' 
<br>
<b>An Undead Bard says</b> 'Excellent. I have stayed here far too long and I wish to go to my eternal slumber. But before I do so, I ask for one last request' 
<br>
<b>You say,</b> 'what is your one last request' 
<br>
<b>An Undead Bard says</b> 'Give me the Mystical Lute Body you have. I will return it, don't worry. I only wish to hold an instrument one last time before I leave.' 

<br><br>
With your newly acquired Trakanon guts, head to Steamfont to meet your friendly little gnome again. Give the following lute parts to Foplar to receive the complete Mystical Lute:
 
<ol>
<li>Mystical Lute Head 
<li>Mystical Lute Body 
<li>Gut strings 
</ol>
