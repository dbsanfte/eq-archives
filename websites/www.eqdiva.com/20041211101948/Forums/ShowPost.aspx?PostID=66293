<br />

<br />
I did the herald and messanger turn in to the dragon then he says go find the mercaneries that the notes were going to. Is he talking about the first DN fight or something else? Because I saw some ogres in the geonid caves, about 6 of them and then a main named, that I had never seen before and assumed those were the mercanaries because the name was like &quot;a something mercenary&quot; i forget the name exactly. But since then I havn't seen them up at all and checked several times a day.
<br />

<br />
My apologies if this is something obvious and I'm not seeing it or if it has been posted before and I missed it, tried checking but didn't see anything, and thank you<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" /></span></td>

<br />

<br />
Lantaric`Dar may be found at +415, +3950 in the Wakening Land. 
<br />

<br />
You say, 'Hail, Lantaric`Dar' 
<br />

<br />
Lantaric`Dar glances down at you with an almost palatable indifference. Small wonder, considering his significant stature. 'I have better things to do then deal with you mortal. The <b>[children of Zek]</b> hunt this land, and they hunt for me and my kin. I advise you to stay away from both them, and their quarry.' 
<br />

<br />
You say, 'What children of Zek?' 
<br />

<br />
Lantaric`Dar lets out a deep growl. You can tell that your question has angered him. 'I find it impossible to believe you have come to this land know nothing of the children of Zek. Do not toy with me, I can see deep into your very soul if I so choose. Perhaps you are a <b>[spy]</b> sent by Tormax to find a weakness in the kin. If you are then both he and you are fools. No mortal will ever expose any weakness in the ranks of the claws.' 
<br />

<br />
You say, 'I am not a spy.' 
<br />

<br />
Lantaric`Dar lowers his massive head slightly and peers down at you. You notice a small spark of light emanating from his eyes and you find yourself completely unable to look away. You feel a benign presence gliding through your thoughts. 
<br />

<br />
Lantaric`Dar says 'Perhaps you speak the truth mortal. But the trust of the kin is not given lightly. You will have to provide some <b>[proof]</b> for yourself if you wish to gain my trust.' 
<br />

<br />
You say, 'What proof?' 
<br />

<br />
The smallest flicker of a grin crosses over Lantaric`Dar's draconic features. 'I was hoping you'd say that. There are three giants that act as heralds for Tormax in this region. Find them, kill them, and bring me their heads to prove your loyalty.' 
<br />

<br />
Kill 3 x A Giant Herald, level 65, elsewhere in the Wakening Land and loot a Storm Giant Herald Head from each. Bring back all three heads to Lantaric`Dar. 
<br />

<br />
Lantaric`Dar peers at the three heads for a moment. You might almost say he looks surprised. 'You have done well Wood Elf. You have gained a portion of my trust today. I hope you continue to impress me.' 
<br />

<br />
Lantaric`Dar raises his claw to your forehead. The sweat dripping into your eyes does not blur your vision enough to sedate the terror of having a dragon claw mere inches from your face. Lantaric`Dar makes a series of quick, precise motions and then lowers his claw. You feel a mystical energy shiver over your body. 'You have been blessed with my mark. If you <b>[continue to aid]</b> me I may see fit to further increase its power.' 
<br />

<br />
You say, 'I will continue to aid you.' 
<br />

<br />
Lantaric`Dar says 'Excellent Wood Elf. I have a matter that I believe you would be suited for. The children of Zek have been strangely silent over the last few days. While your attacks on the couriers certainly slowed them down, I suspect there is something else going on. If you can uncover what they're up to, I will be most pleased. The area around Kael Drakkel is most likely to yield information.' 
<br />

<br />
A Giant Messenger (in Waking Lands no loc as of yet), level 65, carries Kromzek Supply Orders. Kill the messenger (resisted nothing, did not summon, attempted to flee) and bring the orders back to Lantaric`Dar. 
<br />

<br />
Lantaric`Dar studies the orders for a few moments. 'Well done Wood Elf. This explains much of the giants' movements of late. This list shows orders for creating equipment for creatures closer to your stature then a giant. The Kromzek must be recruiting more mercenaries. Find the troop this order was meant to supply ______. There must be a reason for Tormax's new interest in mortal conscripts.' 
<br />

<br />
So far this is all I have been able to find. The 
<br />
An Ogre Mercenary 
<br />
Barbarian Mercenary 
<br />
Gnome Mercenary 
<br />
Human Mercenary 
<br />
Teir`Dal Mercenary 
<br />
Troll Mercenary  are for a diferent quest or use to be, Not sure who your soposed to kill there are a few others as well. But al of these seem to be mobs for the Sentry Kcor assinments. However Sentry kcor seems to have been removed so maybe these guys are it.

				<td colspan="2"><span>No I dont think they have anything to do with this quest. There is a new group of mecenarys in WL (I think theyre called Bonethugs, but all are ogres), and I think they are for this portion of the quest. 
<br />

<br />
You can find them in a cave on the southwest side of the zone but I do not think they can be soloed. I tried when I found them (normal chant kite) and got summoned as soon as it went below 96% health. Granted I was fighting the named at the time and did not have time to try a normal one. 
<br />

<br />
One day Ill get some guildies together, go lay waste to them all and let you guys know the details of them if they are for the quest but so far that is my best idea for this portion of the pre-non 1.0 epic quest.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Went and took the named mercenary down that he speaks of today (10/16).
<br />

<br />
First off if the bonethug mercenaries and the named arn't up, in the rockmen/geonid cave area, the west entrance the way I got them to spawn was by killing another messanger that lantric asked you previously to kill and turned in the note that it drops and that respawned the ogres.
<br />

<br />
Got them up and I was pretty easily able to get the Cristoc(the main named with the loot you want) single or with just 1 add(mezzable add), all the other mercenaries are lullable also using SSoQ. 
<br />

<br />
The actual fight with Cristoc was pretty simple, just attack and win, no ae's or anything like that from him, got him out of the cave into the flat area just before the entrance with no adds besides the mercenary that I forgot to lull but kept mezzed the entire time no problem.
<br />

<br />
The group was 70 paladin, 68 monk who was double boxing his 65 druid for healing and 68 bard(me), mostly upper elementals/time gear. Pulled Cristoc and paladin got aggro, requiem of time landed on him easily. Paladin threw in a couple heals now and then during the fight but druid kept him healed pretty easily. Forgot to ask how much he hit the tank for but he never hit me when i tried soloing him for over 600. The fight took a few minutes, was kinda slow since we didn't have great dps but we still had no problem finishing it off. Enrages at about 30% I believe it was, didn't check exactly but was around there.
<br />

<br />
You loot a note off Cristoc, &quot;a sealed note&quot; i think it was and bring it back to Lantaric for the following text...
<br />

<br />
Lantaric`Dar says 'Once again you have exceeded my expectations Zandiain.  Rarely have I encountered a mortal with your talents, in fact not since Baldric walked these lands.  But I digress, and we have more work to do.  For now, take this mark as a symbol of my trust.'
<br />
[Sat Oct 16 12:06:08 2004] Lantaric`Dar  raises his claw once again to your forehead.  The sweat rolls a little slower this time, as you have grown more comfortable with his massive scaled form.  His claws make a quick methodical series of movements across your forehead again.  You feel a slightly familiar energy flow through to every part of your body and then subside.
<br />
[Sat Oct 16 12:06:08 2004] Lantaric`Dar says 'Travel boldly Zandiain.  For you move under my protection.  Your latest discovery has left me with even more questions to be answered.  The letter you brought seems to indicate that the mercenaries were meant for two purposes.  I want you to investigate the less puzzling of the two, which was to escort several emissaries from the Iceclad Ocean to Kael Drakkel. The emissaries are due to arrive soon.  I have sent one of the kin to the Iceclad Ocean to keep track of their movements.  But I suspect he will need you there to help him.  Find Vas Thorel in the Iceclad Ocean and do what he asks.  We are getting closer to the bottom of this mystery Dark Elf.'

<br />

<br />
[Tue Sep 28 23:37:23 2004] You say, 'Hail, Lantaric`Dar'
<br />
[Tue Sep 28 23:37:23 2004] Lantaric`Dar  glances down at you with an almost palatable indifference.  Small wonder, considering his significant stature.  'I have better things to do then deal with you mortal.  The [children of Zek] hunt this land, and they hunt for me and my kin. I advise you to stay away from both them, and their quarry.
<br />
[Tue Sep 28 23:37:35 2004] You say, 'what children of zek ?'
<br />
[Tue Sep 28 23:37:36 2004] Lantaric`Dar  lets out a deep growl.  You can tell that your question has angered him.  'I find it impossible to believe you have come to this land know nothing of the children of zek.  Do not toy with me, I can see deep into your very soul if I so choose.  Perhaps you are a [spy] sent by Tormax to find a weakness in the kin.  If you are then both he and you are fools.  No mortal will ever expose any weakness in the ranks of the claws.
<br />
[Tue Sep 28 23:37:41 2004] You say, 'what spy ?'
<br />
[Tue Sep 28 23:37:41 2004] Lantaric`Dar  lowers his massive head slightly and peers down at you.  You notice a small spark of light emanating from his eyes and you find yourself completely unable to look away.  You feel a benign presence gliding through your thoughts.
<br />
[Tue Sep 28 23:37:41 2004] Lantaric`Dar says 'Perhaps you speak the truth mortal.  But the trust of the kin is not given lightly.  You will have to provide some [proof] for yourself if you wish to gain my trust.'
<br />
[Tue Sep 28 23:37:54 2004] You say, 'what proof ?'
<br />
[Tue Sep 28 23:37:54 2004] The smallest flicker of a grin crosses over Lantair`Dar's draconic features.  'I was hoping you'd say that.  There are three giants that act as heralds for Tormax in this region.  Find them, kill them, and bring me their heads to prove your loyalty.
<br />

<br />
Kill 3 * a Giant Herald in Wakening Land and loot 3 heads. This can be done solo easily. Use track ...
<br />
--You have looted Storm Giant Herald Head.--
<br />

<br />
Hand the 3 heads to Lantaric`Dar.
<br />

<br />
[Tue Sep 28 23:38:27 2004] Lantaric`Dar  peers at the three heads for a moment.  You might almost say he looks surprised. `You have done well Half Elf. You have gained a portion of my trust today.  I hope you continue to impress me.
<br />
[Tue Sep 28 23:38:27 2004] Lantaric`Dar  raises his claw to your forehead.  The sweat dripping into your eyes does not blur your vision enough to sedate the terror of having a dragon claw mere inches from your face.  Lantaric`Dar makes a series of quick, precise motions and then lowers his claw.  You feel a mystical energy shiver over your body. `You have been blessed with my mark.  If you [continue to aid] me I may see fit to further increase its power.
<br />
[Tue Sep 28 23:39:26 2004] You say, 'how continue to aid ?'
<br />
[Tue Sep 28 23:39:26 2004] Lantaric`Dar says 'Excellent Half Elf.  I have a matter that I believe you would be suited for.  The children of Zek have been strangely silent over the last few days.  While your attacks on the couriers certainly slowed them down, I suspect there is something else going on.  If you can uncover what they're up to, I will be most pleased.  The area around Kael Drakkel is most likely to yield information.'
<br />

<br />
Kill a Giant Messenger and loot orders. This can be done solo easily. I found messenger both near dragon portal and near Lantaric. Use track ...
<br />
--You have looted Kromzek Supply Orders.--
<br />

<br />
Hand orders to Lantaric`Dar.
<br />

<br />
[Tue Sep 28 23:56:48 2004] Lantaric`Dar  studies the orders for a few moments. `Well done Half Elf.  This explains much of the giants' movements of late.  This list shows orders for creating equipment for creatures closer to your stature then a giant.  The Kromzek must be recruiting more mercenaries.  Find the troop this order was meant to supply Chorus. There must be a reason for Tormax's new interest in mortal conscripts.
<br />

<br />
Note : the bonethug will spawn in geonid caves when giving the giant messenger's orders to Lantaric. If you don't find the Bonethug, just kill another giant messenger and give orders again to Lantaric to spawn Bonethug.
<br />
Kill Cristoc Bonethug and loot note. This fight can be done with 3 people : bard, tank, healer. You can single pull Cristoc just lull 5 Bonethug and pull Cristoc away single. Caution, Cristoc does summon. He is a pure tank.
<br />
--You have looted a sealed note.--
<br />

<br />
Give note to Lantaric`Dar.
<br />

<br />
[Sat Nov 13 00:09:08 2004] Lantaric`Dar says 'Once again you have exceeded my expectations Chorus.  Rarely have I encountered a mortal with your talents, in fact not since Baldric walked these lands.  But I digress, and we have more work to do.  For now, take this mark as a symbol of my trust.'
<br />
[Sat Nov 13 00:09:08 2004] Lantaric`Dar  raises his claw once again to your forehead.  The sweat rolls a little slower this time, as you have grown more comfortable with his massive scaled form.  His claws make a quick methodical series of movements across your forehead again.  You feel a slightly familiar energy flow through to every part of your body and then subside.
<br />
[Sat Nov 13 00:09:08 2004] Lantaric`Dar says 'Travel boldly Chorus.  For you move under my protection.  Your latest discovery has left me with even more questions to be answered.  The letter you brought seems to indicate that the mercenaries were meant for two purposes.  I want you to investigate the less puzzling of the two, which was to escort several emissaries from the Iceclad Ocean to Kael Drakkel. The emissaries are due to arrive soon.  I have sent one of the kin to the Iceclad Ocean to keep track of their movements.  But I suspect he will need you there to help him.  Find Vas Thorel in the Iceclad Ocean and do what he asks.  We are getting closer to the bottom of this mystery Half Elf.'
<br />

<br />
Go to Iceclad at very south edge of island after bridge to EW. You will see a black drake like mob who is Vas Thorel (Loc -5612, 8636).
<br />

<br />
[Sat Nov 13 00:59:40 2004] You say, 'Hail, Vas Thorel'
<br />
[Sat Nov 13 00:59:41 2004] Vas Thorel  eye's your curiously. 'Greetings Chorus.  What brings you to this frigid place?'
<br />
[Sat Nov 13 00:59:45 2004] You say, 'lantaric dar'
<br />
[Sat Nov 13 00:59:45 2004] Vas Thorel  flashes a sly grin at you.  'So you're the one that's impressed Lantaric`Dar.  We'll soon see whether his faith is ill conceived.  The emissaries have just arrived at the portal to the south.  Several of the mortal races are represented in their ranks.  I suspect the Kromzek are attempted to recruit aid for a rather large mystical undertaking.  Although for exactly what I don't know.  They were lingering at the portal last I saw, no doubt waiting for the escort that isn't coming. Vas Thorel grins at you again.
<br />
[Sat Nov 13 00:59:45 2004] Vas Thorel says 'No doubt Tormax has by now learned that his mercenaries are dead and has dispatched another escort.  Perhaps the new escort will have further information on what he's planning.  Follow the emissaries towards Kael and keep your eyes open for a Kromzek Escort.  We can't go leaving those necromancers alive if they're going to be helping the Kromzek.  Bring me any information you find.  Oh yes, I'm sure Lantaric will want their heads as proof of their involvement.'
<br />

<br />
The Kromzek Escort will spawn in front of the bridge to Eastern West. It's composed of 1 named giant, 4 necro and their pet and 6 Frost giant Escort.
<br />
We did it with 8 people : 1 bard, 1 cleric, 1 warrior, 1 wizard, 2 mage, 1 shaman, 1 druid all level 70 and well stuffed (EP and more).
<br />
But we didn't know what we would find and I'm sure that with a single group (bard, tank, cleric, wizard, shaman, mage) we can handle the fight.
<br />
Anyway, the most important in this fight is the tactic used.
<br />
Have the bard go in back of the escort and lull the 6 Frost giant escorts then pull with a NO DAMAGE spell the 4 necro and named giant.
<br />
The bard just has to run around the 5 mobs and use psalm of veeshan amplified and some HP regen times to times. Refresh selo or ask a SOW before.
<br />
Necro will try to snare dot root you so have very high resists to magic.
<br />
Necros and named giant summon that's why you must avoid to damage them else summon and pif paf pouf new bard's juice brewing recipe.
<br />
While you are running around this 5 named, your group will tag them one by one and kill them. Beware they gate (remember the 6 escorts waiting at bridge) thanks to wizard's mega nuke to finish them without gate.
<br />
Don't run to close to your group to avoid aggro transfer and adds on your group.
<br />

<br />
Kill the 4 necros :
<br />
Puella Opalis
<br />
Amilia Verisue
<br />
Locis V`Sek
<br />
Nihilist Xeegarn
<br />

<br />
Kill the named giant Noble Oldencamp
<br />

<br />
Finally kill the 6 A frost giant escort just for pleasure.
<br />

<br />
Loot the 4 necro's heads and the lettre on the named giant
<br />
--You have looted a Puella's Head.--
<br />
--You have looted a Amilia's Head.--
<br />
--You have looted a Locis' Head.--
<br />
--You have looted a Xeegarn's Head.--
<br />
--You have looted a Sealed Kromzek Scroll.--
<br />

<br />
Hand a Sealed Kromzek Scroll to Vas Thorel.
<br />

<br />
[Sat Nov 13 01:01:11 2004] Vas Thorel says 'Well done Half Elf, but I'm afraid this scroll bears ill tidings indeed.  Lantaric must be informed with haste.  Take the heads of the necromancers and give them to Lantaric.  I have a feeling your work is far from done Half Elf.'
<br />

<br />
Hand the 4 necro's heads to Lantaric`Dar.
<br />

<br />
[Sat Nov 13 01:05:58 2004] Lantaric`Dar  peers at the heads.  `So the giants have asked for the aid of many of the young races.  It is no secret that the giants have had little luck with the dark arts of necromancy.  The presence of these necromancers, the sealed note you recovered, and the mercenary orders all point to one place, the Necropolis of my ancestors.  I fear they plan to desecrate our sacred burial grounds.  This can not be allowed.  You must travel to the Necropolis and stop them Chorus.  But first, accept my gratitude, and a strengthening of enchantment that protects you.
<br />
[Sat Nov 13 01:05:58 2004] Lantaric`Dar  raises his claw to your brow once more.  This time, you stand confident with the razored claws mere inches from your eyes.  The familiar motions flash across your eyes again, and a feeling of renewed confidence beats in your chest.
<br />

<br />
Here you are at same point than lucky bard wearing Epic 1.0.

I'll give a post once I finish Epic 1.5.</span></td>
