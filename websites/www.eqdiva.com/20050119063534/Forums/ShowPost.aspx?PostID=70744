				<td colspan="2"><span>I'm sure as many of you know, before OoW came out, we were told
<br />
that the songs on lucy were just placeholders, and that by the 
<br />
time OoW would come out, we would have lots of new songs as
<br />
well.  Then OoW came out and every song that was a placeholder
<br />
actually was our OoW song and it really seems that there should
<br />
have been new songs but that it was somehow left unfinished.
<br />

<br />
Other classes got their spells, and there is a distinctive feel or
<br />
style that OoW brought to new spells.  That style is completely
<br />
absent from bard songs.  Because I have no life, have played a
<br />
bard for over 5 years, and also play other classes at high levels,
<br />
and did I mention I have no life, I decided to take it upon myself
<br />
to attempt to reconstruct a list of OoW songs that would fit the
<br />
style of the expansion a lot more than what we currently got.
<br />

<br />
So here it is, an eqdiva exclusive,

If Sony just didn't have a bard guy to come up with ideas, here's
<br />
a bunch of them that are in theme with that other classes got.

<br />
Did you look at the upgrades other classes got?
<br />

<br />
I mean some of that stuff looks really nice, but consider balance as an issue.
<br />

<br />
Snare would have been too powerful for single pulling creatures that are normally nearly impossible to single pull. The mez just makes chanters look even worse. A bard can mez adds while running them to the group. A chanter just gets raped if they gain aggro on mezzing (Yeah I know they have runes, but that won't help at all in some zones).
<br />

<br />
You listed a lot of songs that we didn't really need an upgrade for. Psalm of Veeshan is already very powerful, same with Harmony of Sound (Yelhun's Mystic Silence would be insane with instrument mods added on, and Silence seems too powerful).
<br />

<br />
Also did we really need more haste? Currently as is with our songs, people with 40 percent or greater haste items won't get anymore benefit. No reason to increase haste on our songs more (Item Haste + Spell/Song Haste Cannot exceed 100%; Then Add Overhaste/&quot;version 3 haste&quot;).
<br />

<br />
I think only shamans should get spells which increase the stat cap, as they're supposed to be the best stat buffers in the game. Did you see how it was for them before OoW Released?
<br />

<br />
Well those are just some of my thoughts. I'm sure others may think about it differently.</span></td>

<br />
These same bards would be in groups where 200hp a tick would be
<br />
the bare minimum for them to even have a chance to notice that
<br />
the song is playing.  Do you know how much the Heal over Time
<br />
spells do now a days on a crit?  The Highest mod is 4.2 and I
<br />
did consider it when picking my numbers.

Thank you, and yes I do believe other classes would also need
<br />
to get some upgrades. 
<br />

<br />
Ok, I agree with snare as I put it up there would be open to
<br />
abuse.  Perhaps instead of modeling it after RoTime I should 
<br />
focus on AAssonance, the dot component should reduce pulling
<br />
abuses, but we would still benefit from not having to snare over
<br />
and over and over.  
<br />

<br />
I disagree with your mez comment tho.  I believe chanters have
<br />
a big edge on crowd control and bards need help.  If I have the
<br />
option of mezz'ing adds while running them to the group I'll 
<br />
choose to single pull instead.  I'm talking about using mez when
<br />
there are no other options, and in OoW getting a mez resist on
<br />
a seemingly trash mob that it should land on often means the
<br />
death of a groupmember.

<br />

<br />
Psalm of Veeshan is very powerful yes.  It's a group song.  The
<br />
one I listed is an AE song.  We haven't had an upgrade to AE
<br />
resist songs since forever.  The new AE song would not stack
<br />
with veeshan.  It would also block guardian rythmns.  It would
<br />
increase the resist stat cap by as much resists as its pumping
<br />
so that even people who already are capped on resists will see
<br />
a difference.  It would stack with the old AE songs so that
<br />
people who aren't near the caps for resists would see a huge
<br />
bonus from a bard playing these songs.  It's the same relative
<br />
bonus people used to see when bards played the AE resist songs
<br />
when they first came out, and I'd like that limelight
<br />
back.
<br />

<br />
Harmony of Sound is useless as a 3 tick song.  The upgrade I
<br />
proposed would validate bards as a debuffer on raids, as well
<br />
as facilitate the job of slowing mobs in groups when no other
<br />
slower present.  Snare as well.
<br />

<br />
Silence, although powerful, is something I always fancied bards
<br />
getting.  The limit to being cast on mezzable mobs only balances
<br />
it well in conjunction with the 2 minute recast.  3 Ticks is
<br />
really not all that long, and I'm sure some people would find it
<br />
weak!

<br />

<br />
A lot of people never actually got the 40 percent or greater 
<br />
haste items, and are stuck/satisfied with 34/36 percent worn
<br />
haste.  This is why the best chanter haste is 66 percent, as far
<br />
as I know.

<br />

<br />
This part has me a bit confused.  If I understand this correctly,
<br />
you believe that overhaste (a stat that goes passed the cap)
<br />
is not something bards should have?
<br />

<br />
Bards are the original cap busters, and in a cap busting, chance
<br />
to crit increasing expansion not only should we have songs of
<br />
that type but we should be dominating the field!
<br />

<br />
I really appreciate you taking the time to respond to my crazy
<br />
post, and I already changed the snare on my list.  Will post a 
<br />
revised list if for some reason people feel nice enough to
<br />
comment on it as well <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />

Certainly, some may argue the power of the raw numbers (mathematics) involved with some of your songs (although, I feel the numbers are pretty close to target), not very many of us are likely to argue that the song-set you've posted aren't <b>DEFINITELY</b> intersting.

Thank you very much, both to you and Treeble for posting
<br />
comments, I really appreciate it.
<br />

<br />
If the amount of debuffage is already too much, then why did both
<br />
chanters and shammy get a cripple upgrade?  Chanters also got a
<br />
new focus effect that reduces aggro on tash by half.  As a known
<br />
debuffing class a new HoS that covers Disease/Poison is the least
<br />
we could ask for.  Plus since it doesn't stack with HoS it can't be
<br />
that bad.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
A tradewind is something both boats and plane use to get a bit
<br />
more bang for their buck.  Even in a football game if you have
<br />
the wind behind you, as a quarterback your throws are going to
<br />
go further.  Right now, other than mana song (most don't even
<br />
know there's an hp regen component) non-nuking casters have
<br />
no reason to want a bard in their group.  Tradewind would give
<br />
shammy/cleric/druid a reason to say &quot;let's get a bard!&quot; so that
<br />
they could get a bit more out of heals.
<br />

<br />
The comment about Talisman of Sense has me a bit confused.
<br />
The song I used that acts in a somewhat similar fashion is
<br />
Verses of Vesargran.  It's actually a song we got in OoW, it is
<br />
just too weak in its current form.  Verses mitigates incoming
<br />
spell and melee damage.  Sense actually increases avoidance
<br />
percentage.  Two different aspect of defense completely.  
<br />
There are other spells that are like Verses of Vesargran, and
<br />
chanters are the ones who got them.  Chanters also got two
<br />
types of new runes to cast on self and group.  Even rangers
<br />
got a new buff that decreases aggro when mob hits you (Ok,
<br />
so rangers also need a lot of help with OoW spells, don't get
<br />
me wrong).  Shammies did not get a new agility upgrade.  They
<br />
can bust the cap on strength, dexterity, and stamina.  So
<br />
getting a new agility buff (we already have agility songs, but
<br />
haven't gotten an upgrade in a long time) seems only natural
<br />
to me, and by breaking the cap it completes the new theme of
<br />
OoW of reaching new highs in all stats.  (as an aside, I believe
<br />
rangers should have received a bust breaking agility buff, with a
<br />
stackable 3-5 percent improved heals component).
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">I also disagree with the AE PoV. Its way too powerful for the first part. On the other hand it destroy bard stackability/desirability on raids, which is already very low. </span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
The new AE resist song will not be as powerful as PoVeeshan
<br />
in the main tank group.  Therefore it will not steal the MT group
<br />
bard's job.  By not being as powerful as a song (or even Veeshan
<br />
+guardian rythmns combo), I don't believe it can be classified as
<br />
way too powerful.  It will stack with either Purifying chorus of
<br />
Elemental chorus, therefore preserving the job of the AE resist
<br />
bard on raids, so I don't believe it reduces bard stackability or
<br />
desirability on raids, but I completely agree that it is already
<br />
very low, and this is one of the songs that I felt addressed that
<br />
problem.
<br />

<br />
One of the roles of bards on raids used to be AE resists.  When
<br />
these songs first came out, the resist caps were 255.  With the
<br />
gear available, most people hovered between 100-150 resists
<br />
with buffs at raids.  Bards would double their current saves, and
<br />
bring them to the cap.  People would blatantly see the difference
<br />
of how many things land on them when a bard is there and when
<br />
one isn't.  People wanted bards at raids, or refused to raid 
<br />
certain targets if bards weren't there to play resists.  With the
<br />
resist caps being 525 (pre AA's) at level 70, playing the old AE
<br />
resist songs nowadays definitely does NOT have the same effect
<br />
it used to.  It's mathematical, the proportion that 140 ish to
<br />
saves when there's a 255 cap, vs. the proportion of 180 ish to
<br />
saves when there's a 525 cap.  Then there's also the factor that
<br />
resist gear used to be hard to come by, whereas nowadays a lot
<br />
of people don't need AE resist songs at all because they already
<br />
are at the cap and see no effect.  I strongly believe that a new
<br />
AE resist song that stacks with the old ones is a very good 
<br />
solution to bring back the role of the AE resist bard on raids.  If
<br />
you compare the ratios now 140/255 vs. 180+180/525(705) it
<br />
seems to me that it's much more in line with what it used to be
<br />
than what it currently is.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
We used to get completely off the wall songs that made playing
<br />
a bard unique and fun.  This song was my hommage to that, I
<br />
liken it to DA song or Gate song; a situational song that can be
<br />
very powerful or very useless.  Use sparingly, with a bit of salt!
<br />

<br />

We should have definatly recieved an AE chromatic resist song.  It should not stack, otherwise it would have to be too weak to be usefull.

We should have recieved the duration snare and resist debuff songs we've been asking for all this time.

We should have recieved a melee/spell rune song that is both twistable and worth using.

Our 3 garbage rizlona upgrades (OOPS 1 is a downgrade, 1 is identical) should have had added effects like healing focus or improved criticals.  (mages and wizards dont even need the dmg focus anymore, they have self focus that is as good or better).

adding more utility songs like the 3 tick silence would be awesome.  I was so excited about the 9th spell slot, but unfortunatly we didn't recieve any songs worthwhile for that slot.

That is a very good point, I mistakenly confused the earlier mez
<br />
songs with resist adjustment (Dreams of Anyonae) with the one
<br />
that had a debuff component (Sionache's Dreams, Pixie Strike).
<br />
In a revised list I would go with a static -10 resist check, and

a magic debuff component that would facilitate keeping the mob
<br />
mezzed once it initially lands, like we used to be able to. (As an

aside, I also just found out that chanters get a new focus that
<br />
decreases all aggro they gain from any entrall spell, so bards are
<br />
in dire need of help in the CC department).

<br />
</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
If the new AE chromatic resist song raises caps as well as the
<br />
stats, it does not have to be weak to be useful while being
<br />
allowed to stack with the other two AE songs.  It will be over
<br />
written by PoVeeshan, and it will block Guardian Rythmns.  In
<br />
my mind it is the direct upgrade to guardian rythmns, there is
<br />
no reason we should be playing a lvl 18 song at raids.  Perhaps
<br />
it could be tweaked a little, by keeping the MR the same but
<br />
lowering the FR/CR/PR/DR by 15 or so.
<br />

<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">We should have recieved the duration snare and resist debuff songs we've been asking for all this time. </span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
I completely agree with you.  I also believe that by keeping a
<br />
DoT component on the snare, you can prevent a lot of pulling
<br />
abuses that bards would do with a duration snare, which seems
<br />
to be the overwhelming cause of the ninja nerf right before OoW
<br />
went live.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">We should have recieved a melee/spell rune song that is both twistable and worth using.</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
I completely agree.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">Our 3 garbage rizlona upgrades (OOPS 1 is a downgrade, 1 is identical) should have had added effects like healing focus or improved criticals. (mages and wizards dont even need the dmg focus anymore, they have self focus that is as good or better). </span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
I completely agree.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">adding more utility songs like the 3 tick silence would be awesome. I was so excited about the 9th spell slot, but unfortunatly we didn't recieve any songs worthwhile for that slot. I kid you not, a good amount of the time that slot is empty or unused. my default raid/group spell set has the 5 minute recast BBB nuke stored there for the OMG 1800 bard crit hotkey.</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
I feel the exact same way.  I am sick and tired of playing 
<br />
Haste v1, Haste v3, Veeshan, and marr.  It's been these songs
<br />
for way too long.  Variety is the spice of life!
<br />

<br />
Thanks very much for your comments, I will revise the 
<br />
mesmerize song to reduce unnecessary coding problems.

As lead Bard, I ask the rogue what the AE is (it's a poison dot I believe that, if not cured results in a DT after 30 secs, oh, an it has a -1000 resist check) he tells me and I announce to the other Bards, straight up fight boys, don't bother with AE chorus, though we did all play PoV for the DS.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Aye with OoW we have seen an increase in mob AoEs that is simply sickening. An AoE version of PoV is due, although I think there should be an AoE version that is the same as PoV and this suggested one as a single group upgrade. Frankly I think this list of songs would go along way toward making players actually resist AoEs again. Also its nice to see every song here having a linked instrument and a modifier an instrument can affect! If bard regen songs stacked then I would agree that 45hp base would be too much, but when mobs have a 1500hp AoE with 750a tick dot with 400 range? Then no, even with a 4.2 lute that is only 189hp a tick. That is a help but by no means is it overpowering. We aren't playing in Velious anymore.</span></td>
