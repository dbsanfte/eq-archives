<b>Why mez over charm? Here's why. - </b>5/21/03 5:19:47 AM<br>~ <b>Undivine</b><blockquote>Even if you decide you want to use your charm song, you should have mez memmed as well. Mezzing has certain important advantages over charming:<br><br>1. You can mez up to three targets at a time. You can only charm one target at a time. This is a big advantage. This can turn a potentially terrible pull into a very successful one for your group.<br><br>2. Unless you're dealing with a highly resistant mob, mezzing sticks for as long as you play the song. Charming eventually wears off. Sure you can charm them again, but in some cases they can do some pretty good damage during that short time between charms. And what if they resist the second charm attempt? With mez you can simply try again if they resist - they are still mezzed from your first try.<br><br>3. You cannot cast spells (or in our case songs) on anything that's considered your pet. With a mez you still use certain spells that won't break mez (like Largo's). You can't do that with charm. In fact, if you charm a spellcaster, they may even buff themselves while under your control! You don't want that.<br><br>Don't get me wrong. The Song of the Sirens is a good song, and I like charming creatures. But even if I have this song memmed, I always have a mez song memmed as well.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>Don't see a problem with new Mez - </b>9/11/02 1:36:42 PM<br>~ <b>Neruda DeHubris</b><blockquote>Hi there. In the latest reincarnation of my favourite bard, I came back to find that Lucid Lullabye was no longer area effect. I have been getting xp (from level 24 to 27 so far) in Splitpaw, and I think the new mez song is fantastic. I find that it is rarely resisted, and my cha is only 137. The odd mob is way too red, and none of my songs will touch it, but for low reds and below, keeping 3 or 4 mobs sleeping while the group works on another couldn't be simpler. <br><br>To the guy that said that charm is better, well, it is and it isn't. If there is only 1 add, by all means charm. But when you have 3 or 4 adds, you can only have one pet. Sure you could charm one, and mez the other 2 or 3, but why make your life so difficult? Just mez them til you are down to 2, then charm the last one to help you out.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Better than Charm? - </b>8/22/02 7:27:23 PM<br>~ <b>Bondar Blunote</b><blockquote>I know that we have all had problems with other group members breaking mez on the mob we are handling, but I dislike using Siren Song unless the group is in dire straits. Charm does not last long enough and I have found that after your pet breaks its charm it and its buddy come directly for you! This situation for me has resulted in one dead bard (me!) more than once. I stay on any adds and if anyone breaks mez I just remez them a second later. Pixie strike has a permanent home on my repetoir of songs!</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>hmm - </b>8/15/02 8:49:29 PM<br>~ <b>Voises</b><blockquote>This song is better then mez when your pulling a good amount of mobs because you of the fact that you can only have one mob charmed and a lot of mobs mez'd.

<b>Underrated - </b>7/18/02 10:10:05 AM<br>~ <b>Varien Songweaver</b><blockquote>This song gets a lot of flack, but I've found it to be one the most valuable, if not THE most valuable in my lineup.  As a bard obsessed w/ CHA (I have 220 at lev 42), I've never regretted having high cha.  Why? Because I NEVER have the need to lose health.  I've already mentioned in  a previous post the value of this song in fear kiting (mezz, THEN use AoE fear on the harmless mob).  BUt this serves another purpose, too, especially in soloing: a much needed heal break. Now, you should know how often you get resisted before trying this, but if you're like me, and know that it hits MORE often than  it's resisted, you can rely on this song for a nice break. If you're getting beaten on, just back off, throw on a string, and twist mezz/heal for a while, until you're at high enough HP to be safe.  Whenever you're ready to fight again, just go ahead and fear the creature, and return to the nice kiting.  Never any reason to lose more than a bubble of HP per fight in this way.  Fun, too, and people will be impressed beyond belief at this arrogant little bard that has an enormous brute waiting his turn to die while the bard casually heals up.  Fun fun :) Enjoy!<br>-Varien Songweaver, Bard of the 42nd season on Mithaniel Marr</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>Mez relies on CHA - </b>1/16/02 1:13:58 PM<br>~ <b>Steppy</b><blockquote>Both Pixie Strike and Song of Twilight at level 53 rely on charisma.  These songs really have 3 great uses.  The mez function is obvious, but Pixie Strike also debuffs magic resistance which means you can really set the table for casters.  Also, if your cleric is being battered by a mob and you want to taunt it off, this is a great way to do it!  Mez is a major taunt and debuffs are, too-- this song does both.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>Answer to Menadana - why this one - </b>8/10/01 4:52:03 PM<br>~ <b>Arathros</b><blockquote>Menadana,<br><br>The level 15 Lullaby song is a nice song, it's true.  However as it sounds from your description, you've discovered its main drawbacks, which is, it's often resisted.  This becomes a real problem if you're trying to mesmerize multiple high level monsters.  In addition, the ones that break from it due to resistance or you not getting it to stick again all attack YOU.<br><br>I prefer to take Pixie Strike because it seems to be resisted less.  Also, if it sticks, it has a nice side-effect of interrupting any caster you use it on.  This is a good strategy to keep applying it to a caster mob (think complete heal types or gating types), even if your party is bashing on it and breaking the spell.<br><br>I seem to use it well in a situation where there are two or three mobs for my group to contend with.  In this situation, I'll stop attacking, pull back a little, and Pixie Strike my first target (and hit the text macro I posted about below).  Then, I'll either fit in a round or two of party buff songs and reapply the Strike, or mes a second target.<br><br>The song does have drawbacks.  For one, if your target has a damage-over-time (&quot;DOT&quot;) spell on it, then it won't stick.  Also, it will break many of the enchanter spells.  But it is a great backup if you have no enchanter and merely need to draw off one or two opponents.<br><br>Alternatively, Charm type songs can often accomplish the same things, plus put your pet in combat with the group's target.  But you have to be organized in terms of targeting and hot keys.<br><br>Crowd control isn't easy for bards, but knowing the techniques of what works and what doesn't is what separates true bard players from the powerleveled twinks.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>Why this one? - </b>7/25/01 5:44:19 PM<br>~ <b>Menadana</b><blockquote>Hi all, I am a fairly new Bard and just had a quick question.  As a bard working crowd control, what would make this song superior to the L15 AE song?  The duration of the mez effects?  I don't have this song yet and haven't found myself in a situation where I need any crowd control, but I have played with the L15 song and didn't have too much success.  I had a high level cleric friend watch over me as I pulled about 3 MOBs on me and tried to keep 2 sleeping and pick em off one at a time.  I think I just chose bad mobs because they stunned...resists and stuns kept my little plan from working .. at all.  The cleric had to step in and hit me with Reolution/Words/Symbols to make his job easier.

<b>Use a text macro to help out - </b>7/13/01 4:38:15 PM<br>~ <b>Arathros</b><blockquote>You can really help out with crowd control if you add a couple of text macros to your hot key boxes.  One that I use with Pixie Strike is a macro that basically says:<br><br>I am MESSING the %T, please don't wake it up!<br><br>Hit this button before or after you use the song on your target (by the %T) and it raises the chances your group will leave it alone.

<b>Some tips for using this song. - </b>4/16/01 1:49:15 PM<br>~ <b>Belark Songstrider</b><blockquote>This is an excellent song, and one that you will really begin to use a lot once you get into dungeon settings. <br><br>A few tips- If there is a capable enchanter in your group, let them handle messing. For some reason, your mes overwrites theirs, and doesn’t last nearly as long.<br><br>If there is not an enchanter, it's up to you to be crowd control for the group. Get out your wind instrument - it doesn’t make it more likely to succeed, but it lowers magic resistance by a greater amount when it does succeed, making it easier to re-mes. <br><br>Realistically, you cannot keep more than two things messed at once. Resists and the difficulties of retargeting make it really tough. Make sure your group knows this, and has a plan to deal with more than 3 things. <br><br>Group coordination is critical - It is VITAL that your group assists the lead, so that people aren't bashing your messed target. If you have a shaman who can slow, make sure they know that slowing your messed targets will really help you keep them messed. (They usually don't know this.)<br><br>Other uses of this song:<br><br>As mentioned, this song will interrupt a spell caster if he is still in his 'windup', and the song is not resisted. GREAT song for preventing healers from healing. <br><br>The other use of this song is the knock back effect. In testing, this song actually pushes the target a little bit in the DIRECTION YOU ARE FACING WHEN THE SONG TAKES EFFECT. So you can actually &quot;steer&quot; the target by singing this song. Need to pull him towards you? Target him, turn around so he's behind ya, and sing away. Bump him to the left? Target, turn left, and sing away. Can be useful for nudging things off of ledges or keeping them in a certain spot. <br><br>-Belark Songstrider, 51st Minstrel of Drinal<br><br><br> </blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>Interrupting Casters! - </b>1/29/01 5:31:35 PM<br>~ <b>Kocho Divah</b><blockquote>If you're up against any kind of caster, mem this song.

It also adds a nice MR debuff.</blockquote></td></tr></table></blockquote><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href="/songs.asp?&song=31">Back to Normal Mode</a><br><br><br><i>Printed from EQDiva.com on 10/28/03 1:12:58 PM.</i><br><br></td></tr></table>
