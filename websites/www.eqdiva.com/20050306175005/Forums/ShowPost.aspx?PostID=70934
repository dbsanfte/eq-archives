<br />

<br />
So in comparison to 2.5 Time mods we will get about +10 ae resists, maybe 8 ds, some irrelevant singing mods (hit cap already anyway....~+320 resists like I have now or ~+340 feh)
<br />

<br />
FT2 on weapon? ok I will stop laughing sometime soon really - I have FT augs banked and I wear more than I can use now.
<br />

<br />
Yes Dmg/Delay, hp, all other stats very nice. So will be all of the other Anguish weapons and they will be considerably easier to obtain.
<br />

<br />
GoD molds offer worn mods from 2.7 (brass) to 2.4 (string).
<br />

<br />
Time and effort required, not only by the bard, but by the dozens of people that must assist them does not work out for me. Once I am in Anguish, and regularly killing the required mobs, I might start working on this...but I kinda doubt I will ever complete it.
<br />

<br />
2.9 would have been my magic number....might be silly to say no over 0.2, but im not gonna harrass folks to help me with this untilI have a much better idea of the itemization in Anguish and GoD.  I suspect that this item will in no way come to hold the all important must haveness of Epic 1.0 as we will have many other options to achieve our mods.
<br />

<br />
Oh and will want to see parses that show the clik is a noticable buff...the 1.5 click has no parseable effect according to many posts I have read. </span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Its my personal opinion that the OoW expansion is attempting to nerf upgrades to bards as a whole. While our new armors are nice, our songs lines are riddled with downgrades. 
<br />

<br />
For example...
<br />

<br />
AE dots don't work if a mob is moving at all... so if it flees, it doesn't die unless you chase it. Thats a genuine nerf, but /rude SoE for making the line pointless now. No AE kiting for j00!
<br />

<br />
Our new and improved snare is a complete and utter waste of a rune. As far as I can tell it lasts 3 ticks, but has no slow component, and its resisted a LOT. Just use the old one or get a Toetwister. A level 68 spell? seriously...
<br />

<br />
Our new charm can only be cast within melee range of intended targets. No swarm kiting for j00!
<br />

<br />
Our new pacify doesn't pacify. The old pacify would lull mobs so that you could walk past them without aggro. This song merely prevents chain aggro from surrounding mobs... and the casting range is the same.
<br />

<br />
Even our DoT's don't land as much in PvP as the Tuyen's set.
<br />

<br />
And to top it off, we get song mods on an epic weapon that are obselete to anyone weilding it.
<br />
Its a great weapon and has an amazing ratio and super stats, but yea... 2.7 mod... come on.
<br />

<br />
The bottom line is that SoE has probably felt that bards are overpowered, but to nerf bards yet again would send many of us scrambling over one another to get to WoW or some other MMORPG.
<br />
However, the diabolical think-tank at SoE masterminded a scheme that would fix our unbalanced asses once and for all! And without the implementation of a nerf or any other spongy substance!
<br />
During OoW development, bards level 66-70 fell off the top of the nerf tree and hit every branch on the way down. We got nerfed by a bunch of suits chattering across a mahogany conference table before any of us had a chance to hit 66. And at 65, we were blissfully unaware of what was happening to our beloved class.
<br />

<br />
-You're not nerfed! How can you call yourself nerfed? All your new stuff is &quot;upgrades&quot; from the old version... sure you can't lull... but your old spell doesn't work on level 70 mobs! See? Upgrade!
<br />
-O yea? Thanks Sony. /rude
<br />

<br />
Still a class very much worth playing... but... its pretty disappointing. I was excited to get new spells and upgrades... man... I was gonna swarm in Fire... all I can do now is shake my head.</span></td>

<br />

<br />
Our AEs were nerfed before the release of Omens, and they gave us quite a few reasons for it, all of which we've discussed a hundred times on these very forums, so I won't go into that one any further.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">Our new and improved snare is a complete and utter waste of a rune. As far as I can tell it lasts 3 ticks, but has no slow component, and its resisted a LOT. Just use the old one or get a Toetwister. A level 68 spell? seriously... </span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
A lot of bards were actually asking for a song that would only snare, with the idea that we would be able to snare a mob that isn't slowable (since our snare/slow songs won't stick on them). I haven't had a chance to test this song yet, but having a CHANCE to snare it is better then the song not being able to land at all...
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">Our new charm can only be cast within melee range of intended targets. No swarm kiting for j00! </span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
That's because they didn't want us swarming level 70 mobs. If they wanted us to swarm with this song, they would of made the level limit MUCH lower, like 59 or 60 probably. MANY MANY bards requested a charm that could be used as an additional CC tactic/burst DPS, like we had in the 40s-early 50's. This was a pretty reasonable solution.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">Our new pacify doesn't pacify. The old pacify would lull mobs so that you could walk past them without aggro. This song merely prevents chain aggro from surrounding mobs... and the casting range is the same. </span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
All classes that could lull or pacify got hit with this one. SOE said it was so people didn't bypass content, primarily in dungeons. I think it's reasonable. If they wanted you to only hit the named mobs in a dungeon, they would've just put them at the zonein. 
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">Even our DoT's don't land as much in PvP as the Tuyen's set</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
I can't comment on that one, as I don't ever PvP.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">And to top it off, we get song mods on an epic weapon that are obselete to anyone weilding it. 
<br />
Its a great weapon and has an amazing ratio and super stats, but yea... 2.7 mod... come on.</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
That one... I don't know. The mod overall is kind of crappy for the difficulty of the quest, yes, but you are getting that mod on all instrument types. It means you can swap out those one or two pieces of gear with a worn mod on it, that you were wearing JUST because it had a worn mod on it, for something much better in that slot. I'm not anywhere near getting 1.5 or 2.0 though, so I can't speak from firsthand knowledge on that.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>My point was really that many of the defining features of what once was known as a bard no longer apply post 65.
<br />

<br />
You get to kite one mob at a time now... grats. And it has 50k hp so its going to take you about 10 minutes of running in circles twisting your a$ off to kill it (ain't it fun playing a bard!?). I get that they didn't want people swarm kiting level 70 mobs... but they could've given us a charm upgrade that would still allow us to kite some areas (in addition to the one that MANY MANY bards requested for burst DPS). Maybe instead of that sorry-excuse-for-a snare, we get to charm level 60 mobs. Frankly I think the MANY MANY that were requesting the new charm were just requesting it with the intention to swarm kite in higher level areas. A bard charming a mob in WoS/MPG/RS to use for DPS in combat is a fine way to get yourself killed (they love-tap for 600+), but I don't know if it has a practical use beyond that.
<br />

<br />
As for the lulling nerf... in most of the top end exp zones there aren't many mobs that see invis. But there are mobs in areas like MPG/WoS/RS that will be &quot;unaffected&quot; by any lull, so you have to get crafty on pulls anyway. And even if you could lull the mobs surrounding the &quot;unaffected&quot; one, you'd get pummelled when it wore off, so there's really no way to bypass that content. You can't lull through much of the old content anyway... BoT maybe. Was that really such a problem? I tried it in a lot of groups until I realized, we were a lot better off just killing things instead of wiping our group.
<br />

<br />
As for the new snare, its not worth the spell slot it takes up. I have yet to encounter a mob that I would use it on... maybe in Anguish, as I haven't been there yet. Riftseekers in an exp group perhaps? But I doubt it because I can slow many of those. A better alternative would have been to make it a level 55 spell that you could buy from a vendor. Or maybe do a little quest or something for it. Muramite runes sell for 30k+ on my server. This spell isn't worth anything close to that. Weak excuse for a level 68 spell imo.
<br />

<br />
As for the AE nerf... old news, yes. But I'm still pissed about it. Particularly because I have to farm old content to skillup Blacksmithing and Tailoring. What I usually do is round up a buttload of mobs (say, Sonic Wolves in Hollowshade moor... cause you need 1000+ of their &quot;shrieking substances&quot; to max smithing). So say I have like 40 mobs... I'm AEing... AEing... then all of the sudden half of them take off. Well, guess what. As long as they're running my AE doesn't do dick. So they escape and survive and I've wasted my effort, and it takes twice as long to farm the 1000 shrieking substances, 1000 wailing substances, and 2000 swirling shadows I need for the combines to max the skill. Hours are added to the time-sink and subtracted from my life if I want skillups. I guess that pisses me off a little. 
<br />
By the way... these mobs run at like 40%, so AE snaring them doesn't help.
<br />

<br />
There are ways to remedy what SoE has determined to be a problem. But instead of getting creative with the mob content, they got creative with you and me. Thereby biting the hand that feeds them.
<br />

<br />
As of right now, the population on my server has become so delapidated that the top guild on my server cannot attempt end-game content. Thats because people are leaving. Moving to greener pastures like WoW, or even just quitting altogether.
<br />
As a result, 90% of the power gamers on Tallon and Vallon have requested a server merger so that we can rejuvinate our population and tackle this content.
<br />
SoE was kind enough to set up a serverwide meeting in-game which about 400 or so people attended. We want this to happen. The PvP community will die if it doesn't. Power guilds on Tallon are starting to become one guild. Its pretty serious.
<br />

<br />
Altering my capeabilities and creating more ridiculously long quests do not make EQ more fun. Thats why people leave. 
<br />
Sure, OoW has some neat new stuff. But its like, equipment has higher stats, mobs hit for a ton... etc., etc.
<br />
Its kind of like more of the same, except its not the same. Now you can't swarm or AE kite. You are more limited in your abilities now...
<br />
Come on SoE... lets get a little more creative here...
<br />

<br />
here's a new idea since you guys seem to be stuck in the same creative rat-hole you've been in since velious...
<br />

<br />
How about an epic battle between 2 Gods... They hit each other for a ton... and one will definitely die. You're assisting one God and if the NPC gets the KS, you don't get loot. If the good guy loses, the bad guy turns on your raid and you either kill him and get loot, or you wipe.
<br />

<br />
Take that to the board-room, mfers.
<br />

<br />
And how about like... a Tomb Raider style timed single PC maze with like 8 unique instances - not mappable. If you run into a monster you either kill it or keep going and it chases you. As time lapses, lava comes out of holes in the floor behind you... traps dispell buffs... its absolute chaos... but the rewards may be worth it...
<br />

<br />
You can even add like a first person shooter element to new instances.
<br />

<br />
Sorry. I've gotten myself off on a tangent. I'll copy this to the appropriate forums on EQlive...</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>I realize that I'm not at the same lvl gear/flag wise as most of the people that have epics, but being 1 kill away from being Elemental, my best instrument mod is 2.8 on TDoK and Engraved Spiral Conch, and these are hand instruments, not worn mods.  And while I realize that this is meant to be good for all bards, I just don't see them giving us a single item that will replace every single normal instrument that a bard may currently be using.  And although I realize this is going to be a harder quest for me than most that have finished it seeing as I have lesser gear/AAs/lvls, I don't see having to wait until I'm fully flagged for Time/Kod'Taz to necessarily finish this, so it will still be a huge difference for me.  And you still have to figure that the only worn 2.7 mods out there are brass and percussion I think, so now your upgrading all other worn mods, and you can replace the other 2.7 mods if you happen upon better gear.
<br />

<br />
We need to remember, that hand instruments should always be better than worn/weapon mods, and when confronted between choosing a 3.4 instrument that will basicly stop your DPS for a short bit, or a 3.0 epic with rather big DPS, who would ever honestly switch to the instrument?  That's just not a big enough difference for most bards to care I don't think, I mean h*ll, how many bards still use epic 1.0 with 1.8 mod instead of switching out 2.8 or better mods all the time?  The only reason anyone ever uses instruments is if kiting or taking out a boss on a raid, it's very rare anyone switches in the middle of a normal xp group.

<br />

<br />
When PoP came out they added mods to armor that were the same as epic 1.0. They did give us instruments though that were ultra rare drops from the elemental zones which many of us never got to see. Then they finally started to add some in time and our friend over in FoH (furor) bashes SoE for it saying there are waaaay too many bard mods in the game......riiight.
<br />

<br />
GoD comes out but being it was never actually finished they didn't start adding mods til much later on after a few patches. Again the mods were subpar until you got past Qvic.
<br />

<br />
So we went from 
<br />

<br />
1.0 to 1.8 to 2.0 to 2.2 to  2.5+ mods on armor weapons in GoD (Qvic) in a 5 year period. Now they give us an epic to finally replace the one we got like umm ( lost count here) 6 expansions ago BUT it is only like .2 higher than armor from a previous expansion, if that. All logic pointed for it for be 3.0+, it IS an epic and should not be replaced easily, epic 1.0 case in point for 4 yrs +.
<br />

<br />
Don't even get me started on the mod caps....
<br />

<br />
Now say you are in a guild that raids Anguish. What is the point in getting this so called epic if it will actually be an downgrade for most mod wise? Get it for the click effect since it gives a nice looking icon for 1 minute? 
<br />

<br />
As it stands now the only reason bards would get it would be for its stats and dmg/delay ratio. It also lets us dump some of the armor we got in PoP that we have yet to be able to replace because of the mods on them.

There's a 2.8 Singing mod weapon from Texvu, which isn't listed on alla's for some reason.  It's listed in my magelo dreamlist though, the edge of chaos.  (there's a ranger in my guild that has it)  There's also other items with a 2.6 singing mod. 
<br />

<br />
The best string on Alla's is a 2.6 sleeve from MPG trials. 
<br />

<br />
Alla's also doesn't list the ring from Tacvi, Ring of Organic Darkness, which is a 2.7 mod. 
<br />

<br />
So, yeah, you can have the 2.7 mod (or very close to it) from a suit of worn equipment or weapons, there's no need for it on the epic if there's other better DPS weapons that you can be using from that zone. 
<br />

<br />
So, IMO, to bring it in line with the other epic 2.0 make it a 36/22 and leave the 2 magic damage on it, and make the mod 2.9 or 3.0, basically, something better enough that we'd use it over anything else available to us, while simultaneously allowing us a bit more leeway for itemization. </span></td>

A lot of bards were actually asking for a song that would only snare, with the idea that we would be able to snare a mob that isn't slowable (since our snare/slow songs won't stick on them). I haven't had a chance to test this song yet, but having a CHANCE to snare it is better then the song not being able to land at all... </span></blockquote>

First.. name me 10 mob that 1. are snarable 2. unslowable and 3. There will be a point of snaring it.  Second, this is a completly obsolete arguments since slow mitigation is implemented. Dirge of Metala IS a waste, how can you deny that?

All classes that could lull or pacify got hit with this one. SOE said it was so people didn't bypass content, primarily in dungeons. I think it's reasonable. If they wanted you to only hit the named mobs in a dungeon, they would've just put them at the zonein. </span></blockquote>

To clarify, they land less because OoW resist debuff is capped lower than PoP dot resist debuff due to JF

As for my idea about epic 2.0. It is a representation of what people didnt see in GoD and just start to realize now that they are late in OoW. Sony Decided to nerf us. Although they didnt had the balls to get out the bat so what they did is only make sure that we dont get any upgrades what so ever. They even build up encounter that make bard almost obsolete.
<br />

<br />
The Blade of Vesagran is DEFINATLY an Epic. Why would you ask me ? Because is crappynest is the symbol of how sony decided to look toward bards.

Your arguments are that there are other items from GoD with similar mods/etc?

<br />

<br />
There has to be a break even point where the mod is good enough to leave your weapons equiped.  For some Bards 2.7 is not going to cut it.  Instrument switching at 70 is fairly stupid I'd say, but it is what we have to do to get the most bang for the buck.
<br />

<br />
I have not used a weapon of such high ratio as epic 2.0, but I do know that weapons store bought vs the best ratio you can loot (minus a dd proc) is barely perceivable in a 6 person group.  As a bard gets higher the mele discrepency worsens.  Think of our 2.0 weapon dps as a lv 70 ranger wielding a 10,20 weapon...because the dps is the same.  A 1:1 for us is really the output of a 1:2 for a dps mele class.
<br />

<br />
Reality is vender bought weapons with instrument switching 3.4 mods and singing 3 or 4 songs is the same as not instrument switching and having a constant 2.7 with uber ratio.  Rob one to pay the other.  (just more work for the switcher...no biggy)

I used to not be able to understand (or at least only sorta understand) too.  Then I joined the guild I'm in.

<br />
Yes, this is a very good weapon, but it's likely to end up in a bag when it should be EPIC, not directly comparable to stuff you have/can get when you are able to complete the quest.   This is supposed to be the ultimate bard item (for a few expansions at least), and it should reflect that.

I have fairly decent gear too.  My low mod is 2.2 (wind), and the rest are 2.4 or 2.5.  I will have 2.7-2.9 gear available to me, by the time I can get the globe, with an almost guarentee of 2.6 for most everything.  
<br />

<br />
A 2.7 mod vs a 2.5 or 2.6 mod is negligible, and no reason to use this above anything else. 
<br />

<br />
It should have a mod equal to (or possible a tiny bit higher) than anything else we have available.  Hence my suggestion for a 2.9 or 3.0 mod on it.

Yes, HPs are nice, but again, there's weapons from Anguish (you have to be there to get the 2.0) with nearly as many hps.  I don't doubt there will be more items found that would make it a question of 340hp vs 300 or 315.  only a tiny upgrade.   However, still an upgrade, and no one is debating that really.

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">3) One of, if not THE best weapon ratios in the game for bards. </span></blockquote> 
<br />

<br />
The ratio is 34/22, which is a 1.54 ratio.  The magic damage, which is not always going to be effective, brings it to a 1.63 ratio.  
<br />

<br />
There's weapons with ratio's like 33/22 and 32/21 available to bards by the time they can get here.  And there will probably be other things with ratios about as good. 
<br />

<br />
The change I suggest (making it 36/22 with +2 magic) would put it just below the ranger epic for ratio.  And make it very much worth using.

It's a nice effect, but not overwhelming, and not at all a factor for my equipment choices.

Yes, FT is important to us, but I'm sitting at FT17 right now, and I'll be over 20 if I get other items that I want.  Which makes me wish I had more spare time to get aa.  (because increasing my FT cap is low on my aa priority list)

I don't think anyone is complaining about the FT2 on there.  But it's just kinda an afterthought thing they slapped on there to dazzle us with all the stats.

Personally, I'd like to drop the FT2 and put some FR on there (since it's got all but FR).  </span></td>

It does seem odd to me that during the top ten issues debate a lot of people were asking that instruments, and therefore the value of swapping them in, be given more signfiicance and now people are complaining that they still have to swap. The swap is only for a fraction of a second, no big deal. Allowing the full modifiers to take hold would make those high level instruments more worth getting.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I see a couple posts saying this would be a great item for them because they are elemental/time leavel geared. <b>Epic 2.0 REQUIRES anguish access.</b> How much of an upgarde will this be when you have access to anguish level gear? Surprisingly not as much as you would think. Really the ones saying it needs aa boost are capable of getting this item, the ones saying its great are strutting around in gear 2 expansions old (yah, ldon doesn't count).
<br />

<br />
To put this weapon more in like with anguish quality loot, need to bump the ratio and mod for a start. Really the epic 2.0's ratio is way too low. Look at what ranger's epic is. Thiers is a 42/24. The simple fact is if a ranger and abard are wielding the same exact weapon, rangers will do more dps. Why give us a weapon that has a worse ratio? We should get a weapon with a ratio in line with thiers, and thier high dmg table from being a dps class will make up the difference. Really need a bump from 34(+2)/22 to 37(+2)/22. Maybe even 38(+2)/22 would be fair. The magic damage alone would allow for a higher ratio in weapon but also giving us a more random effect to low the over all dps of the weapon (ie: a 40/22 is always going to out perform a 38(+2)/22). Secondly the mod. Most bards by this point in the game will have 2.7 or better on thier gear. This is supposed to be an EPIC weapon, something we wield and use and is hard to replace... why give us an inferior mod on it compared to our other gear? Give us a 2.9 mod, that will be in line with what we are wearing... I've yet to see 3.0 worn mods, and 2.9 would certainly be equal or an upgrade to what we have so we actually wield our epic *gasp*. Third, find a new click or make it like 15% so our parses actually show some data indicating that the click is running. Its really a joke when you have to use markers in a parse to determine if the effect is on or off.
<br />

<br />
Two other general complaints that don't have any real importance, but would be nice if they get looked into. Piercing... with a blade.... a very long blade... The piercing animation makes me glad I don't play a rogue. Make the blade slashing for all the roleplay purposed and such... stabbing someone w/ a 6 foot weapon isn't really reasonable when you're talking about a blade instead of a polewarm of sorts. Also... the particle effects are non-existant. I would LOVE to see the concept art translated into game... the whole particles trailing from the tip of the blade. It would add so much more to the weapon during battles.
<br />

<br />
ATM I don't have my 1.5. I started on it, but I wouldn't wield it if I completed it. After seeing 2.0, I'm not sure I'm really going to trouble others to get a decent sized force all the way out to DN. Put it in some unused PoP zone (all of them), and maybe I'd bother them to zone over from PoK/PoTranq.

As for Epic 2.0, after about a week of playing around with it. It's a 75% upgrade for a bard in Angiush. The stats and damage ratio way higher than any other bard weapon out there. During raid while raid buffed I have Melee crited for 603 damage and hit alot between 400-551 damage(note this on MPG mobs and Anguish mobs). 
<br />

<br />
Only bad apart of this weapon is 2 areas. FT 2 doesnt make any sense but if you look at the other Epic 2.0 they all have FT2 on them that are mana users. Looks like SoE took easy way out on few stat instead of really looking into what needs to be on them said hey just stick FT2 on all the mana users Epic. Second thing is ALL ALL MOD 2.7. This is a tad under what i was excpeting and hope they do change it but not as high as everyone keeps sying it should be. I thought it would be 2.9 and not any higher sense all weapons and armor highest mod are 2.9. Instrument mods shouldnt be accounted for cause they are items of a higher specail quaility that require you to give up one thing to gain another where Armor and weapons do not. 
<br />

<br />
Im very happy with this weapon and so are high DPS class(monk,rogues.ranger)that end up grouping with me.Notes i didnt say caster. This cause the  The clicky does have a pretty big impact on Melee DPS do to 80% accurcy where the 7% to spell/dot chance to crit is not as noticable. 
<br />

<br />
Only other thing at this point which I dont think should change bards ratio is seeing the Rangers epic ratio compared to Monks. Im sure this will stirr up something with the monks once again feeling under minded by SoE again. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Increase Mod to 2.9 and give us soemthing better than FT2 I believe Bard Epic 2.0 would be where it should be. 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Now to add a few other things. You all are comparing our Epic to Rangers in which I do believe something going to change. If you look at the Monk(36/20) and Rogue(27/19) 2.0 they have poor ratio tooo. Rangers some how got some ungodly ratio which goes to show SoE had no clue what they where doing with 70% of the Epics. I think either one of two things will happen. Bard/Monk/rogue + few other will get upgrade ratio to balance Rangers ratio in line or Rangers ratio was error and will be fixed. Before Ranger Epic came out everthing seems to be in line where it should be. As stated above those only 2 things i see that need to be fixed

This item is easy to get for a qvic flagged raid... and the top bards in my guild have one. Granted, its not Epic 2.0 but its got a ratio almost on par with 2.0 and it beats the crap out of 1.5.
<br />
Not to diminish the attainment of 2.0.. its a fabulous weapon and given the choice, I would absolutely weild it. The effort my guild would need to put into it though makes me feel like I could be happy and quite satisfied with Thunderclap for a while. I haven't gotten mine yet, but its really only a matter of time. I'll probably get one within a few weeks or a month.
<br />
It has the neato OoW animated whip graphic too. Same graphic as Hulcror's Whisker.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Madon is so right about how we have been nerfed worse that we realize. Our epics are great if you are in a low level guild but if you are in a guild capable of easily acquiring them they are going straight into your bag. Our epic 1.0 lasted for many expansions but these are marginal upgrades on inception. Our other nerfs?
<br />

<br />
    Soloability. We cant swarm or AE for any real exp or loot anymore. We can chant kite mobs with lots of HP if they dont summon. Ok maybe we werent meant to solo.
<br />

<br />
     Songs. In MPG my cleric sent me a tel asking me to play something more useful than the mana song. With c6 and a bst in the group plus his full mana regen and large mana pool the song was irrelevant. The regen component? Everyone in the group cept me had over 10k HP so really what was the point? So, out of our 20 runes or so the ueful ones are the attack song,overhaste and the new mezzes. This actually beating a dead horse as this has been gone over before but I was truly surprised about the mana song thing. After years of getting into groups just because they wanted the mana song we no longer have that as a draw sometimes.
<br />

<br />
      Pulling. Monks and rangers have new AA's, skills, spells so ew are hardly the supreme pullers anymore (if we ever were). As a side note I beleive they (SOE) have been slowly pushing the pulling chores back to the FD classes anyway. When OOW came out the higher level zones had mobs that our more effective pulling tools (mez especially) did not work on. You needed the songs from those zones to be able to play in those zones. FD, a low level skill worked right away.
<br />

<br />
     Resists. The trend here seems to be a reliance on group healing classes to handle the AE,s  rather than increasing resists to avoid them. 
<br />

<br />
     DPS. Seems we are just as or maybe even more behind. Now   2 of the 3 best melee dps classes can pull as well or better than we can. Anyone see rogues getting mez and snare soon? 
<br />

<br />
     CC. Almost everything at higher levels needs to be debuffed to mez now. So if you need to do real CC hard to lock down even 2 reliably. Yes, I know when grouping most zones dont require much CC but if things do go bad not much chance you can pull things out.
<br />

<br />
    Still, I would miss playing the bard and as our server loses players our general utility saves us. However, I certainly dont stay on very long anymore if no group is forthcoming. Chant kiting for AA just sux.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Several problems Ive moticed.
<br />

<br />
The argument that their is better worn gear out there.  Yah there is.  But its not in one tidy package.  I've been in an EP guild for 6 months, and I still do not have all 5 instrument/singing mods (equal to or better than epic 1).  And honestly, the only reason I'm trying to is to bank epic 1.0, so i can get something with a better ratio.  Excluding mods found on BP's (Rarity issues, hence better mods), how many pieces of gear and from what zone levels would it take to get 2.7 mods?  It will take a long time to bank 2.0 because you have 5 pieces of better gear.
<br />

<br />
Our ratio.  Epic 1 (16/26), Epic 1.5 (24/22).  Epic 2 (34/22).  As a piercer, our ratio should never be better than our rogue brethren.  Technically, if we are a hybrid of anything, it is of rogues.  Do beastlords get better ratios than monks?  Also, all our epics are designed around the idea that its an &quot;Off Hand Wep.&quot;  Its old faithful.  It sits in the offhand and stays their.  How many times did you see Epic 1 in someones primary hand?  Prolly not many, and you know why, because its ratio sucked, but it was amazingly useful so we kept it in secondary.
<br />

<br />
The clicky, I don't particulary care for.  Mainly for the reason it doesn't really help the bard himself much.  Dance of the Blade helped us, AND helped our group.  This clicky, just helps the group.  Something like a 1 min Chorus song that added mana to US and our groups would have worked better than this.
<br />

<br />
As for the other combat effects, its all part of the balancing game.  We get FT2 because everyother mana user got it.  We get a combat resist because every other class got one, and they determined Stun Resist was the best choice.

<br />
Irrelevant.  
<br />

<br />
Bards for years complained that they couldn't get rid of the epic 1.0 because it had all 5 mods in 1 package and we couldn't replace it with the other mods.  Now we have options for the mods on a lot of other equipment (thank you Verant).
<br />

<br />
We can (and will) cover all the mods by the time we can get this item.  Not only will they be covered, it will be with items as good or possibly better.  
<br />

<br />
The epic is meant to be <b>EPIC</b>, so it should be the clear choice over other items.  
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">the only reason I'm trying to is to bank epic 1.0, so i can get something with a better ratio. </span></blockquote> 
<br />

<br />
Also the point of what we are saying.  
<br />

<br />
Me (and others) have talked about items that are available that have similar ratios, and we are sure that we haven't seen everything yet, so chances are the epic isn't <b>EPIC</b> as far as ratios go.  
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">how many pieces of gear and from what zone levels would it take to get 2.7 mods</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
Go back and read my previous posts, and you'll have your answer. :p
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">As a piercer, our ratio should never be better than our rogue brethren.</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
Baloney.  You could say the same thing about shadow knights, warriors, paladins berserkers and anyone else that gets/uses piercers that have better ratios than rogues.
<br />

<br />
The fact is that rogues don't get ratios that high because it would be a balance issue.  They do incredible damage with the ratio that they get, giving them more damage/higher ratios would seriously unbalance the game.   
<br />

<br />
Bards, on the other hand, consistantly do not do the dps that we are supposed to do.  
<br />

<br />
A better ratio in the hands of a bard would be like the incredible ratio of knight weapons:
<br />
it would bring us in line to where we are supposed to be for melee dps.  
<br />

<br />
It's been a standard practice since kunark that knights get high ratio weapons, why doesn't that apply to bards?
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">Technically, if we are a hybrid of anything, it is of rogues. </span></blockquote> 
<br />

<br />
No
<br />

<br />
Bards are not hybrids.  Bards have never been hybrids, and they never will be hybrids.  We got lumped in with hybrids at the start because of our versitility.  It has always been &quot;hybrids and bards&quot; when describing things. 
<br />

<br />
Bards are a unique class (and a nightmare for programmers apparently).

<br />

<br />
No again.  
<br />

<br />
The epic 1.0 was a Primary hand weapon initially.  It wasn't until later that it became useable (and then glued) in our off hand.  </span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Yes, we are a unique class.  However all of our gear is designed around the following.
<br />

<br />
We duel weild weapons, just like rogues, warriors, and rangers (weapon list on Ifir, GBoK, and 99% of our weaps).  Our ratios are tied to those numbers.  We do not use 2 handers, and dont get the enhanced ratios that that Knights get because they are limited to them.  Knights get better 1 handers because they dont get to duel weild at all.
<br />

<br />
For armor, we are aplate class, and treated as such.
<br />

<br />
For other miscellaneous gear, we are considered hybrids.  Rangers, Knights, Beastlords and us.  Disagree all you want, but when the Abalone Engraved Mask is a Hybrid Mask, we are a Hybrid.  Other pieces of equipement come to mind also.  
<br />

<br />
Argue all you want that it is because we have a mana bar, but like it or not, the DEVLOPERS consider us a HYBRID.  Personally, I think we are Plate class casters (much like clerics), but until you convince the coders otherwise, you have to follow their rules.
<br />

<br />
Did we get screwed with the epic? no.  We got the same ratio that warriors and rangers got (within a slim percent).  We got a weapon that 90% of the folks out there would use gladly, with an instrument mod that effectively gives you 3.5 mod to all (yes, im counting our AA).  Why not 2.8, 30, or even 3.4? because they want us to use our frigging instruments.  Why the h*ll else give them to us?
<br />

<br />
But here's some real math for you.  You need 5 items to bank the new epic, or have gear that makes it obsolete.  Assuming you raid 5 targets a night, and each target drops 2 loots on average, that 10 pieces of gear per night.  40 people on a raid (nice solid number), that means 25% of you receive an upgrade per night.  After 4 nights, roughly everyone gets an upgrade.  So after 20 nights of raiding, you all have 5 pieces of upgraded gear.  Lets assume one of those 5 pieces is an instrument mod with better than 2.7 mod.   Therefore after 100 nights of raiding you have all 5 of your mods, and your new epic is obsolete.   And that assumes optimal conditions.  What happens if 3 of our mods are on Plate armor, which we compete with 4 other classes for? or we have an overage of bards, or the raid leaders dtermine the new bp needs to go to the main tank first?
<br />

<br />
If you think this is a piece of junk, ask kinuvan if he would use, or Medaan if he does?  Before he swapped servers, Xevs top bard carried 1.5 as a wep.  Im willing to bet he would use 2.0 in a heartbeat, and wouldn't complain that he could get better before hand.
