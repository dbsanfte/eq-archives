				<td colspan="2"><span>Hi all, I'm a newbie bard and EQer learning to play with the guidance of my bf who has played for several years. Without him, I don't think I'd be nearly as far along as I am now - which isn't all that far! 
<br />

<br />
I have a few questions, and while I fully believe one should search the entire forum before asking, I can't seem to always understand the lingo.
<br />

<br />
Let's start with me: Just lvl'd to 15 last night. I'm a half-elf with some pretty good gear, playing on The Rathe. I run around East Commons &amp; North Ro for the most part, but recently started dying...er playing in Oasis.<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />
<br />

<br />
My main question for now is at a lvl 15, which songs should be my &quot;Must Haves&quot;? I solo some, but I really like to pull. Primarily I'm using Regn, Anthem, Bellow, and Resist (poison/magic, etc). I usually target a mob, then bellow and run back to my group. I'll twist the other songs (regen, anthem, and resist) and sometimes I'll hit too. 
<br />

<br />
Since I like to pull a lot, how can I use lull, bellow, and mez? If I'm soloing, should I use lull to pull one mob? If so, am I supposed to lull all the mobs except the one I want?
<br />

<br />
And my last question is, how does the Charsima song help me? I've used it on a vendor, but it doesn't seem to help.
<br />

<br />
Thanks in advance!<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />
<br />

All bard questions can be answered with &quot;It depends&quot; because bards are so versatile.  In your case, it depends on your group, what you are fighting and what your role is.  That being said, you will prolly always want Hymn (regen), Anthem, Selo's (speed), Bellow &amp; Mez.  Add Lull whenever you will be pulling and resistances depending on targets.  Having speed is not only good for travel and long pulls but also for some escapes.
<br />

<br />
It has been some time since I was 15 (grats btw), but here are my recommendations for pulling at that level (your mileage may vary):
<br />

<br />
Assuming your group consists of at least one healer type and one main tank (depending on gear you may be able to fill the tank role), let's assume you are facing 4 mobs.  Hopefully you have a key set up for both Cycle Target and Toggle Target. 
<br />

<br />
Eventually, you will be able to pull all 4 mobs, let the main tank take one and you keep the other 3 locked down by cycling mez.  You can even engage in melee while doing this if you are careful.  After the first dies, you can add another song in to replace the mez you no longer have to do (probably anthem, hymn or bellow).  Continue this til the last one when you can twist your main 3 (or 4 if you are so inclined and have a good connection).  Learning to handle 4 mobs at a time will serve you well in later levels and will probably increase your groups' kill rate.  
<br />

<br />
And until you are comfortable with that many at one time or if your group can't handle that many, use lull to decrease the number you have to deal with.  Remember that lull doesnt remove aggro, it just decreases the range of aggro so dont pull a mob thru a lulled mob and expect it to stay lulled.
<br />

<br />
And another note on the Charisma song, it is known to work on some vendors and not on others.  You can check by &quot;con'ing&quot; them before and after you cast the song on them to see if it's having any effect.  For example, if you are &quot;indifferent&quot; to Izbal Brightblaze in Butcherblock, this song will raise you to &quot;amiable&quot;.
<br />

<br />

				<td colspan="2"><span>Ok this is so helpful! Thanks so much! I decided to go somewhere semi-safe and play with my lull, mez, and bellow. I ended up pulling the entire mob and thought I should run and zone, but about half way there, I stopped and mezzed the other three and killed 1. Then started taking them out like that. I added a key to cycle through my targets and that is *SO* helpful! 
<br />

<br />
One problem I'm having now is when I bring three or four mobs to my group, I try to mezz and get them to kill one or two at a time, but inevitably they hit all of them and I have to help tank. Should I just tell them which to kill, or should I just let them do it this way? The problem I see with that is that they will get beat on and have to sit which takes us longer. This is, of course, because we don't have a steady healer that we group with.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I just wanted to say thanks for all the replies! It really helped me!</span></td>

<br />
   Welcome!
<br />
    You are not alone in your frustrations, and it will not end at level 20, 30, 40, 50 or even 60, because people LOVE to break mezzes. I have found that hotkeys help a lot (Ex &quot;&lt;---MEZZING %t You break it you tank it my friend!!-----&gt;&quot;.) Spam that one a few times and make sure that you tell the group to assist the tank and not you, because you will be switching targets to mezz and this can confuse people. Ask the tank to assist you as soon as you hit your INC message and tell them never to switch targets unless you call for it, I've also found that the more space between you and the group while you pull, the better. Say you pull 3 by accident that all have the same name, with distance between you and the group you can mezz 2 on the run and take one back, hit your INC message and sick them on it, then when the other two mezzes break and the adds come running in, you should be ready to mez them while the rest of the group concentrates on the single. I personally feel that while I'm pulling, I'm running the show, and I make that known by -Politely- telling people what to do. Dealing with difficult people is probably the hardest part about being a bard (in my opinion) so be patient and always be pleasant, people remember that sort of thing and no one wants a bossy bard yelling at them.
<br />
   Another tip you may find helpful, if you want some great places to practice lulling around lvl 15, go to blackburrow and try to pull singles out of the base of the elite ledge with lull, or the green room by the spike pit, it's full of elites and can get you great xp and is a tricky spot to pull singles because they are packed in and you have to -just barely- peek around the corner for the lull. If you are having a hard time with seeing mobs before you come around corners, use the F9 key to switch views and rotate the camera to look right around the corner. 
<br />
   Remember that you don't need a line of sight in order to use bard lulls, and as soon as you start it you can switch targets and it will still lull the original target unless you stop the song. This means that you can use the camera to switch views, toss on a lull or two, then switch targets and pull with snare or bellow and as soon as you start the pull song, you can run around a corner to have a bit of control over which way the mob runs. You only need Line of Sight when the song starts on any song besides lull, which doesn't need any Line of Sight. 
<br />

<br />
Anyways some rambling, I hope it helps. Pulling is my favorite thing about being a bard and it's only going to get more fun, so I hope I can help you when you need it, I'll keep an eye on this thread.

				<td colspan="2"><span>What you are describing is typical newbish stuff.  At your tender age, it is only costing you a little extra downtime.  At higher levels, failure to /assist (I'll explain below) will get you all killed!
<br />

<br />
The solution to the problem is the /assist command.  It can be typed, or set up on a macro.  There are two main ways to do it.
<br />

<br />
1)  Target your main tank (click on them, or their HP bar) and type /assist.  Now your auto-attack is on, and your target is the same as your Main Tank's target.
<br />

<br />
2)  Type /assist <i>player_name</i>.
<br />

<br />
If everyone in the group does this, then everyone will be smacking the same mob, and won't wake up your mezzes.  (Also, make sure you are not singing your Area of Effect damage songs, like Chords of Dissonance!)
<br />

<br />
You can also make a macro for /assist, and edit it each time you get a new group, or your main tank changes.  For info on creating macros, see <a href="http://www.eqdiva.com/EQ/Guide.aspx?id=72&amp;ForumID=132">This guide</a> or <a href="http://www.eqdiva.com/EQ/Guide.aspx?id=71&amp;ForumID=132">This guide</a>.
<br />

<br />
But your friends really SHOULD learn to /assist, and learn it soon.  It's already reducing your fun-factor a bit by creating more downtime (which would be true with a healer too, cause they would have to med more to get mana from healing more than necessary).  You fun-factor will REALLY be reduced when people start getting killed!
<br />

<br />
About lulling; I tried to lull a mob once and the whole lot of them chased me. How does one use the lull song exactly? 
<br />

<br />
In the meantime, I'll be checking out Miabell's Tutelage. I started reading before, but I will probably just print it and take it home to read during downtime.
<br />

<br />
The suggestion about assisting is a good idea. I think my group is usually telling their pets to assist me at all times, so while they are hitting one mob, the pets are breaking the mezzes. I'll fix that.
<br />

<br />
Another good question, how do I find a good group without just doing LFG? Are there boards for that? And can I find a bard on my server to show me stuff in game? That would be cool! 
<br />

				<td colspan="2"><span>When you lull it does have the chance to fail. Klapton's guide explains most of the details on beginner's pulling, try to be aware of aggro ranges and learn where that invisible circle is, because you don't want to step inside it. Different mobs do have different aggro ranges but once you get a baseline established for yourself you shouldn't have too much trouble as long as you're careful. Take your time, you'll learn how to pull faster later, trust me. 
<br />
When lulling here's a few things I hope will help:
<br />

<br />
1. Am I too close? 
<br />
(stay out of the lull song's range and keep casting it and moving closer until you find the maximum range, that's a good way to get used to it.)
<br />
2. Are all of the mobs by my target going to need lulling? How do I know which ones?
<br />
Generally, at first, you should lull everything you think is close enough to aggro when you pull the target, until you get more adjusted to the ranges. Target the mobs around your target, then start singing the lull, wait for it to complete casting before you start more lulls. As Klapton's guide says, there IS a chance your lull can fail. If that happens, 1 of 2 things will occur, the mob can aggro and bring everything else near it that is not lulled, or it might just stand there and do nothing, giving you a second chance to lull it. If you fail a lull you will get a red message telling you just that. Here's a crappily mapped example:
<br />

<br />
X=Other mobs
<br />
T=Your Target
<br />
Y=You
<br />

<br />
------X----
<br />
----T-------Y
<br />
------X-----
<br />

<br />
If you can understand the diagram above, it shows 2 extra mobs standing by or in front of your target. Target the right or left one, start the lull, wait for it to finish then target the opposite one and do the same. Once they have both been lulled, target the middle guy (your target) and fire up bellow or snare or whatever you prefer to use and bring him to your group by himself. The other two will not come unless you pull your target directly through them.
<br />
3. Does it matter which ones I lull/pull first?
<br />
Yes and no. Some people like to pull strong to weak, or vice versa, some folks make sure casters get pulled last because they tend to stand in one spot and cast instead of running after you. These little things are going to come from experience, a lot of it. Pulling is so much fun and learning it can be frustrating at times, just don't rush yourself. 
<br />
Hope this helped.
<br />

				<td colspan="2"><span>Wow this obviously helped me a ton! This weekend I was able to level to 17 with pretty good timing. My bf grabbed his Alt and we went to Oasis where I pulled from a Derv Camp. They had three or four dervs and I would lull them and pull them one at a time. The one time it didn't work, a caster resisted and I didn't realize it before I hit bellow. She ran through the others, pulling them along as well.
<br />

<br />
However, in my handy-bardness, I was able to keep three mezzed while my bf killed them one by one. So cool.
<br />

<br />
Once, one of them ran up a mountain, but I quickly mezzed her and then used bellow to kill her.  Oh the little things....<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />
<br />

<br />
I've found that pulling from the front is the best for me. I'm less likely to pull everyone else if it fails. Then there are my stupid little mistakes like the time I hit bellow rather than lull and brought 7 orcs on us. <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-5.gif" border="0" alt="Wink" hspace="2" />
<br />

<br />
I have a new question though! 
<br />

<br />
Now that I'm able to Dual Weild, I have a sword and an orb that I carry (one in each hand of course). This makes it hard to switch to an instrument or visa versa. I was wondering if there is an instrument that is a weapon too, or a weapon that acts as an instrument? 
<br />

<br />
Oh, one more question: How does the Bard armor work? I was looking at this <a href="http://www.eqdiva.com/eq/items/item.aspx?item=25487">Melodic Breast Plate</a> and I noticed the Effect. Do you have to be playing Selos Song of Travel to get the effect, or does it just work as long as you're wearing it? A girls' gotta have something to shoot for... ;)
<br />

<br />
Thanks as always!

				<td colspan="2"><span>The solution to your instrument-swapping problem is PRIMARY equippable instruments.  Depending on your budget, here are some suggestions:
<br />

<br />
Wind:
<br />

<br />
Ivory Horn (1.8 mod, drops off big bugs in Shar Vahl and Shadeweavers.  Should be DIRT cheap.)
<br />
Bloodstained Flute (2.2 mod, should be pretty cheap, common drop in LDoN stuff.  I use this at lvl 59!)
<br />

<br />
Percussion:
<br />

<br />
Truborn Drum of Dark Rites (2.6 mod, LDoN drop, should run a few hundred PP.  An excellent value)
<br />
Thunderous Drum of Karana (2.8 mod.  This drum kicks a$.  Get one by lvl 30 if you can.  Don't pay over 10k, try for 5k or less)
<br />

<br />
Brass:
<br />

<br />
A Flawless Ivory Horn (2.0 mod, drops off same bugs as Ivory Horn)
<br />
Troubador's Mace (1.8 mod, 1 hand basher.  Try to get one by lvl 42.  Try not to pay more than 5k)
<br />

<br />
String:
<br />

<br />
This is the bugger.  Perhaps the easiest PRIMARY String to accquire is the Lost Explorer's Lute, purchased from Guk LDoN camp for 52 points.
<br />

<br />
Lute of the Howler (2.2 mod)  This is a VERY cool item with a warewolf illusion / buff clicky.  Thus it is almost always ridiculously priced.  Coolness factor is off the charts though, and the clicky buff is AWESOME when you are midlevels.  (Higher levels, your songs are better, hehe)
<br />

<br />
Rajurkian Lute of Battle is awesome, with a 2.6 mod.  Problem is, it costs 510 adventure points at the EC camp...
<br />

<br />
Fortunately, the most frequent use of String is for regen songs between fights, so the three clicks vs. one click to equip is not SO bad.  As an avid instrument twister though, I can tell you that I longed for a Primary Lute for a LONG time, and finally have one.  It is my pride and joy!
<br />

<br />
I believe the Song of Travel on the BP you mentioned is a clicky effect.  I'm sure, however, that like the Singing Steel stuff, there is a minimum level at which you can click it.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>When I was lvl 15, all I had were my store bought standard instruments, and just like you, I wondered how I could find a way around switching them out all the time, because even if you have your hot buttons set up to make switching easier, it can become a real drag. Eventually (not anytime soon) you will be shooting for having as many instrument mods in armor and weapons as possible, this way you don't have to switch out anything unless you're kiting one way or another. Klap's info is awesome, I just want to give my own insight on the subject too:
<br />
IMO the first item you should try to get your hands on is a Troubador's Mace (Brass instruments), so keep practicing 1HB skills and make sure you don't let it fall behind! The mace should hang out in your offhand because it's slower. After the mace, look for a Gem Inlaid Longsword, this has decent stats and gives a somewhat weak Percussion mod. I used this is my main hand and mace in offhand from 25-44. When running and soloing I still used the Thunderous Drums because of the mod, but in combat the Gem Inlaid Longsword is GREAT. You should not have to pay more than 5k for each of these. Keep your piercing skills maxed because later I reccommend you replace the Gem Inlaid Longsword with a Battle Drummer's Main-Gauche. Click on the thing in my sig that says &quot;check me out!&quot; and take a look at the weapons, it might help. There is armor out there, and augments you can get from LDoN with more instrument mods, and it is a good idea to try and aim for getting as many mods on your regular items as possible without having to switch items. 
<br />
Anyways I hope that wasn't too much babbling, take care and keep at it!

				<td colspan="2"><span>You guys can never babble too much for me. I need all the info I can get. I worked kiting for the first time last night and that was fun. I kept stopping to see if they were following me, get bit, then run off to get more. I'm so easily amused.
<br />

<br />
You were all talking about the armor and the instrument mods a little bit. How do those work? What's it mean, 'Clickable'? Would it be something like setting up a hotkey to select my breastplate for example? I'm just wondering...
<br />

<br />
Also, thanks for the info on where to find stuff. So helpful!! I ended up going to Shar Vahl last night. The first bug I killed dropped the horn! So I worked my wind while AFK this morning. I also got the new songs I needed while there.
<br />

<br />
I have pretty good gear so far. I'm lucky that people are kind enough to give me their 'old' gear which is badass for me right now. I want to work on obtaining my weapons &amp; instruments alone though. How can I make a page like yours, Scambon? I could show you all my gear that way. And I can't see yours, it comes up all jumbled. I think that's my firewall at work though (boooo). I can't even see castersrealm or any other eq related website, save this one.
<br />

<br />
Tonight I'm going to set up spell sheets. I'm assuming I should make one for Solo and one for Pulling? Any others?
<br />

<br />
I hope I express how much I appreciate this... I will one day be an Uber Bard and have you guys to thank for it all. I will of course, pass down the knowledge!</span></td>

There are different types of &quot;effects&quot; on items.  Some say (combat) next to the effect name.  That is what we call a &quot;proc&quot; (processing).  That means that while you are hitting a mob with the OMG Longsword of Everything Slaying, there is a random chance that the effect, Holy Crap Nuke of Death, might go off.  That chance is increased by having higher Dexterity.  Most of these items also have a minimum level at which they will &quot;proc&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Some effects are what we call &quot;clickies&quot;.  That means that you right click the item to activate it, and the casting bar comes up, like a song or spell.  (Some are instant, which is most kewl).  You must stop singing, btw, to &quot;cast&quot; the effect.  Now, some say &quot;(must equip)&quot; next to the effect.  That means that you have to be WEARING the item to clickie it (like Singing Steel Armor effects).  Others can simply be in an inventory slot (like the Mask of Deception-- makes you a Dark Elf!).  Again, many of these have minimum levels at which you can activate them.  I believe they added the minimum levels to the item descriptions with the recent patch.  (It used to be you just had to &quot;know&quot; a lot of stuff, like Haste percentages, Instrument Modifiers, Proc Levels etc. , look it up online, or ask around for someone who knew.)
<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, there is no way to get a &quot;clicky&quot; effect mapped to your keyboard.  You can only do it using the mouse.  You CAN, however, have the inventory slot the item is in displayed in your hotkey bank, so you don't have to open your inventory screen to activate it.  To do that, you left-click and hold the inventory slot you want in your hotkey bank until it pops onto your cursor.  Then pop it into the hotkey slot you want.  (You can, btw, put a bag in a hotkey slot, and hitting that hotkey WILL open it for you.  You just can't activate a &quot;clicky&quot; with the hotkey itself.  You still have to right click it with your mouse in the hotkey slot.)
<br />

<br />
With higher levels, and more variety of song selection and solo methods, you may have LOTS of spellsets.  Among mine at lvl 60 are:  ChantKite, AE, SwarmKite, WithShammy, SlowHaste, Resist, RaidBuff etc.
<br />

<br />
When you set up spellsets, one tip to keep in mind.  One great advantage of them, is the speed with which you can mem new spells.  For example, I was in a group that all-but wiped.  (Necro Feigned Death, I ran like h*ll, lmao).  Well, I was able to run away from the mobs, rightclick my spell book, and memorize my ChantKite spellset before the mobs got to me and killed me.  Then I was able to chant them all down.  (Was funny.  When the group got back and started rezzing, I was still running in circles on kill number 7 or so, lmao.)
<br />

<br />
The key to quick spellset memming is having the SAME songs in the SAME song slots as much as possible.  When you mem a songlist, the songs are mapped to the specific slot you put them in.  Thus, if you have Selos in slot 7, and your songlist has it in slot 8, it will RE-MEMORIZE Selos into slot 8, taking more time.  If you ALWAYS have Selos, Heal, whatever, in the SAME slot, you will NOT have to re-memorize those songs to mem your songlist.  Only the ones that weren't common to both lists have to be re-memmed.</span></td>

<br />
This is still a skill you should develop. The majority of instrument mods on weapons/armor are 1.8 or 2.0; these are easily outstripped by actual instruments. (LDoN augs are generally 1.4-1.8.) There are a few augs/weapons/armor that are 2.5 or higher, if you're lucky, but the vast majority are the equivalent of storebought instruments or worse.
<br />

<br />
Your haste might not get an instrument modifier, but STR/ATK bonuses do, your chant damage does, and there's a point when switching real instruments might increase your group's damage noticeably more than you meleeing or just sitting there with your LDoN augs.
<br />

<br />
I'm not saying you're ALWAYS going to need to do this, but there might come a time when it's helpful.
<br />

<br />
Personally, I don't actually use my hotkeys to switch instruments (I use my hotkeys to twist). I have a GUI mod that gives me convenient inventory slots on my main window. If you don't want to make one yourself, there's a ton available for download at www.eqinterface.com.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Well I thought that I'd come back to this thread to keep posting. I kinda like to have all my conversation in one place! 
<br />

<br />
Well I'm now a very successful 25 bard! Woot! I spent a lot of time at Shadeweavers pulling those cute little guys that get nasty when they hit ya. They took forever to re-pop though. I took advantage of that and maxed out some languages. I also have 60 in Sneak and 30 in forage! I keep working those while I'm running around.
<br />

<br />
After Shadeweavers, my bf took me to Splitpaw. We were a little out of our league there so we moved to a sarnack camp. I learned that I could pull from those in the trees if I was pretty close under them on the ground.<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />
<br />

<br />
I leveled there and then moved over to Lake of Ill Omen. That is wicked exp there, and the money is really good too! I solo'ed until I hit 22-23, then it got harder to find dark blues. So my bf asked his guild where to go with our 21 Beastlord and me at 23. They said Mistmore.
<br />

<br />
Wow. That is a crazy, crazy, CRAZY place! I got a full group right off and learned quickly how a poorly played toon in the group will get you killed. I died probably 4 times in one night! Our cleric had a bad habit of running ahead while we were fighting and training about 4-5 more mobs back to the 4-5 we already had. The good thing is, a good group will take you far. I was able to ding twice yesterday and finally had to get up and leave with 55% to 26.<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />
<br />

<br />
I also made some pretty good money looting and we have some wicked shots of a train of 30-40 &quot;familiars&quot; where someone ran past us shouting TRAIN! We ditched ours and trained them, and then ran to the zone, pulling those too!
<br />

<br />
I've decided to save up some money and buy something good when I get to lvl 50 to reward myself. I'm thinking I want/need the Troub Mace. Do you guys have a recomendation? 
<br />

<br />
Also, thanks for all the help. I'm going to try to solo kite pretty soon. Oh, and I learned a valuable lesson about AE songs. Try not to use them out of habit when you're around vendors! ;)</span></td>

Keep at it.  In a couple more levels you will start to get songs that will change the way you play.  When you get charm and furfils you and your BL bf can start to charm duo.  It will take some doing but you will figure it out.  Read all the guides on soloing and then add a BL and adapt.  Dont forget to group and dont forget to have fun<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />
<br />

<br />
Some tips that have helped me:
<br />

<br />
1) get a custom UI  Keiz is good and he supports it on this site in a forum <a target="_new" href="http://www.eqdiva.com/Forums/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=16066">here</a>.  You can download it at www.eqinterface.com.
<br />
2) in addition to spell sheets I save partial sheets.  If you leave the spell gem empty it doesnt replace the spell.  This lets me define a couple of utility spell gems and quickly swap them out.  I use it if a dispell or aria is needed in a hurry.
<br />
3)SOW Potions.  When you solo, these can make life a lot easier and less risky.
<br />
4)Tank when you can at these lower levels.  It will raise your defence with less risk.  You dont have to endanger your group - just take your share of the beating<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />.
<br />

<br />
It sounds like you have learned the other lessions like know your songs and dont panic.  Keep up the good work. 
<br />

<br />
Also I love your pictures.

<br />
Thanks for the responses! I've read the guides about AE kiting, but I'm not sure I understand how Fear kiting works exactly. I've used Fear twice. Once was when I was playing with it in LIO, I just hit snare, then fear and it couldn't really move or hit me. The second time was a learning experience. I was in Mistmore in the graveyard when our puller brought us several reds, including a pet and temptress. The temptress was killing our only cleric so I feared her. We were already running for the zone when I realized that I'd basically used a strong AE and pulled damnear the ENTIRE castle!! (blush) I told everyone what I did and they thanked me for the screenshots they got. ;)
<br />

<br />
I'm still actually beating my mobs to death but I can't wait to try to sing them to death! 
<br />

<br />
As for the tips:
<br />

<br />
1. I'm looking at custom UIs right now, but not sure my computer will handle them. I think I'll find a nice hotkeys box with the primary/secondary on the side for easy weapon switches. I could probably do the one you suggested, but I don't understand what  <a href="http://sleinad.homestead.com/files/KeizUI/buffsong.jpg">this is all about.</a> Does this mean I can mem more than 8 songs?
<br />

<br />
2. I learned about the spell sheets the other day and patted myself on the back for learning something on my own that doesn't get me killed! <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif" border="0" alt="Big Smile" hspace="2" />  I only have 2 right now, 1 for play and one for travel. I find myself having to click off and mem new songs during group a lot. The biggest struggle for me is letting go of baby bard songs for my teenage bard songs. If anyone has time, would you consider giving me what you're using for certain scenarios?
<br />

<br />
3. I didn't know about SOW potions for my level! I'll check into that! Sweet!
<br />

<br />
4. Tanking is pretty much all I have done. My songs have been helping with slow, snare, bellow, lull, etc. I have all my melee skills maxed except 1h blunt, though I'm getting way up there. I think kiting is my next venture. I happen to camp near Splitpaw last night!<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />
<br />

<br />
Thanks for the comments about my pictures. At first I was like, Pics? What pics... oh yeah my website! Glad you enjoy them. I post one or two every day or so.
<br />

<br />
Thanks again!<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />

These are the spell effects that affect you.  The big box is for regular spells.  The small box is for your bard songs (although some songs end up in the big box - I dont know why).
<br />

<br />
Also, SOW potions are sold by players in the bazaar.  I use them when I solo as kind of a safty net.
<br />

<br />
Soloing the 30s-40s are probably our best soloing times because so much of the content is soloable.
<br />

<br />
Fear Kiting: sing snare (lvl 23) fear (lvl 26) and beat the mob to death as it flees slowly.  Your fear song can cause adds so you have to time your fear correctly to avoid them.  This is the slowest kite style.
<br />

<br />
Swarm kiting - where you get a pack, charm one, then let the pack beat it down until its almost dead, break charm, then chant your former pet dead - is fun, often exciting and great experience.  Unlike fear kiting you will kill things very fast &lt; 1 min per kill.  It does get old however.  
<br />

<br />
AOE Kiting - Gather up EVERYTHING and run in a pattern so your AOE songs hit the mobs but they dont hit you.  Unlike swarming you are killing everything at once.  It may take 10-15 minutes but you can kill 30+ mobs.  People who do it say it is great.  I never got the hang of it.  I guess I hate dying too much.
<br />

<br />
There are great guides for soloing (I'm sure you know that).  Experiement and have fun.  Dont forget to group too<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Woohoo I got the top half of Page 24 last night! I started my night by switching computers from my laptop to a desktop. This always takes a while for me to get it set up the way I like. I added <a href="http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=1056">this mod</a> to my UI and wow did it ever help my instrument switching! I made a few song sheets and while I was trying to figure out why my maps were screwy (had the height filter on) someone buffed the bejeezes out of me. Perfect time to practice fear/snare just outside of the spires in splitpaw.
<br />

<br />
I decided that wouldn't work with the gnolls because they'd head for their friends and I'd have more trouble. I decided to kite by twisting regen, selos, and DDD while playing my brass and running in a circle. 
<br />

<br />
The circle thing is rough. I bumped into a few trees and got hit quite a bit. Since I was just practicing with 1 mob at a time, the time it took to kite didn't outweigh the experience. I want to practice that some more.
<br />

<br />
Just keep in mind that you shouldn't try to kite archers. <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-13.gif" border="0" alt="LOL" hspace="2" />
<br />

<br />
Thanks for the info on the UIs. I was looking for a way to organize my screen better since it seemed hard to see sometimes, but I think I have it figured out now.

IE copy UI_surion_Stromm.ini to floppy then copy it from floppy to eq directory on the other computer.</span></td>
