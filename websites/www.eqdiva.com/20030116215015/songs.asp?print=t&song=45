<b>Tab targetting makes it a breeze - </b>6/20/02 1:21:33 PM<br>~ <b>Solidor</b><blockquote>Using tab targetting has made charm kiting a snap for me. Start by choosing victim mob. target them, then press Tab. This saves that mob in Tab memory. Means if you have YOURSELF targetted and press tab again, your target switches back to that mob. <br>  First, Choose victim mob. Target them and press tab.<br>  Next choose your pet mob. Target them and charm<br>  Press ESC TAB TAB ... Esc clears your target. First Tab targets you. Second tab targets your Victim mob automatically.<br>  Press your /pet attack hotkey<br>  Target your pet ( with f1 f1 ) or put /pet target in your pet attack hotkey.<br>  When charm breaks, recharm pet and ESC TAB TAB Attack ad nauseum.<br><br>This method eliminates getting damaged to aggro your pet, and saves precious moments of charm time as you try to click on your victim mob while running.<br><br>Solidor Derdarak<br>In the Service of Love, for without it we are nothing.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

This was one of the questions I had forever, and now that I'm 56, I see for myself it doesn't work on mobs higher than 51.</i></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>Charming is a must - </b>11/13/01 8:34:30 AM<br>~ <b>Guederian</b><blockquote>Charm kiting is tricky at first, but practice and master it. It's good to be a well-rounded bard: Soloing is the best for exp, but grouping is also essential (especially at higher levels) and fun. If you want to Solo, you must be able to Charm kite effectively. Charm Kiting = exp! Peace.. Gued, Bard of the 47th song</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>charm is good if know how to use it - </b>11/6/01 6:37:01 AM<br>~ <b>Asurancetturix</b><blockquote>charm song can be great to solo if know how to use it. first of all every bard should have cha over 150(u can get it with 3 or 4 items-kobold jester crown 30, sea spine horse bracelet 10(not sure), mask of deception 13). the number of resists now will be almost none and u probably charm better with 150 cha without flute than less 150 cha with flute. i usually just charm singing and hold in my arms a lute to heal. The tactic is easy, charm a mob and make it follow u. then go near another mob and let it hit u. pet will deffend u and so let em fight and stay enough far away so when charm off u have enough time to recharm. the best place to do this is CS at high 40s low 50s and behind dl ridge from 40. Mana always ends and then i just start doing some chant kitting to recover it.<br>mm sorry if this is too long ;)<br>Asurancetturix bard 55 of sol ro</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>Bard mana regen - </b>8/25/01 4:02:32 PM<br>~ <b></b><blockquote>Manasong does not work on bards. Neither does Clarity, nor C2, mod rods, flowing thought items, necro mana dumps -- anything. The only way for bards to gain mana is to wait. Sitting will take you from 1 mana/tick regen to 2 mana/tick regen with our measily med skill, but I prefer to just go to chants a bit when kiting rather than spend that long sitting.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>Wastes a whole lot of mana? - </b>8/23/01 10:53:14 PM<br>~ <b>Anonymous</b><blockquote>I went back to EW at lv42, was gonna charm kite like a madman with this song. I get goin and charm a Rygorr orc, with him as my constant pet I knocked off 2 cougars. Then I sent him after the third coug, after charm wore off I started to recharm the orc, but lo and behold I get the most dreaded message, &quot;Insufficient mana to cast this spell&quot;. I hightailed it and zoned with both mobs on my tail. I never thought to look at my mana bar while doing this, being a bard. After I zoned I had to meditate a LONG time to get it back, even with mana song, since our skill is so low. Can anyone tell me whats up with that? I was using a Mino Flute and never had that happen before. Should I buy INT or WIS items? : P I really hate meditating.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Thanks for the help - </b>7/25/01 8:56:55 AM<br>~ <b>Samrith</b><blockquote>I never thought of those pet commands and with a 51 necro u would of thought i would of.

<b>few tips that worked for me. - </b>7/24/01 10:15:14 AM<br>~ <b>Wayoff</b><blockquote>I found the same thing was happening with hill giants...once charmed they would wander off, leaving me having to chase them with the other mob following me.<br><br>I found that making a few /pet social keys helped tremendously.<br><br>/pet guard here   : this works much better than /pet sit down to keep a pet still<br><br>/pet follow me     : helps with those running giants.<br><br>you need to hotkey these socials and hit them almost right after you have charmed the mob..but it does save time in the long run as you won't need to chase after your pet to send it onto an angry mob.<br></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>More uses for Charm.... - </b>7/15/01 12:22:36 AM<br>~ <b>Melpomene Mouseai</b><blockquote>Not only does this delightful song work well on Hill Giants, it also works quite well in Sol B. <br><br>While I must admit I have done Hill Giants as well, kobolds provide a bit more exp (depending on your level range).  The same method is used... start by using your Curtailing Chant to lower the mob's Fire Resist (esp in sol B) then deal out some damage with Tuyen's.... after that cast charm and sick your slightly ruffled pet on another unsuspecting kobold.  A Greater Kobold Shaman is generally my charmed pet of choice, as they tend to deal out the most damage, but any kobold will do nicely. <br><br>Once their duel to the death is finished, you have but a few ticks of Tuyen's and a few measly hits and superb experience is yours.<br><br>This strategy in Sol B is best played out in the circle room... it is very close to the zone and is also in the middle of a few spawning locations for both shamans and greater kobolds. <br><br>Happy Hunting! <br><br>(*cheers for her buddy Fyr for his great charm guide as well*) :)</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Hill giant charming - </b>7/8/01 1:55:39 AM<br>~ <b>Samrith</b><blockquote>I tried that hill giant charming method... it is horrid whenever u finaly get a charm to stick the hill giant runs off in the other direction. so then u have to chase him down and get him to attack the other hill giant chasing u but with only 18 seconds u don't have much time.<br>When i first read this method i got excited and tried it straight away. i then left after around 6 kills. almost died each time. only do this if u are a high lvl bard and are only wanting the pp not the exp. </blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Charm Kiting - </b>5/8/01 12:55:01 AM<br>~ <b>Fyrsong Bloodyears</b><blockquote>Are you one of those who's heard that bards can't solo?<br><br>Here's a new best friend for you.<br><br>With this song, you can easily solo 2 hill giants at a time.  They call level 40 a hell level.  Drop 2 hill giants at a time, and you'll go through lvl 40 in no time flat and still, not have to worry about mana like those caster types who solo.<br><br>Simply pull your first mob, do a bit of damage to it with your 38 song, then find another one, and charm it.  Once the charmed mob agro's on your first, slightly damaged mob, it will do the work for you.  No need to run in circles because they will both battle it out.  If you're paying attention, your charmed mob will win, and you will have a near dead pet to finish off yourself with your Chant song.  <br><br>Works great with hill giants.  I can usually do about 8 in a row before I need to heal up.  Very fun stuff.  <br><br>Beware though.  You'll have many people trying to 'save' you because they think you're in trouble with 2 mobs chasing you.  <br>Good luck!</blockquote></td></tr></table></blockquote><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href="/songs.asp?&song=45">Back to Normal Mode</a><br><br><br><i>Printed from EQDiva.com on 1/16/03 4:50:32 PM.</i><br><br></td></tr></table>
