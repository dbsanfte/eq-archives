And, unless your autocircling impedes somebody else's game play or annoys them enough to report you to a GM (like practicing your brass skills in the Bazaar would, for example) it's unlikely anybody will even notice.  So, I doubt if you get banned.

As mentioned earlier, you leave out the details of what he was doing specifically, and where he was doing it.  The fact that it even came to the GMs' attention seems to imply he was doing something annoying, in a place where he shouldn't have been doing it.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Funny thing.. people talk about how the EULA prohibits macros and sequences on gamepads, etc...
<br />

<br />
But I've read over the EULA several times recently, and could find no mention of such things.  No mention of any sort of &quot;unattended operation&quot; that people talk about.  All it talks about is using 3rd party software that affects gameplay.  This is so vague that GMs can choose to interpret it however they like, I believe.
<br />

<br />
I think most of &quot;what's prohibited by the EULA&quot; has become hearsay, and people just spread it from person to person, not actually double-checking that it's there somewhere.
<br />

<br />
If I'm wrong and someone can cite the exact paragraph where it talks about this, I'll eat my tattered leather cap

No need for us to get it for you.  You cited it quite nicely in your own post.  The &quot;3rd party software that affects gameplay&quot; reference pretty much defines the programmable macros in a Nostromo gamepad.  And it doesn't even need to be &quot;so vague the GMs can choose to interpret it however they like&quot;.  The example at hand is pretty straightforward.

Would using my Logitech Mouseware software to program the middle button to a specific function be in violation?  It would seem so...

Does mapping hotkeys to buttons on my Nostromo count?  It requires software to do that, and it does Affect Gameplay...

How about using something like Teamspeak, so you have voice communication with other people you group with?  This uses software, and it most certainly Affects Gameplay.

AFK instrument training does not require software, nor does afk autocircle swimming for skill ups.  It can be fairly annoying to have someone practicing Brass in the Bazaar, but not actionable under the clause prohibiting 3rd Party Software.

I'd imagine that they can't find a legal way to enforce a ban on what they really *want* to ban, which is Unattended Operation.  How do they prove you are not there?  </span></td>

Absolutely.

Of course.  And it's illegal.

<br />
Of course not.  You could consider it a violation of the Play Nice rules, and if enough people complain, it could get some GM intervention, but as you correctly state, there's nothing there that would get a player banned...unless it was a recurring problem...which would be actionable under other rules.
<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">I'd imagine that they can't find a legal way to enforce a ban on what they really *want* to ban, which is Unattended Operation. How do they prove you are not there? </span></blockquote>
<br />
Well, that takes the argument to a completely different arena.  Nobody's been asking how they prove you're there or not.  People have been asking &quot;is this a violation of the EULA or not?&quot;  A subtle difference, but definitely a difference.
<br />

<br />
Yes.  All of the things you listed above are violations, because they involve the use of external software to affect in-game play.  I realize you were being sarcastic, listing things that everybody would <b><i>obviously</i></b> agree aren't violations, because they're so trivial.  But, the truth is, under strict interpretation of the EULA...yes...they're all violations.
<br />

<br />
But, again, that's not the point.  The point is, are they <b><i>enough</i></b> of a violation...so obviously a violation that they pretty much <b><i>require</i></b> an action?  Well, no...they're not.  Which is why you thought it was so funny to think they could <b><i>possibly</i></b> be considered violations...and which is why people don't get banned for using them.  They don't effect the game enough for it to be obvious to a 3rd-party observer that a violation is occurring.  Yes, they're all violations, but since nobody but the person breaking the rule could know, obviously you won't get banned for it (nor should you, for any of the minor infractions you listed here to try and make your point).
<br />

<br />
People argue the EULA as if it's a club that Sony uses against players all the time...but I think I know of about 3-4 people in my 4+ years of experience who've been banned for EULA violations...and all of them pretty obvious violations.  Sony shows a lot more tolerance for questionable violations than they're given credit for, in my opinion.  But, if you're doing something that is <b><i>obviously</i></b> a violation to anybody looking on (like sitting in one spot, non-communicative, casting the same spell over and over in excess of 8 hours), then the person doing it shouldn't be surprised when the GMs say or do something about it.  </span></td>

I do use a nostromo game pad for a few specific, attended operations, nearly all are to switch to a specific hot key page and click my clicky items, then switch back to my normal hot key page.
<br />

<br />
This is handy, and doesn't give me much of an advantage over anyone else, I think.  It's just a convenience for my fumbling fingers.
<br />

<br />
I also have one gamepad key assigned to toggle targets, cast mezz, toggle targets so that I can be meleeing while keeping a mob locked down with mezz.  This is, essentially, a four-keystroke sequence when done by hand.  I don't use it that often though, because it's too much of a nuisance, and I'd rather just straight twist with mezz while not meleeing.  My bardic melee just doesn't add enough to the overall dps to be worth the trouble :P</span></td>

That being said,  I totally disagree with Othelia's rigid evaluation of the rule.  But that is Othelia's and SoE's purview.  Maybe time for me and my family guild to move on . . . no one will miss us.  And neither will SoE . . .

I still don't get it.  A Nostromo pressing the &quot;1&quot; key every 11 seconds is not conspicuiously aggregious . . . Don't you think singing your Brass song in EC is just as bad as pressing the 1 key every 30 seconds?  Auto-circle to learn swimming, anyone?  I know playing a ranger, I use(d) one to Kick or Archery . .  and now they are gonna add auto-archery supposedly . . . before a rule break.  Now it's part of the game . . .

Anyway. . . . here is an account of the correspondence with the GM's. . . .

<br />
Would it be possible to understand how long my account has been suspended for? 
<br />

<br />
Also, I really would like to better understand where and when (if ever) a hardware device that repeats a single key stroke is acceptable to use with this game.
<br />

<br />
I personally did not interpret the Nostromo Game Pad I have pressing the same key over and over again while I sat here a violation of the EULA.
<br />

<br />
I am not certain how *modify game play* is interpreted.
<br />

<br />
To me this game is about completing levels in the lost dungeons of Norrath, helping friends to get their epics, breaking into the Plane of Fear. It is about teamwork and cooperation. It is, in short, a social game.
<br />

<br />
There have been many improvements to the UI and controls over time, rather than concessions or cheats, these are game improvements: sanctioned and introduced by Sony/Verant. (The spell book not taking the whole screen, the /book command, the /pause command, etc)
<br />

<br />
Hitting [Bash] then [Taunt] every five seconds until your fingers bleed is not a game; coordinating a raid against the mechanical behemoth is.
<br />

<br />
I can clearly see how third party tools (that I have heard about) like MacroQuest are clearly in violation of the EULA, but I really never believed that my Nostromo was.
<br />

<br />
Again, I was sitting here reading a book, practicing spells and waiting for the GM to respond to my name change petition. While I fully admit that I was not pressing the *1* key on my own every 11 seconds, I certainly could have been.
<br />

<br />
Is this really the kind of offense that you feel people should be suspended or banned for? In EQ2 you have fixed the *skills* process so that a character that levels up already gains the new skills that they achieve. In EQ1 this is much more problematic and it is really a necessity for a character that has leveled up quickly to practice spells over and over (in order to gain the skills required to cast without fizzling). Without these skill points they are of little use in a group.
<br />

<br />
If you tell me that I must press the *1* key over a thousand times on my own in order to level up my skills, and that this is indeed part of what you call the *game play* of the game; then I am sorry, for this is a poor sort of game in my opinion and I doubt that I will level up a new character ever again. 
<br />

<br />
Again, thank you for looking into this matter. I have always been a bit curious about the Nostromo. Everyone that I know (that still plays EQ - I myself have played from 2000 on) uses a Nostromo. Every warrior uses it for an auto [kick] [taunt], every paladin for [bash] [taunt] and every ranger for [Range Attack].
<br />

<br />
If these are all indeed violations, a more explicit warning in the EULA that better defined *modify game play* would be very much appreciated I would gather by both myself and the community at large.
<br />

<br />
Sincerely, 
<br />

Greetings Mr. **PLAYER**,
<br />

<br />
Thank you for getting back to me. I appreciate your comments and your concerns on this situation. Modification of the gaming experience, whether it be through third party software(such as MacroQuest) or third party hardware(such as programming a programmable game pad) is not allowed. Macroing is accomplished in either of these scenarios, where players may achieve gain without effort, and where they in fact do not even have to be present. We also reserve the right to terminate game play if we feel that it is being done inappropriately.
<br />

<br />
The in game tells that I had sent you were to determine if you were, in fact, away from keyboard. I sent a tell to each character. Obviously if a character takes repetitive actions constantly, and they do not respond when contacted, then they are likely not present.
<br />

<br />
I understand your concerns when you say that hitting buttons repeatedly is &quot;not a game,&quot; and you are most welcome to have your opinions and feelings on the matter. However, the game has been designed in the way that it has. If you are unhappy with any content in the game, or with how anything is done, then we strongly encourage a /feedback with your ideas so it may reach our development team for consideration. Posting messages on our official message boards, located at U color=#0000ff www.everquestlive.com/U, is also an excellent way to get your concerns out. This way, the game may continue to change and evolve, as you have described with the UI and controls.
<br />

<br />
The suspensions will last for seven(7) days. Whether or not the accounts are banned is not my decision to make, so please contact EQAccountStatus@soe.sony.com for further information.

My Reply:
<br />

<br />
Thank you for your prompt reply - and the advice.
<br />

<br />
I will be happy to post feedback using the in-game channels when they are once again available to me. If you think the message boards are an appropriate forum as well, I will be utilizing them.
<br />

<br />
To be blunt, I did not think gamepads were in violation of the EULA as it is written. I appreciate the clarification and will endeavor to encourage Sony via /feedback to be clearer in either the in-game Knowledge base or the web base.
<br />

<br />
Answer number 8349 was the only one I could find, and I interpreted this literally (macros are multiple step functions - not single repeated keys).
<br />

<br />
I have maintained three accounts (which I play simultaneously); have been a member since 2000 and even volunteered for the guide program for a while. That said it may be time to find a new game. I truly do not want to get carpel tunnel syndrome pressing 2, 3, 2, 3.
<br />

<br />
Many of my friends have left for other games. I have been loyal to this one, but if this truly is Sony's position (which I have no doubt in your succinct reply that it is). I may give away my gear and cancel my three accounts when all is said and done.
<br />

<br />
Knowing clearly what the rules are I will not break them. That is how I am. However, I believe I have lost my will to play.
<br />

<br />
Again, thank you for your prompt reply and your time.
<br />

people using macroquest to warp around in zones and train raids again and again is not punishable as long as the trainer doesnt commit to its deeds in /tells to the people he trains (no proof = no guilt). His posting about what exactly he did when on several messageboards is not considered.
<br />

<br />
People nowadays don't hide anymore that they are using macroquest with the map function to find nameds aso. I always find it interesting when some non-tracking-class tells me in group that named_xyz is up.
<br />
It's so widespread, there are guilds known for almost entirely using macroquest. NOn of them seems to get banned / suspended.
<br />

<br />
But then a Bard who uses the Nostromo to start a song again and again gets suspended/banned?

				<td colspan="2"><span>These situations alwas bring out the worst in people. No matter what, on an issue like this the views are going to be polarized. 
<br />
   I use a Nostromo, but I've never been banned for it. I've been using gamepads with EQ for almost 4 years now and I have never even been warned. <b>Of course</b> the rules are going to be interpeted by those who enforce them, that's the nature of the beast! I defenitely understand how you can be frustrated, I'm not telling you that your friend is a moron and deserves it, because a lot of the time these situations come down to simple misunderstandings, but this is also the nature of things and there isn't much you can do about it. 
<br />
   If the GM sent him tells, why didn't he get a reply? Is this another fuzzy area? Tell your friend to keep using the N52, it's an awesome tool and in my very humble opinion, it's necessary. The problem is in the interpetation, so while you might think it's BS, it's your duty to be completely aware of this stuff and do everything you can to avoid these situations. 
<br />
<i>Chances are if you even have an inkling that what you're doing could even be a far fetched interpetation of a EULA violation, don't do it!!!</i>
<br />
   Now I know that sucks, and I realize that the GMs have a certain responsibility in this too, I'm not putting it in your lap, I'm just saying it's not <b>all</b> thier fault. 
<br />

<br />
   Look man, don't get all pissed off and leave the game, I don't think that's the right way to handle this situation. These things happen, and like I said these situations are not pretty any way you slice it. Look at California's three strike law, in essence we're looking at the same problem of interpetation. Now don't go quoting me and getting into an argument about semantics on my comparison, you know what I mean here. Anyone can bend this situation one way or another, so let's just call it done and move on.

<br />

<br />
Not the point.  We don't think he cheated.
<br />

<br />
It is our opinion that the EULA was vague on Nostromo's.  <i>And</i> that using a Nostromo does not change game play enough to constitute cheating.  
<br />

<br />
Many in this thread have an opposite opinion.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">are we suppose to feel sad for this guy?</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
Nope, not looking for that.  Just gathering opinions of what other people think.  My friend may leave, I may too, but that will be because I lost a friend in the game.  Not because he got banned.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote"> i like his horrible overgeneralizations...like every one i know uses one HA </span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
Not overgeneralization.  We are a tight group.  We adventure almost exclusively within our group.  Small family guild.  While ALL is not accurate,  many of us do use one.
<br />

<br />
Look.  I play a Ranger,  too.  So I got a quandry here with a common scenario:  when I'm playing in the planes with pet classes, there isn't much I can do without a Cleric/Slower other than pluck with arrows.  To make things easier and take the boredom from hittin 9 9 9 9 9, I roll the wheel up.
<br />

<br />
Rolling that wheel up to auto-archery is fixing a deficiency in the game, for example.  Not cheating, IMO.  Why do I hit with a sword without hitting a key,  but not an arrow?
<br />

<br />
And now,  auto-archery is something that will now be added to the game.  Again,  before it was cheating,  now a part of the game.  Why is that?  I was wrong and cheated before, and now I'll be ok moral and a stand-up citizen of Norrath.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
If we are to look at the rules and judge them effectively, we must look at their intent.  What negative effect are they supposed to stop?
<br />

<br />
If we do not judge them on their intent and only judge by the letter of the law, they become rules for the sake of rules.  They become sclerotic and ineffectual.

I know I did it in many different places and never would have thought it to be against the rules.  I read above people getting in trouble for working on Brass skills in the /bazaar.

				<td colspan="2"><span>SOE did come out a while ago and say that they don't care if you use a gamepad for either twisting or archery or many other things, AS LONG AS YOU DON'T DO IT WHILE AFK. I know, &quot;What about AFK instrument training or swimming?&quot; Well, those are part of the game mechanics, and it's harder to detect someone doing that. But if they suspect you are doing it, they can remove you from the gameworld for it. I have been, for afk instrument training, and it wasn't AE brass in the bazaar/PoK. The tells from the GM were in one of my old logs (sorry, it got erased when I did a reinstall a while back so no proof, but, meh). Granted, I didn't get banned for it, but I got removed from the game world, and if I had logged back on and done it again and that GM saw me, I very easily could of gotten suspended or even banned.
<br />

<br />
SOE has never condoned AFK GAMEPLAY of any sort. Do your macro, but stay at the keyboard. If the GM sends you a tell and you reply right away, chances are they'll leave you alone. In the example I gave where they removed me from the gameworld, the GM sent me 2 tells before he warned me he was going to remove me.</span></td>

If you do something illegal, get arrested for it and sentenced to 10 years in prison, then a week later they make whatever it is you did legal you still have to serve your term.  They don't just let you out of jail because what you did is no longer illegal.  Of course, you can try appealing and such, but the simple fact is that it was illegal when you did it, you broke the law and are being punnished for breaking the law, not for doing whatever it is you did.
<br />

<br />
Perhaps a better analogy would be if you are driving 65 in a 45 zone and get a ticket, but before you pay the ticket they raise the speed limit to 65, you still have to pay the ticket.
<br />

<br />
Now, we are talking about Sony; a private company, not the US DOJ.  A private company that licenses you the ability to use their software, on their equipment, over their connection, under their rules.  Being that you have the option of not paying for their service if you don't like the way they do things, there is little recourse for you.  They welcome opinions from their user-base, but are under no obligation to agree with said opinion.

Personally, I think the GM over-reacted by suspending the account, but then again, perhaps it wasn't the smartest thing in the world to file a petition, then go afk while running an unattended macro KNOWING the GM had a very real chance of showing up and noticing you running that unattended macro.
<br />

<br />
For what it's worth, I doubt you'll get banned.  After the 7 day suspension, you'll probably be back in.</span></td>
