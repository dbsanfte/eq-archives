<b>No &quot;wince&quot; message in HoT - </b>10/16/02 6:12:47 PM<br>~ <b>Starrsong</b><blockquote>Raid Leaders have specifically requested that bards sing this song when we encounter certain casting mobs in HoT to help prevent them from gating.  Many times when I play it I get the message that the mob has resisted the song - but, other than that - I get NO message whatsoever.  I have yet to see &quot;your target winces&quot; (or the like).  Am I doing something wrong?  I have tried various positions - some right under their bellys - and still have had no reassurance that the song is working.  I am hoping, when I don't see a &quot;resist&quot; message, that it's doing the trick - but, I can't assume it.  Can anyone help?</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Song Usefulness - </b>10/3/02 11:38:45 AM<br>~ <b>Feydrioron</b><blockquote>Two answer two reoccuring questions,<br>No, this song does not add any mana to your pool, it mearly AE drains it from the casters around you.  And No, this song won't break mez, only songs/spells/attacks that do damage break mez.  Other than that, I haven't raised my brass skill high enough to make these songs very worthwhile, and while I don't see a whole lot of upcoming use for these songs anyway, I suppose it would be good if you're fighting a whole lot of caster mobs, just one and you probably couldn't drain enough mana before it died.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Mana test - </b>8/14/02 2:14:00 AM<br>~ <b>Daemyan</b><blockquote>I tested this song (see L32 mana song for details) and got 34 mana drain, 81 with an immaculate shell horn at L 58.  If you're dueling someone for fun, make sure you're not grouped with them.  This song will not affect group members even if you're in a duel.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Blue server Duels?? - </b>7/1/02 4:16:28 PM<br>~ <b>Ladyfingers</b><blockquote>Does this song not work in bluebie server duels?  Dueled a necro, feared him and his pet, mezzed him, and tried playing this song--jack happened.   I wound up fearkiting the necro (always fun).  He got a couple dots off on me, but I was able to finish him off and start playing regen fast enough that I saved myself from the accursed exp death that can follow a necro duel, but I still don't understand why the mana drain didn't work on him.  I was standing close enough to see the color of his beady little eyes and then some...when the pet returned from fear, it got that nice orange lens flare on it and gave the &quot;winces&quot; message, but the necro never even got that much.  His MR blew, as I found out...only 90 with a MR buff up, and my mez went through easily 2/3 of the time or better.  Why didn't aoe mana drain hit him?</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Prevent the mob who Complete Heals! - </b>1/14/02 12:35:12 PM<br>~ <b>Kocho Divah</b><blockquote>Okay, I was in Maidens fighting the 4-armed Xin Thall Centiens. We would fight one, only to have it CH (Complete Heal) itself. Very discouraging, especially if it was the level 58 type. <br><br>Now, every bard has told me that our Mana Drain song isn't worth playing, so I never played it. Well, I decided to try it. It was actually kind of fun, I could leave this song playing and take a break from twisting. It really did drain all their mana! After about halfway through the fight, I could stop playing this song, and no more heals (or nukes) from the mob! It was well worth the twist in this case.<br><br>Kocho Divah<br>57 Bard of Druzzil Ro</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Hmm.. - </b>11/25/01 10:21:51 PM<br>~ <b>Seri Softsynger</b><blockquote>Where as mana regen is.. horrid.. and I hate it.. and if I'm out of mana from charm kiting, I'd rather group for two hours than sit and regen it.. somebody sparked a thought in my mind tonight.  Does this song take the mana and put it in your pool or not?  I've heard both yes and no.  I do not have time to test it tonight.  But if this enhanced our mana regen by even the smallest fraction, it would be very very nice.  Just mez two mobs, and suck up their mana, get back to charm life.  Sounds like a good deal to me.  It's too late for me to test it myself, but I will be trying it tommorrow.  Please email me your own test results.  I'm hoping it works.  ;)<br><br>  -Seri Softsynger<br>    Singer of the 52nd Song<br>     Innoruuk Server</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>wont break mez - </b>10/22/01 10:00:46 AM<br>~ <b>Onix Blackhart</b><blockquote>only thing that breaks mez is something that does damage, thats why you can't mez a dotted mob because the dot will keep breaking mez.  I been looking forward to this song since 33 when i found out we had it, because i realy like dueling as a bard... *sigh* sux though, i get them to 10% hp then couple songs get resisted and then i die... they always give me a tell telling me good fight and that they thought they where done till the resisted so and so... *sigh*</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Duelling tonight - </b>10/3/01 6:28:10 AM<br>~ <b>Bw*</b><blockquote>Well folks since no one has posted otherwise, I'll try out twisting this in with mez. Sure it'll take a while to drain the mana from a 50 druid but at least I'll win (assuming no resists etc etc).<br><br>One thing: is it a 3 tick duration that removes 25 mana per tick or does work like CCC where you have to leave the song running?</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>Would this strategy be effective? - </b>5/18/01 8:35:20 PM<br>~ <b>Kakiniku</b><blockquote>I have two Gnoll Hide Lariats in the bank which I have on reserve until level 25 when they proc Stun.  I was thinking if I find a nasty Iksar caster, I could possibly keep it stunned while tearing away at its mana :)<br><br>After that, I'm sure that they will be a complete push over bound in chains of music.  *giggle* oh well I'll keep practicing my music until I'm ready to learn this song :)</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>umm...hey! =)  - </b>3/13/01 10:05:21 PM<br>~ <b>Volito Nightwish</b><blockquote>Well, this song isn't that useless =) I mean say your in Arena, and your group dueling. I do this a lot. as soon as the duel starts, an enchanter mezzes all of them. now, enchanter mezzes last A WHILE... so you just walk your little bard butt over there and mana drain the cleric ranger paladin wizard, whatever... all at the same time since its AE. think about how much firepower your taking from them, and how much less they can heal themselves... </blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
