				<td colspan="2"><span>alright, this is kinda of a rant post but here we go.
<br />

<br />
First off i'd like to start with GoD, i think this expansion is the first off to lead in the downfall of EQ, although i do not have this expansion (therefore cant comment on any of the zone content or anything) but GoD seems to have just popped out of nowwhere, its somewhere on norrath (island?) also some of the loot of the upper tier zones is sickaning, i mean u pretty much already got epic 2.0's out there, go look in ugua or txiciutsn or sghbdfiugbd (were they on crack when they made those names?), ok now on to OoW, i admit being lvl 70 would be pretty cool but just think about what bards and druids and other soloing classes will be able to do, epic 1.0's will take a total of 2 hours, unless u have to camp something, in PoP 2 ppl will take out LMM (on E`ci someone did it with 11) ppl will be able to farm anything, and quarm will be like farming HQ bear pelts (although on some servers this already happens) i just think OoW will complete the downfall of EQ.
<br />

sorry if i sound like a noob or whatever, go ahead flame away =P

				<td colspan="2"><span>It's called progression, or mudflation, as some would call it. I think it's somewhat of a necessary thing, but I'm a high-end raider so my opinion is probably different from a lot of the more casual gamers. A lot of guilds finished PoP and were forced to sit around and farm PoTime for months because they didn't have anything better to do since there was no more content to progress through. Finally GoD comes out and everyone is merrily making their way through it again. Soon GoD will be conquered and everyone will move on to OoW. The items will get better, the mobs will get harder, it's just a natural progression. The older content will become more and more trivial, but the way I see it, that's going to happen when you have a game that's been running for this long.
<br />

<br />
Also, the increase in player power derived from easier availablity of more powerful items gives lower guilds that previously would not be able to do some content the ability to do so, so it's not like the progression is only for the uberguilds. 
<br />

<br />
Like I said, this is from a high end point of view. But I would think a lot of the casual gamers could relate to some degree, too. Grinding in DL, or PoN, or LDoN gets boring after you've done it ten billion times. You want new content to see and experience, do you not? The game-wide progression of stronger items/skills/levels will help you do that newer content.
<br />

<br />
I personally am enjoying EQ at the moment, and am looking forward to new experiences in OoW. I think I enjoy it more becuase of my guild than the acutal game, but I have to say I've had less complaints now than I've probably ever had in my 3 1/2 years of EQ. I've always loved raiding and I really do like some of the encounters in GoD. Does it bother me that older content is made trivial? Not really, they were fun and challenging in their own time. Without a progression, I think EQ would stagnate and die rather quickly. I don't really expect everyone to agree with me, but that's just my 2cp<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" /></span></td>

<br />

<br />
As far as eq goes (and it's expansions), several weeks ago I had NO intention whatsoever of buying ANY more expansions.  I, like so many other people, was frustrated with the accumulation of older &quot;broken&quot; content that wasn't getting fixed, as well as SOE's apparent lack of caring for customer concerns.  Then &quot;The Summit&quot; happened.  Out of that, came class representatives, Top 10 Class Issues (that SOE has promised to keep giving status updates on), etc.  I choose (for the time being) to give SOE the benefit of the doubt that they are finally listening to our concerns and are doing something about those concerns.  Heck, fixing off-hand double-attack was a smaller concern on our list, but it's fixed now.  *Cheer*  I suppose I'll go ahead and buy the new OOW expansion because I choose to believe (at this point) that SOE is starting to REALLY try to please us (player base).
<br />

<br />
You can bet that I won't purchase any more expansions, though, if they (SOE) drop the ball on &quot;player relations&quot; again.  Time will certainly tell.

Out of that, came class representatives, Top 10 Class Issues (that SOE has promised to keep giving status updates on), etc. I choose (for the time being) to give SOE the benefit of the doubt that they are finally listening to our concerns and are doing something about those concerns. Heck, fixing off-hand double-attack was a smaller concern on our list, but it's fixed now. *Cheer* I suppose I'll go ahead and buy the new OOW expansion because I choose to believe (at this point) that SOE is starting to REALLY try to please us (player base). 
<br />

<br />
You can bet that I won't purchase any more expansions, though, if they (SOE) drop the ball on &quot;player relations&quot; again. Time will certainly tell. </span></blockquote> 
<br />

<br />

<br />
So far the only thing thats come out of the top 10 list is more &quot;we're looking into it&quot;.  Same tune we've heard forever, nothing new yet.  All the updates have done is change the date and repost.  So, they are just telling us they are &quot;looking into it&quot; more often.  Still no net change.

<br />
I am looking forward to OOW (I did not buy GOD). It had mentioned areas to SOLO and also more groupable content. I am looking forward to going to level 70. At that level I am hoping to be able to do some of the raid content with a much smaller amount of people. For a lot of people this will mean the difference between being able to see some content and not ever seeing it at all.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I got to agree with Fleetnote and anasong.  Since Velious people have complained about expansions and whatnot but in reality it is just a natural progression of the game.  Many many people would never have even seen their epics if lvl cap wasn't raised to 65, same goes for better items/equipment.  As the top guilds get better stuff the rest of it starts to trickle down.  The top guilds move on leaving room for smaller guilds to raid. Those guilds also inherit tactics and equipment.  Its just kinda the way it goes I guess.  I had 12 people when I got my epic.  I was 60ish at the time but most others were 65 and it was almost overkill.  I dunno as a more casual gamer I like the ability to do things and get things that I wouldn't be able to get without the help of large guilds.  Anyway thats all I got just my opinion, later

				<td colspan="2"><span>I don't want to go too far here and I don't want this to come across as a flame but here goes....
<br />
   People are way too caught up in this stuff. 90% of the problems in EQ between class wars and rude encouters come from ignorance and the fact that most people feel comfortable making themselves part of a group and feel the need to stubbornly defend said group, otherwise it's like admitting they were wrong. I mean this class to class, but I also mean it with EQ itself. It's a cycle and if you tell yourself anything else you're not fooling anyone. I won't say anything as stupid as &quot;It's a god d*mn video game get over it!&quot; because it's obviously not that simple or there wouldn't be message boards like this. You don't need to justify anything, if you want to spend $40.00 on a game, then dammit do it because you want to. If you don't like where the game is going, then you've got to do something about it for YOURSELF. Make a new toon, pick a new server, try PvP, or take a break for once. People act so helpless, like there's these big wigs up there at SoE calling all the shots and there's nothing they can do about it, consumer power is Amazing in itself but freedom of choice is at the root of it all. Do something for yourself, it's the only way. One day they're going to pull the plug, no matter how much it pisses people off, and all the decisions we try to justify, all the time spent is going to be history, a lot of people are going to realize we've been wrong all along. 
<br />
  Now, I realize there's more to it than that. This is a community, I think the sense of community has a lot to do with what makes people play EQ for so long, but within the community are individuals. I stopped playing every day about 2 months ago and my entire view of the game has changed. I talk to my old EQ friends through AIM, e-mail and even on the phone, but I barely play once a week now. The concerns for balance are gone, the gameplay is fresh and I am, in general, much more happy with things in game and out. Yeh I won't see plane of time, upper GoD or the upper OoW but I will absolutely still see people bickering and wasting all sorts of time being totally pissed off about something they honestly have complete control over and don't even realize it. 
<br />
   Don't limit yourself is all I'm trying to say. If you want to care about something, care about the people in the game who make you feel good and make you glad to play, they're the ones who deserve attention, not some yuppie sitting behind his desk calling all the shots on new content. Screw that guy, screw OoW, screw WoW and screw Vanguard, the people are what matter and if everyone's going to get caught up in taking sides on something like this, individuals will continue to get overlooked and  lose what makes this game so much fun, individuality itself. 
<br />
   Think about the best times you've had in EQ, they've never been because of the content, they've always been because of the people you meet and bond with, that's how I see it anyways. The only reason I even sign on anymore is because of the folks I've met and I'm always really happy to see them, whether I'm in GoD, Kunark, Velious or what have you, it doesn't matter one bit. I see a bunch of money hungry morons with absolutely no clue what people really want, running this game. Sometimes they hit it, sometimes they miss it, but either way we keep playing, which proves my point because if the content was really that important, most of us would have quit by now. Screw it man, I'm all over the place and I don't know where I'm really going with this but I hope I made at least one or two decent points. Just try and be careful what you put your energy into, sometimes something seems so obvious, but well all know hindsight is never 20/20. 
<br />

<br />
And I'm spent.

				<td colspan="2"><span>You also have to view the point <b>MOST</b> People play the game.. &quot;I wanna be the best i can with the best stuff!&quot;  
<br />

<br />
Thats the most common reason pick to play games.. they want the most/best out of it.. when they realize how much effort and time it takes thats when they get pissed and start realizing all the little issues..
<br />

<br />
People fight over Class Vs Class WHY? 
<br />

<br />
Whats the point?
<br />

<br />
Nerf this nerf that this class is better then this class..
<br />

<br />
Why not just Bounce the classes up to equal each other instead of *NERFING* ... 
<br />

<br />
Making everything weaker will just make everything harder correct?
<br />

<br />
Yes people want a challenge but what's the reason if you want to be the best.. if you wanted to be the best you would want whatever you kill to die in a couple hits...
<br />

<br />
Yes most want this but it's not going to happen..
<br />

<br />
OoW is going to get people to buy it for a couple reason's.. 1 extra Spell gem and lvl 70.. with more content and raiding abilities.. AA's and all..
<br />

<br />
OoW isn't going to attract the Casual Gamer as much as it will the Hardcore Raider..
<br />

<br />
Why?
<br />

<br />
1 Casual gamers what to have fun, look at the game it is and gets Pissed that there not uber like all the hardcore people are..
<br />

<br />
2 Hardcore Raiders want new Content you can ask almost every last one of em they will say i want something new to raid.. Raid Raid Raid.. most of the time you dont see the Hardcore raider complaining about their Class problems unless it's really severe to their Raiding ability..
<br />

<br />
Hardcore raiders complain less because what they complain about is Content all the people that complain are the casual's that want everything to be easier..
<br />

<br />
If i cant be as good as them they shouldn't be that good either..
<br />

<br />
OoW will attract a crowd.. and it will ruin a crowd.. what does it matter..
<br />

<br />
All the people complain complain complain.. why not look at the reason you picked the game up.. I believe you didnt pick it up to complain.. No you did it because it looked cool and it would be fun..
<br />

<br />
Well have fun and stop complaining.. play with your friends and not all the moron's that make your gaming Worse..
<br />

<br />
Do things that you enjoy and have fun doing in the game not what you are going to get pissed off about..
<br />

<br />
Complaining has never done anything other then make SoE say ok we are looking into it, or it's coming soon and never does.. If we complain we are not going anywhere other then getting some Steam off of us.. it may Relief some pressure but it's not going to make the end result of the game any better..
<br />

<br />
What happened when you were a Kid? You complained about something that your parents told you to do and you got yelled at, or spanked, etc. etc... But we complain cause we can..
<br />

<br />
If we complain less We would obviously be caring what happens with the Game right? 
<br />

<br />
Wrong if they were to pull the plug now what would happen?
<br />

<br />
You all would get pissed cause you couldn't play EQ anymore.. You wouldnt be complaining about the problems.. you look at the bigger things more then the smaller things.. 
<br />

<br />
If there was no EQ you wouldnt be arguing about Bug after Bug or Fix class after class.. you wouldnt be complaining that the Expansions are a waste of time just to get more people hooked and to waste more money..
<br />

<br />
People have their Preferances and im not telling you to stop complaining im telling you that it's not helping anymore then making SoE realize something that they already knew that they were doing...
<br />

<br />
Bug's arent something they knew happened.. but the priority to them is new items/content/Uber stuff.. 
<br />

<br />
The order of fixes go like this..
<br />

<br />
Content
<br />
raiding
<br />
uber
<br />
items
<br />
quests
<br />
.
<br />
.
<br />
.
<br />
.
<br />
.
<br />
.
<br />
.
<br />
.
<br />
Class...
<br />
Bug's (dead last)
<br />

<br />

<br />
They don't really care about the small things that are making the game more (unbearable) So we tell them the bug's their like ok.. Save this bug report here in the (5 year dust pile of other bugs) and lets get onto this next expansion
<br />

<br />
I do see many points that we want fixxed, and i see alot of pointless Complaining..
<br />

<br />
Their are things we want fixxed and SoE (WONT) ever fix and yes i mean ever.. they will destroy the game before they would think of fixxing them..
<br />

<br />
I wouldn't worry about EQ so much it's 5+ years old.. (i think)
<br />

<br />
Play the game to play it.. have fun enjoy the memories, (WHILE IT LASTS) because EQ isn't going to be here forever..
<br />

<br />
And do what's fun.. Not what is going to piss you off..
<br />

<br />

				<td colspan="2"><span>I think it is funny when someone complains about expansions making older content trivial.  Every single expansion has done this.  Kunark made Original EQ trivial, Velious did it to Kunark, etc.  The only two expansions that really did not have this effect were LDoN and LoY.  Both of these were aimed at casual players, and as such, did not raise the bar.
<br />

<br />
I will say that I really like GoD.  There are plenty of things that do irritate me (54 person raid limit, some of the itemization), but it brought back the difficulty to the game.  I started EQ at the release of Kunark, and the game was &quot;hard&quot; then.  Dying was easy, and rezzes were difficult to get.  Fear was a full raid, and a wipe meant getting help from other guilds.  You could fall into the Hole in Paineel, and hae to petition for your corpse.  
<br />

<br />
Over time, the game was made easier and easier.  Graveyards, PoK books, much lower mob densities, a lot of outdoor zones.  Invisible rails on bridges and chasms in LDoN compared to the gorge in the Deep is a good example.  I guess Sony figured that the game would appeal to more people if the element of danger was removed.  Instead, it made the game boring in my opinion.
<br />

<br />
Back to the GoD/OoW discussion.  Gone are the graveyards, 1 hop from PoK, invisible rails, and low mob densities.  eope traveled in groups from Natimbi to Barindu for safety.  You brought an alt rezzer to prevent hideous CR's.  It brought the challenge back.  I believe it brought the fun back.

Real exciting?

That said, I think Omens will be just the jolt this game needs.  Level 70 will finally open up PoP to the casual players, as flagging raids that just weren't possible before will then be completable.
<br />

<br />
I fully expect to see casual guilds in Time.  And the ubers will be content with the stuff tuned for 72/54 level 70s in Omens, so all is well on that front also.
<br />

<br />
One thing I will say is that the current song lineup on Test had better change, or that part of Omens is going to be 100% ho hum (except for the Charm).</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>OoW is the last chance I'm giving SOE.  
<br />

<br />
GoD, LoY, and LDoN were all sad sad excuses for &quot;expansions&quot;.  Look at the amount of content VERANT (yes the good development team) gave with the first 2 expansions and then SOE got off to a good start with their first two.  You could go from lvl 1 to 60 in Kunark or Luclin.  Even though PoP was geared towards the high end game, they didn't SCREW over the non-ubers, by say.. making all new spells no drop.
<br />

<br />
But after PoP, everything went downhill and they released these small one disc expansions that were just an insult for the amount of money they costed.  LDoN was a cool idea.. but really got old fast.  The entire LoY expansion could have been a patch..
<br />

<br />
But GoD was the last straw.  A one disc expansion geared ENTIRELY towards the very upper end.  They still tricked everyone into buying it cuz of the new class.  This was not an expansion.  An expansion should take more than two months for the top guilds to defeat.  Take a clue from what Verant did with the first two and then the huge amount of content in Luclin and PoP and stop dishing out these rushed crappy rip-offs you call expansions.
<br />

<br />
what the h*ll happened to the original lore in Everquest that people cared about?  Veeshan, the Sleeper, Dragons and the factions of goblins and stuff that followed them?  I don't give a crap about some Wayfarer Brotherhood.
<br />

<br />
OoW looks like it might have some sort of decent lore to it.  I guess SOE is getting the clue that some people still care about that.  I'll give it a chance, but if its another crappy 1-disc lvl 65+ expansion, forget it.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>A lot of talk about this has been done on The Concert Hall boards. Basicly  the songs on test are the &quot;base songs&quot;. That is to say these are the songs that you know are gonna be there. They have a few more songs coming that are a bit more &quot;imaginative&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Sad.. the whole idea of a bard was to have it so all our spells would be useable for the life of the toon. Our 1st level song was to get more and more powerful each level, it was supposed to scale with us as we grew in levels. That had changed a while back and now we get the same base songs over and over again... Just somthing we should get  used to I guess.
<br />

<br />
Don't get too excited about a new charm... it has a short range and is meant for CC purposes only, they have nerfed it so we cant use it to swarm kite.... This could quite possibly mean I no longer play my bard.. and perhaps quit EQ all together.</span></td>

Now obviously everyone is going to complain some. But for those who really despise soe and what they've done with the expansions, guess what....you're the morons not them. It does seem like they're putting less and less effort into it, but ya know what? You're paying them more and more. Who's winning here?
<br />

<br />
And to complain about an expansion without even buying it? That's garbarge. You don't have to be uber to appreciate GoD. I'm not. My guild is not even Solro flagged and I love GoD. I do sewers, vxed, and tipt on a daily basis. Look at my magelo I assure you i'm not uber.
