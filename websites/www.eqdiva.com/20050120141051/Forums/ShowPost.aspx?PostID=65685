				<td colspan="2"><span>I may not be the top bard or even the most knowledgeable bard, but I have played Kelraz since a few weeks before Kunark's release. Regrettably prior I was mislead and played a Ranger -- what was I thinking?! Originally my class was one that was unique, people were stunned with my abilities even back in the Oasis of Marr. Today people are still stunned at some of our abilities, but 70 levels later a lot has changed. Here is my take on where the bard class has gone, and where it is currently lacking. I'll admit this is pretty much motivated to get our class retuned as we've gone from one of the most overpowered classes in the game to one of the most underpowered in a very short period of time and while I'd never expect being top dog again I'd at least like to have something to contribute.
<br />

<br />
<b>Original EQ + Kunark:</b>
<br />
In the first two expansions bards were known as the &quot;jack of all trades and masters of none&quot; but that wasn't exactly the case. It is true that when trying to crowd control from Guk to SolB to Sebilis we never quite matched up with our enchanter counterparts. We couldn't tank nearly as well as a Paladin or Warrior. We couldn't dish the damage out as well as a Monk or Rogue. We simply fell right in the middle -- we could do damage, we could crowd control (though with charm in addition to mez we certainly excelled in some of these places), and we could tank. We didn't even need a cleric to heal us but shamans and druids and even paladins could step up and take care of us. Lastly however, the one thing we did have unique to our class was the group resist songs and ability to pull better than any of the other classes using selos and invis in Veeshan's Peak. 
<br />

<br />
<b>Velious:</b>
<br />
Velious was the true birth of the raid bard, as we now had specialized group abilities such as stacking haste. We would be able to increase the damage output of a group of rogues, increase the damage shield on our tank during a Vindicator run, even crank out a little extra mana in the cleric groups. Velious gave birth to the &quot;debuffing&quot; bard as well with Occlusion of Sound (while we did have the 3 chants prior to Velious, not many bards utilized them for debuffing on the same scale that OoS would later be utilized). Lastly we shined in NToV with our resist songs once again only on a grander scale. 
<br />

<br />
<b>Luclin:</b>
<br />
Some controversial, but beneficial, changes came in the Luclin era. While our group resists potential was decreased, AE songs were added that were slightly-weaker making it so that we could support a raid with a smaller number of bards than before. Overhaste upgrades on the Evaj line were made and our songs now actually sang over the haste cap. Additional trinkets such as Amplification and our weapon proc line were added. Bards were ultimately sitting pretty as we could crowd control some of the new encounters (Emp Ssra's lil posse) and still maintain our prior duties of providing mana and resists.
<br />

<br />
<b>Planes of Power:</b>
<br />
The single most powerful increase, and decrease, in our classes power happened during the Planes of Power expansion. Our tanking abilities plummeted, and charm was no longer as viable an option for crowd control due to the inherent risks involved. While our charming cousins of Enchanters and Druids could solo their entire Bastion of Thunder key we had to sit back and watch them work -- and loot the medals later. However we were blessed with a number of abilities that don't even need definition: Fading Memories, Psalm of Veeshan, Poison/Disease chants, Rizlona's. All of our good songs got upgrades making them great songs, and the new songs added such diversity that the bards became quite the envy of other classes. True, enchanters could still out-CC us. True, we could no longer tank anymore ... but we were still on top. Guilds simply couldn't, and still to this day, raid in the Planes of Power without a handful of bards to keep their mana supplies up, their resists high, and their wizards nuking hard.
<br />

<br />
<b>Legacy of Ykesha, Lost Dungeons:</b>
<br />
Our power never really dipped here, but never really grew. LoY gave us the ability to cure poison and disease, an ability we were supposed to have but never really panned out well back in the original EQ release. Lost Dungeons gave us an upgrade to Rizlonas that had us amplify DOTs as well as DDs, but truthfully the damage added compared to the damage added when we first got Rizlonas isn't nearly as noticeable.
<br />

<br />
<b>Gates of Discord:</b>
<br />
The beginning of the end I fear, in GoD we lost our ability to pull as most monsters in the Ikkinz and Uqua and higher end zones now see invis and a monk is far better at splitting them (not that I mind). AE mana has become less of a tool and more of a death trap as on every incoming a bard or two takes the plunge. Our songs became carbon copies with a little upgrade as the songs prior, and the new song is not very high up on the usefulness chart. Some guilds now report benching classes such as Bards and Rangers because the Planes of Power requirement of 72 now leaves 18 people outside and bards and rangers pale compared to monks in damage and usefulness to the guild in various events (Uqua, Ikkinz, etc.)
<br />

<br />
<b>Omens of War:</b>
<br />
And then it happens. We gain 5 levels and seem to go nowhere in potential while all the other classes race by us. We gained a few useful AAs, but not many. Our epic has a effect that has a lot of potential -- but so do all the epics. The main problem I see is the direction raiding is going (thus not making room for all classes to add something) as well as our newest song lineup. For the sake of argument we'll base all numbers on a 2.2 mod (say you have the new epic 1.5 or elemental+ gear) with all the applicable AAs and a VotS.
<br />

<br />
<u>Luvwen's Aria of Serenity(66): </u> While a 5 max level upgrade on Silent Song of Quellious(61) regarding &quot;Reaction Radius&quot; this song is missing the &quot;Frenzy Radius&quot; component thus making it not nearly as useful as Silent Song of Quellious in a number of situations. 
<br />

<br />
<u>Vulka's Chant of Disease(66):</u> These songs are an upgrade in damage (kinda), increasing the DOT by 21/tic (29 with best drum) but the debuff remains the exact same. Actually prior to level 70 you get a more powerful debuff from the old chants than you would with the new ones.
<br />

<br />
<u>Bellow of Chaos(66):</u> A 61 point increase in our DD over a song we got 5 levels and 3 expansions prior. 71 with Puretone or a better than 2.2 mod item or with Shadowsong cloak. 
<br />

<br />
<u>Zuriki's Song of Shenanigans(67):</u> A slight upgrade to Melody of Mischief by 30/tic but the Slow % is the same and half of the time the DOT won't land anyway - even when AEing something static such as the entrance to Phase 5 in the Plane of Time. 
<br />

<br />
<u>Vulka's Chant of Frost(67):</u> see Chant of Disease
<br />

<br />
<u>Luvwen's Lullaby(67):</u> Technically an upgrade to Dreams of Thule I imagine with far worse planning. In Planes of Power, most people had a struggle to get their level 64 mez (Dreams of Terris) so it made sense to have 3 different mezzes (1 ethereal, 1 spectral, and 1 rune). The push and pull were noted a nuisance, as to why the level 65 mez was so nice. Now rather it seems that’s a feature with this new under thought song. This also features half the casting range as the level 65 mez most are familiar with using making this a slight upgrade, a slight downgrade.
<br />

<br />
<u>Cantata of Life(67):</u> As a 3 mana and 15 hp/tic (21 hp/tic with the best lute) increase to Wind of Marr this is the first song that almost seems reasonably thought out.
<br />

<br />
<u>Vulka's Chant of Poison(68):</u> see Chant of Disease
<br />

<br />
<u>War March of Muram(68):</u> Could be considered a massive upgrade to War March of the Mastrug if most players weren't always capped with strength. An 83 point Strength increase (141 with the best Horn), 33 Attack (46), 25 DS (29) is only a slight upgrade over Mastrug, but not as bad as most other songs in our lineup.
<br />

<br />
<u>Yelhun's Mystic Call(68):</u> Like so many of our other songs, simply increasing the max level makes it an &quot;upgrade&quot; though in reality compared to Echo of the Trusik (25% compared to 15% and no loss of DOT focus). Even keeping the lack of DOT component aside, this song is in fact weaker than Echo of the Trusik for spells of every level other than 70. For level 66 spells it is 7.5% weaker, level 67 it is 5% weaker, level 68 it is 2.5% weaker, level 69 it is the exact same (but still missing DOT component) and at level 70 it is only 2.5% weaker than Echo of Trusik, though still missing its DOT component (thus still being weaker). This is by far the worst &quot;upgrade&quot; which is undeniably weaker in every possible scenario than its level 65 counterpart.
<br />

<br />
<u>Verse of Vesagran(69):</u> This was ALMOST a decent song, but it seems someone with little understanding of the bard class put the recast time on it. If the song had a 8 or 6 recast it could be twisted traditionally however the 15 makes this song impossible to twist plus it doesn't remain for the duration of the recast. 5% spellshield / shielding is something people can find on a single PoTime item - I don't believe a group version of the song lasting the entire duration of a twist is overpowering. If no songs get looked at other than this one, we'd at least walk away with one useful song that is actually one we could utilize in a standard twist. 
<br />

<br />
<u>Chorus of Life(69):</u> see Cantana of Life - same song, AE version
<br />

<br />
<u>Eriki's Psalm of Power(69):</u> This sadly is another form of an &quot;upgrade&quot; where the spell is the exact same as the 65 counterpart (Echo of Trusik) but has a 5 level increase. 
<br />

<br />
<u>Vulka's Chant of Flame(70):</u> see Chant of Disease
<br />

<br />
<u>Vulka's Lullaby(70): </u> Another form of an &quot;upgrade&quot; but simply the level limit increased over Lullaby of Morell - while I can understand that these forms of upgrades for things like Mez and Charm are necessary and beneficial, two mezzes is one too many in my opinion where the level 68 one should have retained the benefits of the level 65 version.
<br />

<br />
<u>Voice of the Vampire(70):</u> Actually this song is a pretty decent upgrade.
<br />

<br />
<u>Ancient: Call of Power(70):</u> An actual legitimate upgrade to the Echo of Trusilk song, this will increase DD and DOT power by 5%.
<br />

<br />
Now, a summary. Basically we were given 17 new songs in the new expansion. Of these 17, two were downgrades: Luvwen's Aria of Serenity and Yelhun's Mystic Call. Then we have 5 songs that are practically worthless due to 2 recent nerfs, chant agro and the AE song nerf: Zuriki's Song of Shenanigans and our 4 new chants. 
<br />

<br />
We were given only one new or unique song, Verse of Vesagran. This song was disappointing for the reasons outlined above, mostly because of the reuse timer. A bard is simply unable to twist this song realistically with a timer of 15.
<br />

<br />
Other songs were simply a disappointing increase in power compared to other classes. Our DOTs +29 damage/tic increase compared to say, the difference between the Shaman Blood of Yoppa(70) and Blood of Saryrn(65) was an increase of 122 damage/tic. Even their weakest upgrade between Breath of Wunshi(67) and Breath of Ultor(64) is 49 damage/tic. Druids have similar increase in their damage output as Wasp Swarm(68) is 116 more damage/tic than its predecessor Swarming Death(63) and their GoD DOT Sylvan Embers(65) gets a 38 damage/tic increase with Immolation of the Sun(67), a 52 damage/tic increase over their PoP DOT Immolation of Ro(62). Lets not forget that these values are unmodded, where all the bard data included is modded plus we can't use regular spell foci that all other casters can.
<br />

<br />
More disappointment comes with our upgraded buffs, such as War March of Muram which simply is a copy/paste increase. While the increase levels are on par with other classes, the enchanters also get a +20 chance to critical on their haste and the shaman get a 85 point str/dex stat increase over the cap on their focus. 
<br />

<br />
Some songs are acceptable upgrades in my eyes. Cantata of Life and Chorus of Life have similar increases as their Druid and Enchanter counterparts Oaken Vigor (+20 hp/tic increase) and Voice of Quellious (+2 mana/tic increase). Vulka's Lullaby, Voice of the Vampire, and Ancient: Call of Power one can't really ask for much more than what we got on these. Even Bellow of Chaos was an acceptable increase in damage. However an expansion isn't made up around 5 &quot;acceptable&quot; songs and 1 song that is new, decent, but not designed with the end user in mind. Our songs ultimately need some serious work. Improving (fixing) Puretone and giving bards the ability to use certain foci will help to get the songs in line. Removing the instrument caps would help even more. However ultimately there is a lot of work to be done. 
<br />

<br />
My suggestions would start with fixing Verse of Vesagran, then add something to the OoW Rizlona line to make them legitimate upgrades on their GoD predecessors. Then there's still a lot of songs left to be fixed or re-tuned but at least it'd be a start. Frankly, its disappointing how little thought went into these songs when on the EQLive boards we were told by Ashlanne over at <a target="_new" href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=bardbalance&amp;message.id=1416  ">http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=bardbalance&amp;message.id=1416  </a> that they were works in progress and would get updated in the future - but didn't. 
<br />

<br />
Prior to OoW I was very happy with my class. I'll admit that the total worthlessness of any wind mod over 1.8 (Shroud of Provocation worthless?) is frustrating. There were definitely a few bugs with the class, though I always felt strongly that our class was fine just the way we were. If you don't believe me, check out these threads to prove my one-sidedness to the whole issue: <a target="_new" href="http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallfrm14.showMessage?topicID=8.topic">http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallfrm14.showMessage?topicID=8.topic</a>, <a target="_new" href="http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallfrm14.showMessage?topicID=2.topic">http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallfrm14.showMessage?topicID=2.topic</a>. I had no problem being a SOE fan boy, because the class was well off. Today, I'm amazingly frustrated and if nothing else my in-game attendance is a testament to that.
<br />

<br />
If the developers really have trouble coming up with ideas, Keiz's post here: <a target="_new" href="http://eqdiva.com/Forums/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=63706">http://eqdiva.com/Forums/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=63706</a> is a good place to start. h*ll even personally I can think of a few - a resist chorus type song (as weak as the AE songs) for all 5 resist types. A single resist type (FR, CR, PR, MR, DR) AE song that increases your resist in that area as powerful as PoVeeshan would have. A group disease or poison or curse cure song. I'd never want my class to be overpowered, but certainly don't want them underpowered like they are and like they are going to be either. 
<br />

<br />
So to you, member of this Bard community, what can we do? I'm getting to be as frustrated as most of the other higher end bards and ready to switch over to a cleric or maybe another game -- and that’s saying a lot since I've played Kelraz for the past few years exclusively in one of my server's top raiding guilds.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Nicely written Kel!  I can't agree with everything your saying but you're obviously a skill bard.  Problem with this type of information is that you'll get a lot of replies but Sony will never hear you from here.  
<br />

<br />
Question; have you posted this on the eqlive forums?  Not that it will make a major impact but it will cause others to chime in to help with our concerns.
<br />

<br />
My personal belief is that Bards, no matter how badly nerfed, will always have abilities that others could only wish for.  We will always find a way to be an integral bard of any group or raid.  I for example am only one or 4 bards in my guild and am always required in raids.  For groups... I rarely wait more that 15 minutes to find one.  So... no matter how much they do or undo with bards I'll continue to play him unless something much much better comes along.
<br />

Again, nice job and contribution to the forums.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>I agree.  This is an excellent post, and should be read by the developers if we can manage it.  
<br />

<br />
One of the things that does make bards so threatening to developers is the fact that we can do SO MANY things.  No other class even comes close to our diversity, IMO, with the possible exception of Beastlords (Tank, Slower, DPS?).  Therefore, we will ALWAYS find ways around the carefully planned roles that SOE will set for us.  They have learned this, and, I daresay, fear us.  Result?  The nerfbat.  Easier to give us nothing then add things later if it's just too harsh, right?
<br />

<br />
This attitude is frustrating, but can also force us to be better, and more inventive players.
<br />

<br />
A few things in our favor over our rivals, the monks, with this expansion:
<br />

<br />
1.  We can selos in most of the new zones.  Also, we get upgrades to calm/mez/snare (though I've lost rolls on all runes that would give me these thus far, and can't truly attest to their utility).
<br />

<br />
2.  Psalm of veeshan, and Dark Echo hold up as extremely useful in Riftseekers.  If a charm lands on the tank, that's it = wipe.  If a bard is in the group, they can be sure that will never happen.
<br />

<br />
The other thing I REALLY like about this expansion, is the newfound availability of GOOD items for single groups.  I'm an officer in a raiding guild, so don't have as much need of out-of-raid upgrades as many do, but respect sony for adding this option for people who don't have the schedule for regular raid attendance.  A friend of mine has been able to get his bard breaking 9k HP buffed with gear earned EXCLUSIVELY outside of raids (Temple of Veeshan quests and LDON gear included on this, but much of it from GoD/OOW).
<br />

<br />
So, let us not lose sight of the good in general that has come with this expansion, nor to forget that our new medley of songs is insipid.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Nice post. I agree with much of what you have written. Several things bother me about this. First, it was so clear to anyone who plays a bard that our new AA and songs were very weak. Many comments were posted here and elsewhere about this but they were ignored. Second, there are always the &quot;Im such a wonderful bard I always get a group&quot; types who apparently never play alts. If they did it would become very clear that even though the mobs run faster they are well spaced out so that almost any class can pull. Given the relative power nerf we have suffered from deteriorating songs and AA groups will figure out that bards just are not a first choice toon. As the other classes fill their spellbooks with their new spiffy spells this will become more evident. Heck, we really cant even solo anything useful anymore either.
<br />
        I can only conjecture as to why this is happening. The game is slowly fading and bards are hard to code for so why bother? Is this one big makeup call from the days when we were so useful? No feedback on this stuff doesnt help either. Put all this together with a new epic which will require raids for almost every step if you are not in a Time guild or above and things dont add up too well fo rus.

the only thing that SoE/Sony listens to in reality is money.  money talks very loud in their ears.  you take the money away, they listen.
<br />

<br />
that is how the warriors got their attention.  they were going to refuse to do anything but sit in pok, this would of cause massive server crash to the point that SoE would start losing MONEY.
<br />

<br />
that is the only reason warriors/melee started getting their disc. skills in the first place.
<br />

<br />
it will take something that large, and that well organized to get SoE/Sony's attention.  until SoE/Sony feels it in their back pocket, sadly nothing will come of it.  the last 2 expansions are proof positive of that statement.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>I agree that some kind of “action” on the part of Bards is necessary to prevent future nerfing and repair the damage OoW has caused the class.  The problem is…most of us don’t seem to care!  I’ve talked to several high level bards about the situation; they emote: shrug me.  I know I’m a new to Everquest (I started on Platinum) but the effects of this class wide nerf should be noticeable at any level.  Still, maybe I’m also in a unique position to see the end of Bard’s coming.
<br />

<br />
Think back to the old days, when you didn’t have that ubber powerful Berserker or Wizard to grab your items for you in a pinch.  When you were just starting out in the game, and Bard was your first choice.  What if no one wanted to group with you, knowing you were a nonclass, a weakling until you got the spells needed to sit in the back with the other castors (which is where we’ll be shortly if this trend continues).   
<br />

<br />
Bard’s aren’t going forward.  They aren’t even standing still.  We’re being reduced in quality and effectiveness, from the ground up!  If this trend continues, all of us (higher levels especially) will feel the pinch.
<br />

<br />
Would YOU want to join a class, knowing its abilities were being systematically stripped?  I don’t think so.  And if no new players take up the class, it will be discontinued.  Think about that for a minute.  to quote:
<br />

<br />
&quot;the only thing that SoE/Sony listens to in reality is money. money talks very loud in their ears. you take the money away, they listen.&quot;
<br />

<br />
If they're losing money keeping a class open that no one plays, what will happen to those level 65 bards in the future?  Where will the class be when EQ 2 comes out?  In the trashcan, thats where.
<br />

<br />
This isn't just about a few spells or Hitpoints.  This could be a prelude to the end, unless those people who care about the class do something to save it.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Good, points.  However, I can tell you its not only bards that feel like they've gone nowhere in omens.  It seems like many classes have gone to 70, only to find themselves less powerful relative to the things they are currently fighting than they were before.  As a retired high level enchanter, I believe bards are better off at 65 than enchanters are at 70.  Enchanter survivability has gone up a bit with their new AA's, but charm is no longer worth it, and all of their other abilities are second-rate (and worse), besides their buffs, and its not fun to be primarily wanted for your buffs.  Bards still have tons to offer to a group.  I've admired (and been a little jealous) of bards for a long time, and its exciting to finally be playing one.</span></td>

To put it simply, they dumbed it down, massively.  The only things that became more effective were direct methods of doing damage to an NPC, healing a PC, and buffing a PC.  Note I said direct methods.  Methods such as pets, charms, preventing damage rather then healing, etc etc were all fairly underbuffed for the expansion.  Being the two classes that relied on these things most dramatically, enchanters and Bards got pretty much left out of the increase in power that supposedly comes hand in hand with an expansion.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>In reply to the idea that bards need to do something like the warriors threatened &quot;sit in PoK&quot; there are a few problems... yes bards could do it 100% more effectively, we can crash zones because we have aoe songs, however it would get us banned, not fixed.  Many warriors were bumped offline when they tried that, some with temporary bans.  Secondly we as a class can not agree on what we want, we are too complex.  Warriors take hits and get agro... easy for them to agree they need to do those 2 things better.  Bards do 101 different things every day, there is no way for us to ALL agree on what we want sony to &quot;fix&quot;.  We usually just fix things ourselves by adjusting our play style.  I wish for many things, I got 2 of them in OoW, a new charm, and a truely new song (even if it is not perfect).  I do wish for many more things for bards, but I know no one gets everything they wish for.  Heck, clerics got nifty stuff in OoW, but they are not all happy with it.  CHeal is still just as limited and slow casting as before, and they didn't get a cool looking weapon (epic 1 is a bag item for many clerics, if they bothered to get it) just to name 2 simple complaints.  
<br />

<br />
As someone said, I think that even though we ALL got upgrades, and more levels, the game got harder anyhow.  Why?  Because if it got easier we would all get bored and quit.  Whats the point if every person can get Time flagged and so forth a week after reaching level 70?  Its cool at first, but SOE would loose EQ a few months later.  The content has to outpace the players, it keeps it challenging =)
<br />

<br />
(and as far as pulling in OoW, I am glad to get a break sometimes, lol.  but I still get most of the named cause I have track and a long range instant pull method)</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Harder content is not the same as changing a class.
<br />
All other classes STILL have their 1.0 epics that are &quot;useless&quot; as opposed to bagged, cleric gets epic 1.5 just like the rest of us, so I see no point in that comment, and I never realized epics had to be weapons, it was a trend with epic 1.0 but why? because of people saying &quot;I want a cool weapon&quot;?  I'd much rather have something that fit the class as opposed to recieving a nifty weapon.  Considering cleric 1.0 still has its uses as opposed to quite a few other epic which have none or their use is now obsolete by newer spells/items I'd say its a good epic considering the expansion it came out with.  
<br />

<br />
I do agree that yes we change our play styles to fit the &quot;nerfs/fixs&quot; however, there still are core components that can be changed to benefit all bards. Fizzle anyone?
<br />

<br />
Look at your songs lvl 60 and below, you'll notice yes you get upgrades, but for the most part many songs are quite diverse, allowing a hand full of bards to have several song line-ups for each groups, now it is not the case really, now its &quot;play mana, PoV, focus&quot; as your <i>3 end all songs</i> (typically).  I'm sure 90% of the bards with those songs will play them in groups.
<br />

<br />
As for the new songs, both of which have pretty large drawbacks.  For instance, the charm being given 200 mana cost (yes not enormous for those with ft 15), but 40 range also.  They want it to be used for CC I guess (the lvl it can be used on is VERY nice) however it costs mana?  Why? to keep us from using it for swarming? then why not just make it cost 250 mana and give it old charm range.  ( I'm just throughing that out there I don't particularly care I'll adapt to it just fine).  The other song to mitigate melee/magical incoming damage?  Which as I think stated once before has a recast long than 18 seconds (I could be completly wrong).  Not to mention the fact that our other songs? why so many focus songs?  Not as if they are that much better than eachother (my opinion only).  Ill just stick with riz, till I get the lvl 70 is it?
<br />

<br />
As far as pulling yah, sure our new lull is fine, you can use it to keep froming getting adds... why is the agro range remaining the same?  People say &quot;so we can't lull our way through content&quot;.  Yah thats cute cause last I remember spells could be partially effective... thanks SoE for cutting another corner, coulda just made some monster immune to the agro reduction (don't know the exact term for that but where with our old lull you could lull walk up to it slap its face and it would still stand there.  Now you lull with the new one, break a twig 2 miles away and it still comes for you).
<br />

<br />
I think I agree alot with the original poster in the general idea of what is happening to bards, my theory? Dev's are lazy. don't want to fix things the right way but rather cut a corner.  Could also be SoE management saying &quot;you have x time do it if you want your paycheck&quot; so the dev's are forced to do things the easier ways because of work load, I can't say for sure.
<br />

<br />
As it stands for now, from what my friend &quot;speculated about EQ 2&quot; and bards saying how different they would be from eq1, and how there were literally 2 different types (I have absolutly NO clue if this is true or false so don't quote me).  However, it seems like they are changing what a bard is in EQ1, and I was wanting to stay with EQ1 because of how bard WAS, but as its headed I'm greatly wondering why they would make an EQ2 if they are just gonna change / nerf / fix classes so far in EQ1 it changes the aspects of the game.  (All of that is just speculation)
<br />

<br />
I didn't play bard in FFXI because I thought they were not only the complete form of &quot;mana b!tchs&quot; (yes not all mana but full group support I know but its the same for this example), but that I really thought EQ had done a beautiful job of creating a bard class, no other game has done even close to as good as EQ in my opinion, but now it seems EQ wants to simulate other games rather than be unique.
<br />

<br />
Still bards I know are experiencing FM bug, why hasn't it been completly fixed yet?</span></td>

I am totally feeling neglected as well with this expansion.  It seems like the bard was the very last thing to be looked at and our songs were just copy/paste and increase a couple of caps and our epic, lets not go there....  I think the coolest thing we got is our masters of disguise AA which is pretty sad if you look at it from a raiding bards perspective.  
<br />

<br />
Where's our upgrade to resist songs?  The idea of an AE all resist song to emulate PoV for a whole raid has been brought up many times and would be an awsome idea.  Where's our upgrade to cure songs?  Our songs from LoY are totally useless in the last 2 expansions.  Most of the songs we did get are not really upgrades at all, not compared to other classes upgrades.  Why the h*ll was the pull factor re-introduced on one of our new mez songs?   Where's our upgrade to magic debuff/dot?

Interesting thing there tho about the server population.  Two kinds of folks play there, one is the true newbie, the other is a guy switchin servers so he can experience the thrill of starting all over, nothing to twink with, sorta thing.

Most common classes are the solo guys, beastlord, mage, necro, wizard, druid.  Lots of damage classes as well, a smattering of clerics.  But i guess what really kinda shocks me, is there are NO bards.  None!  The word has gotten out about bards, I think.  You can still find bards on the old servers, cause folks are reluctant to give up a toon they spent so much time on.  But on the new servers, I would be very suprised to find a quarter of the bards there are on old severs, prolly more like 10 percent of the numbers on any other old server.</span></td>

As far as bards go, I'm the only one I know of that started from scratch... every other bard I've met since about level 20 has been playing for years, if not as a bard.  I think the # of bards is about right, since there's usually a couple of us to be found LFG at peak times, unlike clerics.

Okay, anybody who's read my posts on this and other boards will know I'm very optomistic.  I generally disagree with bard negativity and I supported the PBAE nerf.  OoW, however, has handed us too much crap for me to see the silver lining.
<br />

<br />
They gave us new DoTs and DD instead of making the old ones scale up.  That's par for the course.
<br />

<br />
But...
<br />

<br />
The lull is a downgrade.  The mez at 67 has half the range and moves the mob, something NONE of us wanted.  The 68 DD focus is such a PoS I won't even hand in a rune for it.  The VoV is of very limited use thanks to the recast time. 
<br />

<br />
In addition the lvl 70 title Performer is stupid and our epic 1.5 quest is INSANE.  The second fight in DN is a 2.0 fight, not a 1.5 fight.
<br />

<br />
I can't find a silver lining this time.  
<br />

<br />

<br />
This is actually a misleading oversimplification.  Yes, I dislike the fact that they have changed the way the new lull works.   You cannot use it to pacify a mob and move past it even for the purposes of scouting and targeting for the next lull and that does limit the functionality of it.  At the same time, it lets you split level 66+ mobs which the previous lull simply cannot do under any circumstances.  It is a serious pain to have to have both lulls - one for sneaking around pre-66 content and the other for splitting 66+ content, but they do different things.  To call it a downgrade is not really accurate.</span></td>

<br />

<br />
I am sorry but I disagree with this one. I am happy the mez actually push. I do agree on the range though. Honestly, think about it once you got 67 and 70 mez, you got 1 mez that work like Morell (ok it probably dont make stuff dance <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-9.gif" border="0" alt="Crying" hspace="2" /> but oh well..) and another one that have some &quot;feature&quot; on it. There is times you want to move the mob without breaking the Mez.
<br />

<br />
About the Lull, I have to agree its a downgrade. My point would be however that it doesnt reduce the aggro/frenzy radius of 65 and under mobs. Imho they should add this so we dont have to switch over SSoQ all the time.
<br />

<br />
Finally, I agree completly with Kelraz. Since GoD our use in raids as been tuned down. I would  to point you out for those that dont remember this thread [link]http://www.eqdiva.com/Forums/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=52281[/link] (whats the code to make this a link ?). What I would like you to notice is mostly Harmonae point of view. The problem that we are crying and seeing now is something that we saw that was coming. 
<br />

<br />
Its a pure fact that no one can deny that our song in OoW are pretty much worthless. In GoD we saw our utilities in raid goes down. We are less and less wanted / needed in raids. Before, you couldnt really think raiding without bards. Now you can do it without them easily. We reached a point where if you have more than 3 bards in a raid, the 4th is much more weakning the raid than anything else. I would have hoped for OoW (since we all see it coming with GoD) that they will add us some more song and utility that would make us not necessarly stronger, but make us keep up our usefulness.
<br />

<br />
Unfortunatly, as much I like the new OoW Zone, I am very disapointed toward what they do to bards. OoW nerfed us by the side. They nerfed us by not giving us any song upgrade. They nerfed us by not giving us any bard abilities that are related to what we do. They nerfed us by making content that swept away our utilities. Forget AE mana in raids, no one cares. Forget AE ressit in raids, everyone maxed without. It just save them buff slot, but you can buy some. our damage output, Even with focus song and being with a bunch of Dot/DD (non-wizard, they got a familiar) our overall dps is far less than most other class dps. Sometimes i think that my advante of mezing over chanter is that I can take hits.. but i came to doubt about bard &gt; chanter mitigation.
<br />

<br />
I would have like to see a mana preserv with our Manasong. I would have love to see new AE resist songs that go over Cap and stack. I would have like to see a heal focus component added. I would have liek to see a focus song that increase DoT lenght. I would have like to see a song that increase crit rate. I would have like a focus song that increase combat effect, acuracy, add some cleave ability. I would have love to see a defensive focus song that increase avoidance, mitigation, absorb damage WITHOUT a stupid timer. Its not like we have everything and there is nothing else we could have.  
<br />

<br />
What is the most amazing is, above all, how they manage to almost completly skip any upgrade of our mains utilities. If we could at least get real song, maybe I could reconsider my view of SoE trying to eradicate us.</span></td>

<br />
&quot;As it stands for now, from what my friend &quot;speculated about EQ 2&quot; and bards saying how different they would be from eq1, and how there were literally 2 different types (I have absolutly NO clue if this is true or false so don't quote me).&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sorry, but I have to, since the question begs to BE asked: 2 different types of bards?
<br />

<br />
I hate to sound gloom and doomy again, but, if this is true, and it’s the way I think it is, the writing isn’t on the wall for bards as EQ1 knows it.  It’s already burned in the CDs.
<br />

<br />
Think about it.  There have always been two types of bards.  The melle bard, who stands on the frontline to add tank support in a pinch, and the support bard who adds haste and mana, or whatever support songs are needed for the situation.  Anyone else seeing the connection yet?
<br />

<br />
I’d like to hear some concrete info regarding a 2 standard bard for EQ2.  If anyone knows any testers for beta, holler at them and find out.  If its true, and its what I suspect, then the Devs have found the permanent simple solution to the “all powerful” bards.  They cut them in half.
