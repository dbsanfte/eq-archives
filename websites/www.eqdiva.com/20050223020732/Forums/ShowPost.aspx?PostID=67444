				<td colspan="2"><span>Hello everyone,
<br />

<br />
I've lurked round EQDiva for a long time (I've had my bard since sometime in 2001) but I've never registered or posted before.  I'm only a casual player and have taken some fairly big hiatuses due to work, moving and other interests.  My bard is my main character and is currently level 54 with no AA points as yet.  I have all the expansions except Gates of Discord and Omens of War, and I play on Drinal.
<br />

<br />
I'm now running into some problems.  Whilst I'm able to successfully chant-kite mobs, it's slow and fairly boring going, and I'm also woefully poor.  I have only 7000 plat and I'm still entirely in Lambent armor except for the arms.  I'm trying to get CoV faction to do the Skyshrine armor quests but it's such slow going without Kael raids and even once I'm an ally I'll need a lot of help to do the armor quests themselves.  I can't afford singing steel and I don't think I can solo the mobs that drop it, so I'm pretty well stuck.  I've done all the easier bits of the epic but again, I'm now to a point where I need things like Phinny's spine which I obviously can't get alone.
<br />

<br />
My guild is nice but they don't raid much, and if they do I don't think it's on a regular schedule so I tend not to know in advance if it's happening.  Because I don't always have access to the computer (I have to share with my husband) this makes it hard for me to &quot;book time&quot; to play - I just have to squeeze in time as and when.
<br />

<br />
So basically, I need advice.  I've found several high-level guilds that raid regularly but they're either not accepting new members or only accepting people much more advanced and dedicated than I am.  Do these raids tend to allow the odd non-guildmember to join?  I'm not great I guess but I think I'm pretty reasonable; I can follow directions, I try not to get in the way and I help out wherever I can.  Am I just stuck for advancement/gear upgrades/experience unless I'm willing to spend a lot more time playing than I currently do?  And with EQII due out next month, is it worth it?
<br />

<br />
I'm just not sure, I feel kind of lost.  I hate to give up on a character I do really quite like and in whom I have invested a lot of time (if somewhat sporadically) but I'm not sure quite where to go with her.
<br />

				<td colspan="2"><span>Hey,
<br />

<br />
I don't have time for a full reply atm, but I'll give it a shot.  I am also a long time lurker and I actually registered just to reply to your post.
<br />

<br />
I also took a break but at 55.
<br />

<br />
You are at a perfect level to learn how to swarm kite in PoN.
<br />

<br />
That xp will be good to around 62 and will get you to 65 but not 66.  An added bonus is: they drop diamonds etc. 
<br />

<br />
I'd say once you get to be 65 you can try to get gruops in WoS or mebe RCod. (WAll of slaughter or Ruined cityof Dranik)  Both of those spots are reasonably good xp till 70. 
<br />

<br />
In terms of gear, you're gonna have to  be creative.  LDON was great and if they still have ldon groups around u are a great addition to most groups once you learn to pull.  
<br />

<br />
IF that won't work you can try buying some of the new OoW gear when the prices drop..and drop they will since the drops are very common.  Some of that is quite good.  
<br />

<br />
Another thought is buying some of the ok crafted items or perhaps some old ldon gear (nro breastplate for one..architects breastplate is name i think)
<br />

<br />
Ok gotta go sorry this is so disorganized.  I hope its helpful.
<br />

<br />

				<td colspan="2"><span>I am thinkng you will be much happier starting out freash with eq2.  EQ1 has grown into a game that is not very friendly to those in your situation, and to spend too much effort this late in the game, for a game that is not user RL friendly, might be the wrong thing to do.
<br />

<br />
This game caters to the end game, if you are actually a main and not a twink, then it is a very awkward place to be.  At least a twink can buy their way somewhat, then again with no aa....we are talking about way too much time at this point.
<br />

<br />
EQ2 will level the playing field for you....no twinks,  and the game is a bit more RL friendly.  You can actually play for 2 hours and accomplish something.  Way too often 4 or more hours are required for eq1 and this is its biggest downfall for people such as yourself.
<br />

<br />
Choices are unlimited for some long timers, but very limited for others.  Even if it were a year ago, then maybe the time/fun factor would make staying with this game worth it....for now if it were me at 55 and no platinum or alts...I would be waiting for a new fresh start in the next eq.
<br />

<br />
Have fun, or as much as you can at this point, farming platinum for equipment is not going to be much fun though.  LFG is not much fun.  Swarming is the key to your sucess yes, but being 65 with the gear of a lv 40 twink is gonna make your life misserable.  The higher your lv gets the more you will notice just how tuff it is to be usefull to a group.....unless you do the painstaking job of farming to better your gear.  (skill ups might be low as well)
<br />

<br />
If all the hard core lifers stay with eq1 untill it dies, and all the &quot;casuals&quot; go to eq2 for the new game....well it might just make everyone much happier.
<br />

<br />
Lifers don't want a new start when they have 60% of their last 5 years of RL tied up into a game that is getting lamer by the day.  This is a bad scene for those who gave too much....they will be trapped here..at least you can go and really have fun in eq2:)  Perhaps you are the luckier of the 2.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I would definately do a LOT of LDONs. They are fun (though a bit repetitive), and you can rackup some points for buying armour and such. There is some NICE armour for your level that sell for only 150.  Do some research on LDON merchants on this site and you can figure out your goals. 
<br />

<br />
At the mid 50s you will get maybe 1/3 to 1/2 of a level each trip. I have not been having much dificulty getting ldons still, even after OOW release. 
<br />

<br />
I was very poor up to level 63 or so, so I was in the same boat you are in now. That is why I did LDONs.. no money for decent items.
<br />

<br />
In my mid 50s I swarm kited in Nadox, but that requires run3. I was pulling about 500p per 3 hour period. I know there is a lot of places that do better .. but I like swarming.</span></td>

<br />
Good upgrades for you would be the steel wrapped gear that droped in Ykesha.   The pieces sell for ~2k each (legs arms chest).   Also look at acrylia armor, the ac/hp/sta isnt too shabby for mid 50s' gear.
<br />

<br />
Steer clear of velious quested armor.   The reward is not worth the time investment, given the better alternatives.
<br />

<br />
Get into LDoN groups to build up points and wins.  Save up for the Mirigul and Tak armors.  The xp is still good there in the 50's, though the points are lacking.
<br />

<br />
I was wearing the Architects bejewelled BP until I got my 1492 pt BP from Tak this past weekend.   Yoiu can buy it for 8k max, usually on sale for less.
<br />

<br />

<br />
PoN Nightstalkers are good xp and cash if you can get the camp.
<br />

<br />
I would take time to learn swarm kiting on easier mobs though.   I learned back in iceclad on the giants there.   I then moved to GD elites, they were still blue up to the mid 50s easy, gave faction hits and were generally uncamped.
<br />

<br />
Once you can swarm the giants (loooonnng melee reach on them, uneven terrain on the plateau, and decent hit points) you can easily swarm nightstalkers in PoN, the boats in Dulak, or the trolls in Nadox.  All will get you past 60, and some decnt plat.
<br />

<br />
The adantage to swarm kiting is, aside from a drum, and a good wind instrument, you can kite nakid.
<br />

<br />
I would invest some time into LDoNs to get a wind instrument aug, and an item to put it on.   Not having to swap instruments to cast invis song is a huge bonus.
<br />

<br />
For 236 pts in Mistmoore you can have:
<br />

<br />
Gravestone of Dire Melodies 
<br />
Augmentation (Aug3) LORE NODROP Wind mod:1.6 (Rec lvl: 50)  BRD  
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Armor LORE NODROP (Rec lvl: 18) 
<br />
AC:+4 INT:+4 DR:+6 Slot1:type3  ALL  FINGER  16  Mmc
<br />

<br />
As an added bonus, there is a good chance you can get on one of your missions:
<br />

<br />
Trueborn Drum of Dark Rites  Percussion: 2.4
<br />
WT: 0.3  PRIMARY  Steward Omnivore and Steward Warden in Mistmoore Catacombs, Level 53 Normal Mission

If you work up your smithing (a painful process) you can gear yourself up with the results.   Since you don't have full time acces to the computer, you obv cant set up a trader to sell your creations, you might want to buy GoD so you can hand it in for Tribute, and benefit yourself that way.
<br />

<br />
Getting to the 150s in smithing is not that hard, and easy to farm the materials.   It also will give you a goal to work for at your own pace.   Given your irregular schedule, a personal goal may be better than aspiring to a guilds goal(s).</span></td>

Personally my suggestion to you is somewhat along the lines of what I did.  Farm items you know you can.  Try farming Iksar hide mask I think you should be able to do it at your level may have to mez/heal for some of it.  (think the mob summons can't remember *shrug*).  The mask on drinal sold for 10k I think last time I played there.  The only problem with farming lore is you can only have 2 (one in shared bank one on your toon).  So if it doesn't sell fast on Drinal it may not be great for making any money.
<br />

<br />
I think OS may be just a tad too rough for you to camp the named etc that drop singing steel especially with your current HP I'm guessing is around 2k-2.5k.
<br />

<br />
The suggestion about Ravenous stalkers was good, however they drop a new loot item so diamond drop rate has dropped a little, so this is less efficient.  The other issue is you will be running out of mana w/o FT 3~ or more.  
<br />

<br />
IF YOU GET GOD -- You can use the FT ability from the taskmaster (forget the correct named) just need to get points, don't spend money.  What I did is went to City of mist one evening cause I was bored, just raped the whole front of the city.  (The main courtyard, the &quot;stables&quot;? to the left and the temple thing to the right of entrance.)  Found some arm items and other stuff took it to taskmaster and was able to earn over 2-4k in points.  That should keep you going for quite some time.
<br />

<br />
I would suggest saving all your money and getting ornate boots right away.  The boot mold should be relatively cheap.  With those you can swarm kite easily and they are decent upgrades.  The other benefit of swarm kiting for longer periods will be more diamonds, so the boots do end up paying for themselves really.
<br />

<br />
Also other than the ornate boots, I suggest getting all droppable so that you dont loose any money.  I personally went with RZ as my diety so that I could use the diety armor good hp armor imo.  Sadly still using the BP at lvl 66 =/</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Normally I always tell people levels are more important than AAs.  However, for your situation I would suggest going 100% AA and getting 20 AAs.  Spend 3 on run 1/2/3 and 3 on regen 1/2/3.  When you hit 55 spend 2 on combat fury 1.  When you hit 63 buy Fade<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-14.gif" border="0" alt="Devil" hspace="2" />and Boastful Bellows (6).  The reason I say work on AAs now at 54 is you have a rare oportunity now that you won't have later on.  EQ gives a bonus to exp for mobs that are close to you in level.  The nightstalkers (werewolves) in PoN are 52 (iirc).  So you'll earn those AA at a decent pace.  Imo, the nightstalkers' exp really slows down once you hit 58.  You may be able to get over 60 there but your exp will really slow down.
<br />

<br />
I recommend those specific AA because they will set you up to be a good puller.
<br />

<br />
I'm in a similar type of guild though we are all mainly over 65.  Usually casual guilds have some people into tradeskills.  You may want to look into getting then to smith you some armor.  With all the drops in OoW all the prices have dropped alot in the bazaar...so do some bazaar hunting.  ONe thing that would really help you is a good drum.  I'd recommend the standard Thunderous Drum of Karanas (TDoK).  The TDoK should be realitively cheap though you may have to spend 4-5K depending on your server.  Since you have such a short time to play you will be soloing alot which means the drum is more important than upgrading your armor.  Don't bother with the Velious armor quests!  As the game has progressed that armor isn't adequate anymore.  That armor was good for it's time but PoP mobs are much tougher and hit alot harder than velious mobs.
<br />

<br />
Even though your time is limited try to group as much as you can.  At your level try for the PoN/PoD/PoI groups.  When you hit 62 try for BoT groups.  Most people expect bards to be the puller/mezzer, so hone your skills.
<br />

<br />
Later on as you get more pp try for the ornate boots as was earlier suggested and also get a Solstice earing (crafted - people sell a kit or you can buy the items in the bazaar).  Both of these items provide mana regen which will help in pulling (fade) and for swarm kiting.
<br />

<br />
Once you hit 64 and get your new charm song you can swarm the hobgoblins across the river in PoN or the Gargs in PoN.

I agree that LDoN would be a good route for equipment upgrades.

Orcish Greaves and Architects Bejeweled are good armor...to be honest I would wear them over SS 99% of the time. Kunark armor with no resists just ain't the cats meow anymore.

Myself, I'm gonna try EQ2...on my server midlevel guilds are struggling for members...the 65+ members are often leaving for high level raiding guilds to &quot;see that part of the game&quot;, the remaining members have a tuff time generating the numbers for the amount/level of raids to generate true gear upgrades.

At level 55, bazaar level upgrades compete very well with level appropriate raid content.

Personally I hate soloing (although I did the nightstalkers for the 6aa for run3/regen3), and have found LDON to be my saving grace.  I love them!  I'm working on affording my armor from NRo, along with doing any camp I want.  I've found that if I start the group, all you need is a healer, tank, and 3 others (DPS = good) and you're golden.  Bards are pulling gods in LDON, let no one tell you otherwise.

				<td colspan="2"><span>When I was at your level I use to Swarm PoN or PoD till i ran out of mana and go pull some LDoNs to &quot;med up&quot;.

<br />
 The Tak BP and all the rest in miragul armor is the way to go imho. If you dont have the Kunark Epic get it, You might need to wait for 56 like I did in order to be able to solo most of it (all but trak). Also, when I was leveling, I did 90% reg / 10% AA all the way. I ended up getting FM at 63 and thats pretty much the only AA you need. Once you got FM you can do Hard ldons easy and there is nice drops to get there.
<br />

<br />
The good side of being a bard is that the only gear you really need is the Kunark Epic, all the rest is just an add-on. You dont need gear to pull, you dont need gear to solo, it just help.
<br />

<br />
As for joining guilds, I owe LDoN to be Time/KT flagged. believe it or not, a lot of people lvl there alt in ldon and if you are a very good puller people start to notice you and talk about you. Thats how I got invited in one of the strongest guild of my server. Plus, you meet a lot of people with different guild tag, sooner or later you start to notice that some guild are better than others.
<br />

<br />
So, Solo while you have mana and get to know guilds and have them heard about you

I will definitely have to learn how to swarm-kite and I might try putting more in AA's.  I have done...about 60 LDoN's I think and I quite enjoy them, when I can find people to do them with me.  One of the things I like best is that with the time limit I can say &quot;I need the computer for 90 minutes - 2 hours&quot; and know that I've done something without having camped the same bloody thing all day for nothing!  I think I'm a reasonable puller most of the time, although occasionally when soothe resists or some jerk is hiding behind a door I get a roomful - I have been able to salvage this through manic mezzing on more than one occasion though!

<br />
I'd get GoD right off so you can hit the tribute master for FT..that will enable you to swarm kite right off.
<br />

<br />
Otherwise, I'd not bother too much with Oow till I was 65.  Just my advice.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I like OoW's Dranic Scar 49-55..
<br />

<br />
For what its worth...and this isn't solo, mind you but boxing 4 50 to 52 toons (total group--self buffed, no c, no v), I make very good exp and about 500-1k per hour per toon in Dranik Scar. (not including as many as 3 named drops in a 3 hour period).
<br />

<br />
I would put a level 52 group's exp and loot up against POP zones like PoD and PoI. I think it compares very favorably (of course I have been there and done those, so I am looking for something a bit different as well).
<br />

<br />
A full group, say in the sw corner, can work non stop and, at least for me, exceed LDoN loot/exp as well.
<br />

<br />
The down side? (I am boxing) and it seems at least one toon has to face down or the hill side to avoid lag (the others are fine...go figure). In addition, it can take 10-30 secs to loot each mob because of the old sink beneath the surface bug...targetting dead mobs has proven difficult for me.
<br />

<br />
I haven't tried it solo, but the named mobs sometimes summon and the add range is high, but pulling to middle or sw corner zone wall its very easy to get singles....I suppose you could chant kite and charm fight there as well, I don't think you could easily swarm, but now that I mention it, I might try it with my 52 FV bard some time.

				<td colspan="2"><span>A friend of mine once told me something that saved my EQ life. I was getting stressed with leveling, could not find groups, all my friends were passing me, and I was about to quit. The advice he gave me was &quot;take it slow, at your own pace, and meet your goals, not theirs.&quot; Basicaly what this means, is solo when you have to, and don't try to overdo it. Set a reasonable goal for exp (20% maybe) and maybe even one for AAxp. Once you reach those goals, stop exping for the day. Do a quest, practice a tradeskill, sit and chat with some friends, just watch /ooc's in PoK. Exp grinds are generally no fun, and that is what EQ was intended to be about. On gear, make a GG char like a wizzy or druid, and sit in PoK watching for people offering for a GG or TL. Cash cow there. Hope this helps.</span></td>

<br />

<br />
From all accounts so far, EQ2 blows and doesnt show any hope of being better. EQ2 is basically a worse game than EQ1 that takes double the PC to get half the frame rate. Slow leveling, cookie-cutter classes, gimped combat mechanics, and crappy FPS unless you have an UBER system. It doesnt even look that great IMHO. Not as good as WOW certainly.
<br />

<br />
WOW might be worth it for you, but personally I am in beta and I dont like it. It is a basically a single player MMOG. Grouping is actually discouraged by some game mechanics not to mention the game is way too easy. Items bascically fall off trees. The class interaction (and thus group tactics) are more limited than EQ. Think MMOG diablo.
<br />

<br />
The only MMOG worth playing in the future will be Vanguard. That's 2 years off, so there is PLENTY of time to ding 70 and get your epic 2.0 =)</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>your doing real well if have 7k and lambent tons of gear that is way better then lamb is pretty cheap these days.  If your looking to solo katta isnt bad used to be a post here on how to do it basically ya stand on steps hit a guard with a spell and book out fast to front door. Its good exp and good way to learn to swarm if ya havent.  
<br />

<br />
Take ya to 56-57 pretty fast they drop weaps and decent amount of plat average 10-12 pp a mob x ten+ mobs a pull can sell right there too since nathyns house is seperate faction then rest of zone. Repop is slow but if get em all couple usually repop before ya finish em all off.
<br />

<br />
Swarming is fun when ya first start trying though eventually get just as old as chanting when ya master it though.  Ldons are a good place to go if have enough time to group, most people in em anymore are prolly twinks which is good thing for you though I havent played any of my alts in while last time i was on an alt spent long time looking for a healer. 
<br />

<br />
If ya can only play in small blocks id prolly recomend soloing to 60ish atleast the majority of the fast to form ldon groups are 65 ish tho that may have changed since oow cant say i have done one in 8 months or so hehe.  Still good source tho get a cleric and tank friend or 2 can pretty much fill out a ldon group with whatever else.</span></td>
