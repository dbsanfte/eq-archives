<b>Row Row Row Your Boat - </b>10/19/02 1:21:19 AM<br>~ <b>Melenanai Harmonymaker</b><blockquote>Hello Fellow Bards - <br><br>I have a theory as to why the mana song stacks with itself.  The way I think of it is the same as when you learned to sing  row row row your boat in rounds in your grade school music class.  <br><br>The spell works like this:  A bard casts, it takes 3 seconds to take then it delievers one tick of mana regen.  If the song is uninterrupted, 6 seconds later another tick of mana will be delivered.  Imagine this happening with numerous bards if they sang in rounds, that is, bards starting the songs in regular intervals one after another.  Heres what it would look like:<br><br>Bard I:    Cast 1 2 3 Mana......Mana......Mana......Mana......Mana<br>Bard II:           Cast 1 2 3 Mana......Mana......Mana......Mana......<br><br>Ok, so the model shows the cast initiation, followed by the 3 second cast time, followed by the mana delivery.  the 6 dots represent the 6 second delay between mana delieveries in an uninterrupted song.  Where the 6 second delay by the first bard's song are occurring, the mana delivery from the second bard is kicking in.  <br><br>Now, I  like to consider myself a rather dextrous bard and so i make it a habit of twisting songs.  Generally, I'll sing this one in conjunction with whatever other song my group needs at the moment.  As any twisting bard knows, the uninterrupted model of stacking doesnt work when twisting songs, as the twisting causes songs to end.  SO, a more appropriate model is required:<br><br>Bard I:  Cast 1 2 3 Mana X Cast 1 2 3 Mana X Cast 1 2 3<br>Bard II:         Cast 1 2 3 Mana X Cast 1 2 3 Mana X Cast 1 2 3<br><br>In this model, its the cast initiation, followed by 3 second cast time, followed by mana delievery, followed by the end of the song (represented by the X).  In this case, the second bard's mana is being delivered as the first bard's song is ending.  Of course, the model isnt perfect, but, the idea is that if you and another bard stagger casting times of the song, the two bards will be able to &quot;stack&quot; their songs only by virtue of the fact that at no point are both bards' songs generating mana at the same time.  <br><br>Like I said, this is just a hypothesis of mine.  Agree or not, but its how I explain to myself how the stacking thing works.  Hope this helps someone else out. :)<br><br>Melenani Harmonymaker, Bard of the 22nd Song<br></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
