<br />

<br />
Our guild was honing our guild PVP and we were engaged in 100+ battle in HoH with another guild.  Pure Meyhem!  I had some casters that took me out so I was waiting outside for the resolution of zone ownership.  The busy raid channel communication slowed and a few got off /rsays like &quot;horrible lag&quot;.... then a few seconds later several of the raid members left the raid.  We crashed the zone.... hehehehhe.  Guess we don't know who won that one all though I think they were leading.  I'm sure a GM somewhere was wondering what just happened.
<br />

<br />
I'm sure zone crashes are typically a pain in the backside but this one had me enjoying the game.  Anyway, it's a sick world and I'm a happy man.

TZ's top guild Pandemonium was holding Ssra from the #2-3 guilds discordia and indignation (dubbed disconation) back before #2-3 had made it into VT.  basically 120ish (from what ive heard i wasnt there) of 2-3 zoned into ssra and boom crashed zone.
<br />

<br />
then, more recently, as #2-3 were trying to make it into PoFire, the same sort of thing happened as mass disconation forces zoned into Sol Ro and crashed the zone.

both times disconation accused Pandemonium of purposely crashing the zone through some sort of hack =-x</span></td>

50+ vs. 50+ in plane of water at hydro spot.  about 40 second lag.  you swim to a caster, turn on attack, nothing happens.  you stand there, nothings.  and all in a sudden you see a lot of melee hits at once and a splat caster!

that's more fun than crashing zones.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Over 2 years ago, I was playing a baby Bard (level 26 ish) and my guild wanted to have a Battle of the Best competition.
<br />

<br />
I'm used to being the ONLY bard during most play times, so I had to be matched against other classes. (which is fine by me! <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-11.gif" border="0" alt="Cool" hspace="2" /> )
<br />

<br />
&quot;Next up, 26 Bard VS 31 Monk!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Ruh ro... he's pretty darn red to me.
<br />
The setting...  Lake Rathe Arena
<br />
All of the Pet Class guildies summoned their massive pets and prepared for battle, Tank types sharpened their blades, Necros started to drool over which nasty dot they would use.  Everyone surrounded the square platform in the center.  All pets and masters, lined up, watching, secretly hoping to see a Bard beaten to a pulp quickly.
<br />

<br />
I start off with a quick snare and went head first into battle my swords versus his fists (and smelly feet).  After a few seconds of getting my head bashed around, I decided to try to fear kite him.  (why not?  It works great against other mobs of this level)  I equipped my Horn and prayed... What a sight!  My fear song actually reached EVERYBODY around the platform!  Imagine 30 people (only 4 resisted) all walking to the center of the platform with LD over their heads! (that's what happens when you fear a PC)  I laughed, but only for a moment.... now I had all their pets beating the tar out of me!  I went from 95% life to 40% life in about 2 seconds.  OUCHIE!
<br />

<br />
The guild chat after that was hilarious!
<br />
Apparantly, not very many of them have been feared by a PC before.  &quot;Dude!  WTF was that?&quot;,  &quot;This zone is bugged!!&quot; etc etc.  Finally somebody figured out what happened and calmed them all down.  Everybody mashed their /pet back off buttons and parked the pets far away.  Now this monky and I knew each other and had a bit of a rivalry going.  He kept fighting with me trying to get the kill.  I snared him and ran around the platform with heal song and Lute going.  (Yes... stupid rules said I couldn't leave the platform or be disqualified)  After I got to 80% health, I went back to fear kiting and dot'ing him.  He tried to keep up by using his Mend skill, and even hiding when he could. (Good thing AoE dots don't care if you're hidden... lol)  Anyhow, it ended badly for the dress wearing ninja boy.  He died and had to face the sarcasms of the entire Guild.  There was only one more fight after that before it became a complete Battle Royale!  Everybody killing everybody!  We did this for over 2 hours!!!!  I must have died 20+ times! What a riot... and a GREAT way to promote Guild morale and cohesiveness.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>I was playin my dru alt one time hunting misc blues in LOIO zone a ways back. There was this bard in the zone also hunting cats for the tailoring pelts and he was always running around fast after any cat that popped on his tracking.
<br />
There was this frustrated SK that also was higher lvl than him by 2 levels or so and said that he was taking all the sabretooth spawns and it wasnt fair. He replied with something like 'first one that gets it can have it' and since he had much greater run speed than any SK he outran him all over the place. 
<br />
I was just huntin anything blue so I didnt care one way or the other but the SK was bustin out in /ooc with his lamenting.  Somebody with a red-server mindset suggested that he dual the bard for the spawns. Next thing I know the bard is saying to the bard 'dude, bards rock on PVP, you dont want to do this'.  But the SK was insistant and starting to get obnoxious in /ooc.  Later I found out what happened since I wasn't near the windmill when it happened. 
<br />
The bard had accepted the duel and the SK only got off the HTouch before he died. The bard had charmed the SK and /pet attack on the Professor Akabao before putting on his selos and running for the zoneline.  The lvl 59 mob laid down the law on the SK then was oo/range by the time the professor was after him. I didnt hear much complaining over random spawns after that.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Story A) I was on a low level mage on the RZ server and I was medding by a guard in Greater Fay.  I left my comp for a meer 5 seconds when a sneaky rogue decided to backstab me.  I returned to my pc to see So-and-So has been slain by Guard Glenth or something.  I was laughing so hard because being new to the server, I had no clue the guards attacked people who PVP'ed near them.  Apparently the rogue didn't either.
<br />

<br />
Story B) I'm a decently equiped lvl 70 bard on a blue server (non PvP to those wondering).  I've been Elemental Flagged for over a year but lacking Time flag due to bad luck.  My HP self buffs with clickies is 6200 and I rarely get additional hp buffs because I know they will get despelled.  Also, I've got decent resists by myself but with Veeshans and VotS, I'm well into the high 400's and low 500's now. 
<br />
Onto the story, 
<br />
Round 1) I arrive into the bazaar Arena to see this 65 wizzy medding in the center while several lower level characters recovering behind the gates.  I already determine he's got some skill despite his 5 level difference.  I walk up to him singing Veeshans and the second he sees me he starts casting.  Full resist from the spell he's casted on me.  I proceed to let him cast on me for close to a minute while I'm simply singing Cantina of Life, Veeshans and Lost Comp to drain his mana big time.   He finaly catches on and decides to despell me (ohh big loss) so I return the favor inbetween twists.  I then lay in on him with my melee + Dance of Blades AA and take his hp down to 40% faster than I think I've ever done landing just about every hit and decent proc rate. 
<br />
Well, he fled to med up and came back
<br />
Round 2.  I again could read what he was going to do and sure enough.. Despell (again, what was the point when he just did it the previous round), Nuke, Nuke, Nuke, Nuke (my hp at 60%)... wait for it.. listen to different sound of cast, I bellows/mezed him out of Mana burn which PISSED him the h*ll off.  He flees 
<br />
Round 3. He returns with a 67 Bard from same guild of his to try again.  Well, I have a 145 point damage shield with clickies, illusions and songs so I took the bard friend down FAST without me even attacking him, focusing on draining the wizzy.
<br />
They both flee,
<br />
Round 4 was more interesting, Wizzy with bard friend AND a lvl 70 warrior all from his guild.  The Bard was on despells to remove veeshans, Wizzy had to cast in the corner, Warrior was there to distract me and keep me busy.  Thanks to a Ancient Mez (first I'd used it all night) on the Wizzy to keep from casting, Toetwister procing fast on the Selo'ed Warrior and Veeshans returning to Song window just in time for nukes to land, I was able to hold off all three for a period of 3 minutes while my HP regened. Warrior was at 40%, mostly from my DS, other bard was at 50% and rising from chorus of marr and wizzy was all but mana drained and visably frustrated. They fled for the time being.
<br />
Round 5, The FINALY got me. Wizzy, Bard, Warrior and a Necro now. All 4 baraged me with snares, despells and Dots (yes they despelled their own dots that landed on me) and Wizzy was FINALY able to land Manaburn on me.
<br />

<br />
Yeah I was a bit peeved I lost but when I later thought about it, it took 4 on 1 to finally defeat me.  I was feeling mighty proud of myself for lasting that long and all 4 of them left arena very fast knowing I might be back with help...</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span> I was a young mid twenty something ranger&lt; back way before Luclin/Velious, heading through Qeynos Hills, when I seen a bard there kitng skellies, working on monk heaband/waist quests for cash&lt;sold in the old bazaar zone&lt;commonly called East Commons&gt;[sorry if you do not know about this zone, ask a guildie to show it to you some time.].
<br />

<br />
I jumped on my podium&lt;sp?&gt; and told him that was rude to do since there were people there of appropriate level ooc'ing, and shouting at him to please move along, so they could set up their xp camps.
<br />

<br />
Needless to say the arrogant Diva wanna be, decided that he would duel any takers.
<br />

<br />
After a few moments of contemplation on the topic, I volunteered to do so but only where I chose, so as not to interfere with the xp/playtime of others.
<br />

<br />
We agreed &quot;Surefalll Glade&quot; behind the ranger guild.  I knew I would not  make this fight worth fighting, but I also knew Uncle &quot;Hagger Sureshot&quot; would not let one of his Baby Rangers get beat on.
<br />

<br />
Fight started, Bow shot to bard, snares, dots, starts circling, BOOM!!!!! Uncle Hagger BOW-SHOTS bard in to nothingness in no time!  
<br />

<br />
I recieved tells for about an hour from this wanna be, about how I cheated.  I replied nicely with the fact that he agreed to the Duel site, and I did not force him to try and kite me.</span></td>

Well my story is a pvp story but its about a Ranger winning. Not a bard.

I have several friends that play Bards as mains... 2 of which both play a 70 Bard and talk alot of junk. Mostly saying howd they debuff me, mez me then suck my mana etc... Which i plainly advised that ok ill even let you take all my mana and ill stand there while you do it... 
<br />

<br />
/Duel.. He takes me down to 0 mana and i just stand there. After i hit 0 i asked him if he was ready. He said ok and i proceeded with manaless snare. clicked my manaless root item fast backed up and used my wolf aa for added attack, dropped TS then proceeded to use my avatar procing bow for further attack. Needless to say he lasted about 6 arrows each crit'ing over 1k. 30 secs is about all it took.

Being continuously attacked by trains, harrased in OOC and so on by someone who was trying to keep the whole zone as his personal camp (no idea why, there is enough space there for 100 people).

In the end I accepted his /duel and walked into the lake while mezzing him.

I parked at the bottom and let him drown, Singing Steel gauntlets are the bomb<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif" border="0" alt="Big Smile" hspace="2" />.
<br />
Of course him being a bard, lvl 58 (10 lvls higher then me) I was expecting him to do this but hey, I was not complaining about him being foolish.
<br />

<br />
Whne he came back I was at the windmill and had used faction song on the vendor in the mill...
<br />
He demanded I duel again, I said no, he insisted, called me names in shout and ooc and I accepted...
<br />
He used mezz...and died, oopsie.
<br />

<br />
I did not do anything.
<br />

<br />
Having played on a pvp server before I had made sure I had a small dot on me so his mez would not be a problem either but I could not believe he would engage me next to a mob that has neutral faction.
