<h3>Bard Kiting, How and Why?!</h3>
Kiting... It's boring, painful and makes you 
dizzy. So why do so many Wizards and 
Druids do it? Why?! Cos it is GREAT EXP!
<br><br>
So what do bards need to do while kiting 
apart from run around.
<br><br>
There are essentially 3 ways to kite.
<ol>
<li>Fear/Snare Kiting
<li>Two Chant Kiting
<li>Three Chant Kiting
</ol>
<h4>1. Fear/Snare Kiting</h4>
Essentially you chase the MoB around with a 
combination of Angstlich's Appalling Screech 
and Selo's Consonant Chain. Probably the 
hardest to do as a lot of the time fear breaks 
at the most inappropriate time and with you 
in close quarters this hurts.
<br><br>
<h4>2. Two Chant Kiting</h4>
Once you attain level 38 you can start 
twisting your 2 chants. Fufil's Curtailing 
Chant (30), Tuyen's Chant of Flame (38) & 
everyone favourite Selo's Accelerando (5).
<br><br>
I'd practice on something green that won't 
beat you to death. Pop your percussion 
instrument into your offhand (Drum, 
Tambourine) and then cast your first chant 
on the MoB. We are off! Make sure you 
choose a nice safe area where you can run 
around in circles (Which is off the beaten 
track of a lot of MoB's).
<br><br>
Once you get the message (a %t starts to 
chant, a %t hair stands on end or the resist 
message), start your second chant. Then 
back to selo.
<br><br>
Selo should keep you out of range of the 
mob, but you don't want to get to far away or 
you will go out of range (with no message to 
the effect).
<br><br>
Once you are happy and you have got this 
down to a tee, go find your first blue mob 
and see how things go.
<br><br>
<h4>3. Three Chant Kiting</h4>
Much like two chant kiting, three chant kiting 
will allow you maximise the damage you deal.
<br><br>
This can be done after level 46, again equip 
your percussion and instead of Selo, mem up 
Tuyen's Chant of Frost (46).
<br><br>
Keep selo mem'ed and to hand (I have the 3 
chants in hot slot 1, 2, 3 and then selo in slot 
4). Now find a kindly Shaman, Ranger, Druid 
or if you have them click your JBoot heals 
and start going.
<br><br>
Like I said I've only experienced the latter 2 
in the Dreadlands and Emerald Jungle. In 
the dreadlands at 50th the Ragers and 
Ravishers where giving me 1/2 a blue bubble 
of exp every time. This is great exp 
especially when soloing.
<br><br>
In EJ I spent sometime kiting apes which was 
good exp, but I was grouped with a ranger of 
the same level at the time and I was glad 
because I tried a trakasaurus not realising 
they actually run faster than SoW! She 
snared it for me and I finished it off in 
record time.
<br><br>
<h4>TIP!</h4>
1. Have Crisson's Pixie Strike (28) mem'ed. 
If you get an add while playing these songs 
the mob will catch you up that you are not 
slapping. A quick stun can help you get back 
on track.
