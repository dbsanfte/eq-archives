				<td colspan="2"><span>Ok. I just spent some time reading what other bards are posting to the 'official' threads on the station boards and I just want to scream, rant, and throw things! 
<br />

<br />
I love and adore my bard. Why? Mostly because it is hands down the most versatile class in EQ.
<br />

<br />
So... Why the h*ll are BARDS crying and whining for something that does nothing for gameplay except make bardbots more viable and actual PLAYED bards less versatile to the point that bard-bots are clearly superior? Yes, I'm referring to all the auto-twist suggestions. Want to be a caster or melee? give up your bard. STOP trying to make bards into singing rangers! 
<br />

<br />
Think about it please. Why would ANY raiding guild want an actual PLAYED bard when they can easily have 2-boxed bardbots for AE resists, AE mana, MT songs, etc that won't earn RPP, won't roll against other plate classes (esp. warriors &amp; clerics), and won't try to get the guild to target bard-gear mobs? Unless the guild uses bards extensively for pulling, which has become a secondary role for bards to fill and diminished lately, a bardbot will indeed fulfill all/most of a bard's utility on a raid.
<br />

<br />
Someone please, please explain to me why this is desirable? 
<br />

<br />
Twisting is the single gameplay dynamic that limits a bard. It is the one single response to every shout of &quot;overpowered&quot; that we all hear. It is also one of the true measures of a bard. If a bard comes to you and tells you they've macroed their twist to a single hotkey how do you respond? With incredulity and disdain? Probably, because they have limited their abilities as a bard by creating that hotkey and shown that they have no true idea what a bard is capable of. 
<br />

<br />
So... Again... Why are bards crying to have done to them what we all disdain in bards now?</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Because thats what those people want. They don't care about playing the game, they are after &quot;phat lewts&quot; and will scream and bitch until the devs pave a yellow brick road to &quot;phat lewt&quot; city so they can hook arms and jog on over without so much as a bead of sweat singing joy joy songs. They don't care or want to learn how to play a bard, thats not the point, they just chose bard as a vessel on which to lavish loot. And seeing that the end game isn't getting any easier they whine and bitch about things most serious bards have stopped thinking about.
<br />

<br />
Bugs are important, things that are broken are important, poor fore-sight on the part of devs are important. When things do not work the way the developers intended that is something to moan and bitch about, not things you &quot;wish&quot; would happen. Continuing to bitch about things you &quot;wish&quot; only clutters the things that are genuinely of issue.

Oh, and increase melee dps.  I want to give rogues a run for their money!

Oh, and give us some half - decent nukes, too!  I want to crit for 3k every 3 seconds!

Oh, and give us a better slow.  I'm thinking 65% isn't too much to ask for.

And let clarity and the other mana regen effect us!  We're mana classes now, too!

Hmm, while we're at it, we should get our hps increased.  And our damage mitigation.

Oh, oh, make our lull unresistable like monk's!

Hmm, come to think of it, why can't I use 2H weapons?  I don't think it's unreasonable for a bard to go into a fight swinging a 2 handed sword or whatever.  And archery?  We're jack of all trades, right?
<br />

<br />
Oh, and let us change into frogloks if we want permanently.  Michigan frog, any one?  Actually, just make all races bard usable.  The dwarven armies in other lore had drummers, and the ogres and trolls had crude horns, and the halflings had the occasional bard..

Come on people, we don't need any thing more.  Some nice AE mez's, and most of the stuff outlined in that first comment would absolutely ROCK, but all-in-all we don't need any thing else.  All the time, as long as you play the class right, other classes will talk about envying you.  Is there a reason for this?   Yes.  Bards are more skill based then any other class, which is why they should be allowed to be over powered.  SKILL-BASED.  That means instead of needing to go to time to be an above average bard (unlike tanks, or dps classes, or..) a bard in lvl 10 newbie gear can be superb.
<br />

<br />
How many classes can go and do a hard LDoN NAKED?  Maybe a monk, maybe a... well... actually, no, just bards and monks.  And monks will be severely hampered.  But bards can do it butt naked and the only thing stopping him is skill (would take a lot of carefullness to deal with your suddenly low mana regen and pool) and his dps is usually pretty low anyways so taking it out won't do too much.  I have made pulls naked before from turning down the wrong way and having a corpse hidden away from me by a bunch of see invis mobs before (ok once), and it's doable.
<br />

<br />
What does all that mean?  Stop your whining and learn to play a bard.  Oh, and give us FD and a pet.   <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-5.gif" border="0" alt="Wink" hspace="2" /></span></td>

<br />

<br />
The thing is, and I know lanolar is spreading this out over a lot of threads too, although it seems like every thread turns into this...we do need something more.  I know not everybody raids, but definitely there is a lacking role in the raid game.  I mean, I even see it in elemental planes stage of the game.  
<br />

<br />
I wanna play the fun list-the-overpowered-things game too!
<br />

<br />
Raise charm cap overpowered? In xp groups obviously, but how about a little diversity like a dire charm type song.  DC pets aren't a whole lot of dps and it would help out when such mobs are available.
<br />

<br />
Increase melee dps overpowered?  Hardly.  It'd be a really small advantage overall, because I would still rather see other abilities be more useful than melee, but it definitely wouldn't hurt.  As it is, I really don't even bother to swing on raids because my 75 dps isn't worth the effort of following a mob around in a circle.
<br />

<br />
How about instead of 3 second nukes we get like a 5 second cast time 120dd base nuke?  I mean, it's not like you could be twisting through that, so you're neglecting your group to put out more dps, but again on a raid, dps is all we can really hope to offer.  And at 120 base, the most you can hope for non-crit would be about 500....500dd in 5 seconds is what 100dps?  So we could push maybe 200ish dps which would almost put us on par with a ranger for dps.  Think now, we're sacrificing everything else for raw dps, so it's not really overpowered, it's diversity of the class.  So in theory you could have many bards like how you can have many rangers, and they wouldn't have to step on feet by wasting DoT space on mobs or overwriting each others' dots for dps.
<br />

<br />
Give us a better slow?  Why?  During raids the only slow bards would possibly do is a pre-slow during a pull, and that gets resisted plenty.  During xp groups if you really need 15% more slow then what you probably need instead is a different tank.
<br />

<br />
Who needs more mana regen?  The only time I'm out of mana is fresh from a rez, in which instance it would be nice if mana regen effects worked on me, <b>how about my own songs?</b>  Especially on raids it's kinda hard to get back into the pull action if I can't fade to split...I'm severely handicapped.  I still go out and do it because I don't want someone else to take over my job, I just either have to be a lot more careful or oops big train inc.  Either way my raid is still happy with my pulling because of the pace I set, they don't mind a couple extra mobs in camp.
<br />

<br />
Unresistable lull like a monk's?  That'd be tight.  In fact, how about we get one, and it work independently of our current one and be on a 18 second timer like a monk's?  Would sure make ldon hard a lot easier for a bard and maybe, just maybe, I could get a group there over a monk.  It's retarded to think that monks deserve such a leg up over a bard just because they got shafted for so long.  Put me on an even playing field and I won't whine about it.  Monks needed something and they got it, but bards were shafted indirectly because of it.
<br />

<br />
Ok, now I want to respond to the original post of the thread, about autotwist ruining our class.  There's nothing stopping a raiding guild from using bard bots as it stands.  1 play ae chorus the whole time, 1 play ae resists the whole time.  They don't even have to be part of the raid!  In fact, you could have 2 bard bots out of raid, and then throw in a bot in a dps class or 2 that just plays echo of the trusik!  It's silly to think that just because a class is bot-able a raid would replace its real players of that class with bots.  h*ll, I can box a cleric in rotation but my guild won't let me unless we're that short on clerics.  They would rather have someone fully devoted to the rotation, and I don't blame them.  And likewise, they would rather have a fulltime bard than a stupid bot.
<br />

<br />
The upside to autotwist would be a reduced chance for carpal tunnel syndrome maybe...and how about the ability to talk to my friends while I play instead of having to type in 2.5 second lines or else map my hotkeys to f keys so I can type while I twist.  Probably the only downside to autotwist would be the surge of unskilled bards popping up, but just like any other class, if they aren't very good, they won't get many groups or whatever.
<br />

<br />
I already have a niche carved out for myself.  If 100 unskilled bard bots hit 65 tomorrow, I would still be able to get groups with the people I want to play with.  I am beyond the &quot;crappy bards make me look bad&quot; phase.  People will notice you for your skill, just as they notice a good warrior for his skill in getting and holding aggro etc.
<br />

<br />
I would be in favor of an autotwist, it's a convenience factor.  I can keep 3 songs up with absolutely no effort, however I can't make a macro to do it for me so I have to keep manually twisting over and over till the day's end.  It isn't a measure of my skill at this point, it maybe was when I was level 20 and still learning the class...but definitely not anymore.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Twisting is what makes a bard a bard. It's what defines us as a class on the player end. 
<br />

<br />
I hate seeing people that use macros, or bot-programs in the game. If there were a way to detect it, I personally think every single one of them should have their accounts banned, permently.
<br />

<br />
If you don't want to twist, don't play a bard. If you want the unending abilities a bard has (because of spells that cost NO mana, and can be cast WHILE moving) you have to give something up. In a bards case - long duration spells is what we give up. Meaning, we have to keep casting over and over. If you could push 1 button and &quot;auto-twist&quot; you have now taken away that detriment entirely. If you can have MULTIPLE effects up almost indefinitely from pushing 1 button the &quot;balance&quot; to songs NOT costing mana is completely lost.
<br />

<br />
Bards don't have &quot;spells&quot;, they have SONGS. If you want to use your voice or insturments to fill peoples arms with strength or speed, to heal their wounds, or to confuse a mob, you have to keep singing. When the song goes- the effects. Consider Alt+ 11,22,33,44,55,11,22,33,44,55...... akin to playing your insturments while you weave 5 songs together into a cresendo of inspiring power. It makes perfect sence to me, and NOT twisting them seems nothig more than LAZY in my eyes. 
<br />

<br />
Twisting has been a fact of life for a bard since day one. It part of the class. In fact, its a defining charactistic of the class. Changing it damages the integrity of the class. Consider it the &quot;cost&quot; of being able to do all that you CAN do. </span></td>

The only thing I would start crying for would be an AA-ability that increases song-duration, maybe 1 additional tick for 20 AA-points or something like this, with some requirement you would have to spend a lot AAs before you can active it, lets say jam-fest 3, singing-mastery 3, instrumental-mastery 3...

<br />
Do you really find that twisting is so crippling in your game-play?  What I'm saying is, it's not like I can't twist multiple songs and keep them up indefinitely.  Honestly, I could start when I wake up in the morning, and keep 3 songs in my song box all day until I go to bed.  So why should I have to manually do it <b>just to be reasonably effective?</b>  Listen, if bard songs were meant to be individually powerful, twisting would be considered an exploit.  As it stands, the bard class is centered on the notion of having multiple effects happening at the same time, hence why the songs have small effects and they are all different so as to work together.
<br />

<br />
Gonna talk about that part I highlighted a second.  Think about the work you do during your playtime.  You are pushing 1-2 keys (depending on whether you macro or not) every 3 seconds, regardless of how effective the songs actually are, and independent of all other factors (except mez and pulling).  Now let's look at a cleric.  Depending on how hard the mobs hit, and how good of a tank they are backing up, a cleric might not have to cast a single spell during a whole fight.  Which means that they are free to heal at their leisure, because they are not dependent on timing.  And a CH cast is 10 seconds long, 1 key press.  During the same time, a bard would be hitting 3-6 keys, and the effectiveness of his songs would be greatly overshadowed by comparison.  My 80hp per tick regen will not keep a tank alive, but an 8k complete heal will.
<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">Consider it the &quot;cost&quot; of being able to do all that you CAN do. </span></blockquote>
<br />
Let's see what I *can* do, shall we?
<br />
The other day I did an ikkinz trial, singular might.  Just killed the Pixtt Annihilator.  The parse numbers were something like: Me - 75dps, Ranger - 200dps, Warrior - 165dps(!!), Enchanter - 110dps, and the cleric and druid were chain healing so no dps from them.  All I did during the fight was &quot;all I can do&quot;, I played chorus of marr, echo of the trusik, war march of the mastruq, and psalm of veeshan.  Even if you take all the indirect dps added by me from echo of the trusik, and factor in the 85pt damage shield, still I would come up at about 190dps.  Why would they pick me over a rogue in this situation?  Rogue is more dps, and honestly better utility in these trials...the only thing I added was the security of having the bard songs in the window.  And even the mana regen is negligible.  The fight lasted 2 minutes, which means the cleric cast HL about 18 times, and during those 2 minutes he would have recovered roughly 500 mana from chorus of marr, which isn't even enough to cast holy light 1 time.  So again, twisting is making me have to bust my nuts off just to get by, or earn my keep if you will, whereas a rogue could have been cruising through the fight just hitting backstab or probably using a macro to do that for him.
<br />

<br />
Now let's discuss the effect that manual twisting has on the average bard.  How many people make bards because they want to be the &quot;life of the party&quot; class?  Come on, raise your hands, you know you did.  Unless I map my hotkeys to f-keys or numpad keys, or if I use alt+# to twist, I can't type a complete sentence the whole time I'm in a group.  Again using a cleric as an example...they could have a whole conversation during a fight, and be able to think out clearly what they're doing without feeling retarded like I do when I type in 2 second bursts.  So I'm left to lose people from my friend's list and also be unable to communicate clearly during a group unless I stop everything I'm doing.  This is a handicap I shouldn't have to have.
<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">Twisting has been a fact of life for a bard since day one. It part of the class. In fact, its a defining charactistic of the class. Changing it damages the integrity of the class.</span></blockquote>
<br />
I guess I just have to ask a question at the end of all this.  What is it about manual twisting that defines a bard?  I had the hang of twisting 3-4 songs at a time before I hit level 10.  I could pretty much twist in my sleep at this point, what's wrong with wanting a functional program client-side or even server-side to do it for me?  As long as it worked like 1 song at a time like how I normally play, just kept them going in rotation so I don't have to mess with it.
<br />

<br />
Lazy nothing.  Make the game enjoyable for me so I can look up from my goddamn spell casting bar once in awhile, please.  I don't even know what half the mobs we raid look like because I have my head buried in text making sure everything is going as planned.
<br />

<br />
These posts are getting really long and I apologize, but this is a major issue in my opinion.  Twisting is a hindrance to the fun level I have when I play the game.</span></td>

<br />
This logic confuses me.  That's like the same as saying a healer should have to upkeep their heal in order for it not to fade, or to upkeep their enchantment.  When a cleric calls the strength of the gods upon his warrior companion, wouldn't he have to enter a meditative state to keep the blessing upon him?  Leave roleplaying at the door please, this game is far beyond where it started out, and honest to god roleplaying just isn't a factor anymore.

<br />
You make it sound as if my songs are of epic proportions.  Please.  If you are roleplaying, sure.  If you're playing the game, no.  The twist I mentioned in my above post is pretty much the only songs worth playing at level 65.  And the effect of them is very marginal, other than probably the echo of trusik, or chorus of marr over extended periods of time.  But yet if I don't keep at least 3 of the 4 up (I always drop psalm unless there's something to resist), I get labelled a bad player, just because I don't feel like mashing 3 keys over and over again till the day's end.
<br />

<br />
Come on!  My boots have a percussion mod, what, like I stomp out a rhythm?  Ok, I'll give you that, now wrap your head around this: My arms have a stringed mod.  Yeah, because I have guitars for armplates obviously.  It doesn't make any sense, it's just a game.  And playing the game shouldn't require me to work 3x as hard as another player just to get my little job done.
<br />

<br />
The only argument against an auto-twist is just the fear of change.  Think of it like this.  I have to work my butt off to keep 3 songs up (well not work my butt off but at least pay attention and watch my timing), what if warriors had to work their butts off to keep swinging at a mob?  Warriors don't even have to participate in a fight beyond hitting autoattack.  On a permarooted mob, a warrior could turn on autoattack and go fix himself something to eat.  Why can't I do the same?  Would you claim warriors are overpowered in that respect because their job is being done for them by the client?  How is it different for bards and twisting?</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Oh my god, I laughed through at least half of your posts. <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-13.gif" border="0" alt="LOL" hspace="2" /> Right on!  It's like they say... work smarter, not harder.  The only difference I see is that the extremely lazy bards who just stand there playing one song throughout an entire adventure or something will now be playing three.  The skilled bards will do what they do, but they'll have the luxury of being able to chill out and take a breather while just doing their melee thing.  Twisting doesn't define us.  Maybe some people who have no comprehension of what a bard is capable of think that, but I don't.  Allow us to be social, allow us to relax like almost every other class in the game.  If you're afraid of change, go play a game that never changes.  Diablo is a good choice, in that respect.  Slash monsters, get PK'd, slash more monsters, and so on and so forth.  To finish up, a GAME should not involve WORK.  It's supposed to be fun and relaxing.  I don't know about anyone else, but I really don't think the game should be taken so seriously.  Sit back, enjoy, and don't get anal about stupid details and fight to keep a system that promotes tediousness and carpal-tunnel.  With that said, what's wrong with a little laziness now and then?</span></td>

<br />
WIth auto twisting 3 songs, the bad bards that only play 1 or 2, now have 3, and look semi skilled. Now even an unskilled bard can get groups, and those that do have skill are just another bard.
<br />

<br />
Then on the other hand, I wouldnt mind being able to talk and not look like a moron

				<td colspan="2"><span>You can still tell the difference between a good bard and a dink bard any day of the week.  Twisting doesn't show anything more than you're not a piece of total crap as it is now.  There's still our pulling, or our CC, or any number of other things that bards can do.  Even if some do have complaints about pulling not being up to par in some places, get over it.  I'd like to see a monk keep 5 mobs mezzed.  Moving on... on the flip side, if you're not pulling and you have absolutely no need to be CC, you're not going to shine all that much.  Tell me how this is any different than what you do on a raid or in a group if you're just sitting and playing songs without an autotwist?  Oh yeah, that's right.  With an autotwist you can at least be sociable.  Whereas before you would sit there, not having much affect on the outcome of things, and it seems like you're in your own little world doing whatever.
<br />

<br />
So there we go.  The only real disadvantage to this is that really stupid people will now be able to twist three songs instead of just 1, if at all?  Well, we have to assume they're pretty stupid, so maybe they won't be able to figure out how to autotwist.  Or at the very least, when one of my alts has to deal with one of these dinks, I'll be getting a little more use out of him.
<br />

As long as we're on the subject of auto-junk, an autofire should be implemented too, for ranged weapons.  My 2cp<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" /></span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>For the guy that said my post was weird because it had nothing to do with the topic, well, it did.
<br />

<br />
The point is that bards are really, really powerful.  Maybe at the end game it doesn't shine as much, but who can get to the end game without a bard in the first place?
<br />

<br />
Everything I stated is something that's been whined for by bards.  The thing I was trying to point out is that these requests are ridiculous.  Maybe one on one the things wouldn't be so over powered, but all together?  Imagine pumping out 1k dps if you get a crit while slowing something for 65% and making infallible single pulls as your new pet runs about smacking stuff up.
<br />

<br />
Would we be over powered?  Yeah.
<br />
Would other classes whine and complain?  Yeah.
<br />
Would said other classes thus get new toys to compensate?  Yeah.
<br />
Would bards be back to where they started?  Yeah.
<br />
Would we whine for something else?  Yeah.
<br />
Would the cycle continue to repeat?  Yeah.
<br />
And it always has been.  Look at the content out there now - mobs that rampage for 5k, and they're yard trash.  If we continue to drive the content level up as we are doing now, the casual or non-uber players will just get ticked off and leave.  That leaves a very small percentage of people - the heavy raiders.  And ya know what?  They can't pay for all that it takes for SoE to keep running.  Jacked up prices (it's already happened!), half-finished expansions (/cough), and more and more publicity stunts.
<br />

<br />
EQ is dying and no one seems to realise it.  It's not going to be quick and right away, its infrastructure is decaying slowly.
<br />

<br />
How soon can we expect trash mobs that ae rampage for 10k?  Not that far off, I imagine.
<br />

<br />
Then, pitted against the average Joes who have tanks with 8k hp on a good day... anything that's not instanced will be unattainable.  More reasons for the people who can't submit enough time to raid.
<br />

<br />
There are many reasons why people can't raid either, none of that 'You're not there because you don't want to be' hogwash.  I, for example, have had my computer stop being able to run EQ.  I now play on some one else's - and they come home and want their computer.  Sporadic and unreliable play times.  How am I supposed to look attractive to a raiding guild?  There are better equipped and equally (if not more so) skilled bards then me who ARE reliable time-wise and WILL do what they want, when they want it.
<br />

<br />
Basically, autotwisting is just another sign of the incoming death of EQ.  I am adamantly against it because any and all bones like this WILL contribute to this, one step at a time.
<br />

<br />
Or, you can ignore all that if you want.  
<br />

<br />
Also, I would be bored if I could autotwist.  Playing alts, I always find myself looking for something else to do.  As my SK, I find myself pulling, tanking, and what-not as I scrounge around hitting every button I can (I wear a shield just so I can spam bash).  I use the lowest level spells I can so that I can cast more.  I keep my pet up at all times (even when pulling a la pet splits or FD splits) just so I can have something else to do (pet attack, pet back off, etc.).
<br />

<br />
I will say this, though.  I doubt I think the same as every body else, and I am attracted to the bard class for reasons unlike every one else.
<br />

<br />
-I made a bard because my first char (a rogue) could never get groups.  It was originally just to solo.
<br />
-I found kiting boring.  I got a group.
<br />
-I loved the group.
<br />
-I continued to group.
<br />
-I stopped kiting.
<br />
-I now fill as many roles as I can as the bard while grouped, for the sole purpose of keeping myself busy.  I need to do something, else I get bored fast.  (I tried a shammy, I tried a wizzy, I tried a necro, I still have a bunch of other class alts and I find them all boring because of how often they're sitting around).

<br />
If you could autotwist? Or if you <b>had</b> to autotwist?  There's a difference here.  If it were implemented, I could almost guarantee it would be optional, because so many people are obviously against it.  How could you be bored by it if you chose not to use the feature?
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">The point is that bards are really, really powerful. Maybe at the end game it doesn't shine as much, but who can get to the end game without a bard in the first place?</span></blockquote>
<br />
Remember when everyone was saying &quot;who could get to elemental planes without vexthall gear?&quot;?  It can and has been done.  Guilds that have an average of 0-2 bards succeed just as much as guilds that have 5.
<br />

<br />
The point is <b>not</b> that bards are really, really powerful.  How powerful am I for being able to twist 3 songs together, which is what any joe shmoe bard should be able to do?  If the answer is less than &quot;really really powerful&quot;, then automating that annoyance would change nothing.  It's not like i'm asking to be able to automatically twist 8 songs at once, just 3, which is what I can do now more or less effortlessly, but I still have to give it my full attention because of timing (both game mechanics and lag issues).
<br />

<br />
What I really want auto-twist for is the ability to experience the game itsself, and to be able to talk to my friends while doing it.  When you group, how often do you look up from your casting bar?  How often do you type out complete thoughts?  How often do you feel even remotely relaxed?  Now take a look at the other people in your group.  If you have an enchanter, and they are not charming something, they're probably typing their hands off, which comes off as annoying to me because of all the stress I have from keeping my twist going.  I should be enjoying their conversation, but I can't, as every time I try to input, it's like:
<br />
Yeah I total32ly3242SHIT *shift-down &amp; enter*
<br />

<br />
If there was a key to twist 3 songs at once, I could map it to an f-key or the numpad, and my conversation would be much more possible.  I could stop in the middle of my sentence, leisurely hit the twist key to keep my songs going, and continue with my thought.
<br />

<br />
I am tired of standing around in plane of knowledge all day instead of grouping, because I would rather relax and chat up a couple of my close friends instead of grind xp that I don't really need anymore, and be stressed out doing it.  If I could auto-twist, I could actually group and enjoy myself all at the same time, and I wouldn't feel so nit-picky about little things that happen during grouping.
<br />

<br />
Seriously, good bards are very grouchy these days, and I would put money on the fact that it's because we have to micromanage our class and so we become overattentive of small things that happen around us.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">I tried a shammy, I tried a wizzy, I tried a necro, I still have a bunch of other class alts and I find them all boring because of how often they're sitting around</span></blockquote>
<br />
Maybe I'm just weird.  I find med breaks to be a relaxing time.  Perhaps it's because I prefer chatting to fighting, but it definitely gives me a chance to collect my thoughts, no pun intended.  And when we sit around before raids while we form up, I use that time to read message boards or catch up with friends.  Or while I'm medding up when I play a twink I can take the med break time to look up items I might want to get for said twink on allakhazam or something.
<br />

<br />
Twisting as a bard keeps me so occupied I can't do anything else attentively.  I hate being in an xp group for more than about 30 minutes because I lose interest, especially since most xp groups stop talking after about 15 minutes, and then it's a mindless grind.
<br />

<br />
I think a real issue is this.  For most classes, as they get better gear and/or become more skilled, they don't have to be quite so active in playing their class.  Take warriors for instance.  A warrior with subpar aggro weapons is gonna be working his butt off to maintain aggro, kicking and taunting endlessly.  A warrior with a BoW can pretty much turn on autoattack and maintain aggro throughout a fight, unless someone is trying purposely to take aggro from him.  
<br />
For me, even when I slum in lower planes (bot, pov, poi, whatever) it's always the same 3 keys over and over again every 3 seconds.  It doesn't matter how easy the mobs are, I will always have to do that, because that's the way my class works.  And I have to do it in a well-timed manner.  A wizard in lower planes with Strike of Solusek can cast once per fight and be as effective as a lower level wizard casting 3-4 times.
<br />
For me?  3 keys at a 3 second interval between each one, from now until forever.
<br />

<br />
It's silly to argue against adding an option to gameplay if it's.....optional?  On the EQLive boards I posted an analogy for auto-twisting being akin to cruise control in a car.  Sure, I can maintain a speed manually if I want to.  But why would I when I can use cruise control and I can sit back and have driving be a relaxing time.  I still am paying attention to steering, so there's still something there that I'm doing, but the annoyance of manually keeping my speed constant is gone.  This is incredibly similar to what auto-twist would do for me, the difference is, I can put a cruise control in my car if I want.  I can't put auto-twist on my bard.</span></td>

As I said, I am different then most and don't expect my views on many subjects to agree.  That's ok, but I am still allowed to state my opinion.

<br />
And yes, I would be bored, because I would use autotwist.  Some times when I am chatting I don't pay enough attention to my twist and hit the same key twice, resulting in 1 dropped song.  A few times it even turns into only 1 song period.  Autotwist really would increase my effectiveness, cheaply, and I suppose I should be supporting it.

				<td colspan="2"><span>The only argument I see as valid against auto-twisting is bot bards. Bards have limited roles to fill in raids, if you can get a bard to auto-twist damage focus and another to auto-twist mana/resists, then get another to auto-twist a MA song set, why have a person behind bards at all? Just make a bard bot, PL to 65, get them the songs you need, then make a /autofollow hotkey. Boom, your very own mana/resist/haste/focus/AC/Cha bard bot, and you know what, I bet an auto-twisting bard bot could keep songs up much more reliably than some stinky human behind a keyboard.
<br />

<br />
Certainly, many of you don't care about the raiding side of EQ. You just want to have fun in one group settings, which is perfectly fine. But when you propose a change that is detrimental to a part of the bard population, you have to be a little empathetic to your fellow bards and say, hang on, this may not be the best idea for everyone.
<br />

<br />
You make an argument saying the older bards don't want change. Well, sometimes it takes the older bards and their experiences to see where the changes that are being made are going to cause problems down the road that the lesser experienced bards do not see right now.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>An excellent point.  The idea does require some tuning in this sense.  It shouldn't be something like you just hit a button and walk away.  It should require attention, but it still shouldn't be so much of a hindrance that it's what we need to focus on 24/7 (unless pulling or CC or something of the like).  It would be great to see a few people come together from opposing viewpoints and think up a system that would work for almost everyone (can't please everybody after all), but I doubt that would make a difference.  I suppose it's all in the hands of SOE now, and we'll just find out how it goes.  I'd rather they fixed more important issues first, but oh well.  Time will tell what's in store for our great class. <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-6.gif" border="0" alt="Sad" hspace="2" /></span></td>

Too funny! On a serious note though, maybe not continual twisting, maybe just clicking a button once would twist the first 3 songs in your line up. Then having to click it again to get the same 3 songs to continue the twist, that would prevent click it and forget it type play. It would still allow people to BoT a bard to some extent but bards are hardly the bot of choice.</span></td>

Just have to setup macros to play the song, /pause ## and then /stopsong and start next one. Back when I was leveling in OS, I played around with it and setup a 4 song twist across two macros. It worked ok, tuning the /pause was the tricky part, if you get it right you can pull off 4 songs easily.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Until you miss a note, and then it becomes a hassle.  That's why I don't use macros.  Even if you catch it and click it or something, you'll most likely have it stopped before the song hits.  So yeah, I suppose an autotwist is great to talk about and looks like a great idea until you get into the actual machanics of it.  Like others have said before, I'd rather see something more important fixed (or fine tuned), like missed notes.</span></td>
