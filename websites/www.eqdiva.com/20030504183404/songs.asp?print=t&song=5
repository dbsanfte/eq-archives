<b>I too have been saved by this song - </b>8/4/02 11:50:22 AM<br>~ <b>Falcolas</b><blockquote>Grouping in CB, we had a very bad pull (Lord Darius, ork emissary, 2 legionairs and all sorts of adds) and this song saved our entire group.  I have never really heard someone shout &quot;Thank you SELOS ACCELERANDO&quot; before.  Plus, I heard some grumbling when a passing Druid thought they were being nice and SOW'd us.  Something about &quot;too slow!&quot;  It did ease my twisting, though.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Over Worked Life Guard - </b>6/25/02 8:04:52 PM<br>~ <b>Katarrl Sowrdsong</b><blockquote>This song is a must at all times. I would have died about 10 times more than I did,(till 31lvl). I owe  tons of exp that I saved to this song. It rocks, Its like Nitro Boost in a race car. With my Drum its my get up and GO GO GO!</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Try it with a Selo's Drum - </b>2/5/02 8:03:13 AM<br>~ <b>Dulwin</b><blockquote>A friend gave me a Selo's drum of the march that he obtained on a raid (and had no use for). At lvl 24 (according to the Bard Song Analysis sheet 3.11) I am crusing at a cool 93%, the only thing faster on foot would be a druid that used Cheetah on themselves (99%-115%). This song rock. Travel is easy and fun! I have to agree with the post by Costello, nothing should run as fast as a bard, we rock!</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Uba speed and saver - </b>1/26/02 12:44:00 PM<br>~ <b>Costello Oceloto</b><blockquote>sup, bard of the 48 song here. i havnt died since lvl 20 if u dont count raids.. i've saved group members and myself with this song, personaly i think that they should not have had those horses in luclin that are faster then bard songs, the speed of a bard should only thing that can run that fast. in KC my group never dies cause i bust out drums of the beast and vrrrooooooooom! It is about 4 times SoW and i love it, bards are the best class by far, they are made to save people in any situation... except when there is bout 40mobs in a dungeon.. when i solo i twist chat of frost chant of flame allyanas fufil chant or whatever and i twist selo's.. awesome soloing if u can twist four.<br><br>-Costello Oceloto <br>Bard of the 48th song</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>I love racing people - </b>11/27/01 7:02:43 PM<br>~ <b>Orme the Tunesmith</b><blockquote><br>I love this song.  Someone cast SoW on me just to be nice.  I had to click it off because a mob caught up with me.  Equipped the drum and bolted.  Wahoo!</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>Reply... - </b>10/27/01 3:21:56 AM<br>~ <b>Poetria</b><blockquote>Someone said earlier...<br><br>---- I'm surprised we don't get requests to join groups just to help them move. -----<br><br>This actually happened to me, once. I was in the East Commonlands, and a Dwarf noticed I had Selo's on. He hired me to locate a freind's corpse, and run him through the Nektulous Forest to Lavastorm. I died on the way back (pesky Dark Elf guards), but I was only level 6 and the experince loss was nothing compared to the 5 plat and cool shield he gave me.<br>It also led me to discover that Selo's Accelerando is very useful in corpse recovery.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Life Saver! - </b>10/1/01 7:43:55 PM<br>~ <b>Sorni</b><blockquote>This is literally a life saver. On many many occasions I have encountered a battle that goes wrong. Even with half a bubble of life, you can put on a drum and begin to run, and juggle Hymn of Restoration with it. Heals you up and with some instrument swapping you can be ready for battle in no time.<br><br>-Sorni<br>Terris Thule</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>People just don't know... - </b>8/20/01 3:02:59 PM<br>~ <b>Siani Sugarlash</b><blockquote>We really need to set these people straight.

<b>Run Away!! - </b>7/21/01 5:35:42 AM<br>~ <b>TS</b><blockquote>I LOVE this song.  My group was tryin to run through a zone to get to the other zone, heh.  Then our levitate/invis spells went out on us, creating a decent sized train  =)  Everyone had SoW on except for the druid, she was in wolfie form.  They were dropping like flies  =(  So it was just me and the wolfie, guess what I did.  I canceled my SoW, turned on my song, and ran like ::cough::.  Then, I saw the wolfie die!  I was the only one who made it, heh.  Gotta love this song.  =)</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>Watch out for Friendly Druids - </b>7/3/01 12:10:42 PM<br>~ <b>Evaengelic D'va</b><blockquote>SoW  Root & Accelo will now no longer overwrite one another.  A side effect I have noticed is that when a friendly Druid or Shaman is passing out SoWs, I must remember to turn OFF the SoW before starting to Travel.<br><br>Watch you spell comments for the &quot;Your Feet Move faster&quot; pulse, else you may in fact be SoWed.  At 35+ I Noticed the Difference in Speed Immediately.  ( I also keep a Spare drum in the bank at ALL times)  and always try and BIND in the BANK -NOT at the closest Zone line, where many Casters would like to bind you!  With an extra 30% speed for having the Drum it makes those CRs that much easier [Resurrection is faster still]<br><br>Evaengelic D'va<br>Teir'Dal Bard of Bertoxxulous<br><Well I am!></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Took a newb for a ride! - </b>6/19/01 3:50:04 AM<br>~ <b>Launa Silverbeard</b><blockquote>I little while ago I ran across a newbie bard who wanted to pump me for information.  After a while, i took him for a ride through Qeynos Hills with my Mistmoore drum equipt.  <br><br>He was so amazed....&quot;WooooooW!!! You're fast!!!  When can I do that?&quot;<br><br>I love to show off :)  Guess that means that it's the Bardic Life for me!<br><br>Launa Silverbeard<br>Bard of the 35th Chant,<br>Lady Bard, Showoff!<br></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>Sow or SloW? - </b>3/17/01 3:50:46 PM<br>~ <b>Jaspen</b><blockquote>Bards, we are by far the quickest of the quick... I hear by Rumor that by  lvl 14 (lvl that druids get SoW) We can easily Outrun them... near lvl 35-40 we can run with or outrun SoC(Spirit of Cheetah) This is a great achievement on our part. The only problem is that most players don't recognize this fact.. and Identify SoC as the fastest spell in the game. They are by far to ignorant to see that we can run circles around every Speed SPELL... Rock On Bards!<br><br>Jaspen<br>8th Song<br>Paels</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Selo's vs SoW - </b>3/15/01 2:59:40 AM<br>~ <b>Zartomb of the Tomb</b><blockquote>Selo's is one of the best songs that bards receive. We get this song before Shamans(lvl8) get SoW. With this song you can make quite a hasty retreat from a spawn that just makes you sick.<br><br>(Tip)This is no given fact. You will have to pick a good time to run. I think once you get down to at least 35% life and it is apparent you are going to get killed, make your retreat cause you dont, you'll just be one of those unfortunate players who die 75ft from the guards (Zone either or).<br><br>Playing this with a regular hand drum increase the song's speed by 5%(ill run a test for confirmation). This is more then enough to dust off just about anything your even.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Always at the top of my list - </b>1/28/01 12:43:52 PM<br>~ <b>Kocho Divah</b><blockquote>This song is always at the top of my list, unless I'm fighting for a prolonged time in a dungeon, where it won't work.<br><br>Definitely get some magical drums. It makes a huge difference in your running speed. Due to the last patch, Selos no longer cancels root, but it still can be a lifesaver for myself and my group. If we find ourselves in a no-win situation, I can sweep around and pick up everyone in the group, and run them to safety.</blockquote></td></tr></table></blockquote><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href="/songs.asp?&song=5">Back to Normal Mode</a><br><br><br><i>Printed from EQDiva.com on 5/4/03 2:34:13 PM.</i><br><br></td></tr></table>
