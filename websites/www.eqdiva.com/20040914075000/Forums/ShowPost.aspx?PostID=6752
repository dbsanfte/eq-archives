				<td colspan="2"><span>I do not thank you for reinforcing what is becoming my view of the majority of people who post in these forums.
<br />

<br />
There is no hunting guide to Castle Mistmore for this level on this site.
<br />

<br />
After doing copious internet research to get my bard to lvl 34, I can tell you it has its purposes, but is severely limited.
<br />

<br />
I have become very jundiced on &quot;guides&quot; as in the past I've found they are the best companion to help you loose half a level of experience whilst you work out what is wrong with the information in the guide.
<br />

<br />
A guide is usually one persons experiences of what happened and usually represents that person at that point in time.
<br />

<br />
SOE keeps tweaking the games and things change, hence some &quot;classic&quot; guides have wrong information.
<br />

<br />
Not everyone who writes a guide is fully truthful. Perhaps this is by ommission rather than commission.
<br />

<br />
Can you not hear the background chorus of moans about power levelling and twinking? Don't forget the buff freaks who only hot buttons seems the be &quot;/ooc can somebody buff me PLEAZE&quot; * 100. It is a big difference doing something with POTG (Protection of the Glades)etc, then it is as an unbuffed character.
<br />

<br />
Given the amount of Lambent Armour I'm actually not seeing around, I'm getting to the opinion that not too many people have actually done the quest.
<br />

<br />
So, I am interested in hearing tactics from people who have actually gone into Castle Mistmore and quested for the Black Silk Gloves. What worked (I understand invis to the graveyard is safe)? How long ago was it? Solo or Mob. Level? Was it as a bard?
<br />
 
<br />
I hope other responses are much more helpful.
<br />

				<td colspan="2"><span>Its been a long time since I did my lambent armor but this is what I remember.  The black silk gloves I believe drop off the Deathly Ushers in the castle entrance.  You can invis up to them but you are going to need a full group at your level to get them.  The main problem with Mistmoore is the horrid number of adds that you get at any level and the incredbly fast respawn time.  Take a full group up and camp the entrance hallway, watch out for wanders and keep killing ushers til you get the drop.  Also, I believe that ushers can spawn in the rooms in the hidden tunnel in the back of the graveyard, they might be a bit safer to camp.  Good luck getting them.  Btw, I think I was level 30 when I did this, but its been over a year so I can't be sure on that.  </span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Thanks {:-(,- a very important point to know about the undead.
<br />

<br />
It seems the rule is that undead can see through invis (with a few exceptions).
<br />

<br />
Do undead die with sunlight (like movie vampires)?, or do they just hide from the sunlight? Thinking undead in Kitchicor here as well, where I've been waiting until game time afternoon to run through high on wall.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I've been into Mistmore once, during the dead period (late Aust evening) and it was night (game time). The first few beings I saw conned green, but I decided to follow the Permafrost advice and clear the way. The adds kept turning up at regular intervals, so I had to zone to survive.
<br />

<br />
On returning at 3 bubs to see if I could loot the one corpse that had dropped (gone), I turned around and started to walk out , I discovered that Eirod Haerod was standing at zone. Apparently undercons (cons green in 30's and fights red in 50's (see Allakazham)). Chilling. It was then I decided that I had better start asking since I had just lost half of level 34 from following other advice on Permafrost.
<br />

<br />
Thanks for the information on experiences.
<br />

<br />
Since my new guild is showing signs of taking requests from members for assistance with quests, I'll put my time in helping others get their quest items and join the queue for a similar group.</span></td>

<br />
You should have the level 27 charm and with that, this is a breeze.  
<br />

<br />
Invis on up and head down to the area where the spawn point is.
<br />

<br />
When you drop down the pit where ssynthi is there is a set of stairs leading up and when you get there, 3 doors with mobs in them.  The mob you are looking for could be in any of those doors.
<br />

<br />
Here's something I found out though.  When you open the door to go into the room with the three doors, the three doors close (knew that), when you close it, they open.  When the three doors are closed, the mobs will not aggro on you if you pull a single mob from behind the closed door.
<br />

<br />
What I did, was to target through the crack in the door and move down the stairs so I could still cast, but just barely.  I then pulled with charm, so if I got any adds, I could just let them eat the pet and worse case invis up and train to zone.
<br />

<br />
If successful, you can pull to the bottom of the pit and kill in perfect safety.  Then invis up and do it again.  The only problem is if you hunt there at night.  The will sappers and such can see through invis and WILL aggro you through the doors.  Pulling those could be tricky if there is a full spawn up.
<br />

<br />
Sometimes you may get an add from the stairway leading up from the three doors, but the respawn time on that spot is much longer than the doors as the mob that drops the adamantine epulets spawns there.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
I would recommend clearing the mobs that don't drop the gloves first before pulling any that do.
<br />

<br />
If things get hairy during melee, you can mes and twist heal song in to get back to full.  1 pulse of mes usually equals 2 pulses of heal.
<br />

<br />
If things get tough, just invis and train to zone, you can make it out if you train up the stairs and jump off the bridge to zone.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Hope that helps a little

<br />

<br />
When I was there, (last summer), there was very few people in the zone, I kind of soloed the entrance or invis to the graveyard and soloed there.   I was hoping to get lucky if anyone would come by to have a go at the ushers... and gwad forbid  the lute for the lambent BP.. when I did group there it was mostly with a couple of paladins  other than that there were very few people in the zone. 
<br />

<br />
I think the guild I was in got sorry for me... after my umpteenth death there, they sent in some 50's my way and gave me a hand clearing out ushers and the piano room, was a fun time for all,  got my lute and the gloves.... I was so glad to get out of MM.
<br />

<br />
to this day I still have all my lambent armor... some still wear the rest is in the bank.. I can't seem to get the inclination to sell it... it was basically my first ever quests that I ever done to completion.
<br />

<br />
Anyways.. best thing to do is get a good group.. you'll need it.. talk your guildies into some fun.. make it into an event.

			</tr><tr>
				<td colspan="2"><span>My thanks to all who responded. After dieing four times, I managed to obtain my Black silk gloves. The loss of experience sux as they say, but I'm happy that I have them.
<br />

<br />
Basically, I made three recon trips and each ended in near death. The first because I tried to fight my way in and the green adds were just too overwhelming. The second because invis broke and it was a mad rush to get out of there, but I just managed to zone. 
<br />

<br />
Well, the third recon wasn't that bad. I invis'd into the graveyard and conned the contents and decided &quot;no way&quot; there is just too much Dark Blue here. It was on my way out that I made a fatal mistake.
<br />

<br />
As said, the zone is virtually empty at most times. Well it doesn't seem to be the sort of zone that anyone visits for fun or profit is it, but one the way to zone I ran into a couple of players and chated. It turned out they were going to go in to the fountain to collect a rib cage for the 50's warrior, then find someone to camp for the other guy. That sounded okay, so I offered to trade off bard songs for a sight seeing tours. Understatement that.
<br />

<br />
Umm, the warrior was typical warrior - kill it. So we cleared a path from zone, around past the graveyard and onto the entrance of the castle. Along the way we cleaned up Sir Bronthas and his pet, which is the 2nd highest in the zone and the warrior was down to 40%. The rest were worse and I insisted on a stop for a heal. I should add that this was all during night time.
<br />

<br />
We enter the castle and go up the stairs. Huh! I'm starting to think why as my paper map indicates that we should have gone between the gargoyles, which I later work out is the quick way to the courtyard and fountains.
<br />

<br />
Standing above the gargoyles, the warrior suddenly decides discretion is called for and says &quot;Quick Invis&quot;. Umm, what!. I'm loaded for fight support, so it squat drop Fulfill's, pop in Sonorous, then fiddle the pack to retrieve and load the Minotaur Horn I have. This comes off quickly because I now have my tailored 10 pocket pack holding all my instruments, 4 weapons and 2 shields  as a hot key. As I rise, a deathly usher enters and goes down and they are off towards the libary. Blow that, the corpse has been looted, but not disappeared. I'm going to have a look (remembering a guild raid where someone didn't do this) and bingo - those gloves (look like leather in picture) are labelled black silk gloves. So I loot them and a neck things.
<br />

<br />
Well, there after, it was a complete tour of the upper layer of the castle. Eventually they descend to the piano room and almost walk back out between the gargoyles, totally ignoring the westward view of the courtyard. Sheezh, Ho!, this way.
<br />

<br />
The excursion around to the fountain is fine, the ribcage is recovered and the talk is to find a place outside to camp for whatever the other guy wants. so we basically retrace the grand tour. I kid you not folks.
<br />

<br />
Disaster strikes in the corridor between the bedroom and the throne room. The door closes, the other guy is still inside, I and the warrior are in the corridor and invis breaks.
<br />

<br />
Holy sh*t, how many gargoyles are there!. I think I saw eight before I realised Oh Oh!. The warrior is whacking away in true style and my big mistake is to decide to load weapons and join in. Bad move.
<br />

<br />
Suddenly it is Wham Bam, No thank you maam (at least six scroll back) and I'm down to 20%. FEAR! Use fear stupid! is all I think as the screen freezes into death.
<br />

<br />
The other guy went down on the otherside of the door and the warrior just runs and makes zone. His recollection of the building must have suddenly flashed into clarity because it wasn't there as we reversed the Grand Tour. As near as I can work out, the other guy died at least once again trying to recover his corpse. How the warrior survived I have no idea because his idea of corpse recovery is to run in whacking, /corpse and whack all the way back. Needless to say, this doesn't work and he has to zone a number of times.
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile I'm finding that I'm bound in Kaladim, so a bank trip for spare flute 1 and spare drum 1 and I'm off the Kelethin (Yes, I did collect mail whilst there to deliver to Kaladim), where I rebind, but forget to deliver the mail, and make two trips to the bank to have enougth to buy a horn to take along.
<br />

<br />
On zoning, I see a corpse belonging to the other guy and no one around. Invis and head off and meet the warrior &quot;clearing a path back in&quot;. We don't need to clear a path, we have invis. Its okay he says then agroes another half dozen, who find him tough and scream &quot;tender bard&quot;. Death two. Okay, get spare flute 2, spare drum 2 and buy spare horn 2 and run back all the time watching tracking for bad mobs in LF. Corpse recovery attempt three is similar, but this time the warrior is learning that we don't need to clear the path and can invis. So we make it around to the top of the ramp and the warrior is agroed by Sir Bronthas, who must be intelligent and learnt from his last encounter or have heard on the grape vine &quot;tender bard&quot;. Somehow I get out fear with 20% left, key Selo's and make it back past the graveyard before I die.
<br />

<br />
AT this point the other two guys decide they are way over their heads and appeal to a fellow guildy lvl 50 orge? shaman to assist. with all those heavies, I give premission for a corpse drag.
<br />

<br />
Silly fool, rather than sit on the zone with invis to undead and invis spells cast on me, I decide firstly to loot the corpses of the last train the warrior brought back to zone. That blows away invis, but all is not lost as when the other guys asks can he loot, I can tell them they will loose invis. Second mistake was to decide to wander in after them. I'm firmly convinved the warriors whackit  appraoch was our undoing before and think I should be safe on my own, although grouped. 
<br />

<br />
The third mistake was to refresh invis right at the grave yard gate. Oh Dear, it immediately breaks before recasting and I can a fan club of about eight. This time, I fear, fear, fear. Well it seems that way. It was sort of fear, selos's stunned, fear fear fear until it starts casting, then move and selos after fear cast. I make zone with 10%.
<br />

<br />
Reentering, I sit down to heal up and the other guy returns with his corpse. Basically, he has slipped the other two, ducked in and collected his corpse whilst the two level 50's were stunning and whacking everything around. 
<br />

<br />
Eventually, the shamie returns followed by the warrior and a train of a dozen lower levels. Close to zone, the warrior, stops, turn and proceeds to methodically whack them all. 
<br />

<br />
Okay, I key Villa's Celerity for he Warrior, take my corpse and collect all my stuff, bar one. The shamie starts rezzing and I rest and watch the warrior finish dismantling his train. The warrior is most apologetic about loosing my that much experience and offers to help me get it back, but I decline. Okay, I died three time and lost almost 60% of a level in exp , but I have the black silk gloves. Yeh!

				<td colspan="2"><span>Err, chuckle, I actually died two times in Lower Guk as well, but I managed to loot both my shin gaunlets and greaves. I actually felt a bit embarrassed about how this came about.
<br />

<br />
After being stuck in Fawdyer due to boat problems with my chr, I made a point of visinting all the song sources soon after SOE fixed that problem (well for me anyway), but this had always been by the northern route. Songs at highpass I suppose. Motivated by the fact that three components for Lambent Armour come from Guk, I decided it was time I bit the bullet and over came the fear of The Ferrot and learned the southern route. It was an interesting trip, like suddenly realising that Cael, sand giant of Oasis is now targetting you as the two people who you had been lazily watch try to take him down have had to zone, woops, sow, zone. Plus learning to travel by mixing sox and Arias because I hate sand dunes, DC and similar places. Eventually I lobbed into Gukta, bound familiarised myself with the places and went of to explore Guk.
<br />

<br />
I was nervous in Guk, even though I was indifferent as someone had said they were suddenly attacked in their. However, I had no such problems and managed to spend quite a bit of time in Upper Guk getting to know the rough layout. Eventually I wandered off to the spider room.
<br />

<br />
Hmm, what spiders? Eventually it became clear that someone was farming them and they became aware of me. An offer of &quot;A Shimmering Orb was accepted and we chatted, whilst he (lvl 52?) accepted an offer of a bard heal. The result was I ended up farming the spiders for him and heal him and in return he would target the Shin Knight for me. This was a good deal as being a solo weak tank in any Guk is a recipe for disaster, plus I wouldn't loose any faction and I was still safe to stroll around Upper Guk. Well, unfortunately, I didn't know Upper Guk that well and when the call came that the shin gauntlets were on the knight, I got lost and finally made it down there 5 secs too late. Bummer, but we carried on for a few hours until we both had to log.
<br />

<br />
The next evening i went off for a change of scenery and completed a round trip to Qeynos just to finish the southern loop, a rebind in Gukta and back to do some spider farming on my own and further explore Guk.
<br />

<br />
During the first day, I had noticed a continualt stream of people passing the spiders, but only staying in Upper Guk for a short time and with this continuing the second day, I decided to investigate Lower Guk and eventually zoned into the dead side near the Pit with heart spiders.
<br />

<br />
It became clear that Lower Guk was busy, with about 15-20 people at most times. I don't know if they were questing or just plat farming, but levels were mid 40's to 60's, so I suspected the later. either way, there was usually half to a full group of people at zone, waiting for selling, new members, healing up, or just farming the 4 live Froglok inside.
<br />

<br />
I started to explore a little was, which was deeptive as someone had just cleaned out all the dead frogloks so I was able to wander up to the waterfall room (tricky section of passage on the way) and back towards the drop down and the water. After a while, I located a dead froglok knight, who conned blue just near the bottom 2 live frogloks and had a go. Oh dear, that was fumbled as I still had travel songs instead of fighting songs loaded. So I back up to the live frogloks think they just might whack the dead Froglok. Umm, they don't. Bummer, run. I think I made zone, healed and came back. Apologies to people at zone who had killed deadfroglok. Np and I get to loot the Froglok. So I go off for another attempt.
<br />

<br />
I remember that I died a couple of times. Thankfully I was bound in Gukta and it has a bank, so I was quickly back in business. Basically I died once because of that slippery wall section, where you can only slide in one direction on the right hadn side. so it doesn't help that three dead Frogloks are pummelling you for half the trip in, then all the way back out, but you don't make it.
<br />

<br />
The seond time, I'll swear those frogloks have walkie talkies or something, because there was definitely only one anywhere that I could see, but a late add tipped the scale. Thereafter, when ever an add occurred, I would just start backing up towards zone, kick in selos at 1.5 bub and then full speed reverse to zone. So I was making a few exp and loosing a couple of major lots. People at zone didn't seem at all fussed. I think most were in boredom from waiting mode, full health, full mana and still waiting for team mates
<br />

<br />
I scored both the shin gauntlets and shin greaves on one of those occassions when the walkie talkie brought three adds just as I was about to can one. Bugger, zone fast. when I came back, just inside zones was littered with froglok corpse whitch no one else had looted and bingo, two corpse and I scored both. So, I figured that was a good time to call it quits.
