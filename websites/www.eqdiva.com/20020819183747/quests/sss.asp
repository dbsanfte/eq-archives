<h3>Bard Epic - Singing Short Sword Quest Walkthrough</h3>
<table width="500" border="0"><tr><td>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
The bard Epic is the Singing Short Sword, a very uber bard weapon with great stats and a triggered proc that gives the effect Dance of the Blade - a full party buff that adds 55% haste, 30 strength, 30 attack and lasts for 2 minutes and 30 seconds and has a range of about 150 feet. The weapon gives the same bonus to instrument songs that a store bought instrument would. It also gives an 80% bonus to some songs that were previously only singing skill. This particle weapon has the stunning visual effect of blue musical notes floating around and trailing the wielder of the weapon. Drooling already? Read on and learn how to get your Epic weapon!<br><br>

The Bard Epic quest starts and ends in the Dreadlands. You talk to a guy named Baldric Slezaf located in the area near the Druid and Wizard portals, inside one of the pyramids in the ancient ruins. His location is 773, 9666. Talk with him and he will tell you about two missing pages from his symphony and an instrument to play it on. If you bring him the items he talks about, he will give you your reward - the Singing Short Sword.
<br><br>
The items that Baldric requests come in four different pieces:
<ol>
<li><b>Page 24 Top</b>
<li><b>Page 24 Bottom</b> 
<li><b>Page 25</b> 
<li><b>Lute made by Forper Fizfla</b> 
</ol>
<br><b>You say,</b> 'hail Baldric Slezaf'
<br><b>Baldric Slezaf says</b> 'Hello Kocho. Don't you think this would be a wonderful place to perform a symphony? 
<br><b>You say,</b> 'What symphony?'
<br><b>Baldric Slezaf says</b> 'It has been my dream for years to perform a symphony that would be remembered for ages to come. I have run into a few minor snags, however. 
<br><b>You say,</b> 'What snags?'
<br><b>Baldric Slezaf says</b> 'Several years ago I bought sheets of the most beautiful sounding music from a traveling merchant. He did not know the author of the work as it was simply signed 'the Maestro'. The melody I played from them was wondrous and invoked feelings in me I have never felt before. However, as I reached the middle of the music, I discovered it was missing two pages! 
<br><b>You say,</b> 'What pages?'
<br><b>Baldric Slezaf says</b> 'The pages that were missing were pages 24 and 25. I have been searching the world for a spot to hold my symphony and I have finally found it. Without the music and a new lute crafted by the famous instrument maker Forpar Fizfla, I do not think I can pull it off. 
<br><b>You say,</b> 'Who is Forpar Fizfla?'
<br><b>Baldric Slezaf says</b> 'Forpar Fizfla is an eccentric instrument maker from Ak'Anon. He makes enchanted instruments that enhance the sound of the music. If I am to perform the concert of all concerts, I must have one of his instruments. I went to Ak'Anon, seeking to purchase an instrument from him but he wouldn't even speak to me. 
<br><b>You say,</b> 'What music?'
<br><b>Baldric Slezaf says </b>'It makes me sad to know that the pages of this music may be spread across the world or destroyed. If you find and bring me the two missing sheets as well as a new lute, I would be happy to repay you in some way. 
<br><b>You say,</b> 'How will you repay me?'
<br>Baldric Slezaf pulls a fantastic looking sword from its scabbard and says, 'I might be willing to part with this wonderful sword if I were able to perform this symphony. You would also gain recognition at the opening of the symphony.' Baldric sheathes his sword and begins to hum a haunting melody. 
<br><br>

The first part of the quest can easily be done yourself, even at a very early level, as it simply requires you to run a relay race across Antonica. It starts in West Karana with the bard Konia Swiftfoot in Guard Tower 1. She will send you off on the relay race carrying a torch to various people within Antonica. Talk to Konia and your race will begin...<br><br>

<b>You say:</b> "Yes I would like to participate."<br>
<b>Konia Swiftfoot says:</b> "Great! The prize will be this silly old music sheet. Let me know when you are ready and I will pass you the torch and tell you where the first stop is."<br>

<img src="/images/epic/imgEpicBaenarSwiftsong.jpg" alt="Baenar Swiftsong" border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="right">To get the bottom half of you need to give Konia Swiftfoot Mahlin's Bongos. Talk to Braenar Swiftsong. Braenar is located in South Karana next to the well at loc (-21, 88). He will give you an invoice after you ask "What doll". (If you have any info on how a bard knew to talk about a doll, please let me know.)
<br><br>
<a href="serra.asp">Detail on Braenar and his daughter Serra</a> - New additional page!
<br><br>
<b>You say,</b> 'hail Baenar Swiftsong'<br>
<b>Baenar Swiftsong says</b> 'Please, I am trying to work here.  If you bother me I will write a horrible song about you and sing it from the mountain tops! <br>
<b>You say,</b> 'what doll'<br>
<b>Baenar Swiftsong says</b> 'What's that you say?  You wish to have the doll I was to give her?  Whatever for?  Bah!  Nevermind me.  I rant like an old woman sometimes. I should let her memory go but I would stop my heart from beating before I forget that child.  Here, take this invoice.  I have no further use for it. Give it to Marfen Binkdirple. 
<br><br>
Go to Solusek A and give the gnome vendor, Marfen the invoice and you will receive a doll. Marfen is the same vendor who sells the Tinkerer's bags, he is found at loc (-304, -1083).
<br><br>
<b>Marfen Binkdirple says</b> 'Ah!  'Bout time ye got yer lazy bones down here!  I was beginnin' ta worry bout ya.  Thought ye'd never pick the doll up.  Me kin worked and toiled over this thing fer days.  That Baenar was sure exact in every detail.  For a special child, he said.  Must be some child.  He spent all he had and some he didn't.  Still owes us a show!  Anyway, I heard she passed away some time ago.  Give the lad muh regards. 
<br><br>
Take the doll to the Estate of Unrest and give the doll to Serra, who is next to the gnomish speulunker. She can be found by going through a underwater channel at the right side of the zone. Serra will give you a note.
<br><br>
<b>Serra says </b>'Oh!  You have the dolly!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  I can go home now.  Please give this to my father, Baenar.  He will understand when he gets it.'  Serra begins to fade away.  'Bye bye!' 
<br><br>
Then take the note from Serra back to Braenar, who will give a new note for Maligar.
<br><br>
<b>Baenar Swiftsong says</b> 'A note from the child?  How can that be!  How could she know I was her father?  Unless? Cyrah told her.  Forgive me.  Cyrah was the name of the woman to whom I was betrothed.  Unfortunately her parents forbade her from marrying a lowly bard such as myself.  Her father married her off to a young merchant in Qeynos named Maligar.    She married him only out of respect to her father.  Her heart was truly mine, at least, so she always said.  When Serra was born, I visited them both often.    She was like no other, so innocent and sweet.  In those few years I watched her grow up to be more and more like her mother and I saw none of the father in her appearance.  I do not like Maligar, but the least we can do is inform him of his child's death.  I saw his caravan pass by not more than a day ago headed to Qeynos. <br><br>
Take the note from Braenar to Maligar. Maligar is found in West Karana at loc (1179, -10878). His spawn is every 30 minutes or so, not bad, if you mess up (turn the head into the wrong guy), you can try again in a bit. After you give Maligar the note, he will spawn his Maligars Enraged Doppleganger.<br><br>
<b>Side Note:</b> This part of the quest was broken early April 2001, but is reported to have been fixed.</b>
<br><br>
<b>Maligar says</b> 'Hmmm. What's this?  A note from that silly bard Baenar?  I wasn't aware that those of his kind could write, much less read.'  Maligar lets out a deep laugh.  'I see you do not share my sense of humor.  Let's read it, shall we?  Oh, no!  She's dead?  I knew that already, you fool.  It was by my hand she died!  Ooops!  Did I let that slip out?  Silly me.  I guess I will have to kill you now!'
<br><br>
Maligar and his whole camps faction can be changed using lvl 11 song, Cinda's Charismatic Carillon. I was told at the time to charm him, so my experience is below...
<br><br>
When I killed Maligar and his Doppleganger, it was myself, a 47 bard, a 51 bard, a 53 wizzie, and a 45 druid. We pulled Maligar's friends first, who went down easily one by one. They do not aggro if you pull one by one. Then we charmed Maligar, ordered him to sit down, his Doppleganger spawned, and even though I was twisting resist songs, we still were blinded. I did resist the Fear spell though. I had my chants memmed, since I knew I was going to be blinded, so I had my target, and hopefully was able to get him a few times with my DoTs. From what I heard from the druid helping us, was that the Doppleganger was smart and blinded everyone he could. It was a very close fight, we brought him down though, and then charmed Maligar again, and got our second Maligar Doppleganger's head. 
<br><br>
Once you kill the doppleganger, loot his head. Unless you want to kill Maligar, you can run at this point to the zone. 
<br><br>
Take the head back to Braenar and recieve "Mahlin's Bongo's".<br><br>
<b>Baenar Swiftsong says</b> 'That vile dog!  I knew there was something not right with him, the way he stared at everyone with contempt!  Even his own wife!  I curse him!  I curse him to stay upon the realm and deny him what he most desires!  This is too much!  I cannot play or write this day.  The sadness overwhelms me.  In honor of Serra, the daughter that was denied to me in spirit, I vow never to play this instrument again!  It was her favorite and she listened to me play for hours on end.  Here take it!  Take it out of my sight!  Leave me be with my grief and my loss. 
<br><br>
Take the Bongo's to Konia Swiftfoot in West Karana to get the bottom of Page 24. 
<b>Konia Swiftfoot says</b> 'Mahlin's bongos!  Here, take the other half of the sheet music. I can not really make out what the signature was anyway. 


<br><br>


<h4>Page 25</h4>
To get Page 25, go to South Karana and talk to the wood-elf bard named Kelkin Mekia, she is between the centaurs and treants along the zone line that is a "drop-off". She needs the strings for her lute. The items she needs to make the strings for her lute are as follows:

<ol>
<li><b>Guts from a named chromatic drake in Skyfire Mountains</b>  - Eldric the Old: about level 51 and he summons 
<li><b>Guts from the named red wurm in Burning Woods</b> - drops off named wurms Nezekezena and Phurzikon
<li><b>Guts from the Huge Oynx Drake in Rathe Mountains</b> - Blackwing: level 40 something
</ol>

A few notes regarding these 3 guts:
<br><br>
<img src="/images/epic/imgEpicNezekezena.jpg" alt="Nezekezena in Burning Woods" border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="right" width="200" height="262">
To get the Red Wurm Gut you need to kill one of the named wurms in the Burning Woods - either <b>Nezekezena</b> or <b>Phurzikon</b>. Both will be high 40's to 51 in level, so at level 51, they can summon you and gate. Both these spawn at location (-470, -2550), so if you camp the spawn, you should be fine if they decide to gate back. A full group of low 50's can kill these wurms. Something spawns every two minutes, whether it be a PH or a Nekekezena or a Phurzikon...<br clear="right"><img src="/images/epic/imgEpicPhurzikon.jpg" alt="Phurzikon in Burning Woods" border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="right" width="150" >This is also a great camp for some fast experience, as the spawn time is 2 minutes, and there are lots of wanderers. You could convince a mage to camp it with you, as they also need the Burnt Embers for their epic, which is a much rarer drop.<br>
<br><br clear="right">
<img src="/images/epic/imgEpicBlackwing.jpg" alt="Blackwing in Rathe Mountains" border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="right" width="200" height="241">
<b>Blackwing</b> in Rathe Mountains will spawn spawn after clearing out the drakes in that area. It is the south-western part of the zone, and will spawn out of the loc (-1700, -15). Keep killing everything that spawn at this loc, including drakes and basalisks, and you will get Blackwing within an hour or so. Be very careful of the named drakes in this area. Zazamouhk, an evil enchanter sphinx and her pet are up on the hill but don't seem to move around much. She is around level 40. If you are agnostic and wear your Dark-elf illusion, you can go right up to her. Rharzar, however, is a level 55 green drake. Every bard I talked to that has camped Blackwing has been killed by Rharzar, including myself, he hit me so fast I couldn't even run one step. If you have him on tracking and are alone, do your best to avoid him, or come back another day. He is for the SK epic, so convince an SK in your guild to join you and bring a few groups down to kill Rharzar.<br><br>
Stay at the spawn spot mentioned above and you should be fine. You can chant-kite Blackwing, or melee him. At level 47, I discovered that I could melee these drakes easily.
<br><br clear="right">
<b>Eldric the Old</b> in Skyfire Mountains has a spawn spot of loc (500, -4000). Eldrig is a named Chromodrac, level 51. He will cast spell on you, but will dispell it right away. 
<br><br>Go north from the OT zone until you hit the spot. Every 15 minutes a mob will spawn, and start walking towards OT. If nothing is spawning, you must track down the placeholder and kill it before the spot will start re-spawning. Once this is accomplished, Eldric will spawn regularly. I am not positive that this is the only spawn spot of Eldrig. I have seen him up once, and he walks a path from this spot to the Burning Woods zone and back.
<br><br>When I finally found him up, my group fear kited him. I played my fear song, and fear song only. He went down quickly. We had 2 bards (levels 51 and 53), 53 warrior, 53 cleric, and 57 druid.
<br><br>
More details to come as I finish this part of the quest... Please send me more info if you have it.
<br><br>
Give the three guts back to Kelkin in South Karana and you will get page 25.
<br><br>

<h4>Forpar's Lute</h4>

Baldric Slezaf tells you that Forpar Fizla has this lute but will not speak to him. You must get this lute as your final item to return to Baldric. This is rewarded as head, neck, body and strings. 
<br><br>
Forpar Fizla is unwilling to talk to you and even other gnomes. To get him to talk you help his friend, a female half elf bard named Vedico at the docks in Butcherblock. 
<br><br>
<img src="/images/epic/imgEpicVedicoWindwisper.jpg" alt="Vedico Windwisper" border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="right">
Vedico Windwisper may be found on the docks in Butcherblock inside one of the shops at loc (1010, 3010). She lost her horn to a cyclops named Quag Maelstrome in the Ocean of Tears. If you kill him, you will get the "Alluring Horn" which you then return to Vedico in Butcherblock. 
<br><br>
<b>You say,</b> 'hail Vedico Windwisper'<br>
<b>Vedico Windwisper says</b> 'Hello Kocho .  Have you seen the port master?  I am here to complain about the shoddy service.<br> 
<b>You say,</b> 'What shoddy service?'<br>
<b>Vedico Windwisper says </b>'I was sailing from Freeport on one of the boats when a giant cyclops attacked the boat!  No one lifted a finger as he stole the horn I was playing and ran off.  Someone here has to answer for the loss of my horn. <br>
<b>You say,</b> 'what giant cyclops?'<br>
<b>Vedico Windwisper says</b> 'He was a huge cyclops!  He came rushing up out of the water and stared at me with his big eye and said, 'Me like horn me take and play pretty music!' before he snatched my horn and disappeared back under the waves. 
<br><br>
Find Quag Maelstrom in the Ocean of Tears on the Seafury Cyclops island. I was all prepared to solo chant-kite him (I was 49 at the time), when a 45 shaman wanted to help me out. I knew I didn't need his help, but thought it couldn't hurt. We found Quag at loc (1914, -6600). He was blue to me, and I could see him carrying my horn, it was very obvious. The shaman buffed me all up quite nicely, and gave me a sow and a levitate. The cyclops island is crowded with cyclops of course, so I pulled him to a nearby island. I quickly found he could run almost as quick as sow, so I just kept running round and round the island, chanting at him all the way. The shaman sicced his pet on Quag's behind. Looking back, it was quite humorous. Quag kept casting mana drains at me, which I resisted all but one, not that it affected my bardic mana anyway. A few times he was able to hit me, but I cast snare on him, which fixed that.  When Quag did hit me, he hit anywhere from 30 to 117 points damage, but he didn't get close to me for the most part, only when I was dumb enough to turn around and look at him. I did use my Denon's Desperate Dirge, which hit him for 363 points damage. The entire fight took less than 7 minutes, and he dropped the Alluring Horn, a Pearl Necklace, and 4 plat.
<br><br>
Take the horn back to Vedico in Butcherblock and she will then give you a note to give to Forpar. 
<br><br>
<b>Vedico Windwisper says</b> 'Where did you find this?  I thought the cyclops took it.  I am in your debt Kocho.  This horn has always been special to me.'
<br><i>Vedico reaches into her pack and pulls out a note. </i>
<br>'Do you think you could deliver this to my gnome friend Forpar.  I have not spoken to him in a while and unfortunatly I will be unable to make the trip to visit him.  If you are looking to have an instrument made he is the man to ask. 

<br><br>
<img src="/images/epic/imgEpicForparFizfla.jpg" alt="Forpar Fizfla" border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="right">Head to Steamfont Mountains and find Forpar Fizfla hanging out in one of the windmills. His loc is (128, -600). He was apprehensive to me, so I had to use Cinda's Charismatic Carillion and then he was amiable to me. Hand him the note from Vedico and he talks about his mystical lute he can make.

<br><br>
<b>You say,</b> 'hail Forpar Fizfla'<br>
<b>Forpar Fizfla says </b>'Get out you pesky Half Elf!  I don't need any Half Elf germs!  Out, ye filthy beast! <br>
[<b><i>Play Cinda's Charismatic Carillion. Once he takes a liking to you, hand him your note.</i></b>]<br>
<i>Forpar Fizfla judges you amiably -- looks like he would wipe the floor with you!</i><br>
<b>Forpar Fizfla says</b> 'So you know Vedico!  How is the lass?  If Vedico would give you the time of day, you must be something special.  What can I do for you?  I hope you have not come to have me make another [mystical instrument]. <br>
<b>You say,</b> 'what mystical instrument?'<br>
<b>Forpar Fizfla says</b> 'I have made many mystical instruments in the past.  Each one seemed to be better then the last.  I have always had a dream of building the world's best lute, but I have yet to find someone brave enough to gather the components needed to make the instrument. <br>
<b>You say,</b> 'i can gather components'<br>
<b>Forpar Fizfla says</b> 'To make a mystical lute I will first need to make several pieces.  If you bring me the backbone of an ancient fishman, a strong tentacle from one of the long lost amalgyms, and a petrified skull of a lycanthrope I may be able to create the head and neck of the instrument.  If you go out and gather these things, make sure to bring me the note I gave you or I might forget who you are.  I am getting quite old, you know. 
<br>
[<i><b>Receive Forpar's note.</b></i>]
<br><br>
<b>Mystical Lute Head</b><br><br>
This is the next big part of the quest. Forpar tells you he is willing to make you an instrument, but only tells you how to make the Neck and Head of the instrument. From what he says above, the list of items he needs includes: 
<ol>
<li><b>Backbone of an Ancient Fishman </b> - Phinigel Autropos's spine from Kedge Keep
<li><b>Amalgym Tentacle</b> - Amygdalan Tendril from Plane of Fear 
<li><b>Petrified skull of a Lycanthrope</b> - Petrified werewolf skull from Karnor's Castle on Drolvarg Warlord 
</ol>
<img src="/images/epic/imgEpicPhinigelAutropos.jpg" alt="Phinigel Autropos" border="0" align="right" width="100" height="167" hspace="2" vspace="2">
<b>Backbone of an Ancient Fishman </b> - Off Phinigel Autropos in Kedge Keep<br><br>
<b>Phinigel Autropos</b> requires a very well-organized couple of groups to take down, and be sure and bring a good puller with you. If the pull is not 100% successful Phinny might bring some Swirlspine Guardians with him. Our 28th level Pixie Strike mezz will not work on the adds, so you need to have the 53th level song to mezz, or bring along an enchanter. 
<br><br>
It is recommended that the best combination of songs to mem for the Phinigel raid (if you have them) are: 55 Occlusion of sound, 53 Song of Twilight, 55 Cantana Replenishment and 3 Jaxon's Jig of Vigor. Of course keep the Enduring Breath song memmed as well just in case. The Occlusion of Sound is very useful in stripping the seahorses and Phinigel of their Magic resistance. The casters are better able to land their nukes. When the monk is pulling do not play songs as it will aggro more than one mob. If two or more come you will have to mez, but if the pull is successful, only one or two mobs will come. You might either spend the raid debuffing Phinny and his seahorses, or mezzing the adds.
<br><br>Our guild has killed him 25 times, and only 3-4 times has a Phinny Spine drop. Two groups seemed to be sufficient but a high level bard or enchanter is a must just in case the pull brings back Phinnie and friends. My guild also has some recommendations on their resistances and strategies to take them down, but our forum was deleted, so I will have to look these up again.
<br><br>
I do not have first-hand info on the Amalgym Tentacle nor the Petrified Skull, so please send me what information you have. I got my Skull from a train in KC where my group picked the Drolvarg Warlord off and killed him. Drolvarg Warlord is around level 53-54. 
<br><br>
<h3><i>Please send information if you have it regarding the rest of this quest... I have not done this part first-hand, so I will need the text from the conversation with Forpar from here on.</i></h3>
<br><br>
Take all 3 items and the note back give to Forpar and he gives you back the Mystical Lute Head (a single item containing the head and neck of the lute).
<br><br>
<b>Body of Mystical Lute</b><br><br>
When you receive your Head and Neck from Forpar, he will give you the quest for the body, which requires the following items: 
<ol>
<li><b>Large red Dragon Scale</b> - Talendor of Skyfire, Lord Nagafen or Ragefire in Naggy's Lair, or Nortlav Scalekeeper in The Hole
<li><b>Large white Dragon Scale</b> - Gorenaire of Dreadlands or Lady Vox's 
<li><b>Metal bit</b> (smithed metal bit) 
</ol>

<br><br>
<b>Mystical Lute Strings</b>
<br><br>
Finally, get the strings for the Lute - Trakanon Gut Strings. These drop from Trakanon himself (Level 65 dragon in Sebilis). There have been some recent changes to the quest. It seems that the Trak guts no longer drop from the regular Trakanon. You get another spawn of Trakanon to spawn by talking to the Undead Bard. The undead bard spawns 18 +/- 4 hours after Trakanon is killed. You turn in the lute body to him. He returns the lute body, becomes enraged, he needs to be killed (don't know his details off hand, but it's not unlike triggering ragefire). He is around level 55. When the enraged undead bard is killed, Trakanon spawns. This spawned Trakanon is not as strong as the regular Trak, I believe this is mostly due to not being buffed by jumpy. He drops Trak guts 100% of the time, and also drops a Trakanonian BP (random) but no teeth.
<br><br>
Also, a new update to the quest is that Nortlav Scalekeeper is a new source of red scales, he is in the Hole, same room as Master Yael, and he lifetaps and stuff. 
<br><br>

Finally, give the following lute parts plus the note to Foplar to receive the complete Mystical Lute:
 
<ol>
<li>Mystical Lute Head 
<li>Body 
<li>Gut strings 
</ol>

The last point, if you are chaining any part of the magical flute, make sure the person you are chaining with has good gnome faction. If they do no have good gnome faction, make sure you bring an enchanter to charm Forpar. Charming works and so does multiquesting with Forpar. 

<h4>The Reward!</h4>

You are almost there. To get your singing short sword give following items to Baldric Slezaf: 

<ol>
<li>Top of page 24 
<li>Bottom of page 24 
<li>Page 25 
<li>Mystical lute from Foplar 
</ol>

He will reward you with the Singing Short Sword!<br><br>
Most of the pieces required for the Singing Short Sword are quite easy for a high-40's/50's bard and can be done alone. You will need 1-2 good groups in the 50's for some of the items. You might want friends to help with Maligar, and will want a good group to get your Petrified Werewolf skull and Burning Woods and Skyfire guts. You will want a few good groups to get your Phinigel spine. You'll need lots of help to get your scales, especially the white scale and the trak guts.
