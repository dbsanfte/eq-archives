				<td colspan="2"><span>It seems to me that SOE doesn't know what to do with bards.  We aren't really comparable to any other class: although we do something of almost every class, we do it in a completely different way.
<br />

<br />
So, we have some fantastic benefits and some pretty annoying drawbacks, but right now I suspect they see us as not really broken, so why fix us?  Especially since we don't fit any other mold.  We're an anomaly as a class, our problems are anomalies, our advantages are anomalies... we're in the &quot;too hard&quot; basket and they're probably glad we aren't actually a major problem!
<br />

<br />
Someone intentionally made the bard unique in gameplay, not just in abilities... some things might not have been forseen, like the AE kiting of 50+ mobs, but the bard isn't so different simply by blind luck and the development, by the players, of the way the class is played.  The bard is different because the class <i>was designed that way</i>.  I can't really believe that it happened any other way.
<br />

<br />
I'm not really arguing for or against any fixes to any of our &quot;top 10&quot; issues, or for or against any nerfs.  As I see it, SOE is, quite rationally, more interested in playing off the unfair advantages against the unfair drawbacks than they are in making everything fair.  And, the bard is <i>reasonably</i> (if not perfectly) well-balanced in that respect.  There are some things which are just annoying, and it'd be nice if they could fix them, but most of the other things seem to be requests for our unfair disadvantages to be removed while hoping they won't touch our unfair advantages.  Unless someone at SOE has a brain explosion, that ain't gonna happen!
<br />

<br />
As I see it, if they give every bard better melee abilities, we can kiss our solo, mass kiting abilities goodbye.  It seems to me that there's a direct trade-off here, in the developers' and the live team's minds, between being physically weak and tactically strong.  I really, really hope that we don't just automatically get improved melee and an accompanying AE nerf, because it removes the choice from our gameplay.  
<br />

<br />
My preference would be the creation of a new AA &quot;focus&quot;, with several levels that allow you to swap (perhaps permanently) the range of PBAoE songs (and perhaps our charm? sorry swarmers!) for improved melee ability.  Then, die-hard AE fans can live without better melee (as they've done all along), and die-hard melee fans can sacrifice their AE abilities for the dream of tanking.  Hmm... I might just /feedback that! <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-4.gif" border="0" alt="Tongue out" hspace="2" />

My problems with the top 10 list(other then being 9 is)
<br />

<br />
We, well in my opinion, only have like 5 real WISH LIST items on there.
<br />

<br />
(number 8 is glitch, due to server lag which i have no idea how they are going to fix, since it does effect all classes we just notice it most...)
<br />

<br />
(Auto-Twist-  i have no problem keeping 4 songs up been doing for 5 years come on we can biatch about something else and use our time better...)
<br />

<br />
(number 3...! come on THAT IS WHAT BARDS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE AT, it should not be on our WISH LIST of asking the all powerful SOE to give us our classes deff...)
<br />

<br />
(number 1, missed notes i agree it being on our wish list makes it get the attention of soe more, but again its our wish list...)
<br />

<br />
I dont know if anyone thinks im way off base on any of this let me know would like to hear ur ideas.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>I don't want to judge SoE's policy on how to handle offical answers given to the public. But their &quot;currently being evaluated&quot; answer is just down right weak for a lack of a better word.
<br />

<br />
Sure they are a big company and they want to get it right the first time but we are all human here. They treat us like robots. Why can't they be more human and talk to us like human beings. &quot;Currently being evaluated&quot; is just bull.
<br />

<br />
The answers we want is logically thought and in easy. Sure we as players can't think about ALL the problems that goes on when fixing an issue but we sure as h*ll like to know about it. An example would be like : 
<br />

<br />
&quot;We also think that the fizzle rate is not working very well, we will change it as soon as we figure out the code. If it doesn't work out we can try something new&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Sure that sounds flawed, but that's the beauty of it all. I mean they can come up with real issues like 
<br />

<br />
&quot;the guy who worked on fizzle code up and died, we need to replace him and we need to train him then we can start implementing something that will work for all of us&quot;
<br />

<br />
I bet that's exactly what Sony is trying to aviod saying. But the key thing here is, there is a very close chance that we can get a more yes... or more no answer.
<br />

<br />
Now that my friends that is an answer.</span></td>

What SoE means:  &quot;We have no flippin clue how to address that issue, nor are we sure we really care to.  Most of the developers that were here when bards were first created have either passed away or have entered the witness protection agency to avoid anything related to EQ.  Of the developers currently here, none really know how the bard class works.  The toilet paper that was used for note taking by the original developers has all since bio-degraded (yeay them for being PC), so we have nothing to go on.  We are thus currently wag'n it as we go.  We are hoping to encode an aspect into the class with the next expansion in order to get the player community interested enough to 'look the other way', and hopefully bury this issue over time.  Please continue to post your concerns on every possible EQ forum, so we can view each and every one in detail (snicker).&quot;
<br />

<br />
What SoE says:  &quot;Discussions on hold until after the Omens of War Launch&quot;
<br />

<br />
What SoE means:  &quot;Please, oh please, oh PLEASE, let this issue get buried over time.  We are trying to find more ways to get money out of you, not spend money on fixing silly issues such as this.&quot;

				<td colspan="2"><span>SoE is a big company.  But the development team is rather tiny.  How many developers are there really?  5?  6?
<br />

<br />
Claiming issues can be fixed in 5 minutes is just untrue.  *Some* code changes can be made in 5 minutes, but, issues aren't nescisarily about code fixes.  Some are design issues which need to be discussed by devs and designers.
<br />

<br />
Lets assume an issue takes 1 hour to discuss between 5 people (some will take 5 minutes, some will have heated discussions that will go on for hours).  Considering you have 18 lists (16 class, 1 pvp, 1 tradeskills), it would take 180 hours to disucss the issues.  That translates to 22.5 working days which translates into 1 working month assuming the devs are doing nothing else.
<br />

<br />
That is a lot of time to commit just to class lists and nothing else.
<br />

<br />
While most of us see theses issues as cut and dry, resolving them isn't always the best thing for EQ as a whole.  Bards have class issues and some may never be resolved becuase that is one of the drawbacks of being a bard.  We can't have all positives and no negatives (just like every other class).
<br />

<br />
About only having 9 issues: I was out on vacation when they updated the list.  I didn't get a chance to add in a 10th issue, but was able to remove one that was pretty much complete.  After coming back and seeing that nothing is really going to be done till after OoW release, I decided not to persue adding a 10th issue becuase after OoW all our issues may change.  If the top 9 issues are resolved, I think we'd be pretty happy (even without a 10th one listed).
<br />

<br />
Lastly, the top 10 list is not a wish list.  It's an issues list and putting wish list items (especially unreasonable ones) will either be completely ignored or rejected right away.  Bugs on our top 10 list will get more attention wishes on other classes lists.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Tremlo, its a matter of how they are handling things.  In two months the only thing we've gotten is &quot;we're looking into it&quot;.  They said they were stopping working on the expansion to address community issues.  Now they are working on the expansion again without having addressed the issues.  
<br />

<br />
I said when they first announced it they just weren't ready to release OoW and used the community thing as PR.  I was a bit cynical when I said it, but it doesn't seem such a far stretch really.  
<br />

<br />
Someone else said it amounts to bait &amp; switch.  While its not that legally, the effect is the same.  Promise one thing and then not doing it.

<br />
If they don't have enough people to handle the job, they need to get more people.  That is something that SoE can completely control and thus get no pity for it.

If they yank the people off of community issues to work on the expansion after promising to address community issues, that again is something they can control, so no pity for it.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Jaroll,
<br />

<br />
Don't get me wrong.  I would like more feedback and more attention devoted to our class.  But lets understand the reality of the situation.  SoE is a corporation that is out to make as much money with the smallest overhead possible.
<br />

<br />
Expansions (new versions of software) make more money than bug fixes.  Bug fixes are required to keep the customer.  There's a point where bug fixes stop and expansions need to come out.
<br />

<br />
Have we reached that point?  SoE believes so.  That business decision may loose customers but that loss may not be as much as is gained by new sales.
<br />

<br />
No where did they say they would fix anything on the top 10 list.  In fact, they didn't even say they would address the issues.  The correspondents pushed hard for them to give any feedback.  They have fixed some stuff (not much bard stuff though).
<br />

<br />
Also, they have added a lot of features, changes &amp; fixes based on information they aquired through the summit.  Take a look at the list they generated from the summit and see how many items they addressed.  Take a look at the last few patch messages and see how many items where patched becuase of community input.
<br />

<br />
I would hardly call that a &quot;bait and switch.&quot;

As for bait and switch, my but don't we have short memories... There have been at least 2 things removed from our list because they were fixed.  AND, let's not forget the 2 or 3 patches that had hundreds of little things all over the place.  
<br />

<br />
It's a big game. There are thousands of issues and only a relatively small number of developers (though it's way more than the 5-6 listed above).  And, with the resources they got, new content has to be developed.  
<br />

<br />
Making sure levels 66-70 are balanced is FAR FAR FAR more important than looking into whether our 'speeds up, slows down' issue is resolved or whether the 'autotwist' macro is still being considered.

				<td colspan="2"><span>For all the years I've played EQ, these issues, certainly melee damage/mitigation have been there will always be, but I've never ever really thought of us as broken or lacking in any way.  
<br />

<br />
There have been only a few times that I can think where we were really screwed up, and the most recent two were:
<br />

<br />
1) The day and half group songs didn't work.  (First day of Luclin relesase)
<br />
2) The week instrument mods didn't apply to our songs (About a year ago?  Maybe longer.)
<br />

<br />
I started this game with a but nekkid bard, a noob sword and a piece of paper to guive to my guild leader.  I teethed on Orc 1 and the NRO Derv camps.  My first full suit of armor was banded, which I slowly replaced with bronze or Lambent in my late twenties.  I moved to Kunark when everybody else did, lvled in OT, then Dreadlands, then KC, then Sebilis and when it came time to set sail for the frozen wasteland I met my first GD frost giants in lambent/seb scale, maybe 1 or 2 pieces of Singing Steel, armed with SSoY and a Sioniche's Partisan.  My instruments were MMBD, Mino horn, gypsy lute, vendor horn.
<br />

<br />
I never had a problem.  I almost always got groups, and when I couldn't, soloing was never an issue.  The only role I haven't been able to fill in a group is main healer, and that's it.  I have been called upon many a time to be a group's MT, and as long as the group knows how let me keep agro, it's never an issue.  I have to say one of my favorite LDoN combos is me, healer, bst/sham, and any combo of three mag/nec/wiz.
<br />

<br />
To me, the only real problem for a bard is when he/she doesn't know how to play their class.

				<td colspan="2"><span>[quote=&quot;from SOE's Official boards&quot;]The stated reason for delaying OoW, adressing the community's concerns prior to launch, has now been delayed due to the upcoming launch[/quote]
<br />

<br />
Still sums it up best.  This was on the official boards.  Reminds me of the opening credits of Monty Pythons Quest for the Holy Grail.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">SoE is a corporation that is out to make as much money with the smallest overhead possible.</span></blockquote> 
<br />

<br />
I'm all for minimizing expenses.  I'm an accountant afterall.  However, you still have to have enough resources to get the job done.  If you can't get the job done there isn't any point to doing it at all.
<br />

<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">Expansions (new versions of software) make more money than bug fixes. Bug fixes are required to keep the customer. There's a point where bug fixes stop and expansions need to come out.</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
As such, I'm still not going to buy the expansion until the major issues I've harked on in many places (here, TCH, my own site) are addressed.  Many in my guild are in the same boat.  I am hoping (and encouraging) others in similar situations will do the same.  This will push the bar of where buggy and broken items have to be fixed.
<br />

<br />
&lt;&lt;edit&gt;&gt; 
<br />
I have tried to participate in the community and SOE boards.  I continue to give the best feedback I can to help improve the game (even beta'ing and giving feedback on an expansion I won't buy).  It still feels like beating my head against a brickwall, but I still continue to try.  I don't complain about these things just to complain.  I truly like EQ and hope that the issues that players like myself have.  I am simply beyond feeding more money to SOE while they do not address the issues that are important to a segment of their customers.
<br />

In a real company, developers are not allowed to change functionality of code without the requirements changing.  Changing requirements/functionality of a product takes time.
<br />

<br />
Secondly, if you changed one line of code that signficantly changed functionality, you're not done.  You still have to unit test it and then it has to be QA'd.  The idea that it takes 5 minutes to change code is ludicrious at best.  While it may take 5 minutes to open up the file, check it out of source safe, type the characters in, compile and check it back in, that's not the only aspect of making code changes unless you're working on a 300 line program for a high school project.  Real world software takes more time.
<br />

<br />
SoE may not want to give us these improvements.  We think it would benefit our class and the game in general.  That is <b>our</b> opinion which may not be what SoE wants.
<br />

<br />
Describing code changes as you've layed out above is very amaturish.  You don't know what the code looks like.  You can't say &quot;just open up 1 file and tweak this variable.&quot;  I don't know what the code looks like, so it may be that simple, though my years of experaince makes me doubt that.  It's real easy to say things like &quot;make the mobs realize they are being kited&quot; but in actual practice, it's very difficult.
<br />

<br />
If they make any changes to bards, I hope they spend more than 5 minutes working the code.  If they don't, I bet you can expect to see selos broken for a week after the release of OoW.  Is that what you really want?</span></td>

After Sony took over its all about pleasing the customers and getting more money. You can feel that its all about keeping accounts active and getting more money. Where is the pleasure? where is the game going? 
<br />

<br />
Seriously, EQ isn't making any sense anymore. GoD's story isn't in any way connected to anything and it seems Sony is making a new game within the game.

I wish VI was back in charge.</span></blockquote>The vision that you are required to have a warrior, cleric and enchanter in your group to be efficient?
<br />

<br />
The vision that monks are the only pullers?
<br />

<br />
The vision that parent classes are all powerful and hybrids get half of each of thier parent class, but when you add it up they're only about 75% as useful?
<br />

				<td colspan="2"><span>I would be the very last one to say that I feel that every item on our top ten should have been implemented. Some I'd rather see thrown away &amp; never even considered. But, either my memory is failing (a possibility) or we've had 2 issues adressed and 0 issues fixed. The SotE &quot;no plans to change&quot; and the &quot;items with mods will be added in with future expansions&quot;. Yes, we replaced 2 items. But to say that we've had 2 items fixed is disingenuous. 
<br />
I would simply like to see an ACTUAL update at some point. Something a bit closer to &quot;They're working on the code&quot; or &quot;This is being discussed as part of the class balancing discussions&quot;. Anything that gives information as opposed to just a haphazard phrasing which seems to me, correctly or incorrectly, to be a way for them to pretend to be listening to their customers.
