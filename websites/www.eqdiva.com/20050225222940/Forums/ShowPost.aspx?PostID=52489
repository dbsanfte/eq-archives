				<td colspan="2"><span>Greetings All,
<br />

<br />
This is my first post on this wonderful forum!  I love the website, and I am excited to get to know many of you who frequent this forum.  My name is Ashlii, I am a Bard of the 24th Song on the Morden Rasp server, and I am addicted to EverQuest.
<br />

<br />
I am here to learn from you all because knowledge can be attained from anyone, despite their level.  There are so many little short-cuts and things you learn through out the years that you wish you knew back when you first started a bard.  I have played EverQuest since 1999, however I took a 3 year vacation after being called a Petless Mage.  I was a Wizard thinking I'd be omnipotent and the best compared to all others at higher levels.
<br />

<br />
I have read most of the information on the site and I am considered a valuable asset to any group I make or join.  I know there is much to learn still, and that is why I am going to make a big effort to get all the information I can out of you all.  The newest thing I've learned recently was the /gems game.  I might have heard of it years ago, but the first time I ever played that game was a few days ago.  Heh, its neat stuff like that that makes me smile.  Here are a few problems I am having, sure I could search the entire web and site for it to see if it has ever been answered, but I would like to hear it from your mouth.  Only answer if you would like to help, thank you in advance <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-5.gif" border="0" alt="Wink" hspace="2" />
<br />

<br />
1.  How important is the defense skill to us as bards?  I would think it would be Very important.  Well, I have only like *blushes* 12 points in defense and I am wondering if its possible to raise it still at a much higher level?  Can I just let green mobs hit me all day to raise it or can only stuff I melee (blue/white/yellow/red) raise my defense?
<br />

<br />
((Sidenote to #1:  I maxed my 1h slash skill, however I noticed when I tried to max my very low 1h blunt and piercing skills, it was almost impossible at higher levels.  I had to raise the skills through a trainer in order to begin to raise it by attacking mobs in my experience range.))
<br />

<br />
2.  Mordern Rasp server prices on items are ridiculously high compared to any other server.  This means when I buy equipment and weapons, I better be 100% sure that the item is the best item in comparison to other similar items.  I have spoken to countless Bards of All Levels, and it seems that the most important stats on items seems to be in order of importance:  Charisma, Armor Class, Dexterity, Agility, then Health Points or Stamina
<br />

<br />
My question is, do you agree this should be the method to see if the item is Best suited for you?  I love to group, and my main problem is magic resistance.  I noticed the Singing Armor has some effects for level 45+ I believe, but most of the armor has little or no statistical benefit in comparison to other equipment.  A Singing Breastplate on Morden Rasp goes for 50,000 platinum.  Similar Singing armor pieces go for 5,000pp.  Ridiculous prices for items that I see little benefit from.  My main concern is the order of importance for stats on equipment, so please direct your attention to that, thank you.
<br />

<br />
3. Now I may have overlooked this in another post or guide, but I think an updated answer is needed anyways just in case someone has a new or different opinion on this.  All opinions are greatly appreciated, thank you!  What are the 3 general types of songs do you play during battle?  I know this will be answered on a case per case basis, however I want to point out a specific event that has troubled me:
<br />
--
<br />
We're fighting in a dungeon and the puller pulls too many mobs.  Perhaps 2 or 3.  Now, I have the choice to keep playing my 3 songs consisting of Group Haste/Str buff, AC/MR Increase, Heal Song or I can try to Mez one of the mobs.  Do you keep playing the songs or try to Mez?  Is it possible to constantly Mez multiple mobs While fighting?  Is it possible to Charm multiple mobs?  while fighting?
<br />

<br />
Thanks for any input, I truly appreciate your time and reply.
<br />

<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
Ashlii of the 24th Song

Answering your post would take a sweeping blanket of information due to the lack of level incusion.  Depending on what level you are dictates what songs you can sing.  This dictates what options you have available to you, as well as gear.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Welcome to the community first of all
<br />
1. yes the only way to raise defence is to get smacked around by exp mobs. The same thing goes for weapon skills if you need to raise a weapon skill I suggest you get a fast weapon for that skill and get some dex buffs and again need exp mobs for it to work.
<br />

<br />
2. The way I went was cha,dex,int,ac, sta,hp  The reason for this was I loathed missed notes as well as the fact I kept having to play enchanter alot in my groups. The stats people choose will vary by their playstyle though.
<br />

<br />
3. ok you can only charm one mob at a time, second of all if its only one add that you need to mez what you can do with practice is target the to be mezed mob start the mez toggle back to orginal target and continue to attack it.
<br />

<br />
As bards we only get 1 line of sight check during casting so this allows us to effect mobs we have targeted at the start of a song rather then the target we have at the end of it.
<br />

<br />
This will take practise but once you have the pattern right you will learn to continue your twist semi normally with a mob mezed in camp. Learning skills like these is often what makes you standout as a bard compared to the ones that people make as pocket mana sources.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Your question regarding what you would do it a certain situation revolves around what role(s) you are playing in your group. For example, if there is no enchanter in your group, you take control of CC meaning yes, you should mez, charm, do whatever you have to in order to make things easier for other members of your group. You can only charm 1 thing at a time and you can't sing another charm until your orginal breaks (not even on your current charm).  Since bards are very good pullers it would be wise for you to get your defense up! At times your lull/pull combo won't work exactle textbook and you'll get 2-3 mobs on you. For that brief time they'll beat on you and if you have low Def, well, you might have a short life because mobs will crank you for all you're worth with defense as low as yours at that lvl. PLUS, you will not gain skill against green mobs so please dont think you can let a decaying skelly beat on you and expect to gain skill hehe.
<br />

<br />
For myself, i like to focus on getting some +cha items but i don't overlook the other stats either. I try to find something that will balance my points out nicely. I understand that at higher lvls maxing stats through items is a lot easier.
<br />

<br />
I find that setting up a key for &quot;toggle between mobs&quot; especially useful when it comes to crowd control. Sometimes through the frenzy you can't exactly get a bead on where the h*ll your mouse pointer is and even then you might just constantly click on a party member. With the key set (you get it in your options menu, not setting up a hotkey) you can easily go through mobs nearest you. I hope this little bit helps.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>I have incorporated many of the ideas you all shared with me in today's hunts and things are working out great.  Not meaning to boast, but my group members exclaimed I was the best bard they have ever seen in the game.  I noticed a lot of the other bards on my server only sing 1 song the whole time and *sometimes* change it.
<br />

<br />
Anyways...The only problem I have now is trying to figure out how a fellow group member does his &quot;auto-skills&quot;.  He explained the process and it sounds simple, but for some reason its not working for me.  Basically, here's what he said, maybe someone could tell me what to do more clearly, especially if you do this yourself:
<br />

<br />
&quot;Does anyone auto-forage?  Its when you forage all the time.  You don't use a macro, you go to the options and bind the forage skill to your right arrow.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Now, this sounds like a great way to gain those boring but vital skills that no one wants to waste their time raising.  Everytime you use your right arrow.. you forage.  That's ingenious I think, you'd gain the skill and its as if you're doing nothing.
<br />

<br />
I noticed other casters and members, they speak in group chat as they're casting a spell.  Is there a way to automatically say stuff while you're casting a spell, or do they hit a totally different macro key?
<br />

<br />
If anyone does that bind trick for arrow keys, let me know.
<br />

<br />
Thank you!
<br />

<br />

It's a seperate macro for the spell. For example, my paladin's hotkeys...

-----------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
1. Defense, get as much as you can in it.  You probably won't spend a lot of time tanking because we tank worse than rangers... but you'll still get hit.  I swarm kited pretty much from 39 to 65 so my defense was pretty pitiful.  Once you hit 60 the fastest way I found to fix it was to use Kazumi's (lvl 60 bard invul song) and pull 30ish blue mobs and let them all swing away.
<br />

<br />
2.  I found cha and int to be the most important, but again, I used them for swarm kiting.  If you usually group then you would probably want different stats.  The only stat I wouldn't waste my time on is wisdom.
<br />

<br />
As for Singing Steel, most of them can be useful for the clicky/worn effects.  I had the bp, boots, bracer, and gloves just for the effects.  There are much better items to be worn, but you can always carry around a piece of SS in your inventory and only put it on long enough to clicky it.
<br />

<br />
3.  It all depends on the group and what you are fighting.
<br />

<br />
4.  To bind a skill to an arrow key, you just have to go to the options (ctrl - o), select the keyboard tab, select macros from the select category drop-down box.  Let's assume that you put foraging in hot button slot 1. Click on the line for hot button 1 where it says '-----' under the 'Alternate' column.  Now push the up arrow.   Close the options window.
<br />

<br />
Now whenever you push up, whatever skill is in hotbutton slot 1 will be used.  I'm sure there are more advanced ways to do it with a button using /doability, but this is the easiest way without writing out a button macro.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Here's my advice on playing a bard, especially at low level.
<br />

<br />
1 Defense.  Defense is a hard skill to practice especially if your not the tank.  However, your skill will go up in time, especially if you start to fill the roles of puller and crowd control.  You will inevitebly get hit and the more you get hit the better your skills become.  The easist way to up your skill is simply to let it happen.  Or to keep an eye out for mosters that you can solo using melee skills.   
<br />

<br />
2 Stats.  The most important stat for all classes is hit points.  When it comes to fighting mosters, the one who lasts is the one who wins.  HP will forgive low resists, low ac, low int, mana, etc etc(and of course Defense).  That's not to say those skills aren't important, but HP should be what you focus on.  Get as many hp/sta items as you can focusing on HP as eventually you'll have max stamina, and replace stamina items with HP items.  As a bard twisting songs and mezzing/charming mobs will be your defining abilities.  As a result you should look very hard at Charisma.  Charisma affects your missed notes, and it affects resists on charm, mez, &amp; lull.  All other stats will follow if you focus on HP, Sta &amp; Cha.  Intelligence and Dexterity are things to keep an eye on when your torn between HP/sta/cha items.
<br />

<br />
3. Song lineup.  Pretty much my entire career, I've always played 2 types of songs consistently, and one flavor song.  You will always play a mana song, whether it's level 16 or 32 mana, or at higher levels hp regen/mana songs.  Regardless, mana is allways on my playlist even when I'm solo'ing (high end mana songs add a lot of hp regen).  Second is some sort of haste/melee buff.  I could write a thesis on the importance of haste and attack, but instead I'll just link a great source of information on haste, how it works and let you then understand why you should always have the max haste possible (unless your the tank, it's more important to hit harder and slower so you get riposted less, but that's mostly endgame and not a bard issue for the most part).
<br />

<br />
http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallfrm8.showMessage?topicID=99.topic
<br />

<br />
Finally the third slot is one that will pretty much change depending on the situation, you may be the only slower/snarer in the group, so that will be your 3rd song, you may want to add extra regen, it completely depends on your level, the situation, and the songs you have in your arsenal at the time.  An excellent standby is slow/snare if your not sure.  Oh, and do not overlook fear, not getting hit is the best offense.  Just make sure someone snares.
<br />

<br />
Hope that helps.  There is soo much more, but that should keep you busy for quite a while.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I have to disagree with fernwillow on the STA/HP issue for base stats.
<br />
Yes, we need HP, but more important is not missing notes or failing lulls and charms and mez.  I'm a strong proponent of INT, CHA, DEX.
<br />
Remember, as a bard you are not a tank, you're not meant to be a tank.  Yes, you can to a degree tank, but it is not really our baliwick.  Why do you think we kite things with Selo's and are all innured to dying as we learn to kite properly?
<br />

<br />
What is more important, reducing missed notes or having a few extra HP?  I avoid taking damage as much as possible and hate missed notes.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Hi Shassiash,
<br />

<br />
I anticipated that someone would disagree with me, and of course, it's a matter of opinion to a certain degree, however I would like to point out one small thing. It is the consensus that Dex has nothing to do with missed notes.  Here's an overly longwinded discussion on missed notes that may help shed some light on that subject.
<br />

<br />
http://p201.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessage?topicID=19312.topic
<br />

<br />
That leaves charisma as the determining factor behind missed notes, charm, mez &amp; lull.  You could easily argue that charisma is the most important bard stat, but it's this bards opinion that it's more important to live long enough to finish casting mez, than to have a high charisma so that it lands.  For the purpose of this guide, I'd suggest that if your torn between which stats to boost first, go for a balance, between hp, sta &amp; cha.  When I was a young bard I went for Cha first, and it worked well for me, but in retropsect I wish I had focused a bit more on HP, it would have saved me a lot of unnecessary upgrades. 
<br />

<br />
I hope I didn't confuse you too much with all that Ashlii.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Well. I went with the hitpoint, Sta, Cha, route.  
<br />

<br />
As a younger bard tho, I looked more to Cha, 
<br />

<br />
Basically.. from 20-45, I did Cha, hitpoints, sta,   now at those levels If i had my cha at 170'ish  (unbuffed) and an item came up with more hitpoints and sta on it. I would replace what I  have.  I would try not to go below 170 charisma tho.
<br />

<br />
45 to 55,  I had a second set of equipment that was basically all resists.. ( I was hitting Hall of Testing (HoT) and generally all of Temple of Veeshan)  where you do need your resists in perferablly 100+.
<br />

<br />
from 55 to 65,  I basically used Sappers upgrade chart.   where I placed a heavey emphasive on Sta, Hitpoint, AC.   
<br />
My charisma is a tad low going this route.. but I usually just hit some enchanter/shaman for a charisma buff which helps.
<br />

<br />
Currently,  my Sta is almost maxed out, with raid buffs,  so I'm now looking for upgrades with a bit more charisma, but still have some sta on it.  its basically a pick and choose right now which is more benificial over all.  
<br />

And you can't go wrong with charisma augs when you can,<img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border="0" alt="Smiley" hspace="2" />

				<td colspan="2"><span>First of all welcome to the boards Ashlii! It is always nice to see new people posting here. But without further ado:-
<br />

<br />
1: Defence is important to every class, but even more so to classes that have a realistic chance of mitigating a significant portion of a mob's damage. As a bard you will get hit on occasion, not as much as a warrior or an enchanter, but enough to give it serious consideration.
<br />

<br />
Because Defence also directly adjusts your AC it also has an effect on the equipment choices you have available to you (see 2).
<br />

<br />
The way to raise it is to simply get hit by blue and above mobs. Certain high cyans may also give imps, but for the most part stick with blues for this. The same also applies to raising melee stats - just hit them and eventually they will start catching up.
<br />

<br />
Oh yes, an additional tip for raising melee skills, always use your fastest weapon in your offhand until Dual Wield is maxed for your level. After that transfer it (or whichever skill you want to raise most) to your primary hand. This maximises the number of swings you get per level helping the imp rate over time.
<br />

<br />
2: This used to be a key question within bard circles, and it's still misunderstood now by many. The simple truth is that there are different styles of playing a bard, and these affect equipment choices. First of all I'll mention solo bards. This is not you but they do tend to have specific areas to concentrate on, namely mana regen, HP regen, cha and HP.
<br />

<br />
For more group-oriented bards there are 2 completely different approaches. The traditional way was for bards to concentrate on cha and HP, and then add AC and resists as a secondary concern. This approach sometimes means having to use a lower aggro twist than might be optimal, but does make for a consistent puller or crowd controller in a group that can keep the bard from being hit.
<br />

<br />
The alternative style is to concentrate on AC, with cha and HP of secondary importance. The point of this approach is to be able to take a few hits where necessary without being a mana sponge. This means you can play very high aggro twists with more safety, and also means that bad pulls of mez/charm resists are more survivable.
<br />

<br />
Personally I was a bard of the latter type, and it is still my belief that this style is best for low level bards. However, I will add a caveat to the AC style. At higher levels the effects af AC start to diminish significantly for bards. My advice to AC bards would be to go for AC up to lvl50 and then to gradually convert over to HP between 50 and 60. Ideally you should keep your AC around the 1200 mark buffed.
<br />

<br />
Above lvl60 most bards will stress the importance of HP over anything, at least unless you are acting as a full-time puller, in which case the argument for cha increases.
<br />

<br />
3: OK, I will go through these things one at a time and point out some different options. First of all nearly all bards will play a haste and a slow as 2 of their songs if these roles are not covered by another group member. Even if there is a chanter or shammy in the grp it is often better to let the bard handle 1 or both of these roles. For the 3rd song some form of dmg (eg fufil when you get it) or damage mitigation (hymn, resists) is normal. In a group where hastes and slows are covered you are essentially just acting as dps or dmg mitigation and choose songs accordingly.
<br />

<br />
Now let's come to the situation of a multi-mob pull. First of all let's say you have 2 mobs. Most bards in this situation would automatically mez or charm the add and then play a couple of key alternative songs. Bards that have learnt the skill will probably also melee whilst doing this.
<br />

<br />
But that is by no means the only way of handling the situation. An alternative can be to use an AE slow (largo) and simply let the add hit you whilst you kill the first mob as quickly as possible. A variation on this is to use AE tactics and sing a twist such as DDD+CoD+largo+hymn whilst juggling instruments. At your current lvl (24) this approach is often more efficient than using crowd control.
<br />

<br />
Now let's move to the 3 mob situation. Here you have 3 main options. The first is to mez the 2 adds and throw in 1 or 2 extra songs when resist rates allow. I would not recommend trying to melee with this technique, your primary responsibility is to control.
<br />

<br />
The second method is to charm 1 add and have it attack the other add. The primary target is then moved away from the pet allowing the 2 adds to fight between themselves. You should then melee, the idea being to kill of the first target around the time the charm breaks, restoring the situation to the 2-mob situation above.
<br />

<br />
Finally you can still use AE tactics with you (the bard) tanking the additional 2 unless there is a spare tank in the group. Naturally the more adds you tank the more difficulty involved so it is nice to know you have a half-decent healer before you take this approach with 3+. However, it is surprising just how much AE dps a bard can output in this way.
<br />

<br />
A last tie up here between your 3 questions. To be able to use the AE approach successfully you need to reach a certain level of AC where a large portion of the mob's melee dps is mitigated. This is sometimes called the AC threshold and raises as you fight more difficult mobs.
<br />

<br />
That has a knock-on to question 2 in equipment choices. You have to be an AC bard to use these high aggro methods or you are simply taking too much dmg to make the technique worth it. Finally even if you are decked out in AC gear, if your Defence remains behind you will still be below the AC threshold. Defence is an absolutely key skill for any bard looking to have a high AC.
<br />

<br />
So to answer your equipment questions I have to return the question back to you. What do you want to be able to do with your bard? What is your intuition on how to handle the situation you described? And what is your overall style of play? It's in answering these questions that you can answer the central question on just what it is you want to spend your pp on.

				<td colspan="2"><span>As usual, lots of good advice from these folks.  I personally got my  Defense skill up by being the puller in most of my groups.  If you're pulling, at lower levels anyway, you will get hit, often, unless your MA is very good at grabbing agro as you enter the camp.  For weapon skills, you're DPS from melee is not tremendous, it never will be, so if you need to work on 1hb, put that mace in your main hand and put your 1hs in your off hand, I always put the weapon with the lowest associated skill in my main hand when in a group and in my secondary slot when soloing or when my dps was absolutely necessary.  You will eventually max out all of those skills.
<br />

<br />
Binding skills has been discussed so I won't go into that too much but I will remind you that your Sense Traps and Disarm Traps skills do NOT require the actual presence of a trap to get increases.  You can bind those skills to movement keys and then go swarm kiting and watch your skills max out quickly.
<br />

<br />
For equipment, I focues on Cha and Int when I was starting out, I soloed a lot and mobs rarely hit me so not missing notes and having a large mana pool were very important, more than the hp issue.  Now, I tend to group much more than I solo, I do lots of LDON's and lots of raiding and now AC and HP are king, I try to maintain and sometimes improve my current stats while always on the lookout for more hp, current goal is to have 100hp in every slot and I'm a little over halfway there, just shy of 4khp unbuffed and just over 1400AC, again unbuffed.  Not uber, but that's with NO elemental gear yet either.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Greetings Ashii -
<br />

<br />
I recently re-started my bard from level 22 and am now at 40, painlessly thanks to the fine folks here.  I would like to give you another option for binding your skills keys.  I have never used the macro key (it wasn't in-game when I took my break), so I found another way.  
<br />

<br />
Put your regular &quot;forage&quot; key in slot one on the ability menu.
<br />

<br />
Go into your social keys and scroll over to a blank one.  Right click one and name it (named mine Forage1) and assign a color to distinguish it from the regular forage key.
<br />

<br />
First line: &quot;/doability 1&quot;
<br />
Second line: &quot;/autoinventory&quot;
<br />

<br />
It may help to add a pause between the two because often the autoinventory is missed for me, but this makes it painless to forage.
<br />

<br />
Now, go into you keyboard options and assign forward movement to the &quot;w&quot; key and hotkey 10 to the &quot;w&quot; key.  Now, whichever button you put in slot 10 will activate everytime you move forward.  So, you can put in your sense trap, disarm, forage1, etc. and auto-skill.  
<br />

<br />
A word of advice when in ldon's:  use the forage1 skill in slot 10.  The items you forage in ldon's can be valuable and if you put sense traps, it will spin you around to look at the trap at inopportune times.  
<br />

<br />
The recently added ability to &quot;toggle target&quot; has helped me immensely with CC.  Coupled with &quot;cycle target&quot; you can always have anything targetted you wish with just a keystroke or two.
<br />

<br />
Also, consider using a gamepad for the hotkeys.  I hear several work, I use the Nostromo N52.  There are 14 hot-buttons on it that I use to control my 8 spells, 4 movement keys and targetting keys.  It has several other toys (like the ability to make any key repeat), as well as the ability to triple the uses for the hot-buttons.
<br />

<br />
This set-up works well for me and is highly customizable, maybe there is something here you can use.</span></td>

<br />
As far as defense, yes, very important as everyone else has said.  at level 24 you can get xp and raise it at the same time... paludal caverns, solo the fiends, they will be LB at level 24 i believe, so they won't thrash you, but will give you skill gains and xp, and happily as a bard their disease is of no concern, your regen song greatly overpowers it.  I solo'd the fiends until level 23 for decent xp (when I was bored and not grouped that is).  But I always had max defense, as i was a tank bard into my 50s.  I still tank for fun, but never in really tough places.
<br />

<br />
for stats... I started with all AC and str gear, it was cheap and since I was the main tank I felt str was important, I needed to hit the mobs a lot... now I regret my choice of str for all my starting points, but its ok.  There are probably even some old posts on this site where I argued for my choice, lol.  But in the end game you CAN max all your stats (I have not yet) so don't sweat it.  While you budget is small though, try and get decent AC while getting as much charisma as you can... a temperance costs 12pp, and lasts for quite a while, and give you 800 hps.  You would be hard pressed to buy 800hps worth of armor at an early level.  So get yourself some charisma, some dex, some AC, a temperance, and go kick butt.
<br />

<br />
lots of people already answered the question about mapping keys...  
<br />

<br />
And as for songs, I always twist haste, overhaste, regen, and an odd 4th song (usually either resists or more overhaste, but sometimes a levitate, or enduring breath, or a buff song, or something)  I also keep a lull, and a mez memmed, as well as at least one, if not 2 pulling songs. (2 because the requiem of time which is my normal pull song takes 18 seconds to reset, so if I mess up and double hit it when I didn't already have a song going I can switch to my other pull song without re-lulling everything <img src="/skins/default/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif" border="0" alt="Big Smile" hspace="2" /> )</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>1.  Pulling and Crowd Controlling for groups is how I kept my Defense maxed.  What others said about getting hit by blue conned mobs is correct.  AGI is the primary stat for Defense skillups, so get an AGI buff whenever you can.
<br />

<br />
Snare Fear kiting (see kiting guides) is the best way I know to improve offensive weapons skills when they are lagging.  Get a nice DEX buff before you head out if you can.  What Zel said about which one in which hand is 100% on (of course).
<br />

<br />
2.  Gear:  The leading cause of death in EQ is lack of HP.  CHA is great.  The only things that are PROVEN about CHA, however, is that lots of it appears to reduce missed notes, and we KNOW that when a Lull gets resisted, it checks your CHA to see if the mob will aggro.  
<br />

<br />
Besides that, there is NO EVIDENCE OR PROOF whatsoever that CHA has any affect on resist rates or early breaking of mez or charm.  What most certainly DOES affect whether they will break early, is the MR debuff component of the song.  A MR check happens every tick to determine if it will break early.  EQUIP A FLUTE TO MAXIMIZE THE MR DEBUFF.  There is NOTHING more important than this for making sure your mezzes and charms stick.  And, imo, this is MUCH easier than maxing your CHA.
<br />

<br />
3.  Song selection is all based on what others in the group are doing.  Depending on the mobs you are fighting, the priorites for me are:  Slow, Regular Haste, Overhaste, Damage Shield, Regen.  Against dragons and other nasty casters, resists are most important, of course.  Basically, if the Shammy or Chanter is Slowing (theirs are usually better than ours), let em.  Same goes with regular haste.  You won't get &quot;overhaste&quot; (the stackable kind) until your 50s.
<br />

<br />
I'm not sure if anyone already gave you a CC guide or not.  But this post is kinda long, and I need a cup of coffee, so I will leave that part go for now.
<br />

<br />
Short answer:  You can mez up to three adds.  You can mez two, and throw in a third buff song.  When you are down to one add, you can keep it mezzed, and /assist the main tank.  Your &quot;Toggle last two targets&quot; and &quot;Cycle nearest NPC&quot; keys are essential to pulling this off.</span></td>
