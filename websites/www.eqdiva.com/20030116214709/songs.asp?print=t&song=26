<b>Heaven forbid that I would forget this song! - </b>1/24/02 12:35:19 PM<br>~ <b>Devaney</b><blockquote>I routinely group with a cleric and rogue and we are a rather aggressive lot.  We tend to love non-stop pulling and fight a little close to spawn spots at times.  We have learned (the hard way) that Chain is one of the best songs to control a mob from running back to get reinforcments.  I constantly twist this song in my rotation to keep the mob from hitting so quickly and to &quot;chain&quot; it in place when it begins to run.  Mobs seldom resisit it and when they do, I simply break the cardinal rule of twisting (to keep going in your rotation) and recast the song.  Seldom does a mob resist it twice.<br><br>I love this song and on the few occassions I have forgotten to mem it, my cleric and rogues buddies glare at me in bewilderment.  The rogue loves the haste songs, the cleric is a mana song addict...and they BOTH scream for chain.  <br><br>Such devoted fans I have!!<br><br>Devaney<br>Bard of the 41st Song</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Key to soloing - </b>1/16/02 1:04:15 PM<br>~ <b>Steppy</b><blockquote>Soloing for bards means charm-kiting, fear-kiting, or dot-kiting.  In any case, this song is essential to success.  The snare effect is fundamental to making this sort of fighting work.  This WILL block a snare spell from taking hold, however so be careful in a group to coordinate with the group's snarers.  It does NOT stack with Largo's.  However, in a group with other snarers around, Largo's is probably the safer choice to avoid messing them up.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Snaring Runners to save mana; Stacking issues - </b>1/14/02 1:44:08 PM<br>~ <b>Klapton</b><blockquote>I don't know if this stacks with root or Druid snares.  It should not be an issue if you inform your group that you will be snaring runners.  The only other time for rooting is an emergency get-the-mob-off-the-cleric type situation, in which case a true caster's root spell is best.<br><br>To snare runners, watch the targets health bar.  Depending on how quickly your group is taking them down, you may need to fire the song off sooner.  If you do it a little early, no harm is done, you miss one other song twist in that cycle, and can sing it again so it sticks.<br><br>Also regarding timing:  If the mobs are resistant, sing the song a tick or two earlier than you think you need to.  That way you can fire it off again if it resists, and usually you can stop the runner.<br><br>p.s:  If you are using AE songs especially, tell your druid that with the mana he saves not having to snare runners, he can cast a damage shield on you when you get multiples.  (Every mob except the one the tank is hacking will most likely be whomping on you!  Dmg shields are 100% non-resistable damage--gotta love it).<br><br>Klapton, lvl 25, Vaezelle</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Stacking - </b>12/26/01 7:29:48 PM<br>~ <b>Musicman</b><blockquote>If this song is on a mob, snare/ensnare will not take.  It no longer breaks snare/ensnare, if it is on the mob.  Therefore, if grouped with a Druid wait until after the mob is snared and then weave it in to the mix for the slow effect.<br><br><br>Musicman 42 Level bard</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>mana - </b>12/12/01 11:45:51 PM<br>~ <b>sweetmelody psalmist</b><blockquote>I was wondering if this song normaly costs mana. my mana bar went down for the firts time since i started my bard. so do i need to med for this song?</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Great to solo - </b>11/18/01 2:35:37 PM<br>~ <b>Thylarion Wintersong</b><blockquote>I don't know if it's right but you gus can try it. Twist this song with the level 26 Song and you can solo reds, don't use this in Dungeons or other areas where you get much adds, a good zone to solo is Overthere (go to oasis to the docks wait for the boat and go by boat to Timorous Deep, there you must go to the Ogre city to the docks and wait for the ship, with this ship u come to OT but you must jump off the ship and swim to the beach INSIDE the outpost but be careful, u can be bound there even when you are KOS, but only at the left end of the wall inside)</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Doesn't stack - </b>11/7/01 8:40:06 PM<br>~ <b>Sinahi</b><blockquote>No, it doesn't stack with the AE slow.<br><br><i>Edited by: Kocho</i></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>Twisting Debuffs - </b>5/24/01 10:23:18 AM<br>~ <b></b><blockquote>I frequently party with a warrior friend and have been twisting Anthem (10) Largo (20) and Chain (23).  Do the effects of Largos and the Chain stack?  They seem to work well together, but if the effects cancel each other out I would rather twist in more area damage.  Anyone who could help me out here I would really be greatful.<br><br>Antonin Dvorak, level 23 bard  </blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Necro Darkness - </b>5/17/01 1:34:10 AM<br>~ <b>Reidian</b><blockquote>Snare and Ensnare may now work but I believe that this song still dispells Necro Darkness lines. I was partnered with a Necro in Lake of Ill Omen when she noticed her snares breaking fairly quickly. We did some tests and satisfied me that it does indeed appear to overwrite them. I'll leave ingame feedback about it on the other chance that this was overlooked when the song was changed. Anyone else have a different experience?</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>One of our staple songs - </b>5/11/01 4:59:43 PM<br>~ <b>Kaearia</b><blockquote>This song augments our role as jack-of-all-trades.  When you get this song, you can reasonably substitude for a snarer and a slower.<br><br>The slow is the same as our level 20 and 51 slows.  It starts off modestly at about 20% (attacks take 1.25x as long), but in the upper 30s jumps to about 30% (attacks take 1.43x as long).<br><br>The snare component is the best we get (51's movement slowdown is weaker, 54's equals it if you use a lute).  It too starts off fairly modest, but jumps in effectiveness somewhere in the upper 30s.  So if you're deliberately trying to slow down mobs (e.g. to ditch extra mobs while pulling outdoors), 23 is a better choice than 51.<br><br>The song now stacks correctly with the Snare and Ensnare spells, so you can keep this song on the mob to slow them even after they've been snared.<br><br>The song's duration is random.  Usually it'll last the full two ticks (about 12-18 seconds).  But sometimes it'll wear off early.  If you have a snarer in the group, you should rely on the Snare spell as your primary means of runner control and use this song only as a backup.<br><br>Another use is escaping from trains indoors, where Accelerando doesn't work.  As you run to the zone, hit esc.  That'll clear your target.  When a mob hits you, it gets automatically selected as your target.  Hit it with Chain and hit esc again.  Repeat.  As you slow the mobs to a crawl, you will outrun them and should be able to reach the zone relatively unmolested.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>snare song - </b>5/7/01 7:38:47 PM<br>~ <b>Trancintekno</b><blockquote>do u need to keep this song playing?<br>or does this work like the faction song where u play it once and it lasts for a certain amount of time?<br><br><i>Kocho~ Nope, its treated like a normal song, so you must twist it in every now and then to keep it going.</i></blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Selo's CC = Snare? - </b>5/4/01 6:07:56 AM<br>~ <b>Nosferatu</b><blockquote>Sure sounds like snare to me.  If so, as snare is, this spell will always be memmed!</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Should be good for kiting - </b>4/17/01 9:55:45 PM<br>~ <b>Sarais</b><blockquote>I don't have this song but shure can't wait to get it and try some things out. I would think it would be good for kiting those criters that run as fast as you do normally without selo's going. Just mix this song with DD and Belos and stay far enough away while beating your opponant down to nothing.  Worth a try on some things he he. <br><br>Course if the thing runs faster then you then this isn't going to work unless you are running with selo's going mixing this with dd only, may want to juggle inst too while trying this to get best effect.  <br><br>I myself havn't been having much luck kiting as it is but I will keep trying to see if I can get it down.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
