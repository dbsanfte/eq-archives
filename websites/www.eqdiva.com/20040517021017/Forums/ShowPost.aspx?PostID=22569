				<td colspan="2"><span>I found this post on Allakhazam's  The original link is <a target="_new" href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/zones.html?zstrat=89">here</a> but this is the interesting bit.  I thought it was useful for those of us who have never been to Old Sebilis.
<br />

<br />
From Gulag at Allakhazam's:
<br />

<br />
With PoP, the only reason for us to want to go to OS now is cash loot and 60 spell drops. However, for the lower 50s who may find it hard to get PoP groups, its still a good place to exp and excellent loot. 
<br />

<br />
Before you venture into OS, you will need to do 2 things. First, print off maps of Trakanon, Emerald Jungle and OS from Eqatlas. Then, get your key if you don't already have it. To get your key you need to kill 2 froggys in Trakanon, (I cant remember their names) and hand the medallions that they drop to the Emperor Granak or something like that. 
<br />

<br />
Ok, so you got your maps and your key. Head to the ruins and find the ramp leading down to OS. You will see a orange  globe in a big room. If you are planning to camp here for a long time, I would recommend that casters bind here. Pick up the key and click it on the globe. 
<br />

<br />
Zone In 
<br />

<br />
OS, unlike KC or velks, has a separate zone out which you will see from the map i.e. no trains! You will sometimes see people fighting mobs at zone in, but these are ones which they have pulled from further in. Normally, people will not pull to zone in unless they are confident of killing the frogs without assistance, so don't be alarmed. No frogys spawn at the immediate entrance, so you are safe to buff up and find yourself a group. Ahead of you is a ramp leading down to a long straight corridor. Along this corridor are 3 pairs of frogs. To get to these camps they will need to be killed. Brief note on the types of frogs in OS. Knights are melee types, can hit hard so slow is nice. Wizards and shamans like to cast lots, so MR is definitely a good thing. Always make sure you and your group are buffed up with MR at all times. Shamans also like to gate when low on hp, so warriors please save bash button when they are getting low and only bash when they cast gate spell. Clerics and enchanters should also have a stun spell loaded if possible. One other type of froggy which is found in the deeper camps are enchanters. They will tash, mez slow and gravity flux you but tend to be weaker than any of the others so die quite quickly. 
<br />

<br />
Inevitably, unless you can start up a balanced group at zone in, you will be asked to join an existing group inside the dungeon. What I often do is to just start up a temporary group with whoever is at zone in just to kill the spawns in the first corridor and then disband once you are past them. 
<br />

<br />
Once they are killed, proceed along the corridor and you will come to a door. Behind the door are 2 more frogys so watch out. 
<br />

<br />
B1 camp 
<br />

<br />
Past the door the tunnel takes a sharp right and then opens up to a large hall, which is surrounded by a moat. There are 3 separate bridges over this moat leading to other tunnels. The first bridge you see is known as B1 (bridge one). Over the bridge is where the B1 camp. This is probably the least popular camp as there are limited spawns nearby. More often, it serves as a waypoint for people to gather to head down the tunnel to the bar/chef and necro jail camps. It is also a safe place to camp/med as you won't get aggroed here. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Zone out 
<br />
If you don't cross the B1 bridge but bear further on to your left, you will see a second bridge on your right leading to an open area with a tunnel further on. This open area is the necro camp (more of which later). On your left, you will see what looks like a main entrance. This is the exit to zone out. Be warned, to actually get to the zone out portal, you have to run inside, along a corridor and open 2 sets of doors before you hit the zone portal, which ports you out automatically. Along the way you will pass 2 frog spawns, 3 golems and 2 more frogs at the portal itself. Sometimes, you will be lucky and people will be camping Zone out but not always. I have run it before with my warrior and never died but casters please watch out. Whatever you do, don't stop, just run and try and be at full hp/buffed with ac/hp before you do it. Tip - if you are running out with your group, hang back and let the melee types go in first, as they will get aggroed and beat on, saving you a beating in the process. 
<br />

<br />
Necro Camp 
<br />

<br />
Ok about the necro camp. This is one of the more popular camps in the zone, because its easy to hold, has plentiful spawns and has good loot. Its called the necro camp because you are camping the necrosis scarab which spawns just further along the tunnel. The scarabs always drop gems and this is where I have got all my Blue diamons and diamonds from. The necrosis scarab drops some armour stuff. Also, at the bottom of the tunnel is the entrance to another camp, called the crypt. In front of the crypt are some more froggys and a sebilite golem, who drops the lamentation. You will know when he is going to drop it because you will see him holding it. Necro is a safe camp, and can be held by a reasonably balanced group. 
<br />

<br />
B3 camp 
<br />

<br />
Ok if you are back at the main hall area and standing in front of zone out entrance facing bridge to necro camp, to your left will be the final bridge over the moat, called B3. Past the bridge is where the B3 camp normally is. The tunnel past the bridge leads to another deeper camp called discos, more of which later. At the B3 camp, people will pull mobs from zone out and from further down the tunnel. B3 is another popular camp due to plentiful spawns in the area, but loot is not as good as necro. A good enchanter is also more important here, as multiple spawns/pulls are more common. There are also spawns right near the camp too, so you can expect on occassions to deal with up to 4/5 mobs. 
<br />
Disco Camp 
<br />

<br />
To get to disco camp you go to the end of the tunnel past B3 and through the doors at the main entrance. Its called disco because the main hall inside has a glowing ceiling. Normally, you will camp inside a room just to the right of the main hall. This is a more dedicated camp. Adds here are common and a balanced group is a necessity. If you do find yourself here then its a nice place, with good potential for loot. Things like the froglok bonecasters robe drop here. You can also camp in the first main hall that you see. To pull, you need to go through the doors at the end of the hall. This leads you further in. There are rooms on the left and right that you can pull from. The room on the left, you will see a library. At the back is a false wall which leads through to a tunnel and you can go through there to pull stuff as well. 
<br />

<br />
Necro Jail camp 
<br />

<br />
Ok to get to necro jail camp you need to cross bridge at B1 and proceed down the tunnel. The tunnel will then open out and you will see a main entrance on your left. Just inside this is the necro jail camp. It called necro jail because inside, you will pull from the jail necromancer lizards. Also inside the jail are a scarab and 2 frog spawns. Its safe to stay inside the entrance as you wont get aggroed. There are regular spawns outside the main entrance too. When you get inside, you will see a corridor past a jail gate. Along the corridor are 4 cells, inside each is a necro. Past the corridor down some steps is a small room where the scarab and 2 froggy spawn. When you pull the necro, you will normally get one other to add, not all 4. It is possible to do this camp without an ench, as long as you have decent tanks. This is another good camp and it&amp;#8217;s a bit more regular and quieter than the other camps. 
<br />

<br />
Bar chef 
<br />

<br />
If you proceed further along the tunnel past the necro jail, you will come to the entrance to bar/chef, named for the froggy bartender inside. This is a large camp. There is an entrance to your left and one straight ahead. If you take the one straight ahead, go through the doors you will find yourself in a tunnel. If you go left, you will be in the froggy bartender camp room. Go to the right and immediately on your left you will see a large open room with a dining table. THis is your camp spot. You can pull through the doors at the end of the room. Be careful there are 5 spawns there. Also at the top of the stairs to the right and left are further rooms you can pull from. There are also static spawnsin the dining room too. Need a good ench here as adds are common. 
<br />

<br />
Crypt 
<br />

<br />
The crypt is the camp at the bottom of the tunnel past necro camp. You will need a rogue to lockpick to get inside. The experience here is pretty good. When you get inside, there are 2/3 static spawns you have to clear. Some of the mobs have pets. Go down the ramp and head to the left. You will come to a open up area. Turn right, go down the ramp and you will come to another room. On your right is a small room with mobs. Dont have to pull these. On your left is a set of stairs going down to a main hall. Inside the main hall are 2 static golems and 4 rooms, 2 on each side of the hall. Inside each room is a PH for a named skelly which drops nice stuff like hiero cloak etc. 
<br />
The golem can be mezzed so mez on fight the other. IF you dont have a mezzer, make sure you pull one golem outside the hall and not in Line of sigh of the other as they can CH. MAke sure you stun them at low health or else they will CH. 
<br />
To camp crypt properly, you have to do it in a cycle. Kill the 2 golems, then the 4 spawns in rooms. Then head outside the door on the otherside of the hall. TUrn left outside the door and bear right. YOu will then see 2 skelly guards outside a door. This is the door to emperor. Pull the guards and go inside. Inside is a single PH spawn on top of a coffin ina room. He is PH for Blood of Chottal. Once you kill him, make sure you have enough mana. Also you need a lvl 60 to single pull. Open up the next door you will see either the emperor or his PH in the middle of the room with 4 guards on the walls. Emperor can be single pulled. 
<br />
When you pull him keep him to the side of the wall and kill him quick. He drops nice rare 60 spells like malo etc. 
<br />
Once you kill emperor, you will have enough time to go back to the main hall and then the crypt guardians should spawn again.l Kill them, the 4 spawns, hten back to blood of chottal and emperor. rinse repeat as long as you can. 
<br />

<br />
Other tips 
<br />

<br />
A few words of warning, be careful when crossing bridges, they are slippery. Also, stay well clear of the moats and don't fall in. If you do, stay put, invis /hide if you can and get a summon or port out as soon as possible. More than likely you may be killed by wondering mobs. Dont get your group to follow you down either. The only other way out is to go deep inside the second level where there is a zone out. Not recommended, as certain death unless you actually mean to venture into the 2nd level with a good group. 
<br />

<br />
For your information, 2nd level is where the king spawns (he who drops the fungi tunic). It is also the home of the resident dragon trakanon. I have done the king camp once, with a 60 cleric, 60 enchanter, 57 rogue, 58 shaman and me (55 warrior). Unless you can get a similar group, I would not try it. The mobs here hit v hard and long. If you can do it, you can camp the king reasonably safely. In the room where the king spawns there are a couple of other pops (look like human mushrooms). If possible, you have to keep one mob in the room at all times so the king doesnt run outside. The respawn time on the king is about 25 mins. He was yellow to me at 55. 
<br />

<br />
Nowadays OS is quite empty so if you want to besure of a group bring your own. 
<br />

<br />
Warriors: Always needed. But would not come here until about 52/53 otherwise hard to get a group. 
<br />
Rangers: one of the zones where you are always popular because of snare. 
<br />
Druids: also popular in this zone, because of snare and evac. 
<br />
Clerics,enchs and shamans: needless to say, you will always be welcome. 
<br />
Monks: Not really necessary for b1.b3, necro jail camp but popular for disco, crypt and bar chef. 
<br />
Rogues: indispensible for crypt because of lockpick. 
<br />

<br />
Finally, if at the end of the day you are planning to camp, dont head out to zone in/trakanon if you can. Instead, I would advise you to camp out in the main hall area, either at necro or B1, so that when you log back on, you dont have to fight your way through the mobs at the main entrance. 
<br />

<br />
Well, thats about it. Just to let you know how good this place has been to me, I have camped it for about 8 times in the past few weeks (normally between 2-4 hours each time) and in that time I have won :- 
<br />

<br />
In the time i used to camp at OS i could make easily 1kpp a night. Often more. Always lots of cash loot weapon and armour drops and once in a while you will get a nice item. I won malo in crypt. All in all i must have made about 60-70kpp hunting in OS for a few levels.
