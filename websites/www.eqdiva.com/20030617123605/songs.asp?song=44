<b> - </b>7/6/02 10:47:20 PM<br>~ <b>Shinkceb</b><blockquote>This song still has some bugs in it.  The most obvious one is that it causes a monk's Tiger Claw skill to go up even if he isn't using it.  Also, I suspect it has some issues with people using Primal weapons.  I don't have a good way to test it, but when I group with my brother fights tend to be MUCH harder when I use this song than when I don't use it.  Nothing else different, just MOBs seem to hit more often and harder when I use this song.<br><br>Tried it with other people and I really don't notice a difference, with the only thing I can figure out is that it's not playing properly with the Avatar proc.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>possibly on purpose? - </b>2/10/02 8:09:57 AM<br>~ <b>alig</b><blockquote>I too have reported the bug repeatedly - and I'm beginning to suspect that the bug is left there on purpose to nerf the song's possibilities... I rarely play Katta's except under the following circumstances:  If i'm the only haste-capable buffer in the group and there are 3 or more damage dealers of the strong-but-slow type.  It's even better if the meatshields have dual wield and/or weapons that proc.  Then I'll twist Katta with haste and chant of battle, and snare as necessary or as pingtime allows.  To avoid the proc, I equip my drum (or my Flawless Ivory Horn and my stein) and set up my assist hotkeys so that attack gets toggled off if I assist at all.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>what's the point? - </b>2/4/02 12:26:01 PM<br>~ <b>Lanorolen Tunetwister</b><blockquote>You know, bugs aside, I just can't see the point of this song.  I mean, did DEX suddenly become a useful stat and I didn't notice?  Ok, fizzle rates on songs are a little bit lower.  Not worth giving up another song I'm twisting for.  Proc rates are very slightly higher - if you happen to have a weapon that procs (I don't), and you learn weapon skillsa little bit faster if you're have trouble maxing them, but other than that why bother?  It's not like DEX affects your chance to hit or dodge or anything like that.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>

<b>RE: spells that make us proc - </b>12/30/01 4:17:10 PM<br>~ <b>Qeynestri</b><blockquote>I too have had my songs lock up when boon was casted on me - however, I was unable to notice if it was due to a proc.  What seems like a more likely, although rather iffy, explanation is that it has to do with dexterity bonuses.  I recently had boon casted on me in CS and my songs did not lock for the short duration of battle it took to kill the two wyverns.  I also had two illusions casted over it so I wouldn't look like a werewolf(which might explain it but I don't think so).  The icon is still active whether or not you look like werewolf when boon is casted so any bonuses from the spell will still apply.<br><br>Getting back to the main point - I notice that my songs will lock when two dex bonuses are applied - example: boon and Chant of Battle, boon and Katta's, Katta's and Chant of Battle.  So, two dex bonuses plus proc = song lock?  I'm not completely sure and I don't EVER want to test it cuz it's more annoying than dying and can very easily cause death.  In any case, my songs have locked when 1)I had boon casted on me and I was twisting Chant of Battle and 2)Katta's was being sung by another bard in group and I was singing Chant of Battle.  In case 2, her songs locked after she proc'd on Katta's and mine did not.  Only until I proc'd did my songs lock and ONLY when Chant of Battle was being twisted.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
