<b>Kazumi's Note of Preservation - </b>9/9/02 12:49:04 PM<br>~ <b>Magnolina</b><blockquote>Wondering if defensive skills can go up with this song, im almost to level 60.  As us bards know dodge parry and defense are hardish skills to raise.  Right now to get them to go up is ive been training 30ish+ mobs in skyfire, then lining them up and using deftdance for 18 seconds to see if i can get a few points in those 3 skills.  If this can up your defense skills, this would be a much faster route.  Not sure on the re-use time on this song, says 3 seconds, but i have hear 10 mins and other things.  Anything is faster then 66 mins though... anyone know if skills do go up with this song though?</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>AE - </b>8/17/02 11:36:33 AM<br>~ <b>Susperia</b><blockquote>as far as an escape tool this song isnt all its cracked up to be, in most cases where im in a dangerious place i have an evacer in my group. the best use of this song i have found is in AE groups in sebilis. i usually get dragged along to play AE mana, MR debuff, and some DOT's....as to well as to be the puller seeing how me and the cleric are the only other armor classes in the group. for those who dont know what AE is, its when you pull about 30 mobs to a camp while chanters continually cast stun and then wizards burn em down all at once with AE damage spells. on the very long pulls its really easy to get stunned and killed with 10+ mobs on your back. i usually play this song at the farthest past of my pull and it seems to always run out just as i get in range of the cleric.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Will interupt spells....be cautious. - </b>7/20/02 2:15:07 PM<br>~ <b>Abard</b><blockquote>Whenever anyone in your group is casting a spell and you play this song, their spell will be interupted. This includes the evac/teleport type spells.<br><br>I know because I have tried once during an evac from a bad pull.... <br>Needless to say we didn't make it through.<br><br>A word to the wise though, in that type of situation, use any of our 2 ae fear songs. It will save a lot more lives, providing the monsters your group is trying to get away from can even be feared...</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b> - </b>7/20/02 2:06:42 PM<br>~ <b>Abard</b><blockquote>When anyone in your group is casting a spell and you run this song, their spell will be interupted because you cannot cast while invulnerable. <br>This is for all spells, even the teleportation ones. I know I have tried it one time during an evac..... <br>needless to say, we didn't make it. <br><br>Word to the wise, you are far better off using any of the 2 ae fears we get in that kind of a situation providing the monsters you are trying to get away from can be feared.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Not 18 seconds - </b>7/16/02 12:08:41 PM<br>~ <b>Larrycor</b><blockquote>This does not last for 18 seconds.<br>I tested with both with and without an instrument.<br>instruments don't add time to it. <br><br>It lasts for only 11 seconds.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Ghetto TL... - </b>12/31/01 12:14:20 AM<br>~ <b>Eiluvas Elderoak</b><blockquote>All ya need to do is after the druid casts port spell. click this one into effect. the bard then clicks it off and as long as everyone else keeps it on. the people with DA effect will stay and people without it will be TL'd to where the group port spell went. Thanks to Pinene who let me in on it =)</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Tanks click off - </b>12/6/01 8:41:49 AM<br>~ <b>sizmic blazinfeet</b><blockquote>Was Wondering if I fire this song up, then have tank klick off the effect (if possible). what I mean is can he click off to regain the aggro?</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Can it be twisted - </b>11/30/01 10:52:18 AM<br>~ <b>Dinian Arkatt</b><blockquote>K im just wondering if it is possible to twist this song, persay. IE can a bard equip the wind instrument, fire up this song, then click of the icon and start playing selos song of travel so not only does the group have Immunity to all damage but also the speed bonus to hopefully get them farther away from the mob? Or does this song prevent ALL spells from sticking to the target including heals and buffs? Just curios, and thanks fer answering as soon as possible!<br><br>Dinian Arkatt<br>Bard of the 32'nd Melody<br>Defender of the Faith<br>Saryryn</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>If the 2min is true.. - </b>11/13/01 9:47:22 AM<br>~ <b>Nolus</b><blockquote>Then the delay time on the song needs to  change from 3 sec to 2min (and whatever 2nd).</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Recase Time is 3 minutes - </b>11/10/01 6:52:11 PM<br>~ <b>Whispen</b><blockquote>You cannot use this song to stay invulnerable indefinitely.  After the 18 seconds of invulnerability wear off you have a good 2mins and 42 seconds to wait before you can do it again.<br><br>However it is extremely useful when used correctly and I keep it memorized 100% of the time.<br><br>Whispen Woesong<br>Xevian Virtuoso</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Endless - </b>10/30/01 11:36:03 AM<br>~ <b>Swarmcaller</b><blockquote>Can this song be played indefinentaly?  Can you be DA as long as you play it or what?  Would be the best way to get corpses i think.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>? - </b>10/10/01 6:24:37 PM<br>~ <b>Gudeldar</b><blockquote>Does DA stay up as long as you play it or does it have a long pulse time and it wears off before it pulses again.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Aggro Control with Ease - </b>9/25/01 6:40:04 AM<br>~ <b>Whispen</b><blockquote>What's often overlooked is once you're invulnerable you drop to the bottom of the aggro list until it wears off.  However, you can CLICK the effect off at will.<br><br>Mob beating on your cleric?  No problem just invuln the group and the warrior clicks the effect off and becomes the only attractive target.  Once mob has had a few seconds to get really mad at the warrior the cleric can click effect off and start healing.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Think of it this way - </b>8/29/01 1:41:06 AM<br>~ <b>Prymal Rage</b><blockquote>The warriors run up to the dragon, shoot it or whatever to pull it, while the bard is close by, and after the arrows have been loosed, then you play the song, for the 3 tick invuln, and pull back as needed... just think of it this way</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Usefull - </b>7/26/01 6:29:24 PM<br>~ <b>Examer</b><blockquote>This song is very usefull on mobs that you need to position not to make them gate and so on. DA all the warriors, let them run inside and pull mob to where we wanna fight it. Have all warrriors there ready to attack when DA breaks and casters and healers move in. Usually this is done by a necro with DA (usually necro dies to) but necros are more usefull feeding the casters mana this way.</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>DA - </b>6/18/01 3:41:34 PM<br>~ <b>Bondrae</b><blockquote>Well, if this song is the same effect as the clerical DA then for those 18 seconds the tanks can't interact with the mobs (as far as I know) so you'd have to have some way to generate a huge volume of hate on someone REALLY quick to make it effective.<br><br>A better tactic might be (depending on the recyle time on this (the clerical version is 15 minutes) have a bard in each tank group. When one of your tanks gets agroed bring up DA and let them attack you to no avail, by the time DA is off, someone else should be being attacked and can pull up DA....  I dunno if it would be very effective (can you say long battle?)</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Doubt you could tank high end mobs.. - </b>6/16/01 4:17:33 PM<br>~ <b>Saijo Sweetsong</b><blockquote>Its been my understanding its hard for any tank to taunt a 60+ mob, so more than likely with the Warriors in that Bard's unable to attack, for them to be able to keep the taunting up enough =/</blockquote></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td>
<b>Use for tanking? - </b>6/15/01 2:29:59 PM<br>~ <b>Shilana</b><blockquote>would this song be useable to tank high level raid mobs? Perhaps if the tanks were all grouped with the bard (playing this song with a magic flute of some sort) , and they're taunting while the monks, rogues, rangers, etc all attack the MOB. Or would they outdamage the warriors too much to taunt, due to the fact that they aren't attacking (evade, jolt, and FD might help, not sure)? Just an idea that probably doesn't pan out though.
