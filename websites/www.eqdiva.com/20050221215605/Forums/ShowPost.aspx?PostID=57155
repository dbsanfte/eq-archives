				<td colspan="2"><span>I am a beta tester for WoW, and I've been one for several months now.
<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, there is no Bard class in WoW, and so I tried many of the classes to find one that I could enjoy.  I have tried the Warlock, Rogue, Druid, and Shaman classes.
<br />

<br />
I simply cannot enjoy WoW, and will not buy it when it is released.  I have posted probably upwards of 100 posts on the WoW boards in regards to the problems with the game, so it will be difficult to summarize in this one post, but I'll do my best.
<br />

<br />
- There are too few classes in WoW, and they overlap too much.  There are very few compelling spells/skills that only one class has.  For example, mages and rogues can both go invis; warriors, paladins, druids (!) and maybe others can tank; almost all casting classes have nukes (mages are best); shamans, druids, paladins, priests can heal.  There is just too much cross-over and a great lack of special abilities.  Cross-over of abilities can be alright, as long as there are several class-defining awe-inspiring abilities for each class -- there are very very few of these.
<br />

<br />
- There is little to look forward to in each class.  Once you get your basic spells/skills, you almost NEVER get new interesting skills at higher levels.  You only get upgraded versions of your current abilities.  For example, as a Shaman you get an instant-cast nuke, a DoT, a weapon buff, totems, and a heal.  You don't get something new and exciting at higher levels, you get level 2, 3, 4 nuke, 2, 3, 4 Dot, 2, 3, 4 weapon buff, 2, 3, 4, totems, 2, 3, 4, heals.  It's not like in EQ1 where you have some great new type of spells to look forward to.  What's worse, even though you get these more powerful versions of the same spells over and over, the monsters get more hp, so you may as well just have the same spell!  It grows stagnant.
<br />

<br />
- There is no extended character customization.  You cannot customize your facial features at all (you just choose a face), you cannot customize your size at all, no tattoos, nothing.  Lots of people are complaining about this problem.
<br />

<br />
- It is IMPOSSIBLE to own any equipment you could call &quot;uber&quot; at any level other than the max level.  *ALL* items either have a min-level or are soulbound (no-drop).  The min-levels are set such that at any given level (other than max level), you have only a handful of different gear choices, and they are all very similar in power.  Staggeringly similar in power!  For example, a very good staff for a level 15 will only be perhaps 5 dps better than a mediocre weapon.  It's not possible to awe people with your great gear.  Gear is inconsequential really.
<br />

<br />
- The questing system has potential, but lacks variety.  50% of all quests are &quot;gather X&quot; quests.  The rest are &quot;retrieve this item&quot; or &quot;kill this guy&quot; quests.  They could have done so much more with this.
<br />

<br />
I am tired of the game, and unless they make some major changes, I won't play it when it comes out.
<br />

<br />
EQ2 looks much more promising IMHO, I can't wait for it to be released.
<br />

				<td colspan="2"><span>I have been Beta testing for a few months as well and while you are free to your own opinion I have to disagree with most of your points.
<br />

<br />
There are significant differances between classes.  For instance the three Tank classes you mentioned, the Warrior builds rage as the fight goes along, which he can expend to do special maneuvers, plus he has three different stances which come with different abilities so he goes from being a defensive tank to DPS to a decent soloer.
<br />

<br />
The Paladin (probably the most boring class in combat) usually soften up his opponents with a quick crusaders strike and then lowers the boom with Holy Strike.  He can play with hate with his insta casting short duration seals, either increasing or decreasing hate on himself or others among othere things and then he has his auras, mana free boons that effect the entire party that he can only have one on at a time and range from mana regen to Armor boosts.
<br />

<br />
Then finally the druids bear from.  You can change into a friggin bear and tank.  You lose the ability to cast spells but gain the ability to get rage and expend it to use powers (that are different than the warriors)
<br />

<br />
If those aren't different abilities I am not sure what are.  There is more difference in characters than in EQ, perhaps what you are confusing here is that they are not as dependent on each other as EQ is.
<br />

<br />
Character customization is better than EQ (choosing face, skin tone, hair color, hair style and &quot;facial&quot; hair (which is jewelry and other things like tatoos as well)), but not as good as say City of Heroes.
<br />

<br />
As far as nothing to look forward to, yes it appears (to those that are impatient and post rather than read) that there is little to look forward to except increasing abilities of the same type.  However the developers have said they have every intention of adding new abilities as beta goes on, that they haven't gotten to it yet because they are trying to finish Hunters.  This is beta, not a finished product not everything has been implimented yet.
<br />

<br />
Lastly about &quot;uber&quot; equipment.  I think getting a double linked tunic (a rare item that drops off of a &quot;boss&quot; mobs) at level 31 is pretty d*mn uber.  The fact that there is better stuff out there that I will be unable to use for 8 or 10 levels means that I have to eventually upgrade my equipment.  That I need to go down to the bottom of another instanced dungeon with my friends and gather better equipment as we go.
<br />

<br />
I find the fact that I can have just as good equipment as someone who has a level 60 to be refreshing.  I find that when I kill a level 18 boss mob and get a piece of equipment that it is better to go WOW! and start using it than to think I wonder how much I can vendor this for.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I am sorry you are not enjoying the game and hope that maybe EQ2 will be a better fit for you

				<td colspan="2"><span>Praetor, at one point or another there is very standard gear in the EQ. All classes have their Elemental sets, and now GoD. The stats, focus effects, and damage/delay start to look all the same, varying only in combinations. Of course there are no distinguishable items in WoW sub-level cap...do you ever remember having uber_sword_06 at level 48 in EQ? I personally am not in the beta but have seen it in play; it seems like there is a much larger variety of things to do on WoW than what there is to do in EQ. Yet another point in WoW is that this is still in beta, and they still have not implemented the raid content. Unlike Sony, that pushes buggy content to almost an unplayable level (<a target="_new" href="http://fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=b5faf650e835f7fe7fcd8aaa063956a6&amp;threadid=12084">http://fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=b5faf650e835f7fe7fcd8aaa063956a6&amp;threadid=12084</a>), Blizzard is determined to release a high quality game with interesting content.

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">There are significant differances between classes.</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
As you went on to describe, the BASIC playstyle for each class is different (warriors build up rage over the course of multiple battles, rogues build up during a single battle, casters use mana), there is a lack of variety in the class-defining spells.  
<br />

<br />
Let me compare and contrast.  In Everquest, if you are a wizard, you start off with some low-level nukes, then you suddenly get to port, then you get Ice Comet (the first amazing nuke), and then you get to xloc, etc. etc.  You get all kinds of unique class abilities as you level up (bard is even more varied!).  In World of Warcraft, you get a few (indeed very unique) abilities at low level, but then you just get higher versions of these as you level up.  You have no new TYPES of abilities to look forward to.  You address this:
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">As far as nothing to look forward to, yes it appears (to those that are impatient and post rather than read) that there is little to look forward to except increasing abilities of the same type.</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
If they cannot put the major waypoints of power in the classes THIS LATE in beta, I have very very little hope for them to add them as &quot;tweaks&quot; later.  This is just bad design.  You can't put in boring stock spells for classes, and then suddenly change the whole design later.  Instead, it seems that their design philosophy is that all casters get a basic set of spells that power up over time -- rather than the EQ model where you always have many completely different spell types at higher levels to look forward to.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">Lastly about &quot;uber&quot; equipment. I think getting a double linked tunic (a rare item that drops off of a &quot;boss&quot; mobs) at level 31 is pretty d*mn uber.</span></blockquote>
<br />

<br />
What about before level 31?  That's already several weeks into the game, unless you're a hardcore player (&gt;2 hours a day).  For example, at level 14, there are only 2 or 3 staves I can use due to min level restrictions, and the very best one is only a few points better than the very worst one.  Even if you ignore THAT, it is also true that most items add very little to any stat (even the best items).  +4 stamina?  Oh that's amazing (and I can guarantee that that item won't add to any other stat).  5 armor instead of 4?  Woah, big upgrade.  I see this across the board with items in WoW, and several other people responded to a post I made in the WoW forums agreeing with me.
<br />

<br />
You seem to be in WoW-fanboy mode, and are unwilling to step back to see the amazing shortcomings of the game.  There is no arguing with someone that takes that stance.  I just hope that other readers of my thread will think twice before picking up WoW if they see any of the things I've mentioned as issues as things that would bother them.</span></td>

You are supposing that:
<br />

<br />
1) Everyone raids
<br />
2) Everyone only ever owns the very best armor set they have access to
<br />
3) We are only talking about maxxed level characters
<br />

<br />
When I am level 15 in Everquest, I can go to the bazaar, and if I save a whole lot of money, I can buy something that will make my groupmates say &quot;WOAH!  You have that sword?  Cool!&quot;  In WoW, this never happens at lower levels.  If you go to the auctioneers, you will find little or nothing for you if you are below level 30, and even if you do find things, there will be NOTHING that you would have to save for days or weeks for to afford because it is so great.
<br />

<br />
For example, if you pick up EQ, start a new warrior, and get to level 20 -- you can buy an FBSS in the Bazaar.  It might take some time to save up that 1k-2k to buy one, but it REALLY improves your play, and people envy it (back in the day).  There is no such possibility in WoW, unless you are already at max level.

				<td colspan="2"><span>You also have to keep in mind that it IS a 5 year old game and a very big majority of players are very high-end game oriented. There are only two newer servers where you can play with newer people, those being Stromm and Morden Rasp, but those are quickly tipping into higher level servers. I do realize there are casual gamers who aren't as raid-intensive as others, but they still DO raid. I'd say the average person farms the elemental planes for gear....quite a few servers have 4-5 Time capable guilds. I agree that you can buy decent gear at lower levels but in truth the large majority of the game IS raid content. Reaching level 65 (and 70 in OoW) is an accomplishment, yes, but you see oh so very many 65's compared to fresh players starting at level 1-10.

WoW is seeming very balanced from where I stand; there are progressive quests as you level, leading you to newer and harder places.

You don't get very good and unique, jaw dropping items at the beginning of any game (I.e. if you start EQ from the very beginning, having no items, no money, one cloth shirt, and your guild note, you go out to kill a bat and loot a rusty sword! You eventually find out that you can get a fine steel sword later on in Highkeep, and as you move along the level grinding path into the dreadlands and other exp zones, there still isn't much choice in what drops UNTIL you get near the level cap, 65 right now, and start doing lower end raid content when you can get droppable things, sell them, buy good items in the bazaar.)
<br />

<br />

<br />
Again, the game is in beta, the raid and higher end system isn't implemented yet, and eventually you DO get the level cap and your efforts will be recompensed with &quot;phat loots&quot; and such...
<br />

<br />
Your point of reference is one who has played until 64, gaining items visibly better than some fine steel sword, and going into a game where you are penniless, starting fresh without any twink cash to start with. At least there are a plethora of quests to choose from unlike EQI where the only quests you really start out with are the newbie item quests and the road to grinding until the epic quest later on.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>Some of the downsides you mentioned just MAY exist in eq2 as well; it remains to be seen.  
<br />

<br />
The Archetype system COULD make eq2 such that the differences between subclasses is not very noticable.  Hopefully, carefully choosing and limiting the &quot;crossover&quot; abilities of subclasses (like the Dirge's non-combat rez, for example) will make different subclasses more or less desirable for special encounters, or that certain combinations of subclasses work really cool together without making other combinations unworkable.
<br />

<br />
The level restrictions on gear in eq2 COULD make it impossible for anyone to have an exceptionally good item at lower levels.  (Eq2 promises that the Artisan &quot;mini-games&quot; will make tradeskilling much more fun than eq1, and that items will be VERY customizable, using something akin to LDoN Augments.  At least this should not be quite as bland as the first poster describes about WoW gear at this point.)
<br />

<br />
I'm very excited about these new games.  A couple of my students are playing WoW atm, and they are having a lot of fun.  I am WAY excited about eq2, and have been eagerly awaiting it for two years now, lol.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>You do not need to have a level 65 (or 64 in my case) in order to have great equipment at lower levels in EQ.  That is because there is a great meta-game, the economy.  The economy in WoW is almost non-existence unless you are maxed.  
<br />

<br />
For example, in EQ, suppose you've never played before.  You start a level 1 warrior.  You easily get up to level 5 in a day or less, and at that point you can collect silks and sell them in the bazaar for good money.  Now you have a few hundred pp, and you can do the buy-low sell-high in the bazaar for a week or so, and by the time you are level 15, you can easily have 1k or 2k, and buy something really great (for your level).
<br />

<br />
This same scenario is absolutely 100% impossible in WoW.  It's as if you're constantly doing newbie quests over and over again.  All the gear you get from quests is just merely adequate for the level you receive it at, and if you buy something at a shop (or if you're really lucky, at the auction), it will be just 1 or 2 points above whatever you quested.
<br />

The economy meta-game in EQ is important to me, and I think it's a lot of fun.  There is no such thing in WoW.</span></td>

What would you do if they decided to wipe the entire player database of characters and gear and plat, etc. and make it like day one?  I'd grumble a bit, but then I'd get right back into playing and have a dang good time knowing that I have a chance, and BRONZE armor will be worth something again!

<br />
You make the above statement as if it's a bad thing.  It's all a matter of perspective.  Level 15 warriors shouldn't be able to &quot;awe people with [their] great gear&quot; that would've taken a level 50 warrior with the assistance of well-balanced group to acquire without buying it.  
<br />

<br />
I firmly believe the first twinks and PLers were the ones that started the downturn in the quality of EQ, as people discovered ways to &quot;beat the system&quot; and level their toons at ridiculous speeds, without acquiring their gear themselves, and &quot;paying their dues.&quot;  People stopped being interested in experiencing the content in Norrath, concentrating only on leveling faster than the next guy...having better gear than the next guy...being able &quot;to awe people with [their] great gear.&quot;  
<br />

<br />
...and, once it became obvious that people were losing their interest in participating in the Norrath content, it was easy for the devs to justify not creating any <b><i>new</i></b> content, and just phoning it in with new expansions tailored toward the hard-core raiders.
<br />

<br />
Put me down as a &quot;yes&quot; vote.  It <b><i>should</i></b> be damned near impossible to have uber gear, if you're not an uber-level toon.

<br />
I think, more than anything else, this right here points out why WoW will fail, and what made Everquest succeed.  Class Inter-dependecy.  Most people don't log onto a MMO just so they can solo all the time, that's what console RPG's are for.  The log onto them to be around other people, to group with them and hunt with them.  
<br />

<br />
By making all classes pretty much entirely self-reliant, you wipe out the game-reasons behind classes grouping up together to become stronger.  
<br />

<br />
Everquest, as it is today, is actually a really bad example for a &quot;successful&quot; game.  The fact is the games been running on fumes for the past several years, previous success and addiction to the game has kept it going alot more than the poorly designed expansions and changes have.
<br />

<br />
Everquest, as it was originally released and for the first couple expansions however, was what got everyone so hooked in the first place.  Compare that Everquest to WoW and you see where WoW is gonna fail so horrably.  EQ2, being designed by essentially the same company that eventually ruined EQ1(Sony) looks iffy at best.  But that at least is still up in the air.
<br />

<br />
The funny thing about EQ1 is it was all the &quot;mistakes&quot; that Verant made that made it such a wonderful game.  All those things that SoE has been &quot;correcting&quot;, essentially from people whining about one thing or another, has pretty well drained real joy away that the game used to have.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span>I see lots of replies along the lines of &quot;we hate the ability to twink, so we're glad it's not possible in WoW.&quot;  Okay, I hear you.  And Blizzard heard you, and that's why they have the system they have.  It 100% destroys the ability to twink, and lots of people think that's a great idea.
<br />

<br />
At first, I did too.
<br />

<br />
But look at the ramifications.  Right now in EQ, you always have something new and great you can save for, no matter what level you are.  In WoW, you HAVE NO CHOICE but to take what is given to you via the quests for your current level (you can't even attempt quests meant for higher level people).  You MUST accept what gear they think is appropriate for your level.  This simplifies and abstracts gear to a point where it's almost a non-issue throughout the game.  I'm a fervent gear-collector, and I LOVE to dream of the next great item I can acquire.  In WoW, you never dream, because you know exactly what's coming up -- everyone else has the same thing, or something very comparable.
<br />

<br />
And this is all just to avoid some hardcore gamers from creating low-level toons with great gear?  I don't care if they do that, it doesn't bother me, it doesn't affect MY game at all.  I just want something to look forward to equipment-wise, and WoW doesn't allow that.

				<td colspan="2"><span>I think twinking does very much affect the game, Praetor. When I started playing EQ, there were plenty of level 60's about and the simple fact was that groups would often prefer to get a knowledgable, well-equipped twink than a new player learning with them.
<br />

<br />
The class inter-dependence issue is also important. Have you forgotten what it used to be like when certain classes couldn't get a group, and people were unwilling to try out non-standard cleric-tank-chanter groups? A lot of the special abilities/spells introduced as you go up the levels in EQ were quite obviously put in as tweaks to make certain classes more attractive to groups, not brilliant design concepts. 
<br />

<br />
I'd actually expect them to test the way this works in beta then add the right abilities for fun, balance and group utility, rather than fixing it down the line, after we've complained for a few months of live play with special spells and abilities that didn't work.
<br />

<br />
I still don't know which one I'll play though.

				<td colspan="2"><span>Don't know much about WoW, but I definately have some thoughts about bland items and spells. 
<br />

<br />
I played Horizons for 2 months and I can tell you flat out that the bland scaling of items and spells was plain rediculous.  Boring and uninspiring.  The only difference between a 20 monk and a 100 monk was that he had a linear scaling of equipment.  You could plug in a X = ?Y formula and get about 90% accurate on all upgrades.
<br />

<br />
I'm a pattern kinda guy and the patterns of spells and horizons was rediculously simple.  No major jumps, nothing significant, just simple, linear scaled progress.  
<br />

<br />
I think the asynchronous changes in EQ are part of what makes it interesting.  Sure, some things scale linearly, but some things don't.  Some of that happened as part of a balancing process over the years, rather than brilliant forsight, but it still makes a beautiful non-linear progression of characters.  
<br />

<br />
Take clerics.  Clerics start out with basic heals, just like other healers (though earlier).  Then, at 39 a huge thing changes.  Complete heal.  Now, complete heal is broken, but it doesn't change the fact that all of a sudden the character changes.  Then, somewhere along the way, they pick up their first heal over times.  Then, up in the high 50's, they get their proccing hammers, which adds a completely different dimension to their character. 
<br />

<br />
Bards.  Bards start with some very basic, uninteresting songs.  But, then, they get 39 charm.  And, somewhere along the way, they pick up some good mezzes (now at 17, but it didn't used to be there).  And Invis happens at like 21...  And, in the 60's the spell sets change drastically, making haste and overhaste and such.  At 55 and 65, you get MR debuffs that you didn't have before.  And, eventually, you get your 52% 1 min slow.  
<br />

<br />
The overall effect is that your character changes.  The skills you get, the songs you play makes your character FEEL different.  The way I play my bard now is NOTHING AT ALL like I played my bard at 25.  NOTHING.  Or at 45.  Or even at 55.  It's 100% completely different and barely resembles what I used to do. 
<br />

<br />
Balanced or not, that makes the game interesting.   I have no idea if WoW or EQ2 will pull that off, but I can definately point to Horizons and show you what failure looks like.

				<td colspan="2"><span>EQOA was quite the same way. Linear development with linear equipment. But they also had quests that gained equipment beyond the normal upgrade pattern(A sort of life long epic, so to speak) and they also incorporated a random drop system where all mobs had a chance to drop a rare item from a treasure class appropriate to their level/location. This made equipment progression very exciting.
<br />

<br />
I had thought, from reading the FAQ and some previews on WoW, that blizzard had done similar things. A basic linear progression in general upgrade with a randomized chance at getting good stuff you'd wear over the next 2-3 upgrades or until you find/quest better.
<br />

<br />
If you think about how EQ started, the basic progression was cloth/patchwork -&gt; banded -&gt; bronze -&gt; fine steel.
<br />

<br />
Fast forward 5 years and now you have GoD mobs dropping stuff that could replace a full suit of fine steel all by itself.
<br />

<br />
I haven't played WoW but if its anything like the original poster described then it just lost a little flavor, for me anyway. But I don't think we can see the entire picture quite yet. While betaing EQOA up until release a LOT of the dungeons and named mobs had not been itemized yet.

<br />

<br />
That was going to be my point exactly.  In the very beginning of EQ, you would hunt for cloth, or pelts for patchwork.  Then save up all your money for banded, which was only marginally better than cloth/patchwork.  a few AC per peice better.  Then on to bronze, etc...  
<br />

<br />
You have to realize with a game that is 5 years old, of course equipment and stats are going to be out of this world.  300 hp on one item, if you woudl have told me that 5 years ago I woudl have laughed in your face and said &quot;No way&quot;.  Items with 5 stamina or 5 str were very impressive all the way up to level 35/40.  It wasn't until the upper 40s, or max (read 50) that you could really hunt for and aquire &quot;uber&quot; equipment.
<br />

<br />
In WoW, a game still in beta, they are doing the exact same thing as in early EQ.  Upgrades being only a few AC better, with 1 maybe 2 stat increasing attributes.   I for one am looking forward to playing WoW, mainly because its rich history and story that comes along with, and the fact that players are making this game.  Look at one of the main designers, Tigole.  The old Leader of Legacy of Steel.  I expect when the raid content goes live it will be superb.  If you ever read any of Tigole's ideas or chatted with him personally, he had some excellent ideas, and a mind for encounters.
<br />

<br />
I wouldn't write WoW off yet, give it a chance to actually finish beta, and have the end content found/explored.  I would wager a bet it will be more than enough to look forward to.</span></td>

<br />
I would like nothing more than for you to be right.  However, end content doesn't matter to me.  I am the type of player that makes lots of characters up to mid-level, then starts over.  I have already done this during beta, and there are no mid-level raids, so all we have to look forward to is vendor loot, dropped items, and quest items.  They are all very similar, and not very interesting.
<br />

<br />
Just because EQ started a certain way 5 years ago, does not mean that that's the way all new MMORPGs have to start.  I think it's better to start right off the bat with a diverse array of equipment for players to choose from.  I hope that they will realize this and add more green/blue/purple items to the early and mid-game (levels 10-30).  There are lots of these items in the high-end game now, but that doesn't help people who don't have lots of time to play, or just like to play lots of characters.</span></td>

I would for the devs to add more content to the mid game, such a raids and encounters for large groups of people. In reality, only tehy know what is in store for WoW, as all of this could be in the works as we type, or it could not be.  These are some of the features that will make/break WoW for me as well.  I am not a hardcore, endgame player either.  But eventually we all get there and that is what keeps me playing the game is wanting to see zones that not everyone has seen and kill mobs that not everyone has killed.  THAT is a driving force in many games today, looking forward to new things.
<br />

<br />
WoW doesn't have that yet, but I will wait to &quot;say no to WoW&quot;.  Just as I will wait to try EQ2 until I have read many many reveiws of it.  I will most likely try both, the better of the two will keep me.</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span><blockquote><b>Quote:</b><br><span class="quote">Class Inter-dependecy. Most people don't log onto a MMO just so they can solo all the time, that's what console RPG's are for. The log onto them to be around other people, to group with them and hunt with them. 
<br />

<br />
By making all classes pretty much entirely self-reliant, you wipe out the game-reasons behind classes grouping up together to become stronger. </span></blockquote> 
<br />

<br />
Tounces, it would seem that the overlap would instead create more ties between people...of course you can solo the first 5, 6 levels but then it starts becoming group content and you MUST group.
<br />

<br />
On the issue of itemization, though, EQ IS a 5 year old game as Tils put it. At level 50 the uber raid content yielded very little compared to what we have now, and that was the level 50 cap in EQ!
<br />

<br />
As for linear progression, yes it's true that the things bards do at level 65 is quite a bit different from what was done at 55, and 45 is yet again another thing from level 55 and so on. This is a unique case though because most, if not all the rest of the classes, did the same thing they had done before: Enchanters were mezzing and slowing, clerics were healing, warriors, paladins, and shadow knights were tanking at level 25 and still do at level 65. Bards have the advantage in being very versatile overall with quite a curb in playstyles and that's one reason I like to play the bard so much.</span></td>
