<p><b>Welcome</b> to the Battlehammer Reborne web page.  Birthed from fire and adversity our group is the sundered remenance of a once large and fine group of friends.  All that survives of our good friends from Clan Battlehammer is here, made stronger by the fires of diversity forged into a weapon to destroy the evils our time.
<br>
<br>
Battlehammer Reborne is a guild of friends, dedicated to grouping together to have fun and overcome the perils of Norrath (and now it's moon, Luclin), as friends, as associates, as fellow adventures.  The only thing we demand, yes <b>DEMAND</b> of our members is ... <i>they must have fun!</i></p>
