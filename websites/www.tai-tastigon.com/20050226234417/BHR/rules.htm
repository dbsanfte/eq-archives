<br><br><br>

<p><b>Our Mission</b> is to combat the threat of evil.  We believe in helping our people grow, grow as a powerful force to defeat the evil in their paths.  We believe in the strength of friendship.  Based on the bond of fellowship we shall seek out the terrors, the evils of Norrath, Luclin, Planes of Power, Gates of Discord and now Omens of War and defeat it, defeat it totally!
<br><br>

<b>Our Canon</b>
<br><br>
<li>1. Play nice, observe Verants play nice policies.
<li>2. If you have any issues with other players, guild or allied guild members and need assistance, contact an officer for assistance.  Any problems with an officer, take them up with either Fedwen or Haansum.
<li>3. Disputes between guild members and problems are never handled over guild chat.  Use tells.  Contact an officer (see rule 2 for player issues).
<li>4. No profit should be made off guild members.  All tradeskill items should be sold at cost.  No spamming sales in guild chat and conduct all sales in tells.
<li>5. No food around the pool and please no running, for your safety.
<li>6. Detagging unfortunately happens and on occasion is necessary.  All guild dismissals are handled by Fedwen or Haansum after discussion with as many officers as possible.  No one person can detag another without  officers discussion.
<li>7. We do have members who have special skills.  If they are avialable and have the time to help you, that's great.  Respect the fact that they are here to play the game just as you are and maybe busy at the time and not available to help you.  Try not to abuse the privilege of having, Druids, Shamans, Wizzards, Clerics, Necros and Shadow Knights (and all the other wonderful classes) in our guild.

<br><br>
<b>Guild Looting:</b>
<br><br>
Always, Need before Greed.  If you are not going to wear the item, you abstain on rolling.  If you are going to wear the item, you need to pass down what is in that current slot to a lower member who needs it (exceptions would be: No Drop, needing the old item for other uses - int or wis gear for skills, resists etc. - or no one wants it, this is a guideline not an absolute rule).
<br><br>
When grouped and a looted item is not No Drop or "needed" but is rolled for random distribution, if you win a roll you should then abstain from participating in the next rolls until everyone else in the group has received a random rolled item.
<br><br>
<b>Raid Guidelines:</b>
<br><br>
<li>1. When a Guild Raid is planned, there will be a Guild MOTD several days before the event and more info on the web forum.  Any suggestions for tactics need to be made in the raid thread on the web forum, not during the raid in guild chat.  Raid information will be posted in the Raid web forum so that any non-guild members joining us can access it.  All those attending the raid need to RSVP on the raid thread.
<li>2. For those of you that may have special needs or drops in the zone we are raiding you need to post it into the raid thread on the web forum so that the raid leader may account for it and plan it into the raid agenda.
<li>3. We will always designate a place to meet so that the raid leader can form groups, please be on time for this.
<li>4. Ports MAY be available, but would be a luxury provided as a kindness by our porting members and may not always be available.  It is your responsibility to get where you need to be for the raid.
<li>5. When you arrive at the designated meeting point turn on /LFG so that the raid leader may get you grouped.  Once you are grouped, please drop your /LFG tag.
<li>6. A group leader will be designated to invite the other members into his or her group for the raid, these group leaders are responsible for:  Gathering your group around you and moving off to a near by area.  Answering all questions in your group pertaining to the raid.
Passing all instructions from the raid leader relayed via guild chat to group members (some of whom may not be BHR members).  the group leader will loot ALL non No Drop rare items to be distributed per the raid loot policy.  If it is a No Drop item, the group leader will call out the item name, stats and who can use in /OOC.
<li>7. Follow the instructions given, if you have a problem then direct the query to your group leader, via /tells.  He or she will take it up with the raid leader.
<li>8. If you die on a raid, wait for instructions from your group leader.
<li>9. Respect and support your fellow players.  Do not leave the raid until all players have recovered corpses and have moved to a safe zone.
<br><br>
<b>Raid Loot Distribution:</b>
<br><br>
Raid leader handles all loot distribution and the raid leaders decision is final and will be based on advanced planning and requests.  All non No Drop gear will be reserved until the end of the raid to be distributed then.
<br><br>
On all other items we may have random roll based on "need before greed" and class specifics.
