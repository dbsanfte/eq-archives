<U>July's EQ Chat Log</U><BR>
By &lt;Shadoe&gt;
<P>
Yes, yes, I know it's been two months since you've heard anything from us.  Well, the fact
of the matter is that lately there haven't been any hare-brained articles to rant over.  
Sadly, all the latest releases by EverQuest Express and EQ Vault have been well written,
thought-out and entertaining, which makes it very difficult to rant.
<P>
But Brad McQuaid has saved us from our boredom with another chat on IRC!  What's more, this
was the first chat I was actually free to attend in person (late as I was).
<P>
Here it is, in all its glory...
<P>
</FONT>
----------
<P>
&lt;RaV&gt; Good evening Brad><BR>
&lt;Aradune&gt;<I> hello everyone :)</I><BR>
&lt;RaV&gt; One moment and we'll get started. We'd like everyone to please refrain from nick changing during the chat.<BR>
&lt;WarDragon&gt; I'd like to welcome everybody to this months chat.<BR>
&lt;WarDragon&gt; We are going to start with questions fromt eh EQV chat board, then take questions through the relay sytem, which will be explained later<BR>
&lt;WarDragon&gt; Any misbeahvoir will result in a ban, so don't bother :)<BR>
&lt;WarDragon&gt; and don't mind my typos :)<BR>
&lt;Aradune&gt;<I> Hello all, and thanks for coming.</I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Is the game on schedule?<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> Yes, the game is on schedule, and everything looks great for a 4th qrt release. </I>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
-(Don't take this the wrong way, but how else can Brad possibly answer this question?  "No, sorry, all hell's breaking loose out here at 989 Studios.  The combat system needs major work, none of the testers we picked for the closed beta are doing their jobs, Norrath is only 2% completed, and the AI we have for the NPCs puts them at a level below earthworms.  It looks like EverQuest won't be released until summer of 2003.  Sorry.")</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
GOD I hope not!!!
</FONT><P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Is there an age restriction for beta?<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> No, we have a section on the NDA for a parent or guardian to sign. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Why all the secrecy about beta?<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> A couple of reasons -- mainly what Shon touched on in the last interview, and also the fact that there is competition out there.</I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Games.net winners, where to they stand in the beta?<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> They were and are considered for phase one. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Many people want to know more about necromancers and how they manipulate the dead or living to create undead.<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> Necromancers animate corpses of NPCs, turning them into 'pets' that will do their bidding.</I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Is there a tracking skill, and how does it work?<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> And yes there is a tracking skill, but I can't comment on exactly how it works, other than to say it's becoming very handy. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
-(Watch it be yet another thing that has to do with the deity/alignment system...)
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
Hmmm...  I dunno about that one?  My guess is that it would have something to do with Class...  Druid, or Ranger maybe?
<P>This brings up two points of personal interest...
<OL>
<LI>Class Restrictions on skills, or at least Class Benefits.  I think it's a good idea, and will also help to enhance character diversity.  A spellcaster could have a "Locate" spell, but how many mages would you imagine would get down on the ground to look for tracks, or broken twigs from a passing animal?
<li>Realism of Tracking Skill.  Shouldn't tracking only work if the thing that you are tracking was actually where you are (or at least near?), and shouldn't it have you follow the path that the creature / person took, as opposed to being a magic compas pointing to anything within 2 / 3 screens of you?
</OL>

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Can you tell us about missile weapons, and if they are retrivable?  How about weapons that could be both hand and missle weapons, like a dagger or axe?<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> We have throwing axes and other weapons that can be used both as melee and missile wpns. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
-(Let's hear it for question dodge #1.)
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Can you tell us more about the interaction between classes and religion? Will all clerics abilities/limitations be dependent on the individual god?<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> At this point, the deity a cleric chooses to follow does not affect which abilities/prayers he gets. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; How does hiding work in a multiple POV environment?  Can you tell us a little more about thieves abilities?<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> Can't comment on those specific skills at this time, in that they are still being tuned. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Is it at all possible that someday in an add-on to EQ you could introduce horses or dragon riding? <BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> Yes, it's a possibility.  We definitely plan on having expansions, which could include more features, more lands, and more playable PC races/classses. </I>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
-(Dragon riding.  I agree it's an admittedly cool concept for "Dragonriders of Pern" or "DragonLance," but PLEASE, people!)
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Tell us about lycanthropy and vampirism in EQ?  Are they sun/moon sensitive?<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> Lycanthropy will most likely be in the game... vampirism is unknown at this point, as to whether it will be in-game at ship.  Both are linked with time of day. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Please tell us about clothing, how much customization is possible?<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> There are several texture sets that change depending upon what you are wearing, some of which are tintable to different colors. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Please tell us about sound, what kind is supported, how detailed are the sound effects?<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> I can't say too much about sound, in that it's still being worked on.  We'll get it as sophisticated as we can by ship.  It will be midi, and will use higher end sound cards.  There will be many sound effects, and we are researching 3d sound, but no committment at this point. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Please tell us about what factors you are considering in balancing the classes.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
-(This person, like many of us, has obviously made the laughable attempt at playing a straight wizard or cleric in UO.)
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> A few factors are very important to us -- first, that the classes are balanced such that you can play what you feel like playing -- what you want to role-play -- as opposed to being compelled to play a certain race/class because its simply better.  Also, we want compelling reasons to play all race/class combos.   We don't want any 'dud' classes, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they all need to be able to stand toe-to-toe with each other in combat.  Rather, that they are all useful in adventuring and questing. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; What will happen if you lose connection and disappear from the game, while on a moving boat.  Will you stay on the boat? or get thrown out into the ocean, or get washed ashore to the nearest island <BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> You stay on the boat/ship, just as if you were on dry land. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; How are zone load-times looking? Will we have to run, load, run load, or will it be as seamless as you can make it? <BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> There are zone load-times, as different parts of the world are loaded into memory.  We are just beginning to optimize our engine, and are very confident that load times will be minimal. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; How does the experience-per-level deal work? Will the experience required to level up each new level double, or will it multiply by 1.5, or what? <BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> We have a formula for it, and we have graphed it and such.  It does indeed get harder as you go higher. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Will there be multiple-caster only spells, e.g. powerful spells of mass destruction or mass something else? <BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> There are definitely very powerful spells... some that require a lot of preparation prior to casting -- you may have to do some smaller questing first to get set up before you cast that powerful spell. </I>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
-(Sounds like they have their act together as far as planning out the time and effort it will take to cast high level spells.  I just hope it works out in practice, and not every spellcaster will be zapping themselves all over Norrath or summoning demons left & right.)
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Will there be class specific emotes in EverQuest? <BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> A great idea -- they aren't class specific at this time, though. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
Nothing like getting the traditional Troll "Fart" greeting, or "nose pick" in response to a tough question :)
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Will Shamans be the "witchdocter" type. Or just wanbe clerics for low int races? <BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> More of the witchdoctor type, and while they are for the low int races, they are turning out to be very formidable and valuable both in combat and out. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; what about scars??  I mean they add character don't they.... <BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> no scars. </I>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
-(What about teeth-brushing?  It would add a degree of realism!  And what about the characters' hair getting messed up in battle?  How about GROWING hair that needs to be cut, for that matter?  A new class, the <U>BARBER</U>IAN!  Yes, folks, there *is* such a thing as too much realism.  I don't even WANT to touch on going to the bathroom...)
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
But Farting is a MUST!!!  (Guess what Terrance...  What Philip...  Thppt...  Ha Ha Ha Ha :)
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Can a guild "take over" a certain area of the game, as in, be recognized as rightful ruler by NPC's? <BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> They could take over and hold an area by force, killing any NPCs and +pvp players in the vacinity, but the NPCs won't recognize them as rulers, no. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; can we build our own cities, complete with NPC inhabitants? <BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> no. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; First, I read in an earlier chat that after you use your scroll, it dissipears? Is that true???<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> One uses a scroll to scribe a spell into your spellbook, afterwhich it disappears.  But the spell is then permanently in your spell book, and can then be memorized and cast (provided you have sufficient mana, any necessary components, etc.) </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Will we be able to teach each other skills. (ex meditating)<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> No. skills are earned, and one gets better at them with practice. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Will swimming be able to be learned, if you are near a shallow lake?<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> Swimming is a skill every race/class gets, and the more you swim, the better you get at it. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; As a former victim of the UO Charter Edition, how commited is 989S to keep EQ the same game that they release? I understand that somethings change during an online games lifecycle, but is there any danger that EQ will switch directions from Quest-centric to Guild-centric? <BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> I think we've been pretty clear that EverQuest is definitely a quest-centric, adventure-centric, fun-centrc game, and we all intend to keep it that way. </I>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
-(Here's another one of those "how else is Brad gonna answer that question?" question.  "We're going to start out with a quest-centric goal, but five months after release and we have all your money, we're going to switch to a more player-controlled guild system, cutting back on the staffing overhead needed to run the game.")
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; How are quest's going to be handled, so that everyone that wants to quest can? You may not be able to give specifics, but I want to know that if I gather a party of close friends and want to seek high adventure I can find it? Will quests be tailored to the character or party so that it won't be a race against 500 other people to find the foozle?<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> Some quests are available to lots of people, and some to specific groups of people. This all ties into our alignment system, which, while we are close, we still aren't quite ready to elaborate on. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; If and when your servers experience outages, what type of notification will you provide? It's not enough that we can't connect, I would like to see some acknowledgement that you know the system is down and how long you expect it to be down.<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> A lot of that infrastructure hasn't totally been determined yet, but I think it's pretty reasonable that we inform the play that a certain server is down, and that we're working hard to get it back online asap. </I>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
-(Players are going to hold you to that, Brad.  Let's do the right thing and not pull a George Bush.)
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; How will you fight underwater? <BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> It's similar to normal combat, except of course the physics are a bit different. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; This is one of my oldest questions about EQ. Will there be 'disguises'? Will rogues be able to change thier appearance? Will there be spells that do the same (polymorphing of any sort)? <BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> There is indeed a polymorph spell. </I>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
-(Let's hear it for question dodge #2.)
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Will we be able to choose an appearance for our characters that is NOT the standard macho/goddess type that we see on the game's web site? I would love to see some younger and older character models (Coots and Crones!) This would also allow you to add some interesting effects, like aging from magical attacks (ghosts) and fountain of youth type things.<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> We feel there is quite a lot of variety in appearance given our 12 races... from ugly trolls to 'macho' barbarians, and more cerebral Erudites, etc.  I think one's ability to look different, and to play a character and to role-play, is pretty unprecedented. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
-(Let's hear it for question dodge #3.  [Though, I do believe this is Brad's long-winded version of saying "no."])
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; In many diffrent pages including eq's home page it has been noted how dark elves are great for seeing at night.  How much of a diffrence will this make like will their accuracy be better, range or anything? also will they be punished by haveing a weaknees during the day. <BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> Dark Elves see the best at night, followed by some of the other races that have infravision.  So far in playing the game, having these abilities is very, very handy.  As for dark elves being penalized for being in the day outside -- they aren't at this point, but it's something we are keeping in mind if we need to counterbalance them as a race. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Posted by Jennifer on June 24, 1998 at 12:30:02: My question is about breast size; are you going to make it a standard size and if you do are they going to be realistic?  Are there going to be different attributes for female characters? Are they going to be weaker than male characters? Will the differences also apply throughout the races? <BR>
&lt;StRaG0&gt; hehe<BR>
&lt;|Brandon&gt; good night..that's always important..<BR>
&lt;RaV&gt; haha<BR>
&lt;StRaG0&gt; Most important question tonight :)<BR>
&lt;|Theseus|&gt; rofl<BR>
&lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Sorry... they made me do it :P<BR>
&lt;|Theseus|&gt; yes we did...<BR>
&lt;Dach&gt; I had nothing to do with...<BR>
&lt;|Brandon&gt; forget gameplay, latency and balance...let's get to the real issue..breast size<BR>
&lt;WarDragon&gt; lol :)<BR>
&lt;StRaG0&gt; hehehhe.<BR>
&lt;|Theseus|&gt; damn right brandon =)<BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
-(Can you believe it?  Arriving late, THIS was the question I first saw as I came into the channel.)
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> The only difference between male and female characters in the game is their appearance and how people role-play them.  As for breast size, no it's not customizable, and it's more dependent upon the race you choose.  And we define 'realism' in Norrath, and our lead artist has deemed them so :)</I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
-(This is good.  I make no pretense about my enjoyment of the Tomb Raider games, and for having Lara Croft as its focus character.  Granted, it's not roleplaying [at least, not in my book], but it's definitely one of the most all-around fun games I've played in a long time.  My only pet peeve with it is how grotesquely gargantuan Lara's chest is rendered in the cinematics!  I understand how they're trying to rank her along with other comic-book-type heroins, but PLEASE, people!)
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; It may be too eaarly to ask, but will the number of guards guarding a town be limited?  It would be nice if monsters (or other players) could overrun and hold a town, without a steady stream of guards appearing out of nowhere, as well as inspiring a sense that the defenders are fighting for something besides experience and gold.<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> It really depends upon the city, and where one is trying to enter the city.  As I've said before, it will not be entirely impossible to enter a city in which you are unwelcome. You might even get back out alive -- depends on how clever you are. </I>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
-(Let's hear it for question dodge #4!)
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Will ALL races have innate skills/abilities? Or will Humans be the only race excluded from innates?<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> Humans don't have any innates, that's true, but are the most flexible in terms of what classes they can be.  Most other races have some innates, some definitely more than others. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; If my corpse decays before I loot it, will the loot appear in a little pile where the corpse used to be? Or will the loot decay too?<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> Currently, the loot also decays.  This may or may not change during testing. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Do you have to be X amount of yards from your target to use range weapons?<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> Yes, both melee and range weapons have ranges, and it's not advantageous to use a range weapon up close. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Will there be actions such as ducking, jumping, running/run mode, used outside of combat? <BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> As a matter of fact, you can do everything you just asked. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Will some skills be automatic? If you have the dodge skill, will you automatically dodge certain times during combat or do you have to click the 'dodge' skill button?<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> Yes, some skills trigger automatically, while others are activated manually. </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Will the servers reset every once in a while, other than for fixing bugs and such? Perhaps to allow "artifacts" to be replaced if they have already been found?<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> We can do all of that dynamically.  They should only go down due to a bug or due to some need for hardware maintentance, or some such (which, of course, we will try to minimize as much as possible). </I><BR>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; Will the gore be realistic? Or will it be kept down to mild levels? Perhaps a Parental Switch or something to toggle? Will cursing be allowed as long as its not directed at another player?<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> We didn't go out of our way to make it a gory game, but EverQuest is definitely about adventure, which involves combat and death.  Also, there are some pretty evil races and such out there, and they don't have happy homes.  Currently, there is no plan for parental switches.  As for cursing, it most likely will not be allowed. </I><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
I have to agree with Shadoe on this one...  Being an adult, there are the occasional times when a well placed curse is in order...  And that brings in the question of censorship...  Which words do YOU deem to be too nasty to hear (or read)?  Give us a filter switch, so those of us not offended by potty mouth can hear what is really said.

<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQV-Qs&gt; I heard, somewhere down the line, that there was going to be a PvP server. I also heard that you have an overwhelmingly large budget to work on so, will you also be implementing a Role-Playing server or two? <BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> No, all servers will be the same.  Both +pvp and -pvp players will co-exist, and this is on purpose -- we feel keeping people together so they can talk, interact, trade, etc. is important, regardless of whether they are +pvp or -pvp.

<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> We are attempting to have the right mixture of numbers and descriptions -- we don't want EQ to be a purely numbers game, but we don't want to be vague either, when it comes to important information.  I think we'll hit the right mixture of this information by release. </I><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> No, and that's again our intent. People will have to quest for certain spells and songs, and they will be hard to come by.  Thus, the scroll disappears after use.  If one could teach them to others, eventually everyone would have everything, and we think that would take a lot of the fun out of it. </I><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> Excellent question -- we are still working a lot of that out in beta, attempting to make it as realistic as possible, but still dependent upon stats and skills and such.  So there really isn't a definitive answer on that yet. </I><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> I prefer adventure-based to combat-based -- I think that's more accurate -- there's definitely more to do than just fight.  As for loot, yes a great way to come by wealth will be to complete quests and slay monsters and such, and some NPCs have some pretty nifty stuff. </I><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay_2&gt; &lt;PDirge&gt; Will different types of armor affect spell damage.  For instance wearing platemail cause a lightning bolt that hits you to cause double damage?<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> That could happen in a sense -- if you look at our inventory screen shots, you'll see resistances to magic, fire, cold, etc.  Items can either help you or hurt you in those areas.

Are there uniform textures i.e. one plate texture, one mail texture, one robe texture, or is each body part defined in the texture and can be replaced by the proper piece of equipment's texture so that you see every single piece of equipment worn on player models, instead of seeing only the general armor.<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> Somewhere inbetween, really. If you look at the inventory screens, you'll see that there is something like 21 different body locations in which you can place items (earrings, leggings, belts, etc. etc).  Something like half of those actually change textures on the character, so you get a lot more detail than just general armor and such.  A player could have visible leather boots, plate leggings, chainmail sleeves, etc.  </I><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> Weather doesn't change the actual landscape, no, but it does change the physics in that area, eg. how slippery a slope is.  As for dieties for druids, they have a few that are definitely the type a druid or ranger would prefer to follow. </I><BR>

<P>
&lt;Relay_1&gt; Thanks Everyone for coming out..  I think brad has something to say about beta?<BR>
&lt;Aradune&gt;<I> Yep, I have a few announcements about the closed beta, where its at, and such.
We decided a while back to have a Phase .5 of sorts, involving approximately 40 people, and this phase has been going on since right after E3.  It's going great, and while that phase has been underway, we've been calling people about phase one, and sending out NDAs.
We have well over 200 NDAs out now, and will be sending probably 100 or so more out for phase one.  The plan is to have, as stated before, about 100 or so people online at any given time.
Phase two will begin after we are happy with the way the game is progressing under phase one.  With phase two, which will still be under NDA, we will increase the number of people such that we have approx. 500 people playing at any given time.</I>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Gaijin-&gt; Are people still getting called?  IE,  is there still a chance? :)<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> &lt;Aradune&gt;<I> People are still being called for phase one, but we're pretty close to having everyone for that phase.  But our people will continue to call out for phase two, and like I said, there will be a lot more people.  Phase 3 and beyond will probably not involve an NDA, but we aren't positive at this time.</I><BR>

* StRaG0 cries<BR>
&lt;RaV&gt; Haha<BR>
* StRaG0 falls over...<BR>
* Dach slaps Gaijin<BR>
&lt;StRaG0&gt; hehe<BR>
&lt;Aradune&gt;<I> As for when phase one actually begins, it looks pretty solid that it will begin in about 2 weeks, maybe less. Like I said, there are over 40 people externally testing now, along with our internal testers and the dev team.</I><BR>
&lt;WarDragon&gt; Well, if thats it Brad, I would like to thank you for coming out, and I would like to thank everyone who mobbed us relayers with questions for giving us material.<BR>

After Brad left, people started whining and moaning over the things Brad said and over his 
question dodging, which gave me an adroit reminder why I don't hang around in IRC much 
anymore.  So I left town to write this review for you all to read.  
<P>
It was a fun time, though.  No nuke attempts that I could see, and aside from the 
occasional bout of wise-ass nick changing, people behaved themselves.  All in all, I give 
it about an 8.  Don't ask me on what scale, though... ;)

Hey, guess what time it is!  That's right, it's time for Bill Clinton to become a eunuch!  But, candidly, I'm more interested in reading about
the latest chat with Brad McQuaid.  So go get something comfy to sit on (I prefer a chair), make yourself a relaxing beverage (I prefer a 
low-viscosity liquid), and let's get started!
<P>
</FONT>
----------
<P>
<I> &lt;Aradune&gt; Welcome to the chat, and thank you all for coming.  We are almost done sorting through the thousands and thousands of apps
and hopefully will begin the first phase of external closed testing soon.  I do appreciate everyone's patience, but we want to make sure we're 
ready.  That said, I'd be happy to answer some questions.</I>
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT></B> &lt;BlkStaff&gt; Are there any limits (other than the pvp/nonpvp issue) to what kind of races/classes can be in the same party?  Like can a dwarf 
and ogre (or a shadowknight and paladin) be in the same party even though their races/classes in general don't get along?
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT></B><I> &lt;Aradune&gt; At this time there are no restrictions to grouping in terms of race and class.  Unless this becomes a problem in testing, it will 
probably stay that way.</I>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
--(On the surface, it seems it would be best to leave odd groupings and the roleplay reasons behind them up to the players.  Not unlike the fable 
of the mouse and the lion who became fast friends because the mouse pulled a painful thorn out of the lion's paw one day [one of Aesop's, I 
think.]  On a deeper level, I groan to think of all the power gamers out there who decide to ally dark elf shadow knights with human paladins 
just to exploit some quirk in game mechanics to their advantage.  It only takes one nut to crack a shell.)
</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
Hmmm...  This brings up some interesting points.  I cant help but think back to the banks in UO...  "The Great Lord was working with the PKers."  Is this the same situation or not?
<P>I just read an article in the latest <A HREF="eqx/index.html" TARGET="_blank">Everquest Express</A> release that discussed class wars and alluded to religion affecting gameplay...  Will it though?
<P>Without a doubt, the system that is set up in EQ has enormous Role Playing potential, and a number of people will take advantage of these devices.  Unfortunately, as UO has shown us, the masses don't know how to roleplay, and will "Play to the environment".
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>Put a newbie with no RPG experience in a closed game with nothing but serious roleplayers, the newbie will learn to roleplay, and think that is the way the game is played.  On the other hand, put the same person in with a different class of player (you know the ones), and guess what...  the same newbie will become the scourge of the game.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Wouldn't it be nice, if you ware a newbie, separated from your party, wounded and lost, to come across a Shining Paladin in full plate riding across the field you are in...  Paladins are good, he'll lend a hand if he can.  He rides up, and with a single slash from his magic sword you fall to the ground dead...  The last words you har are "I love playing a Paladin...  They run up to the slaughter".
<P>Yeah, I guess it is possible that a paladin could snap and go bad, but highly unlikely (I would assume).
<P>You can see where I'm going.  What will the game do about situations like this?  Can a player worship a Good God, play a "Good" Class, yet be a mass murderer?  If a "Good" Paladin murders "Evily" alligned PCs, is that good for his "Notoriety"?  What if the same murders other "Good" Aligned PCs / NPCs?  Does his alignment change?  Can he remain a Paladin?  Will you be able to change Class in the game?
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>You start out with a "Good" Character.  As your character evolves, you see a new direction that you want your character to go in...  Can this be changed?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I guess my point is that EQ seems to have all kinds of potential.  But the final feel of the game will depend on the players.  We've all seen that it's easier NOT to Role Play, so the masses don't.  I think the solution that we are looking for lies in Private Servers.
<P>When I say private servers, I mean that a local group or community could have their own hardware, and software to run a server, OR could possibly lease a server from the Company...
<P>Think about this, Sony is going big anyway...  Lots of servers (we hope).  Say they somehow allowed for a "Moderated?" server.  Where a team of "US" were the GMs.  There could be a $5 / month surcharge to play on this server.  This would go to pay the GMs and Sony.  Every player has to be sponsored to get access, and can loose access to that server for impropper conduct.  Sure it opens a HUGE door for exploitation and favoratism, but with a group of Like minded Role Players???  Who knows?  I think it might work?
<P>er... back to the chat.

<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT></B> &lt;BlkStaff&gt; I'm thinking that it wouldn't be all that hard to kill any npvper... The problem is, 
people can enchant a monster someone is fighting (maybe a heal spell, defence spell, strength spell) which would enable the monster the npvp-er's 
fighting to kill him... how will that be handled? Is it gonna be prevented? 
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT></B><I> &lt;Aradune&gt; We are continally brain storming on potential areas of +pvp and -pvp abuse, and are implementing quite a few ways to avoid most 
abuse.  However, also keep in mind that a +pvp person figuring out a way to harm a -pvp person will be considered illegal and could result in 
banning of that person.</I>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
--(It's sad, but true, that there <I>will</I> be oversights out there when it comes to the PK switch, and there <I>will</I> be players who would 
sell their souls to exploit them.  I think if we enter into the mindset that this is inevitible, we'll all be happier [or at least hold less 
rancor] when it rears its ugly head.  Brad's claim that this will be grounds for banning has my attention, though.  I guess what he's saying in a 
nutshell is that non-PK characters' lives are sacrosanct, and PK characters must leave them alone.  I trust that this is a two-way street as well, 
in the sense that non-PK characters who find a way to kill or assist in killing PK characters will be treated similarly.)
</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
Banning Abusers.  I'm all for it, but there has to be a definate policy in place to take into account mistakes.  If they are going to ban, do it regularly, do it consistently, and do it fairly.  Keep archived logs of player actions...  Be able to get proof whether someone did something or not, and how many times they did it (and when).
<P>This also brings me to Player Losses due to game instabilities.  We hope it won't happen, but it's pretty much unavoidable.  If a GM has the tools at his disposal to easily and quickly determine if what the player says indeed happened, then by all means replace the item (s).  This would do a world of good for Customer Satisfaction, and would be a big One Up over the other guys.

going into different cities??
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT></B><I> &lt;Aradune&gt; It all depends on the sort of monster you end up slaying... low level and common monsters will tend to have lower level and more 
mudane items, and higher level monsters will typically use more exotic items.  As for classes, some classes are more related to one's alignment 
than others.  And some cities are more sensitive toward other alignments than others, so you'd have to be more specific.  For instance, I wouldn't 
want to be a necromancer and parade into the paladin's guild in Erudin.</I>
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT></B> &lt;BlkStaff&gt; Will Necromancers 'create' their undeads from thin air or will they need to have a corpse of a dead monster or (n)pc to make 
them?

<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT></B> &lt;BlkStaff&gt; Asheron's call is going to have high, medium, and low attacks during combat. Is EQ going to have anything like that possibly 
better?  And if you do have that did you ever think about possibly adding the ability to use a controler in the game and during combat making it 
maybe more like a fighting game?
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT></B><I> &lt;Aradune&gt; There are several different things you can do doing combat, and it typically involves using combat related skills, such as kick 
and bash.  Monks, for instance, have many different types of attacks.  As for using a controller to make it more like a fighting game, we are 
definitely against making it 'more like a fighting game' in that that genre is twitch based, and this is not a twitch game.  But as for different 
controllers, we are looking into it.  Currently, it's mouse and/or keyboard controlled.</I>
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT></B> &lt;BlkStaff&gt; Can you tell us if race actually makes a huge difference in game play and i dont understand what you guys are talking about with 
language.  Do you mean that if im an ogre i can only talk to another ogre? or i can only understand an oge npc if you have ogre npcs?
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT></B><I> &lt;Aradune&gt; Race makes a big difference both in terms of your stats, innate abilities, and class selection options, as well as in how the 
world and its inhabitants react to you.  As for language, the current plan is to have a 'common' tongue that would allow just about everyone to 
converse with anyone else, but to also have race specific languages that one could learn and become fluent in.</I>

<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT></B> &lt;BlkStaff&gt; Will new NPCs, monsters, continents, and buildings be added to the game world after the release? Possibly through a mandatory 
patch? If so, how often will they be released?
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT></B><I> &lt;Aradune&gt; Absolutely -- all three.  The plan is to keep the development team working away, adding on the world.  This would either be done 
through periodic patches and/or the purchase of expansion packs at your retailer.</I>

<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT></B> &lt;BlkStaff&gt; Can characters be tagged with their guild name or abbreviation by guild leaders and untagged as well?  If not, how will guilds be

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
--(Eh, there are some who would disagree with me on this one, but it's been my experience that hiring NPCs to protect you -- albeit an adittedly 
cool idea -- is about as useful as renting a neutered bull to breed your herd.  Perhaps SI would have done it differently, but the AI behind a 
sufficiently "intelligent" NPC bodyguard to fend off would-be PC assailants would have to be massive, and franky, not worth the investment to develop, IMHO.)

<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT></B> &lt;BlkStaff&gt; 2) In one of the recent screen shots Aradune seems supped up.  His stats are all above 100, his AC is over 200 and all his 
resistances are above 50, all at 1st level. I know this was probably done for testing but what will a "regular" Human Ranger's stats look like
compared to that and will the Sony staff play with "normal" characters in final (at least part of the time)
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT></B><I> &lt;Aradune&gt; It is true that Aradune's stats were buffed up for testing, however do keep in mind that the scale for AC and attributes and other 
stats is a bit different than others systems -- some range from 1-200, and others 1-400.  Sony staff will play all sorts of characters in-game, 
and sometimes you will know they are Sony staff, and sometimes you won't.  It depends on the role they are playing.  If a GM is assuming the role 
of an avatar of one of the gods to hand out a quest or some such, I would expect that avatar to have some pretty hefty stats.</I>

--(Hmmmm... so, if you can manage to remain alive, you could conceivably keep that Silver Halberd Of Ungodly Manslaughter for all eternity.  
Interesting.  The first thing that comes to mind for the sake of roleplaying is the concept of heirlooms passed from character to character
that don't end up being useless items after a gazillion repairs.  I'm trying to think of a downside to this.  Though I'm sure they're out there, none spring readily to mind.)
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
I gotta say, I'm for this one.  In UO I found repairs to be nothing more than an expensive nuisance.  An attempt to force life into the economy, and to foster "RolePlaying".  In reality, everyone is either a blacksmith (partially), has a blacksmith Mule, and a house with a forge (and can recall from the battlefield, home to do repairs, then back again).

<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT></B> &lt;Cadderly4&gt; &lt;DarkwlkeR&gt; when someone dies.. how will you be able to have proof of the kill 
(an ear or heart or head?) or maybe it will say "Darkwalker is dead(yea right)"?
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT></B><I> &lt;Aradune&gt; I assume you mean a pvp kill... well, one way would be that I assume you'd have the 
victim's items, and if he were truly a formidable foe, I'd assume he'd have some pretty nice equipment... which would be yours.</I>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
--(I may have spoken too soon about the suggestion thing two questions back.  What could possibly be impractical about implementing the 
time-honored tradition of delivering the victim's head/ear/scalp (I prefer head) as undeniable proof and identification of a kill?  At the very 
least, it's just another item to be placed in the corpse's inventory for the assassin to pick up.  I mean, grabbing neato items off a fresh kill is
terrific and all, but it's not a sure-fire method of proving you took out the proper mark.  The only exception is when it's known that the mark 
posesses a unique artifact that never leaves his side, but how often is that going to happen in EQ?  By Brad's own admission, unique 
artifacts are going to be somewhat rare and quite valuable items.  On the other hand, producing an item called "Head of Maligant Nightweaver" that
can only come from one source -- the freshly killed body of Maligant Nightweaver -- is a conclusive means of identifying a proper kill [unless it 
was stolen, which is another story in itself.]  This rings especially true when you consider their plans to make character names unique.
<P>
Taking this thread somewhat off the subject, if the design team decided to be very creative, they could delve into more dark ritualistic actions, and add 
decapitation [among many other "icky" things] as something you must perform on a dead body in order to obtain the head.  It would certainly make for 
some truly excellent fodder for those wanting to roleplay evil characters [if nothing else, it would really put some actual <I>meaning</I> into 
roleplaying drow!]  Siting UO as a prime example, they made it possible to mutilate corpses.  I don't say it often -- <I>and I don't say it 
loud</I> -- but this is one of the few things I think UO did right, and it's something SI would do well to adopt if they truly wish to encourage 
roleplaying in a medium that is perpetually under attack for its lack of style -- player killing.)

Yep, I've heard of lycanthropy, and your wife is correct.  It is indeed Wearwolves, wererats, werebats...  list goes on.

didn't fry :) and take them to an ancient armorer across the continent, and he'd make the dragonscale armor for you.  That's just an example, not 
an actual quest (well, it could be).  But that's how that sort of thing will work.</I>

loyalty has begun, as polls indicate EQ's plummeting in everyone's estimation as being the next milestone in computerized roleplaying games.  Sony 
Interactive stock has taken a dramatic dive in the marketplace, throwing off the predicted sales of high end Intel Pentium II processors in the 
next nine to eleven months.  The 3D accelerated video card market remains stable, however, due to a recent EIDOS press release stating that 
players will be seeing action game superstar Lara Croft <I>totally unclothed</I> throughout Tomb Raider III, scheduled for release early next 
year.  In other news, entrepeneur and CEO Bill Gates has announced that in lieu of Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Windows 98 will instead come

--(Ooooo... interesting twist.  This brings up a few important points:  1) SI had better be prepared to set up
quite a few game servers to accomodate everyone.  2) What about server latency issues for the players?  I cringe to
envision seeing myself getting EQ and finding out that all the servers I have great connections to are all filled
up with registrants.  As I am living in the Mountain time zone, this is saying a lot.  3) Will players be allowed
to register on more than one server?  If not, this seems very restrictive.  And if so, then what's stopping players 
from immediately registering on every new server as they go up, just to reserve a slot for future play in that 
particular world?  Any way you slice it, I can see some very large problems arising.)
</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
Good points Shadoe...  This is one of the solutions that I came up with back in the early UO Beta days when we had no idea how the live servers would be handled.
<P>A few thoughts on this point...
<UL>
<LI>with 1000 - 1500 ppl online at any time, that means that each server will have 3000 - 4000 registered users.
<LI>Maybe the billing will be per server that you are signed up on?  Or maybe each account is allowed to be signed up on 2? servers?
<LI>Assuming that everyone signed up on 2 servers, and the monthly bill is $10 for both servers, then they will be making $15,000 - $20,000 / server / month.  Still a pretty good markup there.
<LI>Hmmm...  Actually, since you can only be on one server at a time, if they increase the number of servers that you can sign up on, then they can also increase the number of users / server.  This will be fine as long as the servers are up, but if a server goes down, then there will be some serious load on other servers.  I guess it all depends on how many servers they are going to set up.  10, 20, 50?  How much will the market bear?

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT></B><I> &lt;Aradune&gt; You'll probably have a decent idea based on what they are
wearing, in that there are class-based item restrictions. Also, if they choose not to be anonymous, you will see 
their class listed in the players list.</I>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
--(This is nice, being able to determine if you appear anonymous to others.  I wonder if this extends to your 
character's name as well?  This may be premature to ponder, but I also wonder if it applies to a character's 
alignment, too... that is, outside of mere race identification.)
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT></B> &lt;Relay3&gt; Brad, what are the limitations on names going to be, 
example: one Malachite per server or one Malachite per the entire game? - Malachite
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT></B><I> &lt;Aradune&gt; Most likely unique to the server, not the entire game. </I>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
--(Again, I have the same problems with this restriction as with the issue of registering <I>X</I> number of people 
per server.  To be fair, it does help facilitate long distance messaging without having to memorize or record some 
sort of user ID.  Still, everyone has their beloved characters they've named and played over their years of 
roleplaying, and it rubs me the wrong way to think that most of them will be hindered because there can't be more 
than one "Malachite" per server.)
</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
With only 3000 - 4000 people registered per server, I don't think this should be too big of an issue, as long as it is a unique name.  I've got to admit that I'd be kinda miffed if I tried to start Lamron to find that someone had taken the name.  On the whole though, I think that unique names are a good thing...  Er, let me rethink that.  Looking at the recent, you can SEE the difference between people (unlike other games...  what color robe, and what type of helm were they wearing?).  I don't think that non unique names would be too bad.

with your character's name, does it mean you can't move to that world?  Is the process of transferring a character 
bound to the same rules as creating a new one when it comes to the player cap?  Granted, this registration system

<U>The Lag Monster Review</U><BR>
By &lt;Shadoe&gt;
<P>
Good news!  At last, someone has decided to write an article worth ranting over!  Don't get me wrong, this isn't a 
slur on authors of recent articles, as we all know that you can't easily rant over an article that is well thought 
out, well written, and correct.
<P>
I've selected Razor's recent article in <A HREF="http://www.gramsplace.com/eq/eqx/index.html">EverQuest 
Express</A>'s issue #15 entitled "<A HREF="http://www.gramsplace.com/eq/eqx/Issue15/lag.htm">The Lag Monster</A>" 
to rant over, not because it wasn't well written (because it was) and not because he wasn't correct in what he was 
saying (because his technical accuracy was impeccable).  My primary focus is the fact that he didn't address the 
real issue behind lag and why players have every right to grumble.

<P>
<U>The Lag Monster</U><BR>
By Razor
<P>
"Man this game is too lagged" 
<P>
How many times have you said this while playing a game online? The dreaded screen freeze - as you watch your 
character killed and then looted in slow motion. 
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
--(Who, me?  Never.  The lag in UO always gave me the chance to do my taxes between sword thrusts.)
</FONT>
<P>
I am a network engineer. I have spent the last 11 years designing, implementing, and supporting networks. I dont 
have a cure for network lag, but I can explain some of the causes for it. 
<P>
Ive been playing multi-player games since the 1980s. I got my first taste of network gaming playing Muds 
Multi User Dungeons). I havent played a single player game since! 
<P>
"What the hell is a MUD?"
<P>
Mud is a software program, running on a server, that accepts connections from multiple users. Each user functions
independently. He or she can interact with other users, killing creatures, socializing, or even falling in love and
getting married? Well some did. Im a fighter, not a lover (evil grin). The game is entirely TEXT. You have to be able 
to read (and in some cases read fast) to play. Each area is a square, which contains a room description, creatures,
and objects. Soon after Muds came Moos, Mucks, Mushs, Mugs to name a few.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
--(For those ancient PC users out there, just set the Wayback Machine to the days of Infocom's famous original Zork 
series.  Except this time it's real people who can't understand your sentences, instead of it being the game 
itself.)
</FONT>
<P>
"Were you lagged while playing Muds?" 
<P>
Yes. The lag monster was around in the old days as well, although the cause, for the most part, was for a different 
reason. Lag from over utilized servers was more of the cause then. 
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
--(Funny you should say that, since it's the servers that are the major cause of lag today, too!)
</FONT>
<P>
"Ok. So you had lag. What the heck is it". 
<P>
Games on the Internet use TCP and UDP datagrams to carry information from the Server to the Client (the client 
being your home PC). Lag is the interval between the time a piece of data leaves the server, travels across the 
Internet cloud, and arrives, and is processed or reassembled on your PC. Let us follow this process from start to 
finish. Ill try to keep it simple, so bare with me. 
<P>
You just loaded EverQuest and installed the game.  YEA!!!!! (hey its my story I can dream if I want to!) You hit 
the connect icon. Hopefully by now you have already connected to your Internet service provider or ISP. This
connection between you and your ISP is one hop. The Internet is full of these hops to get from one destination to
another. 
<P>
There are also multiple paths from point A to point B that can be traveled to get to a destination. That is where 
routing protocols come in, but thats a future issue. Now your PC sends a message requesting a connection from the 
game server out in the cloud somewhere. When a TCP connection first opens, both ends can send the maximum datagram 
size they can handle. The smaller of these numbers is used for the rest of the connection. A connection is then 
established after a series of messages back and forth. Now game information is broken up into datagrams and sent 
out. It might take 15 datagrams to complete one piece of information. These datagrams are numbered so that the
receiver can reassemble the data in the correct order so it makes sense.
<P>
So lets say a trace route shows that its 22 hops from your PC to the Game server, with an average ping (a program 
that uses ICMP replies) of 220ms. Thats the time it takes a packet to leave your PC, travel to the destination 
address, and back again.
<P>
Each of these 15 datagrams leaves your PC, travels across the Internet through each of these 22 hops, and arrives 
at the server, where they are reassembled in order, and forwarded up to the application layer. Then answered and
sent back to you. 
<P>
Okay now with this awareness of networking, lets say that for some reason; one of the 15 datagrams did not reach 
the server. The server has 14 of the 15 datagrams. He must now send a request back for the lost datagram while
holding the other 14. 
<P>
Although these processes happen in milliseconds, you can see if a packet is lost, or delayed repeatedly, it can 
really cause a lot of problems in your game.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
--(Whoa, whoa, whoa... suddenly the term "lag" is synonymous with "latency?"  Latency in TCP communication is
one possible <I>cause</I> of lag, but they certainly aren't the same thing.  To the game player, lag is defined as
anything that causes their gameplay to pause or cease unnaturally.  Be it network latency, server load, or Donna
Dixon posing in a string bikini, it's all irrelevant.)
</FONT>
<P>
"Ok. Now Im totally lost. What does this all mean?" 
<P>
All Im saying is to truly evaluate your connection to a game server you have to look at more than just the ping 
time, but also be aware of the packet loss, and take into consideration your through put.  For example is your 
modem 9600-baud?  Also keep in mind that not only does the game server have to reassemble datagrams, but your PC 
must do this as well. If your computer is loaded down with background processes like ICQ, Real Audio, News Ticker, 
and Netscape Mail checker all going at once, not only are these taking up resource space, but they are also 
processing packets of their own! You could be the biggest cause of lag. 
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
--(Pardon me while I unload my breakfast... unless you're running Windows 95 on a 486 or a <I>very</I> early 
generation Pentium, your background internet utility processes will have a <I>minimal</I> effect on the 
performance of the game you're playing.  I suppose it would make a difference if you're downloading umpteen files 
at a time, but how often does this happen when you're gaming?  As far as packet parsing goes, this burden on a 
workstation's processor is like a flea on a camel's hump.  You only encounter a heavy workload in this manner when 
you're on a server and it has to parse thousands or millions of packets at once.)
</FONT>
<P>
Also run trace routes through your ISP.  Check the amount of packet loss from you and your ISP. You can even check
this information between your ISPs ISP. If the packet loss between these connections are greater than 3%, I would 
find a new Internet service provider. In addition the average ping time between these should also be below 40ms.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
--(Definitely good advice.  If, for some ungodly reason, you're losing packets from your ISP and its local 
gateways, you've <I>got</I> to be hating life.  But this should be an issue for you only if your ISP's technical 
support e-mail address is "satanic.demonspawn@slownet.rip-off.org".)
</FONT>
<P>
I sometimes get frustrated when I hear someone say, "This game sucks! I cant deal with this freaken lag!" while
not knowing what "lag" is, or its source.  EverQuest has stated they are keeping the traffic minimal enough that 
even a 28.8 modem will be able to handle, which means fewer packets for your computer to process as well. A focus 
on coding an application around latency is a very good approach to client / server communication. So when you get 
youre copy, and start playing EverQuest this spring [another evil grin], and you happen to experience some periods of
lag, remember back on this article, and check those hop counts and packet loss ratios. Look to see what applications 
youre running in the background. Dont just run around screaming, "LaaAAAAAGGGGGGgggg" spamming my screen. 
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
--(I <I>always</I> get frustrated when I see someone write an article like this where they address an issue I 
believe is completely non-sequitor.  Latency due to slow and unreliable internet connection is always a factor, and 
there's little anyone can do about it until our communications standards improve -- true.  However, the cause of 90% of our 
woes in experiencing lag in massively multiplayer gaming is <I>not</I> latency... hence the usage of the term "server side lag" ["SSL" 
for short].  SSL <I>is</I> a correctable issue, one way or another.  Be it through the coding of the server 
software, or through the usage policy, there are ways to correct it.  There exist very few valid excuses for users 
experiencing SSL from a company making hundreds of thousands of dollars a month in subscription fees.  I find the 
comments Brad made about EverQuest to be promising.  We'll cross our fingers and see if they can deliver.)

<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
As you can plainly see, Razor knows what he's talking about when it comes to networking issues.  It just so happens
that Internet connectivity isn't always the problem.  In fact, in my experience, it's <I>rarely</I> the problem.
If we experienced latency more often than SSL, then you wouldn't see everyone on your screen screaming 
"LaaAAAAAGGGGGGgggg."  It would only be you, and you would be pegged as the village crazy.
<P>
&lt;Shadoe&gt;
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
<P>I certainly appreciate Razor taking the time to write this article, and it does go a long way toward explaining the Internet "Lag" or latency issues...  Unfortunately, I have to concur with Shadoe on this one...  Just before I shut down my UO account, I was able to ping the Baja server using that wonderful UOTrace Utility (still use it to this day), and have ping times in the range of 35 - 40 ms with 0% loss...  That's SCREAMIN FAST!!!  But in the game, due to SSL, it was 3 step all the way to the dungeon, then once you got into the dungeon the SSL would go away...  Funny, no houses in dungeons :)  Also when playing on the Test Server with 100+ ms ping times, and 5 - 15% packet loss, there was no appreciable lag on the surface, or in the dungeons...  Me thinks Baja just has too many people (and houses).
<P>I've heard reports that some of the lag issues are much better now, but I've heard just as many reports that it's just as bad...  Who knows?
<P>Gram!!!

Greets, readers.  Just a quick update on some comments and clarifications I'd like to add to yesterday's review of 

the <A HREF="http://www.games.net" TARGET="_BLANK">Games.net</A> chat with Brad McQuaid...

<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT></B> Hello, I was wondering, I am on the Newsgroup and naturally I have some 
questions=) oh man I just forgot what they are, funny how my mind goes blank at this very time...ah here it is ok. 
I have heard that there will be a pk switch, right? But what about limitations within limitations? By that i mean, 
will there be sanctuaries? Can you fight in taverns? What will the system be like 
<P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT></B><I> There aren't any sanctuaries per se, but there are definitely areas, 
typically within populated cities, where you'll be fairly safe due to the number of guards around.</I>
<P>

<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
--(We'll see how well this works.  If memory serves, this was the same scheme OSI was using with Ultima Online in cities during the first phase of the beta.  For whatever reason, they switched to summary capital punishment for any attack in town via teleporting, invincible, juggernaut guards.  I'm not saying OSI's decision was 
<I>logical</I>, by any means... just citing the case.)
</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
Actually, it's much more lax now than it was in the beginning of the UO Beta...
<P>It used to be that if you a) attacked anyone, b) tried to move an in game item (sewing kit, book...), or stole anything (even with no witnesses within screens), you would get immediately thumped...  At least now you can steal, and as long as nobody sees you, you're safe.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
--(True, but still, if you're caught breaking the law in UO, it's not a matter of being able to fight off the guards and escaping... by default, you're pulverized into roadkill.  What Brad's saying suggests this won't be the case with EQ.  There may be at least <I>some</I> chance of surviving the incident.)
</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
"Some Chance" is the operative word...  If a Guard moves as fast as a person (Do different races move at different speeds?  And what about encumberance...  Nobody's asked that one yet in the chats...), if there is Internet Lag (at all), the game controled guard will catch up...  But I do like the idea of running, or possibly even fighting...  Not that I tend to do much illegal stuff, but...

<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT></B> What will the monetary unit be in EQ? Gold coins?

</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
--(I think you're referring to my comment about "how much does a house costs in EQ?"  This is different, and you summed it up in what you just said.  Is a gold coin going to be seen as something relatively rare and valuable, or is it going to be so many pennies strewn across the land as it is in UO?  I'm hoping for the former.)
</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
Ahhh... that was it...  Good point.  I like the analogy too...  Just so many pennies :)

<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT></B> How will the economy work in EverQuest? Will there be set guides for the monetary units or will the value of money follow mercantalistic laws?

they be rare or mundane, will go up and down. </I>

<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
--(Red flag here.  Such a system requires a lot of time for major tweaking to get to run correctly.  I hope they

items.  But hey, my mind's open to argument on this point.)
</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
As long as the servers and client are stable, the combat system works...  I could care less about the economy...  I'm sure that something will be worked out...  Stability, respawn and SSL are my BIG issues...  And customer support in the final.
</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
--(Be careful how you belittle the impact economy has on the very issue of combat, my friend.  I distinctly remember my blind attempt at playing an archer early on in UO when shopkeepers charged the laughable price of 60+ gold per arrow.  Suddenly it was costing me hundreds of gold to finance the killing of an ordinary orc...?  This, among other things, made the archer character unplayable as far as combat goes, and this is just one example among many.)
</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
Hmmm...  I remember those times as well, and I was an archer too.  I LOVED it though, because I knew where and how to hunt birds...  I always had stockpiles of several hundred feathers.  When they ran low, I'd go out on another bird quest...  Lot of birds, they only gave 10 feathers each (or less) at that time.
</FONT>

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT></B> What is the situation reguarding languages in EverQuest? Will each race have a language, and you can only understand it if you speak it? And a common language? 
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT></B><I> Each race will have its native tongue, however there will be a common speech as well. </I>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
--(Now, <I>this</I> is something I think could be very interesting.  If you're a human that doesn't understand 
"trollish," and a bunch of trolls are nearby yakking in their native tongue... what happens?  Is it just gibberish 
that comes across your dialog window, random pre-determined "trollish" phrases, meaningful "trollish" phrases based 
on what they're saying in english, or something even more complex?  I can imagine this could be either very simple 
or mind bogglingly complicated.  Chances are they're opting for the simple side.)
</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
I'd like to see this on the more complicated side...  Give the ability to learn other languages...  Make it tough though...  Nothing like being able to evesdrop on a conversation that the people speaking don't think you understand...  A switch for speak in common or native toung...  I like this idea :)
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
--(I very much agree that I'd prefer to see the complicated style come to life.  It would be engrossing and allow for quite a bit of style for ambience.  Sadly, I doubt the development team would have time for just one relatively ineffectual aspect of the game.  Nevertheless, I'm anxious to see what they come up with.)
</FONT>
<P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT></B> Are their limits to how far we can build our characters, such as stat or skill or level caps? 
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT></B><I> We are still debating as to whether there will actually be caps or limits, but we all agree that if there are, it will take a LONG time to reach them. </I>

And what may be long to a powergamer that plays 18 hours a day every day is a lifetime to a 2 - 3 hour / weekend player...  Who will they cater to?
</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
--(Indeed, this is a dillema I'm glad I don't have the burden of solving.  From what I can see, the casual player must allow for a certain amount of acceptance that the people who play more will generally have more powerful characters.  It's a de facto... [of life-o].)
</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
Yep, but isn't it kinda silly and unrealistic to even hope otherwise...  Just like in real life, if you do 30 minutes of pushups a day, are you going to be as buffed and as pumped as the guy that works out at the gym for 3 hours every day?  It's all a matter of commitment, and how much time you are willing to put in to achieve results...
<P>Time isn't the only thing though...  Knowledge of the game helps a LOT too, but how do you truly get an understanding of the game???  Play it lots.

<B><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT></B> Will there Game Masters in game 24/7?

That's all well and good, but will there be more than one of them for all servers, and will they have "I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do about that." set as a 'Say' macro.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#1B651F">
--(Maybe I give SI too much credit, but I get the feeling this is another thing SI has learned not to do from the lessons of the competition.  Either that or it's just wishful thinking on my part.)
</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
I certainly hope so...  Once again, what would it hurt if the GMS actually gave back some items if they believed the story...  Some would argue that it would offset the balance of the game, and would lead to abuse...  There undoubtedly some people that would abuse that one...  But these are the same people that will spend hours sparring, duping, or doing whatever else they can do to unbalance the game...
<P>And quite frankly, if they kept a log of all items given to a character or player, it would be pretty easy to see the ones that are asking a but too much...  Regardless of whether it will unbalance the game, and whether it will be possible to dupr items in EQ, if the GMS are able to do something about problems other than jst get you unstuck from holes in the map, it will do a WORLD of good for PR.

This is a tough one in my eyes...  Role playing is in the eye of the beholder...  Does Role Playing require that you speakin archaic manner?  Does it mean getting into your character...  Yes.  Will there be Quakers in the game...  You bet there will...  Probably as many if not more than in UO... 
I figure if you want roleplaying...  Roleplay.  Don't expect others to...  Do it yourself...  If enough people have this attitude, then there will be a good enough number of roleplayers.

Actually, this could be interesting...  Consider this...  All you would need would be a door or portal...  Once you steped through the portal, this new world / room / dungeon / whatever could be downloaded to your client...  You could then enter other people's worlds...  Probably won't happen with this generation of games, but in the next generation, I see this as being a distinct possibility...
<P>It would be a cool solution for your own house...  Go into an "Appartment Building" or whatever, somehow select a room to enter, and there you are...  Seperate from the main server, decorated as you wish...  There are a lot of obvious objections I can come up with off the top of my head, but consider the possibilities...  Maybe in a few years.

</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
I don't know which is worse, a lagged game that you san't walk in that crashes regularly, or a game that you have to start trying to log in to an hour before you want to play...  What do you bet that one of the first utilities that will come out will be a) a log in utility that you set to log you in an hour before you get home from work/schooland b) a utility that will keep you moving so that you never get kicked from the server for inactivity...
<P>If on the other hand, there are enough servers, and they assign the maximum user base for any particular server to 2000 - 3000 people, the odds will be good that you will be able to get into your server when you want to...  If you don't log in to your server for a period of time, you are set as inactive, and they then add another new person to the server...  This may work, but will require a LOT of servers from the start...  I also hope that they are localized as opposed to all in one central location.

Yesterday, our illustrius and totally infallible Gram had this to say about my dissertation on early application for EverQuest on Games.net...
</FONT>
<P>
----------
<P>
<FONT COLOR="9D0000">
Hungh??? I just figure that the submissions from gamecenter will be added to the full pool of applications, and just 
as a law of numbers, it is safe to assume that 250 will be from that submission... Who could proove them wrong, and 
who would even care or know if it was 200 or 300? All I know is that I Hope I am accepted early :)

<P>
<FONT COLOR="1B651F">
This brings to surface two important points.  1) Wayne Newton is a stinker.  2) My friend, and yours, Gram, has 
taken leave of his senses.  If the submissions from Games.net are to be added to the full pool of applications, and 
the 250 accepted users is merely a projection of how many people from Games.net will be selected from that pool, 
then that means they don't expect very many people to register from Games.net.  In fact, the number of people who 
apply early would have to be quite miniscule for this to happen.
<P>
To futher my point, I quote a clarification from Brad that was posted on <A HREF="http://www.eqvault.com">EQ 
Vault</A> yesterday...
</FONT>
<P>

<P>
<U>Clarifications[4:10 PM]</U><BR>
I have received the following information from Brad, that clarifies the situation with the applications that will be 
on games.net. They are guaranteeing 250 people that apply from games.net will get into the closed beta, not 
necessarily the first phase. Secondly, the 10000 applications was not a cap, Brad has said that more than that can 
apply.<BR>

<FONT COLOR="1B651F">
Again, the copiously absent term "<I>at least</I> 250 people" is absent, which further suggests that <I>ONLY</I> 250 
people will be selected from the early registration.  
<P>
This brings to surface two important points.  1) Ringo was not as good a drummer as everyone says he was.  2) I am
the antichrist of ratio extrapolation.  I'm telling you, until they confirm that more than 250 people may be
selected from the early registration, you're shooting yourself in the foot if you register on Thursday.  With my 
luck, they'll confirm this very thing on Saturday.  But hey, at least I have my collection of celebrity gall 
stones.

It was posted early on March 9th on the <A HREF="http://www.eqvault.com">EQ Vault</A> that 
<A HREF="HTTP://www.games.net"> Games.net</a> was getting a sneak preview EverQuest betatest signup session one day

<U>Get a Jump on the Quest</U><BR>
by Joe McCloud - posted 3/06/1998 
<P>
Registration for the first phase of EverQuest's closed beta will begin on Friday the 13th.  However, if you want to 
get an early jump on the pack, be sure to log onto Games.net this Thursday, March 12. Sony plans to accept only
10,000 qualified applicants for this cycle, 250 of which will be registrants from our site. 
<P>
<FONT COLOR="1B651F">
--(Note: He didn't say <I>at least</I> 250 qualified applicants... just 250.  Keep this in mind for later...)
</FONT>
<P>
For the first phase, Sony has stated that they will be fairly picky--looking for people who have experience playing 
online RPGs, single player RPGs, and MUDs. Also, experience in previous commercial beta tests will be a plus. During 
the open-beta phase that will follow, the requirements won't be as harsh. In fact, all who apply and don't get 
selected will be guaranteed a slot in the open beta.
<P>
Remember, applications will officially go up on the EverQuest site on Friday, March 13, but a special advanced form 
can be found on Games.net the day before.
<P>
----------
<P>
<FONT COLOR="1B651F">
Okay, let's all take a deep breath and allow the crazed fury we all feel to get out of our systems, and look at this 
whole thing with a clear head.
<P>
It says Sony Interactive will be accepting 10,000 bodies for the first cycle of testing.  Ten <I>thousand</I>.  Only
<I>two hundred and fifty</I> of which will be selected from Games.net's site.  That's a whopping <B>2.5%</B> of the 
populace Games.net will be providing for the first phase, regardless of how many people choose to take up Games.net
on their offer.
<P>
Now, you have to consider that word of this early registration will spread like wildfire, which is what Games.net
is counting on.  This early registration is a coup for them, and they know people will flock to have their 
applications considered for approval early.  This being the case, a <I>lot</I> of people will have sent in their
apps by the time SI opens the application on the EQ website on Friday.  I would go so far as to guesstimate that a 
good quarter of of all interested people will be registering early on Games.net (and that's playing it 
conservatively)... but only 250 of them will be selected.  Do you see what I'm getting at yet?  Following the very
reasonable assumption that everybody will only be allowed one (1) application per person, the horde of people 
trying to enter Games.net's early registration will have a much more difficult time trying to elbow their way into 
the 250 available slots than they would if they waited until Friday and used their single application to enter into 
one of the 9,750 remaining slots, no?
<P>
For those of you I've lost, let me lay it out.  Let's assume one million people will apply for the beta test.  Let's 
also assume that my very conservative guesstimate above is spot-on correct, and a quarter of them will be 
registering early on Thursday through Games.net.  That is 250,000 people all trying to squeeze into 250 slots that 
SI has supposedly granted to Games.net as being guaranteed picks from their registrants.  If you decide to register 
early, it means you have to surmount 1000:1 odds against being selected, weighted, of course, by your 
qualifications.  Suppose you decide to wait until Friday and register with the rest of us mortals.  This means you 
will be competing with 750,000 people for 9,750 slots, giving you a ratio of nearly 77:1 odds against being 
selected, weighted by those same qualifications.  Even if I have grossly overestimated the number of people who will 
be registering early, the numbers look decidedly better if you wait.  
<P>
Who knows?  Perhaps Joe McCloud misspoke in his artlcle, and it's really a <I>minimum</I> of 250 registrants from 
Games.net who will be selected.  Stranger things have happened.  Even so, don't you think Games.net would be 
chomping at the bit to capitalize on there being the possiblity of having even <I>more</I> than 250 registrants 
being selected from their site?
<P>
So, is it really worth it to enter your application through Games.net, just so your application is one of those that 
SI looks at first?  (An occasion I find highly dubious in the first place.)  Unless someone can prove to me that the 
registrants who fill out their applications during this "sneak preview" may also enter an additional application on 
the EQ website... well, the numbers plainly speak for themselves.  
<P>
And if it turns out that registrants <I>can</I> enter more than one application by these means, then I must say it 
would speak volumes about SI's standpoint on fair play.  
<P>
Personally, I give SI more credit than that.  So, my money is on the idea that once you've sent in your one 
application, that's all the chance you get; Games.net or no Games.net.  A level playing field.  Level, that is, as 
long as you pay attention to what you're doing.  ;)

<P><U><B>Letter to Shadoe</B></U>
<P>Greetings, readers!  
<P>I received a message in my mailbox this morning from Angus McGregor of the Clan McGregor that was most insightful.  It was in regards to my review of the chat log, and I felt inspired to share it with everyone, as he makes a valid point.
<P>And I quote...
<P>
</FONT>
----------
<P>I was browsing the latest addition to the page and noticed the chat log. I was there during it, and had a particular line that Brad said, bring horror to my eyes.. Here, take a look at this.
<P>&lt;Relay2&gt; &lt;Aegwyn&gt; Im asking this again in case you lost it with all them disconnects... Will there be strenght limits on weapons and armor? to balance out the game. Haveing powerful mages with very powerful armor is not good, and will your hands have to be empty to cast spells?
<BR>&lt;DrBunny&gt; There will be limits to who can wield and use different times, and this is indeed to balance the game. To cast spells you do not have to remove the weapons in your hands."

<P>Imagine my suprise when I saw this line. You do NOT have to remove weapons to cast spells? In my opinion, this does not set well.. I thought we were trying to get away from the Warrior/Mage syndrome of UO?  If this is the truth, and not a mistype, then I fear the game will not be near as fun as it could...
<P>I thought you might be able to get a bit more insight, as I think you might have missed this particular line on the chat log. It seems you are pretty much on par with Gram as far as gaming goes, which pretty much makes me the same.. I have a feeling this will concern you also. Perhaps you can post this on the site and see if you can get any responses to the question.

<P>Thanks, and once again, well met.
<P>Angus McGregor
<BR>-Clan McGregor
<P>----------
<P>
<FONT COLOR="1B651F">
First off, thanks for writing, Angus!
<P>Actually, I <I>did</I> see that line, and it caused me some distress at first.  I don't like the idea of magic-users being able to cast spells at will, while fully equipped with an M-16, or equivalent weapon, pointed at your head as well.  It seemed wreckless, and an unwise thing to do on SI's part, considering the character class system.
<P>I was about to comment on it, when I reread what Brad said about limiting what class can wield and use which items.  Reflecting back on my AD&D games, I remember how many weapons a wizard could use... I can count them on my left hand.  Predominantly, all they could use were daggers (depending on your DM's particular deviation of the rules).  I know I may be assuming a lot, but my guess is that Brad and the team have made it so that wizards in EQ have roughly the same level of restriction.
<P>This being so, a wizard's ability to defend him- or herself by non-magical means is limited to begin with.  We haven't been told a great deal about how magic is going to work in EQ, but assuming there's a time delay in spellcasting, coupled with the idea that a magic-user must have their hands free to cast the spell, they would end up being at the mercy of their opponent for this span of time.
<P>Conversely, if they were allowed to have their little dagger in-hand while casting spells, it at least provides them a means of keeping the enemy at bay (barely) until their spell is completed.  To me, this allows for a greater balance of power overall.  On one side, the wizard isn't helpless during spellcasting, and on the other side the opponent isn't attacked by an enormous Two-Handed Sword Of Ultimate Death while being bombarded by fireballs either.
<P>This, I believe, is why weapons can be equipped during spellcasting in EverQuest.  In Ultima Online, where equippability of items rests soley on strength, it results in the warrior/mage character stigma we're all painfully familiar with.  In the case of EQ, where item equippability is determined by class, level, race, and eyebrow color, I think it will be sufficient to keep the classes seperate from each other.
<P>Again, good point Angus.  I probably should have written this in the first place, but chose not to because I decided it wasn't a problem after all.  Thanks!

<P>Good points...
<P>I guess the thing that concerns me the most is the class limitations that will be imposed.  In UO they always claimed that they wanted RolePlaying, but did NOTHING to enforce or promote it...  Other than Skill / Stat Caps???
<P>I think that there should be DISTINCT advantages / disadvantages to certain equipment.  There is NO WAY that someone clad in Full Platemail should be able to run or move as quickly as someone in leather or no armour at all.
<P>A Magic User should not be able to wear restrictive armour.  It's supposed to be hard to become a powerful mage...  But the rewards for making it should be equaly as strong.
<P>I think that casting with items equipped is wrong, but once again it does depend on what items that mage is allowed to equip in the first place.  Since you probably won't be able to "auto cast" when you get dropped from the server, some sort of defense is in order.
<P>Gram!!!

<P>It's been a while since my last update...  Sorry about that, but I've been working myself silly (er?) with putting together my initial Beta release of <I><B>SmartEdit</B></I>, my Website Project Manager / HTML Editor.  Which, by the way, I'm pleased to say is a GREAT program.  I have been using it to edit / modify all of gramsplace for the past 2 months, and a number of my commercial websites.

<P>On to EQ News...
<P>Shadoe just sent me his take on the most recent EQ Chat Session.

<B>3/2/98 EQ Chat Log Review</B><BR>
By &lt;Shadoe&gt;
<P>Okay, enough of this "no news is frustrating news" garbage we've had to endure for the last couple of weeks.  We finally have more info to work with, courtesy of the latest EQ Chat that took place on the 2nd day of this month.  I will be reviewing it, along with my own marginal opinions and comments.  For those of you who're familiar with my earlier postings, let me reassure you this is <U>not</U> a flame... just some thoughts of mine regarding a few choice answers to the questions.
<P>Please note that I will often be making comparisons between EQ prophecy and UO reality, and that's probably very untoward of me to do, considering how different the two games are going to be on many levels.  Nevertheless, Ultima Online is the only real "control" for this "experiment," so naturally it will be the standard against which EQ's success/failure is measured.  What I'm trying to say is if anyone has a problem with that, I suggest they put their fingers in their ears and hum really loud.
<P>So, without further delay...
</FONT>
<P>----------
<P>&lt;Soltan&gt; First of all, I'd like to welcome Aradune to one of our chats again<BR>
&lt;Soltan&gt; and thank him for coming<BR>
&lt;Soltan&gt; Let me explain how the chat works<BR>
&lt;Soltan&gt; The people named Relay are the ones who will relay questions to the channel<BR>
&lt;Soltan&gt; Please message them with your questions<BR>
&lt;Soltan&gt; Not me or the other ops :)<BR>
&lt;Soltan&gt; try not to ask questions that have been answered previously<BR>
&lt;Soltan&gt; and have fun<BR>
&lt;Soltan&gt; Again, welcome Aradune<BR>
&lt;Relay1&gt; Let's go. :)<BR>
&lt;Aradune&gt; Please don't send me direct messages guys -- I just really don't have time to respond.<BR>
&lt;Relay1&gt; *Brandon-1* Approximately how many phases will there be?  How long do you think these phases will be?<BR>
<P>*At this point Aradune gets Nuked by some UO fan =)... so we have to wait a bit while we get him hooked up w/ a secure connection...*<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="1B651F">
--(...and who says UO players are immature?  Okay, okay, cheap shot, I know.)
</FONT>

<P>&lt;RaV&gt; we are putting Aradune on a safe connection.<BR>
&lt;BlkStaff&gt; ok<BR>
&lt;BlkStaff&gt; he is set<BR>
&lt;Soltan&gt; Please message them with your questions<BR>
&lt;Soltan&gt; Also, keep nick changs down to the barest of minimums<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; We really have no idea how many phases there will be -- as many as necessary.  We will test certain aspects of the game with one phase, and when that's finished, we'll move on to the next.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="1B651F">
--(This sounds dangerously familiar... though I still remain hopeful that Sony Interactive has what it takes to do things right.)
</FONT>

<P>&lt;Relay2&gt; *Thayer* Are the classes of magic in EverQuest individual to each class that uses them? For example, can any class learn from 2 different classes of magic?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; As to how long they'll be -- well, until we've tested what we've wanted to for that phase.  There is really no way to predict this stuff accurately ahead of time.<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; Most of the spells are unique to that class, however there is some overlap.  For instance, both a cleric and a shaman can cast healing spells.  The exact nature of these spells and their names might be different though.<BR>
&lt;Relay3&gt;  &lt;Artagel&gt; How much AI will monsters have? Such as pack movements.<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; The AI is pretty sophisticated depending upon the intelligence of the monsters or other creatures involved.  Groups of monsters will act like packs and attack that way as well.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="1F651B">
--(Again, very familiar words.  "Open mind, Shadoe, open mind...")
</FONT>

<P>&lt;Relay4&gt; *Brandon-1* Can you give us an approxima<BR>
&lt;Relay4&gt; al, or will updates require periodic downloads?<BR>
&lt;Relay4&gt; *EB_Ueser* Does the new modeling system allow for gulid skins or are you going to wait till post ship to impliment that (if ever)?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; The new modeling system does indeed allow for guild skins and it is our intent to support those at ship, not after.  How many guilds we can support though is still undetermined.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="1F651B">
--(This, I don't know <I>how</I> they plan on pulling off.  If the number of guilds in Ultima Online is any indication of the massive number of skin graphics they're going to have to include in EQ, then the minimum client hard drive space required just shot up to about 2 gigs.  Perhaps if they had a minimum number of guild membership enrollments in order for a guild to qualify for a skin, that would keep it to a sane level.)
</FONT>

<P>&lt;Relay5&gt; *FL_Oghma* Could you tell us more about how exp will be used to buy levels, stats, or skills?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; Experience isn't used to buy skills or stats per se.  Your skills go up as you use them, but they can only go up so much per level, and then also at certain levels you are allowed to learn new skills.<BR>
&lt;Relay1&gt; *UW_Iimz* Hail Arudane, What will be one of the main trouble spots that you will ask the first beta testers to focus on?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; Probably the stability of the client, our servers, and the network portion of the code.<BR>
&lt;Relay2&gt; *Brandon-1*  Will Monsters gain experience?  Will they be tougher in their native habitats?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; Monsters don't gain experience, no, but they will fight differently depending on the terrain and time of day. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="1F651B">
--(This I <I>gotta</I> see!)
</FONT>

<P>&lt;Relay3&gt; &lt;FL_Ingwe&gt; what (if any) innate abilites does the ogre have besides pure strength and stamina?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; I'll give you two -- the ability to body slam their opponent, and also bash doors. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="1F651B">
--(Looks like the ogre will be a popular race among the players.  More so than I thought at first.)
</FONT>
<P>&lt;Relay5&gt; *IW_Tallis* Do you intend to allow for voulenteer GM's who can lead their friends on quests, or will it be your hired ones only?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; At this point the plan is to allow some members of the public to be GMs, but I doubt at the same level of access and abilities as those who are Sony Employees.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="1F651B">
--(Whoa, hang on here for a second.  GM players?  Hmmmm... does this bode well?  I have to say, this makes me a tad uneasy, unless they intend to give these player GMs roughly the same power as counselors in UO... in which case they're basically powerless to effect any real change in the game, which further means they're not much of a GM, are they?  Needless to say, this whole idea raises my eyebrow when it comes to its dubious wisdom.)
</FONT>
<P>&lt;Relay1&gt; *Jaxom* What are your strategies for preventing "topping-out" with experience points?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; At this point experience caps aren't planned, however it will become harder and harder to make levels, so it should take some time to reach higher levels.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="1F651B">
--(Yes, this is a good thing.  Especially when you consider that a lot of the checks and balances in the game will be implemented by restrictions between the classes and races.  You can have a totally badass wizard human, but besting an equally badass warrior troll can be questionable, all things considered.)
</FONT>
<P>&lt;Relay2&gt; *Brandon-1* Will quests be reserved for larger guilds, or will we see NPC dictated adventure for those who opt for a party-based system?<BR>
&lt;Relay4&gt; Please only send questions to 1 relay only please<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; There will be plenty of quests for all sorts of people, whether individual, or in parties, or members of large guilds.  As for GM run quests, we don't have infinite time and resources, so these will be limited, but not necessarily limited only to guilds. <BR>
&lt;Relay3&gt; &lt;Aegwyn&gt; Brad, Do you plan on having all races and classes in the first phases? or do you plan to only have a couple at first?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; All races and classes.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="1F651B">
--(Whew!  I stayed up nights paralyzed in cold sweats worrying about that very issue.)
</FONT>
<P>&lt;Relay4&gt; *Deathhound* Brad will there be player owned vendors in the game and will they have a weight and item limit<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; We think a significant portion of the economy will be people who buy, sell, and trade in towns and elsewhere.  We don't feel we need to make them merchants 'officially' for them do be able to do this, nor do they require any additional abilities.  Basically, anyone can be a merchant or a vendor.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="1F651B">
--(This question was either very deftly dodged by Brad, or he didn't fully comprehend it at the time.  Either way, I get the distinct impression that the economy system in EQ isn't going to be as touchy as it is in Ultima Online.  In short, it's not that pivotal to the rest of the game.  Still the question remains, will player characters be able to hire NPCs for purposes of sales and mercenary work?  I don't recall reading about this in any FAQs.)
</FONT>
<P>&lt;Relay5&gt; *Whiskey1* There is a lot of oceans in Norrath. Will there be an opportunity for pirating and/or ship-to-ship combat?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; Can't go into details on ships at this point, sorry. <BR>
&lt;Relay2&gt; *Thayer* How will repopulation of NPC's and Monsters be accomplished? Are measures in place to assure that a Monster doesn't just "respawn" next to someone and attack?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; The repopulation portion of the server is very robust, and we can set an NPC to not repop if anyone else is around.  But then that's not always a bad thing in my opinion, so some NPCs might pop near players. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="1F651B">
--(Since spawn rates and methods were such a peeve with UO in the beginning, I'm very curious to see what SI has up its sleeve [if anything])
</FONT>
<P>&lt;Relay1&gt; *FL_Kickah* We have heard alot about capping the player population at 1000 per server.  Any idea about how many "on line" GMs you will have on duty during peak hours?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; No idea at this point -- that's the kind of thing we will determine toward the end of beta. <BR>
&lt;Relay3&gt;  *FL_Zealot* How severe will the NDA be? For example, can we maintain journals of our beta adventures if we do not make specific technical references or include pictures?<BR>
&lt;Relay3&gt; *I'd like to remind people not to send messages to EVERY RELAY, it makes us have to sort through them for duplicates*<BR>
&lt;Relay4&gt; and i hate sorting<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; the NDA for the first few phases will have to be very strict, which means no information regarding the game can be published.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="1F651B">
--(Ouch!  They must have an <I>extremely</I> strict filtering method for the first few betas, if they intend to keep a lid on its goings on.  Can they really enforce this?  I have misgivings that they can.)
</FONT>
<P>&lt;Relay4&gt; *EoNXaphoo* Mr. McQuaid: Will Everquest allow rogues or perhaps other classes to use aliases or change their names or appearance? Perhaps through a skill?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; We're working on something like that, but aren't sure if it will make it in the first release.<BR>
&lt;Relay4&gt; *Ziv* Can a chars house be damaged or looted when the char is offline, such as in a raid?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; A house or hall is only as safe as you make it. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="1F651B">
--(Very safe answer... I'm impressed.  Eat your heart out, OSI!)
</FONT>
<P>&lt;Relay5&gt;  *aocdaddyC* Are horses yet created as a means of travel. And if not, have you ever considered the possibility of dragon travel. This also opens the option of Air-to-air combat<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; Horses are still an unknown at this point. I'd have to say air to air combat and dragon riding won't be in.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="1F651B">
--(I hope this settles things for those shmucks who kept devoutly proclaiming all during UO's pre-beta days that they were going to tame a dragon and ride on its back as it flew them all over Britannia.)
</FONT>
<P>&lt;Relay1&gt; *Strife|* I see a resemblance to TorilMUD in Everquest, was it one of the places you got ideas from?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; We have a team with a lot of background in all sorts of RPGs and MUDs, and have played many, including Toril. <BR>
&lt;Relay2&gt; *DarkAnvil* Are you guys gonna try to make sure that every class is equal and has the same advantages? In alot of games magery has been the most powerful skill and over shadows others<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; game balance is very important to us, including class balancing.  We want to make sure all of the classes have compelling reasons behind them to play them, and want to make sure they are all useful in the game. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="1F651B">
--("Brad?  I miss Ultima Online, and I feel no need for any sort of diversity.  So, could I be a human warrior/mage who can wear a complete suit of plate armor, and still cast every spell in the book?  Please??")
</FONT>
<P>&lt;Relay3&gt; *EoNJarr0d* It seems so far that a lot of people are comparing EQ to Ultima Online.  Well, i don't like that.  But my question is, how can EverQuest improve on Ultima Online since UO is currently the leading online game of the era?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; It is not our intent to 'improve' upon UO, since our game isn't based on UO.  Certainly we would be foolish not to learn from our competitors strengths and weaknesses, however EverQuest is a different game than UO.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="1F651B">
--(If Brad had responded any other way to this question, I would have fainted dead away.)
</FONT>
<P>&lt;Relay4&gt; *aocdaddyC* keyboards and mouses are good, though can joysticks work as well<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; No immediate plans to support joysticks, but I wouldn't rule it out.  We are supporting mouse and keyboard currently, but are looking into other devices. *done*<BR>
&lt;Relay5&gt; *AzIoM* How is the gameplay going to be thru a 28.8 connection? I have played all the online rpgs and the lag seems to be a big problem. Do you think EQ is going to be better in terms of 'lag' than say ultima online currently is?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; I don't think most of the lag people are experiencing on these games is because they are using a 28.8. It's usually either server based lagged or their ISPs, or somewhere in the ineternet between them and the servers.  We are designed the game such that we aren't sending out more data than a 28.8 can handle.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="1F651B">
--(Hmmm... kinda makes you feel good about having bought that 56k modem specifically for playing online games, doesn't it?)
</FONT>
<P>&lt;DrBunny&gt; We are doing several things to reduce lag, including using very mature network code (decended from our Tanarus game), as well as keeping the number of people down per server, to reduce server lag.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="1F651B">
--(Okay, I know there are about three gazillion players out there who are going to protest having to wait their turn to log into the EQ server[s].  I'd be interested in seeing, by a raise of hands, how many people think it would be worth it paying this price to eliminate any sign of server-side lag, and how long they think is too much time to wait.  Maybe that would be a good question for EQ Vault's Poll Station, no?  Personally, I don't think I'd have a problem waiting for 5-7 minutes to play. <B>BUT</B>, it's not as simple as that.  What happens to people who are accidentally cut off from the game?  Once booted, do they have to wait in line again, just so they can rejoin their adventuring party?  My guess is that if they manage to reconnect within the 5 minute [?] timeout for their characters, they would be allowed to jump right back in.  That's just speculation on my part, but it's plausible enough.)
</FONT>
<P>&lt;Relay1&gt; *Nite* will monks/martial artists all have the samle fighting and ability skills? or will there be differences attributable to diferent "styles" of fighting with differing specialites based on style?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; I think what you are asking is whether their will be sub-classes, in particular sub-classes for the monk class.  At this time we aren't planning to include sub-classes for the release of the game. <BR>
&lt;Relay2&gt; &lt;Slade&gt;  Beta Testing: when, where, how... what can you tell us?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; The applications will be up within the next couple of weeks, but as to when the actual tests will start, all I can say is when we are ready.  We're trying not to rush things so we can do it right, however we are working long and hard to get the game to a point where it's testable by people outside Sony. <BR>
&lt;Relay3&gt; [19:41] *EoNJarr0d* How can EQ ensure an equal playing ground for all players including those who are joining in for the first time but considerably after the game is established?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; I'm not sure what you're asking there -- are you refering to advantages a long time player, or a player who plays many hours, has over a newbie?  Please rephrase the question and moderators please ask it again. *done*<BR>
&lt;Relay4&gt; *FL_stump* will hybrid races be able to cast their respective spells with weapons armed? &lt; free to dodge if need be:)&gt;<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; You don't have to remove your weapons to cast a spell, no.<BR>
&lt;Relay5&gt; *Og`* Alot of debate has been brought up about how hard it will be do raise skillz ect, how will skillz be raised?  Will it be on a level/distribute points scale or more along the lines of practice alot while you level?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; Your skills go up as you use them, but they can only go up so much per level, and certain skills won't be available to the player until he reaches certain levels. <BR>
&lt;Relay1&gt; *DolemiteO* does everquest have an advanced physics system, where a "cold" spell will freeze water, or a "heat" based spell possibly burn items, such as pants<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; The physics system is very robust, however objects in the world do not freeze or burn as you describe.<BR>
&lt;Relay2&gt; &lt;EB_Ueser&gt;  Can you comment on the availablity of boats and houses? Will they be in the individual ownershop or guild only price range?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; I don't want to say 'guild only', but they will be very expensive and you won't see many who have them -- boats and houses are exotic items in EverQuest, something you'll have to work hard and long for and can be very proud of owning.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="1F651B">
--(Another thing that makes you go "hmmmm."  I got the same impression about boats and houses in UO during its pre-beta days.  But contrary to that, nowadays Britannia more resembles a thriving metropolis on some shards.  Let's hope SI can deliver on what Brad's saying here.)
</FONT>
<P>&lt;Relay4&gt; *SirDash* Will combat be conducted in a 3d shooter style manner or in a UO style where you simply double click to attack and let the ai take over<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; Closer to the UO style, because this is not a 'twitch' game, but not identical to UO either. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="1F651B">
--(I have to admit, this answer has me curious.)
</FONT>
<P>&lt;Relay5&gt; *aocSmegal* If Everquest sells well in the Asia/Pacific area, or anywhere outside of USA will there be servers put up in those regions or will they be given the shaft ala EA with UO?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; At this point it's too early to commit to servers outside the US, but we are definitely looking into it and want international players to enjoy the world of EverQuest as well.<BR>
&lt;Relay1&gt; *Reefer* How will the money system work? IE just gold, or Gold, silver, and copper, all of certain worths?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; Several types of coins, with different worths.  Also, some gems and such. *done*<BR>
&lt;Relay2&gt; &lt;Ziv&gt;  Brad, will there be small scattered islands surrounding the larger continents, or just 1 or 2 islands?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; I suggest you explore the world and find out -- I don't want to take away the surprise and fun of exploration. <BR>
&lt;Relay3&gt; *Tarans* Earlier Someone asked about ogres innate abilitys Will you be able to Devulge Other abilitys for the other races? (maybe just a few??)<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; I'll release a few skills and spells here and there until we are much closer to open beta, but don't expect anywhere's near a complete list. *done*<BR>
&lt;Relay4&gt; *Plug* Will the programmers actually play the game or will they just take input from their "playing" designers?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; When I assembled the team I made sure many of the artists, programmers, and world builders were into this genre.  The entire team's input counts and they've all contributed to this game quite a bit.  Accordingly I wouldn't be a bit surprised to see most all of them play the game quite often.  This is a game we've all wanted to make and PLAY for many years.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="1F651B">
--(I wonder if the UO design team has any interest in playing their game, for its own sake?  Anyone?  Anyone?)
</FONT>
<P>&lt;Relay5&gt; *IPASpro* what will happen if you die? do you ressurect instantly, have to look for a healer or do something else?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; Not going to go into details on death at this point other than to say it's not permanent, but there will be significant penalities, such that you won't want to take dying lightly. <BR>
&lt;Relay1&gt; *|Rayne* How to do intend to build an online cohesive society in EverQuest? What elements do you think will add to this environment?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; I think the focus we have on this not just being a player vs. player game but rather also a very cooperative game will help build a sense of community.  Allowing people to group, to talk to other party members, and to talk to people regardless of where they are will help this.  And the ability to split experience amongst a group will add to this as well.  Also, keeping the server population down will enable people to recognize names more easily.<BR>
&lt;Relay2&gt; &lt;Van88&gt;  Will you be able to have striped or streaked hair? Or hair of different color like Pink or Green<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; You can choose several options when you create your character, but within certain limits, those limits usually pertaining to the race you've chosen.  An example, a troll's skin is green, so you won't find pink trolls running around. <BR>
&lt;Relay3&gt; *Doomslaye* Will there be unique items, such that only one or a few people will have them? And also, are magic items <BR>
&lt;Relay3&gt; in general in abundance or scarce?<BR>
&lt;Relay3&gt; STOP DCC CHATTING THE RELAYS<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; There will be unique items called artifacts and I don't expect too many people to be awarded them, but please feel free to prove me wrong :).  As for magical items, yes, many.  A significant part of EQ is the ammassing of magical items with all sorts of nifty abilities. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="1F651B">
--(Hey, Moorcock fans... how about the first 20 players to log on to EQ gets their own artifact sword named "Stormbringer?"  Woo hoo!)
</FONT>
<P>&lt;Relay5&gt; *EB_Ueser* How much will the God you chose to warship affect your character. Is spirituality just a role-playing guideline like alignment or does it have in-game effects (diferent blessings from diferent gods)?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; It definitely affects your player in the game. <BR>
&lt;Relay1&gt; *WarDragon* I was wondering if houses are *WarDragon* I was wondering if houses are restricted to certain areas.  Also, will you be abel to set restrictions on who can enter the house?  <BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; Let me say this about houses -- you won't find them scattered arbitrarily all over the world. <BR>
&lt;Relay2&gt; &lt;Aegwyn&gt;  Im asking this again in case you lost it with all them disconnects... Will there be strenght limits on weapons and armor? to balance out the game. Haveing powerful mages with very powerful armor is not good, and will your hands have to be empty to cast spells?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; There will be limits to who can wield and use different times, and this is indeed to balance the game.  To cast spells you do not have to remove the weapons in your hands. <BR>
&lt;Relay3&gt; *MPOGNews* When people talk in Everquest will the text go above there heads or on a chatscreen? I think it would be <BR>
&lt;Relay3&gt; good if there was a chatscreen but have it so that you only hear the closest 12 or so people on the screen. I think that <BR>
&lt;Relay3&gt; would be better than it appearing over there heads as they walk around. Thanks.<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; There is a chat screen under the 3d view -- messages do not appear above player's heads.  One of the reasons for this (but there are many) is that you can receive 'tells' from people anywhere in the world, not just people in your view. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="1F651B">
--(I wonder if MPOGNews ever used Worlds Chat?  ;)
</FONT>
<P>&lt;Relay4&gt; *Og`* Will there be a "decay" rate, as in certain items only last so long?  This would prevent certain ppl from having the "invincible" set of eq and require them to actually go out and get it again?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; No Comment<BR>
&lt;Relay5&gt; *Whiskey1* Will rivers be barriers to travel without swim skill? If so, will bridges/ferrys come into play? (As strategic chokepoints)<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; There will be ferrys and bridges and you can swim. <BR>
&lt;Relay2&gt; &lt;DuneBug21&gt;  2 questions. Will you be able to hire guards (NPCs) to guard your hosue or boats? can you put a boat somewhere where it can be safe? (harbor)<BR>
&lt;Relay2&gt; &lt;DuneBug21&gt;  question2<BR>
&lt;Relay2&gt; &lt;DuneBug21&gt;  how much gold will a first lvl monster give you about? how much is the most one will give?(any lvl) and then how much would a boat or house cost right now?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; It wouldn't be beneficial you tell you gold amounts, because you have nothing to relate the number to, and also because costs and values of things will change drastically during testing.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="1F651B">
--(I just love questions like this question #2.  Brad could have come out and said, point-blank, that houses cost anywhere from 100 to 350 gold Qeynos duckets, and the asker would be no closer to knowing how much they really cost than he was before he asked the question.  Can you say "aspiring vice-presidential candidate?")
</FONT>
<P>&lt;Relay3&gt;  *Kuno* will the game have weather affects? if so, will the terrain and its surrounding change with the weather?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; There will be weather effects, including rain and snow, and they will change the physics model of the area you are in.  An example: surfaces will become slippery when it snows. <BR>
&lt;Relay4&gt; *Abzzstain* Will there be an "official" EQ-sponsored board/messaging system for roleplay stories, etc., or will it all need to be done on private sites?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; So far the unofficial sites are doing a great job and service to the EQ community, providing message boards and other useful tools and info to people interested in this game. <BR>

<P>&lt;Relay1&gt; *LoMax`* If the game is hackable, how will the hackers be dealt with, if caught?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; They will be banned from the game, and we will look into legal courses of action as well. <BR>

<P>&lt;Relay2&gt; &lt;EB_Trint&gt;  Will characters be able to choose their starting location or will that be determinded by race?<BR>
&lt;Relay2&gt; &lt;EB_Trint&gt;  Are all elves able to see in the dark or just Dark Elfs?<BR>
&lt;Relay2&gt; &lt;EB_Trint&gt;  Will their be different weapons based on race?  ie: A dwarven Axe or an Elven Bow?<BR>
&lt;Relay2&gt; &lt;EB_Trint&gt;  If your skills go up only so much per level, how will you go up in level, will a message pop up saying "You have just gone up in level"??<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; It is determined by race, however some races are more flexible than other in terms of where they can begin in the world.<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; Elves in general are able to see in the dark.  And items can be restricted to certain races, classes, etc. <BR>
&lt;Relay3&gt; [20:38] *FL_Zass_* Will two weapon fighting be limited to the warrior/ranger class, or will it be availible to a wider range of classes (rogues and paladins?)<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; Depends on how testing goes -- if one class is determined to be too weak, we might add more skills and abilities to that class.  So it's really too early to say exactly which races and classes will have what abilities and skills, other than a few general and obvious ones. <BR>
&lt;Relay4&gt; *Og`* Will there be a "rent" system?  As to where you must rent whatever you have when you logout in an town inn, the more powerful the object the higher rent ect?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; You can rent at inns, and camp in the wilderness.  As for upkeeps for your equipment, that is undetermined at this time. <BR>
&lt;Relay5&gt; *WarDragon* Are boats hollow? i.e wil things be able to be stowed away below deck, and will you be able to go down into the boat?<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; The larger ships are indeed explorable and have rooms and such.<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; I hope we did better this month, and I'll see you next month.<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; Also, please be sure to fill out the applications for beta coming in the next couple of weeks.<BR>
&lt;DrBunny&gt; Remember that everyone who fills out an app is guaranteed into the last phase of the closed beta.<BR>

<P>Greets, all!

<P>I'm telling you, it's so great to be a contributor to Gram's Place, I'm totally
discombobulated.  Being able to rant and rave over the latest games offers so many
opportunities for me (like finding out what "discombobulated" means) that I'm beside myself
with glee.  I'd like to thank Gram for bringing me on board, but I'm too busy venting my
opinion for that right now.  :P

<P>Anyway, as with my previous posts to Gram's UO Page, expect me to call 'em as I see 'em.
Please be patient with my "humble" opinions, as I know I'm going to end up enraging many
otherwise decent citizens out there.  I know Gram and I aren't going to see things eye-to-eye
100% of the time, but that can only make for some really good reading for all of us... as
long as we keep it in context, and remember who is always right! <font color="#9D0000">(Yeah... It's Gram :)</FONT>

<P>Here's a little background about me, just so you know who you're bitching to when the
occasional rant of mine goes awry.  I'm 26, a computer programmer and 3D graphic artist, and
I have been playing computer games since I was old enough to reach the knobs on my parents'
"Pong" system.  I've been a fan of role-playing since the old paper Dungeons & Dragons game,
and have saved the universe on a number of occasions in virtual reality.  The advent of this
new gaming genre called "massively multiplayer role-playing" is so exciting, I just don't
know what to do with myself -- especially since I've cancelled my Ultima Online account.

<P>That's it for now.  Expect the occasional critique and editorial from yours truly, along with
some follow-up comments I feel compelled to make on what Gram says from time to time.  Though
I may seem harsh and super-critical on a lot of issues, keep in mind that deep down inside
I'm just a sociopath trapped in a really bad Michael Crichton novel.  Later.

<P>AN ANTI-PKILLER'S FLAME
<BR>By Shadoe

<P>By now, I think everyone has been made very well aware about how Gram and I feel about player
killers.  But for those of you who are unfamilliar with the position we've taken on this
issue, I will reiterate...

<P>Player killers are scum!  They deserve nothing less than to be executed horrifically by
papercuts and hangnails!  The people who pursue this kind of lowlife, egocentrical,
brain-cell deteriorating behavior should all be given wedgies by a very large behemoth!  In
short, they must all suffer and perish from the face of gaming.

<P>Okay, so that's not QUITE the way I'd put it, myself.  Player killers (as in, "players who
consistently murder other players' characters for fun and profit") can legitimately serve the
purpose of adding to a role-playing world as long as they play their part.  I concede this
fact as being the truth every bit as much as I concede the fact that a dragon is easier to
kill than, say, *two* dragons.

<P>My problem with these people lies within certain boundaries, of which I will show you by
critiquing an article posted in issue 10 of the EverQuest Express online newsletter.  Staying
true to form, I will quote the original document followed by my own usual insightful, and
often wise-ass comments in parhentheses...

<P>A PKILLER'S STORY
<BR>written by "Thumper"

<P>I dont mean to compare Everquest to Ultima Online by any means, but the two do have one
thing in common, the ability for players to interact with and even kill other human players.
Of course this  type of "anti-social" behavior is discouraged by in-game rules yet just about
everyone hates Player-Killers, claiming that we do not role-play, that we abuse bugs, and
some will even out right say that we cheat. This is incorrect for most of us, but yes there
are some who cheat and do other out of game things to kill, but
that is only a very small percentage. It is very insulting, not to mention inaccurate, to
stereotype EVERY pkiller based upon the actions of such a small percentage. Lend me your ear
and allow me to tell my story. 

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-- (Whoa, wait just a second!  A "very small" percentage??  Care to back this up by giving us
some statistics?  In my own experience, most pkillers care nothing for the game's sake.  All
they are interested in is acquiring stats to kill more people with, and wealth to buy that
way cool castle, by whatever means they can.  If they DID care about the game itself, they
wouldn't march right up to people, kill them, loot their corpses, and walk off without so
much as an evil chuckle.  Don't try to deny it, it's the truth that the vast majority of
player killer incidents are executed this way... and more often than not, if they have to
exploit a bug to do it, well, that's fair game because ANYONE can do these things.  All they
have to do is figure out how, right?)</FONT>

<P>I have several on-line friends that date back to the BBS days. On and off we would play
on-line games together, mainly Subspace. When we heard about UO we were all quite excited,
and somebody came up with the name Inner Circle. A name that would soon be widely known,
feared by the masses, and respected by even the strongest most cunning warrior/mages of the
land. 

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-- (Inner Circle?  Never heard of 'em.  *shrug*)</font>

<P>When we actually received our beta CDs we were all excited beyond belief, well, at least I
was. The beta basically sucked at first, but hey, it was a beta, so nobody was too upset.
Everybody basically did their own things, I was busy between character wipes trying to get a
good combination of skills that would help me get off to a good financial start. Others would
spend a lot of time sparing to get their fighting skills high. 

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">--- (Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz...)</font>

<P>When the time came for the release of UO, we had all figured out which skills we needed to
start with, and which skills could be quickly learned.  We learned how to advance our
physical bodies, but it takes brains as well as brawn to be IC. It was a learning experience,
being able to kill without yourself being killed when outnumbered 2 to 1 is not an easy task,
but it is one IC excelled at. 

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-- (Double-zzzzzzzzzz...)</font>

<P>Now I can almost hear the skeptics "BS, you IC guys just killed everybody you saw". That is
true, but we would hang out somewhere, killing just about everybody who came our way until
eventually a group would form to try to kill us. It was at this point we were out numbered,
but we were still on the offensive. These were the glorious battles that we thrived upon;
these were the battles where IC proved its domination with superior tactics

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-- (Yeah, sure... that and the fact that in Ultima Online, player killers have a natural
tendency to advance quicker than everyone else.  Not to mention that mob tactics work
extremely well in ANY scenario.  And don't hand me this "2:1 against" ratio garbage.  The
only thing it proves is either you only preyed on very weak groups of people, or you're a
habitual liar...)</font>

<P>Many say that we just killed newbies, but that is incorrect.  Early after the release when
you could double click on a person and see their skill level, profession and notoriety (i.e.
The Dread Lord Thumper Grandmaster Mage, or Fred Neophyte Scholar). In those days we tried
not to kill newbies, unless of course they were being annoying or trying to loot our kills. 

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-- (...Well, I guess that answers that.)</font>

<P>Hell, we used  to let newbies hang around to carry off the loot we didnt want or could
carry. 

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-- (Very magnanimous of you.  I'm surprised you don't call yourselves "Robin Hood and His
Merry Men [In Tights].")</font>

<P>But for some strange reason OSI felt that the game would be better if nobody could tell the
difference between a Neophyte and a Grand Master. At that time we still tried not to kill
newbies, but people took advantage of that, and would dress in leather armor, or even just a
death robe, and try to sneak attack us while we were not paying attention. Well after we were
ambushed a few times by this tactic we were forced to kill everything around us. 

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-- (How you must have suffered.)</font>

<P>Many anit-pkillers say that we dont role-play, allow me to give you an example of how we
role-play. Babamonkey, fellow IC member, was friends with Milamber, leader of "The Band".
Well, TB didnt like IC, except for Milamber. One day me, Baba, and Mox (another IC) ran into
Milamber and a few other TB guys outside of their guild HQ. As was standard operating
procedure me and Mox jumped in, killing two before Baba was able to get us to stop. Me and
Mox apologized to Milamber for attacking him and his little 5 man
group because we didnt know that he was friends with Baba, then resurrected his fallen
guildmates. evidentially the TB guys got in IRC and called in more reinforcements because
within just a few minutes we
were surrounded by what seemed to be their entire guild. Milamber was being cool, he
understood it was just a misunderstanding and nobody was any worse off, but the other guys
really wanted to kill us. We
called for reinforcements so 2 other IC guys show up. Now we are only outnumbered 15 to 5.
Once we had 5 IC guys there TB was giving us a little more space, but we could all tell they
were itching to jump us, but they knew that without Milambers help they would be slaughtered.
We stood our ground, we didnt attempt to flee, honestly I believe we could have taken them
all, Milamber would have been the only one that was a threat, but Baba assured us that he
would take no action against us. Without Milambers help they wouldnt
attack. A couple of them would talk trash occasionally, but Milamber was quick to put them in
line. About that time the server crashed. But as you can see from this one little example, we
did more than just kill, its just that only a select few ever lived long enough to see us
long to see us role-play. 

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-- (Let me get this straight... you equate a FUBARed guild battle to role-playing?  Give us
an inch of credit, why dont you?  And while we're on the subject of your little annecdote, I
have to say I would bet the farm that The Band tells an entirely different story from the one
you just told.)</font>
<P><font color="#9D0000">Um...  Maybe I missed something, but I don't get the point of that whole story???  
How is that supposed to demonstrate that you RolePlay?  Sounds to me like you stormed a house, killed a few 
people without warning, saw a buddy of yours and started chatting...  Ya rez'd the guys that you killed who then
called a bunch of their buddies via IRC or ICQ.  You called some more of your buddies, then ya all stood around chatting because your buddy (who was in the other guild)
wouldn't fight you (a guild that his guild was at war with), and all of the other guys were too chicken to fight you themselves.
<P>If you were RolePlaying a bunch of L.A. Gangbangers with CellPhones...  That I'd buy, but your actions were completely out of context 
within the realm of UO.
<P>The ONLY thing that this story demonstrated is that you don't kill EVERYONE that you see, but only if they are with one of your buddies.
</font>

<P>Most say we dont role-play because all we do is kill.  Unless you were one of the strongest
players in the
game, wed rather kill you than give you the time of day. We are ruthless, we are the thing
in the shadows
that you fear, we are the evil scourge that plagues the land. If we have nothing to gain from
you, other than
your goods, wed just kill you and take them. And honestly there were only a very few that
were worth
talking to. 

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-- (You are ruthless, because you couldn't find anybody named "Ruth" who would lower
themselves to join you, maybe.  You are the thing in the shadows that make us sick.  You are
the evil scourge that plagues the servers. )</font>

<P>We learned from Rainman and ERASER not to even waist time talking to people because they
would put up a front of being pro-IC when the whole time they were just scheming to kill us.
We grew not to trust anyone, and because of this mistrust we talked to outsiders very
seldomly, and because of this it is said that we do not role-play.

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-- (I just can't get over how much you guys suffered by the totally unfair tactics used
against you.)</font>

<P>And what exactly is role-playing? Evidentially it is not character development or guild
interaction or accumulation of goods nor is it building a reputation. I say that because I am
constitanly accused of not role-playing, yet that is what I do.

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-- (Okay, since you asked so nicely, I will give you a clue here...
<blockquote>
<BR>Not Role-Playing: 
<BR>PKiller-1: Hey there's another one!

<BR>PKiller-3: Give it to me.  I'll go find the house.

<BR>PKiller-2: Bly me!  This bugga' had a key on him!

<BR>PKiller-3: Let's have the key here.  I'll be off t' bring back the ol' boy's treasure!
<BR>All PKillers laugh boisterously.

<P>        ...the problem here is, player killers don't have time or the inclination to put on a
show like this because either way it's played, they get what they want.  Personally, if I had
just ONCE been murdered in this fashion during my time as a UO player, I would have
considered it well played and part of the game.  This isn't Quake, guys, it's Britannia.
It's one thing to be a terrible role-player, but it's something else not even to make the
attempt.)</font>
</blockquote>

<P>The other big thing I am accused of on a regular basis is bug exploitation. Well folks, I
hate to break it to you, but everyone used these same exploitations against us. Should it be
fair that "good" players get to use the exploits but not us "evil" types? I think not. But
yet you never see anybody complaining about "good"
people using these exploits to kill "evil" people. Why is that? Oh yes, I know, its because
us evil types know that death is a part of this game we play. The game we play is the same
game you "good" types play, look at the box our game came in, then look at the box your game
came in, yes, they are exactly the same. 

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-- (It's rare I make a concession, but this part makes a valid point.  A cheater is a
cheater, regardless of how many or how few player-characters they kill.  The bad reputation
player killers have earned has resulted in their being blamed for more than is their due in
many cases when it comes to bug exploitation...)</font>
<P><font color="#9D0000">Shadoe???  Tsk Tsk...  He just claimed that he cheated and used exploits to 
accomplish his murders (and develop his character) just because "Other guys do".  Since when did two 
wrongs ever make a right?
<P>Nobody should cheat, and I did it just because he did is a lame excuse.</font>

<P>If you don't like the way we play, do something in-game about it, don't complain to the
programmers to change the rules of the game. 

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">--(...However, too many players in the market think as I do when it comes to player killing
in general.  That is, I don't get into an online game to play the role of a police officer.
Playing a bounty hunter once in a while can be fun, but that's not what I want to do every
time I feel like playing.  The diversity that online roleplaying has to offer means I
shouldn't have to.)</font>

<P>It all boils down to this: Pkillers are the type of players that thrive on player vs. player
competition. Not
everybody likes that type of game, but since pkilling is allowed within the game you should
learn to live with it, or dont play the game. If you dont like the role we choose to play,
then role-play a bounty hunter and come kill us. Dont complain and whine about us not
role-playing, role-play yourself.

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-- (On that same token, don't whine about what people say about you and how you play.  You
made the choice to be a player killer, and you have to learn to live with the fact that
you're very unwelcome by many people out there who don't think they should have to deal with
the likes of you.  If you don't like the policies the game's manufacturer has put into effect
because of their customers' complaints that the game is no longer fun for them due to player
killing, then give up your lifestyle and try something that requires a little more
creativity.)</font>

I did some minor editing to the image that I received.  I removed a gaudy red reference to the everquest website from the bottom (and added a gaudy reference to my site :), smoothed the image a bit, and converted it to a windows standard palette (better for folks with 256 color displays).
