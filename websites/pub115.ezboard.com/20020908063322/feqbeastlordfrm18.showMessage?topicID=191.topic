 Tiz a sad day for Mages Good day all. I'm definately on the lower echelon of mages at a mere 21, but I've come across something that I definately needed to post. I saw a post a while ago that I couldn't find again, where someone complained that the Beastlords warders were conning at or near the level of their controller. Someone replied to that with something to the effect of, &quot;That doesn't mean that your pet won't tear throught their warder while your laughing and enjoying your summoned Ale.&quot; Unfortunately, I'm very sad to report that, yes it does. I tested this out twice (far from scientific I know) and I'm proud to report that &quot;%M&quot; won both times.(Both times my pet was 20, and his pet was 21) But not by the margine that they should have. My pet report the first time at 19% health after defeating Sparky, and 21% health the next time. Frankly I'm F&amp;$&amp;%$&amp;%^king pissed about that one folks. I far more than agree with the other complaints that I hear, and whole heartedly agree that if we're gonna miss out on of the props that the other INT casters get, our pets need to be buffer. But when a hybrid class gets pets and enough buffs for that pet to nearly take out my pet, Now I'm upset. And the BL's don't even have to worry about their pets outdamaging them, they Melee's for god sake. Well, ranting a bit, try the experiment yourself and see if you get the same results.<br>

Use guild chat or ooc for items and quit interrupting my interesting chat with someone who is not here<br>
<br>
since every mob pulled has melee loot on it no i dont give a<br>
@#%$ if this raid ends early in fact i will cheer<br>
<br>

anyways you are supposed to be beating on the mob with<br>
your ubah weapon you yap about<br>
<br>
yes i know no pets in &lt;insert area&gt; you say this every time<br>
we come here to amuse myself i have kept track of how many<br>
times you have said it this is the 3624th time you have said it<br>
if u can't remember that no pets are allowed here perhaps you<br>
should tape it to your monitor mr raid leader ie everytime you<br>
say no pets allowed i hear forrest gump and lmao at you<br>
<br>
i am doing exactly what you said i am keeping my faction for<br>
x group in a non kos state so i can walk down to the safe spot<br>
and coh you all in so no i cant blast any mobs i have other things to do in my spare time than kill stacks of greens for<br>
faction so deal bring more people and you wont get wiped<br>
by the way I need consent<br>
<br>
<br>
when you ask for summoned stuff take it dont make me stand there for 5 minutes while you shuffle junk around you moron<br>
<br>
&quot;NO I HAD NO CLUE YOU WERE A MONK&quot;/sarcasm off now take<br>

<br>
I am a Wizard of the 53 Season and after losing hours and hours of my life killing mobs for experience, buying/selling to upgrade my wizard, I was finally invited to a raid.<br>
<br>
A Naggy raid, yes, would be the first day I would meet a dragon! I was so happy! We had about 40 high level guys from 47 - 60. We killed those bats cleanning our way and I finally met those mobs that would change the life of my wizard forever. The Fire Giants.<br>
<br>
When I saw the first I tough: Bah! Piece of Cake. I can solo SGs and HGs with 2 or 3 bubbles of mana. I will freeze this guys! Let me cast Ice Comet! Maybe I can crit for 2200 hehehe.<br>
<br>
1st cast resisted<br>
2nd cast resisted<br>
3rd cast resisted<br>
/con = Blue!!!!<br>
<br>
Dammit!<br>
<br>
Maybe a low level ice spell will work, let me use this 39 level freeze.<br>
<br>
1st cast resisted<br>
2nd cast resisted<br>
<br>
I look around and everybody seems to have a good time. The level 50 warrior can crit for 230, the Rogue just BS for 400, the low level mage cant land the nukes but his air pet is doing a nice job! Me? The wizard? I am doing nothing to help and the giants cons blue and white.<br>
I was the only person who left the raid earlier. I was so frustrated!<br>
<br>
I left Everquest to check the level of the blue mobs that were resisting here:<br>
<br>
eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?id=3277<br>
<br>
Woot! They are 51!!! I am 53!!! the nukes should be working!<br>
<br>
Oh man! My fellow wizards of grafee have to tell me why the nukes cant land.<br>
<br>
Then I came here and asked and for my surprise they told me to cast on meele range!!! I replied saying that I am a wizard, the Everquest`s big guns. The artillery! I should stay behind the tank nuking. I donk have 4K Hit Points to enter the meele range. This isnt my job, I have a robe not a BP! I have INT not STA!<br>
<br>
Well now I see, the wizard is the only caster without pets to protect em and taunt the mobs, the only caster without FD and memory blur.<br>
<br>
Do we have to stand up after medding, walk forward looking back over our shoulders and see the other casters medding and enter the meele rangers and pray to dont score a crit hit to dont over agro and dont be killed?<br>
<br>
I used to pray to land critical hits but after I learned that wizards have to cast on meele range I still dont know if that is a good Idea. I better be a rogue.<br>
<br>
This sucks! Are you saying that we have spells that cant hit blues? We have some useless spells that cant be used inside dungeons? If I am short on mana my only option will be Lure of Frost? Wont I be able to cast a mana cheap nuke to help?<br>
<br>
My question is: If I go today to Naggy lair and cast Lure of Frost on these Fire Giants, What will happen?<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks <br>

Wizard soloing sucks. At least it sucks pre-29, can't speak about after that though.<br>
<br>
Level 16 wizard, in the Overthere, on the &quot;easy&quot; side.<br>
<br>
1.) Walk out and find a likely target.<br>
2.) Cast bolt spell<br>
3.) Start spamming root, pray to Solusek it holds<br>
4.) Nuke until dead<br>
5.) DOH root broke, if lucky and it doesn't, go to #9<br>
6.) Take 75% of life in damage rerooting the fugger<br>
7.) Back away<br>
8.) Finish nuking till its dead<br>
9.) Loot<br>
10.) Limp back to OT<br>
11.) Med for 5-7 minutes to get FOM again<br>
12.) If root broke wait another 5 minutes to finish healing.<br>
13.) Repeat<br>
<br>
Mad, insane, ridiculous downtime! Other option is to deal with the....charming....individuals in either Oasis or Highpass Hold (no loot for YOU!). I don't want to be one of those &quot;crack beggars&quot; pestering random enchanters for breeze/clarity, but its getting pretty bad.<br>

 I am not a Nexus Scion! Ok... i was once perma-/role to avoid having to deal with TLs. Eventually i took that off, found my TL requests had really dropped off, and was happy to be able to show my level and class again without a screen full of tells.<br>
<br>
Well for some reason, everyone is bugging me again. I am sitting there, minding my own business (which does not involve being a taxi btw) and random_warlock_23 sends me a tell asking for a TL to CS. I say ok, 20p. (I charge everyone who isn't a friend or guildy 20p for any location. I am tired of explaining which ones have frags and which don't, i'm tired of explaining how much they cost or where they are sold or how many stacks i can go through in just a few hours, and i don't care to be at the mercy of other's definition of &quot;donation&quot; which often translates to &quot;big fat nothing.&quot; So if you want me to stop what i'm doing, give me 20p (yes, ONE hill giant's worth of change) and i'll send you. Yes i make exceptions for the poor and downtrodden who kiss my toes in the appropriate manner.)<br>
<br>
So anyway this lunatic 60 necro argued with me that the 20p i charge is &quot;outrageous.&quot; WTF 20p is outrageous to a lvl 60 character? Give me a damn break. Just for him i think i'll raise my price to 100p for any level 60 haha. (j/k) He goes off on some tangent about him summoning corpses. And i'm thinking... yeh... if i ever had to get some random necro i didn't know to summon me, i'd damn well provide transport to and from, and the coffin, and at least 100p in tip. And if he wanted to charge me more than what i tip, i would pay it and be happy to have my damn corpse back, or politely decline and find a necro in my price range. So because the reagent only costs 2p he thinks i should just buy and carry multiple stacks of the frelling things and TL anyone who asks for free just because they figured how to type &quot;TL to CS plz?&quot; I think not. If frags are so cheap and easy to get, you need to carry a stack on your lazy necro ass and i will happily TL you gratis.<br>
<br>
Then the next day somebody else who i said no to (claimed to be CRing from CT to WL... who the hell binds in CT? I find this fishy when i know Tormax is up...) goes off on me and says he's friends with my guildleader and he'll be mad i didn't help him. I'm thinking yeh right, the guildleader will tell you to stuff it. If the GL had wanted me to TL his friend he damn well would have sent me a tell asking me to please help out his friend, and i doubt he is close friends with anyone who would threaten to sic him on me anyways. Bleh people suck.<br>
<br>
I am so on the verge of becoming that bitchy wizard who just refuses to port anyone except friends and guild. And when anyone argues with me, i'll tell them to thank their fellow EQ players for their lovely attitudes, because i'm not porting anyone any longer. Why should i take this abuse to get you where you want to go? If i say no, @#%$ accept that gracefully. If i charge a fee, STFU and either pay my fee, find another port, ride the @#%$ bus or walk. I am not a nexus scion.<br>

(I could continue these, but there's about a dozen simmilar posts, just worded differently)<br>
<br>
<br>
My point is - everyone has to complain about something.  Everyone sees how good everyone else has it, and how bad they are.  We all have problems.  Sure, the other classes are more <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  complete</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> than ours, but.... in perspective - at least we don't have to camp Phinny, or Ragefire, or kill dragons for our epic.  At least we can solo fairly easily at all levels (well, 36-38 weren't easy...), while wizards (early on) have to use strategy or <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>die</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.  Well, even using strategy they die.  And Mages and Wizards both seem to not be selected for groups, sound familiar?  How much do you think shamans love working on Alchemy, spending a fortune on supplies for potions they know people <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  will not buy.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  How about a warrior, who in the high end of the game, really cannot solo at all, has an epic that is extremely difficult (and can be expensive).  Or that rogue who gave up soloing a while ago, as it is hard to solo and backstab at the same time (and rogues are usually overlooked for warriors, paladins, shadowknights, monks, and rangers when it comes to melee - because the others usually can tank).  At least our spells work after each successive patch, unlike bards where after a patch, many of them wonder what broke this time.  Then there's the Enchanter, who got a cool new toy with the dire charm AA, only to have it nerfed shortly after the first people started rolling out to use them.  The Clerics and their long lines of people waiting on a single spawn - monks also with Raster (and while there used to be a surefire method of avoiding that camp, Verant workers decided to make it not so surefire, and made Brother Zephyl not always drop the robe he once did).  Hell, when the game was first released, that robe required the monk to be pretty good at tailoring too...  Imagine the fun many of us had getting all the parts, completing raster/etc. only to turn around and have it all go poof because of the skill requirement.  Oh yea, those were the good ol days.  How about the druid, who aspires to be a secondary healer, and is outclassed by a shaman with Torpor, who is generally their equivalent up till 60.  Or the enchanter who sees every raid as a loss of 2-3 blue bubbles of XP for no gain, as raids frequently hit mobs that drop melee gear, not caster gear.  Wizards and Druids are constantly riddled with requests to port, and get increasingly less time to level themselves.  Clerics get the same with Rezzes.  The list goes on.<br>
<br>
So, when posting that our class sucks because of this or that, step back, see what the other classes are saying about themselves, see what they say about us. take it all into perspective, and you just might see that yes, there is at least a little balancing already here. <p><div align=center><img src="http://www.eqguild.net/guilds/skyknights/OgulerSig2.jpg" alt="Oguler Denju" width=450 height=140>

I vivdly remember saying the same exact thing in a few other posts, and granted, I didn't take the time and effort to dig up other class' rants, but I guess people just didn't believe me.  I wonder if those very same people complain about other classes they play.  I'm willing to bet 2 jars of catnip that they do. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And yes folks, even the most desired classes in the game such as clerics and enchanters complain too.  I will never forget the day a 58th lvl wizard sent a tell to my cleric asking me to run into the wurm caves in GD to pull his corpse out and rez him while he sunned his buns in a zone far far away.  WTF?  You're a friggin wizard!  You have ports, which you can port yourself to GD, plus you have invis.  I as a cleric do not.  WTF makes you think I will charge in there sans invis and try to find YOUR corpse when you can get it in a fraction of the time and much safer especially when I'm the one doing you a friggin favor by giving you back the week's exp that you lost?<br>
<br>
My RL boyfriend plays a chanter.  Know how often he gets tells from druids asking him to go to them to crack their lazy asses?  Hey dr00d boy, you have SoW and track, you want it? Come and get it.  Afraid you'll lose your camp? Well huh, how about that.  We all can't have our cake and eat it too now can we?<br>
<br>
Again, point is every class, regardless of how &quot;complete&quot; or uber they are they will complain.  You're not the first, certainly won't be the last, and are most certainly not alone.  Just learn to play and have fun. <p><A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~blusafyre/siggallery.html" TARGET=new><IMG SRC="http://arnemetia.homestead.com/files/EQSigs/TatanaTigereyes.jpg" BORDER=0 ALT="Sig Gallery"></A>

Some of the rants are legitimate, like the amount of discourtesy shown to folks like clerics and porters of all strips for performing incredibly useful services like teleports, translocates, and resurrections of all levels.  The rants about class deficiencies none of us can fix (supposed to be VI's job, keep working programmers!) but in the very least pay it forward, folks, do a nice deed for people when you can and it DOES sink in to some heads a time or two.  It may be a byline for salespeople and tech support but courtesy IS contagious... be friendly, make the real schmucks show their true colors by being nice.  If the courtesy isn't returned, well hey, /ignore works wonders....<br>

<br>
BTW, to all you clerics, enchanters, druids, wizards, and mages, thank you for the many rezzes, heals, breezes, clarities, TPs, SoWs, translocates, damage shields, summoned items, and general nice things you've done for me the last year and a half.  I may not always say it but I appreciate the nice things.  Keep it up.<br>

But i do not thank my groups chanter for KEI, i do not thank the shaman for buffs, nor do i thank the cleric for heals.  Why not?  It's their JOB.   None of them thank the Rogue for a backstab.  No one thanks the Warrior for tanking.  No one thanks me when i send my pet in then start to melee.  Give thanks where it is due but don't dilute it by grovelling over any spell someone casts on you. <p>Vecsus Strangiato <br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Diary of a Beastlord</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  <br>
Sunday:<br>
Being a Beastlord gets lonely sometimes. My pet doesn't talk back to me....I think he's growing a mean streak.He never says thank you for Haste...anymore. I keep him healed and he never compliments me on my weapon choices. Just cuz he can fight better. Hey, buddy...I'm trying.<br>
<br>
Monday:<br>
He keeps laughing after every triple attack. I just know he's laughing at me. Even after I run out of mana, he's sure to let me know when a buff dies. He's selfish like that. He plays with Fire too...and Ice... We've tried therapy...he just stands there twirling in circles, and never answers the doctor's questions. <br>
<br>
Tuesday:<br>
He doesn't like other creatures. He wants to kill everything,  he always faces the nearest creature he can smell, with that mean glare..but at least he blinks...a lot. I think he knows he's better than they are, but he's still not talking to me, so I don't know. <br>
<br>
Wednesday:<br>
I had to upgrade my equipment today. My warder just wandered around sniffing the vendors. He didn't steal anything for me. He's not helping the cause much. Got a huge hammer to swing in combat. Tried it out, and I did a lot of damage. Still can't hit as good as my warder. He still laughs. <br>
<br>
Thursday:<br>
He's slow to follow me. Sometimes it really gets on my nerves, cuz he knows I need him to do most of the fighting. It's embarrassing he's 12 levels lower, and hitting mobs better than me. Such a show off.<br>
<br>
Friday:<br>
His buffs cost too much to cast. Yet, he still doesn't stop letting me know when they drop. Cut me some slack, I don't get no-mana spells like you. I swear when I get my Epic, you're gone. I tell him this, he ignores me and keeps chasing his tail. Why does he have to be so arrogant?<br>
<br>
Saturday:<br>
We're doing dragons today...Guildleader says I can't bring my warder along because he'd cause problems. What am I going to do without my pet? Attack the Mob? With these weapons? I miss my warder. Being a Beastlord can get so lonely.<br>
