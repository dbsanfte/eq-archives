Hobbess to Shobby to Seboa and the serverwide GM system</span><hr size=1> The past week has been somewhat frustrating for me, and other than yelling numerous obscenities at GM's and getting banned I couldn't think of where to get it off my chest until I remembered this forum.<br><br>First a little background to the story, I play on luclin, and prior to the change to the new GM system I never got frustrated with GM's.  Maybe frustrated about how long it took to talk to one, but they were always very nice, and fairly relaxed.\<br><br>This is my story, the facts have not be altered or exagerated in any way because frankly they need no exageration, and represent the situation as I understand it.<br><br>Last thursday after some hunting in the Rathe Mountains I was saying farewell to my party and getting ready to camp when a GM popped up.  They were I assume helping one of my party members who apparently had been having some trouble.  I hailed the GM, just because it seems the thing to do when you see one, sort of a recognition of someone important (at least in my world) and continued to camp out unaware of the the domino I had just flipped over.<br><br>Saturday morning, bright and early.  I was anxious to play since I hadn't gotten a chance on friday, and logged on only to be momentarily confused by my character selection screen.  After a few seconds and some mouse clicks I realzied my Beastlord had been renamed from Hobbess to Shobby.  I never got a warning, presumably because I had logged out too quickly for the GM to send me one.  I proceeded to petition and went about my day, trying not to be too annoyed.  11 HOURS of straight play time later I had recieve tell from a guide or GM.  I know its the weekend but to me that just means more people are going to be playing and more people will be having issues.  I checked several times during the day to see that my petition was still in the queue.  As my play time drew to a close I was feeling fairly frustrated, and went ahead and sent an email petition in via the EQ website.  So far the only email back I have recieved so far was an automated one telling me it had been recieved.<br><br>Jump ahead to yesterday (wednesday) the other day of the week when I get a large amount of continuous play time.  I decided to try a petition again.  This time I had some success.  About an hour later a guide sent me a message asking about my petition.  I politely explained to him the problem.  He looked at whatever guides look at and reported that their was no record of a name change.  As I tried not to laugh, he told me he would foward my petition to GM level.  Another hour later I recieved a tell from GM: Blixtev (or something close) who once more asked me about my problem.  As soon as he said &quot;how can I help YE&quot; I should have known it was hopeless to get my old name back.  Despite that I again politely explained about my name change, and for a round or two of tells I played somewhat dumb about the comic and insisted I was refering to Sir Thomas Hobbes the philosopher and not a major historical figure.  Getting frustrated I gave up and asked my friends for thoughts on a new name since I was entitled to a choice for one since my name hadn't been obscene, just borrowed from a comic.<br><br>After a brief disscussion we decided on Seboh, and the GM at first accepted it and dissapeared, and I thought life could go back to somewhat normal.  However not to be outdone the GM realized Seboh was just Hobbes backwards and with a letter missing and told me to stop with the calvin and hobbes theme (my last name is Nivlac).  He immidiately changed my name to Brungo of all things.  I was getting pretty annoyed at this point.  So to just end the issue I went with the other name my friends and I had come up with, Seboa.<br><br>Of course with every name change i went through my hot keys all dissapeared, which made playing more frustrating.<br><br>Don't the GM's have anything better to do than play name police?  <br>And overall I'm pretty p.o'd at the server wide gm system because it took the wonderful Luclin GM's away.  <br><br>I wanted to just scream at this GM.  &quot;HELP YE&quot;?!  It's a game, and I am a person in the real world with a problem, and the problem has put me outside the world, I need help from outside the game mechanics world.<br><br>The naming policy is way to arbitrary, or not lax enough.  Hobbes can be a persons name (I knew someone in high school with it) a last name, as can many other posibly policy violating names!<br><br>-Hobbess<br><br> <p>Did I post that?

The real problem is they are not uniformly or consistently applied. You can get away with a name like &quot;Bobbarker Priceisright&quot; (actual name of a mule sitting on my server nearly nonstop in bazaar) for years. Or, you can have a name like yours taken away because a GM happens to have a bug up his butt and sees you online.<br><br>I've had similar experiences. I had a necromancer named Hemoglobin. No last name, just that. At level 30 a GM who happened to see me a the bank in Cabilis told me I had five minutes to decide on a new name or they would assign one at random.<br><br>Or, with my current character, Unruly. I wanted the last name Kitten. But no, five different GMs told me I could not have that last name because my name would be a phrase. Well, what about the literally 1,000s of different people who have names that are phrases already?<br><br> <p><br><br><img src="http://www.intelligamer.com/kerbe/unrulysig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub115.ezboard.com/utipop.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tipop</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><HR color=#CC3300><font color=#330066><CENTER><b><font color=#000000 face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=1>Beast Overlord Kraggan</font></b> </CENTER></font><HR color=#CC3300></span><br>  Posts: 1287<br> <font color=#871F78>(8/15/02 1:03:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub115.ezboard.com/feqbeastlordfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=190.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.telocity.com/~Tipop2000/minimark.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: From Hobbess to Shobby to Seboa and the serverwide GM sy</span><hr size=1> Actually, I kinda agree with the GM in this situation.

On Rallos Zek I have a monk named Hobbess, Bristlebane one a mage named Sebboh, and on Luclin a bard named Sebboh.  I wasn't trying to pull a fast one, I asked him if  Seboh was alright, and he changed it and took off.  Yes its themed, I like calvin and hobbes, philosophers and comic characters both.  <br><br>And thats the thing though.  The name Seboh was not unnacceptable by itself, it was merely because it had a connection to my current theme.  That the name was unacceptable becasue of the previous one is just having a bug in their rear.  RuhtrA would likely be an acceptable name for a character, but if someone wanted to have it because its Arthur backwards its a violation?  What about Colnlin (Lincoln letters slightly shifted)?<br><br>I could be fine with not being able to have the name Hobbess.  However the game let me have it (which means it wasn't vetoed on creation), and numerous previous GM's had been fine with it.  I talked a bit with a gm on seperate wedding occasions, once had to email a gm asking for my character by name to be restored because he had been deleted by an accident at verants end, and never did they say to change my name, or that their was something wrong with it.  I don't think someone seeing my name pop up in a chat screen broke anyones sense of immersion in the game world.<br><br>But then 2 new GM's come along and have a hissy fit, I have to suffer.  I liked my name, as you can see here I use it all over the web and with email accounts.  The luclin GM's essentially gave me permission to be Hobbess, and then these two took it away.  It's like one parent saying you can have a cookie, and another saying no you can't.  Which one is right?<br><br>-Hobbess <p>Did I post that?
