Powerlevellers in the City of Mist</span><hr size=1> OK, this is my first new topic post to the rants forum.<br><br>I logged on last night to try and get the last few blues to ding 51.  The City of Mist is my favorite hunting grounds due to the nice combination of mobs blue to my warder and XP bonus.  I had logged off in the stables.  Lo and behold, when I get there, I see a LEVEL 28 CLERIC getting whacked on by three mobs.  Near him, a level 60 druid and 49 cleric, both obviously being used to powerlevel him.<br><br>Hang on a sec... the lowest level mobs in the City of Mist are 35, with about half in the 36-39 range and the other half in the 40-47 range (excluding reavers).  I'm level 50.  I was a bit offended by that, but no biggie.<br><br>I went over to the bridge and started pulling the light blues &amp; blues there.  But it turns out the powerlevellers are camping the entire front half of the first floor!  Which leaves the temple area (which I can't generally single-pull) and the back bridges (which I can never single pull).  I did the numbers, that's THIRTY-TWO spawns this level 28 cleric was monopolizing.  Those spawns are on a 22-minute timer.<br><br>So much for my favorite hunting grounds.<br><br>Anyway, I know that at level 50 I can simply walk out of the city of mist and get decent, but not great, experience off the wandering mobs in Emerald Jungle.  This night I simply logged off in disgust that the level-appropriate mobs in the City of Mist that I'd been logged on a large part of the day killing were monopolized by a pair of powerlevellers and their twink thirty-two levels lower than me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub115.ezboard.com/uzzyrrin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zzyrrin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beast Lord</span><br>  Posts: 126<br> <font color=#871F78>(6/12/02 6:41:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub115.ezboard.com/feqbeastlordfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=115.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Powerlevellers in the City of Mist</span><hr size=1> *smiles*<br><br>I hear ya.

In my earlier days (level 44-56) I ran AoE groups in this zone all the time.  A competent level 52 AoE group can keep the entire first floor cleared while getting XP for every mob.  I often run AE groups in other zones that keep large areas of the zone clear, and although we always try to accomodate the &quot;regular XP&quot; camps, sometimes they unwittingly get in the way.<br><br>Additionally, if you invoke the PnP too many times, you get a reputation as a &quot;PnP Loser&quot; (as in, sore loser threatening GM intervention because his spawn was camped).  So that's why I didn't invoke it.  I just let them have their fun, read some Harry Potter, and went to bed.<br><br>If it were a regular group holding thirty-two spawns, that's actually pretty routine in the City of Mist.  It's the fact that it was a level 28 cleric twink being powerlevelled that I guess got my goat about the whole situation.  No way a level 28 could even survive in this zone without major intervention from higher-level characters, and the only level-appropriate player was the level 49 cleric healing the little hairy-footed clown.<br><br>Ah well.  Maybe I'm just jealous that I don't have my own pocket 49 cleric and 60 druid. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub115.ezboard.com/usqrlcub.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SqrlCub</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#FF0000><CENTER>Beast Lord</FONT></CENTER></span><br>  Posts: 297<br> <font color=#871F78>(6/12/02 8:55:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub115.ezboard.com/feqbeastlordfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=115.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Powerlevellers in the City of Mist</span><hr size=1> The really sad thing was this cleric had a druid with him who could evac him out to a zone with a better experience modifier that is actually empty of people wanting to level (like Nurga). I have never been powerlevelled and typically don't have a beef against it until they start monopolizing several camps at once in order to get better and faster experience. <br><br>I have also done some AoE types of groups where we kill practically everything in a zone. However, as the primary puller in those types of camps, I would never take anyone elses spawns when pulling for AoE. However, this group was powerlevelling and not anything like AoE because only one person was getting the benefit of the spawns. Like I said earlier it would have been easy enough for them to go to another empty dungeon and not monopolize the area.<br><br>I would have likely done what you did in the situation. A better solution would have been to ask the druid to help you split the harder mobs in the back and then taken a higher level camp with 3-6 mobs. If the druid was unwilling then I would have just taken one of the camps they were pulling from. Taking the whole floor of spawns is just wrong especially when only one of them was getting experience... and at that experience that was significantly higher than he could have killed on his own.<br><br>Poop<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub115.ezboard.com/uvecsusbst.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VecsusBST</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beast Lord</span><br>  Posts: 104<br> <font color=#871F78>(6/12/02 9:29:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub115.ezboard.com/feqbeastlordfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=115.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Powerlevellers in the City of Mist</span><hr size=1> I would have set up at one of the other traditional camps and just started pulling.  There is no rule/code/law that says any one person is entitled to monopolize an entire area of the zone.  Tradition established where certain camps are.  Shout "Camp Check" in a zone like LGuk or Seb and you will see what the names of these camps are.  In a place like Seb a group might be camping both front and back disco but if another group moves into the area they are entitled to take the one the existing group is not pulling to.  No one cries about it unless they are snobs and do you really care what snobs think of ya?  I don't.<br><br>  There is nothing wrong with powerleveling but if you do it be prepared to accomodate the traditional gamers.  <br><br>BTW, make sure you remember the name of the cleric being PL'd.  I shudder to think what his/her spell casting abilities are like in the lvl 55+ range. <p>Vecsus Strangiato <br>Level 58 Beastlord <br>Tarew Marr <br>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=212314 </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub115.ezboard.com/uharius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Harius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#FF0000><CENTER>Animist </CENTE></FONT></span><br>  Posts: 498<br> <font color=#871F78>(6/12/02 12:13:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub115.ezboard.com/feqbeastlordfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=115.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://purpletel.com/gs_gakken2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Powerlevellers in the City of Mist</span><hr size=1> I think as an AE'r you shouldn't be complaining to much from getting a taste of your own medicine <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>(no offense)<br><br>Personally if someone says they're camping a whole BIG area and it's obvious it's not on the up and up.

When i made it to the gazeebo thing, alot of times 2 would come, but being a shaman i could root one and run back to where my pet was parked.  Where i fought was far enough away for the rooted one not to aggro me where i was fighting.  Gonna be hard to do that as a beast unless you get those nets from CC.  Once you got it broke you shouldnt have to use them anymore.
