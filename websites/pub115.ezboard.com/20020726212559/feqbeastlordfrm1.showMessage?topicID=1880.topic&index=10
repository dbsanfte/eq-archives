Some spells we get one tier later though, so thats perhaps part of the problem.  Rangers get thier sow on the appropirate tier compared to druids, so its arguable that SoW should be a 22.<br>
<br>
BY the same system, we should get regeneration at 49 if we were to get it at all.<br>
<br>
In general though my BL is a lotta fun to play, even without uber rare equipment.  I just wish there was some hand to hand weapons that were easier to get post 40.  A problem liek that however could be fixed by enouraging more hunting in Mons Letais, Tenerbous Mountains, and Twilight sea somehow.  Indirect fixes aren't all bad, though I do think the high level pet needs some direct attention.<br>

Sure several of these things have since been fixed, but why weren't they there up front?<br>
<br>
Hybrid tuning a while back gave them a seperate cast timer to allow meleeing while casting. Also, they recieved a spell casting adjustment to fizzle less. The first has since been added to the beastlord, but it took several months, the latter?<br>
<br>
The level 54 Strength buff is the Druid/Ranger spell and adds less STR for more mana cost than the buff we already have. I have /bug /feed this many times, shouldn't this be the Furious Str we get on our Wild Lord and Velious gear? Verants answer is dead air... hiiissssss...<br>
<br>
Spell drops, heh heh, coming here from the Shaman I know all about flaky drop tables, but even still the rarity of the 54/56 procs, and Sha's Advantage is ungodly. I have at least seen Savagery for sale on various guild boards and once up for auction in EC. The other three? It is to laugh...<br>
<br>
While the very recent pet changes have made pets useable in many more places with less risk, it took 6 months since VI added a class even more reliant on the Pet than Mages/Necros to add changes that should have been in ages before they even thought about Beastlords. <br>

Hit lvl 52 last night in karnors and I swear it's a cold day in hell when a bunch of mobs could kill me with my pet up.  I'm sure there is some key tuning VI could do for the class but damn were pretty right on in our early 50's.  Honestly guys tell me when the last time you died with your pet up in a group situation?  I swear I don't think I've died in 15 levels, I've watched as those die around me rofl but when that pets up he's my ass saver, that's even hanging out while other group members escape to control the situation a bit.  So I don't know what to say about group or even raid situations right now, my guild lets me have my pet up and we do fine.  Obviously I'd like more resists for my pet and some kind of beast lord pet hold skill that's not aax and refreshes every few minutes or hell just give it to us for turning 51 hehe.  <br>
<br>
I agree that VI should have tuned this class faster than they did, hell we were a new class and should have been subject to some major scrutiny those first few months and totally tweaked instead of an afterthought.  I get the vibe we were thrown in and with all the problems VI had with the luclin release they just couldn't get to us.<br>
<br>
So yes a nice round of tweaking would be nice, armor tweaking would be appreciated, beast only weapons like other classes have from mob drops so were not competing with monks over hand to hand weapons.  Give us some more utility spells for grouping, some unique spells would be good, rangers get some great utility buffs that are unique to the class we should as well at earlier levels instead of weak versions of shamen spells.  <br>
<br>
Well back to work on lvl 53 and figure out how to change my damn signature rofl. <p>Mrowrr Purr

Maybe because I do play a SK I don't see many things wrong with the Beastlord class.<br>
<br>
 IMO Sks are the most overlooked class there is. The last straw was when they nerfed our best taunt spell (Disease Cloud) a few patches ago. This spell SKs get at level 9 and a great majority still used at 60. Absor even stopped by Shadowknight.org and had these words of wisdom for us:<br>
<br>
Let's talk about this. <br>
<br>
Disease Cloud is a 9th level spell. I think it's pretty odd that any change to a 9th level spell would/should be important to 50+ level SKs. <br>
<br>
This, to me, indicates that there's something wrong. A 9th level spell probably shouldn't be so useful that it's a problem for such high level characters. <br>
<br>
There are other, better and higher level spells that you can use to taunt. Yes, they cost more mana. But, if you look at this from the perspective of the game at large, what real sense does it make that high level SKs are using a low level spell? <br>
<br>
I'm just not convinced that this needs to be changed. <br>

 What I am trying to say is that we must just deal with things and not wait for Verant to fix them. Learn to improvise, adjust, and think. Have a problem then submit a /feedback and move on.<br>
<br>
 Beastlords are not the only class that needs tuning. Hang tough were a great class now and hopefully we'll only get greater as our community grows.<br>

 I feel Sks and BL have alot in common when it comes to the end game and we both face alot of the same issue's.<br>

I don't really think that this is the way to look at it.<br>
<br>
I've been deeply entrenched in this conversation for the past year and a half or so, having a wizard as my primary character (level 60).<br>
<br>
There are three general areas when considering balance...raid, group and solo.  Each of the classes has different levels of competencies in these...those that are truely aweful in one of the three tend to be truely awesome in another, and competent in the third. Others may just be adequate to good in all three (Shamans and druids come to mind).  Some are overcompensated, some are undercompensated, and it's these that need the attention.<br>
<br>
For instance...take the Wizard.  Wizards are awesome on raids...that's where a Wizard's true strengths shine through.  Wizards are competent at soloing.  Wizards (historically) truely suck in groups.<br>
<br>
Beastlord:  BSTs are awesome solo, competent (to good) in groups, and suck on raids.<br>
<br>
In my view, both are balanced.  Perhaps not balanced to the way you like to play, but balanced none-the-less they are.  If you are a heavy raider, who enjoys being in an extremely important role on a raid, perhaps BSTs are not for you...<br>
<br>
Now, take Cleric for instance.  Clerics are critical on raids.  Clerics are awesome in groups.  Clerics suck solo.  Is the cleric an unbalanced class because he can't solo?  I don't think so...if anything, they're overcompensated, having two areas that they truely excell at.  But, perhaps that's made up for by the complete lack of soloability.<br>
<br>
If anything folks, BSTs fall into the same category, especially in light of the latest changes to pets.  These changes have made the area that we suck at not so bad...<br>
<br>
We are awesome solo.  We are now better than we were in groups before the pet changes.  We are also now better in raids than we were before the pet changes.  <br>
<br>
What's left to be balanced?  We have it, overall, better than most.<br>
<br>
Finished?  Yes, we need to be finished.  But I don't see it being a balance issue, merely an implementation one.<br>

Mind you, it takes some consideration as to where and what we hunt.  However, I can solo at level 60 tanking beside my pet in Fungus Grove, Maiden's Eye, The Grey, and Velketor's Lab (4 of my most recent haunts) with little to no down time.<br>
<br>
To say we can't solo at 60 isn't necessarily true, but may fit a percentage of Beastlords out there due to gear or gaming tactics.<br>
<br>
I do see your point, however...we definately do not solo like a wizard or druid.  I cannot quad kite 4 mobs at a shot.  I can, however, take out a few mobs while they're medding for the next round.<br>

From previous questions I've asked, it seems that most higher 50s and 60 BSTs tend to tank for their pets, then bandage up/heal for minimal downtime, perhaps joust healing during the fights...<br>

But, even being inefficient at soloing is better than not being able to solo at all.  Even if, in my little system, BSTs were rated at &quot;average&quot; soloers, instead of &quot;good&quot; as I have them listed, we'd *still* not be &quot;unbalanced&quot; as a class considering our &quot;average&quot; status in the other categories.<br>
<br>
Again, being bad at one of the three does not make one unbalanced.  All three areas need to be considered.  Assuming the ratings of &quot;awesome, good, average, poor and aweful, there are several &quot;balance&quot; possibilities:<br>
<br>
average/average/average<br>
good/average/poor<br>
awesome/average/aweful<br>
good/good/aweful<br>
awesome/poor/poor<br>
<br>
If your class falls into any of those categories, you are &quot;balanced&quot;, in my opinion.  In *my* opinion, BSTs before the pet changes fell into the &quot;awesome at one, average in another, aweful in a third&quot; category.  <br>
<br>
After pet changes, I'd rate BST as Awesome/good/poor...which by my own ratings is &quot;unbalanced&quot; on the too good side, all things considered.  Again though, I'm not saying we're not &quot;finished&quot;...just that we're &quot;balanced&quot; by The Vision(tm).<br>
<br>
My thoughts on all the classes?  Keep in mind, these are my own opinion, take that as you will:<br>
<br>
Raid/Group/Solo<br>
Brd  average/good/poor<br>
Bst  poor/good/awesome - slightly unbalanced<br>
Clr  awesome/awesome/aweful - unbalanced<br>
Dru  average/good/good - unbalanced<br>
Enc good/awesome/aweful - slightly unbalanced<br>
Mag aweful/poor/awesome - unbalanced<br>
Mnk good/average/poor<br>
Nec aweful/poor/awesome - unbalanced<br>
Pal good/average/poor<br>
Rng good/average/poor<br>
Rog awesome/good/aweful<br>
Shk good/average/poor<br>
Shm good/average/average - slightly unbalanced<br>
War good/awesome/aweful - slightly unbalanced<br>
Wiz awesome/aweful/good - slightly unbalanced<br>
<br>
Couple of interesting notes:  By and large, the classes with finished &quot;balance&quot; by VI's &quot;The Vision&quot;(tm) fall in line with my chart above...and those that show unbalanced haven't been officially finished yet.  Guess my thoughts on balance are akin to Verants...which means I must be a Verant Fanboi!  &lt;gak&gt;<br>
Also, trends show...who are the 3 necessary classes for groups?  The Holy Trinity...War/Clr/Enc, clearly reflected in the chart.  Who are the most critical raid damage dealers?  Rogues and Wizards, again clearly reflected in the chart.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I digress.  Pls post your thoughts, always interested in tweaking the way I think about this topic.  <br>

If he has a brain then bards are the best outdoor expers bar none. Name one other class that can pull a nearly unlimited amount of mobs and kill them all off one by one with hardly any downtime whatsoever. Even if they do end up having to regen or med they have those hp/mana regen songs that greatly reduce what little downtime they have. As for raids they have so many very valuable roles to offer. They have resist songs, haste, crowd control, and those mana and hp regen songs to keep those clerics healing the ma in a fight.<br>
As for monks I REALLY have to disagree about the poor soloing thing. My main is a 50 monk and I have mainly soloed my way through all of those levels. The only time I bother to group is if I want to talk to people because the exp is faster for me solo. My gear is FAR from uber as well so its not like I am some kind of fungi wearing tstaff wielding twink monk. I am a regular monk with gear that is normal for my level and I have no trouble soloing. As to raids we are highly valuable as well. We are pullers without compare, and yes I know sks get an fd spell too but it can be inturrupted, my fd cant. When it comes to dealing damage we are only lower than rogues and fully aaexped rangers using bows in melee damage. <br>
I just wanted to straighten out a few points that I felt were a little off. I hope you dont take offense at my post.<br>

<br>
My main reasoning for bards not having a fantastic solo rating is the fact that it takes them so long to complete their kills.  Agree that their downtime is next to none, but when factored in with how long it takes them to down the mob, it ends up being the same thing as being able to kill a mob quickly and then having med time.  I have met many a bard in the upper 50s who scoff at the idea of spending their time solo due to that.  They say that it's simply so much more efficient to grab a group or duo that it makes no sense to them to spend their time soloing.<br>
<br>
I definately agree with your assessment on the monk, now that I think about it with a fresh angle.  The reason I rated them the way I did was due to their pulling on raids...it's needed, but not *critical* that it be a monk (in most cases) because other classes can do just as well, and in some places others are better (bards in PoG).  However, what I missed was the raid DPS.  Right up there on par with rogues, which I rate as awesome for raids based *solely* on their DPS.  Therefore, Monks need to be right there with 'em.<br>
The monk solo thing I just didn't know...I tend to read most class specific boards because I like to keep up on the different classes, but the main monk board is the one that I avoid with a passion...takes just too long to wade through all of the flames/whines/people hating each other.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>
<br>
Everyone else, I do keep this list for personal reasons...and am interested in others thoughts on it.  If you have experience that covers at least 50 levels with a class, and don't think my rating is fair, I'd appreciate a comment or two about it.<br>

<br>
You have more classes that are unbalance then are balance.  Maybe the ones you considered unbalanced are balanced and the others need help?  <br>
<br>
You have Rangers listed as poor soloers.  At level 22 Rangers get fear animal.  That, snare and sow, makes them average to excellent soloers all the way to 55 (later then 55 , but the risk puts the XP back in the poor to average category) depending on the player.  Yes it depends on a specific mob type, but Verant keeps building outdoor zones with plently of animal mobs.  Changing the Poor rating to good, which is about right adds them to the unbalanced list as well.<br>
<br>
Also You have Rogues listed with an awesome and a good, this puts them in your slightly unbalance list.  This leaves the 'hybrids' as the only classes that are 'balanced'  and they haven't done the hybrid balancing yet or finished with caster balancing.<br>
<br>
In my opinion the classes are rapidly approaching if not already balanced.  Do some classes still needs some raid help or group help or even solo help?  Maybe, but can any class in the game go to a raid or group and contibute if not as the most import class then as a supporting member, I say the answer is yes.  And remember EQ is not about soloing it is a Mult-player game that emphasizes grouping and raiding.<br>

<br>
(Maybe because I do play a SK I don't see many things wrong with the Beastlord class.<br>
Absor even stopped by Shadowknight.org and had these words of wisdom for us:  Absor stated...<br>
&quot;Let's talk about this. Disease Cloud is a 9th level spell. I think it's pretty odd that any change to a 9th level spell would/should be important to 50+ level SKs&quot;).<br>
<br>
This is funny.  Ask Absor what Verant stated way back when they tried to talk about class abilities.  Brad McQuaid and Company stated they ONLY meant for SOW to be used as transportation only...they were quite wrong.  And lets talk about that real low level spell 'Snare' which is much better then root, and when snare sticks you are guaranteed it will last a decent time.  What level spell is snare and sow Absor?  Let's also not forget what VI stated about the Feign Death skill, same ole, VI did not intend the FD skill to be used as breaking spawns and pulling.<br>
<br>
I been playing EQ off and on since release.  The biggest issue I see with Verant's delay in the Beastlord class is due to the folks in here.  Basically you guys don't whine enough.  It seems, even in past class improvements, Verant usually made quicker improvements to classes once there is a large uproar by the &lt;insert class here&gt; community.  This board is too mature for its own good...lol<br>

The funny reads are the peeps who are playing the BL class as their alt.

I mean isn't the whole point of the end game pretty much raiding? 1 spell that adds minor minor hp and mana regen doesnt make or break a huge raiding party in ssra or ntov. Having a wizard mana-burn does. <br>
<br>
I'd like to see some better /disc's, aa skills, and a quest class spell in the spot of the rng/druid str spell we have atm, and some beefier pets. ITS LAME that magi/necro pets are quading for 70's and ours is doing 55 dmg.<br>
<br>
Don't give us double attack, give us tiger claw at 35 and eagle strike at 55. Not earth shattering I know. However great skills. Beastlords are half monk right.. what exactly do they get from the monk class exept the leather armor penalty?<br>
<br>
<br>
PS - I WOULD LOVE to have a form of snare or root. That'd be awesome in the pace of the ranger/druid str spell. Maybe a root/dot or a snare/dot etc small dot 75 dmg same slow effect as lvl 1 druid snare? ;D Its not like VI hasnt tied in other spells from other classes before.. IE ranger feet like cat (shaman spell) .. never say never guys!<br>

And yes i know from experience..<br>
Yes clerics can solo undeads rather good actully and with a manastone they make very very good solo against undeads.But without stone they still arent great,The when the cleric try to solo normal mobs not undeads bye bye cleric.<br>
The main problem for this is that the cleric damage spells take very much mana and is all magic based.If you try to solo lets say a spider in velk at lvl 60 as a cleric you will have to burn maybe 3-4 or even a full manabar to kill it then have a great massive downtime after.<br>

I practiced soloing early on, just in case, cause I knew I didn't have invis coming to me anytime soon. If clerics had a snare spell, It would be all over. They would totally rock solo. As it is, they're not too shabby unless in pk, in which case fear is useless.<br>
<br>
Clerics stun, fear, root, heal self, and baby nuke. And have great AC if they play it right. If you know what you are doing, you can solo just fine.<br>

Beastlord - small mana/hp regen. 1 spell that's group friendly in a raid situation... that's 2 and the 2nd costs a dot 11pp for a 6 minute buff.<br>

Druid - resists damage<br>
Enchanter - duhh...<br>
Magician - damage<br>
Monk - pulling damage<br>
Necromancer - help with down time in a great way, damage<br>
Paladin - loh is spiffy, damage<br>
Ranger - damage, and dieing, some good buffs for the melees<br>
Rogue - damage<br>
Shadow Knight - good melee buffs, damage<br>

We've all seen Shadowknights and Rangers evolve. Used to be Rangers were for pulling and damage. Shadowknights were for taunting and tanking.. but with spells. Now rangers have some great melee buffs as well as awesome damage. Shadowknights have some nice melee buffs plus good damage at 60, &amp; pallies have always been nice to have in a group.<br>
<br>
Pretty much onlytime beastlords are highly utilized is when they're either solor or exp groups this is obvious. You most likely arent going to be buffing on a raid when you have 4+ guild shaman mass group buffing focus and what not. Then if you're pet less. It gets worse.<br>
<br>
So, for now I'm going to sit back and wait for 'beastlord raid friendlyness' to arrive. No point in beating a dead horse anymore VI knows the class isnt complete. <p><table width="350" border="0" bgcolor="#00662C"><tr bgcolor="#00A847"><td width="125"><div align="center"><img src="http://www.geraldfield.com/nadinesplace/muppetquiz/kermit.jpg" width="125" height="108"></div></td><td width="177" bgcolor="#00A847"><p align="center"><b><font size="3" color="#A4FFCB">You are Kermit!</font></b><font color="#A4FFCB"><br><font size="2">Though you're technically the star, you're pretty mellow and don't mind letting others share the spotlight.
