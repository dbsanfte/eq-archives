Usually send the cleric to loot up, he/she keeps spell regents and stuff (most people don't realize how much it costs to keep symbols going per night) and then passes out money and loot at the end. Commie looting keeps people from getting the item they want and then just doing a /q. I assume commie looting = master looting, sounds identical, just different name.  <p><a href="http://www.ncguild.com/" target="_blank">

But aslo for the good and bad. I been in many groups were the ML would happen to forget to split stuff as ppl announced thier leaving. Or ever better run off with nice loot drops expessly in velks and seb as they so happen to go ld shortly after looting. Its comman that Most Master looters are pretty cool and are honorible. But aslo pretty comman that thier are theives and robbers whom use the ML ablity to thier advantage to take the hard earned gains of an entire group to better profit themselves. <br>
<br>
In my humble oppition Master Looting is a love/hate relationship you either gotta trust the people doing it or take optional steps. If the master looter is in a respected guild and happens to steal said groups hard earned loot, goto thier guild leaders and file your complaint that way. Or don't group with them again or warn others about them. The EQ player enviorment is pretty good in most cases. I seen people found to be ML then running with said good drops and not honestly sharing like they said with group they are with in alot of hot water in a very short time. Either by finding no one wants to group with them to even removals and send tell warnings to group memebers with those ppl warning them about potental thiefs..<br>
<br>
I rarely group with my beastlord since I solo alot, I rarely ever get group invites into nice zones or even raids. But in truth the groups I been with I had been in a few (hehe many) were I wound up with no loot sale items by choice some times (cause i got very nice gear and feel I dont need loot items just exp is enough). An more often the Master Looter Stealing said earnings.. It happens I grown accustomed to seeing and being in groups an not expect to make any money gain at all.. (shurg)<br>
<br>
Good Example was...<br>
Velks<br>
5-24-02, Time: 4:30pm Cst...<br>
Cleric ML...<br>
2 wars<br>
1 bst <br>
1 chanter<br>
<br>
The cleric was the ml, over period of 5hrs this is what droped<br>
SCHW<br>
Broodmother ax<br>
Some very nice bracer i forget the name<br>
Eyeless spider mask <br>
And a couple nice loots....<br>
<br>
We got a huge pull of spiders and the warrors were getting hammered after the enchanter died trying to mes them. It was a horrible mess. The cleric wasn't healing anyone was only sitting the whole time as the enchanter died, then a warrior as the other war was asking for heals. Suddenly cleric goes ld.. I am stuck healing warrior as were making our retreat, 2ed warriors dies to fall I got 9 spiders on me bearly zoned. We all come back after finding a cleric to rez us.. THe cleric that ml'd for our group never reloged back in. He was in a uber guild I will not bother saying whom cuase I rather not have that type of heat.. Anyhow 2 days later I saw the cleric and sent him a tell about the loot were supose to random with said party. He responds &quot;What loot I wasnt even on that day and if I was I don't remember. So leave me alone&quot; <br>
<br>
Welp ML thieves happen what can you do =p<br>
<br>
Thats the main reason why I don't group much cuase in more ways then one I really dont get much out of them. <br>
But in the end I do enjoy the ones I do ask to tag along with cuase they are fun ppl not due to exp or loot. Just beacuse I did enjoy raiding with said parties. Some said parties like Nameless Order ROCKS! One of the best guilds out thier that are very kind to guildless people and allow them to tag along on raids. Its rare to see a large guild such as Nameless Order whom are quite open to new faces.. Anyhow I do hope to contuie raiding with them in the feature I honestly find grouping with them alot of fun compared to the every day exp grind =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub115.ezboard.com/utebdliz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tebdliz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Predator</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#871F78>(8/13/02 6:02:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub115.ezboard.com/feqbeastlordfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2732.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Thoughts on master looting</span><hr size=1> I prefer ML to any other looting tactic because /split does not distribute money evenly.  Have &quot;friendly&quot; looting at least one person loots half of it while the other half rot or are unevenly split.  The problem with ML is you have to trust the person doing it.  I personally dont trust anyone but myself and a few friends *but thats just me*.  I always split fair though I admit that i have missed sharing a gem or two but its been entirely accidental *find it as im clearing bag*.  It comes down to personal preferance if you arent happy with any part of your group ANY part leave.  I would not be in a group if for some reason the ML gave me bad vibes like yours obviously did.<br>
<br>
And for those who think ML means MY LOOT go to hell everyone else worked just as hard to get that stuff to drop as you did.  Learn to share or leave the F*#$ing game we will all be happier that way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub115.ezboard.com/ulucutos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lucutos</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Predator</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#871F78>(8/13/02 6:10:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub115.ezboard.com/feqbeastlordfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2732.topic&index=19>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Thoughts on master looting</span><hr size=1> Boy, all this just confirms the reason I moved to Test server in the first place.

My favorite thing to say about these massively multiplayer games is this:  &quot;The fact that you are playing with thousands of other real people online is at the same time the best AND worst feature of MMORPG's&quot;  In other words, people make and break this game at the same time.<br>
<br>
I don't really group anymore but I think would have to say in general, Master Looter in guild hunts or with friends, and FFA or taking turns with pickup groups.<br>
<br>
I don't know if it's typical of test server hunts, but for the first time in my whole time there I did a full 6 man pickup group in Solusek B.  I think our loot policy was &quot;just leave it all, we are too busy killing stuff&quot; LOL <p><CENTER><SELECT><OPTION>Shregg - 43rd Ogre Shadowknight<OPTION>Grizzlee - 26th Ogre Beastlord<OPTION>Hickoree Dickoree - 35th Halfling Ranger<OPTION>Kavlar Stormrider - 37th Half Elf Druid<OPTION>Barauk Bearspirit - 33rd Dwarven Paladin<OPTION>----------------------<OPTION>Lucutos Kul'Taan - Retired Dark Elf Rogue</SELECT><BR><FONT size=2>Test Server<BR><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=63564" target=_BLANK>Shregg</A> - <A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=310452" target=_BLANK>Grizzlee</A> - <A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=292885" target=_BLANK>Hickoree</A> - <A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22375" target=_BLANK>Kavlar</A></FONT></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub115.ezboard.com/beqbeastlord.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=grubbug>Grubbug</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Playful Cub</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#871F78>(8/13/02 8:38:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub115.ezboard.com/feqbeastlordfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2732.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ML</span><hr size=1> Me no really like master looting.

<br>
When the ranger refused to split the coin even after complaining that she was overweight you should have simply started looting stuff as soon as it died. Beat her to the punch so to speak.<br>
<br>
Let the people in the group who were on your side know that you don't trust her and that you'll split the loot with them afterward. <br>
<br>
I don't trust master looting in pick-up groups. I've been burned a few times and if I suspect someone of trying to steal all the loot I simply ask him/her to split the coin with the group every once in a while. If he/she refuses then I start to forcibly do FFA loot and begin looting a kill now and then. <br>
<br>
Two things happen when I do that: The person decides to split the loot with the group and then I stop the FFA looting and things continue as they were before, or the person still refuses to split the loot in which case the other group members usually start FFA looting like me as well so that the whole group's loot system is changed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now when I'm grouped with guildies I don't mind ML'ing because I know I can trust them.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub115.ezboard.com/uchasak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chasak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Playful Cub</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#871F78>(8/14/02 1:52:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub115.ezboard.com/feqbeastlordfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2732.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ML</span><hr size=1> good part on King Looting (Master Looting), the casters can med and don't need to stay near to mob to quick loot it, now if the King Looter is a loser and is only splitting cash and keeps the items, then this person has a serious problem. on Bertoxx King Looting is &quot;&quot;overall&quot;&quot; working well, sure the King Looter is getting little more loot sometimes  (cash loot), but overall the group is splitting up with an overall well splitted loot / cash <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub115.ezboard.com/beqbeastlord.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=tatter999>Tatter999</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Young Predator</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#871F78>(8/14/02 2:56:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub115.ezboard.com/feqbeastlordfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2732.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: ML</span><hr size=1> We call it Commie looting on Tunare .. <br>
